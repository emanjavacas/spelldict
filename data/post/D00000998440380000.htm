[Figure: Here begynneth the fyrste chapytre whiche telleth howe by whome the Cyte of Ladyes was fyrst begon to buylde.
AFter the maner that haue moche in vsage and to that thynge whiche the excercyse of my lyfe is moost dys posed that is to knowe in the haun tynge of studye.
On a day as was syttynge in my lytell cell dyuers bokes of dyuers matters aboute me.
Myne entente was at that tyme to trauayle and to gather in to my consayte the wayenge of dyuers sentences of dyuers auctours by my longe tyme before studyed.
dressed my vysage towarde those foresayd bokes thynkynge as for tyme to leue in peas subtyll thynges to dysporte me for to loke vpon some pleasaunt boke of the wrytynge of some poetes as was in this entente serched aboute me after some praty boke of aduenture came a straunge boke in to my handes that was taken to me to ke pe opened this boke and sawe by ye intytulacyon that it called hym Matheolus.
Then in lau ghynge bycause had not sene hym and often ty mes had herde speke of hym that he sholde not speke well of the reuerence of women.
And yet had not loked longe on hym but my good moder that bare me called me to the refeccyon of souper wherof ye houre was come purposynge to se hym in the mornynge lefte hym at yt tyme in moro we folowynge sate me agayne to my study as dyde of custome forgate it not in put my wyll to effecte yt came to me nyght before to vysyte foresayd boke of Matheolus.
But as me se med matter was not ryght pleasaunt to people delyted them not in euyll sayenge nor it was of no profyte to ony edyfyenge of vertue seynge the wordes the matters dyshonest of whiche it tou ched vysytynge here there so came to ende lefte hym toke hede of more hygher matters of more profyte yet the syght of this foresayd boke howe be it that he was of none auctoryte it enge~ dred in me a newe thought whiche made grete meruayle to growe in my courage thynkynge what myght be the cause and wherof it myght co me that so many dyuers men clerkes and others haue ben and ben enclyned to say by mouthe in theyr treatyse and wrytynges so many slaundres and blames of women and of theyr condycyons not onely one or twayne nor this Matheolus whiche amonge others hath no maner of reputacyon and treateth in maner of scorne but general ly in all treatyses of phylosphres poetes and all rethorycyens whiche sholde be longe to reherce all theyr names speketh as it were by one mouthe and accordeth all in semble conclusyon determynynge that condycyons of women ben fully enclyned to all vyces.
These thynges thynkynge in me ryght depely began to examyne myselfe and my condycyons as a woman naturall.
And in lyke wyse dyscuted of other women whos companye haunted as well of pryncesses and of grete ladyes as of meane gentyll women ryght grete plentye whiche of theyr graces haue tol de me theyr pryuytees and strayte thoughtes to knowe by my Iugement in conscyence and with out fauoure yt it it myght be trewe that so many notable men of one and other wytnesseth yet not withstandynge that for thynges myght kno we as longe as haue sought and serched cou de not perceyue that suche Iugementes myght be trewe agaynst the naturall condycyons or ma ners of women.
argued strongly agaynst these women sayenge it sholde be to grete a thynge so many famous men so solempne clarkes of soo hyghe and grete vnderstandynge so clerely seynge in all thynges as it semed that sholde haue spo ken or wryten lyengly and in so many places yt of payne founde ony morall volume what so euer yt auctoure were yt or had redde it to ende but some chapytres or certayne clauses were of blamynge of theym.
This onely shorte reason made me to conclude that myne vnderstandynge for his symplenesse ygnoraunce ne coude not knowe my grete defautes and semblably of other wo men that alwaye it accorded that it was so truely and soo reported me more to the Iugement of other then to that felte or knowe of myselfe.
Thus in this thought was as a persone halfe from hymselfe there came before me ryght grete foyson of dyttyes prouerbes of many dyuers auctours to purpose yt remembred in myselfe one after another as it were a welle spryngynge.
And in conclusyon of all determyned yt god made a foule thynge when he fourmed woman in howe soo worshypfull a werke man deyned euer to make one soo abhomynable werke whiche is the vessell as by sayenge of the~ draught herbegage of al euyll of all vyces Then beynge in this thought there sprange in me a grete dyspleasannce sorowe of courage in dyspraysynge myselfe all womenkynde so as yf yt sholde be shewed in nature sayd suche wordes in my'complayntes.
Ha lorde god howe may yt be for if arre not in fayth ought not doubt yt thyne infynyte wysdome veray parfyte goodnesse had nothynge made but yt all were good fourmest not thyselfe woma~ ryght syngulerly then gaue her all suche inclynacyons yt pleased ye yt she sholde haue howe maye yt be yt thou sholde haue fayled in ony thynge alway se here so many grete occasyons thus Iuged determyned co~ cluded ayenst them can not vnderstande this re pugnaunce yf it be so good lorde god yt it be true yt womankynde haboundeth in so many abhomy nacyons as many men wytnesseth thou sayest thyselfe yt the wytnesse of many is for'to byleue by the whiche ought not doubte but that it shol de be true.
Alas good lorde why haddest thou not made me to be borne in to this worlde in mascu lyne kynde to that entente yt myne euclynacyons myght haue ben al to haue serued the the better sholde not haue arred in ony thynge myght haue ben of so grete perfeccyon as they say yt men be yet syth it is so that thy debonayrnesse stretche th not so moche towarde me then spare my negly gence in thy seruyce good lorde god be not dyspleased.
For that seruaunt that receyueth leest rewardes of his lorde leest is bounde to his seruyce.
Suche wordes mo ynowe sayd ryght lon ge in my sorowfull thought to god and in my lamentacyon so as she that by my foly helde me ryght euyll contente of that that god made me to be borne in to this worlde in kynde of woman.
Xp~ine telleth howe. iii. ladyes appered to her howe she yt wente before reasoned with her fyrste and comforted her of the dyspleasure that she had Capitulo.
AS was in this sorowfull thought heed downe cast as a shamfull per sone the eyes full of teeres holdynge myne hande vnder my cheke lenynge on pomell of my chayre sawe come downe vpon my lappe a stremyn ge of lyght as it were of same.
And that was in a derke place whiche sone myght not shyne at houre sterte then as thoughe had ben waked of a dreme and dressynge the heed to beholde this lyght fro whens it myght come sawe befo re me standynge thre ladyes crowned of ryght so nerayne reuerence.
Of the whiche the shynynge of theyr clere faces gaue lyght vnto me and to all the place there as was meruayllynge neyther man nor woman with me consyderynge the dore close vpon me and they thyder came doubtynge leest it had ben some fantasye for to haue tempted me made the sygne of the crosse in my forehede ful of drede.
And then she whiche was the fyrst of the thre in laughynge began thus to reason with me Dere doughter drede nought for we be not come hyder for nothynge that is contrary vnto the nor to do the to be encombred but for to comforte the as those that haue pyte of thy trouble and to put the out of the ygnoraunce that so moche blyn deth thyne vndersta~dynge and that thou puttest fro the that thou knowest of very certayne to gyue faythe to the contrary to that whiche thou felest not ne seest not ne knowest otherwyse than by pluralyte of straunge opynyons.
Thou resemblest the fole of the whiche was made a Ia pe whiche was slepynge in mylle and whas clo thed in the clothynge of a woma~ and to make resemblaunce those that mocked hym wytnessed he was a woman so he byleued more theyr false saynges than certaynte of his beynge.
Howe is it fayre doughter where is thy wytte become Hast thou forgoten nowe howe fyne golde pro ueth hym in the fornayse yt he chaungeth not his vertue but is more plyaunt to be brought in to dy uers facyons.
And knowest thou not the moost mernayllous thynges be moost debatous most arguous yf thou wylte aduyse the In the same wyse to the moost hyghe thynges that ben yt is to knowe ye celestyall thynges.
Beholde yf these gre te phylosophres that hath ben that thou arguest agaynst thyne owne kynde haue determyned fal se and to the contrary of trouthe and as they repugne one agaynst another as thou thyselfe hast sene in boke of Metaphisike where as Arystotle reproueth theyr opynyons and reherseth the same wyse of Plato and of others note this agay ne.
If saynt Austyne and other doctours of chyr che haue done so the same wyse Arystotle in some partyes al be it that he be called the prynce of phy losophres and in whome Phylosophye naturall and morall was soueraynely.
And it semeth that trowest that al the wordes of Phylosophres ben artycles of the fayth of Ihesu cryst and that they maye not arre.
And as to these poetes of whiche thou spekest knowest not thou well that they haue spoken in many thynges in manere of fables.
And do entende so moche to the contrary of that that theyr sayenges sheweth.
And it maye be taken after the rewle of grammere the whiche is named Antyphrasys the whiche entendeth thus as thou knowest well 'as one sholde say syth one is a shrewe that is to saye that he is good and so by the contrary.
So counsayle the that thou do thy profyte of theyr sayenges thou vnderstande it so what so euer be theyr entente in suche places where as they blame women.
And peraduenture this same ma~ that is Matheolus in his boke vnderstode same.
For there be many thynges who so taketh them after the letter it sholde be pure heresye and shame to hym that sayth it not onely to hym but to others.
And the same wyse of ye Ro maunce of the rose on whome is put grete faythe bycause of the auctoryte of the maker of the ordre of maryage whiche is an holy estate worshypfull ordeyned of god.
This thynge proueth clerely by experyence that the contrary is true of the shrewdenesse that they purpose and syth to be in that estate to the grete charge and blame of women.
For who was euer that housbande yt euer suffred suche maystrye of his wyfe that she sholde haue leue to saye so many vylanyes and iniures as they put vpon women that they sholde saye byleue what so euer thou hast sene in wrytynge sawest it neuer at ye eye.
Thus say in conclu dynge my lefe frende that folye caused this presente opynyon.
Nowe come agayne to thyselfe take thy wytte trouble no more for suche fantasyes.
For knowe wel yt all this euyll saynges ge nerally of wome~ hurteth sayers not wome~.
Xp~ine sayth howe that the lady that reasoned with her deuysed what was her propryete wher of she serued and tolde her howe she sholde buylde a cyte with helpe of these.
THis famous lady sayenge these wor des to me with ye presence of whome can not say whiche of my wyttes was moost vndertaken in myne he rynge in herkenynge of her worthy wordes where that my syght was in beholdynge her grete beaute her attyre her reuerent porte her ryght worshypfull countenaunce the same wyse of the others and wyst not whiche of them to beholde for soo moche these thre ladyes resembled eyther other that of payne myght knowe that one from that other but that sholde haue ben deceyued.
And she of the lesse auctoryte than that other had her chere so fyerse that whome her eyen behelde was not so hardy but that he sholde be vndertaken with grete drede.
Soo was before them standynge vp from my syege for theyr reuerence beholdynge them without faynynge of ony worde as that persone that was so ouertaken coude not sowne a worde.
And had grete meruayle in my herte thynkynge who they myght be and ryght gladly yf had durste wolde haue asked theyr names and theyr beynge and what was the sygnyfyenge of dyfferent septres yt eche of them helde in theyr ryght handes whiche were of ryght grete rychesse and they were co me thyder yet when had thought me not worthy to reason with them in suche demaundes soo hyghe ladyes as they appered vnto me durst in no manere but contynued my syght vpon theym halfe aferde halfe assured by the wordes that had herde them saye whiche hathe cast me out of my fyrst thought yet that ryght wyse lady yt had reasoned with me whiche knewe my thought in spyryte as she that hath syght in all thynges answered to my thought saynge thus.
Dere dough ter knowe ye that the prouydence of god that nothynge leueth vayne ne cometh not vs to estable thoughe that we knowe celestyall thynges to be to haunte amonge the people of this bace worl de to yt entente to put in ordre to holde in equyte the stablementes made by ourselfe after the wyll of god in dyuers offyces to whiche god we thre ben doughters and of hym borne.
So it is myne offyce to redresse men and women when they are out of the waye to put them agayne in the ryght waye.
And come to the~ pryuely in spyryte all co and preche them them in shewynge theyr erroure and that in whiche they fayle assygne them the causes after teche theym manere to folowe that that is to do and howe they sholde flee that that is to be lefte.
And for yt serue to showe clerely and make to se in conscy ence theyr dedes to euery man and woman and theyr propre tatches and defautes thou feest me holde in stede of a septre this bryght glasse or myroure that bere in my ryght hande knowe this for trouthe that there is no persone that loketh in this myroure but he maye knowe euery creature what he is clerely.
my myroure it is of so grete dygnyte that it is not without grete cause that he is so enuyronned of so ryche precyous stones as thou seest it.
For by hym these beynges qualytees proporcyon measures of al thynges ben know ne ne without hym may nothynge be well made nor done for yt that thou desyrest to knowe also the offyces of myne other two systers yt thou seest here to that entente that the wytnessynge of vs may be to the more certayne eche of them in theyr owne persone shall answere of theyr name and of theyr propryete yet the cause and the mouynge of our comynge shall be declared by me ryght here make the to vnderstande that as there shall be done nothynge without good cause our apperyn ge is nothynge here in vayne.
For thoughe that we be not comunely in many places and that the knowlege of vs cometh not vnto all people.
Neuerthelesse for the grete loue the whiche thou haste for to enquyre after thynges by veray longe and contynuall studye by the whiche thou doest yelde thyselfe here solytarye and thou withdraw est the out of the worlde thou haste deserued and thou deseruest to be vysyted and to be comforted of vs in thy trouble sorowe as ryght a dere frende that thou be made clerely seynge those thynges that defoule trouble thy courage in the derkenesse of thought.
Also there is a gretter cause of our comynge and a more specyal that thou shalte knowe by our reuelacyon so vnderstande to that entente that this erroure myght be destroyed we wolde that these ladyes and all worshypfull women myght haue from hens forthe some manere of place to come to or a cloystre of defence agaynst all those that wolde assayle them.
For the defaute of whiche all these foresayd ladyes and famous women haue longe tyme be lefte vnclosed as a felde without hedge without fyndynge of ony champyon that for theyr defence myght compare suffycyently.
Notwithstandynge these noble men that by ordenaunce of ryght ought to defende theym whiche by neglygence and no force hathe suffred them to be defouled by ye whiche it is no meruayl thoughe theyr enuyous enemyes the outrage of vylaynes assaylled them by dyuers craftes and haue had ye vyctory agaynst them in theyr warre for defaute of defence where is yt cyte so stronge yt myght not sone be taken yf there be not founde resystence.
Nor so vniuste a cause but it myght be goten by co~tynuaunce of hym yt pledeth wtout party ryght so these symple debonayre ladyes to ye ensample of pacyence whiche god co~mau~deth hath suffred frendely these grete iniuryes yt so moche by ye mouthe of so many theyr ha~des wrytynge haue suffred so moche wronge thus they reporte them to god of theyr good ryght yet nowe it is tyme that theyr Iuste cause be put out of ye handes of Pharao.
And therfore bytwene vs thre ladyes yt thou seest here moued by pyte we be come to tell the of a certayne buyldynge made in the manere of a cloystre of a Cyte strongely wrought by masons handes well buylded whiche is predestynate to the for to make and to stable it by our helpe and counsayle in the whiche shall none enhabyte but onely ladyes of good fame and women worthy of praysynges.
For to them where vertue shall not be founde the walles of our Cyte shall be strongely shytte.
Xp~ine telleth howe the lady deuyfed to her the Cyte that was commytted to her to make and yt she was stabled to helpe her to begyn the walles and the cloystre aboute and after tolde her her name.
THus fayre doughter yt prerogatyue is gyuen to the amonge al other women to make and fortefye the Cyte of ladyes for the whiche thou shalte take vpon the to make the foundement and parfytely conclude hym.
And thou shal te receyue of vs thre wyne and water as of a clere welle.
And we shall delyuer to the mater ynoughe more stronger more durable than ony marbre and as for Cyment there shal be no better tha~ thou shalte haue.
So shall thy Cyte be ryght fay re without pere and of perpetuall durynge to the worlde.
Haste yu not redde yt the kynge Troys founded the grete cyte of Troye by ye helpe of Appolo Mynerue and Neptune whiche the people at that tyme trowed theym as goddes.
And also howe Cadmus founded the cyte of Thebes by ye mynestracyon of goddes.
And for al that those cy tees by space of tyme were ouerthrowne and ben tourned in to ruyne.
But prophecye to the as verray Sybylle that neuer this cyte whiche thou shalte founde shall be brought to nought ne shall not fall but alway endure in prosperyte maulgre all his enuyous enemyes thoughe that he be fou ght withall by many dyuers assaultes so she shal neuer be taken ne ouercome.
Somtyme ye royalme of Amosonye was begonne by ye ordynaun ce entrepryse of dyuers women of grete courage whiche despysed bondage so as the hystoryes bereth wytnesse.
And longe tyme by them it was mayntayned vnder sygnyouryes of dyuers quenes ryght noble ladyes ye whiche they chose them selfe gouerned ryght fayre and well and by gre te strengthe maynteyned the lordshyp and neuer thelesse thoughe they were of grete myght puyssaunce that in the tyme of theyr domynacyon conquered grete parte of the oryent all the landes nyghe them put them in drede in the same wyse the countre of Grece doubted them whiche that tyme was foure of all countrees of worlde and not for yt within processe of tyme the puyssaunce of the royalme by the same manere as it is of all other worldely lordshyppes there is not by den in this tyme as nowe but onely ye same.
But this cyte shal be of moche more stronger buyldyn ge that thou hast to make for ye whiche to begyn am commytted by ye delyberacyon amonge vs all thre ladyes togyder to delyuer the morter durable and without corrupcyon to make the stron foundementes and the grete walles all aboute.
And to lyfte vp the hyghe large and grete towres and stronge castelles dyked bastyled and barred as moche as it perteyneth to a cyte of grete defen ce and by our deuyse thou shalte set it in grete dep nesse to endure the longer and after thou shalte lyfte vp the walles so hyghe yt all the worlde shal drede them.
Doughter thus haue nowe tolde ye the causes of our comynge to ye entente yt thou take the more credence to my sayenge.
Nowe wyll yt thou lerne my name by the sowne of yt whi che onely thou shalte knowe yt thou hast in me if wylte folowe myne ordynau~ces a mynystresse in thy nede to do ytyu myght not yestereuen.
am na med dame Reason nowe aduyse ye then yf yu be in good conduyte so say no more to ye at this tyme Here Xp~ine telleth howe the seconde lady tolde her her name and wherof she serued and howe she sholde helpe her to make the masonry of the cy te of Ladyes.
Ca. v. WHan the lady aboue sayd had accheued her worde or that had laysoure to answere.
The seconde lady began to answere in this manere am called ryghtwysnesse whiche hathe my dwellynge more in heuen than in erthe.
But as a sone beme a lyghtnynge or a shynynge or god messangere of his goodnesse haunte amonge the Iuste persones and counsayle them to do all thynge well and to yelde to euery man that that is his and after to say and sustayne trouthe to be re the ryght of the poore people and Innocentes to greue others by vsurpacyon sustayne the renowne of them that ben accused without cause.
am the shelde and defence of the seruauntes of god call on the punycyon of euyll folkes make to gyue and alowe to the trauayllers and rewarde the good doers and god maketh open his secretes by me to his frendes.
This shynynge lyne yt thou seest me holde in stede of a Septre in my ryght hande is ryght rewle departeth the ryght from the wronge and it sheweth the dyfference bytwene good euyll who so foloweth it shall not goo out of the waye.
This is the staffe of peas that reconsyleth the good.
And where vpon they lene them he smyteth and beteth the euyl doers what sholde more saye to the.
By this lyne all thynges are lymytted and the dygnytees of hym ben infynyte.
Soo vnderstande that he shall serue the wel and thou shalte haue nede of hym to measure the buyldynge of the cyte that is commytted to the to make of the sayd Cyte to make the stone werke and to make within the hyghe towres and the hyghe pa layces to compace the housynge and all the mansyons the stretes and places and all thynges couenables to helpe the and to put suffycyent people within the foresayd Cyte thus am come in thyne helpe with my syster Reason and this noble lady whiche thou seest here.
Nowe dysmaye thou not of the grete largenesse and longe cyrcuyte of the closynge of the walle.
For by the helpe of god and of vs thou shalte buylde it and people it ryght well and fayre without leuynge of ony voyde thynge wt fayre mansyons and stronge herbegages Here Xp~ine telleth howe the thyrde lady tolde her what she was and wherfore she serued and howe she wolde helpe her to make the hyghe bataylmentes of the towres of her Cyte and to people it with noble ladyes.
AFter this spake the thyrde lady whiche sayd ryght thus.
am Iustyce the synguler doughter of god and my beynge procedeth purely of his propre persone.
My dwellynge is in heuen in erthe and in helle.
In heuen for the glorye of sayntes and of blessyd soules In erthe for to departe gyue euery man his porcyon other of good or of euyll as he hathe deserued.
In helle for the punycyon of euyl people bowe not to no parte.
For there is no frende no fere of grete wyl pyte nor prayer thretnynge nor cruelte that moueth me.
Myne offyce is onely for to Iuge departe to make payment after euery mannes ryghtfull deseruynge.
susteyne all thynges in estate and without me there may no thynge be stablysshed am in god and god is in me we be as one selfe thynge.
teche to euery man woma~ holsome vnderstandynge yf he byleue me teche hym to chastyce to knowe to reproue hymselfe fyrst to do to another yt that he wolde sholde be done to hym to departe thynges without fauoure to saye trouthe to fle hate lesynges and to put away all vycyous thynges.
This vessell of fyne golde yt thou seest in my ryght hande made after ye guyse of a rounde measure god my fader gaue it me it serueth to measure to euery man his lyueray of suche meryte as he ought to haue.
It is marked with ye floure deluce of the Trynyte and he yelded hym Iuste to porcyons there maye noo man complayne of my measure.
But these men of the worlde haue other measures whiche they saye dependeth and come th of myne.
But falsely they measure often tymes vnder shadowe of me and there theyr measure is not alwaye Iuste other it is to large to some or to lytel to some others.
myght holde longe tale ynoughe of the propryetees of myne offyce.
But shortly for to say am an especyall amonge other vertues for al they referre them to me.
And amonge vs. iij. ladyes that thou seest here we be as one selfe thynge and we may none of vs do without other.
And that the fyrst dysposeth the seconde ordeyneth and putteth it to werke.
And then that am the thyrde perfourmeth it and bryngeth it to ende.
Thus am stabled to helpe the by the wyll of vs thre perfytely to make thy Cyte.
And myne offyce shall be to make ye hyghe roffes of thy towres of the mansyons and of the herbegages whiche shall be of fyne golde shynynge bryght.
And shall people it of ryght worthy ladyes they shal be suche that shall haue the prerogatyue and the honoure amonge these other women as ye moost excellences.
And there shall yelde the by thyne owne helpe parfyte fortefyenge and closynge of stronge gates the whiche shall go seke in heuen and shall delyuer vnto the the keyes with myne owne handes.
Here Xp~ine telleth howe she spake to to the. iij. ladyes.
THese wordes abouesayd ended whiche had herkened by grete entente of these.
iij. ladyes whiche had drawne fro me entyerly the dyspleasaunce that had before theyr comynge Sodaynly fell downe at theyr feete not onely on knees but all flatte for theyr grete excellence kyssynge erthe aboute theyr feete worshyppynge theym as goddesses.
lady of souerayne dygnyte Lanternesse of heuen gyuynge ly ght to all the erthe welles of paradyse the Ioy of them that ben blessyd wherof is come to your hyghnesse suche humylyte that ye haue vouched saufe to come frome your hyghe syeges and shynynge trones in to the troubled tabernacle dar ke of a symple and an ygnoraunt studye whiche maye not yelde couenable thankynges to suche a benefyce whiche haue by the rayne of the dewe of your swete wordes fallen vpon me departed tempered the drynesse of myne vnderstandynge so it feleth hym nowe redy to burgyn put out newe plantes dysposed to bere fruyte of profytable vertue and delectable smellynge howe shal it be done in me suche grace that shall receyue the gyfte after your worde to make fortefye nowe ryght in this worlde suche a newe cyte.
am not saynt Thomas the appostle that made by deuyne grace in heuen a ryche palays to kynge of ynde? Nor my feble wytte can not ne knoweth not the crafte ne measures ne the studye nor the pratyke of buyldynge and yf these thynges by possybylyte of connynge were nowe in myne vndersta~dynge where sholde be taken suffycyent strengthe in my womans body to put so grete a thynge to werke yet neuertheles my ryght redoubted ladyes howe be it yt the meruayllynge of these newe tydynges be straunge to me knowe well there is nothynge impossyble as to god and ought not doubte that what thynges euer be taken on hande by the counsayle and helpe of you thre but that they be wel and fayre ended.
Thus worshyp ped be god with al my power and you my ladyes that so moche haue worshypped me that am sta bled to so noble a commyssyon whiche receyue with grete gladnesse.
Here Xp~ine telleth howe by the commaundement of dame Reason she began to dygge the erthe to make the foundement.
Nowe ryse doughter without more abydynge go we in to the felde of scryptures there shall be lou~ ded the Cyte of Ladyes in a playne countre and fruytefull there where all fruytes swete waters ben founde and where the grounde haboundeth of all good thynges.
Take the py coys of thyne vnderstandynge and dygge strong ly make a grete dyke aboute where thou seest trace of my lyne.
And shall helpe the to bere out erthe vpon myne owne sholders.
And then for to obeye to theyr commau~demente dressed me lyghtly felynge my selfe by vertue of them more stronge and more lyght than was before.
So she wente before and after and we came in to the foresayd felde began to dyke and dygge af ter her sygne with the picoys of inquisycyon and my fyrst worke was done in this wyse.
Madame me thynketh well that ye haue sayd to me before applyenge to the purpose of yt yt many me~ haue so moche blamed and blameth generally condycions of women that the golde the more it is in the fornayce the more it fyneth hym whiche is to vnderstonde that the more they be blamed wrongfully the more encreaseth theyr meryte of theyr praysynge yet pray you tell me wherfore it is and whens cometh cause that so many dyuers auctours haue spoken agaynst the~ in theyr bokes syth that fele nowe that it is of wronge whether that nature enclyne them or yf they doo it for hate and whens ryseth the cause.
Doughter for to gyue the waye to goo in more deper shall here out this fyrst to be borne out.
Knowe that it cometh not of nature but it is all contrary.
For there is in worl de no man so grete ne so stronge as he is of gre te loue that nature by the wyll of god putteth by twene man and woman.
But the causes ben dyuers indyfferent yt hath moued moueth many dyuers men to blame women and the same wyse auctours in theyr bokes as thou hast fou~de For some haue done it in god entente that is to knowe for to drawe agayne these men that be out of the waye by the hauntynge of dyuers wo men that ben vycyous and lyght wherof they be assotted other to kepe them yt they be not assotted to the entente euery man sholde fle lyfe is lecherous foule they haue blamed all women generally for theyr trowynge to do of al abhomy nacyons.
Madame sayd then pardon me yf yelde you here your worde then haue they done well syth good entente hathe moued them.
For it is sayd that the entente Iugeth the man.
For ygnoraun ce maketh not one to excuse hym yf he siewe a ma~ in good entente by his folysshe trowynge then sholde it be well done yet what so euer they be as in that they haue vsed of euyll ryght.
For why to do greuaunce preiudyce to one partye to trowe to socoure another it is no ryght and to blame al condycyons of women to contrary of trouthe so as shal shewe by experyence.
Notwithstan dynge they sholde do it in entente to withdrawe these foles from folye also yt yf blame the fyre whiche is ryght a good element ryght necessary bycause yt some men were brente therin.
And al so water for some me~ ben drowned in it the same wyse yf one sholde saye of all good thynges whiche a ma~ may vse bothe wel euyll no ma~ ou ght to blame them thoughe these foles abuse the~.
And these poyntes y~ haste touched thyselfe in thy sayinges yet they yt so hath spoken habundauntly what so euer was theyr entente they haue taken theyr purpose vpon the large onely to come to theyr entente so as he dothe yt maketh hym to cutte a longe and a large gowne of a pece of cloth that cost hym nought and no man saythe the con trary so he taketh and graunteth the ryght of ano ther to his vsage yet as thou haste sayd other tymes ynowe.
If thou sholde haue sought the way es to withdrawe these men from folye and to kepe them that they laboure not in vayne to blame the lyfe and the condycyons of theym the whiche sheweth them vycyous and lyght as there is nothyng in ye worlde yt maketh one more to fle to say the ryght trouthe as dothe a shrewde woman ly ght and cursed as it showeth whiche is a thynge counterfayte out of her propre condycyon natu rall whiche ought to be symple pryuy and honest consente well that they sholde haue buylded so ueraynely a good and fayre worke but to blame all where there ben so many ryght excellent pro myse that it came neuer of me but that they fayled and fayle gretely and al they foloweth them So cast out these foule stones ragged and blacke out of thy werke for they shall neuer serue ne shal not be put good buyldynge of thy cyte.
Other men haue blamed women for other causes for to some it is come of theyr owne vyces and some be moued for ye defaute of theyr owne ladyes others for pure enuye some others for delectacyon that of theyr propre condycyon hath to saye shrewdely Other for to showe that they haue sene ynoughe of scrypture and so they grounded them on that they haue founde in bokes speketh after those others and aledge them for auctours.
Those the whiche it is come of theyr propre vyces ben men that haue vsed theyr youthe in the dyssolute lyfe habou~ded them in many dyuers loues of dyuers women.
Thus they are borne vp by dyuers causes whiche taketh no hede of themselfe waxeth olde in theyr synnes without repentaunce yet ta ke they sorowe to theyr passed folyes dyssolute lyfe that they haue ledde in theyr tyme.
For nature is waxed colde in them whiche suffreth theym not to put theyr courage to effecte after theyr wyl that ye appetyte wolde without puyssaunce.
So they haue sorowe when they se that ye lyfe yt they were wonte to calle theyr good tyme is faylled from them that the yonge men yt ben nowe haue the tyme as they were wonte to haue.
Thus they knowe not howe to put away theyr sorowe but to blame wome~ by theyr trowynge to do dys pleasaunce to others.
And one saythe communely suche olde men speke foule and dyshonestly soo as thou mayst se them and properly of Matheolus whiche confesseth hymselfe that he was olde full of wyll and no power thou mayst proue it true by hym that haue sayd to the.
And byleue it stably that it is in the same wyse of others but these olde men thus defouled whiche be as ye lyfe and ye same wyse by his horryble shrewdenesse he wolde make them to dysplease to be hated of al men.
So he was alowed after his meryte for by the deseruynge of his cursed vyce he was brente in the fyre ryght dyshonestly.
Another lytell bo ke in latyne sawe also madame yt nameth hym the secrete of women whiche speketh of ye makyn ge of theyr bodyes naturall many grete defautes Answere.
Thou mayst knowe by thyselfe with out ony other proue yt that boke was made at vo lentees fayntly coloured as thou hast redde whi che is an open thynge to the yt it is drawne all of lesynges thoughe yt some men saye that it was arystotyll that is not to byleue that suche a phylo sophre was so charged with so false tales.
For by that that these women maye clerely proue kno we that some thynges yt he toucheth be not true but verye fables thus they may conclude yt these maters that he treateth of be very lesynges.
But remembrest it not that he saythe at his begynnynge yt wote not what pope cursed euery man that sholde rede it to ony woman or take it them to rede.
Than kno west not thou the malycyous cause wherfore this Iape was gyuen to be byleued of bestyall men nyce at the begynnynge of yt boke.
It was to yt entente yt women sholde not haue no knowlege of that boke nor of that co~teyned in hym.
For he yt made it knewe wel that yf they redde it or herde it redde yt they sholde knowe well yt it was but tryfles so they sholde ha ue spoken ayenst hym mocked hym.
Thus wol de auctoure yt made it mocke begyle men yt sholde rede it by this way.
Madame am reme~bred yt amonge these other thynges yt he hath sayd whe~ he hath spoken yn oughe of ye impotence im{per}feccyon feblenes whiche is cause of myss hapynge of womans body in ye wombe of ye moder yt nature is ashamed when she sawe yt she had four med suche a body as a thynge imperfyte.
Ha the grete foly swete frende the grete blyndnesse out of all reason yt moueth or styreth ony man to say it howe nature whiche is ye chambryere of god is she more maystres tha~ her mayster almyghty god whiche had ye shap of man woman in his thought when it came to his wyll to fourme Ada~ of ye of ye erthe in the felde of Damas when he had made hym he brought hym in to paradyse ter restre whiche was is the worthyest place of this lowe worlde there Adam slepte of one of his Rybbes to yt entente yt he sholde loue woman as his owne fless he fourmed ye body of woman so the moost souerayne werkeman had no shame to make fourme the body of woma~ and sholde na ture be ashamed therof.
Ha ye grete some of folyes to saye yt it is trewe and howe was she four med wote not yf notest it she was fourmed af ter the ymage of god.
howe durste the mouthe say so euyl of so noble a prynte but some be so gre te foles yt they trowe when they here say that god made man after his ymage it be to say of materyall body.
But it is not so for god had not then taken the body of man but it is to vnderstande of the soule whiche is a spyryte vnderstandynge the whiche shal endure wtout ende to lykenes of the deite whiche soule god made put as good as worthy all euen to the body of woman as of man.
But yet as to the makynge of the body the woman was made of the moost souerayne werke man and in what place was she made In paradyse terrestre wherof came the foule matere she was made of.
Nay it was of the moost noble matere that euer was made that was of the body that god made.
Madame after that that fele of you woma~ is ryght a noble thynge.
But yet Tullyus sayth a man sholde neuer serue a woman and he that dothe it defouleth hymselfe for none ought to serue that that is lower than hym selfe.
He is happy that serueth vyrgyne that is aboue al the aungelles and he or she that is moost hyghe ought to serue her in whom all vertue haboundeth.
Also madame one of the Cathons sayth whiche that was a grete clerke yf worlde had ben without we sholde haue ben conuersannt with goddes.
Nowe mayst thou well se the foly of hym that men helde so sage.
For by encheson of woman men reygne th with god.
And yf ony wolde saye man by woman by the cause of dame saye yt he hathe goten more hyghe degre by lady Mary than he lost by Eue in so moche yt the manhode is Ioyned to godhede that had not ben yf the trespace of Eue had not ben.
So bothe man and woma~ ought to lyfte vp themselfe from that defaute he that worshyppeth woman wor shyppeth hymselfe.
For of so moche as mannes nature fell more lower by suche a creature as wo man by woman she is lyfte vp agayne more hygher to be conuersaunt with goddes as Caton sayth yf woma~ had not be he sayd more truer tha~ he wende for he was a paynyme amo~ge the~ of yt lawe they vnderstode as well goddes to be in helle as in heuen yt is to knowe the deuylles whi che they called theyr goddes of helle.
So it is no Iape that men sholde haue ben co~uersaunt with those goddes yf our lady Mary had not ben.
Capitulo. x. ALso the same Caton sayth yet that the woman yt pleaseth a man naturally re sembleth the rose whiche is pleasaunt to se but ye thorne is vnder prycketh Answere.
For euery good ho nest woman of good lyfe ought to be is one of the pleasauntest thynges yt is to se.
And alwayes there is the thorne of drede to do amysse a compu~ccyon in her courage whiche yt parteth not fro her.
And yt maketh her to holde her pryue sytteth styll that is it yt kepeth her.
Many auctours bereth wytnesse madame yt women ben by nature synful.
Doughter thou hast herde speke of a pro uerbe that sayth that yt nature gyueth may not be taken away.
So it sholde be to grete a meruayle yf they sholde be so enclyned to synne naturally.
For the women yt loueth her worshyp nature styreth them neuer to come in suche places where as yt synne that is sayd of them is vsed as in tauernes other places to yt or for that ordeyned yf ony man wolde answere saye yt shame kepeth them say yt is not true.
For it is another thynge that kepeth them whiche is theyr naturall condy cyon whiche is not so enclyned therto.
And put case that they were so enclyned that shame gaue them suche resystence contrary to theyr naturall inclynacyon that yt vertue and constaunce sholde tourne them to grete worshyp praysynge.
And to yt purpose remembrest thou not that not longe ago that as thou were in a festfull day at the gate of thyne house deuysynge one other with a wor shypfull damoysell thy neyghboure.
And yu sawest a man come out of a tauerne yt wente talkynge wt another sayenge haue spente thus moche at tauerne my wyfe shall drynke no wyne to nyght.
And then thou called hym to the and asked cause why and he sayd to the.
For she hathe suche a condycyon that euery tyme that come from the tauerne she asketh me howe moche haue spente yf it be more tha~ xij. pens she wyll recompence me by the sobernes of her mouthe that yt haue spente to moche sayth yt yf we bothe sholde spende so largely oure crafte sholde not tournysshe vs to our dyspence.
Thou mayst knowe by ensamples ynowe by nature women ben sobre those yt be not they go out of kynde for there may not be a more lewder vyce in a woma than ny for yt vyce draweth to hym many other vyces But mayst well se of them grete companyes grete prese in theyr chyrches at sermons at pardons holdynge theyr beedes in theyr handes say enge theyr prayers.
Madame sayd yt is trouthe But these men say yt they go fresshe Ioly to showe theyr beaute to drawe these me~ to theyr loue Answere.
That sholde be a thynge for byleue dere frende yf one sawe none there but yonge women fresshe· but shalte se there for one yon ge woma~. xx. or. xxx. olde of symple habyte to go haunte ye places of deuocyon.
And yf deuocyon be amonge women it sholde folowe in same wyse yt charyte fauteth not there for they vysyte syke comforte the~ they renne to pore people che th hospytalles bury deed bodyes.
Me semeth yt these be werkes of wome~ whiche ben rayne traces yt god co~mau~deth vs to folowe.
Ma dame ye say wel but there is an auctour sayth yt wome~ by nature haue yll courage be as chyldre~ And for that cause chyldren ben co~uersaunt with them they with the chyldren.
Dou ghter yf thou take hede to nature of a chylde of his condycyon he loueth frendlynesse swetnes And what thynge is there in worlde more swet ter more amyable than is a woman well set in ordre.
Ha the cursed people of the deuylles condy cyon that wolde haue the welthe vertue of mekenesse and benygnyte that is in women tourne to euyll in to reproffe.
For thoughe women loue chyldren it cometh not of them by vyce of ygno raunce but it cometh of the swetnesse of theyr co~dycyon and yf they be as chyldren in benygnyte of that in that they be well counsaylled.
Ne sayd not our lorde to his appostles when they stryued amonge theym whiche sholde be moost grete he called a chylde and layde his hande on his heed and sayd.
saye you certaynly that he that wyl holde hym lytell meke as a chylde shal be moost hye.
For who that meketh hym shall be enhaunced and he enhaun ceth hym shall be put lowe.
Madame men dothe me grete hurte of one prouerbe in latyne they re proue women by often tymes whiche sayth wepe speke and spynne god hath put in woman.
Forsothe swete frende that worde is true howe be it that he trowed or sayd in reproue it was for them a good happe whiche by spekynge wepynge spynnynge haue ben saued thus god put in them suche condycyons.
And agaynst them that so moche reproueth them in the condyon of wepynge.
saye yf that our sauyour Ihesu cryst to whome no thought is hydde and whiche seeth euery courage had knowen that teeres of women had come onely of fragylyte and symplenesse the dygnyte of his grete hyghnesse had not ben so enclyned to yelde hymselfe teeres of eyen of his worshypfull gloryons body by compassy on when he sawe Mary Magdaleyne her syster wepe for dethe of theyr broder Lazare whiche he raysed from the dethe.
howe many grete graces god hath done to women bycause of theyr teeres.
He dyspraysed not the teeres of the foresayd Mary Magdaleyne but accepted them in so moche that he pardoned her of her synnes by the merytes of them she is in heuen gloryously Also he put not awaye those teeres of wydowe whiche wepte for her deed sone one bare to the erthe.
And our lorde whiche is welle of all pyte moued of compassyon for the teeres of her wente to aske her wherfore wepest thou and then ano ne he raysed the chylde to lyfe.
Other grete graces whiche sholde be longe to telle god hathe done to many women for theyr wepynge alwaye dothe. wherfore suppose that bycause of theyr wepynge and theyr deuocyon many of them ben saued others also whiche they pray for.
Ne was not saynt Austyne gloryous doctoure of chyrche conuerted to the fayth bycause of wepynge of his moder.
For that same good lady wepte with out seasynge praynge to god it myght please hy~ to enlumyne the herte of her sone whiche was at tyme a paynyme out of byleue from lyght of faythe. wherfore this good lady wente often tymes to requyre saynt Ambrose he sholde pray to god for hym then my lady Reason sayd to me suppose sayd she it sholde be a thynge impossy ble so many teeres of a woma~ sholde be lost.
blessyd saynt Ambrose thou trowed not so many teeres of a woma~ sholde be set at nought and that may be answere to men reproue women bycause of theyr wepynge of a woman is holy lyght in the fronte of holy chyrche whiche clereth enlumyneth all the chyrche.
The same wyse truely god put the spekynge in woman worshypped be he.
For yf speche had not ben put in theym they had ben dome yet contrary to that the prouerbe whiche knowe not who made it at his pleasure in the reproffe of women yf language of woman had ben so mo che reprouable of so lytell auctoryte as some me~ wolde saye our lorde Ihesu Cryst had neuer vou ched saufe so worshypfull a mystery as was of his gloryous resurreccyon whiche was fyrst announced by woma~ as he hymselfe commaunded to the blessyd Mary Magdaleyne to whome he appered fyrst on Ester day that she sholde tell it a~nounce it to his dyscyples to Peter.
blessyd lorde Ihesu loued be thou whiche with other infy nyte gyftes graces thou hast done gyuen to woman kynde woldest that woman sholde be berer of so hyghe worshypfull tydynges wel ou ght these enuyous men to be styll yf they aduyse them well.
It was a good happe the woma~ of Cananee was so grete a speker whiche dyde nou ght elles but crye after our lorde Ihesu Cryst goynge by the stretes of Iherusalem sayenge.
Haue mercy on me lorde for my doughter is syke.
But what dyde our lorde god he in whom al mercy ha bounded haboundeth and to whom it suffysed one onely worde comynge from the herte to haue mercy.
It semed he delyted in many wordes of mouthe of woman alway perseueraunt in her prayer but wherfore dyde he it It was to proue her stedfastnesse.
For when he herde her lyken her selfe to dogges that semed a lytell rudely for she was of a straunge lawe and not of goddes lawe She had no shame to speke well wysely in sayenge.
Lorde it is true the lytell dogges eteth crommes that falleth from table of theyr lorde.
ryght wyse woman who hathe tought the to speke so.
Thou gatest thy cause by thy language yssued of good wyll and well it semed.
For oure lorde bare wytnesse of his owne mouthe retournynge than vnto his appostles sayenge to that he had not founde suche fayth in Israell and graunted vnto her request and desyre.
Ha who maye somme suffysauntly the worshyp in kynde of woman the whiche the enuyous men wyll so dysprayse consyderynge that in the herte of a ly+tell woman of the kynred of paynymes· god fou~de more faythe than in all the bysshoppes prynces or preestes or in the people of Iewes called the~selfe the worthy people of god.
In suche a ma+nere spake also longly wt grete pleatynge wel for her the woman Samarytane that was come to drawe of the water where she founde Ihesu cryst syttynge all wery.
Howe myght thou suffre thy holy mouthe to open and to holde the rayne of wordes of helthe to this poore lytel woman synner ye whiche was not of that lawe.
Truely thou shewed well yt thou dysdayned not ye deuoute kynde of women.
Ne spake not wysely the woman yt sate at the sermone of our lorde Ihesu Cryste whiche was so embraced with his holy wordes so as one saythe yt women may not byleue so soone yet she spake at yt tyme then she rose with a grete wyll sayd.
Blessyd be yt wombe that bare the the pappes that thou sowked.
Thus thou mayst vnderstande fayre swete fre~+de that god hathe shewed yt truely he loueth language to be well serued.
So that ought not to be reproffe to them wherof so moche welthe cometh and so lytell euyll for no man seeth grete preiudyce come of theyr language.
And as to spynne truely it is goddes wyll yt it be kyndely to them.
For that offyce is necessary to goddes seruyce to ye helpe of euery creature reasonable without the whiche worke the offyces of the worlde sholde be maynteyned in grete foulenesse and vnclen nesse.
So it is grete shredenesse to put that in to reproffe of woman that ought to tourne them to grete honoure and praysynge.
Xp~ine demaundeth of Reason wherfore it is that women sytteth not in the syege of pleadynge Capitulo. xj. RIght hyghe and worshypfull lady your fayre reasons satysfyeth ryght gretely my thought.
But yet tell me yf it please you the trouthe wherfore is that yt these women holde noo pleadynge in the courte of Iustyce nor they knowe not of the causes ne dothe no Iugement.
For these men saye yt it is for they can not that woman yt sytteth in ye place of Iustyce gouerneth her shrewdely.
Doughter these ben but Iapes thyn ges contryued of that one lyst to say of women But he that wolde demaunde the causes and rea sons of al thynges it sholde be to moche to answe re. Howe be it that Arystotle in in his boke of pro blemes yeldeth reason of many thynges in the same wyse in the boke of propryetees of thynges ben conteyned ye beynges of dyuers accyons naturalles.
But as to yt fayre frende the same wyse yf it be demaunded why god ordeyned not these men sholde do ye offyces of women the women the offyces of men.
But answere is this ye as a wyse well ordeyned stablyssheth his meyne to do dyueuers offyces one one thynge another another thynge as so that yt one dothe another do the not.
The same wyse god hath ordeyned man woman to serue also to helpe comforte hol de company one with another euery of them in he is ordeyned to do hathe gyuen to euery kynde suche nature inclynacyon as to do his offyce competently perteynynge to hym howe be it that mannes nature abuseth often tymes in yt that he ought to do.
He hath gyuen to men body stronge power and hardy to go come speke and for ye these men that haue yt nature lerneth the lawes ought to put them in execucyon to holde ye worlde in the ordre of Iustyce.
And they be bounde yt in case yt ony wolde not obey to ye lawes establed by ryght reason yt they sholde make them to obeye by force of theyr bodyes and by puyssaunce of armes that the women may not do.
For howe be it that god hath gyuen them vnderstandynge yet they may not vse it in yt manere for theyr honeste.
For it were not conuenyent that they sholde goo sewe them in Iugement as these men done.
For there ben ynowe dothe it for what nedeth thre men to lyfte vp a fardell yt twayne may lyghtly be re it away yet yf some men wolde saye yt women haue not suffycyent vnderstandynge for to lerne the lawes the contrary is made open by experyence and it appereth of many women as it shall be sayd here after ye whiche haue ben ryght grete phylosophres haue lerned more subtyll scyence and more hygher than the lawes wryten by men.
And also who wolde purpose that they haue not naturall wytte in dede of polycye of gouernau~ce.
gyue ye ensample of many grete may stresses that haue ben in tyme past also in thy tyme to entente thou sholdest knowe the better my trou the of them that haue ben wydowes whiche haue kepte good gouernaunce in all theyr doynges af ter the dethe of theyr housbandes whiche gyueth open experyence yt a woman that hath vnderstan dynge is couenable in all thynges.
Here it speketh of ye Empresse Nyehole after of dyuers noble quenes and pryncesses of Fraun ce. Capitulo. xij.
TEll me praye the where was euer that kynge of grete vnderstandynge in the dede of polycye of gouernaun ce to kepe souerayne Iustyce and al so of hyghe magnyfycence in lyuynge that is reode of the ryght noble Empresse Nychole.
For not withstandynge that in these countrees grete large dyuers that she had the rewle of had ben kynges of grete fame called Pharaons of whom she was descended.
This lady was she that fyrste began to lyue in her royalme after lawes worldely polycy she destroyed the rude maners of lyuynge of those countrees she had in gouernaunce.
And these auctours saye speke th of her that she amended rudenesse of her people.
And she was herytoure of the foresayd Pharaons not onely of lytell countre but of the roy alme of Arabee of Ethyope and of Egypte of Ile Maromye whiche is ryght longe and large and habundaunte of all manere of goodes whiche is closed with the flode of Nyle whiche she go uerned by meruayllous prudence what shall saye more of this lady whiche had all this welthe but that she was so wyse of suche gouernaunce holy scrypture speketh of her grete vertue.
She herselfe ordeyned lawes and ryghtes to gouerne her people.
She habounded in grete noblesse and rychesse more than ony man in those dayes she was profounde experte in scryptures in scyen ces.
And she had so hyghe a courage that she dysdeyned to be maryed ne wolde that no man sholde haue, knowlege of her body.
The quene of Fraunce Fredegonde that had ben wyfe of kynge Charles notwithstandynge she was cruell out of naturall lawe of woman after the dethe of her houfba~ de she gouerned the royalme of Fraunce by grete whiche was at that tyme in ryght grete balaunce.
For there was lefte her a sone without mo herytours of his fader the whiche was called so there was grete amonge the lordes bycause of gouernaunce vpon there fell grete warre to royalme yet this lady helde contynually her sone bytwene her armes.
And she called assembled theyr lordes in a counsayle sayd lordes so here your kynge ye haue not for goten the trouthe whiche alwayes hath ben in Fraunce and nowe dyspyse hym not thoughe he be a chylde for by helpe of god he shall encrease and when he shall come to age he shal knowe his good frendes and shall rewarde them after theyr desertes.
And as for me make you certayne that he shall rewarde them that well and truely maynteyneth hym that they shall be the better euer after.
And so this quene appeased lordes thrughe the whiche sadde gouernaunce she dyde so moche that she drewe her sone out of his enemyes handes and nourysshed hym herselfe tyl that he was of age and by her he gate the crowne and the wor shyppe of the royalme whiche had neuer ben done but by the grete prudence of her.
And in the same wyse one maye saye of the ryght wyse and in all cases good the noble quene Blaunche moder vnto Saynt Lowes whiche so nobly prudently gouerned of Frail ryll her sone were rype of age whiche was neuer better gouerned by man also whan he was come to his age by proffe of her wyse gouernan~ was alway thyefe of his and no thynge was done without her and also she sewed her alwaye in batayle and in warre other out nombre myght tell to this purpose whiche let passe for shortnesse of tyme yet syth we be entred to speke of ladyes of Fraunce without goyenge ferther to seke straunge storyes.
Thou sawest in thy tyme noble quene of Frau~ce Iane wedowe of kynge Charles the fourth yfthou ha ne it in mynde.
Aduyse the grete welthe that fame of this noble lady wytnesseth as moche in no table ordynaunce of her courte as in manere of ly uynge in souerayne Iustyce.
It was neuer spoken of prynce that maynteyned and kepte better in his londe was pertaynynge to hym tha~ this lady dyde.
And the noble lady that was wedded to the duke of Orlynaunce sone of kynge Phylyp resembled her wel the whiche in her wydo whode in the whiche she was longe tyme maynteyned Iustyce in her countre so ryghtfully that no man myght do better.
Also the quene of Frau~ce dame Blaunche whiche was wyfe to kynge Iohan maynteyned her londe and gouerned by grete ordre of ryght Iustyce.
And what myght one saye of the worshypfull and wyse lady the duchesse of Aniou some tyme doughter to the holy Charles de Bloys duke of Brytayne and after was wyfe to the yonger brother of kyng of Frau~ce.
The whiche duke was called syth kynge of how helde she vnder the rodde of Iustyce the londes countrees as well of Prouance as of other that she gouerned and helde in her honde for the ryght noble chyldren whyle they were yonge where was euer clamoure or playnte harde of wronge done that this noble lady sholde do.
In the same wyse the Cou~tesse de la marche lady countesse of Uandome of Castres whiche yet is on lyue what myght one saye of her gouernaunce wolde it not be knowne howe in what manere her styce was maynteyned she herselfe as a good wyse lady toke hede therto curyously.
And what sholde say more one myght say yn oughe of gre te ladyes meanes lesse in the same wyse howe they dyde that was perteynynge to them who so wyl take hede.
It semeth me that one myght se that these noble ladyes in theyr wydo whode haue susteyned suffycyently well kepte ryght in theyr lordeshyppes as theyr housbandes dyde that tyme lyuynge as well loued of theyr subiectes better.
For be it no doubte nor dyspleasaunce to men there ben many women haue better vnderstandynge than some of these men haue of the whiche yf theyr housbandes had byleued them that they had had suche vnderstandynge as they had it myght haue tourned theym to grete profyte yet thoughe these women communely medle them not of the dede of Iugement ne pronounce the causes of partyes it is to theym no force.
For by so moche they haue the lesse charge to theyr soules and to theyr bodyes.
And howe be it that it is a thynge necessary for to punysshe euyll doers and to do ryght vnto euery man there ben men ynowe suche offycers that they myght wyss he they had neuer knowne more than theyr moders.
For yf they go all the ryght waye god knoweth of the whiche if there be ony fraude theyr punycyon is not lytell.
CErtes madame ye say ryght wel and your reasons ben ryght well ge in my courage.
But yet thoughe it be so of theyr vnderstandynge is that proued that women haue feble bodyes tendre and not myghty in the dedes of strengthe and by nature they ben cowardes and this is one thynge that maketh moche lesse the degree and auctoryte of the kynde of woman by the Iugement of men.
For they wyll saye that in so moche as a body is more imperfyte in euery thynge so moche is it abredged and made lesse of his vertue.
And by that that thou folowest it it is lesse for to prayse.
Dere doughter thys folowynge is not good nor to be susteyned.
For without fayle one seeth often tymes when nature hathe restrayned ony thynge frome a body she hathe fourmed she rewardeth yt body in some other thynge of as moche valoure as thus.
If a woma~ be imparfyte of shap or of beaute or of im potencye or feblenes of membres it is sygne she recompenseth her with some other thynge that is more worth than yt she hath berafte her.
Ensample as it is sayd of the grete phylosophre Arystotle whiche was ryght lewde of shap one eye hygher than that other and of straunge vysage yet thoughe he had ony deformyte of body or of shap true ly nature recompensed hym ryght gretely in vnderstandynge retentyfe and felynge as it appereth by this antentyke wrytynges so yt recompensynge of so grete wytte was of more valoure tha~ thoughe he had a body lyke vnto Absolon.
In the same wyse one maye say of the grete Emperoure Alexandre yt was but lytell of body yet had he gre te vertue in his courage as it appered so it is by many others.
So promyse the fayre loue yt the grete stronge body causeth not the vertuous myghty courage but it cometh of a vertuous stre~ gethe maners yt is gyuen of god whiche graun teth to nature to leue to some creatures reasonables more tha~ to some others for it is a gyfte hyd in the vnderstandynge in courage not onely in the strengthe of body nor of membres thus we knowe often tymes by that grete men ynowe of stronge membres we se they be latches faylyn ge recrayed of others that haue ben lytell fe ble of body ben hardy full stronge the same wyse it is of other vertues but as to hardynes suche strengthe god nature hathe done ynoughe for women in that he hath gyuen them Im potencye.
For at leest they ben agreably excused by yt defaute in so moche yt they do not these horry ble crueltees wronges the grete greues extorcyons the whiche are done to worlde bycau se of strength so they shal not haue suche punyssh mentes as suche case requyreth it sholde haue ben ryght good for soules of man they myght haue passed the pylgrymage of this worlde in the feble body of woman.
And truely saye come agayne to my purpose yf nature had not gyuen grete strengthe of membres to a womans body she recompenseth her ryght well in that there is gyuen to her a more vertuous inclynacyon yt is to loue god to be dredefull naturally to do co~ trary to his commaundementes those that do otherwyse dothe out of kynde.
But alwayes aduyse the dere doughter howe it semeth god lyst to showe all degrees to men thoughe they say for as moche as wome~ haue not all so grete stren gthe hardynesse corporall as communely these men haue they ought not byleue it is for that that al bodely strengthe and hardynesse be shytte fro the kynde of woma~.
It appereth by that that in many women there is shewed grete courage strengthe hardynesse to vndertake all maner of stronge thynges to accheue them lyke as dyde these grete men conquerours of who~ there is made so grete mencyon in wrytynges as shall remembre here after by ensample.
Fayre doughter nowe haue ordeyned arayed for a pytte grete and large.
And haue borne out vpo~ my sholdres ryght grete burdens of rubrysshe of the erthe.
And it is tyme yt thou sette in these grete stronge stones for the foundement of walles of the cyte of Ladyes.
Nowe take thy truell thy plumbe wt thy lyne make redy to werke strong ly masonry by grete dylygence.
For se here a gre te and a large stone whiche wyll it be fyrste set in the foundement of thy cyte knowe it yt na ture herselfe hathe pourtrayed it by the sygnes of Astrologye for to be alowed in this werke.
Nowe drawe the a lytell abacke shall cast hym on.
Ca. xv. SEmyramys was a woman of ryght grete vertue in dede of grete vycto ryous courage in vndertakynge of entrepryses and in hauntynge of de des of armes the whiche was so excellent that the people there the whiche were pay nymes sayd that for the grete myght and strengthe that she hadde bothe vpon the lande and vpon the see that she was syster vnto the grete god Iupyter and doughter to the auncyent god Saturnus whiche they called the god of the lande of the see.
This lady was the wyfe of kynge Nynus yt named cyte of Nynyue of his name.
And he was so grete a couqueroure that by the helpe of his wyfe Semyramys whiche lykewyse as he rode alway with hym in harnoys he co~quered grete Babylone all the lande of Assyrye other countrees many.
It happened that the lady beyn ge yet ynoughe in yonge age Nynus her housba~ de was slayne with an arowe at the assaulte of a cyte yet when the obsequyes the solompnytees was couenably done of the foresayd kynge the la dy neuer lefte excercyse of armes but more than before by ryght grete courage toke vpo~ her to go uerne by strengthe the lordshyppes royalmes landes whiche her housbande she had conquered with the swerde whiche landes royalmes she kepte ryght notably by grete discyplyne of che ualrye.
So in suche manere she haunted and ac complysshed so many of notable werkes that no man in vygure and in strengthe surmounted her This lady in whom habounded ryght hardy cou rage ne doubted no payne ne was not aferde of no perylles but put herselfe to all thynges by suche excellence she ouercame all her aduersaryes had trowed to put her in her wydowhode out of all her co~questes.
By whiche she was so dredde doubted in armes yt she kepte not onely countres before conquered but wt a ryght grete armye wente vpon lande of Ethyope whiche she ouercame by grete strengthe put it vnder subieccyon Ioyned it to her Empyre.
From thens she wen te with a grete puyssaunce in to Inde and assayled strongly the men of Inde to whom there was neuer man approched to make them warre.
So she ouercame them and put them vnder her subieccyon syth she wente ferther vpon theyr coun trees so moche that to say shortly that she conque red all the oryent whiche is called the Eest parte of worlde whiche were ryght grete and myghty.
This Semyramys enforced made agaynst cyte of Babylone whiche was founded by Nem broche and the gyauntes and was set in the felde of Semyaar grete and of meruayllous strengthe and cyrcuyte and so this lady made it more stron ger of dyuers defenses and lete make aboute lar ge and depe dykes.
Semyramys was in a tyme in her chambre maydens aboute her her heed.
It happened that tydynges came one of her royalmes began to rebell agaynst her.
So she lyfted vp herselfe and sware by her puyssaunce that the other tresse of her heed sholde neuer be tressed whiche was vntressed tyll the tyme that she had venged her of that iniury and put agayne that londe in to her subieccyon.
So she made ne all her men to arme them in a grete multytude and wente vpon these rebelles by meruaylous strengthe put them vnder subieccyon thus they and all her other subiectes dradde her that neuer syth they durste not moue a fote to rebell.
Of the whiche noble dede and couragyous longe tyme after gaue wytnesse a grete ymage made of brasse gylte rychely lyfte vp vpon an hyghe pyller in Ba bylone whiche represented a pryncesse holdynge swerde in her hande one of the sydes of her heed tressed other not.
This quene fou~ded edyfyed of newe dyuers cytees stronge places acco~ plysshed many other grete dedes so moche yt there was neuer wryten of no man of so grete courage ne of more meruaylous werkes worthy to be had in mynde.
It is trouthe that many blameth her so she ought of ryght yf she had ben of our lawe of that yt she toke her owne sone to housbande yt she had goten of Nynus her lorde but the causes that moued her to that were. ij. pryncypally that one that she wolde not haue had in her Empyre none other lady crowned saue onely herselfe whiche sholde haue ben if her sone had wedded ony other lady that other cause was that her semed no ma~ worthy to haue her to his wyfe saue onely her ow ne sone yet was this cause gretter thrughe whi the she was somwhat excused in that she was not of our lawe for people lyued after lawe of nature where one durste doo to another without mysse takynge that whiche his herte perceyued or desyred.
For it is no doubte that if she had thou ght that it had ben euyll or that ony blame sholde fall to her therof but that she had so grete and soo hyghe courage and loued so moche worshyp she wolde neuer haue done it.
Nowe is the fyrst stone set in the foundement of our cyte.
Nowe it is con uenyent from hens forthe to set sewyngly stones to the quantyte for to auaunce our buyldynge.
Lande there is towarde the ende of Europe after the grete see that holde th in all the worlde whiche lande is called Syche or Sychye.
It happened somtyme that countre by force of warre was despoyled of all yonge men dwel lynge in that countree.
And when the women of that place sawe that they had lost theyr housbandes theyr bretherne and theyr kynnesmen.
And there was none lefte but olde men and chyldren they assembled by grete courage and toke counsayle bytwene them and aduysed the conclusyon that from that tyme forth they wolde maynteyne theyr lordshyppes without ony subieccyon of me~ and made suche a commaundement that no maner of man sholde entre in to theyr yet for to haue lygnage they sholde go in to nerte countre by a certayne season of the yere then sholde they tourne home agayne in to theyr coun tre.
And yf they were delyuered of ony sones they sholde sende them vnto theyr faders.
And yf they were mayde chyldren they wolde nourysshe them themselfe to perfourme theyr ordynaunce.
ij. of the moost noble ladyes amonge them to be crowned quenes of whiche one was called Lampheto that other Marpasye.
This do ne they chased out of theyr countre all mankynde that was lefte bothe yonge olde.
And after yt they armed them and with a grete batayle all of ladyes of maydens wente vpon theyr enemyes and wasted all theyr lande by fyre and by armrs and there was none that myght resyst them and to speke shortely they auenged the dethe of theyr frendes full notably.
And by this way began the women of Syche or of Sychye to bere armes whiche syth were called Amozonnes that is as moche to say as vnpapped.
For that they had suche a manere the noble women when they were lytell maydens theyr lyfte pappes were cutte of by a certayne crafte for they sholde not be combred to bere the shelde.
And to them that were not gentylwome~ theyr ryght pappes were cut away to shote the more easely.
So they wente so moche delytynge in the crafte of armes that they encrea sed by forte ryght moche theyr countre and theyr royalmes in so moche that theyr fame wente all aboute as haue here before touched to ye.
Then they wente in to dyuers countrees eche of theym ledynge a grete hoost dyde so moche they conquered a grete parte of Europe and of the countre of Ayfe and put vnder subieccyon many dyuers countres and Ioyned them to theyr lordshyppes and founded many cytees and townes and in lyke wyse in Ayse in the cyte of Ephese whiche is longe tyme hathe ben of grete renowne.
Of these two quenes Marpasye dyed fyrst in a batayle the~ the Amozones crowned her doughter in her place a noble mayde and a fayre whiche was named Synoppe whiche had so grete courage hyghe all dayes of her lyfe she dysdeyned not to be cou pled to no man but remayned styll a maybe al her lyfe.
So she had none other loue nor charge but onely in the excersyse of armes and in she had so grete pleasunce that she myght not be satysfyed to assayle and conquere landes and royalmes by her her moder was gretly venged in so moche that those of that countre were slayne and put to the swerde wasted all the lande and conquered.
THus as thou mayste here howe the Amozones began and maynteyned longe tyme theyr lordshyppes ryght worshypfully.
Of the whiche they made quenes by successyon one after another yf ryght worshypful ladyes whiche to name by rowe it myght tourne the reders to grete noyaunce.
So it shall suffyse to speke of pryn cypalles of whiche there was one called Thama rye ryght hardy wyse sage by whos wytte cautele and strengthe.
Cyrrus the stronge and mygh ty kynge of Perse was ouercome and taken whi che had conquered the grete Babylone and in the same wyse a grete parte of worlde.
So he wolde after many other conquestes that he had done goo vpon the lande of Amozones in hope to haue put them vnder his subieccyon wherof it happened as this same wyse quene knewe by her spy es that this same kynge Cyrrus wolde come vpo~ her with so grete strengthe of people that ought suffycyently to conquere all the worlde she aduysed her that it sholde be impossyble to dyscomfyte theyr hoost by strengthe of armes.
And then she wente this worshypfull capytayne when she knewe Cyrrus was entred before in to her londe whiche she suffred and lete hym passe before in to her londe without ony gayne saynge she made arme all her damoyselles and by ryght good ordynau~ce put them in dyuers busshmentes vpon moun tayues and in woodes where that Cyrrus myght passe none other way.
There abode this Tha marys ryght stylly with all her hoostes vnto ty me that Cyrrus and his people were come in to strayte wayes in forestes and amonge craggy roches where thrughe he must nedes passe.
And then the lady when that she sawe tyme made hastely to blowe a trompette.
And then this Cyrrus was ryght sore abasshed whiche toke no hede to hymselfe sodeynly sawe hym assayled in euery parte.
For these ladyes that were vpon the moun taynes threwe downe grete roches vpon them whiche myght go nother forwarde ne backe war de for the dyuersyte of the countre and some of busshmentes were before whiche slewe people downe ryght feruently wolde haue yssued out of the strayte passages myght not gather them togyder for that other busshment was behynde them.
So they were smyten a sondre with stronge roches to the dethe all the people and Cyrrus taken and by the commaundement of the quene lefte alyue and his barons with hym whom she made to come before her in to a pauylyon after dyscomfyture for the grete wrathe that she had to hym for one of her maydens that he had slayne by way before the wolde haue no mercy of Cyrrus nor of his barons but made to smyte of theyr hedes before hym.
And after that she sayd to hym Cyrrus whiche by thy crueltees were neuer satys fyed with blode of man nowe thou mayst drynke at thy wyll.
And then she made to sinyte of his heed cast it in to a basyne in to whiche she had made to gather the blode of his lordes.
Fayre dou ghter my dere frende these thynges brynge in remembraunce for that affermeth the matter haue tolde the of.
Notwithstandynge that thou knowest them well thyselfe hast rehersed them another tyme in thy boke of mutacyon of fortune in same wyse in thyne epystle of Othea.
So shall say to the more yet here after folowynge.
Howe the stronge Hercules Theseus wente vpon the Amozones and howe the. ij. ladyes Me and ypolyte had almoost ouercome them Capitulo. xviij.
WHat sholde say more of ye strengthe of theyr bodyes or by the of armes of these ladyes of Amozonye whiche by all countrees were dredde and doubted anone to of londe gre ce whiche was farre thens.
And tydynges wen howe these ladyes seased not to destroy landes and wasted the countres yf they wolde not yelde theym ryght soone vnto theym and howe they to withstande theyr enemyes.
Of this all Grece was aferde doubtynge that the landes of theym sholde stretche in shorte tnme vnto theyr countre.
Then there was in Grece in the floure of his you the Hercules the meruayllous stronge man whi che in his tyme dyde more meruaylles of strength than euer man dyde that was borne of woman of whome is made mencyon in hystoryes.
For he fought with gyauntes and Lyons with serpentes and monstres ryght and had of all them the vyctory.
And to saye shortely he was so stronge neuer man was lyke hym in strength excepte Sampson le forte.
This Hercules sayd it were not good to abyde tyl these ladyes of Amo came vpon them but it were moche better to go vpon them fyrst then for they lete ordeyne a grete nauye of shyppes assembled a· grete com pany of yonge lusty men for to go thyder in grete haste when Theseus the worshypfull and wyse man whiche was kynge of Athenes knewe this tydynges he sayd that he sholde not go without hym.
And so he assembled a grete hoost with this hoost of Hercules and when they were all assem bled they put them in to the see towarde the coun tre of Amozonye.
And when they approched the countre Hercules notwithstandynge his meruay lous strengthe and hardynesse and his grete host of people durste not take the porte by day ne to co me downe vpon the lande so moche the strengthe of these amozones was blowen aboute in dyuers countrees that it were meruayle to say and byleue yf there were not soo many hystoryes brynge wytnesse of them yt there hathe ben so many wor shypfull men ouercome by women.
So Hercules and his hoost abode tyll the darke nyght was co me.
And then when the houre was come that eue ry mortall creature ought to take his rest and slepe he and his hoost lepte a lande and entred in to the countre and began to sette fyre in cytees and townes and slewe all the women yt toke no hede of theyr comynge.
In the meane tyme grete was crye amonge people then they were not slowe to renne to theyr harnoys al maner of women as those that were moost hardyest to renne amonge people towarde see syde vpon theyr enemyes.
And then there reygned vpon these Amozones the quene Orthya whiche was a lady of ryght grete worthynesse and conquered many landes.
And this was the moder of worshypfull quene Pantasylya of whom shall be made mencyon he re after.
This quene Orthya was crowned after ye cheualrous quene Anthyoppe whiche maynteyned Amozones in grete of armes of cheualrye and was passynge wyse hardye in her tyme.
Soo this quene Orthya herde this tydynges howe the Grekes were come in by nyght fyghtynge on the lande alway sleynge the people.
Then it was to deme yt she was wrothe thought to be auenged vpon theyr male talent anone manasynge them that she dredde not commaunded to make redy all her batayle there one myght se all the ladyes busy to renne to theyr har noys and assembled them aboute theyr quene by this tyme was the clere daye come.
And then this quene armed herselfe and abode to put in ordre her bataylles and her hostes.
ij. worshypful maydens of souerayne strength of cheualrye and hardynesse wyse aboue many others.
Of whiche one was called Manalyppe that other Ipolyte and they were ryght nyghe kynne to the quene they abode not onely the co mynge of theyr quene but as fast as they myght be armed theyr speres in theyr handes theyr shel des of stronge elemphant hangynge vpon theyr neckes mounted vpon theyr well rennynge cour sers wente ryght fast rennynge towarde porte and with grete hete as those were supprysed wt wrathe berynge lowe theyr speres bare thrughe best of grekes.
That is to knowe Manalyppe towarde Hercules and Ipolyte to Thesens but whether they had wrathe or no it apered wel for notwithstandynge grete strengthe hardynesse grete courage of them so strongly these maydens hurte them by so grete encountre eche of theym bete theyr knyght they also fell on yt other syde but as soone as they myght they recouered them selfe ranne vpon them with good swerdes.
what worshyp ought these ladyes to haue by su che. ij. women were beten. ij. of best knyghtes yt were in all ye worlde this thynge sholde not be credyble to be trewe but so many antentyke doc tours bereth wytnesse of it these same doctours meruayllynge themselfe of this aduenture in excusynge specyally Hercules co~syderynge his outragyous strengthe sayth yt he was beholdynge to his hors yt lepte from ye grete hurte of stroke for they trowed not yf they had ben on but they sholde haue ben throwne downe these.
ij. knygh tes were ashamed to be thus bete~ of these.
ij. knyghtes stro~gly batayle endured longe yet at last what uayle yt these maydens were take~ for there ought not to be lyke strokes bytwene the~.
Hercules Thesens were gladder tha~ they had take~ a cyte So they helde them in theyr shyppes with them to refresshe them and to vnarme them and thought that they had well employed theyr wyll.
And when they sawe them vnarmed and that they we re so fayre and so semely then doubled theyr Ioye for they toke neuer pray was to them so agreable and so they kepte them with grete Ioy plea saunce.
Then came the quene vpon the grekes wt a grete hoost and when tydynges came to her that these two maydens were taken she was mer uayllously sorowful yet for doubte that they shol de do any harme to these ladyes that were taken yf she wente vpon them she rested as then sente to them by. ij. of her baronnesses and badde them to put to theyr fynaunce for these.
ij. ladyes as mo che as it pleased them and she wolde sende it vnto them.
Hercules Theseus receyued these messageres with grete worshyp and answered theym courtoysly and yf the quene wolde make a small peas with them and bothe she her baronnesses sholde promyse that they sholde neuer arme them agaynst the Grekes but to be theyr good frendes And the Grekes wolde promyse them in the same wyse that they wolde yelde home these.
ij. ladyes all quyte without hauynge ony other raunsome saue theyr harnoys onely for that they wolde ha ue for worshyp and remembrau~ce for euer of this vyctory that they had vpon these ladyes.
Then quene for the desyre that she had to haue these.
ij. damoyselles agayne whom that she loued so mo che was constrayned to make a peas with grekes.
Soo was this matter entreated accorded bytwene them the quene came to them all vnarmed with ryght a fayre company of ladyes maydens in so ryche araye that they sawe neuer suche before the grekes mette with them and fee sted them and made sure the peas bytwene them and there was moche Ioy made yet not for that it noyed gretely Thesens to delyuer Ipolyte for he was smyten with grete loue.
Soo Hercules prayed and requyred the quene so moche for hym that she graunted Thesens to take Ipolyte vnto his wyfe and so sholde lede her in to his countre And then were the weddynges made worshypful ly and after that the Grekes departed and Thesens ledde home ypolyte whiche had a sone after warde that was called Ipolytus whiche was a knyght of grete worshyp and a chosen ma~ amon ge many.
And when it was knowne in grece that that the peas was made they had neuer gretter Ioye.
For there was neuer noo thynge that they doubted more.
Of the quene Pantassylea howe she wente to the socours of Troye.
Ca. xix. LOnge tyme lyued this noble quene Orthya and in grete prosperyte hel de the lande of Amozonye and moche encreased theyr puyssaunce and she was ryght olde when she dyed.
Then they crowned after her her noble doughter the ryght worshypfull Pantassylle whiche aboue all others bare the crowne of wytte of pryce of wysdome and worthynesse.
This lady was ne uer wery to bere armes ne to fyght by her theyr lordshyp was encreased more than euer it was.
So she was so moche dredde of her enemyes that there durst none abyde her.
This lady was of so hyghe courage that she dysdeyned neuer to be coupled to ma~ but was a mayde all her lyfe.
In her tyme was the grete warre of the Grekes agaynst the Troyans for the grete fame that floured thrughe all worl de of the ryght grete worshyp and knyghthode of Ector of Troy as of the moost manly of the worl de and of the moost excellent in al graces.
As it is the vsage that gladly euery frende wolde desyre to vysyte his lyke.
Pantassylle whiche was the thyefe of all ladyes of worlde and whiche that herde saye contynuelly so grete goodnesse of this worshypful Ector she loued hym worshypfully of ryght grete loue aboue all thynges she desyred to se hym for to fulfyll this desyre she departed from her royalme in grete haste with ryght a noble company of ladyes and damoyselles of grete prowesse ryght rychely armed.
So she toke her way towarde Troy whiche was not lytell but ryght ferre of yet it thought not longe nor trauaylable to the herte loueth wel when they ca me to porte of Troy there aryued this noble pa~ tassylle yet it was to late for there she fou~de Ec tor deed whiche was slayne by Achylles lyenge a wayte for hym in batayle in whom perysshed floure of all knyghthode of Troy.
Then this que ne Pa~tassylle was receyued with grete worshyp of kynge Pryamus and of the quene Eccuba his wyfe of all theyr lordes but yet she had her herte alway on that she sawe neuer Ector on lyue whiche caused her yt there myght nothynge reioy ce her yet ye kynge ye quene whiche without seasynge sorowed for dethe of theyr sone Ector sayd to her yt syth they myght not shewe hym to her on lyue yt they wolde showe hym to her deed.
Then they ledde her in to temple where they had made his sepulture most noble most ryche euer ony hystory made mency on of for it was made in a chapell ryght ryche all of golde precyous stones before the hyghe awter of theyr goddes the re sate ye body of Ector in a chayre whiche was so bawmed couered it semed vysybly it was on lyue holdynge a swerde in his hande semynge al way yt his fyers vysage manased the Grekes clo thed in a garment grete large all of Tyssue embrowdred with precyous stones traylynge on erthe couered partyes bynethe whiche were plunged in fyne bawme whiche yelded meruayllous swetnes there ye Troyans helde this body in grete worshyp as it had ben one of theyr goddes wt lyght of ware clerely bre~nynge there was ry chesse wtout nombre thyder they led this quene Pantassylle the whiche as sone as chapel was opened sawe the body of Ector kneled her dow ne saluynge hym as he had ben on lyue and after she wente nere in beholdynge vysage she bega~ to saye suche wordes wepynge.
Ha floure and excellence of all knyghthode of all the worlde the grounde and endynge of all worthynesse who maye no we from hense forthe auaunte hym after you of ony prowesse or to stretche a syth nowe is the lyght and ensample of soo grete hyghnesse.
Alas what houre was borne the arme so cursed that durst by his outragyous cou rage despoyle the worlde of so grete a treasoure.
ryght noble prynce wherfore is my fortune so contrary that had not ben so nyghe you whe~ the false traytoure that slewe you made suche a wayte vpon your persone.
If had ben there wolde haue wayted vpon your persone myselfe yet and ye were on lyue he wolde byleue your dethe sholde be reuenged.
Ha what grete wrathe and sorowe that myne herte feleth to se you thus without puyssaunce to speke to me whom desy red so moche to se.
swere by al the hyghe goddes that we byleue on and promyse well and afferme to you my dere lorde whyle my lyfe shall endure youre dethe shall be venged by me vpon the Grekes.
Thus knelynge before body Pantassylle spake so hyghe that grete company of lordes ladyes of the that were there myght here her.
she and all wepte for pyte and coude full euyll departe from thens yet at the last kyssynge the han de with whiche he helde the swerde she departed saynge. worthynesse of knyghthode whiche semed you well in ydur lyfe when representacyon of your body bereth you wytnesse of so grete excel lence anone she departed wepynge ryght tenderly and as soone as she myght she armed her lepte out of cyte wt her hoost ryght nobly arayed agaynst the Grekes that were at syege.
And to saye shortely of that she dyde there without fayle yf she had lyued longe she wolde haue done ma ny meruaylles of armes.
So she wolde not tour ne homewarde but wolde fyght with Pyrrus was sone of Achylles was a ryght manly kny ght of his ha~de. so moche she bete hy~ wou~ded hym he was almost slayne.
And with grete pay ne he was rescowed of his people as a deed man was borne out of felde and the Grekes trowed neuer that he sholde escape wherfore they made moche sorowe and yf she hadde hate to the fader she shewed it well to sone.
Neuerthelesse to ma ke shorte the tale when she had done there so moche of armes by dyuers Iourneys with her people the Grekes were vndernethe Pyrrus was amended of his woundes had meruayllous shame and sorowe that he was thus beten soo foule of this woma~.
So he ordeyned his people of his hoost whiche were of ryght grete prowesse that they sholde attende to none other thynge in batayle saue onely to enclose Pantassyllee bytwene them and to put her from her people for he wolde that she were slayne by his owne hande he promysed them yf they myght do thus to gyue them grete gyftes.
This thynge to accomplysshe peo+ple of Pyrrus put grete payne longe tyme or they myght happen to do it they dred soo moche to come nyghe her for grete strokes that she gaue, yet not for that to come to the conclusyon they ap+plyed it as those toke no hede to other thynge sawe in a Iournay where she dyde meruayllous dedes of armes that it myght nere hande suffyse to Ector yf he had ben on lyue that by reason she ought to be wery there they enclosed her amon+ge them departed her from her batayle so sore oppressed her ladyes that they myght not socoure her that notwithstandynge by ryght meruayllous vertue and strengthe she wolde haue defended her and then they brake her harnoys smote of a quarter of her helme.
Then Pyrrus when he sawe heed bare by whiche her yelowe heere appered gaue her so grete a stroke he clefte in sondre heed the brayne.
And thus ended the wor+shypfull Pantassylle of whom it was grete losse to the Troyans and grete sorowe to all her coun+tre whiche made grete sorowe and lamentacyon For neuer syth there reygned none suche vpon the Amozones.
And thenne they bare the bodye home in to her owne countre.
And thus as thou mayst here began the royalme of women was maynteyned by grete puyssau~ce whiche endured by space of. viij. hondred yeres as thou thyselfe mayst note and se rede by the hystoryes of nom bre whiche may renne syth theyr begynnynge tyll after the conquest of grete Alexandre conquered al worlde.
In whiche tyme it appered then en dured reygne lordshyp of Amozones.
For hystory of hym maketh mencyon howe he wente in to that royalme and howe he was receyued of the quene the ladyes: So was this Alexa~dre longe tyme after the destruccyon of Troye and same wyse more than. iiij. hondred yeres after the foundacyon of Rome whiche was longe tyme af ter sayd destruccyon of Troy. wherfore yf thou wylte take the leysoure to brynge togyder the hy storyes and to calcule the tymes and the nombre thou shalte fynde that this royalme and the lorde shyp of women endured ryght a longe space and thou mayst note that in al the lordshyppes hath ben in the worlde whiche by the space of so moche tyme hath endured one shall not fynde more nota ble prynces nor in more quantyte ne that hath do ne more natable dedes than were done by quenes and the ladyes of that realme.
THere were not worshypfull women onely of these Amozones for valyau~t Cenobye ought not to be of lesse fame worthynes was quene of palmurenes a lady of noble bloode yssued of Ptholomees kynges of egypte.
Of this lady was apperynge all her youthe the grete cou rage and knyghtly inclynacyon that she had.
For as soone as she was strengthed there myght no man kepe her but that she wolde leue the dwellyn ge in the townes closyd in palayces or in royall chambres but to enhabyte the woodes forestes in whiche places she had her swerde gurde abou te her dartes by grete dylygence tosle the wylde beestes as hertes and hyndes.
And after that began to fyght with Lyons with beres and with many other wylde beestes and she assayled them without drede ouercame them meruayllously.
This lady helde it for no payne to lye in the woodes do ubtynge nothynge vpon the harde erthe in hote and in colde ne it greued her not to trace strayte passages of forestes graue vpon mou~taynes dyke in the valays rennynge after bestes.
This lady dyspraysed all carnall loue longe tyme refused maryage as she yt wolde kepe her vyrgynyte yet at last constrayned by her kynne she toke to housbande the kynge of Palmurenes Of grete beaute and soueraynly of body of vysa ge was this noble Cenobye whiche set but lytell by her beaute.
And fortune was so fauourable to her inclynacyon yt she consented to haue an housbande corespondent ynoughe to her condyons.
This kynge whiche was a knyghtly man hadde grete luste to conquere by strengthe of armes all the oryent and ye Empyres aboute hym.
In this same tyme Ualeryan Auguste helde Empyre of Rome was taken of Sapore kynge of Perce.
This kynge of Palmurenes assembled his grete hoost and Cenobye made no grete force of the fresshnes of her beaute but dysposed her to suffre the trauayle of armes with her housbande and to were harnoys to be partycypant with hym in all labours in exercyse of knyghthode.
This kynge that was named Ordonet stabled Herode his sone of another woman to conduyte one par te of his hoost takynge hede agaynst the sayd Sa pore kynge of Perce whiche that tyme occupyed Mesopotame after he ordeyned that on yt other parte sholde go vpon hym Cenobye his wyfe wt another grete parte of his hoost.
And he hymselfe sholde go in that other parte with the thyrde par te of his hoost.
But what shall saye the ende of this matter was suche so as thou mayst se by hystoryes that this lady Cenobye so myghtely and by suche hardynesse vertue gate dyuers bataylles agaynst this kynge and had the vyctorye and by her prowesse put Mesopotame vnder the subieccyon of her housbande and besyeged Sopore the kynge of Perce in his owne cyte and toke hym by strengthe with his Concubynes and there she co~ quered grete haboundaunce of rychesse.
After this vyctorye it happened yt her housbande was slayne by one of his owne kynnes men for enuye that he reygned vpon hym yet this lady by noble courage toke the possessyon of the Empyre for her chyldren whiche were yet but yonge and put her selfe in the see royall as Empresse and toke therof the gouernannct by grete vertue and charge and to say all so she gouerned by so grete wytte dyscyplyne of knyghthode that Galeryan and Clau dyan Emperoures of Rome thought that they oc cupyed a parte of the oryent for ye Romaynes dur ste neuer vndertake ony thynge agaynst her.
And the same wyse the Egypcyans ne Arabyens ne those of Armony but doubted her puyssaunce and her grete and helde theym contente to kepe that they had medle no ferther.
This lady was worshypped of her prynces of her people obeyed and loued and of her knyghtes dred and doubted for whe~ she rode with her people as ofte tymes it happened she wolde neuer speke to them of her hoost but her harnoys on her backe and her helme on her heed nor to no batayle made her armure to be ledde in charyot.
And alway she rode vpon a well rennynge courser often tymes she wolde ryde vnknowne to espye her enemyes before her folke.
This noble lady Cenobye with yt that she passed all other knyghtes of the worlde yt tyme in dyscyplyne and crafte of knyghthode.
Also she passed all other ladyes in noblesse and good condycyons of honest lyfe and ryght sobre soueraynely in all her demeanynge yet notwithstandynge she made often tymes grete feestes vn to her barons and to straungers and all magnyfycence was holden with her and royall largesse in all thynges and grete gyftes and fayre coude well drawe people to her loue and benyuolence she was alway of a souerayne chastyte.
For she kepte her not onely from other men but in the same wyse she wolde not lye with her housbande but for hauynge of yssue that she shewed openly by that that she wolde not lye with hym after yt she felte her with chylde and to that entente that all that appered outwarde sholde afferme that yt was inwarde she wolde neuer that ony vycyous man sholde haunte her courte and she wolde yt al they that wolde desyre to stande in her good grace were vertuous and well condycyoned and she dyde grete honoure to people after theyr worthy nesse and vertues not onely for theyr rychesse or byrthe and she loued moche those men that we re of sadde condycyons and proued in knyghthode.
She lyued after a royall custome of an Empresse by grete magnyfycence and cost of estate af ter the maner of Perse whiche was those dayes the moost pontyfycall custome that was amonge kynges.
She was serued in vessell of golde and of precyous stones She was garnyss hed of all good araye and also she gathered grete treasoures of her owne without doynge of extorcyon. and she gaue ryght largely where that it was rea sonable for there was neuer prynce of gretter lar gesse nor of more gretter magnyfycence.
And with these sayd thynges one of ye hyghest of her vertues that shall saye to the was lerned in letters in those of Egypte and of her owne lan guage and whe~ she had rest then ryght dylygent ly she toke hede to the scole and desyred to be taught in phylosophy by a phylosophre yt was named longyne.
She knewe the latyne and ye grekysshe letters by ye helpe of whiche she ordeyned and put ryghte curyously all her hystoryes vnder ryghte shorte wordes and the same wyse she wolde that her chyldren that she nourysshed were lerned in scyences.
Nowe take good hede ryght dere frende yf thou haue ought sene of ony prynce or knyght more vnyuersall in all the vertues.
ANd howe that the noble lady Lylye was not in batayle in propre person is she not to be praysed as ryght a no ble worshypfull lady in that she counsayllynge her sone Thyerrys ye ryght noble knyght made hym to tourne agayne in to the batayle as thou shalte here.
This Tyer res was in his tyme one of the grete prynces of ye palays of the Emperour of Constantynoble and was ryght a fayre man and ryght wel proued in the worthynesse of knyghthode and with that by the ryght good nourysshynge counsayllynge of his moder was ryght vertuous and excellently manered.
It happened a prynce named Odo+natre wente vpon the Romaynes for to destroye them and all Italy and as these Romayns wen+te to requyre the foresayd Emperoure of Constan+tynoble of his helpe he sente to them this knyght Tyerres as for the best knyght of cheualry with ryght a grete hoost of people.
So it happened as he fought in batayle ordeyned agaynst this Odo+natre the fortune of the batayle tourned agaynst hym in suche wyse that for drede he was constray+ned to fle towarde the cyte of Rauenne and whe~ this worshypful wyse moder whiche toke good hede of the batayle sawe her sone fle she had grete and meruayllous sorowe consyderynge that the+re myght be no gretter reproffe to a knyght than to fle in batayle.
Anone the grete noblesse of her courage made her to forgete all moderly pyte in suche maner that she had leuer to se dethe of her sone worshypfully than there sholde falle to hym suche a shame.
So she ranne anone before hym prayed hym ryght tenderly yt he sholde not dyshonoure hym by suche fleynge but yt he sholde assem+ble agayne his hoost and tourne to ye batayle yet he toke noo charge of these wordes and then the good moder supprysed with grete wrathe lyfted vp her gowne before and sayd to hym truely fayre sone thou hast no place to fle to but thou tourne agayne in to the wombe fro whens thou camest.
Then was this Thyerres so ashamed yt he lefte his fleynge assembled his people agayne touc ned agayne to the batayle in the whiche for hete that he had of the shame of the wordes of his mo der he fought so strongly that he dyscomfyted his enemyes and slewe Odonatre and so all Italye was delyuered of theyr enemyes by the wytte of this lady where it was lyke to be vtterly destroy ed. So me semeth that the honoure of this vycto ry came more of the moder than of the sone.
OF the quene of Fraunce Fredegonde of whom spake before was also of grete hardynesse of that that she dyde in batayle.
For as haue touched ho we yt she was lefte wedowe of kynge Chylderyke her housbande hauynge Clotharye her sone at her pappes and royalme was assay led with werre she sayd to her barons.
Lordes ne drede you not for the multytude of our enemyes that ben come vpon vs.
For haue thought befo re a wyle by the whiche we shall ouercome them yf ye wyll byleue me shall leue al femynyne dre de and shall arme myne herte with the hardynesse of a man to that entente to encreace the cou rage of you of all our hoost by pyte of your yonge prynce.
So shall go before hauynge hym in myne armes and ye shall folowe me and that we haue ordeyned our conestable to do ye shal do the same.
And the barons answered bad her to com maunde them with ryght good herte they wolde laboure it.
And then she lete make and well ordeyned her hoost.
Syth she put her before wel hor sed her sone bytwene her armes the barons after and al the bataylles sewynge by fayre ordre.
And so they rode towarde theyr enemyes so longe tyll the nyght was come.
So the conestable cutte downe an hyghe braunche of a tree and all the remenaunt dyde ye same wyse and couered al theyr horses with may tyed belles aboute some of theyr neckes as men dothe to horse that gothe in pastures and in this maner they rode togyder an easy pace tyll they ca me nyghe the lodgynges of theyr enemyes and they helde hyghe braunches and bowes of maye in theyr handes.
And alway the quene wente before with hardy courage in warnynge theym by promyses and fayre wordes for to do wel holdyn ge the lytell kynge bytwene her armes of whiche they all had grete pyte and had the more courage to kepe his ryght.
And when they thought yt they were nyghe ynoughe theyr enemyes they rested them.
when the dawnynge of the daye began to appere those that made watche of the hoost of the enemyes perceyued it began to saye one to ano ther.
For yesternyght there appered no woode nor forest nyghe vs and se nowe a ryght grete a thycke woode ye others yt behelde this thynge sayd that it must nedes be yt the woode had ben there longe tyme before for it myght be none otherwyse but that they haue ben so beestyss he that they haue not perceyued it and that it was to se that it was a woode the belles of the hors that pastured myght haue made them certayne.
And so as they deuysed they thought ne uer on the trechery.
Sodeynly the quenes hoost cast away theyr braunches and then that yt semed to theyr enemyes a wode it appered knyghtes ar med so they ranne vpon them and this was done so sodaynly yt theyr enemyes had no leysoure to arme them for they were all in theyr beddes.
So they wente in to theyr lodgynges and slewe and toke theym all that they coude fynde thus they had the vyctory by the wytte of this good quene Fredegonde.
OF women of worshyp and of knyght hode myght tell the ynoughe.
The noble mayde Camylle was noo lesse worthy than those before sayd.
This Camylle was doughter of the ryght auncyent kynge of Uoulques named Machabyus and when she was borne her moder dyed and anone after her fader was dysheryted by his owne people that rebelled agaynst hym soo moche they troubled hym that he was constrayned to fle for sauynge of his lyfe.
Soo he bare nothynge wt hym saue onely his yonge doughter whom he loof so grete loue.
And when he came to passe ouer a grete ryuere that he myght not chose but he must nedes passe it he was in grete myschyefe for that that he coude fynde no counsayle to helpe his lytel doughter to passe and whe~ he had thought ynoughe he toke grete ryndes of trees made a vessell as it were a lytell bote.
So he put his lytell doughter within and bounde ye vessell with good ropes to his arme.
And after put it in the ryuere he swymmynge trayled easely this vessell after hym and so he and his doughter passed ouer the water in to the woodes and there he lyued longe for he durste not go none other waye for drede of his enemyes.
He nourysshed his doughter with the mylke of wylde bestes vnto the tyme that she was well strengthed and with the skynnes of ye beestes that he slewe he couered bothe hym his doughter they had none other bedde ne other couerynge but skynnes of bestes.
And whe~ she was waxed moche she began to warre with wylde be stes and to sle them with her slynges and stones she wolde renne after so lyghtly that there myght no greyhounde do better.
And thus she conty nued tyl she came to her parfyte age in whiche she founde herselfe of a meruayllous strengthe har dynesse and then she was enfourmed of her fader of the wronge that he had of his subgectes.
She felynge herselfe of grete strengthe and ryght couragyous departed from thens and toke her to ar mes and to saye shortely she dyde so moche applyed her purpose that with the helpe of some of her kynnesmen she beynge alwaye in her propre persone in bataylles dyde so moche by strengthe of armes that she conquered agayne all her countre and neuer lefte after to pursewe the dedes of cheualrye and she was of so hyghe courage that she deyned neuer to haue housbande ne to be coupled to man.
And this same Camylle was ye mayden that came to the socoure of Turnus agaynst Eneas when he was come downe in to Italye.
THere was a quene in capadoce that was named Ueronycle noble of blode and of courage as she that was doughter to the grete kynge Mycrydaces that ruled a grete parte of the oryent and wyfe of kynge Aryaraces ye Capadocyan.
This lady contynewed in her wedowhode in the whiche wedowhode one of the bretherne of her housbande assayled her with warre to dysheryte her and her chyldren and as it happened durynge this stryfe that ye vncle slewe the .ij. sones of this lady and his owne neuewes.
She was so vtterly moued with sorowe yt this grete wroth made all drede to fle from her.
So she armed herselfe with a grete hoost wente agaynst her brother in lawe and so she plyed her entente that at ye last she slewe hym her owne hande made her charyot to go ouer hym and ouercame batayle.
WHat shall we saye lesse of the noble the ryght excellent Archemyse than of other worshypfull ladyes whiche was quene of Carye the whiche abo de wedowe longe after her housban de kynge Mansole the whiche she loued of so gre te loue that it myght neuer departe from her herte as it appered so as it shall be deuysed to the in tyme and place here after.
Her housba~de lefte her many fayre and grete countrees in gouernaunce yet to gouerne she neuer was abasshed for streng the in vertue sadnesse of condycyons prudente in gouernaunce was all in her.
So she had with that so grete hardynesse in dede of knyghthode so well kepte the dyscyplyne of cheurye that she had the vyctory of many dyuers bataylles.
And thus the hyghnesse of her name was gretely lyfte vp by grete praysynge.
For in her wedowhode wt that that ryght nobly she gouerned the countres she armed her by dyuers tymes and in especyall .ij. notable dedes yt one was to kepe her countre yt other was to kepe trouthe faythfull promyse.
The fyrst was when the foresayd kynge Mansole her housbande was deed those of rodes whiche marched ryght nyghe the royalme of this lady had grete enuye and dysdayne that a woman sholde haue the lordshyp of the royalme of Carye and for that in hope to put her out to gete ye lande they came vpon her with a grete armye and a grete multytude of shyppes and made her waye towarde the eyte of whiche stode vpon the see in an hyghe place called care whiche was ryght a stronge place.
So there were to this Cyte two gates of whiche that one was within the cyte as it were hydde and couered and at the entrynge ryght strayte and there myght one go and entre in to yt palays without seynge of them without and of them of the cyte also.
That other comune gate was nyghe the walles of the Cyte.
And when this worshypfull and wyse Archemyse knewe by her spyes that her enemyes were come she made her people to go to harnoys of who~ there were assembled ynowe and entred in that lytell gate in to the shyppes that she ordeyned to come thyder yet or she departed she ordeyned to them of the cyte whiche were good and trewe in whom she trysted wel to do suche thynges as she commaunded them that when she sholde make a certayne sygne yt she deuysed to them yt they sholde make to them of the rodes a sygne of loue and that they sholde call them vpon the walles sholde saye to them that they wolde delyuer to theym the cyte and that they sholde come boldely and yt they sholde do soo moche yf they myght to make them lepe out of theyr shyppes and to entre in to the market place of the cyte.
And this thynge ordeyned the lady and her hoost yssued out at the lytell gate and wente a lytell waye in to the hyghe see so that her enemyes toke no hede of them and as she had made her sygne and knewe by ye sygne of them of the cyte that the enemyes were entred in anone she retourned by the grete gate and toke the shyppes of her enemyes and entred in to ye cyte and made to assayle the men of the Rodes in euery parte by her busshmentes and she and her hoost were before them and so slewe them al and dyscomfyted them and had the vyctory.
And yet more worshypfully dyde this noble Archemyse for she wente after in to the shyppes of her enemyes with all her hoost and wente to the Rodes made to lyfte vp an hyghe sygne of vyctorye as thoughe it· had ben theyr people that sholde come agayne vyctoryously.
And when those of yt countre sawe this trowynge that it had ben theyr people they were passynge Ioyfull lete open theyr porte and Archemyse came in and ordeyned people to kepe the porte and then wente streyght to the palays and toke and slewe all the prynces.
And thus those of the Rodes were taken whiche toke no hede of themselfe and the lady kepte her seased in the foresayd Cyte.
And anone after all the hole Ile of Rodes yelded theym vnto her.
And after that she had put all the yle in seruage vnder trybute she lefte it garnysshed with good kepers and so retourned home yet or she departed she lete make two ymages of brasse in cyte of whyche that one represented the persone of Ar chemyse as ouercomer.
Another notable dede amonge others that this lady dyde was this that when it was so that Exerse ye kynge of Perse was come agaynst the Macedonyes and all ye lande was full of his hoost bothe on horse backe and on fote and ye ryuageful of people and of his shyppes as he that trowed to destroye all grece.
Than ye Grekes whiche had made alyaunce with this lady Archemyse sente to her to requyre her of her helpe to the whiche helpe she sente not onely but lyke a cheualrous lady came in propre persone with ryght a grete hoost.
And so well she kepte her place there that to saye shortely anone she put her in batayle agaynst these men of Perse dyscomfyted them.
And when she had dyscomfyted them vpon the lande she entred into the shyppes and was before al others with her nauye and nyghe the cyte of Salemyne she gaue them batayle And as they fought strongly this worshypfull archemyse was amonge the fyrst lordes and capytaynes of her hoost and comforted them with grete boldenesse sayenge.
Nowe forthe my bretherne and good knyghtes and laboure so that the worshyp maye be ours and deserue ye this daye pray synge and worshyp.
And my grete treasoure shall not be spared vnto you and to saye all she dyde so moche that in lykewyse as she dyscomfyted them on the londe she dyscomfyted them on the water And Exerses fledde shamefully and thus she had people innumerable for as many wryters of hystoryes bereth wytnesse she had so grete an hoost that dyuers ryuers taryed theym as she passed.
And so had this worshypfull lady this noble vyctorye and retourned worshypfully in to her coun tre with the dyademe of grete worshyp.
ALso Cleolis ye noble Romayne was ryght an hardy woman and a wyse. notwithstandynge it was not in the warre nor in batayle.
For as it happened ones that the Romaynes by certayne couenauntes made bytwene them and a kynge that had ben theyr aduersary.
It was accorded that by certyfycacyon of the couenauntes there was sente to that kynge to be in hostage the noble mayden Cleolis and other mandens of noble lygnage of Rome and when this Cleolis had ben a grete whyle in the foresayd hoostage.
She thought that it was a grete hurte to the worshyp of the Cyte of Rome that so many of noble maydens sholde be holden as prysoners of a straunge kynge.
Soo this Cleolys armed her courage with grete hardynes and dyde so moche by fayre wordes fayre promyses that she deceyued wysele them yt had them in kepynge departed from thens by nyght and ledde her felowes and wente so longe tyll they aryued vpon the reuer of Tybre and there this Cleolys founde in medowes an horse pasturynge.
And then she whiche happely neuer rode before mounted vpon this horse without ony maner of drede of the depnesse of the water put one of her felawes behynde her passed ouer.
And after all others one after another and so they passed ouer saufe and this lady Cleolys ledde them to Rome brought them to theyr frendes.
The hardynesse of this mayde was gre tely praysed of them of Rome and same wyse kynge that had them in hostage praysed her gretely had therof grete solace.
And the Romayns to that entente that there sholde be a remembrau~ ce had of this dede from thens for the.
They made make the ymage of Cleolys whiche was made in guyse of a mayde syttynge vpon an horse.
And they put this ymage in an hyghe place vpon the waye by whiche they wente to a temple there it abode longe tyme.
Now we haue accheued ynou ghe as for the foundement of our cyte.
Nowe we must lyfte vp the hyghe walles all aboute.
Xp~ine demaundeth of Reason yf euer god lyste to make a woman so noble to haue ony vndersta~ dynge of the hyghnesse of scyence.
THese thynges of me ryght well herde answered to lady that spake to me.
Madame truely without fay le god shewed grete meruaylles in strengthe of these foresayd ladyes of the whiche ye haue touched yet praye you to make me wyse yf it please you to the whiche god hathe gyuen them soo many graces it pleased to worshyp the kynde of woman to gyue pryuylege to ony of them of the vertue of hyghe vnderstandynge and of grete scyence and yf they haue abyle wytte to that.
For that desyre to knowe for that men maynteyne and say that the vnderstan dynge of women is but of lytell takynge.
Doughter by that yt haue sayd here to fo re thou mayst knowe the contrary of theyr opyny on and for to expounde it more playnly shal gy ue it the fyrst by ensamples.
saye to the agayne and doubte neuer the contrary that yf it were the custome to put the lytel maydens to the scole and that sewyngly were made to lerne as they do to the man chyldren that they sholde lerne as parfytely and they sholde be as wel entred in to the subtyltes of al the artes and scyences as they be and peraduenture there sholde be mo of them for haue touched here to fore by howe mo che that women haue the body more softe than men haue and lesse habyle to do dyuers thynges by so moche they haue the vnderstandynge more sharpe there as they apply it.
Madame be not dyspleased suffre me vpon this poynte yf it please you.
Certaynly me~ wolde neuer suffre this que styon to passe for trouthe but yf it were openly assoyled.
For they wolde saye yt one sayth comunely these men to vnderstande moche more than wo men dothe.
Answere doughter knowest thou wherfore it is that they vnderstande lesse.
Madame naye but yf it please you to tell it me without fayle it is for that they haunte not so many dy uers places ne so many dyuers thynges but they holde them within theyr houses and it suffyseth them to do theyr busynesses and there is nothyn ge that techeth a creature reasonable so moche as dothe the experyence of many dyuers thynges.
Madame and syth that they haue the vnderstandynge abyle to conceyue and to lerne as the men haue wherfore lerne they not more.
For yt doughter for it is no nede to comune thyn ge that they medle them of that whiche is co~myt ted to man to do as haue sayd to the before.
It suffyseth that they do comune offyce to whiche they are ordeyned and that that one Iugeth by experyence of that that the women can lesse than men it is no meruayle as it is sayd before though theyr vnderstandynge be lesse.
Make the a behol dynge of the people of the lowe countre or of the hyghe mountaynes.
Thou shalte fynde cou~trees ynowe yt the people seme as bestes they be so sym ple and yet it is no doubte that nature hath made them as parfyte in all thyse thynges as in body and vnderstandynge as well as wysest people and moost experte of those that ben in good cytees or in good townes and that is for defaute of lernynge.
Not withstandynge as haue sayd to the before that of men and women some haue better vndestrandynge than some for there hath ben women of ryght grete connynge and of grete vnderstandynge.
shall tell the and to our pur pose that tolde the of the vnderstandyng of wo men that they haue as sharpe wytte to lerne as men haue.
Of women yt were enlumyned of grete scyences fyrst of noble mayde Cornyfye.
COrnyfye the noble mayde was sent to the scole by her fader in maner of scorne or of Iape with her brother Cornyfycyen whe~ they were yonge chyldren.
But this lytell mayde by mernayllous wytte haunted the scole so moche yt she began to fele the swete droppes of vnderstan dynge to lerne.
So it was no lyght thynge to take away this pleasaunce from her to the whiche all other womens werkes put a parte she applyed her in that she myght.
And thus she occupyed her so well by the space of tyme that she was ryght a souerayne poete and not onely in yt scyence but it semed that she was nourysshed with myl ke and with the doctryne of party te phylosophye For she wolde fele and knowe of all maner of scy ences that she lerned soueraynly in so moche that she passed her broder whiche was ryght a grete poete in all excellent clargye it suffysed her not onely the connynge but she put the vnderstandyn ge to werke it and her handes to penne in compylynge many ryght notable bokes the whiche bokes and dyttyes were in the tyme of saynt Gre gory of grete pryce of whom Bocace the Italyen whiche was a grete poete maketh mencyo~ in pray synge this woma~ sayth in his boke.
ryght grete worshyp to that woman hath lefte womans werkes and applyeth and gyueth her wytte to studye of ryght hyghe connynge.
And this Bocace sayth forthermore certefyenge the purpose sayd to the of the wyttes of women.
Nowe ben they ashamed sayth he as these slowe women so mysse trusteth of theyrselfe and of theyr vnderstandynge so as thoughe they were borne in the mountaynes without vnderstandynge what is welthe or worshyp so dyscourageth themselfe and sayth that they be not good to other thynge nor profytable but to take men aboute the necke and to bere nourysshe chyldren and god hathe gyuen them fayre vnderstandynge yf they wolde applye it in all thynges that these gloryous and excellent men dothe for yf they wolde studye the thynges be nother more ne lesse but also comune to women as to men and may by honest laboure gete them name perpetuall the whiche hauynge is agreable to all worshypfull men.
Ryght dere doughter thus mayst thou se howe this auctoure Bocace bereth wytnesse of that that haue sayd to the and howe he prayseth and proueth scyence in woman.
OF grete excellence in scyence also was Probe Romayne wyfe of Adelphe was crystened.
This woman had so notable wytte and she loued and haunted the scole soo moche that she coude soueraynly the. scyences lyberales and was ryght a souerayne poete.
And by so grete laboure in studyenge she haunted the bokes of poetes and in especyall of vyrgyle and of his dyttyes that to all purposes she had them all in mynde whiche as in a tyme she sawe by grete entente of her wytte and of her thought and as she toke hede of the sygnyfyenge of them It came to her entencyon that one myght after the foresayd bokes dyscryue all the scrypture and the hystoryes of the olde testament and of the newe by pleasaunt verses and full of substaunce the whiche thynge for certayne that the auctoure Bocace saythe is not without meruayle that so hyghe consyderacyon myght entre in the brayne of woman and ryght a meruayleas he sayth to put it in execucyo~ for she ryght gretely desyrynge to fulfyll her thou ght put the hande to the werke and somtyme she ranne by the Bucolyques or by Eueydos or by Georgykes whiche were the bokes that Uyrgyle made whiche ben so named that is to say she vysyted and redde nowe of one parte she toke the hole verse nowe of others some lytell partes she touched by meruayllous crafte subtylte to her purpose and so ordynately made hole verses and letell partes put togyder coupled redde in be holdynge lawe the crafte the measure of fete and the Ioynynge togyder verses without fay lynge in ony parte that no man myght do better.
And by suche manere after the begynnynge of the worlde she made the begynnynge of her boke in sewynge all the hystoryes of the olde testament of the newe and so came to the sendynge of holn ghost to the apostles accordynge all with bokes of Uyrgyle soo ordynately that who had not knowynge of this makynge wolde haue wende that Uyrgyle had ben a prophete or an Euangelyst togyder.
For the whiche the foresayd Bocace sayth grete recommendacyon lowynge of this woman.
For it appereth openly that she had very knowlege and playne of holy bokes and holy volumes of deuyne scrypture the whiche boke was knowne of many grete clerkes deuynes of our tyme.
And this noble lady wolde this foresayd werke made and compounded by grete laboure Laboure sholde be called Centonyas.
And not standynge the laboure of werke as for the gretnesse ought suffyse to lyfe of a man yet she lefte not tyll she had made many dyuers other bokes ryght worshypfull excellente.
One amonge all other she made in verses to be called also Cento nye bycause of an hundred verses that ben contey ned therin.
Also she toke the bokes of Omerus poete and the verses by whiche one myght conclu de to the praysynge of her whiche knewe not one ly the latyne letters but also the grekes as parfytely.
Of the whiche lady and of her thynges she dyde Bocace sayth that it ought to be grete pleasaunce to all women to here.
ANd of lesse co~nynge the~ Probe was not the noble Sapho whiche was a mayde of cyte of Mylycene.
This Sapho was of ryght grete beaute of body and of vysage and in maner ly countenaunce and in speche ryght agreable pleasaunt and aboue all other graces that were gyuen her she passed of hyghe vnderstandynge.
For she was experte in many dyuers artes and scyences.
And she knewe not onely letters and wrytynges made by others but of herselfe she founde many newe thynges and made many dyuers bokes dyttyes of whom speketh poe
Bornes these fayre wordes of poetyke language Sapho garnysshed of quycke vnderstandynge and of brenuynge desyre by contynuel study amonge the beestysshe people and without haunted the hyghnesse of the mountay ne of this is to vnderstande the studye by veray hardynesse and boldenesse she ac companyed herselfe with ix. muses not refused that is to amonge the craftes and scyences so entred in the forest of Lawryere full of braun ches of vertue floures of dyuers colours smellynge of grete swetnesse of dyuers herbes where they rest them and dwell grammer Logyke and the noble rethoryke Geometry and Arysmetryke and so moche she wente yt she came and aryued in the caue and depnesse of Appolyne god of scyence and connynge and founde the sprynge and conduyte of Castolyo the welle and toke the wrest of the harne and touched it.
So she made grete melodyes with the nymphes ledynge daunce this is to vnderstande with the rules of Irmony and cordes of musyke.
By these thynges that Bocace sayth of her ought to be vnderstande the depnesse of her vnderstandynge and bokes that she made of so depe scyence that the sentences ben stronge to knowe vnderstande to men of grete wytte and the scole after the wytnesse of auncyent men endureth vnto this day and her wrytynges and ryght notably compounded made by lyghtes and ensamples to them that cometh after wrytynge and
She founde many dyuers maners of makynge of songes and dyttyes playes and wepynge complayntes and straunge lamentacyons of loue ryght well in fayre ordre whiche were named after her name Saphyse and of these dyttyes recordeth Crassus that when Plato the grete Phylosophre whiche was mayster to Arystotle was deed one founde the bokes of the wrytynges of Sapho vnder his bolster of his heed and to saye shortely of this lady she was of so grete excellence of connynge yt in the Cyte where she was conuersaunt to entent she was moost worshypfull and that she sholde be alwaye in remembraunce one made to her lykenesse an ymage of brasse halowed in the name of her lyfte of a grete hyght.
So was this lady na med and counted amonge all other poetes of renowne of the whiche as Bocace saythe the worshyppes of dyademes of crownes of mytres of bysshoppes be not gretter ne them that hathe vyctores and chaplettes of Lauryere and palme.
Leonte that was a greke was a grete phyloso phre also whiche durste reproue the Phylosophre Theophrast by pure and trewe reasons whiche was so gretely named in his dayes.
IF the scyences ben easy couenable to women to lerne knowe it for trouthe that the same wyse craftes are not vn sene to them som tyme in the olde lawe of paynymes people vsed many dyuers dyuynacyons of that that was to come by the fiyght of byrdes and by the flambes of fyre.
And that was a propre arte or a co~nynge whiche they helde in grete dygnyte.
In this tyme a mayden was a grete maystresse whiche was doughter of Thyryfye whiche was the gretest preest of cyte of Thebes so as we calle hym a bysshop for in other lawes the bysshoppes were maryed.
This woman that was named Manthea whiche flou red in the tyme of kynge Edyppus was of so clere and grete wytte that she knewe al the crafte of Pyromancye whiche is for to dyuyne by flambes of fyre the whiche arte vsed in the olde tyme those of Caldee whiche founde it and others say th that Nembroche the gyaunt founde it.
So the re was in her tyme no man that knewe mouyn ges of the flambes of fyre the colours and sow yt came out of the fyre but she.
And also she kne we clerely the vaynes of beestes the throtes of bo les and the entraylles of all beestes that one wol de byleue that by these craftes often tymes spyrytes were constrayned to speke and to gyue answere of that yt one wolde knowe.
In the tyme of this lady Thebes was destroyed thrughe the en cheson of the. ij. sones of kynge Edyppus.
Then wente this lady to dwelle in Asye and there she made a temple of the god Apollo the whiche was syth in grete renowne.
She ended her lyfe in Ita lye and of ye name of this lady for her grete auctoryte there was named a Cyte of the countre and yet is Manthoa in whiche vyrgyle was borne Of Medea and another quene named Cyrtes Capitulo. xxxij.
MEdea of whome hystoryes ynoughe maketh mencyon coude as moche of crafte and connynge as she before reherced.
She was the doughter of Othes kynge of Coloos and of Per te She was ryght fayre of body and of vysage But in connynge she passed all other women in her tyme she knewe the vertues of euery dyuers herbe and all maner enchauntementes that myght be made and of ony crafte that myght be lerned she was not ygnoraunt by vertue of a songe that she coude she wolde make ye Ayre to trouble and the skye to waxe darke moue wyndes out of the pyttes and caues of the erthe to make the tempestes to ryse in the ayre to make waters and grete ryuers to stande styll to make venyme to make fyres without laboure to brenne ony ma ner thynge she wolde all suche maner of thyn ges she coude do this was she yt made Iason to conquere the golden fleece by enchauntement.
Cyrtes also was a quene of a countree vpon the see whiche stode vpon the entryes of Italye.
This lady coude so moche of the crafte of enchau~ tement that there was nothynge that she wolde do but she wolde do it by vertue of her enchaun tement and by a drynke that she wolde gyue she wolde chaunge the bodyes of men in to the fygu res of wylde bestes and byrdes.
And to wytnesse ye same thynge it is wryten in ye hystory of Ulyxes that when he retourned after the destruccyon of Troy trowed to go agayne in to his countree of grete fortune and woodnesse of tempestes burled his shyppes here and there by many dyuers trou bles that at the laste they aryued at the porte of cyte of this lady Cyrtes. yet this wyse vlyxes wol de not take the lande without lycence of the quene of the lande he sente certayne of his knyghtes to her for to knowe yf it pleased her that they myght take the lande.
Then this lady trowed that they had ben her enemyes gaue them drynke of drynke that she made and anone they were trans fourmed in to hogges but Ulyxes wente anone to her and dyde so moche they were put agayne in to theyr owne and in the same wyse some men saye of Dyomede that was another prynce of Grece that when he aryued at the porte of this lady Cyrtes she made his knyghtes to be trans fygured in to byrdes whiche be yet ryght grete of other shappe than other byrdes ben and they ben ryght fyerse and those of that countree calle them Dyomedens.
Xp~ine asketh of Reason yf there was euer woman that founde ony thynge of herselfe that was not knowne before and she tolde her of Nycostra te otherwyse called Carmentis.
Xp~ine whiche vnderstode these thynges of dame reason replyed vpon that in this ma nere.
Madame se wel ye myght fynde ynowe and of grete nombre of women praysed in scyences and in crafte but knowe ye ony that by ver tue of theyr felynge and of subtylte of wytte haue founde of themselfe ony newe craftes and scyences necessary good and couenable that were neuer founde before nor knowne for it is not so gre te maystry to folowe and to lerne after ony other scyence founde and comune before as it is to fynde of theymselfe some newe thynge not accustomed before.
Ne doubte ye not contrary my dere frende but many craftes and scyen ces ryght notable hathe ben founde by the wytte and subtylte of women as moche by speculacyon of vnderstandynge the whiche sheweth them by wrytynge as in craftes ye sheweth theym in werkynge of handes and of laboure.
And fyrst shal tell the of Nycostrate whiche those of Italye called Carmentes.
This lady was doughter of the kynge of Archadye named Pallent.
She was meruayl lous wytty gyuen of god to her of specyall gyftes of vnderstandynge.
She was a grete clarke in the letter of Grece and had so moche fayre and wyse speche worshypfull faconde that poetes beynge tyme wrote of her fayned in her wrytynges she was loue of the god Mercuryus she had a sone by the foresayd god whiche was of grete vnderstandynge.
This lady by certayne chaunce that happened in the countre where she was wente out of her countre her sone and grete foyson of people yt folowed wente with her and with a grete nauye came in to Italye and aryued vpon the water of Tybre and there she descended out of her shyppes.
So she wente vp vpon an hy+ghe hylle that she named the mounte Palentyne after her fader vpon the whiche mounte the Cyte of Rome was founded syth.
This lady with her sone and those that folowed her founded a fayre castell there.
And as this lady had founde the me~ of that countre al bestysshe and rude she ordeyned and wrote certayne lawes by whiche she enioyned them to lyue by ordre of ryght and reason after Iustyce and she was the fyrst yt in this countre whiche was syth of so grete renowne of whom all the lawes of ryght come of the fyrst yt establed the lawes there.
This lady knewe by inspyracyo~ deuyne that by the spyryte of prophecye amonge other graces that she had synguler specyalte was gyuen to her howe this countre ought to be in ty+me to come moost noble of excellence of renowne aboue all the countres of the worlde.
So it semed her that it sholde be no honest thynge yt whe~ the hyghnesse of the Empyre of Rome that all the worde ought to lordeshyp and gouerne that they sholde vse of letters and carectes straunge and begged of other countrees and to that entente al so that she wolde shewe her wysdome and excellence of wytte to the worlde to come she dyde soo moche by her study that she founde propre letters dyfferenced from all other nacyons of the worlde that is to knowe the.
A. B. C. and the ordenaunce of latyne by puttynge togyder of same letters with the dyfference of vowelles with all the entrynge of the scyence of grammere.
The whiche letters and scyences she toke and taught them to her people and wolde yt it sholde be knowne com munely so it was no lytell scyence nor lytell profy table that this woman founde.
For subtylnesse of the sayd scyence and for the grete profyte and welthe that is come to ye worlde by it one myght say that there was neuer worthyer thynge foun de to the worlde and of that benefyse Italyens haue not ben vnkynde of good ryght to whom this thynge was so meruayllous that they had her not onely in reputacyon more than man but a goddesse.
And whe~ she was deed they edyfyed and founded a tymple in her name.
And it was made and buylded at the foote of the foresayd mountayne where she dwelled.
And to gyue to this lady a perpetuall memorye for euermore they toke many of them theyr names as after the scyences that she had founde also they gaue the name of her to dyuers of theyr thynges so as themselfe of that countre for the scyence of latyne whiche that was founde there by that lady they call themselfe latynes in grete worshyp and that more is for that that ita in latyne that is to say in Frensshe ouy and in Englysshe ye the souerayne affyrmacyon of this language is latyne.
And yet it suffyseth not them yt this countre was called lande of latyne but they wolde that all the countres ouer the mountaynes whiche is grete large where there were many dyuers countres lordshyppes all was called Italye.
Of this lady Carmentys dyttyes were called carmen in latyn And also the Romaynes that came a grete whyle syth named one of the gates of the Cyte of Rome Carmentele the whiche names for what maner prosperyte that ye Romaynes had syth nother for no hyghnesse of Emperours they chaunged neuer syth so as it appereth vnto this day it endure th yet.
And what wylte thou more fayre doughter may there ony man saye more worshyp of ony man borne of woman yet thou trowest not that this crafte be onely to the worlde by whiche many scyences and dyuers haue ben founde.
Of Mynerue that founde many scyences and the maner to make Armoure of Iron and steele.
MInerue so as thou haste wryten in other places was mayden of Grece and her surname was Pallas this mayde was of so grete excellence in wytte that the lewde people of that countree for that yt they knewe not well of what kynrede she was of they sawe her do thynges yt had not ben before in vsage sayd that she was a goddesse comen frome heuen for by so moche as they knewe not frome whens she came the more was to them meruaylable the grete connynge of her aboue all women in her tyme this lady was subtyll and of grete vnderstandynge not onely in one thynge but soueraynely in all thynges.
She founde by her subtylnesse certayne lettres Grekeysshe that some call them Carectes by the whiche one myght put a grete tale of dyuers thynges in wrytynge in the space of ryght fewe lettres of shorte wrytynge the whiche abreuyacyons vseth the Grekes yet whiche was ryght a fayre inuencyon and a subtyll to fynde.
She founde nombre and maner of a compte and to put togyder sommes.
She had the spyryte soo moche enlumyned of vnderstandynge that she founde many craftes and werkes to make that had neuer ben founde before.
The crafte of wolle and to make clothe she founde fyrst yt euer was aduysed to shere shepe to tose wolle to kembe to carde it with dyuers instrumentes to make it clene to make it softe wt roddes of yron to spynne at dystae after instrumentes to make the clothe howe it sholde be wouen.
Also she founde the cafte vsage to ma ke oyle of fruytes of ye erthe of Olyues of other fruyte to presse it to drawe ye lycoure.
Also she founde crafte the vsage to make cartes charyottes to bere thynges easely from one place to another yet dyde this lady more that semed more meruaylable for that yt it is ferre fro nature of woma~ yt she sholde aduyse her of suche thynges.
For she founde the crafte the manere of ma kynge of harnoys armure of yron of stele the whiche the knyghtes, men of armes vseth in ba tayle with whiche they couer theyr bodyes and yt she it fyrst to them at Athenes to whome she taught ye vsage of ordeynynge hoostes in batayle the maner of fyghtynge in ordre arowe she founde fyrst pypes shalmes trompes instrumentes of mouthe.
This lady with the grete vertue of vnderstandynge yt she had was alwaye a vyrgyn for gret chastyte yt she was of poetes sayd in theyr sayenges yt wulcan god of fyre had longe wrestled with her fynally she ouercame hym surmounted hym yt is as moche to saye she ouercame the brennynge the concupyscence of the flesshe whiche gyueth grete defaute in youthe.
The people of Athenes had her in grete called her goddesse of armes of knyghthode bycause she founde fyrst vsage.
And also they called her goddesse of connynge for the grete scyence habou~ded in her.
After her dethe they made to her a temple in Athenes co~secrate in her name in that temple they set her ymage whiche was in shap semblaunce of a mayden whiche ymage sygnyfyed wysdome knyghthode so this ymage had the eyen terryble cruell for yt that knyghthode is ordeyned to execute rygure of Iustyce also it sygnyfyed yt one knewe lytel often tymes to what ende entendeth entencyon of a wyse man she had heed helmet whiche betokened yt a knyght ought to haue strengthe in vertue also it sygnyfyed yt the counsayles ought to be couerte secrete.
She was clothed wt an haw berke whiche betokeneth ye puyssaunce of ye state of knyghthode it betokened also that the wyse man ought to be alway armed agaynst monyn ges of fortune be it well or euyll she helde a shafte or a longe spere whiche was to say yt a knyght ou ght to be the staffe of Iustyce it sygnyfyed also yt the wyse man pycketh his darte of a grete lengthe.
She had hangynge at her necke a targe or a shelde of crystall whiche betokened that the knyghtes ought to be alwaye wakynge to se clere vpon the defence of the countre and of the people Also it sygnyfyed that vnto the wyse man al thyn ges ben brought and made open.
In the myddes of this targe there was also pourtrayed the heed of a serpent the whiche was named Gorgon the whiche heed betokened and sygnyfyed that a noble and worthy knyght ought to be subtyl and wy ly and watchynge vpon his enemyes as dothe serpent it was also to vnderstande that the wyse man ought to be aduysed of all malyces thrughe whiche he myght be noyed.
Also they put a byrde in one syde of this ymage as for kepe it whiche fleeth by nyght that men calleth a choughe whiche betokeneth that a knyght ought to be as well by nyght as by daye all redy for the defence comu ne if nede be.
Also it sygnyfyed that the wyse man sholde wake at euery houre vpon that that is to hym easye to doo.
This lady was by longe tyme holden by so grete reuerence and so moche wente her renowne that in many places were stabled made temples in her name and in the same wyse longe tyme after that Romaynes were in theyr grete puyssaunce put her ymage amonge theyr other goddes.
CEres whiche was in the ryght olde dayes quene of the royalme of Syculyens had a prerogatyue to fynde by subtylte of wytte fyrst the scyence and vsage of the tyllynge of the erthe of the toles that perteyneth therto.
She tau ght to her subiectes to put togyder to make tame oxen to accustome them to be coupled in ye yoke.
She founde also ploughe shewed them ye maner howe they sholde cleue departe ye erthe and al the laboure therto perteyneth after she taught them to cast the sede vpon ye erthe to couer it after when the sede was growne multyplyed she shewed theym howe they sholde repe the corne with betynge of flayles to put it out of the eres.
After she taught them to grynde it by twene. ij. harde stones by crafte howe they shol de make mylles she taught them after to make brede of the mele also this lady taught to ye peo ple lyued customably as beestes with acornes hawthorne buryes wylde apples to vse more couenable fedynges yet this lady dyde more for the people of countre that had it of custome to dwelle here there in woodes in wylde places voyde as beestes made them to assemble by gre te companyes taught them to make townes cytees howses in the whiche they sholde dwelle togyder thus by this lady worlde was brought out of the beestysshnesse in to the reasonable lyfe of man.
Of this Ceres the poetes fayned the tale howe her doughter was rauysshed by Pluto god of helle and for the auctoryte of her vndersta~ dynge and the grete welthe she had procured to the worlde the people of thens worshypped her called her goddesse of corne.
Of the noble quene that founde fyrste the crafte to make Orchardes and to plan te plantes.
THe same wyse was Isys of so grete te vnderstandynge in the dede of labour that she was not onely named quene of Egypte but ryght syguler specyall goodnesse of Egypcyens.
Of this Isys speketh fable that Iupyter loued her and howe he transfourmed her in to a cowe after howe she came in to her fyrst fourme whiche by sygnyfyenge of her grete vnderstandynge soo as thou haste touched her thyselfe in thy boke of Othea.
She founde dyuers maners of letters abreged that she tought the Egypcyans and gaue them fourme of theyr longe language to abrege it.
This was the doughter of Iuachus kynge of Grekes and syster of Phoroneus whiche was ry ght a wyse man and this lady wente out of Grece for dyuers thynges fell wente in to Egypte wt her brother.
There she taughte amonge other thynges the vsage of orchardes to graffe trees on dyuers stockes she gaue ordeyned certayne lawes and ryghtfull and she tought people of Egypte whiche lyued rudely without ordynau~ ce of Iustyce to lyue by ryght ordre to speke shor tely she dyde so moche lyuynge deed they had her in grete reuerence her renowne wente thru ghe the worlde in so moche that in dyuers places were made temples and oratoryes in her name.
And also at Rome in the tyme of theyr hyghnesse they made a temple in her name where they ordey ned sacrefyses and offerynges grete solempnytees in the maner as they of Egypte were accusto med to doo for her.
The housbande of this lady was named Aprys whiche after the arroure of auncyent people was sone of the god Iupyter of Nyode doughter of Phoroneus of whome the olde hystoryes and poetes maketh mencyon ynoughe.
Of the grete welthe that is come to the worlde by dyuers ladyes.
MAdame haue grete meruayle of that haue herde you saye so moche good sholde come to the worlde bycause of vnderstandynge of woman.
And these men saye comunely theyr vnderstandynge is as a thynge withoute pryce and they haue not serued ne serueth to the worlde but for to bere chyldren and spynne.
Nowe mayst thou well knowe the grete ygnoraunce they yelde no thankynges to them from whom they come.
And also thou mayst se cle rely howe god whiche nothynge dothe without cause hath wyll to showe to men that he dyspray seth not ye woman kynde ne thoughe that he con sydereth that in the brayne of woman there is so grete vnderstandynge that not onely they ben abyle for to lerne and to withholde the scyences but to fynde of themselfe all newe scyences of soo grete vtylyte and profyte vnto the worlde that nothynge is more necessary so as thou mayst se of this Carmentes of whome haue spoken to the founde the letters of latyne to the whiche god hath ben so gracyous so moche multyplyed the scyence ye this lady founde whiche hathe defaced as amonge vs all letters of Ebrue of Grewe that nyghe Europe whiche conteyneth a grete partye space of the erthe vseth of these letters of the whiche there be made compounded infynyte bokes of volumes of al facultees where be put kepte in perpetuall memorye the actes dedes of men and the nobles excellent praysyngees of god all maner scyences and craftes.
So mayst thou conclude that the welthe this woma~ hath done is infynyte.
For by this lady thoughe yt they wyl not knowe it these men are drawne out of yg noraunce put in to knowynge by her they haue crafte to sende theyr courages entencyons as ferre as they wyll haue knowledge vnderstandynge agayne of all thynges that pleaseth them the same wyse to knowe thynges passed present and some that are to come.
And also by scy ence of this woman men may make accorde and Ioyne frendshyppes with persones ferre fro them and by answeres that they gaue that one to that other they fele and knowe theyr wyll without seynge.
And to say shortely all the welthe yt cometh of letters may not be tolde for they dyscryue and make to vnderstande and knowe god celestyall thynges the heuens the see the erthe al persones and all thynges where was there euer man euer dyde more good.
ANd also where was there euer man by whom more welthe happened to the worlde than dyde by this noble quene Ceres of whome haue spoken of to the before whiche may not gete a name of gretter praysynge as to brynge wylde men dwellynge in wodes as beestes with out lawe of ryght to dwelle in cytees townes to teche them to vse ye ryght way to haue pourchaced vytayle of better than acornes wylde apples that is to knowe whetes and cornes by the whiche these men haue the body more fayre more clere and the membres more stronge more mouynge as it were mete more comforta tyfe and more couenable to mannes nature and the lande full of thystles of thornes of busshes euyll set to gyder and full of wylde trees she taught to clense by laboure and to sowe the sede the whiche by the labourynge of ye grounde there as it was wylde it becometh free tame to ye comune profyte so by this lady mannes nature recey ueth that profyte by the whiche the wylde rude worlde was chaunged in to the guyse of good cy tees and townes and the slawstrynge wyttes slowe beynge in the caues of ygnoraunce were chaunged and brought agayne in to hyghnesse of contemplacyon and exersyses couenables and she ordeyned some men to labonre the feldes by whiche so many cytees towne are replenysshed susteyned some to do other necessary werkes to lyue by.
sys the same wyse in orchardes gardynes who may somme the grete welthe that she procured the worlde to gyue the manere to lyfte vp plantes and trees and so many good her bes couenable to nourysshynge of man.
My nerue also that pourueyed by her wytte to mannes nature so many dyuers necessary as clothynge of wolle whiche were before clothed wt skynnes of
Also she put them out of payne that they had to bere all theyr necessary thynges bytwene theyr armes from one place to another and ordeyned and founde the manere to make cartes and charyottes for theyr socoure and to the nobles and knyghtes she founde the crafte the vsage to make harnoys to couer theyr bodyes for the more suretye in the warre more fayre and stronger and more couenable than they had before whiche was onely with the hydes of beestes.
Nowe perceyue by that yt ye saye more than euer dyde the grete vnkyndnesse and vnconnynge of these men that so moche euyll sayth of women for notwithstandynge that it sholde seme that there is cause ynoughe of praysynge of them by that woman is moder to man and al other welthes that one mayese openly that generally women dothe to men.
Truely se nere the ryght hepe of beuety ses and of souerayne largenesse that they haue re ceyned and receyue of them.
Nowe lette them hol de theyr peas from hens torthe these euyll sayenge clerkes of women that haue blamed and spoken shrewdely of women in theyr bokes and dyttyes and other suche and lette them caste downe theyr eyen for shame of that they haue mysse sayd consyderynge the trouthe whiche is contrary vn to theyr wrytynge seynge this noble lady Carme~ tis the whiche by the hyghnesse of her vnderstan dynge hath taught them as theyr maystresse at scole suche a lesson by whiche vnderstandynge they holde them so hyghe and worshypfull that is to knowe the noble letters of latyne yet what shall these nobles and knyghtes say to this thynge so moche agaynst ryght that saythe euyll gene rally of all women lette them refrayne theyr mou thes from hens forth aduysynge vsage, to bere armes in batayle to fyght in ordenaunce of whiche crafte they prayse them holde them gre te all is come to them by women· generally al men that lyueth by brede that lyueth in Cytees and townes by the ordre of ryght.
And also those tylleth the lande haue they soo moche cause to blame women as many of theym dothe thynkyn ge vpon these benefeytes and goodnesses whiche they haue done for them.
And that by these women that is to vndersta~de Myuerne Ceres and Isys there ben come to them so many dyrs profytes of the whiche benefy ses they haue theyr lyfe worshypfully so they ly ue and shall lyue alway.
These thynges ben wel appealed without fayle madame but yet it semeth me that the doctryne of Arystotle whiche was of ryght grete profyte to mannes wytte wherof one holdeth of grete counte and of ryght none of all that other phylosophres that euer were the re is not of so grete profyte to the worlde as haue ben ben by doctryne of these foresayd ladyes.
Of the mayden Arenye that founde the crafte to shere sheepe to dresse the wolles and to make clothe.
NOt onely by these ladyes god hadde lust to pouruey to the worlde many dyuers thynges necessaryes but also in same wyse by many dyuers others.
So as by a mayde of the lan de of Assye that was named Arenye doughter of ydmuete Cholophone whiche was of meruayl lous subtell wytte.
So moche she laboured her wyttes she founde fyrst the crafte to dye wolle in to dyuers coloures to make werkes in clothe as paynters dothe in the manere that we sholde calle clothes of hyghe lyst and in this crafte she was meruayllous subtyll.
And it was she wherof the fable speketh and saythe that she stryued wt Pallas whiche became a flee.
For this was she that founde fyrst the maner of Flaxe maner of werkes to make lynnen clothe whiche thynge semeth to be ryght necessarye to worlde thou ghe that some men say that the exercyse therof be reprofe to women.
This Arenye also founde fyrste to make nettes and craftes to take byrdes and fysshes and founde the crafte of fyss hynge to ta ke and deceyue the stronge wylde beestes and conyes hares byrdes with nettes whiche was not knowne before.
So me semeth that this wo man made no lytell seruyce to worlde by whi che syth men haue founde grete profyte.
Notwtstandynge yt dyuers auctoures and also this Bocace whiche telleth ye foresayd thynges haue sayd that the worlde was better when ye people lyued not but with hawes acornes and they ware but skynnes of bestes then it hathe ben syth whe~ that they were taught to vse others more delycatyfe yet saue the reuerence of the sayd auctoure of all them that shall saye that it is preiudyce to worlde to vse suche thynges that the nourysshynge of mannes body sholde be founde and vsed saye that in so moche that ony creature receyue th more of graces of grete gyftes of god by soo moche is he the more beholdynge to serue hym ye better that yfony creature vse euyll of well god hathe prouyded for hym graunted hym to vse them well couenably made them for the vsage of man woman it cometh of the shrewdenesse and cursydnesse of them that vseth it euyl and not that thynges of hym sholde not be euyl but good to vse. Ihesu cryst hymselfe in his owne persone shewed it wel for he vsed brede and wyne fless he and fyss he robe of coloure of lynnen and of all other thynges necessary whiche had not be done yf it had ben better to vse to eate acornes hawes also he honoured moche the scyence yt Ce res founde that is to knowe of brede whe~ it plea sed hym to gyue to man woman his owne body in fourme of brede and that they sholde vse it.
Of Pamphyle that founde the crafte to drawe sylke of the wormes.
OF scyences good and profytable foun de by women amonge others we ou ght not to forgete the noble le of the countre of Grece.
This lady was of ryght subtyll wytte in dyuers werkes and so moche delyted to serche straunge thynges that she was the fyrst founde the crafte of sylke.
For as she was ryght subtyll and yma gynatyfe she aduysed her of these wormes maketh sylke naturally vpon the braunches of trees So she toke bothomes that these wormes had made and she sawe that they were ryght fayre then she toke many thredes and put theym togyder and twyned them and then she assayed if this threde wolde take ony fayre coloure and when she had proued all this and sawe that it was ryght a fayre thynge she toke it to make and to weue in to clothes of sylke.
For the whiche thynge of the connynge of this woman there is come grete beaute and profyte to worlde multyplyed in all conntres.
For god is worshypped and serued in dyuers arayes therof.
And the noble robes ray mentes of prelates in deuyne offyces ben made therof.
And also of Emperours kynges and pryn ces and the same wyse the people of some landes vseth none other clothynge for that they haue no wolles and they haue ynowe of sylke wormes.
Of Thamar that was a souerayne maystresse in the crafte of payntynge and of another named Irayne.
WHat woldest thou sholde say yf nature of woman be able to fynde and to lerne the speculatyfe scyences and also these hande craftes.
The same wyse it is empropryed to execute the~ and put them in werke ryght subtylly when they haue lerned them.
So as it is wryten of a woma~ that was named Thamar whiche was of so gre te subtylte in the crafte and scyence of payntynge that in those dayes whyle she lyued there was no ne suche as she was in connynge.
This woman as Bocace sayth was doughter to Nyton Peyn tre and was in ye tyme of Olympe.
Olympe was a grete solempne day so called in the whiche there were made dyuers playes and he that gate it sholde be graunted vn to hym yt he asked yt it were a reasonable thynge the whiche feest playes was done in the honoure of Iupyter it was ha lowed from.
vj. yere vnto. vj. yere. iiij. yere free by twene bothe Hercules ordeyned fyrst this feest and of ye fyrst begynnynge yt it was ordeyned they made theyr date.
So as dothe the crysten men of the Incarnacyon of Ihesu cryst.
This Thamar lefte all womens werkes and folowed the crafte of her fader by ryght grete subtelte of wytte in tyme when Archylans reygned vpon the Macedonyes she had synguler praysynge in so moche yt they of the countre of Ephese that there worshyp ped the goddesse Dyane made by grete charge yt this Thamar sholde paynte the ymage of theyr goddesse whiche they kepte longe tyme after in grete dygnyte as a thynge made by grete subtylte and solempnely paynted they shewed neuer this ymage but at the feest solempnyte of ye god desse the whiche payntynge as it endured by ryght grete age bare so grete wytnesse of the subtyl te of this woman that vnto this day there is me mory of her wytte.
In this scyence of payntynge there was also a woman of Grece soueraynly ler ned whiche was named Irane that she passed al those that were in her tyme this woman was a dyscyple of a payntoure called Cracyne whiche was a souerayne werke man yet she was subtyll so moche lerned in the scyence she passed exce ded her mayster so meruayllousiy for the remem braunce of her they lete make an ymage whiche was as a mayden yt paynted they lyfte it for ho noure amonge other ymages of souerayne wer ke men of certayne workes yt had ben before her.
For suche custome had these auncyent men yt they worshypped bothe men women yt passe other in excellence whyder it were of vnderstandynge or of strengthe or of beaute or of ony other grace or vertue yt for to make theyr perpetuall remembrau~ ce they made to set theyr ymages in hyghe wor shypfull places.
Marcya the Romayne yt was also a vyrgyne was of ryght grete vertue in noble lyuynge in good condycyons she was also of noble wytte in crafte of payntynge this woman wrought by so grete crafte so maysterly ye she passed all men the same wyse Gaye Spolyn yt were called moost souerayne payntoures of the worlde in theyr tyme she passed them attayned the worshyp of all yt myght be knowne of yt scyence after that that the maystres sayd.
This Marcya to that entente yt the remembraunce of ye scyence sholde shewe after her amonge her noble werkes she made a table by grete crafte where she paynted her fygure beholdynge her in a myroure so properly euery ma~ sawe it Iuged it to be on lyue the whiche table ryght longe syth was soue raynely kepte she wed to werke men as a treasoure of solempnyte.
Then sayd to her mada me by this ensample one may perceyue yt in olde tyme these wyse people were more worshypped than they be no we the scye nces holdeth in moche more pryce yet to the purpose of that yt ye saye of women experte in scyence of payntynge.
knowe at this day a woman yt men calleth Ana stase ye is so moche experte lerned to make vyny ettes of enlumynynge in bokes chasynge hysto ryes yt there is mencyon made of ony werke man in towne of Parys yet there ben suche in yt tow ne yt ben called soueraynest werkemen of worl de but yt she passeth them ne yt so swetely maketh flourysshynges as she dothe and this knowe by experyence for she hathe wrought for myselfe dyuers thynges whiche ben holden syngulersby themselfe amonge the vynyettes of other werke men.
Of yt byleue the well fayre doughter for thou mayst fynde women ynowe whiche ben wel experte in dyuers thynges who yt wol de serche aboute in the worlde and yet to same purpose shall telle the of a woman of Rome.
SEmproyne of Rome was a woman of gre te beaute yet notwithsta~dynge yt the shap of her body of her vysage passed in her tyme all other women in beaute yet she passed exceded in excellence of subtylte of her wytte ye whiche she had so redy yt there was nothynge soo subtyll in worde nor in werke but anone she wolde haue it so hooly yt she wolde not fayle but as her lyste she wolde reporte it all yt she had herde saye thoughe it were ryght a grete narracyo~.
This lady knewe not onely the latyne letters but Grekyss he also entyerly wrote them so wyttely yt it was grete meruayle to se.
Also of speche faconde of fayre manere so comely so gentyll yt by her wordes maners she coude drawe ony persone to she wol de yf she wolde or lyst to prouoke them to solace or Ioye to wepe or to sorowe in same wyse she coude moue euery man therto other to hardynes or to ony dede of strengthe or to lerne ony other thynge she coude styre them therto she had spoken with them.
And with that so moche she was of maner of speche and of countenaunce and ful of courtoysye and of swetnesse that one sholde ne uer be satysfyed to beholde her here her she songe so melodyously and by grete crafte played in all instrumentes soueraynly she coude all maner of playes and to saye shortely she was ryght able and wytty to do al maner of thynges yt man nes wytte myght comprehende.
Here Xp~ine asketh of Reason yf naturall prude~ ce be in woman.
Madame truely se well yt it is true that god worshypped be he hath gyuen vnderstandynge to woman comprehensyfe in all thynges to vnderstande knowe to holde yet for yt that one seeth people ynowe yt haue ryght subtyll wytte redy to fele to vnder+stande all yt one wolde showe them ben so subtyl in felynge retentyfe yt there is no scyence but yt it be open ynoughe to them whiche by hauntyn+ge of the scole geteth ryght grete clargye.
And neuerthelesse there ben many also yt be of grete repu+tacyon amo~ge clarkes full of scyence yt haue but lytell wysdome in maners in worldely gouernaunce wherof haue grete meruayle for it is no doubte that the introduccyon of scyence techeth good co~dycyons vertues.
So wolde knowe ryght fayne of you my lady yf it pleased you if the vnderstandynge of woma~ whiche is ynoughe as me semeth by your proues that se it by takynge retentyfe in subtyll thynges scyences as others ben but wolde wyte yf theyr vnderstandynge be prompte abyle in thynges yt prudence techeth is to knowe to haue aduyse vpon yt whi+che is best to do of that yt ought to be leest reme~braunce of thynges passed by whiche one maye be more experte by yt ensample yt one haue wyse syght in gouernaunce of present thynges that one haue pourueyaunce vpon thynges to come.
Answere thou sayst trewe doughter but this prudence of whiche thou spekest knowe yt it come+th by nature to man woma~ to some more to some lesse not to allyke howe be it that she dothe so moche yt naturally they ben prudent.
For thou mayst knowe yt two strengthes togyder ben more more resystynge tha~ is euery strengthe by hymselfe.
And therfore saye to the yt euery persone yt by nature hathe prudence that is called naturall wytte with that connynge gotten to yt persone bryngeth hym to praysynge of grete excellence yet suche hathe one as thou thyselfe hathe sayd yt another hath not.
For that one is the gyfte of god other is goten by longe studyenge yet they ben bothe good but some sooner shall chose naturall wytte without scyence goten tha~ goten with scyence and neuertheles vpon this preposycyon the re may many opposycyons be founde of the whiche maye sprynge questyons ynowe for one myght say that he dothe well to chose the more whiche is moost auaylable or profyte in the comune nede and it is so that to knowe scyences it profyteth a synguler persone and more to all persones by the shewynge that he dothe to others that all sholde not do of naturall wytte that he sholde haue.
For this naturall wytte maye not endure but durynge the lyfe of the persone that hathe it and when he dyeth his wette dyeth with hym but the Scyence that is goten endureth perpetually for euer to theym that hathe it for to knowe in praysynge and it profyteth vnto many people in soo moche that they do teche it vnto others and maketh bookes vnto theym that ben to come.
So as may shewe ye by ensample of Arystotle of others by whiche the scyences were brought to ye worl de profyteth more to worlde the connynge go ten of them than dothe all prudence without scy ence goten of all yt men passed or those yt ben.
Not withstandynge yt by prudence many dyuers royalmes Empyres hathe ben well gouerned and dressed yet al these thynges ben faylynge gothe with these men scyence endureth euer.
But yet this questyon shall leue vnassoylled to determyne to others.
For it draweth not to the purpose of strengthynge of our cyte and shall tourne agayne to the questyon that thou hast made to me that is to knowe yf there be natural prudence in woman of the whiche thynge answere soo that thou mayst knowe by that yt is sayd to the be fore.
So as thou mayst se generally by the gouer naunce of them in offyces that are put to them to do yf thou take hede it shall seme good.
Thou shalte fynde that to gouerne theyr housholde and to pouruaye for it in all thynges after theyr puyssaunce they ben comunely and for the moost partye ryght curyous quycke and dylygent in so moche that theyr neglygent housbandes thynketh yt it is grete anoyaunce to them yt they busy them so moche to do that that perteyneth to them to pour uaye and then they saye that they wolde be maystresses and more wyse than they.
And thus they wolde tourne it in to euyl that yt many wome~ say to the~ in good entente of these wyse women spe keth epystle of Salamon of whiche substau~ce after our purpose wyll say yt it foloweth so.
WHo shall fynde a stronge woman yt is to say wyse her housbande shall not faute of all good.
She is praysed of all ye countre her housbande truste th her wel for she yeldeth hym al wel the and prosperyte in all tymes she seketh pour chaseth wolles that is to vnderstande werke to kepe her meyny profytable werkes to garnysshe her she herselfe put her handes to the busynesse and she is as a shyp of a marchaunte yt bereth all manere of goodes and pouruayeth for brede.
She gyueth her gyftes to them yt ben wor thy and those ben her counsayllours.
And all haboundaunce of meetes drynkes spryngeth also to her seruauntes.
She consydereth the value of a maner or she bye it.
And by yt werke of her wytte she hath planted vynes with the whiche her hous holde is pouruayed.
She gyrdeth her raynes wt strengthe and constaunce of busynesse and her ar mes ben in contynuall good werke she seeth that her busynesse is good therfore she contynueth it And for so moche yt the lyght of her laboure shall neuer be quenched what darke tyme that cometh She busyeth herselfe in stronge thynges with that she dysprayseth not womens workes but she herselfe worketh it.
She stretcheth her handes to the poore feble in theyr socoure her house by her pourueyaunce is kepte from al maner of coldnes of snowe those yt she hath to gouerne ben clothed in double robes.
She maketh for herselfe robes of sylke of purple of worshyp of renowne her housbande is worshypped when he is set with ye fyrst auncyent men of ye erthe.
She maketh cloth lynnen wollen yt she selleth her clothynge is strengthe worshyp for that Ioye perpetuall shal be to her her mouthe speketh alway wordes of wysedome the lawe of buxomnesse is in her tongue.
She consydereth the prouysyons of her house she eteth not her brede ydell.
The condycyons of her chyldren sheweth yt she is theyr moder the werke of them sheweth her goodnesse.
She is maystresse of her doughters in al thynges thoughe they be grete she dysprayseth false praysynges and vayne beaute.
Suche a woman shall drede our lorde shall be praysed. and she shall yelde her fruyte after her werke whi che prayseth her in all places.
TO the purpose yt the epystle of Salamon sayth of a wyse woman maye well be remembred the noble quene Gay Cyryle.
This lady was of Rome or of Constaunce and maryed to a kynge of ye Romaynes.
She was of prudence in the dede of gouernaunce ryght vertuous.
And with the grete naturall wyt trouthe bounte yt she had aboue all women she was praysed to be ryght a grete vyander of notable pourueyau~ ce thoughe she were a quene myght well leue to werke with her handes yet she had ye herte alwaye to profyte in some thynge noo tyme to be ydle but alway laboured in some werke the same wyse she made ye ladyes damoyselles aboute her to laboure in especyall those yt serued her.
She founde ye maner to sorte wolles to make fyne clothe of dyuers sortes in yt she occupyed her whiche is for ye tyme a ryght honourable thyn ge by whiche this noble lady in all places was praysed worshypped by whiche for ye reuerence memory of her the Romaynes whiche after encreased in ryght grete puyssaunce whiche in her tyme were not ordeyned maynteyned the custo me yt to the weddynge of her doughters when the spouse sholde entre fyrst in to ye house of her housbande one asked howe she sholde be named she answered Gaye that gaue to vnderstande yt she wolde folowe this same lady in dedes in werkes after her puyssaunce.
Here it speketh of the aduyse of Dydo quene of Cartage.
PRudence so as thyselfe hast sayd befo re is to haue aduyse a beholdynge vpon thynges that one wyll take on hande howe yt they sholde be determy ned and yt women sholde be in suche respecte aduysed in grete matters.
shall gyue ye yet ensample of some puyssaunt ladyes fyrst of Dydo.
This Dydo was fyrst named Elyxa the connynge of her prudence shewed well by her wer kes as shall tell ye.
She founded edyfyed a cy te in ye lande of Auffryke named Cartage of ye whi che she was lady quene the maner of yt foundynge to gete ye lande to possede it shewed in her grete constaunce noblesse vertue without whi che to haue by grace veray prudence maye not be in ony persone.
The comynge of this lady was of them of Fenyce whiche of ye last partyes of Egyp te came in to ye lande of Syrye there they founded buylded dyuers noble townes and Cytees Amonge ye whiche people there was a kynge called Agenor of ye whiche descended by lygnage the fader of this lady dydo whiche was named Beel was kynge of Fenyce he put the royalme of Cypre vnder his subieccyon.
This kynge had one sone named Pygynalyo~ this mayden Dydo wt out mo chyldren when he came to the dethe he charged gretely his barons yt they sholde bere to these.
ij. chyldren loue trouthe so to do they ma de promyse to hym.
When ye kynge was deed they crowned Pygynalyon his sone wedded Elyxe whiche was ryght a fayre mayde to a duke of the countre whiche was grettest after ye kynge was called Acerbe Cyte or Cytens.
And this Cyteon was the grete preest of the temple of Hercules after theyr lawe and was a meruayllous ryche ma~ And so he and his wyfe loued moche togyder and ledde a good lyfe.
But this kynge Pygynalyon was of shrewde condycyons cruell the moost coueytous persone that one myght se for he coude not haue so moche but he wolde coueyte more Elyxe his syster whiche knewe well his grete coueytyse and also she knewe well that her housba~ de had grete treasoure and there was grete spekynge of this rychesse she counsaylled and aduysed hym that he sholde kepe hym from the kynge and sholde put his goodes in some secrete place to that entente that the kynge sholde not take it awaye.
Cycyens byleued well this counsayle yet he kepte not well his persone from the awaytes of the kynge as she had tolde hym.
So the kynge made hym to be slayne on a daye to the entente yt he myght haue his grete treasoures of the whiche dethe Elyxe had so grete sorowe that she was nere hande deed and was longe tyme in wepynge and wayllynge soro wynge pyteously her hus bande and her lorde cursynge her cruell brother that made hym to dye.
But the false kynge that founde a wyle of his opynyon whiche was for yt that he had founde lytell or nought of the goodes of Cytens and bare grete rancoure to his syster.
And she whiche sawe well yt she was in grete peryll of her lyfe was warned by her prudence to le ue her owne countre to go thens.
This thynge reme~bred she toke aduyse in herselfe by vertuous courage of yt she sholde do armed her with stren gthe constaunce to put in effecte yt she wolde take on hande.
So this lady knewe well yt the kynge was not welbyloued of his lordes nor of his people for ye grete crueltyes extorcyons yt he dyde so she toke to her certayne lordes cytesyns also of ye comune people after yt that she had ma de them swere yt they sholde holde it in counsayle suche thyngesas she wolde deuyse to them she by ryght fayre language began to declare her enten te so moche yt they accorded to go with her ther to they made theyr othe to be trewe faythfull.
So this lady as soone as she myght made redy her nauye all secretly by nyght she departed wt al her grete treasours foyson of people with her she charged gretly her maryners to employ the~ to go.
More gretter malyce dyde this lady for she knewe well yt her broder as soone as he knewe of her goynge wolde sende people after her secretly she made fylle grete males grete fardelles of thynges of noo valewe but they were heuy as it had ben grete treasoure to yt entente yt in delyuerynge these foresayd males fardelles to them yt her broder wolde sende after it sholde let her passe not to hurte her goynge whiche thynge came all to ye poynte for they were not longe, gone but grete foyson of people came from ye kynge sewyn ge after her to haue arested her but the lady wel wysely spake to them sayd that she wente in her pylgrymage so they letted her not but when this lady sawe this excusacyon wolde not aduayle she knewe wel yt he wolde nothynge wt her but to haue her treasoure, she sayd yt she wolde sende it to hym with a good wyll and those yt knewe wel that they wolde do theyr payne to contente ye kyn ges appetyte to apease kynge then ye lady wt a sorowfull chere as thoughe she toke sorowe for it made to be delyuered all these males bagges to them.
And those yt trowed verely ye they had do ne well theyr deuoyre they sholde brynge Ioy full tydynges to the kynge departed from her the quene without makynge semblaunt of yt thou ght on her goynge as soone as she myght they wente so longe by day by nyght yt they aryued in ye Ile of Cypre there they refresshed them a ly tell whyle anone after she toke her shyppes whe~ she had done her oblacyons vnto ye goddes and she brought with her ye preest of Iouys his wyfe all his housholde he had dyuyned before yt the re sholde come a lady of ye partyes of Phenyce for ye whiche he sholde leue his countre sholde go wt her.
Thus they wente lefte behynde them ye lan de of Grece the lande of Cecyll in ye ryght hande they sayled longe by ye lande of so moche yt they aryued in Ausryke there toke ye lande and anone came ye people of ye countre to se manere what people they were when they sawe ye lady her people they brought plentye of les the lady spake to them ryght frendly sayd yt for the grete welthe ye she had herde say of yt coun tre she was come thyder to dwell there yf it pleased them they answered yt they wolde well and ye lady yt made semblau~t yt she wolde make no grete dwellynge vpon a straunge lande requyred the~ to selle to her vpon ye see coste so moche lande onely as ye hyde of an oxe wolde enclose there to make dwellynge places for her her people the whiche thynge was graunted to her and the couenauntes the pryce sworne bytwene them.
The lady then whiche shewed her wyt grete prudence made to take an hyde of an oxe made to cutte it by ye smallest thonges yt myght be made knytte the~ togyder all on lengthe after made to stretche it vpon ye grounde all aboute see coste whiche con teyned a meruayllous grete countre of ye whiche thynge ye sellers were meruayllous sore abasshed meruaylled moche of ye cauteyles of this woma~ not for yt yet they must holde theyr pryce· thus this lady gate this lande in Auffryke in ye sayd fortakynge there was smyten of ye heed of an horse by whiche heed by ye crye the flyght of byr des they vnderstode after theyr dyuynynge in yt cyte that sholde be founded there sholde be in tyme to come men of warre wyse in armes.
Then this lady sente anone all aboute to seke werkeme~ opened her treasoure made to buylde a Cyte meruayllous grete fayre stronge whiche she named Cartage the towre of ye dongeon she called Byrse whiche is to say ye hyde of an oxe so as she bega~to buylde her cyte she herde tydynges of her broder whiche manaced her gretely all were in her company for bycause she had mocked hym of ye treasoure but she answered to ye messangers yt the treasoure was good fayre yt she toke to bere to her broder but yt by aduenture those yt brought it toke it awaye put in stede of some false thynges or yt it myght well be for ye vengeaunce of ye dethe of her housbande ye goddes had no wyl yt he yt slewe hym sholde reioyce his goodes ther fore they haue chaunged it.
But as for the manasynge she thought by the helpe of her goddes she sholde defende her from her broder then she ma de to call all those yt she had brought thyder wt her sayd to them yt she wolde not yt they sholde abyde wt her agaynst her courage ne yt by her sholde come encombraunce to them by ye whiche yf they wolde tourne home agayne all or some of them she wolde restore the~ for theyr laboure sende the~ forthe they answered all with one voyce yt they wolde lyue dye with her wtout partynge all the dayes of theyr lyues.
Then departed the messangers, ye lady as moche as she myght busyed her to perfourme her whe~ it wasal made she or deyned lawes to ye people for to lyue after ryght Iustyce thus she gouerned so notably by gret prude~ce yt in al cou~tres wente her renowne euery ma~spake of her not onely for the grete vertue yt was in her but as moche for hardynesse of ye fayre entrepryse yt she had made for the grete prudent gouernau~ce they chaunged her name called her Dydo whiche is as moche to say in latyne as Ui rago is to saye she yt hath vertue strengthe of man thus she lyued gloryously a grete whyle longer had done if fortune had ben fauourable to her but as she often tymes enuyous to them that ben in prosperyte dyste~pered to her an harde drau ght of drynke at the last so as here after in tyme place shall tell the.
OPys or Ops yt syth was called goddesse moder of goddes was of ye auncyent people had in reputacyon as ryght a wyse woman for yt that after ye sayenge of the olde hystoryes ryght prudently constauntly she coude holde her contente amonge ye prosperytees aduersytees yt happened to her in her tyme.
This lady was dou ghter of Urane yt was ryght a puyssaunt man in Grece of Uesta his wyfe whiche was ryght rude lytell knowynge of ye worlde and this lady Opys or Ops was wedded to Saturnus kyn ge of Crete whiche was her broder.
So this kyn ge had a vysyon yt his wyfe sholde be delyuered of a ma~ chylde yt sholde slee hym for to voyde this foresayd destenye he ordeyned that all ye men chyl dren yt the quene sholde haue sholde be slayne yet for all yt this lady dyde so moche by her wytte whi che founde suche cauteyles yt she respyted her thre sones from ye dethe yt is to knowe Iupyter Neptunus and Pluto and she was gretely worshyp ped syth and her wysedome praysed and for her vnderstandynge and for the auctoryte of her chyl dren she gate in her tyme so grete voyce and wor shyp in the worlde yt the lewde people of the coun tre called her goddesse and moder of goddes.
For her'sones in theyr lyuynge was counted for goddes for yt they were in some thynges more knowynge then other men that were all as bestes.
So there were ordeyned and sacryfyed temples the whiche opynyon the foles kepte longe tyme and the same wyse at Rome in the tyme of the prosperyte of the Romaynes was this folye then had this goddesse in grete reuerence.
LAuyne whiche was quene of the La rynes had also praysynge of pruden ce.
This noble lady was descended of this Saturnus kynge of Crete of whome we haue spoken was doughter of the kynge Latyn and after Turnus the kynge of Turylyens coueyted to haue her to wyfe but her fader whiche had answere of ye god des that she sholde be gyuen to a lorde of Troye whiche taryed the maryage longe tyme not with sta~dynge yt his wyfe laboured ye contrary when Eneas was in Italy he asked leue of the kynge Latyne to descende vpon his lande but he gaue hym not onely yt leue but he graunted hym his doughter in maryage.
And for this cause Tur nus moued warre agaynst Eneas in the whiche was grete slaughter kynge Turnus was slay ne hymselfe.
And Eneas had ye vyctory and wedded Lauyne that had syth a sone by hym of whome she mas grete when Eneas dyed.
But when it cae that she sholde be delyuered for the grete drede that she had that a sone that Eneas had of another woman whiche chylde was named Asta nyus that for couetyse of reygnyge sholde not slee the chylde that she was delyuered of.
She wente was delyuered in a woode and gaue the chylde a name Iulyus Syluyus.
This lady wolde neuer after be maryed and she gouerned her in her wydo whode ryght prudentely and maynteyned the royalme by grete wysedome and her sone in lawe had her in so grete loue yt he had none euyll wyll agaynst her nor his broder.
But after that yt he had buylded the ryte of Alba he wente to dwel there Lauyne gouerned the lande ryght wysely tyll the chylde was growne of the whiche chylde came Remus and Romulus whiche founded Ro me and the hyghe Romayne prynces that came syth. what woldest thou that sholde saye mo re dere doughter me semeth that haue brought for the proues ynowe to myne entente that is to vnderstande of that she we by quycke reason ensample that god hathe not had ne hathe in reprobacyon the femynyne vse as these men haue so as thou seest clerely.

[Figure: AFter the wordes of the fyrst lady that was named Reason.
The seconde la dy drewe her towarde me the whiche was named ryghtwysnesse thus sayd to me.
Dere frende ought to drawe me abacke nor to bellowe to buylde to make the stone worke with thy helpe in cyrcuyte of ye cloystre of the waile nowe made by my syster Reason of the cyte of Ladyes.
Nowe take thy toles and come before and tempre thy morter in eue ry corner and buylde on fast with the foote of thy penne.
For shall delyuer ynoughe wherof by vertue of god we shall haue good buyldynge hyghe palayces royal noble mansyons of these excellente ladyes of grete worshyp and renowne che shal be lodged in this cyte shal abyde perpe tually fro hens forth.
The~ IXp~ine herynge wor de of this worshypfull lady sayd in this manere Ryght excellente lady se me here all redy.
No we co~maunde for my desyre is to obeye she layd to me thus.
Frende beholde these fayre stones more fayrer than ony precyous stones shynynge whi che haue sought for ordeyned them, redy to lodge them in the semeth yt haue ben ydle whyle my syster Reason you haue ben busy Or set them a rowe after my lyne yt thou seest here by the ordynaunce yt shall tell the.
Amonge the ladyes of souerayne dygnyte maye well be put in the rowe ofhyghnesse the hyghly fulfylled of Sa pyence the wyse Sybelles the whiche as olde an tentyke auctours put in theyr wrytynges were. x. by nombre thoughe some put but. ix. my dere frende take hede here what more worshyp in dede of reuelacyons dyde god euer to a prophete that he loued more than he gaue and graunted to these ryght noble ladyes of whome speke to the dyde not he sende in to them holy spyryte of prophecy so moche it semed not onely of that they sayd that it sholde be a pronosty cacyon of tyme to come but it semed as it were of cronycles of thyn ges passed and came so moche that they were cle rely vnderstandynge in theyr thynges wryten also of the comynge of our lorde Ihesu Cryst whi che came ryght longe tyme after they spake more clerely as it is founde than dyde al the prophetes These ladyes vsed al theyr lyues in mayden hode dyspraysed pollucyon and all were named Sy belles and it is not to vnderstande it was theyr propre names but Sybelle is to say as knowyn ge the thought of god and so they were called for that that they prophecyed meruayllous thynges that it was conuenyent that they sayd sholde co me to them of the pure thought of god.
So it is a name of offyce and no propre name.
These ladyes were borne in dyuers countres of the worlde and not all in one tyme and all they prophecyed grete foyson of thynges to come and in especyall of our lorde Ihesu Cryst and of his comynge soo as it is sayd ryght clerely thoughe that they were al paynymes not of the lawe of Iewes whiche that tyme was the lawe of god.

The thyrde of engendred in the temple of Appolyn was named Delphyca.
And this lady preched the destruccyon of Troye longe tyme before Ouyde put many verses of her in his boke.
This lady answered to them of grece of thynges they demaunde her that Troye and ylyon the stronge castell sholde perysshe by them and Omere shol de wryte lesyngly also she was called Erytell for she dwelled in Ile and there were her bookes founde.

Ca. ij. AMonge other Sybelles Eryte had the gretest prerogatyue of wysdome.
For of her the vertue was so grete by a synguler a specyall gyfte of god yt she wrote prophecyed dyuers thynges to come so clerely yt it semed better to be a gospell than prophecye at the request of the grekes she put theyr laboures clerely in wrytynges theyr ba taylles the destruccyon of Troy yt it was neuer clerer after it was done than it was before.
The same wyse she descryued and put to gyder in fewe wordes true Empyre the lordshyp of the Ro maynes theyr dyuers aduentures longe tyme before it was come soo it semed better to be a shorte remembraunce of thynges passed than of thynges of tyme to come.
And a more greter dede she dyde a more meruayle for she prophecyed opened playnely the secretenesse of the thought of god yt was neuer opened by the prophetes but by derke wordes and couerte.
That is to knowe the holy ghost the mystery of the Incarna cyon of the sone of god in mayden Mary.

Also Cassandra ye noble mayde of Troye doughter to kynge Pryamus of Troye syster to the worshypfull Hector she was so grete a clarke yt she knewe all ye craftes was also a pro phete.
For this mayde wolde neuer take ma~ thou ghe it had ben a grete prince she had in spyryte yt was to come she was euer full of sorowe heuy nesse when she sawe ye grete prosperyte of Troy so gretely flourysshed in magnyfycence before warre began bytwene Troyans the grekes she made moche sorowe wepte sore beholdynge ye noblesse rychesse of ye cyte her fayre worshyp full bretherne specyally ye noble Hector yt was so worshypfull a man she myght not holde her peas for the grete sorowe yt was to come.
And whe~ she sawe ye warre begyn tha~ began her sorowe so she seased not to crye wayle counsayled her fader and her bretherne to make peas with the grekes or elles without fayle with warre they sholde be destroyed but they toke no charge of all her wordes nor byleued her alway as she gretely play ned of good ryght this grete losse damage my ght not be styll by whiche often tymes she was bete~ of her fader of her bretherne sayd she was a fole but for al she wolde not holde her in peas to dye therfore ne spared not to speke wtout seasyn ge.
For whiche to make her holde her peas they made her to be shytte in a chambre to put awaye her noyse from theyr eeres yet it had ben better they had byleued her for it happened to them as she had tolde them before.
So they byleued at the ende then it was to late for them so it happeneth ofte tymes a fole wyl neuer byleue a thyng tyll he haue it.
Also was it not a meruayllous Pronosty cacyon the quene Basyne made had ben wyfe of the kynge of Thorynge syth was wyfe to Chylderyke iiij. kynge of Fraunce so as the Cronycles conteyneth it.
For hystory sayth the nyght of weddynge of her of kynge Chyl deryke she sayd to hym he sholde holde hy~ chast nyght he sholde se a meruaylous vyspon.
And then she sayd to hym anone after he sholde ryse go to the dore of the chambre and not well that that he sholde se.
The kyuge wente thyder it semed hym that he sawe grete bestes that men call Unycornes Leopardes and Lyons that wente came by the palays so he retourned agayne all aferde and demaunded quene what that sholde sygnyfye she answered hym that she wolde tell hym in the mornynge and that he sholde haue no drede but to go thyder agayne soo he dyde.
And it semed hym that he same grete beres wolues wolde renne one vpon another.
The quene sente hym agayne the thyrde tyme and hym semed that he sawe dogges and lytell beestes eche of theym dyspysynge other.
And as the kynge was moche adradde of this thynge.
The quene tolde hym the aduy syon of the beestes that he had sene whiche sygnyfyed dyuers generacyons of prynces sholde reygne in Fraunce that sholde come of theym whiche theyr condycyons and theyr dedes sholde drawe after nature of those beestes that he had sene.
Soo thou mayste clerely se fayre loue howe our lorde hathe made open often tymes his secretes to the worlde by women.
THat was noo lytell secrete that god shewed by reuelacyon of a woman to Iustynyan whiche was syth Em peroure of Constantynoble as hystoryes telleth.
This Iustynya~ was keper of the treasours coffers of the Emperoure Iustyne.
It happened in a day that as this Iusty nyan was gone to dysporte hym in feldes and had brought with hym to be his comforte a woman that he loued moche whiche was called Anthony and when the houre of nyght was come that this Iustynyan had luste to slepe and layde his heed in his louers lappe.
And when he was on slepe then Anthony sawe a grete Egle come flyen ge ouer them whiche payned hym to come downe to kepe the vysage of Iustynyan fro brennynge of the sone with his wynges.
And when he was awaked she reasoned with hym by fayre wordes and sayd.
Fayre swete loue haue loued you moche and loue you as hym whiche is the mayster of my body and of my loue as ye knowe wel.
So it is no reason that a louer wel loued of his loue ought to denye her nothynge.
And for that wolde requyre you in rewarde of my maydenhede and of my loue but one gyfte the whiche thoughe it be ryght grete to me it shal seme to you but ryght lytell yf ye wyl graunte it me.
Iustynya~ answered to his loue that she sholde requyre hym hardely and that she sholde fayle of nothynge he myght graunte her.
My loue gyfte that requyre of you is this that when ye shal be Emperour ye haue not in dyspraysyng your poore loue Anthony but she may accompanye her wt your worshyp wt your Empyre by true maryage so to promyse me right anone whe~ Iu+stynyan had herde the damoysell thus speke he began to laughe trowynge that she sayd it in Iape.
And as he helde it as a thynge impossyble to hap pen to hym promysed her without fayle he wolde take her to his wyfe when he sholde be Emperoure so he sware by al his goddes and then she thanked hym hertely and in token of this promyse she gaue hym her rynge and he gaue his to her.
brynge the tydynges certaynly that thou shalte be Emperoure and that it shall be in shorte tyme.
So it passed not longe tyme after that as the Emperour Iustyne had assembled his hoost to go vpon them of Perce a sykenesse toke hym thrughe the whiche he dyed.
And as after the prynces ba rons were assembled to chose a newe Emperoure they myght not wel accorde it happened that in maner of dyspyte of another they chose Iustynya~ to be Emperour the whiche slewthed not but as soone as he myght ryght vygorously with a grete hoost ranne vpon these Percyens wanne ba tayle toke the kynge of Perce conquered there grete good worshyp when he was retourned home to his palays Anthony his loue forgate not but she myght to entre by grete subtylte there where he sate his trone wt his prynces she kneled before hym began her reason sayd she was a mayde was come to hym to aske ryght reason of a had betrouthed her had gyuen her his rynge taken hers.
The Emperoure whiche yet thought not on her answered her and sayd if that man had betrouthed her reason wolde that he toke her and yf she myght proue that she sayd yt she sholde haue ryght and that he sholde take her.
And then Anthony drewe the rynge from her fynger and shewed it to hym and sayd.
Noble Empe roure maye proue it by this rynge beholde it yf thou knowe it.
Then the Emperoure sawe well yt he was taken by his wordes yet not for yt he thou ght to kepe his promyse.
And anone he made her to be ledde into his chambre to araye her in noble garmentes and toke her to wyfe.
Ca. vii. MAdame by that that vnderstande se openly the grete ryght of women agaynst that of whiche they be so mo che accused maketh me to knowe bet ter frome hense forthe the wronge of theyr accusers.
And yet maye not holde me styll of a comune custome yt renneth amonge these men And in the same wyse amonge some women that the comune custome is this that when these women be with chylde and be delyuered of a mayde chylde the husbandes ben wrothe with it often ty mes and chydeth for that his wyfe was not dely uered of a sone.
And theyr nyce wyues whiche ought to haue souerayne Ioye of that that god hath saufely delyuered them thanke hym with good herte they troubled themselfe also for yt theyr hous bandes ben troubled with it.
And madame frome whens cometh that they be wrothe be the doughters of more preiudyce than sones or be they of lesse loue to theyr fader moder lesse charge to them than be the sones.
Dere frende for that that thou demaundest me cause whens it cometh answere the certaynly that that come+th of ryght grete symplenesse and ygnoraunce to them that troubleth them so.
Notwithstandynge that the pryncypal cause that moueth them therto is for ye cost of theyr goodes yt they must vnpurse laye out when they be in the age of maryage.
And also some dothe it for that they doubte ye perylles yt they maye be deceyued by euyll counsayle in symples but al these causes in regarde be of no reason For as touchynge the doubte that they do foly the+re ben but fewe but they enfourme theyr chyldren when they ben yonge and lytell and that ye moder gyueth them good ensamples bytwene themselfe in honeste and techynge.
For yf the moder were of a foly lyfe it sholde be lytell ensample to the dough+ter and that she be kepte from euyll company and holden shorte in tyme of youthe it is the prerogatyue to good condycyons all her lyfe.
Item as to the cost trowe yf the fader and moder beholde well that yt the sone cost them as to make them to lerne scyences or crafte as to holde them in estate and also in superfluous despenses in lewde companyes and in many nycetees trowe they sholde fynde but lytel aduauntage in sones more than in doughters.
And the wrathe and sorowe yt they cause often tymes theyr faders moders to haue as in folowynge of dyssolute lyfe so moche grefe and cost to theyr faders moders trowe it sholde passe the sorowe that they haue for theyr dough ters.
Beholde how many sones thou shalte fyn de that haue nourysshed swetely and mekely theyr faders and moders in theyr age so as they ought to do.
And thoughe ye fader and moder make as moche of theyr sones as theyr goodes when they be wexen myghty and ryche and theyr fader poore they wyll dyspyse hym and they wyll be wrothe shamefull when they se hym.
And yf theyr fader be ryche they wyll desyre his dethe to haue his good.
All be not suche but there be many of them and whan the sones be maryed god knoweth the gre te coueytyse that they haue alway to drawe from ye fader and moder and they wolde not recke thou ghe they sholde dye for hongre so that they myght haue al.
And where as ye moder abydeth wedo we and where as they ought to comforte her and to be staffe and berer vp of her age they wyll crye on her tyll they haue drawne from her that yt she hath And yf she wyl not gyue them ynoughe after theyr entente they wyl haue no conscyence to moue plee ayenst her.
Of suche sones there be ynowe some doughters haply also.
yet if thou take good hede trowe thou shalte fynde sones more shrewysshe to the fader and moder than doughters.
And yet put case that all were good it is comunely sayd doghters holde better company to the faders and moders than the sones.
And more vysyteth comforteth and kepeth them in theyr sykenes and ege The cause is this for that yt the sones trauaylleth more vp and downe in the worlde here and there and the doughters be more coye and holde theym more nyghe so as thou mayste se thyselfe.
For notwithstandynge that thy bretherne were ryght na turall of grete loue they be gone in to the worlde and thou alone arte abydynge to kepe company wt thy good moder ye whiche is a souerayne comforte in her age.
And for that saye to the in conclusyon that they be more foles that troubleth theym and be wroth when they haue borne doughters.
And for that that vpon this purpose thou hast put me wyl tell the of some women of whome amonge other the hystoryes wryteth whiche were ryght kynde vnto theyr fader and moder.
Here it begynneth to speke of doughtes yt loued fader and moder and fyrst of Drypetrue.
OF grete loue to her fader was Drypetrue quene of Laodocye she was doughter to the grete kynge Mytrydaces And she loued hym soo moche yt she folowed hym in all bataylles.
She was of a straunge shappe in some thynges for she had a double rewe of tethe whiche was a grete deformyte but she was of so grete loue to her fader yt she te hy~ neuer nother in {pro}+speryte ne euyll fortune And thoughe she were a quene and lady of a grete lande by the whiche she myght well be at rest and ease in her countre she was in euery place partycy pante of all the paynes and trauayles that her fader had in many dyuers armyes there as he was And when he was ouercomen of the grete Pompee she lefte hym neuer but serued hym by grete charge and dylygence.
Ca. ix. ISyphyle put her in peryll of dethe to saue her fader whiche was named Thoant and was kynge of Leuydynyens.
And as his countre rebelled ayenst hym and with a grete woodnesse came to the palays to sle the kynge.
Isyphyle ano ne hydde hym in one of her coffres.
And after she lepte out to appease the people but auayled her nothynge and as they sought the kynge all abou te and myght not fynde hym.
They put the poyntes of theyr glayues ayenst Isyphyle and manaced her of dethe yf she wolde not tell them her fader.
And with that they promysed her if they myght knowe by her where he was they wolde crowne her quene and they wolde obaye to her.
But she whiche coueyted more lyfe of her fader then to be quene ne was not aferde for drede of the answered them with an hardy courage and without sygne of ony drede that without fayle he was fledde a grete whyle before.
And at that they myght not fynde hym and that she so surely affermed them that he was fledde they byleued her and crowned her quene a whyle she reygned peasybly vpon them.
And she yt a lytel whyle had kepte her fader secretely for drede at the last yt by some enuyous persone he might be accused put hym out by nyght and sente hym by see to another place with grete goodes but as this thynge was at the last opened to the vntrue Cytezyns they cha ced theyr quene Isyphyle out of the royalme wol de haue slayne her yf her grete goodnesse had not kepte her.
Ca. x. AS a sygne of grete loue shewed the mayden Claudyne to her fader then when by the good dedes of hym and by ye grete vyctoryes that he had had in many bataylles retourned hym vyctoryously was receyued at Rome in the souerayne worshyp that they called tryumphe whiche was a ryght grete worshyp in whiche they receyued princes whe~ they retourned ouercomers of ony grete dedes.
Soo this same fader of Claudyne whiche was one of the prynces of Rome ryght worshypfull beynge in this honoure of tryum phe was assayled by another of the lordes of Rome that hated hym.
But when Claudyne his dou ghter whiche was sacred to the goddes Besta as we say here a relygyous of some abbay and was with the ladyes of her ordre that were gone to the processyon agaynst this foresayd prynce so as the custome was herde the noyse and knewe yt her fa der was assayled of his enemyes.
Then the grete loue that the doughter had to the fader made her forgete al the symple behauynge that a relygyous woman sholde haue comonly.
Also she put backe all drede and· fere in suche manere that anone she lepte forthe and wente flyenge thrughe the prece and boldely wente amonge the swerdes that she sawe vpon her fader and toke hym by the throte yt she sawe nexte hym and to her power toke strongly vpon her to defende her fader there prece was so grete that anone the medlynge was departed.
Then as the worshypfull Romaynes had of custo me to set moche by euery parsone dyde ony worshypful acte of meruayle praysed gretely this may den and gaue her grete laude of that she had done.
Here it speketh of a woman that gaue her moder sowke in the pryson.
Ca. xi. ORete loue also had a woman of Rome to her moder of whome the hystoryes speketh.
It happened that sayd moder for a certayne cryme that she was attaynted of was condempned to per petuall pryson.
And that none sholde gyue her ney ther mete nor drynke by the whiche in this maner she sholde fynysshe her lyfe.
The doughter co~stray ned of grete loue beynge sory for this condempnacyon requyred them that kepte the pryson of a specyal grace that she myght vysyte her moder euery daye whyle she was on lyue to that entente that she myght counsayle her of pacyence.
And shortely to saye so moche she employed and prayed that kepers of the pryson had pyte on her and grau~ted her yt she sholde vysyte her moder euery daye.
But or she sholde go to her that she bare with her no vy tayle.
And when this vysytacyon had endured by so many dayes that it was impossyble to the Iay loures yt the woman prysoner myght lyue so longe naturally without mete yet was not dede and consydered yt none other vysyted her but her doughter whiche they serched ryght dylygently or she sholde go in to her moder they meruaylled ryght strongely what that myght be.
And on a day they spyed the moder the doughter togyder whiche was lately desyuered of a chylde then they sawe her gyue the tete to her moder so moche tyl she had al and thus the moder drewe mylke of the pappes of her doughter.
And thus the doughter yelded to the moder in her age that yt she had taken of her in her youthe.
This co~tynuell dylygence grete loue of doughter to moder moued the Iaylours to grete pyte and they reported it to the Iuges then of manly compassyon they delyuered the moder to the doughter.
Also to the purpose of loue of the doughter to fader one may say of ye good wyse Grysylde whiche syth was marquyse of Saluce of whome shall telle hereafter the grete vertue stablenesse and constaunce.
howe true loue hath nature gyuen vnto her to be so busy to serue her fader Ianycle so humbly and obeysauntely in his sykenesse and in his age that she in her clennesse vyrgynyte in floure of her youthe nourysshed and gouerned so dylygentely by the laboure and the crafte of her handes getynge with grete charge and busynesse the poore lyfe of theym bothe.
in a good houre were those doughters borne of su che bounte and so grete loue to theyr fader moder.
For notwithstandynge that that they do that they ought to do yet they gete grete meryte to the soule grete praysynge is gyuen them of worlde and in the same wyse to the sones that ben of co~dycyon.
what woldest thou that sholde say more coude tell ye ensamples ynowe of lyke case but ynoughe suffyseth.
Here ryghtwysnesse sayth that she hathe accheued the stone werke of the Cyte and it is tyme to people it.
Ca. xij. NOwe me semeth ryght dere frende our buyldynge is well lyfte vp of our Cyte of Ladyes and hyghe masonry al alonge the large stretes and the royall palayces stronge buyldynges of dongeons and defensable towres lyfted ryght hyghe that it maye be sene a farre.
Soo it is tyme fro hensforthe that we begynne to people this noble cyte to yt entente that she be not waste nor voy de but enhabyted of ladyes of grete excellence for we wyll none other people.
howe fortunate shall cytezynes of our cyte be for they shall haue no nede to haue drede nor doubte to be dyslodged of theyr possessyon by strau~gers.
For this is propryete of our werke the owners shall not nede to be put out.
And nowe there is a newe femenyne royalme bygon but it is moche more worthyer than that other was.
For it shall nede yt the ladyes lodged here goo out of theyr lande for to conceyue ne brynge forthe newe heyres to maynteyne theyr possessyon by dyuers ages fro lygne to lygne.
For it shall suffyse ynoughe for euer of them yt we shall put in it nowe for this is destyne of them yt they shall neuer dye.
And without fayle they shall abyde in the same age beaute and fresshnesse be they yonge or that we shall put therin.
Dame Iustyne my syster shall come after yt shall brynge thyder quene aboue all other women moost excellent accompanyed wt pryncesses of grete dygny te whiche shall enhabyte moost hyghe places hyghe dongeons.
For it is good reason when quene shal come thyder that she fynde the cyte gar nysshed peopled of noble ladyes that sholde receyue her with grete worshyp as theyr souerayne lady Empresse of all theyr kynde yet what cytezyns shall we put there shall they be vnstable women or defamed certaynly nay but they shal be al worshypfull women of grete auctoryte.
For mo re fayre people ne more grete aray may not be in a cyte than good women worshypfull.
Nowe ryse leefe frende nowe put the in busynes and go before and lette vs seke them.
Here Xp~ine asketh of dame ryghtwysnesse yf be true these bokes these men sayth yt the lyfe of maryage is harde to bere for ye occasyon of wome~ to theyr grete wronge.
And ryghtwysnesse answereth begynneth to speke of the grete loue of women to theyr husbandes.
THen in goynge to seke the fore sayd ladyes by ye ordynaunce of dame ryghtwysnesse in go ynge sayd these wordes ma dame wtout fayle ye reason haue assoyled concluded soo wel so fayre my questyons demanndes can not replye no more holde me ryght well enfourmed of yt sought.
And by you two haue lerned ynoughe howe al thynges able ought to be done lerned as moche in strengthe of bodyes as in wysdo me of vnderstandynge yf al vertues be possyble to be executed by women.
But yet pray you ye wolde telle certyfye me yf it be true these men say so many auctours bereth wytnesse thrughe the whiche am in ryght a grete thought the ly fe of ordre of maryage be to men heuy enuyron ned of so grete tempest by blame importunyte of women of theyr rauenous grefe as it is wry ten in many bokes people ynowe wytnesseth it.
and that they loue theyr husbandes and theyr com pany so lytell yt nothynge noyeth them so moche by whiche to voyde suche inco~uenyences many haue counsayled wyse men yt they mary not certefyenge yt fewe of them be true in theyr partye also walere wryteth to Ruphyn Theophrastus in his boke sayth yt noo wyse man ought to take a wyfe for there is but lytell loue in a woman but grete charge Ianglynge.
And yf ye ma~ do it to be better serued kepte in his sykenes more better more truely a true seruaunt shall kepe hym ser ue hym shal not cost hym so moche.
And yf wo man be syke husbande is in grete sorowe dare not speke one worde nyghe her.
And ynoughe of suche thynges he telleth whiche sholde be to longe to reherce wherfore say myne owne lady that yf these thynges be true these defaultes be so grete yt all ye grace vertues yt they may haue be brought to nought and quenched.
Certesdere frende so as thyselfe hath sayd somtyme to pur pose yt one may lede a processe well at his ease that pledeth without partye.
And promyse the that· bokes that so sayth women made them not.
But trowe yt he yt wolde make a newe booke yt were true of the debates of maryage yt he were enfour med of trouthe one sholde fynde other tydynges Alas dere frende howe many women be there as thou knowest thyselfe yt vseth theyr wery lyfe in bande of maryage by the hardnesse of theyr husba~ des in more greter penaunce than they were escla ues amonge the sarazynes.
Ha god howe many harde betynges without cause reason howe ma ny vylanous wronges outragyous bondages suffreth many of these good and worshypfull women whiche all crye not out an harowe and suche yt dye for hungre and for mysease theyr husbandes ben at the tauerne and in other dyssolute places and yet poore women shall be beten at theyr comynge home and that shal be theyr souper.
And to say yt these husbandes ben ony thynge sorowful for the sykenesse of theyr wyues.
And without that say more to the thou mayst knowe well yt these sclaundres sayd agaynst women who so saythe it they were be thynges founde sayd of vyolence ayenste trouthe.
For the husbandes ben maysters ouer the women not women theyr maystresses so they wolde neuer suffre suche auctorite of theyr wyues But promyse the yt all maryages be not maynteyned in suche contentes it were grete damage.
For there ben some that lyueth in peasyblenesse lo ue and trouthe togyder by that that partyes be good dyscrete and reasonable thoughe it be not of euyll husbandes.
There ben ryght good worshypfull and wyse and that the women that meteth with them lyueth as to the glory of worlde in ryght a good houre for them.
And thou mayst well knowe by thyselfe that thou haddest suche one that in thy Iugement none other man passed hym in al bounte peasyblenes trouthe good lo ue of the whiche the sorowes of yt that dethe toke hym away from the shall neuer parte from thyne herte.
And thoughe that say to the and it is trou the that there ben many good women ryght euyll ledde by theyr dyuers housbandes.
Knowe it for trouthe yt there be many dyuers women shrewde cruell and cursed without reason.
For yf sholde say that all were good lyghtly myght be proued a lyer.
But in lesse partye and of that partye whiche be good medle me not.
For suche euyll women ben as thynges out of theyr nature.
But for to speke of those that ben good for yt that this Theofrastus of whome thou hast spoken sayth yt also truely and as busely shall a ma~be kepte in his sykenesse or in his nede by his seruaunt as by his wyfe.
howe many good women ben there so bu sy to serue theyr husbondes hole or syke by true loue as they were theyr goddes.
trowe that one shal not fynde but fewe suche seruauntes.
And for that that we be entred in to this matter shal gy ue the many ensamples of grete loue and trouthe of women borne to theyr housbandes.
And nowe we be thanked be god retourned to our Cyte with a noble company of worshypfull women that we shall lodge there.
And se here this noble lady que ne Hypsytrace wyfe sometyme of the ryche kynge Mytrydaces for that yt she is of olde tyme and her valure of grete dygnyte we shall lodge her fyrst in the noble palays that is arayed for her.
HOwe myght there be crea ture of gretter loue to another than was ryght fayre good and true Hypsytrace to her hus ba~de.
She was wyfe of the grete kynge Mytrydaces whiche gouerned cou~tres of. xxiiij. langua ges.
And thoughe it so were that this kynge was myghty puyssaunt.
The Romaynes moued ryght harde warre agaynst hym but in all tyme yt he laboured by grete charges in bataylles where yt euer he wente his good wyfe lefte hym not thoughe that this kynge after maner of Barbaryne had dyuers concubynes.
Neuerthelesse this noble lady was alway embraced in parfyte loue in suche maner yt in no wyse she suffred not that he sholde go without her where she was ofte tymes in bataylles with hym in peryl to lose his royalme and in aduenture of his lyfe ayenst Romaynes.
But when he sholde go in to a straunge regyon or in to a ferre countre or passe the see or destres and peryllous forestes he wente neuer but she was al way his ryght true felawe without departynge.
For she loued hym of so parfyte loue yt she thought yt no man sholde serue her lorde so clenly ne so well as she sholde.
And agaynst that yt the phylosophre Theofrastus sayth touchynge this matter.
This lady for that yt she knewe yt often tymes kynges prynces haue false seruauntes wherof foloweth false seruyce.
She as a true louer to yt entente yt she myght mynystre al necessaryes conuenable thyn ges to her lorde thoughe it so be yt she suffred grete payne she wolde alway folowe· hym for so moche that to suche a dede the habyte of a woman is not conuenable nor it is not expedyent that a woman so nyghe a grete kynge soo noble a fyghter in batayle sholde be sene to that entente that a ma~ sholde seme to smyte of her yelowe heres as golde whiche to the apparellynge of a woman is a thyn ge ryght well semynge.
But with yt she spared not fayre fresshnesse of her vysage but ware her helme vnder the whiche she was ofte tymes soylled and full of and duste and her fayre body softe vsed the harneys and habergyon hosed wt yron and the precyous rynges the ryche orname~ tes put a parte.
In stede of whiche she bare in her handes axes harde speres bowes and arowes· stretchynge aswerde.
And in this maner this noble quene gouerned her by strengthe of grete loue and true and thus she chaunged the tendernes of her fayre body and yonge whiche was wonte to be cheryss hed softely and delycately and she lyued after the manere of a stronge armed knyght.
sayth Bocaca that wryteth this story what is that that loue causeth not one to do when she that had it of custome to lyue so delycately to lye softe to haue al thynges at her ease and nowe demea ned by her free wyll as it were an harde man and a stronge lyenge day and nyght in mountaynes and valays in the desertes and in forestes often tymes vpon the bare erthe for drede of enemyes in euery syde of her wylde beestes serpentes.
But all this was swete to her to be alwaye nyghe her husbande for to comforte hym counsayle hym serue hym in all his nedes.
And yet after when she had suffred to endure longe tyme many harde trauayles.
It happened that her husbande was dyscomfyted ryght cruelly by Pompee prynce of the hoost of the Romaynes so that he was constrayned to fle. yet when he was forsaken of al his owne people and lefte alone his good wyfe lefte hym neuer but rennynge after folowed hym by hylles valays by forestes by many strayte passages and he whiche was forsaken of all his frendes had noo maner of hope yet was he comforted by his good wyfe whiche counsaylled hym swetely to haue hope of better fortune.
And the more that he and she were in grete trybulacyon the more she payned herselfe to do hym solace to reioyse hym by the swetnesse of her to entente to appease his malancoly by goodly playes that she coude fynde by the whiche thynges and by grete swetenesse of her so moche she comforted hym that in euery mysery yt he suffred in all his trybulacyons she ma de hym so to forgete it that he sayd often tymes yt he was not in exyle but hym semed that he was ry ght delycyously in his palays wt his true spouse.
Ca. xv. RIght lyke to the foresayd quene in ca se and in true loue towarde her husbande was the noble Empresse Try ayre wyfe of Lucyan Urylyan Empe roure of the Romaynes.
She loued hym of so grete loue that she folowed hym in euery place and in all bataylles armed lyke a knyght alway ryght nyghe hym and fought ryght strong ly whereof it happened on a tyme that this Emperoure had warre with Uaspasyan bycause of the lordeshyp of the Empyre.
And whan he sholde go ayenst a Cyte of Uolques and sholde do by nyght that he sholde entre in to the towne he founde the people a slepe he wente vpon them cruelly.
But this noble lady Tryayre whiche all the nyght had folowed her husbande and was not ferre fro hym but alway desyrynge that he myght haue the vyctory of the batayle alwaye in harnays the gyrde aboute her fyghtynge ryght fyersely in the rowte nyghe her husbande nowe here nowe there by the darkenesse of the nyght hauynge no drede nor fere but that she bare her so worshypfully that she had ye pryce of the batayle aboue al others and dyde many meruayles.
So it shewed wel as Bocace sayth grete loue she had to her husban de in prouynge the bande of maryage yt other wol de so moche reproue.
OF ladyes that haue loued theyr husba~des of grete loue shewed it in dede may say yet of noble lady Archemyse quene of Carye that as it is sayd befo re folowed kynge Mansole her husbande in many grete batayles tyll he came to de the.
And she outraged wt so grete sorowe as moche as ony creature myght bere yf she shewed it well in his lyfe that she loued hym wel she dyde no lesse in the ende.
For in makynge all the solempnytes yt was in vsage there as moche as myght be made for a kynge with grete company of prynces of barons made brenne the body of her housbande wherof she herselfe gadred the asshes quenchynge them with her teeres and put them in a vessell of golde.
So she semed that it was no reason that asshes of hym that she had loued so moche sholde haue other scpulture than herte the body where the rote of this grete loue was and therfore she dranke the foresayd asshes by successyon of tyme medled wt her drynke by lytel and lytel tyl she had taken all yet notwithstandynge yt for the remembraunce of hym she wolde let make suche a sepulture whiche sholde be alway for hym a perpetuall memory and to make it she spared no treasoure so she made to seke certayne werke men that coude deuyse make meruayllous werkes in buyldynge that is to knowe Scope Bryaxe Thymothe and Leothayre whiche were werke men of grete excellence and the quene sayd to them yt she wolde haue a sepulture made for the kynge Mansole her lorde moost solempne that kynge or prynce myght haue in worlde.
For she wolde yt by the meruayllous werke the name of her husbande sholde endure alwaye.
And they sayd that they wolde do it ryght well.
So the quene made them to seke sto+nes of marble ynowe and of Iasper of dyuers colours and all that euer they wolde aske.
The ende of the werke was suche that the foresayd werke men before the cyte of Elycarnase whiche is the mayster Cyte of Carye lyfted vp a grete werke of marble stone wrought by entayle ryght nobly.
And it was made square in euery squarenesse it was of. lxiiij. fote.
C. and. xl. fore And yet it was more meruaylous.
For al this gre+te buyldynge was sette vpon. xxx. grete pyllers of marble.
And eche of the. iiij. werke men wrought by stryfe one with another wherof werke was so meruaylous that it gaue not onely remembrau~+ce of hym that it was made for But it was meruayle of the subtylnesse of the werke men.
The fyrst werke man to perfourme this werke was called Itrayre made the hyghnesse of the sepulture to be lyfted vp by. lx. degrees.
And after ca me the syxte werke man named Pychys the whiche wrought a charyote of marble and set it in the hyghnesse of the buyldynge.
This werke was soo meruaylous that it was called one of the. vij. mer uayles of the worlde.
And in so moche that it was made for the kynge Mansolee the werke toke his name and was called Mansolee.
And for that yt it was the moost solempne sepulture that euer was made for kynge or for prynce.
All other sepultures of kynges and prynces haue ben called syth mansolees.
And thus appered wel in dede and in sygne that the true loue dured all the whyle she lyued.
The grete loue proued that Argyne had doughter to Adrastus kynge of Arge towarde her housbande Polymyte.
what is he that dare saye yt there is but lytel loue in a woman to warde her husbande yf he consyder well this lady.
This Polymyte that was the husbande of Ar gyne stryued with his broder Ethyocles for bycau se of the lordeshyp of the royalme of Thebes. whiche perteyued to hym by certayne couenauntes yt were made bytwene them but as Ethyocles wol de not in no maner wyse graunt hym the royalme Polymyte his broder moued warre agaynst hym to the helpe of whome kynge Adrastus came with al his power yet fortune tourned shrewdely ayen ste Polymyte whiche slewe his broder his broder hym in batayle.
And the hoost bode not longe on lyue but onely the kynge Adrastus and slewe ye thyrde parte of his people.
But when Argyne kne we that her husbande was deed in batayle.
She departed and all her ladyes with her out of cyte of Arge and forsoke her royal see.
And of that that she dyde Bacace saythe in this manere.
The noble lady Argyne herde say that the body of Polymyte her husbande laye vnburyed amonge the bodyes and caraynes of the comune people that there we re slayne.
Anone she full of sorowe lefte the habyte and ornamentes the noblesse and swetnesse of her courte to dwelle in her chambres worshypfully arayed and with that by grete desyre the brennynge of loue surmounted and ouercame the feble nesse and womanly tendrenesse.
And so moche she wente by her Iourneys tyll that she came to yt pla ce where the batayle had ben on the whiche waye she had no fere of the busshmentes nor of the way tynge of her enemyes ne was neuer wery of long nesse of the way.
And she came in to the felde dredynge not cruell bestes ne ye grete byrdes sewynge the deed bodyes ne wycked spyrytes whiche after the lykenesse of dyuers fowles flyeth aboute deed bodyes.
And whiche is a thynge more meruaylous as Bocace sayth she doubted not the pre cepte nor the commaundement of kynge· Creonce whiche had co~maunded and made crye vpon the payne of losynge of theyr heedes that none sholde vysyte nor bury those bodyes whose soo euer they were.
For she was not come thyder for to obey to that co~maundement but as sone as she was ary ued whiche was aboute nyght she lefte not for no stynkynge yt came out of caraynes but wente with a grete brennynge a sorowfull courage vnderset the bodyes nowe one nowe another sekynge for hym yt she loued so moche nowe here nowe there and thus she seased not tyll that with the lyght of a lytell bronde offyre that she helde in her hande she knewe her ryght entyerly beloued husbande and so she fou~de that she sought.
sayd Bocace the meruaylous loue the brennynge desy re and the affeccyon of women.
For as the face of her husbande for rustynesse of his harnoys halfe eten all full of stynkynge all forbledde full of dust charged with foulenesse all pale blacke whiche was as at that tyme vnable to be knowen myght be hydde from this woman so brennyngly she loued hym thus stynkynge of the body the foule nesse of the vysage myght not let her but that she kyssed hym and embraced hym straytely bytwene her armes.
Notwithstandynge the precepte co~mau~dement of kynge Creonce she spared not but yt she cryed with an hyghe voyce.
Alas alas haue fou~de hym yt loued so moche then she wepte with grete plente of teeres.
For as she knewe by often tymes kyssynge his mouthe yt there was no lyfe in hym and had wasshed hym wt her teeres al stynkynge often tymes by grete cryes wepynges waylynges called vpon hym fynably as she sawe yt the soule was departed fro body made to lyght vp a grete fyre so as it was the maner there of buryenge of kynges of grete states to that en tente she wolde do ye last pyteous offyce put hy~ in the fyre wt many sorowfull cryes of whome she gadred the asshes ryght derely in a vessel of golde And when she had done al this as she yt wolde ad uenture her body to the dethe for to venge her hus bande dyde so moche put to suche payne with ye helpe of other ladyes wherof there was grete qua~ tyte the walles of the cyte of Thebes were ouerthrowen gate the towne put all to dethe.
WEll ought to be put amonge these no ble ladyes of grete loue to theyr housbandes noble lady Egryppyne dou ghter of Marke Egryppyne of Iulye doughter of the Emperour Octauyan lorde of all the worlde.
And as this noble lady was gyuen in maryage to Bermanyce the ryght noble prynce well manered wyse and an encreaser and multeplyer of the comune profyte of Rome.
Tybere Emperour whiche was of euyll condycyons toke suche enuye of the welthe that he herde of Bermanyce husbande of the sayd lady Egryppyne and of that yt euery man loued hym that he lete make watche vpon hym hym of whose dothe his good wyfe had suche sorowe she wolde in lyke wyse be slayne and that semed ryght wel.
For she withdrewe not to say grete vy lanyes to Tybere For the whiche he made her to be beten tourmented cruelly and put her in pryson.
But as she that the sorowe of her housbande myght not forgete loued better the dethe than the lyfe purposed neuer to ete nor drynke but this pur pose came to the tyraunt Tybere to tourment her longer and wolde constrayne her by tourmentes that she sholde ete but it auayled not.
So he wol de by strengthe make to caste the mete in to stomake.
But she shewed well to hym that he hadde puyssaunce to make folke to be slayne but not to kepe them from dethe yf they wolde.
Here Xp~ine speketh and ryght wysnes answereth gyuynge ensamples of the noble lady Iulye doughter of Iulyus Cesar wyfe of ye prynce Pom+pee.
WHen that my lady ryghtwysnes sayd to me these wordes.
Madame truely it seme th me to be grete honoure to the kynde of women to here tell of so many excellent ladyes.
And amon ge other vertues of them ought to be ryght agrea ble to al people so grete loue may be in ye herte of a woman in bonde of maryage.
Nowe let them slepe and holde theyr peas this Matheolus and all other Ianglers that enuyously and lyengly ha ue spoken agaynst women.
But madame yet me thynketh the phylosophre Phylostratus of who me haue spoken here aboue sayth that these women hateth theyr husbandes when they be olde also yt they loue not these connynge men be clerkes.
For he sayth that the charges hat one ought to haue in daungers of women the studyenge of bokes ben contrary togyder.
dere frende holde thy peas haue anone founde ye ensamples contrary to theyr sayenge by the whiche we shal holde them as no sayenges true.
Iulye was in her tyme the moost noblest of the ladyes of Rome doughter of Iulyus Cesar whiche was sy th Emperoure of Rome and of Coruylle his wyfe comynge downe fro Eneas of Troye.
This lady was wyfe of Pompee ye grete conqueroure whi che as Bocace sayth in ouercomynge the kynges in puttynge downe in makynge agayne of other in puttynge vnder subieccyon dyuers nacyons in destroyenge theues of the see hauynge the fauoure of Rome of all the kynges in the worlde in crettynge the lordshyppes not onely of landes but also of see and caues by meruayllous vyctoryes in souerayne worshyp was than waxen olde and sore brused.
But not for that the noble lady Iulye his wyfe whiche was but yonge as yet loued hy~ of soo grete loue she ended her lyfe by a straunge aduenture.
For as it happened in a day that Pom pee had deuocyon to gyue praysynge to goddes he had goten by noble vyctoryes and wolde do sa crefyse after the custome of that countre.
And as the beest sacryfyed was vpon the awter Pompe as by deuocyon helde hym by that one syde his robe was soylled with the blode yssuynge oute of the wounde of the beest wherfore Pompe dyde of his robe sente it home by one of his seruauntes for to brynge another clene fresshe.
So it happened by an euyll fortune he bare robe mette with Iulye wyfe of Pompe whiche when she sawe ye robe of her lorde so soyled with blode then for that yt she knewe wel yt dyuers tymes it happe ned in Rome yt to them that were the best one wol de renne vpon hym for enuye sle hym wherwith she was supprysed sodaynly by the sygne that she sawe of certayne byleuynge yt it had happened soo to her husbande by some fortune by whiche suche sodayne sorowe toke her at the herte that as she yt wolde no longer lyue she beynge grete with chylde fell flatte to the erthe pale and styffe the eyen tourned in her heed that there myght noo remedy be had soo sone to put her oute of that drede but yt she yelded vp the spyryte whiche dethe by reason ought to be grete sorowe to the husbande.
But it was not onely preiudycyable to hym nor to Romaynes but it was also to all the worlde of tyme.
For yf she her sone had lyued grete werre had neuer ben was syth bytwene Iulyus Cesar and Pompe whiche warre was preiudycyable to all the londes of the worlde.
THe fayre and good Tyerce Emulyene wyfe of prynce Scypyon fyrste Affrycan hated not her husbande also thoughe he were olde.
This lady was of grete prudence ryght vertuous as her husbande was olde she yet fayre notwithstandynge he laye with a bonde woman whiche was her seruaunt so often it fell this worshypfull lady perceyued it.
She not withstandynge her herte was sorowfull ye vertue of her grete vnderstandynge and not onely of passyon of Ialousye.
For she dyssymyled so wysely her husbande ne none other herde her ne uer speke of it.
For she wolde not telle it to hym for that he sholde seme it were shame to hym she sholde reproue so wyse so grete a ma~ as he was to make mencyon therof to other.
For shol de be a maner of repreffe losynge of praysynge so wyse a man ayenst honoure of his persone whiche had conquered so many royalmes Empyres.
Soo she neuer lefte hym this good lady· to serue hym truely to loue hym and worshyp hym.
And when he was deed she made the mayden fre and wedded her to a free man.
Then truely madame to this purpose ye ye saye haue sene often tymes women in lyke case whiche for ony thynge yt they knewe wolde not saye thoughe they knewe well that theyr husbanddes had them but in lytell loue and yet they loued them and made them good chere releued them and comforted them of whome they had chyldren before.
And also haue herde say of a lady of Bry tayne that lyued but late was countesse of Coemen whiche was in the floure of her youthe fayre aboue all the ladyes.
And by her grete goodnesse and constaunce she dyde the same.
Capitulo. xxj. VAncyppe the ryght noble lady a woman of grete connynge and bounte so she had to husbande grete phylosophre Socrates.
And notwithstandynge that he was in grete age that he had grete charge to serche and tour ne the bokes to pourchace for his wyfe softe thynges and curyous the worshypful woman lefte ne uer to loue hym but trowed that it was so grete a thynge the excellent vnderstandynge the grete vertue of hym and of his constaunce that she had hym in souerayne loue reuerence.
And whe~ this woman knewe yt her husbande was condempned to ye dethe by them of Athenes for that yt he blamed them yt they worshypped the ydolles sayd yt there was not but one god that ought to be worshyp ped serued.
This noble lady myght not haue pa cyence of this thynge but fledde her heere hangyn ge aboute her chekes full of sorowe wepynge betynge at the palays gate where her housbande was and there she founde hym amonge the false Iuges whiche hadde taken to hym a venymous drynke to shorten his lyfe and when it came to poynte yt Socrates wolde put cuppe to his mou the to drynke the venyme she wente to hym with a grete wrathe and raced the cuppe out of his han de and threwe it all togyder on the erthe but Socrates repreued her counsayled her to haue pacy ence and comforted her.
And when she myght not let hym in no wyse fro yt dethe she sorowed strong ly and sayd.
Ha what harme and what losse is it to make so Iuste a man to dye wrongefully synfully.
And Socrates alway comforted her sayd to her it was better he sholde dye wrongfully then ryghtfully and so he passed.
But the sorowe ended not in the herte of her that loued hym so mo che all her lyfe.
THe ryght wyse phylosophre Seneke notwithstandynge yt he was ryght olde al his entent was in studyeng it fayled not but he was well byloued of his wyfe fayre yonge whiche was named Pompee Paulyne.
All the charge yt this noble lady had was to serue hym kepe hym in peas as she yt ryght truly derely loued hym whe~ she knewe yt ye tyrau~t emperour Nero to who~ he had ben mayster had condempned hym to dye to be drowned in a bayne fatte then as she yt became out of herselfe sorowe as she yt wolde fayne dye with her husbande wente cryenge many vylanyes to the tyraunt Nero to the entente yt he shol de stretche his cruelte vpon her also.
But all that auayled her not so moche she sorowed the dethe of her housbande yt she lyued not longe after.
And Xp~ine sayd then to the lady yt spake to me.
Certes madame your wordes hathe remembred me and drawne to mynde many other women fayre and yonge ryght perfytely louynge theyr husbandes notwithstandynge yt they were ryght feble olde And in my tyme haue sene ynowe yt haue loued theyr husbandes perfytely hath borne them true loue all whyle they lyued namely noble doughter of one of ye grete barons of Brytayne yt was gyuen by maryage to ryght worshypfull consta ble of Fraunce syr Bertram Claquyn the whiche notwithstandynge yt he was ryght lewde of shap of his body and olde this noble lady beynge in the floure of her youthe whiche toke hede more to the grete pryce of his vertue then to the facyon of his body loued hym of ryght grete loue so moche yt all her lyfe she had plente of sorowe for his dethe.
And ynowe of other lyke myght telle whiche that lette passe for shortuesse of tyme.
Answere of le ue the ryght well and yet shall tell the of mo ladyes louynge theyr husbandes.
SUlpyce was wyfe of Lentylyus Co~sulyennole a man of Rome whome she loued of so grete loue as it appered.
For when he sholde be condempned by the Iuges of Rome for certay ne thynges of whiche he was blamed to be sente wretchedly into exyle there to vse his lyfe poore ly.
The good lady Sulpyce notwithstondynge yt she was in Rome of ryght grete rychesse myght abyde in ease reste loued better to folowe her hus bande in his pouerte exyle than abyde in habou~ daunce of rychesse without hym.
So she renou~ced all her herytage goodes countre dyde so moche yt she stale away fro her moder cosynes whiche kepte her for the same cause yt she sholde not go away.
And in an vnknowne wede dyde so moche yt she wente to her housbande.
Certes madame it semeth me by that ye say of some wo men that haue sene in my tyme in lyke case.
For of suche haue knowne of whom the husbandes haue become lyppers that it were conuenyent yt they were departed fro the worlde and put in syke houses.
But theyr good wyues euermore for that they wolde not leue them loued better to goo wt them for to serue them in theyr sykenesse to holde them the true faythe promyse in maryage tha~ to byde without theyr housbandes well at ease in theyr houses.
And trowe knowe one that is yonge fayre and good of whome the housbande is had in suspeccyon of suche sykenesse.
But as her frendes hath warned her preched to her to leue his company to dwell with them she answered that the dayes of her lyfe she wolde not leue hym.
And yf they make it to be proued yt he is ataynte of ye sayd maladye by whiche it is co~uenyent yt he for sake ye worlde yt without fayle she wolde go with hym.
And for that cause her frendes haue lefte it to make a proffe therof.
Also other women knowe that leue to be named for that yt by aduenture sholde dysplease them whiche yt haue housbandes so cursed of so an vnordynate lyfe that fader the moder of the woman wolde yt they were deed And dothe all that they may for to withdrawe the women to them from theyr shrewde husbandes but they loue better to be bete~ with many paynes to be in grete pouerte and subieccyon with theyr husbandes then for to leue them.
And they saye to theyr frendes ye haue gyue~ me to hym with hym shall lyue and dye and these thynges be sene all daye but all people consydereth it not.
Here it speketh of dyuers ladyes that respyted theyr husbandes fro the dethe.
OF many women also in the same wy se as those before sayd of grete loue to theyr husbandes wyll tell you yet.
It happened after that yt Iason had ben in Coltos to gete the gol den fleece that some of his knyghtes that he brou ght with hym whiche were of a countre of Grece that is called Menudye lefte theyr owne countre and Cyte and wente to dwelle in another Cyte of Grece that is called Lacedemonye soo they were there gretely receyued and honoured as moche for theyr auncyent noblesse as for theyr rychesse.
And there they maryed the moost noblest maydens of ye Cyte.
And so moche they waxed ryche and mounted in worshyp that they lyfted vp themselfe in so grete pryde that they wolde make a conspyracyon ayenst the soueraynes of the Cyte and so they dyde to haue the lordeshyp.
So theyr ymagynacyon was knowen wherfore all were put in pryson condempned to the dethe.
And they assembled them togyder as for to make theyr sorowes.
So it was counsayled amonge them yf ony way myght be founde howe they myght delyuer theyr husbandes.
And in the ende this was theyr conclusyon that in a nyght they sholde araye them in lewde gownes they sholde couer theyr heedes wt mantellesas thoughe they wolde not be know ne.
And in suche a wyse they wente to the pryson soo moche they prayed with wepynge gyftes to the kepers of the pryson yt they wolde suffre them to go se theyr husbandes.
And when they were wt theyr husba~des they gaue them theyr lewde gow nes toke those gownes yt they were clothed in.
And syth put them out of the pryson and kepers trowed yt it were the women had tourned agay ne.
And when it came to the daye yt they sholde dye the kepers brought them to ye tourment.
And whe~ it was sene yt they were women eche of them had grete meruayle of theyr wyse cauteyle.
Soo they were gretely praysed and the cytezynes had pyte of theyr doughters so there dyed none.
And so the se worshypful women delyuered theyr husbandes fro the dethe.
Here Xp~ine speketh to dame ryght wysnesayen ste them that sayth that women can not kepe noo counsayle.
Capitulo. xxv. MAdame knowe certaynely nowe also haue perceyued that grete is loue and the trouthe that many haue had and hath to theyr husbandes And therfore haue grete meruayle of a language renneth comunely amonge these men.
And also mayster Iohn~ de Meun affermeth it so strongly in his romaunce of rose and other auctours also dothe it that what a man say the to his wyfe it maye not be kepte pryue and that women can not holde theyr peas.
Dere frende thou oughtest to knowe that all women be not wyse and the same it is of men by the whiche yf a man haue ony wytte he ought well to aduyse hym what wytte his wyfe hathe and what good nesse or he saye ony thynge yt he wolde haue kepte close for therof myght come foly.
But when a ma~ knoweth that he hath a good wyfe wyse and dys crete there is nothynge more trusty in the worlde nor so moche may comforte a man.
For dyscrecy on and secretenesse are too be commended in ony persone.
And yet to ye purpose of women louynge theyr husbandes.
There was late a man in Rome ryght notable named Brutus whiche was mary ed to a gentyl woman named Porcya this noble Porcya was doughter of Chaton the lesse whiche was neuewe to grete Chaton.
Her foresayd housbande Brutus felte that his wyfe was ryght wy se secrete and chaste tolde her his entente that he and Cassyen another noble man of Rome were in purpose to sle Iulyus Cesar at the counsayle the whiche thynge the wyse lady aduysynge the grete euyl that myght come of it with al her puyssaunce counsayled hym the contrary and warned hym of the myschyefe that myght falle therof and myght not slepe all the nyght.
Then the morowe comen when that the foresayd Brutus wente oute of his chambre to goo to perfourme his entrepryse.
The lady whiche wolde full fayne tourne his purpose toke a rasoure frome the barboure as thoughe she wolde haue pared her nayles and lete the rasoure falle and after made as thoughe she wolde haue taken it vp and anone she smote herselfe in ye hande wherfore her women that sawe her so wounded cryed so pyteously and so strongely yt Brutus tourned agayne.
And when he sawe her hurte he blamed her and sayd that it was not her offyce to werke with a rasoure but of ye barboure.
And she answered hym that she had not done it soo folyly as he thought.
For that that she had done was a purpose to assaye howe she myght sle herselfe yf entrepryse that he had made sholde tourne hym to euyll.
But for all that he wolde not leue but wente anone and bytwene hym Cassyen they slewe Iulyus Cesar.
And anone after they were exyled and Brutus was slayne notwithstandynge that he was fled out of Rome.
But when Porcya his good wyfe knewe that he was deed her sorowe was so grete that she forsoke the Ioye of her lyfe.
And for that yt men toke awaye from her her kny ues and all thynges that she myght sle her with.
For folkes sawe wel what she wolde do she wen te to the fyre and toke brennynge coles and brente her and dyed.
And by this waye ended this noble lady Porcya whiche was the moost straungest de the that euer ony dyed on.
And yet of the same matter speketh of the noble lady Curya.
ANd yet shall tell the to that purpose ayenst them yt saye yt women can not kepe no counsayle and alwaye conty nuynge the matter of the grete loue yt many women haue to theyr husbandes.
Curya the noble Romayne was of meruayllous fayth constaunce wysdome and loue towar de Quyntus Lucrecyus her husbande.
For when her sayd husbande and other in lyke wyse sholde be condempned to the dethe for a certayne cryme yt was put vpon them it sholde come to his know ledge yt one sought them to be Iustyfyed.
It happened hym so well that they had space to flee.
But for the fere that they had to be founde they wente to hyde them in caues of wylde beestes yet they durst not abyde there.
But Lucrecyus by ye good counsayle of his wyfe parted neuer out of his cha~bre and when they that sought them came there she helde hym bytwene her armes in her bedde she hyd hym soo wysely that they neuer perceyued hym.
And after had hym so wysely bytwene ye wal les of her chambre that neuer none of her perceyued it ne knewe it.
And she coude so well ke pe his counsayle by grete cautele and wysdome yt she clothed her in poore clothes her heere hangyn ge aboute her chekes al forwepte betynge her ha~ des togyder wente aboute by the stretes and by ye temples and asked all aboute after her husbande and serched yf ony persone knewe where her husbande was become or to what place he was fled For my desyre is to be felawe with hym in his exyle and in his myseryes.
And by this way so wysely she coude fayne that neuer man perceyued it so she saued hym.
And with yt she comforted her housbande full of sorowe.
And shortely to saye so moche she dyde so moche she purchaced for hym that she delyuered hym not onely from his exyle but from his dethe also.
ANd for that we be in purpose to telle ensamples ayenst them that say that women can not kepe noo counsayle truely myght tell ye of ynowe of the~ without nombre.
But let it suffyse ye of one that shall tell the yet.
In the tyme Nero the tyraunt and Emperour reygned in Rome the re were certayne men that consydered that for the ryght grete myscheues crueltes ye the sayd Nero dyde that it sholde be grete welthe profyte to ta ke away the lyfe fro hym.
So they made conspyra cyon ayenst hym were aduysed to sle hym.
These same men repayred al to ye house of one woman in the whiche they trusted so moche that they spared not saye the dede of theyr conspyracyon before her.
And as it happened in an euenynge tyde that they were aduysed to put to effecte in mournynge theyr entrepryse they souped with the sayd wo man and they kepte them not wysely fro spekynge by the whiche by mysaduenture there were so me yt herde them whiche for to flatter and to haue grace of the Emperoure wente tolde hym what they herde them say by the whiche they were not so soone departed from the sayd woman but that the sergeauntes of the Emperoure came to ye womans house but bycause that they founde not the men there yt conspyred thus ye dethe of ye emperour they toke the woman and ledde her before ye Emperoure whiche enquyred gretely of this matter.
But he coude neuer doo so moche by gyuynge of grete gyftes nor by promyse nor by force of tourmentes of whiche he spared none that he myght knowe of this woman what men they were ne yt she knewe ony thynge of suche matters and thus this woman was meruayllously proued bothe secrete and constaunte.
Proues ayenst them that say that a man is but lewde that byleueth the counsayle of his wyfe or taketh ony hede therto.
MAdame by these reasons that vnder stande of you by that se so moche wyt welthe to be in a woma~ mer uayle of that that dyuers men saye yt these men ben lewde fooles yt byleue gyueth credence to ye counsayle of theyr wyues.
haue sayd to the before that all wo men be not wyse.
But those yt haue wyues good and wyse dothe grete foly when they byleue them not so as thou mayste se by that that haue sayd to the before.
For yf Brutus had byleued Porcy a his wyfe as for sleynge of Iulyus Cesar he hadde not be slayne hymselfe ne the euyll had not happened that felle.
And for that that we be entred in to this purpose.
shall tell the of dyuers to whome it hath happened euyll in the same wyse that they byleued not theyr wyues.
And also shall tell the after of dyuers to whome it hathe well happened that they byleued theyr wyues. yf Iulyus Cesar of whome we haue spoken had byleued ryght wyse good woma~ whiche by many tokens that she had sene apperynge that betokened dethe of her husbande and the horryble dreme that she had the nyght before by the whiche she counsayled hym to tourne his purpose that he sholde not come at the counsayle yt daye yf he had not come there he had not ben slayne.
Also in the same wyse Pompe that had wedded Iulye the doughter of Iulyus Cesar as haue sayd before.
And after her he wedded another noble lady named Cornelya whiche to the purpose abouesayd loued hym so moche yt for none euyll fortune that happened hym wolde not leue hym.
And also when he was constrayned to fle by the see after the batayle in whiche he was dyscom fyted by Iulyus Cesar the good lady was alway with hym bare hym company in al his perylles And when he aryued in the kyngdome of Egypte and that Tholomee the kynge of that countre ma+de semblaunte by treason that he had Ioye of his comynge sente his people before hym as thoughe they sholde receyue hym with Ioy and that was for to sle hym the whiche people sayd to hym that he sholde entre in to theyr shyppes that he sholde leue his people to that entente yt they myght brynge theyr vesselles to the porte more lyghtely.
But whe~ he wolde haue entred in to theyr shyppes his good and wyse wyfe Cornylle counsayled hym contrary that he sholde not go in to ony nor to put his people away from hym.
And when she sawe yt he wolde not byleue her nor do by her counsayle she wolde haue gone in to the shyp with hym but he wolde not suffre her and made her to be holden with strengthe then began her sorowe that neuer fayled after all dayes of her lyfe.
For he was not ferre from her but she had alwaye her beholdynge after hym and there she sawe the traytours murther hym within the shyp.
For the whiche she wol+de haue drowned herselfe in the see yf she had not ben kepte with strengthe.
For as nyght before yt he was slayne Adromatha his wyfe had a ryght meruaylous vysyon that yf Ector wente to the batayle in the morowe yt he sholde dye with out fayle by the whiche this lady affrayed of this thynge whiche was no dreme but a meruaylous prophecy prayed hym with Ioyned handes vpon her knees before hym beryng bytwene her armes his two fayre sones yt as that day he sholde not co me at the batayle.
But he dyspysed her wordes thynkynge that euermore it semed hym yt it sholde be reproffe to hym that for the counsayle and wor des of a woman he sholde leue to go to ye batayle nother for prayer of fader nor moder to whom she hadde prayed to requyre hym wolde he not leue. wherby it happened hym as it is sayd before.
For he was slayne by Achylles therfore it had ben bet ter yt he had byleued her.
Of case infynyte my ght tell of men to whom it happened full euyl by dyuers maners yt they dysdeyned not to byleue cou~sayle of theyr good wyse wyues.
But yf ony euyll come to them yt dyspyseth theyr counsayles those women ought not to be blamed.
Here it speketh of them yt there is good comynge of it that byleueth yt counsayle of theyr wyues and gyueth ensample of dyuers ladyes.
OF them to whome it hathe fortuned well by the of counsayle of theyr wyues shall tell ye of some and let it suffyse the for a proffe.
Soo moche myght say that the processe sholde be without ende.
And lette that auayle the whiche is sayd before of many that maye serue to the same purpose.
The Emperoure Iustynyan of whome it is sayd before had a baron with hym that he helde hym as a felawe and loued hym as hymselfe and was called Bellyfere whiche was ryght a worthy knyght.
So the Emperoure had made hym mayster gouernoure of his cheualry made hym to syt at his table serued as hymselfe And to say also he shewed hym many sygnes of lo ue that the barons had grete enuye therof.
In soo moche that they sayd to the Emperour that he en tended to slee hym and to take the Empyre vpon hym.
The Emperour byleued this thynge to sone to fynde the way couertely howe that he myght make hym to dye.
Then he commaunded that he sholde go fyght ayenst a people that was called Uoendres where as no man myght haue the better for the grete strengthe that they were of when Bellyfere vnderstode this commaundement and knewe well that the Emperour charged hym not with this thynge but yf he had be fallen out of his grace and benyuolence.
So he was so meruayllously sorowfull that he myght not be more.
When his wyfe whiche was called Antonye was syster to Empresse sawe her husbande lye vpon his bedde pale pensyfe and the eyes full of teeres she that had grete pyte of hym demaunded hym so moche that with grete payne he tolde her'the cause of his sorowe when lady vnderstode it then she made se~blaunt to be ryght Ioyous and comforted hym and sayd Syr haue ye none other thynge that dyscomforteth you but this.
And yt is to vnderstande that the faythe of Ihesu cryst was as yet but ryght newe.
And therfore the good lady whiche was a cry sten woman began to saye haue ye trust in Ihesu cryste yt was crucyfyed and ye shall haue ye hygher hande of your enemyes with ye helpe of hym.
And thoughe the enuyous wolde noye you ye shall do soo moche by your worthynesse that ye shall yelde them lyers of that they saye.
So byleue me well and dyspyse not my wordes and lette all your hope be in god and promyse you that ye shall ouer come them.
And be well ware ye shewe noo maner semblaunt to haue ony dyspleasaunce of this thynge that no man se you sory but ryght Ioyfull as he that is well contente.
And ye shal assem ble your hoost in the hastyest wyse that ye maye beware also that no man knowe at what porte ye wyll aryue.
And also loke ye haue shyppes and then parte your hoost in to two partes as soone as ye maye secretly with one partye entryn ge in to Auffryke and anone renne vpon your ene myes and shall haue that other partye of youre people with me and we shal aryue by the see at an hauen.
And tell you that they shall abyde to gyue you batayle and we shall entre in to that other parte in townes cytees and we shall put theym all to ye dethe and brenne and destroy all that they fynde.
Bellyfere byleued well this cou~sayle of his wyfe soo he dyde as a wyse man.
For more ne for lesse yt she had sayd he ordeyned hym on his waye of whiche it came so well to passe yt he ouercame his enemyes and put them vnder subieccyon and toke ye kynge of Uoendres so he had this noble voctory by the counsayle wytte of his worshypfull wyfe and then the Emperour loued hym better than euer he dyde before.
Also kynge Alexan der had not in despyte the wordes of ye quene his wyfe that was doughter of Dayre kynge of Per se when the sayd Alexander felte that he was em poysoned by his seruauntes and of the grete soro we that he felte he wolde go cast hymselfe in a ryuere to ende his lyfe the sooner.
And ye good lady yt wente ayenst hym thoughe she had ryght grete so rowe toke hym comforted hym sayd to hym yt he sholde tourne agayne sholde laye hym in his bedde.
And she wolde speke to his barons wolde make his ordynaunce as was perteynynge to suche a prynce.
For it sholde be a grete losynge of his worshyp yf one myght say after that ympacyence had ouercome hym..
So he byleued his wyfe and by her counsayle made his ordynaunces.
Here it speketh of the grete welthe that is come to the worlde and euery daye cometh by the cause of women.
Ca. xxx. MAdame se infynyte welthes come to ye worlde by women.
And alwaye these men say that there is none but it cometh by them.
Fayre frende thou mayst se by that that haue sayd to the longe ago that the contrary yt they saye is true.
For there is no man that may so me grete welthe yt is come to the worlde by women and euery daye cometh haue proued to the by the noble ladyes that hathe brought to ye worl de scyences and craftes.
But yf it suffyse the not yt haue sayd to of temporall welthes ben come by them.
howe is euery man so vnkynde that he forgeteth yt by women the gate of paradyse was opened to vs that is by ye vyrgyne Mary what gretter welthe may one desyre and that god is made man as haue sayd to the before.
And who may forgete the grete welthes that the moders do to the chyldren and women to all men and to all the worlde.
praye them that they wolde not forgete welthes that toucheth of whens they be spyrytuall.
And let vs beholde in the olde lawe of Iewes yf thou wylte beholde the hystory of Moyses to whome god ga ue the lawe of ye Iewes wryten.
Thou shalte fyn de yt by a woman yt same holy prophete by whome came so many grete welthes was respyted frome dethe as shall telle the.
In the tyme that the Iewes were in thraldome of kynge of Egypte there sholde a man be borne of the Ebrues sholde defende the chyldren of Israell from the bonda ge of them.
So it happened when that Moyses yt noble duke was borne of his moder, whiche durste not nourysshe hym was constrayned to put hy in a lytell basket put hym in to the ryuere.
So it happened as god wolde that he sholde be saued Chermyche the doughter of kynge Pharao sported her vpon the ryuere that tyme ye the basket ted vpon the water by the whiche anone she made to take it vp for to saue that she hadde goten.
And when she sawe that it was a chylde and soo fayre that noo fayrer myght be sene she had a meruaylous grete Ioy.
So she made it to be nourysshed and sayd that it was her chylde.
And for that by myracle he wolde not souke no woman of a strau~ge lawe she made it to souke and to be nourysshed by a woman of the Ebrues.
This Moyses chosen of god when he was of age it was he to whome god gaue the lawe and that drewe the chyldren of Israell out of the hondes of the Egyptyens and passed the reede see was duke conduytoure of ye chyldre~ of Israel.
And thus came so grete welthe to ye Iewes by ye cause of this woma~ yt saued hym.
THe noble lady and wydowe Iudyth saued the people of Israell frome peryss hynge in the tyme that the secon de Nabugodonosor had sente Holophernes duke of his cheualry vpon the Iewes after that he had conquered the lande of Egypte.
And as the sayd Holophernes with a grete puyssaunce hadde besyeged the Iewes in a cyte and also he fared soo fowle with theym that they myght not abyde it longe had taken away the co~duytes of water from them and al theyr vy taylles began to fayle them.
Nowe ye Iewes had no hope to haue power ayenst hym and they were as vpon the poynte to be taken of hym that ma naced them gretely wherfore they were in grete sorowe.
And then they wente to theyr prayers be, sechynge almyghty god that he wolde haue pyte of his people and to defende them from theyr ene myes.
God herde theyr prayers and as he wolde saue all mankynde by a woma~ he wolde saue the~ and socoure them by a woman.
In that cyte was Iudyth than the wyse woman whiche was yet but yonge and ryght fayre but yet more chaste that was better she had moche pyte of the people that were in suche desolacyon and prayed god nyght aud daye that he wolde socoure them.
And so as god enspyred her in whome she had grete trust She aduysed her of grete herdynesse and in a nyght she commended her to god and departed out of the cyte she and her seruaunt and wente so moche tyll that she came to the hoost of Holophernes And when they yt made the watche of ye hoost perceyued her grete beaute by the lyght of the mone they ledde her anone to Holophernes whiche receyued her with grete Ioye for yt she was so fayre and made her to sytte by hym and praysed moche her wytte and her beaute.
And in the beholdynge of her he was gretely embraced with loue and by grete desyre he coueted her.
But she that thought otherwyse prayed god alway in her thought yt he wolde her helpe to perfourme yt she wolde do and she ledde Holophernes alway forthe wt fayre wor des tyll yt she sawe her tyme when it was come to the thyrde parte of ye nyght Holophernes had gyuen a souper to his barons had well dronken was well chaufed with wyne mete and myght abyde no lenger fro bedde sente for this good la dy Iudyth yt she sholde come before hym.
And the~ he tolde her his wyll that tyme she sayd nothyn ge contrary to his entente.
But she sayd yt she wol pray hym yt for ye more honeste he wolde make voy de his pauylyon of all people that he sholde goo fyrst to bedde that she wolde come to hym with out fayle aboute mydnyght when all men slepte.
And the good lady put her to her payers alway prayenge god yt he wolde gy ue hardynes to her womanly herte ferefull to de lyuer his people fro ye felle tyraunt when Iudyth thought yt Holophernes was on slepe she came stylly her mayden with her herkened at ye dore of ye pauylyon vnderstode yt he slepte strongely.
Then sayd ye lady go we hardely for god is with vs. So she entred in without drede toke ye swer de yt she sawe at his beddes hede drewe hym out naked lyfte hym vp with all her strengthe smo te of ye heed of Holophernes without herynge of ony body put ye heed in her lappe as soone as she myght she dressed her towarde ye cyte so moche yt without ony lettynge came to the gate cryed come come open for god is with vs.
And when she was entred in no man knewe the way yt was made of this aduenture.
And on the morowe she hanged the heed vpon a perche aboue the walles all the people of the cyte armed them manfully ranne vpon theyr enemyes the whiche were yet in theyr beddes.
For they toke no hede of them of the cyte.
And when they came in to the Pauylyon of theyr duke to make hym aryse hastely there they founde hym deed al his people began to sparcle So they slewe toke all yt they myght fynde.
And thus was ye people of god delyuered fro handes of Holophernes by Iudyth the worshypfull lady whiche shall enermore be praysed gretely in holy scrypture.
BI the noble and wyse lady quene He ster god wolde also delyuer his people from ye bondage of kynge Assuere This kynge Assuere was of greate puyssaunce aboue al other kynges in those dayes.
And posseded many royalmes and he was a paynyme helde the Iewes in seruage And as the kynge made to seke in al royalmes the moost noble maydens the moost fayre ye best taught for to chose one amonge them al yt myght plea se hym best to be his wyfe.
And amonge all others was brought before hym the noble good wyse and fayre and loued of god the mayden Hester yt was an Ebrue whiche pleased hym moost aboue all others and so he wedded her and so moche he loued her of grete loue that he wolde not denaye her of nothynge that she wolde requyre hym of.
It happened on a tyme after that a false flatterer whiche was named Naman and he exhorted the kynge ayenst the Iewes that he dyde so moche yt he commaunded all aboute where that euer the Iewes were founde that they sholdde be taken.
And the quene knewe nothynge of this for yf she had knowne it it wolde haue greued her euyll yt the people sholde be so euyll entreated.
Neuertheles an vncle of hers named Mardocheus whiche was as chyefe of the Iewes made her to knowe it prayed her that she wolde remedy it as soone as she myght.
For the daye was shorte within the whiche yt the sentence of the kynge sholde be execu ted.
Of this the quene Hester was ryght sory soo she clothed arayed her in the moost noblest wyse that she myght and wente with her woman as to dysporte her in a gardyne where she knewe well yt the kynge was at the wyndowes.
And when at tournynge towarde the chambre of the kynge as thoughe she thought not on hym.
And she kynge at the wyndowes anone she fell downe on her knees saluted hym the kynge to whome it pleased her humylyte whiche had grete pleasure to beholde her grete beaute of the whiche she had ynoughe called her and sayd to her she sholde de mau~de what thynge she wolde she sholde haue it And ye quene sayd to hym ye she wolde none other thynge but yt he sholde come and dyne with her in her chambre and that he sholde brynge with hym Naman and the kynge graunted her.
And when thre dayes were past ye kynge came dyned with her.
And he had soo agreable chere yt pleased hym well.
And then he behelde her countenaunce her worshyp her bounte and beaute and wolde not leue her in peas but that he sholde aske some maner grete gyfte.
Then she fell downe at his feete in wepynge she began to say that she wolde pray hym that he wolde haue pyte on the people of the Iewes and that he wolde not put them to so grete myschyefe syth yt he had put her in so grete worshyp.
For it was grete pyte to se her lygnage and them of her nacyon so vylanously to be destroyed And then the kynge all wrothe answered her and sayd.
Myne owne lady what is he that durste do it.
She answered syr Naman your prouost make th it to be done whiche is here present.
And to say it shortely the kynge called agayne his sentence Naman was hanged whiche had caused all ye to be done.
And Mardocheus vncle to quene was put in his place the Iewes fraunchysed made moost priuyleged of ony other people moost had in worshyppe.
And soo in the same wyse that god wolde by Iudyth he dyde by this noble quene He ster that his people were saued.
And byleue it not yt these two ladyes were alone in holy scrypture by who~ god wolde saue his people dyuers tymes For there benynowe of others whiche leue for shortnes of tyme as of Delborra of whom haue spoken aboue whiche delyuered the people fro bondage.
OF ladyes of auncyent lawe of paynymes also may tell the of many whi the in the same wyse were cause of sauynge of countres cytees townes But shall passe ouer excepte two en samples ryght notable without mo for all proueth of them.
when Remus Romulus had fou~ded the cyte of Rome and Romulus had peopled the cyte and fulfylled it of knyghtes and men of armes that he had chosen and assembled after dy uers vyctoryes that he had Romulus fay ne purchace that they myght haue wyues to entente that they myght haue yssue yt myght posses the cyte and the lordeshyp.
But he wyste not well howe he myght do yt he and his felawshyp myght haue wyues and that they were maryed for the kynges and the prynces and the people of coun tre desyred not gretly to haue affynyte with them for that it semed them yt they were fyerse people dyuers so they wolde not gyue them theyr doughters in maryage.
And therfore Romulus aduy sed of a grete cautele made to crye a and a Ioustes by all the countres that it pleased the kynges and prynces and lordes and all other peo ple sholde brynge adyes and damoyselles to dysporte of the straunge knyghtes.
The daye of feest was come and grete was the assemble what of one syde what of that other.
And thyder came grete foyson of ladyes and of maydens to beholde the playe.
And amonge all others the kynge of Sabyne had brought with hym a fayre whiche was his doughter with all the ladyes gentylwomen of that countre that folowed her.
Thus were the Ioustes ordeyned without the cy te in a fayre playne besyde an hylle.
And the ladyes were al set by rowe on hye vpon hylle.
There the knyghtes enforced them one agaynst another to make dysporte.
For fayre ladyes that they sawe encreased theyr hertes in strengthe and hardynesse to make knyghtes.
And to make the shorte when they had ronne togyder ynoughe Romulus semed that it was tyme to do that they had ordeyned.
He toke a grete horne of an Holofaunt began to blowe ryght hyghe.
That blow ynge and that token they entended well and ano ne lefte the playe and all they ranne towarde the ladyes and Romulus toke the kynges doughter for he was gretely smyten with loue and all that others in the same wyse toke eche of them one anone they set them on theyr horses and fledde towarde ye cyte.
There was a grete crye and grete soro we of the faders moders that theyr doughters were so taken awaye wt strengthe, But theyr wepynge auayled them not.
Romulus made a grete feest wedded his lady so dyde all others.
For as sone as ye kynge of Sabyne myght he came wt a grete hoost vpo~ Romaynes but it was no lyght thynge to ouer co me them nor to dyscomfyte them for they were ry ght manly men.
The warre endured bytwene the~ v. yeres on a day when bothe hostes sholde mete togyder this thynge was gretely sorowed of the ladyes of cyte yt there sholde be so grete man slaughter.
And when this Romulus was yssued out of cyte with a grete hoost.
The quene assembled to a parlyament al ladyes of the cyte in to a temple then she whiche was ryght wyse good fayre began thus to say worshypfull ladyes of Sabyne my ryght dere systers felawes ye kno we rauysshynge yt was done on vs by our housba~des for whiche cause our faders frendes ha th moued warre to our husbandes our husbandes ayenst the~.
So we may not in our parte in no maner determyne this mortall warres nor to be mayntened who yt euer wyn vyctory but it must be grete p~iudyce to vs for yf our husba~des be ouer come it ought to be to vs yt loue them as reason is we haue chyldren by them ryght grete sorowe desolacyon that our lytel chyldren sholde be or phelynes that is to say without faders.
And yf it happen that our husbandes haue the vyctory and yt our faders and frendes be deed and destroyed certes we ought to haue grete pyte for vs there sholde suche myschyefe happen and that is done maye be none other wyse.
And therfore me semeth it sholde be grete welthe if ony counsayle myght be founde by vs that peas were set in this warre.
And yf it please you to folowe me do as shall do trowe we shal come wel to our entente.
And all the ladyes answered to the wordes of the quene and sayd that she sholde commaunde and they wolde obey.
And then the quene wente with her heere aboute her chekes and bare foote and all ye others dyde in the same wyse.
And those that had chyldren bare them bytwene theyr armes ledde them with them and there was grete foyson of chyldren and of women with chylde.
The quene put herselfe before in this pyteous processyon and so they came to the felde ryght there as the batayle sholde be the same houre they began to assemble.
And she wente to put herselfe bytwene bothe hoostes with all the company of ladyes and gentyl women so that they myght not assemble.
For quene al the other ladyes kneled bytwene them cryenge with an hyghe voyce.
Faders frendes ryght dere lordes entyerly byloued housbandes for goddes sake make peas or elles sle vs here let vs no longer lyue when the housbandes sawe theyr wyues and theyr chyldren bytwene theyr ar mes It is no doubte yt they were gretely abasshed and dysmayde and the same wyse to the faders to se theyr doughters it fylled theyr hertesful of pyte by whiche they loked one vpon another behelde the pyte of the ladyes whiche prayed them so mekely whiche caused bothe partyes to tourne all theyr wrathe and malyce in to amourous pyte as of the sones to the fader so moche that they were constrayned to cast of theyr harneys on bothe par tyes and to embrace eche other and to make a fynall peas.
Romulus ledde the kynge of Sabyne his fader in to the cyte gretely worshypped hym and all the company.
And thus by the wosdome vertue of this quene and of the other ladyes were the Romaynes and Sabynes saued that they be not destroyed.
VEtury was a noble lady of Rome moder of the ryght worshypful Ro mayne named Marcyan a man of vertue and counsayle subtyll and redy wyse hardy.
This worshyp ful knyght sone of Uetury was sen te by the Romaynes with a grete hoost ayenst the Coryens of whome he had the vyctory and toke the fortresse of Uolques for the whiche vyctory he had vpon the Coryens he was named Coryolus.
Of this thynge this ma~ was so gretely worshypped that he had all the gouernaunce of Rome But as that was a thynge ryght daungerous to gouerne the people euery man after his entente· At the last Romaynes were wrothe ayenst hym and condempned hym to be exyled and was banysshed out of Rome.
For he wente towarde the Coryens that he had dyscomfyted before and made them to rebelle ayenst the Romaynes they made hym theyr capytayne with a grete puyssau~ce came vpon the cyte of Rome dyde them moche harme where so euer they wente.
The Romayns doubted this matter gretely and for peryll whiche they sawe themselfe in they sente messages to them to treate for the peas.
But Marcyen dysdey ned not to here them and as often as they sente it auayled them not but euermore dyde them moche harme.
So they sente to hym bysshoppes the preestes all reuested in vestymentes praynge hym ryght humbly for peas but it auayled not.
And then the Romayns wyst not what to do but they sente ladyes of the cyte to the noble lady Ueturye moder of Marcyen to praye her that she wolde ta ke the payne to treate for the peas vnto her sone.
Then this good lady Uetury departed out of the cyte with her the noblest ladyes of the towne in this processyon she wente to her sone the whiche sone as a good knyght as soone as he knewe comynge of his moder descended from his hors wente on fote to mete her receyued her ryght humbly as a sone ought to do his moder.
And the~ as she began to praye hym for the peas he answered that it perteyned to the moder to commaunde the soue and not to praye.
And thus this noble lady ledde hym agayne to Rome.
And by her were ye Romaynes as that tyme kepte from dystruccyon and thus she dyde alone that all ye hyghe legates of Rome myght not do.
OF grete welthes that be come by wo men to beholde the spyrytualte as haue sayd to before.
Crotylde doughter of the kynge of Burgoyne wy fe of the stronge Clodonne kynge of Fraunce was it not she by whom faythe of The su cryst was fyrst brought and spredde to the kynges and prynces of Fraunce where myght there be a better thynge done than that was she dyde For as she was made lyght with the fayth of our lorde.
She neuer seased to comune with her husbande pray hym that he wolde receyue the faythe and be baptysed but he wolde not accorde to her alway this lady seased not to pray vnto god in wepynge and fastynge that he wolde enlumyne the herte of the kynge in so moche yt at the last our lorde had pyte of her enspyred kynge in suche manere as he was ones gone to do a batayl ayenst kynge of Almaunce the dyscomfyture of ye batayle came vpon hym.
And then kynge Clodon soo as god wolde enspyre hym lyfted vp his eyen towarde heuen and by grete affeccyon sayd these wordes.
Almyghty god whiche that ye quene my wyfe byleueth and worshyppeth let thyne infynyte grace shyne on me this daye to helpe me in this batayle.
And promyse the yt shall receyue thyne holy faythe he had no soner sayd these wordes but that the dede of the batayle tourned to hym had the playne vyctory.
Then he yelded thankynges to our lorde and retourned home with grete comforte and Ioye and receyued baptyme with the quene and all his barons and after al the people.
And from that houre vnto this day our lorde hathe stretched his grace soo plenteously on vs the faythe fayled neuer syth in Fraunce and all by the prayers of this good lady and holy quene ne there was neuer kynge heretyke worshypped by god as there hathe ben of dyuers other kynges Emperoures the whiche thynge is gretely to be praysed in them.
If wolde tell the all yt grete welthes that cometh by women the wrytynge sholde be to grete.
But yet vpon the acte that toucheth spyrytualte howe many holy martyrs haue there ben comforted harboured and refresshed by women wyues and wydowes.
If thou wylte rede thou shalte fynde that it pleased god that all for ye moost parte in theyr aduersytees martyrdomes were comforted by women not onely the martyres but also the appostles saynt Poule and other and in the same wyse Ihesu cryst was refresshed and comforted by women.
And frenss he men that haue in soo grete deuocyon the body of saynt Denys a good cause why for he brought fyrst the faythe in to Fraunce haue not they that blessyd body and ye bodyes also of his blessyd felawes saynt and saynt Elenthere thrughe the helpe of a woman.
For the tyraunt that made them to be heeded ordeyned that the bodyes sholde be cast in to the ryuer of Sayne and they that sholde haue done it put the bodyes in a sacke to bere it thyder. and they were harboured with a good woman a wedowe whiche was named Catule the whiche opened the sacke and toke out ye holy bodyes put in to the sacke deed hogges.
And buryed these holy martyres as worshypfully as she coude in her owne house.
And set wrytynge ouer them to ye entente that in tyme to come they sholde be knowne And longe tyme after also by a woma~ there was made fyrst a chapell in the honoure of them.
That was by my lady saynt Geuenyene tyll vnto that tyme that the good kynge of Fraunce Dangobert founded the chyrche that is nowe there.
Here it speketh ayenst them yt say yt is not good that women sholde lerne letters.
Madame se well that many grete welthes cometh by wome~ And yf ony euyll haue folowed by ony euyll women neuertheles it semeth me that there ben many mo welthes come by good women in the same wyse by wyse women and by them that haue lerned scyences of whom there is mencyon made before by the whiche meruayle gretely of the opynyon of some men that saye that they wolde not in no wyse that theyr doughters or wyues or kynneswomen sholde lerne scyences and that it sholde apayre theyr co~dycyo~s.
Thou mayst se well by that that al the opynyons of men be not founded vpon reason yt they haue wronge.
For it ought not to be presumed that of knowynge the scyence moral and they that lerne vertue the condycyons of them ought not to be enpayred by that but it is no doubte yt they nobled therby amended howe is it thought that he that lerneth a good lesson of doctryne sholde enpayre.
This thynge is not to say ne to susteyne say not that it is good that a man or a woman sholde study in scyences of sorcery or of suche as ben forbydden.
For it is not for nought that the chyrche hathe put them out of the comune vsage but that ye women apayreth with connynge it is not well to byleue.
Quintus Ortencyus was not of the same opynyon yt was a grete rethorycyen in Rome and a so uerayne endytoure.
The same man had a doughter named Hortence whome he loued moche for subtylnesse of her wytte and made her to lerne let tres and to study in the foresayd scyence of wherof she lerned soo moche that not onely as sayth she resembled her fader by wytte and good remembraunce and in all facultes but also of well pronounsynge and of all ordre of spekynge so well that he passed her in nothynge.
And to the purpose of that yt is sayd aboue of welthe yt cometh by women.
The welthe yt cometh by this woman and by her connynge was amonge other that in tyme that Rome was gouerned by thre men this woman Hortence toke vpon her to susteyne the causes of women and to demeane that that a man durste not take on hande that was of certayne charges that one wolde put vpon them and on theyr araymentes in ye tyme of necessytes of Rome.
And the cloquence of this woman was so fayre that she was herde with no lesse wyll tha~ her fader was and gate her cause.
In the same wyse to speke of more newe tyme without lokynge after olde hystoryes.
Iohsi Andry a solempne legyster of Boloynela Grace was not of the same opynyon that it was euyll that women were lettered as to this fayre doughter and good that he loued so moche whiche was named Nouuelle ma de her to lerne letters she had the lawes when he was occupyed in ony busynesse by ye whiche he myght not entende to rede ye lessons of his scolers he sent Nouuelle his doughter in his place to rede to scolers in thayre to entente yt her beaute sholde not hurre thought of them she taughte she had a lytell curtyne before her by suche manere she fullylled of her fader who~ he loued so moche that for to put name of her in remembraunce made a notable letter of a boke of lawe that he called it after the name of his dough ter Nouuelle.
So there be not many men that be wyse of the opynyon aboue sayd.
Thy fader yt was a naturall phylosophre had not that opynyo that women sholde not lerne letters but in so mo che that he sawe she enclyned to lernynge as thou knowest well he had grete pleasure of it.
And by ye blame of thy moder whiche by the comune opyny on of women thou were taryed in thy youthe to entre more in the depnesse of scyences.
But as the prouerbe say the that nature gyueth maye not be taken awaye.
So it may not hurte the felynge of connynge that thou hast gadred togyder the lytel droppes of the whiche trowe that thou wenest be not of valure but thou holdest theym in grete treasoure and without fayle thou haste cau se.
Madame that you say is as true as the Pater noster.
Here Xp~ine to ryghtwysnesse and she answereth agaynst them yt there be but fewe women chaste and telleth of Susanne.
MAdame to that yt se that these grete welthes all vertues may be founde in women.
And whens cometh it yt these men saye that there be but fewe women chast.
And yf it be so al other vertues sholde be as nought in so moche chasty+te sholde be the moost souerayne vertue in a woman.
But by haue herde you say it is all other wyse.
By that that haue sayd to truely and that thou knowest is open ynoughe ye contrary.
And yet thynke to saye alwaye shall of howe many worshypful ladyes chaste spe+keth holy scrypture whiche rather chase the dethe than to breke theyr chastyte and clennesse of body and of thought so as the fayre and goo Susanne the wyfe of Ioachym that was a man of lygna+ge of Iewes ryche and of grete auctoryte.
And as vpon a tyme this good lady sported her alone in a gardyne there entred to her two false olde prestes and requyred her to synne with them and she alwaye denyed them.
By whiche when they sawe theyr prayer auayled not they manased her to accuse her to the Iustyce and to put on her that she was founde wt a yonge man.
And when she herde theyr manales for custome was there that women founde in suche case were stoned to the dethe she sayd than enuyronned with anguysshe in euery parte.
If do not that these men requyre me shall haue corporall dethe.
And yf do it offende before the face of my creatoure.
But not for that it is better to be innocent and suffre corporall dethe then fall by synne in to the wrathe of my lorde god And then cryed Susanne and the people that were within came anone and to say shortly so moche wytnesse these false preestes made that Susanne was condempned to the dethe.
But god whiche prouyded alwaye for his frendes opened the mou the of profyte Danyel whiche was a yonge chyl de bytwene the armes of his moder whiche whe~ they ledde Susanne to the Iugement with grete multytude of people wente wepynge after her cryed sayd yt the innocent Susanne was Iuged by grete wronge.
So she was ledde home agayne the false preestes better examyned were foun de by theyr confessyon culpable.
And the innocent Susanne was delyuered and they were Iuged to the dethe.
OF the chastyte goodnesse of Sarra speketh the byble aboute the. xx. chapytre of Genesis.
This woma~ was wyfe of Abraham grete Patryarke Moche good thynge is there sayd of her in holy scrypture whiche that leue to tell the for shortnesse.
But of her chastyte may one saye to the purpose that we spake of before that there ben fayre women ynowe that be chaste.
For she was of so souerayne beaute that in her tyme she passed all other women so moche that many prynces co ueted her but she was so true that she dysdeyned not to here theym. wherof amonge all the others that coueyted her was the kynge Pharao in soo moche that he toke her awaye by strengthe frome her husbande.
But the grete goodnesse of her whi che yet passed her beaute desyred of god that she lo ued soo tenderly that he wolde kepe her frome all maner of vylanyes.
And almyghty god herynge her petycyon tourmented so moche Pharao and his people bothe of body and of herte by greuous sykenesses and dyuers vysytacyons that he touched her neuer and so was he constrayned to yelde her agayne.
REbecca the wyfe of Isaac the Patry arke fader of Iacob was not moche lesse to prayse than the fayre good Sarra.
This Rebecca is meruayllously praysed in holy scripture of dy uers thynges.
And it is wryten of her in the. xxiiij. chapytre of the fyrste boke of ye byble that she was so good wyse and honest that she was ensample of chastyte vnto all women that knewe her.
And with that she bare her meruayllously mekely towarde her housbande and soo symply that she semed not that she was a lady and therfore good man Isaac worshypped her and loued her meruayllously well.
But this good woman Rebec ca hadde of almyghty god a better gyfte than the loue of her housbande for her grete chastyte and goodnesse.
For this noble lady that was so mo che in the loue and in the grace of our lorde Ihesu she had it so gretely yt notwithstandynge she was olde god gaue her two chyldren in one wombe whiche was Iacob and Esau of whome came the lygnages of Israell.
OF good ladyes and chaste myght tel the of whiche holy scrypture maketh mencyon whiche leue for Ruth was a noble lady a good whiche dessended of ye lygnage of Dauyd the prophete.
She was ryght chaste and in lykewyse in her wydowhode of ryght grete loue to her husbande as it appered.
For the grete loue that she had to hym when he was deed she forsoke her ow ne countre and nacyon and wente to dwelle and vse her lyfe with the Iewes of the whiche lygnage her husbande came and dwelled with his owne moder.
And to say shortly this noble lady was so good and chaste that there was a boke made of her and of her lyfe in the whiche these thynges be fore sayd be wryten.
OF chaste ladyes paynymes there be founde ynowe ryght good and worshypfull in dyuers cronycles Penolope the wyfe of prynce Ulyxes was rygh a vertuous lady amonge other vertues yt she had she was gretely praysed for her chastyte many dyuers hystoryes maketh mencyon of her.
For this lady al the whyle ye her husbande was at the syege before Trope yt endured.
And not withstandynge yt she was requyred of many kynges and prynces for bycause yt she was so fayre she wolde not herken to them nor here them speke.
And she was wy se prudent deuoute to her goddes of fayre good behauynge.
And also after ye dystruccyon of Troye she abode her sayd husbande other.
x. yeres men supposed that he was perysshed in the see.
And when he was come home he founde her besyeged with a kynge ye wolde haue had her by strengthe in ma ryage.
For her grete beaute and chastyte her husbande came in the guyse of a Pylgryme enquyred of her when he herde good tydynges of her he was ryght Ioyous.
And he had grete Ioye of his yonge sone Thelomachus whiche he lefte wt her ryght lytell and he founde hym then parfytely growne.
Madame by that haue herde you saye these foresayd ladyes lefte not to be chaste thoughe they were fayre.
For many men say that of grete payne there be founde ony fayre women chaste.
For there be hathe ben and shall be fayre women chaste.
Here it speketh ayenst them that saye that it is a payne for to fynde ony fayre woman chaste.
MAryamyre was a woman of Ebrue doughter of kynge Arystobolus she was of so grete beaute that not onely in that tyme men wende that she had passed and exceded all other women in beaute but they Iuged her that she was rather a celestyall ymage godly than a mortall woman and ye fygure of her was paynted in a table and sente to kynge Anthony of Egypte whi che for the grete meruayle of suche beaute sayd Iuged that she was doughter of Iupyter the god For he wolde not byleue that she myght be engen dred by a mortall man.
This lady notwithstandynge her excellent beaute and yt she was tempted and assayed to be had of dyuers grete prynces kynges.
Neuerthelesse by grete vertue strength of courage she all for yt she was the more praysed more shynynge in renowne.
And yet she was more to prayse in so moche that she was wedded ryght euyll that is to knowe to Herode Anthy pater kynge of Iewes whiche was a man of grete cruelte and also he had made to be slayne the broder of this good lady for the whiche cause and many others that he dyde to her she had hym in hate.
But for al that she lefte neuer to be a good woman and chaste.
And yet with this it came to the knowledge of this lady that he had ordeyned that yf he dyed before her that she sholde he slayne anone after to the entente that none other sholde haue the possessyon of so grete beaute after hym.
Also the same purpose of Anthony wyfe of Dru se Tybere broder of the noble Emperoure Nero.
FOr that that one sayth comunely yt it is as stronge a thynge yt a fayre woman maye kepe her amonge yonge men courtyours desyrous of loue without takynge as it is to be amon ge the flambes of fyre without brennynge well she coude defende her the fayre good Anthonye wyfe of Druse Thybere broder of Nero the Emperoure.
This lady dwelled in the floure of her so uerayne beaute grene youthe wedowe of Druse Thybere her husbande whiche his broder Nero had slayne with poyson wherof this noble lady had so grete sorowe that she purposed neuer after to be maryed but to lyue in chastyte whiche pur pose she helde as longe as she lyued so holy yt there was neuer paynyme lady that had gretter praysynge of chastyte.
So she dyde of this thynge soo moche more to be praysed as Bocace saythe that in this chastyte contynuence she was abydynge amonge in the courte amonge ye yonge lusty people fresshe Ioly louers lyuynge courtely.
There she vsed her lyfe without spotte of ony blame or of ony maner of lyghtnesse the whiche thynge as the auctoure saythe is worthy too be lyfted vp in praylynge soo as of a yonge woman ryght excellent in beaute whiche was the doughter of Marke Anthonye that ledde his lyfe full synfully.
But not for that the lewde ensamples that she sawe made her neuer to falle but that she abode alway in chastyte amonge the brennynge tyres and it was noo lytell whyle but that she was perseueraunt tyll that she dyed for age.
Of suche that were fayre and chaste lyuynge amonge the worldely people and also in courte amonge the yonge lusty folkes of ensamples myght fynde the ynowe and at this daye also nor doubte the not but there ben many thoughe that the euyll tongues lysteth for too saye shrewdely.
And of suche good and chaste ladyes ledynge theyr lyues amonge these worldely people speketh Ualery of this noble and worthy lady Sulpyce the whiche was of greate beaute and yet she was named the moost chaste amonge all the ladyes of Rome.
Here it speketh agaynst them that saythe that women wolde be rauysshed and gyueth ensamples of dyuers and fyrste it speketh of the noble and worthy lady Lucresse. wyfe of Tarquyne Collatyn.
Madame byleue it well that ye saye and am sure that there ben ynowe fayre women chaste and that can kepe them from the awayte of the deceyuours yet it greueth me of that that many men say that women wolde be rauysshed and that it dysplease th them not thoughe they saye the contrary with theyr mouthe.
But it were a grete thynge to make me to byleue it that it were agreable to theym.
Doubte it not fayre frende that it is noo pleasaunce to these chaste ladyes of herte and thought to be rauysshed but it is to theym ryght grete sorowe aboue all other and that it be true there be many of them that haue shewed it by fayre ensamples.
As of Lucres the ryght noble woman of Rome souerayne in chastyte amonge all yt ladyes of Rome wyfe of the noble Tarquyne Col latyn as Tarquyne the prowde sone of the kyn ge was taken with the loue of this lady Lucres and durst not tell it her for the grete chastyte that she was of but dyspayred to come therto by gyftes or prayer.
So he thought to come to it by cautele he sayd yt he was well byloued with her husbande by whiche he entred in to her house when it pleased hym by the whiche as in a tyme he wol de go thyder when he knewe verely that her housbande was not at home and she receyued hym ry ght worshypfully as hy~ whiche she thought was a ryght good frende to her housbande.
But Tarquyne whiche thought all otherwyse dyde so moche that he entred at nyght in to her chambre of whiche she was gretely aferde.
And to say shortely when he had spoken ynoughe by grete promyses gyftes and offres that he myght do his wyll with her sawe that all auayled not he toke his swerde manaced her to her yf she spake one worde but that she sholde consente to his wyll she answered that he sholde her hardely for she loued more to dye than to consente.
Tarquyne yt sawe that nothynge auayled hym aduysed hym of another grete malyce and sayd that he wolde tell it openly yt he had founde her with one of her seruauntes and to say shortely she was so gretely aferde of this thynge thynkynge yt folkes wolde soone byleue suche a thynge by the wordes of hym she suffred his strengthe.
But yet myght not Lucresse bere pacyentely this grete dyspleasure wherfore when it was daye she sente to seke her husbande and her fader and kynnesfolke whiche were grettest of Rome when they were come to her she tolde them with grete wepynges and waylynges that whiche was done to her.
And as her housbande and kynnes folkes sawe her in soo grete sorowe recomforted her she drewe a knyfe that she had vnder her gowne sayenge thoughe it be so that clere me of this synne and shewe myne Innocence neuerthelesse delyuer me not from tourment nor put me out of payne ne fro hens forthe there shal neuer woman lyue shamed by the ensample of Lucresse.
And these thynges sayd by grete strengthe she fyxed knyfe in to her brest and fell downe dyenge in syght of her husbande and frendes.
So they ranne al as they had ben out of themselfe vpon this Tarquyne and for this cause all Rome was moued and chased the kynge out of the towne they wolde haue slayne his sone yf they myght haue fouude hym.
And neuer syth there was no kynge in Rome bycause of this grete outrage done to Lucres as some say for bycause of her there was a lawe made that yf ony man that rauysshed a woman sholde dye the whiche lawe is conuenable and Iuste.
WEll to the purpose aboue sayd the hystory maketh mencyon of ye noble que ne wyfe of Orgyagontes kynge of Gausegres.
It happened in the tyme when the Romayns made theyr grete conquestes vpon straungers this sayd kynge was taken by the sayd Romaynes in a batayle his wyfe wt hym whe~ they were at theyr lodgyn ge noble quene whiche was ryght fayre symple chaste pleased gretely one of yt constables of the sayd hoost of Rome whiche had taken the kynge her.
So he prayed requyred her by grete offres but when he sawe that prayers auayled hym not he lefte of and spake no more.
Then this noble lady had grete sorowe for the wronge that this con stable dyde to her and she lefte not to thynke how she myght be reuenged.
So she dyssyinyled tyll she sawe her tyme and when she sawe that the raunsome was brought for to delyuer her hus bande and her the lady wolde this money sholde be payde to sayd constable she beynge present To whom she sayd that she wolde that he sholde waye the golde to the entente that he sholde haue noo wronge and that he were not deceyued.
And when she sawe that he entended to way the golde that there was noae of his people aboute hym.
The lady toke a knyfe and smote hym in the throte and slewe hym and smote of his hede without ony trouble brought it to her husbande tolde hym ho we she had done and howe she had reuenged her wronge. yet of the same and of ye ladyes of Sycambres and other maydens.
ALso thoughe maye gyue the ensam ples of maryed women of whome myght tell the ynoughe of whom the sorowe to be rauysshed was importa ble shall tell the of wydowes and maydens.
Sysponne was a woman of Grece and she was taken rauysshed with maryners scommers of see whiche were enemyes to that countre the whiche lady as she that was of grete beaute was requyred by them ryght gretely.
And when she sawe that she myght not escape but to be rauysshed she had this thynge in so grete abho mynacyon and dyspleasannce that she had leuer to dye.
And therfore she lepte in to see and was drowned.
Also the Sycambres whiche nowe ben called Frensshme~ assayled on a tyme amonge other the cyte of Rome with a grete hoost a mul tytude of people.
And in hope that they sholde haue destroyed the cyte they brought theyr wyues wt them and theyr chyldren.
And it happened that dyscomfyture tourned vpon Sycambres whe~ theyr wyues sawe that they counsayled amonge them yt it was better to dye in defendynge theyr chastyte.
For they knewe yt after vsage of warre they sholde be rauysshed than to be deedly dyshonoured.
So they made fortresses aboute them wt theyr charyottes and cartes armed them ayenst Romaynes and they defended them as moche as they myght and slewe many of them but at last they were siayne moost parte of theym.
And those that were lefte on lyue prayed with Ioyned handes that they wolde not touche them in no vy lany and that they myght vse the ende of theyr lyues in seruynge in the temple of maydens of the goddesse Uesta.
But for that that it was not grau~ ted to them they wolde sle them rather than to be rauysshed.
Also of maydens in lyke wyse so as of Uyrgyne the noble mayde of Rome whiche the false Iuge Claudyen trowed to haue by cautele by force and when he sawe prayer auayled hym not but she notwithstandynge her grene youthe had leuer to dye than to be rauysshed.
Also there was a cyte taken in Lombardy by the enemyes whiche that slewe the lorde.
The doughters of sayd lorde whiche were ryght fayre in so moche they thought they sholde be solde to be rauysshed they pourneyed them of a straunge remedy for ye whiche they were gretely to prayse.
For they toke the flesshe of chekyns rawe and put it in theyr bosomes so it was anone corrupte by hete wherof it happened that when they yt wolde rauysshe them came nyghe to them and they felte stynke anone they lefte them saynge.
Proues agaynst that yt one speketh of inconstaunce of women.
Xp~ine speketh ryghtwysnes answereth of inconstaunce and fragylyte of dyuers Emperoures.
MAdame ye tell me meruayllous constaunce stablenesse and vertue of grete courage of women what myght one saye more of the moost stron gest men that euer were yet aboue all vyces that men and also the bokes say to be of women cryeth all of one voyce vpon them yt they be varyable Inconstaunte chaungeable lyght of frayle courage bowynge as chyldren.
Are these men then so constaunnte that they may not vary and it is a grete thynge to do that so moche accuseth women of inconstaunce.
Certes yf they do to moche it is ryght lewde and euyl semynge to aske of another a vertue that they can not haue themselfe.
Fayre swete loue haste not thou alwaye herde say that a fole perceyueth better the lytell mote in ye face of his neyghboure then he beholdeth the grete beme yt hangeth ouer his owne eye.
So shall shewe the grete contradyccyon in that that these men saye so moche of the varyaunce of women.
They accorde all generally that wo men by nature be ryght frayle and yet these men desyre that women sholde be of grtter constaunce then they can be themselfe.
For those that so calleth themselfe to be so stronge and of so noble condy cyon yet they maye not holde them from fallynge in to many ryght grete defautes and synnes and knowe well that they mysse take and they laboure so to the women that yf ony of them fall in ony defaute of whiche they are the cause and by theyr cautayles they haue drawne them therto by grete payne and laboure yet they name them soo frayle they ought in some wyse for to supporte theyr fragylyte and not to calle a lytell faute a gre te cryme yet they lyst not to supporte them but ma keth and saythe many greate gryefes of theym And they denaye not to calle theym stronge and constaunte when they endure theyr grete outrages.
And thus at all purposes these men wolde ha ue the ryght from them.
And of yt thou hast spoke~ ynoughe in thy pystle of the god of loue.
But to yt thou demaundest me yf these men be so stronge so constaunte that they haue cause to blame other of theyr constaunce.
If thou beholde syth ages and auncyent tyme vnto this daye by the bokes by that thou haste sene in thyne age and at all tymes theu mayst se it before thyne eyes not onely in symple men nor of lowe estate but of grettest thou mayst knowe perfeccyon of theyr constaun ce wyll not saye absolutely that it is with them so generally as they say of women but as it hathe ben and is in some of theym.
And for that that yf there be in the courage of men no inconstaunce but accuse the women of vyce.
Take hede nowe here and shall gyue the ensamples of grettest prynces and moost lyfted vp in estate whiche is a thynge not perteynynge to same vyce more tha~ in others without sekynge in more au~cyent ages where was there euer courage of women soo frayle nor so euyll accustomed and lesse constaunt then was the Emperour Claudyen.
He was soo varyable what so euer he ordeyned in one houre he dyspysed it in another and there was neuer sta blenes founde in his worde he accorded to all cou~ sayle.
He caused his wyfe to be slayne by his cruel te and after at nyght he, asked wherfore she came not to bedde and commaunded his seruauntes he had made smyte of theyr heedes to come play with hym.
This Emperoure was of so caytyfe a courage that he trembled alwaye nor he trusted no body can not tell the all the shrewdenesse of the condycyons of this lewde Emperoure but he was full of fragylyte.
Tybere Emperoure what was he more wrothe all in constaunce all varyaunce all slyppernesse was mor en hym tha~ euer was founde in woman.
ANd Nero that was he syth we be entred in the dedes of Emperoures.
For at begynnynge he was good ynoughe and dyde his payne to please all people.
But after he had no refrayne of his lechery of his rauyne nor of his cruelte and to exercyse it the more often tymes he armed hym by nyght and wente with his glotons and his felawes to vnthryfty places playenge and Iapynge by the stretes doynge all shrewdenes to fynde occasyon to do shrewdely he shouldred them he mette yf they spake ony worde other he wolde wounde them or sle them.
He brake tauernes dores of lewde houses he toke women by streng the wherby he was almoost slayne ones of husbande of a woman that he had rauysshed.
He lete make bathes for lewdenesse and ete and dranke all the nyght and slepte day.
He ordeyned nowe one thynge nowe another as his foly styred hym to do dyuers thynges.
All lechery al superfluytes all pryde and al maner thoughtes of foly was in hym he haunted al euyll he loued noughty folkes and tourmented the good.
He was consentynge to dethe of his fader of his moder when she was deed he made her to be opened to se the place where he was conceyued.
And when he had sene it he sayd that she was a fayre woman when she lyued.
He slewe his wyfe Octouyene that was ry ght a good woman and toke another he loued moche at begynnynge after slewe her he lete sle a kynnes woman of his owne bycause she wol de not be maryed to hym he made to sle his lytell doughter within the age of. vij. yeres bycause one bare her to playe with a dukes sones.
He lete sle noble phylosophre Seneke whiche was his may ster.
For that that he was alwaye ashamed when he sawe hym he enpoysoned his prouost faynynge he wolde hele hym agayne he enpoysoned with metes and drynkes all noble auncyent prynces and barons of grete auctoryte that had grete gouernaunce he made to sie his aunte and toke her goodes he made to destroye all the nobles of Rome and put them in exyle and destroyed theyr chyl dren he made a cruell man of Egypte to be accustomed to ete mannes fless he rawe to the entente that by hym he wolde make men to be eten quicke what shall say one may not tell the horryble dedes that he dyde ne gathered togyder erueltees of hym.
He made fyre to be caste all aboute Rome vj. dayes and. vj. nyghtes and by that pestylence dyed moche of the people he behelde the fallynge of his toure and made grete Ioye and songe He made to sle saynt Peter and saynt Poule and ma ny other martyres.
And in doynge these thynges when he had reygned the space of. xiiij. yeres the Romaynes had suffred to moche rebelled ayenst hym he fell in dyspayre and slewe hymselfe.
grete meruayle haue tolde as it semeth by aduenture of the cursednesse of Nero and of his fragylytes.
But promyse the the Emperoure that succeded hym whiche was named Galba was but lytell better yf he had lyued longe for his cruelte was out of measure.
And wt his other vyces he was so varyable there was no maner of restraynynge ne he was neuer in one estate nowe cruell without measure nowe to softe and without Iustyce neglygent enuyous and full of suspeccyon lytell louynge his prynces and his knyghtes caytyfe and fereful of courage coueytous aboue all thynge he reygned but. vj. monethes for he was slayne to shorte~ his crueltes But Othomy whiche that succeded hym was no better For that some saye that women ben cutyous.
The Emperoure was curyous and delyca te of his body caytyfe of courage sekynge after nothynge but his ease folyly large a grete gloton faynte lecherous a false traytoure and full of all shrewdenesse full of dysdayne.
And ye ende of hym was that he slewe hymselfe after yt he had reygned thre monethes for bycause that his enemyes had the vyctory of hym in batayle.
Uyncylyen that succeded this Othomy was noo better but full of cursednesse wote not what shal tell the more and thou trowe that lye rede hystoryes of Emperours and the processe of theyr lyues and thou shalte fynde that there were but fewe in nombre yt were of good condycyons ryghtfull constaunt of the whiche good was the Emperour Trayane and Tytus.
But promyse the that ayenst these two good thou shalte fynde. x. euyll.
And in the same wyse of ye Popes of people of holy chyrche whiche ought to be more chosen but thoughe at the begynnynge of crysten faythe there were sayn tes. Syth the Emperour Constantyne gaue to ye chyrche grete reuenues and rychesses ye holynesse that hath ben rede theyr gestes and crownacles tell me yf they be of ye same perfeccyon nowe and nowe thou mayst se at this daye yf the worlde be in amendynge.
And yf grete stablenesse haue ben and grete constaunce in the dedes and counsayles as moche of temporall prynces as of spyrytuall it appereth ynoughe.
shall say to the more wo te not to whom men speke of inconstaunce nor of varaunce of women nor howe they haue no shame to open theyr mouthe when they beholde how in the grete dedes gouerned by them and not by ye women with so moche inconstaunce varyaunce as it were ye dedes of chyldren howe well theyr purpose and accorde abydeth they make in theyr grete counsayles.
And shal tell the all at ones vpon these thynges there is none other inconstau~ ce nor varyaunce but to do agaynst that reason techeth.
And a creature reasonable made after the ymage of god and that hathe knowledge of that enclyneth more to sensualyte than to reason that is frayle and the more the shrewdenesse is grete the ferder it is fro reason and ought to be called ye fragylyte.
And am certayne that rede al alonge the hystoryes of whom that euer they are wryten thoughe phylosophers many auctours haue sayd and afferme that there is so grete fragy lyte in women that thou shalte not fynde ony wo man of so grete cursednesse as there hathe ben in grete quantyte of men.
The worste women that thou shalte fynde in holy scrypture was Athalys Iesobell her moder quenes of Iherusalem whiche poursued the chyldren of Israell.
But aduyse the of the cursednesse of Iudas that so myscheuously betrayed his good mayster swete Ihesus to who~ he was appostle yt had done hym so moche good and take hede of Iulyan the apostata.
So many of shrewde kynges in dyuers countrees of false Emperoures and Popes and other prelates without faythe full of coueytyse antecrystes also and thou shalte fynde also ye men haue cause to holde theyr peas and that women haue cause to thanke god and prayse hym that ha the put the treasoure of so many good soules in ye bodyes of women.
So shall saye noo more as nowe agaynst them by ensamples of the dedes of them that call these women so frayle.
And shall tell the of dyuers women ryght stable constaunt of whome the hystoryes ben ryght good to here of good ensamples.
Of Grysylde Marquys of Saluce a woman of grete vertue and specyally in pacyence.
WRyten it is there was a Marquys of Saluce named by name Gautyre sans pere.
He was fayre of body and a worshypfull man but ryght straunge of condycyons his lordes often ty mes counsayled hym prayed hym that he wolde mary that he myght haue yssue.
But it was longe tyme or he wolde accorde to them.
At the last he sayd to them that he wolde with a good wyll.
If it sholde be agreable to them that he myght take suche a woman as he wolde chose to be maryed vnto to the whiche thynge they accorded and ma de theyr othe therto.
This Marquys haunted often tymes the dysporte of huntynge and hawkyn ge in the feldes in the whiche amonge the poore men labourers of that towne there dwelled a ryght poore man impotent olde yt was called Ianycle and was a good true man al his lyfe.
This same good man had a doughter of the age xviij yeres named Grysylde whiche serued hym by gre te dylygence and founde hym by ye laboure of her spynnynge.
The sayd Marquys whiche often tymes passed that waye had well aduysed the good condycyons and the honeste of this mayden whiwas ryght fayre of body and of vysage whom he had ryght gretely in his grace.
It happened that the Marquys yt was accorded with his barons yt he sholde take a wyfe sayd to theym yt they sholde assemble at a certayne day for ye weddynges he that all the ladyes sholde be there so he lete make grete araye.
And at yt daye as all men women were assembled before hym he made al yt route to take theyr horses for to go with hym for to fetche home his spouse.
Soo they wente ryght vnto the house of Ianycle and there they mette wt Grysylde with a potte of water vpon her heed whi che came fro the welle.
And this mekely kneled downe and sayd vnto hym that he was at home.
And when the good man was come ye Marquys sayd to hym yt he wolde take his doughter by maryage.
And Ia nycle answered hym that he sholde do his pleasure.
So the ladyes entred in to the lytell house and clothed and arayed the spouse ryght nobly so as it perteyned to the estate of a Marquys of Robes of Iewelles that he had ordeyned for her.
Soo he ledde her home wedded her in his palays.
This lady bare her so wel to euery creature that nobles grete and lytell all the people loued her and so well she coude behaue her wt euery persone yt euery man helde them contente and she serued and cherysshed her lorde so as she ought.
This yere this lady had a doughter whiche was taken in grete Ioye.
But when she was in age that she was taken fro the pappes The Marquys made the lady to byleue for to pro ue her constaunce that she dyspleased the lordes yt the lygnage of her sholde lordeshyp vpon them and therfore he wolde that the chylde were slayne To this thynge whiche ought to be ryght harde to euery moder.
Grysylde answered that the doughter was his owne that he myght do his pleasure.
So he made the chylde to be taken to a squyer of his whiche in makynge semblaunt that he came thyder to sle the chylde and he bare it secretly to Boloyne la grace to the countesse of Payngo whiche was syster to the Marquys to kepe and to nourysshe it.
But for al this Grysylde made neuer semblaunt of heuynesse that trowed her doughter to be slayne.
Agayne in the yere after lady was with chylde and was delyuered of a fayre sone the fade receyued it with grete Ioye.
And yet agayne the Marquys wolde assaye his wyfe as he dyde before and sayd to her that the chylde must nedes be slayne to contente the lordes his people.
And Grysylde answered that yf it suffysed not that her chylde sholde dye that she was redy to dye if it my ght please hym.
So he toke the chylde to squyer in the wyse as he dyde that other and yet she made neuer semblaunt of sorowe ne sayd other worde but that she prayed the squyer that when he had slayne the chylde that he wolde hury hym to the entente that the tender flesshe of the chylde were not eten with wylde beestes ne with byrdes Of this grete hardnesse there appered neuer chau~ gynge chere in Grysylde.
But yet it was longe after that Marquys wolde assay her agayne when they had ben togyder. vij. yeres in the whiche tyme the good lady had borne her so well that it ought to haue suffysed prouynge of her vertue when the Marquys on a daye called her in to his chambre and sayd to her that he was in poynte to lose his lordshyp by his knyghtes and his squyers for her.
For they had grete dysdayne to holde for theyr lady and maystres the doughter of Ianycle So it is conuenyent yf he wolde appease them she wente home agayne to her fader so as she came thens and that he sholde wedde another more gentyll woman of more hygher blode.
To this thynge whiche ought to be ryght greuous harde to her a~swered grysylde.
My lorde knewe well alway oftymes thought bytwene thy noblesse magnyfyce~ce my pouerte myght be no {pro}porcy+on nor thought me not onely worthy to be your spouse nor also to be poorest of your house.
And nowe am redy to retourne in to the house of my fader in whiche shall were myne age.
And as to my dowre that thou hast ordeyned me to haue that ought to haue se it well.
Thou knowest well yt when thou tokest me out of my faders hou+se thou madest me to be dyspoyled all naked clothed me agayne in good robes with the whiche came with ne neuer other thynge of myne owne brought with me but fayth maner loue reuerence and pouerte.
So it is reason yelde to the agayne thy mouable goodes.
And se here thy robe of whiche me despoyle so yelde to rynge with the whiche thou dydest wedde me yelde to the all other rynges Iewelles clothynge and araye by whiche was worshypped enryched in thy chambre all naked out of my faders house came all naked shall tourne agayne.
Saue yt it me semeth a thynge vnconuenable yt this wom+be in the whiche the chyldren were thou haddest engendred sholde appere all naked before people For the whiche yf it pleas the none otherwyse praye the for the recompensacyon of my vygyny+te brought in to thy palays the whiche bere not agayne that it maye please the that there myght be lefte vnto me a symple smocke wt the whiche shall couer the wombe of thy wyfe sometyme Marquyse.
And then Marpuys myght not holde hym no more from wepynge for compassyon yet he ouercame his courage and ordeyned yt there was brought to her a smocke.
Then in the presence of all knyghtes ladyes Grysylde dyspoyled her dyde of her hosen shoes put of all her ornamentes and nothynge remayned but onely the smocke.
Then stretched the rumoure all aboute that Marquys wolde departe from his wyfe all men and women were come to the palays so rowynge gretely of this thynge.
And Grysylde all naked saue her smocke bare heeded and bare fote was set vpon an horse and with company of lordes knyghtes and ladyes that all men women wepte cursynge the Marquys sorowed gretely the goodnesse of the lady yet Grysylde neuer caste teere out of her eyes was conuayed vnto house of her fader the whiche good olde man had ben alway in doubte thynkynge his lorde sholde be full euery daye of so poore a maryage.
Then he he rynge the noyse wente to mete with his doughter and brought to her her olde cote all to torne whiche he had kepte so she clothed her agayne without shewynge semblau~t of ony sorowe.
And thus dwelled Grysylde with her fader a whyle in suche humylyte pouerte in seruynge her fader as she was wonte no sorowe shewynge outwardes nor no heuy countenaunce was sene in her but recom forted her fader of his heuynesse that he had for to se his doughter to fall frome so grete hyghnesse in to so grete pouerte.
And when the Marquys se med that he had proued his true spouse ynoughe he sente to his syster that she sholde come to hym ryght nobly accompanyed with lordes ladyes sholde brynge with her his two yonge chyldren without makynge semblaunt that they were his And he made his barons sugectes to vnderstan de that he wolde take a newe wyfe and wedde a ryght notable lady whiche his syster had in kepyn ge.
So he made to assemble a ryght fayre company of knyghtes and of ladyes in his palas that sa me daye that his syster sholde aryue And he lete make ryght a fayre feest and a grete.
So he sente to Grysylde and sayd to her in this manere.
Grysylde the mayden that shall wedde shall be here to morowe.
And for that desyre that my syster her company sholde be ryght nobly receyued for that that thou knowest my condycyon and howe ought to receyue lordes and ladyes and thou knowest the chambres and places and to the entente that euery persone be well lodged after his estate and in especyall my spouse that shall be.
For wyll that thou haue all the charge And all offycers shall obaye vnto the.
So thynke theron and se that all be well ordeyned.
Grysylde answered and sayd she wolde doo it with ryght a good wyl.
And in the mornynge the company were ary ued grete was there the fceste.
And Grysylde lefte not for her lewde coote but that she wente with a glad chere to mete the mayden and newe spouse as she trowed makynge reuerence humbly kneled before her sayenge welcome my lady and also to the sone and to all men and women of the com pany thus receyued them eche after theyr estate ryght Ioyously.
And thoughe so be that she was in the habyte of a poore woman it semed by her be hauoure she was a woman of ryght grete worshyp and of meruayllous prudence so moche that the straungers meruaylled them howe suche fayre speche and suche worshypfull myght be vnder so poore an habyte.
Grysylde had made so well to be ordeyned al thynges that there was nothynge amysse at the poynte.
But with so good a wyll dre we her nyghe this mayden and the sone that she coude not departe from them.
The Marquys had made· redy all thynges as for to wedde the yonge mayden.
And when it came to the houre to synge the masse.
Then came ye Marquys and before all he called Grysylde and sayd to her howe semeth Grysylde of my newe spouse is she not fayre and goodly.
Certaynly my lorde there maye not be founde a good lyer ne a fayrer.
But of one thynge wyll pray in good fayth and counsayle that is that thou make her not sory ne prycke her not with the nedles of whiche thou hast proued that other.
For this is more yonge and more delycyously nourysshed so parad uenture she shall not suffred as yt other hathe done Then ye Marquys herynge wordes of Grysylde consyderynge her grete stablenesse strengthe and constaunce had grete meruayle of her vertue and pyte toke hym that he had gyue~ her to suffre with out sayenge the contrary.
Soo he began to saye thus in the presence of all the people.
Grysylde it ought ynoughe to suffyse prouynge of thy con staunce of thy veray faythe trouthe and grete loue hobey saunce mekenesse well proued towarde me.
And byleue it that there is noo man vnder heuen that by so many proues hathe knowne the loue of maryage as haue done in the.
And then the Marquys wente nere her whiche helde downe her heed for shame for the grete praysynge that he sayd to her.
So he enbraced her uraytely in his armes and kyssed her in sayenge.
Thou arte myne onely spouse other weddynges shal neuer ha ue.
This mayde that thou thynkest that sholde be my spouse is thy doughter myne and that other is thy sone and myne.
So knowe they all that be here that that haue done hathe ben to proue my true spouse and not to condempne her.
And haue made my chyldren to be nourysshed at Boloyne la grace with my syster not them now se them here.
Then this lady herynge the wordes of her lorde Marquys fell downe flatte for Ioy And when she came to herselfe she toke chyldren in her armes and it was no doubte but her herte had meruayllous· Ioye.
There was she greued more than euer she was before.
So the feest was grete ryght Ioyous where euery man had grete wor des of the praysynge of this lady.
And they lyued togyder. xx. yeres in grete Ioye and peas.
And the Marquys made Ianycle her fader of whome he made no grete compte before to come to palays there he helde hym in grete worshyp he maryed his chyldren hyghly after hym his sone succeded by good wyll of the lordes of comunes also.
OF Grysylde Marquyse of Saluce yt had ynoughe of vertuous strengthe constaunce haue sayd to
Nowe shall telle the of the noble Florence Empresse of rome whiche by meruaylous pacyence suffred grete aduersyte soo as it is wryten of her in the myracles of our lady.
This la dy was of souerayne beaute but she was more cha ste and vertuous.
It happened yt the Emperoure her husbande ought to go to a grete warre ryght a grete waye thens.
So he lefte to kepe his countre and his wyfe a broder that he had the whiche tempted with the enemy after the departynge of Emperoure coueyted folyly his brothers wyfe to speke shortely he helde her so shorte that she de accorde to his wyl yt for drede after prayers he wolde vse her by force he put her in pryson in a stronge toure there she was tyll the comynge of the Emperoure when it came that the tydynges were brought that sayd Emperoure was come agayne he made lady to be taken out of pryson she not wenynge that he wolde complayne on her wrongfully he dyde it to the entente yt she sholde kepe countre whyle he wolde go ayenst his broder at the arrynge of whome he toke all the euyll of this good lady and the worste yt myght be sayd by the whiche the Emperoure yt byleued hym sent his people and ordeyned yt or he sholde aryue with out makynge ony mencyon of it that she sholde be slayne.
For he wolde not se her ne fynde her onlyue.
But she meruayllynge moche of these tydynges prayed so moche to them that were commytted to do this thynge that they sholde let her go in an habyte vnknowne.
Then this noble lady wente by a straunge aduenture that happened her she was co~mytted to kepe a chylde of a grete prynce.
So it fortuned that broder of that prynce was taken with the loue of her in soo moche that after that he had requyred her ynoughe for despyte that she wolde not accorde to hym he slewe the yonge chylde by her as she slepte to entente to make her to be destroyed.
All these aduersytees whiche were not lytell suffred this noble lady the Empresse ryght pacyently by ryght stronge constaunt courage.
And when she sholde be ledde to the place where she sholde be put to dethe as she some supposed had slayne the chylde suche pyte came to the lorde and to the lady for the fayre lyfe and the grete ver tues they had sene in her that theyr hertes coude not suffre her to dye but they put her in exyle.
In the whiche place as she was in grete pouerte and was ryght pacyent deuoute towarde god his swete moder she slepte on a tyme after her prayers made to god in a fayre grene place the~ she had a vysyon of the blessyd vyrgyne Mary she sholde gader a certayne herbe yt was vnder her heed and with that herbe she sholde gete her lyuynge in helynge all maner of sykenesses.
And on a tyme after by the sayd herbe the lady had heled so many syke folkes of whom renowne sprange all abou te it fortuned that the broder of prynce that had slayne the chylde aboue sayd was syke of a grete sykenesse ryght horrybly for whom men were sen te to fetche this woma~ to hele hym.
And when she was come in to his presence she sayd to hym that he myght well se that god bete hym with his roddes and that he sholde confesse his synne openly he sholde be hole for otherwyse she myght not hele hym.
And then he moued with grete contryey on confessed his horryble wyckednesse howe he hymselfe had slayne the chylde thrughe whiche good lady was blamed yt kepte hym.
The prynce was passynge wrothe with this and wolde at all tymes do Iustyce on his broder.
But the noble lady prayed hym so moche that she appeased hym to hym and then she heled hym anone and thus this good lady yelded good for euyll after the co~maun bement of god.
It happened in the same wyse and it taryed not longe after but that the broder of the Emperour by whiche Florence was exyled felle in soo horryble sykenesse of the lyppre that he was all stynkynge.
And as the voyce wente in all the worlde howe there was a woman yt wolde hele al maner of sykenesse.
Anone men were sen te out to seke her by the commaundement of Em peroure without ony knowlege what she was.
For he demed his wyfe to be deed longe before.
And when she was come before hym she sayd to hym that it was conuenyent that he sholde confesse hym openly for otherwyse he myght not be heled.
But as he refused it longe tyme at the laste he opened all his wyckednesse that he had done to the Empresse for whiche he wyst well that god punysshed hym.
This thynge herde of the Emperour beynge passynge wrothe of that yt he trowed that he had made his true spouse to dye that he loued so moche wolde haue slayne his broder.
But the good lady opened herselfe to the Emperoure and made the peas bytwene hym and his broder.
And thus Florence recouered by the meryte of her patyence her estate and felycyte with grete Ioye of the Emperoure and of all people.
TO the purpose yet of women that be constaunte maye well be brought to remembraunce the hystory that Bocace telleth in his boke of Cent nouuelles howe it happened on a tyme in Parys as many marchauntes Lombardes and Italyens were togyder at a souper.
In whiche as they spake of many thynges they tell to spe ke of theyr wyues so moche that amonge others a Ianeuoys that was called Barnabo began gre tely to prayse his wyfe of beaute of wytte of chastyte aboue all thynges of al vertues.
So there was another outragyous felawe in the company named Ambrose whiche sayd that he was a foole to prayse his wyfe so moche and specyally of chastyte and that there was none so stronge but that one sholde ouercome her by gyftes by promyse fayre wordes so to come to his entente.
Of this thynge bega~ a grete stryfe bytwene them twayne it came so ferre forthe they layde in wager the some of. v. thousande Floryns Barnabo sayd yt other sholde not lye wt his wyfe for al yt he coude do And Ambrose layde yt he sholde he wolde bryn ge so good a token yt it sholde suffyse· yt other marchauntes dyde as moche as they coude to seas the debate but it auayled not.
Ambrose departed as soone as he myght wente to Gene whe~ he came there he enquyred gretely of lyfe of the wyfe of But to saye shortely soo moche he herde recorde of her grete goodnesse that he lost al his hope that he sholde neuer come to his entente wherof he founde hymselfe gretely abasshed repentaunt of his foly.
And he aduysed hym of a gre te malyce for it greued his herte ryght sore to lose so. v. thousande floryns.
Soo he dyde so moche yt he spake to an olde poore woman yt repayred ofte tymes to the house of good woman.
And gaue and promysed her so moche that he was put in a grete cofre and was borne in to the chambre of ye sayd good woman to whom olde poore woma~ had made to vnderstande that there was moche good gere in cofre whiche was taken her to kepe and theues laboured to robbe her and therfore she prayed her that it myght abyde a lytell whyle in her chambre to be kepte tyll they came home yt ought it to the whiche thynge good woma~ consented with a good wyll.
Ambrose whiche was in the cofre made suche a wayte vpon the lady by ny ght that he sawe her all naked and with yt wente preuyly out of cofre and toke a gyrdell a purse made with the nedle yt she had wrought by good crafte.
And after entred in to the cofre agayne soo preuyly that the lady that slepte and with her a ly tel doughter that she had felte nothynge of it.
iij. dayes olde poore woman came agayne to fetche her cofre.
Ambrose yt had grete Ioye wende yt he had well employed his entente wente to Parysagayne reported to her husbande before all the company that he had lyne with his wyfe at his ease.
And fyrste he tolde hym the token of the chambre and of ye payntynge that was in it.
After he shewed hym the purse and the gyrdell that he knewe well and sayd that the had gyuen it to hym and tolde hym all the facyon of her body and that he sawe her all naked and he tolde hym also that she had a lytell spotte as it we re a warte vnder the lyfte pappe.
Then husbande byleued stably by the tokens the wordes of Am brose of whiche yf he were sory no man meruayle And then he payed hym and co~tented hym of this v. thousande floryns.
And as soone as he myght he wente to Gene.
And before that he sholde aryue he sente expressely to his factoure that gouerned all his doynges there in whome he trusted aboue all thynges the maner howe he wolde yt he sholde sle this woman his wyfe the whiche commaun dement sene made the good woma~ to mounte on and made her to byleue that he wolde brynge her to her husbande.
And the good woma~ whiche byleued hym well wente with hym with grete Ioye.
But when they were come into a wo de he tolde her that he must nedes sle her by the co~ maundement of his mayster her housbande.
And to make the tale shorte this woma~ dyde so moche whiche was so good so fayre so moche she coude preche that he lete her go so that she sholde promyse hym yt she sholde go out of the countre.
She that was thus escaped wente vnto a towne and dyde so moche to a good woman that she bought her clothynge for a man so she cutte of her heere she arayed her in the lykenesse of a yonge ma~.
And she dyde so moche that she put herselfe with a ryche man of Cateloyne named Syguyr Ferant yt was come downe from his shyp to refresshe hym so she serued hym so well that he helde hym conten te meruayllously.
For he founde neuer so good a seruaunt this same woman called herseite Sagurat Daffynoly.
This Saguyr Ferant yt wente agayne in to the shyp Sagurat daffynoly with hym wente so moche by see tyll he came in to Alexandre and there he bought faucons ryght fayre good horses also.
And after that he wente towar de the Sowdan of Babylone with whom he had good frendeshyp and when he had byden there a whyle and the Sowdan aduysed well this Sagurat Daffynoly the whiche serued so dylygently his mayster and the whiche semed to hym so fayre and gracyous that he pleased hym meruayllously so moche that he prayed this Saguyr Ferant yt he wolde gyue hym to hym and he wolde make hym a grete mayster and he graunted hym ayenst his wyl.
And to saye shortely soo well this Sagurat Daffynoly serued the Sowdan that he trusted no man so moche as he dyde hym and was so grete mayster aboute hym that he gouerned all.
It hap pened that in a towne of the Sowdans sholde be a grete fayre where marchauntes came of all partyes the Sowdan ordeyned Sagurat yt he sholde go in to that towne to kepe the fayre to take hede of his ryght.
And as it happened as god wol de yt to that fayre was come with other Italyens that brought many Iewelles this false Ambrose aboue sayd whiche was gretely enryched with goodes of Barnabo.
Sagurat that was lyeutenaunt of the towne of the Sowdans was gretely worshypped of all people for he was a grete lorde and a grete mayster the marchauntes brought to hym euery day Iewelles to selle.
So amon ge others there came to hym that same Ambrose as he had opened a lytell cofre full of Iewelles before Sagurat to the entente yt he sholde se them And in this cofre was purse the gyrdell before sayd by the whiche as soone as Sagurat sawe it he knewe it well and toke it in his hande behelde it strongely meruayllynge gretely howe they myght come thyder.
And Ambrose that but lytell thought of yt aduenture began to laughe ryght fa ste and Sagurat yt sawe hym laughe sayd to hym Frende suppose that thou laughest of that that muse to beholde this womans thynge and forsothe it is ryght fayre.
And Ambrose answered hy~ My lorde it is at your commaundement.
But laughe for that that bethynke me of the manere howe had it.
So god gyue me Ioye sayd Sagurant praye the tell me howe thou haddest it.
By my faythe sayd Ambrose shall tell you howe gate it had it of a fayre gentylwoman yt gaue it me with whome laye all a hole nyght.
And moreouer besyde that gate fyue thousande Floryns of good golde for a wager that dyde make with the folyss he husbande of her that is named Barnabo whiche durst so lewdely laye it with me that sholde not lye with his wyfe and nowe ye vnhappy man hath slayne her also.
But he hathe better deserued to be punysshed than she.
For a ma~ may well knowe that euery woman is frayle and lyght to ouercome.
Soo there is no man yt ought to haue affyaunce in a woman.
Then knewe Sa gurat the cause of the wrathe of her housbande yt she knewe neuer before.
But as a ryght prudent and stable wysely she dyssymyled vnto the tyme yt it come to the poynte.
So she made semblaunt to haue ryght grete solace of this thynge she sayd to hym that he was ryght a good felawe and yt he wolde haue hym ryght specyally in frendeshyp that he wolde that he sholde abyde and bye marchaundyse for them bothe and that he wolde take hym ynoughe wherof in his handes.
And forth with Sagurat made to delyuer hym an house.
And for to deceyue hym the better she toke hym money in his handes And shewed hym so grete sygne of loue yt he was alwaye with hym.
And she made hym to tell that Iape before the Sowdan to make hym to laughe And to saye shortely howe the thynge was determyned.
So moche Sagurat dyde and pourchased that she dyde so moche to the Ieneuoys that were in that countre after that that she knewe the estate of Baruabo yt was fallen in pouerte.
what for the grete fynaunce that he had payed and for the grete sorowe that he toke therfore that Barna bo sholde come ouer in to that countre by the com maundement of the Sowdan and to make ye tale shorte when he was come in to that countre he ca me before ye Sowdan.
But or he came he had wel enfourmed the Sowdan howe Ambrose lyed in makynge his auaunte yt he made of this woman.
And she prayed hym also that in case that the trou were come to knowlege yt he wolde punysshe Iustely the sayd Ambrose the whiche thynge whe~ Ambrose Barnabo were come before the Sowdan Sagurat began to saye in this maner.
Ambrose it pleaseth to our lorde that is here that thou tell the Iape all alonge howe thou dydest gete of Barnabo that here is. v. thousande floryns wher of thou haste tolde hym by what maner thou dyde lye with his wyfe.
And then Ambrose chaunged co loure as he to whom the trouthe myght vnethes suffre to couer soo an vntrue fraude for it was to hym a sodayne thynge of the whiche he toke no he de.
Then he toke to hym a lytell maner and answe red.
My lorde it is no force thoughe tell it not.
And then Barnabo full of sorowe of shame prayed yt he myght neuer here of it more and that he wolde lette hym leue.
But Sagurat answered as in laughynge that he sholde not go and that it was conuenyent that he lete hym tell it.
Then Ambrose whiche sawe that he was constrayned began to say all with a tremblynge voyce that he had made Barnabo to vnderstande and all as he had tolde them.
And when he had ended his reason Sagurat asked of Barnabo yf it were true that Ambrose had sayd and he answered and sayd ye without fayle.
And howe sayd Sagurat be ye well certayne that this man here laye with your wyfe for that that he tolde to you certayne tokens be you suche a beest that you can not knowe that by wayes ynowe fraudelently he myght knowe ye facyon of her body without lyenge with her and ye haue for this cause made your wyfe to dye ye are worthy to dye yourselfe for ye haue no suffycyent profe.
Then Barnabo had grete drede And then Sagurat that wolde no longer be styll and that her semed tyme to speke sayd to Ambrose False traytoure saye the trouthe without makynge the to be tourmented.
And ye woman of whom auauntest the is not yet deed but she is not ferre hens to say ye contrary to thy false lesynges.
There was a grete assemble what of lordes of the Sowdans as of grete foyson of Lombardes whiche meruayllously herkened this thynge.
And to saye it shortely this Ambrose was so ledde yt he confessed before the Sow+dan and all the people all the fraude and howe he had wrought by coueytyse to gete those.
when Barnabo herde this almost he was out of hymselfe for yt he wyste none other but that his wyfe was slayne.
But the good woman came to hym and sayd what woldest thou gyue hym that wolde yelde the thy wyfe agayne alyue hole and chaste Barnabo answered sayd that he wolde gyue all that euer he coude make in the worlde.
Barnabo broder and frende howe is that thou knowest not her.
And as he was abasshed that he wyst not what he dyde she vnbotened her brest and sayd to hym am thy dere felawe yt thou haste condempned to the dethe without cause.
And then they embraced eche other in meruayllous grete Ioy.
And the Sowdan and all the people was gretely admeruayled of this thynge and ryght gretely pray sed the grete vertue of this woman and they gaue her grete gyftes.
And all the goodes that was perteynynge to Ambrose was gyuen to her and he was put vnto the dethe ryght myscheuously And ryght so Barnabo and the good woman his wyfe tourned home agayne in to theyr countree and there they lyued togyder longe tyme after in prosperyte and Ioye.
Here it sheweth howe after that that Ryghtwysnesse had tolde of these constaunce my lady Xp~ine asked her yf it be true that dyuers men saye that there ben but fewe women true in theyr amourouse lyfe and therto a~swered ryghtwysnes.
WHen my lady ryghtwysenesse had tol de me all these thynges and ynoughe of others whiche leue for shortnesse So as of Loonce that was a woma~ of Grece the whiche wolde neuer for tourmentes that ony man wolde do to her accuse two men with yt whiche she was aquaynted but cutte of her tonge with her tethe before the Iuge to put hym out of hope that she sholde tell hym by strengthe of tourmentes.
And ynowe of other ladyes gentylwomen whiche were of constaunte courage that they had leuer to drynke poyson and dye than to bowe ayenst ryght and trouthe.
And then sayd to her Madame ye haue shewed me ynoughe grete constaunce in the courage of women and all other vertues that truely there maye no more be sayd of no man.
Soo meruayle me gretely howe so many worshypfull ladyes that ha ue ben so wyse so well lettred that haue goten the fayre style of endytynge to make fayre bokes hath suffred so longe without sayenge contrary so many errours to be wytnessed ayenst them by dyuers men when that they knewe well yt it was of grete wronge.
Answere my dere frende this questyon is lyght ynoughe to assoyle thou mayst se by that that is sayd before that ye grete vertues of these ladyes of whome haue tolde here abo ue in dyuers werkes dyfferenced one frome another ententyfely occupyed and not all in one selfe thynge.
This werke was reserued to the to make and not to them an to people of good vnderstandynge ye women were praysed ynoughe without other wrytynge.
And as to the longnesse of tyme passed without gayne saynge all thynges cometh well to poynte ynoughe to ye beholdynge of the longe worlde how longe suffreth god heresyes to be in the worlde ayenst the holy lawe whiche yet endureth yt he hathe not destroyed them.
So it is of many other thynges yt ben suffred longe without gayne sayenge syth they be reproued at ye last Then Xp~ine sayd to her.
But yelde me certayne yt many noyses groweth amonge the euyll sayers of this present werke whiche wyll saye yt yf it be true yt some women haue ben ben good yet they be not so al Answere.
what meruayle thoughe they be not all noted that of the company of Ihesu cryst there were but. xij. yet was one ryght euyll these men durst saye yt all women sholde be good what shol de they be than suppose when all men be parfyte that the women shall folowe them.
Madame nowe let vs leue thyse questyons but a lytel yssuynge out of termes wherof we haue spoken tyll nowe ryght gladly wolde ma ke you some demaundes to ye same purpose yf yt knewe yt it sholde not noy you for that the mater thoughe it be founded vpon the lawe of kynde it cometh not all by the attemperynge of reason.
And she answered vnto me dere frende say what thou wylte.
For the dyscyple yt asketh of ye mayster ought not to be reproued thoughe he aske yt he desyreth to knowe.
Madame there renneth in ye worl de a naturall lawe of men to women and women to men not the lawe made by the stablynge of peo ple but by carnal enclynacyon by the whiche they loue eche other of ryght grete and stronge loue by one pleasaunt tyme so they knowe not to what cause ne wherfore suche loue one of another is fyx ed in them.
And in this loue yt is comune ynoughe it is called amourous lyfe ye men say comunely yt women thoughe they promyse there he but fe we abydynge in one place of lytell loue.
Ryght subtyll faynte all yt cometh of the lyghtnesse of theyr courage.
And amonge all other auctours accuseth them of yt Ouyde in his boke of ye crafte of loue gyueth them ryght grete charge this Ouy de sayth others in ye same wyse when they haue blamed ynoughe ye women vpon yt thynge yt they put in theyr bokes as well of descyuable condycyons of them as of theyr wyckednesse yt they doo it for ye comune welthe to ye entente to aduyse ye me~ of theyr cauteyles ye better to eschewe them so as of ye serpent whiche is hydde vnder an herbe.
So please it you myne owne lady to teche me the trou th of this thynge.
My dere frende as to that yt they say yt women be desceyuable wote not what shall say to the more.
For thyselfe hath treated suffycyentely ynoughe of this matter as well ayenst this Ouyde as ayenst others in thyne epystle of ye god of loue.
And in the epystles vpon the Romaunce of the rose.
But vpon the poynte yt thou hast touched to me yt they saye yt they doo yet for the comune welthe.
shall shewe the yt it was nothynge for yt cause se here the reason.
The comune profyte in a Cyte or a countre or in comunalte of people is none other thynge but one profyte the generall welthe is of whiche eche one hath his parte.
But the thynge yt sholde be done in profyte some and not to some sholde be called the pryuate welthe or propre not ye comune.
And yet yt shall do the lesse good yt is taken away from one and gyuen to another.
And this thynge ought to be called not pryuate welthe or propre but ryght grete extorcyon made to another in fauoure of the partye.
So thou mayst se perceyue clerely yt they do it fauourably in preiudyce of one parte to his gryefe to sustayne yt other.
For they spake not to ye women in aduysynge them yt they kepe them from the awaytes of men.
And yet it is a thynge ryght certayne often tymes yt they desceyue women by theyr cauteylous false semblaunt.
And it is noo doubte yt the women be as well in the nombre of ye creatures erthely as be the men.
Then conclu de yt they sholde do for comune welthe yt is to vn derstande of. ij. partes they sholde haue spoken as well to ye women yt they sholde beware of the men as they haue done to the men to beware of ye women.
But for to leue to goo to questyon and in folowynge ye other yt is to vnderstande women be not of so lytell loue there as theyr hartes is sette that they be more stabler tha~ they say it shall suffy se to proue it by ensample of them haue perceyuered vnto the dethe.
And fyrst shal tell the of noble Dydo quene of Cartage of whome it is spo ken here aboue of her grete valoure as thyselfe ha the touched other tymes.
Here it speketh of Dydo quene of Cartage to purpose loue is stable in a woman.
Dydo quene of Cartage beynge in her cyte in Ioy and peas reygnynge gloryously come by fortune Eneas fledde frome Troye after the destruccyon of ye Du ke capytayne of many Troyans cast by dyuers tempestes theyr shyppes broken theyr vytayles fayled grete losse of people.
Desyrous of rest we ry of rouynge by see busy to gete lodgynge aryued at porte of Cartage as for doubte of mysta kynge he wolde not be so hardy to take lo~de wt out lycence of of the quene but sente to her to knowe whyder it pleased her or no.
But noble lady full of worshyp and of worthynes whiche knewe well that the Troyans were of more reputacyon for tyme then was ony nacyon of the worlde.
And this Duke Eneas was of the noble blode royall of Troye.
She gaue hym not onely lycence that he sholde take the lande But she herselfe with a noble company of lordes and ladyes and gentyl women came agaynst hym vnto the see syde and receyued hym all his company with grete worshyp she ledde hym in to her cyte and gretely worshypped hym feested hym eased hym why sholde make the tale longe.
So longe Eneas was there at soiourne ease and reste that he thought but lytell of all the tourmentes that he had before And so moche was theyr hauntynge loue whiche subtylly can sette harteson fyre made that one to loue that other.
But after that that experyence shewed she loued moche better Eneas than he dy de her.
For notwithstandynge that he had gyuen to her his faythe that he sholde neuer take other woman but that he sholde be hers euermore he departed after that that she had refresshed hym wt good and ease his shyppes garnysshed full of trea soure and goodes as she that had not spared her goodes there as the herte was holly sette wente away without takynge leue by nyght ryght tray tourously without knowynge of her and thus he payed his hostesse.
The whiche departynge was to her so grete sorowe of hym that she loued so mo che that she wolde forsake all Ioye her lyfe also.
And in dede after that she had wepte and wayled ynoughe she cast herselfe in a grete fyre that she le te make and so she brente herselfe.
And others say that she slewe herselfe with the swerde of Eneas.
And thus pyteously ended noble quene Dydo whiche had ben so gretly worshypped she passed in renowne all other women in her tyme.
Ca. lv. MEdea doughter of the kynge of Colcos whiche had so moche vnderstan dynge loued ofto grete loue and stable Iason.
This Iason was a knyght of Grece ryght manly in armes.
He herde tell that in Ile of Colcos whiche was in the countre of whiche the fader of Medea was kynge there was a shepe that semed as impossyble to conquere.
And yet it was prophecyed that by a knyght it sholde be conquered.
Iason whiche vnderstode this thynge as ryght desyrous to encreas his renowne from good to better departed from Grece with a grete company to the entente to proue hym in this conquest.
And as he was ary ued in the foresayd countre of Colcos the kynge of the londe sayd to hym that it was impossyble by the prowesse of armes of man the golden fleece myght be goten.
For it was a thynge made by en chautement and as many knyghtes as assayed it were perysshed.
So he wolde not that he sholde lese his lyfe in suche manere.
And Iason sayd shor tely that syth he had taken the enterpryse in hande he wolde not leue to dye therfore.
Medea the dou ghter of kynge whiche sawe Iason of suche beau te so grete renowne of the lygnage of a kyn ge semed that he were a good maryage for her that he myght better employe his loue to her she thought to kepe hym from the dethe.
For grete py te toke her suche a knyght sholde perysshe so.
So she spake to hym longe at laysoure to say shortely she toke hym charmes enchauntementesas she coude all taught hym all ye maner howe by what waye he sholde conquere golden fleece so Iason sholde promyse her to take her to wyfe without hauynge other to loue her truely.
For after that that he was come to his entente he lefte her for another wherof as sone as he had lefte her she fell in suche dyspayre there was neuer after Ioy in her herte Of Tysbe the mayden.
Ca· lvj. OUyde telleth in his booke of Methamorphoseos that in the cyte of Babylone were. ij. noble ryche Cytezynes ryght nyghe neyghboures yt walles of theyr houses they dwelled in Ioy ned togvder.
ij. men had. ij. chyldren fayre aboue all others yt one a sone yt was named Pyra mys and yt other a doughter whiche was named Tysbe.
ij. chyldren whiche yet were without malyce as of age of. vij. yeres loued so parfytely togyder they myght not abyde one frome another.
And it was theyr guyse alwaye euery day to ryse in the mornynge togyder to take theyr refeccyon of theyr faders for to go to play wt other chyldren of theyr age to entente yt they myght be alway togyder at al theyr playes one myght se them togyder thus endure tyll they were waxe~ grete as they grewe in age so encreased flambes of theyr loue so moche by theyr hauntynge they were perceyued so some had suspeccyon by the whiche it was reported to the moder of Tysbe The whiche toke suche wrathe of this thynge she shytte her faste in her chambres and sayd that she wolde kepe her well ynoughe fro the hauntyn ge of Pyramys.
Of this pryson were ryght sorow full these two louers that theyr wepynges com playntes were ryght pyteous.
And so was this so rowe to them ryght harde for that none of theym myght se other.
This dystresse endured passynge longe the whiche made not lesse theyr loue ne ma de them nothynge slower for so moche as they sawe not eche other but alway encreased the hete of theyr age so moche that they were come to the age of. xv. yeres.
It happened on a daye so as fortune wolde that Thysbe that thought alwaye in her loue all wepynge in her chambre beholdynge the walle that was bytwene ij. houses in sayen ge pyteously.
thou walle of harde stone whiche makest the departynge bytwene my loue and me yf there were ony pyte in the thou woldest cleue in sondre to the entente that myght se hym that haue desyred so moche.
And as she sayd these wordes she sawe by aduenture in a corner walle cleued by the whiche she perceyued the lyght of that other parte and then she dygged in the clefte with the pendant of her gyrdell for other toole had she none ye hole encreased so moche ye she put thrughe the pendant to the entente that Pyramys sholde perceyue it.
ij. louers often tymes assembled to speke togyder in the foresayd hole where they made theyr pyteous complayntes.
And at the last constrayned by grete loue they toke cou~sayle that they wolde stele awaye by nyght fro theyr faders and moders.
And that eche of them sholde fynde other at a welle vnder a whyte mulbery tre where they were wonte to playe in theyr youthe.
And as Tysbe whiche loued more was the fyrst come to the welle abydynge her loue she beynge aferde of a lyon that she herde comynge to drynke at the well she fled to hyde her in a busshe there by.
And in goynge she lete fall a whyte couerchefe the whi che the lyon founde and caste vpon it the entrayles of beestes that he had deuoured Pyramys came or Tysbe durste come out of the busshe.
And for that he founde the couerchefe of Tysbe whiche he perceyued by the mone lyght charged with the entraylles trowed verely that his loue was deuoured.
So he had so grete sorowe that he slewe hymselfe with his swerde.
And as he was in dyen ge Tysbe came whiche founde hym in that poynt and by the token of the couerchefe she sawe hym haue in his hande she knewe ye cause of euyll aduenture wherof she had suche sorowe she wolde lyue no longer.
And when she sawe that the spyry te of her loue was out of his body after many gre te that she made she slewe herselfe with the same swerde.
THe noble yonge woman Hero loued not moche lesse ye Hander than dyde Tysbe Pyramys.
For as this Hander to kepe the worshyp of her loued better to put hym in grete peryll tha~ she sholde be blamed for hym to entente theyr loue myght endure the longer without espyenge of ony people he toke suche a maner to se his lady often tymes.
He rose by nyght from his bedde to the entente no man sholde knowe it.
And wente alone to an arme of ye see ryght large whiche was called Herles passed ouer swymmynge tyll he ca me to a castell named Habydon stode vpon the ryuere in other syde where Hero dwelled whiche abode at a wyndowe in the longe nyghtes of wynter helde out a bronde of fyre at the wyndo we to the entente he sholde come the ryght way thyder.
ij. louers contynued this lyfe many yeres tyll fortune had enuye of theyr solacyous lyfe thought to trouble theym.
For as it happened on a tyme of wynter by the woodnesse of see the ryuere was full of tempest passynge depe peryllous the whiche tempest durynge so longe without seasynge they thought it ryght longe one to se that other whiche was ryght noyous to the .ij. louers and gretely they complayned them of wynde of the tempest that endured so longe At the last the Hander whome grete desyre chased by that he sawe in a nyght the bronde at ye wyndowe Hero helde It semed hym she called hym and he thought grete cowardyse he put hym not in peryll that he wente not for drede of whiche he doubted hym.
And she wolde fayne defende hy~ he sholde not go to put hym in suche peryll yf she myght.
Notwithstandynge she helde out bronde at aduenture to teche hym the ryght way yf he wolde nedes do it.
So thus happened the vnhap py aduenture the Hander put hymselfe in the ryuere myght not stryue agaynst the flode of wa ter whiche bare hym soo ferre that he must nedes drowne.
The good Hero to whom her herte gaue as it happened seased neuer wepynge.
And when ye clere day appered as she slepte not wente agay ne to wyndowe where she had ben all the nyght And she sawe ye body of her loue flete vpon the wa ter nyghe ye brynke.
She wolde not lyue no longe after caste her in to ye see dyde so moche she her loue in her armes and so dyed and thus she was perysshed.
BOcace telleth in boke of Cent Nou uelles a prynce of Salerne named Cancre had a fayre doughter ryght gentyll courtoys whiche was named Sysmonde.
He loued this doughter of soo grete loue that with grete payne he wolde accorde vnto the styrynge of his lordes to marye her to the Erle of Champayne.
But as she that sholde not abyde longe in maryage this Erle dyed and ye fader toke her home agayne to hym thynkynge neuer to marye her agayne.
The lady whiche was nourysshed tenderly and was ryght fayre in the floure of her youthe.
And whiche yt knewe the wyll of her fader that she sholde be ma ryed agayne wente and aduysed her amonge all the seruauntes of her fader of a squyer the whiche aboue al the others thoughe there were grete foy son of knyghtes and gentyll men he semed to her fayre and good worthy to be loued.
And so moche that she thought to passe her youthe more Ioy ously to take her pleasau~ce.
And longe tyme or she wolde dyscouer this thynge she behelde euery day when she sate at her faders table the maner coun tenaunce and condycyons of the squyer whiche was named Guyscart so moche that from day to day he semed to her more parfyte amonge all thyn ges.
By the whiche she called hym on a day before her sayd to hym in this manere Guyscart fayre frende the trust that haue in your bounte beaute wysdome counsayleth me to dyscouer to you of dyuers thynges that toucheth me ryght secrete the whiche wolde not tell to none other body.
But wolde or yt tell it you to haue your trouthe that shal neuer be opened by you.
Madame you nede not to doubte that there shall be nothynge knowne by me that ye tell me and for that assure you by my trouthe.
And then sayd Sysmonde to hym Guyscarte knowe it for trouthe yt my pleasaunce is in a gentylman that loue and wylloue and for that that may not well speke to hym nor by whome to sende hym my wyll.
Nowe beholde yf haue grete truste in you aboue all others when wyll put myne honoure in your handes.
And there he set hym on his knees and sayd.
Madame knowe wel that ye haue su che wytte and goodnesse that ye wolde not do the thynge vnconuenable.
Soo thanke you ryght mekely that ye trust in me more than in another.
Nowe co~maunde your good pleasure to me your seruaunt and shall obey to my power and serue hym yf knewe whiche he were yt were so happy to haue the loue of a lady of so grete worthynesse as ye are.
For certes he hath not fayled of a noble loue.
When Sysmonde yt had wyll to proue hym had herde hym speke so wysely.
Frende Guyscart knowe it that thou arte he that haue chosen for myne one ly loue and in whom wyll take all my pleasaun ce.
For me semeth that the noblesse of thy courage and the good maners of whiche thou arte full yel deth the worthy to haue an hyghe loue.
The yonge man had grete Ioye of this thynge thanked ryght humbly and shortely to say longe tyme con tynued theyr loue without that ye ony tydynges was felte therof.
But fortune enuyous of theyr so lace wolde no longer suffre these.
ij. louers in Ioy but tourned theyr dysporte in to grete and bytter sorowe by meruaylous aduenture.
It fortuned in a somers day yt Sysmonde dysported her in a gar dyne with her maydens at yt houre her fader that had none other welthe but when he sawe her wen te alone in to her chambre to dysporte hym wt her.
But when he founde ye wyndowes shytte and the curteynes of the bedde drawne that there was no body there trowed that she had ben a slepe.
So he wolde not awake her but layde hym on a lytell couche there he slepte strongly.
when Sysmonde thought yt she had ben longe ynoughe in ye gardyne she wente to her chambre layde her on her bedde as for to slepe all her women were voyded shytte the dore vpon her not perceyuynge yt her fader or ony other was there when she sawe her selfe alone she rose from her bedde wente to seke Guyscart whiche was in one of he wardrobes brought hym in to her chambre.
And so as they de uysed bytwene them two within the curteyns as they yt trowed yt they were alone the prynce awoke vnderstode yt there was a man with his doughter he had so grete sorowe of ye thynge yt of payne the consyderacyon yt he sholde dyshonoure his doughter myght not kepe hym·but that he had de parted them.
Neuerthelesse he suffred vnderstode wel who it was dyde so moche yt he lepte out of the chambre they not knowynge of hym.
And when these two louers had ben ynoughe togyder Guyscarte departed.
But the prynce that had made watche vpon hym anone he made hym to be ta ken prysoned hym.
And after wente to his doughter they beynge alone in ye chambre ye eyesfull of teeres and with grete sorowe began to saye to her.
Sygysmonde trowed to haue in a dou ghter aboue all women fayre chaste wyse·but of so moche am more ouercome to say as thou ghe had trowed the contrary.
For yf had not sene it with myne eyes there was nothynge that sholde haue made me byleue that thou had be sup prysed wt the loue of ony man·but it had ben thyne housbande.
But as of yt am certayne ye sorowe therof shall be the tourment of myne age.
And of that lytell tyme yt haue to lyue that whiche en grudgeth moost my wrathe is that trowed to be of more noble courage then ony woman bor ne.
And se well the contrary by that thou hast taken the to one of ye leest of myne housholde.
For yf thou wolde haue done suche a thynge thou my ghtest haue founde some of more noblesse worshyp in my courte then when thou toke Guyscart.
To whome trowe to yelde the sorowe yt haue by his cause.
For wolde yt thou knowe it that shall make hym to dye the same wolde do by the yf myght destroy fro myne herte the loue yt haue in ye more gretter than euer fader had to his doughter whiche tourneth me fro it when Sysmonde vnderstode this thynge that her fader co~ de~pned hym to deth yt she loued so moche she was so sorowfull that she wolde fayne dye yt houre yet by ryght stable courage constaunte chere wt out castynge ony teeres out of her eyes thoughe she was dysposed to lyue no longer she a~swered thus Fader syth that it is so that fortune hathe made yt to be knowne whiche that wolde so fayne haue couered.
haue noo nede to make noo request of you excepte yf wyste to aske of you remyssyon lyfe to hym that ye manace of dethe.
wolde bese che you to take myne and leue his.
For in that yt aske you pardon ye wolde do to hym as ye saye wolde not aske it.
For of so moche make you certayne that by his dethe ye shall sle me.
But of this thynge that moueth you to so grete wrathe ayenst vs haue ye not cause to take it vnto your owne blame.
For ye that be of fless he haue not ye engendred a doughter of fless he not of stone nor of yron.
And ye ought to thynke thoughe ye be olde what and howe grete is the heuynesse of youthe lyuynge in delyces and at ease and the pryckynges whiche are to passe.
And syth that sawe that ye thought neuer mary me agayne felynge me yonge prycked with lustynesse fell to loue this same gentylman and not without a cause ne without grete delyberacyon consented and accorded to myne herte that he desyred yet or that aduysed well the condycy ons of hym parfyte in all vertues more than ony other of your courte and that ye may knowe your selfe whiche haue nourysshed hym what other thynge is noblesse but vertues for it cometh not of fless he blode whiche is but donge so ye haue not cause to saye that haue taken me to the leest noble of your courte and thus ye haue no cause of wrathe towarde vs your owne blame co~sydered But at all yf ye wyll take so grete punysshment of hym for that trespace it perteyneth not to be taken but it sholde be taken of wronge of synne.
But it is more ryght yt haue it whiche styred hym therto whiche thought that he ought to haue it.
For certes it sholde haue ben to moche in the herte of a vylayne to haue refused a lady of suche parentage Ought ye then to employe this trespace all vpon hym and not vpon me.
But yet he was not appeased to warde Guyscart but in the mornynge made hym to be slayne commaunded that the herte sholde be taken out of the body the whiche herte fader put in a ryght ryche cuppe of golde and by a secremessagere sent it vnto his doughter and he sholde say that he sent her that presente to enioy of that thynge yt she loued moost.
The messagere came be+fore Sysmonde and made his present and sayd yt he was charged therwith.
And she toke the cuppe and opened it and anone she knewe the aduenture.
But thoughe she had sorowe inestymable she was not dysmayed of her hyghe courage but ma+de her answere to hym in this wyse without chau~+gynge her chere sayenge.
My frende say to pryn+ce that one thynge perceyue well that is this yt to so noble a herte he hathe gyuen suche a sepulture that perteyneth to hym.
For other than golde precyous stones ought he not haue.
Tha~ she stouped ouer the cuppe and kyssed the herte in sayenge pyteously.
Cursed be the cruelte of that maketh me to see the in this plyte. ye were alwaye present in myne herte and the veray eyen of my thought.
Now hast thou passed the course of thy noble lyfe by dyuerse fortunes but yet thou hast suche asepul ture of thyne enemye as thy worthynesse hath deserued so it pertayneth well that do myn offyce that thou be wasshed bayned with the teeres of her that thou loued so moche and thou shalte not fayle therof and with yt thy soule shal not be longe without myne.
For that is no reason but yt shall make ye companye in short tyme yet maulgre fortune that hath be to the so co~trarye there is come to the so moche of wele nowe that my cruell fader bath sent to me to thentent yt thou be more worshypped and that speke to the or that dye and that my soule maye se thyn of whom desyre the companye aboue all thynge for knowe well yt thy spyryte desyreth myne suche wordes others ynowe sayd Sysinonde so pyteous that ony persone that harde it ought to haue grete pyte of it.
And so depely she wepte that it semed she had. ij. welles in her hede yt ran wtout ceasynge in to cup wtout makynge noyse or crye but wt alowe voyce kyssynge alwaye herte.
The ladys gentylwomen were about her had grete meruayle of this thynge for they knewe nothynge of aduenre ne what was the cause of grete sorowe.
So they wept all for pytye and payned them to reco~forte her but it auayled not in vayne they asked her moost pryue women the cause of her sorowe.
And she ouercome wt meruayllous sorowe whan she had wepte ynough sayd.
ryght welbyloued herte haue done al myne ossyce that longed to nowe there resteth nought to doo but to sende my soule to make companye with thyne.
And wt these wordes she lyfte her vp and opened an almarye toke out a boxe where she had put venymous herbes to dyssolue in water to haue it redy whan the cause happed.
So she cast water in to the cuppe where the herte was without ony maner drede dranke it all layde her done vpo~ her bed abydyn ge the dethe holdynge cup alwaye ryght stratly whan women sawe her body chau~ge by sygnes of dethe sorowynge meruayllously cursed fader whiche was gone a lytell whyle to dysporte hym.
And than he came at the houre that the venym by gan to stretche aboute in the vaynes and he ful of sorowe of ye case yt was happed repentynge hym of yt he had done bygan to speke to her by swete wor des trowyng to haue reco~forted her makynge gre te sorowe his doughter a~swered hy~ Cancre reser ue thy teeres tyl a nother tyme for here is no nede of the~ desyre the~ not yu resemblest ye mad ma~ yt slewe a ma~ after wepte tor it had it not be better yt yu haddest let thy douzter lyue at plesau~ce secretly louyng a ma~ tha~ to se her hard deth by thy cruelte to thy grete sorowe.
The whiche dethe shall make that thynge that was secrete to appere openly then she myght speke no more for her herte brake holdynge the cuppe ryght straytely in her handes And anone after her ye fader dyed for sorowe.
And thus ended Sysmonde the doughter of the prynce of Salerne Of Lyzabeth and of other louers.
ALso Bocace telleth in the saydbooke of Cent Nouuelles that in the cyte of Messyne in Italy there was a yonge woman named Lyzabeth ye whiche iij. bretherne of hers by theyr coueytousnes taryed her of maryenge.
And they had a factoure and a gouernoure of all theyr busynesses ryght fayre and a goodly yonge man whiche that theyr fader had nourysshed all his youthe.
It happened by the contynuell frequentacyon yt they had bytwene them they loued eche other, and this loue contynued a whyle ryght Ioyously.
But at the last as these bretherne perceyued as they that wolde not make grete noyse for dyshonourynge of theyr syster were aduysed to sle hym.
And in dede they ledde this yonge man whiche was named Laurence with them vnto a manere of theues when they were come thyder they had hym in to a gardyne and slewe hym and buryed hym amonge the trees.
And they came home agayne to theyr house made them to byleue yt they had sente this Laurence ferre in to another in theyr message.
Lyzabeth whiche loued Laurence of so gre te loue was nothynge at hertes ease bycause she had lost ye presence of her loue her herte gaue her straungely of this matter so moche yt in a tyme co~ strayned of ryght loue myght not suffre noo longer but yt she of one other bretherne where yt Laurence was why he taryed so longe.
By whiche her broder answered her ryght tyersly sayd what perteyneth it to ye to knowe then Ly zabeth perceyued certaynly they had slayne lau rence for ye whiche she made meruaylous sorowe when she was alone she wepte all nyght ryght depely wtout takynge ony maner of rest in co~playnynge hym yt she loued so moche ther with she became ryght syke for ye whiche sykenesse she requyred her bretherne yt they wolde let her go to dysporte her at theyr maner wtout the Cyte a lytel whyle when they had graunted her she wente thyder she to whome her herte gaue all this ad uenture wente alone in to ye gardyne where this Laurence lay deed lokynge all aboute she sawe where ye body was buryed by the raysynge of the newe erthe then she dygged ye erthe wt a pycoys yt she founde there so moche tyll she founde body Then embrasynge ye body by grete dystresse made sorowe out of measure.
But for so moche that she knewe that she myght not be longe there for fere she sholde be perceyued toke ye body out of ye erthe and toke the heed of her loue yt her bretherne had smyten of and knytted it in a couerchefe buryed it in one of her grete pottes wheron they vse to set herbes plantes an herbe aboue it swete ly smellynge yt is called Basylycon.
And wt this potte she tourned home to her house agayne but she had this potte in so grete cherete yt she coude not parte from it but put it in one of her chambre wyndowes in the ayre.
And she watered it with none other water but with the teeres of her eyen nyght and daye.
And this thynge endured no lytell whyle as some of these men saye women forgeteth lyghtly but it semed yt her sorowe encreased from day to daye thus was the Basylycon waxen fayre grete for the fatnesse of the erthe to tell shortely so moche she ledde this lyfe vpon ye potte yt it happened yt some of her neyghboures perceyued howe she wepte without seasynge at this wyndowe vpon the potte tolde to her bre therne the meruayle of her sorowe.
And by ny ght stale awaye the potte wherof in the mornyn ge there began to sprynge a newe noyaunce whe~ she founde not her potte for all grace she requy red yt she myght haue her potte agayne she wol de quyte it them thoughe she sholde gyue her par te of all her other goodes and sayd pyteously in complaynynge.
Alas in what houre brought my moder me forthe in to this worlde with my cruel bretherne whiche hateth my symple pleasau~ce that they wyll not leue me a lytell poore potte of Basylycon whiche cost them nought nor yelde it me agayne aske them nothynge elles for my maryage for my dowry.
Alas it is not grete ye desyre of them thus she lete it passe but her soro we neuer seased so moche yt she layde her on a bed was sore syke.
In the whiche sykenesse what so euer one offred her she set not by it ne by no Ioye in ye worlde but onely her potte thus she dyed pyteously.
And thynke not yt this thynge is a le synge for there they made a songe of ye complaynte of this of her pot whiche they synge yet.
what shall tell ye more sholde holde ye to longe yf tolde ye the hystoryes of women in suche maner of loue taken whiche haue loued of ryght grete loue.
Of another also telleth Boca ce of whome ye housbande made to eate ye herte of her loue whiche neuer ete after.
The same dyde ye lady of Fayllee whiche loued the Chastelayne of Coussy by to grete loue.
Tyamere whiche loued Hercules so moche yt she slewe herselfe whe~ he was deed.
So it is no dou bte there is ryght grete loue in a co~staunte woma~ where she setteth her herte thoughe it be so yt there be some wome~ lyght.
But these pyteous ensamples ynowe of others yt myght tell the ought not to be ye cause to moue courage of wo men to put them in this peryllous see dampnable of lewde loue.
For alway the ende therof is to them grete preiudyce in grefe of body goodes or dyshonoure in soule whiche is most.
So they shalldo as wyse wome~ whiche by good wyt can eschewe not to gyue audyence to the~ whiche wt out seasynge trauaylleth the~ to deceyue theym in suche case.
Ca. lx. NOwe haue tolde of grete foyson of ladyes of the whiche hystoryes maketh mencyon but for to saye of all the processe sholde be infynyte the whiche haue not taken in honde it suttyseth me without more that brynge forth some in wytnessynge to saye the contrary to that thou hast purposed that dyuers men say.
wyl tell the in conclusyon of some that hathe ben in worlde gretely praysed by dyuers accyde~tes more tha~ by grete vertues.
Iuno doughter of Sa turnus of Opys after the sayenges of poetes erroure of paynymes was gretely praysed abo ue all other women of yt lawe more for her good fortune than for ony other excellence.
She was syster of Iupyter and maryed vnto hym whome they called souerayne god for the grete rychesse fortune in whiche she lyued habounded with her housbande was reputed as goddesse of rychesse.
And those madde people byleued for her stature that she had after her dethe that they were the better fortuned they graunted to her also co~forte of ryghtes of maryage by her helpe the women recouered in praynge to her and they made temples of her all aboute awters preestes playes sacrefyses thus was she lo~ge worshyp ped of the grekes and of them of Cartage with that she was brought to Rome after and put in Capytole in the Celle of Iupyter her housbande.
And there she was worshypped of Romaynes were lordes of the worlde with many dyuers cerymonyes by longe tyme.
Also Europe yt was doughter of Agenor kynge of Phenyce was also gretely praysed for that that Iupyter whiche loued her named the thyrde parte of worlde after her name.
And it is to knowe that of the names of dyuers women hathe ben dyuers landes Cytees and townes named so as Englonde of a woman that was called Angle and so of others.
Iocasta quene of Thebes was praysed for her grete infortune for by mysaduenture she had wed ded her owne sone after that yt she had slayne his owne fader wherof none of theym bothe knewe.
And she sawe that he dyspayred when he knewe aduenture after sawe hym slayne bytwene two sones yt she had.
Also Meduse or Bargon was praysed for her grete beaute she was doughter of the ryche kynge Porce of whom Royalme was ryght haboundauntly closed with see.
This Me duse as the auncyent hystoryes sayth was of soo meruayllous beaute that not onely she passed all other women but that is a meruayllous thynge and aboue nature.
She had her countenaunce so pleasaunt with her beaute of body and of vysage of her yelowe heeres as longe thredes of golde cryspe that she drewe euery mortall creature yt she behelde to her so that she was unmouable to all people.
And therfore the fable fayneth that she became a stone.
Helayne wyfe of Menelans kynge of Lacedemoyne doughter of Tyndarus kynge of Ceballe of Leyda his wyfe was gretely renowmed for her grete beaute.
And for that that it happened for bycause of the rauyss hynge that Parys made of her whiche was cause by the whiche Troye was destroyed of this quene thoughe it be sayd of the beaute of others the hystoryes affermeth that she was the fayrest woma~ that euer was borne of moder.
And therfore these Poetes saye that she was engendred of Iupyter the grete god.
Also Polexene that was the meke doughter of kynge Pryamus was also as fayre a mayde as is made mencyon in ony hystore and with she was ryght stable constaunte of courage as she shewed in receyuynge the deth without vysege or when she was heeded vpon the tombe of Achylles then she sayd that it was more agreable to her to dye than to be ledde in seruage.
Of others ynowe myght tell whi che that leue for shortenesse.
Here speketh Xp~ine and ryghtwysnesse answe reth ayenst them that women drawe me~ to them by theyr gaynesse.
Ca. lxj. IXp~ine sayd thus Madame truely to purpose aboue sayd.
The peryllous lyfe of foly loue to that se truely it ought to be eschewed of women that haue ony vnderstandynge in soo moche that it is to them so preiudyable.
But there is grete blame gyuen to them that delyte them to be gay in theyr araye and clothynge and some saye that they do it for to drawe these me~ to theyr loue.
Dere loue shall not excuse them that be curyous and quaynte of theyr aray For without fayle that vyce and not lytell ne no quayntenesse out of estate that perteyneth to euery persone to bere is not without blame by whi che not to excuse the euyll but to the entente that none charge them to gyue greter blame ne other that it affermeth not of suche women yt one seeth fresshe and gaye.
say to the certaynely that it co meth not to all women bycause of loue that they do so but it cometh to many as well men as women by ryght good condycyón and naturall inclynacyon that they delyte theym in fresshenesse and in fayre habytes and ryche in clennesse and in profytable thynges.
And yf it come to them by kynde it were herde to them to eschewe it howe be it that it sholde be the more vertuous.
It is not wryten of the Appostle saynt Barthylme we the whiche was a ryght grete gentyll man that notwithstandynge that our sauyoure cryste Ihesu preched and teched strongly of pouerte lymplenesse in all maner of thynges yet the blessyd apostle all his lyfe ware clothes of sylke frenged aboute with golde and precyous stones and it co meth to hym of kynde to be rychely arayed whiche is comunely a curyous thynge and full of pryde and yet he synned not.
And some wyll say that for that cause our lorde suffred that for his martyr dome he lefte his skynne and was slayne.
And the se thynges that tell the for to showe that no ma~ ought to Iuge another of conscyence for his haby te ne for his araye.
For it perteyneth onely to god to be Iuge of all creatures and vpon that shall tell the some ensamples.
ALso Bocace and Ualere telleth Clau dyne whiche was a noble lady of Rome delyted gretely in clothynges delycate.
And for that yt she was modelycatyfe than the other ladyes of Rome some presumed shrewdely ayenst her ayenst her chastyte to preiudyce of her good name.
So it happened in the. xv. yere of the seconde batayle of Aufryke.
That the ymage of Pyssemonde moder of ye goddes after opynyon had ben borne fro Rome there were assembled all the noble ladyes of Rome to go mete with the ymage whiche was put in a shyp vpon Tybre but maryners myght not aryue at the porte for all theyr strength.
Then Claudyne whiche knewe well yt she was mysbylened of wronge for her fresshnesse she kneled before the ymage and made her prayer all on hyghe in sayenge to the goddesse that as truely as that she knewe that her chastyte was hole and not cor rupte that she wolde gyue her grace that she alone myght drawe the shyp to the hauen.
And then trustynge to her clennesse toke her gyrdell boun de it to the sterne of the shyp and atter drewe the shyp to the ryuayle as lyghtly as thoughe all the maryners of the worlde had ben there.
haue not tolde this ensample for the thynge that wene that ymage that they as foles and myscreauntes call a goddesse yt had myght to lyfte vp the prayer of Claudyne but haue tolde it the for to shewe the that she that was so gaye lefte not for so moche to be chaste and by that she shewed that she had that the trouthe of her chastyte was so courable to her the whiche helped her and not the goddesse.
Howe they lye not vpon some wome~ for so mo che thoughe they delyte them in fayre clothynge araye.
ANd those women that wolde be byloued payne them for cause to be gaye nyce and curyous.
shall proue the yt encheson maketh them not the sooner ne the better to be loued of wyse men of worshyp and more sooner and better ben these vertuous women honest symple loued of them that loue worshyp than the moost Iolyest fayrest.
So one myght answere me thus syth that women drawe these men to theym by theyr vertue and honeste.
It were better that there were fewer good women but reason sholde be nought worth.
For the good and profytable thynges ought not to be lefte to be tolde to encrease for that thoughe the foles abuse them and euery ma~ ought to do his deuoyre as wel doynge thoughe it fortune the contrary.
And yt it is soo that many women ben loued for theyr vertues and honeste.
shall shewe the ensamples fyrst of dyuers sayn tes of paradyse myght tell the that were couey ted of men for theyr honeste.
Lucresse of whom spake here aboue whiche was rauysshed the grete honeste of her was cause that Tarquyne lo ued her more than her beaute.
For as her hous ba~ de was ones at a soupere there as this Tarquyne was whiche rauysshed her after and dyuers other knyghtes with theym they began to speke of theyr wyues and euery ma~ sayd that his was best.
But to knowe ye trouthe to proue whiche theyr wyues was moost worthy to be praysed euery man wente to horse backe wente to theyr houses.
And thoughe yt they founde occupyed in the moost honest offyces the werke were of reputacyon wherof it fortuned yt Lucresse amonge all the other was founde moost honestly occupyed as ryght a wyse a good woma~ clothed in a symple gowne amonge her maydens her wome~ werkyngein wulles spekynge of ver tuous thynges thyder came sayd Tarquyne sone of kynge with her hous bade whiche behol dynge her grete honeste her symple countenau~ce her styll manere was so amerous of her yt it cau hy~ to do the folye that he dyde
Of quene Blaunche moder of saynt Lewes other good women loued for theyr vertues.
THe same wyse was loued for her gre te vnderstandynge wysdome vertue bounte the ryght noble quene Blau~che moder of saynt Lewes of erle of Cha~payne she had passed ye floure of her youthe.
But this no ble erle herynge quene speke to hym wt so wyse wordes when he had begon to warre agaynst sayd sayd saynt Lewes and the good lady spake to hym of it sayenge that he ought not to do so co~ syderynge the welthes that her sone had done to hym the erle behelde her by grete entent meruay lynge hym of the grete goodnesse vertue of her by ye whiche he was so strongely vndertaken wt her loue yt he wyst not what to say nor do ne durst neuer warre ayenst hym after.
For he knewe wel there was so moche welthe in her and of vertue also yt he coude neuer do otherwyse but accorde wt hym and her.
So he suffred fro that houre for the many troubles by lewde desyres that co~strayned hym yet she answered hym by the same.
And then when she doubted not that he sholde neuer make warre to the kynge but wolde be all his and that she was incertayne that herte and body and all yt euer he had was submytted to her commaundement soo she loued hym all his lyfe after.
And he lefte not for a lytell wanhope that he myght come to her loue.
So he made his louely complayntes in dyttyes praysynge gretely his lady.
The whiche goodly dyttyes that he made he put them to a musyeyen to set them in to songe ryght delectably And in his halle at Prouynce and also at Troyes he made wryte them and yet they appere in many places.
And thus myght tell the of many other And Xp~ine answered Madame to your purpose in lyke case haue sene by experyence.
For knowe many vertuous women that by that they haue confessed them to me in complaynynge them to me of the pleasaunce that they toke there they haue ben more requyred syth tyme theyr grete beaute and youthe hath ben past· than they were in theyr grete wherof they sayd.
Alas what wyll ye that say to these men seynge in me ony countenaunce of foly by whiche they haue coloure and cause to thynke that he was of accorde to do so grete foly.
And perceyue nowe open ly by that ye saye that the grete welthe of them hathe ben cause to make them to loue.
And it is well contrary to opyupon of dyuers folke yt say that a good woman that wolde be chaste shall ne uer be that woman that lyst to be coueyted nor re quyred.
Xp~ine asketh ryght wysnes answereth ayenst them that saye that women by nature ben scarse.
Capitulo. lxv. REplye you can no more myne owne lady For my questyons ben well assoyled.
And it semeth me that ye ha ue ynoughe proued false the euyll say enges yt so many men saye vpon women.
And also amonge other vyces of wome~ they saye yt Auaryce is a naturall thynge in them but it appereth not so to me by that that ye saye.
Dere doughter tell the certaynly yt Auaryce is no more naturall in women than in men yf there be lesse god knoweth it.
And that thou mayst se by that that by couetysenesse of dyuers men there is moche more harme done to the worl de than by the lytell couetysenesse of women.
But as haue sayd to the before that fole knoweth better the lytell trespace in his neyghboure than he dothe the grete cryme of hymselfe.
And by that that one sethe often tymes women delyte them in louynge to spynne and carde suche thyngesme~ call couetyse.
But promyse the yt there ben grete foyson of them that yf they had wherof they wolde not be scarse ne couetouse as of that yt sholde be to theyr worshyp.
But poore men holde comunely theyr wynes so strayte yt they must nedes kepe that they haue for they wote well it were no lyght thynge to haue more.
And so there ben some people yt calleth women scarse for yt they haue ma ryed full large wastours of theyr goodes the poore women yt knewe well yt theyr housbandes haue spended lewdely that yt sholde fynde theyr housholde that they theyr chyldren dare not compare chere and maye not holde them to speke to theyr housbandes to cou~sayle them of lesse de spence.
So suche thynges is no coueytyse ne scar senesse but it is a sygne of ryght grete prudence suche debates one may se often tymes in maryages by that yt suche counsayllynge pleaseth not to the men and by yt they gyue blame to the women of yt they ought to prayse them of.
But yt it be true that this vyce of Auaryce be not in them so as some wyll say It appereth to almesse that with ry ght good wyll they do dayly god knoweth it howe many prysoners in the londe of howe many nedy gentylmen others haue ben and ben all dayes lowe in the worlde comforted socoured by women by theyr goodes.
The Ladyes of Rome were not scarse when in the ty me that Cyte was gretely greued with warre by the whiche all comune treasoure of towne was wasted spended on men of armes wherof it was grete sorowe to Romaynes to fynde the way to haue syluer to put forth an armye whiche was of force ryght necessary for them.
But the la dyes by theyr owne fre wyll also the wydowes assembled them brought all theyr Iewelles al that they had without sparynge ony thynge to prynces of Rome freely toke it them of whi che thynge the ladyes were gretely praysed and afterwardes all theyr Iewelles goodes were yelded to them agayne of good ryght.
OF the lyberalyte of women also it is wryten in the dedes of Romaynes of worshypfull ryche woman Buyse or Paulyne whiche was in londe of Puyl le in the tyme yt Hanyball gre ued so moche the Romaynes by fyre and yren yt he despoyled almost all Italy of men of goodes It happened yt of grete dyscomfyture of Canes wherof Hanyball had so noble a vyctorye many Romaynes fledde scaped from the batayle wou~ ded and hurte.
But this worshypfull lady Buyse receyued all them that she myght haue anone to the nombre of. x. thousande and gadered them in to her houses for she was of grete rychesse.
Soo she made them to be heled at her cost and charge socoured them all with her goodes soo moche by the helpe and comforte she dyde to themthey myght tourne agayne to Rome and set vp theyr armes agayne of the whiche thynge she was ryght gretely praysed.
So doubte ye not dere frende that of infynyte women large curtoys and ly berall myght tell the ynoughe.
And also with out sekynge more ferther the hystoryes as well of other largesse of ladyes myght tell the ynoughe Ne was not the lyberalyte grete of the noble lady de la ryuere named Margarete whiche is yet on lyue and was somtyme wyfe of the lorde Burell lorde de la ryuere and fyrste chambrelayne of the wyse kynge Charles.
This lady as she yt was alwaye wyse worshypfull and well manered.
It happened in a tyme amonge others yt she beynge at a grete feest where there was grete foyson of noble ladyes and of knyghtes and of gentylmen in grete apparayle.
Then this noble lady whiche was fayre yonge as she behelde noble cheualry that was there thought that there was no che re amonge others ryght a notable knyght and of grete worshyp in his lyuynge that was called syr Emenyon de Pomyners.
This lady lefte not for so moche yt he was a goodly man to haue remem braunce of hym bycause of his worthynesse and bounte her thought more fayrer araye myght not be in a company than notable men of good fame thoughe that they were olde.
So she asked gretely where this syr Emenyon was he was not at that assemble.
So it was tolde her that he was in pryson in the castell of Parys for fyue hon dred frankes in whiche he was bou~de for a vyage that he dyde in armes as he dyde ofte tymes.

For this thynge was euer in the thought of god the fader preparate and ordeyned in the counsayle of Trynyte Then answered Iustyce with all the women Lady thankynges and praysynges be gyuen to the by the in fynyte worldes.
Nowe lady saue vs and pray for vs to thy sone whiche nothynge the refuseth.

And nowe ought blessyd systers to put in saynt Mary Mag daleyne with them whiche made her company without leuynge her in the tyme of the passyon of her sone ryght nyghe the crosse.

TO make company with vyrgyne quene of heuen pryncesse of Cyte of Ladyes we must lodge wt her the blessyd vyrgynes holy ladyes in shewynge howe god hath proued the kynde of women by that that the same wyse that he gyuen vnto men he hath gyuen vnto wo men for to vnderstande in theyr yonge and tendre age for to be constaunte and stronge in sufferynge horryble martyrdomes for holy lawe the whiche ben crowned in glorye of whome the fayre lyuesben of good ensample to here to euery euery woman aboue all othher wysdome ther fore they shall be superlatyue degre of our Cyte And fyrst as a ryght excellent blessyd Katheryn whiche was doughter of kynge Costes of Alexa~dre.
This blessyd vyrgyn was lefte to be heyre of her fader in the age of. xviij. yeres notably she gouerned her her herytage she was a cryste~ wo ma~ all gyuen to god refusynge all other marya ges.
It happened that in to the cyte of Alexandre was come Emperour Maxencyus the whiche on a day of grete solempnyte of his goddes had made to aray grete appareyle to make solempne sacryfyse.
Katheryne beynge in her palays herde the noyse of beestes yt were arayed to do sacryfyse grete noyse of instrumentes as she had sente to knowe what it was.
And it was reported to her that ye Emperour was in the temple to do sacrefyse anone she wente began to correcte Em peroure of yt erroure by many wyse wordes as she was a grete clerke had lerned scyences began to proue by good reasons of Phylosophye yt there was but one god maker of all thynges yt he ought to be worshypped none other.
when yt Emperour herde this mayden whiche was so no ble of so grete auctoryte thus speke whiche yt was so fayre was all admeruaylled wyste not what to say but entended to beholde her so he sen te al aboute to seke phylosophres in all ye londe of egypte so there came before hym. l. phylosophres whiche helde the~ ryght euyll contente when they knewe the cause wherfore they were brought thy der.
And sayd that lytell wytte had moued them to trauayle frome so farre coutrees for to dyspute with a mayden and to telle shortely when day of theyr dysputac yon was come the blessyd Katheryne ledde theym for the so with argumentes that they were all ouercome and coude not assoyle her questyons for whiche Emperoure was pas synge wrothe with them but all that aduayled no thynge.
For by the grace of god by the holy wor des of the vyrgyne they were all conuerted confessed the name of Ihesu Cryst for the whiche despyte the Emperoure made them all to be brente the holy mayden conforted them in theyr martyrdome and assured them to be receyued in perpetuall glory prayed god that he wolde kepe them in the veray faythe.
And so by her they were put in nombre of the blessyd martyrs.
And suche a myracle god shewed in them the fyre neuer hurte theyr bodyes ne theyr clothes but that they bode al hole after the fyre was done wtout losynge of ony heere of theyr heedes but it semed that all were on lyue The tyraunte Maxencyus whiche gretely coueyted the holy vyrgyne katheryne for her beaute began to flatter her she sholde tourne to his wyll But when he sawe that it aduayled nothynge he tourned hym to his manasynges and then to tour mented and made her to be beten cruelly and after to put her in pryson without vysytynge of ony per sone space of. xij. dayes without mete or drynke trowynge to haue made her dye for hongre.
But the aungelles of our lorde were with her whiche comforted her after the. xij. dayes she was brou ght before the Emperoure and he sawe her more fresshe and hole than she was before and trowed that she had ben vysyted.
So he commaunded the kepers of the pryson to be tourmented but Kathe ryne whiche had pyte on them affermed that she had no comforte saue onely from heuen.
The Em peroure wyst not what harde tourmentes he my ght make to tourment her.
And by the counsayle of his prouoste he lete make wheles full of rasoures whiche tourned one ayenst another what someuer was in the myddes was al cutte of and bytwene these wheles he made put saynt Katheryne all naked whiche alwaye worshypped god with Ioyned handes.
Then the aungelles of god came and defended her whiche brake the wheles with so grete strengthe that all the tourmentoures were slayne with them.
And when the Empe roures wyfe vnderstode these meruaylles god made for saynt Katheryne she was conuerted blamed the Emperoure of that that he dyde and then she wente and vysyted the holy vyrgyne in the pryson and prayed her that she wolde pray to god for her.
For the whiche despyte Emperoure made to tourmente his wyfe and to drawe of her pappes and the vyrgyne sayd to her.
Doubte ye not tourmentes noble quene for this daye thou shalte be receyued in the Ioye without ende.
And then the Emperoure made his wyfe to be heeded and a grete multytude of people that were conuerted.
The Emperoure requyred Katheryn that she wolde be his wyfe and when he sawe that she was refusynge to all his petycyons wente gaue his sentence that she sholde heeded.
And she made her prayer praynge for all them that had re membraunce on her passyon and for theym that called her name in theyr trybulacyons that god myght be theyr helpe socoure.
voyce came fro heuen whiche sayd yt her prayer was herde.
Soo she made an ende of her martyrdome and in stede of blode there ranne mylke out of her body.
And aungelles toke her holy body bare it to ye moun te Synay whiche is. xx. dayes Iourney fro thens And there they buryed her at the whiche tombe god hath done many myracles whiche let passe for shortenesse.
And of the same tombe there renneth oyle whiche heleth many syke men and god anone after punysshed the Emperoure ryght hor rybly.
WE shall not forgete also ye blessyd vyr gyne saynt Margarete of whome Legende is knowne full well howe she was borne in Antyoche of noble kynrede introducte in faythe whe~ she was yonge of her nouryse of whome ryght humbly she wente euery daye to kepe the shepe wherof it happened Olybryus whiche was stewarde with the Emperoure sawe her in goynge by and coueyted her.
So he sente to fetche her for that that she wolde not consente to his wyll and that she tolde hym that she was a crysten wo man he made her to be strongly tourmented beten and prysoned in the whiche pryson for that she felte her tempted she requyred that she myght se hym vysybly that soo moche euyll pourchased her.
And then came an horryble serpente whiche gretely made her aferde and swalowed her.
But she made the sygne of the crosse and anone the ser pente brake and after she sawe at a corner of the pryson a blacke fygure as of a man of Ethyope And then Margarete wente boldely and coniured hym and he couched vnder her feete and she sette her feete vpon his throte and he cryed with an hygh voyce mercy.
The pryson fulfylled with clerenesse Margarete was comforted of the aun gelles and then she was tourmented agayne before the Iuge the whiche when he sawe that all his ammonycyons aduayled hym not made her to be tourmented more than she was before.
But the aungelles of god came and brake all the tour mentes and the vyrgyne lepte awaye from it all hole and there was grete foyson of people co~uerted.
And when the false tyraunte sawe that he ordeyned she was heeded.
But she made her oryson fyrste and prayed vnto almyghty god for all theym that remembred her passyon and all they that prayed vnto her in theyr trybulacyens and for women grete with chylde that almyghty god wolde grauute vnto them theyr petycyon.
And ye aungell of god came tolde her that her prayers were herde and that she sholde go in the name of god to receyue the palme of the vyctory and then she stretched forthe her necke and was heeded the aungelles bare her soule to heuen.
This false Olybryus also made to tourmente the holy vyrgyne named Regyne whiche was ryght yon ge of the age of .xv. yeres for that that she wolde not accorde to hym and she conuerted moche peo ple with her holy prechynge.
Ca. v. THe biessyd saynt Luce whiche was borne in Rome ought not to be forgeten in our letanye ye whiche was rauysshed of ye kynge Aceya of Barbary.
And when he was in his tre he trowed to haue defouled her.
Then she by the vertue of god began so to preche vnto hym yt he meruaylled of her wytte and lefte her sayd yt she was a goddesse helde her in grete worshyp and reuerence in his palays.
And ryght reuerent ly he establysshed her dwellynge for her and her meyny and ordeyned that no man sholde repayre thyder to hurte her or trouble her.
And she without seasynge was in fastynges and in orysons ledde ryght an holy lyfe prayenge for her hoost· yt it myght please god to enlumyne hym with the ly ght of his holy faythe and her hoost asked counsayle of her in all his doynges and he toke it wel what so euer she counsayled hym when he wente to the werre he prayed her that she wolde praye to her god for hym and she blessyd hym and he ca me agayne as ouercomer of his enemyes wherfore he wolde worshyp her as a goddesse wolde haue made to buylde a temple for her but she sayd that he sholde beware therof and that there was not but one god that she was a symple synner and thus she was by the space of .xx. yeres perseuerynge in holy lyfe.
So she had it by reuelacyon of our lorde that she sholde retourne to Rome there she sholde accomplysshe the terme of her lyfe by martyrdome she tolde it to the kynge whi che was ryght full of sorowe for it and answered her and sayd.
Alas yf thou parte frome me myne enemyes wyll assayle me shall lose my good fortune when shall not haue the.
And she sayd to hym thou kynge come with me and leue thyne erthely royalme for thou arte chosen to posses a more noble kyngdome whiche is without ende And he anone lefte all that he had wente with the holy vyrgyne not as a lorde but as a seruau~te And when they were come to rome and she was knowne that she was a crysten woman she was taken brought to her martyrdome.
Of the whiche thynge the kynge Aeeya was ryght sorowful and ranne aboute and wolde haue reuenged her after his power yf the holy vyrgyne had not bydden hym the contrary soo he wepte tenderly and cryed that they were cursed people to do so moche euyll to the holy vyrgyne of god.
And when it came that one sholde smyte of the heede of yt blessyd vyrgyne ye kynge wente to put his heed by hers cryenge am a crysten man offre myne heed to Ihesu Cryst god maker of all thynge whom that holy Luce worshyppeth.
And soo they were bothe heeded togyder and crowned in glory and xij. other with theym that were conuerted by the holy vyrgyne saynt Luce wherof the feest of them is halowed togyder in the .vij. kalenders of Iule Of ye blessyd vyrgyne saynt Martyne.
This blessyd mayde was borne in Rome of ryght noble kynred.
The Emperoure wolde constrayne her to be his wyfe bycau se of her beaute and she answered am a crysten woman offred to god alyue whiche delyteth hym in chaste bodyes and in clene herte and to hym do sacrefyse and commende me.
And for despyte of these wordes the Emperoure made her to be ledde to the temple to constrayne her to worshyp the ydolles and she kneled downe and her eyen towarde heuen lyftynge vp her Ioyned handes made her orysons to god and anone the ydolles fell downe all to torne the temple brake and the prestes of the temple of ydolles were slayne and the deuyll that was in the ydoll cryed confessed that the holy vyrgyne Martyne was the veray seruaunt of god.
The tyraunte Emperoure for to reuenge his goddes made her to be cruelly tourmented in the whiche god appered to her comforted her and she prayed for them yt tourmented her somoche that they were conuerted by her merytes and grete foyson of people also.
Of ye whiche thynge the Emperoure was worse dysposed than before and made her to be tourmented more and more of dyuers tourmentynges and cruel But those that tourmented her thought verely yt they sawe god and his sayntes before her they asked mercy of her and were conuerted.
And soo as she was in oryson prayenge for them a lyght came rounde aboute them and a voyce was herde from heuen that sayd spare you for the loue of my ryght welbyloued Martyne.
And then the prouost cryed to them for that they were conuerted and sayd.
Nay thou arte deceyued by the dyuyll yt dwelleth within the for thou knowest not hym that made the.
And the Emperour wrothe out of measure co~maunded them to be hanged theyr flesshe to be al to torne they receyuynge martyr dome Ioyfully praysed god.
And the Emperour agayne made martyne to be dispoyled al naked her flesshe whyte as lylye yt made them abasshed for her grete beaute when the Emperour whiche coueyted her had longe tyme counsayled her and sawe that she wolde not obaye made her to be cutte al aboute and out of her woundes there came mylke for blode and yelded grete swetnesse yet he woode on her made to stretche her abrode and raced her with hokes and brake all the bo dy so moche that they that tourmented her were al wery and god kepte her that she sholde not dye so soone to the entente that the tourmentoures myght haue cause to be conuerted the whiche began to crye Emperoure we wyll do no more for the aungelles beteth vs with chaynes.
And then there came newe tormentoures to tourment her and anone they were deed and the Emperour co~ fused wyste not what to doo but made her to be stretched to brenne her with brennynge alwaye she gloryfyed our lorde and there came out of her mouthe ryght grete swetnesse when the tyrauntes had tourmented her so moche that they were ashamed they cast her in a derke pryson And Emenyon the cosyn of the Emperoure wen te to loke in to the pryson and he sawe Martyne enuyronned with aungelles set in a trone ryght well arayed and there was grete clerenesse with many dyuers songes ryght melodyous and she helde a table of golde in whiche there was wry ten.
My lorde swete Ihesu cryst so moche by thy werkes praysed in thy blessyd sayntes Emenyon gretely admeruayled of this thynge wente to tell it to the Emperoure whiche answered yt he was deceyued by her enchau~tementes in ye mornynge the tyraunt made her to be taken out of pryson euery body meruaylled of that yt she was all hole thrughe whiche many was conuerted.
At the last he made her to be ledde to the tymple to constray+ne her to do sacrefyse to the false goddes.
Then deuyll began to braye and sayd alas alas am confounded and the holy vyrgyne commaunded hym to come out and that he sholde shewe hym in his owne lewde lykenesse and anone there came a grete thondre with lyghtnynge that came from heuen and brake the ydoll and brente ye pree+stes.
And then the Emperoure was woode with her made her to be stretched abrode raced all flesshe of her body with combes of yron and she alway worshypped god and when he sawe that she dyed not he made her to be put to wylde beestes to be deuoured and a grete lyon that had not eten in thre dayes came to her and bowed hym to her and laye downe by her as it were a lytell dog and lycked her woundes she thanked our lorde in saynge.
Blessyd be thou almyghty god that by thy vertue hast modered the cruelte of wycked be+stes.
The tyraunte wrothe with this thynge com+maunded that the lyon sholde be put agayne in to his caue and ye lyon dressed hym by grete wra+the and made a lepe and slewe Emenyon the Em+peroures cosyn of the whiche thynge he was ryght sorowfull and commaunded her to be cast in to the fyre and she beynge within with a Ioyful chere god sente a grete wynde that put away the fyre aboute her brente them that tourme~ted her The Emperoure commaunded that the heere of her heed sholde be cutte whiche was ryght fayre and longe sayenge that the enchauntementes was in her heeres.
Thou takest awaye the heeres whiche is an ornamente of woman as the apostle sayth god shall put the out of thy reygne and poursue and thou shalte byde the dethe with grete sorowe and payne.
Then he made her to be enclosed in a temple where his goddes were and nayled the dore sealed it with his owne sygnete.
And whe~ thre dayes were past he came agayne and founde his goddes all ouerthrowne and the holy vyrgyne playenge with aungelles hole and sounde.
The Emperoure asked her what she had done wt his goddes and she sayd vertue of Ihesu cryste hathe ouerthrowne them and confounded them.
And then he commaunded that one sholde cutte her throte the~ there was herde a voyce that sayd Martyne vyrgyne for that that thou hast fought for my name thou shalte entre in to my kyngdome amonge my sayntes.
And thus ended ye blessyd Martyne and then came the bysshoppe of Rome with all his clargye buryed body honourably in chyrche.
And ye same day Emperoure Alexa~ der was smyten with suche a sorowe yt he ete his owne flesshe gnewe hymselfe to the dethe.
ANother vyrgyne Saynt Luce there was in the Cyte of Syracuse and so as she prayed at sepulture of saynt Agace for her moder whiche was sy ke she sawe saynt Agace in a vysyon in the myddes of aungelles arayed in precyous stones whiche sayd to her.
Luce my syster deuoute vyrgyne wherfore requyrest thou of me yt thou mayst gyue to thy moder thyselfe tell the for cer tayne so as cyte of Cathonyas is lyfted vp by me so shall the cyte of Syracuse be worshypped by
For thou hast arayed to Ihesu cryst delectable Iewelles in thy clennesse.
Luce rose vp her moder was hole and she gaue al that she had for goddes sake and after ended her lyfe by martyrdome and amonge other martyrdomes that she had Iuge manaced her to make her to be ledde to place where yt lewde women vsed theyr lyfe. there she sholde be defouled in the despyte of her spouse she answered.
The soule shal neuer be de fouled wtout consente of mynde.
For yf thou ma ke me to be corrupted by force my chastyte my vyctory shall be doubled therby so as they wolde lede her to place aboue sayd she was so heuy yt for no horse nor other bestes yt sholde drawe her thyder myght not be remoued they put cordes on her fete to drawe her forthe but she was so sta ble as it had ben an hylle.
And at her passynge she prophesyed that that was to come to the Emperoure.
Also the gloryous vyrgyne saynt Benet borne in rome is worthy of grete reuerence.
She had with her. xij. vyrgynes conuerted by her predycacyon.
So she departed her com pany and preched and conuerted moche people wt out hauynge ony drede for god was with them and by the wyll of god they were departed in son dre and stretched them in dyuers countrees to yt entente that euery of theym myght profyte and as this holy vyrgyne had conuerted dyuers cou~ tres and encreased the faythe of our lorde she ended her lyfe by the palme of martyrdome and on same wyse dyde her holy felawes.
And saynt fauste was not of lesse perfeccyon of the age of. xiiij. yeres whiche for that that she wolde not do sacrefyse to the ydolles the Emperoure Maxymy on made her to be sawed with a sawe of yron But as the seased not sawynge fro the houre of tyerce anone to the houre of noone and they myght not entame her and they sayd to her by what vertue hast thou holden vs by thyne en chauntementes soo longe here without doynge ony thynge and the holy vyrgyne Fauste began to preche to them of Ihesu Cryst and of his lawe and so conuerted them.
The Emperoure had gre te indyngnacyon hereof and made her to be tour mented with dyuers tourmentes and amonge others he made to nayle her heed with a thousan de nayles lyke to the helme of a knyght and she prayed for them that dyde her persecucyon.
And the prouost was conuerted by that that he sawe heuens open god syttynge with his aungelles and when saynt Fauste was in cawdron wa ter boylynge sayd prouost began to crye.
Thou holy seruaunt of god ne go thou not without me and lepte in to the cawdron and when the other twayne that he had conuerted sawe they lepte in to the cawdron also of whiche the water boyled ryght feruently and the holy Fauste touched theym·and they felte no maner of euyll.
And she sayd am in the myddes as it were a byne beryn ge fruyte as our lorde sayth where there ben two or thre assembled in my name am in myddes of them.
And then there was herde a voyce from heuen that sayd.
Come to me my blessyd vyrgyne the fader hath asked for you and they that herde this thynge yelded vp the ghost ryght Ioyously.
THe holy vyrgyne Iustyne borne in yonge and of souerayne beaute ouercame the deuyll whiche was called vp by callynge of a gromancere that he sholde do so mo che that she sholde consente to the wyll of a man that was gretely taken with her loue and lefte her not in peas.
But for that that by prayers nor by promyses he coude doo nothynge he trowed that the sholde helpe hym but it aduayled hym not for the gloryous Iustyne chased the ene my dyuers tymes whiche that put hym in dyuers fourmes to tempte her.
But he was ouercome of her and wente his waye confused.
And at the last she ended her lyfe by martyrdome and conuerted the sayd nygromancere that was called Cypryen and had ben a man of ryght a shrewde lyfe but by her he was put in a good lyfe and dyuers others were conuerted by sygnes yt god shewed in her.
Also blessyd vyrgyne Eulalye borne in Spay ne of the age of. xij. yeres stale awaye from her fa der and moder that helde her in close for that that she neuer stynted to speke of our lorde Ihesu cryst so she fledde by nyght and wente and cast downe the ydolles of the temples to the erthe and cryed to the Iuges that dyde so moche persecucyon to the martyres that they were deceyued and that in that faythe she wolde dye so she was put in nombre of the knyghtes of Ihesu cryste and had many grete tourmentes there was moche peo ple conuerted by myracles yt god shewed to her Also of another holy vyrgyne that was called Matre whiche was ryght sore tourmented for fayth of Ihesu Cryste and amonge her tourmen tes she had her pappes raced frome her body and after so as she was in the pryson god sente vnto her his aungell whiche that establysshed her helthe wherof the prouost was gretely abasshed.
But he lefte not for that but that he made her to be gretely tourmented of dyuers paynes and at the laste she yelded vp the spyryte to god and her holy body lyeth nyght the Cyte of Raynes.
Also the blessyd vyrgyne saynt Faythe suffred martyrdome in her youthe and had many tourmentes.
And our lorde crowned her and sente her a crowne of precyous stones by an aungell and god shewed for her many meruaylles by the whi che many people were conuerted.
Also the holy and blessyd vyrgyne Marcyenne when one dyde worshyp to a false ymage of an ydoll she toke the ydoll and threwe hym to the grounde and brake hym for the whiche cause she was so moche beten that they lefte her for deed and prysoned in a place·in the whiche place a false mynystre trowed to haue rauysshed her by nyght.
But by grace deuy ne there came a grete walle bytwene her and hy~ that he myght not goo frome thens the whiche was sene on the morowe of all the people by the whiche there was moche people conuerted.
But alwaye she preched of the name of Ihesu Cryste and at the laste she prayed to god that he wolde take her vnto hym.
And thus she ended her lyfe in her grete tourmente.
Also the blessyd vyrgyne Saynt Eufenye also suffred moche for name of god she was of good kynred of noble shap of body.
The prouost Pry sens cosaylled her that she sholde worshyp the ydolles and forsake Ihesu cryste she by ryght grete argumentes answered hym so moche that he coude not assoyle her questyons wherof he had so grete wrathe that he was ouercome of a woman and made her to be tourmented with ryght greuous and harde tourmentes.
But thoughe body of her were sore brused her wytte alway en creased and yelded good wordes full of the holy ghost and when she was tourmented the aungel of god defended her and brake the tourment and tourmented the tourmentoures and she with a gladde vysage wente out all hole.
The false prouost made to hete a fournoys of whiche flame stretched out by. xl. cubytes of hyght and made her to be cast in it and she sange within it praysyn ge god ryght melodyously soo hyghe all people praysed her when ye fyre was all consumed she came out saufe hole.
The Iuge wrother tha~ he was made to brynge brennynge pynsons to drawe out her membres but those that sholde haue done it were so aferde that none durst touche her and all the tourmentes were all to broken.
So ye false tyraunte made to brynge foure lyons and other.
ij. wylde beestes but they worshypped her and blessyd vyrgyne desyrous to go to her god prayed hym that he wolde take her to hym and then she ended without touchynge of ony of the wylde beestes.
THe constaunce of the martyrdome of the blessyd Theodosyne cometh to our purpose well to be reme~bred This vyrgyne was ryght noble of grete beaute of ye age of. xviij. yeres she by meruayllous wytte dysputed with the Iuge whiche manaced her to tourment her yi she forsoke not Ihesu Cryst and as she answered by godly wordes he made her to be taken by ye heere and beten ryght sore and she sayd to hym.
Cer tes he is a caytyfe that wolde lordeshyp another and can not gouerne hymselfe.
Alas to hym that hath grete charge to be fulfylled with metes and drynkes and hath no thought of the hongre euyl for hym that wolde be warmed and wyll not clo the ne warme those that ben euyll clothed wo be to hym that wolde haue rest trauaylleth others euyll be it to hym that saythe all thynges ben his and he hathe receyued them of god wo be to hym that wolde that one sholde do well and he dothe all euyll.
Suche worthy wordes sayd alwaye holy vyrgyne in her tourmente.
But for that she had sorowe in her herte of the shame of that that her shamfast membres appered openly god sente her a whyte cloude that couered her al.
And Urban the Iuge manaced her more and more to whome she sayd.
Thou she west none of my meeses of my dyner that is ordeyned for me.
And the tyraunt manaced her that he wolde corrupte her vyrgynyte to whom she answered.
Thou mana cest in vayne to be corrupcyon in me for god enha byteth in ye clene hertes.
The prouost more wode than he was made her to be cast in the see an heuy stone aboute her necke.
And she borne vp with aungelles brought agayne to the loude syngyn ge bare the stone bytwene her handes whiche wayed moche more than herselfe.
The tyraunte made to lette go vpon her. ij. Leoperdes but they lepte aboute her makynge her grete chere.
At the last the tyraunt yt knewe not howe to do made to smyte of her heed the soule departed fro her body vysybly in ye shappe of a whyte downe shynyn ge bryght the same nyght she appered to her fa der moder more clerer than the sone crowned with precyous stoues accompanyed with many vyrgynes holdynge a crosse of golde in her hande sayd to them.
Se here what is the Ioy that ye wolde haue put awaye from me and by yt they were conuerted.
Also in ye tyme of Maxymyan the Emperoure floured in vertues ye blessyd vyrgyne saynt Barbara of noble lygnage soueray nely sayre her fader for bycause of her beaute had shytte her in a toure and she had inspyracyon of ye crysten faythe for that yt she myght not be baptysed of none other she herselfe toke water baptysed her in the name of the fader sone the holy ghost.
Her fader wolde haue maryed her ryght hyghly and she refused all maryages and at the laste she tolde that she was crystened and hadde vowed her vyrgynyte vnto god the fader wolde haue slayne her for that cause and she fledde and escaped and as her fader poursued her to put her to the dethe at the laste he founde her by ye techyn ge of a shepeherde whiche serched anone bothe hym and his beestes and the fader ledde her to prouost the whiche for that that she dysobeyed al his commaundementes made her to be martyred with many a greuous tourmente and hanged her by the feete and she sayd to hym caytyfe ne seest thou not that the tourmentes dothe me no harme and he ryght wrothe made her pappes to be drawne frome her body and in that estate made her to be ledde thrughe the cyte.
But for that that she hadde shame that her vyrgynall body was sene all naked our lorde sente her his aungell and heled all her woundes and couered her body with a whyte clothe.
And when she had ben ledde forth ynou ghe one ledde her agayne before the prouost whiche was wode when he sawe her all hole and her face shynynge bryght soo he made her agayne to be tourmented soo moche that he commaunded when he coude thynke of no mo tourmentes that her heed sholde be smyten of.
And she made her orysons and prayed god that he myght be in the helpe of all them that requyred her in remembrau~ ce and recorded her passyon.
And when she hadde all ended her oryson and prayer there was a voy ce herde from heuen whiche sayd vnto her in this wyse.
Come vnto me my ryght dere welbyloued doughter to rest the in the kyngdome of my fader and receyue thy crowne.
And that that thou hast requyred shall be graunted to the so as she was gone vp vpon hylle where she sholde be heeded Her cruell fader smote of her heed hymselfe.
And as he came downe the hylle fyre of heuen brent hym al to poudre.
Also blessyd vyrgyne saynt Dorothe the same wyse suffred dyuers martyrdo mes in Capadoce.
And for that she wolde not take no ma~ to housbande and spake so moche of her spouse Ihesu Cryst.
The mayster of the scoles whiche was named Theophylus sayd to her in mockery when one ledde her to be heeded that at the leest when she sholde be with her spouse that she wolde sende to hym of the roses and apples of the gardyne of her housbande and she sayd that she wolde wherof it happened that as soone as she had made an ende of her martyrdome ryght a fayre yonge chylde as of age of .iiij. yeres come to Theophylus and brought with hym a lytell panyer full of fayre roses and apples meruayllously well smellynge and fayre sayd yt the vyrgyne Dorothe sente them to hym.
Then was he gretely admeruaylled for it was wryten in the moneth of February so he was conuerted after was martyred for the name of Ihesu cryst So of all other sayntes vyrgynes that ben in heuen by constaunce of martyrdome yf wolde tell the hystory sholde be ryght longe so as saynt Cecyle saynt Agnes saynt Agace and infynyte others and yf thou wylte haue mo go and behol de in the hystoryal myroure and there thou shalte fynde ynoughe.
And shall tell the yet of Saynt Crystyne for that that she is thy godmoder and is a vyrgyne of grete dygnyte shall tell the lyfe of her more playne whiche is deuoute and fayre.
Capitulo. x. THe blessid vyrgyne saynt Xp~ine was of the cyte of Syre doughter of Urban mayster of the cheualrye this la dy for her beaute was kepte in close by commaundement of her fader in a toure and she had with her seuen maydens.
And there her fader lete make a fayre oratory of ydolles nyghe to the chambre of Xp~yne to the entente that she sholde worshyp them.
But she that was so yonge as of the age of .xij. yeres was enspyred of the fayth of Ihesu cryst and made no for ce of the ydolles wherof maydens meruaylled and often tymes they called on her to do oblacyon.
And when she had taken ensence so as to make sacrefyse to the ydolles she kneled towarde Eest at a wyndowe and loked towarde heuen encensed the inmortall god.
And the moost parte of the nyght she was at that wyndowe beholdyn ge the sterres and she waylynge besought god ry ght deuoutely and prayed hym that he wolde be her helpe agaynst all her aduersaryes.
The maydens whiche perceyued well that her herte was all in Ihesu cryste kneled before her often tymes with Ioyned handes prayenge yt she sholde not put her entente in a straunge god but yt she wolde worshyp the goddes of her fader and moder yf that she were knowne al they sholde be destroy ed. Saynt Xp~ine answered that they were decey ued by the deuyll whiche styred them to worshyp so many goddes and that there was but one.
At the last as her fader knewe yt his doughter wolde not worshyp the ydolles he was ryght sorowfull and reproued her.
And she sayd that with a good wyll she wolde offre to god of heuen he trowed that she mente Iupyter and was ryght glad and wolde haue kyssed her but she sayd foule not my mouthe.
For wyll offre myne offrynge clene to god of heuen and of erthe and of yt her fa der was contente.
And she wente in to her cham bre shytte fast the dore set her on her knees offred her holy oryson to god in wepynge and holy aungell of our lorde came downe comforted her brought her whyte brede mete wherof she ete for in .iij. dayes she had no maner of mete nor drynke.
After that saynt Xp~ine sawe at wyn dowes many poore crysten men beggynge at the fote of her toure and she hadde nothynge to gyue them and she wente to seke the Idolles of her fader whiche were of golde and syluer and she bra ke them all and gaue the peces to the poore men.
And when her fader knewe that thynge he bete her ryght cruelly and she tolde hym playnly that he was deceyued to worshyp suche false ymages and that there was but one god in Trynyte the whiche she confessed and other god wolde she not worshyp to dye therfore wherfore he was woode with her and made her to be bounde with chaynes and ledde her betynge her in dyuers places and after put her in pryson and he sayd yt he wolde be Iuge hymselfe of that cause.
Soo he made her to be brought before hym on the morowe and manaced her with all tourmentes yf she wolde not worshyp the ydolles and after that that he sa we well that she wolde not tourne her entente for prayer ne for manaces made her to be stryped all naked bothe armes and legges and beten so moche that .xij. men were wery of it and she asked her fader alwaye yf he aduysed her not he sayd to her.
Doughter naturall pyte constrayneth sore my courage to tourmente the so whiche arte my flesshe.
But the reuerence and the faythe that haue to my goddes constrayneth me to do it for that thou dyspysest theym.
Tyraunt whiche ought not to calle fader but enemye of myne holynesse tourmente the flesshe hardely that thou haste engendred and spare it not.
For as for that thou mayst wel doo at thy pleasure but as for the spyryte the whiche was made of my fader the whiche is in heuen thou hast no power in no wyse to touche it by no temptacyon for Ihesu cryst my sauyoure ke peth hym.
The cruell fader more woode then he was made to brynge a whele that he had let make and made this holy swete yonge mayden to be bounde to it and to put fyre vnder and after made to cast boylynge oyle grete plentye vpo~ her body and the whele tourned vpon her and all to brake her but god the souerayne fader had pyte on his seruaunt sente his aungell whiche brake whele all to peces and slewe the tourmentoures staunched the fyre and delyuered the vyrgyne ho le and sounde and slewe more than a thousande persones that behelde her without pyte and the aungelles of god came aboute her and comforted her.
And her fader asked her tell me who hath taught the all the cursednesse.
And she answered Tyraunt without pyte haue not tolde the well that my fader Ihesu cryste hathe taught me this pacyence and all the ryght way in the fayth of god alyue.
And shall ouercome in vertue of god all the assaultes of the deuyll.
And he ouercome confused made to cast her in ryght an horryble a derke pryson.
And so as she was there thynkyn ge on the grete mysteryes of our lorde there came to her. iij. aungelles with a grete lyght and brought her mete and comforted her and she yelded thankynges to god.
Urban wyst not what to do with her lefte not to thynke before what tourmentes he myght do to her at the last as all anoy ed with her for to be delyuered of her made to put a grete stone aboute her necke and throwe her in to the see.
But anone as they threwe her in to the see the aungelles receyued her and she wente vp on the water with the aungelles and then Xp~ine prayed our lorde Ihesu cryst lyftynge vp her eyen to heuen that it myght please hym yt she myght re ceyue ye holy sacrament of baptyme in yt same water whiche she had desyred so moche to haue.
And then our lorde Ihesu cryst dessended in propre per sone with a grete multytude of aungelles bap tysed her and made her after his name Xp~ine and crowned her and shynynge sterre vpon her heed and sette her on the londe.
And that same nyght Urban was tourmented with deuyll and dyed myscheuously.
And in mornynge after she was founde prayenge in her faders halle in a corner.
And thus this blessyd Xp~ine whiche god wolde receyue by matyrdome whiche she desyred ryght moche was ledde agayne by the tourmentoures in to the pryson.
And newe Iuge named zyon whiche knewe well what was done to her made her to come before hym coueyted her for her beaute but when he sawe that all his fayre wordes aduayled hym not he made her to be tourmented agayne and made to a grete cawdron full of oyle and pytche and a grete fyre vndernethe it foure men tourmented her in the cawdron with grete hokes of yron and the holy vyrgyne songe to god ryght melodyously and mocked the tourmentoures manaced them with the paynes of helle.
And when the cruell Iuge sawe yt nothynge aduayled hym he made to hange her in the place before all people by the heere of her heed whiche was longe and shynynge lyke golde.
And the wo men came rennynge aboute her whiche wepte for pyte to se so yonge a mayden tourmented cryed to the tyraunt sayenge.
Thou vntrewe and cruel man howe myght the herte of a man haue suche cruelte agaynst a mayden so fayre and so tendre thou arte worse than ony wylde beest all wolde haue ronne vpon hym.
Xp~ine frende thou shalte suffre no more tourmente but come with me and let vs worshyp souerayne god that hath susteyned the so moche he thought of Iupyter whiche they helde for theyr souerayne god but she thought all otherwyse.
Then she sayd to hym thou hast ryght well sayd and graunt the.
And then he made her to be vn hanged and ledde her to the temple and grete, foy son of people folowed them whe~ he had brought her before the ydolles trowynge that she wolde haue worshypped them she kneled downe behol dynge towarde heuen made her oryson to god and then she rose vp and tourned her towarde ye ydoll and sayd saye to the thou wycked spyryte whiche arte in this ydoll in name of Ihesu cryst yt thou come out anone wycked spyryte lepte out made a grete a ferefull noyse by whiche all were so ferde that they fell downe to the erthe And the Iuge when he was releued sayd.
Xp~ine thou haste moued our god almyghty but for that that he hath pyte on he is come out that he myght se his creature.
And she was wrothe with yt worde reproued hym strongly that he was soo blynde that he knewe not goddes vertue.
So she prayed god that the ydoll sholde falledowne al to poudre whiche thynge was done by the wor des and sygnes of ye holy mayde there were conuerted what of men women mo than. iij. thousande.
If kynge knewe that that is done agaynst our god by the shewynge of this Xp~ine he wolde destroye me myscheuously and then the Iuge full of angu he waxed woode and dyed.
The thyrde Iu ge came after named Iulyan and made to take Xp~ine and made his auaunt that he wolde make her to worshyp the ydolles.
But for al his myght that he coude do he myght not make her remeue out of the place where she was so he lete make a grete fyre aboute her she bode in yt fyre. iij. dayes and. iij. nyghtes there were herde many dyuers swete melodyes the tourmentoures were aferde by meruayllous sygnes yt they sawe the whiche thynges reported to Iulyan he wende to haue waxen wode whe~ fyre was co~sumed she came out al hole.
The Iuge made serpentes to be brought forth made to cast vpo~ her. ii. aspes &. ij grete colubres whiche bote venymed meruayllously but these serpentes fell downe at her fete ye the hedes enclyned towarde her without doynge her ony herme.
ij. horrybie serpentes let lowce vpon her and they hanged them at her pappes lycked her.
yelde the thankynges my lorde god Ihesu cryst whiche hast ma de me so worshypfully to be enhaunced by the holy vertues that these horryble serpentes knoweth thy dygnyte in me.
And this obstynate Iulyan se ynge these meruaylles cryed to hym that was ke per of the serpentes.
Arte not thou enchaunted of Xp~ine also by the whiche thou haste no power to moue the serpentes agaynst her.
Then he whiche doubted the Iuge trowed to haue moued the serpentes ayenst her and they ranne vpon hym and slewe hym.
And so moche euery body doubted ye serpentes that none durste come nyghe Xp~ine she commaunded them by the vertue of god that they sholde go agayne into theyr owne place wtout doynge ony harme to ony creature so they dyde.
Then she raysed agayne ye deed man to his lyfe whiche anone cast hym at her feete and was conuerted.
And the Iuge blynded with ye deuyll so as he perceyued not the meruayllous sygnes sayd vnto Xp~ine.
Thou hast ynoughe shewed thy wytche craftes and she sayd to hym.
Thou man out of wytte yf thyne eyen wolde se vertues of god thou sholdest byleue them.
And then he beyn ge passynge wrothe made to drawe her pappes out of her body and anone there came out mylke in stede of blode.
And for that yt she wtout seasynge named the name of our lorde Ihesus he made to cutte of her tonge but she spake better and clerer after then she dyde before and blessyd god in tha~kynge hym of his grete benefeytes that he dyde to her.
And began to make her oryson vnto god yt it myght please hym to perfourme the crowne of her martyrdome and to receyue her to hym.
And then there was herde a voyce frome heuen sayen ge Xp~ine pure and clene the heuens ben open for the and the reygne without ende redy and all the company of sayntes blesseth god for the for thou hast fro thy youthe susteyned the name of cryste then she praysed gloryfyed god the eyen to warde heuen.
Come Xp~ine my ryght welbyloued and cho sen doughter and receyue the palme and perdurable crowne and ye rewarde of thy passyonable lyfe in the confessyon of my name.
And ye false Iu lyan that herde this voyce blamed the tourmentoures that they had not cutte the tonge of Xp~ine more nerer so they cutte it so nyghe that she shol de not speke so moche as she dyde of our lorde Ie su cryst for they toke an yron hoke and pulled out the tonge and cutte it anone to ye throte.
And she toke the culpen of the tonge and threwe it to the vysage of the tyraunt and smote out his eye and sayd to hym as holely as euer she spake before.
Thou cursed tyraunt what auayleth the to cutte of my tonge to ye entente yt it sholde not worshyp god when my spyryte shal alway worshyp hym thy spyryte shall dwell alway in cursednesse.
And for yt thou knowest not my worde it is good reason yt my tonge hathe made the blynde.
Then she whiche yt sawe Ihesu cryste syttynge in the ryght syde of his fader ended her martyrdome by two arowes that were shotte at her one in the syde yt other towarde ye herte.
And a cosyne of hers whiche was conuerted by her buryed her body wro te her gloryous legende.
blessyd Xp~ine and holy mayden chosen of god praye the by the holynesse wherof god hath made the soo worthy to praye for me a synner named of thy name haue pyte on me blessyd godmoder whiche haste reioyced me to haue cause to put thyne holy legende in my wrytynges the whiche at the reuerence harecorded a longe that it myght be agreable to the and to all women cause of good ensample.
Of dyuers sayntes whiche sawe theyr chyldren martyred before them.
Ca. xj. what thynge in worlde is more ten dre to a moderly herte than to se her chylde to suffre payne.
But for that yt se faythe is yet the grettest thynge as it appered to many worshypfull women whiche for the loue of Ihesu cryste offred theyr owne chyldren to tourment.
As this blessyd Felyx whiche sawe her. viij. chyldren whiche were ryght fayre yonglynges martyred before her and comforted and counsayled them of pacyence by moderly wordes to be stable in the faythe.
And for the loue of god she had forgoten all womanly courage as to the body.
And after that when she had offred them all in sacrefyse to god she wolde be sacrefyed herselfe vnto god by martyrdome.
Also the blessyd Iulytte in the same wyse whiche had a sonne named Cyrycus she nourysshed hym not onely with bodely fode but also with spy rytuall.
For without seasynge she enfourmed hy~ in the faythe in suche wyse that he beynge ryght lytell and yonge myght neuer be ouercome with tourmente ne by fayre wordes that he sholde for sake the name of Ihesu cryste but when he was tourmented he sayd with his lytell clere voyce.
thanke the our lorde Ihesu cryste and he spake so openly as it hadde ben a man of .xl. yeres of age and his good moder comforted hym the whiche was also ryght cruelly tourmented and she without sea synge praysed our lorde and comforted other mar tyres and spake of the heuenly Ioye that they dy de abyde and that they sholde haue noo drede.
Also what shall we nowe saye of the meruayllous constaunce and strengthe yt the blessyd Blan dyne had she sawe tourmented and martyred be fore her her doughter whiche was of ye age of .xv. yeres whom she comforted Ioyously after as a woman sholde go to her spouse she wente to put her in tourmente was soo moche tourmented by multytude of martyrdomes that the tourmen toures were wery of her put her on agrydyren and rosted her was alwaye prycked with pynnes of yron and she alwaye gloryfyed our lorde god so she co~tynued anone to dethe.
what sholde saye to the for to fulfyll our cyte of suche meyny.
Come on Saynt Ursula with all thy. xj. thousande vyrgynes and blessyd martyres for name of Ihesu cryst all theyr heedes smyten of so as they were sente to be maryed they aryued in a londe of myscreauntes whiche wolde constrayne them to forsake the faythe of god and they cho se rather to dye than to forsake the name of theyr sauyoure Ihesu cryst.
OF vyrgynes martyred one myght tell a grete nombre and the same wyse of others that lyued in relygyon and in many other holy guyses and shall tell the of twayne of whom the hysto ry is ryght fayre.
seculer man had one onely doughter lytell and yonge named Maryne so he put her in the warde of a cosyne of his owne and entred in relygyon and ledde ryght an holy lyfe.
And not for that nature drewe hym to thynke on his doughter wherof his payne made hym to be heuy so he was ryght pensyfe and the abbot demaunded hym the cause of his heuynes so moche tyll he tolde hym that all his thought was vpon a doughter of his whiche he had lefte in the worl de whiche he myght not forgete.
The abbot bad hy~ yt he sholde go to fetche her and she myght be put in to relygyon with hym.
So was this mayde with her fader clothed as a lytell monke and coude well kepe her close and she was of ryght good dyscyplyne.
And when she came to the age of. xviij. yeres alwaye perseuerynge frome good to better fader whiche had taught her this holy lyfe passed out of this worlde she abode alone in her faders celle in holy lyuynge so that the abbot and all other praysed her holy conuersacyon and wyst none other but she was a man.
This abbay was but. iij. myles frome a market towne So it fortuned that the monkes must of necessyte go other whyles vnto the foresayd market for to bye theyr necessaryes wherof it happened dyuers tymes that they were nyghted in theyr comynge home warde in the wynter season after that they hadde done theyr busynes so that they must nedes lye in the towne.
And Maryne whiche was named frere Maryne dyuers tymes abo de at his course in the foresayd towne in a certayne hostery where he lodged communely when he came to the towne.
So it happe in that tyme that the doughter of hoste was with chylde.
And as she was constrayned by her fader moder to tell whos it was she put it vpon Maryne wher of the fader and moder came and complayned to the abbot whiche made hym to be sente for was ryght sorowfull of this thynge.
And the holy may den had leuer take the blame vpon her than to ex cuse her.
And she kneled wepynge and fader pray for me haue synned and shall do penaun ce.
And then the abbot beynge ryght wrothe made hym to be beten and tourmented and put hym out of the monastery and defendynge hym the en trynge agayne.
And he set hym on the before abbay lay there in penaunce asked of his bretherne one of brede ones a day ghter of hosteler was delyuered of a sone and moder of her brought this chylde to Maryne before abbay and there lefte it.
And the holy mayden receyued hym and with the morselles of brede men goynge in out gaue hym nourysshed this chylde as thoughe it had ben his owne and on a tyme after that bretherne moued with pyte prayed the abbot that he wolde receyne agayne frere Maryne to mercy and with grete payne they co~strayned hym at theyr prayer.
And she had ben then. v. yeres in that penaunce before the gate of the monastery.
And when he was entred in the abbaye the abbot commaunded hym to do all foule offyces of within and that he sholde bryn in water to wasshe al theyr necessaryes and that he sholde serue all the people of the place.
And the holy vyrgyne dyde it humbly with a good wyll And within a whyle after she passed to our lorde.
And when the bretherne had tolde this to the abbot he sayd to them.
Se ye that his was su che that he deserued no pardon.
Neuerthelesse wass he hym and bury hym ferre from the abbay And so as they dyde of his clothes suche as he wa re they sawe that it was a woman then they began to crye and were passynge sory for the grete euyll and greuaunce that was done to soo holy a creature without cause of the whiche conuersacyon they had grete meruayle.
This thynge tolde to the abbot he was astonyed gretely and anone he fell downe at the feere of the holy body in grete wepynge betynge his brest for his blame and cry enge mercy and requyrynge pardon and ordeyned her sepulture in a chapell within the monaste ry. Thyder came al the monkes amonge the whi che there was one that hadde but one eye whiche kneced downe and kyssed the holy body by grete deuocyon and anone his syght was restored to hym the same daye.
And the woman that bare the chylde became out of her wyste and cryed on her synne and then she was brought vnto the ho ly body and there she recouered helthe.
And syth almyghty god dyde many myracles for her in the place.
THere was a alexa~dre named Eufrasyne whiche god had gyuen to her fader Paffousyen a ma~ of gre te rychesse by the prayers of an holy abbot of a couent of mo~kes yt was nyghe hym when this doughter was waxen mo che ye fader wolde haue maryed her but she yt was gyuen in purpose to kepe her vyrgynyte fled clothed in ye guyse of a man requyred abbot yt she myght be receyued in to sayd abbaye and made hym to byleue that she was a yonge man of the Emperoures courte whiche had deuocyon to be rendred in to that relygyon.
The abbot whiche sa we his grete deuocyon receyued hym with good wyll.
And when the fader myght not fynde his doughter he had meruayllous sorowe.
So he ca me to the abbot to tell his grete sorowe to fynde some comforte and prayed hym and his couente to praye to god that he myght haue some tydynges of her.
The abbot comforted hym and sayd yt he myght not byleue that a chylde gyuen of god by prayer sholde be perysshed.
Longe the abbot the couent prayed to god for this thynge.
And as this good ma~ myght here no tydynges came eue ry day to the abbot to haue some comforte in his trybulacyon abbot sayd to hym on a day truely wene not that thy doughter is euyl gone for yf it were so deme that god wolde haue shewed it vuto vs or this tyme.
But and yf thou wylte speke to a chylde of deuocyon and prayer the whiche we haue here within whiche came hyder frome Emperours courte and god hathe gyuen hym so moche of grace that euery persone that speketh wt hym fyndeth hym ryght well comforted.
Paffou syen prayed hym that for goddes loue he myght speke with hym.
And the abbot made the fader to be brought to the doughter whiche he knewe not but the doughter knewe well fader so she was anone full of teeres and tourned her a parte so as thoughe she wolde ende some maner of oryson the beaute and the fresshnesse of her vysage was gretely empayred by grete abstynence yt she dyde.
After she spake to her fader comforted hym made hym certayne that he sholde se his doughter or he dyed and that he sholde not doubte but that she was in the seruyce of god where euer she were and that yet he sholde haue grete Ioy of her The fader trowed that he knewe that by dyuyne vertue and departed thens ryght well comforted and sayd to the abbot that euer syth his doughter departed he had not founde to his courage so mo the of comforte and am sayd he fulfylled with the grace of god syth that shall haue tydynges of my doughter and with that recommendynge hym to the abbot to the prayers of bretherne he departed.
But he myght not holde hym but yt he must often tymes come agayne to vysyte ye ho ly brother and he dyde nothynge but by his coun sayle.
And thus it endured by so longe tyme that this doughter whiche named herselfe Synaroch had complete the space of. xxxviij. yere within her celle.
And than it pleased god to call her to hym sykenes toke her.
The good ma~ of yt ryght sorow full came thyder and whan he sawe that Synaroche sholde dye he began to crye.
Alas where be those swete wordes those promyses that hast made to me that sholde se my doughter.
Syna roche passed to god and the fader was not there whe~ he passed.
He helde a wrytynge in honde whi che no man myght take out ye abbot and all ye couent came to assaye but they dyde nothynge vpon this fader came thyder with grete cryenge and grete wepynge for his good frende whiche he founde dede on whome was all his comforte. and as sone as he approched the corpes to kysse it before all he opened the hande and toke to hym writynge and he toke it and redde within that it was his doughter and that none sholde touche her body to bury it but onely he this thynge was grete meruayle to hym to the abbot and to all ye couent whiche gretely praysed her holy stablenes in vertue.
And to the fader doubled the wepynge in consolacyon of his lyfe.
So he solde all yt euer he had and rendred hym in to the same abbaye there he ended his lyfe.
So shall tell the of other ladyes martyres ryght gloryous of holy lyfe.
Of the blyssed lady Anastase and her felowes Ca. xiiij.
THere was in the tyme of grete persecucyon of the crysten people in Rome in the tyme of Dyoclutan Emperoure.
There was in that Cyte ry ght a noble lady of grete rychesse of grete auctoryte whiche was named Anastase.
This lady had meruayllous grete compassyon of the tourment that she sawe done euery day to the martyres and for to comforte them and vysy te theym she clothed her in the habyte of a poore woman and wente with one mayden vnto the prysons where they were and comforted theym with precyous meetes and drynkes and of suche as she myght.
She wasshed and wyped theyr woundes and anoynted them with ryght precyous oyntementes.
And she contynued soo longe tyll she was accused to Publyen whiche was a noble man of Rome whiche that wolde haue had her to wyfe whiche waxed wrothe with it and he made suche awaytes on her that she durst not come oute of her house.
And then amonge other martyres in the pryson there was Saynt Gryso gone a man of ryght grete excellence the whiche hadde suffered many dyuers tourmentes and he was susteyned of the goodes and the vysytacyons of that good and gracyous lady Anastase.
Unto whome the foresayd saynt Grysogone sent couertely dyuers epystles by a good vertuous crysten woman counsaylynge her of pacyence and in the same wyse she sente vnto hym by the sayd woman.
And at the last so as god wolde he that helde her so shorte dyed.
And she solde al that she had and employed it all in the vysytacyon sustenaunce of martyres.
This noble lady hadde grete suyte of ladyes and of maydyns crystened.
There were. iij. maydens systers of noble lygnage whiche were ryght famylyer with her one of these systers was called Agappe that other Thyonne and the thyrde Hyrene.
So it came to the knowlege of the Emperour that these noble systers were crystened he sente for them and promysed them grete gyftes that he wolde marye them hyghly yf they wolde forsake the name of Ihesu cryst and as they made therof no charge he made them to be beten after to be put in harde pryson in the whiche pryson theyr holy frende Anastase vysyted them not sparynge nyght and day and prayed god that he wolde suffre her to lyue whyle her goodes endured to the entente that she myght employ them al in that holy werke.
The Emperoure commaunded Dulcycyon his prouost that all crysten peo ple that were in prysons sholde be constrayned by tourmentes to worshyp ydolles.
So sayd prouost made them for to be brought before hym amonge whiche were the. iij. systers.
And when the cursed Iuge sawe them he coueyted them for theyr beaute and counsaylled them in secrete wyse by fayre wordes and promyses that they sholde accorde to hym and he sholde delyuer theym.
But as they were all that refusynge he put them in to the warde of one was famylyer with hym and he made them to be ledde in to his house and he thought to haue them agaynst theyr wyll or wt theyr wyll.
And when the nyght came he wente alone without lyght to the house where he made them to be brought.
And as he wolde goo to the place where he herde theyr voyce whiche all the nyght dyde no thynge but prayse god He passed by the place where all the vesselles of the kechyne were kepte.
And then he full of the deuyll blynded with the spyryte of Lechery so as god wolde he toke them by the necke kyssed them straytely syth one syth another and trowed yt it had ben the maydens.
And so moche he wente thus doyn ge he was verely wery.
And when it was daye he wente to his people whiche abode hym wtout whiche when they sawe hym he semed a fygure of the deuyll so moche he was soylled with fatte and coles and his gowne rente and traylynge in the dyrte so they fledde from hym all aferde.
And when he sawe them fle thus and that they despy sed hym he was meruayllously wherfore it was so he thought hym that he wolde go and complayne to the Emperoure of that euery man mocked hym there as he wente and scorned hym.
And when he was entred into palas whe re many abode hym in the mornynge then there began a grete crye vpon hym where some bete by~ with roddes some shoued hym abacke sayenge.
Go out of the waye thou vnhappy and abhomynable persone thou stynkest all aboute some scrat ched hym in vysage and some laughed hym to scorne soo he was greately admeruaylled what that it myght be that he was almoost out of his wytte.
For the deuyll had closed soo his eyen that he myght no perceyue it so he tourned hym home agayne vnto his house ryght foule ashamed.
And then another Iuge was put in his place whiche made these thre blessyd vyrgynes to come before hym and he wolde make them to worshyppe the ydolles and for that that they wolde do nothynge as his byddynge was he commau~ ded them to be dyspoyled all naked and soo to be beten yet for all theyr myght they myght not despoyle theym for theyr clothes were so cleuynge to them that there myght no man put them of so he made them to be put in a fyre ryght hote brennynge whiche greued them nothynge.
And then they prayed to god that they myght ende theyr ly ues yf it pleased hym so they passed anone to our lorde ryght gloryously.
But for to showe that it was theyr wyll to dye the fyre neuer brente them nor none of theyr clothes and when the fyre was wasted the bodyes of them were founde the han des Ioyned as hole and fresshe as thoughe they had slepte.
And the blessyd lady Anastase whiche toke good hede of them buryed them.
ANother noble felawe had this good Anastase whiche was named Theo dory the whiche had. iij. yonge chyldren.
This lady for that that she refused maryage of the erle Lencadyne and yt she wolde not do sacrefyse to the ydolles there was made many tourmentes for her.
And to constrayne the better by moderly pyte made to tourment one of her sones.
But by the vertue of ye faythe whiche passed nature she comforted hym sayenge sone ne doubte thou not these tourmentes for by them thou shalte go to Ioye euerlastyn ge and then the lady was put in pryson.
sone of the deuyll came to her to defoule her chastyte but sodeynly he began to blede at the nose and he cry ed and sayd that a yonge felawe had smyten hym on the nose with his fyst whiche was with her in the pryson.
So this lady was tourmented and at the laste they slewe her and her. iij. sones whiche yelded theyr blessyd spyrytes gloryfyenge god the blessyd Anastase buryed them.
Then this holy Anastase had so moche haunted the vysytacyon of martyres that at the last she was taken emprysoned so she myght no more vysyre sayntes of god ne had no mete nor drynke.
But god whiche wolde not that she whiche so dylygently hadde comforted and refresshed his holy seruaun tes to suffre more he sente vnto her the spyryte of her blessyd felawe Theodorye with a grete lyght the whiche set before her a table and she brought with her dyuers precyous refecryens.
And kepte company with her. xxx. dayes in the whiche tyme was neuer delyuered to her mete nor drynke and they trowed that she had ben deed for hongre so she founde all alpue and brought before the whiche had grete sorowe and for that yt dyuers people were conuerted by ye myracle he made her to be put in a shyn with other trespassours that were condempned to dethe.
And when they were in the hyghe see the maryners to obey that that they were commaunded brake the shyp and wente in to another vessell.
And then the blessyd Theodosyne appered to them and conueyed the~ by the see a nyght and a daye as surely as they had ben vpon the playne erthe so moche that she set them in the Ile of palme in the whiche Ile the re were many byss hoppes holy men put in exyle so they were receyned there with praysynges to god with grete Ioye.
And those that were escaped with Anastase were baptysed and byleued in god.
This thynge after come to the knowlege of the Emperoure he sente to fetche theym all bothe man and woman and chylde aboute the nombre of thre hondred whiche he made all to dye by dyuers tourmentes.
And the blessyd Anastase after many grete argumentes that she made to Emperoure after dyuers that she had was crowned by martyrdome.
Ca. xvj. NAtalye noble wyfe of Adryan pryn ce of the of the Emperoure Maxymyan as she was crystened se cretly in the tyme that dyuers cryste~ people were martyred she herde saye that Adryan her housbande for whom she prayed god without seasynge was sodaynly conuerted in beholdynge ye martyres tourmented and had confessed the name of Ihesu cryst wherfore ye Em perour of that ryght wrothe made hym to be put in ryght an harde pryson.
The good lady ryght Ioyous of ye conuersyon of her housbande wente anone to ye pryson to comforte hym and to praye hym to perseuer in that he had begon and kyssed the chaynes with whiche he was bounde wepyn ge for pyte Ioye and counsayllynge hym grete ly that he wolde haue no respecte to these erthely Ioyes that endured but a whyle but that he shol de haue before his eyen the grete glory that was ordeyned for hym.
This holy lady was there lon ge comfortynge hym and all the other martyres praynge god that she myght be of theyr company and prayed them gretely that they sholde comfor te her housbande of whome she doubted her that by force of tourmentes he sholde not chaunge in the stablenesse of the faythe she vysyted hym eue ry daye and euery daye preched hym to haue stablenesse many a fayre worde she spake to hym.
But for that that she and dyuers other ladyes vy syted the holy martyres the Emperoure made to defende that no woman sholde come in to them.
And therfore she clothed her in the guyse of a man And when it came to the daye of his last martyrdome she was presente and wyped his woundes and kyssed his blode and prayed hym that he wol de pray to god for her.
And thus passed the blessyd Adryan and she toke with her one of his handes that was cutte of and wrapped it full derely in a couerchefe as a relyke.
This holy lady after the dethe of her housbande one wolde constrayne her to be wedded bycause she was of hyghe lygnage fayre and ryche so she was alway in oryson pray enge god that he wolde drawe her out of the han des of them that wolde constrayne her to be wedded.
And then there appered to her in slepynge ye spyryte of her housbande whiche comforted her and sayd vnto her that she sholde goo in to Coustantynoble to burye the bodyes of many martyres that were there and she dyde soo.
And when she had ben there a whyle in goddes seruyce in vy sytynge the holy martyres emprysoned her housbande appered vnto her agayne and sayd to her Syster and frende Chambere of Ihesu Cryste co me on in to glorye perpetuall for our lorde calleth the.
And then she awoke and anone after she passed to our lorde.
AFfra was a woman that lyued folyly conuerted to the fayth of Ihesu Cryst and was accused to the Iuge whiche sayd to her.
It suffyseth not the ye dyshonestye of thy body but yt thou muste fall in erroure to worshyp a straunge god do sacrefyse to our goddes that they maye pardon the And Affra answered shall doo sacrefyse to my god Ihesu Cryste that came downe for synners.
For his gospell sayth yt a woman a synner wassh ed his feete with her teres and had forgyuenesse And he despysed neuer folyly lyuynge woma~ ne ye publycanes synners but he lete them ete wt hym.
If thou do no sacrefyse thou shalte not be loued of thy rybaudes ne thon shalte receyue no gyftes of them.
She answered shal neuer receyue cursed gyftes those yt haue goten vntruely haue prayed to the poore peo ple that they wyll take them and pray for my fyn nes.
The Iuge gaue his se~tence that saynt Affra sholde be brente syth that she wolde not do sacrefyse.
And when she was delyuered to tourmente she worshypped god and sayd lorde god almyghty Ihesu cryst whiche callest synners to penaunce receyue my martyrdome in goood entente in the houre of my passyon delyuer me fro euerlastynge fyre by this corporall fyre that is arayed to my body ye fyre beynge aboute her she sayd.
Lorde Ihesu cryst pleaseth ye to receyue me a pore synner in sacrefyse of thy holy name offred thyselfe in sacrefyse for all the worlde and thou ryghtfull we re put on the crosse for the vnryghtfull and good for the euyll doers blessyd for the cursed swete for the bytter clene and innocent from synne to delyuer the synners.
To the offre the sacrefyse of my body whiche lyueth and reygneth with the fader and the holy ghost by all the worlde of worldes.
And thus ended the blessyd Affre for whome our lorde hath shewed syth many myracles.
Here telleth Iustyce of dyuers ladyed whiche serued and lodged the appostles and other sayntes.
WHat woldest thou that saye to the more fayre Xp~ine.
But for that thou arte adme ruaylled so as thou haste sayd here before that wherfore all auctours blame women.
saye to the that thoughe that thou hast founde it in the wrytynges of auctours pay nymes trowe that to that purpose thou fynde but fewe in holy legendes and in the hysto ryes of Ihesu cryst and of his appostles and the same wyse of all the sayntes so as thou mayst se but a grete nombre thou shalte fynde of meruayl lous constauncè by the grace of god in women good seruyces grete charytees that they haue do ne and do without faynynge and by good wyll to seruau~tes of god bothe hospytalytees other good dedes so as it is wryten of Drucyane whiche was a good lady and a awydowe whiche re ceyued to host saynt Iohn~ the euangelyst she serued hym of his mete and his drynke.
And whan the sayd saynt Iohan sholde be receyued fro his exyle and those of the cyte made hym a grete feest Drucyane was borne to be buryed whiche was deed for sorowe yt he taryed so longe her neygh boures sayd to hym.
Iohan see here Drucyane thy good hostesse whiche is deed for sorowe for thy longe taryenge she shal serue no more.
And than saynt Iohan sayd to her Drucyane ryse vp and go in to thy house and make redy my refeccy on she rose frome dethe to lyfe.
Also another of ye cyte of Lymoges named Susanne she was the fyrst that harboured saynt Marcyall whiche was sente thyder by saynt Peter to conuerte the countre and dyde hym ryght moche good.
Also the good lady Maxymylle buryed saynt Androwe and toke hym frome the crosse and doynge this she put herselfe to the peryll of dethe.
Also ye holy mayde Euphygene folowed by denocyon saynt Mathewe the euangelyst and after his dethe she made to edefye for hym ryght a fayre chyrche.
Also another good lady was so moche taken wt the loue of saynt Poule ye apostle that she folowed hym all aboute and serued hym by grete dylygence.
Also in yt tyme of ye apostles a noble quene called Helyn and it was not she was moder of Constantyne but another quene of Oblygoys whiche wente to Iherusalem in the whiche there was grete scarcete of vytaylles for the famyne that was there.
And when she knewe that the sayntes of our lorde that were in ye Cyte to preche and to conuerte the people dyed for hon+gre she made to bye so moche vytaylles for them that they were pouruayed as longe as the derthe lasted.
Also when one lydde saynt Poule to be heeded by the commaundement of Nero a good lady whiche was called Pautylle that was acostomed to serue hym came ayenst hym wepynge gretely.
And saynt Poule asked of her a couerchefe that she had vpon her heed and she toke it hym wherof the shrewde people yt were there mocked hym sayenge for that it was fayre that so moche she had loste.
Saynt Poule hymselfe wyped his eyen after when he was deed he sente it agayne to the woman full of blode wherfore she kepte it ryght rychely.
And saynt Poule appered to her and sayd that for so moche that she had done hym seruyce in heuen in prayenge for her ynoughe of others in lyke case myght tell the.
Uaxyllete was a noble lady in the vertue of charyte.
And in the ny+ght of theyr weddynge of one acorde they vowed vyrgynyte and none myght thynke the holy conuersacyon of this woman ne multytude of wo+men and maydens that were saued and drawne to holy lyfe by her holy monycyon.
To saye shortely so moche she had of grace in her that our lorde spake to her as she was in dyenge.
wote not what sholde saye more Xp~yne my dere loue myght tell the without nombre of ladyes of dy+uers estates as well vyrgynes as wydowes or maryed women in whome god hath shewed his vertues by meruayllous strengthe and constaun ce so be thou suffysed as nowe.
For ryght well fayre as it semeth me haue wel quytte me of my ne offyce in perfourmynge of the hyghe bataylementes of thy Cyte.
And haue peopled it with excellente ladyes so as promysed the.
And notwithstandynge that name not ne maye not na me all the holy ladyes by theyr names whiche hathe ben whiche that ben and whiche that shal be all maye be comprehended in this Cyte of Ladyes of the whiche one maye saye.
That is to say glory ous thynges ben sayd of the thou Cyte of god.
So yelde it to the as a parfyte thynge wel and stably so as promysed the.
Nowe betake the to god and the peas of oure hyghe souerayne be euerlastyngely with the.
AMEN Here Xp~ine speketh vnto the ladyes in the ende of the boke.
Ca. xix. MI ryght redoubted ladyes worshyp ped by god nowe is our Cyte well accheued and made parfyte in the whiche all ye that loueth honoure vertue praysynge may be lodged with grete worshyp as wel those that are past as those that ben nowe and those that be to come.
For it is founded and made for euery woman of worshyp.
And my ryght dere ladyes it is a thynge natural to mannes herte to reioyce hym when he fyndeth hym that he hathe the vyctory of ony entrepryse and that his enemyes be confounded So haue ye cause all ye my ladyes to reioyce you nowe vertuously in god and in good co~dycyons by this newe cyte to se it parfyte whiche may not be onely the refuge of al you that is to vnderstan de of vertuous women but also the defence and warde ayenst your enemyes and assayllers yf ye kepe it well.
For ye may se that the matter wherof it is made is all of vertue and so truely shynynge that all ye maye beholde therin and specyally in emfrytaylynge of this laste partye and the same wyse in that whiche may touche you of other par tyes.
Soo vse ye not of this newe herytage as these proude people whiche be come so full of pryde whe~ theyr prosperyte encrea seth and are mounted in rychesse but by ensample of your quene the souerayne vyrgyne whiche after so grete worshyp that the aungell brought to her as to be the moder of the sone of god.
She so moche more meked her in callynge her hande mayden of god.
So my ladyes as be it true that the more the vertues ben the more ye ought to yel de you humble benygne and this Cyte be cause vnto you to loue good maners and to be vertuous and humble.
And haue ye not in despyte ye ladyes that ben maryed to be so subiectes to your housbandes.
For it is not some tymes beste to a creature to be free out of subieccyon that wytnesseth the tonge of our lorde god where he sayth to Esoras the prophete.
Those he sayth that vse theyr free wyll falleth in synne and despyse theyr lorde and defouleth the Iuste people and therfore they perysshe.
So be ye humble and and the grace of god shall encreace in you and ye shal be gyuen in praysynge to worlde.
For saynt Gregory sayth that pacyence is the entrye of paradyse and the way of Ihesu Cryst.
And amon you vyrgynes in the state of maydenhode be ye clene symple coye and without ydelnesse.
So be ye armed with vertuous strengthe agaynst theyr cauteyles to eschewe theyr frequentacyon.
And to ladyes wedowes be honest in habyte countenaunce and in worde deuoute in dede and in conuersacyon prudente in gouernaunce pacyente in that where nede is in mekenesse in charyte.
And to all generally grete meane lytel wyll ye alway to be set in defence agaynst the ene myes of your worshyp chastyte.
Se my ladyes howe these that accuseth you maketh all them lyers that blameth you.
And put abacke these losen gyers whiche by dyuers draughtes hurteth and withdraweth that that ye ought to kepe so well that is to vnderstande your worshyppes.
the lewde loue of whiche they counsayle you and styreth you therto.
Fle it for goddes loue fle it for be ye certayne thoughe that the semblaunt be fayre it is deceyuable that at all tymes the ende of it is preiudyce to you.
And thynke not the contrary for otherwyse it maye not be.
Remembre howe they call you frayle and false and alwaye they seke en gynes ryght straunge and deceyuable with grete payne and trauayle for to take you so as one do the to take wylde beestes.
Flee theyr gynnes my ladyes flee theyr acquayntaunce vnder laughyn ge of whome is lapped venyme ryght full of anguysshe whiche bryngeth one lyghtly to the dethe And thus that it please you my ryght redoubted ladyes to drawe to the vertues and flee vyces to encreace and multeplye our Cyte and ye to reioy ce in well doynge.
And me your seruaunt to be re commended vnto you in praynge god whiche by his grace in this worlde graunte me for to lyue and perseuer in his holy seruyce and at the ende to be pyteous to my grete defautes and graunte bothe vnto you and me the Ioye whiche endureeuermore.

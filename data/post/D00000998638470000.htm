historical reflections on the bishop of rome chiefly discovering those events of humane affaires which most advanced the papal usurpation

the praeface
the&se reflections having laine by me long enough to coole the heat of my invention upon a late review of them was to this publication
and here dare promise the reader that he shall not meet with crambe bis cocta or a meer garbling of other mens labours
for amongst all the various tracts written against the pope there never came any into my hands of the same kind
now if the novelty hereof shall invite any one to a perusal perhaps he will not altogether repent his pains especially if he intend for historical knowledg
in regard that this treatise may serve as a praemonstratour or pointer out of the most remarkable revolutions in ecclesiastique affairs and the most notable junctures of time

the thing which chiefly aime at in the ensuing discourse is to make it appeare that the hierarchical policy of the roman church was not extant in the learned times when the old roman empire flourisht but was contrived in the daies of ignorance between the bishops of rome and the leaders or princes of the barbarians

nor would the truth of this assertion be in the least manner doubted were we not almost benighted with darke ignorance in reference to preceeding ages
for as on the one hand an infinite number of books have been partly abolished partly counterfeited and partly adulterated or corrupted so on the other hand those books which remaine entire are for the most part written either by unskilful or partial pens
however from the very present records an man though of ordinary parts may gather that the modern policy which fashions a great part of the world as well in church as state did take it's beginning since the inundations of the northerne people

that the roman bishops had no supremacy over the primitive christians

have often delighted to trace out in my mind the footsteps of the papal usurpations
and perhaps it will please the reader to give him in one view the several steps or degrees by which the roman bishop rose unto such a heigth as to trample upon the necks not only of his fellow bishops but also of kings and emperours themselves
for that the pope did not from the beginning enjoy his present great and lordly power but arrived unto it by several gradations in a long processe of time none but those who are either wholy ignorant of history or else swayed with invincible prejudice can offer to deny
it being manifest on all hands that in the primitive times the roman bishops were not

taken notice of as superiours to all others much lesse as sole vicars under christ and infallible dictatours of divine truth
indeed you may meet in the ancient authours with commendations given unto the faith professed by the bishops of rome
which is no wonder to him that considers how pious at first they were in their lives how glorious in their deaths bearing witnesse to the truth under persecution
besides when the whole christian world was under one empire and rome the metropolis or emperial city it was but rational that the new and rising sect of the christians should bestow the notabl'st men of their party in that place
hence it came to passe that the fathers dwelling in the provinces when they contested with hereticks did often commend the roman faith as it were upbraiding their antagonists with a departure from those who resided in the metropolis of the empire where usually learning and religion doe most flourish

and to speak the truth that advantage which the roman bishops had by dwelling in the emperial city was the chiefe temptation at first inducing them to affect a supremacy
for that the dignity and grandeur of a city or place of residence was wont to put spirits into the bishops residing therein rome is not the onely example
so did alexandria puffe up her bishops
so did jerusalem hers
so especially did constantinople make john the constantinopolitan swell with ambition and pride affecting the title of oecumenical bishop
nay which you'l more wonder at even so

did ravenna when proud with exarchs animate her bishop also in contending with the roman for superiority
which contention went so far that the church of ravenna by reason of her separation from rome was commonly called allocephalis
now by how much the renowned and ancient rome was more venerable in the eyes of men than other cities by so much had the roman bishops a fairer opportunity than others to put themselves forward and usurp an unlawfull power
nor needed they to be minded of this advantage such of them as were of haughty spirits beginning betimes to make use of it amongst whom may justly reckon leo surnamed the great
for he and severall others did take all occasions to send pragmaticall letters up and down the world about every important businesse which happened in christendome

neverthelesse let no one be afraid of the roman bishops and be ready to ascribe unto them an universall diocesse when he finds them frequently sending stately letters to the bishops throughout the christian world
many of those letters recorded in the book entitled epistolae decretales summorum pontificum are false and counterfeit many adulterated or corrupted and many if true are so haughtily written as to argue the authours pride but not his power
for in the pimitive times the christian bishops did generally and not only the roman write often to their fellow bishops in whatsoever place they resided
and this they did whether they had any power one over the

other or no meerly from a principle of love or christian charity
which familiar epistolary entercourse with one another was in those daies laudable and allmost necessary in regard the whole christian world was at that time under one empire
consequently they were obliged to exhort and admonish one another upon a twofold respect
partly grounded on that interest which members of the same commonwealth especially those of the same rank have with one another and partly grounded on that spiritual communion which ought to be between believers especially those of the same calling

but alas had the world been perswaded in the primitive times that the letters of the roman bishop were not onely charitative advisoes but dictatorian mandates necessary to be obeyed as proceeding forsooth from one whom christ had appointed head of his church and an oracle whence nothing but veritable answers should be heard
say had such a perswasion possessed the minds of men they would have made it the common subject of their praises and thanksgiving
without question many panegyricall orations and many homilies would have been made upon no other theme or text than the praises of the roman see and thanks unto god for bestowing on the christians a visible unerring decider of controversie
whereas on the contrary if we peruse the ancient writers we shall plainly perceive how little the noise was which the roman bishops did make in their daies so little that much wonder they were no

more talkt of considering as said before their residence in the metropol and their virtues eminent in the first bishops not the fathers been very malignant in this case if the papal pretenses were true not to leave it set down expresly in any of their writings that christ made peter the head of his church and gave unto him an infallible spirit as also that peter being bishop of rome the following bishops in that city succeeded him not only in his bishoprick but likewise in his great priviledges of headship and infallibility
moreover did not the fathers trouble themselves to no purpose in toyling to make laborious confutations of hereticks if they might have had present recourse to a visible unerring authority in decision of controversies
so that suppose the hereticks had refused to submit unto this authority the maine worke should have been not to confute their opinions but to convince them of the duty of their obedience to the supreme judg

for my own part verily believe that if the bishops of rome had been acknowledged in the primitive times to be what he pretends to in these daies the eyes of all nations would have been upon that see to revere it to honour it to bow down before it in the submission of their understandings
nay further am really perswaded had christ intended such a supreme power in his church seeing it doth so highly import the church's welfare to be generally known we should have had it set down in scripture with as expresse termes as we find justification by faith or

the resurrection of the dead
but now on the contrary what is there left by penmen which may be said to patronize the and infallibility of peter and the roman as for peter how easy were it for me to evacuate those trivial arguments which are drawn from scripture concerning him which forbeare to doe because it is not my intent to insist upon logical arguments either pro or con but only to reflect on historical passages

wherefore cannot chuse but take notice that when peter came to antioch he walked not according to the truth but was guilty of a great scandall and thereupon withstood to the face by paul
who makes it his businesse in the two first chapters to the galatians to prove himselfe equall with the rest of the apostles
nay when peter to speak according to their own phrase was in cathedra in the midst of a councel of apostles and other brethren the definitive sentence to which all did assent proceeded from the mouth of james

as for the roman bishop you must not look to have any hint of him in scripture
peter never being taken notice of under such a capacity nay paul in those several epistles which he wrote either to or from rome doth not so much as mention peter
which is somewhat strange if peter did dwell in that city
for paul is solicitous in mentioning severall others farre lesse considerable whom he doth either salute or send salutations from to others
but what if it should be granted that peter was at rome am confident it

would trouble the whole papacy to prove that ever he was bishop of that city
paul it's certain was there and those who contend that peter was too doe generally hold they were both martired at the same time the one by the sword the other by the crosse
why then was peter bishop and not paul i'me sure the scripture saith that paul was entrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision as peter with that of the circumcision nay james and peter and john did solemnly give the right hands of fellowship unto barnabas and paul that they should goe to the gentiles and themselves unto those of the circumcision

how or by what causes the pope was advanced to a supremacy in the church
but shall not trouble my selfe any longer to make it appeare that neither peter nor the primitive bishops of rome had that power which the later bishops pretend to derive from them there being few in our nation that will gainsay the truth of what have said
wherefore having allready made such briefe remarques as plainly evince the pope to be an usurper am now come to what did chiefely intend namely to lay down the several steps or degrees by which he was advanc'd in his usurpations
this shall doe by reflecting on the events of humane affairs and giving an account in order of the several causes which did cooperate towards the bringing of the intolerable roman yoake on the necks of our forefathers

the first cause therefore was the removing of the empertal seat by constantine
for though a good while after him there were westerne as well as eastern emperours yet after the on italy by the heruls first and then the goths the emperial majesty did entirely reside at constantinople
now this city

by constantines means was grown so magnificent and august that it was dearer to the emperours than rome in selfe
insomuch that when bellisarius and narses had recovered italy from the goths the emperours never affected to goe and reside at old rome by which means the bishop thereof gained the more elbow rome to play rex

secondly the residing of the italian exarchs at ravenna
justine the second was authour of the exarchy to which kind of government the italian writers impute most of the calamities afterwards befalling italy
but indeed it was the occasion of an other guise calamity than they were aware of
for now neither the emperour himselfe nor so much as his exarch resided at rome only a petty companion who was sent by the exarchs to praeside over the city and was called duke in the same manner as the governour of narni spoleto and other townes of italy
hence it came to passe that the splendour of emperiall majesty being far removed from the eyes of the roman people their bishops shone so much the brighter and gaind a proportionable increase of veneration

thirdly the comming of the lombards into italy who intending the finall conquest of that country for themselves made it their businesse to destroy the power of the emperour whom they found lord thereof
wherefore as soone as the emperour began to chastise the insolency of any roman bishop who now by reason of the aforementioned causes began to play tricks the lombard was at hand to help him
again

on the otherside when the lombard out of a desire to win rome it selfe fell foule with it's bishop the emperour for fear of loosing his dominion was faine to helpe him whom before he did endeavour to punish marke how capriciously things in those daies stood and how exceeding well they suited with the roman bishop whensoever he had to doe with the lombard he was sure of the emperous help and when he contended with his master the barbarian presently took his part
thus did he rivet himselfe into his authority between the emperour and the lombard till at last by the helpe of the french he brought them both below himselfe as to any italian dominion

fourthly the reputation of gregory the first roman bishop of that name who was sir named the great
this man lived in the hottest season of the barbarian violence when the empire of the romans and their learning failed
in such an age as that was he being endowed with great natural parts and well accomplisht with acquired perfections did easily overtop his contemporaries
before he was bishop by his retiring for devotion's sake to the private life of a monk by his zealous turning his own house at rome into a monastery in general by his outward austerity and sanctity of life he so gained upon the roman people that they would not part with him when he proffered to goe into brittany for to convert the saxons
and when he was sent to constantinople upon publique employment he quickly obtained the emperour's favour

afterwards when he was chosen bishop by his zeale in continuing to write volume upon volume concerning the christian doctrine as also in destroying the heathen authours and those goodly buildings at rome which he feared might tempt the admiring beholders to hanker after the ancient roman glory by his new modelling the christian worship adding many inventions of his own to make it more splendid and pompous in vulgar eyes by his converting the english saxons by these and many other waies he grew renowned in the world and filled christendome with his name
nor did his glory expire with his life about an hundred years after this gregory our bede in the west and monke damascene in the east were passionate in their respects for him and highly magnified him in their writings
nay generally the monks for a long time did so reverence his memory that he seemed to eclipse the primitive fathers
now this great esteem and high valuation which the world had of gregory the first did redound upon the roman see and proved notably advantageous for his successours
but nothing more strengthned their hands than his converting our english nation
no people in the world for a long time after were more prodigal of their bloud more enpensive of their estates in behalfe of the roman bishops than our english no people more earnest in their devotion to rome
this can be attributed to nothing else but their conversion by gregory and to that impression which his memory had left in the minds of their ancestours and was handed along

from father to sonne
nay what say ye if at this very day the gregorian praises be fresh amongst our english papists who also have a tender regard for the memory of their convertor austin and love the very benedictines for his sake

fifthly the prodigious growth of the saracenical empire founded by mahomet in the time of heracltus
the saracens cut out so much worke for the graecian emperour in his easterne provinces that he was forced to neglect and at last give over his interest in the west
now this may be observed all along in history that the weakning of the emperours was the strengthning of the popes

sixthly the general deluge of barbarians overwhelming the romans in the west much about the same time that the saracens did in the east
pannonia italie spaine france brittain were all not many years after one another
these barbarians comming from climates frozen with ignorance as well as cold did both give and receive a conquest
as they conquered the romans by their sword so they were reciprocally foild by the roman learning and religion
now the bishop of rome was the grand instrument of their conversion
for in those times of general desolation he best held his own and was most eminent in the eyes of the barbarians by reason of his residence in that renowned city concerning which before their passage over the rhine and the danow they had heard their fathers speak of old
how feasable then was it for him to foist what he pleas'd into the beliefe of

those men who newly came from worshipping such kind of gods as aegypt was wont to adore alas those silly soules taken up with amazement at a discovery of the true god had neither leasure nor ability to attend the observing of those obtruded fopperies which they did imbibe together with the principles of their religion wherefore if he that first told them of an omnipotent eternal god whose seat was in the highest heavens and of a crucified saviour did at the same time tell them of a st peter and his successour tis no wonder that they believed one as well as the other
if valens the emperour be an arrian then all those whom he converts will be arrians too
for it is well known that the visigoths flying from before the approaching hun when they had obtained their request from valens for a quiet habitation in thrace did not only receive from him the doctrine of christ but that of arrius also insomuch that they and their posterity for a long time after did stoutly maintain arrianism
so great a prevalency hath that doctrine which is first seated in the spirits of men
here shall crave leave of the reader to make a small digression concerning baronius with a promise to trouble him so no more
baronius in his annals will needs have it contrary to several historians that these goths were converted to christianity long before the time of valens
his reason is because in the time of constantine they had a bishop named theophilus present at the nicene councel
but suppose nothing can be lawfully concluded thence

excepting this that some few of them were christians in the dayes of constantine for my part that the body of their nation was converted before their entrance into thrace by the permission of valens see no reason to believe

seventhly the collusion between zacharias the third and pipin major domo to the king of france pipin made use of zacharias's authority towards the decision of that ridiculous question which was so solemnly sent to rome
namely whether he that had the name and title of a king only being given to idlenesse or he that was active and exercised the office and power of a king deserved to weare the regal diademe which in plain termes was this whether chilperick king of france descended from the ancient race of kings having out of respect to his own ease entrusted the management of affairs with his servant pipin might not be turned out of that throne which his ancestours had so long enjoyed by his own servant whom he had unadvisedly rais'd to a capacity of doing it if he would the good pope was not ashamed of this senselesse question nor needed he to be instructed how profitable it was to judge for the strongest at length it came to this that king chilperick's head was shaven and his man pipin's wore the crown
now pipin having made use of pontificial authority to cheat the poore francks of their king and to invade the temporal soveraignty did out of gratitude recompense the pope with a spiritual jurisdiction over the gallicane church
nay further when desiderius the lombard infested gregory

the third pipin out of a tender regard to that see which had been so friendly towards him not only by his aid delivered the pope from feare of being besieged in rome but gave him as the italian writers say the exarchate with several other territories

eighthly the conquering arms of charlemaign son to king pipin who having the same reasons that his father had to indulge the pontificial see confirmed whatsoever his father pipin had granted to the pope
yet to make him the more sure leo the third with the people of rome elected him roman emperour
hence it came to passe that as far as the conquests made by charlemaigne did reach so farre also did papal authority extend no otherwise than the mahometan doctrine did enlarge it's bounds by the victorious arms of ottoman

thus have we proceeded to the pope's ecclesiastique supremacy through eight severall causes
of which the six former may be accounted the more remote or procatarctique the two latter being those which put together doe integrate the principal efficient and adaequate cause
for although the six procatarctiques did very much embroile the church affairs and laid them in a tendency to papal encroachments yet it is evident that the universal power which the pope acquired over the western churches owed it's very rise and being to the notorious jugling between the roman bishops and the usurpers of the french merovingean crown
well therefore may the kings of france be stiled the eldest sons of the papal church nay rather

let them be stiled fathers thereof
there being no appearance in history of a generall submission unto the pontificiall see untill the dayes of the traitor pipin and the emperour his son
but then you may perceive as it were a bargain stroake of mutual assistance between the pontificial and the french tyrants
the pontificial assistance is made use of by pipin for the deposing his master and invading the french crown by charles his sonne for the obtaining of the western empire
they on the other side in lieu of their secular kingdomes settle upon the popes an ecclesiastique soveraignty
nor are they content to gratifie them only so but they must needs be giving them a very fair temporal demeans
the tast of which did so please their palates that they have been ever since hankering to be lords paramount over all the world in civil as well as ecclesiastical affairs
wherefore it behoves me next to set down the remaining causes of the papal encroachment whereby the bishop of rome was encouraged to usurp unto himselfe the rights of the magistrate

chap
iii
how or by what causes the pope was not onely confirmed in his ecclesiastical usurpation but was also encouraged to invade the rights of the magistrate
here shall in the first place premise that the causes mention'd in the foregoing chapter did not only advance the pope's ecclesiastique tyrannie but also had an influence upon the making of way for his temporal usurpation
had he not first come to that heighth in the church he could never have dreamt of a superintendency over the state
likewise the causes which now follow are to be allowed an influence upon the popes domination spiritual by way of confirming him in his unjust acquests although confesse they do more neerly concerne his invading the rights of the magistrate in regard that we have already brought him unto the highest pinnacle in the church

ninthly the donation which pipin made and his sonne charles confirmed unto the pope whereby he was possessed of a very large territory yet not as lord in chiefe thereof but rather as a dependant on the empire as appeares by several actions of charlemaigne

and his sons after him which sufficiently evince that they kept the soveraignty of those places still unto themselves however this proved such a bait of temptation to the pope that he hath ever since had an unbridled lust after the kingdomes of this world and the glory thereof insomuch that he who pretends to be the universal vicar of christ and deputy to him in his kingdome seems unto me a pretty riddle
our saviour doth absolutely declare that his kingdome is not of this world but pray to what world doth that belong which is full of armed souldiers walled cities fortified havens strong gallies great guns abundance of ammunition and treasures

tenthly the general decay of learning after the dayes of charlemaign whence it came to passe that the east and the west were not more alienated one from the other by the distinction of different empires than they were by the want of mutual correspondence in learned entercourses
nay it was the policy of the popes by affronts done to the emperours and several other waies to augment the strangenesse between the greeks and the latines
that so the barbarians being brought up in a prejudice against the gracians might neglect their language and consequently be overcast with such a night of ignorance that they should not be able to see the injustice of the papal proceedings
and truly to the losse of the greek tongue may justly be imputed the losse of all purity in the latine and consequently of history geography skill in antiquity and whatsoever savour'd

of polite learning
thus the whole western empire were quite deprived of the benefit they might have received by informing their judgments in religion with the goodly books that were written in greek nay they did not so much as knowingly converse with the latin fathers so that it was allmost impossible for them to be acquainted with the infant purity of the christian religion which they had taken upon trust from the roman bishop
whereas if they had but well studied the writings of those men whose fathers were converted together with nay some before the bishop of rome it would have been manifest that he was no such man amongst the first christians as he pretended himselfe to be amongst them as also how notoriously for the advancing of his own power he had impos'd upon the credulous ignorance of their heathen souls
now that this tenth reason of the papal encroachment is not a bare notion or a thing meerly bred in my own private conceptions any one will confesse who doth but consider how really it is exemplified in the series of humane transactions
as long as this fog of ignorance did darken mens understandings neither the preaching nor the martyrdome of thousands of people could much prevaile to the shaking off the roman yoke
but the case was quite alter'd when at the taking of constantinople the graecian schollars were forced to sly for refuge among the western christians they every where teaching their own tongue the reviving of that noble language did bring along with it the restoration

of all learning
so that now what neither wicklef nor hus nor hierome of prague nor the waldenses and albigenses could effect that luther and calvin have wonderfully perform'd to the conversion of whole nations
as soon as the restoration of learning had enlightned the world men were of their own accord disposd to follow any who by breaking the ice as it were should lead the way to their spiritual freedome

eleventhly the fatal discord between the grand children of charles the great who as soon as their father lewis the godly was dead fell together by the cares about the empire
at last they came to this composition that lewis should be king of germany and so much of france as lieth betwixt the meuse and the rhine
charles should be king of the rest of france except the province of narbone which together with italy and the title of emperour fell to lotharius who indeed ought to have been emperour of the whole as being the eldest and chosen by their father in his life time to be his colleague in the empire thus was the empire of charlemaign cantonized by his nephews and at last brought to a contemptible state for want of establishing a firme succession in the eldest
hence it came to passe that the huns the saracens and the lombard dukes did miserably afflict the empire finding no united strength to oppose them
moreover france fell quite off from the empire being governed by its own kings
nay when otho the great had setled the confusions brought upon

italy by berengarius guido and lambert
yet still did the old danger hang over the empire for want of a firme succession for as soon as he and his son otho the second were dead there grew that quarrel between some of the romans and the germans about election of a new empirour which made way for the pope to order all things according to his own advantage as appeares by the twelth cause that next followes

twelfthly the formal making of the empire elective by the constitution of otho the third and gregory the fifth whereby the romans were excluded from the chusing of their own emperour it being wholy conferred on the germane princes
otho and gregory were induced to make this alteration by some affronts which they had received from the roman people
for otho after the death of his father had like to have missed of the emperiall crown
the party of one crescentius a powerfull roman publickly giving out that it was high time for the italians to choose themselves an emperour and to bring the seat of the empire into italy again
however otho at last carried it and crescentius with his party did submit
but when otho had made his own countryman and kinsman bruno pope by the name of gregory the fifth the romans brake out into greater discontents than formerly so that the new made pope is faine to fly for't
in his absence the people of rome make crescentius their consul and he makes john bishop of placenti a pope
well the emperour otho marches into italy

takes the castle of st angelo in which crescentius had fortified himselfe and puts him to an ignominous death
and having cruelly tortured john of placentia he resettles his cozen pope gregory
hereupon he and his cozen having been equally vext by the roman people did take a sharpe revenge in transferring from them upon their own nation the power of choosing the emperour
otho had no children to care for and so was the more desirous to have the empire setled in an elective way after such a manner as he thought was advantagious to the germans
the cunning pope did not only gratifie his countrimen the germans and revenge himselfe upon his enemies the italians but also abundantly provide for the emolument of his successours
it being provided in this constitution that he who was elected by the german princes should be called caesar or king of the romans but not emperour or augustus till he was crowned and consecrated by the bishop of rome
thus was the unreasonabl'st thing in the world committed that a bishop should take from a people over whom he had but the spiritual charge their temporal birthright of electing their own prince and conveigh much of it into his own hands
but when was this done even in that barbarous age which was wrapt up in the very midnight of ignorance which brought not forth so much as one ecclesiastique writer either good or bad
and therefore is noted for a miserable age by bellarmine himselfe in the column of his chronology over against those times which column is entitled varia

thirteenthly the unhappy juncture of a silly rash inconsiderate emperour and a cunning subtile audacious pope at the very same time
mean henry the fourth and pope hildebrand alias gregory the seventh
henry led a most dissolute extravagant life in making traffick with the german bishops selling their preferments for mony
besides he went about to enslave the saxons a considerable body of his subjects by building castles in their country to keep them in awe whil'st they were trampled upon by his licentious creatures
this made the saxons take armes in defense of their own liberty and at first they forced him to a composition but afterwards he gathering a great army together quite routed the saxons and within a while got their chiefe princes into his power having first passed his word for their security by the mouths of his ambassadours
now such was the basenesse of his nature that having once got them into his power he brake his word and promise with them all excepting otho duke of bavaria to the great regret of the german princes
things stood in this posture when hildebrand or gregory the seventh took occasion to fish in troubled waters
for the pope observing that the germans were generally discontented with the perfidious cruelty of their emperour judged it the most opportune season to trample upon emperial majesty
wherefore he summons henry to appear at rome and give in his answers to those accusations that were brought against him for selling the episcopal preferments
henry instead of appearing convenes

a councel at wormes
where it is decreed that the pope shall be degraded from his pontificial dignity because he came to it by sinister and unlawfull meanes
hildebrand hearing this excommunicates the chiefe of the councel and not only them but the emperour too interdicting him from government and disengaging forsooth his subjects from their oath of obedience
now one would have thought that the world should have whooted at the arrogance of this proud priest and have taken him down from that domineering throne whence he had taken the boldnesse to act such a part of lordly pride
but alas the germans were so far from checking the papal insolence as that they were glad of an occasion to oppose the emperour for the relieving their own grievances
wherefore they combin'd together and raised such a formidable strength that the emperour was forced unto base submissions to the pope
and though at last henry did so bestir himselfe that he depos'd this pragmatical gregory the seventh
yet was not that revenge no nor the bloud of a thousand hildebrands able to wash off that stain which the emperial majesty had received
for the succeding popes having once had a president case wherein they saw an emperour was not only excommunicated and interdicted from government by a bishop of rome but was forc'd to stoop and submit unto that interdictment by his own subjects they never lest afterward to thunder out their bulls of excommunication against any prince that did but enterfere with their ambition

fourteenthly the selling of the emperial right to many chiefe italian cities such as florence genoa lucca bologne and others by the emperour rodolph of hasburg
who was of such a carelesse humour as that he was wont in sport to give the same reason for his not visiting italy which the fox did for his not visiting the lion
to wit he could see the steps of those that went thither but not of those that came back again
the truth is rodolph supine negligence about the italian affairs did so break the neck of the emperial interest in italy that it could never hold up it's head again to any purpose
for although the emperour henry the seventh did bestir himselfe somewhat in the setling of lombardy and appointing a sherif to governe milaine yet not long after the emperour was grown so contemptible that charles the fourth was crowned by the consent of pope innocent the fourth upon this condition that he should pack immediatly out of italy
charles obeyed his high and mighty holinesse and passing homeward through milaine he did utterly evacuate the emperial power in italy by making the shreifdome of milaine haereditary for which he received a good sum of mony
a good sum also his son wenceslaus did afterwards receive to make the sherisdome a dukedome
thus the popes saw at last that which their hearts had so long panted after namely the emperours quite stript of their dominion in italy and themselves free from being under the nose of them who rais'd the pontificial greatnesse and are by right the lords and masters of their holinesses

after this the emperours enjoyed only an insignificant titular paramountship over italy whereby they did now and then for mony turne an earldome into a marquisate and a marquisate into a dukedome

fifteenthly the growing in fashion of a very corrupt ad adulterate kind of learning called school divinity
a thing compounded of some truths some papal inventions and some aristotelical shall say or rather arabian philosophy
for it is certain that the philosophy which then flourisht was taught and improved by such men who understood not aristotle
nay which is worse who derived their knowledg from the arabians that did not understand him themselves
but that which made this philosophy the more imperfect was the men who professed it were such as sate in their studies abstracted from the observation and experience of things conversing only with notions and multiplying one notion after another till at last they arrived pardon an odde phrase to the cobweb subtilty of a wordy nothingnesse
hence it became a meer shop of controversial uncertainties and a storehouse of twofac'd distinctions which serve to countenance what side of the question you please
since therefore this philosophy is of a nature so aequivocal and jugling no man needs to wonder if the schoolmen by applying it to divinity were able to fashion religion into what forme they pleas'd
for although the whole masse of their distinctions could never by mincing the matter turne one falschood into a truth yet

they might so far pare and slice a falshood as to make it shew trim enough to deceive a praepossessed understanding
say a praepossessed understanding because the pontificial doctrine had in those daies taken possession of almost all our parts of the christian world and had the wealth of the nations in it's own disposal children were brought up in that perswasion and when they were grown men the hopes of all their preferment lay that way
now this is palpable enough that when the bent of our understanding is enclined to any party by the strong biasses of education and interest we straightway greedily embrace all shewes and appearances of reason which seem to make for our side and with abundance of selfe applause improve a meer sneaking hint of an opinion into a demonstrative confidence

sixteenthly the thriving of the canon law a sister profession with
these two being as it were twins borne of their mother the roman church much about the same time by the midwifery of gratian the monk and peter lombard
as for the canon law suppose it may not unfitly be called a messe of divinity and civil law boild together but burnt too by reason that as we say in english the bishop's foot have been in it namely the foot of the bishop of rome
whosoever looks into it he may easily perceive how papal politick tenents have been forsted in as lawes
but if any one be loath to take the paines himselfe he shall find many places to this purpose cited for his

hand in sleidan's third book de quatuor summis imperiis
where that judicious authour expresseth himselfe with much indignation against this kind of learning
nor was he alone moved with a prejudice against it many thousands besides him having high resentments of those many ills which spread abroad the world by reason of the canon law
otherwise the decretals would never have been branded with a proverbial ignominy as they were in france witnesse that notable tetrastique recorded by gregory of tholouse in his commentary on the preface of the decretals

des puis que decret ha prins ales et les gendarmes portent males et les moines vont a cheval en tout le mond ha que mal

the first and last of these verses which only concern my purpose may be thus englished

after decretals followed the decree since that the world hath n'ought but knavery

now if gregory the ninth's decretals were justly liable to such a censure what shall we say of the sixth book put out by boniface the eighth of the clementines

by clement the fifth and the extravagants by john the twenty second the latter pope still exceeding the former in arrogancy and insolence
however let the canon law be what it will this is certain it hath been one of the notablest engines in the whole world to raise the papal see to an adored heighth
for by this means the minds of many thousands were trained up in a reverence to the roman bishops who seem to emulate emperial majesty by taking upon them to give lawes unto the world
now the names of justinian and tribonian began to dwindle and gregory with his raymund grew in request nor hath ever aristotle nor galen nor justinian nor the very bible it selfe been more zealously smothered with commentatours than the decretals of gregory have been
nay what say ye if the canonists have been past all shame in the heat of contending for their own faculties charles du moulin in his treatise of the french monarchy saith that some of them carp't at the civil lawes as impious and of no worth
and francis hottoman in his tract intitled fulmen brutum testifies that they look upon the pope as their jupiter giving him halves with the emperour in the government of the world as appeares by this verse which they commonly applied to the pope

divisum imperium cum jove caesar habet

this is high language you say but perhaps it may be accounted modest if we consider how

their own law teacheth them that the pope is above the emperour
wherefore no man needs to doubt that the prevailing of such a profession in the world hath been an incredible advantage to the roman bishop as being the founder and patron thereof for we all know with what eagernesse of spirit the professours of any faculty doe usually contend for their patrons
whence may lawfully conclude that as long as this pontificial law shall be attended with wealthy preferments so long the pope will never want janisaries mean canonists who for the sake of their own profession and the bread which they get by it will allwaies be sure to be trusty myrmidons in the roman cause

thus have at last traced out the papal encroachments through sixteene several causes without mentioning others which seeme not to here so great and necessary an influence
such as the title of universal bishop given unto boniface the third by the tyrant phocas
the holy warre trumpeted forth by peter the hermite at the appointment of urban the second
the abrogation of the roman banderensian magistracy whereby clement the fifth became absolute master of rome and the like
far lesse was it my intent to take notice of constantine's donation and such other things which indeed make much for the pontificial advancement if true but their

truth is questioned by all indifferent men
there being as great a certainty that many false stories have been coyn'd as well as true ones suppressed by the pope's creatures
amongst which kind of delinquents tis probable that pandulphus the librarian of the lateran church was not the least guilty

chap
iv
a corollary deduced from the preceeding discourse with a conclusion intimating how much the pope is beholding to the want of able and faithfull historians

and now let the papists object if they please that we have have forsaken the paths of our forefathers with little regard unto ancient times pray what is the autiquity they boast of or what were those ancestours they upbraid us with can they date their hierarchichal constitution under one supreme head higher than the barbarous times and are not we as also the nations round about us the of barbarians as long as the roman empire stood firme and the stock of primitive christians did remaine there was no pope to be heard of
nor is it likely that ever the progeny of those men who were converted by the apostles and taught by the fathers would have given way to papal dominion any more than the posterity of the graecians did
but in come our ancestors a barbarous generation halfe starved with the cold of their own climates and resolved for a warmer habitation
in come they and like a deluge

carry all before them implanting their selves in the roome of those who were the race of first borne christians
which when they had done they did with admiration here from their conquered enemies the newes of an omnipotent god a crucified saviour a heaven and a hell
now what could be expected from these ignorant barbarians whose former adoration was of no sublimer straine than to worship the image of a dead man a peice of wood or a rotten clout nay whose later discoveries were made unto them by word of mouth and taken upon trust they themselves being void of all kind of learning whereby they might have been enabled to search the ancient writers say what could be expected from such men but that they should be easily cozened partly with the specious pretense of a derived succession and supremacy from peter by the roman bishop and partly with the collusion between the bishops of that emperial city and their own commanders

well then if they be deluded must we be so to or rather ought we not to assert our own liberty and shake off that pontificial yoke under which the spirits of our forefathers did groan the revolutions of eternal providence have brought better times upon us their children than ever they enjoyed
it was much about two hundred yeares agoe that mahomet the great turke did take constantinople to the utter subversion of the graecian empire
whereby overcasting the sun of christianity with

a dismal cloud in the eastern parts he was the accidental occasion that it shone the more bright in the west
for the poore greeks being dispersed all abroad their learned men to wit theodore gaza john lascaris manuel chrysaloras and others did betake themselves to the teaching of the greeke tongue
hereupon that treasury of all arts and sciences being so happily retrerv'd the purity of learning began to revive again and those books which ever since the daies of the goths and lombards had lain rotting in the publique libraries were every where pulled out of heaps of dust and recovered from the moths and worms
by this means we who are the latest nephewes of our barbarous ancestours doe yet overlook them even in reference to their own daies and plainly perceive that they were heathenish christians for a long time void of all knowledg and receiving their instructions from the contrived policy of corrupted men
we on the contrary enjoy the original scriptures and the learned monuments of the primitive christians by which it is easy to understand that christianity is no carnal profession much lesse that on it is entayl'd the dominion of this present world
that the bishops of rome as well as other bishops their brethren were for the first three hundred yeares persecuted by heathen emperours and did afterwards remain in subjection to them when turned christians
that it was the barbarous ignorance of our ancestors which gave way to the pope's ecclesiastique supremacy and consequently

to his temporal encroachments
wherefore we conceive it rational to avoid the barbarisme of our forefathers and to write after the copy of those men who were the founders of our religion and those who were its first and purest professours humbly craving leave to be no longer fool'd by offering up the wealth of our nation and the sweat of our countrymens browes in sacrifice to a three cround idol

and truly as often as think at what vast expence of treasure our nation formerly was and several others to this day are upon the account of their subjection to the roman see cannot choose but admire a certain fatality of dominion allwaies attending that proud city founded by romulus
in the daies of her senate and also of her caesars she sate crowned queen amongst the cities and emperesse over the nations from whom she received homage and tribute
when her enemies came blustering out of the north more furiously than the winds come thence she seemed indeed for a while to hang down her head to lean sadly on her elbow and to bewaile the losse of her former majesty that majesty with which she commanded the northern people to keep beyond the rhine and the danow the parthians not to passe over euphrates and the more southern african to sculke behind the monntaine atlas
but it was not long first ere she threw off her mourning weeds and cloathed her selfe again with scarlet
for by the exaltation of her bishop she quickly obtain'd and doth now enjoy

a far larger empire than ever she before had even in the most august times of her victorious caesars
do not the french germans and poles offer up their tributary devotions at her shrine not to mention that huge tract of ground all along the african shore nor the empire of pretious or prestor john or prestegan call him what you will
not to mention the east indie islands and the vast continent of china into all which places the reverence of her name hath been carried either by the portingals or by the missionary friers
doe not the countries under the castilian king both in this and the new found world alone aggrandize her modern empire beyond its greatnesse in the dayes of old let no man therefore henceforward cast it in the italian's teeth as erasmus did that he counts all other people barbarous
tis true the italians are the very dregs and reliques of goths vandals huns heruls alans gepids and lombards yet they impute barbarisme to all other nations as if whatsoever was polite and civil lay circumscribed within the narrow bounds of the alps the tyrrhene and the adriatique seas as if nothing forsooth but barbarity was tramontane
but would you know the reason why it is because they have outwitted the nations round about them as much as ever the old romans did the barbarians
and what they lost by the sword they have with advantage regain'd by their wit
which he well understood who said roma caput mundi quicquid non possidet armis relligione tenet
but god be thanked our own nation with some others have pretty

well quitted themselves of this barbarisme and when will the time come that the rest also will doe the like

when will the world rouse up her selfe and be redeemed from a slavish prostration to the shallownesse of some mens notions that great and noble soules may at length have a free entercourse or traffick for conceptions to improve the stock of humane knowledg as for those men who still call upon us to humble our understandings unto their traditions and to deny our selves in our own reasons wish they would once consider how small the tradition concerning apostolical times was when eusebius lived
he complains in the praeface to his history of the scarce knowledg which they had in his daies concerning the primitive christian affairs
what then must we expect to have who receive our information from authours since him for my part when reflect on the ages that are gone and past and the histories that are recorded of them cannot chuse but deplore the partiality and weaknesse of ecclesiastique historians who if we will not dissemble must needs be confessed to have given lame narrations of things and to abound with an infinite number of impertinent ridiculous incredible stories
insomuch that am very confident we have a farre more genuine and sincere account of those times when alexander and julius caesar lived than of those when constantine raigned and charlemaigne
the truth is after the barbarous inundations learning did so generally decay that the christians

for a long time either had no writers at all or else such as it had been as good to have none
otherwise why did they out of envy or ignorance or both bury in a profound silence the glorious proceedings of that thrice renowned saracenical empire
an empire of as wonderfull a growth and as noble actions as ever any since the creation yer we might have pardoned their foule play with the saracens had they been free and candid in their relation concerning the christian affairs
shall tell yee in those daies the christian world was overspread with an idle and ignorant generation of moncks who lay in their cels and coyned whole legends of miraculous lies wherewith to cheat the common people
or else they were observing the weather and making pretty little times upon the several seasons and tides of the yeare
but had there been any amongst them both able and willing to leave unto posterity a full and impartial account of affairs the bishops of rome would long before this have been shamed out of their delusory pranks
nor should have needed to write this treatise concerning the papal usurpations

finis

the method and contents
the scope and design of this book is to manifest the papal usurpation by reflecting on historical passages and not by logical arguments drawn either from texts of scripture or testimonies of other authours this manifestation is endeavoured two waies
first by shewing that in the primitive times the bishop of made no noise in the world nor was his supremacy at all d'camt of
in the first chapter
secondly and chiefly by shewing after what manner the pope not only arrived to a supremacy in the church in the second chapter but also confirmed himselfe in his ecclesiastical usurpation and further encroacht upon the temporal magistrate
in the third chapter
lastly in the fourth chapter a corollary is deduced from the preceeding discourse concluding with a reason why the pontificial unjust actions have not been justly discovered

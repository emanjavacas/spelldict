From taking away the lyuings and goods of the Church.
Wherein all men may plainely behold the great blessings which the Lord hath powred on all those who liberally haue bestowed on his holy Temple: And the strange punishments that haue befallen them vvhich haue done the contrarie.
Hereunto is annexed Celsus of Verona, his Dissuasiue translated into English.
[Figure: [Figure: Blazon] TANDEM SI. HONI SOIT QVI MAL PENSE To the right Honorable Sir Christopher Hatton: Lord high Chauncellor of England, Knight of the most Noble order of the Garter, and one of her Maiesties most Honorable Priuie Counsell.
SVndry times weying with my selfe (Right honorable) what small account is made of poore Schollers at this day, and howe fruitlesse their greatest labours bee: resolued with my selfe, neuer to publish any thing in print hereafter.
Yet notwithstanding after manie stormes, all mixed with vnnaturall showres, descending from the idle braine of sundrie fruitlesse wittes: seeing manie stinging Nettles amongst the sweete Roses, erecting their heades higher then all the holesome hearbes in the Garden: And that a ridiculous generation newly come ashore into the world, are not ashamed to affirme, that these stinking weeds, are those sweete lillies named by our Sauiour Christ: that they will digge vp the garden a new: that they will reforme the supperstitious braunches, of the sweete auncient welblowne Rose of England.
That they will pull downe the winepresse, and leuell the ground a new, by a new line: that they will build a new wine presse, of a new fashion, yelding new wine neuer seene or tasted by anie Christian heretofore.
After these great puffes of this fruitles wind, had resounded in mine eares, beating it selfe with such out ragious blastes against the walles of the Church that it maketh the strongest pillers thereof to quake and tremble: Though be the meanest of manie thousands this cause concerneth, yet knowing that it directly belongeth to the maintaining of true religion, and the holie worship of Almightie God, could not with bold my pen anie longer, from refuting so dangerous and damnable an opinion.
It is a greeuous thing by sinnes of infirmitie to offend Almightie God: but openly and obstinately to affirme, that palpable darkenes is cleare light: that euill is good, and good is euill: that sacrilegious deadly sinne, is godly zeale, that openly before the face of his aeternall Maiestie: Is the true inheritance of that treble woe oft denounced in the Scriptures.
This mooued me (Right honourable) in regard of mine humble dutie to your Honour, and the publike commoditie of manie Christian soules (which once tasting this sweete baite, might easilie be entised to eat vp sinne as it were bread) to forewarne all those, which shall read this plaine simple treatise, that they wash their secrete thoughts, from this most heinous sinne: which who so practiseth, with bloudie heart he offereth violent hands euen vnto the bosome of the sacred spouse of Iesu Christ.
Amongest all the creatures of this world, God hath giuen man onely an vnder standing soule adorned with sundrie heauenly vertues, of which there is none greater, none more excellent and diuine, more acceptable to God, more honorable in the sight of men, than is his holy worshippe, religiously celebrated in his holy Temple.
Ouer the which place, his care hath beene alwaies such, his eie so vigilant, his prouidence so continuall: that neither the sweet intising cups of worldly pleasure could at anie time bewitch it, nor the deuouring sword of firie persecution consume it.
But as the little ship, whilom welneere perished with the outragious tempest, at the voice of our Sauior, was presently safe in quiet calme; euen so when subtle worldlings seeke either by force or pollicie to ouerthrow the little Church of Christ: The~ the Lord stirreth vp some valiant Gedeon, some mightie Constantine, some true Christian knight, whose Name and Nature do yeeld a sweet consent to support his sauiour therewith to withstand the furie of his enimies.
Who daily seeke by new deuises, thrise fined in the fire of subtle pollicie, so to darken the cleare son of true Christianity, that the house of God may nomore bee seene, and that all the fountaines belonging to the same, in one day may be cleane dryed vp. Sith then the glistering cloud of sacrilegious zeale hath spred it selfe so larglie ouer our horizon, and so eclipsed the true radiant sunne, that in steade of the daie spring, which from an high hath visited vs with true light vnto saluation: the wiser sort doe plainlie perceiue that the houre of darkenes now hangeth ouer our heades, and that the daie of iniquitie hath alreadie dawned, in which Sathan by the secrete misterie of iniquitie, beginneth to worke those ruthfull stratagemes against the Church of Christ, which he hath bin manie yeares in deuising: cannot but write truely, that which the Clergie with the whole realme confesse plainely: That we render immortall thankes vnto Almightie God, for preseruing her most Roiall Maiestie so miraculouslie vnto this daie, giuing her a most religious heart (the mirror of all Christian princes) once and euer wholy consecrated to the maintaining of his diuine worship in his holy Temple.
From this cleare Christall fountaine of heauenlie vertue, manie siluer streames deriue there sunárie passages so happelie into the vineyarde of the that neither the flaming fury of outward enimies, nor the scorching sacrilegious zeale of domesticall dissimulation, can drie vp anie one roote planted in the same, since the peaceable reigne of her most Roial Maiestie.
Of these cleare Christall currents, haue vewed the most, and doubt not but that haue tasted of one of the best, sith in the greatest heat in sommer, it is neuer drie, in the hardest winter, not once congeled, in the greatest tempest, alwaies calme, in the greatest distresse, it yeeldeth iuice of sweetest comfort.
Herewith oftentimes being well refreshed: when looke backe, and in my selfe beholde the great comfort which both our vniuersities dailie receiue from your honour: account it one of the most speciall blessings of the Lord, that in his great wisedome he hath reserued your Honor vnto these daies, wherein Sathan streacheth al the strings of his wit, reuiueth all his pollicies, practiseth all his treacheries, against the poore distressed Church of Iesus Christ.
He vseth force by forraine enimies abrode, and secrete vndermining, by smoth dissemblers at home.
Herewith hee hath displaied his banner before the gates, giuen a special su~mons to the temple it self. malis, Sed contrà audentior ito.
Let the Lords knights now arme themselues, with true Christian courage.
Let them gird there sword vpon their thigh, let the~ awake with the worthie Samson, and aduenture the battaile with Iulius Caesar, who where the greatest danger was, there in person he would giue the first charge: Non est nisi in summis victoria, In greatest dangers, true vertue atchieueth the greatest victorie.
And surely if we behold the poore innocent Church all naked in the midst of hir armed enimies, daily wou~ded by some, betraed by others, co~temned of the most.
If we looke into the world see the smal comfort which poore schollers haue commonly when they come abrode, the counterfeit curtesie, the seeming friendship, the smiling looks, the double words the single deedes, the smoth promises, the doubtfull denials: We cannot but confesse, that hee which in this vncertainty continueth a certaine asure Patron, Arduam virtutis calcauit viam, sed tamen gloriosam: He hath entred the hard way of perfect vertue, but yet that which leadeth, vnto true honor.
He which with the light of heauenly wisedome, and the true integrite of a right noble heart, hath entred this way, at no time diuerting out of the same ether by flatterie of fauning friends, or feare of priuie nipping enimies, or by double danger proceeding from the~ both: He it is whom God loueth, whome the better sort doe striue to imitate, whose memorie the posteritie shal celebrate, for whom we dailie pray, and whom honor with my hart.
In this perfect resolution, haue presumed to dedicate this my Dissuasiue vnto your Honour, at this day a most assured friend to the church of Christ, a special benefactor to our Vniuersitie, and my most honorable singuler good Patron, who~ desire to gratifie in the best manner can deuise.
Which haue done the rather, to shew my duetie to the common vveale, and the sincere affection vvich beare to your most rare vertue: assuring my selfe, that you will take it in good part, as from him which without all flatterie and with intire affection, doth beseech your creator to bestow that vpon you, vvhich your most honourable heart doth desire.
IF my pen (Gentle Reader) had erst bin dipped in the siluer streames flowing from Parnassus hill, or that Apollo with his sweet sounding harp would vouchsafe to direct the passage thereof vnto the top of that high Olympus: after so general a view of great varietie and neere, might bouldly begin with that most excellent Poet Cicelides Muse paulo maiora canamus.
But sith finde it true in this my simple state of life, now wel nere spent, which the father said vnto his sonne, affecting his goulden tressed chariot drawe~ with breathing horses through the christall skies: Magna petis Phaeton quae non viribus istis, munera conueniunt: feare to flie so high a pitch, leaue the loftie discourse of higher argument to those, which with the Eagles eies of perfect wit are able to behould the bright radiant Sunne of true inuention.
And sithens sometimes in giuing attentiue eare to the sweetstrains of melodious musicke, have most affected the pleasant mean: sith in the life of man the goulden mean is that sure rule, by which the wise do passe they sie seas of worldly calamities.
In a mean stile mind to record to you a true Christian argument, which though in these daies it be but meanly regarded of the most: yet it is and alwaies hath bin had in great honor with the highest, the greatest mightiest Princes in the world.
And what is that meane that soundeth so high? If you wil listen, the note is sweete, and the dittie resoundeth the little Church of Iesu Christ.
Though my musike bee verie simple, and not practised in the art, though the song bee plaine truth, and the Echoe thereof most vsually odium parit: yet sith naked truth by her owne meere strength preuaileth against all the armies, and armed men of the world, sith her simplicitie is not able to bee refuted by the finest wittes and most eloquent tongues, am bould to sound my slender oten pipe amongest Mineruaes muses, and therewith to gratifie you with Celsus of Verona his dissuasiue, plainly translated into our English tongue.
The truth whereof incited me in simple stile, no lesse effectuallie to record the good blessings of the Lord powred on those which loue his church, than Celsus hath done to the contrarie.
Considering that these be those euil daies foreshewed by the Apostle, of which it was said, charitie, shall wax cold, and that the generall flow of iniquitie ouer the face of the whole earth doth argue vnto vs the dauning of the latter daie: For our soules health thought it expedient to shew vnto those which shall read this rudely written treatise, how daungerous a thing it is in the sight of God, how loath some in the eies of all true christians to detract any thing from the true worship of God, his holy temple, and the reuerend fathers the true disposers of the sacred mysteries in the same.
In which discourse though in the eares of some, may seeme to sing the treble rather than the meane, to nisse the moode, and to mistake the figure, and therewith to sound some sharps insteed of flattes: yet in that my purpose is to profit the good, and so little as may to offend the euill, hope (God willing) to shewe the truth so plainely, so briefly, and so truely, as that the well disposed may vouchsafe to read, and the euill may desire to learne.
To the end that this little fountaine might flow more abundantlie, and therewith deriue it selfe into diuers passages: ment before this to haue published the same, indifferentlie to all.
But afterwards considering the simple plainnes of the same scarce worthie the reading of the learned: (on good cause hauing halfe vowed neuer to publish any thing hereafter) thought it good rather to present my friend with it, as a priuate token of my goodwill, then by publishing it, to make my selfe a marke for such boults, as in this case vsually flie abroad.
Hauing sometimes walked this waye heeretofore, finde that Poeticall prouerbe most true, pronounced by that anncient Alceus: [undefined span alphabet]: vnder euery stone there lieth a Serpent.
If the enuious toong were but as the winde which changeth often, or as the sting of the little Bee whose greatest swellings are easily asswaged with the annointing of sweet honey.
Then might aduenture my little boate into the wide Ocean seas: and crie alowd with old Anchises: Vela date ventis.
But sith the venimous tong more mortal then the Cockatrice, empoisoneth farther then eye can see, infesting the absent with deadly disgrace: heereafter, Spes fortuna valete, shall be my song, and [undefined span alphabet] my full conclusion.
THE exiled Poet in the sorrowfull distresse of his banishment (gentle Reader, hauing penned the record of the same, and now readie to send it into the citie, Parue nec inuidio, sine me liber ibis in vrbem: My litle booke (saith he) do not enuie thee, that thou shalt freelie passe thither, whither cannot come.
Sith the Poets shadowed stile, resembleth perfect truth oft richlie clothed in their golden verse, sith they had wit at will, and the Muses sounded at their call; their pen did flow with droppes distilled from the fountaine of most pleasant inuention: their stile was high, their words were sweete; their sentence true, their number perfect, their workes admired.
So that nought but enuie, durst once deuise the least disgrace against the same.
If my skill would yeeld me but a bare resemblance of their perfect stile, whereby might reueale the truth vnto the world, with like delight, as did those Poets fine: or if this age were but halfe so much delighted, with the substance of truth it selfe, as they were with the portraiture of the shadow.
would hope for that good acceptance of this smal simple worke, (which now doubt) write with him: am sorie for my selfe sith thou shalt be accepted.
But sith that daie of darkenes hath alreadie dawned, in which if wee write the truth plainlie, wee are hated, if wee write obscurelie, we are suspected, if we write simplie, we are contemned, if we write not to please the itching eares of flesh and bloud, we are reiected.
Sith men are so much bent to their owne selfe will, and so besotted with the loue of themselues, of their owne house, their owne goods, their owne landes, their owne wife, their owne children, their owne posteritie, lastlie with the loue of this present world, of dignities, honors, scepters kingdomes, that the kingdome of heauen to them is but a dreame, bred in a litle corner of their secret cogitation: and he which shall tell them, that the kingdome of this world passeth away, like a flower, a clowde, a smoke, a shadowe, that the kingdome of Christ is not of this world, that the further wee enter into worldlie possessions, and the higher wee climbe vnto honor, the further wee goe backe from the kingdome of heauen, and the greater is our fall into the graue, sith hee which shall write this plainlie, and more than that, that the whole regiment of a Christian common wealth, ought principally, aboue all things to serue for the setting forth of true religion, the true worship, the true honour of the name of God: sith the disgrace of worldlie pride now commonlie receiued, and on the contrarie, the extolling and magnifying of the beautie of the temple of God, is an odious thing amongest worldlinges at this day, and my skill verie simple, mine inuention slender, my treatise, rude, my words plaine, mine eloquence nothing at all: begin with him though to another ende, Parue nec inuideo: My litle booke do not enuie thee, nay, rather pittie thine estate, sith thou art now to passe into the world, whose ysie wayes are opposite to God, and crauest attentiue eare of those, whose fowle deformities thou openlie displaiest.
Nether would thinke thy destinie so hard, or so much to be lame~ted, if they were simple at whose harts thou knockest (willing them to reuerence the worshippe of God, more than the lawes of earthlie princes) or easilie to bee recouered from the bewitched waies of this present world.
But of them manie are high and honourable, manie wife and learned, manie politique, strong, and wealthie, hardlie bowing downe their eie to behold the low estate of the humble, and seldome opening their eare to the crie of poore fatherlesse lying in the streete, or to so plaine, so simple, so vnsauerie a speach, as thou seemest willing to vtter in their eares at this time.
In this dispair of thy good successe, heare an other trumpet sownd, whose lowde alarum biddeth thee either retire, or else to chaunge thine habite, thy countenance, thy simple stile and cote, wherewith thou art now clothed.
The solemne courtes of princes haue their Porters, to keepe such base coats out: who if they once presume to speake, beeing controlled, then the staffe, the rodde, the whippe, the stockes, do make the period of their stile.
These be the stormes, wilt thou shrink for showers of raine? God it is which fashioned the globe of the golden tressed sun, he raiseth cloudes and discusseth them againe, he thundreth lowd, and sendeth quiet calme, he sendeth grieuous stinges of the bodie, oft times to his beloued, that he may reioyce his soule, with the beautie of his countenaunce.
Ille meas errare boues vt cernes ipsum: Ludere quae vellem, calamo permisit agresti: he first sent foorth the piersing beame of cleare light, he opened mine eye, hee bowed the fingers of mine hand, and bid me write, that in this age we seeme and are not, holie, learned, wise, charitable, louing and kinde one to an other.
If this bee the generall course of the world, foreshewed long sithence by reuealed Prophesie: let no man thinke that trueth proceedes from any euill humor: or that this heauenlie darte (which spareth none) dooth aime at him, or her, or any one: but humblie requesting all in the bowels and mercies of Iesu Christ, specially to looke to the saluation of their owne soule, it toucheth all, that all therby leauing the loue of this present world, by his gratious crosse and passion, may be made the true children of eternal blisse.
That auncient Poet Hesiod writte many hundreth yeeres agoe, that which our liues doe porfectly fulfill [undefined span alphabet].
Whe~ the Gods mortall men began to multiplie vppon earth, the first age was a goulden age, for they were simple, plaine wise, honest, religious, long liued, deuoide of iniury, crafte, and and subtilty.
The second like to siluer, not so good as was the first: The third, brasse, more corrupt in minde, manners, and nature: sineque ego quinto interessem hominum generi: (saith the Poet) that had not come in the fift age of the world, but either had beene dead long before, or else not yet borne, sith this is an iron age, replenished with malitious crimes and mischeefe.
This was a deformed shadowe and the bodie of our age is like vnto the same, according to the exposition of Daniell vnto Nabuchodonozer, wherin he foreshewed that the images head of golde, and the breast siluer, the bellie of brasse, the legges and feete halse iron, halfe earth, signified the nature and inclination of the whole world.
Three of them be past, and seldome commeth the better.
Sith this in which we liue is the ende of the fourth Monarch, whose euil workes and sinful inclination is resembled to the iron mixt with earth, in steede of long life yeelding shorte, sinfull, wretched daies: in steede of sweete peace, yeelding wars and rumours of wars in all places: in steede of simplicity, yeelding double dissembling: in steede of true deuotion to the church of Iesu Christ, yeelding pilling, and polling on euery side: in steede of loue to the common wealth and our posterity, with the vnsatiable greedy worme of couetousnes, prouiding oncly for our owne mouthes, our own bellies, our owne time: in all our dooinges fully expressing the sence and sentence of that auncient Poet Pindarus [undefined span alphabet] the present commodity is euer most accepted, for the subtill age to come will alter all.
Together with this iron earthly age, the seede of corruption is daily sowne, whose blossomes nowe already put foorth, though they shine cleere and bright, as dooth the cockle amiddest the wheate: yet if they once beginne to reape, to threshe, to grinde, to grinde, to bake, to eate, they shall soone perceiue, that there is cockle amongest the corne, and ofte times vnder the painted viserd of great knowledge, you shall se blind bayard wax so bold, that through many wordes and often speaking amongest the ignorant (whose eyes dazell in beholding such painted sepulchers) hee is reputed for wise and learned.
In hoc ferreo postremoque saeculo, non nisi faeces artium superesse videmus, etsi non nulli putent eas maxime vigere, propter sermonis ornatum.
In this last iron age, we haue but the of artes and sciences, although manie thinke, that learning florisheth more nowe, then in times past, because we talke more then they did, and that more cunninglie, more smoothlie, more courtlie.
Which great absurditie of this our age, throughly mixt with earth iron, to the great perill and daunger of many thousand soules, mooued mee first, to penne this rudely written treatise, in the behalfe of the Church of Iesu Christ, and the soules health of all true Christians, vnto whose handes it shal come.
Which secret cogitation taking effect by outward sence, and shewing to my bodilie eyes in sundrie places, and manie solemne foundations nowe made desolate (whereby manie thousandes of learned pastours might haue beene maintained for the preaching of the Gospell of Christ and the dailie praysing of his name, credidi propterea loquutus sum, with the holie Prophet and Apostle, beleeued and therefore writte that which the holy scriptures, the holy counselles, the holy fathers haue plainelie affirmed.
When looked backe and considered, what wee are, and what wee ought to bee: what wee haue doone: and what we ought to haue doone: the truth piersed my spirite, my heart rent, and my ioyntes did cleaue in sunder: the passion of that sight beganne to worke, the fyer was kindled within, the sayinges of the holie fathers ministred oyle, wherewith the flame brake foorth at my mouth, crying alowde: for Sions sake will not hold my peace.
Here with returning to the mirrour of trueth, the holie word of God, whereby all our thoughtes, wordes, and workes are to bee tried: and furthermore perusing the holie fathers (by the assistaunce of the holie Ghost openers of the true vnderstanding thereof;) meant to gather some store of testimonies out of them, to witnesse with mee, that this my affirmation in this matter, is a certaine and vndoubted trueth.
Hauing behelde this radiant sunne of light the word of God, and the little starres the holie fathers illuminated with the cleare beames thereof, though the trueth appeared plainelie in them both, yet their testimonies concerning thinges once dedicated to holie vse, seemed to mee neither so manie as expected, nor so plaine.
Herein hauing made some spence of time in seeking that which was not so plainely figured in the fathers as hoped, and as it was truely meant: at length the trueth of that conclusion offered it selfe, most plainelie to my cogitation, which was: that as that auncient Solon, hauing made many excellent lawes amongest the Athenians, hee made no lawe neither set hee downe any punishment, for him which should kil his own father, supposing that the earth would neuer nourishe so wicked a creature.
Euen so it is truely supposed, that those holie fathers liuing in the siluer age of olde antiquitie, did neuer imagine that out of this earthlie yron age of ours, there should spring anie so barbarous, so cruell, so wicked, that would attempt to take awaie any thing from the true worshippe of almightie God.
Which suppositio~ least in some mens sight, it should seeme to want true position and sure ground, let vs turne our minds a litle from carnal cogitations of worldlie minded men: which thinke of necessitie the course of the world must bee mainteined, howsoeuer the seruice of God be neglected, and his holie temple, your mindes thus turned cleane away from wordlie vanities (which in one minute shall all vanish and consume, like the paper cast into the fier) turne your eies and behold the booke of life, therewith conferre the expositions of holie councels and ancient fathers, expounding the true sence of the same, and you shall see most plainlie, that things once dedicated to holie vse, are not in anie wise to bee altered, vnleast it be in extreame necessitie, the braunches whereof are plainlie laied open by that holie father Saint Ambrose in these wordes: Vasa ecclesiae initiata, in his tribus confringere, conflare vendere etiam licet, primum, vt extremae pauperum egestati succurratur &c.
In these three cases it is lawfull to breake, to melt, to sel the vessels of the Church; first for the relieuing of the poore; secondlie, for the redeeming of the Christians beeing captiues to infidels.
Thirdlie, for the preseruing of the Church, christian buriall of the dead, these extremities make that irreligious fact sometimes lawfull, as appeareth, (though verie seldome) in the practise of the primatiue Church: according to that which Sozomene writeth in the fourth booke of his ecclesiasticall storie, the
Saith hee, when the people of Ierusalem wanted meat, and were all readie to perish through the great famine, which was amongest them, Cyrillus the Bishoppe of the citie, solde the treasure of the Church with all the costlie clothes belonging to the same, distributing to the poore, according to their necessitie.
First of all the goods of the Church, being dulie and dutifullie bestowed on the worshippe of God, and diuine function, the true proper and principall vse and end of the same.
Secondly in extreame necessitie: this is a good lawfull, and also a holie vse of them, and scarcelie to be called of the Church goods, sith the poore are belonging to the same: according to that generall sentence of all the councels and fathers, Bona ecclesiae sunt bona pauperum: the goods of the church are the goods of the poore.
But to take awaie the landes and goods of the Church, whereby the beautiful feete of those, which bring the glad tydings of the Gospel are shed, their sides clothed, their bodies fed, and numbers of those which dailie praie in his holy temple, are or ought to be mainteined, lifting vp pure hands with hartie prayers for the sinnes of the people: and those also which dailie sing praises to his holie name, for his wonderful mercies shewed to mankind: no scripture, no councel, no father, no writer, no religio~ whatsoeuer doth allow it.
If wee looke into the law of nature, or the rules of humanitie, not much dissonant from the conclusions, of morall philosophie, we shall see plainly, that those creatures which receaue the greatest portion of blessing, they render the most againe, not once retracting the former yeilde.
The fields for one pore graine receaued, send forth manie scores againe.
The fishes multiplie in all the coastes of the wide Ocean seas: the beastes their young, the Bees their honey, the sheepe their lambe, their wool, their skin: the litle poore larke, shee mounteth vp into the clowds with a sweet song· which solaceth thee, either riding by the waie, or plowing in the field, or sitting in thine howse at home.
All creatures by kinde yeeld giftes of thankefull grace vnto the Lorde, not once retracting anie thing againe.
And shall onely sinfull man bee founde vnthankfull vnto his maker? The Lord of his meere mercie, without al merite hath giuen him all the beastes of the field, the fowles of the aier, the fishes of the sea vnder his dominion, he hath giuen him an vnderstanding soule, made him steward of his housholde.
Nay when through disobedience to his maker, hee had cast himselfe cleane out of dores: our sauiour Christ hee came downe from heauen for his sake, hee appeared in the habite of a man, hee was counted vile, dispited, and hated, threatned, betraied, martired, euen to the sheading of his most pretious bloud on the crosse for sinful man.
Neither did his louing kindnes cease with the time, for hee left his houshold behinde him his catholique Church and his holie spirite to gouerne and guide it, to comfort man, to instruct him, to support him against all his enemies; dailie hourelie holding the strings of his heart in his hand, and preseruing the breath in his nostrelles, least he should vanish from the face of the earth.
These bee the manifold mercies of the Lord towardes man, more than to all other creatures: and shal sinful man be more vnthankfull to his maker than the rest? shal man onelie of al other creatures take away from the Lord that which is once giuen? shal the hart of man waxe hard against bis creator, that hee should once thinke ther may be too much giuen to God? or forbid any man against the commaundement of Christ to giue al that he hath to the poore distressed members of his church? Naie shall not sinfull man rather inuent in his hart, write with his pen, pronou~ce with his vocie, statutes, lawes, and commissions, to the ende that the whole frame of the common wealth, especiallie before all other matters whatsoeuer be directed and wholie bent to the glorie of God, the worshippe of his holie name, the highest point whereof consisteth in mainteining of his holie Temple, the house and place of his true worshippe here on earth? Naie, shall the beastlie hart of that prowde Nabuchodonozer bee placed in the bodie of anie Christian, that hee should lay wast the Temples of the Lord? or that dronken minde of king Balthasar, that he should take to his owne vse the goods of the Church? that hee should dissolue the Quire of sweete voices praising the Lord in the Citie, and bestowe the foundation thereof on a kennell of houndes crying in the woods.
If the king call shal we not all runne? and if the kinglie prophet Dauid bid vs bring vnto the Lorde, shall we waxe hardharted in taking away that which wee neuer gaue? If the heathen people through the instinct of heauenlie light, secretlie written by the finger of God in the centre of their heart, trembled at the entrance of the temples of the Christians, and were afraid to touch any thing therein (as we reade in sundry histories) shall not the true Christian vtterly abhorre from the same, if not for loue (in regard of the te~der mercies of Iesu Christ bestowed on him) yet for feare of those extreame and extraordinarie punishments, that hee speedilie powreth vppon all those which spoile his temples? ye kinges and rulers of the earth, be wise; count not of this crowne of molten mettall, which weieth heauy on your heade, and presseth you downe to the earth: but cast down your crownes before the lambe of God, which taketh away the sins of the worlde: despise your kingdomes and glorious roialties, learne to serue him with a perfect loue of eternall blisle, and perfect loathing of these tedious earthly kingdomes: striue to finde the narrow gate, cast away your iewels heauie ornaments, runne, runne: runne on a pace, run swiftly, that ye may attaine that crowne, which will lift you vp both body and soule aboue all the kingdomes of the world, nay farre aboue all heauens, euen vnto eternall life.
That you may more readilie enter, this race of a true Christian, and more happilie attaine the true perfection of the same, first forsake the worlde and all the loue thereof, cast away your worldlie delightes, and secret inclination, denie your selues, count not of that flattering constancie, whose ende is dolefull miserie.
Hauing reiected this worldlie habite, together with thy fleshlie delightes, let the troubled waie of fickle fancie goe, and there with entering further, the first degree of heauenly meditation, weigh wisely with thy selfe and consider, what God is, and what thou art, and thou shalt see plainely, that who so is without him, or out of his fauour, hee is nothing, or at the most a verie vile and an euill thing.
The great desire of the kinges of the earth is long and prosperous reigne.
Which who so hath enioied long in the court, let him but walke out a little into the pleasant woodes, and hee shall heare the auncient Poet Symonides, sounding that truth in his sweete songe: [undefined span alphabet] &c. a thousand and tenne thousand yeares in respect of eternitie are but a minute, or rather the least portion of a minute.
Sith all is nothing vnto him, and hee is one in one eternitie, from which vnitie all creatures haue their integritie, let vs learne as little children doe by
the eternall, the incomprehensible, the first and simple vnitie in trinitie, from which all thinges haue their rising by proportion of number: knowing that, as hee is the and so the first and the last loue of our heart, the first and the last honour which wee can deuise, the first and the last fruites of the labours of our bodie, must bee giuen vnto him: and in such maner, that beeing once giuen vnto him, it is the first and the last, neuer to bee reuoked againe, no not to bee desired in minde and secrete cogitation, but there to rest and remaine as in the first and last conclusion, for which it was ordained.
If anie worldly minded man seeme to doubt the truth hereof, will not produce this course begun, from the misticall principles of secret philosophie, least with the clowdes of reason, should obscure the cleare light of heauenlie truth, and hide it from the simple, whose good successe in the schoole of Christ most of all desire.
The expresse rule of Iustice, right and equitie, is the will of God; by which, what is right or wrong is to bee examined.
Who then is of the councell of the Lorde, or to whome is his will knowne? Aristotle that excellent philosopher saith, that the cogitations of the hart be plainlie knowne by the woordes of the mouth, sith the voice is the interpretour of the minde, and (as our sauiour Christ saith) out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh: by which inferiour rule of reasonable philosophie, wee may climbe vp to that true conclusion in diuinitie, that the Lordes will is reuealed in his worde.
And is there anie mention thereof in holie scriptures? Come and see; turne the booke and read the twentie seuenth chapter of Leuiticus, where it is thus written, plainelie, shortlie, and truelie; Omne quod domino consecratur &c. what thing soeuer is consecrated vnto the Lord, bee it man, beast, or field, it cannot bee solde or reuoked againe, because whatsoeuer is once dedicato God, is holie of holiest vnto the Lorde.
Man is not like vnto the meere vegitable creatures, the flowers of the garden, or the lillies of the fielde, that hee shoulde growe and goe forward, vntill hee come to such a degree of ripenesse, and then to wither and decaie: neither is the Lordes temple, or his holie worshippe, as the earthlie fielde, whose seede dooth growe and straight decaieth againe: but to man it is appointed, that from the beginning of his daies vnto the ende thereof, he shoulde first and last seeke the kingdome of heauen, and the righteoufnesse thereof.
In which course, who so hath begunne, let him knowe, that not to goe forward, is to goe backewarde, and what is that? Hee which is the waie, the truth, and the life, hee hath shewed it vs, saying: Estote sancti, quoniam ego sanctus sum, bee ye holy, because am holie.
In what manner? not in hearing, but in dooing the will of God; not in talking, but in walking; as it is written: not the speakers but the dooers of the lawe shall bee iustified: as also another scripture: Regnum Dei, non est in sermone, sed in virtute: the kingdome of God is not in woordes, but in vertuous and holie life: not in criyng Lord, Lord, but in doing the wil of God which is in heauen: not in looking for a mansion place, or building pompous pallaces heere on earth (whose greatest ioyes be a shining miserie) but in hastening forwards towards the kingdom of heauen, in giuing our goods, our lands, our bodies and soules vnto the Lorde.
Our goodes to feede the poore, to cloth the naked, to co~fort the sick, &c.
Our lands to the maintaining of his temple, wherin his word is daily preached, his name praised, the poore commonly harbored.
Our bodies to the prison, the lyon, the sworde, the fire, for his names sake: all which is the true christian, and acceptable yeelding our soules into the handes of our almightie creatour, our merciful redeemer, our heauenlie comforter.
This is the olde christian way to the kingdome of heauen through the armies of pleasures, of temptations, of dangers of punishments, of the spiritual powers of this world: which who so refuseth, hoping to saue his life, he shall loose it, and who so looseth it, shall finde that place, vbi vere the true life of eternall blisse for euer.
Who so grudgeth to giue a peece of vile pelting, earthlie land, to the Church of God, or taketh ought therefro, or esteemeth more of goods, lands, friends, rumors, fame, credit, kindred, bretheren, sisters, father or mother, or his owne life, than of the glorie of God, of the welfare of his beloued spowse the holie Church, hee is not worthie of the kingdome of heauen, neither hath his foot troden the first step of the way of life.
If this be thus, then what manner of men ought we to be in holines of life, in studying daylie by all meanes possible, how to gratify the Lord of life: If he reward the charitable bestowing of a cuppe of could water on his disciples, when they thirst: how highlie is he displeased with those, who ether diminish or take away the maintenance of his holie Temples, where his name dwelleth? In this respect (gentle Reader) consider that as Dauid said concerning his sonne now dead: shall goe to him, but he shall not come againe to mee; so wee must thinke of goods once giuen to the holie worshippe of the Lord, for so it is: wee must goe to them, and that often, euen to the holie Temple, but they must not bee brought backe againe to vs.
This is one true plaine christian way, leading to one perfect ende, according to that saying of Bachilides [undefined span alphabet], &c. there is but one waie for mortall men to attaine happinesse, and one ende thereof: to this agreeth our due and dutifull consideration of the Lords worshippe and his holie will, which is that his glorie should be onely, and wholy to himselfe, as it is written: gloriam meam alteri non dabo, will not giue my glorie to an other.
The truth of this conclusion telleth vs, that we must serue him onely, not onely first, but him onelie.
Which if we did ponder wisely with our selues, and thereunto frame our liues and daily dooinges, wee would not take the squared stones of the temple, to builde our pompous pallaces withall, but we would rather remember that olde saying: accursed is that house, which hath any stone in it, belonging to the church.
We would not chang the names of church landes, and call them by our owne names, our lordships, our lands our mannours.
We would not eate the bread of the poore, nor drinke the teares which trickle downe the cheekes of the widdow, nor contemne the simple estate of the ministers, by whose landes and liuinges we are now fatted like the buls of Basan.
If we would but once enter into our owne conscience, plainly and truelie remembring, whose goods they are that we possesse, and lift vp our eye to the heauens, to the which both we and they are dedicated, wee would soone loath that which wee haue looued, our hart would quake thorow the bitter sting of conscience, and sinne would cleane couer our faces with the mantle of darke and deadlie despaire, sith wee haue spoiled, robbed, contemned him, whose loouing countenaunce is our eternall Saluation.
Herewith remembring the bitter sequele, and deadlie sting of sinnes committed against God himselfe, losse of goods landes, contrarie to all expectation, sodaine fiers in one hower, destroying house, goods, and all the treasure which thou hast wickedlie heaped together many yeeres: barrennesse of wombe, sith thou hast trauelled all thy life long for goodly lands, and hast no children to enioy them, or if thou haue, theyr sodaine death before thine eyes: and lastlie, the restlesse paine, and eternall miserie of hell fire, purchased with so manie cares and troubles, with so much wealth of this world: wee ought to wash our handes with Pylate, and not onely to saie as hee said, am free from this innocent bloud: but both in woord and deede, to keepe our prophane handes, from the violating of holie thinges.
That holie father Saint Augustine hee affirmeth, that God is a cleere eye, and seeth euerie where, much more hee beholdeth all the corners of his owne house, and the footsteppes of those which spoyle his temple before his face.
Which who so, rudelie, rashly, and irreligiously presumeth at any time to attempt, let him consider, that he doth it against the Lord openlie before his own face, and therwith let him know, that he is a ielous God, visiting the sinnes of the fathers vpon the children, to the third and fourth generation of all which hate him, sith he is God, yesterday, to day, and for euer: as also all thinges are which are once consecrated to his holie worship.
vnderstand that by the course of lawe, inheritaunce descendeth to the next of the bloud, and for want of heirs in the second, third, or fourth generation of the eldest, it commeth backe to the younger brothers issue and posterity: of which if all fayle, and at length by intailement or otherwise by lawe, if it commeth into the possession of the King, it neuer goeth backe.
If this bee the prerogatiue of goods, giuen to earthly Princes, which are here to daye and to morrowe lye rotting in the graue, let vs not denie the same to the Lord of Lordes, the King of Kinges, the creatour of heauen and earth, into whose house whatsoeuer is incorporated, though conscience and religion dare not speake therein, yet let the heathen Poet open his mouth and make the period [undefined span alphabet], that which is once doone, cannot bee vndoone againe.
If this constancie was alwaies kept betwixt man and man: how much more betwixt God man? betwixt his Church, his Prests, his spirituall Pastours, and the men of this world, whose parentes and instructurs they are, according to that saying of Micha vnto the Leuit: remaine with me and be my father and my Priest, and the tribe of Dan also to the same Leuit: houlde thy peace and come with vs, for thou shalt be our father and our Priest.
Sithe then by the secreet instinct of nature, and also by the expresse commaundement of God, wee are commaunded to honour our father and mother, to obey and cherishe them in all wee canne: by the same lawe wee are vtterlie forbidden, to to detract or take any thing away from them.
And if any hard harted christian vnder the colour of dissembled zeale, seeme to open away herein, to his sacrilegious couetous minde, saying that these commaundements of our Lord, are meant concerning our naturall father and mother: let him and all men knowe, that the holie fathers expounding this commaundement, affirme first that it concerneth our honour to our spirituall father, and the Church our spirituall mother: secondly it commaundeth vs to nourish and obey al superiours, magistrates, and ministers, amongest whom are contained our naturall parentes.
But suppose that were obscure and doubtfull, which is as plaine and cleare as the noone daie, yet canst thou doubt what the will of God and the rule of right is in this case, wherein the Lord hath spoken plainely as it is shewed before in these wordes, whatsoeuer is once dedicated to God shall neuer be sould or redeemed? As is the fountaine, so are all the little brookes running from the same.
This is the lawe of the Lord concerning thinges dedicated to his holy worshippe: and the liues of the holy Patriaches, the Prophets, the Apostles, the the fathers, doo cleerely expresse the same.
Ioseph the true figure, of our Lord and sauiour Iesu Christ, in that great famine of Aegipt, when hee had bought almost the whole land, and brought it into the Kings hand, he would not once offer any money for the priestes landes, but in that their great want, gaue them nourishment of the Kings store, according to that rule of the Lord: the suburbes of the Priests shall not be sould, for the possession of them is eternall without redemption.
God is our heauenly father he hath sowed the eternall seede of his exceeding looue in our hearts to the ende he might receiue from vs the same, euen looue for looue, because such as hee soweth, such will he reape.
Can we say that we loue our spirituall father, and therewith spoile his louing spouse our spirituall mother the holie Church? castinge downe her walles, banishing her eldest children? possessing her landes, goods, and treasure, which is an odious crime in the sight of God and man? according to that saying of Saint Ambrose: si quis in sua: if any man presume to take the treasures of the Church to his priuate vse, it is a great crime.
Wherin, least he should seeme to abridge the spirituall pastours of the Church, for whose sustenaunce they were first giuen, hee expoundeth himselfe in these wordes: Templum domini laicis tradi non debet: the temple of the Lord ought not to be giuen into lay mens handes: that wee must giue vnto Caesar, those thinges which bee Caesars, and vnto God those thinges that bee Gods.
Amongest the heathen Philosophers it was cou~ted the first point of iustice, to giue to euerie man his owne: and least amongst christians anie in time should prooue so barbarous, and vtterly voide of grace, that hee should laie violent handes, on the goods of poore innocents which cannot speake, euen the temples of the Lord, dedicated to the worshippe of his holie name, besides the expresse commaundement of the Lord in holy scriptures, the holy fathers and councels haue pronounced it a cursed thing, as the cleare bage of him, which hath renounced heauen, and taken himselfe wholy to serue this wicked world and the vanities thereof.
The councell of Gangrene celebrated the yeere of our Lord
or there about, according to the Cannons of the Apostles, decreed in this manner: If any man shall presume to take any thing once offered to God, vnleast it bee the Bishop or his deputie appointed for the distributing of the Church goods to the poore, let him be accursed.
In like manner also the third councell of Rome: If any man couet or take away any reuenews belonging to the Church, or if any of the Priestes consent there to: let them be accursed.
The reason followeth in the fift councel alleadged in this manner: for it is a great iniurie and an vntollerable sacriledge, that what so euer any man bestoweth on the church of Christ, should be altered or translated to any other vse, especially by those men, who of all other ought to maintaine the Church, as be christian Kings, Princes, and Prelates.
Furthermore, that it might be manifest to all those, which dutifully embrace and reuerence the spouse of Iesu Christ, howe wicked an enterprise it is, and what manifest daunger to the soules of all them, which shall presume heerein, the same Councell hath foreseene the daunger and set downe the sentence of eternall trueth in these wordes.
Hee which shall not wiselie foresee this euident daunger of eternall damnarion to his owne soule, and contrarie to this sentence, take awaie the goods and possessions once giuen to the Church, or vniustlye deteyne the same, vnlesse hee make present restitution to the church so soone as he can, let him be strucken with the curse, which the wrathfull iudge of all the world, shall inflict on all the soules of the wicked at the day of doome, and let these goods bee a curse to him which gaue them from the Church, which receaued them, and which possessed them.
Neither let him finde anye protection for his crime, before the tribunall seate of Iesu Christ, because without all feare of God, and regard of his holie worshippe, against lawe and right, hee hath taken awaie the goods of the Church giuen to maintaine the holie worship of the Lord, and to feede the hungrie bodies and soules of the poore innocent people.
Generallie saith the same Councell, whosoeuer, shall presume to confiscate, to spoyle, or to take anie thing consecrated, to holie vse, or belonging to the Church, vnlesse hee truelie repenting correct and amend his wicked facte, so soone as hee can, and that by restitution to the same Church, let him bee subiect to the greeuous curse and censure of the Church.
Likewise those which enter on the goods of the Church, and detaine them through the gifte, the authoritie, the commission of Kinges, and Princes, obtaining them by tirannicall force from the Church, leauing them to theyr heyres and posteritie as though they were theyr owne inheritaunce, vnlesse with speedie repentaunce they restore the Lords possession vnto his Church being first admonished by the holy Bishop, let him be accursed for euer, and accounted as an infidell, according to that commandement of our sauiour Christ: if he will not heare the Church, let him be to thee as an heathen, or as an infidell, therefore (saith the councell) it is not lawfull for the Emperour or anie true christian, to attempt anie thing contrarie to the commaundementes of God, neither to doe anie thing repugnant to the rules of the holy Prophets, the Apostles and Euangelists.
Those which bee my sheepe, saith our Sauiour Christ they heare my voice, and those which be naturall children of the Church, their hart will melte when they heare the voice of their mother, crying in the streetes.
Our heauenly father he hath begotten vs in the spirite, and our spirituall mother, shee nourisheth vs, with the sweete milke of the word of life.
Shee vttereth her voyce often, and cryeth alowde in many places of the world, but neuer so manifestly as when shee sheweth her countenaunce openlie to all the world, in open generall councell, gathered together in the holie Ghost.
You haue heard her voyce whileare, and the sound thereof hath gone into all landes saying: touch not mine annointed, neither anie thing once dedicated to my holie worship.
Sponsus sponsam amat: the bridegroome doth loue his spouse intirely.
Hee sheweth her his brest, and reuealeth to her the secrets of his hart, his wil is apparant vnto her, she hath reuealed it at sundry times vnto her children.
Which times though they were diuers yet veritatis simplex est oratio: her voice was is alwaies the same, as appeareth by the councell of Aurialens, whose wordes though they differre from the former, yet the sence and sentence is the same: first forewarning her eldest children of this grieuous sinne, and then the other in their order, after this manner: Let no Clarke or spirituall pastour, alienate any goodes belonging to the Church: and least it should seeme true which some obiect, that those which giue to the Church, may also take away: the same councel doth meete with that obiection in the
chapter in these wordes: It is not lawfull for him which giueth anie thing to the Church, or for his heires, once for to require it backe again.
In like maner the second councell of Spale: Those Churches which by tumultes and warres haue beene disturbed, shal altogether retaine the selfe same liberties, which they had before, with all the possessions, whether they bee possessed by any other Church, or any others whatsoeuer.
The first councell of Paris hath giuen this resolute iudgement concerning Bishops goodes, and therein the goods of the Church, because the goods and possessions of Bishops, are knowne to be the goods and possessions of the Church.
If any man shall violently intrude himselfe into them, or by violence peruert them, let him bee stroken with the curse of the holie Canon, that he which would not followe the motion of his owne conscience, at the least maye bee reclaimed by the holie constitutions of the Church.
Which offence least it shold seeme a smal sinne in the eyes of worldlye men, or that the gaine gotten thereby, might seeme to counteruaile the losse; no man is so simple which seeth not plainely, that this is a pleasaunt sinnefull thought, leading to a bitter end, as appeareth by the sentence of the same councell following.
Let no man be so farre from the seeking of his owne soules health, or so willing to seeke eternall death, that he should once desire, enter, or possesse any goods, landes or commodities belonging to the church.
Though the councell of Magnutium seeme in the beginning by gentle words to mittigate the haynousnesse of the fact, yet indeede the meaning is the same, and in conclusion of the same weight, as appeareth by their style in this manner: If anie man doe presume to retaine, diminish or take anie goodes, landes, or profites, belonging to anie Church, Colledge, or any holie place, let him bee excommunicated as a spoyler of the Church, not once allowed to come neere the Church doore.
These milde wordes, least they should animate the wicked, they drawe a more fearefull iudgement after them, as appeareth afterward in the same councell, concluding thus; If anie man diminish any thing belonging to the Church: as a cruell murtherer of the poore, let him bee accursed for euer.
This was the voice of the mother, and her children haue learned to pronounce the same.
Saint Ambrose (as it is written before) affirmeth it vnlawfull, for temporall men to possesse ecclesiasticall goods.
Saint Augustine writing on the Psalmes saith, that when the last dedication of the house of God shall come, then shall that safetie also bee giuen vnto it: which was spoken in the seuenteenth chapter of the second booke of the Kinges, after this manner: will appoint my place of worship with my people Israell, and they shall dwell alone seperated from others: and the sonne of iniquitie shall not presume to destroy it.
The scripture calleth the spoilers of the church the sonnes of iniquitie, bicause the sonne of heauen hath not beheld a more vngodlie fact, then the iniurie of the sonne done to the mother; of the infantes to the nurse, of Christians to the Church, which is the spirituall mother of all Christians, as well rich, as poore, the mightie, as the simple, the king, as the begger, according vnto the saying of Saint Chrisostome, writing on the Gospell of Saint Mathew: Ecclesia, primorum regum est mater, The Church is the mother of the highest Princes.
Not many pages after, giuing his iudgement concerning the goodes of the Church in this sorte, those which builde tombes for the Martyrs of Christ, and adorne his temples, they do a good worke.
Thereby signifiyng, that they which deface the temples of God, and pull them downe, they commit a great and greeuous sinne in the sight of the almightie.
Paulus Diaconus, in the fourth booke de gestis longo Bardorum, recordeth, that Theodelinda that vertuous Queene built a faire Cathedrall Church, dedicating it to the name of Saint Iohn Baptist, adorning it with manye pretious iewells, ornamentes and goodlie landes, which the aforesaid Authour sayth, oughte not to bee alienated.
According vnto the sentence of Iustinian in his booke Authent.
Columna secunda, of constitutions, intituled, of not alienating or chaunging ecclesiasticall goods whatsoeuer.
All good Emperours in their lawes and constitutions, had a special care of preseruing, increasing, and safekeeping the goods of the Church: And sith Iustinians lawes were their direction, he not onelie made General statutes for the preseruation thereof, but also in his law, he affirmeth that the holie vessels and garments of the temples, ought not to be pawned, except it bee for the redeeming of captiues out of the seruitude and tirannie of infidels, nay in another place hee chargeth the Bishops, that they take not to themselues the treasure of the Church: which holesome lawes so mooued the harts of all Christian Emperours, that they bestowed verie deuoutlie and bountifully on the church commaunding straightly, that all me~ should restore vnto the same whatsoeuer had bid taken therefrom by wicked tyrantes, robbers of the Church, and spoilers of the dead, which Saint Chrisostome in his booke Defato, counteth litle lesse than manslaughter.
Hereupon Theodoricus commaunded Duke Ibba, that he should restore vnto the Church of the possessions therof, taken awaie detained from the Church by Alaricus.
And in an other epistle to Gelericus, hee commaundeth him to restore a fielde, which was alienated from the Church of Constance, and to punish the possessor thereof, in that hee presumed to take to his owne priuate vse, the possessions of the Church.
This censure was giuen without exception of anie person according to that which Turonensis writeth in the fourth booke of his Historie: certaine kinges (saith hee) haue presumed most irreligiouslie to take the goods of the church into their treasure: as did Clotharius, which made an edict, that all the Churches of his realme, should paie the third part of their fruits into his treasurie: but beeing rebuked by that holie Bishop Iniuriosus, he retracted his irreligious opinion, and that wicked fact.
Let no man beare so irreligious a minde, or so hard a hart within his breast, to thinke otherwise, than that it is a most grieuous sinne to take any thing from the holie Church, sith first it is giuen to maintaine the holie worshippe of God there.
Secondlie to feed the poore, and to bee bestowed on such like holie and vrgent necessitie, according to the which our ancient Beda writeth in the first booke of his historie, concerning this Iland, Bonorum ecclesiasticorum (saith hee) of church goods, the first part is due to the Bishop for the maintenance of hospitality: the second to the inferiour clergie, the third to the poore, the fourth to the repairing of the church: but to other, or to those which haue sufficient of themselues, the goods of the church are not to be imployed; as that learned Prosper in his treatie De vita contemplatiua witnesseth in these wordes: ecclesia nihil eis erogare debet, &c.
The church ought not to bestow any thing on those which haue sufficient of their owne.
Otherwise, though some of the Church giue it, yet it is plaine sacriledge for them which take it, as saint Ierom in his epistle to Damasus sheweth in these wordes: qui autem parentum bonis &c. Those which haue sufficient left them by their parents to maintaine them, if they take anie of those goods which are giuen to maintaine the poore, it is sacriledge.
Caluin writing on the seuenth of Amos, calleth the diminishing of the immunities or commodities of the church, sacriledge: sounding the same with good Saint Barnard writing on the Canticles, according to this tenor: Proditores dei ecclesiae, &c.
They which take from the temples, they are betraiers of God and his church.
These learned fathers, they expresse the true sentence of their mother, the holye church, pronouncing the true fauour of God and his louing countenance, turned clerely vnto them, which fauour nourish his holie church, with his poore belonging to the same: and the seuere wrath of the Lord God, kindled against all those, which spoile his louing spouse here on earth, bereauing her of her beautiful children, her costlie garmentes made of needle worke, all glorious within, concerning whom the Lord hath sayd, hee which harmeth you, he toucheth the apple of mine eie. Bullinger on the fift of the first epistle of saint Paul to Tymothie, concerning the reformation of Church goods, writeth thus: the goods of the Church are the gold of Tolossan, which breedeth his distruction that possesseth it.
Therefore though the churches, their goods landes, were abused by Monkes and Friers: yet there is no cause why Christian Princes should thinke that reformation good and religious, which pulleth down the churches, and turneth the church goods to the vse and possessions of laie men, for they were not first giuen to this end, kinges, and princes, and magistrates haue their reuenewes, their tributes, their fines, their customes, their publique treasures appointed for their vses: but as for the goods of the church, they were first giuen for the maintenance of students in humanitie, and diuinitie, for the maintaining of Bishops and hospitalitie, for the relieuing of the poore widowes, stangers and captiues, and those which are in necessitie: and a certaine portion was appointed for the repairing of Churches.
Let them restore such sufficiencie of goods to the Church, as will fullie suffice for the maintaining of all the premisses, before they take one halfe pennie from the Church, or else let them surelie looke for the grieuous vengeance of God on them and their house.
That learned Peter Martir concerning the goods of the church vniustlie required by Magistrates writeth thus: in eo quaesto difficilis est in qua dissoluenda &c.
In that case it is a doubtfull question, in answering, the which had rather incline to that point, that if the prince or magistrate should take awaie the goods of the church, no man ought violentlie to resist them.
But if the magistrate would counsell mee to giue vp the goods of the Church into his handes, would not willinglie do it.
Concluding, that vnlesse it be in cases set down before by the holie Father saint Ambrose.
It is not lawful any waie to alienate the goods of the church.
To this generall consent of scriptures, counsels, Fathers (as the conclusion of the rest) succeedeth the great and dangerous punishments which the Lorde sendeth on all them, that take any thing from his holie temple, of which who so mindeth but to sippe, and take a bare tast, let him marke these examples, plainely propounded in these fewe lines following: but if hee will haue more store, and is minded to wade further, let him enter the dissuasiue it selfe, consisting more of example then rule, and Celsus of Verona his dissuasiue thereunto adioyned.
There he shall finde it true by record of sundry histories, which is written in holie scriptures, concerning those which either take or deteine anie thing once vowed and giuen to the holy Church.
And what is that? wee reade in the Actes of the Apostles, that Ananias Saphira his wife consented to keepe backe some of the money which they had once giuen to the Lord.
Which how haynous a crime it was, let all men note.
Sith for the same Saint Peter opened his mouth and strooke them both with present death, reasoning with them and saying on this maner: was it not your owne to haue doone with what you list? why then doe you tempt the holy Ghost, sith the offence is not against man but against God? signifiyng that after it is once giuen or appointed to holie vse, no man ought to retract any parte thereof backe againe.
The like punishment succeeded to all those which spoyled the Church at any time.
Euagrius in the fourth booke of his historie sheweth, that the Duke Gabaones, hearing tell that the Vandalls came against him with a puissant army, called some of his Captaines to him, willing them to put on poore simple apparell, and so to passe ouer to the host of the Vandalls, marking diligently whether the Vandalls, honoured the temples of the christians, or spoiled and violated them.
If they spoyle or violat them (saith he) then see, that in what you can, you reedifie and adorne them: for the God which the Christians worship know not, but if he be so mightie as they say he is, he wil spoile the~ which spoile his house.
The Vandals went forward as they had begun, they spoiled the christian temples, as they passed with their army, they did eat, they dranke, they sported triumphed, enriched with the spoils goods of the church, they marched forward.
And at length ioined battell with Gabaones: but moste of them were slain, many greeuously wounded in the battell, some taken put to diuers torments.
Quanto rectius ille, how much more wisely did that heathen Emperour Alaricus the captaine of the Gotes, which besieging that famous Citie of Rome, at last conquered it, gaue the spoile therof to his soldiers, only excepting the faire solemn temple built ouer the tombe of S. Peter, for the reuerence which they bare to him, commaunding charging most straightly, that no man should once touch it or violate any person, any goodes, or any thing whatsoeuer belonging to the same, which was the cause, why the whole Citie of Rome, was not then clean defaced destroied.
Let no man in this place obiect on the contrary, saying, Moses tooke the calfe burnt it to ashes, casting the~ into the running brooke; the Israelits destroied the temples of the heathen.
Iosias pulled down the temples of the groues: Elias the temple of Baall: Dauid eate the being lawfull onely for the Priestes, Phinehas slew the adulterers, being a priuate man: of which some were mooued by speciall zeale, proceeding from the holy Ghost, wherby they were warranted: and some were commanded (as the Israelits) to slay man, woman and children, which thinges at this day wee must not onely not doe, but if we doe the~ (as Bullinger manie learned writers affirme) it is sin in the sight of God.
Sith the son of man (as saith our sauiour) came not to destroye, but to saue.
He hath broken downe the wall of separation, hath made one shepheard, one sheepefold both of Iewes Gentles, euen the holy Catholike Church, the walles whereof who so diminisheth or casteth downe, the Lord shall inflict the tormentes of this world on him and his posteritie, vnlesse with hartie repentance, he restore that which he hath taken away, and in the world to come, he shall cast him out into vtter darkenes, where the worme of wicked conscience stingeth day and night, where the fire is neuer quenched, the crie neuer ceased, the paine neuer mittigated, the miserie neuer ended.
But to those which loue the Lord, and beautifie his holy temple, with the finest of their gold, the first of their fruites, the most hartie goodwill that they can, the Lord of his mercie shall redouble their gratious charitie many thousand time, into their bosome, granting them their heartes desire heere in this worlde, and in the world to come, the eternall saluation of their soules, euen the life euerlasting: which God graunt vs all thorough Iesu Christ our only Lord and sauiour.
HAuing perused the excellent disswasiue of that worthie man Celsus of Verona, though the pages bee fewe in number, and the paines of translating the same not worthie the account: yet considering the deadlye sleepe into the which we are fallen in these moste daungerous times, and that (as Hermes Trismegist in his Pymander writeth) the vsuall and carefull feeding of our fleshlie bodies, is the consumption of our soules: In regard of my humble dutie towards the most honorable espouse of Iesu Christ, our louing mother the holie church, and to my deare country a member of the same: seeing nowe the same doubt daunger of the enemie which was in his daies, the same supplia~ce collected fro~ the church, the same wound, the same swelling: the same griefe conceiued: doubting least if this vnnaturall wound be long vnhealed, it will drawe to an issue (which is commonly vncurable without the daunger of the whole bodie:) thought good to pen this simple short treatise, with Celsus of Verona his dissuasiue thereunto annexed: that thereby not the common people onely, but also those of higher place and degree might cleerlie vnderstand; that hee which eateth the bread of the innocent shall neuer be satisfied: he which taketh awaie the clothes of the poore, shall neuer bewarme: he which spoileth his nurse, shall neuer be well lyking: he which powleth the church, shall neuer be rich: and hee which weakeneth his mothers backe, shall neuer stand vpright against his enemies in the daie of battaile.
Therefore my deare bretheren, bought with the same price: you which loue the Lord more than earthlie kingdomes, and which count all worldy honour, riches, pleasure, and dignitie vile earth, springing out of the earth, and destinate with your bodies to the earth againe: be yee not so enchaunted with the humming swarme of worldly pleasures, and delightes, that yee loose the ioy eternall.
And now a litle seclude those painted showes of worldlie vanities, besmeared with glistering vernish, which dimmeth your eies; and looke vppon your selues, your soules and bodies.
Neither is it sufficient to consider with that holie Father: vnde, vbi, quo, from whence wee came, where wee are now, and whither wee shall returne: the true answere whereof is that treble anxesis of the prophet: earth, earth, earth.
But in this iourney according to the counsell of saint Paule, we must shake of all which hangeth heauie on, and presseth vs downe; we must learne to weane our selues from our infirmities, and to know our disease: with fixed eies we must behold our wounds, how many, how dangerous, how deep, they bee? how they are to bee cured, and how the stroke of the enemie here after is to be auoided.
Though al our battaile and strife is not directed against flesh and bloud onelie, but also against spirituall powers, and enemies of our soules: yet the enemie of flesh and bloud oft times so daunteth our harts with his proud defiance, and in such sort, that through the too much caring and carking for our selues, hee maketh a plaine and readie entrance to the wounding of our bodies, and so much the rather because the shield and brestplate, with which wee chuse to defend our selues, though at the first sight it sit fit vpon our breast, and outwardly seeme well steeled to the eie? yet inwardlie it is most dangerouslie impoisoned, infesting the bodie with strange contagion, sinking into the vaines and synewes so deepe, that it weakneth our iointes, it dulleth the spirites, and daunteth the courage of the heart.
This is the contagion wherewith (as Celsus the Venetians seeking to ouercome their enemies, were made a praie vnto them.
This is that two edged sword, with which whilest wee rashlie fight against our enemie, and striue to reach him a sore blow, with lifting our hand vp too hastilie, too rashlie, too high; with the other side wee cut our owne faces.
This is the rule which teacheth vs, that when we are prouoked to battaile by outward foes, we must not make flesh our strength, or put any confidence in riches: but if wee hope to ouercome our bodilie enemies, wee must first conquere the spirituall aduersaries of our soules, now ruling in our mortall members: and that is by flyflying to our most louing captaine, and victorious conquerour Iesu Christ, who hauing conquered our great enemies, death, hel, and damnation, is ascended vp on high, leading captiuitie captiue, and giuing great spoiles and giftes vnto men.
His louing voice doth sound from heauen, and biddeth all men come.
Come vnto him all yee that are loaden and he will refresh you.
The spirite and the spouse say come: and hee which heareth let him saie come, hee which thirsteth let him come, and those which hope to see their desire vpon their enemies let them come, and all which loue Iesu Christ and his louing spouse come and see, touch, and tast how sweet the Lord Iesu is.
But how shall wee come? and which is the way? hee which biddeth come, hee calleth them which thirst, opening to them the fountaine of eternall life.
And though am vnworthie to aduise anie, yet my purpose is to admonish those which erre, that they come into the true way.
And how shall wee come? by true repentance of our former wickednes, and sinnes committed against God.
And how shall we repent? not in only saying Lord, Lord, or onely God forgiue me: and so going on in our sinful life? but if thou hast offended thy Lord and louing father, thou must bee heartelie sorie for thy misdoings, with fasting, with praying, with shewing thy penitent mind, and sorrow for thy sins, in thought, in word, in deed.
If thou haue taken thy neighbours goods restore double: and with that good Zacheus in signe of true repentance, giue halfe thy goods to the poore.
In this habit of a true forsaking all that hast, follow our Lord and sauiour, who hath walked the same waie before vs.
If thou haue sinned in fleshlie lustes and desires: fast and praie instantlie, strew ashes on thy head, put on sackcloth in stead of silkes, returne from the view of courtlie troupes, entring into thy secret Chamber, cast downe thy selfe before the Lord, euen vppon the could ground.
Mourne and lament before the Lord: crie out alowd, Adsum qui in me conuertito ferrum.
It is Lord, it is wretched ma~, which haue sinned against heauen and against thee, haue mercie vppon me Lord according to thy great goodnes, and according to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.
This is the beginning of repentance: for these sins of infirmitie, and the end is like vnto the same.
These were the wordes and deedes of Dauid: and was there nothing else? yes verilie, after due consideration of his sinnes, and sorrow for the same, he sought to please the Lord: he fullie purposed to take the arch out of the simple tent, and to build a faire temple vnto the Lord God of Israell, this was his holie life, wherewith he sought to win the Lordes fauour, and his sinnes were the sinnes of his bodie, euen the sins of but if thou once lift vp thine hand against the Lord, and his holy temple, if thou take away the goods of his church, and the maintena~ce of his holy ministers preachers of his word who first tooke thee vp in their hands and brought thee into the Church, who haue washed thee with the baptisme of repentaunce vnto eternall life, who haue taught thee the true Christian faith, and cloathed thee with the stole of righteousnesse, and leade thee by the right hande vnto eternall life, who pray dayly for thy sinnes, and the sinnes of the whole people: then knowe thou assuredly, that though thy armye of souldiers bee huge and monstrous.
Though thy chariots be nine hundred all of iron (as were the chariots of Sisera though thy barred horses bee raunged foorth by thousandes, and thy Iennets by tenne thousandes.
Though thy riches be incomparable, thy strength aboue al estimation: yet if thou haue taken anie iote of maintenaunce from the seruice of the high God: if thou weaken the walles of his Church, and by vnlawfull exactions impouerish his ministers.
speake a truth, and call heauen and earth to witnes the same: that which you accou~t your strength, shall breede your destruction: The Eagles feather once thrust in, shall eate to dust all the feathers in the bedde; the lyons haire shall consume the mixture of other peltes adioined thereto: and Achanes forbidden spoile, shall cause the Israelites with losse of life to flie the field.
Though thy number bee three to one, and thou assure thy selfe to haue the daie: yet if the forbidden Babilonish garment bee hidden in the tent, rather then thou shouldest prosper therewith, the starres in heauen, euen the starres shall fight in order from heauen against thee, as they did against Sisera: the Riuers shall swell against thy comming: which if thou enter, they shall strike of the and carrie thine iron charrets cleane away.
The stones in the walles shall fight against thee at home, and the foules of the ayre abroad, thine enemie shall stand vpon the shore with his banner displaied, whilest thou liest drowning in the deepe.
He shall march vnto the toppes of the highest hilles, without losse of men, or shedding of his bloud, hee shall display his banner with triumphe, hee shal descend in peace, and refound his trumpet in his tente most courragiouslie.
Therefore let all true christians, muse and meditate more wisely on the will of the Lord, let them knowe that it is better to trust in the Lord alone, then in any power of man: that it is better to depend vpon the seruice of the Lord, and the loue of his holie name, then to put any confidence in Princes, in power, in authoritie, in riches.
Let the trueth of the Lord be theyr light, and let his looue be the way, his holy Prophets their guiders in the same.
Let the~ fight cheefely for the glory of the Lord, and not theyr owne glory: for his church, and not their own possessions: for their soueraigne, and not their owne primacie: for the realme, and not for reuenge of priuate quarels or hope of higher rule.
Let their departurebe in peace vnfayned loue vnto the spouse of Iesu Christ: at theyr going foorth, let them not say that theyr garmentes, theyr furniture, theyr money their coine, came from the church: but let them looke backe into the lande, and beholde the church from whence they sprang.
Let them pitty theyr mother in their hart, and let them say with the sons of God: peace bee with thee, and sweete prosperitie thou house and Citty of the Lord, let their watch word be Domus dei: and theyr great allarum, Vincat veritas.
But let them not be christians onelie in word, let not all their religion dwell in their mouth, and nothing in their hartes and deedes: let them not goe foorth laughing, and leaue manie weeping eyes behinde them: let them not bragge that they fight for the Church abroad, whilest they are full of deadlie sinne within, and weaken the foundation of the Church at home.
Can wee looue our father, and yet spoile our elder brethren? Can wee tender our mother, and yet presse her teates so sore: that in steede of sweete milke, they droppe bloude? Can wee cherishe the sucking childe and yet empoision the teate of the which giueth it sucke? Dooth hee looue his freende, who while hee is gone into a farre countrie, taketh his little childrens bread out of their handes? their cloathes from their backes? their houses ouer their heades? If this question knocke at the doore, by which wee would faine enter into the Church of Iesu Christ, and the answere to the same, bee the key, which openeth the waie, and sheweth vs the light of trueth, whose beames shine cleerely from the sonne of God: why shutte wee vp the fleshlie windowes of our heart, with custome of this great sinne aboue the rest? So that that the cleere beames of the sonne of God, the bountie of his mercie, the brightnesse of his glorie, cannot once open our earthlie intralles: or mooue our sinfull bowels, to haue compassion on our tender nurse, and most loouing mother: if this be farre from your perswasion and you doubt of the same, then open your eares and incline your hartes to the voyce of health and saluation, lifte, vp your eye liddes yee worthies of the earth, and comprehend the light which shineth in darknesse.
yee Princes open your gates, and yee the elect of the Lorde open your eternall doores and the true light of the God of glorie shall enter in.
Which when thou hast once beheld with thy mortall eye hauing therewith reade this small treatise, rudelie written in hast, with a posting pen, aske no more the question is this true? or shall aunswer for goods thus taken, or is it a blessed thing to giue vnto the Church, and a cursed thing, to take there fro? In this conceite bee not highe minded, but feare and tremble before the Lord, looke how high the lord sitteth aboue all heauens, and howe lowe thou art here on the earth.
Way that thou art in the earth a worme and no man, that thy daies are but a spanne long, and that one spanne is a continuall warefare: hereunto applie this processe, that when thou camest first into this world, and werte verie young, thy spirituall enemies were olde and subtill, that they haue rather wonne then lost euer sithence, and holde the same vantage of thee at this daie: that they haue wounded thee sore, and so sore, that thou art not able to stand vpright in the way of life.
Therefore though thou be mightie and puissant, yet in that thou art sore wounded refuse not the holesome oyle of the simple Samaritane, which he powreth in thy woundes: denye not his suppliant paines, in binding them vp, in setting thee on his horse, which will bring thee to thy Inne and place of rest, where thou wouldest be.
If he doe the best he can, and laie out the finest coyne in his purse for thee, though it be but two pence, yet sith all this is doone for the bringing thee into the way, from the which thou wert wandered, the deliuering thee from euill, and the sauing of thy life: confesse the trueth which thou canst not denie, the oyle is holesome: the binding co~fortable: the man deuoute: his dooing good: his sayings true, blessed bee the God of trueth.
Which because thy dooings shewe thou yet doubtest, lesten but a little, whilest open before thine eyes the highe fountaine from whence the trueth of sure perswasion most gentlie floweth, together with the plaine examples of auncient times, which shewe most clerely in a glasse, the true countenaunce of the well disposed minde, the good life, and happy death of all those, which heretofore haue looued, founded, inriched, nourished, freede, priuiledged, adorned the church: and contrarie the vglie shape, the tirannous life, and miserable death of those, which persecuted the Christians, pulling downe theyr temples, pilling and powling the liuinges and freedomes of the Church of Iesu Christ here on earth.
Concerning this kinde of catterpillers, Celsus of Verona had written plainely vnto the Duke and Senate of Venece.
In which short treatise sith we may euidently beholde the great deformitie of our age: Sith his leaues be fewe, his examples many, his appliaunce plaine, his conclusion true; sithe it is nowe translated and set open before our eyes, shewing vs this foule spot in our face most apparantly.
will not long discourse on that part, pardon me the glasse is cleare, what should write? That prouerbe was vsed of auncient time, and we prooue it true: Suis quisque malis blanditur, euery man flattereth himselfe in his owne humor, and though the glasse do shew thee plainely, that thy face is foulie spotted in diuers places, with vncleannesse of thine owne hands, and full of puffed pimples, by reason thou drinkest lyquor not ordained for thy stomacke: yet to the ende that those small scabbes without, may breede great sores within, and that thine ende may bee the lue of thy desert: flattering thy selfe with thine owne deformrtie, and loath to bee corrected by an other, thou castest away the glasse: which once abandoned, (qui semel verecundiae limities transilient) without all blushing, thou affirmest boldly, a mould, a wart, a wrinckle, a a spotte, a wheale, is but a toye in a mans face.
And shew me reason why not? why not, if it be not seene, it is no blot, but if it be no more hid, then the nose on your face, or the sight in your eye, if all men loath the sight thereof, and count you carelesse of your health for neglecting the same: then knowe that the time is nowe come of which it was foreshewed, that men should bee loouers of themselues more then of the Lorde, and you are a childe of the same, nowe therefore sith the glasse is gone, and reason is the rule by the which you leauell: knowe yee that your deformities are great, and sith you loue to feede on meate forbidden two men of your complection, know this for a trueth, that all meates are not for al me~.
It were a straunge vnnatural kindnes, if the little child sucking on his mothers brest, shold pull the meate out of her mouth as she is feeding: yet much more vnholsome to be eaten of the child, then straunge to the beholders.
If this vnnatural vnkindnes doe seeme so vntollerable in the flesh, how much more in the children of the spirite? wee must knowe that man (as Hermes writeth) consisteth of two natures: of heauen and earth: of bodie and of soule, of the fleshe and of the spirite.
The fleshe is of earth earthlie: the spirite is from heauen heauenlie: first is that which is spirituall and then that which is bodilie.
The bodie is quickned last and dieth first: but the spirite is that which is first and laste.
As the spirituall is first, so wee ought first of all to walke after the spirit, and not after the flesh: to become like our spirituall father, and to nourish our spirituall mother, and brethren redeemed with the same spirituall sacrifice: renewed with the same spirituall grace: confirmed by the same spiritual pastours, vnto sanctimony holines of life, reading first, aboue al other knowledge, science contemplacions and reuelations, the true heauenlie doctrine of the spirit.
Seking with our bodies, liues and goods, to preserue keepe the volumes, the pastours, the temples of the spirituall worship of the Lord, where the breade of life is broken to those which hunger and thirst after righteousnes, and the spirituall foode of the soule.
After the body followeth the shadowe, and next to this spirituall foode of the soule, the food of the corruptible bodie is to be prouided.
Therefore let vs not seeke after the foode which perisheth, but seeke the foode which preserueth both bodie and soule vnto eternall life, knowing that (as our sauiout Christ saith) man liueth not by bread onely, but by euerie worde which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
This word is the conduit of the spirit, whose substaunce is perfect trueth: this word was in the beginning, by it all thinges were made.
It created all thinges of nothing: in weakenes, strength, in vilenes, honour, in the dust, it placed a liuing, a heauenly and an vndersta~ding soule: erecting the bodily chariot (where in he placed it) right vp to heauen, that he might aboue al things continually haue his face, his eie, his hart and cogitacion fixed on heauen and heauenlie conuersation.
But man would not abide in honour, the spiriual grace of the heauenly fountaine infused into him, was corrupted with the vncleanes of the vessel.
Fro~ the beginning his enemies prouoked him to offend his maker, to leaue ye heauenly spirit, to incline to her handmaid, this sinful, filthy coruptible flesh.
Therewith he lusted after his sensuall appetite he rowled his eie to fro: according to ye wauering of fleshly sensuallity, leauing the mistris, in most degenerate sort, he bound himself to serue the pleasurs of the body.
with the los of life, he brought in death in affecting the losenes of the flesh, he lost the freedome of the spitit: in seeking lands honor on the earth, he left the spiritual Canaan, the heaue~ly Ierusale~ perfect lawe of the libertie.
Sith therfore the essence of man is his spirit, according as it is written Mens vniuscuiusque is est quisque, as the minde is, so is the man, eyther good or bad, and that our first and chiefest constitution is spirituall.
Let vs vnderstand thus much of our selues, that it is most consonant to our creation, to our constitution, to our saluation: that aboue all other things, we frame all our thoughts and meditations: our calling, and conuersation: our goods, and landes: our liues and liuinges, our bodies and our soules: to the nourishing of the doctrine of trueth, and the maintaining of the nurses, the true teachers and preachers of the same.
This is the key of knowledge, whereby wee must open the doore of heauen: the tree of life, which feedeth the soule, the cleare light which lighteneth euery man which commeth into the world.
Now the windowe beginneth to open, the day spring from an highe now visiteth vs, teaching vs truely, that as we consist of two natures, so we are of two beginnings, spirituall, and earthly, of a spirituall father, the creator of heauen and earth, a spirituall mother, the holy catholique Church, on whome hee hath sent his holy spirite visibly descending.
So we must first and principally apply our selues to the maintaining of the health, peace and safety, the reuerence renowne and glory of this spirituall father and mother, leauing our earthly father and our earthly mother in regard of them, because hee created, redeemed and sanctified vs vnto himselfe, our holy mother.
She nourisheth vs with the spirituall milke of the holy ghost, that wee should be an holie religious generation vnto the Lord.
Therefore after wee haue truelie confessed, that wee beleeue in the most holie, blessed, and glorious trinitie, three persons and one God, next vnto our heauenlie Father, wee acknowledge our spirituall mother, the holie catholique Church: in whose custodie at his departing out of this world, he left his will and testament plainlie written and subscribed with his owne hand, and the handes of manie faithfull witnesses, surelie sealed with his most precious bloud.
He fixed it so surelie, and with such vertue, that therwith the speres did shrinke in the heauens, the Moone against nature retired from the East, into the Meridian, the Sunne lost his light, the aire was darke, the earth did shake, the graues opened, the spirits arose, the hel below all tre~bled: so that the powers therof were loosed.
After this athentical signifying of his most pretious death bitter passion, in heauen, in earth, in hel: he gaue it as his owne deed, his last wil testame~t vnto his beloued spouse the holy church, a sure seale and pledge of eternall saluation to her all her faithfull children for euer.
As is the loue of her husband, so is hirs: for she hath it giuen her of him, euen breathed from his owne mouth: hee is one and his loue is one for euer: the heauens shall waxe old like a garment, the Sun shal shrinke from his Excentrich, the earth shall passe awaie like a tempest, but the loue of our spiritual mother, is as the loue of our heauenlie father, once euer: whom she once loueth, she loueth them to the end, that most entirely, according to the saying of the prophet; when father and mother forsaketh me, then the Lord taketh me vp.
Therefore if we be his true children, we must frame our selues, that we bee like our spirituall parents, not in countenance onlie, outward looke, but in sinceritie holy deuotio~.
We must forsake both father mother, concerning the flesh, honouring our spirituall father our spiritual mother aboue all other things both in heauen and in earth.
He hath begotten vs sonnes of the spirit, euen by the spirite of life, and she through his great grace doth nurse vs vp with the same food: she taketh vs vp out of the mirie waies of this sinful flesh, she vnfoldeth the sinfull clothes of the bodie, wherewith wee are almost smothered, she openeth our mouth, applying thereto her tender teats, from whence she distilleth the drops of spiritual life into our hearts, wherby our soules be fed, our bodies preserued, our vndersta~ding increased, our eies cleared, our faith perfected; so that we see most plainly how we should loath the world, learne to loue our holy mother the church, knowing that it is not meete to leaue the cleare Sunne, to waite on shadowes: or possible to serue God Mammon, this world heauen, the flesh the spirit: according (as Hermes writeth) Nisio fili corpus tuum oderis, teipsum amare non poteris: impossible est vtrisque simul intendere: Sonne vnlesse thou hate thy body, thou canst not loue thy soule: for it is impossible to applie thy selfe at once to them both.
Therfore be ye not so blinded with the stinking mist of Sathans deadly smoke, or the painted vale of this wicked world, or the sinful web of fleshlie corruptions, ouerspredding the sight of your eie, that you should not look into the cleer glas now set before your face, wherein you may plainlie behold the reflexion of your deformities, this vnnaturall spot wherewith you greatlie disgrace your selues before the face of God and man at this day.
If your eies be so dim through the cares of this present world, that ye cannot looke into the times of old, if you cannot see so far before you, by reason of the cloudy te~ptations, which the world, the flesh the deuil beat in your faces: yet in regard of your safety, look downe vnto your own feet, least you depart fro~ the way of life.
If you be so intangled with the briers of this wicked world, that you cannot goe forward: nay that you cannot once turn your selfe to look towards the Church: Yet fixe thy feete that thou goe not backward from euill to worse, and let thy countenance affect the sight of the heauenly Ierusalem.
Though thine eies bee dim, yet open thine eares, harken to the sweet admonitio~s of thy mother, foreshewing thee the sweete and the sower of this thy dangerous iourneie, wherein sith thou art to walke through the wildernes of this wicked world, before thou assaie the isie ground therof, know that which elsewhere is wisely written: Terra imbrobitatis est prouincia, the earth is a prouince full of naughtines, through which who so mindeth to walke safelie, hee must bee verie circumspect, taking heede to his beginninges, knowing that hee which beginneth well, hath halfe finished the work.
The first entrance of this waie vnto eternall life, is to loue the Lord thy God with all thy hart, thy mind, thy soul; the next step is like vnto it: loue thy neighbour as thy selfe, according to the rule of nature.
Do vnto others as yee would that they should doe vnto you againe.
This rule is generall the meaning large, the obseruance thereof hard and tedious: therfore before post forward too fast vnto the ende, will make some litle small spence of time in opening the first beginning thereof: and which is that? as it is said in the rule of christian faith, next to the blessed trinitie is ioyned the holie catholique church: as also in the table of the ten commaundements, next to those which wholie concerne the worship of God: in the first place and before all the rest, is placed.
Honor thy father and thy mother, and that with a blessing: which who so mindeth to be partaker of, hee must not onelie honor his naturall father and mother, but he must vnderstand truelie, that as the spiritual part soule of man, is before the flesh: so first and principallie wee must honor our heauenlie father, which hath begotten vs of the true spiritual immortal seed, wherby as saith S. Paul, the faithful daily crieabba father, next to this our spiritual father, aboue all fleshlie parentes, we must honour our spirituall mother, the holy catholique church, whose children we are before we haue our perfect beeing in the flesh· according to the saying of Euaristus in his decrees.
Scimus Christum esse caput, cuius nos membra sumus, ipse est sponsus, ecclesia est sponsa cuius filii nos sumus, wee trulie know that Christ is the head of his Church, whose members we are: for he is the husband and the church is his spowse, we the children of the~ both.
Therefore before wee looke at our naturall parents, we must most christianly apply our selues vnto the honour and reuerence of our spirituall father and our spirituall mother.
Nay we must forsake both goods and landes, honour and dignitie, frendes, kindred, brethren, yea our naturall father and mother, and cleaue vnto our spirituall mother the holie Church, according to that most christian aunswere of that learned Tritemius to his naturall mother.
To who~ after she had signified by diuers louing letters, that she most earnestly desired to see him face to face, hee returned this aunswere: Non licet mihi deinceps parentum solatio delectari: Omnia pro Christi amore contempsi: coepiiam esse vt Melchisedech, sine patre, sine matre, sine genealogia: Solum Deum patrem agnosco: matrem non habeo nisi Ecclesiam: It is not conuenient that should hereafter take comfort in anie naturall parentes: loath all other thinges in regarde of the loue of Christ: and nowe am become like vnto Melchisedech, without father, without mother, without kindred: haue no father but God, neither anie mother besides the holy Church.
In these words he signifieth thus much: that who hath created vs first and loued vs most, wee ought to seeke him first, and most to loue him, and therfore sith our heauenly father is a liuing spirit, and our mother trulie spiritual, sith there is no loue comparable to his, which leauing all creatures in heauen in earth, gaue his life for vs; or to hers, which though she were ten times persecuted, euen vnto death for our sake, yet she louingly embraced vs; In louing our spiritual parents before all other things, let vs render like for like.
Let vs willingly reiect the sensuall entisements of the flesh, disarming our selues of riches, goods, lands honour, office, authoritie, yea our owne father and mother, according to the flesh, that wee maye serue our spirituall father and mother in the vnitie of the spirite.
This is a cleare glasse, in which a christian maye beholde the degrees, by which wee must passe thorow this vale of miserie, vnto the kingdome of heauen, and the rule is like vnto it, for the first rule or direction of a christian soule vnto heauen, is, aboue all thinges to meditate with himselfe whether he be in the true way of eternall life or no.
And therewith to consider with himselfe, what he hath done, what hee hath not doone, and what hee ought to doe: which who so wiselie weigheth, hee shall finde it true, that before all care and prouision of our sinfull bodies, we ought most painefully to prouide for the health of our soules, knowing assuredly that we must passe this earthly pilgrimage, with suche religious care of our spirituall father and mother, that therewith wee must restraine our affections, from the woonted wishes of the worlde, and weane them so from fleshlie corruptions, with the true discipline of our spiritual nurse, that neyther riches, nor goods, nor dominion, nor power, nor freinds, nor enemies, nor life, nor death, can once separate vs from the true worship of his holie name, and the daily maintenance of the same.
This is the way easie to bee found out of all those which heede the same.
The ground is euen, the path is plaine, the degrees not many, the passage easie.
that the foote could bee content to follow the direction of the eye, that the handmayd would be obedient to her mistrisse, or that the flesh would but cease a little to resist the good motions of the spirite.
If wee could but a little, yea saye but a little sequester our selues from this worldly securitie, which with her manifold charming pleasures, hath lulled vs so long in the cradle of the flesh, that wee are almost all fallen into a daungerous deade sleepe.
If we could but once beholde the Lorde as hee is, in himselfe, truth and equitie: or but once thinke of him aright, of his woonderfull maiestie, supported with eternall sanctimonie, holines, and righteousnesse: If the Lorde of his great mercie would but once open our eyes, and let vs see this heauenly obiect, we should be so farre from offending his maiestie, and decaying his church, that for euer after wee would loath this earthly dungeon of our bodie, ful of deadly destructions and pleasaunt miseries, wee shoulde then more truely know God and Iesu Christ, whom hee hath sent: wee should bee able to discerne the honourable, the blessed, the singular prerogatiue, which hee hath giuen to his spowse.
And therwith wee should striue to yeelde her the first fruits of our best and greatest endeuours, wee shoulde looke about vs, see more clearly how farre the heathen haue gone before vs in their kinde, concerning religion: how farre we are fallen in these daies from the rules of nature and true philosophy, from the examples of the holy fathers, the olde patriarkes, the true prophets, the blessed apostles, the christia~ emperors the reuerend Bishops, whilest we embrace this present worlde, and make desolate his holie Church, with the ministerie thereof.
Let vs knowe that wee are heere placed in a strife of obtaining double pleasure, and double paine, the pleasure of the sense worketh sinne, and sinne is the parent of death, but the minde flieth higher vnto the heauenly hilles, euen to the top of that high Olimpus, from whence commeth our health.
These two contrary desires bee the cause of mans disquietnes in this life, shewing plainly that the flesh euermore striueth against the spirite with such perfect discord, that whatsoeuer maintaineth the one, destroieth the other: that which delighteth the one displeaseth the other: that which exalteth the one, depresseth the other.
So that though the spirite bee willing, yet the flesh is verie weake, and vnable to walke this straite and narrow way of eternal life, yea so weake, that Saint Paule in the middest of this battell crieth out: that which would doe, that doe not, and that which would not, that do.
wretch that am, who shall deliuer me from this bodie of sinne, euen the grace and mercie of God, thorowe Iesu Christ our Lord.
Let vs therefore cast of this coate of sinne, with the workes of darkenes, and put vpon vs the armour of light now in this most daungerous day, wherein charitie is waxen so colde, and iniquitie so hoat, that we scarse count it any sinne, to take away the maintenance of the Church of Iesu Christ.
The naturall Philosopher teacheth trulie, that euerie compound bodie consisteth of two parts, of matter, and forme: affirming that the forme is the more excellent part of nature.
The Logitian considering with Plato, that matter is a note of corruption, affirmeth that the forme is worthie to rule.
The morall Philosopher writeth thus: Animal autem primum constat animo corpore, quorum illud quidem imperat natura, hoc quidem paret: animus imper at corpori, herili imperio, mens antem appetitui ciuili regio: a man consisteth cheefelie of minde of bodie: the minde by nature dooth rule, the bodie by nature dooth obaie, concluding thus: Imperet sapiens, let the strong in bodie take paines, but let learned wisedome rule.
In Aegipt the best Astrologers were had in greatest honour, and as it appeareth by Hermes (the first lawe giuer of the Aegiptians) such were commonly chosen Kinges.
So likewise with the Chaldeans, with the Assirianes, with the Romanes, and Indianes, the heauenlie vertues and giftes of the minde were in highest honour: so that as (Plato writeth) they counted that common wealth happie, in which either Kinges were Philosophers, or Philosophers raigned.
Herein we learne that euen by the mere motio~ and instincte of nature, the verie heathen honored wisedome and vertue in what person soeuer, aboue all the giftes of the body, naie they so highly esteemed of knowledg and vertue, that they not onlie gaue them the highest honor, and dominion whilest they liued, but after their death, they built temples vnto them, and celebrated their memorie after their heathenish superstition perpetually.
Their doinges shewed plainely that they had some hidden sparke in them by nature of the fire, which ought not onelie to be kindled in the hartes and mindes of all true christians, but also it ought to flame forth giue light in their liues conuersations much like a candle, which standeth on highe, giueth light to the whole house.
This candle sheweth vs plainelie, that man by nature (following the better part of his constitution) is appointed to worship God, and to emploie himselfe, his goods, his giftes, and all his power, for the maintaining of the true worship of God, in his holy temple aboue all other thinges in heauen in earth.
Neither let any man thinke, that this is the dutie of the clergie onely, whose office is in the first place of holie function, to be ministers of his diuine worship: or that it belongeth onelie to the poore fatherlesse inferior people (although of such commonly the kingdome of God dooth most consist, as it is written: not many mightie, not manie rich, not many of the most accounted of in this world, shall enter into the kingdome of heauen) but vnto the worshipfull, the honorable, the Duke, the Prince, the King, the Emperour, who though he bee accounted the greatest among christians, yet hee that is least in the kingdome of God, is greater then he.
Sith this little sparke of heathen fire, hath lightened the candle euen of christian princes, let not our harts be so ouer grown with the choking weeds of this mortalitie.
Neither let the God of this world either so blinde our eyes, or dimme our sight, that wee professing the name of Christians, with our mouth, shold be like the heathen people in our life.
Herein let vs learne to distinguish the cleere light of a christian candle, from the smoking snuffe of the heathen.
Hee which is the king of kinges, and onely ruler ouer all, hee said plainlie, my kingdome is not of this world.
Neither those which onely bende themselues to the fleshlie course of this worlde, to attaine highe stile, dominion and rule: the fat of the field, or riches of the Citty, are the truest christians.
For what is a christian? or what difference doe wee make betwixte the worthie dignitie of christian princes, and the tirannicall empire of the heathen? Theyr strength is the cursed confidence of flesh and bloud.
Though an horse be but a vaine thing to saue a man, though all fleshe is grasse, and the glorie thereof is as the flower of the fielde, which florisheth to day and to morrow is cast into the furnace, though euerie man liuing, and all the liuing of man, is but meere vanitie, yea lighter then vanitie it selfe: yet the heathen and worldly man will disquiet himselfe in vaine, hee will make fleshe his arme and the compasse of the earth his dominion: hee will plante his foote in the sea, and his armie in the highest hils, he will displaie his banner before the clowdes, and compare his glory to the golden tressed sunne.
The swelling of sinfull fleshe is aboue measure and desire of rule seeth not God.
Christian kinges they set the glorie of God before theyr eyes, and not their owne glorie, they first of all acknowledge their spirituall father, and their spirituall mother, before their naturall parentes, according to that sence, and sentence of Hermes: Diuina officia praecedere, humana sequi debent, we must first seeke heauenly things, the~ those which co~cerne this world But the Kings and rulers of the heathen, they are filii terrae, the sonnes of the earth.
Their desire, their life their looue, their greatest glory and rule, is in the earth alone, and came from the earth, they knowe not their heauenly father, and therefore ofte times they spoile their spirituall mother.
Such as they be, such is their rule, not for the glory of God, or the safetie of his church, for they defie her, they prophane her, they pill and poll her, but they rule for their owne glory, their owne peace and safetie, according to their owne humour, as it is plainely described by the mouth of Daniell speaking vnto Balthasar in this manner.
King, the most high God hath bestowed dominion, magnificence, glorie, and great honor, vpon Nabuchodonozar thy father, and in regard of that highnes, which God gaue him, all people, kindreds, Kinges and nations, trembled before him and feared him greatly.
Whom he would, he killed, whom he would he did strike, whome hee would he aduaunced, and whom he would he threw down.
This is the tyrannical rule of the Kings of the nations, concerning which our sauiour Christ hath said principes gentium dominantur eis, &c.
This is the waie of flesh and bloud, into the which that younger sonne, euen the carnall man, is alreadie entered, but to the elder children begotten in the spirite, borne of our true spirituall mother and nursed in the schoole of Christianitie, and by her instructed out of the booke of life, in the fayth, feare, and looue of God, our spirituall father hath sayd: Vos autem non sic.
The Kinges of the heathen and rulers of the earth, they are called good maister, and good grarious lord, most highe, most renowmed, most mighty, most glorious, most excellent maiesty, without exception of heauen and earth.
They thinke themselues to be Gods, making the ende of their power and rule, to bee the extolling of their owne honour and dignitie.
They regard not iustice, that they should doe no iniurie: nor the poore, that they might bee called mercifull: nor their brethren, that they might seeme naturall: nor their inferiours, that they might appeare humble: nor the goods, the landes, the peace, the priuiledge, the honour, the glorie of God, or man, that there might appeare some sparke of Godly life in them.
But without regard of God, of pietie or pittie, they say to this man, cast thy selfe headlong from yonder rocke before my face: breake his legges: pearce the other to the heart: reache mee the heade of that braue knight: let that Lord be pulled in peeces with wilde horses: cast that Earle into the dungeon with the Lions: destorie that nation: burne those temples, sley man, woman, and childe: onelie preserue my kingdome, my crowne, my maiesty, and let your praiers be made onely vnto me.
Though the Lord, hath giuen the highest honor to the King, and put the scepter into his hand, in which respect they are said to be gods, sitting in the place of God, pronouncing the sentence in his name and person, yet let the~ know that they must die like men: that theyr bodies are made of a lothsome matter, that they are but wormes meate, dun ashes, earth, earth, earth, most vile and corruptible earth, as all other men be, though their descent bee princely, ofte times from the house of many mighty Kings and Emperours, though the knee of flesh and bloud, doe bowe and kneele at their presence, though their honour bee great in the eyes of the people, their scepter mightie, their crown gorgious: yet one clod of earth must couer their heades in the graue, and all their glorie shall be shut vp in a fewe lines: according to the saying of saint Augustine in his booke De vera innocentia: Qui splendes in mundo, &c. Thou which shinest in the world aboue the rest, thou accountest of thy nobilitie, of thine auncestors, thou reioycest in thy large dominions, in thy parentage, in the great honour and homage, which all men doe vnto thee: knowe thy selfe that thou art earth, and thou shalt bee consumed into earth againe: looke vppe but a little, and beholde those which were placed in the same throne of maiestie, before thy time.
What is become of those excellent Oratours, those mightie princes, those puissant conquerous, those renowmed Emperours? Looke vnto the graue, whether thou art passing, beholde and see, are they not all nowe rotten dust? are they not like a sparke of fire, which is vanished? is not all there glorie and fame contained in a fewe lines written of them by some poore contemned scholler? shall not the greatest Prince in this world, rise vp naked at the daie of iudgement all amazed, trembling and quaking? Naie not his bodie onelie but his heart and his minde, his soule and his conscience, shalbe laied open before the Lord, his Angels, his saints, and all his elect.
If hee haue plaied the tyraunte beating his fellowe feruantes, ruling for his owne gaine and not for the benefitte of his Church, shall not the remembraunce of his honour bee a stinging serpent to him in his conscience, and his Princely dominion a most deadly corasiue to his heart? Therefore be wise ye kings and princes of the worlde, and yee which iudge the earth, hearken to the wordes of vnderstanding.
Knowe yee that the wisedome of this world, is not as is the wisedome of God.
Many men in their wisedome, forecast by all meanes possible, to come into possession of riches, honour, authoritie, power and maiestie, which when they haue attained, let them but looke back a little, and consider, with what wicked, sinnefull greeuous paines, they were gotten, with what feare and daunger they are possessed: with what greefe they are loste: let them enter into theyr owne heartes, and beholde what a hell of corruptions, and what an armie of tempting serpentes accompanie the minde that is set vppon riches: let them marke howe manie wise men of this world, haue come vp of nothing, to great aboundaunce of wealthie authoritie: and yet after they haue well practised, and wiselie waied manie yeeres, which waie they might come to enioye the height of their desire, (which is to rule whilest they liue heere on earth, and to leaue the like to their posteritie) it hath pleased the Lorde in one hower, to cutte of the sequell, and issue of all theyr hope.
Either theelues togeather with their posteritie are cutte off, or else the Lorde dooth take awaye that theyr ioye before theyr face, or after all sendeth a worse mischeefe to theyr soule, then anie penne can write, anie tongue can tell, or anie heart can vnderstand.
Which though we cannot sound to the bottome, yet let vs learne by the shadowe, to gesse the pourtraiture of the body: by the effect, to search the cause, by the conclusion to knowe the trueth of that axiome: Who so euer maketh his God of any thing here on earth, it shall neuer prosper with him.
He shall neuer possesse the eternall heauen in the world to come.
Who so presumeth of his owne wisedome, before the iustice of God, or on his might that he may treade downe, the poore, hee shall not bee able to stand vpright in the daie of his daunger, and to his vtter confusion he shall heare that voice at length.
Non est sapientia, non est prudentia, non est consilium aduersus dominum: there is no wisedome, there is no pollicy, there is no counsell against the Lord.
If wee will not hearken to the poore contemned ministers of Iesu Christ which forewarne vs dailie, of that great daunger of our soule, which wee rashlie aduenture by more esteeming of man then of God, of the seruice of man then of the seruice of God, of the commaundement of man, then of the commaundement of God, of the house of man, then of the Church of God, of the seruaunt of man, then of the minister of God, the stones in the wall shall crie out aloud, and our owne conscience shall tell vs plainly, that in loouing the honour, the maintenaunce, the issue of our bodie, wee haue vtterly lost the saluation of our owne soules, that our eyes were so cleane washed with the water of life, that wee might but once stedfastly behold the bright beautie of the radiant sonne of God; no doubt we would leaue this great politike wisedome of this world (wherin euery one striueth to frame his children) and learn the true wisedome, which is follie in the eyes of flesh: wee would humble our selues before the Lorde, and kisse the sonne least he be angry.
We would not count of that sweetnes which is tasted with toong, nor of the fading beautie, which shineth in the face of sinneful flesh: we would cast our worldly honour in the dust, and put our scepter vnder the of Iesu Christ; We would not so much seeke the honour of earthly kingdoms, nor triumph so often in the flesh, but we would first aboue all other thinges, reade the will of our God, and meditare in the same both daye night; wee would seeke to differ from the heathen in extolling our scepters, after the manner of flesh bloud: we would leaue the delight, careful seeking of the worlde, which is the first entraunce vnto Christ.
We would knock at the doore of his mercie by a true faith, and enter further by perfect obedience.
We would drawe neere to the father, and kisse the sonne most louingly, because he loued vs first so entirely, that when wee were his enemies, and beeing a most vile and sinnefull creature, he left thousands of bright shining holie angels, his daily ministers, the spheares of heauen, the stars of the firmament, with all the rest of his beautiful creatures, comming down in great humilitie, was made man.
He beeing the high God of heauen earth, for our sake was made man, he suffered hunger and thirst, reprochies, and reuilings, agonies and paines, he sighed in his heart, hee groned in the spirite, and that which is able to make any christian hart to melt, when it is harde, he suffered that cruell souldier to pierce his tender side with a speare, wher with came out both bloud and water, euen his most pretious heart bloud, the eternall foode of our soules.
what mercie is this, and who is able to comprehend it? shall passe it with silence? or shal my pen presume to touch the same? shall my heart stande amazed at this wonder, and my mouth keep sile~ce? When behold the heauens, the angels, the height of these creatures aboue ma~.
And co~sider the depth of his mercie towards man: shal not beginne with the Prophet: what is man that thou art so mindfull of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him? And proceed with the voice of good Saint Barnard: hone Iesu.
Quid tibi merito? nos debuimus, tu soluis: nos peccauimus, tu luis: opus sine exemplo, gratia sine merito: Charitas sine modo.
sweet Iesu howe belongeth this to thee, or thy desert? we are indebted, and thou paiest it: we haue sinned, and thou art punished: a worke aboue all co~parison, mercie without all merite: charitie aboue all measure: my soule open thine inward spirites, and let my toong sound foorth his praise.
praise the Lord in his holines, praise him in the bountie of his great mercie, and all that is within me praise his his holie name.
ye princes open your gates, and let the king of glorie enter in.
bowe downe your princely eyes, and beholde this great humilitie of the first and the last, the king of kings, the Lord of Lords, the high souereigne king of heauen earth.
Take heede yee rulers of the earth, that ye goe not farre from this fountaine of life, least yee thirst and so perish by the way.
come neere and taste howe sweete the Lorde our maker is, and lette not the comfortable voice of his louing spowse (whom hee hath made ouerseer of his will) once depart out of your eares, Take heede now your father is gone, that you disquiet not your louing mother.
Doe not your selues that mortall disgrace, or the Lorde of light that vnkindnes, that you should forget his bloodie stripes wherewith yee were healed, or his wounds which gaue you life, or his exceeding loue which passeth all vnderstanding, but render loue for loue to the vttermost of your power.
Sith hee hath loued vs first, let vs loue him first of all.
Sith hee refused all creatures in heauen and in earth that hee might shew mercie vpon vs, let vs refuse all other thinges, and loue him alone; not in word onely, nor in shewe, but in heart, in worde, in our outward life and conuersation.
Can wee taste of the cleare fountaine, and not kneele downe? or drinke of the liquor, and not touch the cuppe with our lippes? can we taste of the sweete drops of his most pretious bloud, and not kisse the sonne of our saluation, the spring of eternall life, the glory of heauen and earth? Then leauing heathnish glory, the rule of flesh bloud, christia~ princes must come to the fountain of true christianity, which is clear bright, sheweth plainly, that they must fall downe before the throne of the lamb; that their regiment, and commonwelth ought not to be disposed, and for the establishing of their owne kingdome, or for the aduauncement of their owne honour, or for the safetie of their owne life: but especiallie and aboue all thinges, they must bend themselues to set forth the honour and glorie of God, their high honours and offices must be appointed for the seruice kingdome of Christ: their power, their men, their armour, their goods, their landes, their dominions, their nobles, their court, and courtiers, are to be imploied in the seruice and obedience of the church of Iesu Christ.
Thus proceeding in the waie of life, let them not barely imagine, that God is aboue all the rulers in the world; but that he is carefullie and dutifullie to bee serued euerie daie, and that the howre of his diuine seruice is not to bee appointed at our will, but at his wil, and when it shall bee thought most meet, by them which are truelie religious.
Herein wee ought to be so resolutelie bent to serue the Lord our God with all our heart, our mind and our soule; so truelie and so hartilie, that no embassadour, no triumph, no pleasure or worldlie affaires whatsoeuer, should alter the hower of common praier, which wee haue once giuen to the Lords seruice: vnto the which if wee cannot resort sometime, at the appointed howre, which we haue once granted vnto the Lord, yet let the rest of our life be so holie and reuerent before the Lord and his people, that our Christian absence may shew most plainlie, there is vrgent occasion why wee cannot come.
If they count it a more holie, a more necessarie, a more honourable thing to serue the Lord, and to humble themselues on their knees before him in his holie temple then to feede their eies with worldly pleasures (which in time and season are good and commendable) if the count more of diuine seruice, than of humane, of the eternall ioy of heauen, than of this perfect miserie; of the euerlasting kingdome, than of this earthlie tabernacle: they will not onelie leaue all these, and come to the temple of the Lord, there falling downe before their good Lord and maker, their maker, and redeemer, their redeemer, and present helper, their helper and comforter in al woe, and distresse: but in fact, in truth, in good earnest, after the yeelding themselues, their soules and bodies a holie and acceptable sacrifice before God (which is their reasonable seruice don to him) they wil open the bowels of their compassion vnto their holie mother the church and their poore bretheren, they wil wiselie bestowe their best landes, goods, honors, priuiledges, counsels, courtes, auctorities, euen the most perfect meditatio~ of their vnderstanding harts, vpon the spouse of Iesu Christ.
yee mightie men, whose throne is exalted in the middest of flesh and bloud, do you doubt of this? Haue you not heard of olde how the gentils ruled, which knew not God? or what our Sauiour Christ said concerning them? and what was it? you shall not do so, and how then? The Apostle writeth that which the prophet said: Credidi, propterea loquutus sum: haue beleeued this truth, and therefore haue written: neither is it bare beliefe, sith plaine truth holdeth the sterne: whilest my litle pen passeth ouer the high surges of this worldlie sea: and that those worldlie mindes thus tossed and tumbled with the vncertaine flawes of worldie tempests, might finde the true calme discried by the rule and compasse of Christian doctrine: let them but looke vp a litle, directing their eies vnto the climat, where the sonne shineth cleare and bright, and they shal see the land and hauen of quietnesse where they would bee.
And where is that? or what sure direction haue wee to the same? whilest wee saile in these tempestuous and troublesome seas of vncertaintie, considering that the bottom is so britle, that wee can haue no ancre holde, the seas so wide that wee are farre from kenning of anie coast, the winde so vncertaine, that wee knowe not whither wee are driuen: let vs surelie beleeue that which our parents told vs at our entring into this fleeting vessell, that there bee manie gone before vs, euen the same way, through the same seas, to the same hauen that we desire.
And if you will looke vp with mee a litle, assure you haue descried one, which though it bee farre off, and scarcelie within kenning, yet by the view the pilot thereof seemeth cunning, the course direct, the shippe faire and good, taking the verie waie of our direction: and now lying at ancre before the mouth of the hauen, which wee so long haue wished? And where is that? The examples which minde to propound vnto you is, these three wise men.
The first fruites of the Gentils, which by the appearing of a starre were directed vnto Christ, sith in these daies the stile of learning, and the learned is lowe, yea so low, that it lyeth written in the dust; troden downe with the feet of ignorant men, the kingdome of this world is the golden mirror on which most mens eies, are continually fixed with desire and admiration.
Let no man doubt, but these learned men were also kinges, according as it is written in sundrie learned fathers: Dicts sunt etiam reges, quia illo tempore, philosophi sapientes regnabant, they were also called kinges, because in those daies wise philosophers reigned.
Then these beeing the first fruites of the gentils, and the first Christian kinges that euer were.
All those which minde to come to Iesu Christ to bee washed with his bloud, to bee saued by his perfect merit and great mercie, let them fixe their eies on these first christian kings, let them learne trulie, marke dilige~tly what they did.
They left their owne naturall countrie, with all thinges therein, following the starre which led them to Iesu Christ.
They came to the Inne where the childe was porelie layed in a there heart was stil fixed with the light which did shine to them from Heauen: though they were mightie Kinges, yet they regarded not the basenesse of the house, nor the vnseemlinesse of the stable, where this holie Childe was: but acknowledging great maiestie, to lye here couered in low humilitie, they cast downe the glorie of their kingdomes at his feete, they opened their golden vessels, and offered to him, gould, mirre, and frankensence, the first fruits of true christianitie.
Wherein wee haue a plaine example propounded to all christian princes and people, in that they followed the light of the starre: shewing that the wisest though they bee exceedingly learned, as they were, yet sith this is the Lorde of wisedome, euen the wisedome of the God of heauen and earth (leauing our owne natural wisedome and denying our selues) wee ought to followe this cleare light, which shineth thorow Christ from heaue~.
Though they be noble Princes as these were, yet they ought to acknowledge him to bee king of kings, and Lord of Lords, of whom it was forshewed, that he should walke vpon the lyon and the dragon: that all nations should doe him seruice, that his kingdome shall haue none ende.
And who shall declare his generation? though the mightie of this world bee of high honour and dignitie as they were, yet their humble kneeling and obedience, sheweth that christian Princes are not to rule ouer their subiects, like the heathen, for their owne pompe, their owne honour, their owne magnificent glorie, for the safetie of their owne life, regiment kingdome: but that with the princely maiestie of the annointed of the Lord, they should leaue the care of their earthly kingdome, and follow the cleare star of Iesu Christ, which lightneth the grossest darkenes.
They should bowe their bodies, and bende their whole strength before Iesu Christ and his holie Church.
Though worldly men, Potentates and Princes, liue in greate plentie of honour, freedome, and all abundance, yet knowing that without God, is without all: let them leaue the loue of their owne houses, the delight and glorie of their pompous pallaces, let them forsake their owne fathers house, their goodes, and landes, and cimery with the faithfull Abraham, and bestowe their whole substance, honour, and riches, on the Lord Iesu, and his louing spowse the holy Church.
Remembring that he created them poore wretches when they were nothing, and that of nothing: (as it is saide) he hath loued them without their desert, and that with a most entire surpassing loue.
Hee feedeth them in their mothers wombe, and openeth their mouthes, that they should breath.
Hee preserueth them from all the daungers of their infancie, euerie minute maintaineth them in their kingdoms, holding vp the scepter in their handes, as it is written: Per me reges regnant, by my permission kinges doe rule vppon earth.
They rule by him, and him alone, for if hee doe but alienate the mindes of the subiectes, the princes seate dooth shrinke vnder him.
If hee doe but a while restraine the dewe of heauen, as hee did at the praier of Elias the prophet of the Lorde, both prince and people famish together.
Though hee giue store of foode, though it bee well prepared, and by the counsell of good phisitions drest finely for the kinges owne mouth; yet if the Lord do not blesse it in his mouth, as he cheweth it, in the throate as it descendeth, in the stomacke as it concocteth, in the passage from thence as it digesteth, his meate is his bane, or at the least hee falleth sicke after the tast thereof, and lyeth miserably groaning vppon his pillowe: If the Lorde dooth but the least of his benefits a little, the fire from roasting, the sunne from shining, the corne from riping, the tong from tasting, the lungs from breathing but one minute of an houre, though he be the mightiest king in the world, forthwith hee perisheth from the face of the earth.
Therefore let all kings and princes, all people and nations, acknowledge the great power of the Lord, euen in the least of his benefits.
Let them leaue off the delight of worldly vanities, wherewith they are puffed vp, their honours, landes, and goodes.
Let them affect the true honour and maiestie, the glorious triumph and perfect pleasure, which well beseemeth a christian prince, euen the annointed of the Lord.
Neither are wee carried with the fruitlesse winde of scisme, that we should condemne those pleasures which bee lawfull: knowing that as the Lorde hath giuen man a bodie together with his soule, so it is as necessarie that he looke for the sustenaunce, the defence, the delight, or recreation of his body, as of his soule, and that in most honourable, pleasant, triumphant manner, if time and place permit.
But yet first and principally wee must seeke to feede our soule with the foode that neuer perisheth, and then the body.
Those which doe blesse the Lorde of heauen, and loue him aboue all the fading ioyes of the earth: they shall receyue from aboue blessing for blessing, grace for grace, loue for loue, to their endlesse comfort in the great day of his visitation, they shall florish like the fruitfull vine, their children shall stande like oliue braunches round about their table, and they shall neuer want one to sit vppon their seate after them for euer.
They shall see their childrens children, together with the temples and good woorkes of their owne handes.
They shall reioyce therein, because their memorie shall neuer perish from the face of the earth: but especially because this oyle which they haue in their lampes, shall giue a light to their eyes: a direction to their feete: a comfort to their heart and conscience, in the day of iudgement.
This is the sentence of holy scripture, and the example is like vnto the same.
Looke ouer the booke of God: peruse it diligently, and tell mee, if euer you did see the righteous forsaken, or his seede begging their bread.
But alwaies those which first aboue all worldly affaires, did seeke the kingdome of God, and the righteousnesse thereof, whiche built temples to his holie name, maintaining his praise and glorie in the same, they had all good blessings powred on them.
Abraham left his owne country, willing to haue sacrificed his onely sonne, at the voice of the Lord: and therefore hee had this assuraunce by the voyce of an Aungell from heauen: By my selfe haue sworne (saith the Lorde) that in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.
Which blessing continued in Isaac, the fruits therof began to budde in Iacob, whose willing minde well knowen vnto the Lord concerning his house: in his sleepe there appeared vnto him a ladder, the foote whereof stood on the earth, but the top did reach vnto the heauens, by which the angels did ascend and descend, and the Lord leaning on the top of this ladder, said vnto him.
am the Lord the God of thy father Abraham and thy father Isaac, the land in which thou art now will giue thee, and to thy seed, and thy seed shall bee as the dust of the earth.
Thou shalt increase from the East to the West, fro~ the North to the South, and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.
When Iacob awaked out of his sleepe, he said, of a truth the Lord is in this place, knew not: and trembling he said further.
how terrible is this place? this is none other place, but euen the house of God, and the gate of heauen.
Forthwith rising in the morning, hee tooke the stone which lay vnder his head all night, and rearing it an ende, he powred oile vppon it: making a vow and saying: if the Lord will bee with mee &c. the Lord shall be my God, and this stone which haue here set an ende, shalbe called the house of God.
and will giue him the tenth of all the encrease which hee shall giue me.
After the sparks of heauenlie fire new kindled in the breast of the holie patriarch: the flame brake forth at his mouth, and so fructified together with his true pietie, that afterwards hee was wonderfull rich in seruants, goods, and cattel, in beeing a ioyfull father of manie liuing to a good olde age, seeing his childrens children, laying his hand on them, that which passeth all, though his graundfather Abraham did make an alter in the same place, proceeding to offer the bloud of his onelie sonne vnto the Lord (which was a perfect figure of Christ) yet the latter light did shine the clearer, and the Lord did so multiplie the blessings promised to Abraham in his sonnes Isaac and Iacob, that long before the time of the reuelation of that holie one, to him and in him, he vncouered the vale so much, that he shewed his louing regard to his elect here vppon earth, in looking downe on Iacob, and leaning on the ladder, in sending his Angels vp and downe to his patriarch, full of grace.
Who when his eies were open, and he did see as it is said: Gratia gratiam peperit.
For to the end that hee and his posteritie might more easilie clime this ladder, and for our example hee trembled when hee perceyued that the Lord was there, hee gaue the title, and ioyned the reuerence thereunto: saying, out of all doubt, this is the house of God, and the gate of heauen: concluding, it shall be called the house of God.
Which his zealous speech and dooings, condemne the fruitelesse zeale of our age, for when hee perceiued that hee was once in the house of God, with a reuerent feare hee trembled.
Not dispairing, but beleeuing in heart, hee looked vp: confessing with the mouth, hee promised and perfourming in deede, hee reared vp the corner stone, on which euen in the same place, the holie temple of the Lord, euen in the Temple of Ierusalem, was afterwards built: which though it was refused of the cunning builders, in latter times, yet beeing once annointed with holy oile, it became the head stone of the corner.
If the Lord did so woonderfullie blesse the patriarch Iacob in his true faith and perfect zeale, that of one sma hee raised the most holie, the most honourable, the most sumptuous, the most rich and costlie Temple in the whole world.
Let no good Christian doubt, to lay though it bee but one stone in the Colledge, the Church, the Temple of the Lord, acknowledging with Saint Paul, that, Non est volentis, non est currentis sed miserentis Dei.
It is not hee which willeth, or hee which runneth, but God which sheweth mercie.
It is not wee which do it, but the grace of God which is in vs. Which if it once beginne to spring, and shew it selfe in the woorke, laie waight enough on it, for it will rise mauger the might of all the world.
Hee which hath laied the greatest foundation in the lowest element, the highest glorie in the lowest places: which confoundeth the strength of this world with his weaknes, which putteth downe the mightie from their seat, and exalteth the humble meeke: of his abundant mercie hee will magnify the charitie of the poore Widowe, though it bee but a mite: he will make the building strong though it bee founded on a cuppe of could water.
Those which loue his spouse, hee will blesse their seede here vpon earth, with plentie of peace, and glorifie them in his heauenlie lerusalem.
This blessing is seldome obscure or vnseene amongest the sonnes of GOD: neither doth it cease from generation to generation.
For if wee looke backe vnto this litle sparke, wee shall see and saie with the prophet Dauid, that the fire was kindled in Iacob, and the flame broke forth in Israel, not for weekes or yeares, or hundred yeares onlie (though it was suppressed in that watrish Aegipt) but it shined so cleare out of the darke Cloude in the wildernesse, that the arke was there built by the hande of his great messengers Moses and Aaron.
Neither could the desartes of Synaie or sinne, or the exceeding high hilles of all the mountaine countrey, restraine the course thereof, but it passed ouer the toppes of the highest mountaines, it diuided the deepest waters of that Countrey, passing on drye lande, throw the bottom thereof into that promised land, the land of Canaan.
When the Arke (the true figure of the Temple) was by the prouidence of almightie GOD, thus brought, and placed neere the propper home.
And Dauid also the seruaunt of the Lord, taken from the sheepefowlde, preserued from the tyrannie of Saul, and placed in his kingdome.
Now for our example let vs marke howe this holie place, and godlie King accord together, and what effect there is betwixt them.
The Arke hauing bene long before neglected by Saul (which appeared by his ende) Dauid hee had a speciall eie and regarde vnto it: before all other thinges, with great strength, power glorie, bringing it from the house of Abinadab neerer him.
'First placing it in the house Obededom, and afterwardes, seeing the great blessinges which the Lorde shewed to that place where his Arke stoode, he brought it home into the Citie of Dauid, placing it in the tabernacle which hee had built for it.
Afterwardes when hee had conquered all his enemies round about, and he sate quietly in his pallace, hee followed not the swelling humour of flesh bloud, which ruleth most in those that are the lowest born, and the basest minded, according to that auncient saying: Asperius nihil est humili cum surgit in altum: but that which is the dutie of a godly prince, hee called the prophet Nathan vnto him and saide.
Do you not marke howe dwell in my sumptuous house of Cedar, and the Arke of the Lord is simply couered with skins? shewing that it was not meete that the house of the king, or of anie man, should bee more faire, more sumptuous, more honourable and maiesticall, than the house of God.
And therefore hee purposed fully with himselfe, to builde a temple vnto the Lorde, which hee hath perfourmed with dutifull endeuour in good time, but that the Lord by the mouth of his holy prophet signified, that his good intent was accepted, and therefore the Lorde would blesse him on all sides, promising that hee would giue him peace and rest, from his enemies, that he would place him quietlie in his owne pallace, and when his yeares were come to an ende, and that hee should after the manner of the godly sleepe with his fathers, the Lord promised that hee would raise vp a sonne vnto him, in whome he would establish the kingdome of Dauid for euer, and which should builde an holie temple vnto the Lord God of Israell.
Heere vppon the kinglie Prophet did magnifie the Lord in his soule, and his spirite did so hartelie reioyce in the wonderfull mercies of his creatour, that hee lifte vp his voyce before the Lorde, and penned manie Godlie himnes, to bee musicallie and melodiouslie sunge, by the chaunter and the quire, before the Lord.
He yeelded his whole heart vnto the Lord, and gaue vnto him the first fruites of his lippes.
Therefore the Lord blessed him with a vertuous sonne, euen the wise Salomon, whose workes were lyke vnto the wisedome of his heart: shewinge plainelie vnto vs, the worke and fruite of true and perfecte wisedome, and what is that? As hee was the wisest man that euer was created so he brought foorth the best and happiest fruite that euer was: building an holie temple vnto the honour and seruice of the Lord, and that such a one, as farre surpassed, all the superstitious temples of the heathen.
Hee set manie thousandes of men a worke at once, hee prouided the goodliest timber that could bee seene or heard off, the fairest squared stones that might bee, and of greatest price.
His ships went to Tharsis for golde, and hee spared not to spende the iewels of Arabie, on the same.
He erected therin great of beaten gold siluer, gilding it on euerie side, and garnishing it most
He finished it most perfectlie, he frequented the same with his deuout praiers dailie to the glorie of God, the profitre of his nation, the publique practise of the lawe and sacrifice of the Lord.
All the daies of his life, hee enioyed it most happilie, though by infirmitie hee fell, yet ye Lord remembring his mercie, let him depart in peace, so that hee slept with his fathers, and was buried in the cittie of Dauid: and Roboam his son raigned in his steede.
King of the Persians, though he were an heathen man, yet hee yeelded so much vnto the true God, that hee released his chosen people out of captiuitie, saying: the Lord of heauen who hath made mee Lord ouer the whole earth, hee hath commaunded mee, to builde him an house in Ierusalem.
Though hee was an heathen, and cheefe ruler ouer all the worlde: yet hee disobayed not the heauenlie voyce, sending Zorobabell the cheefe of the Iewes, proclaming, that it might bee lawfull for anie of those, which were in captiuitie, to goe home and to helpe vp the buildinge of the house of the Lord: bringing out the golden vesselles, which Nabuchodonozer brought from the temple of Ierusalem, and yeelding them all into the handes of Zorobabell, and the rest whome hee sent vnto Ierusalem to builde vp the wasted temple, giuing them great freedome, authoritie and store of golde, of filuer, of worke men, and all kinde of suppliance what so euer.
After this his religious bountie towardes the temple of the Lorde, hee had great battailes against the Kinge of Babilon, and manie other mightie Princes: against whome the Lorde gaue him so great and so good successe, that after he had ouercome the rich and strong king Craesus king of Babilon, and that most mightie magnificent famous Cittie, which manie other most puissant Princes, hee alone was cheefe ruler of the Assirians, the Medes, the Persians: beeing the first erector, of the second Monarch, of the worlde.
Wherein wee see most plainelie the great care and dilligent eye, which the Lorde hath vnto his temple, in that hee commaunded Cyrus to reedifie it: and the good successe which followeth those, which helpe to builde the same: Especiallie if they perseuer in theyr good deuotion vnto the ende.
But if after they haue begunne to worke in the spirite, they incline themselues to fulfill the desire of their fleshlie eye: Let them knowe though they obtaine most excellent victories and high renowne in the battaile, though they be placed ouer many kingdomes, and haue obtained the height of theyr desire, in what they can wishe in this worlde: yet after all this, shall succeede the infamous death of Cyrus, who with his exceeding great armie was ouercome in the feelde.
And good cause whie, sith (as Plato writeth) hee sinned much in bringing vppe his children wantonlie, commaunding his owne brother to be slaine very treacherouslie.
Let no man presume so much as to doubte that there is a God the rewarder of the iust and punisher of the wicked: that so mercifull on the one part, and so perfectlye iust on the other, that of his exceeding mercie, hee rewardeth the least good deede of vs sinfull wretches, and punisheth euerie sinne whatsoeuer, (vnleast we doe hartelie repent and turne our selues truelie vnto his mercy) which we commit against his diuine maiesty.
Howe commeth it to passe, that we are become like horse and mule, which haue no vnderstanding? If the carter doe but wagge his whippe, the horses, hie on apace: if the shepheardes dogge doe but barke, the sheepe doe whirrie all on heapes: if the lion roare, the beastes of the forrest tremble.
And yet the Lord calleth dailie and hourelie by signes from heauen, by fiers in the ayre, by strang courses in the waters, by vnnaturall monsters in the earth, by losse in the fielde, and by scarefire in the house, by sicknesse in the bodie, by the denouncing of death to our soules: and no man trembleth, no man runneth, no man looketh vp, no man once regardeth it.
Doe you marueile why your greefe lasteth daie and night, and your disseases bee vncurable, sith you haue such great store of honour and wealth, to ease your minde which poore men wante? they want them both in deede, and fith they seldome taste the meate, the Lorde of his mercie seldome offereth them the sower sawce, belonging to such daintie dishes.
Therfore let al men leaue theyr wandering thoughtes of fancie, of chaunce, ill lucke, wicked men, euill mindes, deceitfull hartes: Non est malum in ciuitate, quod non fecit dominus, there is no chaunce or fortune in regard of God, neither hath the wicked any power to hurte, but where the Lord shall permit, and hee permitteth not without deserte.
There is no deserte without sinne, no sinne without punishment: no punishment without deserued paine, vnleast wee repent, no repentaunce without sufficient restitution, as much as lyeth in vs.
Therefore thou which art stronge, meruaile not that thou art wounded of the weake, whose heart perhappes is greater then thine.
Thou which art riche and farest daintelie, meruaile not that thou lyest sicke, pininge, consuming, groning, with the palsey in thy heade, the burning in thine heart, the Ciatica in thy hippes, the stone in the the goute in the thy toe, thine arme, or thy legge, the burning ague through thy whole bodie.
Thou which art mightie wise and honourable, merueile not if thou beest brought vnder: if thy foolish doinges breede the repentaunce with discredite.
Thou which hast honour and riches, dominions, and power, health and Phisitions, credite and successe, at thy will, meruaile not though thou want children, or hauing one onely child, which is all thy ioye: when he is taken away by vntimely death.
Say not to thy selfe, what ill fortune is this, that hauing one onely childe in whome ioyed, hee should bee thus taken from mee, neither weepe so bitterlie for thy naturall childe.
yee sonnes of the earth weepe not for your children but weepe for your selues, and your owne sinnes against God.
Knowe yee right well, that who so euer maketh his ioye of anie thing, prouideth for anie thing, honoureth anie thinge, more or in comparison of the Lord: eyther hee shall not enioye it, or it shall not enioye him.
This is the Maior, and the Minor is like vnto it, which is this.
There is no aduersitie, what so euer commeth to vs, but it is for our sinnes, though not the thousande parte which wee deserue, but as it were a philip, in respecte of the cutting off of the heade.
If wee will but turne our eyes from the vaine cloude of worldlie follie and confusion, we shall see most plainelie, that there is no sickenesse, no vntimelie death, no losse of Parentes or children, no imprisonmentes, no aduersitye what so euer, but it is sent of the Lord for our sinne, and on the contrarie, that the Lorde is so full of goodnesse and loouing mercie, that hee continuallie blesseth euerie good deede of ours what so euer, and that by his continuall mercies, shewed vnto them which loue him, and his holy temple, where his name is to bee praised to the worldes ende.
Wee may see it plainelie amongest the heathen, that the Lorde is iust in remembring his promised mercies, to all them which feare him, and say also with that holie Prophet: Verely there is a rewarde for the iuste? not for the Iewe onelie, or the Christian onelie, or for this nation, this degree, this sorte or kinde of men onelie: but as saint Peter affirmeth, there is no acception of persons with God: but in euerie nation who so euer feareth the Lorde a right, and worketh righteousnesse, he is accepted in the sight of God.
Let all men therefore learne to feare the Lorde aright, let them open the fountaine of theyr charitable compassion towardes theyr brethren, especiallie towardes his holie temple.
At the least let not vs be more vnkind vnto the spouse of Christ then were the heathen.
Looke backe againe, to that highe mountaine, from whence wee are newlie discended.
Cyrus began to builde the temple of the Lorde, and hee prospered wonderfullie: hee forgatte the Lord, and hee came to an euill ende.
Darius also succeeded him, who finished the building of the temple, begunne by Cirus, willing his lordes and captaines beyonde the floude, that in anie wise they should not hinder the Iewes in theyr building.
But that if they wanted stone, or timber, or siluer, or golde, calues, goates, kiddes, salte, oyle, or wine, they should let them haue all thinges at theyr will, shewing therein his good minde, and the cheefest vse of these worldlie goods in these wordes: Vt offerant deo coeli oblationes, orentque pro vita regis filiorum eius.
That they maie offer vp oblations to the God of heauen, and praie for the life of the King and his children.
It is verie straunge and worthy to be let vp as a mirour before the eyes of all Christian princes, that these heathen Emperours, should attribute so much to the glory of God hearing but a far off, seing his mighty maiesty but in a cloude.
What may be compared to that which followeth in the stile and wordes of Artaxerxes written after this manner? Artaxerxes rex regum, &c. Artaxerxes King of Kinges, &c. Vnto the most learned scribe of the law of the God of heauen.
haue decreede that of Israell in my kingdomes and dominions, who so will goe with thee vnto Ierusalem, that hee haue free libertie to goe: and what golde or money thou desirest in the whole prouince of Babylon, take it to buye Sacrifice to bee offered in the house of your God in Ierusalem, take also the vesselles which are giuen thee to serue in the house of your God: in fine what so euer is thought meete or necessarie for the furnishing of the house of God, let it be allowed you out of the Kinges treasure.
Artaxerxes the King, haue commaunded all mine officers beyond the floude, that they giue Esdras what hee will demaunde, &c.
Furthermore charge you straightly, that you exacte no tribute or paiment, or exaction, or any other taxe, or incumbraunce what so euer, of the Preestes, Leuits, Singers, Officers, or seruauntes of this temple.
Neither that you vpbraide them, or obiect anie kinde of disgrace against them.
that the Christian Princes of our time, would but looke a little vnto the vnfayned looue, which those heathen Monarches shewed to the God of heauen, and his holy temple.
would they did not onely possesse the name of Christ and loue of his church, but that in euery particular law, in euery action, in euery deede of liberalitye, it might plainely appeare before ye face of God man their first and chiefest loue is the prosperitie of the church of Iesu Christ: and not onely the generall name of profession, but that after the example of those heathen kinges, they would loue it indeed, and the ministers thereof, that they would giue wood stone, yron and lead, gold, and siluer, to the building of the Lordes house, to the celebrating of his diuine seruice, to the good and honourable maintaining of his ministers.
And not only in making general laws, which may seeme to acknowledge this calling to be good, nor in taking, but in giuing to the Lorde, and the maintenance of his holie worship, the first fruits of their harts and mindes, which is more than can briefly comprehend.
Neither should this charitie bee shut vp onely in the heart, but the fountaines thereof (if it be right) are oftentimes so pierced with the finger of God, that the riuers of this charitable and heauenly oyle, runneth downe not onely into the church it self, but into the bosomes and bones of the officers, the singers, the porters, and the lowest minister of the church, in such sorte, that no vniust lawe, commission, payment, punishment or incumbrance whatsoeuer, shall hinder them from their, good, lawfull, and daily administration in the Church of God.
And if they should: yet if the crie of the poore disciple of Iesu Christ once come to the princes eare: no doubt he sitting in the place of God, will also breake out saye in the person of God: touch not mine annointed: but let them be free, for the Lord which placed mee in my throne, hee hath put the worde in my mouth.
Haue not said it? it is written in the volume of his booke, that should doe his will, and shall not come? he hath commaunded, and shall not obey? hee hath alwaies blessed those which loued his temple, and shall not be partaker of the same? This blessing aboue all others of the Lorde, is so manifest, that euerie nation, euerie kindred, yea euen the heathen if they haue but a little sparke of the reuerence of his holie name, they haue greatly prospered therwith.
It was the manner of the auncient Graecians, to builde temples, and amongst all other they solemnized the temple of Apollo, endowing it with great honours, freedome, landes and possessions, after which customable beneuolence, shewed vnto their God, they prospered so greatlye, more than they were woont, that they woonne manie great battailes against the Persians, with such exceeding glorie, that they did rise to the thirde Monarcke of the whole worlde: most highly esteeming of the of their God, and that in such reuerence, that in no wise they would take the least iotte from the same, though it were for sauing of a kingdome.
This appeareth plainely by Alexander the great, who was wisely instructed of Aristotle, after the manner of the Philosophers, that he should first feare God, and aboue all thinges keepe his hands from the spoile of temples dedicated to the Gods.
Therefore when hee wanted frankensence to sacrifice, hee would not take it out of the temple at home, or exact it of Apolloes Priestes (who had great store) but after greate warres and manie honourable exploites, hee brought it out of farre countries: and then bestowed it in sacrificing most plentifully, saying; that to the Gods hee would not bee a niggard.
With this good minde he prospered both by sea and by land, his power was mightie, his conquests manie, his name great, euen Alexander the great mightie Monarcke of the Grecians.
Shall goe forwardes as haue begun, discussing the course of times, the succession of kingdomes, and the good successe of those which indeede haue loued the Church? or is there anie which doubteth of the great blessinges which followe them and their seede, who builde and bestowe liberally on the house of God: and the grieuous curses which fall on them which do the The alwaies obserued this rule, that aboue all other thinges, they begunne with the reuerence of their Gods, their temples, their sacrifices, and both in peace and warre, their chiefest end was the maintaining of the same.
Ianus was the first that made temples to the Gods in Italie, appointing sacrifices and other rites therevnto belonging.
And therefore as Tullie saith, in sacrifices, hee is alwaies remembred in the beginning of their praiers.
Such as hee sowed, such did hee reape, for the posterity much celebrated his memorie for this fact, built a most solemn temple in his name.
By which religious mind, they thought that they flourished more in peace, and had greater victories in the warres, than anie other people.
In which their exceeding great victories, according to the rites and religion of their nation, they imitated that well disposed Alexander the great, who hauing woon the citie of Thebes, sackt it to the ground, destroying, captyuating, and banishing of the inhabitantes thereof aboue
Hee spared none saue onelie the priestes of that citie, those which were strangers there of Macedonia, and all the kindred of that learned poet Pyndarus.
Much like to this was that of the Romanes, who when they had conquered that faire auncient Citie Alba: they destroyed all the buildinges thereof, saue onely the temples and churches: beeing afraid least if they should take anie thing from the temples of the gods, they should thereby make them their enemies, and so not onlie they should come to some but also their whole common wealth should bee brought to vtter ruine and destruction.
That this was their resolute religious opinion, it appeareth in sundry places of their histories.
For when Tullus Hostillius had conquered the Sabynes, destroied all the faire buildings of that citie, and caried the people thereof vnto Rome) as it is plainly shewed in that historie) onely the churches remained vntouched, and vnuiolated, as holy houses on which they durst not presume to lay their handes: which reuerence done to the religious houses of the gentils, sith it was done by the aforenamed king it seemed that it rather proceeded of the wise pollicie, and rule of regiment, left to him by that worthie ruler Numa Pompilius his predecessor, then of anie great deuotion which hee had towardes the gods or their holie temples, in that it is written of him, that hee accounted nothing lesse honourable or princely, then to apply himselfe to the honor of religion.
Therfore his fierce, wild, desperate mind: was so daunted and throughlie pierced with deadlie agony, and shaking fare, that of a neglector of religion, and religious houses, sodainly he left all other matters whatsoeuer, most earnestlie and superstitiouslie fulfilling euen the least ceremonies of their religion.
But because hee became religious rather for feare than for loue (through the wrath of God) hee and his house together were burned, and cleane consumed with lightning from heauen.
So farre were the people of that age from spoiling the temples of their owne gods, that when they conquered any nation, they feared to laie handes on the temples or anie other thing.
Nay it seemed to them great sacriledge a thing alwaies punished by God to alter or translate the holie rites, or anie thing thereunto belonging, as appeareth in the same historie.
After Tullus had conquered the Sabynes, sacked their citie, beeing now in his maiestie, replenished with honor all kind of kinglie abundance: of a sodaine, newes came to the court that it rained stones in the mount Albaine.
Whither when they had sent messengers and found it so, there was also a voice heard in the mount crying aloud, and saying, that Albines should vse their owne Countrie Religion which they had left, when they left their temples behinde them desolate, and lost their countrey.
With this the Romanes were also much moued, so that for memorie of this they appointed certaine solemne feast daies.
Nether was this religious minde onely proper to the Romanes, who in this point of all people were most religious.
But common also to other people, euen by the law and instinct of nature, as appeareth by the legats of Locris sent to the Senate of Rome who (as it is partlie recorded of Celsus of Verona, after manie great iniuries and violences offered to them and their Countrie, they repeated this as the chiefest, saying.
There is one thing (O worthie senate) of which euen that Religion, which nature hath infixed in euerie mans minde doth will vs to complaine: wee know right well how deuoutlie and ceremoniouslie you embrace, not onelie your owne gods, but how fauourably you entreate and vse the gods of other nations.
Amongest other his abhominable facts, your Legat Pleminius did take away the treasure of this Temple, hee shipped it and hoisted vp saile, but the winde blew, the tempestes did arise, the waues tossed, the surges fomed, the sea roared in such sort, that the shippes were violentlie reuersed to the shore from which they went, and spletted on the sands, where the treasure was found, and restored to the temple againe.
Nether did anie thing euer prosper which he took in hand after that deed, so that being driuen from Italie, he entring Greece, in the night, he died a shameful, an vnlucky death.
After this, your legat and the tribunes of soldiers, presumed so far also as to laie violent handes on the treasure belonging to the same temple, therewith defiling themselues and their houses.
Which fact (o worthie Senate) vnlesse you will by your religious mind reforme, without doubt ye shal haue no good succesie in your affairs either in Italie or in Affrick: but their bloud shall bee spilt, and your common wealth hazarded also in lue of that fact.
And to saie the truth euen at this instant, the wrathful reuengement of the goddesse doth light vpon your captains soldiers: we our selues hane lately seen how they run violently together with banners displayed one part against another: the captaine of one part is Pleminius, of the other the two tribunes.
Thus they dailie fight together most cruelly, most barbarouslie, most deadlie.
Many of the soldiers be oft in a phrensy: think you that the goddes hath let the captains goe scotfree? no she punisheth them surely.
The Tribunes were, take~ by the Legat, whipped with rods.
Also the Legat at length apprehended by the pollicie of the Tribunes, his bodie all rent, and torn with sundrie torments, his nose his ears cut off: he was left bleeding almost to the death.
Afterwardes the Legat recouering cast the Tribunes into prison, whipping scourging them stocking and tormenting them, with most vile punishments fit for roges and rascals, he put them to death, forbidding any ma~ to burie them.
These be the punishments which the Goddes hath sent on the spoilers of hir temple.
Nether wil she cease to torment them all and euerie of them with innumerable plagues and punishments, til the treasure take~ from her temple be restored to it againe.
This was the speach of the Legats of Locris vnto the senat of Rome: which sheweth plainly, that as wel the Gretians as the Romans counted it a wicked thing to diminish or take ought fro~ the temple of the gods of the nations.
Nay they themselues not onely tooke this wise and sure way in the establishing of their but also in euerie particular action whatsoeuer: they had a special eye regard vnto the Gods, their religion, their reuerence, their worship, their temples.
And surely if we looke into the Romane histories we may see most plainly, that they obserued the rule of their owne Poet, Ioue principium musae, they first of all regarded the temples of their Gods, and then their
By which safe rule they conquered east by Pompey, and farre west by Iulius Caesar: who at the first was most of all men in that age, addicted to the maintaining of temples their Gods.
Whereby hee did gather such strength, and rose so high, that neither Prince nor king could retyre the force of his army, or subdue him in the battaile.
Till at the length, through daily practise of shedding bloud, by force of armes, his heart was so hardened, that vnnaturally he drew out his sworde, and lifte vp his armes against his owne country, from whence he had his chiefe beginning.
But afterwardes when he had helde foorth his swoorde against his mother (which gaue him it first into his handes) and had dissolued the most famous and renowned state of the Romane Senate, and by force made himselfe Emperour or Rome.
That which is the desteny of all worldly felicitie, the Lorde yeelded him vp to a most famous death, beeing stabbed by the handes of those wise and auncient Senatours.
Why doe you reason thus within your selues against a plaine truth, ioyned most narrowlie with your owne soules health, saying these bee examples of Iewes Gentils? If the matter bee doubtfull and ambiguous, why do you not rather help to confirm this true conclusion, sithens the open display therof is the great glorie of God, and the benefite of his church? will you that proue the true leuel of mine ayme, and that draw foorth this line, from Persia in the east, vnto England in the west, seioyned from the continent of the whole world? The Iewes they requested our sauiour Christ, most instantly, that hee would reuiue the Centurions seruaunt, saying that he was worthie of that good turne, for he had loued their nation, had built them a synagogue.
Which good works because they proceeded from a perfect faith (as appeared afterwards by the approbation of our sauiour the Lorde did not forget him in the day of his sorrow, and most bountifully remembred his faithfull deuout deeds.
Afterwards though many yeares, the sunne of the Gospel, was darkened with the manifold stormes, and clowdy tempests of persecution: yet when it began to reflect the cleare beames on the top of the highest mountaines of the earth, to illuminat the hart of that holy renowned Emperour Constantine the great, the sun waxed warm, the fields were pleasant, the soile was fruitful, the seed of the Gospell of Christ sprong vp apace in sundry sortes: so that this godly Emperor, though he could not come to the beholding of the sun himselfe, yet hee receiued the brightnes of his shining beames, so clearely in at his eye, and shut them so page duplicate] page duplicate] secretly in his heart, that in perfect zeale he shewed his louing heart vnto the Christians: hee stretched foorth his handes, and most hartily embraced the poore orphane Christians, dispersed, persecuted, weakened, discomfited.
Hee nursed and nourished them, he called them togither into one place, knowing that vnited vertue is the stronger.
He gaue them the milke of good and wholesome councell, willing them in the name of God to foresee what was the truth, to seeke that, to discusse that, with one consent to conclude that, he with all his wil power would ratifie the same.
After that the iointes of this little infant began to knit, and councell waxed riper in the head, he supplied stronger meats, he gaue the~ libertie of calling a generall councell, hee supplyed with yearely commodities the wants of those which had illuminated his hart, with the glad tidings of the God of heauen: after innumerable great charges, gifts, endowments, bestowed on the church (that which is an example for all Christian princes) hee spent all his time in meditating vpon the law of the Lorde, in studiyng deuising howe hee might promote the religion true faith of Iesu Christ.
Herein considering that we cannot possesse our soules in this life, without bodies, nor bodies without meate, nor meate without money, nor money vnlesse it bee giue~: with great ioy loue he laid the fou~dations of many faire temples, raising the~ an exceeding great height, in the honour of Christ; endowing them with great store of lands and possessions, therewith giuing great freedome vnto those places, and all the ministers of Christ, to whome they belonged.
Hee built a verie solemne and sumptuous temple, in the place where our sauiour did rise againe, commaunding that it should farre passe all other temples of the worlde in exceeding faire walles and marble pillers, adorning it within most richly, with princely ornamentes, more sumptuous than can bee expressed in a fewe wordes: adding thereto solemne monuments of gold, siluer, and almost infinite numbers of pretious stones.
Neither was his loue as is the loue of man, soone hote and soone colde: or as is the loue of these latter daies, in which wee surely looke for the greate day of doome: but hee proceeded in building and founding of temples, and religious places, for the maintaining of the poore disciples of Iesu Christ.
At Bethlem also where our sauiour was borne, hee builded a temple, and that at the motion of that deuoute woman the Ladye Helina the Empresse his mother: who being endued with special graces from heauen, ascended high after the steppes of Christ on the toppe of Mount Olyuet (from whence he ascended vp into heauen) euen in the very top thereof, founding a sanctuarie for the Church of Christ, and at the bottome of the same mount, in that place where our sauiour was woont to resorte with his Disciples, shee erected a verie fayre Church, shewing vnto her sonne the waye wherein hee should walke: not onely in founding temples for the woorship of the Lorde, but in giuing vnto the poore, in redeeming captiues, in clothing the naked with hir owne hands, in visiting the poore sicke Christians.
The cleare candle which this vertuous woman held in her hand, gaue such light vnto the most worthie Emperour her sonne, that imediatly after his mothers death hee builded temples in all prouinces, making them much more faire than they were before.
Also he built many faire and sumptuous temples in Constantinople, he retired backe againe into Asia euen to Nicomedia, the first and chiefest citie in Bithinia, where he built an exceeding large temple, and no lesse beautifull; adioyning to it on all sides verie high and faire Cloisters, within he erected a sanctuarie of an infinit height, being in forme with verie huge pillers, sumptuous arches, bossinges and monumentes, all adorned with great plentie of gold, brasse and other pretious mettell.
Though the church of Christ and his profession was now but yong amongest the gentils: yet he had a special regard to the faithful patriarches of old.
He looked farre backe, and sith his sight was good hee beheld his forefather Abraham, remembring that heauenlie apparation of the holie, blessed and glorious Trinitie vnder the oke of the valley of Mambrie: vnto the patriarch (for a monument) he commaunded a faire Church to be built in the same place, reedified all the decayed Temples and monumentes, building them verie high, and faire, destroying the Idols of the gentils, pulling downe their altars, vtterlie defacing their superstitious religion, and all other worldly states whatsoeuer were a hindrance or disgrace to the church of Christ.
It is plainle shewed by the ecclesiastical writers, that so soone as hee had ouercomed the enemies of the Church, hee imployed himselfe and all which hee could do, by word, by worke, by letter and example to reedifie the churches of the christians, or else to build them new, leauing a most perfect patterne behinde him, which all true christians ought to behold.
When hee had vanquished his enemies, all the world ouer, and was placed in the throne of the empire, with great honor, triumph, glorie, maiestie, abundance of health, of wealth, of libertie to commaund what he list: he did not swell in his hart, with pride, but in all humilitie fell downe before the crosse of Christ Iesus yeelding himselfe Christ his soldier, vnder whose banner this most renowmed Emperour marched forwarde.
Hee was not so base minded, as to looke about him how hee might raise great summes from the poore people, or how hee might vnder some good pretence, exact some paiment from the church, though his enemies were manie mighty, his warre great, his troubles innumerable, his charges infinite: yet hee did not molest any one person belonging to the church, nether would he suffer the mightiest of his princes, once to meddle with them.
He could not possiblie be perswaded to increase his treasure with any penny which came from the Church, or his honour, with their prerogatiue, or his securitie with their trouble, or his credit with their disgrace.
But this foster father of the poore dispersed lambs of Iesu Christ: he bestowed, he founded, he erected, on high, he reedified those temples which the heretickes had pulled downe: hee restored the landes which they had taken awaie: when hee tooke it into his handes, he did not giue one halfe to God, kept the other halfe to himselfe, saying: haue two eies, the one to looke to my kingdome, and the other to the church: But beeing a good true christian philosopher, hee knew, that though wee haue two eies, yet we must looke but one way, nor see but one marke at once.
We cannot at once loue both God and Mammon, sinne and righteousnesse, the kingdome of this world, and heauen.
But hee knew it truelie, and wayed it wisely in his hart, that the high God of heauen did create him, that hee blessed him, preserued him, exalted him, gaue him all that he had.
And therefore hee rendred vnto him and his beloued spouse, all honor, freedome, peace, and abundance.
Hee was taught by the holie fathers out of the booke of life, that the Lord is a ielous God, he will not part stakes with any, nor giue his honor to any other: but of him it is said, and of him onelie: Thine is thy kingdome, thy power, and thy glorie for euer and euer, Amen.
When the good Emperour beheld this perfect stile of Iesu Christ, did see the ensigne, on which it was described, together with the church of Christ cast downe to the bare earth: hee drawing neere as S. Paul did to the altar, wherein was written ignoto deo: beholding but foure bare letters I. N. R. I. which signified that this was the ensigne of the vnknowen God, not acknowledged amongest men: forthwith hee humbled himselfe in the flesh, and reioiced in the spirit, that the vnknowen God, the God of heauen of earth, had vouchsafed him that speciall grace to reueale himselfe vnto him.
He cast downe his banner and tooke vp the crosse of Iesu Christ crucified: hee cast all dignities, courts, commissions and kingdomes aside, and laid his honor in the dust, in regard of the true honor of Iesus Christ, (as wee haue mentioned) hee imploied all the giftes which hee had giuen him, euen of mind, bodie and goods, especially in founding, erecting, beautifying, perfecting, adorning, priuiledging, and freeing the church of Christ: as Eusebius testifyeth most plainlie in these words: Ecclesias vero Dei, incredibile est supra omnem opinionem, &c.
It is incredible, and far beyond all mens opinions to recount what giftes and ornamentes hee bestowed on the church of God, what freedome, what plentie of maintenance, what honors he gaue to them which had wholy bent the~selues to serue the Lord in his holy temple, daily to pray for the safety of the lande, for the honour of the King, and the sinnes of the people.
This was the expressed pietie of that first and most Christian Emperour, and the Lord of his great mercie redoubled his kindnesse euen into his bosome: for hee not onely shewed him the scale which Iacob saw, and the gate of heauen opened at the top therereof: but hee gaue him that great and rare gift of perseuerance in his deuout deedes, euen vnto the end.
Therfore the Lord blessed him in his pallace, in the field, fro~ the arow which flieth in the wars abroad and from false friends at home, and in such plentiful manner, that all things which he tooke in hande did prosper wonderfully.
His victories are compared with the conquests of Cyrus, but his end was much more happie, for when he had most honourablye passed the full course of the life of man, enioyed all the blessings of the earth, aboue the space of sixtie yeares, not once troubled with any sicknesse of bodie or vexation of minde, but in wisedome and true christian loue, florished continuallye like the greene bay tree, whose fruite doth comfort the hart of man: like the spreading vine, like the fat Oliue braunch, which maketh him to haue a ioyfull countenance: sith hee distilled these sweete drops of his sincere loue, into the bosomes of the poore distressed christians of his daies: the Lord he kindled the sparke of true christian loue in his heart, and made him glad with the ioy of his countenance.
Hee had alwaies victorie against his enemies, conquering from Scythia in the east, to this Ile of Britaine in the west.
Neither was the loue of the Lord extended vnto this good Emperour in his life onely, but to the end all men may knowe that the loue of the Lorde is not fained, that his iustice neuer changeth, that his mercie endureth for euer; hee departed out of this life, being full of yeares in his ripe olde age, euen about the feast of the ascension of our sauiour Christ; and the descension of the holy Ghost, at high noone.
At which instant (his soule leauing the mortall body heere on earth) hee was no doubt receiued vp into heauen, by the hands of immortall angels, there enioying the crowne of eternall blisse.
Which the Lord hath prouided for all those assuredly which looue his comming, and maintaine his holy militant Church heere on earth.
Neither was the reward of the Lord onely proportioned by the merit of man: neither did his munificent mercie, onely exceede the merite of this true christian Emperour, so much as the compasse of the heauens, (whose least starres are much bigger then the lande and sea) exceedeth the earth, in giuing him his hartes desire, (which is eternall blisse and felicitie) but that which the Lord recounteth to Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, for a sure blessing here on earth: he gaue this Godly Emperour, three good and godly sonnes, to vppon his seate after him, neither for one or two liues onely, but as it is written of his posterity, Vt imperii sedes, &c.
That as the Empire discended from his father, vnto him, so by the course and lawe of nature, it was continued vnto his childrens children and their posteritie.
Neither is it all onelie to bee marked, what fruite the braunch beareth in the top, but if we be good simplicians, we will haue recourse vnto the roote, from whence the first life and naturall vertue proceedeth.
Heerein if we consider well and looke more narrowlie into it, wee shall plainely perceiue that these former examples, more nerely concerne our natiue then at the first sight appeareth: sith this is the tree which wee so highlie commend, and we be all branches of the same.
Neither doth this more narrowly co~cerne vs in respect of the cleare fountaine of christianity, which hee opened to vs with his finger, directing the course therof more plentifully into this worthy Iland: but because by bloud, we be descended from the same line and kindred from whence Constantine the great did first spring, (in that the vertuous ladie Helina his mother, was the daughter of king Coell, sometimes king of this noble Iland) let vs contend, not onely to retaine, the true vertue of her noble bloude, but also that we be like minded vnto her, in fasting, in praying, in the giuing to the poore, in redeeming captiues, in setting the bound at liberty, in founding of temples, maintaining them honourablie, which with their bewtiful feete, bring to vs the glad tidings of the Gospell.
Amongest whose excellent vertues that one doth shine most cleere, representeth vnto vs, the expresse image of her vertuous mind: that in all her iournies, beeing either neere or farre of, when so euer she came to a nie cittie or towne, so soone as shee was once alighted, before shee would admitte anie sute or person to her speache, or that she minded anie worldlie affaires: first of all shee would haue recourse vnto the temple of the Lord, there powring out her prayers and petitions before him, bestowing rich iewels, and costlie ornamentes on the Church, and distributing her almes verie liberallie amongest the poore, where so euer shee came.
Wherefore the Lorde of his exceeding mercy, blessed her with a long, a prosperous, and blessed life, giuing her a willing desire, to leaue this wretched world, after shee had passed eightie yeeres in this tedious vale of vanitye.
In which olde age shee called that pearelesse Emperour of the world her sonne, vnto her, holding his hand in hers, she willed him to bestowe all her treasure, and earthlie goods what so euer on good, and godly vses.
Which diuine behest, once passed from out her gratious lippes: she committed her selfe into the handes of God, her bodie died away, Iesu Christ receiuing her blessed soule into his handes.
wonderfull depth of the mercie of God, towardes those which looue him.
ye true christians what so euer, and ye which descend from the bloud and line of that most vertuous Empresse: though now in the olde crooked age of this world, charitie be almost frozen to death, yet let not hardnesse of heart, preuaile so much against nature, that beeing braunches of so worthy a tree, yee should giue no shaddowe, no leaues, no blossomes, no fruite at all to your posterity.
This honorable nurse of the Church, she sprang out of the naturall soile, wherein wee now dwell, her vertuous seede did spreade it selfe, bothe farre and neere, it tooke deepe roote in Thrasia, in Greece, in Iurie, in Italie, in Fraunce, in Germanie, in Spaine, and could the narrow seas restraine the course therof, from her first natiue soyle, Naturae sequitur semina quisque suae, that which is bredde in the bone will neuer leaue the fleshe, and the bountifull sowing of this vertuous Ladies seede, brought foorth a plentifull haruest, in England some taste whereof dothe sweeten the mouthes of some, comforteth the hartes of others at this daie.
If yee bee not mooued, with the discouerie of so fruitefull a vine, which first did spring foorth of English soile, and hath spred it selfe ouer all christian nations, yelding pleasaunt iuyce and comfortable to the hartes of all true christians.
If you counte not of these examples, which at this daie present themselues, before your eyes, through the glasse of other mens rising and falling: If your owne euils will not mooue you, because they be familiar: then once againe do but loke backe vnto this mother vine, let the roote alone, nowe marke the passage of her bows, the goodly spreading of her branches: and you shall see manie fayre, well plumped clusters of grapes, which though thou canst not reache, yet disdaine not to beholde the fruitfulnes of the vine.
Though it growe beyond the seas, yet giue it the due commendation: though the roote thereof bee founded in simplicitie, yet it beareth holesome beries in the toppe: though the Lord thereof was derided with a crowne of simple thornes: Yet the kings and princes of the earth, did raigne by his permission.
All knees shal bow to him, who was the planter of this vine.
All christian princes shall honour him: and though the wilde Bore haue broke downe the hedge, though he haue spoyled the garden, rooted vp the vine, so that no one braunch therof dooth now appeare: yet the mightiest Emperors will not passe by, no they count more of this wasted peece, then of all the kingdoms in the world.
They wil put of their shooes when they enter it, because it is holy ground: they wil cast down their crownes of golde, from their heades, because in that place it was said before the face of many witnesses, to him whose kingdome endureth for euer.
Therfore Godfrie that worthy Bulliner, the king of Fraunce, after he had won the holy land, being offered a crowne of gold to be set vpon his head, he vtterly refused it, saying: it dooth not become me to weare a crown of gold, where my Lord and sauiour, the Lord of lords, the king of kings, the God of heaue~ earth, did were a crown of thornes.
Herein we may behold the true image of a right noble hart, for if we looke about vs, and beholde the common sorte of base minded men, all their desire is, not so much by vertue and prowes to attaine the victorie (which this noble Godfrie did, first entring the wall himselfe) as to haue the aboundant wealth of the place, the maiesty of the crowne, the glorie of the triumphe.
Of these men it is not so, commonlie said, as truelie verified: he which hath the most shew without, oft times hath least within, truely manie puppies in the world, if they were but a little sequestred, from the pompe and pride which they showe without in glorious manner, themselues were lighter then a feather, which is carried away with euerie blast of winde, when it falleth down, is troden vnder foote.
Therefore because they haue it not within, they are very carefull to magnify themselues, with the outward appearaunce of that maiesty, which in deede they haue not.
These base sorte of men if they had ouerpassed the walles with such good lucke, once beene set on horse backe, they would haue galloped ouer the bodies, of their poore yelding aduersaries, they would haue beene most fierce cruell: they would haue bathed their swords in their bloud, they would haue sought great glory by barbarous cruelty, and their cheefe desire would haue beene, with the golden cote on their backe, the scepter in their hand, the crowne on their head, the applause of the people, to sit in the throne of maiesty.
This did not the noble Godfrie of Bulle~, he did not so, but possessing the true treasure of right valure, and perfect vertue in his hart, he cou~ted not his saftie to stand in the death of his enemies, nor his cheefe possession in worldly riches, nor his honor in glistering show, nor his triumphe in magnificent troupes of noble men, nor his maiestie in a crowne of molten mettal.
This he might haue had, but he would not, si quidem posse nolle nobile, the noble minde ofte may, but wil not.
The vertue of the minde was his possession, and wisedome was his guide, in this famous victorie.
He was studied in bookes of arte and wisedome, hee red the Poet and liked his heroicall verse full well: Sicelides musae, paulo maior a canemus: non omnes arbusta iuuant humilesque myricae.
His minde was great indeede, he could not glorie in fleshly pleasures.
He sawe this famous Cittie, was but a heape of lime and sand, built with the handes of manie poore slauishe workemen, the riches, like glistering poison, infused with the wine into ye cup of gold, the whole kingdome of Iudea, he saw was earthlie, and easie to be won at al times, with a sworde of iron and steele.
Therefore hee counted the glorie of the crowne and scepter but a toye.
And what was that then which hee counted off? euen that for which hee came, by which hee conquered, in which hee meant to dwell.
Not that Ierusalem whose, desolata est, did raise a most sweete pleasaunt note, from the musitions penne: not the figured, but the perfigured, euen the Church of Christ, and also that which is figured by it, the heauenlie Ierusalem, the true holy cittie, the place of eternall rest, of the true glory of perfect triumphe, where hee might safelie and euer saie vnto his owne soule: my soule thou hast marched valiantlie.
Hee counted not of glorie, which riseth out of the earth, and therefore most wisely, he fixed his hart and minde, on true eternitie, which dwelleth onely in the heauens.
Hauing conquered, he did not ascend the chaire of maiestye, that hee might showe himselfe vnto the people, with great glorie: but as that holie and victorious conquerour Henrie the fifte, king of England, when with a fewe thousands of men hee had vanquished Charles the Dolphin of Fraunce strengthened with a royall army (wherein was most of his nobility) he with all his armie kneled downe in the feeld, holding vp his hands to heauen, singing saying, Non nobis Dominenon nobis: sed nomini tuo da gloriam, not vnto vs Lord, not vnto vs, but giue the glory to thy holy name.
Euen so, this worthy conqueror of Ierusalem, though not with the same words, yet with the like deuotion hee humbled himselfe before the Lord: for the space of seuen daies, walking on foote in Ierusale~, beholding the places, where our sauiour Christ was co~uersant, whe~ he liued here on earth, where he was take~, wher he was examined, where he was whipped scourged, despitefully spit on, derided with a reed in his hand a crown of thorns on his head.
The mighty conquerour did behold all these with his eies, and his heart melted within him.
Hee often kneeled down and kissed the places where our sauiour Christ had beene.
With weeping eyes, hee looked vp into the heauens, and his soule desired to see the Lord of light.
That the Lord of his mercie would regard him he daily prayed with great humilitie, liberallye bestowing on the poore· In the place where the temple was, founding a most solemne colledge for religious men, giuing them great and large liuinges: calling them Prebends, building them many faire houses neere vnto the Church, for them to dwell in.
These and innumerable such like, where the fruites of this noble minde, which beeing cleare in the sight of God, of Angels, and of men, the Lord blessed prospered him wonderfully, in so much that in regard of his high prowesse and victorious conquests, to his eternall fame, with all posteritie, he is reputed one of the nine worthies of the world.
The fountaine of this perfect glory did first breake foorth in Fraunce, flying ouer the highest Alpes, euen to Ierusalem, where by the way, if wee will but diuert a little, into Spaine, amongst some good, some bad, we shall see one most excellent famous noble woman, a great freend, true louer of the church.
Serenissima, ac catholica domina, Elizabetha, Hispaniaru~, ac vtriusque Siciliae, ac Ierusalem Regina, &c.
The most vertuous, catholicke lady, Elizabeth Queene of Sapine, Sicily, Ierusalem, &c.
This vertuous woman much like the godly Helina, mother of Constantinus, was so greatly esprised with the loue of Iesu Christ his church so yt shee bent all her muse cogitation, seeking daily diligentlie, how she might beate downe the heathenish power of the Turkes, and infidels, therewith to enlarge the kingdome of Christ, and the dominions of the Christians, to the ende that her vertuous intent might the better prosper, she began this worke with fasting, and often praying, with and founding of many godly temples, not leauing anie worke vndone, which shee thought was acceptable in the sight of God, nor any meanes vntried, which might procure the fauour of Iesu Christ, her louing sauiour.
She turned her euery way, and looked diligently on all sides, howe and where she might best bestow the fruitfull seed of her charitable deuotion: her heart was so enflamed with this heauenly desire, that she could not containe her selfe anie longer in her pallace.
And what followed? with the consent of her princely Ferdinando, shee mustered her men of warre, and gathered together the power of a mightie prince, like the auncient Debora, shee marched forwardes into the kingdome of Granata, the greatest part whereof had beene inhabited by the Ismaelites aboue seuen hundred yeares, defended by them a warlike people continually against the Christians: which kingdom paid tribute to the crowne of Spaine crowns by yeare: she counted not of the force of so huge strong a people, neyther once regarded the greate reuenewe which came into her treasurie that waye.
The winters diuers times were so extreme cold, that her captains soldiers requested her most instantly to breake vp her campe, till a more seasonable time of the yeare: yet she answering that this was the subtiltie of Sathan, to hinder the woorke of the Lord, warred continually for the space of three yeares, till the enemies of Christ cleane ouercome, shee made that whole realme christian, bestowing very liberally on the poore, the maimed, the captiues, the strangers, that were in anie distresse.
In the same realme founding and erecting many goodly churches, colledges, and hospitals, for the poore maymed comfortles people.
Wee may see by the large spreading and plentifull yeeld, that this fruitfull braunch, did spring from Helynaes roote.
For she not onely adue~tured her owne person in mightie warres against the Infidels, farther than that sexe dooth commonly affoord: but she sent into the wide west Ocean sea, to the fortunate Ilands, to the Atlantich Ila~ds, bearing far north by west, gaining them all their people to the christian religio~, which neuer heard of Christ before.
In which Ilandes, to the end that after they had tasted the sweete milke of the Gospell of Christ, they might be fed with stronger meat: hauing built and erected many parish churches, besides diuers goodly colledges, she founded and erected in Granata, foure Cathedrall churches; in the fortunate Ilandes, two: in the Indian Ilandes, three: in Affrike she wonne Mellam, a most strong defenced towne: she wonne from the Turke the Iland Cephalena, sometimes Vlisses inheritance, amongst the Grecians: and most louingly she restored it to the Venetians, whose sometimes it was.
Shee wonne the Citie and tower of Ostia, violently deteined from the Romanes by a tyrant: restoring it vnto the Bishop of Rome: she enacted that there should bee but one religion in her dominions, one faith, one forme of diuine worship, and thervpon, notwithstanding the great tribute, which came yearely into her treasurie from the Iewes, she expelled from her dominions all the Iewes which dwelt there, euen to the number of six hundred thousands, also shee offered to all Sarasins and Mahometists, either freely to depart out of her dominions, or to become Christians.
Wherby after some time and diligent preaching, within one yeare, of the Sarasins, there were conuerted and baptised aboue twentie hundred thousand.
Lastly, shee gaue to the adorning of the temple, built ouer the sepulcher of our sauiour Christ, foure costly syndones, which whilest she was with child, she did spin weaued afterward with hir own hands, in token of her dutifull obedience towards him.
most fruitful and vertuous Lady, which shunned neither colde nor heat, nor wars, nor weapons, nor wearying of hir selfe, nor spending her treasure, her time, her life, so that she might increase the church of Christ, and make his name known amongst the Gentils.
Therefore the Lord looked down from heauen vpon her, with his louing countenance, giuing her all that her heart desired heere vppon earth, with most happie successe: till at the length after her long, prosperous, and victorious raigne, shee which had leade her life most vertuously, yeelded her soule into the hands of Iesu Christ, most willingly.
After whose most happy death, her childrens children were raised by the Lord, vnto the seate and title of Earles, Dukes, Kings and Emperours.
This right renowned Lady, was born in the yere of our Lord departed this life at which time also florished in England, that most vertuous Princesse, the Ladie Margaret Countesse of Richmond and Darbie, mother to king Henrie the seauenth.
This deuout Princesse beeing replenished with heauenlie graces, well knowing that the high honor of flesh and bloud is but a glistering cloude of vanitie, leauing the transitorie delights of the world, shee betooke her selfe wholly to the seruice and worship of God.
Shee fell downe often on her knees secretlie in her closet, bowed her selfe most humbly before him in his holie Temple, powring out her complaints together with the penetentiall Psalmes of Dauid, humblie requesting the Lord in her prayers, that hee would looke downe with his louing compassion on his holie Church, mercifully forgiuing the sinnes of his people.
To her diuine meditations, she adioyned often fastings, with many thousands of mercifull deedes to the poore, hearing their crie: willing that they might haue accesse vnto her, helping them to their right against the mightiest of their Countrie, of what calling, place, honor, or office soeuer they were.
Her house most princely and solemnly ordered, her vertuous statutes set downe by her godly Counsel, and signed with her owne hand (as it is to be seene at this day) the Chappell was most reuerently regarded, of all other places, and not of her alone, but of all her honorable retinue: her hower appointed for praier, no pleasure, no businesse, no embassage, no King nor Keisar could once interrupt.
No oth within her dores, nor any word or deed which might offend the King of heauen.
And yet those vsuall recreations which might verie well beseeme the better sort of Christians.
Her house thus wel reformed, according to the disposion of her heauenlie mind, though she waxed in years, yet shee walked forth of her doores into the haruest of the Lord, wherby the way looking vp, she viewed the height fairnes of the temples: wel thinking in her wise and Godlie meditation, that there were many goodly places, deuoid of worthy persons and many faire walles, but not so many well learned as they should be.
Her thought was good, her intent godlie, her successe was happy.
And what was that? shee seeing the haruest great, and the laborers few, forthwith shee thought to send more laborers into the field of the Lord.
And how? Shee pulled not downe manie litle Celles to build vp one great Colledge (as did the Cardinall, who liued not to see the end of his worke once begon) but wisely waying the great inconuenience of walles without men, men without religio~, religio~ without knowledge, knowledge without spirituall pastors: she founded an excellent colledge in our vniuersit of Ca~bridge, after the name number of Christ and his xii. Apostles, endowing it with goodly landes possessions, with statutes and rules of vertuous life, to the end, that by her meanes many good and workmen might goe forth into the haruest of the Lord.
This branch of true christian charitie increased so much, was so acceptable in the sight of God, that by the view therof she framed a more solemne portraiture in her breast: for not long after she stil meditating how she might best gratify the Lord of light, who had put downe her foes, and replenished her hart with ioy and gladnes, according to the true rule of profiting in the schole of Christ, she went from vertue to vertue, from strength to strength, euen a litle before her death, raising vp a most solmne sumptuous colledge, by her will founding therein seauenty fellowes according to the number of the seauentie Disciples sent out by our Sauiour Christ into the world to preach the Gospel, for the good weale and prosperous maintenance whereof shee gaue very rich, ancient, faire, and good lands.
Shee left them holsome and worthie statutes, whereby a vertuous life might bee practised, and all knowledge, aswel of tongues as of sciences, might by her godly deuotion, bee more happily attained.
Lastly hauing bestowed great landes possessions for the maintenance of lectures in Hebrewe, in Greeke, in Latine, in Arethmetike, Rhetorike, Logicke, Philosophie, Geometrie, Mathematick, Phisick, Astronomy, Diuinity, and such disputations, with other profitable exercises belonging to the same.
She cleaped this latter colledge by the name of that Disciple whom the Lord so loued, that he let him leane vpon his breast.
For whose sake we loue another him we loue much more.
And surelie this most vertuons princes loued our Lord Iesu with a perfect loue, which so honoured the name of that disciple whom the Lord loued so much: neither did her worthie deuotion conteine it selfe within these walles, but proceded like the pleasant flowing riuer, which giueth moisture to the pastures round about it: In that shee founded a diuinitie lecture to be read publiquely in Cambridge, and an other in Oxford, with many other gratious deeds elsewhere.
To these good fruits, which this worthie tree of the Lords vineyard, did send forth plentifully, (vnder whose shadow many of vs pore soules, are shrowded from the nipping cold in Winter, and the scorching heat of Summer at this daie) the Lord distilled the heauenlie deaw of his blessing vnto her heart, her a most deuout and heauenlie minde here vppon earth: to which all the treasure in the world is nothing comparable, with pefect honor, true heartie loue of al good Christians.
To which hee added a faithfull and louing promise, made vnto the iust, setting her most princely sonne vppon the seat of the kingdome, whilest she liued.
And after her death, his childrens children, which wee see with our eies at this day to our great ioy, peace and comfort, most heartily praying God to graunt her a long and prosperous reigne, in this world, and in the world to come euerlasting felicity, Amen.
Amen is already said, my prayer to God shal be amen.
But thend period is not yet: sith in the field of the Lord there is good seede and tares, holesome hearbes and weedes: sweet roses and stingingnettles We haue now shewed plainly the fruitful seede of this garden, and the sweete fragrant flowers growing in the same, which daily send vp a most sweete smell into the nostrils of the Lord, much like the odoriferous smell of Iacobs garmentes, which greatlie delighted the senses of his olde father Isaac, or lyke the pretious oyntment powred on the head of Aaron, running downe his beard euen to the hemme of his garment.
Amongst the which good trees now named, as there are many passing pleasaunt flowers, springing out of many and sundry soiles, so the peareles pearle the flower of flowers, the rose of England, being ioyned with the rest, doth make the nosegay full faire, and sweet, whose pleasant smel, because it is so holesome to the head, and comfortable to the heart: because the oyle thereof doeth comforte the brused sinewes, lowseth the dried iointes, and mittigateth swelling paines, through the whole bodie: The Lord hold his holie hand ouer this flower, and preserue it to his glory, according to the tenor of that old verse: Haecrosa virtutis de coelo missa sereno, Eternum florens, regia sceptra tenet.
This rose of true vertue, euen sent from heauen, holding the kingly scepter of this lande, shall flourish for euer.
Sith the roote thereof is firmely fixed on the side of this orchyard.
Ouer which the sunne of heauen hath spred his blessed beames so plentifully, that the ground thereof is fresh and greene, the flowers faire, the smell sweete, the fruit most plentiful and verie wholesom.
Which because it yeeldeth the first and sweetest taste, vnto the spowse of Iesu Christ, hee hath blessed it as yee haue heard, and it shall be blessed.
And though bee the vnworthiest of many thousandes, to walke thorow this orchard of the Lorde: Yet if it shall please you of your curtesie to accompany mee vnto the of ther side, ye shall see by the way, that wee must decline from euill, and doe good: that on this side of the orchyard bee many faire and large trees, whose bowes be faire, the leaues be greene, the fruit is well seeming, but yet it hangeth so high, that it will not come downe, the bowes are so stiffe, and the trees so vntractable, that they will not once bend themselues vnto the hande of the most louing spowse of Iesus Christ.
And therefore as the Lord of his mercie hath blessed those abundantly, which loue his spouse, nourish his children: so on the contrary, hee maketh those trees barren, which yeeld him no fruite.
He taketh the iuice from them, so that their bowes wither, their leaues fall from them: the bodie dieth: the tree is cut downe with his sharpe axe, or else with great force pulled vp by the roote, and cast into consuming fire.
But if the ranke root of the euill tree, be so full of naturall corruption, and venimous posion, that it sucke out the iuice from the good trees neere adioining thereto, which yeelde wholesome fruites vnto all his saints, then the Lorde he sendeth forth his spirite of mighty force and tempest, which breaketh the bowes, and rendeth the tree in sunder.
Hee prepareth most exquisite tormentes, and vntollerable dolours, for all those which impouerish his Church, which disgrace the shepheardes of his flocke, which treade downe the sides of his simple folde, and deuoure his poore lambs, thorow the gredie and heathenish desire, which they haue to the the goods of this world.
From this corrupt fountain springeth, the vncertaine and the wretched cares of mans life: in that euery one is set on fire, with the sparks of infinite desires.
Beeing once tottered in the chariot of this vncertaintie: man walketh in a vayne shadow, disquieteth himselfe in vaine.
His hart is set on vanitie, and all his purchase is the sorrowfull fruits of the flesh.
Though honor and riches haue no stabilitie. though the strength of man is like a brused reede, which we bteake in sunder with our fingers: though the whole world be a sea of troubles, all the prosperities therof waues of perpetuall disquietnes: yet man, sinful man, presumptuous, disobedient, vnsatiable man: though his eies be weake and dim, yet will he aduenture to looke against the radiant sunne: though he be blind, yet will he walke: though he bee weake, yet wil he striue against the strongest stream: though he be naked, yet will he offer himselfe, to the stroke of death: though the drinke be deadly poison: yet because the colour is good, the cup pleasant, the first tast therof sweet: he wil drinke a large draught, till the tast of his toong empoyson his owne hart, till his pleasure breake out with roaring paine: till his bodie be dried vp, and til his soule all consumed with sinne, cry out with Iob: Tedet animam meam vit ae meae: it irketh me of this wicked life.
Though this bee thus: and daily example of those which descend before our eyes into the graue, dooth tell vs all this plainely: yet wee daily carke and care, for this carkasse of ours, knowing well it is but dust, wee desire sweete meates, which empoison the soule: wee reuerence, we feare: most seruilely wee admire worldly honour, which is lighter than vanitie it selfe.
The wise, high, mightie, honorable, politike rulers of this world, trouble themselues all the dayes of their life, in fetching, in casting, in compassing, goods, lands, honour, dominion and power.
They rise vp earely, and goe to bed late (as sayth the prophet) they eate the bread of carefulnes, they search and seeke many newe waies.
They inuente many strange pollicies: they aduenture many great daungers: they loose many frendes: they vndoo many poore schollers, widowes, and fatherles children, euen to the losse of their owne soules, and yet they say, they loue the Lord and his holy temple.
Can that shippe be safe which is tost with euerie surge of the sea, and ouerwhelmed with euery blast of wind? can that minde bee quiet, which boyleth with sundry flames of fire? Is there any suretie in lightnes it selfe? any certainetie in outwarde fortune? any safetie in perpetuall warre? any securitie in present daunger? any frendshippe in open defiaunce? any felicite in outwarde riches? anye religion in spoyling the Church? Be there two heauens that wee should make our paradise heere on earth? or is the Lords arme shortened, that hee can not execute his will? or his iustice decayed, that the sinners shoulde escape vengeaunce? Is hee asleepe, that hee is not stirred vp with the outrage which the heathen and hard harted worldlings commit against his church? or is hee deafe, that hee heareth not the crie of the poore? or blinde that he seeth not the pride of the world openlie disclaiming the brightnes of the heauens? No the Lord is not slack as some count slacknes.
He which made the heauens so high, most carefully he beholdeth the lowest, the poorest the simplest creatures here below.
He which made the eare, hee will heare the crie of the poore, and hee which made the eie, hee will beholde the scarres, which be inflicted on the face of his beloued spowse In his compassion, hee shall pittie her, and in his iudgement he shall draw forth the two edged sword of his wrathfull indignation.
He shall rise vp like the Gyant to the battaile, and shall passe forth as the Lyon to deuour his praie.
Hee shall redouble the wickednesse of his enemies into their bosoms.
He shall bring the curse of their desert vpon them, and who is able to withstand the surie of his wrathfull indignation? to endure his anger? or to suffer his heauie displeasure? though some men prosper for a while with that which is not their owne, being reserued to a greater destiny: yet let those which hope for the saluation of Israel, learne to feare the Lord aright.
Let vs not abuse the long patience louing kindnes which the Lord hath shewed in sparing vs so long.
grant the Lord is merciful, long suffering, full of patience and mercie, sore grieued with the death of a sinner.
But yet he is iust in reuenging the iniuries of his spowse.
If anie offer iniurie to the king, or to a noble ma~, or to a meane man before his face, he will reuenge it presently: but if wee offer violence to the spowse of Christ, or the dead, or the fatherlesse, or the innocent, which cannot speake for themselues, nor pleade their owne cause: then know that the Lord hath taken the defence of these to himselfe.
Though his blow be long in comming, it pearceth deepe euen into the Marrow and the bottom of the soule, and that to the third and fourth generation of them that hate him.
Hee beareth long with them: but when he commeth he payeth home.
Hee suffereth the wicked to deuise many vnlawfull means, whereby they waxe rich in this world.
He letteth them passe on their course oft times, with great prosperity, euen many yeares, diuers liues, till at the length, when the fruit of sinne is ripe, and the first sower thereof is readie to reape a plentifull haruest of his vngodlinesse, then besides the danger of the soule, the sowthwinde ariseth, the heauens ouercast, the outragious tempest breaketh out of the cloudes aboue, it passeth, it pearceth, it ouerthroweth, so that the haruest which hath bene so many yeares in growing, of a sodaine is cleane distroyed, and vanisheth out of sight.
Though thou haue thonsandes of landes, and tenne thousandes more than the auncient inheritance of the fathers: Though thy money bee heaped in bagges, and thou wallow in thy wealth, hauing all thinges at thine owne will: yet if thou haue robbed thine owne mother, to enrich thy treasure, thou shalt bee a fatherlesse childe, and childlesse father thy selfe, so that thou shallt haue no parents, in whose presence thou maiest ioy, nor leaue any childe behinde thee, to weepe for thee at thy graues side.
Nay that which is a visible curs: thy goods for which thou hast drudged so sore, when thou art dead shall bee translated, into the handes of thine enemies to the end they may strongly bee auenged of thy dearest friendes.
let not your eies bee blinded with carnall delight, and too much carefulnesse of this earthlie bodie, let not the delights of the flesh, blot out the well meaning motions of the spirite.
Be wise betimes and vnderstand this true rule of the spirite, least the terriblenesse of the example cause you to tremble at the first sight, and after further view breede great amasement in your hart and conscience.
If thou haue children, and childrens children, and great store of earthie offices, honors, and dignities for them all: yet if thou spend more time and care in prouiding for them, and herein count more of thine owne honour, now begunne and budding in thy posteritie, then of the prosperitie of the Church of Christ, of his diuine worship of of his holie ministers: Thy wife shall prooue a stinging serpent in thy bosome, thy children shall bee wastfull distroyers of that which thou so carefullie hast built vp: thy bodie agonished with sundrie malladies, altogether vncurable, thy groning daie and night will marre thy melodie conceiued of thine abundance of riches: thy hart shall quake with doubtfull feare of thine enemies: death will double the discord of thy disquietnesse: and if thou were the mightiest and most puissant prince in the world, yet if thou count of any earthlie thing, before or in comparison of God and his holie Church, (vnlesse thou repent) thy desire shall neuer prosper.
Concerning this conclusion, minde onely to giue you a tast, of which (if it please you to pervse Celsus of Verona hereunto annexed, yee shall find the whole seruice represented in sundry deynty dishes, which manie wicked worldlings take from the ministers of the Chuch, setting them on their owne tables.
Hee hath described the whole course, and named sundrie costlie meates, whereon the Venetians vsed to feede, adioyning thereto their sower sawces: which once receiued in at the mouth, but hardlie afterwardes digested: did breede great hart burninges, in their breastes.
And good cause why: for if the Lord promise long life and happie daies to them which dutifullie honor their father and their mother: shall hee not pull out his flaming sworde of indignation, and cutte of the line of their posteritie, which dishonor their spirituall mother the holie church? pilling and powling her of her iewels, ornamentes, auncient liberties large possessions, making her loathsome euen in in the sight of the heathen? If thy louing mother tooke thee vp out of the wildernesse, from the mouthes of manie wilde beastes: if shee brought thee in her louing armes into her house, and lapped thee warme in her owne clothes, if she suckled thee with her tender brestes, if she sustained many great losses, harde aduentures in bringing thee vp: if she suffered many troubles daungers in defending thee: nay if shee haue beene most greeuously persecuted, once, twise, thrise, nay more than tenne times for thy sake: is it not barbarous crueltie for thee when thy mother is olde, to take her iewels from her necke, her clothes from hir backe, her house ouer her head, her meate out of hir hande? Wilt thou scratch the teate that gaue thee sucke? or diminish the liuing of the Church, which giueth the spirituall foode for the soule? though the holy scripture had not once mentioned it, yet the law of nature dooth threaten a dreadfull doome, to all those which destroy their owne parents: God the Creator of nature it selfe, dooth neuer leaue it vnpunished.
Let vs propound vnto our selues, the life, the honour, the dignitie, the blessed memorie, and immortall glorie, of those worthie princes already mentioned.
And on the contrary the sinister beginnings, the euill successe, the miserable endes of all those, which neglected the glorie of God, and the prosperous estate of his Church, which of all Christians, especially of all true nobilitie, ought most to bee abhorred.
Doe but lift vp your eie, and looke at tbose which haue shaked their head at Sion, by shaking of Sion her selfe, haue meant to strengthen themselues on all sides.
Fixe your eies stedfastly, yea but a little, on those gracelesse ympes, after many great plagues and destructions sent on them, ye shall see the clowde cleane vanished, and in the house of the wicked no man lefte.
His habitation shalbe voide, and there shall no man remaine to saie, with the olde Prophet, alas my brother, alas my vnckle, alas my loouing father.
Nowe hauing bent our eyes vnto the viewe of sundrie examples, let vs looke into the ages past, and see if euer the Godly were vtterlie destitute, or that the enemies of the Church of God, euer continued long in honour, or if those which anie waie impared the Church, prospered afterwardes in their generations.
Come and see: nay pray you reede and vnderstand, that the Lord hath alwaies beene most ielous, ouer his beloued spouse.
Tell mee if you bee so olde, or your memorie so good, can you name anie what so euer, which at anie time in anie nation, diminished the state, the liuing, the honour, the safetie of the church of Christ, and scaped the handes of the almightie? Dauids eating of the shewe breade, in the dayes of Abiather the high Preest, is aunswered by the Lord of truth, extreame necessitie droue him therevnto: and yet (as the learned write) hee might more safely doe it, because he was both a Prophet and a king, herein prefiguring the person of a sauiour Christ, who was a king, a preest, and a Prophet.
But let vs proceede, plainly saying the sooth of our conclusion.
The Lord in executing his iudgementes, hath no respecte of persons neither pardoneth he this greeuous voluntarie sinne, of detracting from the Church, so easilie, as hee dooth other sinnes of infirmitie.
But rather hee sheweth his most seuere iudgement, against those which take the liuing of the leuit from the Church, and impropriate the same vnto themselues, their wiues and their children.
He was so beloued of the Lord, that by the mouth of God, hee and his seede, were appointed to minister in the house of God, hee had the freedome and prerogatiue of the Priests: and he onelie had the disposing of the Arke, the house, the sacrifice of God in his daies.
Till at the length together with the vse of holie rites, thorough the hope of small gaine, hee suffered great abuse to enter into the house of God: in that the sonnes of Ely forgetting God, the due reuerence which they ought vnto his holy sacrifice: applied the vse thereof more to the feeding of their owne selues, then to the solemne and reuerend pacifying of the Lord, for the sinnes of the people.
They seldome offered themselues, whe~ any of the people came to offer vp vnto the Lord, whilest the meat was boiling the Priests boy came, hauing a fleshhook in his ha~d, he thrust it deep into the caudron, what piece soeuer came vp, that the Priest tooke to himself.
This did they vnto all the people of Israel, which came to sacrifice in the house of God at Silo.
Yea, before they burnt the fat, the priestes boy came to him which offered, saying: giue me a portio~, that may rost for the priest, will not stay to take boiled flesh at thine hands: but must haue it rawe.
To whom when he which offred vnto the Lorde, answered not so, but (according to the custome) let the fat be burnt first, take then at your pleasure.
To whome the boy replied, nay but if thou wilt not giue it me presentlie, will take it whether thou wilt or no.
Herevpon the sins of the sonnes of Elie, was grieuous in the sight of God, because they being sinfull flesh, tooke to their owne vse, that which was bestowed on the sacrifice of the God of heauen.
Elie heard all those things of his sonnes, and more then that: and he said vnto them verie mildlie: howe is it my sonnes that heare of such wickednes committed by you against the Lord? doe so no more my sonnes, doe so no more.
They sinned still by dailie custome without regard: they offended the Lord without remorse: the old father spake to his sonnes sometimes, but so louing lie, that hee hated his children: that hee fed their humour, and nourished them in their wanton wickednes, forgetting that truth which he spake with his lips: If one man sinne against another, God may be pacified for them both, but if man sin against God, who shal intreat for him, or make sufficient satisfactio~? This mild old man waxed towards his end.
As is the vse of natural fathers, he loued his sons too much, too vehementlie, too childishlie, in that he was loather to loose their fauning looks, then the fauor of the Lord.
Alas (say some) you must beare with nature, he was verie old, and his greatest ioy was his sons.
Was his ioy here vpo~ earth? And did he reioice more in his fleshly childre~, then in the true seruice of the Lord? because he loued the issu of his flesh more the~ the glory of God; maintained his childre~ with which was bestowed on the worship of god, therfore the Lord se~t a doble embassage vnto him.
First ye man of God told him plainly after this maner: Thus saith the lord: did not plainly appear vnto house of thy father, when he was in Egypt in Pharaos house, and chose him out of all the of Israell, to bee my Preest, to offer vpon mine alter, and to burne incense, and to weare an Ephod before mee? and gaue vnto the house of thy father, all the burnt offeringes, made to mee by fire, of the children of Israell.
Wherefore haue you kicked against my sacrifice, and mine offeringe which commaunded in my tabernacle: and honourest thy children aboue mee, to make your selues fatte of the first fruites of all the offeringes of my people Israell? Wherefore the Lord God of Israell saith: saide that thine house, and the house of thy father should walke before mee for euer.
But nowe the Lord saieth: it shal not bee so, for them which honour me, them will honour.
Beholde the day shall come that will cut of thine arme, and the arme of thy fathers house, and there shall not bee an olde man in thine house, and thou shalt see thine enimie, in the habitation of the Lord &c.
And this shall bee a signe vnto thee: thy two sonnes Ophney and Phinees, shall both die in one daie.
This was the first Embassage, and the second was like vnto it, denounced by the childe Samuell in this manner: Behold will doe a thing in Israell, that the eares of all which heare it, shall tingle.
In that day, wil bring all the plagues against Elie, and against his house, which haue already determined: and will iudge his house for and the iniquitie of his house shal not be done away, with offeringes and oblations for euer.
Which when Elie heard, he being stricken with greese of hart, hee saide: it is the Lord, let him doe as it seemeth best in his eies.
Immediatly after these offe~ces of the so~s of Ely, against the Lord his holy worship, the prophaning of the tabernale, which was a figure of the church: the Philistnes moued battail against Israel, they won the field, they tooke the arke of the Lord: in the same day Oppney and Phines the sons of Elye were slaine in the battaile.
At which time, Ely sitting vppon a cell, trembling for feare of the arke, then gone forth into the battaile, he beeing blind, in the euening he hard a sorowfull noise, through out the whole cittie, weeping mourning great lamentation: euen in such sorte, that he sent presently to know the cause thereof.
In the same instant a messenger came running from the feelde in hast, telling him that all Israel was that day discomfited in the battaile: great effusion of bloud in the middest of Israell, with the death of his two sons Ophney and Phinees, also the arke of God, was taken by the Philistines.
But when Elie hearde the arke of God named, he fell downe backward fro~ his feate brake his necke.
the dreadfull iudgement of the Lord against those, which take awaie the liuing giue~ to maintaine his holy worship.
Here we see the truth of Elies speach: if man sinne agaist man, there may be an attonement made betwixt the~ But if man sin against God, if he diminish the glory of the Lords temple, to increase his own honour, or feed himselfe, his wife, his children, with the goods giuen to the worship of the Iord, his holy temple: who shall intreate for him? those which by weakenes of the flesh sin of infirmity, to the~ the Lord wil more easily grant pardo~.
But if thou lift thine hand, against the mighty God of heauen earth: willingly diminish the worship of his holy name, the~ tremble fear repe~t indeed, for not the malefactor only: but his father, his bretheren, his citie, his countrie, where his wickednes is suffred, shal be grieuouslie punished by the hand of God in peace, vanquished by the enemie in the daie of battail.
Herein both Clergie Temporaltie are to take example of the punishme~ts which light on those, that diminish or alter the oblations, godlie deuotions which true christian Princes, other wel disposed people, hath freely bestowed on the Church.
Though their hearts be so hardened that they doe not feare, and their conscience so brauned that they cry to those, which shew forth the dreadfull iudgements of the Lord, in this case: Talke on, giue me the goods: therein take the fat of the Church liuings, and leaue the leane for those which minister at the Altar of the Lord: Yet let them assure themselues, that the Lord wil come, wil not defer, and till he come he hath laid vp a heauie iudgement for them, against the daie of distresse.
In the battaile they shall be discomforted, their sonnes shall perish with the sword, themselues shall die the same night, they shal know that it is the Lord.
He wil haue the best of our lands goods children, none but he.
He will haue the Kingdome, the power, the glorie, none but he.
Neither is he like to sinful man, that he wil grant childish dispensations, contrarie to his own laws.
He hath granted no priuiledge of euil life, to anie person whatsoeuer.
If the King offend, hee spareth not his goods, his lands, his childre~, his life, his honor.
If the people sin, he raiseth a strong strange people against them in war, or sendeth a secret pestilence to destroy them at home in peace.
If the priest conuert the offerings of the Lords worship, vnto the maintenance of his wife children, though it be that good old man Elie, yet the people for whom he praieth shal flie before their enemies, his sons shall die on the edge of the sword, he shal break his neck down backward, the ark of the Lord shal be taken by the vncircu~cised Philistines, (that which is the core of this most grieuous plague sore) the glory of the Lord shal depart from the land.
Tunc tuares agitur paries, cùm proximus ardet, if iudgme~t begin at the house of God what shall be amongst the estranged sinners, if the fier be already so kindled in the greene tree, what shall become of the drie? If the Lorde thus seuerelie punished his priest (whom hee chose vnto himselfe) for diminishing the sacrifice the solemnity therof: with what sword wil he reuenge the disgraces of his holie Temple, amongst the heathen, or the greedie Atheists, which spoile hir of hir dailie maintenance, of hir pretious clothing, of hir solemn foundations, of hir wel bestowed lands? You know that Salomo~ was the wisest man that euer was being onlie man, yee haue heard of the fruit of his heauenly wisdome, euen the building of a holy temple vnto the Lord.
If heauenly wisedome built it vp, then sinful folly pulled it down, down it came.
But wil you see with what countena~ce, the Lord beheld that fact? That mightie Monarch Nabuchodonozer amongst his generall warres and famous victories, he conquered Ierusalem and rased the walls, he spoiled the Temple, and tooke away some of the golden vessels of the house of God, placing them in his emple before his Idols, wherein the learned obserue that he had some conscience, in taking some of the vessels not all, in vsing them only in the temple of his gods, not in his owne house.
He was a mightie Emperor, as his dominions were greater then those of other princes, so was his hart lift vp in prid, aboue all other men: therefore the Lord he put the mighty man from his seate, hee disarmed him of all his power, he made him naked of al his glory, he remooued the crowne of golde from his head, that which argueth what manner of men they be, which laie violent handes on the temple of God, he tooke from out his brest, the vnderstanding hart of man, placed therein a brutishe beastly heart together with the shape of an Oxe, which hath hornes and hoofs, and eateth haie.
After this hee tooke him from the princely pallace, and turned him lose into the wilde soile, euen amongst the beasts of the wood.
His body was wet with the dewe of heauen, his drinke was the water of the puddle: his solace was the company of brute bests.
He led this dul deadly life, for seuen yeres: yt hee might learne to know the God of heauen: to regard his truth, to giue him al honor and glory: which after the Lord of his mercy wisdom, had restored him to his kingdome he did most willingly plainely acknowledg, euen in these words: Nabuchodonozer, do lawd, magnify, extoll aboue al things, king of heau~e earth, &c. Though after this strange chastisement, he was wo~derfully humbled in the sight of God man: yet the corruptio~ of the fathers bloud did sinke so depe into the bones of his son king Balthasar, that when he was at a solemne feast, amo~gst his princes the nobilite of his court: being dronken he commanded the golden vessels, which his father Nabuchodonozer brought fro~ the temple of Ierusale~ should be brought into him: that he his princes, his nobles, wiues concubines, in a brauery might drinke in them.
They did eate and drinke in the vessels, belonging to the temple of the Lorde: they praised their idoll Gods: but by the way, the wine which tasted sweete to his lips, came cold to his hart.
For in the same moment as hee was drinking: right ouer against the candle standing on the table: there appeared the fingers of a mans hand, writing on the wal: which once discried, by the king himselfe: hee beheld it with a gastly looke, and fearefully esprised with the letters, which appeared in his sight, his colour chaunged, his heart panted, his spirit was troubled, his raines were loosed, and his legs shrunke vnder him.
Straightway in great hast hee sent for Daniel, who read the writing, which was this: Mane, Techel, Phares: expounding these three words in this manner: Mane, that is, God hath numbred thy kingdom, broght it to an end: Techel, thou art weighed in the ballaunce, thou art found too light: Phares, thy kingdome is diuided, giuen to the Medes Persians.
This was the sentence of the Lord against that mightie king, for translating his vessels appointed for his holy sacrifice, vnto prophane vse: the execution was not long deferred: for the selfe same night in which he presumed to drinke in those holy vessels, hee was slaine in his owne house.
Though the Lord do not alwaies sende such manifest speedy reuenge on all those, which take the goods of the holy church vnto their priuate vses: yet let them which are guiltie thereof beware, that they abuse not too much, the merciful louing patience of the Lord, for his sword is sharpe, passeth swiftly, betwixt the soule and the spirit, like the lightning breaking out of the clowd.
Think not that he is forgetfull, because the fact is nowe past: or vniust, because vengeance yet lieth hid: or partial, that without repentance he should suffer any sin to scape vnpunished, in any person whatsoeuer, from the beginning of the world vnto this day.
Dauid was a holy and a kingly prophet, a man euen according to Gods owne hart: his eies beheld the vaine beautie of a woman, wherewith his hart was straight inflamed, and set on fire within his brest: hee tooke his poore subiects wife, and sent her husband to wars, where hee was slaine: he loued, he killed, and after that he possessed the woman, had by hir a goodly boy.
What followeth in the text of holy scripture? the prophet Nathan brought him a heauie message fro~ the Lord, saying: it is euen thou; thou hast sinned against the Lord and thy poore subiect: thou hast slaine Vrias the Hethite, and married his wife: wherefore the sworde shall not departe from thine house for euer.
This was the defiance of the Lorde sounded against king Dauid, by the mouth of Nathan the prophet, to which the great alarum was not vnlike.
For the Lord did visite the little childe, which he had by Vrias wife with sicknesse.
For whom Dauid prayed vnto the Lorde most instauntly, that hee would spare the childe.
Hee prayed long, hee fasted religiously, hee mourned, hee remained in the darke; hee put on sackecloth and ashes; hee lay vppon the colde ground; his noble counsellors could not intreate him to take any meate for seuen dayes, in the ende whereof, the Lord tooke away the fruit of his sinfull delight, euen the childe vnlawfully begotten, which he so entirely loued.
Afterwards, though the Lorde blessed him with Salomon, yet to shewe that the fight of the rereward, should bee no lesse mortall than the sodaine alarum, giuen before to the maine battaile: the Lorde stirred vp his owne sonne in armes against him, and armed the people so stoutly with rebellious heartes, in desire of his destruction: that it was saide plainely, before the king: that all Israell were vp in armes against him, and sought to destroy him.
This tumult of the people was so sodaine, so violent, and so outragious, for the time, that the king for feare, fledde out of his owne pallace, and durst not staye therein, though hee had shewed great signes of hartie repentaunce: and the Lorde had sayde, that hee would remember his mercies, promised vnto him: the retreate was not fully sounded, but the Lorde punished the sinnes of the king together with the death of seuentie thousand of his subiects, destroyed with the plague which hee sent amongst them.
Whereby all men maye learne to feare the Lorde, knowing that hee is iust and holie, immutable, and not as man is, to bee pleased with a faire worde: but euen amongst his chosen children, hee sendeth his deuouring sworde to cut of the roote of their sinnes: and not to them onely, but to their children and childrens children.
Concerning this wee haue a cleare example in Achab king of Israell, who when hee could not entreat poore Naboth to depart vnto him his vineyard and the inheritance of his forefathers: hee lay down on his bed, all sick with griefe turning his face from the companie towards the wall, he sighed sorrowfully, but the phisition was at his elbow.
For there was a commission presently sent forth, a court called, witnesses examined, Naboth condemned, brought forth, executed.
When Achab heard of this, he rose from his bed, he descended and tooke possession.
But the Lord he sounded forth his trompet of defiance against him by the mouth of Helias saying, hast thou killed and taken possession? behold, in the same place where the dogges licked the bloud of Naboth, they shall also licke thy bloud, and will cut of the line of thy posteritie, so that will destroy from Achab euery one that maketh water against the wall, Achab hearing this, was wonderfullie sorie and vexed in his hart, so that he rent his garment, fasting and praying in sackcloth and ashes.
Therefore the Lord had an eie to his penitent sorrow, and recomforted him by the mouth of Helias, saying.
Because thou hast humbled thy selfe at my voice, this euill shall not come in thy daies, but in thy sonnes daies; and yet not one iot of the word of the Lord failed, concerning his death.
For after three years, there arose great wars betwixt Israel and the Assians, in which king Achab being sore wou~ded vnder the side with an arrow, the bloud ran down into the chariot, and he died: and they washed the Chariot in the poole of Samaria, and the dogs licked his bloud, in the selfe same place, where hee spilt the bloud of the innocent Naboth.
His eldest sonne Ioram was partaker of this punishment sent from God, for hee was shot betwixt the shoulders by the handes of Iehu, being cast out of his chariot into the fielde of Naboth.
Also his wife Iesabel the deuiser of this sinne shee was cast out of her window downe vpon the pauement, where (her brains dasht out against the stones, her bloud sprent vpo~ the walles, her body bruised against the ground) When she should haue bin taken vp, there was nothing found remaining saue onely her handes, her feet and her scawpe, as it was spoken by the mouth of Helias.
Dogges shall eate the flesh of Iesabel in the fieldes of Iesraell.
Lastly (that wee may behold the seuere iudgement of the Lord against those which take away other mens possessions) though Achab left great store of Children behind him, euen
sonnes in Samaria: so that it seemed verie likely in the eie of man, that hee should neuer want issue to sitte vppon his seat, yet the Lord in one day by the hand of Iehu destroyed them all: their heads were cut of at his commaundement, and laid on heapes by the citie gate, to the end that all posteritie might learne hereby: not to trust in the multitude of their landes, authoritie and riches, or to hope too much in the succession of their carnal bodie: but to way the seuere iudgementes of the Lord against all those which neglect his honour, and which through a greedie desire of earthly possession, with the hasard of their owne soules, willingly vndoo their poore neighbours and bretheren, for whom the Lord Iesu the God of heauen and earth, hath shed his most pretious bloud.
that carnall men would consider wisely, and way this conclusion truly in their hart, that if the Lord did so seuerely punish Achab (and yet not the thousand part which hee deserued) for the taking away of one of his subiectes vineyardes, which lay verie commodiouslie for him: that hee died vnfortunately in the battaile, his Queene was eaten with dogges, his children euen
be headed all in one day: what grieuous punishment hath hee prepared for those which take the house vineyards of his beloued spouse? which impouerish his children of whom he hath said, hee which hurteth you, hee toucheth the apple of mine eye? which eate her bread from her, and make her barren of her best beloued children? Which place all their studie and delight in hording vp corruptible riches, not remembring how litle it auaileth a man, if he win the whole world, and loose his owne soule? Nay not considering the exceeding great blessings which the Lord continuallie powreth on them that mainteine his holie temple, and the extraordinarie curses, wherewith hee cutteth of the desire and posteritie of all those, which either decay his holy church, or diminish the deuine worship of his holy name.
Me thinks our eies should not be so dim in this cleare light, that wee should not see: nor our hearts so fleshlie that wee should not vnderstand and the will of the Lord, and his great iudgements against those which maintaine themselues by the goods of the church, being none of those which do seruice, or haue any special functio~ in the same.
Though we wil not vndersta~d the feareful examples which the Lord hath shewed heretofore: Yet let vs so incline our owne hartes and waies, that of our selues we may be ready rather to giue with the blessed, than to take away with the cursed.
Let vs consider with reason, that man is created for the glory of God, not for his owne glory: for the seruice of God, not for his owne seruice: for the saluation of the whole man, euen body soule, not for a litle vaine delight, whilest he liueth herein flesh.
Herein let him know by the rules of nature, of reason, of ciuil lawes, holy institutio~, that the goods of the church, came to vs by the right of successio~: by the same right they are entailed to our posteritie, succession of our place calling for euer.
If this bee so the~ the sequel is most plaine true, the goods of the church they are none of ours to giue, but whilest we possesse the~, nor theirs to take: we offend in giuing, they offend in taking away that, which is neither theirs nor ours.
But (as Naboths vineyard) the inheritance giuen by our forefathers, to vs our succession.
We gaue you them say some, we may take them away.
Not so, though the antecedent halt, yet suppose it were true: the co~sequent is altogether maimed.
Though you had giue~ that which you would faine take away, though those good deuout soules, your auncestors, which so charitably prouided both for you vs, liued at this day (whose life would be to them a double death, if their eies did see that which we see) yet that which thou hast once giuen into mine hand, willingly wittingly lawfully, thou canst not take to thee againe.
Who presenteth a noble man with a saire horse, or a goodly dogge, after the acceptance of the same with hartie thanks, challengeth his gift again for his owne? If his manners faile thus farre, yet is it right or reason so to doe? But if wee giue vnto the Lorde and that freely, as we ought to doe, if wee confirme the same with worde and deede, with witnes, hande and seale, and willing deliuerie, shal we be so shameles, that before the Lordes face, and in the sight of all his saints, we will say: giue me my goodes; or these be my landes: or as the Priestes boy saide: if you will not giue me, wil take it? this is thus, or at the least, so suppose, sith thou which lately didest walke belowe in order with thy brethren, art now well fatted, and they still leane: thou hast taken a higher flight, and aymest at a richer praye: thou hast seene greate wars, with the straunge deuise of forraine sleights thou breakest that, which will not bend: leauing the good country simplicitie; entring the vsual course of this flattering worlde, forgetting the plaine honest dealing of a true Englishman: thou art thereby wel instructed to liue, and so full soone thou becommest very well learned: thou canst the rule to catch on all sides, and to hold fast till death doth loose the knot.
In practise of this generall, thou reapest where thou sowest not: thou findest that which earst was neuer lost: thou receiuest from the church, that which when thy seeth it within thy gates, it blusheth red as a rose, and burneth within thy hart, like the flame of fire.
That this flame may not onelie appeare without, but also consume within, euen the heart, the life, and the soule: thou powrest oyle into it, ioining house to house, and land to land: turning poore mens commons into thine owne priuate pasture.
With these two wings of violence, of a sodain thou risest from the earth, and with the helpe of the puffing winde, thou mountest swiftly so high, that the highest temples and mightiest mountaines, to which before thou durst scarce lift vp thine eyes, least thy head should dazell, nowe are farre below thy slight, and through great despoile almost out of viewe.
In this thy height remember that thou wert lowe before, and that thou must descend down into the earth from whence thou camest.
The arrowe shotte vpright out of the bow, when it is at the highest, it turneth backe, and swiftly falleth downe to the place from whence it came.
The soaring fowle which flyeth most swifte and high, when mowlting time by kinde and course comes in, ofttimes dooth cast her fayrest feathers.
Those on whome this worlde dooth laugh most pleasauntly, which haue the fawning of outwarde fortune at their owne pleasure, pleasing themselues in the high throne of honour and rule; let them consider that the higher they climbe, the lower will be their fall: and that which is the corsey of their pompe: the highest boughes be most weake and brittle.
What auaileth it to attaine the highest boughes sith on the same dooth hang the fruite of our perdition? Canst thou sit surer and faster on the highest boughes aboue; than olde Ely did on his Cell belowe, from which hee fell downe backeward and brake his necke? Flatter your selues still (if you wil) yee which distraine your mothers teate so harde, that it droppeth bloud withall, and feed your selues with the doubtfull pleasure of this sinne, and when you haue satisfyed your thirst, with the taste of that which yee drinke too much: then assure your selues if God bee God, euen the God of Gods: if he be iust, euen iustice it selfe: if he bee the same he was (as saith the Apostle) the same yesterday, to daye, and for euer: if hee bee true, which is the way, the the life, and the truth: most true, most holy, most eternall: that waye which you seeke to saue your life, yee shall loose it: that meanes by which ye desire to rayse your selues, shall cast you downe: those goodes, which you laie vp in store, for the maintaining of your children; shall cutte off the line of their life, and cleane blot out all thy name and memorie from off the earth: and that which you studyed to make your honour, shall bee your vtter confusion.
If the glasse nowe set before your face bee true, and if your sight bee good, why doe you not behold this spotte of earth, wherewith your face is so besprented? But if your blindnesse bee the same, with his which will not see: behold yet will set the glasse nearer to your face: and if can, will so rubbe it, that the spotte of your disgrace, maye more easily appeare lothsome vnto your eies.
Hee which receiueth you, receiueth mee (saith our sauiour Christ) and which honoureth you, he honoureth mee.
Now doe ye but beholde a little, what reward, what countenance, what place, or credite, a poore learned man hath amongst vs in this worlde, and then marke if the spot be not fowle and great.
If he bee in the Court, away good peake goose, hence Iohn Cheese.
If in the country, hee is of no wealth, what call you for his witnesse? wheresoeuer he commeth, Pauper vbique iacet; euerie wans verdict is this generall pitie; alas poore scholler· And thus he liueth.
The Lorde hath decked the barren earth, with store of goodly flowers, the trees he hath laden with leaues, and the waters he hath replenished with fishes.
The cuntriman hath his house, his cattell, his plough, his ground, whereby he liueth: the lawyer his pen and toong, with which in few yeares, he purchaseth hundreds: the merchant his returning gain: the courrier more than can tel: the secretary his secret co~mings in, which make him glitter in his gold abroad.
And is the learned man without house or home, without money in his purse, or good apparell to his backe, without a cogging face and lookes? hath the Lorde prouided no such thing for him? alas poore scholler.
Had hee neuer cretaine liuing of his owne? hath he none, or can he haue none? Habui filium, saith the olde man: Nos quondam floruimus, saith the Troiane.
And so do we; it may be we had some certaintie: and nowe it may well bee: but the conduit pipe by which the water flowed from the spring into our bosomes, is waxen so full of riftes, that the sweete spring water runneth out on euerie side, into strange groundes adioyning to the same.
There be liuinges good store, saith one, if the learned wil seek, let the~ assure themselues they shal finde.
Seeking is a ready way, if it were so plaine as it seemeth short.
But what if the best hownd in the whole kennell, bee not the best seeker, who shall goe away with the Hare? yet let him follow, and at the length hee shall come to the view of the wished gaine.
After hee haue bin long tired and scratched in the bushie woods, peraduenture he shal come to the death of the Hare.
And yet in our moral, the course is not so hard, nor halfe so vncertaine.
For when the wished preferment which you meane is once to be atchieued, who so hard harted that will not bestow it on the best.
Is it detur meliori, or detur pulchriori? know not, but am sure, hee that seekes shall find.
If his wished preferment lye in the court, he must prouide a friend in the court, who is alwaies better than the pennie in purse.
What if it be in the countrie? these things haue all one certaine rule.
But as the giuer is, so is the way of obtaining.
Then the learned are in worse case than they were before, because the way is more vncertaine: for hee must sometimes sue to the good, honest Farmer in the Countrey, who knoweth a golden angell better than a Latine word, sometimes to the gentleman in the Citie, sometimes to his wife, his sonne, his daughter, his cosin, his steward, his factor: sometimes to the Noble man: and all his circumstances, before he can come to the matter.
And when he hath done, if hee bee not so well seene in secret Philosophie, that hee can talke learnedlie with the secretarie: his studying at the Vniuersitie so many yeares, his riding into the countrie, the citie, the court, his expenses, his paines, his hope is all lost.
Is this the seeking which you meane? and must the poore learned man, after hee hath read so many volumes, and studied so many yeares in so manie sciences and tongues, runne and ride post, hast from place to place, from countrie man to gentleman, from him to his wife, from both to the court, to the noble man, to his sonne, his clerke his secretarie? alas poore scholler.
Whilest wee haue bene seeking after your manner, we haue almost lost the game which wee begunne to hunt, and yet hope wee are not runne so farre counter, but that wee may easilie vndertake it againe.
Sith it followeth conuenientlie, if they be good minded men, which pittie the poore distressed case of the learned, then they be euilly minded, which are the cause thereof, diminishing the liuinges of the Church, wherewith the learned ought to bee mainteined.
Without such contingent seekinges, the last dispaire of most learned mens desire.
From this riuer conduit pipe floweth a channell of fowle troubled water, wherewith whilest these worldly minded men do vse to wash their faces, they appeare much more deformed than before, sith the tasting often of the sweetnesse of this troubled earthlie channel in hart and minde, are so bewitched with the loue of this present life, that the honor of God, the reuerence of his name, the due hearing of his word, the daylie celebrating of his diuine Seruice, together with the immunitie and perfect freedome of his ministerie is much decayed.
passe ouer al the examples, and plaine speaches of contempt vsed against the ministers of Christ at this day.
Those which be thus euilly minded towards the Church of Christ, nay towardes Christ himselfe: are the Christians? are they comparable to the heathen in their kinde? or worthie to bee numbred amongst men? though their titles be many, their honour great, their landes inestimable, yet thinke yee that these men shall prosper here on earth? as for heauen, turne backe good sir, this is not the way.
The gate by which yee must enter in thither is verie lowe, the way narrow, the iourney long, your bodie is idle, your doinges dissolute, your chariti cold, your hart to high, yee cannot come in.
Our Lord and Sauiour Christ when hee liued here on earth, hee willed that the litle Children should come to him saying: that of such consisteth the kingdome of God.
And yet if the children treading in the steppes of their fathers, contemne the minister of God or in their childishnesse dishonour him: If the children of Bethell scorne the good prophet Elizeus, like graceles boyes, crying out on him, goe vp you bald pate, go vp: though they be smal yong, yet their crie pearceth to the heauens.
The Lord shall listen verie attentiuely when ought doth sound against the honour of his prophets: he shall open the window of his wrath, in his displeasure two shee Bears shall come out of the wood, shall deuour two and fortie of them, that thereby both olde and young may learne to reuerence the prophets of the Lord sent vnto them.
Euen as the countenance of the mother beholdeth the sucking child in her armes most louinglie: as the eie of the Hawke minting at her pray, doth most fixedlie and fiercelie behold the same: euen so the Lord dooth continually behold his embassadours, his prophets, his pastors, his ministers, and not their life onely and their safetie: but their good mainteine, and regard: so that the sonne shall not burne them by daye, nor the moone by night.
The pride of sinfull flesh shall not represse them long, nor the greatest tyrant in the worlde shall disgrace them in any word, or sprinckle any spot in their face, but it shal be washed off againe, euen with his owne precious bloud.
Well and wisely did the faine, that the contemners of the goddes alwaies came to euill end.
Amongest a number of examples, this appeareth plain in Aiax, who counted more of bodilye valour, than of Mineruaes wisedome: and with hawtie speach disdained that it shuld haue the due reward: therfore he was berest of commo~ wit, vnderstanding: being stricken with a most furious fit, in which he slewe himself vpon his own sword.
What should rehearse the manifold plagues punishme~ts which the Lord sent vpon the conte~ners of his holie worship, euen from Noe vnto the birth of our S. Christ? whose life, because that tirant Herod sought by his bloudy sword to cut off fro~ the earth, that with the shedding of much innocent bloud: therefore the Lord on a sole~ne feast day, whe~ he shewed himself vnto the people in his highest glory, the multitude to flatter him cried most blasphemosly it is the voice of a God, not of a man) then, euen then the Lorde from heauen stroke him by the hande of his angell; so that presently his flesh rotted, crawling full of quicke worms and lice, which deuoured him most miserably before the face of all the people.
If carnall sensualitie did not too much dimme our eyes, should not neede to holde out this my obscure light vnto you now at the noon daye, when the light of the Gospell shineth most cleare and bright round about vs.
If we had cunned the rules of true christianitie by hart, or vnderstood the truth of them; or had receiued the vertue of wel woorking into our consciences, therewith renewed in the spirite.
should not neede at this day, so often and so plainly to haue opened the glasse before your face, or to the ende that you should acknowledge your deformity, wherewith your fleshly hands haue fowlie bespotted the beautiful countenance of your soules.
should not haue needed to haue trauailed into strange countries amongst the Iewes, and heathen people, to shewe you by the true consent of sundrie glasses, that as it appeareth without, so it is that you haue fowlie stained your christian consciences inwardly with this fowle sin of taking from the Church.
Neither should neede nowe after the proposing of those two faire wel steeled glasses, of the heathen and the Iewes: to adde the thirde, which is the true mirror of christianity, shewing most plainly, that the Lorde Iesu hath an especiall eie vnto his beloued spowse the holie Church, and most seuerelie punisheth the detracters of the same.
Herein as we haue begunne; if wee goe forwarde and pierce the fountaine, wee shall soone perceiue great riuers flowing from the same.
For first of all in the daies of our Sauiour Christ; let vs marke what was concerning the Church: what ought to haue beene, and what followed.
The Lord of light was made a man; he walked amongst vs in the habit of man; he was vsed verie hardly; he liued in very meane estate; he was reuiled, persecuted, whipped, despited, with mockings mowings, with spittings, with a reede in his hand, and a crowne of thornes on his head, And lastlie with a most bitter and cursed death for our sakes, and for our saluation.
Likewise also the Disciples; though they preached the glad tidinges of the Gospell, with the great power, vertue, and Maiestie of the holie Ghost; yet concerning the worlde, they were poore, simple, contemptible, persecuted men.
In so lowe a valley, it pleased the Lord, to sow the first seed of his Gospel, and to the end that the Roofe of the Church might afterwardes rise farre and high aboue, first of all, he laid the foundation in great humilitie farre belowe.
Thus it was then, and worldlie minded men regarding more the prosperitie of their bodies, then the health of their soules, and the safetie of the holie church: misconstruing that voice of truth, Vos autem non sic: say, that as the simplicitie of the Church was then; euen so it ought to bee now in the flourishing state of the Gospel.
Wherein wish them to beware that they looke not on this Christall mirrour too much, or that they hold it not too neere, for fear lest their fleshlie breath doe dimme the same.
Remooue the sight of the glasse a little, and let vs see what was then, and what ought to haue beene; they contemned the Gospell of grace: they crucified the Lord of light, and cruelly persecuted his disciples: what were these? according to the prophecy, the Kings and Rulers of the earth, euen Pontius Pilat, high deputie of Iurie: Herode the Tetrarch, of Galilee: with the high priests, the Iudges, the scribes and the pharises, and the whole multitude of the Iewes: so that in these daies, the Church was trodden downe, the poore Ministers contemned, afflicted, persecuted, by that faithlesse generation.
But nowe you which so much allude, to those darke daies of persecution in the Church.
Doe but alter the case a little, and suppose that the Emperour, and Pontius Pilate his deputie; Annas and Caiphas, with the rest of the Rulers in those daies, had beleeued in Christ, and confessed plainely that he was the Sauiour of the world: that he created them, that he came to redeeme them, that he nourished them in their mothers wombe: that hee perserued the breath in their nostrels, and that it was he, by whom they shoulde bee either exalted or put downe, either accepted or reiected, either saued or condemned in the daie of iudgement.
If this had bin so: let vs thinke what a strange metamorphosis, had followed in their doings: how would they haue falle~ downe before the Lorde? with what humilitie would they haue cast down their crownes, scepters at his feete? with what ioy woulde they haue exalted the Lord of light? what honour magnificence would they haue yeelded to that heauenly bridegrome, and the children of the marriage? what great freedomes and foundations, would they haue bestowed on his Church litle flocke for euer? No say some, though Iupiters priests, with the whole City (when they did see the mighty woorking of the holy Ghost, by the hands of Paul Barnabas) would haue sacrificed to them, giuen them the honour title of gods.
Yet they refused it, knowing that the true worshippers would worship him in truth an spirit: outwardly yelding him but meane reuerence, belonging to simpler state.
Neither would he or his disciples, haue accepted of any worldly honour, sith he said plainely, my kingdome is not of this worlde.
As was the roote of humilitie, so were the braunches, springing from the same.
As the Lord though he would not openly bee proclaimed a king, yet he had ordained in his secrete counsell, that the Church shoulde haue hir time of infancie, of childhoode, of strong age, of florishing, and decaying: Euen so it pleased him, that this seede, shoulde not bee both sowne and reaped in one daie: that it should not first spring and bring foorth seede in one houre: and that the Church shoulde not bee founded and perfected, both in one minute.
Though by diuine prouidence the Church was in the infancie, that time of our Sauiours beeing heere on earth and his Apostles, and though the space of three hundreth yeares after, it was trodden downe verie low by persecution, vnder the heathen, vnder Ebion, Cherinthus, and Arrius, heretiques of the first head: whereby the account and calling of the Ministerie waxed verie poore and meane, contemned of some misliked of many· little reuerenced of the most: yet if these Kinges and Rulers, had had the grace to haue acknowledged Christ, to bee the GOD of of heauen and earth: out of doubt they woulde haue applied themselues in all loiall manner, to enlarging and amplifying of the true profession of his name, they would haue left their princely pallaces, and founded solemne temples for the seruice of the Lorde; they woulde haue founded largelie for the maintenance of his holy worship, and giuen perfect freedome to his Ministers.
Which (if anie now blinded with this beggerly conceited errour, concerning the poore simple estate of the primatiue Church; whereunto in hope of our liuinges they desire to reduce vs) doubt what these Kings and Rulers if they had beleeued, woulde, or ought to haue done: Let them but marke a litle, what the first Christian Emperour did; who being guided by the spirite of God, his doinges shewed plainely, what the Lord woulde haue done.
Beholde a while the gratious feature of this most Christian Emperours minde: reade the histories of his life, and marke diligentlie, what great account he made of the holie fathers of his time, aboue all other men, Magistrates, Rulers, and Princes of his dominions.
How he opened his hart vnto the~, and made them of his secrete counsell· what speciall care he had of their good estate, and prosperitie: not that they shoulde goe vp and downe in his dominions on foote in threed bare coates: But he gaue them freedome, title and honour, and to the ende that it might endure when he was dead and rotten (an example for all christian Princes, which shoulde succeede him) he founded many goodlie temples, endowing them with large and ample possessions: with a christian care he reedified the temples which were wasted by the heretiques and Infidels: building and raising them an exceeding great height.
He established all thinges concerning Christian religion, and the professours of the same, in most honourable and religious manner.
Therefore the Lorde blessed him most aboundantlie, with perfect health, with exceeding wealth, with true Christian liberty, of obtaining al which he did desire in this world, and in the world to come, with euerlasting felicitie.
If the life of this right vertuous Emperor, cannot dissuade you from the contrarie, but still you will proceede in this erronious opinion, that the Church of Christ amongst Christians ought to be poore, simple and naked, as it was in the time of persecution vnder hereticks and Infidels: If you be so constant in this errour, that you will not regard that Constantine: then goe forwarde in the way which you like so well; and passing on marke by the way howe it fareth with those, which though they professe the name of Christ, yet in life and conuersation they denie him, in that no lesse cruel then the Iews, they take from him, his clothes, they afflict his spirituall bodie, they disgrace him, keepe him downe, to the ende they may haue no riches in price, but the mucke of the world: no profession in account, but worldly authoritie: no glorie, but the childish decking of the bodie: no honour, but outward pompe and vanitie: no King but Cesar.
As the hardharted Iewes cried out, his bloud be vpon vs and our children: Euen so the fleshlie worldlings answere at this daie: What tell you vs of had wist; of times to come; of doomes day? If wee shall not answere till then; then care away: graunt vs so long a day to answere in, and we will haue the rest.
that men would learne by earthlie similitudes, to vnderstand heauenlie wisedome.
If a clowde doe but rise South, or Southwest, we say it is like to raine, and can wee not see the Sunne of our saluation, euen nowe setting in a darke deadlie clowde before our faces? Consider that the destruction of Ierusalem, was a plaine resembla~ce of the end of the world.
As it was in those daies, euen so it shall be immediatelie before the ending of the world: they cried awaie with him, they tooke away his coate, and parted his raiment: they crucified him, and all those which professed his name: they stoned Saint Steeuen the Archdeacon, and Iames the Cosin of our Lorde: who after he had beene placed Bishop of Ierusalem, manie yeares, most rebelliouslie they pulled him out of his chaire, casting him downe from a pinacle of the Citie wall, and when hee laie gasping on the earth, most barbarouslie they dasht out his braines with a Fullers clubbe.
These were the first which sought the decaie of the Church of Christ.
And what destenie followed this euill aduenture? The Lorde brought a huge Armie into their Citie, with a destroying plague, and consuming famine, with ciuill sedition, slayings and wastings, domesticall murders, inward anguish bred by ciuill discord, so that through feare without, and deadlie anguish within, there died manie thousands, nay hundreth thousandes, within the walles of that Citie.
Many thousands laie gasping in the streete for breath of life: many laie groning ruthfully in their houses: many as they were putting vp their hands to their mouth to feed themselues, were slaine with the deuouring sword of the seditious, which destroied so on al sides of the City, that the bloud of those which were slaine within by themselues, came running out at the gutters of the gates, and out at the sinkes vnderneath the walles.
The noble men were fain to eat their owne flesh from off their armes: and that good auncient gentlewoman which when the wars began fled to that Citie for succor, with hir litle infant sucking on hir brest, after hir house had been often ransacked spoiled by the seditious, hir men maides slaine in hir house, hir victuals cleane consumed, hir colour wan, hir milke and bloude dried vp, hir bodie fainting with hunger: shee was compelled to thinke an vnnaturall thought in hir heart, and to execute a deadly deuise with hir hands: shee tooke hir litle boy now sucking on hir breast: she held it a part from hir with both hir handes, beholding the sweete countenance of hir prety childe: the boy smiled: but alas the mothers teares did shewe hir heauy cheare, it were too much griefe to rehearse the mothers sorrowfull voice, in this wofull distresse, vttered to hir sonne.
Shee laid the litle infant on the table before hir face: hir trickling teares redoubled their course enterchangeably: after many distillations sent down from hir weeping eies, shee saith vnto hir litle infant: my little boy, the childe of mee a most vnfortunate mother: nourished thee within my wombe, and haue fedde thee a long time with the milke of my breasts: and nowe thou must bee meate for mee thy wretched and most distressed mother.
With these words, hir knife infixed into the breast and bowels of hir little infant, the bloud springing vp into hir face, shee dismembred, shee rosted, shee eate of him: the smell whereof beeing once entered the nostrels of those seditious souldiers; they brake open the dore, they came rushing in: running into hir, they pulled the meate violently out of hir hande, eating it most greedily.
Of which because shee had no more store ready, they cruelly murthered that poore old gentlewoman.
To this and a hundred thowsand like miseries seldome heard of, succeeded the destruction of the whole nation, with the vtter destruction of the City, the walles, the Temple, and all the auncient Monumentes of the most famous Kinges of Israell.
Though no Christian hart can take pleasure in walking this way, yet sith wee are entered into it, let vs passe on a litle further, and wee shall easilie see that this sinne of defacing of the profession of Iesu Christ and his holy Temples here on earth, is so hainous, so contumelious, so heathenish in the sight of God; that he neuer suffreth it to lie long vnpunished.
Neither be the plagues and punishments sent vpon the earth, for this sinne of spoiling the Temples of the Lorde due to ordinary or common infirmities, incident by the course of nature vnto man: but as it is a much more hainous and grieuous offence, for the child, vnnaturally to despoile his owne father which begot him into this light, and cruelly with bloudy handes to take his life from him: euen so, sith the taking from the Church, is the despoiling of God our Creatour: The punishment sent on such offendours must needs be much more grieuous then that which vsually is sent to man, for his vsuall and naturall infirmity.
Wee haue behelde the good blessinges of the Lord, bestowed on those his louing seruants, who in their liues and doings expressed their tender loue vnto his temple: and let vs not now loath to behold the euill desteny of those, who from time to time haue striuen against the Lord his holy church.
After, the open enemies, which sought with force of arms, and authoritie, to suppresse the Gospel of Iesu Christ, had shewed their force against the church: stoning some, and imprisoning others, whipping, scourging, banishing, cruelly persecuting the rest: Then Sathan striking saile, drawing in his ensigne of open warre, and defiance, sought by pollicie to keepe down the church of Christ, now springing in the east.
He raised sundry damnable heresies, which increased so long, intangled so many poore Christians: that the church of Christ which whilom did shine most cleare and bright, by the mistie cloudes of heresie, begun to be eclipsed.
Sed exitus act a probat: the haruest doth shew the goodnes of the seede: the life dooth proue the vertue of the minde: the death ofttimes doth shew the course of naughtie life.
Let vs leaue the force of Herod in the fielde, and a while consider what became of them, which colourably weakened the church in the towne.
Arrius that notable heretike, he most blasphemously sought the disgrace of the holie, blessed, glorious Trinitie: affirming inequality of the three persons, and detracting from the eternitie of Iesus Christ.
This opinion entred the Christian flocke, infecting farre and neere in most nations.
So that the heretike had many seeming Christians on his part, and that with great glorie, till at the length when hee should come to be restored to the church, as he went in the streete with great pride, and countenance of many friends: of a sodaine he went aside to the priuie, where his belly violently burst in sunder, his guts came out, and he fell downe dead most miserably, as it was presently seene of all the people.
What should here the wicked liues of those who though they florished in the worlde for a while, yet in that they did striue against the sonne of God, and sought to diminish his maiestie: their raigne was not so glorious, as their ende was miserable.
Nestorius florished greatly, and his heresie spred it selfe mightily amongst the people: but when this shining cloud was once well shaken with the tempest sent from God: hee was sent into banishment: in the which hee beeing often taken captiue by the barbarous people, the citie burnt ouer his head, and his life euery in the heathens hand: he fel into a most deadly contagion; insomuch that his tong was eaten out of his head with wormes, with which he ended his miserable life.
Let not worldly minded men flatter themselues, and feed their humour with the contag on of this disease; saying these were men, schollers of no great account; but rulers, and those that bee of authoritie, they are wiser.
Surely those men were worldly wise men, and in their profession very learned, in great authoritie and account amongst many nations: and though they had bene higher in degree, yet let al men know, that the Lorde counteth not of earthly honour, neither spareth any man for his great authoritie.
This appeareth plainely in Maximinius that cruell persecuter of the Christians.
Who after he had cruelly persecuted the Church, therewith pulling down the temples of the Christians: the Lorde laide his heauy hand vpon him, so that of a sodain there brake out of his body a mortall vlcer, with a corrupte humour rotting his bowels, besides an incredible number of crawling wormes, gnawing him within, and corrupting him in such sort, that his body breath sent from them a mortall stinch, his bodie was so lothsome to bee seene, that fewe physitions could abide to look on him.
Those which ventured to come neere, they dyed with the contagious smell of his filthie corrupt body.
This misery at length caused him to reme~ber his wicked crueltie, committed against Iesu Christ, and his holy church.
Therefore feeling some in his conscience, first hee confessed his sinnes vnto almighty God.
Secondly, hee commaunded that the persecution of the Christians should cease, and that of their obedience to the imperiall authoritie, they should reedifie the Churches of the Christians, in which hee requested them to pray to the Lorde for him.
Though the Lorde inflicted this horrible sicknesse on him, with his ignominious flight in the battaile, he casting away the imperiall habite, and deniyng it to bee his: yet in that hee had some remorse of his sinne, though distreyned on all sides with greeuous horrours, his ende was not so fearefull, as was the euent of that wicked Emperour Iulian, the Apostara, who after manie wicked cruelties, and deadlie pollicies practised against the church of Christ, proceeding with his puissant armie of valiant souldiers, towardes Persia, hauing passed the Riuer before hee wist, hee was in a wildernesse, where hee wanting guides for his armie: after a few daies, his whole companie was so distressed, for want of victualles, that many of them died with hunger and thirst: diuers fell downe languished as they went, by the way.
The most fled, and he was found in a solitarie place, sore wounded, crying out with griefe, and rauing furiously, blaspheming God his Creator, railing on the god Mars, and saying that Apollo was a lying god.
At length feeling the extreame pains of death come vpon him, his guttes issuing out of his wound (which most men thinke was inflicted on him by the angell of God) hee tooke his handful of his owne bloud, and did cast it vp into the aire, crying out Vicisti Galilee, vicisti.
Though haue conquered thy Christians, and pulled downe many of thy Temples, yet nowe at length Galilean, at length thou hast ouercomed mee.
This may wel be true (say some) yet the sequel not so sure, sith this irreligious Emperour, most Atheisticallie opposed himselfe against Christ, and in defiance of him spoiled his pore flocke, and the holie church, which they tooke for a sanctuarie.
But to destroy the temples of the heathen, to fier the churches of heretickes, and those which are not of a good Religion, that is no such offence before God.
In this difference of opinions, let the art of Logicke bee the framer of our arguments, and the rules of eternall truth, our direction to the same.
Let selfe wil bath her selfe in her owne bloud.
Let arrogancie drownd her selfe in the deep: let ignorant zeale flye far from hence into the wildernesse: let sophistrie betake her to a dead sleepe, and let the truth appeare plainly, speake brieflie, therwith repeating your chiefest arguments most truely.
And what be they? In great mislike of many good things now vsed in our church, you commonly begin after this manner.
In mine opinion Byshops, Deanes, cathedrall churches, &c. are not to be allowed, sith they sauour of the constitutions of men, and are not commaunded by the word.
If you will ioyne reason with true iudgement, and let iudgement guide the vncertaintie of opinion, you shal easily perceaue, that in mine opinion is no great good argument.
Looke into true art, and you shall soone see, that as vnderstanstanding is the internall beginning of the demonstratiue syllogisme (whose conclusion is aeternae veritatis, vnpossible to be refuted) and as fansie is the internal beginning of Sophistical arguments (which flie at the presence of the former, euen as the shadow of the earth shrinketh successiuely from the rising of the sunne: Euen so, opinion is the internall beginning of probable reasoning, whose conclusion is indifferently, either true or false: as the Philosopher in his Morralles concludeth most plainely, as it cleerely appeareth by this example.
In your opinion, they are not to bee retained: in myne opinion they are.
Now let the Reader iudge which of these two argumentes is the stronger.
The absurditie of this conclusion flowing from the fountaine of ignorant arrogancie, teacheth vs, that these mens opinions is more than the truth: There zeale farre beyond all knowledge, their arguments without all compasse of art.
Herein wee must vnderstand that opinion is their proper prerogatiue, Art is not worthie to knocke at the dore of their blind arrogant zeale.
What then remaineth to raise this scaled Dragon out of his dungeon? Exurgat Dominus dissipentur inimici etus.
Let the Lord arise, and let his enemies bee scattered abroad.
Let the truth breake forth like the morning beams descending from the cristall skies.
Let the holie scriptures confute this reason founded on the ysie ground of false opinion: and that by the example of Ietro: (who though he were an Ethnicke, and a straunger to the Common wealth of Israell: yet his aduise (proceeding from mans inuention) was both accepted of by Moyses, and directlie followed in all good Common wealthes vnto this day.
Therefore the constitutions of Byshoppes, Doctors, Deanes, Cathedrall Churches, &c. and all other Discipline, orders, constitutions, and lawes whatsoeuer in the Church of Englande or else where: though they proceede from mannes inuention (as they tearme it:) yet if it bee Secundum, non contrae scripturas, according to the word of God, not contrarie to it.
This is a plaine vndoubted truth, and the gates of hell shall not preuaile against it.
And though the piercing floud striue to issue through the chinkes of those infernall dores: Though the pitchie smoke ascending from that deadlie pitte, contende to couer the eies of the simple.
Though this hellish Cloude of darknesse could put on the cleerenesse of the radiant Sunne, and those foule deuilles appeare in the habite of the brightest angels: Though they open their mouthes wide, and (to the end they may deceaue manie) crie alowde, dispersing the doctrine of sedition, vnder the colour of the word of God opposed to mannes inuentions: yet shall the Lord of light quell this hideous dragon with one small sentence of truth proceeding fro~ his mouth.
And though the truth is best knowen, and most euidentlie seene when she is most naked: yet is she not so tender that she can be pierced with the sharpest arming sword of her enemies, nor so feeble that shee will yeeld to blastes of wind, nor so ill appointed, that she hath but one pore dart, nor so vnlearned that shee should yeelde to the vanishing smoke of false opinion, nor so simple but that she can soone discerne deceauing spirites from the spirit of truth.
Wisedome crieth in the streates, (saith Salomon) and the truth of this conclusion though it was first pronounced in Ierusalem: yet at this day the sound therof hath passed through al our streets, entred al our knocked at the dore of al our hartes.
And what is the sound thereof? euen the voice of the Lambe of God that taketh away the sinnes of the world.
He hath said it plainely: Whosoeuer is not against vs is with vs. By which shorte sentence, he which hath but halfe an eye may plainly see, that whatsoeuer is not contrary to the worde of God, is according to his worde.
Sententia scripturae est scriptura, saith Saint Augustine: Not the words, but the meaning of the scripture, is the scripture.
The letter is a dead element, but the spirituall vnderstanding thereof, founded in truth and veritie, giueth life to all which apprehend it.
Therfore these subtill deceiuers which cry out for a new reformatio~ in the church (framed in their own fancy) according to the word, and vnder that colour disclaime the regiment set downe by our most gratious Princesse: they do therein most presumptuously abuse her maiestie, and all her subiectes.
This facing error is not content with bare saying, but it also proceedeth to defending and prouing, after this manner: Things once abused by superstition and idolatrie, ought not to bee vsed in the woorship of Christ: therefore Churches &c. ought to be pulled downe, and vtterly abolished.
When heare this principle so often repeated by them, think on that prouerbe: Facile quae cupimus, credimus: and when confer therewith the manner of their reasoning, remember Tindarus his short salutation to his master Salue, atque vale.
So when behold their false propositions, which they take as granted, and their vntagged arguments therevnto annexed: cannot imagine, that they euer entered further into the Logicke schooles, than the threshould: or beeing there; that euer they did once behold that mistresse of Arts and Sciences: or if they did once see her grace and countenance, yet they neuer saluted her: or if they did salute her, it was but Salue atque vale.

If you be so hard harted, that you will not beleeue vnlesse you see; then cast away the blinking eyes of fonde opinion, and with the cleare sight of true vnderstanding, behold that mirrour of heauenly truth, which by the beautifull shew of sundry portraitures, teacheth vs plainely, that things abused by superstition, may be well, wisely, and religiously vsed in the church of God.
The Gentiles they had their gods, to whome they built solemne temples, offered daily sacrifices, many praiers, petitions.
Therfore should not Salomon builde a most solemne temple vnto the God of heauen and earth? The example confirmeth that rule: Quarum rerum est vsus, earum etiam est abusus, contra.
Things well vsed, may bee abused: and things abused, may be well vsed.
The truth of this generall is euident by sundrie rules and histories of the holy scriptures.
We read in the booke of Numbers, that Eleasar the sonne of Aaron, tooke the sensors (wherewith the rebellious Corath, Dathan, and Abiram, had sinned so greeuously, that the ground opened, and swallowed them vp quicke into hell) and put them into the arke of God Iosua reserued the golde, siluer, and brasse of Ierico, he put it into the treasurie, and consecrated it vnto the Lord.
Nay (that which is most plaine) Gedeon did offer a bullocke vnto the Lord, which his father had fatted for an offering to Baall.
Our sauiour Christ preached in the Iewish synagogues, which by shedding the bloud of the prophets, and by diuers other enormities, was grosly abused.
Saint Iohn preached in the temple of Diana, which had beene many yeares superstitiously abused.
The rest of the Apostles, in most partes of the worlde preached in the temples of the Gentils, which were built for their Idoll gods, and manie ages most sinfully abused.
Saint Paule alledgeth the sentences of sundry Poets, whose Gods were the starres of heauen, worshipped of them for many yeares, and by them most idolatrously abused.
Therefore the right vse of things is not to be taken away, because they haue bene superstitiously abused.
What then is the rule of right Christian reformation? and wherein dooth it consist? Euen in taking away the abuse, and not the vse. Herevnto agreeth Saint Augustine, who willeth vs to deale with the goodes and temples, as we doe with the men whome wee conuert from sacrilegious wicked men, to good Christians.
Saint Gregory (as Beda noteth) concerning the reforming of the idoll temples in this land, then built, and dedicated to the Pagan gods, writeth thus: Fama idolorum in gente Anglica, &c.
Let not the idol churches in England be destroied, but vtterly subuert destroy the idols in the same.
If this litle taste of these pleasant running brooks wil not quench the outragious heat of thine vntemperate stomacke, then returne with me againe vnto the fountain it self, which sith it is able to wash thee cleane both body soule, come boldly therevnto: if thou doubt of the true way, leaue off thine owne erroneous humour, and harken to the voice of that good olde man S. Augustine, teaching thee the waye most truly in these words: Omnis Christi actio est nostra instructio, that which our sauiour Christ did in this case, that ought to bee our example.
And what did he? when the fulnes of time was come, that the vaile should be remoued, that the sacrifice of the Iewes should cease: because the light, the body, the thing it selfe, by that prefigured, was now come; and that it was impietie now any longer to bee circumcised: the Lord of light did not destroy the temple, pulling off the lead, breaking downe the wals, the glasse, the timber, thrusting out the Scribes Pharises, taking their lands liuings into his own hands, but he reformed the abuses thereof, hee whipped the money changers, cast out them which sold doues therin, he taught the gospel in the temple, on the sabaoth day expounded the scripture in their synagogues.
Afterwards, that holy Apostle and martyr of Iesu Christ S. Iames, called Iames the iust, hee taught the Gospell therein, and in those countries, beeing Bishop there thirtie yeares.
Likewise also the rest of the holy Apostles, they frequented the temple, and the synagogues very ofte~, that for
Peter and Iohn went vp into the temple to pray.
Paul was conuersant in the sinagogue at Athens allowing the inscription on the alter Deo.
The Apostles were dispersed into all quarters of the earth.
And yet wee neuer heare that they willed any Temple to be destroyed: but with all pietie and humblenes of spirit, they ingrafted the gentils into the true christian faith, together cutting vp the branches of heresie, and heathenish superstition.
Peter and Paul planted the faith of Christ in Rome, they taught lo~g in their temples.
But yet we read not where they willed to pul down the old temples, or to take anie whit of maintenance away from the same.
The holy Apostle and Euangelist saint Iohn, liuing sixtie odde yeares after the passion of our Sauiour Christ: and being in his latter dayes in Ephesus: we do not read that euer he once persuaded them to pul downe the great huge temple of Diana.
And yet that the Gospell was therein preached, it is manifest by sundry histories: as also in that it is recorded, that this Apostle euen when he was so old that he could scarce goe, being taken vpon mens shoulders, least the throng of people should oppresse him, and to the ende his voice might be heard the better, as he passed from Ile to Ile, hee held out his hand, and said: Fratres diligite inuicem, diligite inuicem.
Loue yee one an other, this is the last commaundement of the Lord, that yee should loue one another.
This brotherlie exhortation of the holy Apostle saint Iohn was pronounced by him in the selfe same temple, in which the Idoll of Diana was worshipped.
Nether is this thing strange, or any whit to be doubted, sith it hath bene the manner of all Christians, euen from the Apostles time to this daie, to saue and not to destroy, to conuert, and not to subuert, to reduce those temples to the seruice of the true God, and not to subduce them into our owne purses.
If the matter were doubtfull, might easily alledge diuers testimonies out of the auncient fathers, and latter writers for the same.
But in that studie rather to edifie the well disposed, than to satisfie the cauill of the froward: had rather vse that plaine way of example, wherewith already haue now begunne.
Requesting those which loue the true reuerent worship due to our Lord Sauiour Iesu Christ, to vnderstand, that as is said, the glad tidings of the Gospell was preached by Christ in the Temples and sinagogues of by the Iewes: his Apostles also their Disciples.
And not onely the Iewish synagogues, but in the temples of the heathen, at Corinth, at Ephesus, at Rome, and also at Ierusalem: which after it was woonne and inhabited by the Sarasins aboue sixtie yeares, and the church thereof polluted, with their Mahometicall idolatrie al that time: Afterward it was conuerted to the vse of true Christian religion, and so deteined for the space of foure score yeares and odde.
So that wee see most plainlie the truth of this conclusion, which teacheth vs not to take away the vse of holie te~ples, for the abuse which hath bin committed in them.
Who seeth the poore waifaring man, whose earnest desire and full purpose is, to passe the right waie vnto eternall life, wandring out of the way, because hee is out of the waie, despoileth him of his money and raiment, and also his life: but rather with charitable pitie, doth not take him by the hande, and bring him into the right path againe, and laying out that coyne which hee meant to bestow vpon seducers, on the true guides and leaders of the way? This seemeth much better, and is much more to bee wished, though not to bee hoped.
In meane time, now in the ende of this world let vs count that true, which the Lord hath alwaies shewed, that the spoilers of his Temple, as they were alwaies towardes, and not braue minded men: so not amongest the Christians onely, but also amongest the heathen, most commonlie they haue come to euill and wretched endes.
Paris following the pursuite of his venerious dreame, spoiled the temple of Venus and Diana, in the Greeke Iland Citherea: whereupon followed the lamentable distruction of that heroicall kingdome of Troy.
Cyrus and Alexander the great, declining from the vertue of their yonger age, and that loue which they then shewed towards the holy temples, according to their latter inclination: they which had liued honourablie, died ignominiously: the one with all his armie being ouercome by a woman Queene of Persia, the other through pride insolencie, contemning his people (by whose helpe he obtained the high dignitie of
Monarchs) neglecting the te~ples, and the sacrifice of the Gods, which before hee so much honoured, hee became odious vnto his subiects, so that he was poisoned in that faire citie Babilon, being at supper amongest his minions, euen in his greatest glorie and delight.
In these two mightie monarches, is not the conclusion which intende, concerning the louers the neglecters of holy temples most plainly? nay in both of them, or else in which you will? Cirus in the beginning of his age was desirous to build vp the temple of Ierusalem, he prospered wonderfully, conquering in al his wars: he forgot the Lord his holie Temple, and forthwith he was vanquished of his enemies.
So likewise Alexander, whilest he loued his gods their temples, he prospered wonderfully: but when he fel from that his first loue, he left his chiefest safetie, in that cup wherin he tooke much pleasure, hee lost his life.
So that those which loue the Lord, and so long as they striue to lead a holy, vertuous, godly life, he mercifully rewardeth them according to their faithfull christian deeds: but if the righteous turne from his good life, and leaue the christian rule of sanctimony, wherby he hath once bin guided, then the Lord turneth his face fro~ such an one, setteth open the gate of euil end destruction before him.
Let no ma~ flatter himselfe with the deceitfull appearance of this vncertaine world, of this pelting honour and authoritie, for which wee so much contend with these tempting, vnsatiable, vnquiet, vnlucky, cancred riches, after which the hart of sinfull man by nature thirsteth and languisheth with earnest desire thereof: or with the vaine pleasures of the flesh, and all the foolish pompe and pride belonging to the same: of which if wee haue but once our sacietie, it is most sinfull, most deceitfull, most lothsome and detestable, euer vnto those which earst lusted longly after the same.
Neyther account lesse of those most auncient kings and princes named before, because some of them were long sithence, and others heathen.
But let vs knowe for a truth, that they on whome the tower of Siloe fell, were no greater sinners than we: and vnlesse we repent, wee shall likewise perish.
Let vs beholde the rising and decay of the Monarch of the Babilonians, of the Persians, of the Graecians, of the Romanes; the increase decrease of the good estate of the christians.
Looke the liues of their princes, so long as they honoured the God of heauen earth, accounting more of his holy worship, than of their owne, so long they prospered and flourished in all kind of wished blessings and glorious prosperitie.
But after they regarded their own honour, more than the temple and seruice of the Lord, then within few yeares they came to miserable ends.
The example is plaine in Nabuchodonoser, in Cyrus, in Alexander the great, in Iulius Caesar.
Though these were mightie Monarches of the world, yet the same iudgement is due vnto all men, euen from the highest to the lowest, which any way decay the woorship of God, and the true reuerence of his holy temple.
Romulus and Numa Pompilius, the first rulers of the Romanes, erected temples to their Gods, with great obseruance and reuerence therevnto, and they prospered wonderfully by this good meanes.
Contrary obseruation may bee had of that mighty Ruler amongst the Romaines Antonius, who requesting all the young men of Alexandria, that on a solemne feast day they would present the best comliest of the citie before him in the field, to the end he might choose of them the best, prefer them to honor: after they were all gathered togeiher friendly, with good cheare before him his Armie: he most cruelly caused his horsemen to run on them, killing, slaying, destroying, cruelly treading in pieces, many comely young gentlemen and others, with their wiues childre~, which were nere to the place.
This cruel impious mind not contented with this wicked dasterdly murder in the field, he came into the town, despoiling the temples of al their rich orname~ts.
But as the shadow followeth the body, eue~ so his desteny succeeded his steps, for not long after as he was marching brauely forward with his army, hauing occasion to step aside for his easeme~t, conueying himself a litle from his army, into a secret corner, onely with his secret seruant: when his points were vntrust, and his hose let downe, he turned him aside to ease himself: with which, Martialis (priuy to his wicked facts, lothing his impious mind towardes God man) pulling out his dagger quickly, stept to him presently, wounded him deadly, left him there lying miserably.
If this had bin in our time, we would say it was an euil chau~ce, he a wicked fellow.
graunt, but why do we not reme~ber that there is no haire falleth fro~ our head without the permission of God? why do we not wisely way with our selues, that there is no hindrance, or disgrace, or danger whatsoeuer, which we suffer but it is sent of the Lord for our sin.
When he calleth thus: why doe wee not rise out of our earthly bed, with little Samuel? why doe wee not run to the priest, aske the question what shall do? or why do wee not enter into our owne hearts, and aske within our selues, euen in our conscience what haue done? this commeth for my sin which haue committed for my notorious pride, wherewith woulde seeme to be loftier then others of my calling: for my secrete murthers, secrete adulteries, secrete polling and vndermining the Church of Iesu Christ.
And if it be a great punishment sent from God, vpon thee, thy wife, thy children, thy house or family, thy countrie or people, though thou haue not sinned lately notoriouslie: yet remember what thou hast done long since, thinke that long since thou inclosedst such a fielde from thy poore neighbours, that that thou tookest the goodes, lands, and priuiledges from such a Church, there giuen to maintaine the worshippe of the Lorde: therewith remember that though it were long since, yet with the Lord a thousand yeares is but as one day, and therefore now hee punisheth thee euen with as perfect iustice, as if the deede were nowe in dooing, before his face.
Would to God that men woulde hereby learne to feare the Lord, and to tremble at his secrete iudgement: that they woulde cast off the loue of this wicked worlde, which corrupteth their consciences, and poisoneth their owne soules: that they woulde leaue this fained kinde of repenting in worde onelie, and repent in deede, which is restoring with Zacheus foure folde, and vndooing that which they haue done, to the vttermost of their power.
If the loue of the Lords blessinges will not incite them to good life: yet let the fcare of his heauie iudgementes, deterre them from sinne.
Let vs not looke on those great and grieuous examples, which haue nowe rehearsed, thinking those were long since in times past, and that in forraine nations beyond the seas: for if we looke well, we shall see, that as many plagues, pestilences, and other contagious diseases of the bodie, haue beene brought ouer sea into this fortunate Iland: so also this most contagious and deadly maladie of bodie and soule, came ouer and rooted it selfe in this lande long since.
Wee haue store of examples at home, and one shall serue for the perfecting of this period.
William Rufus, the third sonne of the Conquerour, after hee had ouercome his enemies, and their resistance diuers times, beeing returned out of Fraunce, and quietly enioying the Scepter of this land: afterward hee liued in ioy and triumph, and for the more suppliance of his pleasure and pastime, he to inlarge his Forrest, pulled downe foure Abbeies, seauenteene parish Churches, and all the Townes belonging to the same.
Quo quisque peccat, eodem saepe plectitur modo: Oft times a man is punished the same way, by which hee offendeth; and so was hee, for in the same Forrest where these Churches stood which hee pulled downe: and in the same disport or pastime, for which he dissolued them: he was slaine by the glauncing of an arrow shot at a Deare, by a Knight: so that hee fell downe therewith on the grounde, giuing onelie one grone.
Some write that in the same place where he fell downe and died, in olde time there had beene a faire Church, which with others in his Fathers time were dissolued for the enlarging of the said Forrest, in which Forrest also a litle before, the Kings Nephew was slaine by the like chaunce.
This Kings Father and he both minded to haue made this a goodly Forrest, fit for the disport and hunting of a king: but the Churche of Christe, and the houses of his poore Subiects stood in his waie.
His officers and sycophants, considering what would come rouling into their purses that way, said it was very meete it should be so, so it was.
But alas it proued a small pleasure of the father, which ended with the deadlie groning of his sonne, a simple pastime for the king to haue his bodie wounded with the piercing arrow to the death.
Pleasure bought with griefe, is seldome kindly; and gaine procured with the displeasure of the Almighty, doth neuer profite.
The hearts of the wicked lust after their owne bane, and wanton pleasure poisoneth hir owne Nurse.
The flower of flesh florisheth not an houre, and the fall thereof is griefe to the eie.
The wisedome of this world compoundeth cares: and the height of their deuises want successe.
Most mens fancie wearieth the spirite; and their welthiest wish, is perfect disquietnes.
He which magnifieth himself, seeketh his owne decaie, because the chaire of pride is placed on slipperie ice.
Hee which gathereth vnrighteous goodes for his children, pierceth the heart of his owne flesh: and who so taketh away his neigbours possession, he diggeth vp the roote of his owne posteritie.
Hee which neglecteth his maker, choketh his soule: and hee which taketh from the Church, shall not prosper vppon earth: his bodie shall without, his bloud shall drie vp within: his marowe shall consume within his bones: his musicke shall bee groning daie and night: his feeding, shall be loathsomnes of meate: his wish shal be, that were as yonder poore man: his comfort, that his good daies bee past: his recreation one pang vpon an other: his glad tidings the death of his children: his consolation, the loathing of his friends: his hope, the feare of death: and vnlesse hee repent, his ende shall bee despairre of eternall life.
Who so mindeth to liue with Iesus Christ eternally in heauen aboue, and in this life mindeth to see good daies, let him walke the way of the righteous, and marke the fruitlesse paths of the wicked.
Frst of all let him keepe his hands, from violating holie things, and behold the miserable ende of those, which doe the contrarie.
Let him reade the holie Gospell of Saint Mathewe, and in reading let him marke diligentlie, in marking diligentlie, let him vnderstand truelie, what our Sauiour Christ meaneth, when hee saith: yee fooles, whether is the golde holie or the Temple, which sanctifieth the golde? and whether is the gift holie, or the Altar which sanctifieth the gift? If the Temple make the ornaments holie, then the walles, the woode, the stone, of the which the Temple doth consist, is holie: if the Altar doe sanctifie the gift, then that which belongeth to the maintaining of the Altar, is sanctified, they which minister ther at, are to be reputed holy.
If by our sauior Christ his speach, those things be true: then they be holie men, which build vp the Lords house, and they be wicked which pull downe the same, according to that old verse.
Ecclesias Christi, quas parentes: Heu malè diripiunt gnati, pietate carentes.
The godlie Fathers builded vp the Churches of Christ, and the vngodlie children haue pulled them downe.
But marke the end of all those, which walked this way, and learne to keepe thy conscience cleare from this gracelesse fact.
The Lord inflicted manie plagues on them, whilest they liued here: and when they were once deade, their honour vanished like smoake, and was buried with them in the graue.
As their bodies consumed in the earth, euen so their infamie did spring vp out of the ground: their goods wasted like waxe in the fire, and like snow before the Sunne: their posteritie became like the grasse growing on the house top, which withereth before it ripe.
Nether was this only the reward of those which defaced the Temple of the Lorde, and decaied his holy Ministerie· but it is most plaine and euident, by sundrie auncient histories, that in all ages, when wisdome, learning, and religion, once gaue place to worldly pollicie: when the vertues of the mind were subdued to the force of flesh: when vertuous life waxed out of vse, and sensualitie increased: when the bodie robbed the soule, and the naturall man imprisoned the freedome of the spirite: when the pride of the worlde mainteined it selfe, with the goods of the Church: then shortly after followed the vtter subuersion of the whole common wealth.
Therefore let sinfull man looke downe vpon himselfe, with great humilitie, let the pride of corruptible flesh, strike saile in time, with the sodaine puffes and pirreies of vnnaturall windes, which commonlie rise from such mens hearts, it be violently driuen into the swift currents of perdition, whose end is the gulfe of eternall sorrowe.
Let not worldly men goe on daie by daie, minding nothing else but earth and earthly ioies, like brutish beastes, which haue no vnderstanding, but let them looke vp vnto heauen, from whence commeth our ioy and true felicitie: let them consider that which the Philosopher gathered, by plaine reason, that man consisteth not of bodie onelie, neither that his beginning is meere naturall as is the stone, the flower, the tree, the oxe, the asse: but that he is indued with a soule of heauenly and angelicall substance, made vnto eternitie, that his stature was framed vpright, and his countenance erected to the heauens, to the ende that aboue all thinges, hee shoulde haue a diligent eie vnto God, his Creatour, who dwelleth in the heauen aboue, and a speciall regard vnto his diuine worshippe, which hee hath appointed heere belowe.
That this duetie is inioined him from the day of his birth, to the day of his death: that in obseruing the same is life, and in neglecting it is death: not the death onely of the bodie, but the eternall death both of bodie and soule.
If this be so, how diligently ought we to looke about vs, how readie to walke the steppes of our Sauiour Christ, whose meate and drinke was to doe the will of God here an earth? howe willing should we bee and desirous to imitate those godly Christians of the primatiue Church, who sold their goods, and their lands, laying them downe at the Apostles feete? or their successours, which imploied themselues, their goods and their lands, on the diuine seruice, and reuerent Temple of Iesu Christ? Let no man presume so farre in his blind zeale· altogether deuoid of knowledge: and sauering rather the doctrine of men, then of God: to say that God dwelleth not in temples, made with hands, neither is he worshipped, with outwarde worship, but in truth and spirite, thereby most prophanely concluding, that we ought to put no religion in outward things, or to ascribe any holines to the same.
Wee haue heard that the Temple sanctifieth the gold thereof: and if any man doubt of the same: let him adde prophane hands, vnto the arke, though vnder colour to holde it vp, and trie with Oza whether he shall presently be stroken from the Lord with sodaine death.
Or let him but holde out his hande against the Prophet, and trie with Roboam, whether it will be presently dried vp or no.
Though the Lorde strike thee not presently with Oza, or at thy returne chaunge thee into a Leaper as white as with Gehesey: though he doth not accurse thee as hee did the figtree: yet assure thy selfe that with the burning sinnes of thy body, the winges of thy soule (wherewith thou shouldest flie vp into heauen) shall bee scorched, thy heart shall melt, thy conscience shall burne, and thou shalt be consumed in the great daie of the Lord.
Let all men knowe this for a truth, that those which diminish the worshippe of God heere vppon earth, the Lord will cut of the line of their posteritie in this life, and blot out their portion in the lande of the liuing.
If this be fearefull (O ye sonnes of men) then let the daily remembraunce thereof enter into your brestes, let it sinke downe into your harts, and ransacke your inward spirits, that ye may therby learne to kisse the louing son of your saluation, to imbrace his manifolde mercies, and to tremble at his iudgements.
Say not God is mercifull, and therein abuse him; he is farre off, and therefore deny him: a thousand yeares with him is but a daie, and therewith forget him: but remember with your selues, and consider wiselie, that all his wordes are truth, and hee hath saide long since, come, and will not staye: behold come quickly.
He hath girt vp his loynes, he hath taken his two edged sword into his hande, his trumpet is now ready to sound that great alarum of the day of iudgement.
His thousand thousandes of angels are ready to deuide the heauens, to inflame the aire, to dry vp the waters, and to shake the earth with all the kingdoms therein, and now he is comming euen at the doore.
Though some may thinke that my penne declyneth to this fading conclusion, rather by course of stile, than for the euidence of truth therein contayned, for the glorie of Iesu Christ, or for our dutifull readines against the day of our saluation: yet in so great daunger remaine not doubtfull through the flattering shew of sinfull delusions.
But rather, sith it greatly concerneth our soules health, let vs harken to that plaine voice of truth: when you see these things, then thinke that your redemption is at hand, and bee yee perswaded fully of the same by euident reason; by that which you see with your eyes, which you heare with your eares, which you haue felt with your sensuall bodies, not many yeares since.
And now after the meditation thereof, more truly vnderstand with your harts.
Whereby you are forewarned hereof euen by secret thoughts, when you lie in your beds, considering that the bridegroome of our eternal saluation is at hand.
Cast off the loue of this present world, scarce go backe into thine owne house, to thy wife, and thy little children; if thou bee at home within thy doores, goe not out into the field, to see thy cattell, or into the streets to bid thy friends farewell, or looke once aside from this present comfort, the redemption of all the godly.
Resolue thy selfe to giue account, to come to iudgement, for nowe the course of this worlde by all computation, is run out, all flesh is come to an ende.
And would you haue it set more plainely before your face? Lift vp your eies, and you shall see, that long since the figge tree is budded, the fields are all white vnto haruest, the heauens are shrunke in their seat, and waxen olde like a garment.
If you yet doubt, that the world is not at the point to bee dissolued, or that there is no such present appearance, why wee should looke for a newe heauen, and a newe earth: doe but looke backe a little into the olde worlde, and you shall see plainely, that the time is nowe expiring.
There bee but twelue houres in the day, and if ye will calculate exactly, there bee eleuen of them and fiftie nine minutes past.
Hee which standeth on the hil toppe, he seeth the enemy a far off, the vigilant watchman, he saith, that euerie minute hee perswadeth himself, that he heareth the trumpet sounding: Surgite mortui, venite ad iudicium, arise ye deade, and come to iudgement.
The world was created in six daies, and perfected in the seuenth, whereby the ancient, writers learned by coniecture, out of the prophesie of Elias; also by proportion, that the world should remaine six thousand yeares, and after that, should succeede the eternall sabaoth of our soules.
Fiue ages by all mens computation are past, now we liue in the sixt, whose yeares nowe already past, argue, that the sequell of the sixt is also at an ende.
Of those six thousand, which long since the learned aimed at, already bee expired and hee which with his word did create the world, and at his wil shal destroy it clean, euen in the twinckling of an eie: he hath promised that the daies shalbe shortned for his elect chosen childrens sake, which seemeth likely that the day is euen now appearing in the heauens.
If wee looke a little into the deepe visions and reuelations of Daniel, in which the course of times seasons to come in the latter end of all, was plainly reuealed vnto him, wee may easily gesse by that which is past, the course which is yet to come.
Hee which hath seene the rising of the sunne, and marked the course therof, fiue daies togither from the rising to the setting; and the sixt day, he marking howe it did rise in the morning, howe it was eleuated at noone, howe it beginneth to decline, when it draweth into the west: hee will haue a shrowd gesse, when it is towardes night.
So likewise let vs but a little tourne ouer the two and twentie bookes of hidden conference, which according to the sixe daies of creation deuided the world into three tooes.
The infancie, which is two thousand before the law: the strong age which is two thousand vnder the law: the old age, which is two thousand vnder grace.
Let vs rise by proportion from two to foure, which bee the foure astrologicall trigones in the heauens, executing the influence of the seauen planets, and that by the ministerie of the foure elements: in order proportionating the foure great Monarches of the world.
Hereunto if wee shall adioyne the regiment of the seauen mouers or spirits, which the Lord hath placed vnder him, by the course of nature, according to his secret decree, to dispose the elementall creatures here below: we may gesse to our great comfort by that which is past, that the end is at hand.
The trigonicall course of constellations haue alwaies begun, proceeded, declined, and ended, after the same manner in the heauens: beginning the first of creation, at the first degree of Aries, the head of the fierie trigone, so passing through the earthie, the airie, the watrie, till it ended in the last minute of Pisces, the full and perfect period of the watrie trigone.
These trigones as they alwaies passed after the same fort in the heauens, so commonlie the same or verie like successe fell out in the earth, and the same spirit of planet entring the rule of the world, the same or like euents followed here on earth.
The world (as Plato diuinelie writeth) was created in fier, euen in the signe Aries, the head of the fierie trygone.
At which time Orifiel, the first planeticall angel, or spirit of Saturne, began (according to the disposition of the Almightie) to rule the world.
After whom according to the processe of the foure trigones followed Araell the spirit of Venus Zachariell the of Iupiter, Raphael the spirit of Mercurie: Samael the spirite of Mars: Gabriell the spirit of the Moone: Michaell the spirit of the Sunne.
Each of them ruling the world three hundred and foure yeares till the ende of that great watrie trigone, in the taile of Pisces.
At which time according to the computation of the seauenty interpreters, and that learned Beda, the watrie trigone ending vnder the reigne of Gabriel the spirit of the Moone, within few years, after issued that great vniuersall flood.
Vnto this day the trigones with the regiment of the seauen angels or planeticall spirites according to the appointment of God, successiuely tooke the disposition and regiment of the world, beginning in the fierie trigon vnder the spirit Orifiell passing on to the other trigons, whose particular proceedings if should declare with the whole course of the successe effect of that which followed here vppon earth: shewing, that as the constellations changed in the heauens, so commonlie there followed alterations of kingdomes, of states, of prosperity, and aduersity, of famin plenty, of alteration of lawes, rules, people and nations, the rising continuing and ending of Monarches, mighty Empyres: it were a more demonstratiue, and forcible way.
But because it is tedious to shew this course perticularly from the beginning of the world vnto this day.
When Orifiell began his dominion ouer the world first, then men were naked, rude, liuing abroad.
To whom when Arael the spirit of Venus succeeded, then began they to bee more handsome, and to loue one another.
After him Zachariell the spirit of Iupiter succeeded, vnder whom men began to build and to rule one ouer another.
To this Raphael succeeded the spirit of Mercurie, vnder whom caracters, and writing, and musicall were first inuented.
To this succeeded Samal the spirit of Mars: vnder whom though the Hebrewes accou~t that the flood was, yet according to the account of the septuaginta, Isiodore, Beda, and Tritemius (who prooueth this assertion by the same rule of multiplicatio~) the flood was afterward vnder the dominion of Gabriel, the spirit of the Moone.
Because it were both obscure and tedious, to shew from the beginning of the world vnto this day, euery course of these trigones in the zodiach, and euerie dominion of these planetical spirits, with the effectes which followed here on earth, to the end that wee may vnderstand a secret truth sufficient to warne euery one which loueth the Lord, to be ready, sith his day and comming seemeth neere at hand: will onely shew some effects of the watry trigone: especially what followed when it ended, as it did lately in the tayle of Pisces, with the appliance of the effects of Gabriell the spirit of the Moone, who last of all begun his dominion ouer the world, the yeare of our Sauiour his incarnation
and shal rule (vnlesse the Lord shal cut off those euill effects) til the year one thousand eight hundred seaue~ty nine, eleuen months.
For the more inciting of vs vnto the consideration of our state, and this present age in which wee liue: let vs call to minde the words of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ: who when he forewarned his Disciples of the last day of doome, (which now hangeth ouer our heads:) then (saith hee) looke vp, for your redemption is at hand.
He which biddeth vs looke vp, hee first created man vpright, to behould the heauens, not minding to make vs gase at nothing, but hee hath set some cleere obiect for vs to behold aboue.
And because heauen is aboue, and earth below, looke vp vnto the heauens, and behold the starres which (as the Scripture faith) are fixed therein for signes, times, for years and dayes: sith the Lord himselfe in the creation of the starres appointed them for signes and seasons: and sith the Son of God hath bid vs looke vp to them.
Let vs not regard the coloured speeches of the ignorant: (who beeing a ridiculous generation, would faine seeme that which they are not.)
But let vs looke vp, we shall see straunge signes in the heauens, such signes as hath not bene since the beginning of the world vnto this day, and were not, nor could not well haue bene found out of vs, if wee had not had cunning, and expert Astrologers amongest vs.
The apparance of these prodigious sights in the heauens: do bid vs consider, that the sixe thousand years are almost ended, that the sixt age of the world is inclining it selfe into the graue: that the fourth Monarch (though Liberatie verie learnedly addeth a short defensiue for the same) is now languishing.
The starres were appointed for signes seasons: this is a great signe of the decaying of the fourth monarch, in that the watrie Trigone is now expired vnder the which the fourth monarch had the beginning.
The same two great planets Saturne and Iupiter, being conioined in Scorpio, Iulius Caesar being then in the height of his imperiall pride, which was fortie seuen yeres before Christ.
That learned Liberatie argueth strongly on the contrary, to an other conclusion than will name; affirming that no constellation decaieth his owne proper effect.
It is lawful for all men to beleeue what seemeth most likely, and when all is doone, the conclusion is meere coniecturall, but yet by many probabilities.
This for our instruction let vs mark, after the passing of these six thousand yeares, six ages, foure momarches, and now the fourth Trigone newly ended; that the world also is drawing towards and end.
With this lette vs consider, howe often this constellation hath had issue from the beginning of the world, together with the dominion of Gabriell the spirit of the Moone, who ruleth now.
And therewith let vs consider the effectes which followed them.
Anno mundi, the watrie Trigone drawing to an end, Gabriel the angell of the moone, began his dominion ouer the world, and what followed? men being then giuen to pride and lecherie, to feeding their bodies and not their soules; to regard the kingdoms of the earth, not the kingdome of heauen: not regarding that learned Noe, the seruaunt of the Lorde: the cloudes were dissolued aboue; the fountaines of the earth were opened below; the seas were let loose abroade; the waters flowed outragiously ouer the whole earth, and drowned all worms and beasts, all fowles, all men, women, and children, all liuing creatures of the earth, except Noe, and those which hee tooke with him into the Arke.
After this general destruction of the whole world in the ende of Pisces, the spirites of the planets together with the Trigones, proceeded successiuely, till at the length, in the ende of the dominion of Samaell the spirit of Mars (vnder whome the destruction of Troy was complete) Gabriel the angell of the moone beganne the second time to rule, in the ende of the watrie Trigone.
And what followed? that mightie Monarchie of the Assirians was destroyed, and came to vtter ruine vnder that Sardanapalus.
Also the kingdome of the Macedonians, the kingdome of the Syluians ended, and the Romanes began, together with the captiuitie of Babylon amongst the Iewes.
Thirdly, the Trigones and planeticall spirits proceeded successiuely, till the same watry trigone ended againe, the fiery entring six yeares before the birth of Christ, and what followed? There was great change throughout the whole world.
The sacrifice of Moses did cease; the oracles and idolatrie of the heathen came to an end; the Gentils were called to be partakers of the true faith; the empire of Rome was subdued and brought vnder the lawe of the Gospell, which began vnder the fiery triplicitie.
After which the succession of the trigones proceeded to the end of the watry trigone, which was about the yeare of our Lord
And what followed? Mahomet the Arabian, brought in the sect of the Saracens, by which the Romane Empire, and the profession of christianitie decayed together in Asia, besides many wastings destructio~s in the church, recouered againe by Charles the great.
From that time to this, the trigones haue passed their course successiuely in such sort, that nowe the watrie trigone is once againe expired in Pisces, and the fiery newly entred in Aries, together vnder the dominion of Gabriell, which ruled in the time of the floud, and in the destruction of the first Monarch.
And what shall followe? God knoweth, and no man, no not the angels in heauen.
And yet let vs not be so blinded with the cloudie fancies of the flesh, that we should our spirituall vnderstanding.
But let vs looke vp to heauen, and behold the great signes, which the Lord sheweth in the heauens; especially let vs fixe our cogitation on that strange star, which he shewed vnto vs fifteene yeares since.
Which though it appeared amongst the starres of heauen, and that in the place of a starre (so that none but Astrologers could perceiue the same) yet it was a straunge sight to all the learned which beheld it.
And so much the rather, because it was found to bee placed verie high in the aethereall region aboue the sphere of the moone, a faire, cleare bright, calme starre, round and euen, but brighter than the starres of heauen, it was exceeding strange to the wise and learned, because there was neuer any such like seen, since the first creation of the world vnto this day, but at the comming of Christ.
Though some olde Chaldeans note, that the like appeared to Noe, fifteene yeres before the floud, therfore seemeth to be a signe vnto the world of such an effect, as neuer was in the world before, vnlesse it were the comming of that holy one, the Lord and sauiour of the world.
It appeared in the heauens, not in the eleme~ts; whereby we gather, that it signifieth an euent from heauen.
In a signe which neuer setteth, and that a whole yere together, which forsheweth an eternity.
The signe wherein it appeared, is Cassiopeia, which by the Aegyptians, and olde Astronomers, is figured a virgin sitting in a chaire with a braunch in her hand, which likely resembleth the state of iudgment.
Sith therefore after so many generall courses, of the Trigones, of the monarches, of the dominion of the planeticall spirits, the Lord hath shewed wonderful signes of his comming in the ayre, in the water, in the earth: and lastly aboue all, hath held out his hand in the heauens, shewing vs that he is nowe opening the doores of heauen, and comming to iudgement: and that the doome of all creatures is now dawning.
Let vs wisely weigh consider, the exceeding great power and maiestie, wherewith the Lorde of hostes shall come to iudge the earth.
Though he was made man for our sakes, and for our saluation: yet bee yee not so carnall in your cogitation, or so bewitched with the delaying fancie of sensuality, that you shuld imagine his power to be compact after the manner of men: that when hee is mustering his thousandes of angels (as Enoch prophesied long since) that wee should heare of it before, and that after we heare of it, he should be long in comming.
No, the Lord will bow the heauens at his pleasure, and come downe euen in the twinckling of an eye, according as it is written: euen as the lightning breaketh out of the East, passing forthwith into the West: euen so shal the comming of the Sonne of ma~ bee.
Hee is not like to the earthly princes, that hee should sende his harbinger before.
But am is he: most monderful, most holie, most mightie, in whose presence the angels are not pure, and the heauens corruptible.
Hee spake the word, and they were all made: and at the sownd thereof they shall all be consumed.
He shall kindle the fire of his heauy displeasure against the sinners of the earth.
Hee shal cleaue the heauens asunder, and the flame shal breake forth like a furnesse.
As were the dayes of Noe, a generall destruction, with the voice of mourning and weeping, and deadly lamentation: as was Sodom that sinke of sinne, and Gomorrha that euil nurse of iniquitie: as the fier and brimstone rained downe from heauen most ruthfully, firing, wasting, burning, destroying, and sincking those wicked cities: so shal bee the comming of the sonne of man.
Hee shall shake the heauens aboue, and make the hell below to tremble, the trompet shall sownd, euen the trompet of the God of heauen and earth, the sownd thereof shal rend the clowdes of the aire, it shall make the fowles to shrinke with feare and to fall downe dead on the earth.
Therewith the sea shal flee from the woonted course, and the flouds shall roare, the earth shall swell, the creatures thereof shall be amased, the ayre shall thunder and lighten, the elements shall melt with heat, the starres shall fall from their spheres, and the light shall vanish from before the face of all men then liuing on the earth: as it was foreshewed by the prophet long since.
This is like to be a black day, a glowming day, a day of fire and smoke from the heauens, a day of anger and wrath, of bitternes and teares, of lamenting and vtter destruction on the earth.
Then shall feare come on all men liuing, and the inhabitants of the world shal be agasht, when they shall see that with their eies, which maketh our hartes quake when we remember it.
The prophet long since hath giuen vs warning thererof, and many yeares agoe hee cried alowd, blow vp the trumpet in Syon, and showt in my holy mount.
Let all the inhabitantes of the land tremble, for the daie of the Lord is come, for it is now at hand: a fier deuoureth before him, and behinde him the flame burneth vp, the earth shall vanish at his presence, like a tempest: the heauens shall melt, the clowdes shall droppe, the Sunne and the Moone shall be darke, and the starres shall withdraw their shining.
There shall appeare fearfull wonders in the heauens, and in the earth, bloud, and fier, and pillers of smoke, the Sunne shall be turned into darknesse, the Moone into bloud.
Then shall wee see the powers of heauen to mooue aboue in the firmament, and the inhabitantes of the earth shall stand gasing, all amazed, and who is able to behold it? then shal the dead arise out of their graues, according to the sownd of the trompet, then shall all arise and come to iudgement.
The poore together with the rich, the old the young, the mightie, the simple the King, the begger.
The~ shal the poore of this world reioice, when they shal behold the heauenly countenance of the bridegrome, their louing sauiour and mercifull redeemer.
Then and in that day the Lord shall looke vpon his poore militant church, with a cheerfull eie and louing countinance.
Hee shall send downe his angels, who shal imbrace his louing children, take them vp into euerlasting ioy.
But as for the wicked and many of those which haue inioyed the great honor, auctoritie, pleasure, plentie and ioy in this world: he shall behold them a farre off.
Euen as the clowdy piller which was placed betwixt Israell and the Egyptians, was light to Israell, and darknesse to the Egyptians: euen so the chosen of the Lord in that day shal stand in the light, shine in the kingdome of heauen, as the starres in the firmament: but the children of this world, and those which made their heauen of this worldly treasure, shall stand still all amazed in hart: the Clowde of confusion shall compasse them about, and their faces shall be couered with the mantle of shame: griping shal pinch their hearts within, and their voice shall sownde out nothing else, but woe and alasse.
When they shal behould all their gould melted, their houses burnt, their hope cleane vanished, their landes suncke, and their friendes gone, they shall runne starke madde vnto the waters, all amazed vnto the mountaines, kneeling downe before them, and crying: couer vs and our iniquities.
couer vs from the face of him that sitteth on the throne· their consciences accusing them, they shall hate the goods which they haue gotten euilly, and shall flie from those landes which they haue violently take~ from the poore, or from the holy church, fearing least it should open and swallow them vp into hell.
They shall flie from their houses, built with ill gotten money, least they bee consumed together with the flame thereof: great feare and vexation of spirit shal bee to the mightie men of this world, according as it is written: potentes potenter the mightie shall bee punished mightily, when the puissant princes of these earthly regions, shall stand all naked before all the world both good and bad, before the angels of heauen, and Iesu Christ now sitting on his throne, and all their deedes, yea all their secret doings therewith laid open: when they shal remember how negligently they haue looked to the woorship of the Lord, and how careful they haue bene of their owne estimation: how litle they haue bestowed on the house of God, and how manie thousandes on their owne painted pallaces: how little they haue bestowed on the poore of Iesu Christ, and haue exceeding much on their carnal friends in whom they delighted.
When those thinges shal come clerely to their remembrance: then shalbe fulfilled that saying of the Apostle.
Go too yee rich men, howle weep for the miserie which shal come on you.
Many and mightie shal be their wailings: it shall greeue them that they haue bin rich, when they shall see the blessings of the poore: their honour shal breed thought of dispaire and confusion in their harts, their faire lands which they made their paradise here on earth, shalbe a burning consumption in their co~sciences.
When the wicked shall see heauen open aboue, hell gaping belowe, and the earth melting away betwixt them both: when they shall heare that voice of ioy; Come ye blessed: and that voice of sorrowe; Go ye cursed into euerlasting fire: when they shall see the mightie put downe from their seate, and the humble lowly harted exalted: it shall greeue them, so that they shall vtterly loath all those pleasures which they haue so loued, they shall gnash thereat with their teeth.
But to the godly, to the penitent sinners, to those which loue his holy worship, and study to maintaine his poore members heere vpon earth: the Lorde of his great mercie will bestow his louing kindnes peace, with the fruition of euerlasting life.
Which he graunt vs, that hath bought it so dearely for vs, euen Iesus Christ the righteous, to whome with the Father and the holy Ghost, one most holy, blessed, and glorious Trinitie, be all glorie and honour for euer and euer.
Celsus of Verona his Dissuasiue to the renoumed Senate of Venece: shewing that since they enriched themselues with the goods of the Church, they are become vnable to resist their enimies.
IT hath beene the maner of many men (most entire Prince, and worthie Senate) oft times when they were to intreat of anie matter, truly to speak, to reueale, to comprehend, that in their speach which might please the eares of the hearers, or obtaine grace and generall good liking of all.
And on the contrarie, that which is right, which is profitable, which seemeth good and honest vnto them, that they openly refuse, and vtterly reiect, as a thing lesse pleasant, and lesse delightfull to the hearers.
But am farre of an other opinion, sith (as me thinketh) those men are greatly deceiued, and faile oft times of their purposed conclusion.
For whilest they seeke the glorie and commendation of men, by a seruile kinde of merchandise they fall into the pit of ignomie and discredite.
For what is more vnhonest, then with the colour of vertue and goodnes, deceitfullie to blinde the eies of our friendes.
What more vnseemely thing, then in the steed of truth, to place fained and forged errors? what is more filthie or further from all honest dealing; then by pestilent fauning and flattering, to induce mortall men into manie great and dangerous errours? these kinde of men are not to be accounted friends or welwillers, or yet good men, but rather to be esteemed as cruell enemies, vtterly to be detested of all men.
For who is able to recount what mischiefes, what losses, what pestile~t destructio~s they bring with the~? saie who is able to number all the great detriments, the charges, the discommodities, the dangers which thorough the wicked counsell of these parasiticall flatterers, and their deceitfull glosinges, not onelie priuate men, but all and the Dominions of all Princes haue sustained.
And it is no hard matter for them to attaine hereunto: sith they masking vnder the smooth visure of good will and amitie, with glosing wordes and fained flatteringes, they blinde the eies of those which beholde them, they intangle them, and they intrappe euery one not yet acquainted with their sleights, and in such manner, that they cannot possiblie discerne what is good and holsome for them: nor on the contrarie, what is ill and hurtfull.
They thinke themselues to bee such kinde of men, that of right and reason they shoulde bee commended: from which opinion innumerable offences doe proceede, sith heereby they remaine in most grosse errours.
Therefore at this present am not minded to treade in their steppes, but rather mind to prosecute· and to declare those things boldly, which though they seeme lesse plausible, or lesse pleasant, yet they are not forged or fained: but are such indeede, as become a true friende, and faithfull instructer, and therefore peraduenture, they will prooue not altogether vnprofitable, nor vnfruitfull: for the potions of Phisitions, oft times are bitter, but yet the same minister helpe and health vnto the diseased: the which thing also it behooueth me to do, euen to execute the same duelie, and to resemble the same person: whereby may more easilie and directlie recouer, the good health of those, which nowe lie still and languish.
In this respect if shall seeme to haue vttered anie thing more licentiouslie then might: doe not thinke that it proceedeth of stomach or malice, but rather that your minde (most excellent Prince) and theirs also, which are destitute of such admonitions, may bee stirred vp effectuallie, and in good earnest to take wiser and more holesome counsell.
In fine request you to accept this small treatise of mine, written rudelie and in a meane stile, which for that great loue and hartie good will which beare vnto your Honour, and that most famous Senate, haue determined with my selfe to dedicate vnto you.
If not onelie by my daily and deuoute praiers, but also by exhortations may profite you and your afflicted state, either with counsell or otherwise, with my profitable indeuour.
And now lest my speach should rome range too far (most mighty Prince) will begin to declare that which mind to intreat of at this time.
If by the way may but note and name this one thing, that therefore of mine owne accorde tooke this labour vpon me, that in no respect (so farre as my facultie wil extend) would restraine my selfe, but woulde supplie those things, would perswade those things, would admonish you of those things, which am sure nerely concerne the safetie and preseruation of that your most honourable and famous Senate, and (in these so great calamities and daungers) your perpetuall name and glorie.
NOt many daies since (most Noble Prince) trauailing through many Countries and Cities: spake with many rare excellent men, many famous mighty Princes.
In the midst of our talke oft times wee fell into the selfe same speaches, which are now common in euerie mans mouth: that is concerning the prosperous successe of the warres of the great Turke, a most wicked and professed enemie euen to the name of a Christian.
With which warres he persecuteth, vexeth, and cruelly tormenteth the Christians, with which hee striueth day and night, to root out the auncient Catholique faith.
In which thing we see plainely, that he hath preuailed, so long and so strongly, that hee hath leuied such strength of soldiers, both by sea and by land, that hee hath so furnished himselfe, with warlike power, and to conclude that he hath prepared as great an armie against the Christians (nay Italie it selfe) as euer Zerxes that great Potentate brought against the Grecians, whose armie (as it is recorded) almost couered the Seas with ships, and the land with footmen, wherefore the hugenes of such great preparation incredible power, must needes be great terrour to vs all.
Many such like matters, passed and ouerpassed, whilest we were talking.
At length our speach drew to that conclusion, how great, how lamentable, and how sorrowfull was the losse of your Iland Euboea, not to bee named without teares: then the which, there coulde not haue chaunced a greater, a more sorrowfull, a more lamentable losse, either to you or to the state of all Christendome.
For thereby most cruell warre, and extreame daunger is threatned, not onely to you and to your dominions bordering on the seas: but likewise to Italie it selfe, and to our Catholique faith, a most grieuous euersion and vtter destruction is attempted.
Wherefore wee haue great cause to feare, lest the name of Christendome be now in daunger to be vtterly extinguished, together with the Catholique faith, confirmed with so many labours, with so much bloud, with such and so many agonies of Iesus Christ.
For nowe the axe is laide to the roote of the tree, our cruell enemies are before the dore: now the shores resound againe with the great force of warres which approch them by Seas.
Nowe (vnlesse it please God to helpe vs from heauen) death and destruction doe come vppon vs. Who is able to represse the cruell force of this deuouring beast? who shall disanull his deadly attempt? who is able to terrifie him from his purpose, alreadie puffed vp with the hope of victorie.
Through the multitude of his people, and the greatnes of his victories, he counteth his dominions to litle· for desire of rule and Empire hath no meane.
But howe much the larger the dominion is, so much more the desire of rule encreaseth.
Wherefore hee will easily be persuaded that in time, hee may also obtaine the whole dominion of Italie.
In truth this is the full height of his wish: he euen gapeth after this most greedily; to this purpose he frameth all his studie, all his cogitations, all his counsell, all his deuise and pollicie.
The same occasion which mooued Alexander of Macedonie or Iulius Cesar (whome hee propoundeth to follow before all others in higher sort then is the lot of mortall man) to seeke the conquest of the whole worlde, mooueth this man also most earnestly, thus to seeke the inlarging of his dominions, through his victorious acts, to become famous with al posterity: which hath been no small prouokement, to the most ingenuous excellent mindes, to attempt the greatest hardest aduentures.
Now the~ by emulatio~ of their glorie, he indeuoureth to shew himselfe like vnto the~, through the example of their renoume, desire of praise, he seemeth daily more more to be inflamed; which hee so much the more earnestly desireth, how much the waie is broader, and the entrance easier, through this his last victorie.
In which respect (as it seemeth to many) this death calamity of your Euripus, is the greatest most to be lame~ted of all others: the which many thinke and affirme that God of his righteous and iust iudgement, hath brought vpon you: for your insolent taxing and pouling of holy thinges, belonging to the Church, and your iniurious troubling of the state of religion.
It likewise hapned not long since, to that most famous citie Constantinople, renoumed through the whole world, which in time past was the sea of the Romain but (as remember) for a greater crime.
For although without great grief we cannot wel remember that vnfortunate slaughter: yet all men can well witnes, that their lamentable calamity, miserable destruction came vpon them by the iust iudgement of almighty God, for the long obstinate discord, departing of the Grecians, from the true faith.
What signifieth the destructio~ of the Pisans which in times past gloried that they were of so great power and dominion? did not all things prosper well with the~? was not their kingdome safe, sure both by sea land, so long as they imbraced religio~ with great reuerence? but afterwards whe~ they laied wicked violent ha~ds on the Church, and the Ministers of the high God, then they were brought into many aduersities, many great losses, many miserable calamities, so that they did not only lose their dominion rule, but they became bondslaues to their enimies.
Where, let no ma~ maruel if of late it hath hapned in like miserable sort, to your Ila~d for it is the saying of all people nations that your expeditio~ of Achaia, had so lame~table so vnhappy a conclusio~ for your diminishing and taxing of the liuinges belonging to the Church.
And in like sort all men account that the death of your Euripus was the iust iudgement of God for your iniuries and polling of the Church.
Wherefore if we will waie this matter wiselie, if with iudgement wee will looke into our owne doings, we haue great cause, say wee haue great cause to feare (that if you remaine in this minde and disposition still) the rest of your Ilands and Cities shall be subiect to the same calamities and destruction.
Neither can we hope that our afflicted state shall bee repaired, so long as the iust cause of our ruine, still remaineth amongest vs. These thinges, and such like, are often heard in euery place, which were too long to repeat, at this present.
Now this one thing is sufficient to be heere mentioned, that many thinges are reported abroade, not vncertainly, nor obscurely, to the great discredit and disgrace of your most famous Senate, by reason of your great compilation and pilling of holy things.
Wherefore to say the truth in regard of that singuler good will, obseruance, which beare vnto your honorable Senate: doe not a litle lament your estate, in that am desirous to hear those things of you and your happie estate, which belong to high praise, to great glory and renoume.
cannot but bee greatly grieued, when consider how low that great honour and worthy fame of you is fallen, which (and that worthily) thorough out the whole world, and amongst the furthest nations, was thought incredible.
For euen as in times past, this most famous Citie excelled all others, in abundance of wealth, in plenty of all thinges, in high glory, in great dignitie: so also in honestie of maners, in holines of life, in iustice, faith, pietie, religion, and other vertues it far past them all.
Which good and vertuous practises, after they beginne to be forgotten, euen so likewise that auncient glorie and dignitie of your name, by litle and litle began to diminish: by litle and litle it began to bee obscured and therewith also distinguished.
And although am greatly grieued, when see so manie slaughters, so many calamities, so many and such ill proceedings, so many and so great disgracings of of your auncient dignitie, which are well knowne throughout all Italie: yet am of this opinion (vnder your correction be it said) which thinke that this new and vnusuall tasking and tolling of the Church, is the chiefe cause of your ill and vnhappie successe in those things which ye tooke in hand.
For when weigh with my selfe, and consider the course of times past, am easily induced to bee of their opinion: and to speake plainely, that which haue good cause to thinke, It seemeth that all your great losse and aduersities, proceed from hence as from a most corrupt and poisoned fountaine.
And that it is so indeede, it appeareth plainely to all men, which will recorde the most excellent and famous factes of ancient time, now to repeat the beginnings of your auncient exploits.
Who is so vnskilful? who so simple and so ignorant in all matters whatsoeuer, which knoweth not the beginning of this your commonwealth? how wonderfull, howe famous, how diuine it was, how greatly and in most ample manner it increased aboue the customable manner and course of all other Cities.
For all things fell out so luckily, and had so good successe; that all things therein seemed to increase, and therein also to flourish.
For in short space it became famous throughout the whole worlde, not onely in abundance of most pretious iewels, in sumptuous and magnificent buildings, in great strength and store of shippes, but also ye inlarged your dominions farre and neere, both by sea and by land.
And through your excellent wisedome, and the wise forsight of your ancestors, ye haue entirely preserued the same.
So that the force power of Italie (somtimes the Queen mistris of the whole world) could not at any time vanquish the same.
What then was the true cause of such great prosperitie and happie successe, vnlesse it were because there was neuer any Citie, in which either religion was more imbraced, or true iustice longer or more religiously preserued? hope it may be spoken without suspition of flatterie, for seeke to speake little in comparison of the thing, and the weight of the matter dooth passe beyond the bounds of my speech.
Who will not greatly commend the sincere and singular loue which your auncestors bare vnto religion? the great and inuiolable obseruance of iustice and holines? their exceeding great charitie and liberalitie towards the poore me~bers of Iesus Christ? their inestimable bounty towards the adorning and beautifiyng of holy temples, euen vnto this present day? This thing is manifest, both by the fresh memory of deuout me~, also by our temples richly adorned; and by our ample churches ful of holy monuments, which (as it is apparent) were built in times of olde, onely by the oblations and charitable deuotions of your auncestors.
For although they were alwayes accounted liberall and deuoute, concerning those things which appertaine to the worshippe of God, and their seruice towards religion: Yet notwithstanding when they began to bee oppressed with these calamities, and were so sore distressed: then especially by their good woorkes they earnestly required helpe from heauen: then euen with great distribution of almes, with great faith, with great deuotion, they did striue to please and pacifie God the giuer of all good things.
What diuers seasons, how vnlike or rather plaine contrarie obseruance of religion holy worship haue succeeded, had rather other me~ should iudge than I: for the thing is so plaine manifest, that he which hath but halfe an eye may easily see it.
Now return vnto the ages of your auncestors, who, as wee haue shewed, being so well strengthned, waged batraile against their enemies, in defence of their dominions.
They went forth into the field, and valiantly ioyned battaile: neither did they returne home againe, till their enemies were discomfited ouercome.
Wherefore Camillus deserued immortall fame, which (as Liuie writeth) oftentimes and earnestly exhorted the people herevnto.
Behold (saith he) ye worthy Romanes, either the prosperous or the afflicteed state of Rome in these yeares, and ye shall find most surely, that whilest we were religious, all thinges went well with vs: but when wee once neglected our dutie to religio~, all things went against vs.
And now (O worthie prince) howe much better were it with your whole commonwelth, if you would propound vnto your selues the most excellent discipline of your ancestors, and their worthy lawes concerning religio~? how much more wisely excellently were the co~monwelth ruled, if by the example of their high wisdome and noble actes you would waxe more warie; Out of question you should not be molested, with so many discommodities, so many warres, so many dangers: but as in times of old with the vanquishing of your enemies, you should obtaine victorie with great triumph.
But if you haue worse successe in these daies, than you looke for, or would no maruell when as the godly lawes of your auncestors by little and litle are cleane forgotten, when religion it selfe, and the reuerence of holy priests is lesse practised than it was wont, and lesse than reason would it should be.
Pardon mee pray you, if speake plainly: for most men, nay, almost all which are ruled by reason, are of the same opinion.
speake all this to doe you good, therefore you may more easily pardon mee.
And now let vs returne to that from whence wee haue digressed.
Those thinges were vnwisely neglected of you, which wee spake of before, and that truely: for those were the onely thinges which in times past aduaunced you your common wealth to such dignities, such glory, such happie fame.
Wherfore not without good cause, your happy successe, your famous spoils, your victorious triumphs, are come to an end: and now your great fame and glorie, the great auctority maiestie of your name, which hath resownded most famously through the whole world: which seemed wonderful to all people, princes, kindreds, and nations, is in hazard now to be extinguished.
Count yee nothing of this (O yee most famous Venetians? do you not thinke of these things? do you not magnifie all these? Marke pray you this one thing wisely: way and consider this one thing euen in your owne conscience, way this one thing truely.
How many victories, how many conquestes, how many spoiles haue you atchieued, against your enemies? how many happy euents haue you had in these so long warres, since you inuented this strange and pestilent councell? in that you feare nothing at all to lay violent hands on church goods, and holy things dedicated to God almightie: which impietie (beleeue me) will not helpe you one whit in these your great daungers, and extreame necessitie.
And although peraduenture it seeme not so to many: yet without all doubt as a most fierce piercing poyson, which with the deadlie contagion thereof, is woont to infect and poison all things, which come neere it.
Euen so your great strength and preparation to warre by your former impietie towardes the Church, is like (which God forbid) to bee cleane vanquished and destroyed.
Iulius Caesar would neuer haue admitted such wicked councel, though he were an heathen: who (as it is apparant in his life) whe~ he entred by chaunce into Aruernia, the me~ of that countrie pointed to the sword of Caesar hanging in their Church, as it were a spoile got from the Emperour by force of armes.
Caesar entring the Church seeing the sword, he smiled to him selfe, saying nothing: and when his frendes willed that it should bee pulled downe: Caesar in any wise would not suffer it.
Out of question hee did both wisely and religiously, for hee accounted the sword and all thinges else dedicated to holy vse to bee sacred thinges, therefore he thought it vnlawfull to touch them any more with carnal hands, or to haue them in any wise employed in humaine affairs.
Also your auncestors would neuer haue done so, they would neuer haue imagined any such thing.
Those ancient rulers much renowmed for their great wisedome: which being free from all danger, from aduersitie, from all extremitie, they would neuer haue hearkened to such counsell, nor haue accepted of any such subsidie.
And that most wisely, for they knew full well, that the best kinde of gouerment by which a common wealth is preserued, augmented, and encreased be two, especially: Religion, and Iustice.
Which when they are maintained, the common wealth is safe and sure: but if they faile, it must needes also decay.
With these kinde of artes and orders rather then by force of armes, they obtained this ample dominion, which is enlarged by sea and land.
But so soon as these excellent artes began to waxe out of vse, forthwith rhe Empire it selfe began to decay and come to ruine.
Which thinges if you will consider aright, ought to forewarne and stirre you vp into a greater deuotion, and more dutifull obseruation of Religion and holy thinges.
Neither ought these examples of your owne countrie affaires (which haue fallen out vnluckily) onelie bee a warning vnto you, but also that great care and dutifull deuotion, which your auncestors continuallie, and yeelded vnto diuine thinges, and vnto them whose function was to attend vppon the same.
Amongest the Aegyptians (as Diodorus affirmeth) all the yearly reuenues of the land, were deuided equallie into three partes.
The first part the Priestes did challenge to themselues, who were of such auctoritie amongest them, that al things were gouerned by their councell and wise foresight, being free from al burdens taxes, they had the second place of the rule and dignitie next the king.
Also the Indians diuiding the whole common wealth into seauen tribes, constituted the tribe of the priests in the first place, free from all burthen seruice, yeelding them great honor reuerence.
But yet in mine opinion concerning worship and dutie towards God, the Aethiopians did farre excell all others.
For with them the priestes and keepers of their temples were in such great honour, that they onely were the men, whom they thought eligible to bee their kinges: and that which seemeth vncredible, they were of such auctoritie and credit amongest them: that when they thought good, they gaue notice to the kinges, that they should die, affirming that it was the sentence of their gods: which was the cause that al their Kinges til the time of Ptolomy the second, obeyed the edict of the priestes, and willingly tooke their death at their appointment, not constrained but euen by old custome, being loth to alter the superstition.
Wherefore they boast, that they haue reaped this fruit and reward for that their great pietie towardes their goddes, that the inuasions of all their enemies, and that crueltie could neuer do them any harme, and that they were neuer conquered or subiect to any forraine nation.
For Cambyses that most mightie king of the Persians, whe~ he once assaulted them with a most dreadfull armie; most of his souldiers being destroied, with great ignominie he lost almost his whole armie.
Hercules and Dionisius hauing trauailed through the whole world, would not once trouble the Aethiopians, in respect that they were so religious.
For in the booke of Genesis we read, that in the dayes of old there was so great so strange a famin through the whole world, that corne and victuals were scarcelie to be had in any place.
The fiercenes of this famine was especially in Aegypt, pinched them sorer than other nations: insomuch that the inhabitants of the lande were compelled to sell their farmes, their possessions, and their houses, nay their houshold stuffe for victuals.
Which when they began to faile them, through the long and harde famine; at length, least through hunger they should die straungely, most miserably, they gaue themselues also into the kings hands.
Wherefore that religious steward of the king, hauing laid vp exceeding great store of prouision euen of purpose.
He bought the whole land of Aegypt (the possessions of the Priests excepted) and their countries into the hands of king Pharao.
From which time vntill Moses (as the scripture witnesseth) the fift part of the increase of Aegypt was paid vnto the king.
But those thinges which appertained to the priests, and the keepers of the temples, they were safe from this lawe; for Pharao did not onely giue them faire and large possessions, but also hee appointed that they should be duly fed and nourished all the time of the famine, by the common store and prouision, which was the cause that they sold not their possessions and goods as the other people did.
What should heere make mention of the Romans? did not they appoint a most solemne priesthood to the ministers of holie thinges? did they not alwaies imploie their greatest studies and paines in preseruing and increasing religion.
For (as Valerius Maximus saith) that citie preserued religion aboue all other things whatsoeuer, so that the highest and chiefest magistrates did willingly yeeld themselues and their seruice vnto holy rites, hoping assuredly, that they should attaine the chiefe rule and magistracie of the worlde, if they humbled themselues deuoutly vnto the heauenly power.
But to what end doe shewe these things, sith all bookes that euer was written, either diuine or prophane· are full of these examples and cleare monuments, and therefore read you those books, and peruse them diligently.
Neither thinke you that the priests and ministers of God (as some talke) should now be poore physitions, as they were somtimes.
But on the contrarie you shall easilie see, that in no age, in no time past, they were vsed so beggerlie, and so vnworthilie.
But if in auncient time men were so religious in their errour: howe deuout thinke you they would haue bene in the sincere worship of the true euer liuing God? Such manner of men ought we to be, which doe not worship fained idols or diuels (as they did) but that great creator, the maker of heauen earth, all things therein.
Wherefore desire (O most noble prince) desire most earnestly, euen for that great goodwill which beare to you your commonwelth, that you and those which be of your opinion, would alter your minds, and take better councell, concerning the church, the clergie, the landes and goodes once dedicated to the same.
Although you are not moued with those examples of your ancestors, yet at the least, let your late losses, present calamites ioined with ill successe, be a sufficient warning vnto you.
For doubt, of my truth am sore afraid; least if you go on with the same mind and purpose as you haue begun, you shal suffer greater aduersities, euen as those which are of a farre better disposition, haue plainly foreshewed vnto you.
In like manner (as it is recorded) it hath fallen out very daungerously to others in times past: for S. Augustine writeth in his booke intituled De ciuitate Dei, there was a great plague in Rome, both of women and of beastes, so that through the huge number of those which died, they doubted that all liuing creatures would finallie perish: and further also that winter was so exceeding colde, that the snowe (which was extraordinarie) laye of a great deapth euen in the market place, for the space of fortie daies, and Tyber was frozen ouer verie harde and thicke: Then (they saie) it was aunswered, that the cause of the plague was, in that many priuate men possessed, and dwelt in manie religious houses: which being shortlie after restored to their true vse, foorthwith that great and wonderfull plague ceased.
Qu. Fuluius Flaccus, as Valerius writeth, left a notable example behind him, euen an example to all posteritie, concerning the contempt of religion.
For this man, though he were the controler of the citie, yet he scaped not vnpunished, in that (while he was in office) he tooke the marble pillers of Iunoes temple in the citie Locrine, and wickedly placed them in that house which he built at Rome.
For immediately after this fact, he fel into a phrensie, and was starke madde euer after, with fierce mad passions still consuming: till at the length hee hearing that of his two sonnes, which were soldiers in Ilirium, the one was dead, the other most grieuously sicke, he died most miserably.
By which great daunger the Senate and people of Rome not a little mooued, decreed presently, that the marble pillers should bee carried to Iunoes temple, from whence they came, that thereby the impious fact of the Censour might be corrected, and by that excellent example they might note vnto their posterity, that whatsoeuer is once dedicated to the immortall God, cannot without great impietie be altered in anie wise; though it bee imployed to some other honest and very good vses.
And if anie should bee so wicked and irreligious, that they should attempt to violate prophane holie thinges; yet they should vnderstand that the Senate would take it greeuously, that they would be fully reuenged of the~ for the same, euen vnto death.
On the contrarie Xenophon writeth finely and excellently, concerning Agesilaus that famous Emperour, that hee alwaies with great diligence and studie did seeke to reuerence the temples of his enemies, thinking it reason that the immortall God ought to bee trulie worshipped, aswell amongst his enemies as amongst his friendes.
And likewise the religious and deuout persons, euen amongest his enemies, he would not suffer them in any wise to bee molested: for he said it was vnreasonable and a most barbarous crueltie, to take any one thing from the Temples, and holy Churches, or that the priestes should bee at any charges, or losse in any respect.
Wherefore hee hated such wicked euen vnto the death, hoping thereby to vanquish his enemies, and to strengthen his owne power, the which conclusion prooued true, as appeareth by that which is excellently written of Mithridates in the life of Lucullus translated out of Greeke into Latine by Leonard Iustinian that noble conncellor and father of your common wealth: for whilest hee assaulted the citie of the being tributorie to the people of Rome, and that with an exceeding great power, both by sea and lande, by and by a sodaine tempest rising, and his victualles failing, hee was vtterlie vanquished by Lucullus: the greatest part of his armie being spoiled and destroied in the fight.
Afterward, when he thought to saue his life only by flying, againe hee was so afflicted with a straunge sodayne tempest, that leauing the ship in which hee was, which through the outragiousnesse of the tempest, was almost readie to sincke: hee was constrained to yeelde himselfe into the handes of pirats.
They report that Diana worthily afflicted him with that great ouerthrowe and calamitie (which they accounted a goddesse) because most iniuriouslie and irreligiouslie, euen with wicked handes, hee spoiled her temple, and presumed to take her ymage from thence.
No lesse horrible chaunce there was amongest the Romane armie euen on the like occasion.
For when Carthage a professed enemie to the Romanes at length was woon of them by force of armes, a certaine Romane Souldier (contemning Religion) in the spoiling of the Citie was not afraide to committe sacriledge, taking away the goulden vesture from Apollo, who was woorshipped as a GOD, of all men: but he escaped not long vnpunished, for that wicked fact, in that the most righteous God of his iust iudgement, brought it so to passe that the handes of this were found cutte off amongest the peeces of the vesture: wherby other afterwardes might bee taught, how carefully wee ought to keepe our handes from violating holie thinges.
Wee may alledge manie such like examples out of holie Scriptures, especiallie as it is written in the booke of the Machabees, Antiochus that wicked king yeeldeth vs a plaine example: which vaunted himselfe so prowdlie, and so arrogantlie aboue all measure, that hee seemed to himselfe as though hee could commaund the flowing of the seas, and reach the heauens with his finger.
This man contemning the holie religion of the true and eternall God, was not afraide with wicked and prophane handes to spoile that faire and famous Temple of the Iewes.
Though hee hoped to escape the vengeance of God, yet he escaped not long: for of a sodaine hee was stricken with so daungerous horrible plague, that out of his bodie there issued abundance of woormes, and with most horrible torment to him, they issued out of his flesh, hee yet liuing.
Hee beeing woonderfully mooued with this plaine and manifest punishment sent from God, at the length hee remembred himselfe: and at the last, when hee could not abide his owne stinke, it is meete (saith hee) to bee obedient vnto the Lord, and for a mortall man not to seeme a God vnto himselfe.
Furthermore hee promised, that hee would adorne the Temple (whose ornamentes and pretious plate hee had taken away a little before most wickedlie) with many and wonderfull giftes: and that hee would abundantlie, supply all the charges belonging to the sacrifice with his owne reuenewes: and to conclude, that hee would be circumcised.
But when after so manie barbarous mischiefes and outragious spoilings of the Church, hee seemed vnworthie of mercie, he ended his wicked life as he was worthie.
The like also happened to Legate to the King (as wee reade in the same Booke, in the like matter) for beeing sent of the King to take the treasure of the Church: whilest hee executed his commission committed to him, verie stoutlie, as manie as obeyed his sacrilegious commission, presentle (euen by the power of God) rushing downe, they were amazed, and cleane confounded.
Heliodorus (a sodaine sight appearing vnto him from heauen) forthwith was stricken to the ground verie sore wounded in sundrie places of his bodie: then without all hope of life, a great number of souldiers thronging about him with a few he was drawe~ out of the place halfe dead, which imediatly before hee entred with great pride and hawtinesse: by and by through the prayers of the priestes, he recouering hauing vowed manie thinges, his commission not executed, hee returned with his armie vnto the king, where when hee had priuatlie and publiquely signified the apparition which hee had from heauen, and which hee had felt in himselfe through the handy worke of God, the king asked him what messenger hee thought meetest to goe againe to Ierusalem on this businesse.
Saith hee, if you haue any enemie or traitor to your person, send him thither: for though he escape aliue, yet he shall returne well whipped, sith in that place there is some diuine power and Godheade: for the most mightie Creator of heauen and earth, which ruleth and disposeth all thinges by his great prouidence wisedome, is the sure keeper safe defendor of that place.
Whosoeuer therefore without respect of religion shall offer force vnto him, or violent hands, let them not think to vnpunished: for hee pursueth them in such sort, afflicteth them with so great calamities intollerable torments, vntil they suffer iust punishment for their deserts.
Of this matter you neede none other witnesse than my selfe, which made triall not not long since in mine owne person.
am afraid (O most noble Prince) least that which (as said) did lately chance vnto Heliodorus may also be the sorowful lot of those which exact tribute fro~ religious me~ houses, both because they attempt that, fro~ which if they were wise they should kede themselues free.
but especially, because some men rush vpon it outragiously, without al respect of religion, or their poore estate.
am perswaded it is farre inough from the intent and purpose of your noble most wise Senate; that through these exactions the priests and ministers of God, which are continually busied in diuine functions for the soules health of all men, should suffer any iniurie.
But yet in priuate conferences, haue rather obserued it, that by this meanes and vnhonest endeuor, they seek to gratifie your noble Senate.
Wherfore their actions seeme too austere, too cruell, and vnreasonable.
For vnles their money be ready euen at the appointed daye; presently there commeth in the vnmercifull receiuers of such exactors, they offer force and violence to the poore priests, they raile on them, they miscall them, they wound them with contumelious and opprobrious speeches, they violently take away their goodes and houshold stuffe, they prise it, they sell it, their gaine is almost more than the value of the paiment.
Those which doe these things, are they to be called Christians? can we perswade our selues that God will forget such haynous offences? other sinnes, although they be greeuous; yet the Lords wrath being once pacified, by true repentaunce they are put away.
But if thou haue once lifted vp thine handes to spoile holie thinges, then, then it is high time for thee to tremble before the face of the wrathful God, the reuenger of all impietie, will come sodainely, he will take full punishment on the~, euen in his straight and fearefull iudgement: and now for the better and more certaine knowledge of this thing, we may well remember that most vnhappie death and destruction of Cn· Pompeius, on whom fortune at the first blush did laugh so fauourablie that (as Tullie saith) there is no man to be thought so fond, which within himself would wish such and so many high honours as God himselfe bestowed most plentifullie on Pompey, and yet because (as Liuie writeth and Iosephus the most cleare excellent historiographer of the Hebrews) he went about to take away the riches costly iewels out of the temple: he purchased a miserable death vnto himself.
For how sore a battail, and how vnhappie successe, had hee euer after against Iulius Caesar in Thesalia, and other places, also how miserably his head was strucke off, by Ptolomie, being but a boy (in whom hee reposed great hope) it is verie plaine and manifest.
The like euils or (as may saie) sisters vnto these; were those which happened to M. Crassus, going to warre against the Parthians: who were professed enimies to the Romaines.
He going to war when by the waie he had spoiled the foresaid temple of the Iewes, and (as Iosephus writeth) amongst other things had taken the golden piller out of the temple, which waied an hundred and fiftie pound waight in massie gold: and had broke it in pieces, and most wickedlie paid his souldiers therewith: afterward he fought against the Parthians with so hard and euill successe, that amongst al the great losses and ill aduentures of the Romaines, his is also numbred and recorded.
For first of all, his deare sonne, whom he loued tenderly, was slaine in the battaile before his face, and manie legions of the Romaine Soldiers euen the flower of their chiualrie were then also most pittifullie slaine, manie of ensignes were taken by the enemie, the rest of that armie which scaped the slaughter of the battaile by flight, were scattered into Armenia, Silicea, Syria.
At the length Crassus himselfe by the iust iudgement of almightie God being taken of his enemies, chose rather to kill himselfe then to be captiue to the barbarous people.
For he thrusting the riding wand (wherewith he did beat his horse) deep in at his eie, with that strange kinde of death, ended his wicked life.
Afterward his wretched head and his right hande once cut off by the barbarous people, and brought to the king Aristonicus, his enimies made an open scoffe of it, and they poured liquid golde into his mouth, as a man concerning religion of all others most vnworthie: signifying thereby that hee whose minde was inflamed with the feruent desire of gold, should haue his dead bodie euen burnt and scorched therewith, being poured red hot into him.
These be the rewaids, these be the presents, these bee the gaines and fruits of them which presume to take religious thinges vnto themselues, or vnder any colour whatsoeuer, to conuert them to other vses.
And as we reade that the Lord punished these men most grieuouslie for their contempt of religion: so also we finde it plainelie written, that to the deuout, and religious, God of his iustice hath giuen great benefites and prosperous successe in all things which they tooke in hand.
For it is written of Alexander the great (a most inuincible king) that concerning diuine worship and orders of the Church, hee was alwaies most liberall.
For when he was yet but a young man, and in the midst of his sacrifice, he took both his ha~ds ful of frankensence and sweet odors for offerings: Leonides said vnto him, Alexander, whe~ you shall once haue conquered those lands, which beare those odours frankensence, then you may sacrifice largely, but now more wiselie sparingly.
Alexander answered, Leonides pray thee, when thou desirest prosperous successe, deale not niggardlie with the gods.
Of who~ we reade in Iosephus, as also in other auncient histories, that he bestowed many excellent great gifts vpon that holie temple of Ierusalem, and that with his owne hands he sacrificed vnto our God.
He so reuerenced Iadde the high priest of the temple, that lying prostrate on the earth, hee adored him: he also commanded that the priests and ministers of the temple, should boldly freely require what they would: and among other magnificent giftes, hee graunted them this one thing, that it should be lawfull for that nation, to liue by their owne lawes for euer, and also that seauen yeares, all the Countries of the Iewes, should be free from all kinde of tribute.
Lastlie he decreed, that what Iewe soeuer would goe to warre with him, should be verie gently and honourably intreated.
He hauing done all this in so good order, as a man strengthened by God, with a good courage he passed forwarde with his armie towardes the Indians, verie stronglie, and with great expedition most victoriouslie he conquered Porrus, that mightie and almost inuincible king of the Indians.
ca~not but wonderfully co~mend that worthie ma~ Themistocles, who notwithstandig the rest of his noble excelle~t vertues, yet he excelled especiallie in giuing due reuerence vnto religion: of whom it is recorded, that (publique affaires laid aside) if he had anie leisure, hee would bestowe that in beholding the beautifull furniture of the Church, in viewing the gifts and offeringes which were in the holie houses.
Wherefore he was verie careful lest any man should pull down or deface any thing there, or lest any thing should be wanting, which he knew did appertaine to religion.
And if these men nowe mentioned were so deuout, and superstitiously religious in seruing their false gods, how much more ought we Christians so to doe, which retaine the knowledge of the true and eternall God? with what care, with what diligence, with what studie, with what indeuour, with what pietie and reuerence, ought we to imbrace the true vnfained religion, with which the true Creatour of heauen and earth is truelie worshipped, which not onelie giueth vs these earthly and temporall goods, and prosperous successe in our offaires, without the helpe of anie other, but also after this life, giueth eternall blisse, and happines vnto the soule, if so be we haue liued here well: which benefites the gods of the gentiles could not only, not giue to them, which worshipped them, but they could neither profit nor hinder them in anie thing, without the assistance of God.
If we read that anie time they haue either profited or disprofited men, we must thinke that it came by the permission of God, and that so much more righteous, as it were more secrete.
Neither can there bee anie thing done iu the worlde without his commandement, who is the fountaine, the spring, the roote, and beginning of all things, and who onely ruleth, moueth, and preserueth the world.
Wherefore if you desire to inioie the fauour of God, the giuer of all good things, you must indeuour your selues with great care studie and diligence, that in anie wise the integritie of holie worship and religion, bee more seriouslie regarded and kept.
That there be no impiety committed against the holie Temple, and goods dedicated to God.
That there be no vnworthie fact co~mitted on your parts, against the priests ministers of God.
Into which kind of impietie if at anie time wee shall fall, let vs assure our selues that God will bring vppon vs the same plagues and punishments, which those false gods, or rather the true God sent by them vnto those which despised them: so much more grieuoulie and seuerelly as the offence and sin committed against the true and high God, is greater and more hainous then that which is committed against false gods and deuils.
beseech you mark and see most clearelie how prosperouslie all thinges succeeded with them, which reuerenced God truely and the holie things dedicated to his worship: what miserable ends they had, which contemned or prophaned them.
Neither is it maruaile if your affaires scarce prosper, if you sustain many discommodities, dangers, calamities, and ouerthrowes, for your exactions and pollings of the Church are not such, that they doe deserue anie helpe from God, they are not such, that they can turne awaie his vengeance and displeasure, which nowe hangeth ouer your heads, out of doubt they are not such that they can promise you good successe or victorie in your warres.
Your opinion doth greatlie deceiue you, if you thinke so.
If you bee so perswaded, beleeue mee, you kill your selfe with your owne sword.
Neither doe these exactions helpe you one whit, but rather (much like to the poison of Ietalie) detriments, dangers, losses ensue thereof.
To conclude those do not mittigate the wrath of God nowe kindled against you, but rather they prouoke and call for it dailie.
Wee reade in Trogus Pompeius (a most eloquent man, and of great authoritie) that one of the kings of Fraunce called Brennus, when he had conquered the Macedonians by force of armes (as though earthlie spoiles were of no account with him (he turned his force to the spoilings of the temples of the gods.
In scoffing manner answering that the rich gods, ought to bestow on mortall men.
And therefore when he made expedition towards Delphos, minding there to spoile Apolloes temple (where there was great store of gold siluer) of a sodain there arose an Earthquake, with which a great part of the mountaine rushed downe, which destroied almost the whole armie of the Frenchmen.
And Brennus himselfe beeing sore wounded in many places, and not able to indure the paines and exceeding anguish of his wounds, he killed himself with his owne dagger: and so for his bold attempts, he had his deserts by deserued death.
Whe~ had co~pelled the Citizens of Locris to giue him a great portion of the treasure of the goddesse Prosorpina, whe~ he was sailing away loden with his wicked praie: he and his whole nauie by force of a sodaine tempest, was beaten against the shores of the goddesse: on which the money being found againe, it was restored to the olde custodie of the treasurie.
But what should speake anie more of these things? for feare me that if should comprehend all the examples of auncient times, appliable to this purpose, in this treatie, that shoulde keepe no meane in writing of the same, for they bee so manie that they can scarce bee numbered, omitte the example of Qu Cipio who beeing Consull, when hee had sacked the Towne Tholosam, and that there was found much golde and siluer in the Temples of the same Towne: whosoeuer presumed to touch anie of that golde in that spoile, in lue of his deserts, hee died therefore in most horrible griefe and anguish.
omit Xerxes the king of the Persians, which sent foure thousand soldiers to Delphos to destroy Apollos Temple, which companie was cleane destroied with lightning and tempest: that Xerxes might vnderstande thereby, the greater iniurie hee offered to God, so much the lesse his force shoulde bee to resist.
Which reuenge truelie may bee applied to these our daies, for wee haue seene it oftentimes chaunce in like sort vnto you, euen in these daies, since you beganne to take the goods of the Church into your owne handes, and to paie Souldiers wages therewith.
For (as you your selues can witnesse verie well) not onelie your Shippes full fraughted with munition for warre, were destroied with diuerse tempestes, with thundering and lightning from heauen: but also manie thousandes of souldiers afflicted with diuers calamities died most miserablie: so that none or verie fewe which you sent vnto the warre, came safe home againe.
Tell me (O most renoumed Venetians) how should these strange ouerthrowes, these strange slaughters and destructions of men, these manie calamities and miseries come? but that this your warre is not onelie against man, but also against God, and his true worship? a worde in this matter is inough.
Now mind to applie my speach vnto these our times, and to couclude with domesticall examexamples, for we must not content our selues, with the examples of auncient times, if our owne bee appliable also hereunto.
Especiallie sith manie will saie vnto me, why doe you propound vnto vs, the examples of the Pagans temples, and their wicked gods? why doe you rehearse their reuengementes against their enimies? sith by the hand of God at length they were all taken away? To whome may well answere in good time: that make mentio~ of those heathe~ gods, to the end we might thereby vnderstand, how seuere a reue~ger our God (eue~ the God of all Gods) of his iustice ought to bee vnto those, which presume wickedly to take away the goods of the church and transport them vnto other vses: sith that those which were falselie called gods, and which indeede were no gods, (or rather God himselfe by them) sent such cruell plagues and punishmentes for the contempt of their religion.
The cause why the most righteous God permitted, that they which were rather deuils then gods, should so grieuouslie punish men, was, because forasmuch as they knew they contemned the true religion, and the true God.
Sith those idols were most wickedly contemned of them, which (though falselie) yet the whole people tooke them to be true gods, and they seemed to these men, which spoiled them so wickedlie, to bee true gods indeede.
Wherefore God himselfe brought iust punishment vpon them for this contempt of that which they faithfullie beleeued to bee God.
And nowe in these daies that cloud of ignorance beeing cleane remoued: sith he is more barbarously contemned of vs, surely he will punish vs more seuerely greeuously.
But nowe (from whence wee digressed) let vs returne vnto these of our time, to tell what great death slaughter chanced to that wicked Fredericke the second, for violating the libertie of the church.
shall not need many words, for that is plaine inough to those which read the histories.
For when he was made Emperor by Innocentius the third, and had taken the crosse in his hande against the enemies of the Christians: then (euen vnto his owne vndooing) deuising most vnhappily with himself, how he might take away the goodes of the church now dedicated to holy vse: he was not afraid to take them wickedly, and to imploy them prophanely: herevpon hee became so blinde in his owne opinion, that hee made a sacrilegious pact with the mightie king of Aegypt the Soldan, concerning the suppressing of religion religious houses, and concluded that, from which a christian man ought especially to abhorre.
But hee did not long escape the iust vengeance of God.
For after that he had spoiled many cities, after many dissentions had with the church of Rome: after that hee had deuoured many temples, after many most cruel barbarous sacrileges: hauing his own sonne in a ielousie, that he affected his Empire, he shut him vp in most filthie dungeons til he died.
And he feeling the great grieuous censure of the church (as the righteous God had appointed) he was strangled of his own sonne Manfredus most cursedly.
Here will not omit the like calamities of the princes of Carraria in the like impietie: for when they began once wickedly to challenge to themselues the ordering of those things, which belong only to holie function, by reason of the pestilent councell which they had taken: very soone after they lost that famous citie Patauium, most strong both by situation force, which was thought almost to be inuincible.
Neyther fained he which wrote that saying; Vnlesse the Lord keepe the citie, the watchmen watch but in vaine.
And vnlesse the Lord of hostes doe helpe, truly he laboureth but in vaine, which leadeth the armie forth, trusting onely to his owne wit and pollicie.
So also did that holy woman Iudith sing before the Lorde, when she cut off the head of the insolent Holifernes with his owne sworde, she did sing most excellently in this manner: Lorde thy power consisteth not in the multitude of an host, neither in the strength of an horse; but the praier of the humble and meeke, was alwaies acceptable before thee.
Wherfore if you put your confidence in your strong and mightie nauie of goodly ships, and do not seeke to please God with good works, and more diligent deuotion in your religion: ye haue good cause to feare least (whilest yee haue offended him) hoping for victorie, yee striue in vaine; when according to the heuenly saying of Dauid, wee must rather put our whole trust and confidence in the Lord: these be his wordes: Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but in the name of the Lord our God wee shall obtaine the victorie.
With this force your ancestors did ouercome their enemies both by sea and land most victoriously: with this kind of fight they obtained many victories and glorious conquests.
But yet they neuer tooke councel once to touch holy thinges, the goods of religious men, that they might imploy the~ on warlike affaires.
Read your histories of auncient time, reuise your old monume~ts, you shal neuer find that they sought any waies to strengthen themselues with the goods of the church.
Lastly propound vnto your selues the late example of Philip.
Maria: who whe~ he had good successe in al his affairs, al things fel out with him aswell as he would wish: at length he gaue ouer himselfe vnto such madnes, that al feare laid apart, he challenged church goods vnto himselfe.
But marke howe duely he suffered worthy punishment: for being wearied with continuall warres, he not only lost a great part of his dominions, his enemies besieging him eue~ hard vnto his walles; but also he suffered dangerous grieuous diseases in his bodie, so that hee being blinde, lead a most sorrowfull life a long time after: but what became of his Empire, and by what meanes his noble family is now cleane extinguished, no succession left at all, it may easily appeare to euery man, the thing being yet so fresh in memorie.
To what ende (say some) haue you set downe so many examples, of Gentils, of Pagans, of Christia~s? haue briefly gathered al these together (O most noble prince, you most renowned Venetians) for that goodwil and dutie which owe vnto you, to your commonwelth, to the end that they which are addicted to this opinion of spoiling holie things, might both by auncient examples, and also by their ill successe, he moued to take better cou~cel, also that euery man may know right well, that there was neuer anie (not onely in our time, but in the times of olde) found, which stretched out wicked handes vnto holie things, who prospered any long time after, and suffered not the present punishment therof: the which pray God to turn fro~ you your dominio~, by which exa~ples (least should be too long) be ye afraid (O most worthy Venetians) if ye persist any longer in this your purpose, feare and tremble, least so many daungers hanging ouer your heades, yee bee compelled to suffer greater greeuouser.
Thinke not that God wil leaue it vnpunished in you rather than in others.
The wrath of God proceedeth gently vnto reuenge, but hee recompenseth the slownes of his wrath, with the greeuousnes of his punishment.
Neuer was there any excellent ruler in the co~mon wealth commended for dwelling too long in the selfe same opinion, but as in sailing if you cannot attaine the hauen, it is the point of art to yeeld to the course of the tempest: But when you can attaine the hauen, hauing turned saile, it is a follie and meere madnes, to followe that daungerous course, in which ye were before; so ought wee to doe in the gouernment of the commonwelth; neither ought wee alwaies to followe the same councell and aduise, but that which wee are sure bringeth honest and profitable, good and happie successe to the commonwelth, that is to be followed, to be imbraced, to bee retained most constantly.
But if it be discerned to bee hurtfull to the commonwealth, all men knowe that it is follie and rashnes to followe that with daunger, which we may easily leaue with safety glorie.
Nowe (O worthie Venetians) harken vnto mee a man most desirous of your prosperous estate, take better councell for the safetie of your selues and your affaires, retaine ye the name of Venece (most famous thoroughout the whole world) in more religious manner than ye do: Remoue these diuers and tempestuous calamities (which are ready to fall vpon you) with more wholesome means, that with such councel ye may foresee, what most belongeth to your own faires, the commonwelth, whose safety cannot stand without yours.

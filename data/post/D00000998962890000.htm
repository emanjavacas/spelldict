valiant monmouth revived
or an account of young jemmy's great victory in his last engagement with the french
to an excellent new french tune sung at the duke's

when out of england we did go into flanders if you would know and in ostend for to lie because the french were got so nigh
fa la fa la fa la fa la

but when in that garrison we did lye then on the straw most pittifully which caused many a brave souldier to dye
with a fa la

at length an order there did come that to the french we must be gone with fife and drum we march along
fa la

but when from ostend we did march with merry looks and chearful voice against the french that was so strong so chearfully we march along fa la

but when to antwerp we came nigh aboard of the bilinders we did hie and there we was forc'd all night to lye fa la

but when at brussels we drew near we heard the french they had been there but that was so strong they could do no good there
fa la

ten days and more we did them pursue thinking of their army to take our view but they away from us did fly not caring for our company
fa la

at charleroy we sound them out and there we gave them such a damnable rout that they were forc'd to wheel about fa la

the duke of monmouth most valiantly rode foremost of our whole army and he brought us again where the french did lye fa la

saying chear up my hearts of gold for in england it ne're shall be told that ever our english boys did fly but all resolved for to dye fa la

seven hours and more we did them fight till at the last we put them to the flight but it was so late that we lost them that night
fa la

ten thousand french on the ground did lye besides what was wounded mortally there we left them to remain until we did return again
fa la

but the dutch most cowardly behind our backs all day did lie and would not bear up for company
fa la

on the next morning by break of day we drew up our selves in battel aray but the dutch got all the plunder away that the english had fought for all the day
fa la

but the french most cunningly all night within a wood did lie and march'd away most privately
fa la

fifteen pieces of ordnance we took that day that they against our bodies did play and the prince of orange has them to this day
fa la

and now the holland wars is done every english man to his own home where we will drink good ale and beer and with our friends will keep the new year
fa la fa la fa la fa la fa la fa la fa la

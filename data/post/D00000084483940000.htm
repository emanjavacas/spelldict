the case of john peachey esq elected one of the burgesses for portsmouth in the county of southampton to serve in this present parliament

that the said burrough of portsmouth is an ancient burrough and as such hath in all ages sent burgesses to parliament as appears by the most ancient and returns now extant in the tower
that very rarely or never before the time of henry the eight or henry the seventh any burroughs procured any charters to elect burgesses for they were then and before so far from desiring it that they in respect of wages often petitioned to be excused for poverty many times lost it by disuse and for want of claim
that the burgesses for parliament have in all ages as will be made appear as well by the ancient returns by scheduls as also by the first indentures extant and by the indentures in all kings reigns since been chosen by the commonalty of the said burrough and the election of them so is not restrained by any charter granted the corporation to a fewer number which if it had been done yet would not have taken away the commons right to such choice which they before had and enjoyed
that mr peachy the fifteenth of february last while he was in london was unanimously chosen by the freeholders and commons whereof neer eighty were freeholders
sir john kempthorn having about fifty for him and those for the most part of the incorporate burgesses now pretends a sole right in the corporation to those with exclusion of the commons
that if the commons right to this choice be not asserted no choice can be there indifferently made for they allow all incorporated persons to a choice and have made free of their incorporation so many viz
captains lieutenants ensignes captains lieutenants pursers boatswains and so many builders and other persons of dependence that those of the corporation which live in or neer the town as householders are not considerable to the other in number or boldnesse
tis pretended that for two or three times last past the corporation solely hath elected and returned
resp
although the late returns be made under the and by the name of incorporation as for some time it hath been and as is done in other burroughs incorporate where yet the commonalty have a share in the election yet the commons at the times appointed for elections have claimed their right and concurred in the election so long as persons fitting were proposed but now for considerable reasons have differed therein
the now major mr shales being an officer at the dock and so a man of dependance and sir john kempthorn being the kings commissioner of the dock there the said major would not although often desired and advised return mr peacheys indenture
against which injurious dealing mr peachey on behalf and for asserting the commons right hath petitioned the honourable house of commons for relief
the same town deserves great and speedy consideration at this time of danger both as to its fortifications and provisions which have been much neglected as will appear by inspection but by whose default know not

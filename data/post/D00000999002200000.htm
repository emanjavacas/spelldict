a friends advice
in an excellent ditty concering the variable changes in this world
to a pleasant new tune

what if a day or a moneth or a yeare crown thy delights with a thousand wisht contentings cannot the chance of a night or an hour crosse thy delights with as many sad tormentings fortunes in their fairest birth are but blossoms dying wanton pleasures doting mirth are but shadowes flying all our joyes are but toyes idle thoughts deceiving none hath power of an hour in our lives be reading

what if a smile or a beck or a look féed thy fond thoughts with many a swéet conceiving may not that smile or that beck or that look tell thée as wel they are but vain deceiving why should beauty be so proud in things of no surmounting all her wealth is but a shroud of a rich accounting then in this repose no blisse which is so vain and idle beauties flowers have their hours time doth hold the bridle

what if the world with allures of her wealth raise thy degrée to a place of high advancing may not the world by a check of that wealth put thée again to a low despiced chancing whilst the sunne of wealth doth shine thou shalt have friends plenty but come want then they repine not one abides of twenty wealth and friends holds and ends all your fortunes rise and fall vp and down rise and frown certain is no state at all

what if a grief or a strain or a fit pinch thée with pain or the feeling pangs of sicknesse doth not that gripe or that strein or that fit shew thee the form of thy own true perfect likeness health is but a glimpse of joy subject to all changes mirth is but a silly toy which mishap estranges tel me then silly man why art thou so weak of wit as to be in jeoperdy when thou maist in quiet sit

then if all this have declar'd thine amisse take it from me as a gentle friendly warning if thou refuse and good councel abuse thou maist hereafter dearly buy thy learning all is hazard that we have there is nothing biding dayes of pleasure are like streames through fair bliding wealth or woe time doth go there is no returning· secret fates guid our both in mirth and

thus are the joyes of a year in an hour and of a moneth in a moment quite expired but in the night with the word of a noise crost by the day of an ease our hearts desired fairest blossoms soonest fade withered foul and rotten and through griefe our greatest joyes quickly are forgotten séeke not then mortall men earthly fléeting pleasure but with pain strive to gaine heavenly lasting treasure

earth to the world as a man to the earth hath but a point and a point is so defaced flesh to the soul as a flower to the sun that in a storme or a tempest is disgraced fortune may the body please which is onely carnall· but it wil the disease that is still immortal earthly joyes are but toyes to the soules election worldly grace doth deface mans divine perfection

fleshly delight to the earth that is flesheth· may be the cause of a thousand swéet contentings but the defaults of a fleshly desire brings to the soul many thousand sad tormentings be not proud presumptuous man sith thou art a point so base of the least and lowest element which hath least and lowest place marke thy fate and thy state which is onely earth and dust· and as grasse which alas shortly surely perish must

let not the hopes of an earthly desire bar thée the joyes of an earnest contentation nor let thy eye on the world be so sixt to hinder thy heart from unfained recantation be not backward in that course that may bring thy soul delight though another way may seem far more pleasant to thy sight do not go if he sayes no that knowes the secrets of thy mind follow this thou shalt not misse an endlesse happiness to find

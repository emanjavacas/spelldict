some remarks upon the bank and other pretended banks with reasons humbly offered to the consideration of the present parliament for establishing a real or a money and land bank under a regular managery with unquestionable controuls and checks upon them by philalethes
the bank of england crept into the world not being in any votes by that name but an act for grantting to their majesties several duties upon tunnage of ships beer ale for securing certain recompences to such as should voluntarily advance on a fund per cent perpetual if not redeemed by parliament this was for the king to pay dear for the money as he doth to h.c.a.s.b who will not account for what they have received whereas if it had been in the votes that such a bank was intended there were those that would have given the king as much for it or lent a million gratis for years which by a more regular managery might have redressed grievances done acts of charity and have been more advantageous to the kingdom and since the settlement of that bank many being excluded consulted with dr chamberlain with whom they pretended to join in his but robb'd him of some notions he had and afterward set up for themselves one for a the other for a national
then they and the usurers having no more wit quarrel'd and expose themselves in print to that degree that they appear'd most notorious in their principles and practices
besides their art of by which many families have been ruin'd and one was to have part of the prosits and the other per an for ever above what he could make by his art in managery and the same persons telling the they should have of the value of their land at or per cent
interest and to get in told them if they came in with their money in a short time they would make if not per cent if they made haste least their books were fill'd and shut up in such a time and they excluded
this mighty prospect of advantage they were to make out telling the that in a short time would circulate made several persons subscribe both money and land tho many of their gang that did so to help the work on had neither except some worthy members of parliament that subscrib'd intending for a publick good which gave them both life and reputation
then the usurers by and a rod for the fool's back were whipt about as in truth they deserved it for by their geting subscriptions and making people keep up their money and pay nothing but clipt or bad on purpose to make their bills pass on little land and less money
now we may hope by their quarrelling they will make good the proverb that when knaves fall out honest men will come by their own and that their joining together will not give them more credit but rather less for the two johns in nubibus in conjunction in the house of venus being filled with mercury are run retrograde into the square of saturn latet anguis in herba

that the king may be served with millions and upon his terms on the fund proposed but not by the general or national by the projectors contrived but upon a real or a money and by reconciling the monied and increasing trade supplying the defects of money the improvement of land to

the great benefit of the publick and of every individual member of it grounded upon the reasons following viz
as all natural bodies are the best directors for the establishing the most regular and most certain effects so all other bodies whether politick or artificial which are the contrivances of men are most sure when they are best suted to that of the natural
as for example if the monied and mutually agree by a regular and honest managery they may let the have money on their at or per cent per annum they being trustees for their own money and their own and others lands makes all others that deal with them safe and get if not per cent by the and nrich and make the easy by the improving their estates
a demonstration of this is plain

if the printed calculations of the value of the land of england be true that it's worth between and millions and the money of the kingdom about millions and not millions good but suppose the land to be millions then there is but millions of good money that might circulate which is but million to which with some difficulty of late hath served turn then in proportion we may well admit that one will negotiate or circulate ten so that if the give per cent to the usurers or widows that live upon the use of their money or all that can be lent and you lend it on at per cent per annum then you get per cent but if you find your own money in stock or bank by what you subscribe then you have per cent for your stock and this will be but for or years till the value of your bills is understood and then they will circulate themselves when so you will have the interest of or millions for nothing which is per ann to inrich your bank and supply the defects of money and that these few millions we are like to have of mill'd money or truly valuable gold may be imployed in our trade and attend our manufactures and growth and circulate them for the benefit of the publick and to improve your lands to above if not years purchase
this method may serve the government but then this is by one sort of a money and and on a better basis than any banks now in being which may lend or millions on a good fund at per cent and in a short time get as much but if we are millions of people as is presumed we are no less then there may be millions thousand persons that have little advantage by it
but it will inrich those that ingage in it which may be about families because money in such wise and rich hands in time may negotiate ten which will be at least or per cent but in or years after much more being their bills will pass more current than money but at first must be negotiated with money till it's better understood and put in practice but for these few years last past the badness of our money made the bills of very ordinary goldsmiths as well as bankers that set up the company pass and better approved than either silver or gold except tho years ago it was foreseen by capt a stamp who offer'd a million to have all the money and plate recoined and mill'd to prevent counterfeiting and clipping abating weight of the ounce but sterling silver
but if tallies or bills were made current by parliament upon a real at per cent it would be more valuable and advantagious to all by having trustees chosen to the people's entire satisfaction let the profits which is the interest go towards the charge of the war when once understood will be more preferrable than money but it being a new thing it will require or years to put it in practice as

the did which is of publick use
now says the country gentleman or the freeholder philalethes you said enough of the profits to make the people that live upon high interest and the rich monied and to join their stocks to let us have money at or per cent but at the same time tell us that tallies or bills on a real is most advantagious to all but without money to make them circulate it will not easily be put in practice under or years in which time the usurers and the money and may be hard upon us tho we pay but or per cent
if it fall into the hands of those rich or cunning sparks that are joined who have called one another in print impudent libellers or those cunning men that got the king's money t.p.h.c.a.s.b
if the parliament cannot get them to account how shall we that have no money but land do it if they exclude us the managery for that reason will shew you tho not in debt and have no money to spare how to improve your land and have money for almost no use and also the that are in debt to be made easy if not grow rich by letting both them and you into the profits and managery of the money and till a real can be settled if the money and do not answer your ends as am sure it will if you keep out the in print and the and be careful in the managry as can shew how if commanded or desired for the practick part is beyond the theorick
therefore will demonstrate here the as well as the monied may have their shares in the managery and in the profits of a money and which the of the bank will accept of
as instance suppose a not in debt or one in debt takes up or on per an good land at or rather per cent from this bank he may have in money to use or pay debts and in bills which you are to note are as good if not better than money being on a and the bank will thankfully accept them as money in stock if you please so then you have in that is which in time may make you if not per cent
but suppose at present but or if per cent then you have the use of your for nothing
so every man that wants money that borrows of his land may if he please by this method put into the bank and then he hath the use of the other for nothing or he may put in or what he pleases into the bank and then he doth not only get the other for nothing but may have great profits from the bank as well as share in managery and this is true and honest without tricks
or if those gentlemen that borrow upon their estates at per cent
will as could demonstrate it's their interest they should lond or supply the king with a part of what they take up on a real made current he will then have no occasion to borrow two millions any other way and their land will be improved in five years time to a much greater value than what they lend the king
but if the honourable house do not incline to it then by subscriptions as the bank of england for recompences
to a money and will do well as aforesaid
and whereas at first the bank of eng gave per cent
for money to negotiate their bills per day is sufficient or rather to abate per cent
of interest money will please

will not omit telling you what the or others have said in their printed papers sometimes the land of england is worth or millions and that one half of it is mortgag'd or at least which calculation is false and

a sham though we may presume that a or part may be engaged
then we will suppose a short scheme of ten millions at per cent
which is a part to be sunk from per cent to will save them near per an
which well imployed will be a great improvement to their estates and also by letting that interest go towards the defraying the charge of the war will save them near per annum which will be a good annual fund to raise three millions and a half to pay at time or a fund to pay interest for above millions and besides all charges of offices and officers
as instance pro bono publico
admit millions which is the part at per cent
per an that is per an to continue for years will raise and pay millions and a half
but suppose millions which some call an
but we will admit a part which is much short of what some projectors pretend to know there is occasion for the interest of which millions at per cent
is per an
which in ten years pays millions and a half debt
by this scheme the freee holders get almost as much as they give the publick but if it save their land from being tax'd then they get by this of the real millions and a half in ten years time which will enable the king and his subjects to carry on the war with vigour until his majesty becomes conquerour

note there hath been much giddiness in print about the subjects of banks and there may be bills and bad titles those are to fright children but there are men of understanding can prevent all these fooleries by managery
the parliament in their great wisdom may for the present settle methods as they please if nothing in this is approved but it's humbly prayed that no bank be so established but redeemable by parliament and not to prevent better ways and means that may be offered by any other for the future or proposed by

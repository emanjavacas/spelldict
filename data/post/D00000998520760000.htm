epigraph

pro
a wounded spirit who tan beare

in this verse salomon setteth out vnto vs the summum malum as may terme it the miserie of miseries that can in this life fall into the sense of man
a misery which who so feeles in extremity hee would dare say excha~ge it with the extreamest of tortures that mans cruelty can devise to inflict
a wounded spirit
and he amplifies it in a comparison of vnlikes
protasis the spirit of a man will sustaine his infirmity that is all other miseries conscience pacified can solace and sustaine
apodosis but a wounded spirit is an evill intollerable who can beare it

the spirit of a man that is co~science setled in peace thorough feeling of gods loue will sustained
affords solace and support to all other afflictions
its saide of gods people they endured

with ioy the spoyling of their goods viz having conscience assuring them of gods favour and promised recompence of the macchabees

they were stoned hewen a sunder slaine with the sword banished famished and yet endured
our home martyrs with what chearefulnes bare they the violence of fire so mighty a supporter of mans weaknesse is a pacified conscience

but a wounded spirit that is conscience it selfe distressed when that that should solace all other afflictions is it selfe discomforted that hell who can beare

that is to say none without speciall and even extraordinary grace sustaining
of it consider we two things

the nature of it what a wounded spirit is

the attribute here given it intolerablenes who can beare it

a wounded spirit is a co~science distressed thorough feare or feeling of gods wrath due for sin
the wound is distresse the sword gods wrath piercing sometimes by feare more then feeling sometimes by feeling and the the wound is bleeding
the degrees of it are three

that which is called

compunction or the pricking of the heart in comparison but as the pricke of a pin to the gash of a sword a lighter distresse if any of this nature may be light according as the lord is pleased to respect our infirmity
and with this it may be some enter into gods kingdome
a seco~d degree is that which is here called the wounded spirit when conscience is plunged into a deeper distresse thorough more fearful apprehension of the terrors of the almighty

the last degree is that which the psalmist cals the

contrite or broken heart
a heart as it were ground to powder with the weight of gods wrath pressing it
and these different measures might be all exemplified in gods children if daily experience did not evidence them the same man feeles sometimes lesse sometimes more remorse being not alwaies in like measure in any

from which different degrees of this wound something may be inferred by way of reproofe of sundry of gods children
as some yee shall finde of gods childre that thinke this their misery that they can in no greater measure feele the burthen of gods wrath due for sin

in their conscience
now if this were their griefe that they can in no greater measure grieue for their sinnes such griefe should cherish but whiles they wish for a greater wound then the phisition thinks expedient for their strength say as our saviour to the sonnes of zebedee

they know not what they aske
for can yee drink of the cup canst thou beare the burthen of thy sins this wound intolerable as salomon thinketh it art thou able to endure we are not ignorant of

satans wiles we haue great cause to feare if the lorde should farther presse vs least we should be swallowed vp of sorrow
luther speakes excellently to this purpose god many times keepes from his servants the horrible and gastly aspect of their sins in wonderfull mercy least the horror of them and gods wrath due for them should overwhelme vs
and this remember if you endure the least pricke of this sword it is meerely from grace not from any strength that is in nature

an other sort there are they as heavily complaine of the depth of their wound as the church in ieremie

see if there be any griefe like mine wherewith the lorde hath afflicted me in the day of his wrath was ever any so far plunged in distresse and here often begin almost to quarrell with god himselfe and murmur at his hand vpon them that when he leaues other miscreants in vtter senslesnes of their spirituall estate he thus heavilie presseth and only not oppresseth them
to whom let this advise suffice

let them consider that the cause of their wound is in and from themselues

their sins procured it god only as a iust iudge inflicts it

let them weigh withall that not only extremity but even eternity

of this horror they haue deserved even that which say hath

the worme that never dieth the fire that never goes out
and thinke they much if the lord for a mome~t chaste that he may for ever haue mercy
tell me thou that murmurest whither thinkest thou rather to be chosen a conscience wounded or a conscience seared a hart ground to powder or a heart past feeling of sin or wrath certainely though it be true that salomon speaks a wounded spirit is an evill intolerable yet if thou hast any rectitude of iudgement thou wilt easilie acknowledge the state of a man wounded farre better then the state of one hardned in these respects at least

that sense of the wound driues to seeke remedie

yea

prepares makes fit to be cured

let such remember what the lord speakes to the apostle

his grace is sufficient and he perfects his power in our weaknes and hath promised

not to suffer his to be tempted aboue strength

lastly let it not be forgotten that vsually comforts are

proportioned to afflictions the lesse the wounde the lesse the comfort the more the trouble the more plentifull the consolatio when god is pleased to grant it
and of the nature of this wounded spirit thus farre
whereto will adde one thing of some consequence before proceed to the attribute that is touching the subiect or persons into whom it is incident and thus propound the question

whither this misery may fall into gods children or whither it be peculiar only to the vessels of wrath to this the answere is that not only castawaies or men vnreconciled to god but even vessels of election yea the

dearest of gods saints actually partakers of adoption are subiect vnto it
yea more all gods children except these only in whom the lord workes extraordinarily as infants sooner or later in one measure or another are thus wounded

gods children therefore consider in a double time
in the act of their calling
after their effectuall vocation

in the act of their calling when god is bringing the out of the power of darknesse it is generally true of al they feele it or else are never truly called
and this is evident not only by instance but by generall doctrine
elihu describing the lords proceedings with his childre in their first conversion thus sets it out

god speakes once and twice and men heare it not
then opens hee the eares by his corrections which he hath sealed by this especially here mentioned as appeares by effects thereof described in the processe of that text
our savior professeth

he heales not the whole but the sicke came not to call the righteous but sinners that is that feele their sinnes and grone vnder the burthen of them to repentance
and therefore this once dare avow none ever had conscience truly pacified that first felt not conscience wounded

now whether a man after he is in state of grace may feele this wound bleed a fresh is a greater questio with some thorough their weaknesse though if we co~sult with scripture and experience the question is out of question

all these things saith elihu truly will god worke twise or thrise with a man that he may turne backe his soule from the pit
examples are frequent see david

complaining that hee had

no rest in his bones by reason of his sinne his moisture and marrow consumed with the extremitie of this anguish

compare ps
iob
that place especially is eminent

cor
there was giuen me saith the apostle a pricke to the flesh many interpret it of concupiscence and the stirrings of lust but impertinently and against the circumstances of the place for stirrings of lust are no gifts of god neither are in any respect to be reckoned amongst infirmities which paule would reioice in rather vnderstand it of this sting of conscience which he felt pressing him downe to the nethermost hell in his sense that was erst taken vp to the highest heaven

if any demand reasons why the lord is pleased thus to deale with his children these may be assigned whiles we set downe the diverse kinds of this wound according as the ends of inflicting are diverse
the kindes are fiue
penall inflicted for punishment properly so called such was that of

cain and iudas meerely penall a beginning of their hell wherevnto castawaies many enter even in this life

castigatory for chastisement of some particular disobedience such

that of david a chastisement for his sinnes the like of many of gods children so long as they hold on their course of obedience without interruption so long

mercy is vpon the and peace as vpon the israell of god but if once they shal turne their liberty into license when once that peace of god ceaseth

to keepe their hearts within the bounds of obedience farewell then their peace till repentance be renued

god then writes bitter things against them and makes them possesse the sinnes even of youth

probatory

for triall such probably was that of iob chiefly for triall and such perhaps is that of gods children sometimes most strict in obedience

for prevention of some future sin so paul

least should bee exalted aboue measure
god in mercy before hand letting vs feele the smart that he may affright from practise of sinne
saith bernard quando{que ei qui peccato quovis obligatus tenetur

piè immittit dominus amaritudines quasdam quae mente occupant hominis expellunt perniciosam delectationem peccati
god often in his loue seeing vs intangled in some sinne casts into our soules some bitternesse to possesse the minde and to expel the pernicious delightsomenesse of sinne
the last is of mixt nature partly for chastisement partly for triall partly for prevention
and of one of these foure kinds is the distresse that any of gods children feele

if any would knowe how to put difference betwixt this wound as it is felt of gods children that which is meerely penall in aliens let him consider the different effects or consequents thereof according as the persons differ

thus workes it vpon gods servants in the first feeling of it glad they are to advise with any that is able or likely to afford them comfort and resolue what ever the prescription be to giue way to it in their practise

what shall we doe say souldiers people all affrighted with iohn baptists thundring sermon

what must we do to be saved say the distressed iewes as if they had said prescribe what thou wilt be it never so harsh to flesh and blood never so crossing to profit pleasure reputatio any thing we are resolved to do it that we may obtaine comfort

that a castaway ever comes to so peremptory or steddy resolution thou shalt hardly finde

to a child of god

the interpreter that one of a thousand that declares to a man thus perplexed gods righteousnesse wilbe for ever welcome

his feet beautifull that brings the tidings of peace reco~cilement with god
is it thus with an alien longer then he hath vse of a minister

the wound once felt makes for ever feareful to offend gods childre once scortcht with the flame of gods wrath for ever

dread that consuming fire from others whiles they are vpo the rack we may hear so~e good speeches seldome see performa~ce whe gods ha~d is removed

such yee shall see wonderfull

compassionate towards others in like miserie what they haue felt themselues they ca~not but commiserate pitie in others by experience of sorrowes they learne compassion

such yee shall see of all others men of strictest practise and those little sinnes as some tearme them which others swallow without scruple they carefully fly from as odious in the sight of god
more might bee annexed but this shall suffice for explaning the nature of this evil a wounded spirit

the attribute followes which is intolerablenes
who can beare it that is to say none without speciall and extraordinary grace sustaining
the intolerablenes of this evil meane not at large to amplifie hearts that feele it easily acknowledge it and am loath to multiply their feares those that never felt it till they feele will not beleeue
only take taske by the fearefull extremities it hath driven many into

iudas was not alone in his discomfortable end but hath had alas for pitty and hath

daily many followers

skin for skin all that a ma hath he wil giue for life but life yea if it were te thousand liues me that feel this wou~d in extremity with out hope of release wil prodigally cast away to be rid of this torture

the feares it affrights withall are strange

they flie saith salomon when none pursueth even

at the noise of a leafe shaken tremble at their owne shadow yea are

a terror to themselues
affraid saith david and affrighted

where no feare is

yea what extremities hath it brought gods deare saints vnto iob the mirrour of patience yet vnder this cross so impatie~t so vnlike himself that

he wisheth for death

david the ma after gods own hart it draue if not to blasphemy yet to some thing neer of kin to blasphemy
the like or greater might be insta~ced of others

heathens to expresse the horrour of it set it out in that fiction of hellish furies following the flagitious with burning firebrands and torturing with all extremities
it may perhaps seeme strange this evill shoulde be so intollerable paines of the body many by fortitude haue outborne yea paines of fire some not only martyrs but miscreants haue endured other griefes of the minde time or counsell or necessity or something digests
what should be in this point of conscience to make the wou~d so intolerable respon
there are in this evill two things eminent more then in other
first whereas in all other afflictions man hath to doe with man or at worst with devils in this man co~flicteth immediatly with god himselfe fraile man with the almighty god sinfull man with the holy god

whose eies are pure and can endure no vncleane thing to stand before

him that is in his wrath

a consuming fire

whereas in all other evils a man is still a friend to himselfe in this he is at warre with himselfe a scourge to himselfe

a terrour to himselfe
and whatsoever he is or hath all conspire to work his torture vnderstanding memory senses members whatsoever is within him with out him what he thinks of remembers sees hears all turnes to his torment and therefore no marvell if it be so intolerable

to draw now to conclusion of these generals thus applying making vse of this attribute of intolerablenes given to this evill
we haue a company of gallants in the world men for the present as paule speakes

past feeling and given over to worke wickednes even with greedinesse that laugh at the sheepishnes of gods children who of scruple abstaine from idle yea from profane speech yea from lewdest and most vngracious actions oathes periury whoredome so do my bloud any thing alike to them heaven and hell god and devill peace and trouble of conscience all are with them but fables
they talke of hell say they and torments thereof as preachers will haue them intolerable the

worme never dies and the fire never goes out
now if this be al their hel the gnawing of a worme who would be so foolish as for it to barre himselfe of the pleasures of this life

now lord that thou wert pleased to gra~t such atheists but one houres sense of that worme which they so much scoffe at am perswaded its neither poverty nor prison nor sword nor fire nor any other torture but they would choose to make excha~ge for it al the world said one once for a good conscience wonder we at the

wish the wound of conscience saith salomon who can beare

let vs all therefore be admonished to take heed how we wound conscience and bring on our selues this vnsufferable evill
of all blessings of god incident to this life pray for this the peace of a good co~science

it passeth saith paule all vnderstanding of all mischiefes keepe thy selfe from this a torturing and accusing conscience saith salomon who can beare it wouldest thou knowe what makes it it is sinne any sinne be it but a scruple or dram never so little it frets like poison in the bowels
it may be indeed custome of sinning as a callum or brawny skin makes conscience senslesse for the time but that callum once removed no flesh so tender
but especially beware of sinnes against conscience that is sins against knowledge a and recoyled against by conscience these are the torturing sins indeed that racke conscience whe god is pleased to awake it when men

know they do evil and perhaps heare the voice of conscience as another lot admonishing

oh deale not so wickedly or as ioseph to his mistris

how canst thou do this great wickednes and sin against god and yet breake out to enormities these feare they turne in their issue into gall and wormewood
and herein alas how desperat are many running to practise of the grossest enormities which nature it selfe conde~ns as whoredome drunkennes and never considering conscience being thorough custome of sinning stupified how deadly they wound it and what horror they lay vp for themselues against when god shalbe pleased to enter iudgement with them
oh that they would but co~sider the lame~table ends of such sinners that this

lyon

of an evill conscience once rowsed thorough horrour driues many vnto
how many alas how many every day heare we of running with iudas to the halter to be their owne hangmen or cut throats and posting as it were out of the hell of an evill conscience to the hel of fire brimstone burning for ever before the throne of god and why should any living in the same sins secure himselfe from like iudgement but of the wound this farre

let vs see now what that balme is so soveraign that hath vertue to cure it or in plainer tearmes what course is to be holden of such as are distressed that they may finde comfort
two principall ingredients wee haue in peters prescript to his patients at ierusalem

amende your liues be baptized for remission of sinnes salues soveraigne indeed for a wounded soule we can finde none better then repentance and faith and whatsoever is a meanes to assure vs that our sinnes for christs sake are forgiven vs
this do therefore whe the lords hand shall in this kind be vpon thee search thy heart diligently for whatsoever is amisse in thee leaue neither sinnes of age no nor of youth sinnes of life nor of nature vnsifted for all these humble thy selfe vnder godes mightie hande

cease to doe evill learne to doe well the though thy sins be red as scarlet the lord shall make them white as wooll
but this be assured never to haue this wound soundly cured till thy sinnes those especially thou feelest most galling be repe~ted

this done goe on in thy prescript vsing all holy meanes to obtaine faith in the blood of christ

that blood and it only infused hath vertue to cure the bleeding wounds of conscience
the meaning is thou must

labour to see and beleeue thine owne share in christs death and satisfaction that thou maist be able to say as paul from sound experience

christ loved me and gaue himselfe for me
this perswasion once vpon sound evidence obtained whatsoever devill or conscience can suggest for discomfort is easily removed and till that assurance in some measure be gotten never looke for solid peace in thy conscience
and therefore by the way heare not them that teach you can never be assured of your salvation or pardon of sinnes in this life what

iob speakes of his friends in his affliction is true of such teachers miserable comforters are they to distressed consciences
no racke is so torturing to the body as is their doubtfull suspense to a wounded conscience

and as a meanes to obtaine it carefully

frequent the assemblies and gatherings together of the saints where god hath appointed his interpreters those ones amongst thousands to declare vnto man his righteousnesse though it may be some little ease may bee obtained by other privat helpes yet sure they forsake their owne mercy that forsake our assemblies

hetherto ioine christian prudence in fitting thy meditations to thy present estate
the law is indeed a good

looking glasse wherein we may behold the many blemishes and ouglie deformities of our life nature an excellent

hammer to breake the stone of the heart but consider the heart broken needs rather

binding then breaking the spirit wounded rather lenitiues then corasiues
in this case therefore repentance faith once in any measure obtained that comfort of the apostle is fittest to be meditated

we are not vnder the law but

vnder grace he meanes in respect of iustification
and therefore though the law condemne thee for remainds of sinne yet grace acquits and accepts thee for thy faith in christ

lastly beware of hellish courses which many take as merry company sports to driue away qualmes of conscience as some profanely tearme them the

hand writing on the wall makes belshazzar tremble in midst of his iollitie they are but as a draught of cold water in a fever mitigating the fervour for the present yet so as it after exasperateth the griefe

having thus handled the generals it remaines now that we proceed to some particulars the rather for that the weaknesse of most is such in this misery that except their owne particular and the particulars are almost infinit bee salued little or no ease is brought to the distressed
our order shall be this first consider we the severall occasions out of which this distresse ariseth
for that my purpose is to speake of it only as it is in gods children for chastisement or prevention see wee what these speciall sinnes are which by the severall distresses god would correct or prevent in his servants
lastly as the lord shal enable proceed we to remedies such as either scriptures or experience hath approved for soveraigne

let no man require exact method or curious sorting them to their heads no nor enumeration of all particulars which are almost infinite
it shall suffice to propound those only that occasioned this paines and that in the same order which the sicke soule for whose sake this paines was first vndertaken confusedly kept in

vttering her distresses

and in the forefront place we that that ariseth fro supposed vnpardonablenes of sinne
this is the general that most affrights opinion that the lord either cannot or will not pardon transgressions committed so long as but that principle of the leper is holden

lord if thou wilt thou canst make me cleane anguish of heart is never so great

the sinne the lord would by this distresse chasten or prevent in his children seemes probably this
a former conceit they haue had in the daies of their vanitie that of all things pardon of sinnes is easiest obtained at the hands of god a stroke on the breast cry god mercy thou hast thought perhaps sufficient to purchase a pardon
the lord would now teach thee it cost more to redeeme a soule and that pardon purchased with the price of his own sonnes blood is not so prodigally bestowed

now this first distresse is vsually strengthned by three other particulars

greatnesse of transgressions

long continuance in a course of sinning

our own indisposition to partake forgiuenesse
for greatnesse of sinne we haue

cains instance
and though the issue be better in gods children then in the brood of cain yet the distresse it selfe is incident to gods dearest servants
and herein alas how wittie and even rhetoricall are gods children to aggravate theire infirmities still they will be finding out somewhat wherein their sinnes haue exceeded the sinnes of others to which the lord hath granted pardon
it is true they confesse

paule a

blaspheamer a persecutour was receaued to mercy but what he did be did ignorantly through vnbeleefe against my knowledge and conscience
peter sinned grievously

but wept bitterly my heart is so hardned that not one teare can be wrung out for my many sinnes
manasses shed much blood but in his tribulation

he prayed earnestly and humbled himselfe greatly before the lord god of his fathers besides a few cold wishes and a little hanging downe the head after the guise of those hypocrites isa
find no such thing in my selfe
the sinne which the lord would hereby chasten and prevent is our former extenuations and sleight esteeme of the offence of god
we were wont to say of our sins as lot of zoar

are they not little ones and our soule may liue
oathes say profane men perhaps we haue said too what are they but words and words but winde scoffing and fabling wanton speech but merry talke profane sports honest recreations grosser enormities humane frailties
the lord would now teach thee otherwise to esteeme sins to weigh them in the ballance of the sanctuary not of thine owne fancy and perhaps the sins thou formerlie thoughtest little are nowe felt as a burthen too heavy for thee to beare

the remedies are these
first humble thy selfe before the great god whose offence thou hast so lightly esteemed pray god to forgiue this thought of thy hart that ever thou hast thought any sin little and resolue hereafter to make conscience as well of smaller as of greater sins knowing that thou art

countable for the least even to an idle word

when thou hast this done consider then the endlesnes

of gods mercy in christ iesus view the

height and depth and length and breadth those immense dimensions of gods grace and loue in christ
heare the lord himselfe describing himselfe to moses

the lord the lord strong mercifull and gracious slow to anger abundant in goodnesse and truth reseruing mercy for thousands forgiuing iniquitie and sin
so many attributes of mercy and grace so few of power and iustice what argue they but almost a greater propension to shew mercy then to execute iudgement

heare the apostle

god the father of mercies againe god which is rich in mercy
heare isay

he is very readie to forgiue heare iames

of much bowels and tender commiseratio
and reiect that saying of cain

my sin is greater then can be forgiven mentiris cain saith augustin thou lyest caine for greater is gods mercy then al ma~s iniquitie

when thou hast thus dwelt a while vpon meditation of the endlesse mercy of god see then the

price paide to expiate not only little but even greatest sins
is there any thinkest thou so great which the

blood of the sonne of god a person so excellent cannot expiate

nimirum deus meus saith augustine si aequa lance delicta peccantis hominis redimentis gratiâ librentur authoris non tantum oriens ab occidente sed inferior separatur infernus summo coeli cardine
now surely my god saith augustine if the offences of man sinning and the grace of god redeeming be piezed in even ballance the east hath not so far difference fro the west nor the lowest hell from the highest heaven ad vnto these those sweete promises propounded in the

word of god

cease to doe evill learne to do well though thy sins were red as scarlet they shalbe white as wooll
and out of them frame this comfortable sound conclusion
there is no sinne capable of repentance but the same is also capable of pardon

lastly consider examples of great sinners received to mercy

manasseh peter

paul and know gods dealings are exemplary in them the lord sheweth what al might expect that by their example shoulde in after times beleeue and repent

a seconde particular strengthening this distresse is long continued practise of sin with contempt of grace offered
this is that that more exasperates the wound and makes it bleed a fresh
know saith the distressed soule gods mercies are infinite christs merit endlesse but haue long dwelt in practise of sin neglected many a gracious invitation foreslowed repentance that now am perswaded the iudgement threatned by the prophet hath seized on me

because the lord would haue purged me and was not purged therefore shall never bee purged

the sin the lord would hereby chasten and prevent is procrastination those prophane resolutions time enough yet repent when we are old and those hellish speeches young saints old devils youth must haue his swinge and let vs be merry we can neuer do it younger
the lord would by this distresse teach thee that it is

good to beare the yoake in youth that repentance the sooner it is performed the more comfortable and that grace must be accepted when the lord offers it not when we shalbe at leasure
and now dare say thou wishest

thou hadst bin sooner wise for thy soule and even in youth laid the foundation of thine endles comfort

for remedy this doe first bewaile delaies now so discomfortable in sense pray god to pardon that presumptuous neglect of his gracious invitations
and now purpose to

redeeme the time and

as much time as remaines in the flesh consecrate wholly to the service of god

this done build thy selfe vpon perswasion of this truth that promise of pardon is made without limitation to any time person or nu~ber of offences repentance being once performed
ierusalem had long weltered in the blood of the saints yet heare our saviour

oh if thou hadst known but in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace that is to say notwithsta~ding all the blood of the prophets and cruelty that hath passed from father to son along so many generations yet now had repentaunce turned away the iudgements prepared for thee
and the lord by his prophet from the daies of your fathers ye haue gone astray yet returne and will heale your rebellions
there is

a length as well as a breadth of gods pardoning mercy
it is as long as large to every one in any time seriously repenting

a third occasion of this distresse is that ariseth from our owne indisposition and disability to performe the conditions of pardon faith and repentance
this is that that especially woundeth conscience
the former principles after some pawse wilbe granted god can pardo and no time past for such as ca repent
but for me alas feele nothing but hardnes of hart and security nor ca as should in any measure of godly sorrow bewaile

my fowle sins so long continued
god cannot pardon a sinner impenitent and vnbeleeving

the sin the lord would by this distresse chasten is our former prowd opinion of free will and conceited ability in our selues to beleeue and repent at pleasure
how oft haue those speeches rashly passed from vs we will repent in old age or when the lorde summons vs by our last sicknes as if we had repentance at co~mand could at our pleasure performe it
the lord woulde now teach thee that it is not in man to convert himself or to turne from his sins
and that it is as

easie for a blackemore to change his skin or a leopard his spots as for a sinner accustomed to do evill to learne to do well without a supernaturall worke of gods spirit turning vs that wee may be turned

remedies
first humble thy selfe before god for this proud conceit thou hast carried of thy selfe in nature acknowledge with the apostle thine owne disabilitie so much as by

a thought or desire to further thine owne salvation and let god be acknowledged the

worker both of will and worke in this point of co~version

when thou hast thus humbled thy selfe vnder gods mightie hand pray then with that poore man in the gospel

lord helpe my vnbeleefe and with the church

drawe me that may run after thee
lord say thou knowe

it is not in man to convert himselfe nor to turne vnto thee

turne thou me lord and shall be turned convert thou me and shall be converted
and after thy promise

take out of my bowels that same heart of stone and giue insteed thereof an heart of flesh remorsefull for sinne

and flexible to the obedience of thy holy will

when thou hast thus craved helpe for thy naturall infirmitie consider then that these very

feelings and strivings against vnbeleefe are beginnings of faith the feeling and bewailing of hardnesse of heart is the seed of godly sorrow
and remember howe gratiously the lord hath promised not to despise the desires of the poore and how he hath taught very

sighes groanes to be acceptable prayers
and therefore proportionally very griefe for not grieving to be godly sorrow very sorrow for not beleeving to be beliefe at least in gods mercifull acceptation
and of this first maine distresse and the severall occasions thereof thus farre

a second speciall distresse is that which is occasioned by suspicion of hypocrisie herewith are gods children long and often perplexed that though they haue performed many excellent things savouring of grace faith vnfained yet this feare they haue in all these been but as hypocrits either for fashion or feare or vaine glory or hope of temporal benefit performing al whatever they haue done in religion and the service of god
the sinne the lord would by this distresse chasten is our former contentment with the shadowes of saving graces
time hath beene perhaps when wee haue thought civill honesty to be regeneration god forgiue vs sound repentance mumbling of pater nosters zealous praiers formalitie in hearing the summe of religion
the lord would now teach thee its not every faith that saueth and it must be more then civilitie that brings to heaven more then formalitie that makes a christian more then lip labour that makes a prayer

remedies
first bewaile this errour and for it humble thy selfe before god considering it is

not the blind and the lame nor formalitie that satisfies that god that stiles himselfe a great king and terrible amongst the heathen and hath threatned a curse to the deceaver that hath in his flocke a male and vowes a corrupt thing

this done continue diligently to

try and examine the graces that god hath bestowed vpon thee it is one end perhaps why the lord hath permitted thee to this iealousie of thine own estate
but yet where god giues evidence of sinceritie shut not thine eies neither derogate from the worke of gods spirit that by this suspiciousnesse of thine owne estate and striving for sinceritie would seale vp to thy soule that thou art no hypocrite but an

israelite indeed one in whome there is no guile

and perhaps in this view of thy selfe thou shalt discover graces in thy selfe such as in that manner cannot be in a hypocrite
example thou shalt never finde a hypocrite willing to extenuate his good things or to aggravate his sinnes
search and see whether in things co~mendable he be not willing to take notice of the least yea to arrogate more then is due to lessen his sinnes by al possible excuses
see the hypocrite in his colours because forsooth he was

no fornicator no extortioner had given a little scattering almes paid tithes therefore not men only but the lord himselfe must take notice of him as of a prime servant
now if thou shalt aske thine owne heart it may bee it will tell thee thou art free from these and farre lesse sinnes and yet seemest to thy selfe the

chiefe of sinners
thou hast done these

farre greater workes of piety and mercy and yet thinkest thy selfe not worthy to be numbred amongst the

meanest of gods saints
was ever hypocrite thus opinioned of himselfe dare say not one

againe was there ever hypocrite that could loue a child of god eo nomine because he was a child of god ishmaell that hypocrite lived in abrahams familie was circumcised and no doubt performed outward conformitie in religious exercises vsed by his father but could

he loue isaac the sonne of promise yet this doubt not but thou canst say of thy selfe

thou honourest them that feare the lord

delightest their company cheerefully according to abilitie

distributest to their necessities
and whilest thou so

louest the brethren canst thou make question whether thou be translated from death to life

againe ever readest thou of an hypocrite that could

loue a rebuker a man reproving his personall sinnes we read of herod

he reverenced iohn baptist never that he loved him yea for his plaine rebuke of incest he often desired the murther of him of the

iewes that with some patience and attention they heard st stephens narration but his reproofe was as gall and wormewood
now when thou findest davids affectio in thee that thou canst

desire to be reproved and countest it a benefit canst thou doubt whether the lord hath made thee

wise to salvation

lastly canst thou name the hypocrite that ever could say his conscience bearing him witnesse that hee was grieved for imperfections of obedience mourned for this that he could in no greater measure flie from

the corruptio that is in the world through lust or that

counted this his misery to bee led sometimes to the law of sinne name that hypocrite if thou canst
and if thou findest these things in thy selfe wilt thou be so iniurious to thy owne soule so vnthankfull to gods spirit dwelling in thee as to say he hath wrought no more in thee then he hath in an hypocrite god forbid

but proceede we to other particulars strengthning in many this iealously of their sincerity
they are decay of graces formerly felt in more liuelyhood greater efficacie this is an vsuall but a fearefull distresse causing many to thinke of all that ever they haue formerly felt it was nothing but the hypocrits vanishing flashes
it is true saith the wounded spirit haue felt that true of my selfe that iob so comfortably professeth

haue preferred the words of the lords mouth before mine appointed food haue knowne the day when could with earnestnes of affection and feeling of wants haue powred out my soule before my god could once haue wept for my sins but now alas and with weeping they vtter it none of all these can feele in my selfe

the sinnes the lord woulde hereby chasten or prevent are
pride and that swelling of the hart with co~ceitednes of our owne eminency aboue others
vntha~kfulnes for our litle or more grace received


discontinuance of care to cherish and increase receaved graces by meanes sanctified perhaps wee haue growne remisse in hearing praier meditation conference vse of sacraments running into occasions of decaying as loose profane irreligious company from society of such as feare god by

whose mutuall faith we might haue solaced each another

remedies
bewaile these sins all or any of the that thou ca~st probably think to haue bin occasio~s of thy declinings

this done co~sider there may be in gods dearest children decay of graces in part for a time
of the church of ephesus it is said shee had

fallen from her first loue yet stil retained esteeme of a church even with the lord christ
of the philippians saith the apostle

your care beginnes to spring againe belike they had had their winter that a new spring revived
it is true the lord hath promised that

hell gates shall never prevaile vtterly to overthrow our faith or any other grace accompanying salvation but he hath no where promised to preserue co~tinually sensible exercise of any grace
faith he preserveth but continuall exercise of faith hath he promised to preserue yea we haue instances of his saints that haue fallen to acts of infidelity in

abraha himself whose faith is so renowned in

simo for firmnes of faith sirnamed

cephas
the lord will haue his graces eb flow in his servants saith augustine ne facilitatem in omnibus nostrum putemus esse quod eius est least if we had attained facility in all things we should thinke that our own which is meerly his work
who of vs all doth alwaies heare with equal attentio reverence cheerefulnes or pray with like earnestnes of desire feeling of wants assura~ce to be heard or do any thing at al times so as at some

lastly let it be considered that the lord vsually withdrawes the vse of some particular grace that some other may in greater measure shew forth it selfe in vs ex

ioy and reioicing in his mercy he withdrawes that he may bring to practise of humiliation

a second thing strengthening iealousie of sinceritie is the smal measure of our graces received
the distresse hence arising may well call the good distresse the co~fortable discomfort sith this brings with it its own co~fort yea is itselfe the matter of most solide consolatio
griefe for little obedience is it not comfortable

indignation at our imperfections is it not a fruit of repentance see it exemplified mar

the sin the lord would hereby chasten or prevent is former contentment with our smal measures that sufficit wee sang to our selues in times of prosperity
perhaps we haue bin thus minded any measure of faith would serue turne for comfort in times of greatest te~ptation any measure of practise so we were free from grosse enormities would suffice to salvation
and it may be we haue scoffingly thrown of care of strict carriage with that of salomon profanely mistaken

wee may be iust overmuch

for remedy hu~ble thy selfe for these very thoughts and pray god to pardon neglects of meanes to growe in grace in the knowledge of our lord and saviour iesus christ

this done consider that grace is rather measured by quality then by quantity obedience more by sincerity then by muchnes
its not so much inquired how great or little but how sincere obedience is faith if it be

vnfained though but as a

graine of mustard seed obedience though mingled with many weaknesses yet if it be

harty hath promise of gracious acceptation
and if thou lackest evidence of sincerity take this for one infallible griefe for thy defects imperfections
let that

also be weighed that smal graces may yet be tru whiles they are smal litle faith is faith as a little fire is fire hath the nature of fire as well as the greatest flame
god despiseth not little things in obedience offered vnto him
in the sacrifices of the old law not the price of the gift but the ability affection of the offerer was respected

in this evill thou art not alone but hast

all gods saints partakers with thee

the smallest beginnings are

pledges of greater favours where is thankfull acceptance and

conscionable vse of those already receaved to the glory of the bestower

lastly let it not be forgotten that paule to this purpose alleadgeth what we want in our selues

we haue in christ iesus if not performed yet punished and to vs pardoned

the third strengthener of iealousie is present insensiblenes of gods graces working in vs an vsual accide~t but a great discomfort
the sin chastened is either vnthankfulnes for that experience we once had of gods spirit working in vs or that presumptuous licence wee tooke to our selues in sinning whiles our evidence staid firme with vs for remedie pray god to pardon vnthankfulnesse and presumption

this done consider graces may sometimes lie hidden in vs yea worke in respect of our acknowledgeme~t insensibly
the

kingdome of god said our savior comes not with observation and it is as

seed that comes vp and groweth we know not how

it was davids case

create in me saith david a

cleane heart god
his heart no doubt was even then cleansed for doubt we of cleannes where gods spirit takes vp his dwelling or make we questio whether hee

sanctifie where he teacheth to pray yet create saith david speaking ad sensum according to that nothing he felt of cleansing

lastly remember how diversly the lord giues evidence of his spirits presence in vs somtimes a child of god perceiues little difference in practise betwixt himselfe and very aliens yet let him view his affections hee may see grace there sometimes againe more may bee seene in practise then in the affection how ever whilst in either thou hast cause of comfort
the last particular in this kind discomforting is falling from purposes and almost vowed resolutions of a steddy course in obedience

the sinne the lord would hereby chasten or prevent is

presumptuousnesse in vowing or resolving with out serious imploring of gods assistance to enable or due acknowledgement of our owne impotency in performance

god wil ever be knowne

sole worker of will work of purpose and execution
the sin was

peters and the chastisement he tasted

for remedy humble thy selfe for rashnesse in vowing and pray god to keepe thine eies open alwaies to behold thy naturall weaknesse and mutabilitie

next learne ta distinguish betwixt the generall particular purpose meane betwixt purposing to cleaue vnto god in performance of all holy duties purposing in such measure to serue him
perhaps in the

measure and particulars purposed there haue beene faulting but still in all likelyhood the generall purpose remaines

put difference betwixt falling from purpose falling from execution of purpose in particulars there is great ods betwixt the two

david fell from execution of that

sworne purpose to keepe gods iudgements yet not from purpose

the kinds degrees of falling would be pondred
there is an

vniversall falling from the general purpose that indeed is discomfortable and there is a fayling in particular performances whence without wrong to thy selfe and condemning the whole generation of the iust thou canst not conclude thy

it would be considered whether the

contrary profane purpose haue succeeded in thee
a man can never say he is wholly fallen from any grace till hee see the contrary succeeding in roome thereof

lastly in this kind fell

peter and yet obtained mercy
and as is aforesaid gods dealings are

exemplary
in one he shewes what all in like case may on like conditions expect

let vs goe on to other particulars and amongst these as most discomfortable offers it selfe that which ariseth from abundance and fowlenes of evil thoughts of blaspemy atheisme lust murther selfe destroying
these very thoughts and suggestions are such as we thinke cannot stand with grace

the sinne the lord would hereby chasten or prevent is our little acquaintance and notice taking of that greatnesse of corruption that is naturall vnto vs

originall corruption is little knowne of most how far it spreads and what it compriseth till effects thereof be seene in vs
and for sinnes so monstrous wee are generally of hazaels mind

is thy servant a dog that should doe yea or once thinke of sinnes so monstrous

perhaps also it is our lacke of compassion towardes others overtaken sometimes in some action of these sinnes
we haue a precept with

meekenesse to restore such as are fallen vpon this consideration that wee our selues may be tempted yea overtaken in acts of the fowlest particulars
it is our fault to turne compassionate restoring into bitter invectiues heavy aggravations of our brethre~s fals which perhaps occasions the lord to permit vs to such like extremities
it may bee its our vnthankfulnesse for our preservation through grace from the sinnes we see daily committed by others
the fals of our brethren should be as so many sermons of thankfulnesse to god by whose grace we stand and incitements to humiliation and watchfulnesse against our owne corrupt inclination would to god it were not too true of vs that wee ascribe our freedome from sinnes so foule even to goodnesse of nature
the lord would now teach vs that our hearts are equally sinkes of vncleanesse

the remedies are first humiliation and prayer for pardon of these sinnes all or any of them we can discover in our selues

for comfort consider first whether they

come out of thine owne corrupt heart or are

cast into thee by satan
if they come from satan immediatly they are our crosses not our sinnes till we haue embraced them

some measure of allowance or consent

it is a comfortable truth taught by the apostle

that no more of our sinnes is imputed then wee approue
what thou disallowest and abhorrest in thy selfe and strivest against god never imputes to condemnation

lastly weigh what the lord aimes at in permitting his children to be thus assaulted and thou shalt finde it to be thy benefit rather then discomfort
one end is to acquaint vs with the measure of our faulty misery that

as sinne abounds in our acknowledgement so grace may abound in the lords pardon
its our errour to thinke our selues naturally inclined to no more sinnes then wee feele actually and ordinarily stirring in our selues

he would by this occasion stirre vs vp to

watch and pray against every sin even such as through secret perswasio of our immunitie from them often get greatest advantage against vs
we vsually arme our selues against no more then what we feele our selues actually and often tempted vnto
he would teach vs to magnifie his grace that hath freed vs from the raigne and dominion of these sinnes the seeds whereof we see budding in vs

the last distresse which purpose to co~clude withal being last of those that were propounded by the distressed is the long delay of restitution after vse of the meanes
we thinke the lord should presently grant what we pray for and not so long withhold comfort conscionably sought in the meanes sanctified

the sinne the lord would hereby chasten or preve~t is our neglect to accept grace offered vnto vs perhaps its true of vs that is spoken of the church in the canticles when the

lord hath beene wet with the dew of the

night we hate not opened vnto him but foreslowed the time
is it not iust with him as david speakes to make as though he heard not and to differ deliverance

for remedie first bewaile and pray for pardon of thine vnthankfull neglects

consider then this is no new thing
the apostle in like extremitie

besought the lord thrise that is often before he receaved answer

though god delay to chaste neglects to kindle affection
that graces so hardly obtained may be valued according to their worth yet

will hee not alwaies despise his children that cry day and night vnto him

god heares diversly by giving either the blessing desired or another equivalent as if not deliverance yet

grace sufficient to support vs

lastly comforts when they come are vsually

proportioned to the measure of tribulation
much trouble receaues in the end plentifull consolation

a particular strengthning this distresse is feare of falling to some fearefull extremities
a thing wherewith iob was so much perplexed that hee prayed for death to prevent it
will subioine his words

oh that might haue my desire and that god would grant mee the thing long for that is that god would destroy me that he would let his hand goe and cut me off
then should yet haue comfort though burne with sorrow because haue not denied the words of the holy one
seest thou not thine owne case exemplified

the sinne the lord would prevent or chasten hereby is our former fearelesnesse of such extremities arising from proud conceit of abilitie to preserue our

selues and that rash censuring and befooling others whom the lord hath been pleased thus to humble
we haue heard perhaps of blasphemies which extremitie of anguish hath droven gods children vnto wee haue read of others fearefull dispaires wherein they haue perished and began to censure them of folly or impietie for sinnes so extreame nowe the lord woulde teach vs that how ever we applaud our selues in respect of our better stay of our selues yet the downfal is headlong when the lord is pleased to leaue vs to our selues

for remedy pray god to pardon these sinnes

this done labour to fortefie faith in the gratious promises god hath made thee of sustentation and preservation
as faith increaseth so feare abateth as it ebs so feare flowes
and to this end consider

that christ hath prayed for preservation from all separating extreames
and god that cannot lie hath promised

to preserue at least not vtterly to cast off but though they fall

yet to put vnder his hand

to feare sinne as sinne is it not a note of adoption and regeneration

thou hast

a promise of preservation from the sin vnpardonable if others prevaile against thee they may wound thee perhaps but not vnto death
and of these wounds of conscience thus farre
other particulars many might haue beene instanced but these suffice for the occasion
if any desire more he hath at hand the labors of these reverend mr greenham mr perkins mr downham men excellently experie~ced conscionably travelled in this healing part of divinity

only as an appendix some generall grounds necessary

to be knowne against the evil day shall bee annexed

the testimony of the spirit of god

witnessing that we are the sonnes and daughters of god is no vocall testimonie such as that of the

angell to cornelius but first those generall testimonies evangelicall

hee that receaues christ
that beleeues in his name hath this prerogatiue to be the child of god

and hee that beleeues shall bee saved are part of this testimonie

that ability gods spirit giues vs to beleeue in christ is the testimony fro whence we conclude that we are reconciled vnto god

he that beleeues in the sonne of god hath this witnesse in himselfe his very beleeuing is that witnesse

graces of god out of vs as election adoption iustification are best

discerned by graces within vs as faith loue patience obedience

in temptation it is

not safe to iudge of our adoption and iustification by peace of conscience and ioye in the holy ghost but rather by our holy affections inclinations to obedience as feare of god and care to depart from evill

in anguish of soule it's safest to looke ad minima to the least seedes and graines as may tearme them of grace
as

desire to feare god

lusting against corruption griefe for our imperfections dislike

and disallowance of our selues and our actions

the gory of faith stands in this

to beleeue aboue sense yea against feeling

holinesse makes vs not accepted of god but

shew ethonly that we are approved of him

our services are not approved for the goodnes of

our performa~ce but they are

acceptable to god through iesus christ

in the agonie of conscience none more vnfit to iudge of vs then our selues though at other times wee are sicke of selfe loue and too partiall in our own case yet in this state we are most vncharitable to our selues

when thou art brought lowest by affliction

hu~ble thy selfe lower vnder gods mightie hand acknowledging his iustice in thy affliction and thine owne vnworthinesse to receaue the least comfort
there is secret pride in our hearts even when we are brought lowest by afflictions

the more vile thou art in thine owne eies the more pretious art thou in the sight of god

hee dwels with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit to reviue the spirit of the humble and to giue life to them that are of a contrite heart

let no seeming vnfitnesse keepe thee from exercises religious publique or private
the weakest performances are farre more acceptable then whole of omissions



remission of sinnes and peace of conscience are favours worth waiting for
if the lord should keepe thee on the racke even till the last gaspe and en impart the least drop of his sonnes blood to purge thy co~science vnspeakeable were his mercy towards thy soul

conflicts with corruption are infallible signes of grace

victorie over satan seemes doubtfull thorough infirmitie is

certaine by the promise of god



gods power is perfitted in his childrens weaknesse

span missing

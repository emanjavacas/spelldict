strange and vvonderfull prophesies by the lady eleanor audeley who is yet alive and lodgeth in

to

sion most belov'd sing

of babilon a song

concerns you more full well wot then ye do thinke upon

belshazzer lo behold the king

feasting his thousand lords phebus and mars prais'd on each string every day records

the temple vessels of gods house boldly in drunk about

his

own tis like were made away

bids holy things bring out

praising of gold and brasse the gods

of iron wood and stone

see hear nor know but now alas

praised in court alone

a

hand appears lo in his sight

as he did drinke the wine upon the wall against the light it wrote about a line in presence of his numerous peers not set an hour full in loyns nor knees had he no might chang'd as a gastly skull

who might it read alas the thing

belshazzer

loud did shout

calls for magicians all with speed
came in as wise went out
caldeans and southsayers sage the meaning whoso can of mene mene third realmes peer in scarlet robe the man

his

majesty forgets to sup

nobles astonish'd all musitians may their pipes put up stood gazing on the wall

the

pleasant wine at length as sharpe

too late till thought upon

division

of another strain

unfolds the fingers long

when

to the banqueting house so wide

where host of lords did ring so wisely came the gratefull queen said ever live king

needs

trouble king thy thoughts no more forthwith shall it be read daniel there is who heretofore like doubts did open spread

could al interpretating shew which profound man scon brought on whom confer the king needs would

his

orders high unsought

needlesse preferments yours reserve sir keep your gifts in store high offices let others gaine there's given too much afore

yet unto thee shall here make known resolve this oracle true

sure as in

thy banquetting house

where all that come may view the vessells of my god are brought the palm salutes thee know herewith for these profan'd by thee threatneth the fatall blow

king even thou the most high god

unto thy

grandsire bold

caldean land a nation fell gave them to have and hold
the royal scepter and the crown advanc'd whom he would have and whom he would he pulled down could put to death and save

till walking at the twelve moneths end subject full tides do fall

excellent

majesty how gon

court exchang'd for the stall

thy

grandsire on as came to passe

at all yet minded not as if a feigned story but his miserable lot

expell'd was for the words escap'd memory can speak well hardened in pride unheard of such the wilde asse with did dwel sent to the ox its owner knows

undreamt of this his doom

fowls their appointed time observe wots not the night from noon

whose

heart made equal with the beast

driven out with those that bray the diadem as well fits thee ass go as much to say

until return'd came to himself

knew him that rules on high over the sons of men appoints what office they supply

during which space this assyrian

what watch kept night and day thus metamorphys'd over him lest make himselfe away

fields woods as wel ring out as men

for wo and ecchoes call mercy this savage king upon in holy temples all

bewailed dejected soul thus faln fed now grazing full low whilst they bedew the ground with tears

discerns not friend from foe

earth that of late made seem to dawn with songs of triumph high fleeth each wight abas'd as much among the herd doth lye

by

for device who gave

as graven on his shield an eagle mounted on the crest a hart in silver field
extold again his god as high blessed him all his days

others reputes them as nothing

alone proclaimes his praise

whose seven

times it served forth

in vain for rest to crave whom devills legions do possesse a monarch turn'd a slave
deposed thus thou knewest wel

belshazzer

his son

and renew'd so

deliverance is

voyced by every one

a day a

trumpet made to sound

for generations all and with a feast solemnized that no time might recal the memory of such an act yet as it had not been thy favorites who are more this day or matched to thy kin

then they

adoring
wood and stone

statues forsake divine meditate carved statutes on in faction do combine with enemies of god most high to thrust him from his thron and thus hast lifted up thy self
so facile and so prone

against the lord of heaven thy king not humbling of thy heart but stiffened hast with pride thy neck unto thy future smart
behold polluting holy things with sabbath so divine idolartry and revells in that day and night made thine

but he in whose hand rests thy life even breath thy ways and al thou hast not glorified him sent this wrote on the wal
god numbered thy kingdome hath ended the hand points here in ballance he hath weighed thee too the set hour drawing neer

how light soever by thee set thou as thy weightlesse gold his image wanting found much more lighter then can be told

parted divided thine estate

given to the medes is at hand the hand bids it adieu

finish'd thy majesties

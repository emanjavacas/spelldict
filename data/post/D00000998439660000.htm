to the right worshipfull sir william movnson knight
your emploiments right worshipfull in sundry hir maiesties forraine seruices both by sea and land and also for your farther experience and satisfaction in diuers other noble enterprises beeing accompanied with a sharpe and iudicious obseruation of things memorable and the perusing of many excellent and rare writers must of necessitie haue made you not onely expert in matters of war and estate but also most singularlie well read in god his great booke of nature meane the admirable frame of this vniuers or whole world
wherein the infinite varieties and sorts of creatures like so many visible wordes doe proclaime and publish vnto man the eternitie infinitie omnipotency wisedome iustice bountie and other essentiall attributes of his dread and soueraigne creatour
wherefore doe here present vnto your wor the discourse ensuing not as a teacher to instruct you in things vnknowne but as a faithfull remembrancer to recall matters to your minde which are there already both by speculation and experience most soundly imprinted

it may please you then to accept of this mine homelie translation not so much for mine owne sake who am able to deserue lesse then nothing as for the authors worthines being a gentleman as appeareth out of this other parts his learned academie most rarely qualified and likewise for the excellencie of this present worke of his both in regard

of the method the matter and the scope
for the methode is most exact and agreeable to rules of art proceeding from generalles to particulars and from the whole to the parts
the matter or subiect is most noble so that if according to aristotle all arts and sciences doe receiue their perfection from the dignity of the obiect then certes of all others theologie excepted this science is the most excellent hauing so spacious so beautifull and so fruitfull a fielde to manure as the whole world and all things therein contained
neither is the scope any whit lesse charitable and christian tending partly to the information of mens vnderstandings and the reformation of their errors but most especially ayming at the glorie of the creator vnto whom onely is due all submission and honor
finally considering the authors manner of handling this discourse and the varietie of both ancient and of our times which hee alledgeth for confirmation of sundry truthes and for other purposes purging by the fire of his exquisite iudgment the drosse of their opinions from the pure mettall and in all places adorning their gold and siluer with the most orient and inualuable pearles of holy scripture deemed it in all respects most worthy to shroude it selfe vnder your wor patronage

it is time companions that we quit our selues of the promise which wee made one to another in the entrance of our discourses concerning man to recreate our mindes sometimes if god thereto gaue grace in the faire and spatious fields of the

vniuers by a diligent search and attentiue consideration of all nature to the ende thereby the better to acknowledge the soueraigne author thereof and to induce vs the more to honor him who is the foundation whereupon we began at first to build still desire to raise vp our academie
for seeing the knowledge of god tending to his seruice is the principall outte of our being and of all our actions and that his infinite essence cannot make it selfe to be comprehended woorthily and according to his greatnes by the feeblenes of mans vnderstanding it behooueth vs carefully to meditate vpon his workes for so much as in them the great architect

of the world hath imprinted certaine marks of his glorie sufficient to giue vs so much knowledge of his high maiestie and of that wherein he requireth vs to honour him as our condition can beare and according as is altogither necessarie for the health and repose of our soules
now we consider of the worke of god principally in two things yea and to them we may easily refer all the discourse concerning this matter to wit in the creation conducting and gouernment of his creatures and in the mysterie of redemption which it hath pleased him to vouchsafe on mankinde
as then in the processe of our academie where wee haue amply entreated of the little world which is man we haue begun to instruct our selues concerning the chiefest of his workes so now desire that wee may prosecute this goodly matter of the creation and being of the great world if you companions will answere me with the same affection and if we may obtaine so much fauour of our god that being well instructed in his schoole of wisedome and guided by his holy spirit we may dare to speake and what may we not dare in seeking his glorie of the incomprehensible secret of his worke for the health of man we will assay to accomplish our worke and rest our selues on this point

amana

for as much as the world is a shadow of the brightnes of god and like a great booke of nature and naturall theologie and that all creatures contayned in the vniuers are like so many preachers and generall witnesses of the glorie of the creatour as all the learned teach we must diligently settle our vnderstanding to the contemplation of this shadow of the diuine brightnes and our eies to the reading of this booke of nature and our eares to heare these naturall preachers which teach vs to acknowledge god his prouidence aboue all things else to the end to glorifie him as his bounty doth bind vs
we know also the great reasons which inuite vs to this natural search of all things namely the impietie of our age as we haue declared in the forespeech of the second tome of our works shewing that the world is of it selfe sufficient to vanquish all atheisme there being nothing in the vniuers either so great or small but from step to step doth direct man to acknowledgment of a diuinitie
which will appeere more manifest vnto vs if we entreat of the so great varietie of creatures
boldly then companions let vs prosecute our

purpose
if the enterprise be difficult and too high for vs to attaine to the summe thereof yet to approch to things excellent is alwaies very laudable

aram
many blame discourses which are made of heauen for that they be feeble and very slender beeing compared to the beautie and importance of the thing it selfe
and indeede must confesse that all that can bee spoken of the world accordeth therewith as it is in it selfe no more then the portraiture of the romane common wealth vpon the shield of aeneas could meetly represent the greatnes and maiestie of the acts and power of this empire
but howsoeuer it be wee haue in the doctrine of the spheres most excellent principles and grounds which prepare men to the knowledge of nature and the author thereof yea which aduance them if they can apply this studie to his proper ende in the vnderstanding of the secrets wisdome and prouidence of god so far as the mind of man can pierce thereinto
let vs then companions direct our sight straight towards the place which wee must apprehend to be blessed to wit towards heauen and let vs especially regard god in his workes as the onely limit whereto we shall and must once attaine

achitob

the orderly motions of the heauens the goodly workemanship of so many starry pauilions disposed one aboue the other without any in their course the accord agreement power vertue and beautie of the elements the situation stabilitie and largenes of the earth in midst of the waters which continually threaten it and yet drowne it not and so many diuers natures and creatures which are which liue which haue sense and vnderstanding in this whole great vniuers and serue each one in his place all these things say are like so many interpreters to teach vs god as their onely efficient cause and to manifest him vnto vs in them and by them as their finall cause
therefore pursuing our first intent sufficiently declared in the beginning of our academick discourse and according to the processe of the talke by vs obserued in our description of the naturall history of the microcosme or little world let vs here make companions as it were another history of the macrocosme or great world first entreating of the creation of the world then of the diuision of the same afterwards of the orders of the spheres of their substance natures and motions of the influences and

effects of their planets consequently of the elements and lastly of euery essence and creature therein contained not by a particular description of their kindes which would amount to a work almost infinite but onely of the principall of each sort and so much as wee shall hold sufficient to induce euery one of vs and of those which will deigne to heare vs to consider and highly to praise the wisedome of the father and moderator of all these things in the creation conduction gouernance and end of them and by the vnion of their parts with the whole and among themselues we haue enough to refer the euent of our purpose to their beginning and principall scope which is to know god and his prouidence to the end to glorifie him

if all men guided by reason as plato very wel said haue a custome to inuocate on god in the beginning of their worke

whether it be great or little how much more conuenient is it that desiring to dispute of the vniuers if wee retaine any iudgement at all we should call god to our aide it is very difficult to speake as is requisite of the celestiall bodies and of so many diuers motions as they haue and yet not one hinder another but it is a much more high and intricate matter to finde out the workman and father of all this great world
and when we shall haue found him it is altogether impossible vulgarly to expresse the cause reason of his works
for though as it is the glorie and infinite wisedome of god shineth in this admirable construction of heauen and earth yet our capacitie is too too smal to comprise so great profound effects so much it wanteth that the toong may bee able to make a full and entire declaration thereof and we cannot hold disputation or argument vpon that which doth not offer it selfe vnto our sense and proper reason as is the creation of the world
for therein

haue we that woonderfull architect whom hermes called the great infinite sphere intellectual whose center is all that which is throughout the world created who performing his worke and giuing motion to all the celestiall bodies doth himselfe continue stable
now that which mouing is not it selfe moued surpasseth al discourses speculations humane and philosophicall and appertaineth to a diuine knowledge the which we ought to impetrate through praiers by reuelation of the holy spirit euen in such sort as all things naturall are inuented and comprehended by reason demonstration and all morall are obtained by arte and vse

then of the soueraigne and true god with his eternal word and holy spirit which three are one essence one god in trinitie of persons

whose name is will be that will be or am that am almightie eternall creator and gouernor of euery soule and bodie in contemplation of whom consisteth the onely good the true felicitie and blessednes of man whom he himselfe hath created to attaine thereunto a liuing creature reasonable by the gift of vnderstanding and who being iust permitteth not his creature made according to his owne image to remaine vnpunished hauing sinned and being merciful hath not left him without grace who hath giuen both to the good and euill an essence with the stones a life vegetatiue and full of seede with the plants a life sensuall with the beasts and a life intellectuall with the angels from whom proceedeth all gouernance all goodlines and all order by whom all that is naturall euen from the highest of heauen to the center of the earth doth subsist of whom are the seedes of formes the formes of seedes the mouings of seedes and of formes who being good hath not left regardlesse not onely the sphericall and elementarie world or else the angels and man but euen the entrailes of the most small and contemptible amongst creatures neither the lightest feather of the birds nor the least flower of the herbe nor leafe of the tree engrauing in each of all these things the workes of his omnipotencie certaine signes of his glorie and maiestie by the couenant and accord of euery of their parts and as it were by wot not what manner of peace of him say father and moderator of all that which is which liueth which hath sense and vnderstandeth let vs request companions that with the light of his wisedome he will illuminate our vnderstandings and by his holy spirit direct and gouerne our words meetely to discourse of according

as mans power is able the works of his hand in heauen and in earth according as our intent is

the beginning of euerie thing whatsoeuer is of such waight and importance that on the knowledge of the same dependeth all the science thereof for it is impossible that a man can be skilfull in any thing if he be ignorant in the principles and first causes of the subiect which he desireth to know contrariwise hauing well knowne them the vnderstanding of the effects which thereupon ensue of the vertues and qualities which thereby redound of the actions which therof proceed of the degrees which therein are established of the bounds and limits whereto these first causes tend to obtaine their perfection declareth it selfe as of it owne accord without great difficultie and much paine
this was the cause why many sages in old time despising the care of temporall affaires addicted themselues altogether to search out the cause of all nature so that the most excellent of them would boldly discourse of the originall and making of the world
but the saying of plato remaining euer true that it is as hard to finde out the maker and father of this all as to speake properly of him being found out it so falleth out that the most part of them who haue entreated of so loftie a matter haue erred straying by diuers yea euen all those whom the son of iustice hath not fully illuminated with his supreme brightnes
thereupon it proceeded that the philosophers haue beene diuided into diuers and contrarie opinions about this question whether the world hath beene from euerlasting or whether it hath beene of late whether of necessitie or else by the free will and motion of god
aristotle with all the troupe of those

who beleeue nothing but that which they can inuent and comprise by naturall reasons and syllogismes taken from sensible things which guide them to a certaine demonstration not being able thereby to vnderstand how and wherefore heauen earth haue beene created affirme that they were neuer made but that they haue beene from eternitie
but plato followed of a great number of the most wisemen hath confessed the generation of the world which he teacheth to be ordered and disposed by compleat and perfect numbers vnder the vaile of which the obscure notes of hidden sense it seemeth that he would hide the close mysteries of the creation of the vniuers to those which were not yet instructed in such secrets which onely may be comprehended by a

pure and celestiall cogitation diuinely infused
for let vs know that there is no certaintie at all of this doctrine except for those to whom the minde by a special and supernaturall grace is sharp being fashioned and formed by meditation of the immutable substance of god himselfe and by a secret operation of the holy ghost to beleeue that it is the eternall who by his word hath made all nature
for so the soueraigne creator talketh with man and establisheth a certaine testimonie of his truth in the heart of him when he hath made him proper and meet to heare him with the best and most excellent part of his vnderstanding in regard whereof he is said to be made according to his owne image

but although these things may be knowne being nor far remote from our interiour

or exteriour senses yea so that they may be called present and whereof no doubt is to bee made especially being supported by authoritie of good witnesses yet those things which surpasse the ordinarie puissance of the minde because by our owne iudgement we cannot credit them must be considered and beleeued according to that couenant of verities which they announce vnto vs who haue known the by our vnderstanding peaceful and duely purged so that we may adde faith to such holy personages as god hath made capable of his light and which instruct vs not in the things which they haue imagined but in such as they haue heard receiued from diuine oracles
it is then of their authoritie that he must make a buckler whosoeuer will meetly debate of god and of his workes and of his prouidence in the gouernance of them
and when the wings of nature faile vs in so loftie a contemplation we must take to vs those of diuine grace and when the naturall light fadeth and is readie to die to require an infused and supernaturall illumination
the world is greatest of all things visible and god of all things inuisible
that the world is we perceiue but that god is we beleeue
now that he hath made the world we can better beleeue of no bodie then of god himselfe
but where haue we heard that in his word whereto we must giue credit concerning those things whereof it is expedient that we should not be ignorant and which we of our selues are not able to vnderstand
now he hath spoken first by his prophets then by himselfe in the person of our redeemer and lastly by the apostles and disciples
we heare him speaking aloude where moses the father of diuines

and master of philosophers saith in the beginning god

created the heauen and the earth
the prophet was not there present but the wisedome of god by which al things were made and which by an incomprehensible vertue conueieth it selfe into holy minds and doth direct them and declare all his works without any noyse at all by his spirit which can doe all beholdeth all encourageth all and passeth through all purified spirits of vnderstanding and abideth in his elect
and the blessed angels who alwaies behold the face of their father speake to them also and announce the secrets of the eternal maiestie to all them say in such sort as it pleaseth the omnipotent to make them worthie
one of these was moses who teacheth vs that god almightie made this great vniuers
a witnesse so excellent and worthy that by him we must belieue in god whom we perceiue as it were through the same wisedome and spirit which reuealed vnto him the creation of the world who prophecied almost two thousand yeeres before of the of christian faith confirming also his whole doctrine by miracles prodigies oracles and prophecies wherewith all his writings abound
and therefore hauing confidence in his testimonie we call god creator of all things thereby inferring that he is author principall and first cause of all essences which cause by manner of speech ought to be full of all things if this maxime of the peripatetickes be true
that none can giue away of that which he hath not
and therefore the poet the honor of our age very learnedly saith

ere time forme substance place to be themselues attained

all god in all things was and god in all remained

for there is nothing produced by nature or formed by arte but first it hath abiding in that which performeth it
so euerie creature is engendred by vertue of that seede wherein it was at first by power included so each worke liueth in the minde of the workeman before he puts it in practise
so had the worlde perfect being in the thought of god before it was builded and the very idea thereof was contained in it by which this great architect when it pleased him performed his outward worke as saint augustine verie learnedly discourseth in a long treatise vpon this text of scripture all things were made by the word

and in it was life
and thereby we learne that god almightie the vnit from which all number proceedeth and whereto all multitude referreth it selfe did increase himselfe in himselfe before he communicated his vnitie with creatures engendring one eternitie

and by an alone vnique action neuer disturbed his linage full of vnderstanding the very image of the father his worde the perfect patterne of the worlde and his loue and power the holie ghost which allieth the vnderstanding with the thought three persons in one essence and substance
afterward this godhead though in it selfe it was soueraigne good not hauing neede of any strange thing yet woulde he according to his owne bountie in him consisting produce the outward worke of the worlde whereinto spreading himselfe by a kinde of processe of well ordered degrees and disposing through admirable workmanship the harmonicall formes of the heauens the angels and men by him created to be made partakers of felicitie contemplating these maruailes were rauished and carried away with meditation of spirituall things and by the beautie of his workes and ornament of his creatures haue learned to acknowledge the father of this vniuers
who moreouer performed not so great a worke in such manner as mortall men accustome to labour who cannot do any businesse themselues if they haue not stuffe and tooles fit for it nay and then cannot do it according to their desire
but god created all of nothing without helpe without counsell

by himselfe by his worde by the power of his holie spirit in such time and manner as he hath pleased of his owne franke and free will
therefore it is written he spake and it was done

he commanded and the worlde was created
also the lorde hath done whatsoeuer he pleased in heauen and in earth and in all the depths
and againe oh eternall lord behold thou hast made heauen and earth by thy great power and by thy stretched out arme nothing is impossible to thee
briefly holy writings are filled with texts to this purpose which giue vs certaine testimonie that the works of god are not subiect to any other cause then to his only omnipotent will and that thereby the worde being spoken those things which were not haue beene created as well the substance as the fashion of them and also the worde creation doth properly import so much according to the stile of
beholde then summarily that which we learne of the originall of the worlde we will consequently consider as neere as may be of this notable and excellent doctrine and of certaine arguments which some vse to the contrarie

the matter which we entreate of

hath alwaies beene accounted of the sages to be of such depth and profunditie that it was ordered amongst the ancient hebrewes that any who had not attained to ripe age good yeeres might not meddle with the creation
of this prohibition doth hierome make mention
and therefore saint augustine vpon genesis searching out the deepe secrets hidden vnder the vaile of simple words therein contained speaketh to the reader in this manner
comprehend this if thou canst if not not leaue it to them which are more learned
but make profite of the scripture which abandoneth not thy weaknesse but like a mother steppeth foote by foote an easie pace with thee
for it speaketh in such sort that in height it scorneth the proude in depth it astonisheth those which are attentiue to it
it feedeth the great with truth and nourisheth the small ones with milde and familiar discourse
and in truth in each part of moses writings the treasures of all philosophie are by him discouered like as if they were closely hidden in some field chiefly in this place which we haue intended to entreat of touching the creation
for of deliberate purpose he argueth in philosophie of the originall of all things of god of the degree number and order of the parts of this great world
we neuerthelesse hauing confidence in this saying of the psalmist

that the word of god doth illuminate and giue vnderstanding to the simple and that it serueth for a light to our pathes we may be bolde to touch so loftie a point

but before we proceed to consider of the precious treasures and learned doctrine wherewith the sacred sayings of the prophet touching the creation are replenished it will be good that we discourse a little of the principall arguments whereupon manie better philosophers then good christians haue obiected against this doctrine of framing of the world
and will willingly begin with this old question of the epicure

which the atheists of our time haue renewed to wit why in the time that moses recordeth it pleased the eternal god to create heauen and earth

which he had not made before if they which say thus woulde thereby inferre that the worlde hath beene eternall without any beginning and for that cause it seemeth to them that god made it not they are too farre wide of the truth and sicke of the mortall disease of impietie
for besides the manifold tellings and propheticall testimonies which make the creation of heauen and earth vndoubtable euen the world it selfe by his motion and well ordered changing the gorgeous shew of all things visible therein contained not speaking one word do after a sort cry out that it was made that it could be no otherwise formed then by god who is ineffablie inuisibly glorious
for it is not to be supposed that a thing of most exquisite order reason should haue bin made by chance that a deed most soueraigne could haue any other father then soueraigne nor so goodly a worke anie other architect then one essentially goodly
and therefore all the schooles of those philosophers which haue had any whit of diuine sense affirme with one consent that there is nothing which more prooueth that god hath made the world and that it is gouerned by his care prouidence then the only beholding of the whole world and consideration of the beautie and order thereof
but see heere what imagination not grounded on sense putteth into the mouthes of many
what did god say they before he created the world why staide he till then or why staide he not a little longer in these and such like doubts they inwrap themselues making no difference betweene the condition of god and our owne betweene his eternall essence and that of those things which haue once had a beginning
but with a discreete and pleasant answere saint augustine resolueth those which demaunde what god did before the fabrication of the world
he was busie saith he cutting downe wood in the forrest to burne the rash and curious who remember not what they themselues did yesterday and yet dare inquire what god hath done of eternitie
but that may speake to the most subtile let the best learned among them tell me what they intend by this worde before whereof they inquire

if they meane the passing away oftime they deceiue themselues because time tooke beginning with the world
and if by the worde they imagine something concerning eternitie they abuse themselues also for therein is neither before nor after
for eternitie is an entire being at once altogither without any proceeding
whereby it is

euident that their question is nothing
time therefore cannot accord with eternitie nor be eternall seeing eternall hath no processe
it is therefore a foolish question why before time was god created not the temporall world as if there had beene some succeeding seasons before any succession did consist for one cannot with any reason imagine any time before the stablishing of the vniuers
yet aristotle whom the atheists will rather beleeue then the word of truth prooueth no other thing when he enforceth himselfe to declare the eternitie of the world then that time was neuer without the world nor the world without time which the sages say march in equall pace with the place
wherefore as there is nothing beside place appertaining to place so there is nothing beside time belonging to time
and for those which aske why the creator made not his world later againe request them that setting apart the worke of the vniuers they would assigne me their before after then will render them a reason why god created not the world sooner or later it is most certaine that they shall be constrained to confesse that before the order entercourse of the spheres there was neuer any before or after which are the conditions of time
and therefore their rash demaund deserueth no other answere except we recount vnto them the pleasant saying of democritus which is not vnfit for our purpose in this place no man regards that which is before his feete and yet we see many sound the secrets of heauen and curiously seeke after the mysteries of god

there are others also who disputing more subtilly of these matters agree verie well that the world was made but they will not allow that it had a beginning of time but of his owne creation so that it hath alwaies had a being in some sort which they cannot vnderstand
those found their opinion vpon this pretext to defend that god should not do any action new or of chaunce for feare least men should beleeue that that came suddenly into his minde which before he had not determined to make the world and that he who is immutable in all things should create it through a thought
now as they make doubt concerning the time which they would not haue begun with the vniuers let me aske them also why the world was set in that place where it resteth rather then any other where for if they suppose infinite spaces of time before the generation of the vniuers in which it seemeth not that god could rest from worke they may aswell beleeue many spaces of

place out of the world wherein if any could affirme that the omnipotent hath not been idle they should be forced to dreame with the epicure of innumerable worlds
but if they answere me that the thoughts of men are vaine by which they suppose of infinite places sith there is no place out of the world may tell the also that they are in the consideration of time sith there was neuer any before the world
and therefore as it is no consequence that god framed the vniuers rather by aduenture then by diuine reason not in any other place but in that wherein it is though mans capacitie cannot comprise the same diuine reason by which it was so made so is it no consequence that we should denie that it happened to god by chaunce or by a new imagination when he created the world rather in one certaine time then before seeing that the times precedent how we may imagine them should be equally past away comparing them with eternitie by an infinite space at once and there should be no difference why an auncient time should be preferred before a latter
wherefore we must all beleeue that the world was made with the time and that time tooke beginning with the world

and that notwithstanding in making it god chaunged not his eternall counsell nor his immutable will but according to his inscrutable prouidence and bountie innate he would when he pleased compose the large frame of the vniuers full of his image
and here the definition which aristotle maketh of time serueth to our purpose to wit that it is the measure of motion
for if immutable eternitie is easily discerned from time who perceiueth not that time had neuer beene if some creature had not beene made who might chaunge the created species by moouing for that which giueth time his course is the chaunging of things when they giue place one to another and one succeed another because they cannot consist all at once together
let vs conclude therefore seeing that the holy and most true writings expresse that in the beginning god created heauen and earth we may assure our selues there was nothing before then and that doubtlesse the world was not made in time but with it
for that which is done in time is done both before and after some time after say that which is past and before that which is to come
now before the world there was no creature by the chaungeable motion of which time might haue proceeding
wherefore the world and time haue the same beginning

by the will of almightie god and according as is declared vnto vs in his word against which there is no other reason of sophists which can conclude any reasonable apparance as you aram may amply declare in the processe of our discourse

of the nullitie of reasons framed concerning the nature of the world against the creation thereof
chap

aram

this sentence of simonides the ancient poet is wel woorthie to be celebrated by the mouth of euery christian man god alone hath the glorie to be supernaturall
for what other cause can we inuent of his workes but his onely but what rashnes rendreth man so audacious as to enquire the cause of gods will seeing it is

and by good right must be the cause of all things which subsist for if it had had any cause then must that cause haue preceded and the will of god attended thereupon which were vnlawfull to be imagined
wherefore when it is asked why did god so we must answere bicause it was his will
if proceeding farther any enquire why it was his will they demaund after a thing greater and higher then the will of god which cannot be found
yet neuerthelesse haue we sufficient in his word wherewith to satisfie our mindes in meditation of his secrets with all reuerence
for they which haue declared them vnto vs penetrating into most hidden mysteries by the light of the holy spirit haue sufficiently reuealed them vnto vs with most splendant cleerenesse
but the way of truth is shut vp to the wise of the world and cannot be attained but by the directions of it selfe
so that which is greatly to be deplored it often commeth to passe which this iambicke relateth that the vnderstanding of things giuen by god in long tract of time is co~founded by mens opinions retaining very little diuinitie truth by reason that it agreeth not with those things which fall within the compasse of our sense
the philosophers therefore attributing too much faith to themselues haue blinded themselues through their vaine discourses and haue become guides to the blinde so that falling into the ditch they haue drawne many after them by false arguments and apparant reasons whereof our subiect shall here be to insert the most principall

they then who esteeme that nothing is stable or can be stable in such sort reasoning and arguing by sensible things prooue it by the same demonstration that aristotle hath deliuered

yea and as he hath obserued in his whole discourse natural progression considering that all his consequences proceede from certaine maximes which he supposed to be perfect true amongst the most powerfull inuentions by which they pretend to ouerthrow the creation and framing of the world these peripatericall reasons of the nature of the world are produced
first they beholde the heauens altogither differing from contrarietie

whereupon they conclude that it is not corruptible and by conseque~ce not made
they finde moreouer that those things which haue a beginning doe get vnto themselues a new place nowe heauen not being able to get it selfe a new place they conclude that it could not be created at any time
they consider also that all things which are mooued passe into a new place or are mooued round about some thing which remaineth firme as all the spheres are about their center to the end that all disorder might be brought to some vniformitie
likewise they suppose euery new thing to be reduced into the old so that all generation and corruption is made according to the old substance and all motion is gouerned by the firme and stable earth or the vnmooueable center by which principles they coulde not perceiue how the newnes of the world could any way come to passe
and forasmuch as the generation of one thing is the corruption of another and that nothing which should be corrupted might precede the world thereupon they ground that it is eternall without a beginning
proceeding farther they suppose that euerie thing which is produced had a in the matter thereof
therfore they holde that of necessitie the matter must be eternall
but the most principall and substantiall argument which they bring and most generally receiued is that of nothing nothing is created whereupon they conclude that the world could not be made bicause nothing did proceede it

now we may easily answere these reasons and trie whether they conclude

or not but first let vs suppose as it is most certaine that there be three sorts of works and three kindes of workers
for there is the artificer who presupposeth the nature to wit the stuffe fashion and all the compound
there is the naturall agent which requireth the effect of god to wit

the subiect or the matter
and there is god the soueraigne worker who hath no neede of any other thing because he is perfect retaining in himselfe all manner of vertue
which three kindes of workers doe fitly accord by a certaine analogie and proportion but doe much differ in comparison one with the other and at the bounds and limits of the one worker cannot be concluded the power of the other
for it were an error to proceed from arte to nature as if one should say the arte doth first require the compound the goldsmith gold the founder mettall the carpenter wood and the mason stones and cement therefore the naturall agent doth also require the compound

and likewise the philosophers deceiue themselues when they imagine that the soueraigne creator hath neede of a subiect or matter to worke on as is requisite for the naturall agent
also they abuse themselues to teach that forasmuch as herein there passeth a certaine proportion from one contrarie to another it therefore followeth that god and nature doe proceede by one and the way
but where pray haue they learned to inuent such conclusions when themselues teach that arte is distinguished from nature and that naturall things appertaine to one kinde of doctrine and the eternall and belong to another for the artificer giueth the artificiall forme and requireth the naturall and the naturall agent fashioneth the substantiall and requireth the materiall which is the worke of the soueraigne
but if god should require any thing to worke with he should also require a former god which must haue produced it and by that reason there should be wot not what former thing before the first
what are then these shewes of arguments they conclude and accord badly when bicause of the passion of a new place which demaundeth that which is newly performed they would thereby exclude the world from generation bicause it getteth not a place
but what absurditie shall they finde it if granting them that it hath obtained a place say it is the same wherein at this present it remaineth for it subsisteth about the center or aboue that of the earth or of the whole vniuers or of the sphere intellectuall whose center as hermes saith is all that which is euerie where created
in that which they farther inferre that euery new thing must be reduced to an olde we grant it them
but that olde is the diuine cogitation wherein all things are contained before they be displaied in their proper formes

which being created by it selfe it alone doth gouerne and preserue them afterwardes
what they moreouer adioine that all naturall transmutation is made of one matter transposed into another we consent to them
but this is not requisite in the primitiue production free from all lawes of nature whereto by right the prince thereof is not obliged
and we agree also that euery thing which is produced must first be included in some other power before it be effected but we say that naturall things remained first in the matter and the world and diuersitie of substances were comprised in the ideas or exemplaries resident euerlastingly in god
and so doe the platonists maintaine who mounting much higher then the peripateticks agree with that which saint iohn saith

that all things were made by the word and that in it was life which brought foorth all things and that in it the world before was by power comprised
wherefore these be no dreames as aristotle calleth them but the ideas of plato but those are sighted like the bat who see not the things most manifest in nature thereby to acknowledge the author of nature
and to the end that we loosen the strongest knot of their arguments to wit

that of nothing nothing is created would desire them to expound me their sentence bicause it is doubtfull and ambiguous for if the sense be thus that of nothing by arte or nature nothing is made bicause they require the matter whereupon to worke we willingly accord
but what is this to purpose concerning the supreme and almightie architect whom nature doth follow after as farre as arte doth nature as all philosophers confesse for according as the naturall agent bounded and subiect to motion time and succession is lesse and more disable in essence so is it lesse in performance then he who is free and at libertie from all lawes of nature
but if they meane that of nothing to wit after it hath no being nothing is created then haue they left it to this present to discusse and to all posteritie for euer
wherefore we haue a spacious field to denie them that which is neither prooued nor euident in it selfe
if they inferre that this nothing reiecteth all manner of causes then we consent to them in this point
but in the creation or generation of the world we presuppose as truth requireth a working and soueraigne cause who in the infinite vertue of it selfe containeth the matter subiect and fashion to bestow the meanes the disposing qualities and all that which is requisite to reduce and bring

to perfection any busines
behold then how all these arguments conclude nothing against the doctrine of the worlds creation no more these other reasons deriued from the motions and their bounds which the peripateticks doe farther induce against the same as pursuing this matter achitob we may heare of you

of the reasons taken from motion and the moouing intelligences against the genesis of the world and of the nullitie of them
chapter

achitob

the peripateticks whereof now adaies manie may be found perseuering in their naturall speculations

and considering that motion consisteth in that which is mooued or ingendred or else in the subiect of transmutation and because no substance did precede the primitiue production of the world thereupon they conclude that it was neuer created
but it is no maruell if they be greatly abused seeing they would neuer swarue from their sense and sensible things whereof no pure and sincere truth can be gathered because that by them or by the reasons on them founded we cannot attaine to the knowledge of diuine mysteries which are intellectuall farre remote from any substance moouing succession or other sensiblenes
and therefore they much deceiue themselues when they in such sort argue of these grosse material generations comparing them with the diuine master peece of worke which surpasseth all meanes of nature
they maintaine that all direct or forward motion cannot be perpetuall because it requireth infinit space which nature is not able to endure but circular motion because it passeth nothing infinit may be perpetuall
now in eternall things the consequence is good from the power to the being
one may then say they thereby assure himselfe of the eternitie of the world
but see a goodly reason to presuppose that to be perpetuall and infinite which they pretend to prooue
auerrois proceedeth farther and saith that it is impossible for the world to haue had any other disposition then such as at this present it hath and that being exempt from all contrarietie it followeth that in no wise it is corruptible and therefore

was not engendred
but who reuealed vnto him that which he supposeth of the state of the world with what measure pretendeth he to meat out the puissance of the soueraigne workeman

by what authoritie dares he limite out the power of the infinite so that hee may not destroy and builde vp at his good pleasure say then that the passing away of heauen hath another kinde of bound and limit then the earth and the very rest it selfe whereto as with one minde all philosophers teach all motion doth tend

but forasmuch as motion begetteth time and time it selfe is the measure of motion thereby it commeth that forging their arguments vpon one part of time they misse and faile in reason when they dispute thus if the world was not before it tooke beginning seeing this before is an appendix of time then it followeth that time shoulde precede motion which is his cause and progenitor
again they say in euery instant and moment assigned is the beginning of time to come and the end of time past then time hath beene before this first instant and consequently motion and the world
but the cause of these errors proceedeth from the misunderstanding of words when they woulde barre that this worde before should signifie any thing else then some part of time
for as well in the diuine as prophane writings of all authors who can speake fitly and properly we may finde that this particle before signifieth more then a part of time for sometimes it denoteth the extreme as is said in the prouerbes

the lord hath possessed me in the beginning of his way before he created any thing haue had principalitie from euerlasting

and before the earth
and in ecclesiasticus he created me from the beginning and before the world
ouid himselfe in his metamorphosis vseth this manner of speech before the sea the earth and heauen which couereth all things though that being of a fine and subtile spirite he was not ignorant that time slideth away by reason of the turning of heauen
moreouer this worde ante signifieth amongst the latins the highest degree whereof is deriued antistes he which is principall and cheefe among others
sith therefore this particle before hath diuers significations why will our peripateticks restraine it to denote any other thing but onely a portion of time
would they not grant me this that by a certaine order the matter was before the forme and yet preceded it not in time so is it that god was before the world by a certaine order

of eternitie
what they farther inferre that the instant is the end of time past and the beginning of time to come

we answere them that as the point is to things continued so is the instant to things succeeding
now the point is sometime the extreme of one part of a line and the beginning of another part and sometimes also it is the beginning of the whole line and not the end of any part precedent
so the instant and moment wherein the world had being was the beginning of the time to ensue and not the end of any past
they adde another argument against this doctrine that say they which passeth on hath something both before and after it but ile proceede farther and grant them more to wit that all that which passeth on returneth to the same point from whence it began to passe
for the water returneth to the sea from whence it had an originall
the bodie returneth to the earth from whence it was borrowed
the soule

and other intellectuall things created of god except that which the scripture teacheth vs of the reprobate returne to himselfe of whom they were engendred
and all essences produced from the diuine thought make a full circle beginning in god and finishing in god himselfe
so must time returne into the same eternitie whereout it proceeded and which shall remaine this same ceasing in such sort as it consisted before it
and therefore we answere those who demaund how the creator coulde precede the fabrication of the world that hee proceeded it by an eternall enduring
wherefore they conclude iust nothing against the creation of that which then was and is after the generation of things
others which reason vpon the point which we haue deliuered concerning the opinion of auerrois that the world is not corruptible therefore not engendred argue thus
that which is dissolued into another thing is diuided but considering that beside the world there is nothing into which it can be dissolued it must therefore endure euerlastingly
to which we may answere them

that the world is dissolued according to his parts to the ende that it may remaine in a better estate
but now we dispute not of the dissolution but onely of the originall thereof
and it may seeme nothing contrarie to christian religion that the worke of god may alwaies haue a being but farre otherwise then as we see it and which shall be then when we most blessed shall inhabite the new heauens and new earth in life euerlasting
and herein doe

we concurre with sundrie great philosophers who esteeme that it is ill done to suppose that those things which immediately proceed from the blessed god can perish
and therefore we affirme that the soule is immortall because it was produced and inspired by god and that the bodie it selfe shall obtaine eternitie when afterwards in the resurrection it shall be reuested with the nature of the soule which subiect we haue amply discoursed vpon in the second part of our academie
but it is to take away all beginning from things by reason of the perpetuall enduring of the same

for as we haue declared it were to argue by naturall generations of the diuine masterpeece of worke which surpasseth all sensible consideration
and sith we are in this talke of the enduring of the world we may further note that those who haue thereupon imagined to take away the originall thereof haue taught that the spirits moouing the spheres should obtaine felicitie in the eternall recourse of the heauens which point aristotle enforceth himselfe to demonstrate in his most loftie part of philosophie where repeating diuers considerations more loftie then in any other place he sharply contendeth for this eternitie of the world
and iohn lescot seemeth to graunt him more then he requireth when he saith that the spirits are blessed not only moouing the spheres but for so much as by such reuolution seruing god they communicate perfection to things here beneath
to which agreeth that which plotin entreating of heauen and of the soule of the world saith it is an absurd thing and discordant to suppose that that soule which did for a time containe the heauen should not alwaies do the same as if by violence it had contained it
and thereupon he co~cludeth that the world should endure for euer because the principall part of the soule thereof cannot be dissolued nor the nature thereof empaire
aristotle also amongst his other considerations inserteth this that the prince of this worldly palace being eternall not receiuing any vicissitude or chaunging it is most likely that his palace should also be eternall and that his ministers or celestiall spirits being altogither addicted to perpetuall motion should neuer take rest
but that we may vntie this knot we will say that it is an error of comparison to argue of that which hath his beginning immediately from god in respect of the creator and of that which is here below in regard of things aboue and of the immediate ende of euerie thing in comparison of his last ende

for the immediate end of vnreasonable creatures is to liue

and feede themselues but their finall ende is to serue mans vse which according to the minde of sundrie wisemen is the ende of all things here below
and the immediate ende of man is to gouerne his house and family or the to contemplate trafficke and such like businesses but his latest ende is to attaine to god or to felicitie be it as one would say through a stoicall vertue or by a peripateticke contemplation or by academicke purifying or which is most certaine true through faith and grace according as our religion doth import
and also wee affirme that the immediate ende of the spirits separated from god and of the corruptible matter is to gouerne the heauens and men and such other things as haue beene committed to their charge
but their last ende is their onely contemplation of that first essence from which they deriue their felicitie as aristotle himselfe testifieth in his ethickes
suppose then that they cease to mooue from their immediate end yet shall they neuer cease to be blessed no more then man shall be lesse happie when he shall cease to gouerne the or to performe his other temporall businesses
and certainely it is maruellous that any can thinke that the angels and celestiall spirits should obtaine their happines by moouing the heauens continually about seeing that all moouings as the philosophers teach do tend to a resting
but none can say that the spirits shall not cease because they still labour but when they haue accomplished and performed their worke and deliuered such fauour to terrestriall things as they were charged with
and for the soule whereof plotin makes mention one may likewise affirme that it shall not cease to giue life to the vniuers when it shall cease to mooue
for as we haue alreadie heard we maintaine not the annihilating of the elements of the world or the parts thereof but rather the resting after the motion in such sort as all nature must be in the ende after sundrie reuolutions reduced to the rest of the sabbaoth vnknowne to many learned men
let all those then who trouble themselues without meane or measure to search out the end of the worldly frame or contend about the originall thereof here fixe their foote least running without ceasing in their fantasies after this perpetuall moouing they neuer rest and least by no light they can behold their repose being alwaies troubled with a continuall course
now then aser

leaue to you to prosecute the confutation of diuers other arguments vpon this matter of the creation

of many other deuises which they inuent who pretend to ouerthrow the doctrine of the creation of the world performed by the creator thereof
chapter

aser

besides that which we haue hitherto heard concerning the reasons and arguments whereupon many depend who denie that the world had a beginning finde that such are willingly induced to thinke

that by reason of this new creation or generation of the vniuers there might seeme to arise some new deuise in the creator because of the newnes of the worke by consequence an alteration of his mind or will which cannot happen to the most perfect and immutable neither within himselfe for nothing can mooue it selfe nor outwardly without himselfe for then that should consist and encrease which was without him by the empairing and wearing away of the most infinite these are the termes which aristotle auerrois moses of egypt and their disciples vse alleaging many other considerations which cicero in the person of the epicure enueighing against plato in his fluent and eloquent speech hath collected in the discourse of an oration

with what eies saith he coulde your plato behold the arte and composition of so great a worke by the which he saith the world was builded and composed by god what inuentions of buildings what iron workes what lifting leauers what engins what ministers had he in so great a businesse how is it that the aire fire earth and water coulde obey to the whence issued the fiue formes whereof all the rest are formed falling out fitly to compose the soule and produce the sense and a little after he proceedeth woulde faine aske these fellowes why vpon a sodaine these builders of the world started vp who had beene a sleepe by the space of innumerable ages for though there was then no world yet were there certaine ages although they were not such as are made of a number of daies and nights by course of yeeres for confesse that those could not come to passe without the turning of the world but there was of infinite time a

kinde of eternitie which no terme nor circuit of time did measure
neuerthelesse none can diuine of what space it hath beene because it falleth not into humane sense that there could be any time then when time was not
then in such an vnlimited space why should the prouidence be idle why should he flie labour and what cause was there why god like the sheriffe of a citie should desire to adorne the world with signes and lights if it were to them that god might the better dwell at his ease he had then an infinite time before dwelt in darknesse as if in an hole or
but if we thinke that he hath thus beautified heauen and earth because he delighted in the diuersitie thereof what may this pleasure of god be whereof he was so long time before depriued may it be for loue towards man as you might inferre that god made all these things but hath this loue beene for wisemen or for fooles if for the wise then to small purpose god wot hath this so exceeding great compiling of things beene made
if for the foolish first there was no occasion why god shoulde seeke to deserue any thing of the euill then what hath he gotten when euery one being a flatte foole is most miserable in that he is not wise for what can we name that's woorse then follie hitherto cicero
alcinois speaking like him doth farther adde that sith there is nothing beside the world which may do it violence it can suffer neither maladie nor consumption nor any dissolution at all
forasmuch then as it must perpetually endure it followeth also that it hath beene without beginning
auicen according with him saith he which negotiateth by the power of another may instantly produce that which before he coulde not for hee must attend the pleasure of such as worke with him but the first that worketh by his proper power needes not attend but worke continually
behold then how the seruants of the world contend for the dignitie of their prince endeuouring to make him eternall as if volu~tarily subiecting themselues to a continuall reuolution they woulde defeat themselues for euer attaining to any rest wherein consisteth true felicitie
but we must fight for the soueraigne creator which is our peace and true sabbaoth defending like good and valiant warriors his eternall rest whereto all reuolution of the world doth referre it selfe and presently it will appeere hee himselfe aiding vs how weake those engins are which our aduersaries haue planted against his worke and against the wall of truth

first we will consent to aristotle and to the defenders of his doctrine that there came to god by the framing of the vniuers a new imagination but full of reason and without any alteration in his nature or will and moreouer the same was properly reall and all one with his eternall will towards the generation of the world to performance whereof he also proceeded according to his good pleasure
but woonder at so many instances as they intend to found vpon this seeing we behold how assidually many new things are produced wherof returneth a either towards god framing or gouerning or at least as they say so as may be towards their wished and desired end
demand then why should the of creating the world make more against the maiestie of god and not the inuention of the new partes thereof euery moment arising algazel sarasyn holds it not vnmeete that the most perfect agent hauing all conditions thereto co~cording deferred neuerthelesse to produce his worke in effect so long as he pleased and that then he performed it without any motion in him of noueltie
and there is no philosopher which prooueth the contrarie by any demonstration concerning this newnesse which they presuppose in god but do ful oftentimes contradict themselues
and so it is that aristotle in his booke of the world after hauing in the beginning declared god prince gouernour and creator of this vniuers doth afterwards denie it proceeding by reasons deriued from sense
for thereby hee endeuoureth to demonstrate the eternitie of the worlde and amongst other arguments he vseth this same
it is most certaine that the agent either of deliberate purpose or by nature if he be good putteth the good in practise as much as in him possiblie lieth if there be nothing to hinder him
certainly we co~fesse that the good is naturally addicted to communitie
but we hold that although the agent by his labour industrie endeuoureth with all his power to get the good and obtaine it yet neuerthelesse in the distribution thereof he bestoweth it in such manner and sort as he pleaseth
why should we not then affirme that the supreme creator through his immutable and omnipotent will hauing from euerlasting the good for his obiect to the end to put it in practise doth according to his good pleasure proceed to the performance thereof but if any passing farther will argue that the good doth naturally become common heereto mounting much

higher then philosophie doth require we answere that for euer god who is the soueraigne good doth encrease himselfe in his sonne and spirit coeternall by which sonne and through which holy spirite one sole essence and substance he produced of eternitie and continually the exemplaries and ideas of all thinges by an eternal measure alwaies present being the worke and possession altogither
we tell thee then epicure that god remained not in sloth idlenes before the creation of the world

he that by the testimonie of iesus christ doth alwaies worke whereof none knoweth but the creator saue onely the sonne and he to whom the sonne shal haue reuealed him
and he which is most blessed in himselfe slept not cicero no more then hauing no neede of any thing beside himselfe he framed not this worldly tabernacle for his owne vse with so great beautifulnes but rather for man not foolish or wicked but iust and wise or at least

that in this terrestriall habitation he might learne wisedome and goodnes to be made at length a woorthy citizen of the celestiall palace
this is the delight and pleasure which his sapience receiued in the compasse of the earth and in the sonnes of men as the wiseman saith
but neither aristotle nor auerrois nor cicero nor the epicures and atheists of our time haue attained to such supreme philosophie as to vnderstand this language of the holie ghost
excellent well did that thrise woorthie mercury the prince and most ancient of all philosophers acknowledge as the whole worke of his pymander doth testifie and himselfe also when he saith that god whom some call nature mixing himselfe with man performed a wonder surpassing the reason of all woonder wherein beholding his owne image he smiled vpon him through great loue and gratifying him as his owne sonne gaue him all his workes to serue him to the ende to reduce to himselfe all things by him with whom he was mixed but himselfe before any thing else because that being purified and acknowledging his diuine race hee might bee made most woorthie of god
the eternall omnipotent then had no neede of tooles to frame the worlde with hee saie that by his onelie commandement performeth all things
neither had he need of helpe to produce formes who is himselfe the architype and giuer of all formes and replenished with all fecunditie
neither is it a strange thing that the elements should obey him which by his worde onely haue beene setled in their places

neither dwelt he in an hole or a corner nor in darknes whom heauen earth cannot containe nor comprehend and who is all light but within the ample temple of this imme~se intellectuall sphere whose ce~ter is al that which euery where subsisteth
there hee inhabiteth those euerlasting ages which no thought except himselfe can comprise
it is no maruel therefore if humaine reason be so often deceiued in the search of that which is enclosed in the closets and cabinets of the soueraigne and reuealed but to very fewe
and for the saying of alcinois that there is nothing beside the world whereinto the world can be dissolued answere him that we teach not that it must be consumed and brought to nothing though it hath had a beginning of enduring
but say it is so god shall haue no need of any thing for this businesse no more then he had neede of a subiect to make and compose his worke of by reason that his creation or dissolution is free and deliuered from the lawes of naturall generation and corruption as we haue heeretofore already declared
neither had he neede of helpe auicen who through his proper power and according to his owne good pleasure performeth of his owne liberalitie all things not by nature and necessitie as those imagine to whom the eternall power of god and his loue for which he created the world are hidden as in the processe of our discourse we may more amplie declare
but first let vs heare of amana concerning those things which haue caused the philosophers to erre from the truth

concerning those causes which haue made the philophers to erre from the knowledge of truth and of their ignorance concerning god and his workes
chapter

amana

we may by our precedent discourse easilie vnderstand what be the strongest engins which the philosophers haue planted but in vaine against the wals of supernall veritie in this point concerning the creation and we need not thinke it strange that they be deceiued for it is a doctrine not vsurped by humane arrogancie but infused into the harts of the small ones and humble through illumination by the holy spirite which mocketh such as

thinke themselues wise scorne all others leauing them in the darknes of their blinded presumption as contrariwise the same spirit directeth conducteth those whom he replenisheth with his owne vertue to contemplate in most cleere brightnes the excellent mysteries of god and nature
but to the end that we may partly proceed to the discouery of their ignorance who do arrogantly assume vnto themselues the name of wisedome abusing euen to this day many vnskilfull in the knowledge of pietie by their graue ornate writings being in shew and apparance like somewhat that sauoreth as it were solide entire true profitable though being profoundly examined one may finde therein all cleane contrarie a maruellous repugnancie not only generally betweene them all but euen in the particular writings of each of them
would willingly aske to be resolued of them in this point how is it that they know the most blessed god for now speake to such as are not verie farre off from religion and godlines for as for atheists and such as beleeue not god we will deale with them apart in the sequele of our discourse doubt not but they will answere me that they haue knowledge of god by the motions and other sensible things which lead them by the hand to all such things as may be knowne by vs
for these be their common sayings
all our knowledge proceedeth of sense
and the experience of true discoursing is

that it agree with that which is perceiued by sense that being best knowne which best agreeth with sense
but would entreat them to tell me if sensible things haue an agreement of one and the selfe same name or of a name common to manie with the soueraigne god it is most certaine that they are not of one signification or name to the ende that we may follow their owne institutions by which they teach that god and things created do not agree in a selfe same proportion of substance or essence
and if one nominate all kinds he shall name them saith aristotle by many sundrie names
but if god and his workes are diuers in reason then is it no maruell if the philosophers proceeding by things here below deceiue themselues in the knowledge of god
for how can they imagine of his high maiestie by the motions these things sensible seeing the eternall is altogither exempt from sense and motion doth not aristotle affirme and after him auerrois the arabian that god is altogither different from the manner of creatures that he is the first moouer not being mooued is it

not to depriue themselues of the true knowledge of god by sensible things when they separate him from the manner of creatures let vs not thinke it strange then if those who admit nothing but that which they can inuent and comprise by naturall reasons and syllogismes deriued from sensible things enforce themselues to take from the omnipotent many things which are to them hidden and vnknowne being onely receiued by an holy intellect and by a pure and celestiall thought diuinely infused as are these verities following
that god hath created the world that of a free and liberal will he framed and ordained it when and according as it pleased him that it belongeth to man the of worke of his power to consider what this great god produced according to nature and what according to his bountie innate how he dealt in his workes briefly all the secrets of so wondrous a workeman
but to returne to our purpose woonder how these philosophers will on one side distinguish god altogither from the creatures and on another side wil measure his and power by that which they consider of things here below
would entreat them to heare and yet they haue no occasion heerein to doe it for they know it well enough alreadie speake therefore to their schollers that which saint dennis first instructed in their doctrine

and afterward lightened with the beames of the holy ghost hath saide of the eternall
god saith he is euerie thing in excellencie
for euerie good thing which we behold in these domesticall things wee must dedicate and appropriate the same to god in the most excellent sort that wee can
for euerie thing which appeareth faire in the worke should flourish much fairer in the worker
and that which is in it selfe woorthie of the simplest

and meanest commendation is in him found to be the best and most excellent of all for good in a better is euer most good
good is wisedome in a citizen better in a president and most good in a king
good is fortitude in a souldier better in a captaine but most good in a prince
the like is to be thought concerning clemency liberalitie and other vertues and ornaments
sith then fecunditie puissance vigor pietie beautie magnificence and such other properties doe shine in things here below much more must they in the diuine thought shoote out their beames in soueraigne brightnes
for in the creatures all these vertues like borowed colours doe point out the soule of

the world but in the celestial prince they flame out in raies of his infinite esse~ce which vniteth al things being appropriated dedicated vnto it
see then how we must speake and beleeue concerning the soueraigne and how to measure his workes by his omnipotencie and power
but forasmuch as the philosophers doe confesse that god is the first and best of all things and all other things are vnder him and subiect to him and that they praise and commend in them fertilitie liberalitie generation and such other vertues and faculties which from time to time do here make manifest their effects wherefore should they not acknowledge them in the soueraigne good god who saith in esay if giue fruitfulnes to others shall be barren they may tell me that they separate from god not onely all that which feeleth his owne imperfection but all that also which wanteth of perfection and thereof it ariseth that they take from him all fertilitie concerning things that are without him least any new thing or alteration might bee attributed to the euerlasting and immutable and likewise the libertie of contingence least as if imperfect

he might seeme to negotiate vnder hope of reward and yet they denie him not the libertie by which he worketh as is conuenient for him
certainely these be subtile and sharpe allegations and yet of small force
for let me aske them if all schooles teach not that the things of this world enforce themselues to their power to represent the image of god the platonists in euerie discourse doe acknowledge it as well as the theologians
yea the peripatetickes themselues agree in this point as their master teacheth in the second treatise of the soule in such words
it is the most naturall deed of all liuing things so far forth as they be perfect not impotent to make another thing like to it selfe as the beast a beast the plant a plant because they participate of the diuine and eternal essence so much as they can
for all essences desire it and all things which follow their course according to nature worke for the loue of it but they cannot imitate it continually and with perpetuall proportion because no corruptible thing attayneth to bee one and the same in number
these bee verie obscure sayings but yet by them we may learne that all creatures tend according to their facultie to agree with the semblance of god and by how much more each member of this worldly body is more perfect by so much more doth it enforce it selfe as if in emulation to

imitate the creator of it
it is true that auerrois doth interpret this text of aristotle concerning heauen
but how should the heauen be this eternall whom all things should enforce themselues to follow considering that it of it selfe is eternall in fauour of whom the elements heauen it selfe and euerie creature doth worke doth not the doctrine of aristotle resound in each point that god is the end of all things in desire of whom they are mooued as to the thing loued and desired but leauing this arabian auerrois who studieth in all his works to deface marre many other sentences of his master that he may defend that which he imagineth let vs conclude that according as the philosophers confesse the elements in their being the plants in their life and fruitfulnes the liuing creatures in a better life and in their condition such as it is imitate in emulation the diuine power and perfection and that man endued with the singular gift of libertie and free will doth in the same imitate god and beareth in a better estate and condition then any other thing his image and semblance by such considerations say is also prooued the freedome and libertie of god alwaies tending to good according to his good pleasure because he contayneth within himselfe that which hee conferreth vpon others
and briefly to answere all their reasons heretofore alleaged let vs hold that that soueraigne perfection which is in god wanteth not in the lowest degree nor for the cause thereof nor yet that his simple vnitie is distributed into a multitude because that in it selfe by infinite power it contayneth all things
neither doth the intellectuall soule degenerate although as they teach it exerciseth the power to feele

to strengthen to cause encreasing and to mooue according to his estate
for that we may mount to higher considerations god perceiueth with such his senses as the holy scriptures attribute vnto him he mooueth all other things himselfe remaining stable he giueth them strength and feedeth them with the foode of his wisedome
but hee performeth all these things by a meanes by a perfection power which is vnknowne to humane spirits except they be illustrated with his light
and there is in him a fertilitie without trauel which is the fountaine of all other things through which he produceth alwaies within himselfe but outwardly he doth it at the pleasure of his will
which because it is the rule of contingence it is not possible nor fit for vs to search out the cause of the first beginning
for when we are

thereto arriued aristotle himselfe doth charge to stay for god hath no need of any precedent disposition nor of helpe neither did feare resistance nor was hindered by space he who in commaunding created all things
but the causes of things here below the instruments and subiect framed by his word require a precedent disposition haue need of an application attaine succession of time and seeke such helpes as are requisite for such a one as negotiateth by power limited
and therefore as we haue alreadie said when they deduce their reasons from these conditionall and naturall workers to him which is free and deliuered from all these things they fall into diuers errors
but if by the workes which they contemplate in this vniuers they do enforce themselues to attaine to the knowledge of the soueraigne architect then let them attribute vnto him all these things after a conuenient perfect manner separating from him all that denoteth feeblenes and impotencie in the worker
and then they shall see that the supreme things of the architype accord by a sweete and melodious consonancie to those which are more base and meane all which are comprised in the creator as in a modell and patterne and contemplated by vs here below as in a shadow or trace
but this shadow and much more the trace doth want much of him whom they represent
and yet by them as by a token or priuie note we attaine to some obscure knowledge of the creator although his workes doe agree with him neither in different proportion or signification nor yet in al and through all in the same reason but onely by a certaine resemblance they represent vnto vs the perfect fashion of supernall things by their most grosse and base nature euerie one in their degree
but this is sufficient concerning this subiect now speake we of the authoritie of such witnesses as make the creation of the world vndoubtable which we refer to you aram to declare vnto vs

of the authoritie of such witnesses as make the creation and newnes of the world vndoubted
chapter

aran

as we haue seene how weake and feeble the arguments of philosophers against the creation and newnesse of the world are so is it expedient

also that being readie for the combat we march in battell against them armed with true and strong reasons and vnder the authoritie of very good and approoued witnesses to the end to make vndoubted to all

that which wee haue already declared concerning the creation of the vniuers
and first we will recite those who being woorthie of credite haue taught it vs
we haue alreadie seene how that the opinion of plato concerning this generation of the world accordeth with the doctrine of moses
mercurius trismegistus in his pimandre deliuereth in few words the same sacred mysteries rendring the composition of this vniuers and of the gouernors thereof and of all things created to be vndoubtable
and by the baser elements he aduertiseth vs of the pure workemanship of nature vnited neuerthelesse with the thought of the creator
which elements he affirmeth to be for this purpose established by the will of god onely and yet in farre woorse condition then before they were in the worker
empedocles of agrigentum and heraclitus of ephesus affirme not once but oftentimes the world to be engendred and corruptible
democritus teacheth that it hath had beginning that it one day must perish and neuer againe be renued
hesiod and orpheus the poets sing that it hath beene created
thales one of the seuen sages affirmeth

that this round frame is the worke of god
pythagoras hieraclus his expounder confesse god creator father of all things
to which accord auicen arabian algazel sarrasin philo no lesse excellent in doctrine then in greeke eloquence and alcinois the platonist who saith it is necessarie for the vniuersall world to be the worke of god
and many such other authors the most co~mended for learning whom it would be too lo~g tedious to rehearse affirme the same
but leauing the testimonies of strangers let vs come to such as haue receiued fro diuine oracles

by supernatural illumination that which they haue taught vnto vs
we haue heard that which moses teacheth vs concerning the generation of the world now let vs consider how his doctrine or rather the doctrine of the holy ghost speaking by the mouth of so excellent a prophet is confirmed vnto vs by miracles prodigies oracles and prophecies and lastly by the consent of euery part of his writings as also by the graue authoritie of those who in their interpretations of them doe confirme and approoue them

concerning his miracles they are all most manifest to such as haue read his bookes
the rod is

turned into a serpent and againe returned into the former shape it deuoureth the magicians rods shewing that the sorceries of vncleane spirits and all their puissance and force is consumed by the power of god which wrought and dealt in aaron and in moses
he bringeth foorth infinite little beasts and of sundrie sorts which pricke both man and beast he draweth water out of the stone giueth quailes from heauen bringeth thunder a cloud by day and a piller of fire by night and also the darke night and doth all this by the word of the liuing lord who one while terrifieth and another while comforteth his people
hee sendeth slaughter among the egyptians sudden losse and ruine to the wicked fire among the proud and leprosie to her that murmured and preserueth for a long time a great number from sicknes and their garments from waxing old and wearing
moreouer he feedeth them with heauenly food and giueth them victorie ouer all their enemies
such things and many such like things doth the soueraigne architect of this vniuers performe by his prophet to the end to approoue his doctrine and to teach vs his truth thereby
to this end also by the word of moses he appeaseth monsters

causeth the thunder to cease healeth such as were empoisoned to the end that so much the more through such prodigies his law the wisedome of life and doctrine by which hee instructed his people might be celebrated
and concerning oracles

they haue not beene deliuered vnto vs from a delphicke apollo from a iupiter from a pallas or any fained sapience or else from some newfound godhead but they bin giuen vs from the mouth of the liuing lord whose voice the innumerable multitudes of israell did sometimes heare
but if some as there are manie amongst vs will not beleeue moses alone relating all these things nor his people which haue written of them as he himselfe did yet let them at least giue credite to the many graue and sage authors who affirme them for a very truth

as to berosus the chaldee to manethon the egyptian hierome the phenician king darius mendesian ptolomy menander of ephesus nicolas damascenus abiden the historiographer estieus theodore chorilus and ezekiel the poets demetrius the historian hecatè of abdera the philosopher and aboue fortie other learned recorded for testimonie by iosephus aristobulus

tertullian and eusebius who all agree in recitation of the foresaide woonders
let vs proceed and come to the prophecies
of them ptolomy in his

booke of fruits saith those onely who are inspired by god prophecie of particular things
if then moses in his doctrine and all the other prophets which haue followed him haue prophecied of so many particular actions to the king of egypt to the tribes to many princes and kings as well concerning themselues as also concerning their cities and people who will doubt that they haue been instructed by the spirit of god who can accuse them of falshood who wil make doubt of their doctrine if one read the text of moses all points therein are so replenished with prophecies and future euents that there is nothing left out there concerning that which belongeth to the mysteries of diuine and philosophicall matters nor of the messias then to come nor yet of all whatsoeuer should afterward come to passe as is euident to those who haue the eies of their mindes illuminated and who vnderstand the bookes of the law to see cleane through a great many vailes vnder which as was most meete the prophet did hide so many profound mysteries
what man then of sounde iudgement that making small or no account of such and so great sacraments will rather then to beleeue in them haue recourse to the monuments of certaine philosophers not approoued by so many witnesses and whose writings sauour no whit of diuine matters we may very well receiue their instructions so far as they differ not from the doctrine of holy writ but we must altogither reiect that which relying vpon their owne authoritie or their owne inuention supported by their reasons and indeed not in many places ought woorth which they induce besides that which is contained in the writings of moses and the prophets
for if we will shew reuerence to authors

to which pray you shoulde we shew more either to aristotle auerrois epicures and such like who onely do shine with a small light of humaine doctrine or else to moses to the prophets to salomon the wisest of all his time to the euangelistes and to the apostles euerie of which in sapience in wisedome in manners in prophecies in oracles and in all kinde of holines do shine and flame like burning torches who affirme in an vnused stile that which they speake concerning diuine things proouing them with perill of their liues and confirming them by prodigies and speaking of things naturall humaine and base aboue all common capacitie of men and penetrating into most deepe secrets by illumination of the holy spirit do with most bright cleerenes manifest them

to all those which haue eies to see and eares to heare
and therefore eusebius hath excellently written to this purpose

speaking thus you shall finde out the errors of the ethnick philosophers not by me but by the contradiction and meruellous repugnancie among themselues and when compare them among themselues or with other common men certainly cannot denie but they haue beene woorthie personages but when conferre them with the philosophers and theologians of the hebrewes and compare their doctrine with the doctrine of those friuolous and vaine do all their inuentions seeme to mee
moreouer know we not that by the one all things haue beene deliuered humanely and by the others diuinely and that those who woulde taste of the first draughts of wisedome haue beene constrained to learne of the hebrewes and therefore porphirius in his booke of abstinence adorneth with sundrie praises the religious or prophets among that people calling them philosophers and assigning them the chiefest degree aboue all other prophets and magi who haue made profession of holines
and orpheus in his booke which he hath written of the holy word after he chased away all contemners of the diuine ordinances and mysteries confesseth that he learned out of the tables of moses that which he song of god knowne onely but to his prophet
but aboue all the foresaide testimonies

woorthie to bee beleeued to them that which surpasseth all admiration the doctrine of the celestiall and diuine messenger iesus christ the true messias annointed with diuine graces aboue anie other prophet doth accord
who allowing and approouing the doctrine of moses openeth and reuealeth many secrets which he receiued of god his father and announceth the perfection of true religion wherewith his apostles haue so filled the whole worlde that euen to this day all the wise men in euerie part of the world do embrace and reuerence so excellent doctrine as that wherein shineth so much diuinity and celestiall brightnes that without comparison it surpasseth all humane doctrine
let vs receiue it then euen all of vs that desire wisedome bicause that neuer any more excellent did euer yet appeere to mortall men neither shall euer appeere heereafter
and let vs not make a staie in that that socrates knoweth some thing or that anaxagoras seeth the light in darknes or that democritus draweth vertue out of pits or that empedocles enlargeth the path of his spirit

or that archesilas and carneades attaine to some newe kinde of knowledge or that aristotle prooueth that which flieth from sence
but let vs giue full faith to the authoritie of so many irreprochable witnesses who make the generation of the world vndoubtable to vs and let vs proceed to the reasons which further confirme it vnto vs and which achitob we desire to heare of you

of the reasons making for the creation and newnes of the world
chapter

achitob

amongst those other arguments which we haue heard some philosophers obiect against the creation of the world one hath bin the disconueniencie of the newnes thereof with eternall god not being able to perceiue how and which way it might come to passe for by reason of the consideration of such a like question to wit which of the egge or of the birde was first engendred seeing that the egge without the birde nor the bird without the egge could not subsist they haue imagined that this world was eternall and that the beginning of euerie thing engendred was the ende likewise thereof through a perpetuall course and proceeding
but let me aske these doctors

whence commeth this newnes which we behold euerie day in all things of this world for there is nothing which suffreth not vicissitude and chaunging
auerrois saith that this proceedeth from new reuolutions which notwithstanding are auncient by an euerlasting succession and that there is the stay where the oldnes and newnes is conserued
for which cause also some haue affirmed that heauen is some part new some part old
but for as much as these philosophers do teach that reuolutions are made by those disposing spirits which are called the seruants of the creator or of the first moouer doth it not thereupon follow that there is no stay in the heauens but that they mooue anew to accomplish that which the first moouer doth propose in a certaine time to be performed and who remayning stable doth giue motion to all the rest wherefore we may say that the beginning of newnes cannot bee from heauen nor through the spirits but by the first moouer who at his good pleasure commandeth

and all things are made and afterwards renued by a secret order within himselfe not constrayned by any necessitie
for so it is that god proceedeth to his worke and so prosecuteth it without being otherwise bound to base things which aristotle himselfe accordeth to when he declareth that he is blessed without any good that is strange or not of himselfe
and farther would willingly know with what kinde of measure they would meate out the vniuers who beare such fauour to the eternitie of the world if by time it be measured then is not eternall for those reasons which we haue deliuered heretofore in the discourse concerning the time of the creation
if by eternitie it selfe then let them remember that that is a possession altogither separated from time and from motion as hath beene to vs sufficiently declared
how then can this world be eternall which is equall in age to time and altogither subiect to motion

but if any one yet would hold that it is eternal let him tell me whether it endureth by the selfe same eternitie which is in the blessed god or by some other if it be by another sort of eternitie then should there be diuers eternities of gouernours and of kindes which should sauour of the nature of the infinite and also many infinitenesses should be contained in this world which is so small
if they will say that the world subsisteth of the same eternitie by which god is certainely such are not worthie of any answere but rather to be mocked at who thinke the spheres and their mouers to be measured with god for eternal enduring differeth not from god
but that which is changeable according to nature and operation cannot be measured with the same compasse as he who is altogether vnchangeable
they will tell me that the eternitie of the world differeth from that of the first agent because the one being altogither diuine is a possession at once altogether and the other is successiue
but answere them that if it be successiue it hath certaine portions now such portions cannot be infinite and therefore such eternitie hath a beginning and successiue ending
now if it be limited and bounded with these termes how can it be that it may agree with the eternall who is not closed or limited by any ending besides by what reason may this be called eternall to which alwaies something is added by a continuall succession for one can adde nothing to the infinite neither doth it encrease at all
and therefore aske them againe that if their eternitie subsisteth what do

become of the new reuolutions shall we say they are conioyned with the former or else that they begin a new infinitenesse if they graunt the first then will they be more in number then infinite
auerrois saith that this is no more disagreeable to successions then to numbers that infinite tens be infinitely repeated which amount to so much as innumerable hundreths without making any more encrease in one part then in another
but good god who can heare these things with a quiet eare by an impossible supposition which he deuiseth in numbers and which neuer commeth to passe he would resolue the inconueniences which depe~d vpon infinit reuolutions which he saith did precede al eternity
and for the other point to thinke that the new reuolutions should begin a new infinitenes we haue already answered that saying that many infinitenesses cannot be imagined in this world
but here leauing the successions numbers would farther request these defe~ders of the eternity of this round frame to tell me whether the moouing spirits knowe the reuolutions or not if they know them not certainly men doe them much iniurie to thinke that they are ignorant in their motions which many astronomers know
if they know them all being infinite how is it that by a finite vnderstanding which is in all creatures they may comprehend things that are infinite

againe sith that generation is bounded and limited by the vndiuidable and the last generation of any creature whatsoeuer by the last creature what generation shall we say to be limited to the first if they say there is no former how is it then that there can be a latter woonder also at those ancient sages of the world and the moderne likewise which follow them when they declare all things to be mooued and ordained in god as in the last wished and desired end and yet doubt to confesse that he is the ordainer considering also that they call him the first moouer
but if he hath ordained all things

it followeth likewise that he must know them
for concerning that which some inferre that god hath onely disposed the vppermost and highest things and that the second causes engender the lowest demaund of them how it is that those here belowe are correspondent to those which are most high considering there are diuers ordainers doth not aristotle say that there is but one onely prince for feare least things should be euilly disposed and gouerned againe if all things depend of a desired and finishing cause so that in fauour thereof they become great

how is it that they haue a being of themselues seeing they seeke to be perfect in another why haue those any need of a preseruer which haue no need of a creator indeed the son is preserued without the father but without him he is not engendred
for what occasion then doe these philosophers giue a keeper to the members of the vniuers and do take cleane away from it anie parents what lies doe they bring vnto vs that accuse others to be sellers of lies for in one place they misconster and denie that which in another place the truth constraineth them to confesse
auerrois in many places of his writings

denieth that god created the world and yet interpreting the treatise of heauen he calleth him creator
so likewise aristotle proceeding by sensible things mocketh at plato that at euery word confesseth the world to be created and in the booke which he entituleth of the world hee auoucheth god to bee creator of the vniuers
and in his metaphysicks he teacheth that hee is prince of the world
and how is it that the prince is entred into an house which he neither hath builded nor obtained by right of inheritance nor bought with any summe of money this is as he affirmeth that the supreme thought vnderstandeth not the particular matters for feare least he should or else weare himselfe
and yet in the treatise of good and bad fortune he often repeateth that he hath excellent good fortune that is guided by god
but how doth he guide and direct that which he vnderstandeth not and how doth he render condigne recompense and reward for things well or ill done as it is saide in the same treatise if hee doth not consider and examine the workes of euery one againe we read in the meteors that god hath placed the pure fire vnder the globe of the moone and yet how hath he disposed and ordained that which he neither made nor hath knowledge of surely it woulde be a tedious matter to bring out all the contrarieties and repugnances of the writings of philosophers which do plainly confound themselues
but out of much haue selected this little to the end that those who boast rather of the name of peripateticks or auerroists then of good theologians and christians may behold that all their teachings are not solid nor firme
let vs insert among our reasons which confound their doctrine the iudgement of saint augustine of macrobius and of many other learned men who hold that the eternitie of the world cannot subsist and haue place with so small memorie of

things done as we haue in our histories as well holy as prophane neither yet with the inuention of arts and many other things celebrated by eusebius pamphilus clemens alexandrinus berosus the chaldee aristotle auerrois theophrastus epigenes critodemus philostophanes egesius archimachus damasthenes aulus gellius and a great number of others of diuers languages and most plentifully by pliny in his booke of the naturall historie where he confesseth to haue collected part of his writings out of the said authors

with whom also in that which they testifie of the inuention of things the holy letters are of great authoritie in that they do agree with them herein in many points
for although there be some difference concerning the names of those which haue inuented them as the forenamed authors do not alwaies agree among themselues yet the inuention found in time is wholy confirmed by the same reason and all that which disagreeth is come either by reason of the languages not being alike or bicause that historiographers cheefely the greekes haue attributed that to their nation which properly appertained not to them
now if the world had beene from the beginning yea euen before the beginning as many would haue it why then in the successiue course of innumerable ages was not that policie and kinde of liuing inuented which we vse at this present why not the vse of letters by which onely memorie is made eternall why not the experience of many things for none of all this is found to be but within and since fiue thousand fiue hundred yeeres so long as the scripture teacheth vs that the world hath beene created being from the creation thereof to the natiuitie of iesus christ according to the common computation three thousand nine hundred sixtie seuen yeeres what did the inhabitants of the world before this time so briefe and short being compared with eternitie to which the histories do refer the inuentors vse of all things liued men then without policie and without lawes without bread without wine without tillage of the earth were they without the exercise of merchandise without the studie of good letters of discipline of warfare of nauigation of building of weauing of sowing of dressing wooll all which things haue their inuention famous but within a few yeeres and in diuers seasons wherewith liued they before where dwelt they how were they clothed what did they being altogither ignorant of artes certainely it is

meere mockerie that those who teach that the world is eternall do themselues assigne the inuentors of lawes of arts and of mens liuing considering that both the one and the other coulde not consist both at one instant
behold companions that which seemed good to me to note concerning the reasons making for the creation the historie whereof will put vs altogither out of doubt in that which toucheth the principall arguments of the philosophers against it if wee doe amplie entreate of their errors when they maintaine that god worketh of necessitie and not of free and franke will which will serue vs to morrow for a subiect to begin the daies discourse

the end of the first daies worke

the second daies worke
concerning the errors of these philosophers which say that god doth his outward worke of necessitie
chapter

aser

thinke companions we were yesterday sufficiently entangled in the discourse of the creation of the world about that which concerneth the doubt that remaineth in many
but ere we doe farther enter into the cabinets of god and nature it would not be vnfruitefull if wee yet haue an other pull with the philosophers about this question whether of necessity or of free choise and franke will god was prouoked to worke for they supposed that the condition of necessitie was fitter and more conuenient then was the matter of contingence and therefore they appropriate it to god
wherein they

thinke verily to want no reasons for their purpose and that these make specially for them that god worketh by his proper substance

and not by any borrowed vertue that the effectes of the world are of necessity because they seeme in no wise to proceed of a contingent cause that by the same reason is to be considered the inuariable and necessarie order of thinges to the end that the vniuers be not confounded or troubled moreouer the philosophers supposed that it was a very vnfit thing for the diuine vnderstanding to worke of necessity and the diuine will to worke freely considering that it is no lesse perfect then the diuine thought
now though that we concerning these considerations night take out of the quiuer of reasonable discourse arrowes enow against these sages of the world yet for that this point doth particularly touch the diuinity it may suffice to say with plato that one cannot picke out so great a mysterie by reasons but seeke to learne the same by oracles
for it is sufficient to know that the great lawgiuer recordeth that god spake

and it was done and that with him agreeth the kingly prophet saying he commaunded and it was established to conclude that all the scriptures teache vs the same doctrine

but here let vs declare that that which seemeth thus to disturbe the philosophers is nothing at all for they presuppose a necessarie disposition to bee more perfect then the contingent cause which they haue left to prooue to those that should come afterwards
now beseech you do we not more esteeme a prince who directeth euerie thing according to his owne good pleasure then if vrged by nature or any other prouocation constrayning him he should set his hand to any busines who will blame libertie which as the prouerbe saith is hardly bought for gold that say which they themselues thinke to haue beene graunted man for a most singular good what perfection what praise should be attributed to most loftie thoughts if they were euer forced to performe that which is good

what dignitie might appertaine to a great king if he did all things necessitie constrayning him and nothing of a generous heart and seeing by common consent we acknowledge god to be the prince of the world what glorie and honor should be giuen him for his gouernment for his wisedome for his iustice for his clemencie if of necessity and constraint he were drawne on to maintaine that which is in his tuition what grace what seruice and adoration

should we owe him why is it entred into nature to sacrifice as aristotle saith why are we obliged as auerrois himselfe teacheth to magnifie god the creator in prayers and sacrifices if god doth all things of necessitie what profiteth all this for what cause is it conuenient for vs to pray

if god be not appeased by prayer to what ende hath all mankinde in euerie age in all places of euery nation beene addicted to adore a diuinity surely we may thereof gather that prayers are fit for men and that it is naturally grafted in our minds that god is mooued by them
so manie reasons then may well conclude that the author of nature doth neuer negotiate of necessitie
and for that that he worketh by a proper substance that is not of eternitie except in the spiritual worke from himselfe wherof we haue spoken in the
of our discourse
but for the outward worke he proceeded thereto according to his owne will when it pleased him not constrayned by any causes for hee is the onely and principall cause of all things nor for hope to get any good for that he of himselfe is blessed not hauing neede of any other good

furthermore also the necessarie effects conclude not any necessitie in the prince or in the first cause considering that the second causes which plato and the other sages call his seruants doe worke by his commaundement in determined order so that the necessitie that therein is dependeth vpon his commaundement or vpon the order from which he absolueth them according to his owne good pleasure

and thereof came it that the fire burned not the children in the chaldean furnace that the sunne stayed his course by the space of a day at iosuahs commandement that it went backe ten lines or ten howres

in the time of ezechias that it was eclipsed at full moone during the passion of iesus christ
the peripatetickes atheists and epicures will laugh at this and will say scoffingly which of the philosophers recounteth these things these sellers of lyes which teach the lawes are madde saith auerrois
but herein sith question is made concerning diuine mysteries what haue wee to doe with such contemners of all pietie the sentence wherein we make stay hath beene celebrated by those which could iudge
and men doe rather beleeue one that affirmeth then a thousand that denie for negation concludeth nothing
and why should we care then though they denie altogither in words that which many witnesses yea and most wise do assure to haue prooued in effect

the holy letters testifie it whereto we rather giue credit then to aristotle and all his schollers
and amongst a thousand most famous philosophers and christian martyrs which consent to this doctrine of truth

is saint denis areopagita so called of the areopagus or streete of mars which was a court and assembly among the athenians first of nine persons elected by the chiefe magistrates and afterward encreased to the number of fiftie of the most principall as well for learning holines of life and wisedome as also for riches to the ende that pouertie might not induce them to corruption as androtion in the second and philocorus in the third booke of the athenian affaires do write
this man then writing to polycarpus reprehendeth apollophanes the sophister in these very words because he would not admit of the eclipse of the sun which came to passe at the death of the messias know not with what spirit thou wert led to diuine

apollophanes when with me conte~plating the eclipse which was against the order of nature at the time that christ suffered turning thy selfe towardes me thou saidst noble denis these are the changes which come to passe somtime in diuine things if thou ca~st conuince this of vntruth
for was prese~t with thee in co~sideration of so great a prodigy with thee beheld it iudged of it thought it worthie of perpetual admiration
but if any will not yet beleeue this most entire philosopher let him harken to that which the astronomers say
esculus very skilfull and learned in this science taught by astronomicall numbers that the sunne went vnder

aries and the moone vnder

libra when the sunne failed at ful moone and at that time the iewes according to their custome celebrated the feast of passeouer
moreouer phlegron one most excelle~t in reckoning the olympiads in his thirteenth booke testifieth that in the fourth yeere of the two hundred and second olympiad there was an eclipse of the sunne much greater then all those that had euer before hapned at which time was the passion of iesus christ

and for the going backe of the sunne in ezechias reigne as also that which we reade of the deluge of waters with many other miracles contained in holy writ the auncient memorials of the persians and chaldeans do make notable mention thereof
and thence co~meth it that the persian priestes do celebrate the memorie of the triple mithras that is of the sunne as denis and strabo witnes which at the foresaid time appeared to performe a triple course or to stay three times from

his accustomed progresse into the west retyring againe into the east by a new kinde of returne for ten howers and then returning againe into the west
leaue for this point the other witnesses philosophers gentiles chaldees egyptians phenicians greekes the sibilles and many historians brought for proofe of the supernaturall effectes of omnipotent god by iosephus aristobulus tertullian and eusebius whereof each by their writings may sufficiently instruct
and if authoritie doe ought auaile in disputation let then the deposition of so many sages preuaile in this point in a matter that aristotle his fautors denie in words onely
most prudently certaine doth auicen thinke that motion is neither necessarie nor violent but in a meane betwixt both in such sort that it euer resteth at the pleasure of the prince
and therefore it must be graunted that the second causes are so alligated to the first cause that they doe nothing but as the other commaunds them
and yet it so gouerneth those things which it hath created and ordayned that it permitteth them to performe their ordinarie proper motions
now because that it seldome hapneth to the contrary and that the order of their first institution perseuereth in many things and that most commonly therefore did aristotle iudge that it was naturall and necessarie
for as he saith in his treatise of naturall hearing that is naturall which commeth to manie and oftentimes and so could he make no farther search by sensible things
but the operations of god

and the alliance of things here below with the first cause may not be searched out by discourse of reasons but must rather as we haue declared be learnt of oracles
thus is conuinced of nullitie the progresse which is deduced from necessitie appearing in the effects to the necessitie of the cause because that necessitie of the effects dependeth vpon the order established by the first cause
and the effects also are not needefull because they are all particular for the worke of nature is not bounded by the vniuersall all but by each particular which the peripateticks themselues do rather nominate contingence then necessarie
but because the most subtile philosophers do yet debate that they be eternall and that most needefull is the coherence of the subiect with the worker in which the proper essentiall or the quidditie as they terme it is named of the subiect we may re~der them an other reason for this pretended necessity to wit the correspondence of things with the exemplaries or eternall ideas celebrated

by plato and defended by many sage and great personages

as hath alreadie beene showen
for this cannot consist considering that the vniuersall is a simple essence which produceth nothing by the second causes nor by the spirits nor by nature but only by himselfe and also the first cause of all things created before euer any soule or any heauen or any other particular thing whatsoeuer was produced
to returne therefore from whence we strayed the effect ensueth the ordinance immutable order of the supreme cause if by the same it be not otherwise instituted
and whereas the philosophers adde farther that the will of god hath equall perfection with the thought which operateth of necessitie we confesse that it taketh place but it is in regard of the worke within himselfe wherby he enge~dreth eternally the perfect image of himselfe his word the absolute idea and true patterne of all things
but we say that he displayeth according to his good pleasure the outward effects that from euerlasting the diuine thought hath described in the word
surely woonder at the sages of the world who acknowledge that god is most simple and of himselfe most perfect all other strange thing set apart and yet presently as if they had forgot their doctrine thinke that god hath a needfull bond with things heere below as if he could not subsist without them nor yet be blessed
and how is he most simple if he hath a necessary bond with other things how is he prince of all things if he be obliged to the seruice of the most basest what dignitie or what condition hath he of a soueraigne gouernour briefly to conclude this matter let vs take away all necessitie from the lord in regard of this round frame and let vs not doubt that the order of this vniuers shall decay or be destroyed if it be so that the creator doth dispose and varie it at his good pleasure for he doth know how euer to direct in order that which he hath once made and ordayned
for none neede to feare the spoile of the worke when the sets hand thereto by whose handling it is rather made perfect then any whit marred
but yet before we take any other subiect we must first heare of amana the reasons which declare that god proceeded of to his worke

of the reasons which conclude that god proceeded of free and franke deliberation to the worke of the world
chap

amana

although that by our precedent discourse we may easily iudge such as maintaine that god of eternitie did by necessitie his outward work woorthie rather to be despised then refuted being against the doctrine of diuine oracles yet we will run ouer a few points by which they themselues shall be pearsed with their owne dartes
would therefore first desire them to tell me from whence come the monsters in nature they may say that this proceedeth either by defect or of matter or else bicause that the qualities answere not in due proportion or through corruption of the containing part and such other considerations which are subdiuided by phisitions into their species
but let me aske them if that the naturall causes worke necessarily why doe they not performe euery thing duly seeing nature as they say wanteth nothing in necessarie things how then doe naturall causes worke of necessitie when they faile they may answere that would thereupon conclude that they worke by contingence which if saide what might follow thereon but to leaue all superfluous debate let them remember that it is an olde sentence vsed in schooles that a thing is said to be necessarie in two sorts the one absolutely necessarie and the other conditionally necessarie
wherefore we attribute the first to god alone

and the other to his creatures so as we call them necessary according to the order appointed by the supreme creator
which if the philosophers denie we will vrge them with the worke it selfe of these causes
for it is certaine that if they be faultie and produce monsters it commeth to passe because that order which is deliuered them by nature as they say or rather of the soueraigne creator as truth is doth faile them
now if they faile of the order it then followeth that it was not simply necessarie for them but giuen by the first cause through vertue whereof the rest subordained vnder it do worke from which if the first withdraw it selfe they do not onely faile but become nothing at all
and if

they may seeme to performe any thing of necessitie this commeth vnto them by reason of the law which hath beene giuen them by the prince of nature who giuing lawes to others is no whit for that therto himselfe obliged
they may reply that if our doctrine might stand there should be no certaintie of science considering that it should consist of things which otherwise might be whereto aristotle doth make deniall
but we answere that if he intendeth that those things which are knowne should be necessarie according to the order of the vniuers the like may ensue in those things which may happen contrarie to the order according to the disposition of the eternall will
now if they finde too great difficultie herein for their capacitie what neede wee care let themselues if they thinke good vnloose the knot
for fire may well be without burning

as indeed it hath beene as we haue heard in the former speech
and likewise euerie effect may be separated from the cause which hath produced it yet neuerthelesse the bond remayning by a certaine correspondencie betweene the worker and the subiect that we may vse schoole termes
but proceeding farther would faine learne of these peripatetickes whence it is that things haue a necessarie couenant
they will say that it is by nature as they prooue by experience

but what is this their nature nothing truely but the author of the vniuers which is the true spirit not erring seeing that as they teach the worke of nature is the worke of the intelligence not erring and by the ordinance whereof all things haue a due course
for there is nothing but serueth this supreme worker
he stretcheth out saith the prophet the heauens like a curtaine

he looketh on the earth and it trembleth he toucheth the mountaines and they smoke
but these naturalists may say what haue we to doe with prophets seeing we hold that none can haue perfect knowledge but in those things which are prooued by demonstration and from whence fetcheth demonstration his originall is it not from those principles whose termes being knowne we accord to them or prooue them by experience now if we beleeue demonstrations by principles and experiences it then followeth that there be some things more certaine then demonstrations
oh execrable vice growne olde amongst our people that hauing had this happines to be enrolled in the number of christians

yet receiue nothing for truth and certaintie if it be not prooued by such demonstrations as aristotle hath

declared and wherewith for all that he is but little aided in his discourse concerning nature
for herein he proceedeth alwaies by those maximes that he taketh to be confessed so that the demonstration whereto his disciples giue beleefe is nothing else but a consequence drawne from the place of authoritie or from the foundations by him supposed
wherefore let vs rather beleeue the holy scripture which instructeth vs that many things and especially diuine are knowne through the beames of supernaturall illumination and by the couenant of the holy word with our vndersta~ding touched by the truth
let epicures atheists then maintaine how they list from aristotle that to knowe

is to vnderstand by demonstration
for vs it is sufficient to hold our instructions from the prophets taught by the diuine oracle who by miracles and prodigies and great sacraments approoue as we haue already heard that which they teach
and if we say that knowledge is an vnderstanding by any thing we may take our selues to be wise in beleeuing the doctrine of the holy ghost not any whit accounting of the peripateticks who haue only kindled the light of their contemplation by the moouing formes of the vniuers and haue not been able with a pure cogitation to contemplate him who possesseth the highest degree of dignitie amongst all essences as their soueraigne prince and gouernour hauing in the rest rather giuen an artificiall finenesse and base manner of proceeding then any science
and this is that which priuily their master confesseth when he entreateth of the last analyticks or resolutions saying that science is of demonstration and demonstration of the quiddities as he nameth it and by the proper differences of things to vs vnknowne
for thereupon it followeth that the principles of demonstration are vnknowne and that from them one may bring no whit or very little demonstration
but resuming our principall point of the free

and franke will of god in his worke begun in time we will argue more liuely thus
seeing that the partes of this vniuers are so disposed that without any contrarietie or contradiction they might haue been otherwise ordered it followeth that they are contingent and not ordained of necessitie but of free will
auerrois saith we confesse not that the partes of the world could be altered bicause the world is an animal
but answere in what place of aristotle learnt he this manner of disputing he will that his authoritie should be for a principle of demonstration

moreouer from whence draweth he the consequence let him tell me if the world be an animal whether is it sensible or insensible if it be void of sense then is it no animal
if it be sensitiue doth it see then doth it heare doth it smell doth it taste doth it eate

but say we confesse the world to be an animal as it seemeth that plato and many other sages would affirme surely it is no animal contained vnder the kinde of animals
for all things in this frame are diuided by all philosophers into a former diuision before you come to the animal
but let vs confesse that it may be called an animal by some kinde of answerablenes and likenes wherefore then could not the disposition of the partes thereof be otherwise ordained why should it be disagreeable for man to haue onely one eie in his forehead as it is reported of some why could it not be made to the other creatures the vpper iaw moouing and the vndermost firme as the crocodile alone hath why haue not sundry beasts two knees like the camell surely these and such like things haue been so disposed by the soueraigne creator that without any contradiction or contrarietie might haue been otherwise ordained if we presuppose not the condition of the nature specified such as the creator himselfe hath according to his will prefixed
but let vs farther proceede concerning the animall the world

by what necessitie hath the sea bin in such sort disposed that the ocean should passe through the narrow straights of abyla calpe high mountaines which antiquitie called what neede is there that from thence it should spread it selfe in length and bredth that then it should stretch it selfe into the tuscan or tirrhene sea afterward gathering it selfe into the adriaticke gulph then enlarging it selfe into the siriacke sea so running about by the egean which for the beautious number of isles therein contained is named the or princesse of seas and from thence shrinking betweene most narrow passages the helespont is made and againe the propontick where it dilateth it selfe and where againe it is straightened is called the thracian bosphorus then this ocean being once againe widened there is made the sea euxine that is to say the host since the manners of the barbarous nations haue been polished and made ciuill for it was first called axenes that is the inhumane host bicause of the cruell and fierce nature of the dwellers thereabout and againe mixing it selfe with the lake of meotis it is named the cimmerian

bosphorus what neede is there also why nilus passing by the ethiopians and arabians into egypt and tanais passing through the one and other scythia

and running almost into the midst of the lake of meotis should distinguish and separate the three partes of the world and by what other needfull ordinance is one part of the earth laid lowe in vallies another stretched out into plaines this part raised vp in billocks that lifted vp in loftie mountaines and that the flouds and fountaines and streames doe flowe in their seasons of what necessitie also are some beasts of the earth fruitfull others barren these drie and those moist might not we easily without any contrarietie or repugnancie imagine all the circuit of the earth to be plaine soft and bearing fruit and if god can performe that which we cannot thinke as all the sages who haue beleeued in him doe affirme why can he not doe that which we may imagine which if he can easily performe these things then are not of necessitie no otherwise then of eternitie disposed in such sort as we see them but according and how and when it hath pleased the soueraigne creator of them
now ynough is saide of these things we must farther proceed in the consideration of gods works wherein will greatly aide vs the vnderstanding of one onely principall and prime cause of the vniuers that we may afterwards comprehend the maruellous effects thereof
and herein aram let be the subiect of thy discourse

of one onely principall and first cause of the vniuers
chapter

aram

those who haue bin commonly called the sages of the world haue so much differed in their doctrine euen in the search which they haue made of nature following the course of their speculations that amo~gst them who haue bin nourished in one family learned vnder one master there are great contrarieties either in doctrine in manners in religion or in the end to which all these things tende
which is chiefly hapned vnto them by hauing setled the building of the world vpon badde and discordant foundations affying in their owne powers and inuentions too feeble for so waighty a charge as by rehearsing some points of their principles we may easilie

vnderstand

thales milesius supposed that the water was the beginning of all things bicause all the members of euery liuing creature seemed to be nourished by water which as it is placed in the middle of the world so doth the watrie humour abide in the center of the bodies of animals from whence it ministreth nourishment to all the rest of the members
but his auditor anaximander was of aduise that wot not what infinitenes called the boundlesse matter was the principall subiect and first of essences and bicause that by nature such matter hath neither forme nor quantitie hee thought that this was the substance of perpetuall generation in such sort that infinite worlds were already past and heereafter infinitely to arise
anaximenes his disciple attributed the causes of all things to the infinite aire
and his hearers anaxagoras and diogenes disagreeing togither one of them woulde perswade that the infinite matter wouen with diuers parcels of all sorts and kinds according to the condition thereof had beene beginning to it selfe and the other that the aire indued also with diuine reason was the matter of things
leucippus democritus and diodorus affirme that before all things there were certaine atomoes or little indiuidable bodies some smooth others sharpe some round others partly made of angles partly turned and pointed and some crooked to be perceiued by reason onely solide without any vacuitie not ingendred immortall eternall incorruptible which mooue them in an infinitenes and through an infinitenes that is emptines which bodies are in number infinite with these two qualities forme and greatnes and that by a chance of aduenture without constraint of any nature heauen and earth of them were composed
hipparchus metapontine and heraclitus the ephesian said that fire was the vnick beginning bicause it is the subtile maintainer and sustainer of all bodies and whereof at first the heauens were made
and bicause it is a brightnes that mooueth all things by his light they teach that in abasing it selfe it was mixed with all things in such sort that all things were thereof engendred by the meanes of discord and loue
empedocles for feare of failing said that all the fower elements had beene the onely beginning but that the earth was the matter and first subiect of all containing the formes and figures of things which neither the water aire nor fire could doe
the poets following his opinion attributed the originall of things to etherian iupiter

terrene pluto aërian iuno and to mestis the beginning of the water who they said nourished with her teares the riuers of the earth
pythagoras mounting higher then many deeme esteemed that numbers and their subiect that is the measures and apt proportions called harmonies and consonancies were the originall of things not those numbers which marchants vse but the formall and naturall the knowledge of which lies onely hidden in such as haue learned philosophie and theologie by numbers
almeon followeth pythagoras saying that the vnity was the effectiue beginning but the two or binarie not finite was the subiect and materiall beginning of all multitude
epicurus in his philosophie pursuing the steps of democritus teacheth the beginnings of things to be corporal solide not created perceiued by vnderstanding onely eternall that coulde not be corrupted nor destroied nor changed in any sort
to which prime causes beside the forme and greatnes which his master assigned them he also attributeth waight
socrates and plato set three principals god the matter and the idea
aristotle affirmed for the first entelechie or the kinde the matter and priuation although he had otherwhere taught the equiuocations as is priuation not to be numbred among the principles
zenon appointeth for the first god and the matter so that he is the actiue and it the passiue the fower elements meanes betweene
but on this point wee may note that amongst all those which haue taught that the matter was the principall subiect we haue one alone who telleth vs whether it hath beene created by the blessed god or whether this nature pliable and depriued of all beawty togither with god hath made the world or else if voide of all fashion it hath beene coeternall wife and companion of demogorgon father of the gods as poets faine or if like a pallas it hath beene borne of iupiters braine
certainly our minde can finde no repose when we finde a nature depriued of all power and all forme without the maker and creator thereof
now who or what he hath beene we haue none of these philosophers that can relate vnto vs very well see we that they agree very ill togither in the doctrine of the principles and foundations of the world which doubtlesse hapned vnto them bicause they did straie very farre off from the vnity master of all veritie in whom they shoulde all haue met and yet euery one went a seuerall way following the inuentions of their naturall speculations

temerariously presuming by their owne proper powers to manifest that which god would rather haue kept close and hidden to wit the nature of celestiall things
and thence commeth it that their teachings founded on the confused multitude were dissolued and vanished after say that they were so seuered from the vnitie which giueth to all essences the power to be and harmoniously to accord

but they who confesse one god creator of all things and acknowledge him for the true source and fountaine from which all the waters of eternall sapience do flowe all vnited in profession of pietie religion and doctrine hebrewes chaldees greekes and latins doe all togither giue praise to this god alone father of the vniuers planting the foundations of this mundaine habitation with an harmonious concord
for moses iob dauid salomon esay and all the other prophets euangelists apostles and disciples of iesus christ and all those whom he hath made woorthie to entreat of diuine mysteries all with one voice do teach vs one onely and prime cause of all formes and that alone to be the maker of the matter and moderatresse of all nature
to which doctrine agree all the ancient and moderne doctors of the christian church hauing the rule of holie letters so fixed and bounded that they doe not crosse themselues in any point bicause they haue setled the foundations of all things in the onely and true author of all wisedome
and vpon the same principles innumerable persons of great erudition and laudable life diuersly dispersed into contrary climates according to the course of times and different languages haue enterprised diuers works of a diuine consonancie and all to one end to cause acknowledgement of god creator of heauen and earth
which coulde in no wise haue beene done if all these excellent men had not beene illuminated with one diuine vnderstanding as the platonists call it or with one holie spirite as our doctors teach which maketh all such as dwell in the house of god to be of one minde and indueth all of them with one hart and one soule and therefore also all the ancient prophets blessed ambassadors of iesus christ being replenished with this spirit despising the vaine babble of philosophers schooles and all contentious disputations haue proposed their teachings with such and so great constancie though they had to deale with princes and people learned and vnlearned that they

haue confirmed them for truth by sanctitie and splendor of life and by many myracles yea with their owne bloud
and our doctors imitating this doctrine lightned and illustrated with the same spirite haue acknowledged god the onely and very beginning of all things the free creator and supreme fountaine from whom all veritie and vertue floweth
amongst which doctors fowre greekes and fowre latins shall sing in the little quire of god like the bases and fundaments of our theologie according with the fowre disciples of our lord who deliuered the euangelicall elements in canticles sweetely distinguished and yet in agreeable consonancie

for saint hierome and saint chrysostome shall vnloose the knottie heads of the holie letters the one and the other gregory to wit the romaine and nazianzene shall pursue the diuine sense closed and couered vnder the barke of the letter
damascenus with saint ambrose shall remaine in the graue sentences and allegoricall sense
and saint augustine with basil shall mount vp in the anagogicall song to resound the supreme accents of the celestiall harmony
and for the other celebrated persons who preceded these men till the time of saint hierome he in the booke of excellent men numbreth an hundreth thirtie seuen who were knowne by their writings
to whom gennade minister of marseilles addeth ninetie and one who haue beene followed of many others till the time of peter the lombard who emulating damascene in reducing and distinguishing into fowre volumes the theologicall doctrine hath giuen faire matter for posteritie to dispute vpon
and since then haue encreased so many others of diuers professions nations and languages consenting with an admirable concord in confession of one father author and principle without any meanes of this vniuers that this point leaueth no doubt but constraineth euerie one to acknowledge that all of them haue beene illuminated and taught by the soueraigne doctor and supreme brightnes from which all truth and light doth issue
for likewise he alone the eternall god containeth the source of veritie vnable to be emptied out of which it behooueth vs to exhaust so many and often times as we pretend to giue true instructions and agreeable to the mysteries of his omnipotencie bicause there is no knowledge of the separated substances of the secrets of nature and of god the author thereof which hath not beene diuinely reuealed
for diuine things are not touched

with our hands and the worldly flie from our senses euery moment
from whence it commeth that that which philosophers call wisedome and certaine science whether concerning celestiall or natural things is nothing else but error or at least a thicke obscuritie
but we know so much as the pure bright and cleere vnderstanding placed in the point of mans soule doth behold by meanes of supernaturall light in the mirror of eternitie wherein we contemplate god the father and creator of this vniuers
and when the philosophers shall confesse him such as nature teacheth religion perswadeth and reason prooueth him then may they concurre with the truth in that which they declare of the elements of the world fire aire water and earth and of the nature of things as heereafter we must discourse
but first we will begin to enter into some consideration of the precious treasures and learned instructions wherewith the sacred words of moses by vs heeretofore heard concerning the creation are fruitfully replenished namely in the space of the sixe daies which he describeth for perfection of this great humaine building as referre to you achitob to giue vs to vnderstand

of the space of the sixe daies mentioned in the historie of the creation of the world
chap

achitob

if we hold for certaine and vndoubted the fabrication of the vniuers as we haue in all our precedent discourse sufficiently prooued then must we confesse that it is new and made in time according as holy writ teacheth vs and all mathematicians confirme when by the genesis of the world they prognosticate the euents that should succeede
we haue already made mention of the time since which we hold the creation thereof now must we consider the space of daies which are mentioned by moses in recitation of this of worke of the almightie wherein the prophet hath concealed a mysterie of high and difficult vnderstanding
for as saint augustine saith

the sixe daies wherein god performed his works and the seuenth wherein hee ceased in what sort and manner they are is very difficult or rather impossible for vs to thinke

much more to expresse
for the daies which we haue now haue their euening and morning the setting and rising of the sunne and the three first daies whereof moses speaketh passed without the sunne which was created the fourth day
heereof therefore grow profound and deepe questions and principally this whether all things haue been created togither or in the space of diuers daies

it seemeth that saint augustine made no doubt that all was not created in a moment seeing he saith speaking of the creation of the angels made the first day that the second day nor the third nor all the rest were any other then the first day but that the same one was repeated to make vp the number of six or seuen for the works of god and his repose

in another place he speaketh thus in the seuenth day that is the same day repeated seuen times
there haue been also diuers ancient doctors that haue taught the like satisfying themselues with this text of the wiseman saying he that liueth for euer

made all things togither
they also shewed these reasons all power finite and limited hath neede of time to worke in but not the infinite as that of the soueraigne creator and forasmuch as by an intelligible and eternall word which saint basil interpreteth the moment of the will of god all things had their beginning there is no reason why there should be any delay for the creation of the light after the darknes which was vpon the deepe as the prophet declareth and whereof the euening and morning of the first day were made or else of the heauen till the second day

the budding foorth of the earth till the third the production of the sunne moone and stars till the fourth the gathering togither of the waters till the fift and to the sixt the forming of man
for these reasons say many great personages would conclude that heauen and earth and all things therein contained were created at one instant charging those which thought otherwise to doe great wrong to the almightie and soueraigne creator to whom all things are of eternitie presented to suppose that he should operate by tract of time and succession of daies he say to whom eternity is both the measure and possession togither
they alledge also that the prophet repeating the creation which he seemed to haue distinguished by daies said thus in the second of genesis
these are the generations of the heauens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god made the heauens and the earth and euery plant of the field

before it was in the earth and euery herbe of the field before it grew whereby they say doth euidently appeere that al things were created togither
and for that the principall members of this mundane bodie are said to haue been ordained and engendred separately that that must be vnderstood to haue been so expounded according to the order through which man for whom all things haue beene made is very properly induced as the last worke of god according to the common saying of the peripateticks

that that which is the first in intention is the last in execution but the meanes betweene keeping a like order doe succeed from the first till the last
by such reason therefore the diuision of daies mentioned in genesis must be referred not to the time but to the order which is to be considered in the producement of things created
thus much for their opinions
but others contend to the contrarie and maintaine that god hath distinguished the creation of the world by certaine degrees and course of daies according as moses describeth them to keepe vs the more attentiue and to constraine vs to abide in the consideration of his works
for it is most certaine that we passe lightly ouer the infinite glorie of god which shineth vnto vs here below and the vanitie of our vnderstanding doth willingly carrie vs away
to correct which vice his diuine bountie would temper his works to our capacity
and they which hold this opinion haue noted how the text before cited out of ecclesiasticus wherein this word togither is read is not properly so in the greeke copie but the greeke word signifieth likewise or in common and hath relation not to the time but to the vniuersalnes and communitie of creatures
now to reconcile these diuers opinions me thinketh we may say that for the matter and rich seede of all the beauties and richesses of the vniuers it hath been created of god all in one moment but that afterward he gaue forme to it taking out of them the works which he did in the sixe daies
for thus the prophet speaketh

god in the beginning created the heauen and the earth
and the earth was without forme and void and darknes was vpon the deepe and the spirit of god moued vpon the waters
behold then the matter of this all which had his being all at once the chaos the embryon created of nothing which was to take forme figure place and abiding according to the order and disposition of all his partes and which in the meane while was sustained by the secret power of god
afterward

when moses addeth then god said let there be light

and there was light
and god saw the light that it was good and god separated the light from the darkenes and god called the light day and the darkenes he called night
so the euening the morning were the first day
in this say and in all the rest which ensueth concerning the workes of god in the fiue other daies is shewed vnto vs the forme that god gaue to the matter in the space of them creating and forming all creatures celestiall and terrestrial contained in the whole vniuers
see then how we may resolue this question whether all things were created togither or in diuers daies and thus we may reconcile their sundrie opinions

let vs farther note

how saint augustine accustomed to mount as we haue said with the wings of contemplation vnto the anagogicall sense discoursing vpon this point concerning the light which was said to haue beene created the first day with euening and mormng three daies before the sun confesseth freely that it is from our sense what light this is and by what alternate motion the euening and morning were made and he vseth this disiunctiue question whether it were some corporall light that is some lightsome bodie in the highest parts of the world farre from our sight or else a light without bodie in some place whereat the sunne was shortly after kindled or else by the name of light

was signified the holy citie of angels and blessed spirits whereof the apostle saith hierusalem which is aboue is the eternall mother of vs all in the heauens
therefore in another place also this great doctor of the church referreth the euening and morning to the science and knowledge of angelical thoughts calling it morning when by the view of things created knowne in themselues where there is darkenes and most deepe night these blessed spirits aduaunce themselues in the loue of god
and if louing and contemplating him they acknowledge all things in him which knowledge is much more certaine then if one should view them indirectly then is it day
but it is euening when the angell turneth himselfe from god to things created regarding them not in him but in themselues
and yet this euening commeth not to night because these angelicall thoughts neuer preferre the workes before the workman neither haue them in greater estimation for so should it bee most profound night
behold then how deepely saint augustine doth discourse

in this place concerning the euening and morning
but for the place concerning the point of the light he referreth the same termes euening and morning to the condition of our soule
for he saith that that which it can know and vnderstand in comparison of the knowledge of god is like an euening and that yet when it is bent to praise and loue the creator then doth it returne to morning
and for the distinct daies concerning the workes of god he applyeth them likewise to the orderly and perfect knowledge of things produced

saying thus when the minde stayeth in the knowledge of it selfe then is there one day when in the acknowledgement of the firmament which betwixt the water beneath and aboue is called the heauen then is the second day if concerning the earth the sea and all things fructifying which keepe themselues in the rootes of the earth there is the third day and when it stayeth in the acknowledgement of the lights both the greater and lesser and of the stars there is the fourth day if of the creatures which liue in the waters there is the fift day if of terrene things and man himselfe there is the sixt day
and thus doth this good father trauell to discouer the great mysteries closed concealed vnder the couert of moses words which in the relation of his historie hee doth most vndoubtedly apply to the capacitie of the rude and common people with whom he had to deale deliuering to the wise and more learned enough wherewith to satisfie their mindes
but without farther disputing about this present matter wee may note that in the creation of the light wherewith the world was to be adorned was the beginning of forme giuen to the matter of the world and of the distinction of creatures
yea in that the light did precede the sun moone which were created but the fourth day god would thereby testifie that in his onely hand light is resident and that he can conferre it vpon vs without any other meanes
for we are so enclined as nothing more to alligate the power of god to those instruments and organes wherewith he serueth himselfe because that for as much as the sun moone do minister light vnto vs wee will willingly assigne to them according to our fantasie such vertue that if the world were depriued of them we might hope of nothing but darkenes
wherefore the lord in this order of the creation causeth vs to see the contrarie and how it is in him and by him that the light subsisteth
now of you aser we may heare of some excellent mysteries concealed

vnder the number of the daies of this mundaine fabrication

of the mysteries hidden vnder the number of sixe in the creation of the vniuers and of the seuenth day of rest
chapter

aser

that all things consisted in numbers and that there was need of the knowledge of them to conceiue the sacred mysteries of god and nature pythagoras plato and all other academicks haue laboriously taught
but they haue spoken so superstitiously and so obscurely concerning the mysteries in these numbers that it seemed they woulde euen co~ceale them from those who were deuoted to the study of their doctrine
plato speaketh thus in his epinomide if we take away number from the nature of men wee leaue them no whit prudent nor capable of science

for the minde can comprehend nothing without reason and none can render a reason for anie thing that is ignorant of number
the artes likewise this set apart would altogither perish
he assureth vs also that number to wit the vnitie which is god is cause of all good but of none ill
and he calleth mans soule a number and reasonable measure by which we measure all things which may be vnderstood and put in practise by vs to the end that in our workes we may eschue all error folly and deformitie
now not onely the philosophers but also many great personages christians both greekes and latins doe testifie vnto vs by their writings that there be many mysteries in numbers amongst whom saint augustine speaketh thus

the reason of numbers is not to be despised of vs which how much it is to be esteemed in many texts of scripture is apparant to those which marke it diligently
and it hath not beene spoken in vaine to the praise of god thou hast ordred al things in number

waight and measure now hereupon we must note that the number waight measure wherby all things haue beene numbred poised and measured subsist not properly in the things created no more then the measure by which the cloth is parted into elles or the weights wherewith euerie thing is weighed or the number by which all things are

counted doe consist within the things measured poised or numbred but are doubtles without them
so then we contemplate the number waight and measure by which god hath disposed all things

out of the creatures
and forasmuch as there is nothing besides all things produced but god it is necessary that in him should consist their number waight and measure
in him then is the waight without waight for by it the great worker is not poised but remaineth stable giuing all things the power to be mooued and at last to repose themselues
and in truth this frame of the whole world duely proportioned and balanced by waight could not sustaine it selfe if it were not poised by the creator and gouernour thereof who likewise hath the measure by which he moderateth and disposeth all that is contayned therein in well ordered iustice according to the state and proper end of euerie of his workes
and in him also are the numbers without number because that all things which are in him are the same onely god
and as he is the true vnitie he contayneth in himselfe all number giuing all things the power to be numbred
for all multitude ariseth from one and nothing can be one making with any others a multitude if by the participation of the highest one it doth not obtaine the state of vnitie
and to it also all things created imitating the course of numbers as the true patterne doth the originall and the end of gods works endeuoure to returne in such sort as they first proceeded

we neede not doubt then but that the consideration of numbers doth therewith import much doctrine
wherefore particularly respecting the distinction of the workes of the vniuers in sixe daies which is the subiect of our discourse wee will note how many haue acknowledged the number of sixe to be full of deepe mysteries

first therfore mathematicia~s teach that six is the first perfect nu~ber because it is co~pounded of certaine parts perfectly added togither as of one two and three for which cause it is called of the pythagoria~s gamon or the marrying number because all the parts thereof set aside doe make it vp moreouer some parts of it multiplied together to produce it as sixe times one three times two two times three
in this consisteth the perfection of the number which is accomplished by all his parts and but few such haue beene found out by arithmeticians
for within the number of an hundred they haue obserued but that of twentie eight to which they haue attributed such proprietie because

it consisteth of fourteene seuen fower two and one as within the number of tenne there is but that of sixe which is accomplished by all his parts
saint hierom entreating of this number where he writeth vpon ezechiel saith that it contayneth the sacrament of creatures
and in truth there could not be inuented any number more proper for the making of the world then this of sixe which consisteth of a double proportion that it doth next containe in it selfe to wit of fower with two which numbers added togither make sixe which can hardly be found in other numbers but such as are of the nature of sixe as the double triple quadruple or square thereof and such like
so then sixe resulteth of that double proportion which makes the diapason in musicke which is the perfectest and most entire harmonie of all the concords
for which it seemeth that pythagoras would applie it to natiuities and to mariages and then it doth consequently verie properly fitte the creation of the world wherein were celebrated the true nuptials and coniunctions of all things
likewise sixe the first perfect number cannot but aptly agree to god the soueraigne and most perfect creator or to his worke wherein there is no defect

and therefore when he had finished and accomplished his workes in sixe daies moses saith thus the heauens and the earth were finished and all the host of them
but if we will farther proceed in the consideration of this number of sixe we shall see how by the triangled or figure thereof it doth properly accord with the creation of the world
for the base or foundation is the number of three the point a vnitie and the number of two is the meane betweene both as appeereth in this figure figure figure pyramid of balls now euery worke proceedeth from the three persons in the godhead to the vnitie from which the outward works performed in time are vnseparable they tend also to an end to which all things addresse themselues and the passage to proceed thither is the number of two which we may properly attribute to the matter first created by god to forme thereof all his workes
for the first beginning of the production and order of creatures was the matter which in respect of number representeth the nature of the binarie and seemeth to be reduced to the vnity by the forme which beareth the shape of the ternary so that on euery side of the premised figure of the number of sixe the ternarie tendeth to the vnitie by the binarie
and by this

consideration we may make way to the most high contemplation of the number of seauen

attributed to the rest of the lord
for we make no doubt that when we shall be all reduced to the vnitie as we tooke our originall from it then shall the rest of the sabbaoth ensue that is figured by the seuenth day wherein it is said that god ceased from his workes and which shutteth vp and closeth the course and circle of all daies
now that this number of seauen hath beene much reuerenced by men of ancient times we haue many witnesses
for the iewes because of the sabbaoth as saint hierome writeth vpon esaie did honour it much
and aulus gellius and macrobius vpon the dreame of scipio do shew great mysteries out of this number of seauen which they call full and perfect and attribute great power to it in the sea and amongst men
and the pythagorians as saith chalcidius commended it for the best most naturall and most sufficient number
moreouer it is composed of three which is the first vneeuen number that cannot be diuided by any numbers for vnitie is no number though it giueth all numbers the power to be numbred and of fowre which is a full euen number the first double number of all others
for this cause the number of seuen is oftentimes vsed for vniuersall generall and to signifie perfection

as it is written the iust shall fall seuen times a day and shall rise againe that is how often or how many times soeuer he falleth

he shall not perish
againe will praise thee seuen times a day which in an other place is thus spoken his praise is euer in my mouth

and we may finde manie places in holy scriptures wherein the number of seuen hath customably beene vsed for the vniuersalnes of any thing whatsoeuer and to demonstrate a perfection
and so doth saint iohn in the apocalyps

writing to the seuen churches and speaking of the seuen spirits which are before the throne of god
for it is certaine that he compriseth there all the vniuersall church and proposeth god in his maiestie accompanied with innumerable blessed angels
but among all the great mysteries which the ancients haue acknowledged to be concealed in the seuenth day by which the rest of the lord is recommended after his worke perfected and finished this is the most notable by which they teach vs

that this sabbaoth day signifieth the repose of those which rest in the lord euen as the ioy of the house betokeneth the ioy of those which reioice therein although that not the

house it selfe but something else do make them ioyfull and like as the effect being signified by the efficient cause an epistle is called ioyfull to declare the pleasure of those whom it delighteth by reading thereof
likewise when the scripture recounteth that god rested we must not take it childishly as if he who by an intelligible and eternall worde spake and it was made had trauailed in his worke but vnderstanding by this manner of speech that god ceased from all worke because he no more created any new kindes of creatures we may conueniently referre his rest to the rest of those whom hee himselfe causeth to remaine in eternall rest after that he hath first drawne them to himselfe by faith in this life
whereas also the prophet hauing made mention in each of the sixe precedent daies of the creation of euening and morning doth mention no such matter of the seuenth day it seemeth hee woulde signifie that this sabbaoth day was ordained to represent the great and last day of euerlasting rest wherein there should be no more anie such distinction of euening and morning nor of day and night as now is but altogither light by which we shall contemplate god face to face in true and perfect felicitie such as eie hath neuer seene eare neuer heard nor euer hath entred into the hart of man
which wee must doubtlesse beleeue was figured to the iewes by the rest of the sabbaoth commanded in the law for these names rest and sabbaoth in the hebrew toong full of mysteries signifie both one thing
in which matter we may farther note how the sacred historie declareth that man was created the sixt day which was the of the lords rest for this agreeth well to the principall thing which the lord intendeth in his law to wit to admonish man that he was not placed in the world but to returne at length to him who set him there and to seeke his rest in him
thus haue we sufficiently spoken of the subiect which we first entreated of for else if we shoulde fully prosecute the mysteries included in the historie of the creation of the worlde we should haue matter enough to make vp a verie great volume
we will therefore proceed to the particular consideration of the famous workes contained in the glorious frame of the world
and first we will speake of the diuision thereof that we may afterward discourse with more ease concerning the parts thereof
then amana let vs heare you concerning this point

of the diuision of the vniuersall world
chap

amana

the learned and venerable antiquitie figureth and maketh the vniuersall world to be one and threefold as signifying and representing though very farre off and much behinde the omnipotent most wise and most good worker by whom it hath been created

formed and ordained
for there is the vppermost world of all which diuines name the angelicall and philosophers call the intellectuall world which as plato saith was neuer yet sufficiently praised
then is there the celestiall world or that of the spheres which succeedeth and is next the first and the third and last is the elementarie world which we inhabite vnder the concauitie of the moone
now as this is the world of darknes so is the angelicall world the world of light and the world betwixt both is tempered with light and darknes
the elementarie world is designed to vs by the flowing waters and instable substance the angelicall by fire bicause of the shining of the light and eleuation of the place and the heauen of meane nature is called of the hebrues by a name signifying the same to be composed of water and fire
in this life and death striue for the maisterie by a kinde of vicissitude change and rechange all things but in the highest is eternall life and permanent operation and in that of the spheres is certaine assurance of life but there is changing of works and of places
the elementarie is built of the perishing substance of bodies the intellectuall of a nature more diuine and excellent and the meane heauen is compounded of bodies but incorruptible and of a disposition conuenient for the nature thereof
the third is mooued by the second and the second is gouerned by the first and this remaineth stable in his worke fit for his owne nature vnder the holy of holies the almightie which was which is and which is to come
and it seemeth that our great prophet of whom we haue learnt the creation of heauen and earth

hath euidently described these three worlds in the structure of his maruellous tabernacle
for he diuideth it into three parts whereof each doth liuely represent each world so that the first being not couered with any roofe or

couering was open and exposed to raine snowes windes sunne heate and cold and which hath more reference to our elementarie world in this former part haunted not onely men both cleane and polluted temporall and ecclesiasticall but also beasts of all sortes and there was likewise bicause of the ordinarie sacrifices and offerings a perpetuall exchange of life and death
the two other parts of the tabernacle were closed on euery side and defended from all outward iniurie euen as neither the celestiall nor supercelestiall world can receiue dammage
moreouer these two were honoured with the title of holy yet so that the most secret was named the holy of holies and the other simply the holy or sacred
so likewise the sphericall world is holy bicause that it perseuering in the order which was appointed it by the soueraigne creator hath in it no fault or crime but the angelicall is euen the most holy and most diuine wherein the blessed soules incessantly resound this song
thou art woorthie

lord to receiue honour and glorie and power for thou hast created all things and for thy wils sake they are and haue been created
but moreouer if we consider how the last part of the tabernacle was common to men and to beasts how the second all shining with the splendor of the gold was lighted with the candlesticke diuided into seuen lampes which as many greeke latine and hebrue interpreters will haue doe signifie the seuen planets and how in the third the most holy were the winged cherubins should we not say that these three partes manifest vnto our sight three worlds to wit this which men and all kind of creatures frequent the celestiall where the planets shine and giue light and the supercelestiall which is the dwelling and abode of the blessed angels the way to which hath been opened by the crosse and of our sauiour iesus christ true god and true man as the vaile of the temple by which the holy of holies being a type of the angelicall world was separated from the other partes thereof renting and tearing at the death of our sauiour was a certaine sacrament to vs

for thereby wee had assurance that from thencefoorth was free accesse granted man to the kingdome of god of god say who flieth aboue the cherubins through the very same entrance that from the beginning for the since of the first man had been barred vp by the lawes of iustice

thus haue we many notable things concerning the diuision

of the vniuersall world

which we may also call not onely bicause the three worlds do proceed of one onely and selfe cause and tend to the like end or else bicause being duly tempered by numbers they are ioined togither by an harmonious accord and affinitie of nature and by ordinarie succession of degrees but also bicause that that which is in all the three is likewise comprised in one of them and that there is not one wherein all things which are in the other three doe not remaine
it is most certaine that that which remaineth in this lowe world is in the vppermost of farre better stuffe and that which is in those aboue is seene also in this of farre woorse condition and as it were of a bastard and sophisticall nature
for here heate is an elementarie qualitie in heauen it is an heating virtue and in the angelicall thoughts an idea and exemplarie forme
or to shew this more cleerely we haue with vs in this base world the fire which is an element the sunne in heauen is a fire in the supercelestiall region the seraphicke or burning intellect is another fire
but let vs note how much they differ the element burneth the celestiall fire quickneth the supercelestiall is imbraced by loue
there is also here below water and so there is another water aboue being motresse and mistresse of this belowe which is the moone in the first circle of heauen but the cherubin or spirituall substances are the waters that flowe aboue the heauen
and as touching the disagreeable condition among these three kindes of waters the elementarie humour quencheth vitall heate that of heauen nourisheth it and the supercelestiall hath an intellectuall apprehension of it
furthermore in the first world god the first vnitie ruleth ouer the nine hierarchies of angels like so many spheres and remaining immooueable mooueth them al vnto him in the celestiall and meane world the imperiall heauen commandeth likewise as a captaine doth his bands the nine celestiall spheres in such sort that though they be mooued by continual agitation yet it remaineth stable by diuine power
so likewise is there in the elementarie world after the first matter being the foundation thereof nine spheres or circular reuolutions of corruptible formes that is three of things inanimate which first are the elements then their compounds and thirdly the meanes betweene these two truly mixed and compounded but vnperfectly and such are the impressions which appeere in the aire
then are there three reuolutions of vegetable nature distinguished likewise

into three kindes as of herbes shrubs and wood of olde growth
and lastly three other of the sensitiue soule which are either imperfect as the zoophyta or to speake english creatures of a middle condition betweene things sensitiue and plants or very perfect but such as are within the bounds of the fantasie not reasonable and in the third place that which is found excellent in beastes being capable of mans teaching a meane thing between man and beast as the zoophyta partaketh of the plant and animal
but it may be we haue said more concerning these things then is requisite for our purpose will onely therefore adde that the mutual vicinity and communication of the worlds which we haue here described is also declared in holy writ
for it is written in the psalmes in wisedome he made the heauens

and saint paul saith of himselfe that he was rauished into the third heauen which afterwards he calleth paradise

we read also that the angels of god are spirits and his ministers a flame of burning fire
and thence without doubt it commeth that oftentimes to diuine natures are attributed both celestiall and terrestriall surnames when as sometimes they are figured by starres

sometimes by wheeles and beasts and sometimes by elements as we sometimes also appropriate diuine and celestiall names to terrestriall natures
for euen as the three worlds being girt and buckled with the bands of concord doe by reciprocall liberalitie interchange their natures the like doe they also by their appellations
and this is the principle from whence springeth and groweth the discipline of allegoricall sense

for it is certaine that the ancient fathers could not conueniently haue represented one thing by other figures but that they had first learned the secret amitie and affinitie of all nature
otherwise there could be no reason why they should represent this thing by this forme and that by that rather then otherwise
but hauing the knowledge of the vniuersall world and of euery part thereof and being inspired with the same spirit that not onely knoweth all things but did also make all things they haue oftentimes and very fitly figured the natures of the one world by that which they knew to be correspondent thereto in the others
wherefore the same knowledge and the grace of the same spirit is requisite for those who would vnderstand and directly interpret such significations and allegoricall meanings
moreouer besides these worlds which we haue also distinguished there is also another

a fourth

wherein may likewise be found all that which subsisteth in the others
and this is man who for this cause as our doctors shew is vnderstood in the gospell by the name of euery creature then when iesus christ commandeth to preach to men the good newes

not to beasts nor angels being neuerthelesse enioyned to publish it to euery creature
likewise it is a common vse in schooles to teach that man is a little world and that within him the bodie is composed of the elements the reasonable soule is celestiall the vegetable power common to men and plants the sense common to brute beasts the reason participated to angels and finally the image of god is therein seene considered
but of him we haue sufficie~tly intreated in the second part of our academicall discourses wherefore of this great vniuersall world must our ensuing talke be
and as we haue diuided it into three generall parts so must we particularly discourse of them
first therefore let vs say something concerning the angelicall and intellectuall world and of the celestiall intelligences or angels which aram shall be the subiect of your discourse

of the angelicall and intellectuall world
chapter

aram

now shal haue great need to say with the kingly prophet oh that had wings like a doue

wings say of siluer and shining golde that might flie vp into the supercelestiall region where resteth true rest true peace and certaine tranquillitie which this wretched worldly corps cannot yeeld
open mine eies you supermundaine spirits but rather thou oh father of them and shall contemplate the woonder of your citie wherein god attendeth for those that feare him that which eie hath neuer seene eare neuer heard nor any hart woorthily thought vpon
well wot that many call disputations and searching out of the nature and multitude of angels and their orders vaine questions and fit for idle imaginations but surely they are secrets which saint paule himselfe who had beene rapt vp aboue the third heauen hath not onely taught but hath also protested that he had there heard many things

which were not lawfull for him to reueale
and am likewise of beleefe that the full reuelation of the angelicall

and intellectuall world is deferred till the last day yet will wee heere speake soberly thereof and as briefly as we can according to that which diuines haue written without any waies offending pietie or christian religion

when the holy scripture speaketh of the creation of the world it is not euidently expressed in what order and how the angels were created

but forasmuch as it is said that god created heauen and all things therein contained it is most certaine that therein are comprised the spirits celestiall as well those that through obedience haue stood in their integritie as those who rebelling against god haue beene cast out vnto destruction
neither is it heereto repugnant that moses reciting the genesis or creation of the world maketh no expresse mention thereof
for we see how that in silence passing ouer all things which surmount our capacitie or else couering them vnder the mysticall sense of his words for those whom god would fully illuminate with the brightnes of his holy spirite he onely entreateth of those which we behold with our eies yea and that too in familiar and vulgar sort conforming himselfe to the rudenes of the people with whom he had to deale
and for this cause hath the opinion of sundry great personages and namely of saint augustine beene

that the angels haue beene signified either by the name of heauen there where it is said in the beginning god made heauen and earth or else by the name of the light which he saith was created the first day
but howsoeuer this is doubtlesse that the angels are the worke of god
for the holy scripture doth testifie it in infinite places with a most cleere voice namely in the song of the three children which were in the furnace

who hauing saide blesse the lord all his works in pursuite of the narration of them the angels are also named
and the prophet saith you creatures of the heauens praise the lord you which are in the hie places praise him
all his angels

and all his armies praise him
sith also they are the ministers of god appointed to doe that which he commandeth them as the apostle to the hebrewes saith there is no doubt but they are his creatures
moreouer the holy scriptures teach vs that they are alwaies watching for our safetie that they are alwaies readie to defend vs that they direct our waies and haue care of vs in all things

and therefore abraham promised his seruant that the angell of god should be his guide on the way
and so often and so many times as god

would deliuer the people of israel out of the hands of their enimies

he was serued by his angels to performe this deed

as wee read that the angell of the lord slew in one night an hundred fowerscore and fiue thousand men in the campe of the assyrians to deliuer ierusalem from siege
but to stande no longer in so cleere a matter

will onely adde this that is said that the angels ministred to iesus christ after he was tempted in the desert and that they assisted him in his anguish at the time of his passion and that they published his resurrection and his glorious comming

but to determine of the number and orders of angels were me thinketh aboue all humane power
for daniel speaking of the maiestie of the throne of god saith thousand thousands of angels ministred vnto him and ten thousand thousands stood before him

and dauid singeth the chariots of god are twentie thousand thousand angels
saint iohn also maketh mention of ten thousand times ten thousand and a thousand thousand that giue glorie to god

and iesus christ himselfe witnesseth that there are many legions
in briefe all the scripture reporteth of an infinite number of angels seruing god whom he employeth in the protection of his elect and by whom he bestoweth his benefits vpon men and doth his other works
and for their orders although they be not noted in expresse text of scripture yet the different names whereby they are described haue affoorded matter subiect to saint denis in his celestiall hierarchie to iamblicus in his booke of mysteries to many other moderne diuines to set downe nine orders and degrees of angels to wit the seraphins cherubins thrones dominations vertues powers principalities archangels and angels all which are celestiall spirits to whom the scripture attributeth such and the like names according to the ministrie wherein god commandeth them to serue so applying them to our infirmitie
for they are called angels

because god maketh them his messengers to man and vertues because that by them god declareth the power of his hand and principalities dominations powers signiories because that by them god exerciseth his empire throughout all the world and his armies

because as souldiers are about their prince and captaine so are they present before god to honor his maiestie and attend his good pleasure to employ themselues about all things that he gaueth them

in charge yea sometimes they are named gods because that by their ministerie they do as it were in a mirrour represent vnto vs the image of god
and we see that

michael is called in daniel the great prince or captaine and archangel in iude
and saint paule saith that it shall be an archangell who shall summon the world with a trumpet vnto iudgement
daniel also declareth that the angell of the persians fought and also the angell of the greekes against their enimies as if he would shew that god hath sometimes appointed his angels to be gouernours of countries and prouinces

and iesus christ telling how the angels of little infants do alwaies behold the face of his father declareth thereby that there are certaine angels who haue them in guard
saint peter also being miraculously come forth of prison

and knocking at the house wherein the faithfull were assembled they that could not thinke that it was he said that it was his angel
yet for al these considerations hold it a thing of too difficult enterprise for mortall man to constitute and appoint which are the degrees of honor among the angels and particularly to distinguish one from another by any name or title and to assigne to euerie one his place his abode and office
we will therefore leaue these things for curious heads to dispute vpon
yet will we hold our selues ascertained of that which the holy scripture doth openly declare vnto vs and which may best serue vs to our comfort and for the confirmation of our faith that is that the angels gods creatures are disposers and ministers of his beneficence towards vs that such kind of beleefe is a certaine argume~t against atheists concerning the prouidence of god

and for the blessed estate of these celestiall spirits it is certaine that for as much as they haue no whit swarued fro the light wherein god created them they remaine in blessednes and felicitie from which they shall neuer more fall
now if we demaund what this felicitie is without doubt it is the vision and contemplation of the glorie and maiestie of god whose face as we said euen now they alwaies behold and to whom they giue praise without ceasing singing with a loude voice this song as esay declareth

holy holy holy is the lord of hostes all the earth is full of his glory
for there is no good in the reasonable or intellectual creature through which it may become happy but god only
wherfore the cause of the felicitie and happines of the angels is for that they belong to god in such sort that their nature liueth in

him is wise by him reioiceth euerlastingly in so great and ineffable a good without death without error without impediment

know well some men be so fantasticall that they make it a doubt whether there bee any angels or spirits
the sadduces in times past held this opinion that by the word angel was signified nothing else but the motion that god inspireth into men or the power which he sheweth in his works
but there are so many testimonies of scripture which contradict this madnes and histories both ecclesiasticall and prophane are so replenished with woonderfull actes of inuisible spirits as we daily see come to passe that it is a wonder how such ignorance could be in former ages

and yet among many remaineth at this day
there haue also beene men of great authoritie who discoursing according to the reasons of philosophie haue dared to affirme that god the first father and author of all things did onely produce one intelligence or angell because say they being alwaies of one manner hee cannot by any naturall reason produce diuers thinges
for this cause therefore they woulde limite the powerfull production of god to one onely intelligence which being created of god had recourse to the first thought whereof it produced the second intelligence and knowing it selfe it ingendred the soule or moouer of the first sphere and this moouer knowing also his worke it proceeded to produce another so successiuely the cause being varied in substance and operation diuers effects were produced
which obscure opinio might haue some colour if the first and almightie creator were restrained to produce but one effect onely too absurd a thing to be imagined in the father and author of the vniuers seeing that not a particular but an vniuersall effect is answerable vnto him to wit the world onely and the entire estate of all things as wee haue heeretofore sufficiently declared
and so it followeth that this vniuers like a body entire in it selfe and diuers in the members thereof was engendred by one onely father and creator and liues by one onely vniuersall life
but we will combate against these philosophers with more strong weapons maintaining against them according to the truth

that the soueraigne maker came to his worke without being tied by any naturall law but free and franke in euery worke as he pleaseth being abundantly full of all vertue and of all manner of bountie and essentiall good will

proceeded to his outward worke as these things haue beene declared vnto vs in our precedent discourse
but this by the way albeit the maxime of the peripateticks be though false that the first cause worketh of necessitie and that it is alwaies of one sort which is most true yet doth it not therefore follow that it should produce but one effect seeing that of the sunne which is euer the same and of the earth which being stable changeth not are produced diuers effects without any varietie comming to their nature yea and without any tilling of the ground
for herbes flowers and rootes of diuers kindes do grow therein and many other essences are therein produced by power of the sunne
but if these philosophers tell me that diuers effects appeere in these things because that other particular causes doe worke therein togither they haue left the proofe of this point to their children to wit whether this varietie proceedeth from diuers causes or else from the same sunne fruitfull and full of vertue to engender diuers things
then with how much greater reason may the first true and eternall sonne do it being abundantly full of all fruitfulnes light and life

for all things were and are in him not as if they were seated in any locall place but are lodged in his thought from whence producing them he is called their father and creator
he onely free from the lawes of nature without any matter presupposed produceth all things yea and the matter it selfe altogither full of fertilitie
but the second or naturall cause as philosophers speake requireth the subiect and matter created by god wherewith it worketh
and here doth that take place which the prince of peripatetickes saith that in common acceptation of the soule it is conuenient that it be made of nothing and therefore also our diuines affirme that the angels can create no nature at all and that they are creators of things no more then gardiners of fruits
and therefore all those who haue receiued the light of the truth confesse god alone to be father and author of all things contayned in heauen and in earth whether spirituall or corporall visible or inuisible natures
and let vs neuer thinke that in so great consonancie of the vniuers there are many creators nor that there is any more then one onely king and prince nor many things that consist of themselues
for so should there be confusion and discordancie in this great world and so consequently easie dissolution
thus much haue we thought conuenient to be knowne concerning

the intellectuall world wherein hauing spoken of the blessed estate of those angels which are not fallen from god my minde is that we say somewhat concerning those who are fallen from their first estate which we call commonly diuels or euill spirits
we will heare you then achitob discourse of them

of diuels and euill spirits
chap

achitob

if we here discourse somewhat by numbers we shall make more easie way to that which we would vnderstand concerning the diuels yea concerning euery creature
say then euery number after the vnitie attaineth to be a perfect and accomplished number within it selfe
now the vnitie alone totally simple doth not passe from it selfe but therein remaineth in indiuisible and solitarie simplicitie bicause it is most fully content with it selfe not hauing neede of any thing being full of his owne riches
but euery number being by nature a multitude doth by the benefit of the vnitie become simple bicause it is capable of simplicitie
and although euery number the more it departeth from the vnitie the more it falleth into a great multitude hauing in it selfe more disagreeablenesse more parts and composition yet is there no number how neere soeuer to the vnitie being a multitude and made of vnities that is one by nature

but by composition
now if we referre this to diuine matters after the manner of pythagoras and plato we shall say thus god alone who proceedeth not from any thing and from whom all things proceede is an entire most simple and indiuisible essence and which deriueth all that he possesseth from himselfe and by what reason he subsisteth by the same reason he is wise he is willing he is good and he is iust
and we cannot imagine any essence whereof he may consist but the same being which he is
but all other things are not the same essence but are through him and therefore an angell is not this vnitie for so should he be god or else there should be sundry gods which may not be imagined
for what should be one but the vnitie alone it resteth then that the angell must be a number which being so on the other side it is one in multitude as euery number commeth of the vnitie by composition and euery number is

imperfect bicause it is a multitude that which is perfect being entirely one
so then the angell being a number that is a creature he is not the same being it selfe but he is onely an essence to whom the being arriueth by communication to the end that he may subsist
neither is he vnderstanding it selfe but so he vnderstandeth as being by a spirituall nature capable of vnderstanding
those things that betoken imperfection are incident to the angell as he is a multitude or creature
but all that which is perfect and of accomplished forme in him is by reason of the vnitie whereof it is composed and which he receiueth bicause that he is conioined with god who is the simple vnitie from whom all being all life and all perfection is deriued to the creature
and therefore the philosophers as also the wise hebrues the angels separated intelligences bicause say they

being separated from the most simple vnderstanding they receiue a certaine composition in an essence and vertue which perfecteth them of a metaphysicall and supernaturall matter and forme

for this point also saint augustine teacheth that there is one onely simple good and therefore immutable which is god and that by this good all things haue beene created good but not simple and therefore they are mutable
which is manifest not onely in man

but euen in some part of the angels as this doctor of the church excellently discourseth in the most part of his worke de ciuitate dei
and these are those of whom the scripture teacheth that they haue not remained in the truth but declining from their first state haue ouerthrowne themselues and haue beene made instruments of perdition to many

but as we heard by our precedent speech

some haue been in this error to beleeue that the good angels were nothing else but good inspirations motions which god gaue men so there haue been that thought that the euill diuels were no other but euill affections through the suggestion of our flesh
yea the impietie of our age hath passed farther for there are many

which will not beleeue that there is any god or diuell
and it is not long since that certaine talke being mooued betweene a prelate of this kingdome and certaine others concerning the diuel he blushed not to aske them if they had euer seene any one who had sold him spectacles considering he must needes be very olde since they say that he came first into the world
now such contemners of all religion do euidently shew their ignorance and beastlinesse

for there was neuer any will not say christian but ethnicke nor pagan endued with any naturall knowledge and facultie of teaching but hath spoken of diuels and euill spirits and haue by many writings left to posteritie infinite testimonies concerning their nature and maruellous effects
yea the doctrine of the assyrians arabians egyptians and grecians confirmeth that which our most diuine theologie teacheth vs concerning the euill angels chased from the seruice of god
and amongst others pherecides the syrian describeth the fall of the diuels and saith that ophis which signifieth the diuelish serpent was captaine of the rebellious armie
trismeghistus also the glorie of the egyptians hath touched the same fall
and homer the most excellent greeke poet and setter foorth of mysteries singeth in his verses the fall of the first rebell vnder the name of até goddesse of iniurie and wrong
the theologie also of the arabians in imitation of the hebrew confirmeth the same
yea the diuels themselues haue oftentimes confessed their owne fall as many writings testifie and they know who haue trauelled in the searching out of ancient monuments
wherefore this matter needeth not long disputing and it is not our intent to satisfie the curious and fantasticall of our age to whom nothing is pleasant saue new doctrine

but pursuing the christian truth we say that since the angels haue beene created of god and the diuels haue beene all created angels there is no doubt but they are his creatures but not of the first condition wherein they were at the beginning
for they were created good like the other angels and like man but they haue made themselues euill by their rebellion pride and sinne like as our first father fell from his natiue integritie by imitation of them so that of angels they haue made themselues diuels

and therefore it is written of them that they haue not perseuered in the truth that is that they haue not for euer stucke to god who is the onely good of euery reasonable or intellectuall creature

as saint augustine doth learnedly teach adding moreouer the cause of their fall when hee saith that the creature which may attaine to the gift of blessednes can not do it of it selfe because it is created of nothing but it receiueth this benefite from him by whom it hath beene created
thereupon is concluded

that immutable good is no other thing but the true blessed god and that yet all things which hee hath created are very excellent good bicause they proceed from him

but yet they are mutable bicause they haue beene made not of him that is of his owne substance but of nothing
because then the diuels haue beene created by god we must vnderstand that they haue not that malice which now we say is their naturall estate from their first creation but forsomuch as they haue depraued themselues
for that which is damnable in them they haue gotten it since they turned voluntarily from god

and therefore it is saide that sathan speaketh of his owne when hee speaketh a lie because he abode not in the truth whereby it appeereth that he was once in it
and in that he is called the father of lying all excuse is taken from him so that he cannot impute to god that euill wherof himselfe is cause

wherfore as the diuels haue declined from their first estate god hath not spared them but hath bound them in the deepe with chaines of darkenes to reserue them to the iudgement of the great day who likewise perseuering in their first malice and enuie haue alwaies endeuored shal continue to the end to be instruments of perdition vnto men
and therefore all that which the holy scripture teacheth vs concerning them tendeth to this point that we should stande vpon our guards to resist their temptations and not to be surprised by their ambushments arming vs to this effect with all the armour of god as saint paule doth thereto exhort vs

for he that hath a long time iudged them holds them so with the bridle that they cannot annoy those which are firme in faith to resist them nor do any thing without his will and leaue

but hee maketh them serue for a time measured and prefixed for scourges as it pleaseth him in the execution of his iudgements giuing them much power of error in prodigies and miracles to abuse those which turne from the light of truth to follow darknes and embrace lying
and thence spring the idolatries of the pagans and inuocations on diuels which haue caused so many euils to lay holde on man
for the purpose of the diuels hath alwaies beene to make themselues to be serued and honored of men to the ende that being associated with them they might likewise be a most prouoking and effectuall cause of the iudgement of god

and yet how many doe we see euen at this day

who make boasts to haue at their commaund such ministers of iniquitie whom they thinke to disguise when they call them by the name of familiar spirits will not stande heere to disptue whether

there be diuers kindes of diuels or not as many haue written but beleeue the worde of god that all of them tend to this purpose to be hurtfull to men
and though some coniure them by the names of god and so keepe them bound and chained as many bragge that they do yet are they euer watchfull till at length they deceiue their masters
will also beleeue that they are not ignorant in ought which either the reasonable or intellectuall nature can comprehend concerning corporall and temporall things

yea as saint augustine saith by experience of certaine signes vnknowne to vs they foresee very many things to ensue more then men do and doe sometimes beforehand tell the dispositions of them

they are so skilfull that they said to iesus christ clothed with the infirmitie of our flesh what haue we to do with thee iesus of nazareth art thou come hither to torment vs before our time but as the same doctor of the church proceedeth because they do not contemplate the eternall causes of times in the wisedome of god but onely coniecture of temporall things by the temporall and of mutable by the mutable they are oftentimes deceiued
for they cannot behold the euents of the eternall and immutable decrees of god which flourish in his diuine wisedome by such a direct insight as it hath beene giuen to the holy angels and they see not the thing if we may terme it so to which are fastened all causes and whereupon they turne neither do they know the fountaine out of which they spring wherefore it commeth to passe that as all things which are not collected and concluded by their certaine principles but by erring and estranged coniectures may deceiue so the diuels are oftentimes beguiled in those signes whereupon they relie and tell lies euen then when they thinke themselues most assured to speake truth
but they alwaies tend to this point bicause of their malignant enuious nature to bring all hurt to men which in the end they cannot auoide when they forget themselues so farre as that they will against the word of god take counsell of the diuell an offence surely woorthie of all punishment
moreouer doubt not but as the pure and superiour powers whom according to the stile of holy writ we call the good angels which is a word among the greeks signifying messenger doe not commonly suffer themselues to be intreated by euery one but doe require and attend the cleannes of hart the holines of life and the commandement of god so on the contrarie

the diuels or euill angels to whom these two names doe properly agree this last according to doctrine of the scriptures and the other daemon of a greeke word signifying to knowe they doe make themselues easie and shew men a kinde of lying fauour to the end that drawing to themselues by their craft and subtiltie those who require and seeke their aide in their occasions they may put god in obliuion and abandon themselues to be possessed and gouerned by the diuell who is their prince
for so in fine it commeth to all those which serue themselues with these ministers of iniquitie to all magicians soothsayers necromancers sorcerers witches and enchanters

with whom the word of god doth expressely charge vs in many places to haue no communication commanding also that they should be rooted out of the earth
and what woonders doe they by the aide and helpe of euil spirits often performing that which neither art nor humane vnderstanding can permit to be done yet can we no otherwise name all their workes then very coosenage and illusion bicause they doe it either in apparance onely or to the hurt and dammage of those which allow and suffer them
such were those miracles as we read in many authors to haue beene done amongst the idols of the gentiles by the arte of the diuels
of whom saint augustine after a long discourse addeth these words
what shall we speake of these woonders

saue that we must flee out of the middest of babylon for this propheticall commandement must thus be spiritually vnderstood of vs to wit that with the wings of faith which worketh by charitie we flee out of the citie of this world which doubtlesse is the dale of diuels and of most wicked and impious men
for by how much greater we see the power of euill spirits in these inferiour things by so much the more must we most firmely cleaue to our mediator iesus christ by whom we mount vp from belowe
and indeede it is by his grace that we may discerne the spirits whether they be of god

or not yea that sathan cannot deceiue vs though he were transformed into an angell of light
otherwise let vs not doubt that if we will harken to him or to his ministers and spirits whom the fooles of this age flatter with the name of familiar spirits that he will easily glide into our soules to lead vs at last in triumph to his kingdome of perdition where we shall deerely buie the familiaritie of so pernitious an enemie
wherefore let vs rather haue alwaies in our hart and in our mouth that praier which our sauiour

himselfe hath taught vs

that he leade vs not into temptation but deliuer vs from euill
and let vs leaue the magicians and sorcerers which run to their owne destruction seeking after the spirits who lead them to the eternall gehenna which is prepared for the diuell and his angels

but now sith it is time to put an ende to our talke for this day hauing surueied the angelicall or intellectuall world according to the capacitie of our feeble spirit we will to morrow intreate of the celestiall world or of the spheres
whereupon you aser shall begin to discourse

the end of the second daies worke

the third daies worke
of the celestiall or sphericall world
chapter

aser

if wee begin our speech concerning the sphericall and of the elementarie world and intreate of them both according to the proper definition we shall doe very well to the ende that that which wee intende to discourse of may more easily be vnderstood
the world then

which yesterday we called the being contemplated with one view is the perfect and entire composition of all things and the true image and admirable workmanship of the godhead
the greatnes whereof is incomprehensible and yet limited being also adorned with all bodies and kindes of creatures which are in nature
and the description thereof is properly called cosmographie which doth comprise in it the first part of astronomie and geographie that is the order and reason as well of heauen as of the earth vnder which we vnderstand all natures and essences in them contained
and for this cause it seemeth that god being father and author of all things is oftentimes called in the scriptures creator of heauen and earth
and as the greekes did first call the heauen cosmos bicause of

the surpassing beautie so afterward the name of mundus hath been attributed thereto bicause of the perfect and most pure hiew and neatnes thereof
againe because the world is a solide bodie that is full of celestiall or elementarie substances and because it is of a round and orbicular forme performing a circular motio without intermission vpon his owne poles round about the earth as about the center thereof it is called a sphere

for a sphere is a bodie contayned vnder one round superficies in the midst whereof is a point from which all lines that are drawne to the circumference are equall

but as we consider the world in this sphere so must we also contemplate it in two distinct parts which manifest themselues by continuall experience and naturall reason to wit the elementarie region continually occupied in generation and corruption in change and alteration of all things as well liuing as not liuing and the celestiall part being of inuariable substance and adorned with innumerable stars as well fixed as wandring which enuiron the saide elementarie region round about so that the elements being diuersly intermingled infused and proportioned are the materiall cause and nouriture of all things and the heauenly part by the light thereof by the motion and influence of the stars is the formall cause of their figure varietie and specificall difference and from it proceedeth their life
now that we may entreat of this first part of the world which we haue named in our first diuision of the vniuers the world of the spheres we must note that this celestiall region which philosophers call the fift essence thereby meaning that it is of another and more simple nature then the fower elements is by them diuided into eight orbes and particular heauens one ioyning to the other and all concentricall that is hauing one common and selfe same center to wit that of all the world and of these heauens the greatest doth enuiron and by a sphericall order enclose within it that which is next and lesse then it selfe being each discerned by the proper and particular motion of those stars which they containe all which motions do varie one from another
and these eight orbes or spheres are the heauen of fixed stars which keepe an vnchangeable distance betweene themselues and for this cause it is called the firmament then follow the seuen planets of which the sunne and moone are properly called luminaria or great lights

and for saturne iupiter mars venus and mercurie they are especially

named planets that is wandring in their motions
whereupon we may note in regard of their names that astrologians to the ende to make their doctrine to be more easily retayned and for certaine good respect and secret reason making themselues like painters to instruct the ignorant haue also named and represented these stars by personages of diuers habits and countenances as likewise they haue disposed vnder diuers figures the twelue signes of the zodiacke which are certaine stars appointing to one the fashion of a ramme to another of a bull to another of two twinnes and so of the rest
so likewise they haue signified the images of heauen which are out of the zodiacke one by a beare another by an eagle another by an harpe this by a dog and that by a dragon and so of the rest
to the sunne it selfe they haue assigned a proper forme and figure as also to the moone
and we see that painters haue alwaies made the picture of stars with fiue beames to denote their twinckling light though all of them do not glister so but are of round fashion without points or corporall beames
but returne we to our matter concerning the heauens and celestiall spheres and let vs speake of their order and situation

the firmament which is the eight heauen as the highest and greatest of all the rest and as the vttermost ornament and beawtie of all the world doth enuiron round about the heauen of saturne that of saturne the heauen of iupiter that of iupiter the heauen of mars and that of mars the orbe of the sunne which possesseth the middle place among the seuen planets then the heauen of the sunne compasseth round about the heauen of venus that of venus the heauen of mercurie and lastly that of mercurie the heauen of the moone which is the least lowest of all the rest and placed next about the elementarie region
and this number and order of the heauens is commonly receiued of all astronomers and philosophers and sheweth it selfe to be such both by naturall reasons and by mathematicall obseruations
moreouer for so much as by the astronomers ring and other instruments fitting for the demonstration of this science one may perceiue that these eight spheres are distinguished and separated one from the other certaine reason doth thereupon conclude

that beside these there is a ninth which is called the first moouer which is the guide of the heauens and which by his owne power and violence doth carrie away all the others with it

being no whit gouerned by any lower circle but onely by that intelligence which mooueth it or else by the commandement of god to whom all motion is drawen as to the first moouer to the end that the whole harmonie of heauen be not confused as aristotle in the ende of his organon prooueth
true it is also that some moderne philosophers doe place betweene the firmament and the first moouer a ninth sphere

which they cal the chrystalline heauen for that some stars are not seene therein
and this is because that they cannot perceiue how there might be made in the eight sphere the motion called trepidation or tottering of the fixed stars if there were not a ninth heauen enclosed within the first moouer
for it seemes not likely to them that the firmament which is turned with three motions should be ioyned to the first moouer which is carried with one onely course
for this eight sphere hath one daily motion from the west to the east vpon the poles of the zodiack which is the circle of the signes vpon which according to ptolomie in each hundred yeeres it ru~neth one degree or else in sixty yeers as others hold then hath it the foresaid motion of trepidation
wherupon they conclude that there is a ninth heauen that hath onely a motion betwixt the starrie heauen and the first moouer which is onely turned with one motion to the end that in good order all things may bee reduced to the first moouing
for as aristotle in his profound philosophie saith it is necessary that by most fit agreement and consent euery thing may be reduced to that which is the cause thereof
but because ptolomy hermes aratus and other ancients most exquisite beholders of the heauens and of their motions and aspects are contented with the number of nine spheres many therefore reiect the opinion of those which make ten because that nothing maketh for them but onely the motion of trepidation which say they may be well considered vnder the first moouer put for the ninth sphere
besides which our diuines do yet declare to be a tenth heauen which they call empyreall vitall flaming and diuine

into which are receiued the soules of the blessed
and it seemeth that plato and his academicks especially plato in his booke of the world doth consent to them
but this heauen and throne of god cannot properly be reckoned with the other nine
for they bee mooueable but this is stable and immooueable they be of one substance onely and this of another
wherefore we may aptly referre it to the

angelicall and intellectual world whereof we discoursed yesterday
and if we may bee permitted againe to discourse by numbers as we haue begun it is certaine that as the number of ten retaineth a double nature because it doth partake with that number whereof it is the end and with that other whereof it is the beginning so the tenth in all the prime kindes of things doth consist of double nature
for man which is the tenth kinde of things subiect to corruption at whom the other nine finish is of a corruptible and incorruptible composition
so the nine heauens end at the imperiall heauen which in that it is material agreeth with them but in dignitie of matter it doth participate with the supercelestiall throne
as likewise they that speake of the nine orders of angels say that they end in christ their king who holdeth and embraceth in all perfection both the nature of angels and also of god to whom at last all things must be reduced as to him of whom from whom and by whom all thinges consist

now that which heere we speake of the heauens may likewise be learned out of moses the prince of all philosophers or rather of the creator of all things himselfe who hath spoken by the mouth of his prophet as also by himselfe
for after moses had praied the eternall that he woulde be alwaies with him and that he woulde by continuall oracles instruct him as there should be great need that hee might rule such a number of people and that he might giue them the law will be saith he with thee and will dwell in the midst of thee and according to all those things which shall shew thee euen so shall you make the forme of the tabernacle
they shall make an arke of shittim wood whereof the height and the bredth shall be a cubite and an halfe
such as haue diligently interpreted this text do amongst other mysteries finde therein the nine heauens aptly represented for a cubite is sixe palmes then a cubite and halfe hie and broad are nine palmes
and againe when he commandeth that vpon the same arke he shoulde make a crowne of gold which should serue it for a couering and which was of precious stuffe farre aboue that of the arke of wood they would thereby make vs vnderstand that the tenth heauen was figured
which for that cause is not numbred commonly with the other nine but is considered by our vnderstanding to bee the beginning of an other combination and coupling
for ten as it doth accomplish

the other numbers so is it the originall of the tens so an hundreth finishing the tens beginneth the hundreths so this couering of gold otherwise called propitiatorie crowning the arke was beginning to a better thing for vpon the same were placed the cherubims and there were obtained the mercifull and fauorable graces of god
in such sort likewise the imperiall heauen though it accomplisheth and finisheth the number of the nine heauens yet is it the beginning of spirituall and diuine thinges and retaineth an angelicall nature yet so that it is proportioned to the spheres who are appointed to haue a place
againe wee haue heeretofore heard in the generall diuision of the vniuers how in the partition of the tabernacle into three speciall parts was very aptly signified that of the world being a
how also by the seuen lampes of gold ordained to be set to the candlesticke in the arke might fitly seeme to be represented the seuen planets shining in their spheres as likewise by the body of the same candlesticke out of the sides whereof proceeded sixe branches to wit three out of either side might bee particularly denoted the sun which is placed in the midst of the planets wherof there be three on each part in round forme which like cups or vessels receiuing influences from aboue do conferre them on things heere below by which meanes sundry flowers do spring vp
but because it woulde be too tedious for vs to compare all that which belonged to the making of the arke with that which is taught vs concerning the spheres wee will come to conclude that there be nine heauens to wit the first mooueable by which the supreme worker and first moouer of all mooueth all things
then is the starrie heauen or firmament by which the same creator distributeth his power into innumerable instruments to performe such things as he executeth especially by meanes of the seuen planets which haue euery one their heauen according to the order heeretofore declared
and vpon which according to our yesterdaies speech the hebrew doctors and many other diuines do teach that certaine spirits which they call celestiall or separated intelligences do make abode who being before the throne of god reioicing in his presence do behold in his countenance as in a mirrour all things which may be contemplated and at the very becke of the prince of nature do put his will in execution vsing the heauens as instruments by which and according to the number of diuers influences proceeding from all

the starres and signes heere below are produced with one concurrence mettals stones plants and liuing creatures
but before we more amplie touch these things which respect the nature and admirable effects of the heauens in al creatures we must first entreat of their figure and motion which amana shall be the subiect of your discourse

of the forme and figure of heauen and of the motion thereof as well generall as particular
chap

amana

that the heauen is generally and particularly of circular forme and altogether round the latin name orbis by which the ancients haue commonly called it

is a sure testimonie vnto vs so likewise there are many naturall reasons which declare it to be such
for all the partes of the frame thereof doe consist of themselues doe sustaine themselues and doe comprehend themselues not hauing neede of any stay or ioint hauing neither a beginning nor ending place
moreouer this roundnes of heauen may be knowne by the sight of the eie
for on which side soeuer you behold it you may see the halfe in our hemisphere as it doth shew it selfe which could not come to passe in any other figure but in a round which also is the most perfect and most capable of all other figures to bee comprised in one selfesame circuit and is therewithall the easiest to mooue euery way
and therefore it is not onely conuenient but also necessarie for all the heauens and celestiall orbes of which we before intreated as well bicause of the perfection of their essence as by reason of their proper motions which are circular and correspondent to a round forme besides all this bicause these spheres are placed one within another making their reuolutions vpon diuers poles and in diuers spaces of time
which could not be obserued nor the integritie of the whole heauen maintained if the celestiall forme were any other saue round and circular

for the proper and naturall motion of the spheres is circular that is framed equally distant round about their center which is the point in the midst of the world so that neither the whole heauen nor any of the particular spheres doth wholy abandon or passe out of his owne place and situation but

onely the partes of them doe incessantly change place in that they turne about their said common center
and therefore is this circular motion much more noble and perfect then that which is made by a right line either mounting from the center of the world towards the circumference

or else descending from it towards the center which motion is proper to the fower elements
for fire and aire do mount vpwards but water and earth descend naturally downwards
also fire mounteth higher then aire and earth descendeth lower then water and each of these enuiron the center of the world which is the lowest place of all and farthest from the circumference which is the highest of all
so then the circular motion is naturally due and conuenient to the most noble and most simple bodie which is the heauen and most necessarie for it as it appeereth more cleerely to vs by the continuall motion of the starres both fixed and wandring which proceedeth of the onely moouing of their spheres

for we must note that the starres are nothing else but certaine firme cleere and solide partes of their heauens made in round forme like the heauen whose motion they follow which likewise receiue their light from the sunne who is the very source and fountaine whereinto the soueraigne creator hath put the brightnes of the whole vniuersall world

now this circular motion of heauen is found by obseruation to haue two principall differences that is to be made vpon sundry poles and axes and in sundry partes and positions of the world as also in diuers spaces and quantities of times

we call that the axis of the sphere which is the diameter that passeth through the same vpon which it is turned and the vttermost points of the same axis are the poles
for the whole vniuersall world hath his proper and naturall motion like a liuing creature and euery of the orbes and particular heauens haue also a peculiar motion like to the partes and members of the whole great bodie
for which cause as also for diuers other considerations many learned personages haue affirmed that the world is an animal or liuing creature
and amongst others origen is wholy of that minde who enforceth himselfe to prooue it as well by reasons as by authoritie of holy scripture
and therefore he saith thus in his booke of principles
though the world be ordained to diuers offices yet the estate thereof must not be thought to be dissonant or any whit disagreeing
but euen as our bodie alone

is composed of many members

and is contained by one soule so thinke we must suppose that the vniuersall world is a great and vnmeasurable animal which as by a soule is sustained by the power and wisedome of god
the platonists doe all with one mouth teach the same thing
and among many reasons by which they would confirme this point we will take onely that of plato in his timaeus which me thinkes is most excellent
there are saith he two motions the one proper the other strange or exterior now that is more diuine which of it selfe is mooued then that which is stirred by the power of another
and this motion proper and diuine is in our soules onely from which the beginning of the other strange motion is taken
seeing therefore that all motion proceedeth of the ardor of the world and that this ardor is not mooued by exterior agitation but of it owne accord it is therefore necessarie that there must be a soule
whereupon we gather that the world is an animal and that not without vnderstanding
now if thereupon any aske why heauen changeth not nor becommeth diseased nor dieth nor faileth as other liuing creatures doe the answere of chalcidius in this point pleaseth me very much

when he saith commenting vpon timaeus that which is instituted by god without meanes is free and exempt from change from age from sicknes from oldnes and from death
and in this point agree all academicks as also might bee well proued by circumstance if that be well considered which the sage philosopher moses declareth to haue beene produced by the creator without helpe or matter and that which hath beene also performed by meanes of the second causes
for though man was created and formed by the handes of god yet was hee not made without dust or earth which was a meane subiect
but the eternall hath made the heauens and the whole frame of the world of nothing for which reason it might seeme perpetuall and not perishing
for as we haue heretofore declared though the heauens and earth must passe away yet doth not this plainly conclude an annihilating of them but rather a changing and renewing

for so speaketh the kingly prophet saying the heauens shall waxe old as doth a garment as a vesture shalt thou change them and they shall be changed
and of this consideration we may frame an excellent reason concerning the immortalitie of the soule bicause it was made without any meanes by god himselfe
but leauing this argument let vs pursue that

which we began to say concerning the principall differences of the circular motion of the heauens

wherefore the first and vniuersall motion of all the spherick world is that which we see is made round about the earth

from the east by south towards the west alwaies with one and the same orderly celeritie and swiftnes and without any ceasing which performeth his course in a naturall day which is diuided into fower and twenty equall howers as is plainly shewed vnto vs by the ordinarie course of the sunne
so that the whole heauen and each of those celestiall spheres doe followe the saide daily motion though it be not proper to them but accidentall in that they are the parts of the vniuersal world
for as we shal presently see euery sphere hath an other proper and particular motion
but this same whereof we speake doth in such sort by accident agree with all the parts of the world that the most thinne and subtile elements especially fire and the superior region of the aire are in like sort caried away therewith
so likewise doth the sea though it enuironeth not the earth round about in some sort follow this motion by ebbing and flowing euery naturall day not performing an entire reuolution
wherefore nothing but the earth remaineth vnmooueable bicause of the waight and insensible quantitie of it in respect of the whole world as being the center thereof
the stablenesse whereof is very necessarie that so both the vniuersall and each particular motion may be discerned for otherwise there should be a confusion in stead of harmonie
and for this cause many haue supposed that this whole vniuers generally considered is the first very true moouer of the vniuersall motion and not any heauen or particular orb
now for the second kinde of circular motions

it is that which is proper to euery of the eight spheres and celestiall orbs which are the parts of the whole heauen from the firmament to the sphere of the moone
for each of these spheres as is euidently perceiued by the starres enchased therein which can haue no motion but according to their heauen performeth his owne naturall and peculiar motion contrarie to the first and vpon other poles and axes to wit from the west by south towards the east
and the entire reuolutions of those spheres are done and finished in diuers spaces of time to wit of the greater superior more late of the lesse and inferior being next to the elements more soone
for the heauen of fixed stars according to the most likely opinion

and apparent obseruation of astronomers performeth his owne reuolution in thirtie sixe thousand common yeeres without bissext whereof each containeth
naturall daies saturne the highest planet in thirtie yeeres iupiter which hath his circle much lower in twelue mars in two the sunne in
naturall daies almost one fourth part of a day which make vp the time and space of a yeere
for one shall alwaies finde that number of daies being runne out the shadow of the sunne to be such as if you marke it was the yeere before at the very same instant yea to the difference scarce of a minute

whereby it commeth that from fowre yeere to foure yeere is reckoned a bissextile day which serueth to make the yeere answerable to the course of the sunne
the reuolution of whom venus and mercurie do neere approch vnto and for the moone she maketh hirs in seuen and twentie naturall daies and almost one third part of a day so that in so small time shee maketh as much way in regard of vs as saturne doth in thirtie yeeres because he is the farthest from and shee the neerest to the earth which causeth her course to be shorter then any other planet

and this is the consideration which hath giuen occasion to many to cast the distances and spaces which are betweene the spheres saying that there is nineteene times so much distance betweene the sunne and moone as is between the moone and the earth so of the rest
pythagoras himselfe

a man very ingenious counted by his calculation as plinie relateth that there were
stades or furlongs betweene the earth and the circle of the moone and that from the moone to the sunne there were the double of them and betweene the sunne and signes of the zodiacke the triple
now a stade or furlong was measured by the ancients to consist of one hundred fiue and twentie common paces or else of seuen hundreth and fiftie feete
but so certainly to determine of the dimensions and distances betweene the spheres shoulde me thinketh be too great an enterprise for the capacitie of our spirits
yet may the curious by some infallible reason of geometrie or rather by imagined coniectures resolue vpon it
and to conclude our discourse concerning the motions of heauen we see that though by the rapiditie violence of the continuall motion of the first moouer all the spheres are caried away with it in the space of fower and twentie howers from east by south towards the west returning by north or midnight towards the

east

yet neuerthelesse euery one of them hath his proper and particular motion cleane contrarie to the vniuersall that is from the west towards the east
which is chiefly done because that by the reuerberation of these contrarie motions the aire may bee parted and dispersed which otherwise would heape and gather togither and become immooueable and heauie because of the continuall reuolution of the worlde turning alwaies one way
and besides these principall differences of the circular motion of the heauens all the planets haue other motions of farther consideration which are called circuits of the great reuolution and which doe concurre in the great yeere which is taken for the time when all the planets shall fully finish their courses togither
but we haue said enough concerning this matter considering the entent of our discourse wherefore we wil prosecute as briefly as we may the other particularities seruing for the knowledge of the spheres euen so much as we shall hold needfull for our present historie of heauen and earth
then you shall discourse to vs aram of those circles which shew themselues in the sphere and of the diuersitie and disposition of them

of the circles in generall and particularly of the equinoctiall and zodiack and of their signes
chapter

aram

in the sphere of the world are two kinds of circles demonstrated whereof some are named greater

and some lesser circles
they which haue one and common center with the whole heauen are called greater circles and are one equall to another and do diuide the globe into two equall parts
but such circles as haue their centers out of that of the sphere are called lesser circles of which those onely that haue their middle points alike distant from that of the whole heauen are equall one to another being by so much the smaller by how much their center is farther from the center of the whole
and therefore they which haue their centers vnequally distant from that of the heauen are vnequall and that is greater then the rest whose middle point is neerest to that of the sphere and consequently the one is by so much the more vnequall to the other by how much the center of the one is farther

distant from the center of the other
and it is to be noted that all circular motion of any heauen and planet whatsoeuer must be considered and measured by meanes of a greater circle to wit that which is directly placed betweene the poles of the same motion and is equally distant from the same because it is a circle of the greatest circuite and swiftnesse that may be designed by the same motion

but wee must vnderstand that among all the circles there is one part mooueable that is incessantly turning therewith and the other fixt and immooueable seruing for to discerne the better the accidents and effects of the sphericall motions and moouing circles
first then to entreate of the mooueable circles as likewise to prosecute that which wee haue heard in our precedent discourse that there be two principall motions of heauen whereof one is of the vniuersall world making his reuolution from the east towards the west and the other contrarie from west to east as is proper to the planets we must imagine in the sphere of the world two principall circles to wit the equinoctiall or equator seruing for the first of those motions and the zodiack or ecliptick for the second
the equinoctiall then is a great circle

diuiding the totall sphere into two equall parts being placed directly betweene the two poles of the world and equally distant in all parts from them
by the which circle is measured and considered the prime and vniuersall motion of the whole world and consequently the time which is nothing else but the measure of the succeeding of the same motion which is alwaies of one course and quicknes and whereof the said circle is called the equator
vnder which the sunne directly comming which is twise euery yeere the daies are of equall length with the nights throughout the whole world for which cause likewise the same circle is called the equinoctiall that is the circle of equall nights
and the poles thereof are those of the whole world about which the vniuersall and regular motion is made whereof that which is in the north parts is called by the same name

either the pole artick or septentrionall which is alwaies seene where we inhabite and about which there is a certaine figure of seuen fixed stars turning circularly which is called the great beare or most co~monly the waine
and the other pole opposite to this is named the pole antartick or meridionall being towards the south is alwaies hid from vs
for the second great and principall circle

among those which are mooueable

it is nominated the zodiack or eclipticke or else the oblique circle and it is that wherein the twelue signes are placed of diuers names and figures being indeed obliquely placed in respect of the equinoctiall and poles of the world so that one halfe thereof extendeth towarde the north or pole artick and the other moitie declineth toward the south and pole antarticke
and this circle is the very path way of the sunne and rest of the planets all which keepe their peculiar motion in the zodiack to the end to distribute their influence and vertue vpon the earth for the life and production of all things
now the zodiack both diuide in the midst the equinoctiall and is thereby diuided also into two equall halfes

and the points of these intersections are called equinoctiall points because the sunne being in them they daies are vniuersally equall to the nights as also the points of the foresaide zodiack which are meanes betweene the said equinoctiall points are named sunsteads or tropicks that is to say stations or reuersions of the sunne bicause that it arriuing about those points the meridian altitudes and artificiall daies do long remaine in one estate without any notable variation as also for that comming to the said sunsteads it returneth towards the equinoctiall
and thus the two equinoctiall points and the two sunsteads diuide the zodiack into fowre parts answerable to the fowre seasons of the yeere which are the spring sommer autumne

and winter
of which the spring time beginneth at that equinoctiall point from which the sunne by his proper motion commeth and enclineth towards the highest point called verticall
sommer beginneth at the sunstead next following
autumne at the other equinoctiall and winter at the second sunstead so that the said equinoctiall points are called by the names of the foresaid seasons
and because that euery naturall action hath beginning middle and end

therefore each of these said quarters of the zodiack is diuided into three equall parts and so the whole zodiack into twelue which parts are named signes because they signifie and designe the most notable and apparant mutations of things heere belowe being chiefly caused by the yeerely course of the sunne along the zodiack
euery of the said seasons of the yeere is likewise diuided into three parts and the whole yeere into twelue called moneths that is to say measures of the time wherein the sun passeth the said twelue signes

and as the twelue moneths haue beene diuided some into thirty and others into thirtie one naturall daies euen so is euery signe parted into thirtie degrees and the whole zodiack into
then euery degree into
prime minuts and euery prime minute into
seconds and so consequently into other subdiuisions so farre as one will
wherein is to be noted that this number of
must alwaies be obserued because it may be diuided into more equall parts then any other number vnder

now forasmuch as the sunne according as it is remooued or approcheth neere the highest points called vertical doth cast foorth his beames more directly obliquely vpon the earth for this cause also the heate and proper action of the starres and planets is more forcible or feeble in things here belowe and according as it findeth them prepared causeth diuers effects
which diuersitie is notoriously apparant from signe to signe
and therefore the twelue signes of the zodiack are called by certaine proper names extracted from the nature and propertie of things correspondent with their said effects

the first signe is nominated aries bicause that the sunne then beginneth to approch to the highest point and the heate thereof doth increase which mixing with the humiditie that the precedent winter had brought in maketh the temperature of the aire hot and moist which agreeth with the nature of a ram
the second signe is called taurus bicause that when the sunne is therein the heate fortifieth it selfe and consumeth the moisture so that the temperature of the aire tendeth somewhat to drinesse which seemeth very answerable to the nature of the bull which is of greater power then that of sheepe
the third signe is named gemini bicause the sunne being therein hath his heat redoubled and amongst all kindes of beastes the males and females haue naturall copulation two and two togither to ingender one like themselues and to continue their kinde
the fourth signe is said to be cancer for euen as the crab goeth backward so the sunne entring into this signe retireth backe towardes the equinoctiall from whence he came making his declinations contrarie to those of gemini
the fift signe is called leo bicause the sunne being therein by the redoubling of his beames the heate is strong and drinesse great euen as the lion is a puissant beast of hot and drie nature
the sixt signe is named virgo for as the virgine is a weake creature and of her selfe barren so the sunne being in this

signe the heate diminisheth and drinesse ruleth whereby the production of things ceaseth and the earth becommeth barren
the seuenth signe hath to name libra bicause the disposition of the aire is then in ballance betweene the wasted heate and coldnes and bicause also the sunne being in this signe the daies and nights are in ballance betweene the decreasing of the one and increasing of the other
the eight is called scorpio bicause that then the colde ruling with drinesse are great enimies to nature and doe corrupt the aire which hath the proper qualitie of hot and moist whereupon ensue plagues and other dangerous diseases which surprise the creature like the venome of a scorpion which lies in his taile and is engendred of corruption
the ninth signe is named sagittarius for the sunne being in it the too much weakened heate is surmounted by cold whereupon there ensue fogs and frosts and other alterations of the aire as hurtfull to creatures as enuenomed arrowes
the tenth signe is nominated capricornus bicause that the sunne entring thereinto is the farthest that all the yeere it can be from the verticall point so that by rigour of the colde mixed with drinesse which hath then full domination as also by reason of the debilitie of heate the disposition of the aire is melancholie retaining the nature of a goate
the eleuenth signe is signified by aquarius bicause then the drinesse is surmounted by the moisture now beginning the cold neuerthelesse remaining wherefore the aire is cold and moist like water and disposed to snowes and raine
the twelfth and last signe is pisces bicause as fishes are colde and moist following naturally the water hauing yet some little naturall heate euen so is the temperature of the aire then cold and moist hauing yet some heate growing by the approch of the sunne to the vernall equinoctiall point so that the cold diminisheth
and thus much concerning the signes of the zodiacke and the names to them ascribed for which cause the fixed starres which are in this circle and comprised within the said signes both of the one side and on the other haue been painted according to the fashion of the saide beasts and their influence iudged from the causes by vs here declared and not that the said signes haue taken their names of the nature and disposition of the said starres
and by this consideration of the propertie of each signe in the zodiacke we learne that by the introduction of one qualitie ensueth the expulsion of the contrarie and by the

augmentation of the one the decrease of the other
which must onely be vnderstood concerning the qualities happening in the aire by the radiation of the sunne onely being strong meane and weake and the disposition of inferiour things without comprising therein the other constellations and aspects of the planets changing greatly altering the said disposition of the aire neither doe we touch the opinions of professors of iudiciall astrologie who for other reasons and principles of the said arte attribute to the same signes other qualities then those that we haue expressed
but from them wee may extract fower triplicities which make the twelue signes correspond with the fower elements to wit gemini cancer leo with the fire pisces aries and taurus with the aire sagittarius capricornus aquarius with water and virgo libra and scorpio with earth
now must we pursue our purpose concerning the circles of the sphere as well great as small mooueable as immooueable the treatise whereof achitob referre to you

of the two great circles named colures and of the fower lesse circles and parallels of the fiue zones of the world and immooueable circles
chap

achitob

besides the two principall mooueable circles which haue beene declared vnto vs in the precedent speech there are also demonstrated in the sphere two other great circles whereof one passeth by the equinoctiall points and the other by the solstists or sunsteads and poles of the zodiacke and both by the poles of the world where they are diuided into three angles
and by this meanes they part as well the equinoctiall as the zodiacke into fower parts the parts whereof answere togither in iust and equall proportion

these two circles haue to name colures that is to say vnperfect because they haue an vnperfect reuolution in turning with the sphere vpon the points of their circumference and not about their proper poles like other circles
one of them then is called the equinoctiall colure and the other the solstitial colure
and the one passeth by the circle of the zodiacke at the beginning of the signes aries libra which are the equinoctiall

signes and the other at the beginning of the signes cancer and capricorne which are the solstitiall signes
and it is to be noted that the arck of the solstitiall colure comprised betweene the equinoctiall and one of the solstists is the measure of the greatest declination of the sunne which must of necessitie be equall to the arck of that colure which is betweene one of the poles of the world and the next pole of the zodiacke
for by how much one greater circle declineth from another by so much the poles of the one are distant from the poles of the other because all greater circles are equall and haue one common center and do equally part themselues and likewise their declination is iust in the midst of their cuttings or intersections

we must also consider in the sphere fower principall lesser and mooueable circles whereof the two first doe limit out the whole obliquenes of the zodiacke and the declination thereof from the equinoctiall as also the conuersions of the sunne towards it
and these circles are nominated tropickes

that is turning or conuertiue because they passe by the two solstists of the zodiacke
that then which passeth by the first point of cancer which is the is called the tropicke of cancer or and that which passeth by the first point of capricorne or is named the or tropicke of capricorne being therefore one equall to another because they are equally distant from the equinoctiall
for the two other lesser circles

they are those which be described about the poles of the world by the poles of the zodiack limiting the deuiation or distance of the said poles and for this cause they are called and do retaine the names of the poles of the world
for one is named the north or and the other the south or being also equall one to another by the same reason as is vnderstood of the tropicks
and you must note that these said fower lesser circles do diuide the whole sphere into fiue parts or principall regions commonly called zones whereto as many parts or diuers regions answere vpon the terrestriall globe

which zones are different as well in figure and greatnes as also in nature or accidental disposition caused chiefly by the radiation of the sunne
the first then of these fiue parts or regions of the sphere is comprehended betweene the two tropicks diuided by the equinoctial in the midst for which cause it is the most ample of all the rest
the two

extremest and smallest are comprised about the poles of the world within the arcticke and antarticke circles wherefore the one is called the north and the other the south zone
and the other two are meanes betweene the greatest which is middlemost and the two extremest or least which are about the poles of the world being larger towards the two tropickes then towards the polary circles which togither are the bou~ds of them
and among these fiue zones which enuiron the earth some parts of them are become habitable

and others not by meanes of the diuers effects caused by the sunne
for the meane region about the equinoctial is for three causes temperate
first because the sun being vnder or about the said equinoctiall it maketh a greater circuit in the vniuersall motion of the whole world and runs faster away for which cause his heat maketh not so great impression vpon the earth
secondly because it passeth suddenly from the south to the north part by reason of the transuers disposition of the zodiacke about the equinoctiall
and thirdly because the daies are there equall with the nights whereby the heate of the one is tempered by the coldnes of the other
but about the tropicks the heat is excessiue in sommer
first because the sunne is then in those stations wherein his shining endureth longer vpon the earth and by reason also that he performeth lesse compasse and passeth slowly away whereby his heat taketh more deepe impression
and besides all this the daies are longer then the nights in such sort that the heat of the one surmounteth the cold of the other
for the two polarie regions and the circumiacent parts it is manifest that they are far out of the funs way whereof ensueth that by the too much oblique radiation thereof heat is there exceeding feeble and cold great and intollerable
finally in the midst or about the two other foresaide regions betweene the equinoctiall and poles of the world the disposition of the aire is temperate as well by reason of the commixture of the heate which is about the tropicks and the cold which is about the polarie circles as bicause of the meane radiation of the sunne that is to say neither too direct nor too oblique
so then the middle zone comprised betweene the two tropicks is temperate about the midst intemperate through excessiue heate about the extremities thereof whereupon it is in this part called the bicause the sun doth alwaies turne about it
and the two polarie and extreme regions are perpetually

intemperate through colde
and the two meanes are temperate about the midst and in one extreme thereof intemperate with heate and in the other with cold
but thereof followes not that all intemperate places should be inhabitable but onely very hard and difficult to dwell in

hitherto hath our talke been concerning the principall and mooueable circles of the sphere

now let vs intreate of the immooueable
euen then as the zodiack equinoctiall are the two chiefest amongst the mooueable circles so are the horizon and meridian amongst the immooueable
by the horizon is meant a great circle imagined in heauen which diuideth that halfe of heauen which is seene from that halfe which is not seene that is which parteth the hemisphere vnder vs from that which is aboue vs
and to this same circle one of the poles is alwaies the verticall point and the other pole is the point opposite
wherefore by how much each place hath his point higher by so much doth the horizon of each place differ for there are so many horizons as there be particular places
and therfore the horizon of those which haue the verticall point that is the point which is right ouer head vnder the equinoctiall is named the right horizon bicause it must needes passe by the poles of the world and diuideth the equinoctiall at right angles one equall to another
whereupon it is also called a right sphere bicause it seemeth to bee rightly placed in respect of that horizon and the starres to make their motion directly by the vniuersall motion of the sphere
but the horizon of those whose zenith is out of the equinoctiall towards the one or other pole of the world is called oblique bicause that one of the poles to wit that which the verticall point is next to is eleuated aboue the said horizon and the other pole is so much depressed vnder the same which for this occasion doth diuide the equinoctiall at oblique angles vnequal one to another
wherefore also the sphere is said to be oblique bicause it is obliquely placed in respect of the said horizon and the starres turne obliquely in the vniuersall motion
and therefore it is euident that all direct horizons are of one selfesame disposition but amongst the oblique there are as many differences of obliquitie as are distances betweene the verticall point and the equinoctiall or as the eleuation of the pole is diuers aboue them
for the meridian it is a great circle which passeth by the poles of the world and that point of heauen which is directly

ouer our heads wheresoeuer we are and diuideth both the equinoctiall and horizon at right angles

separating also halfe the sphere being east from the halfe that is west
the poles whereof are the intersections of the horizon and of the equinoctiall
and bicause it diuideth the naturall day and the artificiall day wherof we must hereafter intreate into two euen parts it is called the meridian or midday circle which is as much to say as the circle
for when soeuer the sunne is come from the east to this circle aboue the horizon it is high noone when to the opposite point vnder the horizon it is midnight
all places then according as they are more orientall or more occidentall haue their proper meridian and they which ly alike east or west haue one selfe meridian though they be not alike distant from the equinoctiall
and you must vnderstand that euery meridian is a right horizon to some and euery right horizon a meridian

now do next proceede to the other immooueable circles of the sphere without which no man can vnderstand the making and vse of many instruments especially of the astrolobe which representeth the sphere reduced into a plaine forme
of these circles some are called verticall some parallels of heights then are there circles of howers those which distinguish the twelue houses of heauen

the verticall are certaine great circles which proceed from the vertical point whereof they are named aboue the horizon which they diuide into
degrees and of the number of those si the meridian
but there is one especially called the verticall circle which in the right sphere is the equinoctiall it selfe to wit that which diuideth the meridian at right angles and the horizon also in the same points where it is separated from the equinoctiall which circle with the meridian designeth the fower principall angles of the world that is the exact points of east west north and south diuiding both the horizon and vpper hemisphere into fower parts one equall to another
and the other verticall circles serue for to discerne in what quarter of the horizon the stars rise and set or in what part of the superior hemisphere the same stars are eleuated aboue the horizon and how much they are distant from the meridian or from the foresaid principall verticall circle

now for the parallels of heights they be circles being euery where alike distant one from another diuided from the horizon from degree to degree towards the whereof the greatest is next the horizon

and the least of all neerest to the said superior point
which parallels doe diuide euery quadrant of the foresaid verticall circles comprehended betweene the verticall point and the horizon into
degrees and are also diuided by the same circles into
degrees
moreouer they determine or distinguish the heights of the starres which are aboue the horizon as well in the east as in the south and west
for by the height is to be considered of euery starre you must vnderstand the arch of the verticall circle which passeth by the center thereof comprised betwixt the horizon and the parallell of the same passing also by the same center
whereupon ensueth that in all verticall circles which are equally distant from the meridian the stars haue equal heights which commeth to passe in time equally distant or reckoned from
and the greatest altitude that any starre may haue is when it commeth vnder the meridian circle at what howersoeuer it be
now must we looke vpon the hower circles and those which diuide the twelue houses of heauen whereof aser impose the taske on you to discourse

of the and what is done by them in and of the circles which diuide the twelue houses of heauen
chap

aser

sith that time is nothing else but the measure of the prime and regular motion of the whole world as we haue heretofore declared and that this motion is measured by the equinoctiall as out of our precedent speech may be excerped thereupon it is consequent that the equinoctiall is the measure of time and that the entire reuolution of the same circle comprehendeth the naturall day whereupon ensueth that the diuision of the one must needes be answerable to the parting of the other

now the equinoctiall is diuided into twelue signes and each signe into thirtie degrees as is the zodiacke
therefore parting each signe into two halfes the whole equinoctiall shal be diuided into
equal portions containing each
degrees which are the measures of
such howers of a naturall day
you must therefore imagine by the twelue greater circles therein comprising the meridian which passe

through the poles of the world and by the distinctions of the foresaid fower and twentie parts of the equinoctiall so that each quarter thereof

comprehended betweene the meridian and the horizon is diuided by the said circles into six of the foresaid parts making togither the number of foure twenty howerly spaces whereof the saide circles receiue their name
amongst which that which diuideth the meridian at right angles passeth by the intersections of the equinoctiall and horizon and maketh the distinction of sixe howers both before and after noone
so that there is no greater circle which may bee deuided into fower and twentie equall parts by the but onelie the equinoctiall except it be conioined therewith
wherefore as well the oblique horizon as the verticall circle which cutteth the meridian at right angles is diuided into fower twenty vnequall parts which are so much the more one differing from the other as the poles of the world are eleuated aboue or vnder fiue and fortie degrees and though these parts are vnequall yet the spaces of the howers are equall in the said circles because they proceed of the equall parts diuisions of the equinoctiall yet so that the saide equall spaces aswell in the horizon as in the verticall circle which are equally distant from the meridian are equall as well on the one side as on the other and are by so much greater the one then the other by how much they are farther distant from the same meridian
wherefore those next to the intersections of the horizon and the foresaid vpper circle are the greatest of all and in the same sort are the fowre quarters of the said circles diuided
it is to be noted that euery right horizon is ioined with the of sixe howers without any diuision and the verticall circle ioined with the equinoctiall is diuided equally as it is
but in the most oblique scituation of the sphere where one of the poles of the world is the superior point or zenith the horizon is right with the equinoctiall and diuided like it by the said howerly circles which are all of them then called verticall circles

those dials therefore or quadrants which are made to take the height of the sunne are composed by diuers considerations for some depend vpon sections made by the foresaid as those which are grauen on the face of the equinoctiall and are therefore called or else vpon the plaine of the horizon which are named horizontall or vpon

the face of the which diuideth the meridian at right angles which are erected towards the south and are nominated verticall
in which three sorts of dials the are noted by straight lines proceeding out of one onely point which representeth the center of the world and the index or gnomon to shewe those howers representeth the axis vpon which the heauen maketh his first and vniuersall motion
the other depend vpon the coextension or impression of the foresaid as those which are described vpon the face of the meridian circle and are erected towards the east or west being named laterall and can serue but onely for the forenoone or afternoone or such as are made vpon the face of the sixe howers circle hanging and inclining towards the south by the axtree of the world for this cause named
in which two sorts of dials the are designed by parallell lines and the indexes by the axtrees of the circles or else they are described and erected perpendicularly vpon the face of the said circles
and in all the dials and such like the are vnequall and haue notable difference one from another except those onely which are drawne vpon the face of the equinoctial bicause it alone is diuided into euen portions by the whereof the proiection in plano must obserue equall spaces
and by consequence it is euident that only equinoctiall and horizontall dials serue for all howers of the day at all times of the yeere and the verticall onelie sixe howers before and sixe howers after noone the ten howers fiue before and fiue after noone and the laterall from sunne rising till noone or from noone till sunne set
moreouer it is manifest that all these dials except the equinoctiall dials must be described particularly according to the proper eleuation of the pole aboue euery oblique horizon bicause the and indexes are diuers according to the varietie of the said
but the equinoctiall dials may serue vniuersally in applying them according to the height of the equinoctiall aboue euery oblique horizon because those spaces are equall and of one sort

but breaking off this talke of dials

let vs now entreate of those circles which with the horizon and meridian diuide the whole heauen into twelue equall portions which are named the twelue houses of heauen
first then is to be noted that as the

sunne and the rest of the planets in performing their reuolution by their proper and peculiar motion in the zodiack according to the radiation of the sunne being notably diuersified from signe to signe and according to the disposition of elementarie substances do imprint their influence and vertue diuersly causing sundry effects vpon the earth so likewise these faire celestiall lights being turned euery day about the earth by the first and vniuersall motion of the whole sphere do make the verie like mutation of their power and influence vpon the terrestriall globe by the variation of their shining as may be marked from signe to signe either mounting aboue or descending vnder the horizon

for this cause you must diuide the entire sphere of the world in regard of the horizon being right or oblique into twelue equall parts or signes which are called houses that is notable mansions of heauen
which is done by the proper horizon and meridian with fowre other great circles and particular horizons passing by the two intersections of the said proper horizon and meridian circle and diuiding euery quarter of the principall verticall circle which maketh right angles with the said meridian comprehended betweene the said meridian and the horizon into three signes which amount togither to the number of twelue
and these houses or notable mansions of heauen begin at the east side of the horizon and the first sixe are distributed vnder it and the other sixe aboue it according to the order of the twelue signes of the zodiack and the proper motion of the planets which is from the west eastward
so that by the horizon with the meridian the fower principall angles of the saide houses are distinguished that is the east angle which is named the horoscope being the beginning of the first house the west angle of the horizon whereat beginneth the seuenth house and the midde heauen which is the third angle and there beginneth the tenth house and for the fourth the angle vnder earth where beginneth the fourth house by the meridian

euen so as we haue heard as the colures distinguish the two equinoctiall points and the two solstists or sunsteads of the zodiack which are the foure notable points therof agreeing with the fower angles aforesaid
for the horoscope agreeth with the vernal equinoctial point with the sommer solstice the west angle with the autumne equinoctiall point and the angle vnder the earth with the winter solstice and so consequently

the fowre quarters of the foresaid vertical circle are correspondent to those of the zodiack which make the fowre seasons of the yeere and each whereof is diuided into three signes as also euery quarter of the said circle into three houses equall to those signes so that the sixe houses which are aboue the horizon do accord with the sixe septentrionall signes of the zodiack and the sixe other houses with the south or meridionall signes
and these twelue houses of heauen are called by diuers names for those fowre which begin at the fowre foresaid angles are named angularie houses the next fowre following are called succedent and the rest cadent
moreouer we must note that in the right sphere each of these houses comprehendeth one signe of the equinoctiall because this circle is ioyned with the foresaid verticall and all the circles which distinguish them passe by the poles of the world because they consist in the foresaid sections of the horizon and meridian which hath caused many to erre in this point who would make the distinction of the said houses in the equinoctiall both in the oblique and in the right sphere lightly following the authoritie of ptolomie not noting how that author had the sphere right to him so that in that respect hee spake well referring the manner how to distinguish the saide houses in the oblique sphere to the iudgement of all good astronomers
finally it is to be vnderstood that euery house is diuided into thirtie degrees like the signes of the zodiack and that by other great circles proceeding from the foresaid intersections of the meridian and horizon
moreouer you must note that euery great circle which passeth by the said intersections and by the true place of any starre which is proposed is called the horizon thereof for all the foresaid circles as already hath beene declared are but oblique horizons except the meridian which representeth the right horizon
then to erect the twelue houses of heauen is nothing else but to finde the twelue principall intersections of the zodiack and of the foresaid circles which is performed by the ascensions of the arcks of the zodiack aboue each of the said circles whereof we must presently entreat not regarding which arck of the said zodiack is contained in each of the said houses
wherefore amana let vs heare you discourse concerning the ascensions and descensions both of the starres and of the signes of the zodiack

of the ascensions and descensions of the starres and of the signes and other arcks of the zodiack and of the orientall and occidentall latitude of the sunne or degrees of the zodiack
chapter

amana

vve should reape small fruite and commoditie of things hitherto by vs entreated of in the sphere if we should be ignorant in the ascensions and descensions both of the starres and signes and other arcks of the zodiack according to the vse and principall consideration of good astronomers who marke what hower the starres ascend aboue the horizon or descend vnder it whether it be day or night and how long time the signes and other arcks of the zodiack are eleuated aboue the said horizon or depressed vnder it not respecting the simple apparition or absence of the said starres and signes which diuers do vsually obserue and which the poets doe commonly mention when they would expresse and describe the seasons and moneths and other parts of the yeere

to enter then into the substance of our discourse we must vnderstand by the ascension of any starre that we propose the arck of the equinoctiall comprised according to the order of the twelue signes of the zodiack betweene the beginning of the said signes and the orientall part of the horizon then when the center of the said starre attaineth to the same part of the horizon
and consequently the descension of the same starre is the arck of the said equinoctiall comprehended according to the order of the said signes betweene the beginning of them and the west part of the horizon when the same horizon passeth by the center of the saide starre
which consideration is euery whit agreeable in each part of the zodiack or elsewhere
for the stars are in this place taken for points howsoeuer they be of notable greatnes wherefore it is necessarie that their ascensions and descensions should be measured and discerned by the arcks of the equinoctiall hauing some conuenient beginning common to all horizons as the vernall equinoctiall point is the beginning of the signes of the zodiack
and by the same arcks taken as aforesaid

and for that the equinoctial is the measure of time one may know at what hower and minute the starre riseth aboue the horizon or descendeth vnder it or attaineth to the meridian circle either aboue or vnder the earth by the first and regular motion of the whole world
and you must note that the said ascensions or descensions are called right ones when they are referred to the right horizon or to the meridian circle which retaineth such qualities in all obliquenes of the sphere as the right horizon doth and consequently they are called oblique when they are referred to the oblique horizon

for the ascensions of the signes of the zodiack very necessarie to be vnderstood for to measure and know the quantitie of the artificiall daies nights in all places of the earth as hereafter we may declare it is to be noted

that the ascension of euery signe is nothing else but the arck of the equinoctial eleuated togither with the said signe aboue the horizon as the descension is the arck of the said equinoctiall which descendeth vnder the horizon equally with the said signe wherefore according as this arck coascending or descending with any signe is more great or lesse so likewise the time that the said signe shall bee eleuated aboue the horizon or depressed vnder it shall be longer or shorter
and it is to be noted that that signe of the zodiack wherewith is eleuated one signe of the equinoctiall precisely is said to haue an equall ascension omit heere to specifie the accidents and differences of the ascensions and descensions of the signes which are particularly considered both in the right and in the oblique sphere which are common to the arcks of the zodiack which arcks are particles of the fower quarters of the said zodiack and do begin at the equinoctiall points and solstists for our intent is not particularly to discourse of euery thing that astronomers teach concerning the sphere and which cannot be vnderstood but by demonstration of the materiall sphere or by the figures placed in their bookes which it is necessary to marke diligently to conceiue this part of the mathematicks
but we will heere summarily and grossely run ouer the most notable points required for our instruction in the vniuersall description of the whole world and of the most noble things which come to passe heere below by reason of the prime and vniuersall motion of heauen
yet may we not steppe out of this matter without considering in the ascensions and discensions of the sunne that is

concerning euery degree of his way which is the zodiacke the orientall and occidentall latitude of him and which he obtaineth from degree to degree in the zodiacke either in rising aboue or descending vnder the horizon
but for the other planets or fixed starres no mention is made of them concerning this point

it is then most manifest by that which we haue alreadie heard that the intersections of the right or oblique horizon with the equinoctiall verticall circle which diuideth the meridian at right angles are in the midst equally distant between the intersections of the said horizon of the meridian and that they designe the points of the true east west
and bicause that the zodiack declineth from the equinoctiall partly towards the pole arctick and partly towards the antartick the sun doth not rise in the true point of east nor set in the direct point of west but when it is vpon the equinoctiall points which are the intersections of the zodiacke and equinoctial
for while the sunne is in the north part of the zodiacke he riseth and setteth on the north side and when he is in the south part he riseth and setteth on the south side and that in diuers distances from the true east and west according as the true place of the sunne declineth more or lesse from the equinoctiall
the arcke then of the horizon which is betweene the true east and the center of the bodie of the sunne when it is come to the easterne part of the horizon is called the orientall latitude of the sunne and that which is comprised betweene the direct west and that same center when it is in the west part of the horizon is called the occidentall latitude of the sunne
as also the latitude of the starres is taken from the zodiacke towards the one or other pole thereof
for all stars both fixed and wandring hold their longitude and latitude of the zodiacke as of the equinoctiall their declinations ascensions and descensions
so that the latitude of the sunne both orientall and occidentall is necessarily northerly one halfe of the yeere and the other halfe it is southerly
and likewise the orientall latitude is equall to the occidentall in one day
and bicause the variation of each latitude proceedeth of the diuersitie of the sunnes declinations they are therefore such on the septentrionall part as on the meridionall
consequently you must note that in the right sphere the foresaid orientall or occidentall latitude is such without difference as is the declination of the sunne bicause the right horizon passeth by the poles of the world and

sheweth both the one and other
but in the oblique sphere those latitudes are greater then the declinations of the sunne and so much the greater and more different as the pole of the world is eleuated aboue the oblique horizon and the place of the sunne declineth from the equinoctiall
so that the greatest are those of the solstists which doe most decline from the equinoctiall and besides these there are fower points in the zodiacke which haue equall latitude both orientall and occidentall that is two on the north side and two on the south side
but thus much may suffice concerning this matter for our purpose
and that we may not swerue from the substance of our former discourse it will be good for vs to intreate of the daies both naturall and artificiall which are caused by the prime and regular motion of the whole sphere with the nights likewise as you aram can manifest vnto vs

of the naturall and artificiall daies and of the nights of their diuersitie and cause
chap

aram

amongst the most excellent and things which depend vpon the first and vniuersal motion of the whole heauen and vpon that which hath been expounded in our forepassed talke there appeereth next to be handled the vnderstanding of the greatnes and quantitie of the daies and the partes of them called howers as also of the heights of the sunne aboue the horizon and of the shadowes as well right as oblique
beginning then with the daies you must note that some are called naturall some artificiall daies which with vs are named properly daies though indeede they be but parts of naturall daies and so of nights

now the naturall day is nothing but the time of the entire reuolution of the bodie of the sunne about the world made by the naturall and proper motion of the vniuersall sphere which reuolution must alwaies begin at the meridian circle and comprehend the time which is from one noone till the next ensuing
but bicause the sunne this while goeth contrarie in his owne peculiar course the point of the equinoctiall which is vnder the meridian with the sunne performeth his reuolution sooner then the sunne it selfe
wherefore you must adde to the entire reuolution of the equinoctiall the ascension

being taken in the right sphere from the part of the zodiacke which the sunne hath passed that while to haue the entire reuolution of the sunne and the true measure of the naturall day
for all accidents of ascensions which happen in the right horizon are common to euery meridian circle in the right or oblique sphere whereupon ensueth that the true naturall daies are vnequall one to another both bicause of the proper motions of the sunne as also bicause of the said ascensions taken in the right sphere
for the sunne by reason of the obliquenes of the zodiacke declining on either side from the equinoctiall which onely is the measure of time is irregular in his owne proper motion and performeth not euery naturall day a degree precisely but sometimes a little more sometimes a little lesse
and though it should make a degree iust yet would not the ascension in the right sphere be equall
for these causes then the true naturall daies are vnequall
but this inequalitie is scarcely to be perceiued by vulgar iudgement and sensible obseruation
moreouer it is to be vnderstood that forasmuch as the motions of the planets and the middle coniunctions and oppositions of the sunne moone cannot bee reduced into tables nor calculated but by equall daies and euen reuolutions of times there must be assumed for this cause certaine naturall daies one like alwaies to another which are called middle or meane daies containing each the entire reuolution of
degrees of the equinoctiall and aboue that
minutes and almost eight seconds of a degree which make vp the quantitie of the regular and middle motion of the sunne correspondent to one of the said euen and meane naturall daies according to which daies the tables of the foresaid motions are composed and calculated
and by this meanes the proposed terme of an entire yeere is reduced into true natural daies which of astronomers is called the equation of the daies

for the artificiall day thereby is vnderstood that part of the naturall day which the sunne maketh passing from the east by south to the west through the proper and vniuersall motion of the whole world during which time the sunne illuminateth the superior part of the horizon for which occasion the said part of the naturall day is properly termed day
and that which remaineth thereof being comprised betweene the west to the east passage of the sunne is named night during which time the shadow of the earth is aboue the said horizon in forme of a round pyramis

which doth then depriue that superior part of the light and shining of the sunne whereby the darknes is caused which is called night
and also the two twylights that is

the cleerenesse which we see before sunne rising and after sunne setting are parts of the night
for the true artificiall day beginneth when the sunne is in the east part of the horizon and endeth when he passeth to the west
and these daies and nights are called artificiall bicause that according to the diuers and artificiall situation of the sphere and according to the true place of the sunne in the zodiacke they doe differ in quantitie one from another
to vnderstande which varietie you must knowe

that in all artificiall daies of what length soeuer they bee there rise aboue the horizon sixe signes of the zodiacke beginning at the true place of the sunne and the other sixe signes which begin at the opposite point do rise in the night time bicause that the zodiack and horizon are great circles of the sphere which do alwaies diuide one another equally
and according as with the sixe eleuated signes by day or night any part or quantitie of the equinoctiall doth arise aboue the horizon either more or lesse by so much the artificiall daies and nights are of shorter or longer continuance so that the ascension of the eleuated signes by day is the true measure of the artificiall day and the ascension of the other eleuated signes by night is the measure thereof
because then that in the right sphere togither with the moitie or one halfe of the zodiack wheresoeuer it begin the moity of the equinoctial doth precisely rise aboue the horizon for this cause therefore the artificiall daies are equall to the nights in the said right sphere
so that all the reuolutions of naturall daies comprised betweene the two tropickes are diuided by the right horizon into two iust halfes and at right angles like the equinoctiall
but in the oblique sphere the daies are neuer equall to the nights but twise a yeere that is when the sunne is in the first point of the signe of aries and of libra which points are for this reason called the two equinoctiall points
for in the oblique sphere there are but the two halfes of the zodiacke comprised betwixt the saide equinoctial points which may haue equal ascensions because that the two colures do neuer agree with the horizon which cannot diuide the zodiacke and equinoctiall also into two equall parts togither except in the same equinoctiall points
whereof the one is neuer with the horizon without the other because the

said greater circles are in them diuided into two exact halfes
but out of these equinoctiall points while the sunne is in that halfe of the zodiacke that declineth from the equinoctiall towards the pole which is eleuated aboue the horizon that is from the by the to the the artificiall daies are longer then the nights
and during the time that the sunne is in the other part of the said zodiacke which declineth towards the opposite pole which is depressed vnder the said horizon the nights are longer then the daies which inequalitie is so much the more by how much the sunne is neerer to the solstists and the sphere is more obliquely placed in respect of the horizon
so that the artificiall daies encrease from the by the to the sommer solstist do decrease from the same by the to the
do not heere particularize the diuersitie of daies which commeth to passe all the yeere long from degree to degree being a thing little necessary for the substance of our discourse and which they may easily learne that will studie vpon the astronomicall sphere but that we may finish this day without going from our sphericall matter let vs speake somewhat concerning the howers of the day and heights of the sunne and of his shadowes the declaration whereof commit achitob to you

of equall and vnequall temporall and artificiall howers of the heights of the sunne aboue the horizon and of his right and reuerse shadowes
chapter

achitob

hauing entreated of naturall and artificiall daies it now resteth that we say somewhat concerning the parts of them which are called howers
euen as then there are two principall and great circles in the sphere the zodiacke and the equinoctiall so likewise are there two maner of howers one sort are equall and naturall taken from the equinoctiall the other vnequall temporall or artificiall deriued from the zodiacke

equall howers are spaces of time measured by the ascension or reuolution of one halfe signe that is of
degrees of the equinoctiall
for time must

be diuided according to this circle which is the measure thereof
and though the equinoctiall be first diuided as euerie other circle into twelue equall parts called signes and each of those into thirtie degrees like the zodiacke yet neuertheles because that each signe demaundeth more time to be eleuated aboue the horizon then the facilitie of distinction and supputation of time requireth therefore is euerie signe diuided into two equall parts
and so in the whole reuolution of the equinoctiall are
halfe signes of
degrees a peece which make the distinctions and measures of
howers diuided by the whereof we haue heretofore spoken
which howers we call equall as wel by reason of the equalitie of the
halfe signes as also because that one requireth no more time to be eleuated aboue the horizon then the other
and for that the equinoctiall is the measure of the regular and naturall motion of the whole world and that euerie signe is measured naturally and commonly by the said equall howers they are therefore called naturall and common howers
we must know then that the sunne maketh his entire reuolution about the earth betweene one noone and the next following according to the naturall daies in
howers and one fifteenth part of an hower because the same reuolution comprehendeth the whole equinoctiall which is the measure of
howers and
minutes and
seconds besides which are almost one degree which is the fifteenth part of the measure of one equall hower

concerning vnequall howers

they are referred to the zodiacke being in number
that is twelue of the artificiall day and twelue of night
and the begin at and those of night at
and they be all vnequall one to another whereby they haue their name
which that we may well vnderstand we must note that in all artificiall daies and nights of what quantitie soeuer they be there riseth aboue the horizon one halfe of the zodiacke comprehending sixe signes which begin in day at that degree where the sun is and at night in that degree which is diametrally opposite and thus there are eleuated by day twelue halfe signes as many by night
and as one halfe signe of the equinoctiall maketh the space of an euen hower so one halfe signe of the zodiacke maketh the space of an vnequall hower
whereby appeereth that in each day and night there are twelue vnequall howers in the day and twelue in the night

and that these howers must be vnequall one to another it appeereth in this because that the zodiacke by reason of the obliquenes thereof cannot be the measure of time but the equinoctiall onely
wherefore it is necessarie that the time of the saide howers should be measured by the arcks of the equinoctiall coascending aboue the horizon togither with euerie halfe signe of the zodiack contayning fifteene degrees
and for that the arcks of the zodiacke which are equall cannot haue equall ascensions euen in the right sphere it is necessarie that the said twelue howers both of day and night should be vnequall one to another and by so much the more vnequall by how much more the pole is eleuated aboue the horizon according to the diuersitie of the artificiall daies and nights whereof they likewise are called artificiall howers
they are also named planetarie and temporall for that they are taken in the way of the planets which is the zodiacke and also because the ancients haue assigned the time of the seuen naturall daies of the weeke to the domination of the seuen planets attributed to the said vnequall howers and haue appointed to the said naturall daies the names of those planets which raigne the first vnequall hower of the artificiall day
but leauing this discourse we must now entreat of the altitudes of the sunne and of his shadowes according as hath beene declared in our antecedent speech

that we may better then vnderstand the reason of shadowes we must first haue knowledge of the altitudes of the sunne aboue the horizon bicause that the diuersitie of shadowes proceedeth from the varietie of those heights

now by the height of the sunne is vnderstood the arck of the verticall circle which passeth by the center of the bodie of the same sunne being comprised betweene the same center and the horizon and distinguished by the parallell of the same horizon which passeth togither with the same center as heretofore hath been related
so that the height of the sunne increaseth from sunne rising till noone and proportionally decreaseth from noone till sunne set
so that the greatest altitude that the sunne may haue in an artificiall day is at the noone hower wherefore it is called the meridian altitude
which surmounteth the height of the equinoctiall in the oblique sphere by the quantitie of the declination of the sunne so long time as he is in that part of the zodiacke inclining towards the pole which is eleuated aboue the horizon and is lesse then

the height of the equinoctiall by the same quantitie when the sunne is in the other moitie of the zodiacke which inclineth towards the opposite pole
so that the least altitude that the sunne may haue is vnder the winter solstice and the greatest is when he is in the summer solstice
but the sunne being in the equinoctiall points his meridian altitude differeth not in the oblique sphere from the height of the equinoctiall
whereupon ensueth that in all the degrees of the zodiacke which are alike distant from the one or other solstice the sunne hath one selfesame meridian altitude
and thereupon ensueth that in all howers whereof the one is before noone and the other after and equally distant from noone as are ten a clocke in the morning and two a clocke after noone the sunne hath one selfesame altitude which is the cause that in all sunne dials being composed by helpe of the said howers as the old quadrants are the serue indifferently as well for before as after noone
and bicause that the altitudes of the sunne varie according to the obliquenes of the sphere the said sunne dials cannot serue generally but onely to that polarie eleuation whereunto the altitudes of the sunne haue been calculated
concerning shadowes they are made by meane of bodies exposed against the sunne

and of those some are called right shadowes and some reuerse shadowes
the right shadow is that which is caused by interposition of the shadowing bodie rightly erected vpon the horizon and the reuerse shadow is that which proceedeth from euery shadowing bodie equally distant from the said horizon
so that the right shadow reacheth out at length vpon the horizontall superficies and the reuerse shadow is turned ouer perpendicularly aboue the said horizon
whereby it is manifest that right shadowes are infinite and reuerse none at all either at sunne rising or sunne set
againe right shadowes decrease by little and little from sunne rising till noone and doe proportionally increase from noone till sunne set to which the reuerse shadowes are contrarie
so that the least right shadow and the greatest reuerse shadow that can be in any day whatsoeuer is at noonetide
and you must note that the sunne being eleuated aboue the horizon more the
degrees euery shadowing body being directly erected vpon the said horizon surmounteth his right shadow but euery reuerse shadow surpasseth his shadowing bodie which causeth it
and when the sunne is raised lesse

then
degrees the contrarie commeth for the right shadow exceedeth his shadowing bodie and the shadowing bodie surpasseth the reuerse shadow
but if the sunne be precisely
degrees high then all shadowing bodies are equall to their shadowes both right and reuerse
from which equalitie is extracted the geometricall square which is set in quadrants or vpon the backe of the astrolobe by which are measured by meanes of the shadowes or visuall lines representing the saide shadowes all lengths heights and depths by reason that the two sides of the said square which meete at right angles in the center of the instrument represent two shadowes one equall to another
yet geographers doe commonly vse but right meridian shadowes to know in what part of the world the regions of the earth consist and how farre they decline from the equinoctiall which shadowes doe varie lesse about the solstists then about the equinoctiall points like to the altitudes of the sunne
but wee haue said enough concerning this matter and to morrow we will prosecute our first discourse concerning the celestiall world now intreating of the substance and nature of heauen and of the particular effects of the sphericall bodies in things here below whereof you aser shall begin to discourse

aser

being this day to intreate of the substance and nature of heauen and of the particular effects of the sphericall bodies in things here below we shall make more easie entrance thereto if we first begin with some briefe consideration concerning all essences
first then will we propound this principle that among all creatures in heauen and earth some are spirituall and the rest corporall
by the spirituall we meane those that haue no bodie and cannot be perceiued by corporall senses as are angels or diuels and the soules or spirites of men and by the corporall wee meane all other creatures that are visible and sensible to the senses of our bodies
now of these some are without life

and the rest liue
and amongst those which are without life there is a difference in two points one is in that some haue naturall motion and the rest haue not
and amongst those which haue this motion some are mutable and corruptible and subiect to change and the rest are immutable incorruptible persisting alwaies in their estate during the course of this world
stones mettals minerals and such like creatures are of the number of those that haue neither life nor any naturall moouing whatsoeuer but like the earth it selfe
the water aire winde and fire are creatures which though they haue not life yet haue they moouing but they are subiect vnto corruption as are all other creatures composed of the elements whether they retaine life or not
for by reason that they are compounded of matters and contrarie qualities they doe at length corrupt and are changed not in regarde of their first nature and substance which perisheth not

though it change formes but returneth alwaies into the same elements

whereof euerie compound consisteth
and though stones and mettals be exceeding hard yet are they not exempt from corruption but are consumed by vsage yea euen gold and siluer which are the most precious mettals and of so excellent temper that they resist fire
but the celestiall bodies whereof we entreat now consist of such matter nature and substance that being in perpetuall motion they euer perseuere in their entire and first forme not being subiect to any change in their bodies nor any way consuming like to the other creatures winch are vnder them

but what this matter or substance is hath beene much disputed on amongst the most learned
for some philosophers haue affirmed that the heauens starres and planets which we behold are compounded of the same elements whereof all other creatures are made but yet of the most pure parts and portions of them and render this reason viz that they could not be visible if they were not created of visible matter
for none can make a visible thing of an inuisible
whereupon they conclude that there is in the composition of celestiall bodies some portion of earth and water which are visible elements and more water then earth because it is more pure and cleere then the earth is and because it hath motion
and in that they are most splendant cleere and mooueable they attribute the principall cause thereof to the nature of the aire and fire and the most subtile parts of them whereof say they they are singularly composed
but others hold that the heauens consist of another kinde of substance then of the elements which they name a of most rare and different substance from the elementarie and much more excellent and noble
others more cunning finde in the heauens diuers and vnequal substances
whereto may seeme to accord that which americus vespucius hath declared in the discourse of his third nauigation to the indies concerning the magnitude of the stars making mention of three verie great ones called caponi which are not cleere
and many other authors haue noted diuersitie of shining and cleerenes among the stars and that some part of heauen is thicker then the rest
but whatsoeuer may be subtilly inuented in this matter it seemeth verie well that heat is the substance of celestiall bodies which is inseparable from brightnes

which is a similitude and semblance of light hauing the substance of it and of heat so annexed

with it selfe that it is almost nothing else
so that the light brightnes heat may be taken for one selfe same substance and matter of heauen and of all the spheres
which we must moreouer note to be so established and ordained by god that the sunne moone and all the other stars and planets are no whit chaunged since the day of their creation any more then their said spheres neither are they more wearied worne

or corrupted for all the labour which they haue performed by the space of so many yeeres then they were the first day of their creation
for you must not holde it for a chaunge and alteration of their natures and qualities in that according to their diuers courses the stars and planets are sometimes far from and sometimes neere to one another and that they haue oppositions coniunctions and diuers and different respects according to the varietie of their motions nor yet for the eclipses of the sunne and moone for such changes are not in their proper bodies substance and qualitie but onely in regard of vs and our sight

but to this constancie stablenes and continuance of the heauens and the celestiall bodies the words of the kingly prophet in the psalmes may seeme to be repugnant

when he saith thou god hast aforetime layd the foundation of the earth and the heauens are the worke of thine hands
they shall perish but thou shalt endure euen they all shall waxe olde as doth a garment as a vesture shalt thou change them and they shall be changed
but thou art the same and thy yeeres shall not faile
also it is written

that the heauens and earth shall passe that the day of the lord shall come like a thiefe in the night and in which the heauens must passe away like a noise of a tempest the elements must melt with heat and the earth with all the workes that are therein shall bee burnt that the heauens being set one fire shall be dissolued

and that we looke for new heauens and new earth according to the promise of god in whom dwelleth righteousnes
all these testimonies yet do not contradict that which we heretofore said concerning the nature of the celestiall bodies
for we refer their stabilitie and continuance to the course of all this great world which god hath ordained and established to endure till the consummation and ending thereof in such sort as he hath declared to vs in his word
moreouer it is one thing to speake of the heauens comparing their nature with that of other visible and corporall

creatures and another thing when we compare them with the nature of god or of his word as the holy scripture co~monly doth

for according to the doctrine thereof a thousand yeers are as one day before god wherfore also this visible frame both celestiall terrestrial is nothing else but as a vesture which weareth waxeth old is clean done after that it is worne al out
and sith that both heauen and earth are created by the word of god

there is no doubt but they shall faile rather then it
for it remayneth for euer like god from whom it proceedeth from all eternitie
there is yet diuersitie of opinions amongst the ancient doctors about the vnderstanding of the holy scripture concerning the matter which we do now treat of
for some indeed say that the heauens shall perish with the rest of the world if it so please the creator and if he will haue it so considering that all creatures both visible and inuisible receiue their essence and continuance not from themselues but from god alone yet for all that do they not thinke that the heauens shall altogither faile nor that god will haue it so
and others maintaine that though the heauens must passe and be dissolued according to the word of god that yet this defect shall not be an entire annihilating but onely a certaine chaunge which shall come to them by which they shall be renued in far more perfection
whereto it seemeth that saint paule agreeth

when he cleerly testifieth concerning all creatures ingenerall that they are subiect to corruption because of the sinne of man and for that cause they doe attend with great desire for the reuelation and redemption of the children of god because they shal not be relieued nor deliuered from the seruitude of corruption to be in the liberty of the glory of them and restored to their integritie till the day ordayned by the creator for the acceptation of his into eternall felicitie
for thereupon ensueth that the heauens and celestiall bodies sigh and grone attending togither with the other creatures this blessed day to be chaunged renued restored which peter likewise teacheth in the place before cited
yea some philosophers accord with him concerning the dissolution of the world by fire but not concerning the cause thereof
for they refer it not to the sinne of man which hath infected the heauen the earth and all things contained therein and put the world into disorder and confusion but to the nature of fire which at last consumeth all and whereof they giue a reason by naturall causes
there are

also some astronomers who affirme that some change may bee perceiued in the spheres and heauenly bodies concerning their courses and ordinarie motions and that they are somewhat different from those which they haue had from the beginning how they waxe weary are worne and become old in their function like to other creatures although this change doth much lesse appeere in them then in the other works of god but wee will leaue this argument to the professors of astrologie
and let it suffice vs for conclusion of this matter to consider what the stabilitie and continuance of men in this world may be seeing that all other creatures must receiue a change and haue an end yea the very heauens themselues
for what are all people in respect of this great vniuers and againe what is euery one of them particularly in comparison of the generalitie of mankinde and of all those which haue already gone before vs but let vs returne to that which concerneth the heauens and sphericall bodies considering that which doth touch their motions besides that which hath beene already declared which amana shall be the subiect for you to discourse vpon

of the motions ingenerall of their first cause and of their vnion in all nature
chapter

amana

eare we enter into the declaration of the subiect which is now propounded vnto vs to discourse vpon concerning heauen my desire is that wee may cal to our memorie that which we haue already heeretofore heard of the nature of the heauens concerning the matter whereof they are compounded and concerning their beautie stabilitie and continuance
for so shall wee reduce the end of our discourse to that principall point whereunto we haue alreadie from the beginning destinated it that is so much the better to acknowledge our god and his prouidence to the end to glorifie him
say then that if we considerately meditate vpon the excellencie of the celestiall bodies we shall therein finde a more expresse image of the eternitie and maiestie of god and of his diuine and immutable nature then in any of all the other visible creatures
moreouer we may accept of them as a testimony and

example not onely of the immortalitie which god hath ordained for mens soules which are spirituall natures but also of that which he hath promised our bodies after our resurrection
for that hee can accomplish his promise we neither may nor must make doubt of if we beleeue that he is almightie no more must we make doubt of his will sith he hath declared it vnto vs in his word
if then he hath beene able to create the heauens and the stars and planets which in them are like splendant precious stones enchased in rings of a matter so firme and durable that it remaineth incorruptible and as it were immortall whether it be taken from the fowre elements or be of an other as we haue already heard it shal be no lesse easie for him to make our bodies incorruptible and immortall hauing deliuered them from corruption and death to which through sinne they were subiect
now let vs pursue that which particularly concerneth the heauen in his motion wherein wee haue notable signes of the glorie and bountie of our god

to vnderstand then sufficiently that which concerneth the present matter we will first note that there be three sorts of motion in the whole world
for there is one which tendeth to the midst and to the center of the vniuers which is in the earth the lowest of elements which motion for that it descendeth is proper to the most heauie elements and to such creatures as do most participate with them
then is there another motion contrarie to the first which alwaies tendeth from the midst and from belowe vpwards and this is proper to the most light elements and to those natures which do neerest approch vnto them and which participate with their qualities more then the rest
but the third kinde of motion is that which neither mounteth nor descendeth either one way or other but goeth round euer turning about the midst like a circle or a wheele
and this is that which is proper to heauen and to the sphericall bodies being most certaine disposed and composed by a most constant and firme order
for though that all the elements and all other creatures which haue motion obserue an order therein yet is it more subiect to change according as the inferior bodies are subiect to the superior
but those haue a more certaine course because they depend not vpon other bodies which are aboue them but immediately vpon god without the meanes of any other corporall nature
and therefore of all the motions which are in all

creatures that of the heauen and heauenly bodies is chiefest and most excellent

for whereas some attribute the motions of the spheres to the angels as if god vsed their ministerie heerein as we haue already declared whether it be so or not yet this is most certaine that the heauens haue their motion immediately from god seeing there are no corporall natures aboue them whereby they may be mooued
for the angels are certaine spirituall creatures on whom if the omnipotent hath imposed this charge we must be content to leaue the vnderstanding thereof to him alone sith it is so much hidden from man
now in that the celestiall bodies and the elements and all creatures haue their proper motion wherein they continue according to the first ordinance established in nature by the soueraigne creator thereof we are much to admire both the cause and effects of such a constancie
intend heere to speake of a neere cause which is a secret amitie ingraffed into euery creature toward his owne nature
for there is a loue

an appetite or vniuersall inclination in all creatures which vrgeth and inciteth them to desire and search that which agreeth with their nature so that there is none so insensible which hath not in it selfe this amitie innate which euer pusheth it to follow the nature thereof and for this cause may we say that all motions proceed from loue
and passing further we may contemplate the loue of god as the eternall source of amitie and inclination of all nature and as the first cause of causes and we shall say that in the same loue god louing himselfe proceeded to his worke which hitherto we haue celebrated and do now meane to prosecute
for sith that god is the soueraigne good that all goodnes is by nature louing it cannot be but he must likewise loue himselfe exceedingly and consequently loue all that which he iudgeth to be good insomuch as it proceedeth from him who is the supreme good and the limit of all goodnes
this loue then not being able to be idle

nor yet the good which it loued would manifest both the one and the other first in the creation of the world namely in that of man and then againe in the restauration and reparation of his fall
so we learne that the first motion whereupon all the rest depend is the loue of god which proceedeth from his bountie which he would not keepe shut vp nor inclosed in himselfe but would manifest and communicate it with his creatures whom he hath created to the end that he might be glorified in them and by them
and as he

loueth them for his owne loues sake and for that they were his worke so hath he set in them the seeds of loue both towards him and towardes themselues according to the diuers nature which he hath conferred vpon them
it is then this naturall loue which constraineth them by a secret feeling of nature imprinted euen in those essences which haue neither reason nor vnderstanding to take delight in that which is agreeable to their creator and to follow his ordinance tending all to him and to that which he loueth bicause it is good and therefore good being done according to his will and bicause it pleaseth him to iudge it and approoue it for such
whereupon we may conclude that loue and amitie is the good by which all creatures haue an accord and agreement first with god their creator and then one with another and that vpon the same cause their conseruation and perfection doth depend

wherefore loue must be the bond and vnion of all the world which is an vniuersall peace and concorde betweene god and all his creatures
for the diuine prouidence hath so disposed all the order of them that they be all conioined one with another by such loue and amitie that euen they which seeme to be cleane contrarie are allied reconciled and vnited togither by those which haue more correspondencie betweene them
in such sort that we may therein behold a very pleasant and perfect harmonie like as in musicke wherein although it seemeth that the notes tunes and sounds be different one to another yet notwithstanding there is such a moderation in them that they yeeld togither a goodly concord and sweete melodie keeping their proportions times and measures
as then by such peace and concord the celestiall spheres follow the generall and common course of the first highest and greatest of all within which they are contained and inclosed performing likewise each of them his particular course without endommaging themselues as we haue heretofore made mention so doe all the elements follow the heauen and obserue their order after it euery one in their degree from the highest to the lowest hauing their motions agreeable to their nature
and euen as liuing creatures haue their agreements and coniunctions one with another euery one in his degree according to the couenant and participation of nature which they haue togither and as they are either neere to or farre off one from another euen so is it in the agreement and consent of nature which is betweene the celestiall bodies and the

elements and all creatures composed of them
for this cause as the angels retaine the first degree among liuing creatures and then man the second next them by reason that in his nature he neerest agreeth with the angels and doth neerest approch them so doth the heauen and celestiall fires retaine the first degree among creatures which are without soule and without life in their proper and conuenient motions according as we haue already declared
and as man doth in some sort hold the middle place betweene the angels and the most perfect beasts so doth fire betwixt the heauen and the aire and as the aire doth keepe the middle place betwixt the fire and water so the water is a meane betwixt the aire and the earth
but these things will claime a fitter place when we come to intreate of the elementarie world
wherefore we will returne to that which onely concerneth the heauenly bodies which forsomuch as we haue saide to be of the number of those creatures which are without life being contrarie to the opinion of the most famous philosophers my minde is that we should consider neerer of this matter bicause that by the excellent politicall and militarie order which is amongst them it seemeth that they are not altogither depriued of life reason and vnderstanding as aram we may learne of you

of the life reason and vnderstanding of the celestiall bodies and of the excellent politicall and militarie order which is amongst them

aram

this being true that all creatures haue a certaine motion agreeable to their nature and a naturall loue which euer vrgeth them to seeke and pursue that which is most naturall for them as hath been already related in our antecedent speech it seemeth that this can hardly come to passe but that there must be in them some kinde of soule and life yea euen in those creatures that are most insensible
and more will say that it is not onely to be presumed that they haue some kinde of life but also a naturall vnderstanding which we may properly name inclination sith there is no essence but can follow his proper course and order in his owne nature and peculiar

motions
for the stones themselues and mettals by a kinde of soule and vegetatiue life doe growe and increase in the earth wherefore it seemeth that they are nourished in the earth like to plants
yet we must note that to speake properly there is neither soule nor life attributed vnto them

for according to the common rule of the learned there are but fower kindes of soules of life except by abuse of the language this name life be taken generally for the estate of all creatures
but when it is taken in his proper signification the soule and life is onely attributed to fower kindes of creatures

that is to herbes trees and plants a nourishing or vegetatiue soule and life to sensitiue plants as oisters cockles a sensitiue to perfect beasts a soule and life cogitatiue or knowing and to men an intellectuall or reasonable soule and life
though therefore that stones and mettals doe increase and grow in the earth yet this is done by addition of matter which is conuerted into their nature rather then by any nouriture which they draw from the earth as plants doe
and therefore when we speake properly of life we must vnderstand something more then that which we simply call
and yet one may sometimes signifie the estate or being of any thing by the name of life taking the word generally and not in his most proper signification for the being of euery creature is like the life thereof insomuch as thereby it is conserued in his proper estate

and so it may seeme that saint iohn meaneth saying that all things were made by the eternall word of god and that without it nothing was made that was made and that in it was life for here the word life might be taken for the being of all creatures
in this respect it may be permitted vs to say that all creatures haue life but not like any of those which are properly called liuing creatures and each one according to the distinctions by vs before alledged

now let vs speake of the naturall vnderstanding which seemeth to be in all creatures
know that to speake properly vnderstanding and reason cannot bee attributed but onely to angels and men
for though all creatures obserue their order and course in their naturall motions yet doe wee not conclude that they do this by vnderstanding and reason whereof they shoulde participate with men but rather by a naturall inclination which god hath bestowed vpon them to guide and direct them so
yet it seemeth that there is great difference betweene the celestiall

bodies concerning which we now discourse and the other creatures which are without life and vnderstanding considering their well ordred motions and incorruptible nature as we haue heeretofore shewed
for this is the cause why many philosophers haue taught

that the heauens retained some kinde of life and vnderstanding briefly that the world was an animall or liuing creature for the reasons heeretofore alleaged
and therefore some haue supposed that the celestiall and luminary bodies did nourish and preserue themselues by the moistnes and vapors which they attracted and drew vp by their heate out of the water and other elements
and for faculties of sense and reason they also considered the same to be in them because that they haue their course and motions so well ordred and comprehended one by another that therein can be found no fault disorder or confusion
which so excellent order could not bee kept nor maintained it seemed amongst them without great reason vnderstanding and wisedome yea more great then is seene in all the men of the world togither
for although they were created partakers of these graces and gifts yet so farre are they from maintaining such an order amongst them as do the celestiall bodies that contrariwise there is nothing but disorder and confusion in them and in all their actions
for these reasons therefore sundry philosophers haue concluded that as there are animals or liuing creatures in the earth in the waters and in the aire so likewise are there in heauen and that the sunne and moone the other planets and stars are celestiall animals not onely liuing but also participating of reason and vnderstanding

yea some haue named them celestiall intelligences
and in truth they which haue good skill in astronomie do consider how the sunne the goodliest and most excellent of the lights of heauen possesseth the middle place among the seuen planets like the king and prince of them and which hath about him the lords of his court
for on one side is mars the warrior which hath charge of armies and on the other side mercurie his orator and ambassador
then is there betwixt him and mercurie the planet venus which is the day starre messenger of the morning which alwaies attendeth on the sunne at his rising and setting for she riseth euery day before him and setteth euery day after him and vnder those is the moone
these two planets seeme to be allowed him like mistresses of his house and huswiues of the most moist natures
then

aboue mars is the milde and benigne planet iupiter to the end to moderate the vehemencie and furie of him
and higher yet is saturne who is cold slowe and sadde wherefore he may the better temperate the heate of mars and serue the sunne like a sound and well staied counsellor neere about his prince
then may be seene the high heauen commonly called the firmament which containeth all the rest of the stars vnder which the sunne marcheth in his royall magnificence accompanied like a king with his court and armie all in gallant order
is not this then a goodly policie like a royall court a celestiall common wealth and a braue armie wherein euery star and planet keepeth his ranke and order and not onely for these considerations but euen by testimonies of scripture there are some will vndertake to prooue that the celestiall bodies haue reason and vnderstanding

for the prophets namely moses and isay sometimes addressing their speech to the heauens call them for auditors as when they say oh heauens heauens heare that which shall speake and giue eare to my words so that they woonder why these holy men should call to the heauens if they had neither soule nor life

nor reason nor vnderstanding
and the psalmist in his canticles doth exhort the heauenly bodies to praise god no lesse then the angels themselues
but now let vs tell them that if by these authorities we must conclude that the spheres haue in them a soule life sense and reason we might say the like of the aire of the clouds waters fire haile snowe vapors windes yea and of all earthly creatures to the very plants
for the roiall prophet inuiteth them all to praise the lord as well as the heauens
yea he proceedeth farther when he saith that all of them performe the word of the lord
and when moses and isay call the heauens to record they do as much to the earth as if it had eares to heare vnderstanding for to vnderstand

we must then know that the prophets vsing this manner of speech doe speake to insensible creatures and which are without vnderstanding the better to mooue men to their dutie and the more to induce them to acknowledge their ingratitude and rebellion against god by rendring to him that honour and reuerence which they should beare to his maiestie which is of such waight and vertue that the very sense and feeling thereof reacheth to all nature and to euerie kind of creature
whereby me must learne how great reproch shall redound to men and

the number of witnesses that shal appeere against the if they will be more deafe at the voice of god then the deafest creatures and if they will be lesse mooued with his presence and hardlier acknowledge it then those his works which are farthest remote from reason vnderstanding
and in truth what shame may this goodly order which we whilome spake of to be amongst the celestiall bodies euery day breed in vs for if they had a soule life sense and vnderstanding wee might lesse woonder to see them euer continue and maintaine such a constituted order
because we might ascribe the good gouernment of them to the reason and wisedome which might be resident in them
but if they haue neither sense nor vnderstanding by meanes whereof they might attaine to that intelligence wisedome for to know how to guide gouerne themselues so much more iust occasion hath beene giuen to the prophets to appeale to them as witnesses and iudges against men and leaue to looke to other creatures seeing that they shew in effect that they do better vnderstand the voice and word of god whereby they haue beene created and disposed and which hath appointed and ordained the estate wherein they serue then men do whom he hath made partakers of reason and vnderstanding
wherefore wee will heere note that when the prophets do exhort the insensible creatures to praise god it is chiefly for two reasons
the first is in keeping euerie one their order they glorifie god after their fashion and according to their nature because they are like preachers of his puissance wisedome and bountie and as witnesses of them and of his glory towards men and the other reason is so much the better to induce men to praise their creator as it behooueth them
but for the philosophers yea the pythagorians academicks which proceed farther concerning the life reason and vnderstanding which they contemplate in the spheres saying that they are replenished with soules lodged in them and by which many of our diuines also wil haue to be ment the angels and celestiall spirits who say they mooue the heauens but what and how many there are of these intellectuall formes in the sphericall bodies he onely knoweth

who as dauid saith counteth the number of the starres and calleth them all by their names
will onely say thus much that sith euery planet hath his proper force and influence vpon things heere below it seemeth verie fit that it should haue his gouerning intelligence which giueth it

the vertue to worke considering that the operation cannot proceed simply from a body
but now enter into a new matter the discourse whereof achitob impose on you

of the influence and effects of the planets and starres in things here below either to good or euill
chapter

achitob

some might maruel why christian philosophers do alwaies when they intreate of the sphere retaine the names of the gods and goddesses of the ancient idolaters which the pagan philosophers both greekes and latines haue long agoe giuen to the starres and planets

but this should seeme no more strange then that we yet obserue in the daies of the weeke the names which were attributed to them by the saide authors and which they haue likewise taken from the names of the planets except sunday
for bicause that these celestiall bodies haue beene so called at the first by those who haue most curiously and diligently searched them out and left precepts of the astronomicall doctrine therefore doe these fond names yet remaine amongst vs like many other things taken from the ancients
but the discourse is very great and of deepe study concerning the diuers properties vertues and powers which astronomers assigne to the planets aboue all nature yea and ouer all men of whome making their predictions they name one man a saturnist another a martialist or iouialist or else a mercurialist or a venerian or a phebaean

or a lunatist
in such sort that the diuers affections inclinations and manners of men are by many holden not to proceede onely of the matter diuersly disposed as there be some that esteeme but also by the diuers influence and sundry forme not in specificall diuersity but particular and proper
and thence it commeth that ptolomie and other professors of astrology do teach that the stars and planets do giue influence of good and of euill for say they by saturne is infused a firme and stable prudence by iupiter a righteous iustice by mars a constant force and puissance by the sunne an ardent charity by venus a milde hope by mercury a penetrating faith and by the moone a moderate temperance
moreouer that by saturne as by a most

graue and sublime fautor men are induced to the most profound mysteries of all diuine and naturall philosophie that by iupiter they are gouerned in a good due temper so that they make obserue lawes and dispose all things with equitie pursuing alwaies that which is righteous
that from mars they receiue the abilitie and power to performe any exploit to the end to be fortunate in their enterprises
that the sunne bestoweth vpon all generation operation and life as charitie which is appropriated to him adorneth all the vertues like life and forme
that venus giueth grace cheerefulnes and loue by which men being mooued do performe all high matters with delectation because we could not sustaine the labour which is in the studie of naturall and diuine matters no not in temporall things if loue did not thereto inuite vs wherewith being afterward recreated we easilie suppresse the affliction which continuall thought in profound matters and of difficult vnderstanding doth bring vnto vs that mercurie maketh vs prompt sharpe and subtile in euery busines but chiefly in searching out of the truth and in obtaining eloquence musicke and glory
that the moone in the foresaid effects of the other planets giueth a more neere and variable motion so that she causeth to be correspondent to man as to the end and image of the whole vniuers all the loftie members of it
all these properties say are attributed by sundry astronomers to the planets in regard of the good which they cause to men
againe others acknowledge some of them to be the cause of many euils and those they call ill planets not celestiall
for they say that saturne is foolish niggardly difficult

inducing to dangers fraud mischiefe treasons violence captiuitie banishment losse periurie contumacie wrath hatred of all good feare anguish griefe burials sorrow and losse of children also that he causeth sorceries empoisonings theft maketh magicians
of mars they say that he prouoketh to treason warre

murder boldnes rashnes pride sedition contention rapine ambushments woundings flights disloialties villanies foolish loue easie offending many cogitations ill counsell and that he maketh princes violent cruell inhumane desirous of bloud and slaughter periured deceitfull inconstant cursing and full of all wickednes and that he foresheweth a mishapen and impudent man and that he is pernicious to birthes causing abortiue fruit finally that in all parts of heauen he menaceth some mischiefe

for the rest passe them heere in silence that may not bee too tedious in this matter which some mathematicians and poets ascribe to other planets making them cause of many other euils according to the diuers constellations where they doe contemplate them
but to speake my minde we like christians must beleeue and not thinke as many naturalists doe who in stead of acknowledging a god do forge to themselues an idoll of nature that it should be the planets or starres who like fountaines or ladies of vertues properties and powers giue influence to men of the foresaide qualities but onely that in disposing their bodies being compounded of the elements vpon which the planets worke they serue to aide them to abound in vertues or vices according as their minde beeing moderatrix of all their actions doth dispose hir faculties to intend good or euill
for this cause we say that to those which want the gifts and graces of gods spirit all things cannot but succeed badly and the influences of the spheres hurt them rather then otherwise yea some more then other some as to the contrarie the minde of the faithful well instructed doth correct the naughtines of the stars deliuereth himselfe from all peruerse inclination
this is it that the thrise great philosopher mercurius saith entreating of those whom the diuine power whatsoeuer it was had forsaken leauing and abandoning them to the euill as hee speaketh and all that which was sensible in them
for thus saith he
of such the forces of anger appetite which being wel directed would cause euery good worke turne into a nature depriued of reason
so then we learne that very vaine is the faith that is giuen to the planets to constellations and to foolish diuinations and superstitious prognostications of astrologians
for true christians feare not the signes of heauen nor their aspects and regards but do wholly depend vpon the grace of god and of his prouidence which turneth all to the good of his elect

and therefore though wee condemne not true astrologie namely astronomie yet must we not approoue the superstition and curiositie which is in many concerning that part of this science called iudiciall which they holde for a certaine and infallible doctrine by which may be foreseene and knowne the euents of men
but let vs rather hold with that which ieremie teacheth vs

saying feare not the signes of heauen according to the gentiles for the customes of the people are vaine
which is as much as if he

had said that such curious obseruations full of superstitions are friuolous and false belonging to pagans and idolaters and not to the people of god
for this cause also we haue in the bookes of the other prophets many things spoken against the predictions and prognostications of the chaldees and babylonians

namely in isay
for god which is aboue all nature hath meanes which men cannot perfectly know either by reason of their ignorance or for that those meanes are supernaturall
so that it happeneth that things oftentimes succeede cleane contrarie to that which the astronomers haue forespoken prognosticated

according to their contemplation
but woulde willingly aske them what foundation they can haue when like prophets they enterprise to foretell men good lucks and ill lucks and all euents which they must expect and chiefly to kings princes and other chiefe personages for where doe they finde when god created the stars and planets that he gaue them commission to reueale to astrologers what should be the nature and complexion of euery one according to the planet vnder which they should be borne and againe how can such iudiciall science haue certaintie seeing there are a thousand men that are borne euery day in the world in one selfesame countrie at one selfesame time hower and instant one sometimes to be a king and another a poore shepherd being neither like in nature nor like in manners but sometimes more contrarie then fire and water for this is much prooued in many twinnes as the scripture giueth vs a notable example in iacob and esau
for they were borne so close to one another

that iacob helde with his hand the sole of his brother esaus foote and therefore the name of iacob was giuen him
and by how much the one was humble good and peaceable by so much the other was proud wicked and warlike
and who can beleeue that god hath set marks in any of the signes of heauen to signifie to men that which he hath ordained concerning euery one in his eternall counsell which is hidden from the angels themselues surely whatsoeuer we can learne is through his holy spirit which he communicateth to such as he pleaseth reuealing to them his secrets as heretofore he did to his most faithfull seruants
and therefore he that would haue most certaine prognostications must not goe away to seeke and aske them of other more true astrologians then the prophets and apostles with their writings
for they haue surely foretold all that must come to

passe in the world to the very consummation of time and chiefly touching the monarchies empires and kingdoms of the earth namely daniel
and belieue that god hath not created the stars planets more for kings princes other great personages the for the simple least
too sound true a prognosticatio haue we against them all in isay

by which he prophesieth that euery kingdome euery nation which serueth not the lord shall perish
so likewise all the blessings and cursings of the lawe

are so many most certaine prophesies of all that which good and bad men may expect for good or euill
now could in this present matter concerning the influence of celestiall bodies vpon men produce the testimonies of the most renowmed amongst the ancient diuines against those who attribute so much vertue to the starres but bicause the authoritie of a christian is of no value with the atheists and superstitious which are willingly the greatest idolaters of nature will bring them the proofe of strangers yea of those who first gaue the precepts of pronogstications by which they may easily finde their teachings thwarted by themselues and to haue beene left otherwise by them then the troupe of their followers doe suppose
let them reade the text of ptolemie prince of astronomers

in the beginning of his apotelesmes which is as much to say as the effects referred to the there shall they see that he attributeth this to the starres that to the maner of the birth something to the seed of the parents one thing to the diet another to the place another to the orders so that very little resteth in the planets
and the author concludeth his speech in this sort as we commend phisitions who search out the originall of the disease and the causes in diuers fashions so must not we be despised if to iudge vpon the infant borne we inquire of the region of the birth diet manners and other occurrences
and in his booke entituled alarba he saith that oftentimes such accidents meete in the infant borne that he cannot receiue the celestiall influence sometimes very little and sometimes much which many are ignorant of
how then can any by the starres onely determine of that which must happen to man from the hower of his birth as infinite many doe beleeue but bicause some who are abused by this iudiciall science doe willingly reply that astrologians prognosticators do oft foretell many things which are afterward found true desire that we may examine their reason which aser leaue to you to discouer

of the truth which is found in prognostications of astrologers and how the starres are appointed by god for signes and that from their influences no euill proceedeth
chapter

aser

who diligently should marke in predictions astrological prognostications the falshoods and truthes which therein are found doubt not but he should perceiue these much more rare then the other
but people doe commonly take so great delight to be deceiued that it sufficeth them if they be once told truth for a thousand times wherein they haue beene foretold lies
and god knoweth how the professors of this arte doe aduaunce that point as much as they can and doe dissemble in all others whereby their leasings may be discouered
and when they will most floute fooles they vse ambiguous and obscure manners of speech like the answeres which long agoe the diuell made by oracles both of apollo and other
for such kinde of speech is fit to strike the ignorant in a dumpe who though they vnderstand not the prognosticators speech yet according as things come to passe they will expound them to their minde and chiefly when among many things some one doth stumble vpo some like apparance with that prediction although the astrologer speakes at aduenture and sometimes vnderstands not himselfe yet this is certaine and is daily seene by experience that indeede the most cunning in this science foretell many things which are after found true
and this may happen chiefly in three manners
the first is

when they containe themselues within the bounds of astrologie and will prognosticate nothing but whereof they foresee the causes most manifest in nature as in eclipses of the sun moone the changes thereof in the courses of the planets their aspects and dispositions and such like naturall inclinations the knowledge whereof they may by their arte attaine vnto
but when they passe farther it happens to them which is sometimes seene in bad archers and bowmen who though they take their aime badly neither yet draw right may neuerthelesse shoote so often that by great chance one or other may hit the white
but this comes not often

for if one should reckon the badde shoots they would bee exceeding fewe that had hit in respect of the rest
and in this sort haue we in the beginning of our speech ment concerning the copious and ambigious manner of astrologers writings and speeches very proper for their intention
finally god in his secret and most iust iudgement doth many times permit that the things foretold by such deceiuers do oftentimes succeed to the intent to punish the curiositie and vanitie of men as it commonly falleth out and hath in old time beene knowne by the oracles of diuels and by the predictions and diuinations of necromancers and inuocators vpon euill spirits
for they who rather beleeue such inuentious of the diuell then the true and sacred word of god deserue to be holden in error by the euents which they expect whe they trust to the father of lying to the end that they may afterward receiue their due and condemnation
so came it to saul when he went to the witch

to vnderstand the issue and euent of the philistims warre against him
for hee heard that which he desired not to know and that which was prophecied to him came to passe
thus in three manners do we pereciue that astrologers may oftentimes prognosticate the truth
but because some suppose to haue a very good foundation for iudiciall astrologie in so much as moses saith speaking of the creation of the sunne and moone and starres

that god set them for signes would desire them to consider that the prophet expoundeth himselfe in these words and god said let there be lights in the firmament of heauen

to separate the day from the night and let them be for signes and for seasons and for daies and for yeeres and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heauen to giue light vpon the earth
heereby it is apparent to vs that god created the planets to distribute the light and to distinguish and signifie vnto vs by certaine signes the times seasons yeeres moneths daies and nights for all politicall publike and priuate order
for it is most necessarie that men should direct themselues according to times and seasons
but although the starres were giuen vs for signes in this respect and that after the deluge they were in that estate reordained by god yet must wee abstaine from superstition too much curiositie which abuseth many in astrologie as is abouesaid and which often occasioneth that they not being able to prognosticate vpon euery cause apparently by the starres according to their desire do search and

haue recourse to other meanes to wit to necromancy and geomancie by which they diuine what they list leading men unto double error and phophaning the contemplatiue doctrine of the heauen which is otherwise of it selfe good and profitable

but beside all this might likewise say that if all things heere belowe were disposed and directed by the gouernance of heauen and the influence of the planets as our naturalists better philosophers then christians do maintaine wee should behold nothing saue what were good as being gouerned by good causes
and in this case demand what sould become of those euill influences of the starres vpon which astrologians do found their predictions

will not heere alleage that which moses teacheth vs saying that god saw that all things which he had made were good for perhaps they would not beleeue it but let them giue eare to mercury whom the ancients called the thrice great and supreme in philosophie metaphysicks and theologie
for he left written vpon pillars in egypt as iamblicus in a long discourse declareth how that all influences of the starres are good

and if there chance any euill it must be imputed to the indisposed subiect and not to the planets demonstrating this by the brightnes of the sunne which of it selfe is good and yet hurteth the bleare eie because of the badde state thereof
plato also saith

god hath made the moone encreasing and decreasing and hath established the moneths in the yeere and hath taught by a kinde of happie fortune to bring in count the number of them
whereupon ensueth that the earth being most fruitefull conceiueth and engendreth her fruite for the nouriture of man at such times as the windes gently blowe and the raine prosperously droppeth into her lappe
but if any euill befall heerein wee must not blame the diuine and celestiall nature but the humane which leadeth an vniust life
and the stoicke hieracles crieth out in the verses of pythagoras in these termes

each one through his owne euill ill will be for from the heauenly source no vice doth slow to soile our soules the cause are onely we the blame of mischiefe then on mortals throw

and plato in the sixt booke of lawes and aristotle in his politicks do testifie that man hauing attained to the true doctrine becommeth a very diuine and perfect debonaire creature but not hauing beene wel brought vp he be commeth the most cruell

of all creatures borne vpon the earth
what then remaineth for vs to attribute to the starres demand of them also who affirme some influences to be euill from whence will they saie that this malice proceedeth whether from god which commandeth or from the intelligence which mooueth the heauens or from the heauen it selfe

surely it cannot come from god who is the soueraigne good the first cause ordaining all things
for that is euill or sinne which is done against the will of the creator or which declineth from his iustnes and in nature euill cannot proceed from the spring of goodnes
wherefore it should be too foolish and absurd a thing to thinke that euill should take original from god and that from the soueraigne gouernour shoulde proceed the violation of the lawe seeing that his will is his owne lawe it selfe
for the intelligence or angel which some saie continueth in the motion of the spheres and to whom some assigne the cause of euill influences would faine aske them whether this intelligence doth so worke by the commaundement of his prince which is the eternall and soueraigne gouernour of the world or else against his will and ordinance if it accomplish any thing according to his precept certainely that cannot be bad for nothing is bad but that which is done contrarie to the order established by the prince of nature
but if it operate against his will it might seeme to turne to the scandall of the omnipotent creator to suffer his seruants so arrogant in rebellion vnpunished
for at the beginning he spared not those amongst the angels who exalted themselues in pride and for the rest who persisted in obedience hee in such sort confirmed them that they cannot sinne any more
whereupon also ensueth that the intelligences being loyall seruants of the eternall do not cause euill influences neither yet do dispose any thing to euill since they alwaies accomplish the ordinance of the

and for those who not being able to blame god nor the moouing intelligence doe accuse the heauens as cause of euill influences desire them to tell me if the heauens be malitious whence commeth their malice whether haue they beene created euill or else beene depraued by euill manners or else their nature failing them did they become euill certainely they were not created euill by the most good woorker
neither haue they beene depraued by manners or a failing nature because they haue no choise in their workes and

for that their motions and influences are naturall and inuariable not of freewill as all philosophers affirme
againe aske them whether the heauens giue influence as second causes or as instruments if as instruments then sith they neither mooue nor operate but according to the will of the prince who created them he should remaine in fault which is alreadie confuted
but if it be as second causes seeing the worke is performed by that which liueth the error should be referred to the intelligences who mooue them and are ordayned for soules to the spheres to which we haue also satisfied
will farther adde this point that the heauens do worke either by nature or by will
if by nature sith the order thereof is established by god the sentence of aristotle is woorthie the remembrance where saith what we possesse by nature we are therein neither praised nor blamed for the praise belongeth to the worker and the blame cannot be assigned to the order of the soueraigne good
but if the heauens worke freely being guided by an intelligence it must needs follow that being the causes of so many mischiefes which abundantly light on man they are guided by a furious or else by a couetous soule
if by a furious seeing there is a certaine planet which as these astronomers say doth alwaies designe violent influences wherefore is it not consumed with such a sempiternall furie moreouer why say men that a planet is inflamed sooner in one house then in another what meeteth it in his owne house or in another that disposeth it to signifie euill againe how is that inflamed with furie which they affirme to bee immutable but if the heauens be led by couetousnes what profit or gaine do they attract from things here below for this couetous desire remayneth onely in themselues
and whosoeuer coueteth euill doth it as the philosophers say because that he is as it were intoxicated and ouercome by inebriating matter
but sith the matter of the heauens is far from all chaunge and error it is neither inebriated nor subuerted
wherewith then wil they blame the heauens if any say that by nature they are euill

how is it that this euill should come into their nature for the sages collect these reasons and originall of euill in nature either for that the efficient cause cannot gouerne the superfluitie of the matter or else cannot supply where it faileth or else cannot dulie dispose it and such other reasons as presuppose a feeble power of the cause
but for as much as the smith and carpenter of

the heauens is of infinite power how should he faile in his workmanship for there was no other cause which might encounter him since that without any aide he framed the heauens neither could any thing resist the infinite worker who reduced all things into a due and proper estate as we haue heretofore amply declared
yet notwithstanding so many reasons how many are there which obstinately leaning to the vaine and curious obseruations of the starres as an infallible rule of the life and estate of man do aboue all things feare least in the ascendant of the natiuitie any euill planet should haue domination and indeed do we not behold that astrologers and aboue all magitians are so much sought after amongst vs that many do as one may say hold him to be miserable who knoweth not his horoscope to the ende then that we may better expell out of the braine of euerie one such foolish opinions let vs pray you stretch out this discourse in particular against such as accuse saturne and mars for most euill planets the charge whereof amana commit to you

of the planet saturne and how it is not euill nor any other starre
chapter

amana

vve shall doe verie well if keeping our selues from the superstition curiosity which misguideth many in the studie of iudicial astrologie and diuination we stay our selues in the most simple and most certaine astronomie which the spirit of god teacheth vs by the creation of the world that is to contemplate the creator by his works
for so should we become good astronomers and christian astrologers if say contemplating the heauens and all the ornament of them we propose them vnto vs as vniuersall preachers of the glorie of the soueraigne and consider them as the high works of his hands as the psalmist doth exhort vs

and so by creation of the sunne moone stars and other celestiall bodies we shall learne to meditate what light there is in him who dwelleth in the inaccessible brightnes and which is the father and fountaine of all lights as also what good we are to hope for of him
for by that good which the corporall

light bringeth vnto vs for our bodies and the sunne

moone and starres for the life of men wee may somewhat iudge what felicitie is prepared by the diuine and spirituall light for our soules and by god our creator in whom it abideth beeing a sure meanes not to feare the signes of heauen nor the constellations and aspects of the starres wherewith many do so menace men as if in heauen as in a court of tyrants it were ordained that so many mischiefes as should happen to the world should be contriued

but let those who so charge the starres of crimes and therefore turne ouer the bookes of pagan astrologers and atheists rather then diuine writings lend a while an care to some good witnesses whom they themselues cannot reprooue and who do euen praise the planet of saturne the malice of whom we haue heard to be so great
behold then first of all how the prince of the astronomical doctrine deposeth and testifieth concerning this planet in these termes

if saturne be only signifier in the estate of the minde and lord of the place of mercurie and of the moone and blaseth towards the corners of the world good aspects and beames the childe shall be a louer of good things of great and firme counsell and a searcher out of secret things and diuine
likewise iulius firmicus adorning this planet with many great praises saith that from his vertue proceedeth a quicke and subtile spirite in the deliberation of affaires a certaine worde a stable amitie a long foresight and a roiall counsell
there be also many moderne astronomers who say of the same saturne that euen as the common and ciuill life is designed by iupiter so likewise the solitary and diuine life is appropriated to saturne yea the ancient philosophers and poets haue sung that he is most good and that the golden world did passe vnder him fayning that iupiter did afterward vsurpe the kingdome hauing chased out saturne and that then began the siluer age

and let vs note in regard of the most famous poets amongst the ancients that they haue by their writings penetrated into the most profound cabinets of nature and approched the secrets of the diuine thought
for they sung not iestes as some hold which the old fathers would not mention to their little children but they haue beene acknowledged of the sages for great diuines who hid the mysteries both of the one and other nature vnder the vaile of fables and for this cause are they celebrated of such as vnderstand

well their doctrine
that it is so aristole doth plainly manifest in that the confirmeth great points of philosophie by the testimonie of simonides and of homer
and archesilaus the inuentor of the new academie ascribed so much honour to homer that he neuer went to bedde but he read some of his verses first and saide likewise in the day time that he might haue more leasure to read that he went to his beloued
anaxagoras also yea and our basil with laud admire the excellent vertue in the writings of this greeke poet
and how many be there likewise who esteeme virgil the imitator of homer for a doctor in all naturall and morall philosophie for many referre all that which he hath fained to an allegoricall sense
lucretius also entreateth of all the precepts of philosophie in verse
and orpheus singeth more loftily then humane knowledge can extend to the mysteries of theologie and of the sacred ceremonies which he had learned out of holy letters as himselfe confesseth
ouid likewise hath couered many of the secrets of pythagoras of the creation disposition of the vniuers in his metamorphosis but because he depraueth the with too lasciuious a discourse he looseth very much of their dignitie
wherein he hath been imitated of many other poets

as in this our age wherein there are verie many who doe the office rather of bauds then of the true children of the chaste muses because they delight to weaue poisoning sense in the web of their faire words
such indeed plato commaunded to be chased out of the co~monweale
but to returne to our purpose it is most euident that these ancient poets great philosophers diuines do testifie that saturne is an happie and willing planet
and in so much as they accuse him for deuouring all his children except fowre they themselues interpret that of time by which indeed he consumeth all things except the fowre elements which still remaine because that out of them and into them all nature is changed
and thereof it commeth that they so call them to wit the fire iupiter the aire iuno the water neptune and the earth pluto
moreouer if wee will in excuse of saturne consider the cause of the malice which commonly astronomers attribute vnto him

it is certaine that the euils wherewith they accuse him proceed from his cold and drie nature by which hee seemeth to fauour melancholie whose propertie is to oppresse and stop the desiring power and naturall loue whose seate is hot and moist
and in that they separate saturne from humane societie we must

vnderstand that this is not the planet which properly they meane but rather the childe disposed to such complexion and disposition partly through the influence of the starres partlie through his birth and seed of the parents or the place of his generation or of his foode and partly also through the disposition which he may get by nurture and manners and especially if the saide planet ruling in the natiuitie of the childe

it bee inuaded with the drines of mars and coldnes of the moone
but yet one may correct euery such euill influence
for the childe increasing in yeeres and iudgement may addict himselfe to studie and contemplation of high and diuine things which are the delights of him who leadeth a solitarie life and doubtlesse hee shall perceiue that saturne is not euill but doth rather fauour him with a good influence
and if any finde himselfe heauie by reason of his saturnine co~plexion

let him meditate on that which is written blessed are they which mourne if hee bee pensiue or silent let him harken to that which is said marie hath chosen the good part if he haue desire to store vp riches let him lay vp in heauen
for so may he easily correct euery euil inclination which he shall naturally haue
and as much may we speake of him who shal be stirred vp with the infla~mation of mars
for if the martial choler maketh him hastie and subiect to anger let him not vse it against the poore and little ones but to represse vices
for as golden chrysostome saith where there is no wrath nor indignation there science profiteth nothing the iudgements are not constant and crimes are not corrected
let then warres murders boldnes magnanimitie spoiles captiuities flights violences and such like be exercised against the enemies of god and for the publike peace and then this mars will not be euill

but rather numbred amongst the saints and seruants of god with phineas sonne of eleasar commended for his zeale and with dauid who fought the battels of the almightie
but if among warriors there happen deceit periurie frauds temeritie furie thefts and such mischiefes all this commeth to passe bicause the rule of reason is broken
and then this gate being open the winds of passions whiske out and blow violently like a great tempest
but so long as they remaine vnder the commandement of eolus to wit so long as reason duly gouerneth euery violent motion proceeding from martiall choler is easily moderated and turneth to profit
the like must be iudged of venus who is saide to

induce men to a lustfull and lasciuious desire
for if we gouerne well the concupiscence or appetite heated by this planet the sunne and mars thereto ministring feruor thereupon woulde ensue a good loue inflamed towards god and our neighbor
so then we may conclude our speech that men do wrongfully complaine of their nature or the influence of the starres when they should rather accuse the peruersnes of their wil which causeth their voluntarie sinne as in the second part of our academie we haue related
but this will be more cleere vnto vs if we consider how the stars worke in man not in constraining but disposing which aram shall be the subiect of your speech

of the planets in generall and how they worke in man not in constraining but disposing

many holding opinion that we obtaine nothing by the influence of the stars doe reiect the doctrine of astrologians as absurde and altogither differing from philosophie
and amongst other reasons they alledge that there haue been many graue philosophers who haue applied their care and diligence to search out the causes of things borrowing their knowledge from phisicke from the mathematicks and from many other arts and sciences and yet neuer looked after the causes in astrologie namely pythagoras plato aristotle plotin auicen auerrois hippocrates and others the most renowmed ancient authors
but one may answere them that as it was forbidden by the mosaicall lawe that any should reape his field all throughout

but should leaue some corner for the poore and needfull whereof they might make bundles and fardles to sustaine themselues and appease their hunger so it may be that the former philosophers haue left to their posteritie in the spatious field of the secrets of nature ynough for others to gather and to search out after them
and indeede if any one should set himselfe against vs saying saint augustine ambrose ierome origen damascene and other doctors both hebrues greekes and latines haue with most diligent labour sounded the sense of the scriptures without touching that which now you doe wherefore that which you say is not true
what could this conclude against vs for it is a common thing in schooles that

nothing is concluded of pure negatiues

and the sages co~demne not that which any one hath found out for excellent by the subtiltie of his owne wit though it neuer before had been touched by others
wherefore no man is to be condemned if he make a farther search of causes then many ancient philosophers haue done who would not passe the bounds of the elementarie nature being contented to sound the causes by the power and qualities of these inferior bodies as many of our age doe whose theoricke and practick doth too much faile
let vs moreouer adde that the most renowmed amongst the ancients accord in this point

that the inferior things and such as are called naturall doe drawe to them the fauor of the superior and celestiall rather by one aspect then by another
which skil is holden excellent to be knowne
but for the peripatetickes who abased in their sensible obiects content themselues with the sensible qualities for the cause of all effects saying that if there be found any effect ouer which such a qualitie hath no power that this proceedeth from a cause to vs vnknowne we may euidently see

that they haue erred in all their teachings
for when aristotle intreateth in the meteors of the heate of the sunne he saith that it proceedeth from two causes ioined togither to wit from his motion and place not from his motion onely as being quicker then iupiter mars and saturne which forasmuch as they are more remote their inflammation in a very quicke motion doth not attaine to vs neither also can the heate of the sunne proceede from the moone venus and mercurie bicause that though they be neerer vnto vs yet being more slow in motion they are not so much inflamed
this reason he deliuereth and this makes me to woonder how a person so celebrated could imagine an inflammation in such things as receiue no strange impression
for he would attribute that to the distance and motion which should be referred to the naturall vertue
might not some other then better sound the cause why the interiection of the sunne beames doth bring heate though aristotle a most subtile searcher of naturall causes could not attaine to it which perhaps he abstained to doe bicause he would not passe the limits by him appointed in his basest philosophie which he calleth naturall
yet neuerthelesse mounting somewhat higher in that which he writeth to alexander he teacheth that in taking of medicines the aspect of the heauens must be diligently obserued
but hippocrates proceeding farther doth

foretell the diseases recouerie and death by the house of the moone

and the aspects therof with the other planets
and haly in the beginning of the worke of this author and according to his aduse saith that the phisition ignorant in astronomie is like a blinde man that gropes for his way with his staffe
besides it would be too long to collect that which plato in his obscure discourse and diuers academicks and vnknowne philosophers doe teach to be extracted from the heauens both how and when

and what do the heauens by their continuall motion but onely worke in vs some may say they giue influence to the elements and to plants
but demand are not our bodies heated by the sunne and altered and with cold benummed by the moone the simple vulgar is not ignorant heereof
why then do we not say that the starres communicate other influences no lesse knowne to the sages then these of the said lights are to the vulgar and yet not that their power performeth entire effects
for with them as we haue heard concur the diet manners natiuitie and place but aboue all the liberty of the minde is alwaies dominant to moderate and gouerne all the inclinations thereof which indeed proceedeth of the proper spirituall nature thereof which mooueth the body and not the bodie the minde and with this consenteth that which ptolomie saith in the beginning of his apotelesmes and in his booke of fruite speaking thus a good astrologian may well preuent much euill which otherwise might happen by the disposition of the starres if he foreknow their nature and forecast how to hinder that it happen not and that the subiect receiue no dommage by the place by which it should receiue profit
so then wee should not impose vpon saturne an harmefull sadnes or wicked seueritie nor vpon mars a cruell rashnes nor on mercurie a cautelous malice nor on venus lasciuious loues nor an inconstant proceeding on the moone no more then he that hath should impute his infirmitie to the light nor the flaming of an house to the fire nor the bruise to the stone nor bo~ds prisons and executions of malefactors to the seueritie of the iudge
for euery euill effect ensueth vpon the indisposition of the subiect receiuing and not vpon the influence of the superior powers· which to the contrarie we may maintaine as already we haue done to be of it selfe good still yea by the particular ordinances of the starres according to the doctrine of mathematicians

for thus many of them say saturne disposeth the intellectual vertue he prouoketh to wisedome and to contemplation of diuine and humane things and pierceth to the brightnes of true philosophie
but if the saturnist applie his profound thoughts to euill to accomplish his disordinate appetite then he wholy intendeth to deceite fraud and coggings and yet the loftiest and diuinest part thereof called synteresis resisting it in him then full of melancholie he feeleth himselfe so oppressed with anxietie and tediousnes

that he supposeth that most good and profitable which is most noisome and dommageable and as he findeth himselfe more oppressed with the often remembrance of his wicked life many visions do oftentimes present themselues vnto him like semblances of the dead shadowes of the deceased horrors of sepulchers and tombes of such as are departed
to the inner eie of his thought presenteth it selfe the wrath of god the assaults of the diuel despaire hate of saluatio
and as much may we speake of the martialist who if he excite the violence and force of his courage not to zeale of iustice as he ought to doe but to accomplish his desires and carnall appetites then commits he theeueries· rapes and many other mischiefes
so that thereupon some will attribute euill to the planets which are called for the ordinance of iupiter which by the hot and moist or by a debonaire nature guideth to clemencie might bee so much augmented that the curbed and peruerted spirit might be forced to an entire dissolution
so the noble and milde influence of venus which maketh man benigne if it be not moderated will make him be effeminate and a slaue to all lustfull appetites
and the sunne father of life and giuer of light directeth men to true wisedome and roiall dignitie and yet if the splendor of the minde be abused and that it be conuerted into pride it mounteth into an ambitious presumption arrogancie and scorne of others
thus then may we say that many euils may proceed from that which is good as of the abundance of wine wherewith any man is glutted doth arise the oppression of the hart abating of vertue and many such accidents though being moderately taken it reioiceth the hart and comforteth the naturall powers
so the water likewise which is a good element and very profitable for all drowneth and choaketh those which take not heed thereof· and ouerturneth those buildings which are not very firme
wherefore let vs conclude that all influences

are good so that the subiects be well disposed and can vse them and especially that the starres and planets operate in man not in constraining but in disposing his inclinations the which by reason the minde may alwaies moderate and correct
and taking occasion vpon this matter let vs come to the true astronomie and astrologie of christians which is to contemplate the glorie and greatnes of god by the worke of the heauens as achitob finishing this daies worke you may relate to vs

of the true astronomie which the heauens teach vs and especially the sunne in his admirable effects
chap

achbtob

it is not without cause that the prophet saith the heauens declare the glorie of god

and the earth sheweth the worke of his hands
for thereby he euidently teacheth that the worke of the spheres and their well ordred motion doe demonstrate as with the finger euen to our eies the great and admirable prouidence of god their creator euen as if the heauens should speake to euery one
in an other place it is written

this high ornament this cleere firmament the beautie of the heauen so glorious to behold is a thing full of hough then that the heauens haue neither voice nor speech like men yet when the workmanship of them and the goodly images pourtraied and placed in them do present themselues vnto vs it is as much as if god spake to vs
for sight belongeth to the eies as hearing doth to the eares and that which offereth it selfe to those

is as the sound is to these
wherefore in very deede we may call not onely the heauens sunne moone and starres but all other creatures also visible words which speake to the eies as those which are in sound and voice doe speake to the eares
if likewise we can very well vnderstand dumbe folkes by the signes which they make vs say that they speake by signes why then should we not harken to the language of god speaking by the heauens and by the signes which he hath placed in them for may we not truly say that they speake vnto vs by signes and if we call bookes dumbe teachers bicause they teach by the meanes of writing which they lay before our eies

what fairer booke may wee see written in a fairer letter and of more neate impression and printed with goodlier characters then this great booke of the whole vniuers and chiefly of the heauens againe if it be needefull for vs to seeke out images to represent god that so he might become visible to vs where may we finde them fairer and more liuely and which speake vnto vs a language most easie to be vnderstood if we be not altogether deafe wherefore it is not without good cause that when god willing to make his greatnes his magnificence and prouidence known to his people saith by esay lift vp your eies on high

be hold who hath created these things which is he that bringeth out their armies by number and calleth them all by their names
by the greatnes of his power and mighty strength nothing faileth
this is it in all these considerations that dauid in the place before alledged after he hath acknowledged that there is no language nor speech where the voice of the heauens is not heard doth further adde that their line is gone foorth through all the earth and their words vnto the ends of the world meaning by this line the magnificent frame and excellent workmanship of them
for all is so well made and composed therein by the workmaster that it seemeth to haue been all drawne out by line rule and compasse
and when he speaketh of their words he vnderstandeth the marke and impression which is in them by which they preach vnto vs in stead of words
and for this cause also he saith before that one day vttereth speech vnto another day and one night teacheth knowledge vnto another night which is as much as if he should say that one day teacheth and preacheth another and the night doth the same bicause that from day to day and from night to night god manifesteth his power and glorie

and let vs note

that the prophet proposing vnto vs the heauens thus in generall as true preachers of his diuine prouidence maketh principall and expresse mention of the sunne bicause it is the most goodly creature the most agreeable most profitable and necessarie for men and for all the rest of the works of god
for this cause also euery one giueth more heed vnto it then to all the other celestiall bodies
for it is by the course and meanes of the sunne that we haue ordinarily daies and nights and that they be sometimes longer sometimes shorter and another time equall as hath been already told vs and also that we haue the

distinction of yeeres and of the diuers seasons of them as of the spring time summer autumne and winter and of the time fit to sowe plant till the earth and to gather the fruites thereof and generally to performe all other workes necessarie for the life of man
and then may very well bee considered the course and compasse of this goodly light which is from the one end of heauen to the other end and how there is nothing that is hid from the heate thereof
shall we let passe in silence the gallant course which euery day it maketh compassing the whole world in the space of fower and twenty howers without being any whit wearie for from the hower that god hath created it it hath neuer desisted from worke day nor night and hath neuer failed one iot neither shal cease so long as the world shal endure
and therefore it is also said in ecclesiasticus the sunne also a maruellous instrument

when it appeereth declareth at his going out the worke of the most high
and presently after great is the lord that made it by whose commandement it doth runne hastily
then speaking in generall of all the planets and starres it is a campe saith he pitched on high shining in the firmament of heauen the beautie of the heauens are the glorious starres and the ornament that shineth in the high places of the lord
by the commandement of the holy one they continue in their order and faile not in their watch
and who is it except the blinde that beholdeth not this goodly sunne to passe out of his pauilion like a magnificent king that marcheth foorth of his palace who seeth not the faire countenance that he sheweth to all being as the eie and mirrour of the whole world who vieweth not his trim locks and the golden haires and yellow beard of his raies by which he spreadeth his light and heate vpon all creatures in such sort that as none can auoide his heate so none can flie from his light
for as it is written by the word of the lord are his works

the sunne that shineth looketh vpon all things and all the works thereof are full of the glorie of the lorde
at noone when it burneth the countrie who may abide for the heat thereof the sunne burneth the mountaines three times more then he which keepeth a furnace with continuall heate it casteth out firie vapors and with the shining beames blindeth the eies
hast thou commanded the morning since thy daies saith the lord to iob and hast thou caused the morning to know his place

that it might take hold of the corners of the earth and that the wicked

might be shaken out of it for as it is said in another place they are among those which abhorre the light

and knowe not the waies thereof nor continue in the paths thereof
the murtherer riseth early and killeth the poore and needie and in the night he is as a thiefe
the eie also of the adulterer waiteth for the twylight and saith none eie shall see me and disguiseth his face
they dig through houses in the darke which they marked for themselues in the day they know not the light
but the morning is euen to them as the shadow of death if one know them they are in the terrors of the shadow of death
by which testimonies aptly agreeing with that which is written euerie man that doth euill hateth the light we may know

besides the greatnes of the workes of god which principally shineth in the creation of the sunne how euen they who would not behold the light thereof but fly from it as much as they may bicause they hate it and feare it as the death cannot for all that auoide it
to the ende then that we may reape some profit by this discourse and so finish this daies talke let vs thinke that if the most ignorant and most doltish are inexcusable for their ignorance and ingratitude towards god for the sermons of the heauens which they continually make to all creatures how much more are the learned and chiefly astronomers and astrologians if they know not verie well how to vse their science to the glorie of god

for they are called astronomers because they haue the knowledge of the lawes and rules which the soueraigne creator hath established and ordayned among the starres and their courses and motions according as their name deriued from the greeke toong importeth as also the name of astrologie will infer as much seeing that thereby is signified that they vnderstand and can render a reason of the nature and of the effects of the celestiall bodies
wherefore then sith they haue greater knowledge then the ignorant and common people as well by the knowledge as by the obseruations and continuall experience of the effects of the planets they shall be therfore found the more culpable before god if they vnderstand not the language of the heauens thereby to learne how to glorifie him
and yet so far are the greater part of them from doing that which we say that contrariwise we see verie many which impute that to the spheres that they should attribute to the and so draw men from god their father by the vanitie of their humaine dreames vnder colour of

their astronomie and astrologie causing them to stay in regard of the creatures with them and so make them atheists as they are when they acknowledge none other god but an idoll of nature
and therefore desire that we may to morrow againe proceed to behold the admirable effects of the sun being most apparant to all and most easie for to know by which the rudest and most simple may learne to come to god as among other effects is that of the rising and setting of this goodly light
for the prouidence of god shineth maruellously in this point as aser we may learne of you

the end of the fourth day

the fift daies worke
of the rising and setting of the sunne and of the prouidence of god which shineth in the commodities of day and night
chapter

aser

if with vnderstanding we read the bookes of the heauens wee shall verily esteeme the celestiall bodies to bee the chiefe naturall philosophers doctors and astronomers by whom god dayly teacheth vs that principall astronomie and astrologie which he will haue vs learne and whereof we must not be ignorant without being conuicted as well the vnlearned as the learned of verie great vnthankefulnes towards him and of more beastly brutishnes then is amongst the bruite beasts
for he hath assigned vs teachers and masters which keepe common schoole with vs day and night as by our precedent discourse we haue alreadie vnderstood
and yet the greatest part of men yea almost all do no more profit in this schoole then the verie beasts though indeed it standeth continually wide open to

all yea and they which should chiefly learne out of this great booke of nature touching the knowledge of the creator of all things are those which oftentimes are farthest to seeke
for in liew of committing themselues to be guided by this booke so to approch to god as he pointeth out the path and way to those who haue eies to see and a spirit to vnderstand they rather take occasion therein by the vaine dreames of their own apprehensions to wander from the truth
and for this cause moses dauid and the other prophets and seruants of god speaking of the workes of the creation and of the diuine prouidence in them do propound vnto vs but simply those which are the most apparant to al the most easie to be vnderstood because they wil not only teach the most learned who are they which willingly make least profit in their writings but will also instruct the simple and ignorant who god doth oftentimes make capable of his secrets
for which cause likewise these holy fathers speake not of the spheres and heauenly bodies subtilly as philosophers in their schooles do but rather vulgarly to the ende that the most rude and playnest may vnderstand their philosophy replenished with the doctrine of saluation
for it is verie necessarie that euerie one should be instructed therein according to his owne capacitie

to pursue then our yesterdaies speech

begun concerning the sunne which the holy scripture setteth so often before our eies as an vniuersal preacher of the soueraigne maiesty pray you let vs first consider what ioy and what good it is that men receiue by it so long as it distributeth his light as wee haue alreadie heard being like the chariot of god to bring it to them
likewise how much pleasure and profit receiue they by his heat againe do we not see how he hath his determined time to make vs day and how that after he hath lightned one part of the world during such time as was assigned to him by god the creator hee then transporteth his light to the other part and when he hath performed his taske on one side of the world he returneth to the other without any ceasing rest or fainting
wherein we must especially acknowledge gods woonderfull prouidence who hath created him neither greater nor lesse then is necessary to performe the office which hath beene committed to him
and for his greatnes we may truely iudge that it is immense and admirable because that in what place soeuer men may be whether in

the east or in the west or in the north or in the south parts yet do they all behold it of one greatnes
and therefore doth the prophet say they which dwell in the vttermost parts of the earth

are afraid of thy signes and thou makest them ioyfull with the going foorth of the euening and the morning that is with the rising and setting of the sunne and other planets and starres
wherein we must note that though we commonly say of the sunne that he riseth and setteth as if we spake of a man that went to take his rest in the night after that he trauailed all day yet in truth he neither riseth nor setteth for that he is continually busie

bringing day to some when others haue night
but men say commonly so because that in regard of vs he seemeth when he retyreth as if he went to rest at and that he riseth in the morning when he returneth vnto vs wherfore we say that he is hidden and downe when we see him not and that he is risen when he appeereth at point of day
and so do the rude people and children which dwel neere the mountaines accustomablie say that he is gone to hide himselfe behind them
and they which are neere the sea suppose that he goeth to plunge wash himselfe therein as the poets also say accommodating their stile to the vulgar
and yet al may behold that he riseth not on the same side where he setteth but on the other quite opposite
whereby is easie to be iudged that he hath not reposed all the while that men slept but hath passed much way
and that he still carrieth his light with him for it is a most certaine thing that he hath not deliuered night and darknes to those people and nations by which he passed but light and day
but if there be fewe amongst the rude and ignorant which meditate these things so farre there be fewer which consider of the prouidence of god that manifesteth it selfe in this perpetuall changing of day into night and of night into day
for there is nothing more contrary then light and darknes and consequently then night and day and yet hath god so well disposed compacted and reconciled these contrarieties togither that if things were otherwise ordained there were neither man nor beast that could long liue vpon the face of the earth
and therefore ecclesiasticus saith

oh how delectable are all his works and to be considered euen to the very sparks of fire they liue all and endure for euer and whensoeuer need is they are all obedient
they are al double one contrarie to another hee hath made nothing that hath

any fault
the one commendeth the goodnes of the other and who can be satisfied with beholding gods glory and indeed if the day should last perpetually and equally alike in all parts of the world the heat of the sunne would so scorch euery thing that it would drie vp and consume not onely men and beasts but euen all moisture and humiditie which is in the earth

whereby all liuing creatures should faile for they could not liue for two causes
first because that life doth principally lie in heate and moisture and is conserued by them according to the order that god hath set in nature to guard and maintaine it
wherefore as men and beasts loose their life if their naturall heat be altogither extinguished so doth it likewise befall them when their moisture is entirely consumed
for there must be a verie equall proportion in all those qualities which are in the bodies of liuing creatures to wit in heat and coldnes in drines and moisture according to the nature of the fowre elements whereof they are composed for the excesse of the one doth confound the other
for which cause god hath so disposed the course of the sunne that hee distributeth his heate in so good and iust measure that he hindreth the too much coldnes and moisture which might quench the naturall heate and yet doth not so consume them by the heat and drines which he causeth but that there alwaies remaineth so much as is needful for the life of all creatures
and for the other reason that they would faile it is that neither man nor any other animall can liue without nourishment to repaire in them that which the naturall heate like a fire incessantly flaming hath consumed of radicall humor in their bodies yet this heat must be likewise maintained that it be not extinguished as wee haue amply discoursed concerning these things in the second part of our academie
for this cause then god hath ordained eating and drinking for the nouriture of all liuing creatures and hath appointed to the earth as to the mother of al the charge and office to produce fruits and other nourishments needfull for them
which she cannot do being by nature cold and drie if as she is warmed by the heat of the sunne she be not also moistned by the waters both of heauen earth
and therefore when that the sunne hath heated and dried it vp all day long the night which is the shadow of the earth doth afterwards ensue and taking from vs the sight of the sunne and his light doth by this meanes bring vnto vs darknes which causeth

night wherein the moone who is colde and moist hath her rule as the sunne who is hot and drie hath his rule in the day time
and so we must consider these two celestiall bodies very neerely according to their proper effects which we perceiue and experiment heere on earth below

as also moses testifieth vnto vs saying that god created two great lights amongst others to be as regents and rulers the one of day and the other of night
so then as the earth and all that it beareth togither with all animals or liuing creatures that it nourisheth are heated and dried vp in the day time by the sunne euen so are they moistned and refreshed in the night time by the withdrawing thereof and by the humiditie and coldnes of the moone
wherein there especially hapneth a mutuall accord betweene heauen and earth vnder which we comprise the aire waters and al creatures therein contained with their natures and qualities
moreouer in this maruel we are to consider that as men and animals cannot suruiue without nourishment which god hath prouided by the meanes aforesaid so likewise could they not liue without taking some rest
for they are not of nature like the heauens and planets which haue continuall motions and yet weare not away
and therfore as god hath appointed the day for his creatures to trauell in so hath he ordained the night for them to rest in
and as waking is proper to trauell so is sleeping peculiar to rest
in which sleepe being requisite and sleepe requiring humiditie and freshnes the better to dispose and induce liuing creatures to sleepe the night is much fitter therefore and for rest bicause of the moist and colde nature thereof then is the day which participateth most with heate and drines
and bicause all repose is in the night it is also more quiet then the day neither is there so much noise which may hinder sleepe and rest
wherein we haue yet another commoditie of the distinction and exchange of daies and nights whereto we may likewise adde that which dauid declareth when he saith

hee appointed the moone to distinguish the seasons the sunne knoweth his going downe
thou makest darknes and it is night wherein all the beasts of the forrest creepe foorth
the lions roare after their praie and seeke their meate at god
when the sunne riseth they retire and couch in their dens
then goeth man forth to his worke and to his labour vntill euening
behold heere goodly considerations how god hath prouided for the preseruation of the life of

his creatures by meanes of day and night
for because that the wilde beasts which liue by praie are dangerous and cruell he so guideth and gouerneth them by his prouidence that he keepeth them quiet and shut vp all day in their caues and dens in such sort that they seldome come foorth but in the night to seeke their praie euen then when men and domesticall beasts retire themselues and rest out of their dangers
thus haue we verie many commodities by the day and the night and more should be found out by a carefull search
for all that which we haue hitherto declared is so euident before the eies of euery one that the most rude and simple amongst men must needs consider and vnderstand it
but thinke it most conuenient that continuing the principall subiect of our discourses we shoulde speake of the excellent instructions which do likewise present themselues in the consideration of the second course and motion of the sunne and moone for the distinction of yeeres moneths and seasons whereof we haue heretofore made mention
then to you amana commit this discourse

of the second course and motion of the sunne and moone for the distinction of yeeres moneths and seasons and of the prouidence of god in these things
chap

amana

the sunne as we haue heeretofore heard hath two sundrie courses the one by which he bringeth vnto vs night and day and the other by which he distinguisheth vnto vs yeeres and seasons
now euerie one seeth that the sunne passeth and runneth through the heauens it seemeth to many that the heauen stirreth not though in truth it be otherwise
for it is the heauen which turneth and taketh and carieth away the sunne with it so causing him to performe his course
so likewise euery one knoweth that the daies nights yeeres and times are diuided and measured by the course of the sunne but the ignorant and common people vnderstand not how this commeth to passe neither doe they consider of it
for these causes then there bee many who cannot acknowledge the excellencie magnificence and diuine glorie

which shineth in the heauens as they doe who haue beene conuersant in the studie of astronomie and astrologie considering that the celestiall light continually lightneth their vnderstanding
and without this guide all science little auaileth for the true knowledge of god
it is then from astronomers that wee learne

how that besides the course which the sunne moone do ordinarily make within the space of fower and twenty howers which is commonly called a naturall day as likewise all the other planets and starres make their course by violence of the course of the highest heauen who comprising all the spheres within the concauitie thereof carrieth them away with him and causeth them to performe the same course which he pursueth like to a great wheele that should draw about other lesser ones that were conioined with it besides say this common course of all the heauenly bodies the sunne the moone and the other planets haue another course proper peculiar to euery of their spheres which god hath assigned them according to which the sunne performeth his in
daies and sixe howers and certaine minutes as long obseruation and daily experience hath taught those who haue diligently applied themselues to the contemplation of the heauens who likewise haue knowledge of the proper course of the moone and euery one of the starres as hath beene alreadie related in our precedent speeches

now as by the first course and motion of the sunne we haue a distinction of the daies and nights so likewise by the second course thereof is giuen vnto vs the difference of their length and shortnes and the distinction of the yeeres and diuers seasons
for we take the succession of the yeeres from this second course of the sunne as from the moone we haue the distinction of the moneths according to which she encreaseth decreaseth as we ordinarily behold by reason of the diuers opposition of the sunne from whom she receiueth her light in such quantitie as is sufficient for her to shine vpon the earth

so ecclesiasticus saith that the lord hath made the moone to appeere according to her seasons which shoulde be a declaration of the time and for a perpetuall signe that the feasts are appointed according to her her light diminishing to the last end and the moneths take their name of her and that she groweth woonderously in her changing
likewise each one knoweth that the moone declareth the times fit to sowe plant loppe in to do other such like businesses

whereof one must iudge according to the state and disposition of her
so then these two great lights the sunne and moone are most notable before all the world forsomuch as euerie one may see with his eies if he be not altogither depriued of vnderstanding the excellent works which god performeth in them and by them

and therefore also the holy scripture doth propose them vnto vs more often and more especially to induce vs to consider of the maiestie of god in his works then any other of the celestiall bodies which are infinite in number
which for this cause none can know particularly nor yet number them nor name them saue god alone as his word teacheth vs by his prophet saying he counteth the number of the starres and calleth them all by their names
whereupon we may affirme that all that wee shall heere discourse vpon and that the most subtile amongst men can describe is a very small thing in respect of the greatnes and excellencie which their creator hath engraued in them
but yet by this which is proposed vnto vs wee may easily consider into what an admiration men should be rauished if it might be permitted them to behold view and contemplate fully and in perfection all the stately works of the heauens and of all the lights in them contained and to vnderstand their natures effects and properties and all the beautie and goodly order which therein is and the great vtilitie which thereby redoundeth to men and to all creatures
for all therein is disposed by an excellent order like an host and armie whereof god is the leader and gouernour

and therefore this whole ornament of the heauen and of these faire lights is called in the scripture the host armie and soldiers of heauen and god who is the lord prince and the great and soueraigne captaine is likewise named the lord of hosts

moreouer as we haue noted that in the succession of day and night the prouidence of god doth publikely declare it selfe so haue we excellent testimonies in the diuersitie of the monthes

and of the seasons which are throughout the yeere
for some are cold others excessiue hot some drie and some wet some temperate and other some vntemperate
for according as the sunne doth approch neere or recule from vs or as it is higher or lower according as our sight considereth it and the situation of the places and countries which wee inhabite doth present it vnto vs and that his heate remaineth more or lesse vpon the earth

by meanes of his proper and particular course so haue we the daies longer or shorter and the nights likewise and more or lesse hot cold drie and wet weather and more temperatenes and vntemperatenes so that it may seeme that the yeere is distinguished by diuers ages like to the life of man
and therefore many say that the is as the infancie and childhood of the yeere the sommer like the youth and virilitie thereof autumne like the ripe age inclining to oldnes and winter like the decrepite and last age wherein it seemeth that all is mortified and become dead then we behold the againe returne like a new creation and reparation of the world and consequently al the rest of the seasons not failing of the time ordained to them
for as the sunne neuer faileth to bring the day in due time so likewise doth it not faile to distinguish alwaies vnto vs the diuers seasons in euery yeere in such sort as it hath done from the beginning

the moone also hath her proper effects in all these things and is very powerfull as well among liuing creatures as among the fruits of the earth through the changes which are in her
for it is seene by experience that according as she encreaseth or decreaseth so doe the humours in all creatures augment and diminish and are tender or firme and change diuersly
moreouer as this planet altereth hir course so doth the weather change in disposition turning sometimes into raine sometimes being faire and sometimes tempestuous
but aboue all the power which god hath placed in hir manifesteth it selfe most euidently in the waters of the sea especially in the flowings and ebbings thereof
and although that amongst so many effects produced by these two goodly lights

there are great contrarieties and maruellous differences yet god by his prouidence can reduce them to singular agreement and make them all returne to one bound and point
for the excesse of the one is the temperature of the other
for as one season is apt to sowe and plant in so is another fit to make the fruits grow and ripen in and another is proper to gather them in and prepare them to serue our vses
and as the cold and drought doe much hinder corruptions and infections which might arise through excessiue heate and wetnes so doth heate and moisture temperate the great cold and drinesse and conserue and repaire that which they would destroy so that by the one of these qualities the defect of the other is supplied and the excesse of the one is the temperature of the other as we haue heard that

there commeth to passe by the succession of day and night which causeth that many commodities do flow to men and animals
by how much the more we consider of these things by so much the more shall we finde occasion to woonder at the works and prouidence of god
for whereas the propertie of one contrarie is to destroy another he hath so well tempered and reconciled them that he causeth the one to be preserued by the other yea that the one cannot subsist without the aide of his companion
which taketh place not onely in these things which we haue here alreadie mentioned but likewise in all creatures which are in the vniuersall world
for it is all composed of contrarie natures
and yet god their father maketh them to fit so well togither that he reduceth all discord into concord and all enimitie into amitie as the example is notable in mans bodie being compounded of elements and qualities cleane contrarie one to another and yet conioined by such a vnitie that the composition and preseruation is most firme and assured so long time as it pleaseth god to maintaine his worke
but this matter will be more cleerely expounded when we shall discourse of the elementarie world
yet before we leaue the woorthie subiect which hath been giuen vs to discourse vpon the celestiall fires it will not be a little fruitfull if we consider of the image of god and of his eternall light which is proposed to vs in the sunne and how the felicitie of mans life is represented by changing of the light into darknes
which aram desire that we may heare of you

of the image of god and of his light which is proposed to vs in the sunne with the felicitie of mans life in the changing of light and of darknes

those matters which hitherto haue been by vs deliuered concerning the celestiall bodies although they be very briefly touched of vs yet may they serue for a very good foundation· to giue vs some entrance into a more loftie and more excellent astrologie wherein we haue the word of god for our guide
for it is easie for vs alreadie to vnderstand if wee bee well instructed concerning the vnitie of god in trinitie of persons and if we haue in memorie the discourse

which we haue helde concerning the creation of heauen and of the celestial bodies what goodly images of this diuine essence we haue pourtraied in them principally in the sunne who alone is in the world sufficient for the totall vniuers euen as there is but one god who is the sufficiencie of all creatures
moreouer as this visible sunne is a fountaine of light which is neuer exhausted nor yet diminisheth in communicating himselfe with all creatures

but is perpetuall so is it of god concerning whome it is written that he hath garnished the excellent workes of his wisedome being from euerlasting and to euerlasting for euer and that vnto him nothing can be added neither can he be diminished

moreouer when it is said of god that he dwelleth in vnaccessible light by reason that it is incomprehensible to all creatures

and when he is called the father of light and his sonne iesus christ the sonne of iustice and the light of the world and his word and likewise they who heare it and who receiue it are called lights candles lampes and burning torches we must by so many testimonies propound vnto vs in our vnderstanding another inuisible and spirituall world of which this same visible and corporall one is nothing but a verie rude pourtraiture an image much differing from that which it representeth so conclude that if this image and picture that which yet we behold not but as in a dim glasse be a thing so goodly and so excellent that indeed it may be couered with the vaile of this all which we so much admire

for we may say with ecclesiasticus that there are hid yet many greater things then these be and we haue seene but few of his works
for as he addeth who hath seene him that hee may tell vs and who can magnifie him as he is consequently let vs set before our eies all this inuisible and spirituall world replenished with soules and spirits as we behold this visible world replenished with bodies and let vs contemplate twise as many spirituall eies in this intelligible sphere as there be corporall in all men and in other liuing creatures and then let vs mount vp to god and to iesus christ our lord which is the sonne that illuminateth and lightneth all and so let vs consider how bright this sonne must be and what is the light and splendor of him considering that he is the great sonne eternall infinite and incomprehensible who hath created that sunne which we behold the light whereof is not so much in proportion comparable with the least beame of the diuine light as is the brightnes

of the least star yea of a candle compared with all this visible sunne or as one drop of water balanced with the huge sea

now let vs consider that if the sight of this heauenly planet be pleasant to vs and bring vnto vs ioy and comfort through his light and heat being cause of so many profits and benefits to all creatures how much more should the contemplation of the great euerlasting sonne be delightfull vnto vs and what inexplicable benefits doth it bring to men namely to their soules and spirits for this is the true sunne of iustice which according to the prophet hath health in his wings that is in his beames

by which he maketh men enioy life eternall
and therefore verie fitly doth the scripture compare not onely the knowledge of god but also his fauour and grace and the times of prosperitie and of his aide and succour to the light as also it compareth mens ignorance of god and the times of aduersitie and of his furie and vengeance to the night and to darknes

for this cause isay willing to declare a great grace of god to the people of israell saith amongst other things
thou shalt haue no more sun to shine by day neither shall the brightnes of the moone shine vnto thee for the lord shall be thine euerlasting light and thy god thy glorie thy sunne shall neuer goe downe neither shall thy moone be hid for the lord shall be thine euerlasting light and the daies of thy sorrow shall be ended
and when the prophets denounce vnto men any great and horrible and fearfull iudgement of god they commonly say that the sunne

the moone and the stars shall loose their brightnes that the sunne shall waxe darke and the moone shall be turned into blood and the starres shall fall from heauen and the heauen it selfe shall rowle like a scrowle so that the whole face of the world shall be chaunged as if it should be turned vpside downe and perish cleane
and though these things come not to passe iust so in respect of the creatures yet doe the prophets by such manner of speech signifie the greatnes of the iudgements of god and of his wrath when he punisheth man
for though the nature which he hath created doth still remaine in one estate yet it happeneth commonly to men according to the feeling which they haue of the wrath of god except they be altogither obdurate against his iudgements as if the whole frame of the world were ouerturned and as if all creatures should set themselues against them to warre vpon them and confound them by rushing on them and

running at them

on the other side isay declaring the grace which god would shew to his people speaketh thus the people that walked in darkenes haue seene light they that dwelled in the land of the shadow of death vpon them hath the light shined

againe in another place arise oh ierusalem be bright for thy light is come and the glorie of the lord is risen vpon thee
for behold darkenes shall couer the earth and grosse darkenes the people but the lord shall arise vpon thee and his glorie shall be seene vpon thee
and the gentiles shall walke in thy light and kings at the brightnes of thy rising vp
but the prophet speaketh in another kinde of language to the people when he talketh to the wicked

and telleth them amongst other things therefore is iudgement far from vs and iustice doth not come neere vs we waite for light but loe it is darkenes for brightnes but we walke in darkenes
we grope for the wall like the blind and we feele with our hands as one that were without eies
we stumble at noone daies as in darkenes we are in solitarie places as dead men

and therefore also the kingdome of the diuel is called in the kingdome of darknes and he which is the king is named the prince of darkenes
but the people of god requesting that the knowledge of him might bee spread abroad throughout the whole earth with all prosperitie and blessednes saith in the psalmes

god be mercifull vnto vs and blesse vs and cause his face to shine amongst vs so likewise the author of these diuine canticles chaunteth to the same purpose
lord lift vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs

that is to say thy fauour and benignitie as afterwards he declareth

pursuing then this doctrine of the holy scriptures wee must learne by that which hath been propounded vnto vs concerning the image of god in the sunne and by the discourse of his light and of the darknes contrarie thereto

how the soueraigne and great eternall sunne hideth his face from vs and how he sheweth it vnto vs and what good and what euill doth thereby redound vnto vs according as his word teacheth vs in the testimonies
for as we haue in the course of nature one while day and another while night and those sometimes long sometimes short and as many of one as of another in one season sommer in another winter now hot anon cold then drie and afterward wet so at this time tempest presently calme weather euen so runnes all the course of mans life
for we haue therein the time

of ignorance and aduersitie of chastisements punishments and vengeance of god which are the night and time of darknes to men and their winter and tempestuous seasons
and so haue we the time of knowledge and vnderstanding of god and of prosperitie of grace of ioie of felicitie and of consolation which are to men like the day and the light and as the sommer
and as the daies and nights are some longer and some shorter so the lord prolongeth or abridgeth the times of grace and of rigor of his fauor and of his wrath as he pleaseth and in such measure as he knoweth to be expedient as well for his owne glorie as for the good of his elect
wherefore as we expect day after the night the and sommer after autumne and winter so in the time of aduersitie we must attend in good confidence the time of prosperitie as we are assured to haue light after darknes
likewise as in the day time we looke for the night and for autumne and winter after the and sommer so in time of prosperitie we must prepare for aduersitie
for as it is written to all things there is an appointed time

and therefore there is a time of ioy and a time of sorrow a time to laugh and a time to weepe
now if we could consider these things by the course of the sunne and by the change and succession of the daies and nights of the light and of darknes and of the diuers seasons which succeed in each yeere we should learne in this schoole a most profitable and laudable astronomie which is not found in the bookes of ptolemie nor of all the other astrologers how skilfull soeuer they were which haue written concerning the knowledge of the stars
for when we should be in prosperitie we would take heede not to abuse our selues to misgouerne our selues and become too insolent as it ordinarily commeth to passe when we are too much at our ease and thinke it will be alwaies so with vs
and thereupon ensueth that so soone as we are deceiued of our perswasion we become desperate bicause that we find our selues in the danger and snares of mischance before we thinke of it
but when we shall consider the reuolutions and changes which haue been accustomed to come to the world we shall foresee like good astrologers and prognosticators the tempest comming a far off and the eclipses of the sunne and of the moone and while it is day we shall prepare for the night and in sommer time for the winter like good
so likewise being in aduersitie we shall not loose courage nor despaire but we shall comfort

our selues in the hope of gods helpe and will patiently endure the bad season vntill such time as he hath by the light of his fauor and grace chased away the darknes of the scourges of his wrath and vengeance
thus concluding the subiect of our speech let vs intreate especially of the eclipses of the sunne and moone and of their nature and effects
for we may thereby againe receiue excellent instructions for this life as achitob you can declare vnto vs

of the eclipses of the sunne and moone and of the image which we haue therein of the constancie which is in god and of the inconstancie of men and of humane things
chap

achitob

the consideration of the eclipses of the sunne and moone hath opened to men the knowledge of many excellent secrets in nature as the writings of the learned make mention

now they concur all in this point that the eclipse of the sun happeneth through the diametrall interposition of the moone betweene it and the earth and that the shadow of the earth reaching out betwixt the sunne and moone causeth hir also to be darkened eclipsed so that as the moone depriueth the earth of the brightnes of the so likewise doth the shadow of the earth hinder the moone of the solarie illumination
but the eclipses of these two planets doe differ greatly

for that of the sunne happeneth not through default of light in the bodie thereof as it doth in the eclipse of the moone
for the sunne is neuer without light inasmuch as it is the proper substance thereof
but when the earth is directly between these two planets then doth the moone become thorough darke bicause she retaineth no light at least that may appeere to vs but onely so much as she receiueth from the sunne
therefore then according as her course is direct or opposite in respect of that of the sunne she doth augment or decrease in light continually changing hir estate in apparance and according as wee behold hir though that in effect and according to the veritie of hir essence she hath alwaies one halfe lightened by the sunne
for we must vnderstand that the moone is round like a bowle

and that alwaies except when she is eclipsed

she receiueth light from the sunne into one halfe of her globe the other halfe remaining without brightnes
but insomuch as she mooueth continually therefore according as she retireth from or approcheth to the sunne so doth she appeere diuers in her light which notwithstanding doth illuminate at all times one moitie of hir circularly from one part to another that is from hir superior part to hir inferior part or from hir inferior to hir superior part
now hir inferior or lower part is that which looketh towards the earth all of which or any part thereof we behold when it is lightened and hir superior or vpper part is that which is towards the sphere of the sunne which we cannot behold although it be illuminated by him
now once a moneth all hir inferior moitie receiueth the brightnes of the sunne and then doth she appeere vnto vs full of light which commeth to passe on the fifteenth day of the moones age bicause that then she doth oppositely confront the sunne
another time the superior moitie is fully illuminated to wit when she is conioined with the sunne which is ouer hir and then is hir lower part darkened not appeering to vs for two daies which commeth to passe at the ende of the moone and all the rest of the moneth she hath diuers illuminations
for from hir coniunction with the sunne the light in the vpper part beginneth to faile and by little and little to come to the lower part towardes vs according as shee mooueth reculing from the sunne and so doth till the fifteenth day wherein all the inferior part towardes the earth is shining and the superiour part is cleane without light
after which time the light beginneth to conuey it selfe to the vpper moitie decreasing by little and little towards vs in the lower moitie which at last is left cleane without brightnes and the other which wee see not becommeth all shining
and it is to be noted that the hornes of the moone which hir diuers aspect sheweth vs turne their towards the sunne and if shee encreaseth they are turned towards the sunne rising if she be in the waine they turne to the sun setting
she shineth moreouer adding to each day three quarters and the fower and twentith part of an hower beginning from the second day till the time she make full moone and from that time forwards vsing the like substraction euery day till the time that she appeereth no more at all
and when she is within fowerteene degrees of the sunne she is seene no more
whereby it

appeereth

that all the rest of the planets are greater then the moone for none of them is hidde or obscured by the beames of the sunne except it be within seuen degrees thereof
but in that they are all of them higher then the moone is they seeme to be lesser so in the same consideration it commeth to passe that the brightnes of the sunne hindreth vs of the sight of the fixed stars in the day time which neuerthelesse shine as well in the day as in the night time as may be perceiued at the eclipses of the sunne as likewise in a very deepe pit if one should descend thereunto in the day time

moreouer all these stars are neuer eclipsed for the shadow of the earth which causeth the moone to loose hir light reacheth not beyond her heauen
and the night also is no other thing but the shadow of the earth which shadow is in forme like a pyramis growing still lesse and lesse taperwise towards a point till at last it fadeth for all shadowes waxe lesse and lesse till they be cleane diminished by distance as may euidently bee seene by shadowes of birdes which flie in the aire
now the shadow of the earth finisheth in the aire at the beginning of the region of fire aboue the moone al things are pure wherfore it is not possible that the terrestriall shadow can hinder the brightnes of the stars which are aboue the moone
and therefore likewise we behold them in the night time like a candle in a darke place
but the shadow of the earth is the very cause that the moone is eclipsed alwaies by night

and it is to be noted in that that the eclipses both of the sunne and moone happen not euery moneth that it is by reason of the obliquenes of the zodiacke and of the variable motions of the moone which being sometimes north and sometimes south as wee haue heeretofore declared meeteth not alwaies in coniunction or in opposition in the knots of the ecliptick circle which are in the head or in the taile of the dragon
we may note also that the consideration of the shadowes and eclipses aforesaid hath taught men to iudge of the greatnes of the sunne of the moone and of the earth

for first it should be impossible that there had been any vniuersall eclipse of the sunne by the diametrall interposition of the moone if the earth were greater then the moone
againe this planet and the shadow of the earth deliuereth vnto vs greater certaintie that the vnmeasurable magnitude of the sunne is much more then their owne

in such sort that as plinie saith there need nothing more be required to iudge of the immensitie

of the sunne by the eie or by coniectures sith that the trees planted by the way side haue all of them their shadowes proportionably equall though there be much distance of ground betwixt them as if the sunne were in the midst of them and did giue light to all alike
and during the time that the sunne is in the ouer the southerne climates and regions he casteth his light downe right without making any shadow and yet in the north regions on this side the the shadowes fall on the north side at noone and toward the west at sunne rising which could not happen if the sunne were not very much greater then the earth
but leauing this discourse we must out of our speech learne some point of christian astrologie
now we haue heard that the moone hath no light of her selfe at least that can appeere vnto vs but so much as she receiueth from the sunne according to the disposition or opposition of their diuers courses in such sort that the moon neuer persisteth in one estate but changeth incessantly
but it is not so with the sunne for he hath alwaies as much light at one time as at another and is not subiect to any change
say then that in him we haue a goodly image of the constant and immutable god who is alwaies one

and euer without any variation and who firme in his counsell hath ordained concerning all things for euer according to his endlesse right and iust will

so contrariwise we haue represented to vs in the moone a perfect figure of the creatures by which is demonstrated vnto vs that all things vnder heauen are mutable and subiect to continuall change and also that according as we receiue our saluation in christ through faith and as we increase therein in such degree are wee made partakers of his diuine light and of all his graces and blessings euen as the moone participateth of the brightnes of the sunne

moreouer we shall haue learned a woorthie point of christian astrologie when we shall consider that as these two celestiall planets haue perpetuall alliance and communication togither euen so the coniunction which is betwixt iesus christ and his church is eternall
and therfore according as it is said in the common prouerbe god keepeth the moone from wolues the faithfull may very aptly speake this of themselues concerning their enemies bicause they are much surer in the alliance of the almightie and vnder his protection
for as the sunne shall neuer be without the moone nor the moone without the sunne so the eternall sonne of god shall

neuer be without his church nor his church without him although we see it sometimes increase and sometimes decrease and sometimes as if it cleane failed and were vanished like the eclipsed moone
but as the moone doth not so faile by any eclipse that can happen but that it persisteth to remaine a moone still though she be not seene of men so the church can neuer cleane faile nor bee so consumed but that it shall euer bee a church notwithstanding that it may seeme to humane sight and exterior appeerance to be nothing at all and without any vigor
for it is founded vpon the firme rocke which is iesus christ and therefore all the power of hell cannot preuaile against it nor waste it
and the lord can alwaies tell who be his though men knowe it not
next we must learne that as the moone is eclipsed when she is so opposed to the sunne that the shadowe of the earth spread out betweene them both hindreth her to receiue that light from him which she is accustomed to attract so commeth it to men in the church when their sinnes are like an obscure cloud and an obstacle which hindreth the fauor and grace of god that it cannot attaine to them and when there be mists and darknesses of ignorance which doe detaine them from beholding of iesus christ the true sunne of their soules and to commit themselues to be guided by the light of his worde
but as the sunne faileth not though hee be eclipsed in regarde of vs so the soueraigne head of the elect doth neuer faile to his church though hee may seeme sometimes to bee absent and quite withdrawen for hee alwaies supporteth it by his power
and therefore also it is written that the woman by whome the church is signified hath the moone vnder hir feete

which is as much to say as that the conuersation of the children of god which are members of the church is not in earth but in heauen as saint paule testifieth and that they haue already put vnder their feete all worldly things

which are mutable and inconstant insomuch as they liue after the spirit not after the flesh

are illuminated by iesus christ who is the true sunne of iustice that by the brightnes of his word and of his comming discouereth all things
it is most certaine that the number of these is verie small in respect of those worldly men

who following the nature of elementarie and corporall things are subiect to greater changes then the moone hirselfe which being lower then all the other stars planets by so much neerer to the earth receiueth likewise some mutation

greater then the rest of the starres as if god would represent vnto vs in her the changings whereto the elements and all creatures composed of them which are vnder the celestiall spheres are ordinarily subiect
and yet doth not the moone change from her proper nature which was ordained by the creator from the beginning as we haue already declared yea though that in regard of vs and of our sight she haue the foresaid mutations yet doth she neuer faile but doth euermore repaire himselfe and presentlie renue so that we see her not weare away in such manner but that she persisteth without ceasing in her proper and naturall course
but it is not so with men who change not onelie from day to day but also from hower to hower from instant to instant from age to age
for as they daily proceed in growth of body and of strength from the hower of their conception and birth from time to time vntill they be arriued to their full vigor like the full moone so after they are ascended to this degree they alwaies abate and decline till their extreamest age and to death wherein they vtterly faile in respect of this life as if they had neuer beene
for they cannot do like the moone who after her defect doth continually repaire and restore herselfe till such time as she shew herselfe full and entier but they are constrained to attend for that last day

which is called by saint peter the day of the restitution and restauration of all things foretold by the prophets
so then in that day shall we be renued in a permanent estate for euer
behold then what me seemeth we must consider like christians vpon our discourses of the sunne and of the moone
and hauing hitherto entreated of the heauenlie world and of the spheres sufficiently to content a christian astronomer we will now proceed to describe the elementary world whereof aser you shall begin to speake instructing vs in the principles of naturall and corruptible things

of the beginning of naturall and corruptible things
chapter

aser

all philosophers with one consent do teach that there hath beene at first or at one must vnderstand so some subiect without forme

capable of all formes which they called matter or hyle that is to

say the substance or stuffe which some also haue named chaos and which is properly described by moses in these hebrew wordes tohu bohu which is as much to say as wot not what thing without forme containing by possibilitie all that which could be formed
plato in his timaeo calleth it a bosome without forme a power which is mother of the world a nurse a subiect and a receptacle of formes and saith that it was not distinguished by any quantity nor by any degree
and bicause that out of this first subiect innumerable things were to be produced anaxagoras disputeth how that in the same were co~tained infinit formes and numbers not limited which the onely vnderstanding and thought creator of all things had drawne out in effect
and this aristotle attributeth to nature though sometimes he seemeth to distinguish this nature from god and make them companions oftentimes repeating these words god and nature made or made nothing without cause
now for vs wee know that that nature which the philosophers called disposing distin+guishing can be nothing else but god only as appeereth by sundry reasons which we haue heretofore deduced
wherefore holding this to be confessed we must be sure that the perpetuall generation of things declareth that it is a matter which hath at first beene made by some other meanes
for corne commeth of the earth and of humor animals of seede and of bloud or egges ashes are made by wood and there is nothing so little but it is made of some subiect
but in all these generations it is necessarie that something remaine from which they are drawne in their first originall
when then any creature is engendred by another if the forme perish and any thing do remaine it must of necessitie be the matter

which the corruption it selfe doth manifest because that nothing can wholy perish so long as it is corrupted
for the apple perisheth and is conuerted into wormes so is the wood into cinders when it is burned so water changeth it selfe into vapors and smoke by the heate of the fire or of the sunne
now all vapor and smoke is something for it can stifle a man and if it be receiued and gathered into a vessell it turneth to drops of water
behold then how manifest it is that in all this vniuers there is a certaine thing hidden vnder euerie forme which is not made by common generation nor yet doth perish by corruption and which like some prime subiect being diuided vnder many and sundry formes wee call as we haue alreadie

said the first matter not engendred permanent because it perisheth not but remaineth and consisteth according to the effect thereof
and when we compare it to the formes we saie that it is by power the same which they are because that it can receiue all formes so that the matter of a childe being formed is said to be a childe by power and by effect it is the subiect whereof the childe may consist for it is a mixture so fashioned and such as one may see it
but when it is compared to the forme of the childe it is simplie called a matter by power for if it were such by effect then were it a childe of it selfe not a subiect of him
so then by the consent of all philosophers there is a certaine grosse matter disfurnished of formes but capable of all though by nature it be depriued of all
for which cause also they establish with this matter priuation

for a beginning of naturall things
and mounting higher they consider of a changing or working cause by force whereof the matter being wrought and mollified which is onely in power is at length actually performed euen as waxe being plied and softned by handling and working in the hand is fashioned into diuers formes according to the will of him that doth it

and because that nature doth nothing at aduenture but al for some good purpose thence it is that the finall cause is by some considered as a principle

and likewise because that the neerest end of the working cause is the forme which it taketh out of the bosome of the matter and that for this intent it worketh and mouldeth it to the end to reduce it to a perfect estate to receiue a forme for these causes aristotle constituteth the forme for the third principle
the which cannot be drawne out of the wombe of the matter except it be first disposed and prepared by conuenient qualities and therefore the philosophers say that about them the maker bestoweth and emploieth all his labour and all the time of the action to the end that the species may presently appeere in a point moment vnseparable as it were for the wages of his paines
but the peripateticks call the worker the cause rather then a principle
and the followers of plato being more in sacred mysteries doe teach that although the naturall causes do appeere to vs of themselues forming fashioning

and moulding euerie bodie yet neuerthelesse are they not the prime and first causes of euerie thing that is made but rather instruments of the diuine art to whom they serue and obey euen as the hands

of a cunning workeman though they compose place and change the whole matter of an house as wood stone and morter and that nothing besides them may bee seene whereto the fashion of the edifice might bee attributed yet are they knowne of vs to be an instrument obeying and seruiceable to the idea which being seated in the minde of the architect he performeth and acteth with his hands in sensible matter the worke which he hath conceiued
and for this occasion the academicks speake of these two causes the instrumental and the exemplarie cause when they intreat of the framing of all things
which me thinketh is often confirmed by the peripatetickes when this axiom is read in their writings euerie worke of nature is the worke of intelligence
and both the one and the other do confesse that god hath drawne all things out of the matter
but because that for to drawe them out the matter must necessarily be presupposed and the forme which thereof is fashioned must be conceiued as also the power or application and disposition of the said matter

thereupon are sprung the three principles of naturall things which aristotle ordayneth to wit matter forme and priuation
which opinion pythagoras seemed to leane vnto teaching that in the first production of things there were present the euen and the odde for the euen according to the doctrine of those which doe philosophically discourse by numbers and principally the binarie or number of two signifieth the matter and the vneuen or odde betokeneth the forme
moreouer the degrees of formes and things composed are excellently and harmoniously distributed by the euen and odde numbers as by their writings we may easily learne
but let vs note that that which the pythagorians signifie by numbers plato doth abundantly describe by greatnes and smalnes because all that which is doth retaine a greater or lesse degree of essence and perfection which neuerthelesse is distinguished by euen and odde numbers
and if one speake of bodies euery one of them hath a great little or meane quantitie which likewise is by the same numbers limited and distinguished

but to leaue the curious disputation concerning these things to the philosophers and so to grow to the conclusion of our speech concerning the principles of naturall and corruptible things we must call that into our memorie which we haue alreadie declared how that the matter stood in need of a worker

and ordayner
now this same is none other

but the alone and onely principle of principles and the cause of causes god omnipotent author of the vniuers who being a soueraigne worker hath produced out of the subiect by him created all compound bodies
from whom likewise it is necessarie that all formes doe flow whether they be drawne out of the bosome of the matter as some philosophers affirme or proceed without any meanes of the as many learned dispute for he must alwaies be said to be engendring and producing which draweth the matter into an effect by any manner whatsoeuer
moreouer

some subtile spirits do account among the principles of naturall things motion and place
for they say that the principle motion seemeth to be naturally in all bodies of which some as light are carried aloft others as heauie descend downe and yet are they not forcibly driuen for then violently they would returne to their proper place
neither are they drawen for the place is an accident and draweth no element at all
then forsomuch as all motion is made in place it seemeth verie well that it must be set for one of the principles of all things
now place is the supreme superficies of euerie bodie enuironing the same round about which superficies remayneth the bodie being separated
and euerie place is equall to the bodie therein contayned
euerie bodie likewise is in a place and in euerie place is a bodie
for euerie bodie hath his extreme superficies and the place cannot be without a bodie considering that euerie place is the highest superficies contayning a bodie
and when the place is taken in regard of the roundnes of the heauens it is immutable insomuch as it contayneth the entire bodie of the vniuers
but being considered as the superficies of any particular bodie it is changed by the diuers disposition and alteration of the creatures and remayneth not alwaies the same
behold then that which haue thought worthie to be summarily noted in regard of the principles whereof the philosophers dispute and of which and by which namely of the forme and first matter the sensible elements of all corruptible things doe consist and are composed
whereof we are according to the course of our talke to enforme our selues as amana you shall presently do

of the elements and of things to be considered in them in that they are distinguished by the number of fower

when we take the heauen in his most proper signification we meane thereby the firmament and the celestiall spheres which couer and encompasse all things that are in the vniuersall world
but heauen is likewise taken oftimes for the aire and for the regions next to the spheres because they approch neerest to the nature of them and for that they be elements drawne out of the first principles for the composition of corruptible things
and yet in the diuision of the world there are commonly mentioned but two principall parts that is the celestiall and the elementary part as we haue heretofore related
now vnder this last part whereof our ensuing discourse must entreat we must vnderstand all that which is comprehended within the concauitie or hollow vault of heauen vnder the moone euen to the center of the earth

that is the fower simple elements which are fire aire water and earth incessantly employed in the generation and corruption of all creatures vnder the which part we comprise all the diuers and innumerable species of all bodies both perfect and imperfect

materially engendred by the naturall commixture and power of the said elements
which cannot be in number aboue fower that is iust so many and neither more nor lesse then there are first qualities predomina~t in them which are heat moisture colde and drienes which neuerthelesse alone and by themselues do not constitute an element for they cannot haue the power both to doe and to suffer as it is needfull that there should be in the generation and corruption of all things neither can the foresaid qualities consist aboue two together for feare least contrarie things should be found in one selfe same subiect but being ioyned two and two they are correspondent the one to the other as the qualities of heat and drines which are in the fire the heat moisture which are in the aire cold moisture which are in the water and cold drines which are in the earth
but heat cold which are actiue qualities and moisture drines

which are passiue qualities are altogether contrarie
and therefore can they not co~sist both together in one selfe same element

wherupon it co~meth to passe that the fire the water the aire the earth are cleane contrarie one to another which causeth also that the fire as the most subtile lightest element tending naturally vpwards is placed aboue the other three elements and enuironeth the aire round about which agreeth in heate with it which aire encompasseth the water agreeing therewith in moisture and the water is dispersed about the earth and agreeth therewith in coldnes and the same earth as the most heauie and hardest element is heaped and compacted togither in the midst of the whole world containing the center thereof
it is certaine that the water enuironeth not the earth cleane round about but is spread abroad by diuers armes branches and lakes which we call seas as well within as about the same for so it was necessarie that some partes of the earth might be vncouered for the health and habitation of liuing creatures so as it hath pleased the soueraigne king of the world to ordaine for the benefit of all things

there are then fower elements first foundations of things compounded and subiect to corruption

and by this number of fower perfectly consonant the elementarie world is diuided into these fower partes the firie the airie the watrie and the earthy part so also is this terrestriall frame distinguished into fower points to wit east west north and south as we knowe the like to be in the celestiall bodies
and by their diuers motions and courses we obtaine the fower seasons of the yeere to wit the spring sommer autumne and winter
from whence likewise proceedeth all aide and fauor to the substance and composition of the creatures comprised vnder these fower kindes that is corporall vegetable sensitiue and reasonable creatures which subsist of these fower qualities hot cold moist and drie
we likewise see that all quantitie is diuided into fower to wit into a point into a length bredth and depth
there are also fower sortes of motion ascending descending progression and turning round
moreouer if we will here drawe out some mysteries of the pythagorians we shall knowe that all the foundation of euery deepe studie and inuention must be setled vpon the number of fower bicause it is the roote and beginning of all numbers which exceed fower
for a vnitie being ioined to a fower maketh vp ten and in this number all the rest to ten are found as may appeere in this

figure



aboue which number of ten as aristotle in his problemes and hierocles in his verses vpon pythagoras reciteth no land nor language hath euer proceeded
for the hebrues greekes latins and barbarians themselues being come so farre as to ten begin againe with an vnitie saying

and so forward imitating nature guided by her soueraigne who by the order of tens parteth the fingers of the hands and toes of the feete as the same creator would distribute the terrestriall celestiall and supercelestiall world by this number of ten as the diuinitie of the hebrues doth teach and as we haue heretofore made mention
the which number likewise doth containe all manner of numbers be they euen odde square long plaine perfect cubicall pyramidall prime or compound numbers
and thereby that is by denarie proportions fower cubicall numbers are accomplished so fower is the roote of ten and ten of an hundred and an hundred of a thousand
for as


and
make ten so by tens are hundreds made and by hundreds thousands
moreouer foure containeth all musicall harmonie bicause that therein is the proportion double triple quadruple of so much and an halfe and of so much a third wherof resulteth the diapason the bisdiapason diapente diatesseron and diapason togither with diapente
for this cause hierocles the interpreter of pythagoras doth so extoll this number of fower that he affirmeth it to be the cause of all things and that nothing can be said or done which proceedeth not from it as from the roote and foundation of all nature
and therfore did the pythagorians sweare by this number as by some holy thing making as may be easily coniectured allusion to that great name of the hebrues

from whom they receiued their instructions
which name of the holy of holies god eternall and most good requireth no fewer letters among the greekes and latines no not amongst the most barbarous nations wherein one may directly beleeue that great mysteries are hidden

but not to wander farther from our elementarie region as therein we acknowledge fower elements so many likewise are there in the metaphysicks to wit the essence the estate the vertue and the action
the naturalist also teacheth fower nurses of nature to wit power growth the forme growne and the composition
and the mathematicians haue these fower elements the point the line the plaine and the solid
and that which the point

is in the mathematicks the same is the seminarie power in the phisickes the line is as the naturall growth the plaine or superficies as the forme perfect in greatnes and the solide or cube or deepe bodie as the composition
there are amongst the morall philosophers also fower seedes of vertues prudence temperatenes or temperance fortitude and iustice
and there are fower faculties found to iudge of things that is vnderstanding discipline opinion and the senses
artificers likewise accustome to settle their buildings vpon fower corners to the end they may be firme and durable wherein they imitate nature which worketh so in all this world
and the soueraigne gouernor thereof hath willed that there should be fower foundations of the most perfect eternall and firme law of grace to wit the fower euangelists

it then plainly appeereth that not without great mysterie the creator setled fower foundations of all this mundane frame which in admirable proportion doe accord togither as al square numbers which are inclosed by a proper number referre themselues by a middle proportionall to both sides
for as we haue said the elements are agreeable one to another with their coupled qualities whereof each retaineth one peculiar qualitie to it selfe and agreeth in the other as by a meane with the next element
so that the fower elements are as if each one of them had two hands by which they held one another as in a round daunce or else as if they were conioined and linked togither as with chains and buckles
and therefore the water is moist and cold retaining the moisture as peculiar to it selfe and in coldnes participating with the nature of the earth by the moisture thereof it is also allied vnto the aire which also in some measure participateth in heate with the nature of fire
wherefore as the earth accordeth in coldnes with the water so is the water answerable in moisture to the aire and the aire is correspondent in heate to the fire retaining yet neuertheles each of them one proper predominant qualitie
but aboue all the academicks haue inuented a goodly concord betweene these elements in their discourses of the quadruple proportion from which onely their musicall proportions doe proceede for if one passe farther mens eares seeme to bee offended
they say then

that the fire is twise more subtile then the aire thrise more mooueable and fower times more pearsing
likewise that the aire is twise more sharpe then the water thrise more subtile and fower times more mooueable

againe that the water is twise more sharpe then the earth thrise more subtile and more mooueable
and in this proportion haue they found out the harmonie of the elements and shewed that though the fire be sharpe subtile and mooueable the aire subtile mooueable and moist the water mooueable moist and corporall the earth corporall immooueable and dry yet is there a certaine accord and vnion betweene them bicause that betwixt the fire and the earth the aire and water haue been placed by such a couenant that there is the same respect betwixt the fire and the aire that is betweene the aire and the water and betweene the water and the earth and againe that such as the earth is towards the water such is the water towards the aire and the aire towards the fire in correspondencie of qualities and harmonious contrarietie
wherefore they conclude that the harmonie is on all sides so great among the elements that it is no maruell if in their proper places and in their compounds they maintaine and repose themselues with very great and friendly concord
whereby it appeereth that none can induce a goodlier reason why the water doth not ouerflow the earth being higher then it then to say that it will not swarue from this agreement
but further concerning this matter what shall we say of those which accept but of three elements namely the aire the water and the earth and reiect the elementary fire would faine heare you aram discourse thereof

of the opinion of those who admit but three elements not acknowledging the elementary fire
chapter

aram

betweene the lowest place and the highest it is necessarie that there shoulde be two places simplie meane to wit the places not exactly lowest nor highest
and for that consideration some of the learned conclude that there be so many simple bodies made and consisting of the prime and first matter which are called by the greekes undefined span alphabet that is beginnings or elements of those proceedeth the generation of all corruptible things
and if probable arguments may ought preuaile each one must acknowledge fower elements in all compound bodies as the most part of those who haue diligently

considered the workes of nature are of opinion
now there is none that can doubt of the earth of the water and of the aire because of their greatnes and huge extension seene by euery eie
but for the fire we onely see the increase the power and simple matter thereof and his force or fountaine is esteemed to be in the concauitie of the moone aboue the aire

yet some among the naturall philosophers affirme and maintaine that there is no fire vnder the orbe of the moone neither will acknowledge any other elementary fire but the fires of the celestial bodies and the heate of them which they communicate to all the rest of the creatures
and therefore they assigne to these fires all the space which is from the moone to the highest heauen
saying moreouer that sith the heauen is a thing most pure it is not conuenient to place a thing most burning vnder that which is exempt from all qualitie
for nature doth alwaies ioine extremities with things of meane qualitie as is found betwixt the flesh and the bones where she hath placed a filme or thinne skinne and betweene the bones and the ligatures she hath put the gristles so betwixt the scull and the braine because it is softer then flesh nature hath placed two filmes the hardest whereof is neerest to the bone of the head
thereupon then they conclude that the aire is much fitter then the fire to bee next the heauens and serue as a meane to ioine them with the earth and water
and against it they argue that swiftnes of motion is the cause or argument of the heate and that there is no other fire others againe auouch that this cannot be
for say they although that solide substances may by motion be heated as stones lead and liuing creatures yet those which disperse or scatter themselues abroad become thereby so much the colder by how much they are more lightly mooued witnes the aire and the water
for all strong and swift windes are cold and riuers that haue a quick course are very cold
againe those that denie the elementarie fire

do bring this argument to wit that the comets and flames which oftentimes do appeere in the heauens do cause in the aire verie great and as it were intollerable heates therefore they demand what might happen if the vniuersall world especially the elementarie were enuironed by fire who could hinder but that that fire would inflame the aire and after it all other things sith the heate of the celestiall bodies would thereto giue aide they adde how auerrois doth esteeme that all brightnes is hot and that the aire is

such and that euery moist qualitie doth least of all other resist heate
how then say they shall the aire resist the fire which is the most vehement and most sharpe of all elements it is true that this arabicke author hath said that sometimes the fire is not actually hot but what then shall be his possibilitie we say that some medicines are hot by possibilitie because that being taken they heat woondrously
but by what creatures shall the fire be deuoured to the end to reduce it to the qualitie of medicines moreouer if the fire be not hot then is not the water cold which should be to confound al reason and the very order of the world
againe they demand what it is that letteth the fire that it shineth not and that it is not seene in the elementarie region againe if fire be in the aire why then the higher we mount doe we finde the aire more cold and why do snowes more abound on the mountaine tops then in the lowest places yea vnder the torrid zone which neuerthelesse might not seeme strange if one should consider how snowe falleth in winter onely and very colde haile in midst of summer the cause whereof we shall heereafter discouer
but say they if one should obiect that the highest places are farthest remote from the reuerberation of the sunne this may be an argument of lesse heate but not of coldnes
in fine they adde that if heate were in the highest of the aire in an elementary body it should principally there rest for to cause the generation of things
now for this reason it cannot be there considering that the celestiall heat is it that doth engender as al philosophers maintaine
thereupon they conclude that this imagination of fire aboue the aire is vaine
it seemeth also that be a thing neuer so light as is the fire yet can it not mount so exceeding high and to say that it was caried aloft onely coniecturing so and that the place thereof must be there such rhetoricall arguments are not woorth rehearsing in serious matters

there are some also which to the reasons by vs before touched in the beginning of this speech do replie that it seemeth they do not conclude that there be fower simple bodies but rather the contrarie
for for the first betwixt two extremes one meane not two is co~monly assigned which being considered in regard of the elements there shoulde onely be three in number
and for this vulgar opinion that in all compound bodies there are esteemed to bee fower elements the heat which is in mixt and compound substances cannot consist of elementarie

fire for if the fire shoulde remaine in them it should much more rest in the herbe called euphorbium and in pepper which are of an extreme hot and drie nature and therefore one might more commodiously get fire out of them then out of most colde stones which yet wee finde to bee cleane contrarie
moreouer the distillations wherein many straine themselues to search the fower elements doe demonstrate but three substances onely to wit water for water oile insteed of aire and the earth which is in the bottome
now if that any do say that the reddest part of the oyle doth represent the fire because it is verie sharpe and verie subtile we will answere that such piercing sharpnes of sauour proceedeth from the vehement vertue of the fire which operateth in the distillation
which likewise doth manifestly appeere in the oyle extracted from mettals euerie part whereof is of a verie sharpe sauour
wherefore if euerie thing of such a qualitie representeth the fire it must follow of necessity that in euerie such essence no portion of aire may subsist
but all the world doth alleage that there may fower humours be perceiued to remaine in the bodies of all liuing creatures
and yet what auaileth that to prooue so many elements nay what if should say with thrusianus expounder of galen vpon the art of phisicke that there are but three humors only but leaue we this disputation and let vs speake of a more strong and forcible argument taken from the combinations and coniunctions of the elementarie qualities which are in number fower as we haue heard in our precedent discourse
they alone then and apart doe not constitute an element for they cannot haue the power to doe and to suffer neither also can they consist more then two togegither for else contraries should remaine in one selfe same subiect
neither can heat be ioyned with cold without some meane nor dry with moist whereupon doth follow that the qualities not contrarie being ioyned two and two together doe declare vnto vs fower well ordered combinations or couplings which do argue vnto vs the fower elements
but hearken what the aduers part answereth such coniunctions and copulations doe onely shew themselues in mixtures and compound bodies for some things being hot in the first degree are also moist and some being cold are drie others are hot and drie others cold and moist and so consquently of the rest
but for the elements because that heat and great drines had reduced all things to an ende in steed

of ministring a beginning vnto them nature or rather the author of nature

hath ordayned a celestiall heat well tempered by which all things should be engendred and by it and by putrefaction and motion the creature called fire is incessantly produced
whereupon ensueth that though there be a fire yet neuerthelesse it is no element and therefore they conclude that there are but three elements
the earth most thicke and heauie seated below the aire most thin and light placed aboue and the water meane betwixt these qualities situate between both
they also affirme that vnto these elements it is common to haue no naturall heat because there is no heat but from the heauens and consequently from the soule and from brightnes that the earth because it is exceeding thicke and solide and the aire because it is beyond measure thinne seeme to be least cold but the water which is of meane substance betweene both seemeth to be most cold
that the earth because of some certaine thinnesse thereof admitteth heat and therefore is esteemed lesse cold then stones
and the aire because of the temperate cleernes and for that by the thinnesse thereof it is easily chaunged is esteemed not onely not to be cold but to be hot though in truth all the eleme~ts are cold by their own nature
which coldnes is nothing else but priuatio of heat which heat doth wholly rest in the stars which is a proper celestiall qualitie moouing the bodie which aided by motion produceth fire
but say they many may bee deceiued by reason of the violent heat which sometimes maketh impression in the elements
for by the action of the starres some parts of the elements are mixed and participate with the nature of the celestiall bodies as pepper becommeth hot and yet such mingling cannot be said to be an element but a thing composed partly of elements
and for the fire which lighteth by the striking and beating of stones that it is likewise an heat of the stars in a bodie rarified by the celestiall power
by these reasons then they conclude that two qualities do onely appeere vnto vs the heat of heauen and the proper moisture of the elements and as for drie and cold that they be the priuations of those qualities and that therfore a thing verie hot or verie cold cannot properly be called an element

but that that may be said to be an element which hath no need of nourishment which of it selfe is not corrupt neither wandreth here and there but retayneth a certaine place in great quantitie according to nature and is prepared for

generation
all which things not agreeing with the fire because it is alwaies mooued neither can subsist without nouriture and burneth the aire which is next it whereby being inflamed it is called a flame for flame is nothing else but the aire inflamed it followeth that it cannot be called an element but rather an accidentall and great heat
behold then how philosophers do diuersly dispute vpon this matter but our intention is not to giue sentence therein especially against the ancient and generally confirmed opinion which admitteth fower elements
wherefore as leaning thereunto tel vs achitob how they may be considered by the perfect compositions which are in the world

of the perfect compositions which are in the nature of all things by which the fower elements may be considered
chap

achitob

according as we are taught by those who haue first diligently sought out the secrets of nature we shal consider an elementarie fire and the element thereof approching the heauenly spheres by reason of the naturall agreement which they haue together being much greater then there is of the heauens with the aire the water and the earth
now these fower elements do demonstrate themselues by the like number of perfect compounds

which follow the nature of them to wit by stones mettals plants and animals or sensitiue creatures
for stones haue their foundation or originall vpon the earthie corner of this worlds frame because that agreeing with the nature of earth they descend alwaies towards the center except they be such as are and burned as are the which are made spungie in caues full of aire
but when they are turned into dust then resuming their proper nature of stones they descend
chrystall and the beryll are also numbred among stones because that though they may be engendred of water they are neuerthelesse so congealed and in manner frozen that being made earthie they descend downewards which is not the manner of frost and snow
so is it with those stones that are bredde in the bladder though they be produced of a waterie humour
and all

these kindes of stones become so close and solide in their nature with such fastnes and binding that they cannot be molten like mettals although the saide mettals descend downewardes like stones

and therefore also vpon the second watrie angle of the elementarie world mettals are builded which though they be said to be composed of all the elements yet bicause they are principally made of water they retaine the nature thereof and will melt as abubacher doth excellently discourse speaking thus we see in mines that by reason of the continuall heate of some mountaines the thickest of the water steweth and boileth so that in tract of time it becommeth quicksiluer
and of the fat of the earth so stewed and boiled togither with heate is brimstone ingendred and through continuall heate also are mettals procreated
for gold that hath no default is ingendred of quicksiluer and of brimstone that is pure tough cleere and red
siluer of the same liquid siluer and of close pure cleere and white sulphur wherein colour wanteth and something of the closenes surenes and consequently of waight
tinne that is more vnperfect is ingendred of the same causes and parts vnperfect bicause they are lesse concocted and attenuated
lead of the same and full of filth depriued of purenes and surenes and of grosse sulphur or brimstone somewhat red whereto wanteth fastnes clearnes and waight which makes this mettall vnperfect and impure
and iron is procreated of the same quicksiluer impure tough part earthie and burnt white and not cleere which maketh this mettall base and foule failing in purenes and in waight
all which mettals being made of quicksiluer which is waterie doe for this cause retaine the nature of the water
to this author accordeth auicen in his phisickes and in the epistle to hazem the philosopher
but gilgil the spanyard supposed that mettals had been engendred of cinders bicause they sinke in water and melt like the glasse which is drawne from and beaten stone
but this concludeth not for mettall sinketh and descendeth by reason of that terrestriall part which it hath incorporated with the liquid part and bicause that the pores which retaine the aire are closed and shut vp
and for glasse it is not extracted out of the earthie matter but out of the radicall moisture which is within the cinders and stones
for in euery compound are the fower elements though the nature of one hath more domination therein
for this cause likewise plants are

founded vpon the third angle of the world called airie

for they doe not growe nor fructifie but in open day and doe properly retaine the nature of the aire which they alwaies require as being fittest and aptest for them
yea the wood it selfe would presently corrupt and rot being depriued of the aire if the watrie humor doe not succour it which participateth with the aire
finally vpon the fourth angle of this edifice to wit

vpon the fire is the liuing sensitiue creature built whose life as many learned doe teach is by meanes of fire and obtained from the empyreall heauen and from the spirit of life which is a quickning fire and distributeth life to all the mundane wheeles as we may learne by the oracles of ezechiel saying

and the spirit of life was in the wheeles
behold then how vpon the fower bases of the elements are planted fower sorts of perfect compounds to wit stones mettals plants and liuing creatures

true it is that vnder euery vniuersall kinde of these there are diuers particular species distinct the one from the other for although stones may be properly earthie yet are they sometimes nominated of some other element which most preuaileth in their composition
for doubtlesse all the elements doe meete togither in the procreation of them but chiefly earth and water
whereupon obscure and stones are called and cleere transparent stones waterie

and some also are melted by a great fire to be turned into glasse
some also with raine falling drop by drop are engendred in the shels of oisters as those pearles which are found in the indian and britaine seas
the chrystal and beryll are made of water frozen voide of pores or subtile passages so that they can neither receiue heate nor be melted
it appeereth also that there is fire in the composition of stones which likewise is forced out of the flint being stroken with a gad of steele
to which purpose hermes amongst his secrets teacheth that a stone doth sometimes spring out of the fire mounting from earth to heauen and then againe returning to the earth that nourished it
for mettals likewise

though they be waterie some of them doe neuertheles retaine the nature of fire as gold and iron one of which imitateth the fire of the sunne and the other the fire of mars
but tinne and copper are airie this receiuing influence from venus that from iupiter
siluer agreeth with the moone lead with saturne quicksiluer with mercurie and yet all of them are endued with a waterie nature wil melt

and doe differ in waight
for as one water doth differ in waight from another so doth mettall from mettall not onely in speciall but also in vndiuisible proportion
for common gold differeth in waight from that which the latines call obrysum or else ofiryzum of the hebrue word ofir which we call fine golde and which hath been oftentimes purged and refined in the fire and wasteth not therein
the gold of tharsis also doth differ from the gold of india and hungarie and so of others
so likewise doe waters differ in goodnes and in waight according to the region and place wherein they are and by how much they are neerer to the fountaine by so much are they better and lighter
and by their waight as vitruuius will haue it one may knowe the goodnes of the aire according to which he willeth men to choose out places to build houses in
concerning plants although they may be by nature airie

yet there are some whose rootes iuice leaues and blossomes are said to be hot in the first second third or fourth degree and others are cold and drie some also are moist which diuersitie happeneth according as the plant obtaineth more or lesse of the nature of one of the elements

the like is of liuing creatures
for though they may properly be said to be of the nature of fire yet are there some which being more earthie delight in the earth as mowles woormes and commonly all creeping things
likewise all fishes are nourished by the water the chameleon by the aire the salamander by fire as some affirme bicause that he long time indureth fire through his excessiue coldnes
there are some also which burne with great heate as doues and lions some are cooled with moisture as the lambe and some are dry as hares and deere
but neuerthelesse in regarde of their life they are all especially of the nature of fire distinguished by degrees wherefore diuers names haue beene assigned to them being borrowed from the elements or from their qualities

and besides all this which we haue heere discoursed concerning the elements which may bee found in the perfectly compounded substances of this elementarie world many learned men affirme that they are also resident in the celestiall and supercelestiall world
but that as they are heere thicke and grosse so by a contrary reason they are pure and cleane in heauen and in it liuing and euery where well doing
they say then that these celestiall elements are as the woorthiest excellent portion of those which subsist vnder the in the second degree

and which remaine also in the bowels of the earth as the most base and grosse lees of the elements
and that in heauen they are certaine vertues or powers and in nature the seedes of things and in the world below grosse formes
for as they argue if there were no elementarie powers in heauen how then by the celestiall influences should these elements heere below be engendred and transformed in such sort as that which now is aire may be conuerted into raine the water exhaled into aire the earth turned into wood which nourisheth the fire and from the wood riseth aire and ashes fal which is earth for these causes also it is very likely that the astronomers distinguish the signes of the zodiack and the planets by the elements attributing three signes to euery of them as we haue already declared
but we shal finde enough to content vs concerning this matter when we discourse particularly as touching the firme concord which remaineth betwixt the terrestriall elements and the planets
which amana let be the subiect of your morrow speech

the end of the fift day

the sixt daies worke
of the agreement betwixt the elements and the planets
chap

aser

as the celestiall spheres doe follow that vniuersall common course which the first heauen that containeth and encloseth them all doth begin beside the motions that are proper peculiar to each of the as we haue alreadie heeretofore declared so must we in like sort note that the elements do follow the heauens obserue an order after them euery one in his degree hauing their motions also agreeable to their nature
and that likewise there is betwixt

them and the celestiall bodies a certaine accord and answerablenes of powers and qualities aptly proportioned by degrees euen as is found in all creatures compounded of them
we will then first entreat of this agreement betwixt the elements and the heauens

beginning with the earth which is correspondent to the moone in diuers respects
for as the earth draweth the water to it and soketh it vp in such sort that it is numbred by the sages amongst those things which are neuer satisfied to wit with water so doth the moone with a perpetuall attraction draw the water making it sometimes to rise to wit when from the orientall horizon she co~meth to the midst of heauen from whence descending to the occidentall horizon she carieth it away with her with such violence that it seemeth to flie from vs againe when the moone runneth in the point opposite to the midde heauen she draweth the water away with her then returning againe to the easterne horizon she causeth it to follow after her in like sort
when she encreaseth also she draweth vp the humors in trees and mens bodies when she waineth she chaseth them downe
againe the earth and moone do agree in the first qualities of cold and drie wherewith the earth is actually and the moone operatiuely replenished which also according to her nature being somewhat terrestriall doth suppe vp the celestiall waters and all the influences of the bodies aboue her which as neerest to vs she doth communicate with vs
for she receiueth from the other planets and principally from the sunne that which she distributeth heere below
and therefore plato in his banquet saith

that the moone participateth with the sunne and with the earth
moreouer the moone is singular in varietie whence it commeth to passe that one while she is crooked with hornes another time diuided into equall proportions or halues then being full round she is here and there bespotted somtimes she seemeth vnmeasurably great in hir round fulnesse presently after she appeereth very small now she sheweth very faire towards the north afterwards againe she is couched in the south so within a few daies she submitteth hir selfe to coniunction and by and by is she full and big presently after she is deliuered of the fruit which she had conceiued
now in this great changeablenes the moone doth shew vs that the earth is like vnto hir
for now being disrobed of hir ornaments she appeereth blacke afterwards being painted and adorned with herbes and flowers

she seemeth very faire
one part thereof is stonie another part is marish
in one place it is leane in another place fat here abased in vallies there lift vp in mountaines here fertile yonder barren
one part is checkered with diuers spots this red that blacke one white another browne
one portion is close and clammie another thinne and sandie
moreouer the earth is sometimes void and emptie and then she receiueth the coniunction of the planets whereby in short space being filled she bringeth foorth fruit
so then the moone amongst the stars and the earth amongst the elements doe agree in many particulars

now as touching the water

it seemeth to be answerable to mercurie and to saturne also
for the order of the planets and the correspondencie which they haue to things here belowe did require that next after the earthly moone waterie mercurie should be situate whome poets haue named the arbiter or vmpier of the waters then followeth next airie venus and after hir the sunne which is of the nature of fire
then againe mars participating of the same force hath his seate next aboue the sunne airian iupiter aboue mars waterish saturne ouer iupiter and the heauen aboue saturne as answering to the earth then higher againe is the first mooueable of the nature of fire
it is certaine that the nature of mercurie is by so much more hard to be deciphered by how much his starre is more hidden and harde to be seene and that very seldome too
and therefore doe astronomers affirme that his influent power is secrete by reason that hee easily accepting the nature of the planet wherewith hee is conioyned or of the signe wherein hee is resident seemeth to operate not according to his owne proper nature but as the executor of the influence of another
whereupon he is by them nominated hermes to signifie that he is as it were interpretor of the other stars intendements
for by the testimonie of ptolemie he drieth vp being with the sunne he cooleth with the moone hee fauoureth the vnderstanding with saturne he bestoweth aduise policie in warlike affaires where stoutnes is required with mars and conioyned to venus he engendreth the

anerogyne or hermaphrodite which must be vnderstood concerning him who exerciseth subtiltie of wit which he receiueth from mercurie in the second venus which is disordinate
for such a man is effeminate retayning the propertie of both sexes
so that mercurie agreeing with the reasonable

discourse and fauouring the same as he is turned towards the superiour stars or else towards the inferiour he likewise produceth diuers effects in so much that his propertie cannot easily be comprehended
and yet may he verie aptly be said to be of the nature of water as many philosophers are of opinion considering that the order of the planets requireth to obserue the harmonie and league of things heere below with those aboue that he should be watrie
moreouer as water doth in washing take away the spot that couereth in such sort that the naked bare forme doth appeere so mercurie contributing fauour to the promptnes and subtiltie of mens wits is to them as an interpreter taking away the vaile from strange languages obscurenes from riddles and parables and difficultie from euerie profound and mysticall speech and opening that which is shut vp in the secret cabinets of god and nature presenteth the naked truth to be contemplated
neither must we thinke that the starre of mercurie performeth this but so far as it may operate in bodies by disposing or else as an instrument of the diuine omnipotency as we haue heretofore declared

let vs now speake of the aire
it seemeth to be answerable in nature to venus which is hot and moist and by the foresaid order of the planets succession in course that it must be referred to iupiter
for this cause the astronomers haue dedicated to venus the airie liuing creatures
for euen as the aire winde coupleth and conioyneth things seuered so doth the venerian power whereupon we will note that the academicks taught how that there were two venuses the one etherian and the other aërian the highest cleanest chasteth and most temperate according with iupiter and conioyning the superiour diuine and spirituall things the lowest most disordinate slipperie variable and lasciuious which conioyneth in lust the creatures here below
of this venus so many ribauldries are sung by wanton poets because she is cause of all euill euen as the other is cause of all good
to which speech the saying of saint augustine hath relation namely that two loues haue made two cities
for the well disposed and good loue of god and the loue of one neighbour to the despising of ones selfe hath edified the citie of god
but the peruerse loue of ones selfe to the forgetting of god hath reared vp the citie of the diuell
moreouer the grammarians deliuer this reason why the power of this starre is called venus because it

doth concur in all things be they good or euill
and surely all is filled with loue and nothing is void thereof as all things are full of aire which filleth the naturall appetite that abhorreth emptines
by loue saith boëtius are the heauens conioyned and the elements agree with bodies compounde
through it creatures dwell together the citie is preserued and the common wealth increased
through loue god made the world and doth gouerne it and the summe of all that which he requireth of vs is loue
saint denis in his hierarchie speaketh thus
the loue of god hath not permitted that the king of all things should remaine in himselfe without fruit
and as through loue he is spread abroad in all things without himselfe so hee delighteth to attract all things to himselfe and principally man in whom all is enclosed
and therefore when he shall be vnited with god euen so shall all other things be
whether then that we speake of diuine or angelicall or spirituall or quickning or naturall loue we meane a power engraffed and conioyning which mooueth the superiour things to prouidence and care for the good of the inferiour disposeth equall things in a sociable communion and in fine admonisheth inferiour things that they turne themselues to those that are better and superiour
thus speaketh this great doctor and philosopher
but let vs pursue the subiect of our discourse
we haue declared that the academicks haue taught a double venus
the like may be said of the aire for we consider it in two parts the one thicke and foggie which is next the earth and the other pure and aetherian next vnto the stars which being heated by force of the winde which mixeth it selfe in all things seemeth to be verie fit for the propagation and maintenance of nature for which reason also the winde and the aire are called by one name of the hebrewes who call all things according to their properties

finally the elementarie fire is answerable to the sunne

and to mars who are both of the nature of fire
for as the sunne is the true and celestiall fire boyling all that which appertaineth to the viands of this great animall the world so this elementarie fire causing all things to boyle by his great heat doth perfect the nourishment of creatures liuing in the earth
both the one and other fire heateth but this driuing the humours inward and the other drawing them out
this imparteth his commoditie to that onely which is neere it but the superiour bestoweth his

vertue vpon the farthest remote bodies in such sort that the force of his beames pierceth euen to the bowels of the earth where it boyleth and maketh mettals which afterward the elementarie fire purgeth
moreouer as apollo so named as of undefined span alphabet which is a priuatiue letter in composition and of undefined span alphabet which signifieth multitude as being he who alone contayneth the power of the heauens and of the starres or else because that his vertue and power consisteth of many fires by which he giueth light to all the stars whose naturall vigour produceth not their effects till such time as they bee filled with the powerfull seed of this faire phebus who is so called of his beauty amiablenes which shineth in him as he is also named sol as or else by a name amongst the hebrewes which one may interpret that which properly doth subsist because that the light and benefit thereof is proper and peculiar vnto him
as this faire planet say was acknowledged by the ancient poets and philosophers for the inuentor of phisicke because of the quickning heat well disposing power thereof so the fire heere beneath doth aptly patterne him by reason that heating the cold frozen creatures it doth in a manner restore their life vnto them
so it is heate that giueth life and fruitfulnes
for egges are not conuerted into chickens nor the silkeworme into a butterflie neither do plants grow nor yet are liuing creatures nourished and warmed except either by the superior or by the quickning or by the elementarie heat which by a certaine sympathie do seeme to bee of one kinde as it were through a correspondencie
yea the fire is so fruitefull that it engendreth it selfe and giueth power to other naturall things to engender not by the heate thereof onely but by the force of the light which it receiueth from him who hath said

am the light of the world
wherefore moses being desirous to make manifest that all things had beene produced by the benefite of the light after that the matter which he calleth earth turned out of darknes was made he saith that presently the light was created as that by meanes of which life and forme must be giuen to all things and aptnes to be seene
which vitall vigor did no doubt consist in the diuine fire which is called the spirit of life the which resting vpon the face of the waters infused into all things the life and the formes by which euery thing might be discerned from other
but let vs now returne to our elementarie world and particularly behold the nature of

the fower elements and of things engendred in them and by them
then haue we enough to stand vpon for the common opinion of those who establish this number of fower in that which hath beene already declared and now also in this discourse
let vs first then amana heare you discourse of the fire and of the aire and of their maruailous effects

of the fire and of the aire and of the things engendred in them and of their motions and of the windes
chap

amana

many philosophers doe diuide all that which subsisteth vnder the concaue of the moone into three parts one of which they call the highest the other the middle and the third the lowest part
the highest they place aboue the middle region of the aire and make as it were the same element partaker with the most pure fire which the ancients nominated aether because that there the elements are pure subtile thin rare and for that the aire there is very temperate and cleere agreeing with the nature of heauen as to the contrarie in the lower part which is that where we inhabite there is not any sincere element for a sensible element is not pure but all things are there compounded and mixed with the muddie and grosse part of this mundane bodie
and concerning the middle region of the aire it is that verie place where the meteors and high impressions do appeere
so then aboue the elements are pure beneath the perfect composed bodies do faile by reason of their mixture of the elementary simplicitie in the middle they compound themselues vnperfectly in such sort that one may say that they possesse the middle place betwixt the nature of the elements and of things compounded
now as we haue said before and as the common saying of people is the heauen is often taken for this supreme and middle region of the aire and for the things which are to them conioined and do depend vpon their effects

so that in this regard we may vnderstand first two of the fower elements to wit the aire and the fire then all things ingendred in them and by them as windes thunders lightnings haile

cloudes

tempests raine dewes frosts snowes and all kinds of fire and such like which arise and appeere in the aire
and therein we may also comprise all the creatures which conuerse in it as birds and all creatures that flie euen as the holy scripture teacheth vs when it maketh mention of the birds of heauen

now the element of fire is knowne to haue his place neerest to the moone being by nature hot and dry and is for this cause lightest hauing his motion quicker then all the elements bicause that lightnes and quicknes is proper to these two qualities heat and drines and therefore also the propertie thereof is to mount alwaies vpwards

vntill that it hath attained to the place destinated vnto it being most conuenient for the nature thereof and which ioineth next vnto the spheres
next the fire the aire possesseth the second place and agreeth in nature with the fire in that it is hot but is contrarie thereto in that it is also moist
and therefore the motion thereof followeth that of the fire but it is not so light and quicke by reason of the humiditie which maketh it more heauie and slow

and yet it appeereth that it is alwaies mooued bicause that in narrow places small winds doe blow without ceasing
for considering that the aire hath the motion thereof tending alwaies vpwards and that it is continually mooued vp and downe it bloweth in a great space very gently but passing through a creuisse or streight place all the violence thereof being drawne togither by reason of the narrownes of the place driueth out flieth vehemently vpon vs after the maner of the waters of great flouds which when it seemeth that they can scarce flowe being vrged through a narrow place or through sluces are constrained to runne out by much force with noise and roring
moreouer according as the aire is mooued either by the heate of the sunne or by the vapors and exhalations which this heat causeth to rise out of the waters and out of the earth or by the waues of the sea or by the caues of the earth and such like causes

we perceiue the aire diuersly agitated
for we must note that the windes are nothing else but the aire which is mooued and driuen more violently then ordinarie and which hath his motion more sodaine more violent and strong being driuen and pressed forwards according as the causes are more great or small and according to the places from whence they proceed
and this is the reason why the aire is sometimes so peaceable that one cannot feele so much as one onely small puffe of

winde but it is as calme as the sea when it is not tossed with any winde or tempest
as is euident by those vanes and weathercocks which are set in the tops of turrets and houses for when the winde bloweth not their plates are nothing mooued and yet the aire doth neuer faile to blowe by reason of the perpetuall motion thereof but insomuch as it is not hoised vp and downe it passeth and flieth lightly away without any noise or bruite towards that part whereto we see the point of the vane enclined

sometimes also one may feele some small pleasant and gentle winde to blowe without any violence which is very delectable recreatiue and profitable not onely in regard of men and other liuing things but in respect also of all the fruits of the earth
at another time likewise the violence of the windes is so great that it raiseth vp stormes and tempestes which driue the aire with such fury and roughnes that it seemeth they would ouerthrow and confound heauen and earth togither beating downe and carying away all that is before them like a great deluge and which beareth away with it all that it meets with
but though one may suppose so during such tempests yet the course of the windes are not so confused but that all of them obserue their order and certaine places out of which they issue and proceed and their bounds likewise whereat they stay and wherein they are confined as the element of which they are engendred
and therefore by experience we see that they follow the course of the sunne and that they are distributed and disposed according to all the partes of the world as we vsually diuide it hauing respect to the moouing of the spheres
for as we diuide the course of the sunne and all the regions of the earth into east west north and south so must we consider the fower principall winds which proceede out of these fower places one opposite to another
besides which there are certaine others which are called collaterall windes bicause that each of the first hath them vpon the one or other side of them so that those who haue ordinarily written concerning the windes doe appoint to the number of twelue common and ordinarie windes saying also that there are others which are proper to certaine regions and countries according to the nature of their situations and places as we may hereafter finde matter ynough thereof amply to intreat

but here it will be good to touch one difficultie which may

be alledged vpon our discourse

touching that which we haue said concerning the qualities of the aire
for sith that it is hot and moist by nature and that the windes are nothing else but the same are mooued and puffed forwards what may be the cause that the windes doe not all of them retaine the nature of the aire for we knowe by experience that there are as many diuers qualities in the windes as in all the elements for some are hot and drie others hot and moist others moist and cold and some cold and drie
hereupon then we are to note that all creatures which subsist of a sensible and corporall nature are commonly diuided into two kindes which comprise them all
the one are simple and the other compound of the first sort are the elements taken euery one alone in their proper and particular nature such as we haue already declared
and all other creatures compounded of all the elements conioined togither are of the second kinde
wherefore if the elements were pure not any way mixed one with another then would each of them retaine their naturall qualities purely
but bicause they are intermingled one with another they haue their qualities likewise mingled
and therefore by how much the higher the aire mounteth by so much the more it is pure neat subtile and thin and by how much the lower it descendeth and approcheth the water and earth by so much the more it is grosse and thicke and partaketh more of the elements neere to which it remaineth
and according as it is warmed by the heate of the sunne or by any other heate or else as it is cooled by the absence and default thereof euen so doth it become either more hot or more cold
the like also may be said concerning the naturall moisture thereof
for according as it is more or lesse mixed with water or neere vnto it so doth it receiue either a more moist or a more drie qualitie
so therfore according to the places out of which the windes proceed issue and through which they passe they are hotter or colder drier or moisture pure or impure healthfull and holesome or pestilent and infectious yea euen stinking
and for the same cause also it commeth to passe that as the diuersitie of lands and countries is disposed so winds which are felt in one place warme are in another place cold and so is it of their moisture and drines
by the same reason also those that are healthfull for some are vnholesome for others and those which bring with them faire and cleere weather in one place doe in another place bring raine and tempests

for the propertie of some of them is according to the countries wherein they blowe to chase away the cloudes and to make the aire cleere and the weather faire whereas others doe assemble and heape them togither
whereupon ensueth that some bring raine with them others snowe and others againe haile and tempests according as god hath ordained the causes in nature as the sequele of our discourse shall minister occasion againe to speake of
wherefore pursuing the order of our speech we will consider those things which are conioyned to the fire and aire and doe depend vpon their effects as are thunders and lightnings
whereof aram doe you discourse

of thunder and lightning
chapter

aram

there is a certaine vniuersall loue and appetite in all creatures which inciteth them all to loue their owne kinde to desire it and to search after it
but as their natures are diuers euen so is the loue and the appetite which is in them
and therefore there are as many sortes of desires as there are diuersities of natures
and thence it is that the fire and the aire doe naturally desire the highest places and doe thither tend euermore as the water and the earth doe require the lowest and doe thereto descend incessantly neither can these elements finde any stay or rest vntill they be arriued at those places which are appointed vnto them by nature
and therefore what hinderance soeuer there may be yet euery thing doth alwaies seeke to returne to his naturall home and therein doth all possible endeuour
now here we are to consider the cause of thunders lightnings tempests earthquakes and such like motions and perturbations in the elements
for all these things happen when the creatures which by their contraries are hindered from pursuing their owne kinde do fight with those which keepe them backe as if there were open warre betwixt them
which causeth that that which by force can make way doth at last vanquish
but bicause of the resistance which there is this cannot be performed without great violence and maruellous noise from whence proceede many admirable effects and namely thunder which hath ministred occasion to many great spirits to search out

the causes somewhat neerely
but mens opinions as in a very deepe matter are diuers hereupon

for some maintaine that thunder is caused by the blowes and strokes that the fire maketh being inclosed within the cloudes which it cleaueth so making it selfe to appeere as is seene in lightnings
aristotle in his meteors writeth that thunder groweth and proceedeth of hot and drie exhalations ascending out of the earth into the supreme region of the aire being there repulsed backe by the beames of the stars into the cloudes
for these exhalations desiring to set themselues at libertie and to free themselues doe cause this noise which is often stopped by nature whilest they fight with the cloudes but when they can gaine issue then doe they make the cloude to cracke like a bladder full of winde that is broken by force
moreouer plinie imitating the opinion of the epicure teacheth

that those fires which fall from the starres as we see often in calme weather may sometimes meete with the cloudes and fall vpon them and that by the vehemencie of this blowe the aire is mooued
and that this fire plunging it selfe into the cloudes causeth a certaine thicke and hissing smoke which maketh a noise like an hot iron thrust into water from whence the whirlewindes which we see in the aire doe proceede
but when the winde or vapour inclosed in the cloudes will needes get out by force then this causeth thunder
and if there come out fire which breaketh the cloud then is it lightning
but when these inflamed vapours doe shew foorth a long traine of their fire out of the cloud then this is that which we call a flash of lightning
whereupon ensueth that these cleaue the cloudes but the fire of thunder teareth and renteth them and causeth them to cracke

but referring these arguments to philosophers we may fitly say that the true cause of thunder is the winde inclosed which seeketh to issue out

but that which is most admirable therein is the great violence of the flashes thereof the strange accidents which happen by the fire thereof
for it doth not onely pierce more then any other fire by reason of the passing swift motion thereof but it is much hotter then all other fire
for it is to be noted that there is a difference in heate and that not onely by reason of the matter one fire is hotter then another as that which is in the iron is hotter then that which is in straw and that which is in oken wood is hotter then that which is in willow but euen as in ice we find some scarcely frozen othersome hard and other

againe very hard so is there in fire that is scarce fire as when the iron beginneth to waxe somewhat red and another fire that is shining and other that shines very bright
wherefore we must note that fire exceeds in heate and in force sixe manner of waies

by nature as haue said for the most ardent burneth quickest and soonest

by the soliditie of the matter as that which is in iron
by motion for therby it is made more piercing

by greatnes either proper to it selfe or caused by continuance of time which is common to euery fire

by hindrance of respiration and by constraint togither as is manifest in lyme which is kindled with water for the heate being gotten in and hid in the fornace being of the kinde of fire is enclosed and gathered within the lyme so that it returneth into fire by the motion and mixture of the water
now the constrained motion must not onely penetrate very much but also it enkindleth heat and as haue declared it maketh one fire hotter then another
and therefore it may be no great woonder

if the lightning of thunder be of very much force and violence and that the fire thereof being very different from the nature of other fires doth effect strange things
for it is not onely more pearcing by reason of the quicke motion thereof but it is also much hotter then all other fire
whereupon it commeth that it can kill any kinde of creature by the onely touch thereof
and sometimes the purse remaining whole and sound it melteth the money that is therein which is not fabulous as many thinke nor yet on the other side very much to be admired
for that which hurteth doth corrupt either by meanes of the quantitie or for the long continuance thereof
and therefore the which is most subtile breaketh not the purse for by reason that it hath very quicke motion it staieth not on it and therefore cannot it endommage it so
moreouer as the aire doth demonstrate vnto vs that by reason of the subtilitie thereof it passeth thorough the purse without any resting vpon it and entreth thereinto filling it when it is emptie though it be fast shut which coulde not be if it found not passage through insensible waies and holes sith the mouth of the purse is very close shut so likewise one little sparke of far more subtile then the aire may easily enter into the purse where finding mettall it fasteneth thereon and staieth therein causing it to melt by the extreme violence and sudden force thereof

so then the solid bodies as iron siluer and gold are by so much the sooner spoiled and molten by the lightning by how much they doe more withstand and make resistance against it
but in those bodies which be rare full of holes soft and weake the thunder passeth quicke ouer them without hurting them as is seene in the garments that men weare and in very drie wood
for other wood burneth by reason that the moisture which remaineth therein doth resist and kindle
whereupon it followeth if we beleeue plutarch that such as sleepe are neuer stroken with thunder bicause that the sleeping man is loose and becommeth soft and vnequall and in manner dissolued with his pores open as if his spirit failed and left him so that the lightning findeth no such resistance in him as it would doe if he were awake
whereunto this may be also added that he which sleepeth hauing no feare astonishment nor dread in him is by this meanes oftentimes defended from thunder
for it is certaine that many haue died with feare onely and apprehension which they haue taken thereof without suffering any violence
wherefore considering that the sense of hearing is of all other senses the most subiect to suffer violent passions and that feares and dread which proceede of noise doe bring the greatest trouble to the soule thereupon he which waketh and apprehendeth very much becommeth bound and thicke in his bodie so that the lightning falling vpon him giueth a greater blowe and a ruder stroke in so much as it findeth greater resistance

it is woonderfull to consider the strange cases that many authors report to haue happened through thunder
but amongst all that is very admirable which iulius obsequius reciteth of the daughter of pompeius lionis a knight of rome
for she returning from certaine plaies and turnayments celebrated at rome was suddenly stroken from hir palfrey with a thu~derclap without apparance of any wound or fracture of member
but when hir father caused hir to be stript to burie and interre hir they perceiued hir toong to come foorth at the bottome of hir wombe whereby they knewe that the thunder and fire had stroken hir directly through the mouth and so had issued out at the lower passage a thing exceeding fearefull and woorthie of great maruell
that which du bartas the honour of the poets of our age hath written in his no lesse learned then christian weeke to haue beene seene of the effects of thunder by

a woman though it may rather minister cause of laughter then of sorrow yet is it very maruellous
for he recounteth that the flame sindged away all the haire about this womans secrets at one instant without doing her any harme
but omitting these discourses will note certaine particularities which some philosophers affirme touching thunder
they say then

that it neuer or very seldome toucheth pillars nor the keeles of ships by reason of the depth of the one and roundnes of the other
so that the blowe thereof running along the pillars doth very seldome strike them as also not being able to descend aboue fiue cubits vnder ground and the bottoms of ships being very lowe it scarcely euer falleth there
and therefore it is a sure remedie against lightning to hide ones selfe in deepe caues
it is also to be noted that although the brightnes of the lightning be seene before the noise of thunder be heard yet proceede they not one before another but are both togither
and the reason hereof is easie to vnderstand

for bicause that sight is quicker and sharper then hearing the eie doth sooner behold the brightnes of the lightning then the eare doth heare the sound of the thunder as we see plainly when a man cuts downe a tree or beateth vpon any thing that resoundeth especially if we be farre off
for we shall see him strike the stroke sooner then we can heare it as likewise we prooue in ordinance and in all guns and peeces whose fire wee shall see before wee heare the noise of their shoot notwithsta~ding that they are both performed togither
but wee haue dwelt long ynough on this matter concerning that which philosophers doe teach
we must now consider what the true meteors of christians are as we haue already discoursed of their astronomie and astrologie wherein we shall learne the supernaturall causes of those thunders and lightnings which god sendeth when and how he pleaseth as you achitob can relate vnto vs

of the true meteors of christians and of the supernaturall causes of thunder and lightning
chap

achitob

the philosophers call meteors by a greeke name that part of natural philosophie which entreateth of the aire and of the things

engendred therein and appertayning thereto as namely the cloudes raine snow thunders tempests lightnings and such like because that they are ouer and aboue vs
for the signification of the greeke word meteoron importeth so much
but the principall profit that like christians we must desire purchase from this part of philosophie is that we learne by the contemplation and consideration of the works of god of which we now intreat what is his power wisedome bountie and benignitie towards vs and how it manifesteth it selfe before our eies not onely in the highest heauens wherein the sunne moone and starres are contayned as we haue heretofore shewed but also in the aire and in all the elements placed vnder the spheres
for by this knowledge we may reape verie great fruits

first in that we are assured that all these things are in the power of our father who is the creator of them that they are all created for our good like the rest of his works and not for our ruine and perdition
then we learne by so many rare workes and maruellous effects to feare and loue the author of them onely and nothing else except in him and for the loue of him acknowledging and firmely beleeuing that he alone is the author and gouernour of all nature
for we behold how terrible and fearfull hee sheweth himselfe by thunders and lightnings
and againe how louing gratious and benigne he declareth himselfe to be by raine dewes and such like blessings by which he giueth nourishment to men and to all other creatures
for these causes also the kingly prophet calleth thunders

lightnings te~pests great inundations of waters the voice of the lord and in another place he speaketh of the lord as of a magnificent and maiestical prince speaking great like the sound of thunder and casting fire out at his mouth with great flouds and deluges of water saying againe in another place
that the almightie maketh great cloudes his chariot and that he walketh vpon the wings of the winde

that he maketh the spirits his messengers and a flaming fire his ministers
by which fire no doubt

but the prophet meaneth the lightning which the lord sendeth when and where it pleaseth him to cause men to leaue him

and to punish them like their iust iudge as he declared in effect when he rained downe fire and brimstone vpon them of sodome and gomorrha and the other cities round about them which are proposed to vs in the scriptures for examples of the iudgements of god as that of the floud

for this cause also dauid addressing his speech to the great and mightie to the proude and loftie which haue god in contempt saith giue vnto the lord yee sonnes of the mightie

giue vnto the lord glorie and strength giue vnto the lord glorie due vnto his name worship the lord in his glorious sanctuarie consequently deducing the wonders that god doth by the voice of his thunder how that it sparkleth with flames of fire by reason of the lightnings which proceed out of the clouds when they open and rent themselues with so great noise whereat the deserts and mountaines tremble the hinds calue and bring foorth before their time for feare and dread and the forests are discouered their trees being ouerturned and broken as they are very oftentimes with tempests and whirlewinds as if the author of all nature did blow through them
for it is he as is written in ecclesiasticus that sendeth out the lightnings as he listeth

who hauing opened his treasures the cloudes flie out like birdes at sight of whom the mountaines leape and the southwinde bloweth according to his will and the voice of his thunder maketh the earth to suffer which is as much to say as that it is mooued and trembleth in regard of men
whereby we may learne what shall become of them all if they enterprise to stand vp against god
for surely their force cannot but be much lesse then that of the high mountaines and great trees which might seeme to the ignorant able to oppose themselues against thunders whirlewinds and tempests

for this cause also elihu saith in the booke of iob

at this also mine hart is astonied and is mooued out of his place
heare the sound of his voice and the noise that goeth out of his mouth
he directeth it vnder the whole heauen and his light vnto the ends of the world
now he meaneth by this light the lightnings which our god causeth to appeere in one moment and instant from the east to the west from the one side of the world to the other as the scripture declareth otherwhere and it is easie to note by reason that he proceedeth saying

after it a noise soundeth he thundreth with the voice of his maiestie and he will not stay them when his voice is heard

god thundreth maruellously with his voice he worketh great things which we know not
and who pray you would not woonder to see the fire and water which are of contrarie natures mingled one with another and lodged both in one lodging and proceeding out of one

place together for where remayneth this fire which sheweth it selfe in lightning commeth it not out of the cloudes wherein it is enclosed before they be opened and burst by the thunder and of what substance is the cloude is it not of water massed vp together which couereth and keepeth in the fire as in an harth for doe not we oftentimes behold while it raineth and great flouds and streames of water do fall so that it seemeth that all the cloudes and the whole aire should melt and resolue into water that great lightnings of fire flash appeere and runne euerie where about like burning darts and arrowes for while the hot exhalations are inclosed in the cloude

and retayned therein peforce with the violence and contention which is betwixt these contraries the noise of thunder is made
and when the matter is so abundant in the cloude that it maketh it to breake and open and that it may reach to the earth then is there not onely thunder and great lightning but also thunderbolts and which are of diuers verie maruellous and fearfull kinds
for some bring with them that fire which is not easie to be quenched as we haue alreadie declared others are without fire and pierce through the most solide and firme bodies so that there is no force which can resist them
and sometimes also it happeneth that those which are stroken therewith be they men or beasts remaine all consumed within as if their flesh sinewes and bones were altogither molten within their skin it remayning sound whole as if they had no harme so that it is verie hard to finde in what part the bodie was striken

we are not then to hold in small accompt that the holy scripture proposeth god vnto vs so often thundring and lightning when it would declare vnto vs his maiesty and how terrible he is and to bee feared
for it is certaine that he hath many weapons and of diuers sorts very strong and ineuitable when he will punish men and that his onely will is sufficient to serue him when and how he pleaseth

and therefore also wee must acknowledge besides these naturall causes which make and engender thunder the prime eternall and supernaturall cause of all things from which proceede so many signes of the meruailous iudgements of god through the ministerie of his creatures oftentimes contrary to that which seemeth to bee ordained by the lawes of nature
for when he will thunder vpon his enemies he breaketh and suddainely consumeth them in strange manner
and therefore it

is written

that the lord shall destroy those who rise vp against him and that he shall thunder vpon them from heauen
and in the battaile which the children of israel had against the philistims it is said that after the praier of samuell the lord in that day thundred a great thunder vpon his enemies and scattered them and slew them before the host of israel
when moses also stretched out his rod towards heauen it is said

that the lord caused thunder and haile and that the fire walked vpon the ground and that haile and tempests stroke many men and beasts in egypt

moreouer we doubt not but that euill spirits do sometimes raise vp tempests thunder and lightning because that the principall power of them is in the aire
and therefore when it pleaseth god to slack their bridle they raise vp terrible and woondrous stormes
which is apparently demonstrated vnto vs in iob

whose seruants and cattell sathan burned with the fire which he caused to fall from heauen and by a great winde that he raised he ouerturned the house vpon his children
and therefore also the scripture calleth the diuell prince of this world

and of darknes and of the power of the aire teaching vs also that wee must fight against the euill spirits which are in the celestiall places
it is no meruaile then if euill spirits ioyne themselues with tempests to hurt men to their vttermost abilitie
for which cause dauid calleth the inflaming of the wrath of god choler

indignation and anguish the exploit of euill angels
wherefore it is certaine that when god hath a meaning not onely to punish the wicked but also to chastice his owne or to try their faith constancie patience he giueth power to diuels to this effect yet such as that he alwaies limiteth the so that they can do nothing but so far as is permitted them
now he permitteth them so far as he knoweth to bee expedient for his glory and for the health of his or so much as the sins and infidelity of men deserue that he may chastice and punish them and bring vengeance vpon them for their iniquities
and therefore mee seemeth that to such meteors the epicures and atheists should bee sent who mocke at the prouidence of god as likewise the tyrants of this world

who treade all iustice vnderfoot to make them thinke a little whether there be a god in heauen and whether he bee without power and without medling in the gouernment of the world
for cannot beleeue that there is any one of them but would be waked

out of his sleep how profound soeuer it were when he should heare god shoote out of the highest heauens and should vnderstand the noise of his cannons and should behold the blowes that he striketh
for he is in a place so high that all the wicked together cannot make batterie against him nor yet auoid his ineuitable strokes who can slay them with the feare onely which they shall haue of his noise without touching them
but though they cannot assure themselues in their harts against this soueraigne maiestie and power of the eternall yet are they so peruerse and wicked that rather then they will render to him the honor and glorie which is due they forge vnto themselues a nature to which they attribute his workes or else beleeue that they happen by chance as things comming by haphazard without any diuine prouidence
but leauing such manner of people we will pursue our discourse concerning things engendred in the higher elements entreating of snowes mists frosts and haile the discourse whereof aser referre to you

of snowes mists frosts ice and haile
chap

aser

sith that god is not subiect to the nature which hee hath created but doth euer rest the lord and master thereof who can performe both without it and with it all that he pleaseth it therefore followeth that we must refer not to the creatures or to nature the workes which he hath done in them by them but to him alone must attribute to him the totall glorie thereof to depend wholy vpon him and vpon his prouidence
now if we shall consider all creatures in their originall and end ordained by god we shall finde that they are all good and ordained by the creator for the benefit of the good
and yet it might seeme that he hath established some things principally to take vengeance on the wicked as by this text of scripture

where the lord saith to iob hast thou entred into the treasures of the snowe or hast thou seene the treasures of the haile which haue hid against the time of trouble against the day of warre and battell in which text is deliuered vnto vs a goodly doctrine of the forme and of the place where the snow and haile are engendred to wit in the chambers builded by god

among the waters which he gardeth as treasures and congealeth them to serue him for scourges to chastise and punish the froward

for it is he as the psalmist chaunteth who giueth snowe like wooll and scattereth the hoare frost like ashes
he casteth foorth his ice like morsels who can abide the cold thereof he sendeth his worde and melteth them he causeth his winde to blowe and the waters flowe
this is he also as saith ecclesiasticus which hasteneth the snowe by his commandement

and strengtheneth the cloudes with great force to make the hailestones cracke
the south winde bloweth according to his wil the storme of the north and the whirlewinde flying out like birds scatter the snowe and the falling downe thereof is as an heape of grashoppers or locusts that light downe in any countrie
the eie hath the whitenes thereof in admiration and the hart is astonished at the fall of it
the lord powreth out the frost vpon the earth like salt which when it is frozen sticketh on the tops of pales
the cold north winde bloweth and the water is frozen it abideth vpon the gatherings togither of the water and clotheth the water as with a brestplate
it deuoureth the mountaines and burneth the wildernes and destroieth that that is greene like fire
the present remedie against all this is a cloude and the deaw comming before the heate appeaseth it
it is also written in the booke of iob the whirlewinde commeth out of the heape of cloudes and the cold from the northwinde

at the breath of god the frost is giuen and the bredth of the waters is made narrow
and therefore the lord saith to iob out of whose wombe came the ice who hath engendred the frost of the heauen the waters are hid as with a stone and the face of the deepe is couered

which is as much to say as the waters take to them the forme of a stone when they are conuerted into haile and ice and that the sea is frozen ouer for when the water is frozen it seemeth to be hid and lost and to be no more water

surely in these discourses we haue much to consider concerning the woonders of god
for is it not an admirable thing that the water which is so soft and runs so swiftly should become as hard as stones and that it can fall from heauen in such forme yea sometimes so great that it doth not onely spoile the fruits of the earth but doth also breake the branches of trees and kil men and beasts
hereof that is a certaine testimonie which we read concerning the haile which god sent vpon the egyptians

by the

ministerie of moses

and vpon the amorites in the time of ioshuah in the warre of the gibeonites
indeede this was done contrarie to the common course of nature in respect of the egyptians especially
for their land is not moistned nor watred with raine from heauen but onely by the riuer nilus
and therefore the power of god was euidently shewed

when he caused so great haile to fall downe vpon the enimies of his people that no man could iudge it to be naturall
for haile is made of raine frozen in the aire and is different from snow and mists in that the haile is engendred of raine more hard frozen snowe of moisture more softly thickned and mists and fogs of cold deawes
so that when the congealed water is frozen by a strong colde it becommeth haile if by a small cold it engendreth small drisling haile such as falles commonly in the spring time as in march and aprill
but this me thinketh is worthie of greatest wonder that the water in sommer time should be congealed into haile and that during the great heate of the sunne the greatest congelation should be made from whence commeth this word amongst the latines grando which is as much to say as a great drop of water which is not seene in winter when euery thing through the exceeding colde freezeth here on earth or if so be this happen in such a time it is spoken of as a new and strange thing that comes not ordinarily in this season like the snowe and mists which are proper to winter and cold weather
for though the naturalists trauell much to shew that all things are produced by inferior and naturall causes yet must we principally acknowledge a diuine puissance aboue all who hath causes hidden in his incomprehensible treasures from men by which the haile thunder lightning tempestes and stormes are disposed and dispersed according to his good pleasure

for as god made knowne to his people by the manna which he sent them in the wildernes wherewith he nourished them for the space of fortie yeeres in a barren and vnhabitable place that he could euermore very easily finde meanes ynough both ordinarie and extraordinarie to nourish and maintaine them so hath he made manifest by the rods and scourges wherewith he hath beaten the egyptians that he can euermore very easily inuent meanes ynow to punish his enimies so often and whensoeuer he pleaseth yea euen then when there shall be no appeerance thereof amongst men

now as god when he pleaseth conuerteth the water into

stones

and so hardneth it that by great cold he doth as it were paue not onely riuers ponds and lakes but also great seas which he maketh so firme that one may passe ouer them yea and draw ouer great and heauy chariots as it were ouer bridges and firme land so when it pleaseth him he causeth all this water so hardened to returne into the proper kinde thereof as if it had neuer beene frozen
and as there be windes to congeale it so there are windes to dissolue and thaw it
for wee must note that yee doth not dissolue and thaw by the heate of the sunne onely but also by the power of the windes ordained hereto yea and much sooner so then otherwise
concerning all which things and the causes of them which god hath created and established in nature wee shall heere make a briefe and generall discourse
for if we should speake as the philosophers haue written and disputed we should haue matter enough to compose a great volume
but we will content our selues simply to propound heere the admirable works of god by which euery one may learne to feare and honor him which is the onely

and the greatest profit that wee must make of meteors whereof our speech hath hitherto beene and which do yet rest for vs to consider of
for our intent is to manifest in them not onely the workes of the creation which are therein proposed but those also of the diuine prouidence which are in the same after diuers sorts declared and not to do as many who are esteemed very learned in naturall philosophie and in all other letters and humane sciences who are so badly aduanced in the knowledge of god by them that in stead of acknowledging and gloryfying him as it behooueth them they rather become atheists and epicures contemners and mockers of his maiestie and of all religion
but the iudgements of god shall therefore light very greeuous vpon them because they shall be by so much the more inexcusable
for they are of the number of those of whom saint paul saith that by their infidelity iniustice

they detaine the truth in iniustice because they vniustly and wilfully suppresse the knowledge of the eternall for hauing knowne him in the works of the creation of the world

which are as a mirrour and shew of inuisible things they glorifie him not as god neither are thankfull but become vaine in their imaginations and their foolish hart is full of darknes and when they professe themselues wise they become fooles bicause it hath pleased god so to punish their proud presumption and the vanitie of their vnderstanding

wherefore likewise as the apostle saith in another place

they haue their cogitations darkened and are strangers from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them bicause of the hardnes of their harts
for by reason that they abuse the gift of knowledge which they haue in a more ample measure then others therefore doth the omnipotent by his iust iudgement make them more blinde then the simple and ignorant so that they are rather woorthie to be accounted as beasts then as men
and yet the science and knowledge which they haue of the works of god more abundant then others is not cause of their blindnes considering that it is an excellent gift from aboue profitable for all those which can and will well vse it but their malice ingratitude and peruersenes of hart and vnderstanding pulleth this euill vpon them through their owne fault and by the iust vengeance of god
so that whereas their skill should open their eies to guide them by the knowledge of the creatures to that of the creator it is rather an hinderance vnto them and depriueth them of that great and soueraigne good
but we shall haue woorthie arguments against their impietie in that which remaineth for vs to view concerning other things engendred in the highest elements amongst which many comprehende comets saying that they are of the number of sublime or high impressions which are made in the region of the fire and aire
wherefore pursuing our purpose we will heare you amana discourse vpon this subiect

of comets
chap

amana

although we haue hitherto spoken of sundrie sorts of the creatures and workes of god by which he manifesteth and declareth his power glorie maiestie and eternall prouidence and chiefly in the region of the aire neuertheles there doe yet a great number remaine which we haue nothing at all touched either particularly or in generall no not so much as cursorily
for there are so many sorts of fires of diuers formes that appeere in the skie aboue that it is impossible to distinguish them all particularly
and amongst them there are some which somtimes seeme to fall from heauen

or as if the stars did snuffe themselues as men snuffe a candle so that the most part of the rude and ignorant people suppose it is so
many others thinke that sometimes the starres sparkle

but the cause of such appeerance is for that the substance of heauen being verie cleere their beames shining towards vs are euermore broken perpendicularly
for the aire being mooued euen as we see the stones in the bottome of a riuer seeme to tremble because of the running motion of the water so do the stars seeme to sparkle and when the middle of the aire is vehemently stirred aboue then they seeme to sparkle both more and oftner
but we will leaue this talke to speake of certaine heauenly fires which we call comets and which are worthie of great consideration and of much maruell

for they appeere like bearded and hairie stars hauing their motion with the heauen as if they were verie stars and certes we might well suppose them such and placed in heauen like the rest if they should long time continue
but the opinion of many is as aristotle likewise writeth in his meteors that they are naturally made of an hot exhalation which attayneth to the supreme region of the aire where it is enflamed by the element of fire so that of such an exhalation are fires kindled in heauen of diuers sorts and fashions
neuerthelesse some learned moderne writers which haue diligently obserued the height whither these vapours may mount do thinke cleane otherwise for they affirme that comets cannot be ingendred in the region of the elements and are not afraid to giue sentence against aristotle who in truth being an ethnike and pagan hath failed in the resolution of many particular questions
for he hath strained himselfe to affirme manie generall propositions which our experience sheweth to be vtterly false as these

that no liuing thing apprehendeth by sense that which is good that a thing poized can incline neither to the one side nor to the other and that the earth is in no part higher then the waters and sundrie others
now if it hath beene permitted him to abandon the opinion of his master plato who taught the truth yea and to reprehend him it shall be also lawfull for vs and verie laudable to separate our selues in opinion from him and to contradict his writings for the truth

they then that do not acknowledge comets to bee conioyned vnto and depending vpon the effects of the elementarie fire and aire by meanes of exhalations and vapors arising from the earth

do alledge among other reasons that the place which is seene by the inhabitants of milan vnder the circle of winter or the tropick of capricorne is distant from the earth ten times more then the height that the vapors attaine to

and therefore the comets beeing seene there higher then the place of the vapors it necessarily followeth that they are not there ingendred neither yet in the highest of the pure aire called aether considering that there is no matter which may be kindled
but if any one alledge that the combustible humor is rauished and attracted thither by the power of the stars though that this place be higher then the common place of vapors wee may answere that forsomuch as wee behold many comets to continue more then two months and some three that this their long continuance may bee an impediment thereto because that the totall masse of the earth would not be sufficient for such an inflammation
for fire is not perpetually fedde with one onely matter but requireth a new supply
and seeing that these comets haue for the most part a beard or a taile and are seated in an higher place then the aire a man cannot iudge them to bee lesse then the moone
and it seemeth impossible that so much matter should be consumed as might maintaine this huge flame for three moneths
moreouer there is a meanes to know whether the comet be in the region of the aire or else be inge~dred in heauen
for if it be quicker in motion from west to east the the moone is the of necessity must the place of the comet be vnder the lowest sphere but if it be more slow

then without doubt it is bred in heauen
now it is common to all comets to be mooued with three motions namely with the first from east to west in the space of fower twentie houres like all the stars with the second from west to east almost in like space of time with the planet venus
for a comet which appeered the two and twentieth day of september
and ended the third day of december proceeded as fracastorius writeth in
daies from the fift part of virgo to the eight part of scorpio
which maketh manifest that it could not be vnder the moone for then it should haue beene more swiftly mooued then this planet which retrogradeth thirteenth parts of the zodiacke in fower and twentie howers according to the ordinarie course of the first motion and the comet had proceeded but
degrees in
daies
but for the third motion peculiar to all comets which is considered according to the latitude it is such

and so great that if the foresaid author be not deceiued one is now mooued with incredible speed towards the north and another in an instant towards the south
which commeth to passe when the comets are neere to any of the poles for then a little varietie of place conferred to the zodiacke doth greatly change the latitude
besides it is to be noted that the beard of euerie comet doth directly stretch out that way which is opposite to the sunne and when it setteth the same taile is straight eastward as the like may be daily seene in the darke part of the moone
moreouer the comet doth most vsually accompanie the sunne and appeereth not but at at the shutting vp of the day
which giueth vs to vndersta~d

that a comet is a globe placed in heauen which being inlightned by the sunne doth plainely appeere and when his rayes passe farther they shew like the fashion of a bread or of a tayle
whereupon it appeereth that this flaming globe may be made in the midst of the spheres if the generation thereof be in them or else we must say and that seemeth true that the heauen is full of many stars not verie massie which the aire being drie and attenuated do present themselues to our sight
for venus hirselfe is sometimes seene in broad day which none can say to be newly engendred

then through this drines of the aire it commonly happeneth that the seas are much turmoiled with tempests and that great blustring windes doe follow thereupon and that monarches great princes who are most drie through cold watchings or else through abundance of hot and delicate meates and of strong wine do thereupon die so likewise the drie and attenuated aire causeth the waters to diminish fishes to die and scarcitie of victuals which oftentimes stirreth vp seditions and the chaunge of lawes and finally the subuersion of states
all which things say doe seeme in some sort to proceed through the great tenuitie and drines of the aire thereof the comet then appeering may be a signe token but not the cause
but if we wil meditate vpo these things like christians we will say that what naturall causes soeuer naturalists and astrologers can render concerning comets signes and woonders which appeere sometimes in heauen that they should be so often vnto vs like so many trumpets heraulds and of the iustice of god to aduertise men that they remaine not buried in their filth and sinnes but returne to the infinite goodnes of god who reacheth out his hand and calleth to vs through such signes

to change our life and leaue our execrable vices to the ende that through his mercie we may obtaine pardon for our faults

but let vs likewise note that although sundry sorts of comets are seene yet the greekes call them properly stars that haue a sanguine bush of haire and are bristled at the top
and those which haue vnder them a long beard made like haires they call pogonies
plinie reporteth of sundrie other sorts and saith that the shortest time that euer comet was seene to appeare hath beene seuen daies

and the longest time eightie
he maketh mention also of one which seemed terrible about the clime of egypt and ethiopia
for it was flaming and wreathed round like a serpent hauing a very hideous and dreadfull aspect so that one would haue said that it had rather beene a knot of fire then a starre
afterward this author concludeth his speech with the opinion that many haue as is abouesaid that comets are perpetuall and that they haue a proper and peculiar motion saying also that none can see them except they be very far distant from the sunne in such sort that they may not be couered with his beames
and yet the opinion of aristotle is cleane contrarie thereto and so are a great number of other philosophers who affirme that comets are composed of a certaine fire and of an humor which it lighteth on by chance for which cause they are subiect to resolution
but we will proceede no farther in this argument nor yet concerning the situation of them whether they be vnder the spheres or amongst them but will pursue our purpose concerning things vndoubtedly engendred in the highest elements as namely the cloudes
the discourse whereof aram referre to you

of cloudes and vapors
chap

aram

as the lord and father of this great vniuers doth publish his glorie by the motions of the heauens the maruellous courses of all the lights in them so doth he likewise in the aire after many sorts as we haue alreadie heard as we haue yet good proofs in that which is presented vnto vs for the matter of our discourse
and therefore the kingly prophet saith

that the heauens report the glory of god

and the firmament doth declare his works
for the hebrew word which wee call firmament doth properly signifie a spreading abroad and comprehendeth both the heauen and the aire
now let vs first note that there is nothing more weake then the aire nor any element that can worse sustaine a charge if it haue no other prop
then let vs consider of what matter the cloudes are made and what firmenes they may retaine

it is certaine that they are nothing else but vapors attracted out of the waters by the power of the sunne as wee behold after a great raine when the heat of the sunne striketh vpon the earth
for wee perceiue the water to ascend vpwards like a great smoke and wee see an other cleere experience hereof in wet clothes and linnen when they receiue the heat of heauen or of the fire
so it is then that the water ceaseth not to mount from earth vp into the aire and then to descend downe againe so that the course thereof is perpetuall as if there were a sea mounting from earth to heauen which we call aire then descending from thence downe hither to vs
for after that of vapors which ascend from the earth the cloudes are gathered togither which like spunges doe receiue the steame of the waters whereof they themselues are engendred then doe they carrie them like chariots to distribute them through all the quarters of the world according as is ordained by the prouidence of god
and therefore elihu saith in the booke of iob
behold god is excellent and we know it not

neither can the number of his yeeres be searched out when he restraineth the drops of water the raine powreth downe by the vapor thereof which raine the clouds doe drop and let fall abundantly vpon man
then proceeding to shew how god spreadeth out the light of the sunne vpon the waters of the sea to draw out and produce vapors he addeth who can know the diuisions that is the varieties and diuersities of the cloudes and the thunders of his tabernacle behold hee spreadeth his light vpon it and couereth the rootes of the sea
meaning by rootes the waters of the sea as well because they are deepe as for that they are diuided by diuers waues like the branches of rootes

moreouer we must consider that to carrie conuey the cloudes hither and thither god hath created the winds which blow from all the quarters of the world some to gather the cloudes together and to bring raine and snow or haile and tempests by meanes of the same cloudes according as pleaseth the creator

to dispose them other winds on the contrarie do disperse them and make the aire cleere and pleasant bringing faire weather
hereof then it commeth that aboue in the aire betweene heauen and earth there is as it were an other heauen made of clouds spread out like a curtaine and like a vault or couering ouer our heads which hindreth vs of sight of the sunne moone and stars
but as this masse of cloudes is made by meanes of winds ordained thereto so when it pleaseth god to giue vs faire weather then doth he sende vs other winds which chase away all these cloudes and cleere the aire as if they had beene swept away and the heauen sheweth another countenance to the world as if it had beene changed and renued

now while the aire is so filled with cloudes this may verie well be considered by vs that men haue then as it were a great sea of water ouer their heads contayned and held within those cloudes as the waters of the sea are within the bounds which are assigned them for their course
which it seemeth that moses taught when he sheweth that god creating all things separated the waters which are vpon the earth from those which are in the aire

saying thus that there was a stretching out betweene the waters and that it separated the waters from the waters
god then made the firmament or spreading abroad or stretching out and separated the waters which are vnder the firmament from those which were aboue it and it was so
and god called the firmament heauen
it is sure that by these words many haue thought that the prophet would teach that there were waters both vnder aboue heauen which seemeth to be co~firmed by the psalmist

saying praise yee the lord heauens of heauens waters that be aboue the heauens praise his name
neuerthelesse it is not verie easie for vs to vnderstand what waters may be aboue the heauens if we doe not take the name of heauen in these two texts for the aire as wee haue heretofore shewed that it is oftentimes so taken
for what shall wee answere beeing demaunded to what vse the materiall waters may serue either among the spheres or aboue the planets and stars and for to take the name of waters here for spirituall waters not corporall as many haue argued mee seemeth vnder correction of the wiser which wee preferre in all our discourses that this cannot fitly be affirmed because it doth euidently appeare that moses speaketh of materiall waters
for he accommodating himselfe to

a grosse people amongst whom hee conuersed maketh no mention in all the creation of the world but of the creating of visible and corporall things so that there is small likelihood that he should speake of other waters mixing spirituall things with corporall
but because the latin translator of the common version of the bible hath vsed in this text the word firmament following the translation of the greekes and not the proper word spreading abroad as the hebrue phrase doth signifie some of the learned haue obserued how that many latine diuines haue beene hindred from the vnderstanding of this doctrine
for they haue taken the name firmament for the starrie heauen as also the greekes haue iudged imitating their translation
whereupon the imagination is sproong of waters aboue the heauens and of a christalline heauen which suppose to haue been so called

by reason of these waters which were supposed to be aboue the firmament bicause that chrystall is made of ice and ice of water
for it had beene very difficult to conceiue how materiall waters which by nature are corruptible might be aboue the celestiall spheres except they were hardened and conuerted into chrystal bicause that from the moone vpwards there are no creatures subiect to corruption and to such changes as those that are vnder the moone
behold then why these men haue supposed such waters to haue beene made partakers of the nature of heauen
but what neede is there to trauell in such disputations and to take paines for to haue recourse to allegories when one may be easily satisfied with the literall sense for there is nothing more easie then to make the wordes of moses cleere and euident being throughly considered
for first he hath declared

how that the earth was couered all ouer with water and that there was a great deepe ouerwhelmed with darknes so that the earth did in no wise appeere till such time as god had commanded the waters to retire themselues into their places which he hath assigned for their perpetuall residence
and then the earth was discouered euen so much thereof as was needfull for the habitation and nourishment of men and of all the creatures which god did afterwardes create

therefore dauid as the expounder of moses words saith that the lord hath set the earth vpon hir foundations adding straight after that hee had couered it with the deepe as with a garment and that the waters did stand aboue the mountaines but at his rebuke they fled which is as much to

say as when god had commanded the waters to retire and to discouer the earth they suddenly obeied the voice of their creator
now moses hauing spoken of those waters which are resident here belowe on earth gathered as well into the sea as into fountains and riuers he afterwards declareth how god would assigne vnto them another abode in a certaine region of the aire which he first calleth a spreading abroad and after that heauen which the psalmist also signifieth when he saith of god that he couereth himselfe with light as with a garment and spreadeth the heauens like a curtaine which is to say that the light is to the creator like a stately garment wherein we beholde his glorie to shine and glister euery where and that he hath spread abroad the heauens like a pauilion for his habitation
moreouer he addeth the lord doth lay the iousts of his high chambers amo~gst the waters he maketh the great cloudes his chariot he holdeth backe saith iob the face of his throne and stretcheth out his cloude vpon it

and therefore the scripture doth also teach vs that god hath ofte~times declared his presence

manifested his glory both to moses to all the people of israell by the cloudes
and when iesus christ ascended into heauen a cloud taking him bare him vp in the sight of his apostles to declare vnto them and make them sure of the place whither he went vsing this cloude as a triumphant chariot which hath giuen testimonie of his soueraigne and eternall maiestie
and therefore it is also written that he shall come in the cloudes of heauen with power and glorie
wherefore if we were well instructed in the sacred word of god we should haue a verie cleere doctrine concerning meteors and which were much more profitable then that which philosophers teach
for the cloudes would excellently declare vnto vs the magnificence and maiestie of god so often as wee should behold them

and would represent vnto vs all the woonders by vs here mentioned as we shall also be induced to admire them considering more neerely the great miracle of the waters sustained and hanged in the aire as pursuing our purpose leaue to you achitob to discouer

of the waters sustayned and hanged in the aire and of the

who after that he had appointed the heauens for the pauilion of god ordained the cloudes for the planchers thereof whereupon are raised the loftie chambers that is to say the great spatious waters amassed vp within the cloudes which he also proposeth vnto vs as the chariot vpon which the eternall is borne being consequently willing to shew what the horses are by which this chariot is drawen and driuen he saith he walketh vpon the wings of the wind
he maketh the spirits his messengers and flaming fire his ministers which is as much as if in sum he would declare that men need not labour to mount aloft into heauen there to co~template and behold god sith that hee so cleerely manifesteth himselfe throughout the whole world principally by the celestiall creatures and then by the magnificent and maruellous works which he daily performeth heere in the aire neere vnto vs and before our eies
so surely if we must account as great miracles the comming of the sunne vnto vs and his returne which daily continueth and the courses and motions of all the other celestiall bodies we haue no lesse occasion to account as a thing miraculous and worthie of great wonder that we so often behold here below

a great cel of waters ouer our heads in the aire sustained by the water it selfe by vapours like to smoke as if they were hanged in the aire and were there borne vp without any stay and prop but by the inuisible vertue and power of god
for otherwise how could the cloudes sustaine so great heapes and such deepe gulfes of water considering that they are nothing else but water and do also come at le~gth to resolue into water againe how without this diuine power could these cloudes be supported in the aire seeing that the aire it selfe seemeth to consist of waters most subtilly distilled beeing very light and in continuall motion
for it euidently appeareth that the aire retaineth much of the nature of water because that so ordinarily it conuerteth thereinto beeing inclosed in a cold and moist place so that many fountaines

are by this meanes engendred of aire if wee will credite naturalists
and therefore as dauid saith of the waters which runne about the earth that god hath appointed a bound vnto them which they may not passe nor returne any more to ouerflow the habitation of men so may wee likewise say that he hath bounded the waters that hang in the aire within the cloudes to the end that they may not run loosely astray

and therfore iob saith he bindeth the waters in the cloudes and the cloud is not broken vnder them
for else it is most certaine that so often as these waters should fall vpon the earth they would drowne vp all things whereupon they powred like as when the sea and riuers ouerflow the banks or like a great deluge as came to passe when god punished the world by waters

in the time of noah
for it is written that not onely all the fountaines of the great deep were broken vp but that the windowes of heauen were opened and that raine fell vpon the earth forty daies and fortie nights
for which cause also the psalmist singeth the voice of the lord is vpon the waters

the glory of god maketh it to thunder the lord is vpon the great waters
he was set vpon the floud and he shal remaine king for euer which is asmuch to say as the lord hath executed his iudgement vpon the wicked by the waters of the floud and that as then he tooke vengeance so it is he that doth for euer remaine iudge of the world and that maketh all creatures to tremble before him
where wee haue great matter of feare and trembling if wee beleeue the word of god and the testimonies which it deliuereth of his iudgements when say we diligently consider the effects of the nature of the higher elements
therefore whensoeuer wee see close weather and the aire filled with cloudes threatning vs with raine and tempests the sight thereof should alwaies refresh and renew in vs the memorie of this iudgement of god so terrible and vniuersall in the flud to teach vs to walke in more feare of his maiestie
but there are few which thinke thereupon and can make their profite thereof and many to the contrarie doe but iest and scoffe at it as if it were a fable and a fantasie

knowe very well that the scripture saith that god set the in the cloudes for signe of an accord and attonement betweene him and men and euery liuing creature to the ende that the waters might neuer after increase to such a floud as should roote out all flesh
but we must note that the eternall

doth not here promise neuer to send any deluge vpon the earth

but onely not a generall and vniuersall floud as the first was in the time of noah
for how many times hath he punished particularly many people with great inundations and deluges of water signifying vnto all that he hath all his creatures at commandement for euer to make them serue either to his wrath or to his mercie according as he will intreat men and hereupon we shall learne that though it seemeth that in the place before alledged the is named as if it had been spred in the aire at that time onely when it was giuen by god as a signe and sacrament of his couenant renewed yet neuertheles we must not doubt but that when god created the causes of this bowe in nature ordained by him he did also create it in the establishing of the world with other creatures
but it was not vsed by god for a testimonie of his attonement with mankinde till after the flood
so likewise it is certaine that this heauenly bowe hath naturally had at all times the significations which at this present it retaineth to presage raine or faire weather according as it diuersly appeereth
but since that the creator hath accepted it for a signe of his couenant it hath had this vantage to be ordained as a gage and witnes of the promises of god
and therefore whensoeuer we behold it in heauen we must not onely consider of it as of a naturall thing and as a prognosticator sometimes of raine sometimes of faire weather but likewise as a witnes and memoriall as well of the iudgement of god as of his grace and mercie and of the assurance of the conseruation of all creatures by his prouidence
but though it should teach vs nothing of al this but should onely retaine the beautie and naturall signification thereof yet might it serue vs for an excellent testimonie of the maiestie of god and incite vs to giue him praise

for which cause ecclesiasticus saith looke vpon the and praise him that made it very beautifull it is in the brightnes thereof
it compasseth the heauen about with a glorious circle and the hands of the most high haue bended it
for what man is so dull but doth admire the great varietie of so faire colours as appeere in it euen in a substance so fine and subtile that it cannot be perceiued by any corporall sense saue by the sight

know that the philosophers doe teach

that as a drop of water which one seeth in the sunne representeth many goodly colours like those in the which is made of a thicke watrie

cloud full of drops in the middle region of the aire
for euery darke obscure thing is as it were almost blacke as the shadowes doe demonstrate which by reason of their obscuritie seeme to be blacke
and when an obscure thing is illuminated if it be bright it passeth in colours according to the abundance of the brightnes
now the cloud is obscure the drops of water are bright for this cause they represent vnto vs colours according to the variety of that light which shineth vpo them
and forsomuch as the innermost circle of the bow is nerest to the obscure or dark cloud it seemeth co~monly to be blew that in the middle which is more illuminate appeereth greene and the vpper circle which is greatest and most lighted with celestiall brightnes is yellow
forasmuch then as there is a cause of euery thing the naturalists doe much endeuour themselues to render reasons concerning the diuersities of these colours as astrologians doe also to argue vpon the diuers predictions of this bowe as presaging sometimes raine sometimes faire weather sometimes winde and sometimes calme and cleere weather

yet plinie saith that it is often seene when it doth not prognosticate any thing and that no heede is taken of it for the time to come
but let euery one ascertaine himselfe that it is caused by the beames of the sunne which striking into an hollow cloud are constrained to reuerberate and returne vpwardes toward the sunne
and that the diuersitie of colours which are therein represented is made by the mixture of the clouds of the aire and of the fire which are found there togither
moreouer that this bow neuer is but when the sunne is opposit to that cloud and that it exceedeth not the forme of a semicircle also that it appeereth not by night though aristotle saith that it hath sometimes been then seene
but we wil leaue the philosophers to dispute vpon these things and to search the depth of their naturall causes and will conclude this speech and make an end of this day with a point of doctrine concerning the meteors of christians which is that we must take very good heed not to be of the number of those who boasting of the knowledge of humane sciences haue despised the spirituall and diuine and of whom saint peter hath prophecied saying

that there shoulde come in the last daies mockers and contemners of god walking according to their owne lusts which should say where is the promise of his comming for since the fathers died all thinges continue alike from the creation
which is as much as if they

should say that there is a common and continuall course of nature which hath hitherto continued from the beginning of the world and shall endure for euer without end and without any judgement of god to come

for thus prate our idolaters of nature who doe altogither denie the prouidence of god
and therefore the blessed apostle doth also adde that they willingly know not that the heauens were of old and that earth that was of the water and the water by the word of god
by which things the world that was perished being ouerflowed with waters
likewise saint peter had before concluded

that if god hath not spared the old world but saued noah the eight person a preacher of righteousnes and brought in the floud vpon the troup of the vngodly it cannot be that the wicked which are borne since into the world may thinke that their condemnation sloweth and that their perdition sleepeth
for a thousand yeeres are but as one day and one day is as a thousand yeeres before the lord

and the long terme that god alloweth to men to preuent his iudgement by repentance and amendment shall not hinder him to execute his iudgement yea by so much the more rigorously by how much the more long time and more vilely they haue abused his stay and patience
let vs then imprint this at this present in our memorie concerning our discourse of the waters sustained and hanged in the aire which haue serued god for so terrible ministers in the execution of his iustice when it pleased him to punish the iniquitie of men and to morrow pursuing our subiect we will speake againe of raines and heauenly waters to the end to consider of the admirable prouidence of god which shineth in them euen as you aser shall giue vs to vnderstand

the end of the sixt day

the seventh daies worke
of dewes and raine
chapter

aser

the prouidence of god hath so disposed the nature of the aire and of the water that these elements seeme to repaire and maintaine one another
for there is a place in the aire where water is as it were conuerted into the nature thereof there is another place againe wherein water returneth into his owne natural kinde sauing that whilest it hangeth and is sustained in the aire it is much more light and subtile then that which runneth in the earth for it retaineth more of the earth

although then that water is by nature more heauie then the aire yet doth not the heauines thereof let it from mounting vp from the earth because that by the heate of the sunne which attracteth it and other such like naturall causes by which it may be eleuated into the aire this waightines is taken from it or at least is so diminished that it doth then retaine more of the nature of aire then of water and so doth till such time as it hath ascended and attained to the place which god hath assigned to it in the aire
for the heate of the sun doth conuert it first into vapors which are drawne out of the least terrestriall and most subtile parts thereof which approch neerest to the nature of the aire
for which cause these vapors are more easily conuerted into aire the which resolueth it selfe againe into water then when such vapors are arriued at the middle region of the aire which is the coldest part thereof as well by reason that it is farther distant from the sunne and from all the other celestiall and aetherian fires then the supreme part thereof is as likewise because it cannot be heated like the lowest part thereof by reuerberation of the sunnes heate which scorcheth the earth
wherefore moses declaring vnto vs how the lord made the water mount from the earth and conuerted it into vapors saith

the lord god had not caused it to raine vpon the earth

neither was there a man to til the ground but a mist or vapor went vp from the earth and watered all the earth
for we behold euery day how that after the aire hath beene refreshed by the coolenes of the night the dew falleth in the morning vpon the earth and if the colde hath beene great it is turned into miste white from which proceed the frosts that doe oftentimes spoile vines and trees which are most tender in colde weather when their branches are yet feeble and they begin to budde

and let vs note that there are two sorts of vapors

which do commonly rise from the terrestriall towards the celestiall region the one is fat and thicke whereof the dewe is made and the other is subtile and thinne which turneth into raine
cornefields are fatned by the dewe which by reason of the thicknes thereof mounteth not very high and if that any part of it be better concocted as doth happen ordinarily in hot countries it resteth condensate through colde vpon the plants and is called manna
of this it is that pliny speaketh when he saith

that the great starres being risen in sommer and specially the most excellent or else when the is ouer the earth and that it raine not but onely make a small dewe which is heated by the that which then falleth is not home but is an heauenly gift and singular medicine for the eies for vlcers and for those accidents which may happen in the nauell and interior parts
which manna is plentifully gathered in targa a wildernes of libya neere to the citie agades especially when the nights are very faire partly for that they are colder then the day and partly for that the dewes cannot conuert themselues into the substance of clouds because as said it is condensate by the cold
whereupon ensueth that when the raine is ingendred of vapors the colde cannot be great for then such vapors are attracted by the heate and are presently after thickned by the colde in the region of the aire
and therefore there is but little manna founde when the night is cloudie and lesse when it is rainie for then it melteth
behold then how the fattest part of vapors turneth into dew that which mounteth vp is condensate through colde in the subtile aire

and is afterwardes conuerted into raine
and bicause that in sommer the heate doth drie vp very neere so much as it attracteth in vapors there is therefore verie seldome little raine therein for considering

that in our countries the heate is weake it attracteth by little and little the vapors which the drinesse doth oftentimes consume before they can be conuerted into raine
wherefore it commeth to passe that if it raine in sommer the raine is suddenly engendred for when the cloudes are too slowe they are consumed by the drinesse of the sunne
and there where the aire is very cold and consequently thicke and grosse the vapor which is thither drawne being very light cannot be condensate bicause of the thicknes of the aire and the thinnesse of the vapor
which causeth that in stead of raine snow is engendred for snowe is a congelation of a vapor not condensate for the subtilitie of his proper substance and for bicause of the thicknes of the aire
wherefore when the cold is great in winter it raineth little
and for the spring time bicause that the succeeding day doth consume more vapor then the precedent day had attracted for in the spring time the latter daies are still hotter and haue shorter nights for this cause it raineth then lesse then in autumne and oftner then in sommer or winter
but in autumne showres of raine are commonly great and of long continuance for the sunne being as then still powerfull vpon the earth many vapors are drawen vp
but bicause the succeeding day hath still a longer night then the precedent and for that it was also warmer it is necessarie that the vapor should thicken and afterwardes descend
and when the earth is moistned then that which did descend is againe attracted lying then vpon the superficies of the earth and being still somewhat deeper then before
whereof are made not onely raines but also rainie and windie cloudes

thus haue we in summe then the forme of dewes and raine and the diuersitie of their course and how the earthly and heauenly waters differ from one another the raine water retaining more of the aire and being much purer and lighter then that which doth alwaies remaine in the earth
for in comparison of terrestriall water it is like water distilled through a limbeck
and yet how light soeuer it be it must neuertheles be heauier then the aire and especially when it is frozen within the cloudes and conuerted into snow or haile which is like stones of ice
wherein it seemeth that this rule of nature and naturall philosophie is not generally true which affirmeth that euery heauie thing doth alwaies drawe downwards considering there are waters hanged in the aire which is much lighter then the waters that it sustaineth

wherefore we must say

that cloudes are in the aire in the region that is assigned vnto them in such sort as ships are in the water
for none doubteth but that stones iron lead and all other mettals yea infinite other things of lesse waight are heauier then the water yet we neuertheles doe behold that there is no burthen so waightie but the water doth easily support it by meanes of a boat or a wooden ship or a galley which shall be euen of it selfe a great and heauie loade
and yet the water which will sustaine such a charge cannot beare vp a pinne or a naile or a small peece of gold or siluer or a little stone but all shall sinke to the bottome
now the cause of all these effects is in the participation that the wood hath with the aire which maketh it much lighter then the other bodies which are more solide and massie
for by reason that the wood is more open and more loose to giue way to the aire it receiueth lightnes thereof which causeth it to floate vpon the water whereas the other more terrestriall bodies doe sinke thereinto
so then the aire sustaineth by meanes of the cloudes the waters which they containe inclosed within them euen as the sea and great riuers sustaine grosse and heauie burthens by meanes of ships
for though the cloudes doe consist of water themselues and are engendred of it being drawne into the aire through blowing of the windes and afterwards massed vp in one bodie as we haue already vnderstood yet doe they subsist of a water lesse terrestriall and more airie then those waters which flowe here belowe for which cause they are also more light and more easily sustained by the aire vpon which they floate like ships vpon the sea and other waters
and afterwardes when the cloudes returne into their first nature of water and when they be opened to let fall the waters which they containe the water which proceedeth from them doth resume also his proper course according to the naturall heauines thereof and returneth downwards descending to the earth
and as ships sinke downe into the water when they are ouercharged as likewise the charges and burdens wherewith they are laden when they are split or broken by violence of windes or by some other force which maketh them dash one against another and against the rocks so is it with the cloudes and with the things which they beare and with the windes also wherewith they are driuen or else are inclosed within them which make a great noise when they striue to issue out so that the cloudes are rent and cracke as

the thunders testifie vnto vs and the tempests lightnings and thunder claps which proceede from them as also the great deluges of water which showre downe with great violence and furie
but we haue staied long ynough in this matter let vs now consider of the maruellous prouidence of god which shineth in the dispensation of the raine and heauenly waters
as amana leaue to you to discourse

of the fertilitie caused by dewes and raine and of the prouidence of god therein
chap

amana

in vaine shall we consider in meteors the works of nature which are therein proposed very great and excellent as our precedent speech doth manifest if we doe not learne in the same to consider and acknowledge the prouidence of god gouerning all things as it reuealeth it selfe in sundry sorts
for all these goodly visible works must serue vs as images of the inuisible and spirituall things so that all the creatures of god may be competent iudges to condemne vs if by them we doe not learne to acknowledge their and our creator and to obey and honor him as behooueth vs we neede no other iudges say to make vs vnexcusable before the throne of gods iustice

according to the testimonie of saint paul sith he hath as it were made visible to the eie his diuinitie his power his bountie and his wisdome through his works and that so neere vnto vs as almost to be touched with our owne hands
for as this holy apostle in another place saith he is neere to euery one of vs

so that howsoeuer we be blind yet should we at least finde him by groping like those that want sight
for he neuer wa~teth very euident witnes amongst men in co~ferring benefits vpon them namely in giuing them raine from heauen and fruitful seasons according to the subiect we are now to speake of
let vs know then that it is he who distributeth the raine and heauenly waters by an admirable prouidence who also keepeth them hidden when he pleaseth in such sort that there is no cloud seene in the aire and sometimes for so long space that the earth becommeth drie and as it were burnt vp with the beames of the sunne for want of moisture from heauen

as it was in the dayes of elias
and

then he executed the sentence wherwith he threatned the transgressors of his law when he denounced to them by moses

that he would make the heauen as brasse and the earth as iron that is to say that there should come no more raine from heauen then if it were of brasse whereupon doth also follow that the earth not being moistned with water from heauen should become barren bearing no more fruit then if it were of iron
for as it is written the earth which drinketh in raine that commeth oft vpon it

and bringeth forth herbes meete for them by whom it is dressed receiueth blessing of god
but that which beareth thornes and briers is reprooued and is neere vnto cursing whose end is to be burned
and therefore likewise the prophet saith in the psalmes

that god turneth the flouds into deserts and springs of water into drynes and the fruitfull ground into saltnes which is as much as if he should say that he maketh it altogether barren as if one had sowed salt there
adding also afterwards that it is for the wickednes of those that dwel therein that contrariwise he turneth the deserts into pooles of water and the into making it an habitation for such as were famished who there sow the fields and plant vines which bring forth yeerly fruit
for this cause the lord being angrie with his people saith by isay

will commaund the cloudes that they shall distill no raine vpon my
meaning by this kinde of speech his people whom he hath elected
and surely the holy spirit would giue vs to vnderstand this one thing more in this text that as the earth waxeth barren if it be not watred by raine from heauen so men cannot performe any thing if god powre not downe his grace vpon them as he causeth the to showre downe vpon the earth
wherefore as it is vnfruitfull not being watred from heauen euen so is mankinde when god withdraweth his blessing
for we are all cursed by nature as the earth is as we euen now heard the apostle giue euidence

when therefore it pleaseth the creator he commandeth the cloudes to distribute their waters to the end that the earth may be moistned watred to make it fertile
and therfore the kingly prophet saith againe
thou visitest the earth and watrest it

thou makest it verie rich the riuer of god is full of water thou preparest the corne for so thou appointest it
thou watrest abundantly the furrowes thereof thou causest the raine to descend into the valleies thereof thou makest it soft with showres

and blessest the bud thereof
thou crownest the yeere with thy goodnes and thy steps drop fatnes
meaning by the steps or paths and walkes of the lord the cloudes for that the scripture proposeth him vnto vs walking vpon them and by fatnes he vnderstandeth the raine which droppeth vpon the earth as it doth also serue therefore
and in another psalme he againe recordeth the lord watreth the mountaines from his loftie chambers which is as much to say as god causeth it to raine vpon the mountaines to make them fruitfull
and therefore he further addeth that the earth is filled with the fruit of his workes
wherein the prophet doth also expound his owne meaning saying before that the laide the planchers of his high chambers amongst the waters and after that he hath generally entreated of the fertilitie which god bestoweth vpon the earth by meanes of the raine he doth declare it more particularly

saying he causeth grasse to grow for the cattell and herbe for the vse of man that he may bring foorth bread out of the earth and wind that maketh glad the heart of man and oyle that maketh the face to shine and bread that strengthneth mans heart
the high trees are satisfied euen the cedars of libanon which he hath planted
that the birds may make their nests there the storke dwelleth in the
where we cleerely behold how god sendeth his blessing vpon the earth by meanes of the raine to the ende that it may bring foorth fruits not onely for the nourishment of men but also for the commoditie of beasts
which may serue vs for a certaine testimonie of his prouidence towards mankinde

for if he hath care of the bruit beasts which he hath created for men there is no doubt but he hath much more care of them whom he hath created after his owne image and semblance and aboue all of his children and elect
and for this cause also the psalmist signifieth how that god hath not onely beene carefull to prouide for their necessities as for the necessities of other creatures but it hath also pleased him to bestowe vpon them pleasures and honest comforts conuenient both for his maiestie as also for the nature of man when hee saith that god hath giuen wine to man to make him merrie and oyle to make his face shine
for although he alreadie had the waters for drinke and which might suffice him to staunch his thirst and for his necessarie beuerage it hath neuerthelesse pleased him through his great liberalitie to bestow wine

vpon him also which is a much more delicious drinke and which doth so comfort him that it bringeth ioy pleasure to him
and for oyle it doth not onely serue in meates and medicinall ointments but also to make compositions and sweete sauours to beawtifie and refresh mans countenance
which specialities the prophet would not omit because that in his daies oyle was in great vse to make such precious ointments as the auncients vsed to annoint themselues withall as is now adaies done with oyle of spike and other such odoriferous oyles and sweete water

and if god hath at some times multiplied by the hands of his faithfull ministers the poore widowes oyle as his worde teacheth vs he causeth it to abound much more euerie day when he maketh it encrease in the lands which he hath destinated to that purpose conuerting the water which runneth vpon the oliue trees into oyle yea and that water which droppeth vpon the earth into corne and bread which he dayly doth much more abundantly multiply then in times past hee did the poore widowes meale by elias

yea then iesus christ did multiply the loaues in the wildernes
and therefore if we shall consider how the creator of heauen earth causeth so many fruits to grow in this through the distillations of raine and through the heate of the sunne wee hold in great admiration this woorthie naturall alchimie which he hath set before our eies in the nature by him created

for all this world is to him as a fornace and a limbeck wherein he maketh so many goodlie and profitable distillations that it is altogither impossible to expresse in words their woorth and valew
the earth is this fornace and all the plants and trees so many limbecks
and if we haue in such estimation the distillations made by men following some imitation of nature this surely is a kinde of alchymy very woorthie of great reputation and woonder
for let vs consider onely what it is that hee extracteth out of a vine stocke and the branches
there is no doubt but that this is a plant of no great shew so that many haue doubted whether it might rightfully be counted amongst trees for besides that it is crooked it is so weak that it cannot stand vpright nor sustaine not onely the branches thereof but euen it selfe if it be not alwaies propped at leastwise when it riseth neuer so little high and yet this is a marueilous and very rare limbeck wherein god conuerteth water into wine and maketh it to distill out
the like may we saie of

and many other sauing that they make more shew and retaine more of the nature of a tree then the vine doth
for all the excellent liquors and fruits which we draw out of these plants and all others are principally caused by the heat of the sunne and by the waterings of raine from heauen which by this meanes seemeth to change nature and put on diuers formes
and yet this sun by meanes of whom as by a fire god performeth so many sundry and admirable conuersions and distillations hath not his face smeared with coles to kindle and maintaine his fire nor yet his faire eie soiled therewith or with any smoke
so then hold them very wise who profite in the contemplation of this alchymie and emploie their time and cunning therein as husbandmen do who till the earth attending in good hope after their trauell the blessing which is promised them of god as he also doth daily send vpon the earth by the effects of the sunne moone stars and planets of the aire clouds raine and such other meanes which it pleaseth him to vse for the same purpose

for we may fitly say with salomon that without this blessing it is in vaine for those which eate the bread of their trauel

to rise earely to goe late to bed
for it is he that hath promised the first and the latter raine aswell for the time to sowe in as for to ripen and gather fruits in vsing for this purpose according to the testimonie of the prophet great cloudes in forme of chariots

whereupon being borne on the winges of the winde he maketh the windes his messengers
and sith we are in this talke before we deale with any other subiect let vs acquit our selues of that which we haue promised to entreat in a particular discourse concerning the windes the charge whereof aram impose vpon you

of the windes and of their kindes and names and of the testimonies which we haue in them of the power and maiestie of god
chapter

aram

according to the testimonie of plinie there are more then twentie greeke authors and manie other ancients who haue entreated of the nature of the winds
but to know from whence they proceeded the difficulties

doubts are great vncertaine amongst them and amongst all the philosophers
yet that is the onely truth which the diuine poet teacheth vs saying

that the lord draweth the windes out of his treasures
aristotle in his meteors maintaineth that the windes are produced by the heate of the sunne which it seemeth that the author of the naturall historie doth contradict when he saith that there are certaine caues wherein the windes are ordinarily engendred as may be seene in a deepe pit which is in the coastes of dalmatia at senta wherein if one cast any thing how light soeuer it be there issueth sodainelie out a although the weather be neuer so calme and faire
and in many obscure places in houses one shall commonly feele a certaine small winde as if it were enclosed therein
but we must note that there is much difference betwixt these particularities or small puffes caused by exhalations which proceed out of the earth and that which is properly named the winde
for they are not felt in one place onely but haue their course generally through all the earth and their meanes limited therein to exercise their power

and therefore whether the winde be engendred by continual motion of the heauen or by the crosse motions of the planets which goe contrarie to that of the firmament or else that the winde be an aire driuen by the sundry turnings of the spheres and by the multiplicitie of the beames of the celestiall signes or else that it proceed from stars particularly appointed to ingender it or from the fixed starres for all these opinions are found amongst philosophers yet neuerthelesse we see by experience that the winde is subiect to the rules and lawes of nature that it hath his determinate course although mans wit cannot pierce to sound the reason of this secret

but for the names and species of these windes they haue amplie entreated thereof
true it is that the ancients made mention but of fower windes which they comprised vnder the fower parts of the world
and then the naturall philosophers appointed twelue giuing them names taken partly from the regions from which they proceeded and partly from the effects and qualities which they cause vpon the earth
but the hydrographers and marriners account sixteene

to haue the vnderstanding of which wee must note that euery horizon is diuided into fower quarters by two right lines which crosse in the center thereof the one of which is correspondent to the meridian circle and the

other to the verticall circle which diuideth the same meridian at right angles which lines demonstrate the fower principall parts of the earth that is the east west north and south part of which proceed the fower principall windes to wit out of the septentrionall part the north winde from the meridionall the south from the orientall the east and from the occidentall the west betweene which are other middle and notable windes whose names are compounded of those of the fower foresaide windes and are therefore called and
then againe each distinction of these eight windes is consequently diuided into two equall parts which make the distinctions of eight other windes called and which compound their names of their two next collaterall windes expressing the most notable first to wit
moreouer they that frequent the mediterran sea as greekes and italians do cal the north transmontano the south austro east leuante west ponante northeast greco northwest maestro southeast sirocho southwest garbin and so of them compound the names of the other eight windes which are betwixt them as hath beene before declared
and we must note that the windes haue commonly euery one their turne in such sort that when one opposite wind ceaseth and is laid his contrarie riseth

but if at any time the next winde to that which ceaseth begin to blowe it runs from left hand to right as the sun doth and one may know the fourth daie of the moone what winde will raigne longest during her time
but the easterne windes do longer endure then those which rise towards the west
and the sunne doth strengthen the winde and also appease it for at his rising setting they are commonly greatest at noone he calmeth them especially in sommer
the winde is also commonly found to lie still either at midday or at midnight for it doth alwaies cease either through great colde or through vehement heate
likewise the raine doth make it cease whereupon this prouerbe sprung vp that little raine allaieth much winde

but it is woondrous that the windes which are as it were but a puffe should performe such things as men could not doe with their hands yea though there were a multitude togither
for how many people neede there be yea horses and oxen yoked togither

to breake burst and pull vp the great and mightie trees which the winde abateth ouerturneth breaketh and rooteth vp with a blast onely and herein we haue goodly matter againe

whereby to profite in the acknowledgement of the soueraigne maiestie and almightie prouidence of the creator and gouernour of all nature
for it is certaine that as the lord manifesteth himselfe to men such as they may comprehend him to be when he calleth the sound and noise of thunder his voice that he performeth admirable things as we haue alreadie noted we may perceiue that he doth the like also by violence of the windes
and therefore the prophet saith know that the lord is great and that our god is aboue all gods
whatsoeuer pleased the lord

that did he in heauen and in earth in the sea and in all the depths
he bringeth vp the cloudes from the ends of the earth and maketh the lightnings with the raine he draweth foorth the winde out of his treasures

it is he saith ieremie that giueth by his voice the multitude of waters in the heauen and he causeth the cloudes to ascend from the ends of the earth he casteth out lightnings in the raine and bringeth foorth the windes out of his treasures
the winde saith the preacher goeth towarde the south

and compasseth toward the north the winde goeth round about and returneth by his circuits
now if the blasts of the winds be so strong it must needes be that the bellowes out of which they are blowen must be puissant and mightie
for although it is written of the wicked

that they are so proud and doe presume so much of their force and power that they seeme to be able to ouerthrow men townes and fortified places onely with a blast yet neuertheles it is the lord who hath the power to abate them and all the loftie and stout with all their forts and bulwarks for all the windes togither are but as one little puffe which passeth from his mouth
wherefore if in breathing onely he driueth and remooueth heauen earth and the sea and all this world performing actes so great and woonderfull what may we esteeme of his soueraigne force when he would imploy his whole power for there is neither winde nor thunder nor deluges of water nor any thing that is comparable to the wrath of god and to the power which he hath to execute his vengeance vpon his enemies
but he emploieth his creatures as the ministers of his wrath when and how he pleaseth
and therefore the diuine poet in his canticles wishing liuely to describe the assistance that god had

shewed him

in deliuering him out of the hands of the wicked and in punishing them he proposeth him comming accompanied with fearefull thunders with thicke cloudes with vehement windes and stormes with lightnings tempests great raine hard haile and darke weather so that the foundations of the sea and of the earth couered with waters were discouered and the earth was mooued and trembled the mountaines shooke and bowed bicause of the furie of the wrath of the lord
for indeede who is god but the lord and who is mightie but our god now it is certaine that bicause men cannot comprehe~d the greatnes of the power and wrath of god against the wicked the holy ghost doth often speake of naturall things by the prophets for to make them vnderstand by that which is visible in nature and which may most astonish and affray them
so then if we shall consider so many excellent points of doctrine concerning the prouidence of god as are taught vs in the schoole of nature by meanes of the meteors as we haue hitherto discoursed of the cloudes thunders lightnings stormes flouds of water windes whirlewindes and tempestes they will serue vs no lesse for preachers then the celestiall bodies doe to manifest vnto vs especially the iudgements and heauie plagues of the almightie and to make vs oftner thinke thereupon then we doe as also the raines by the fertilitie which they cause in the earth will minister matter vnto vs to acknowledge his blessing and perpetuall grace vpon those who feare and honour him
wherefore wee haue rested long ynough in that which particularly concerneth and is dependent vpon the two higher elements the fire and the aire sauing that before we intreat of the earth and of the water and of the principall things worthy of consideration in them we wil say somewhat concerning the birdes of the aire seeing that we haue already comprised them as in truth they must be amongst the things conioyned and depending vpon the higher elements will leaue you then achitob to discourse vpon their nature

of the foules of the aire and namely of the manucodiata of the eagle of the phenix and of other wilde foule
chap

achitob

hauing discoursed though simply like disciples of christian doctrine and not like masters and professors of naturall philosophie vpon the two higher elements the fire and the aire and hauing considered their nature and effects and the things engendred in them and by them it falleth very fitly for vs to intreate of the visible creatures which conuerse in the aire

and of which the holy scripture speaketh in diuers places vnder the name of the foules of the aire considering also that moses teacheth that the foules and fishes were created before any of the terrestriall creatures
for as there is a greater accord between the two elements of water and aire then of aire and earth euen so is there a more correspondencie of nature between fishes and foules then between beasts of the earth and foules
for the flying of birds in the aire is like the swimming of fishes in the water
moreouer there are many which are as it were of a middle nature betweene those which conuerse but only in the aire or in the earth and which therein receiue their nouriture and betweene the fishes that liue in the waters
for these birds flie in the aire like other birds and swim also in the water like fishes and liue partly in the water and partly in the aire
but before we intreate particularly of these things it seemeth good to me to note vpon the beginning of our discourse concerning liuing creatures that there are two principall kindes of liuing creatures

the first are those which haue life in euery part being diuided and cut asunder called in latine insecta bicause of the incisions which they seeme to haue vpon their bodies and which are ingendred of putrifaction
the second sort is of perfect creatures to whom the former properties agree not but they haue their generation through propagation and race
now we must hereafter speake of insect creatures
and for the perfect

there are found nine principall kindes of them whereof some remaine onely in the aire and haue no feet as the bird called manucodiata other conuerse in

the aire and in the earth as the eagle and sundry other birds some are earthly and yet like foules neuertheles as is the estridge some inhabite both in the earth and in the water as the beauer called in latine fiber some foules swim as the swan some creatures are flying fishes others are altogither earthly as the dog some keepe vnder ground as the mole others liue in the water onely as the dolphin our speech then shall be concerning these nine kinds of creatures and we wil briefly discourse of some of the most excellent of them

now to begin with the birds according as the order of our treatise doth require we will speake of the manucodiata commonly called the birde of god or of paradise according to the interpretation of the indian name which birde is found dead vpon the earth or in the sea in the isles named the malucos bicause it is neuer seene aliue out of the aire for this birde onely hath no feete for that it abideth aloft in the aire and farre out of mans sight hauing the body and beake like a swallow both in bignes and forme
the feathers of his wings and taile are longer then those of a but very slender agreeable to the smalenes of the bird
the back of the cock is holow whereby reason sheweth that the hen layeth her egges in this hollownes seeing that she hath the like creuise in her belly so that by means of both these pits she may hatch her egges
the meate of this foule is the dewe of heauen which serueth it for meate drinke it neuer faileth but through age onely and so long as they liue they sustaine themselues with their owne wings and their taile being spred out in a roundnes by which meanes it doth more commodiously inhabite in the aire

next proceed to the birds which conuerse in the aire and in the earth of which the eagle for greatnes and strength beareth away the price
plinie setteth downe sixe kindes of which the least in body called the blacke eagle is strongest and it of all others doth onely nourish her eaglets
for all the rest chase and driue away their yoong ones bicause that when they haue them their nailes and clawes are turned vpside downe as if nature woulde declare hirselfe very prouident in this to depriue the eagle of al meanes to helpe it selfe with any more purchase then will euen serue her owne turne for otherwise it woulde destroy all the yoong venison of a countrey therefore through hunger which by this occasion they do then sustaine they become white

and hate their yoong ones
but the ossifragi which are another sort of wilde eagles doe as diuers affirme gather togither the yoong eaglets which their dam hath expelled and doe nourish them with their owne
and eagles neuer die through age or any other malady but for hunger onely their vppermost beak growing so great and so crooked that it is impossible for them to open their mouthes to feede themselues
their feathers being mingled with the feathers of other birds do deuoure and consume them

the phenix is said to be found in no other place of the world but only in arabia is very seldome seen
it is as big as an eagle

and the plumes of her taile are guilded being intermixed with certaine blew and carnation feathers the rest of her body being of a purple colour
she hath her head decked with exquisite plumes and with a tuft of very goodly feathers
she liueth sixe hundred and sixtie yeeres as manilius a senator of rome recordeth and so plinie doth make report
and feeling herselfe aged

she maketh her nest with peeces of cynamon and incense and hauing filled it with all sorts of aromaticall odors she dieth thereupon
and out of her marrow and bones there commeth first a worme which afterward turneth to a little birde that in time prooueth another phenix

some report almost the very same of a birde called semenda which is found in the midst of india which hath her bill clouen into three parts boared and pearced euery where through and she singeth at her death as the swan doth
afterward by beating of her wings she kindleth a fire made of the twigs of a vine which she gathereth togither wherewith she is burned and of her ashes there is a worme engendred of which springeth againe another like birde

swans are birds cleane white and differ but little from geese

except in bignes
they sing sweetelier then any other foules
their propertie is to teare their yoong ones in peeces and to deuour them for which cause they are very rare to be found
and some say that they presage their death by their songs

cranes come from the farthest orientall seas of india into the regions of europe and do neuer part from any place

but that they seeme to do it with counsell and by the common consent of all and by the same meanes they elect a king to conduct them
they alwaies soare very high so to make a farther discouerie of

the countrey
euery troupe hath a captaine who is alwaies in the rereward at whose onely crie all the rest do obey and do keepe their rankes and order and each of them taketh his place by turnes
they do also set their night watch and keepe sentinell one after another
the sentinell standeth vpon one foote onely holding a little stone in the other to the end that if he happen to sleepe the stone which falleth out of his paw might waken him
all the rest do this while sleepe hauing their head vnder their wing keeping watch neuertheles sometimes vpon one foote sometimes vpon another
but their captaine holdeth his head alwaies in the aire to make signe to the rest of what they are to doe

the storkes are resident in winter in egypt and in africa and in sommer in many other warme countries
when they will passe to any countrey they do all assemble in one place at a daie appointed and so depart in a troupe
some say they haue no toongs
in thumenestia this kinde of foule is had in such respect bicause they ridde the countrey of serpents that no man dare kill any one vpon paine of hanging and to be punished as an homicide for such are the lawes of the countrey
and in suessia the like is almost vsed
the storkes do neuer change their nests and doe retaine this propertie by nature that the yoong ones nourish the old so long as they liue

are a kinde of wilde foules as the foresaid birds they make their squadrons pointed like the beake of a ship for so they cut the aire better then if they should flie in a square and they spred themselues abroad by little and little behinde like a corner the better to gaine the wind which guideth them
the commonly rest their heads vpon the foremost and when the guide is wearie of going before he commeth hindmost to the end that euery one may keepe his turne

quailes are also a kinde of flying foules very small of body but singular in diuers properties
they soare not very high in the aire in these countries but flie neere to the ground
they flie in troupes and that sometimes to the great danger of those which saile vpon the sea or are neere the ground for these birdes doe pearch in so great number by night vpon the sailes that they oftentimes sinke barkes and small vessels
they know their ordinarie pearches and do neuer flie abroad in a south winde bicause it is too heauie and too moist and yet they must of necessitie be

aided by the winde to performe their voyage by reason that their bodies are more heauie then their wings can sustaine
and therefore they hang their wings as if they were pained with flying so then they make choise of the northerne winde for their comming and when they retire themselues they assemble their troupes
if the winde be contrarie to them they swallow much grauell and take little stones in their tallents to make themselues more heauie that they may not be caried away by the winde

swallowes also are a kinde of wilde fowle

for they go away in winter
but they retire not themselues verie far off but keepe in those coasts which are warmed with the sunne many are seene bare and vnfledged
this bird onely of all those that haue not crooked clawes doth feed on flesh
one may put in the number of wilde fowles thrushes stares

ringdoues and pigeons although they vse not to retire to farre countries
but they mew not as others doe neither keepe themselues close for they are vsually seene in the countrey where they winter
the propertie of stares is to go in a great troupe together and to flie in a round euerie one of them endeuouring to gaine the middle place
the swallow onely of all other birds flieth askew is passing quick of wing so likewise is it hardest of all birds to be taken
moreouer it is peculiar to hir not to feed but in flying
thus then you see what thought to deduce briefly concerning
you aser shall prosecute the discourse of this matter

of singing birdes and chiefly of the nightingall and of sundrie others and of their witte and industrie
chap

aser

nature sheweth herselfe verie admirable in that she doth not produce euerie thing indifferently in all places nor doth priuiledge some countries rather then others as well for plants as for liuing creatures indued with sense so that many times that which men thinke to bring home for meere strangenes dieth before it come there
to declare that it is verie difficult if not altogether impossible

to make any thing liue in what place soeuer

against the ordinance of nature
so it was that in the whole isle of rhodes there could not be found one only nest of an eagle though that in the neighbouring territories there were ynough
so though the lake of como which is on the other side of the riuer po in italy be very plentiful in fruit trees faire pasturage yet for all this there cannot be found within eight miles almost one storke
it is said also that in all tarentum there is not one to be found
and in the territory of athe~s the partridges passe not the limits of boeotia so in mar maggiore or the euxine sea there is no fowle seene
and in volaterra the are seene to come euerie yeere in great vollies ouer the sea
but besides all this there is great difference in seasons for birdes for some appeere all the yeere long others shew themselues but halfe the yeere some are seen abroad but three moneths
some also go away presently after they haue hatched and brought vp their yoong ones
but aboue all there are maruellous things found in singing birdes
for some there are which chaunge their feathers and their note one season of the yeere so that one would say they were quite other birdes which happeneth not to the greater fowles except to the crane which waxeth blacke in age


which are naturally blacke being old become of a reddish colour
they sing in sommer in winter they doe but chatter and are altogether dumbe when the daies begin to lengthen as about and the cockes of a yeere old haue an iuorie white bill
thrushes haue their necke particoloured in sommer but in winter it is all of one colour

but amongst singing birdes the nightingal is most admirable
for it is a miracle that so shrill a voice can proceed out of so small a bodie and that it can hold breath so long
moreouer it hath a verie harmonious note and perfectly musicall
for sometimes shee draweth out her notes long another while shee quauers straightwaies she cuts her tune short and then she will warble as if it were by musicall crotchets
another time she will whistle producing her notes with one breath by and by quickning her tune as if it were by semibriefes sometimes abasing hir voice presently raising it and by and by after cutting it thicke and short
sometimes also she will make the points of the organes lifting her voice high like a pipe when she listeth obseruing somtimes the treble sometimes the base and sometimes the countertenour

finally there is no instrument in the world wherein one may finde more perfect musicke then this which resoundeth in so small a throat
and that which merits greater maruell in this bird is that there are many songs all different and that euerie nightingall hath her owne in particular
so also they debate amongst themselues who shall sing best contending heerein one against another so that sometimes the vanquished cease rather through want of breath then of song
and the yoong little nightingals hearken to the olde and doe record by themselues apart the songs which they heard from point to point so that these disciples after they haue attentiuely hearkened doe repeat the lesson which they haue learned then cease
then may one heare the reprehensions of the schoolemaster and may very well discerne when the scholler is waxt cunning
moreouer the excellencie of their singing doth not commonly endure aboue fifteene daies and fifteene nights all which time they sing without ceasing and that is when the trees begin to waxe thick of leaues in
and afterwards this great melodie beginneth by little and little to cease and yet not so that one may perceiue them to be wearie of their singing
and when the heat begins to trouble them they whistle not as before but change their voice and sing a full note
they also mew and change feathers
to conclude they retire themselues in winter like all other wilde fowle

also finches and linnets are numbred amongst those little birds that sing verie harmoniously

and easily retaine that which is taught them whether it be in voice or by any demonstration that they may imitate either in foote or bill
but aboue all birds parrats do most counterfeit the voice and speech of man
they come from the indies and haue commonly their feathers greene except onely a coller of red vermilion feathers that compasseth their neck this bird speaketh all that which one will take paines to teach her
it loueth wine much and hauing well drunke is much pleasanter
there is likewise a kinde of pies which do pronounce better that which is taught them then the parrats doe yet are they not so much accounted of because they are ordinarie with vs
they take pleasure in the words which they speake and do so delight in them that one shall often finde them studying verie attentiuely by themselues that which hath beene shewed them
crowes also do easily learne to speake and shew manie

testimonies of great wit and industrie

there was one in the time of the emperor tyberius so admired and loued of the people of rome that they reuenged cruelly the death thereof vpon him that kilde it
it had been nourished by a shooemaker so taught and instructed that it flew euerie morning to the palace to salute the emperour and after him all the other princes naming them by their names and then returned to the shop to hir master continuing this vse for many yeeres to the great astonishment of euerie one
it happened that a certaine spitefull neighbour of this shooemaker taking occasion for that this crow had muted vpon some of his ware did kill it
whereat the people tooke such indignation that they caused this poore merchant to lose his life preparing on the other side verie magnificent funerals for the birde
for the carcasse thereof was couered ouer with nosegaies and chaplets of flowers and borne by two mores to the fire which was kindled in a voide place there to burne it solemnly so much was the vnderstanding of this crowe esteemed in a citie where many princes and great personages had died before and none woulde solemnize their funerals and wherein there was none that would reuenge the death of scipio africanus though he had conquered the carthaginians and numantines

but since we are lighted vpon a discourse concerning a kind of towardnesse and facilitie to learne which is founde in many birdes wee may not passe ouer in silence the marueilous industrie of their architecture in the building of their nests for all of them and especially the smal ones do vse a woonderfull dexteritie therein
and that may not be too tedious in this point will produce for testimonie but the swallowes onely who builde their nests of dirt or claie and strengthen them with strawe
and if perhaps the drines of the weather will not minister dirt enough for them then they load themselues with water which they shake vpon the ground to moisten the dust and to make slime
the inside of the nest is all couered and lined with downe and flockes both of wooll and of other things to the ende to keepe their egges warme and that their yoong ones may afterward finde their bedde soft
which they alwaies keepe verie cleane by casting very carefully out of it all the ordures of their little ones which being growne bigger they teach to mute out of the nest
there is another kind of field swallowes which do seldome

make their nests in houses yet they make them of such stuffe as the others do though not after the same manner for all their nests are turned vpside downe and haue a very streight mouth but a large paunch so that it is an admirable thing to see the industrie which they vse to keepe their yoong ones soft and warme
of the nests of these swallowes ioyned and fastned one vpon another there is a banke in the mouth of nilus which is neere to heraclia in egypt as pliny reciteth of sixe and twentie paces in length

and so strong that it resisteth the ragings and inundations of this floud a thing which one may say were impossible to be performed by the hand of man
but we shoulde finde writing matter enough to fill vp a great volume if we were minded to entreat of al the excellent properties which are in the nature of birdes but our intent is not to dwell long vpon this subiect as namely to speake of all their different species whereof many learned men haue written but onely to consider summarily of certaine of the most notable as wee will doe in regard of all other creatures both liuing and destitute of life to the end that we may nothing at all depriue any part of this vniuers which we do heere contemplate of those goodly portraitures of the diuine maiestie which are ingrauen in euery part from the highest heauen to the lowest center of this terrestriall masse
looke then amana what birds you hold most woorthie to haue place in your discourse

of the estridge of the peacocke of the cocke and of other foules
chap

amana

as we haue heeretofore heard of a birde that neuer abideth vpon the earth so contrariwise the estridge doth alwaies staie vpon the earth

neuer mounting aloft to take the aire
this is as bigge a birde as any other is common in africa in aethiopia
it hath a long necke like a camell the beake eies and head like to a goose but that they are much greater their wings taile haue feathers of diuers colours white red blacke and greene and there is no birde which hath such faire plumes of which those fethers are made wherewith men of warre adorne their helmets

the estridges passe horses in swiftnes being herein aided with the wings which nature hath bestowed vpon them although they fly not at al neither rise from the ground but run with their wings spread
they haue clouen feete like an hart with which men say they vse to take vp and cast stones at those which chase them when they flie
it is also said that they swallow and digest iron which commeth to passe through the vehement heat and thicknes of their belly
some also haue reported that the estridge hatcheth her egges with her eies but the truth is that she onely watcheth them because that her yoong ones are brought foorth by the heat of the sunne
the manner of taking this birde is verie easie for when he is wearie of running he is of so foolish a nature that he thinketh himselfe closely hidden when he is onely in the shade of some tree or shrub so that it is then easie to approch him so neere as the pursuer will desire

but let vs speake of the birde which for the beautie and sense which it hath doth merit the chiefe degree amongst the greater sort of birdes to wit the peacocke
for when he knowes that men esteeme him then turneth he round to shew his colours shining like pretious stones and sets them directly against the sun to giue them a better lustre
and he assayeth also to doe so with his taile spreading it round and shewing those colours which seeme fairest in the shade drawing all the eies thereof abroad as if he knew best how to make himselfe most noted
also when he hath lost his taile as he doth euery yeere at the fal of the leafe he hideth himself as if he mourned til the next spring when his taile groweth againe
it is maruellous that this part of the peacocke is so filled with eies being so long thick of feathers of sundrie colors so splenda~t yet neither the colour of white nor of black this being of it selfe sad and that obscuring all colours are found in the taile of this birde
which bird liueth ordinarily fiue and twentie yeeres and at three yeeres he beginneth to shoote the sundrie colours which he hath in his feathers and knoweth his beautie and seemeth to reioyce that men do maruell at his taile when they see it and therefore he will hold it vp be he neuer so wearie

next to the proude nature of the peacocke that loftie birde seemeth to resemble a sentinell which nature hath appointed to interrupt mens sleepe and call them to worke that is the cocke
for wheresoeuer he is he will be master and commaund all the

rest of the foules
and if there bee two togither then must this rule remaine to the strongest and he must get it by those weapons which nature hath placed in his legs wherein they put such trust that the issue of their combate doth oftentimes fall out with the death of the one or other
and he which remaineth victor makes signe of his conquest by his crowing sounding himselfe his owne tantaraes and the vanquished runnes and hides himselfe
this loftie bird marcheth proudly holding vp his neck stiffe and his combe aloft except he be not well
and there is no birde which doth oftner cast his eie towards heauen then this for he alwaies beholdeth it holding his taile vp and yet crooked like a sickle so that arming himselfe after this manner he puts the lion in feare which is the stoutest of all beasts
moreouer the cocke by a secret instinct of nature knoweth the course of the stars and diuideth the day by his crowing from three howers to three howers
they roust at sunne set and neuer let the sunne rise without aduertising men for with their crowing which is accompanied with beating of their wings they giue notice of the day
and their voice is heard very farre off yea in the night time a mile or more
the romanes honored so much the maiestie of this bird that they iudged of the good or euill lucke of their augurations by the countenance which he shewed being either pleasant or not at such time as he fed

hens are of the kinde of domesticall birds

renowmed aboue all for the delicatenes of their flesh and goodnes of their egges beeing much better then all other and which are most vsed in meates and medicines
they lay at all times except the two first moneths of winter when they commonly rest themselues so is it the first and last bird that layeth and is so fruitfull that there are some will lay sixtie egges together without missing one day
whereupon wee will note that in all yolkes of egges there is a little drop of bloud in the middest which is holden to be the heart of the bird because this member is esteemed to bee first formed in all liuing creatures
and indeed this little drop tasteth very salt and stirreth in the egge
and for that which particularly concerneth the chicken it is certaine that the bodie thereof is made of the white of the egge for being formed it is nourished by the yolke
and so long as it is in the shell it hath the head bigger then all the bodie and the eies which are shut bigger then the head
and when it beginneth to growe the white of the egge retireth

to the midst and the yolke disperseth it selfe round about and if at the twentith day one take the egge they may heare the chicken peepe within
for from that time forward it beginneth to waxe feathered and to get strength and staieth not long in consuming the whole yolke but presently beginneth to open the shell
and it is to be noted that as well this as all other foules come out of their shels with their feete forwardes contrarie to other liuing creatures
moreouer the hen is knowne to be good when hir crest is straight and sometimes double and hir feathers blacke and in some places red as also when the clawes of her foote are faire
but aboue all there is nothing more woorthie of great admiration then the care which it taketh to hatch and nourish hir chickens yea though they be not of hir owne kinde
and it is a pretie pastime to make an hen hatch for at first when they open the shell she knoweth them not and neuertheles hauing beene a little accustomed to them she doth nourish them as carefully as if they were naturally her owne
and when these yoong duckes according to their kinde cast themselues into the water it is a woonder to see the mourning of the hen fearing least ill should betide them

the pigeon likewise is an much to be considered of and bringeth no lesse profit and commoditie then pullen doe
it is very chaste by nature and neuer changeth mate neither cocke nor hen and yet the cocks are very rude towards the hens beating them with their bils and chiding them with a kinde of grumbling in their throat as if they were iealous but afterwards as if they repented themselues they make much of them and bill togither running round about them and specially when their time of treading is come
both cocke and hen take great paines to hatch their yoong ones insomuch that when the hens are idle and tarie not in the nest the cockes will correct and beate them with their beakes
but they doe likewise aide them as well helping them to make their nests as to serue them while they hatch yea and the cocke doth sometimes hatch in the
it is their propertie to bill togither before they tread
and they lay ordinarily two egges out of which issue both cocke and hen that is the cocke first and the hen the morrow after
they hatch commonly eighteene or twentie daies and breede after fiue times treading
and one shall sometimes finde egges with little pigeons in them and shall see in one nest some yoong ones but newly

first then let vs speake of the earth and of the firmenes figure and quantitie thereof

of the earth and of the scituation immobility figure and quality thereof
chapter

aram

as wee haue heretofore heard that vnder the name of heauen is comprised commonly both the supreme and middle region of the aire and all things also which are conioined vnto them and depending vpon their effects namely of the two higher elements the fire the aire so by the name of earth wee do often vnderstand not onely the lowest element of all which is as the foot of all this mundane frame but also the sea which is next to it and the lakes ponds fountaines riuers and other waters and all that is contained in them and in the earth and which receiueth life and nourishment whether they be men beasts of all kindes plants trees hearbs fruits mettals mines minerals stones and generally all

other things produced here below for the vse of all other creatures
pursuing then the order of our discourse wee will first intreate of that which concernes in generall the terrestriall globe and afterwards will meditate of the most rare beawties which enrich the partes thereof to the end to represent vnto our selues more and more the greatnes and glorie of the creator of all these things as we haue already well begun in the matters by vs hitherto intreated of

now it is certaine that by reason of the waight and heauines of the earth it is necessarily situated in the midst of the world as the center thereof being the lowest place and the farthest remote from the circumference of the whole
and from which the earth cannot be parted for otherwise it should mount aloft contrarie to the naturall inclination thereof as likewise it cannot be mooued by the first and vniuersall motion of all the spheres by reason of the foresaid heauines thereof and subtilitie of the other elements which are about it and againe bicause it is of insensible quantitie in respect of the whole world as being the point and center thereof being also vnmooueable to the end that the motion of the heauens might thereby bee discerned and that which dependeth thereupon

and as the seate of the elementarie fire doth not extend beyond the fire and as that of the water is in the place of water and that of the aire where the aire should be so the earth can retaine no place but in it selfe bicause that the other elements cannot suffer it to rest vpon them
which causeth that it remaineth hanged amongst them not being able to fall nor decline more towards one place then another
wherfore also it is made habitable in euery part except it be by accident

so that men are therefore antipodes one to another that is going feete against feete hauing neuertheles all of them their heads towards heauen and meeting each of them in the midst of the earth
now that it is iustly situate in the midst of the vniuers one may see by experience of the daies and nights which are equall throughout the whole earth so often as the sunne is in the midst of heauen betwixt the poles of the worlde as also by the augmentations and diminutions of the same daies and nights regularly proportioned one to another as we haue demo~strated in our precedent discourses vpon the celestiall spheres and likewise by the eclipses of the moone by the inclination of shadowes which at noontide are one proportionable to another

as well on the meridionall as on the septentrionall part

moreouer there is no doubt but the earth togither with the whole element of water which is spread abroad and dispersed in diuers armes and portions about it is of a round and circular figure in all parts for as for the mountaines valleies they are insensible in regard of the whole globe of earth
the roundnes whereof doth euidently declare it selfe by the shadow thereof which sheweth it selfe in the eclipses of the moone to be round for it could not seeme so if the earth were not also of the same forme
moreouer the diuers and certaine supputation that astronomers calculate concerning the times of the eclipses of the moone according as the places are more orientall or more occidentall doth manifestly conclude the same round forme so also doth the natural inclination of all the parts of the earth and of the water who stil tend downe declining to a lower place and this common descent of euerie part causeth this round figure

consequently it is to be noted that this earthly frame although it be in it selfe of maruellous greatnes yet is it of verie little and insensible quantitie in regard and comparison not onely of all the firmament but also of the sphere of the sunne the same earth being but as a point in the middest of the whole world which is apparantly demonstrated by the foresaid equalities of the daies and nights and by the obseruations of the courses of the celestiall bodies and chiefly of the sunne taken here below by instruments fit for such effects in such maner as if one were in the center of the world
for in a little space that one may passe here vpon the earth proceeding from one place to another the view and disposition of heauen doth change and varie notably
and in an open plaine place wherein one may stand vpon the earth or be in the sea they may alwaies discouer the one halfe of heauen
all which things declare as we haue said that the earth and the water make a round globe which is but as a point and center in regard of the vniuersall world

so much for the situation immobilitie figure

and quantitie of the earth which onely aboue all other elements hath merited the title of a mother by reason of the great good which it affoordeth to all breathing liuing creatures
for this gentle mother receiueth vs when we are borne shee nourisheth vs being borne she maintaineth and sustaineth vs being nourished and finally when the other elements refuse and leaue vs she receiueth

vs into her bosome and couereth vs hauing as it were a perpetuall care of vs moreouer she riseth not vp against man as other creatures doe
for the water conuerts it selfe into raine snowe and haile it swelleth in surges and waues and ouerfloweth all with flouds the aire thickeneth and ladeth it selfe with cloudes out of which proceede stormes and tempests and the fire is often cause of strange calamities vpon earth but this gentle and debonaire mother maketh hir selfe as a slaue to serue for all the commodities of man
for how many things doe we cause hir to beare by force and how many things doth she bestowe of hir owne goodwill what odours and perfumes what sauours what iuices what and how many sorts of colours with what exchaunge and interest doth shee restore that which is lent hir how many sundry things doth shee nourish for man what quantitie of pretious mettals doth shee conceiue and keepe in hir entrailes for his vse

and therefore it seemeth that the earth subsisteth not of one onely kinde and indeede aristotle diuideth it into two the one fossible which may bee digged and the other transmutable which may change qualitie
for the fossible earth it doth alwaies remaine the same and is very earth but the transmutable remaineth not the same in kinde and in view for it conuerteth it selfe into mettall or into iuice or into some other matter
but before wee doe proceede vnto the consideration of so many admirable effectes produced by the earth wee may now here beholde that we haue summarily set downe particulars enough wherin we may learne to acknowledge the infinite power wisedome and bountie of god the creator

and how according to the testimonie of the angels all the earth is full of his glorie
for first of all is not this a great woonder that the earth which is so huge a masse and the heauiest element of all the rest should be hanged in the aire in the midst of the world being so counterpoised that it sustaineth as one may say all the other elements and that it is inuironed by them and by all the other spheres and celestiall bodies it remaining firme for euer not moouing from the place thereof for where are the columnes and the pillers which beare and sustaine it and vpon what foundation are they founded and therefore it is not without cause

that the lord saith to iob minding to cause him to acknowledge his power maiestie where wast thou when laide the foundations of the earth declare if

thou hast vnderstanding who hath laide the measure thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line ouer it to wit to signe and marke out the foundations thereof whereupon are the foundations thereof set or who hath laid the corner stone thereof and afterwards he addeth it is turned as clay to fashion
wherein it seemeth that he had reference to that that he created the earth as all this great visible world in round forme because it is the most capable of all formes that may be
behold then the testimonie that god himselfe deliuereth to iob his seruant of the admirable creation of the earth

and to the same purpose the kingly prophet saith that god did forme the earth vpon the bases therof that is to say vpon firme foundations so that it shall neuer mooue
but what may we say then to the motions and tremblings of the earth which haue euer been knowne and are ordinarily seene this might seeme repugnant to that which dauid here speaketh and to that which we haue deliuered concerning the immobilitie and firmenes of the earth
and therefore mine aduise is that pursuing this discourse we should consider the causes of such tremblings to the end that we may know how that the earth faileth not to remaine euer firme though such shakings happen in some parts thereof which achitob let vs heare of you

forasmuch as the earth is not onely heauie by nature but euen the heauiest of all elements and is heaped vp and compacted togither in the midst of the great vniuersall world as the point and center thereof it therefore followeth that it is immooueable and without any naturall motion
for if it had any as the other elements haue it is certaine that it must be downwards
but bicause that god hath placed the earth in the midst of all his works towards which all heauy things tende and descende it cannot descende lower then it is by the nature thereof
and therefore bicause it is solide and thicke and not liquide and fluent as the water and the aire it cannot glide as they doe nor remooue out of one place into another if it be not by some violence elsewhere mooued

and made to stirre and tremble somewhere as it hath happened through diuers and maruellous earthquakes of which histories and the holy scripture it selfe doe giue euidence
we must note then that there are diuers sortes of motions by which the earth is so shaken that it lifteth and casteth some parts sometimes vpwardes sometimes downewards

and it is long of such motions and tremblings that there haue such masses and heapes beene cast out of it that great isles haue beene newly made as geographers doe witnesse namely the isle of rhodes and of selos
it sometimes also happeneth that the motions of the earth bee such that it openeth like a great gulph whereinto some parts thereof are cleane swallowed vp and deuoured togither with the countries and townes scituate therein so that there hath beene no marke left of them no more then as if they had neuer beene
and it hath often hapned in such cases that some mountaines haue fallen one against another bicause the earth which was betwixt them hath sunck and beene swallowed cleane vp
and then one might say that the prouerb is not euer true which saith that two mountaines neuer meet
there is yet another kinde of motion wherein the earth mooueth and shaketh sometimes one way sometimes another way and tottereth like a ship that floateth on the water
which kinde of trembling is most dangerous as also when all the motion runneth one way
then is there yet another motion which philosophers properly call trembling to wit when two motions are opposite one to another as if two rammes should rush one against another
and this is least daungerous of all although indeede they bee all very fearefull yet the feare is much greater when the tremblings continue with horrible and fearefull sounds like the bellowing of buls and as if the earth and all nature quaked and groaned beeing sore pressed and forced as is oftentimes seene

now for the causes of all these kindes of earthquakes may well say that there is no point in all naturall philosophie wherein the professors of this science finde themselues more intricately intangled nor wherein they more differ in opinions then in this
for the chaldeans and astronomers referre the causes of motions and earthquakes to the heauen to the starres and to the planets and many philosophers assigne it to the water and yet those which are of this opinion differ amongst themselues
for some suppose that the earth floateth vpon the water like a ship

bicause it is enuironed with water according to the naturall order of the disposition of the elements whereby it is diuersly mooued
others doe attribute the cause of earthquakes to those waters onely which are inclosed within the vaines and caues of the earth
some also to the fire and some to the windes shut vp within it and some to the heate chased by the colde which striueth against it and causeth it to search an issue out
for as the water vndermineth the earth and those places through which it doth passe euen so may the fire doe and if either of them be so inclosed that they cannot finde an easie issue they striue then to doe it by force and violence
so doe the windes and the heate chased by the cold
so then if the earth be vndermined it is no maruell if the vpper part sinke and fall downe being swallowed vp as into a gulfe considering that the earth bicause of the heauines thereof tendeth alwaies downward towardes the center thereof which is the midst of it and of all the worlde
and if the waters or the fire or the windes inclosed and shut vp in the earth or the contrarie qualities which contend one with another cannot finde a passage or issue their power is so great that they constraine the earth which resisteth them and by forcing it make it to cleaue and open and to remooue and to shake in those places wherein it is forced concerning all which things one may make a neere coniecture

by the force and violence which is seene in ordinance and artillerie
for euery one beholdeth what force there is by meanes of fire and of the matter inclosed within to wit powder and of the contrarie qualities wherof it is compounded and of the winde that therein is ingendred not onely to driue out with maruellous violence all the charge that therein is but also many times to burst the peece it selfe if there be any resistance to hinder it that it discharge not quickly or if it be not well made and very strong and well proportioned to the charge
we behold also what a winde there issueth out and what noise it maketh and how the noise makes the earth to sound and tremble and oftentimes it happeneth that this onely winde killeth those that stand neere the cannons mouth such is the violence thereof although they be not touched at all with the bullet that it shooteth
but wee beholde more cleerely in mines which are made vnder ground the violence of this powder when it is therein inclosed with the fire which is set thereto by traines
for there is neither towne nor castle be they neuer so

well founded nor any fortresse which is not onely shaken but ouerturned also like as by an horrible
wherein we may note how that it hath not beene sufficient for men to counterfeit thunders and lightnings in artillerie but they haue also inuented the meanes to represent the motions and shakings of the earth in such manner as we haue signified
there are some philosophers also

who haue taught that the same reason is in earthquakes as there is in the shaking of mens bodies and that they are like feuers and maladies of the earth which come vnto it through diuers causes saue that they hold not all the bodie thereof as they doe in men but onely some partes of it
for they argue that the water is in the earth as the blood which hath his course through the vaines of mans bodie and the winde is as the vitall spirits which passe through the arteries thereof
and as there happen diuers stoppings in the bodie which hinder the blood and vitall spirits that they cannot keepe their right course and ordinarie passage whereupon their order is troubled and the bodie pained in such sort that grones ensue and difficultie of breathing shakings and such like accidents so is it with the bodie of the earth when any thing happens to it contrarie to the naturall disposition thereof by the meanes which we haue already heard whether by water by fire by winde and such like
whereto we will adde also this opinion of those who attribute the cause of such motions and tremblings either to the drinesse of the earth which is the occasion that it cleaueth and chappeth and by this meanes giues open way to the aire and to the windes which penetrate thereinto or else bicause of the older age thereof to which they esteeme all creatures subiect whereupon it happeneth to it as to old buildings which being ruinous and almost rotten doe fall downe in some places of themselues

these are the diuers opinions of men vpon this matter wherin if we desire to take a very short and sure way to attaine to the true cause wee must referre it to the wrath and iudgements of god bicause that what causes soeuer the learned can inuent the eternall sheweth himselfe very powerful

and to be feared therein considering that he hath disposed all of them and that they all depend vpon him alone
and surely this is a worke of the omnipotent woorthie to be woondred at and which may well cause men to mooue and tremble before his maiestie
for if he shewe himselfe terrible and fearefull by deluges of water by haile thunder

lightning stormes and tempests he doth no lesse by the motions and shakings of the earth which are in regarde thereof as thunders are in the aire
for seeing that the earth is as the foot of the world and that it is assigned to men for their habitation whither is it that they may haue recourse if it quake vnder them and faile to sustaine them whither shall they retire if she will allow them no more dwelling in hir but will spue them out as the scripture saith for if it be hard for them to flie before fire

and before water and to finde harbour against windes thunders and tempests whither shall they flie if the earth will not receiue nor beare them and what dread may inuade them when sometimes it quaketh in such sort that it openeth and is swallowed vp as into a bottomlesse pitte as it came to passe when it swallowed corah dathan and abiram and their families

who will not bee astonished when it riseth vp ouerturning all euen the highest mountaines and hardest rockes and mooueth it selfe in such sort that it maketh houses and buildings dance like rammes and sheepe that would one butte at another wherewith many are vtterly destroied

as it happened in the yeere
in the realme of portugall which was so shaken by an that at lisbone the chiefe citie thereof there were ouerthrown almost twelue hundred houses besides a great number of others which were greatly spoiled
this horrible earthquake continued the space of eight daies and gaue verie furious assaults fiue or sixe times a day
and in the time of the emperour tiberius twelue cities in asia were quite ruinated in one night by an
and iosephus recordeth that by another

thirtie thousand iewes died
so iustine recounteth that by another many cities were destroyed an hundred and seuentie thousand persons perished in the raigne of tigranes in armenia
what causes then soeuer there may be in nature of so many terrible euents yet we must alwaies haue recourse to the author and gouernour thereof without whom it can performe nothing and he it is

that bringeth out of his treasures as he doth the winds either by his commaundement without a meanes or by his ministers ordayned thereto or else by some power infused into things the which may according to his good pleasure display it selfe in effect to denounce his iudgments on men
for he it is of whom the prophet speaketh
the earth trembled and shaked and the foundations of the mountaines

were mooued and quaked

and the foundations of heauen were bowed and trembled because he was angrie
wherefore wee may verie well conclude

that as god declareth his magnificence and woonderfull glorie in heauen which is assigned to bee his seat as his word teacheth vs and as we haue heretofore amply discoursed so likewise he doth manifest it no lesse in the earth which is his footstoole when he causeth it to shake and remooue as if being supprised with some great strong feuer it shooke trembled before him

and therefore iob also saith the eternall is wise in heart and mightie in strength who hath beene fierce against him and hath prospered he remooueth mountaines and they feele not when he ouerthroweth them in his wrath
he remooueth the earth out of her place that the pillers thereof do shake

the pillers of heauen tremble and quake at his reproofe
but now let vs note that all that which we haue here deliuered disprooueth not the earth to remaine alwaies firme immooueable in it selfe in so much as it mooueth not out of the place which was appointed to it by god neither doth it swerue neuer so little considering that the moouings and tremblings are not vniuersall but particular onely in some places in such sort that the foundations thereof are not any whit altered
and if we consider well of these things the earth will serue no lesse for a preacher vnto vs then the aire and the fire yea then all heauen to denounce vnto vs the soueraigne maiestie of the almightie ruling aboue all his workes as hope to morrow we may haue goodly testimonies entreating of the water which is dispersed throughout the earth and afterwards speaking of the excellent commodities and pretious riches that these two elements doe yeeld to men into which matter you aser shall enter with your dicourse

the end of the seuenth day

the eight daies worke
of the sea and of the waters and of the diuision and distribution of them throughout the earth
chap

aser

the holy scripture doth certifie vs how that in the beginning the earth was couered ouer with water and that it appeered not in any sort but onely vnder the forme of a great deepe till such time as god commaunded the waters to retire into the channels and places which hee had prepared for their aboade
so that then the earth was discouered euen so much therof as was needfull for the habitation and nourishment of men and beasts
but this soueraigne creator of the vniuers would not haue the waters to be gathered all into one place and not to haue their course through the earth but prouiding for euerie commoditie for his creatures he ordained that out of the great ocean sea which is as the great bodie of the waters there should issue diuers armes and members by meanes whereof we haue the mediterran seas out of which againe proceed many other waters as lakes flouds riuers and brookes
for although that all these waters seeme to haue their springing out of certaine fountaines which many affirme to be made of the aire yet the verie truth is that their chiefe source is out of the sea which as it is named in iob is as the wombe out of which all waters both celestiall and terrestriall haue their first originall and do engender repaire themselues continually by the meanes that we haue alreadie heard

now according to the opinion of the philosophers all reason teacheth vs that this ordinance in nature concerning the distribution of the waters throughout the earth hath beene made of necessitie for the mutuall maintenance of these two elements for so much as the earth being naturally drie cannot subsist without moisture

and contrariwise the flowing water could not haue ought to stay vpon without being propped vp by the earth
wherfore it was necessarie that the earth should giue it place and that it should open all her vaines and conduicts that the water might passe through the same both within vpon it yea and to pierce euen to the highest mountaine tops in which place being pressed with the waight of the earth and also in some place mooued by the aire which driueth it one shall see it issue out in great vehemencie euen as if it were squirted out

whosoeuer then will consider of the whole circuit of the earth shall learne that the moitie of the roundnes thereof is enuironed by the sea which floweth round about it causing the waues thereof to goe and come continually sometimes aloft and sometimes verie low like as if this terrene globe were a bowle cast into the water one part whereof should lye discouered out of it

and the other couered within it which water the philosophers hold to be entirely round hauing the open heauen in euerie part ouer it
and this is confirmed by those drops of water which fall vpon the ground or vpon leaues of trees and of herbs which are round
if also one fill a vessell of water they may euidently behold that the water riseth and swelleth in the middest making a kinde of round forme
in truth by reason that the water is subtile and soft these things are far better comprehended by arguments and concluding reasons wherewith the bookes of the learned are replenished then by the view of the eie
notwithstanding this is verie admirable that if one put neuer so little water into a vessell alreadie the vppermost part thereof will shedde ouer and yet if one cast into the same so vessell some heauy thing yea to the waight of twenty pence the water will not spill therefore but will swell onely till such time as it stand much aboue the brimme of the vessell by the rising thereof
moreouer the roundenesse of the water which causeth this doth also make that those which are in the top of a ship do sooner discouer land then those which are in the foredeck or in the sterne thereof so likewise if any shining thing bee fastned to the top of the mast at parting from the port it seemeth that the vessell still goeth downewards till at length the sight of hir will be cleane lost
moreouer how should it bee possible that the ocean sea which enuironeth the earth as being the and the receptacle of all the rest doth not

run abroad considering there is no banck to it if it were not of round forme wherein this is to bee noted that the water of the sea doth in no sort ouerpasse the limits thereof nor doth euer runne but toward the place of the naturall scituation thereof

of which the greeke philosophers haue rendred an especiall reason by geometricall propositions and conclusions making demonstration that this water cannot run otherwise what roome or scope soeuer it haue
for they say that considering the nature of water is to fall alwaies downeward and that also the sea stretcheth it selfe out so far as it can neuerthelesse according as the declining of the sea can suffer as euery one may see with his eie and by how much the lower it is by so much the more it doth approch to the center of the earth whereupon ensueth that all lynes drawne from that center to the waters neerest to it are shorter then those lines which are drawne from the vppermost waters to the extremity of the sea so that by that meanes the water of the sea doth alwaies decline towards the center from whence it can in no sort fall but doth there retaine it selfe

surely if wee doe neerely consider this maruellous worke of god the sea and waters we shall therein finde goodly mirrors wherein to contemplate his maiestie and greatnes

according as he saith to his seruant iob who hath shut vp the sea with doores when it issued and came foorth as out of the wombe when made the cloudes as a couering thereof and darknes as the swadling bands thereof when established my commandement vpon it and set barres and doores and said hitherto shalt thou come but no farther and here shalt thou stay thy proud waues
the like is also taught by the psalmist saying

hee gathereth the waters of the sea together as vpon an heape and layeth vppe the depths in his treasures
which is as much as if hee should say god holdeth backe the waters as with a bridle that they may not ouerrunne and couer the earth
wherein we are moreouer to note that the holy ghost speaketh concerning the sea in this text of iob and in many other places of scripture as if it had some sense and vnderstanding and that god had caused it to heare his voice and had commanded it as he commandeth men to obey his ordinance although it be a senselesse creature and without life but this is to the end that we may better learne to acknowledge the

power prouidence of god ouer all his works
for the sea is not onely deafe and depriued of all sense and much more without vnderstanding but also exceeding furious and outragious being mooued by force of windes and tempests in such sort that it often seemeth as if it would ouerrun and swallow vp all the earth with the waues thereof and would rise with the flouds thereof and mount vp to heauen
for one may behold how at one time the waues will swell and rise vp like high mountaines and suddenly after wil tumble couch downe like vallies as if the sea would cleaue and diuide it selfe and so discouer the deepe bottome thereof

and therefore the kingly prophet hauing diuinely described all things togither with the power that the soueraigne creator hath to raise and to appease such tempests hee exhorteth all men to acknowledge this infinite power of the eternall and those great works and woonders which he declareth in the sea and to haue recourse for their deliuerance out of all dangers to the creator and true lord of the waters and of the windes and of all nature
but yet wee must heere consider the obedience that the sea sheweth euen in the greatest furies therof to the commandement which god hath deliuered to it from the first creation thereof
for although it be often mooued as we said yet doth it containe it selfe shut vp within the boundes which were appointed vnto it by the ordinance of god as if it were afraide to run out and durst not passe farther as hauing heard and vnderstood that which the creator thereof had commanded and had engrauen it in memorie for euer
and therefore we may see that after it hath swollen risen aloft in waues and that it hath menaced the earth as if it would ouerflowe it and couer it againe with the deepe as at the beginning it is neuerthles arrested and beaten backe to returne into the proper gulfes thereof which are assigned for it to lodge in euen by a very little sand onely
for what is the sea shore but sand onely which is a kinde of loose earth like the dust and is easily driuen with the winde and yet the word of god which hath giuen commandement to the sea which is so horrible and fearefull a creature being mooued is of such power that this small sand is sufficient to make it keepe within the confines and limits thereof and to breake the furious waues thereof as if he who hath established this ordinance in nature stood in presence vpon the shore side to command it to doe so and that for feare and reuerence

of him it returned to hide it selfe in the deepe how much more then should his word and voice mooue the harts of men breaking cleauing and pearsing them thorough if they were not harder then stones and rocks and more senselesse then the waters for this cause the lord saith by esaie

and to whome shall haue respect but to him that is afflicted and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my words and ieremie shewing to the people of israel the malice and rebellion which was in them

against the lord their god doth giue them the sea for a patterne and referreth them to learne to obey their creator after the example thereof
let vs learne then that the sea and other waters do not their bounds and limits but when it pleaseth god that they should ouerflow to chastice men by deluges and flouds as it oftentimes commeth to passe through his iust iudgement
but it shalbee your office achitob to speake of this point discoursing vpon the ebbing and flowing of the sea whereupon me thinkes the order of our speech doth require that wee should entreat

of the flowing and ebbing of the sea and of the power that the moone hath ouer it and ouer all other inferior bodies
chap

amana

if wee do not refer all things to the heauenly disposition of him who hath framed and compassed all with his hand and doth gouerne all by his prudence and sustaineth all with his power it will be very difficult yea impossible for vs to declare the causes and reasons of his works in an humane discourse which are of such authority that they may put a good spirit out of all scruple and doubt yea euen in the subiect which wee intend now to entreat of to wit the flowing and ebbing of the sea
the searching out of which secret did so trouble a certaine great philosopher some say aristotle that beeing vpon the shore of euboea now called negropont onely to search out and to behold the naturall cause thereof and not beeing able to enforme himselfe sufficiently therein it did so vex him that chafing at nature himselfe and against the water he cast himselfe into the sea saying to it sith cannot comprehend thee

yet shalt thou haue the honor to comprehend mee and keepe mee within thy gulfs and indeed he was heere swallowed by the deepe
and certes this ordinary ebbing and flowing of the ocean according to which it goeth commeth spreadeth it selfe abroade and then doth euery day retire without euer fayling in the order thereof must needes be a most wonderfull thing
and that which is most admirable therein is that the flowing and ebbing thereof doe follow the course of the moone

to which planet likewise is attributed with most apparant reason the cause of this flowing and ebbing she beeing as the regent of the seas and waters by the appointment of the soueraigne creator as is seene by experience and by the agreeablenes of nature which they haue togither
for wee must note that as the moone encreaseth or waineth so is it with the state of the flowing of the sea and therefore although that it happen diuersly yet the principall cause of the motion thereof resideth in his planet
for betweene the two times that she riseth which is in fower and twenty howers wherein she compasseth the whole earth the sea doth twise flow doth as ofte~times ebbe
and when the moone beginneth to mount in the east then doth the floud rise and the sea swell till such time as this planet doth attaine to our right meridian which is in the and that it begin to decline towardes the west at which time the water ebbeth
yet neuertheles all those six howers wherein the moone maketh hir course towards the line of opposite to our the floud returneth and increaseth till after it hath passed that line and then it doth ebbe againe till such time as the said regent thereof the moone returne againe aboue our horizon
it is most certaine that the floud doth neuer returne iust at that very hower and instant wherein it flowed the day before
but this doth proceede likewise from the course of the moone which seruing for these base and inferiour things and not rising euery day at one selfesame instant she doth draw the course of the sea with hir in such sort that the tide is more late and of shorter continuance at one time then at another and yet doth not the distance of time betweene the tides change one whit for it endureth six howers in ebbe and so long time in flowing
but here we meane not all manner of howers as our common howers are according to the different situation of places but we meane equall and equinoctial howers by consideration whereof the ebbing and flowing of the sea will

be found alwaies of like time as is abouesaide
moreouer from seuen daies to seuen daies the flowing is found different by the same power of the moone for it is but very small the first quarter thereof and till it be halfe round
in the second quarter it alwaies encreaseth till at which time the sea is at hir greatest height
from thence forward the floud decreaseth so that the third quarter it is in the same state wherein it was the first quarter
neuerthelesse when the waining moone is halfe round the floud beginneth to rise
but when she is in coniunction with the sunne the tide riseth as high as at full moone
and when the moone is high and septentrionall the tide is not so vehement as when she is meridionall bicause that being then more neere to the earth she doth the more exercise hir power

but many haue indeuoured in this matter to vnderstand

why the flowings of the ocean sea doe reach farther then those of the other mediterranean seas wherein the ebbings and flowings doe not appeere as in the ocean
which may be said to proceed because that a thing which is entire hath more power then any part which is separated
also the high sea retayneth in it selfe more of the power of the moone which worketh vpon it at ease and pleasure beyond all comparison more forcibly then vpon other seas which are narrower and minister lesse meanes to this planet to exercise her rule therein
from whence it commeth to passe that lakes and riuers do neuer flow
and for the mediterranean seas they are enclosed about with the earth as in an hauen though there bee some places or some armes of the same seas verie broad
some likewise are verie much subiect to the moone as the adriaticke gulfe wherein venice is builded which ebbeth and floweth twise euerie day like the ocean
and it is to bee noted that such motions are better perceiued on the shore and then in the midst thereof euen as the pulse of the arteries is better knowne in the extremes of the bodie then in the bulk thereof

some also do render this cause of the flowing and ebbing of the sea to wit that though the waters thereof be salt yet were not this sufficient for their conseruation no more then of their neighbor the aire if they had not a continuall motion
for we see that doth presently corrupt beeing in a vessel and not mooued
many also haue noted that in euery reuolution or course of the moone the tyde resteth for three daies long to wit the

and
day thereof

and that when shee is at full all seas do purge themselues by scummes
certainely it is woondrous to see what power this planet hath not onely ouer the waters but also ouer the earth and ouer all liuing creatures

which hath ministred occasion to many philosophers to suppose that the moone was that which nourisheth the earth and that also by hir inconstant course approching diuers waies to the inferior bodies shee produced diuers effects sometimes replenishing them and sometimes leauing them void empty
whereof it commeth that all fishes hauing scales and shels do encrease and decrease according to the course of the moone and that all liuing creatures also which haue bloud do feele themselues refreshed when shee renueth
it is likewise supposed that the bloud augmenteth or diminisheth in man according as the moone encreaseth or waineth yea that herbes and trees do partake of hir power
aristotle also doth note that those creatures which are readie to die do die onely when the sea ebbeth
but in this matter as in all things which do concerne the ebbing and flowing of the ocean wee must euer haue recourse to the ordinance that the eternall father of the vniuers hath established in all his creatures according to which they perseuer in obedience to their creator without transgressing one title of his lawes as wee haue a notable example in the sea and in the waters which containe themselues in such admirable sort as in our former speech is declared within their bounds and limits

and if at any time they ouerflowe as whilome happened in holland where the water brake through the dams and banks wherewith the countrie is bounded swallowing vp the with an incredible losse of men and riches as also at the same time tiber did so ouerflowe at rome that it rose in the fields the height of a lance ruinating in fower and twenty howers many bridges and stately edifices the endommagement whereof comprising therein the mooueable goodes lost was esteemed to amount to the value of three millions of golde there being aboue three thousand persons choaked and drowned
such deluges say doe not come to passe what natural causes soeuer the learned force themselues to render without the expresse command and ordinance of god who will after this sort vse the water to take vengeance vpon those whom he pleaseth to wash from off the face of the earth as being vnwoorthie to dwell longer thereupon
and so he himselfe

hath prophesied vnto vs saying

there shall bee signes in the sunne and in the moone and in the starres and vpon the earth trouble among the nations with perplexitie the sea and waters shall roare
adding afterwards for the powers of heauen shall be shaken
moreouer we may say that although the celestiall bodies haue no more life sense and vnderstanding then the earth and the sea yet neuertheles they haue as it were a secret feeling by nature of the maiestie of god their creator who causeth them to rise vp against men for their rebellion and wickednes
surely when we see them rise and stand vp against men to worke them euill in stead of doing them good contrarie to the end of their first creation we must consider of them as if they enuied and denied to serue men any more which turne disloyall ingratefull and peruerse towards him from whom their totall good proceedeth as the sunne did witnes when it waxed darke at the death of our redeemer depriuing those of his light which were risen vp against the eternal sonne of god that had created them
for it is certaine that the creatures do grone and trauell altogither as the scripture saith till such time as iesus christ shall come in iudgement

which is the day of the restitution and restoring of all things foretold by the prophets
and which day being neere it is no maruell if god doe daily shew his particular iudgements vpon men to put them in minde of this generall and vniuersall iudgement whereto heauen earth the sea and all creatures shall come togither and therefore also he giueth them so many signes of his wrath by thunders tempests deluges and inundations of water as we haue made mention
but let vs proceed to contemplate his other works and great woonders which abound euery where both in the earth and in the sea in other terrestriall waters by which very many commodities do redound to men thorough the prouidence of god
and first we will speake of the diuersitie of waters
which aram would haue you to discourse of

of salt fresh and warme waters and of other diuersities in them
chapter

aram

according to the nature of the most woonderfull workes of god in all that which he hath created the maruels are innumerable which may be considered

in the sea and in all the waters which proceede out of it and returne into it without any increasing or diminishing in it selfe as we haue already heard
and if there were no other thing but that the waters of the sea are alwaies salt and other waters are for the most part fresh would not that be sufficient to teach vs to acknowledge the great power wisedome and bountie of the creator and how puissant he is in all his workes for though that all waters are of one nature as making vp one onely element yet doth he make them of diuers qualities according as he knoweth how to purifie distill and purge or else to mingle and them

with his other creatures
whereupon it falleth out that wee haue not onely salt waters in the sea but that there are some found also in fountaines yea oftentimes very neere to other springs of fresh water wherein the prouidence of god declareth it selfe to bee verie great
for if all waters were salt men and beasts could not liue nor the earth fructifie and nourish the fruits thereof because that liuing creatures cannot want fresh water whether it be for their drinke or for their other necessary commodities neither is salt water fit to water the earth considering that salt makes it barren
on the other side if all waters were fresh where might men finde salt enough to suffice them for the necessarie commodities of their life for although that there bee some and some as appeareth by the salt waters of fountaines which passe through such grounds yet the best meanes to haue good salt and in abundance is by the waters and chiefly by sea water
what may we say also of so many sorts of water whereof some participate with sulphure some with allom others with iron or brasse or with other mettals or minerals which do heat some of them in such sort as men make naturall bathes of them hauing diuers vertues and powers which serue for medicines in many kindes of diseases

now the philosophers doe much straine themselues to declare the causes of so many maruellous effects
for some say that the sunne which is the greatest of all planets drying vp by his heat the moisture of the water and burning and sucking vp all the humiditie of the earth doth by this decoction cause the sea to become salt because the force of the solarie fire doth attract vnto it the most fresh and subtile part of the water making the more heauie and thicke part that remaineth to be salter and of

more substance whereof it commeth that the water towards the sea bottome is fresher then that which is aboue
others alleage three efficients which both cause and continue the saltnes to wit the heat of the sunne for the foresaid reasons and also because it maketh the water to putrifie then the continuall agitation thereof by flowing and ebbing which causeth that the sea neither resteth nor runneth a direct course and thirdly the ordinarie receiuing of raine
for they say that when salt resteth in the water it descendeth downewards by reason of the waight thereof and when the water runneth it is purified by the earth and that all because it is heated by the sunne and doth putrifie through tardation and slownes is somewhat brackish
but they are much more troubled when they entreat of fountaines
for some say that the sea yeeldeth none but as is seene by many waters neere it and that those which are fresh become so by a long and vehement course
others maintaine that they be engendred by the aire
now experience manifesteth that their saltnes is diminished by the length and continuance of the course of the water
for the farther that wels are from the sea the more fresh they are because the water doth more purge it selfe by the earth ouer which it trauerseth leauing a part of the force thereof and sometimes all of it in the slime and in the sand
and here we may note that waters

especially well waters which doe all come from some springs doe seeme to be hotter in winter then in sommer although they doe neuer chaunge their nature for this proceedeth of the aire which is cold in winter and hot in sommer
through the opposition then of these things one selfe same water seemeth to receiue diuers qualities euen as we see that according to the disposition of our bodie the qualitie of the aire which enuironeth vs is esteemed
for when we are hot we do suppose that which we touch to be cold and when we be cold we esteeme that which we touch to be otherwise
wherefore we must iudge euen so of the inner parts of the earth esteeming them to be simply neither hotter nor colder in one season more then in another but onely in respect of the aire
indeed water doth waxe a little warme when through the coldnes of the aire the heat is constrained to retire it selfe downeward in such sort as it cannot issue nor spred it selfe vpon the earth and therefore the snow which doth not ly long vpon it doth commonly make it more fertile

for it retayneth the heat in the bowels thereof
moreouer the vppermost part of the earth which the water may come to is of a clammie slime of the nature of brimstone or of salt or of mettall which also causeth that the exhalations enclosed in this part doe heat the water
and therefore such waters are either odoriferous or of a bad smell or without any sauour of which qualities one may easily iudge by the smell and taste
for some waters sauour not onely of lime or of salt but they doe also boile as in the bathes neere to padua

yea such waters are verie ordinarie so that there are few regions but haue some of them
but they are most common in germanie and in italy
and the cause that they so boyle is either fire or putrefaction or else naturall or celestiall heat
but for the celestiall heat it seemeth that it cannot be so great especially in winter and in the night time that it should heat the water verie much
and for naturall heat it is neuer actuall but in liuing creatures because they haue life and sense
neither is putrified heat so powerfull that it can make water to boile neither is it verie likely that the substance of any thing may be engendred and corrupted at one instant
it resteth then that the cause should rather be in the fire considering also that heat hath but little motion except it attaine to the height thereof whereas otherwise it doth quench it selfe
and therefore it is that matter which burneth vnder the earth that ministreth this puissant heat which doth so warme the water
and wee may moreouer note that all those waters which boyle so are naturally light and haue some medicinable facultie and propertie and yet they are not to be so much accounted of as that which is fit for common vsage in mens affaires to preserue health

for good water hath neither colour smel nor sauour and is passing cleere and being drunke it abideth not long in the belly such they say is the water of the riuer euleus which falleth from the mountaine zager by susiana whereof the kings of persia did make prouision in their expeditions and warlike voyages
for to the preseruation of health water is no lesse to bee carefully chosen

then aire
now as warme waters are famous for the reasons heretofore deliuered so there are some waters also verie much admired for their great coldnes whereof snowe marble mettals cold aire sudden motion and the great fall from aloft euerie one in his degree may be the cause
againe the sauours or tastes of waters are verie diuers and the principal cause thereof

is heat
for sodden earth which is of sundry sorts giueth a tast to water according to the quality thereof
and the like reason is concerning colours for fine thin clay doth cause the colour of waters but thick clay tarrieth not in water and therefore dieth it not
the same cause is also in the difference of smels
and alwaies waters that are of a good smel are profitable for creatures but stinking waters cause diseases for as philosophers say contrarie causes appertaine to contrarie things
good water likewise is lightest as that which fleeteth aboue other water be it in riuers springs or wels
from whence it commeth that fresh water floateth vpon sea water which likewise being more massiue and waightie beareth more heauie burdens
and amongst fresh waters the water of rhodanus or rosne in france swimmeth vpon that of the lake of geneua passing ouer the midst thereof
also many rare properties and great woonders are written concerning waters with the causes of them as that

which is reported by iosephus of a certaine floud in iudea neere syria which ranne euery day except vpon the sabbaoth day which was reputed a matter religious and as a myracle although that this might happen and come to passe through a naturall cause if we will so argue to wit that no more water was gathered into this floud by orderly spaces then was sufficient to runne for sixe daies and not for the seuenth in such sort as phisitions render a like cause concerning the renewings or fits and ceasings of feauers
for the world is the great man as man is the little worlde
but not stretching this discourse any farther we will onelie note for conclusion thereof that in the diuersitie of the kindes of waters that which is gathered togither in one place is salt

is called the sea the fresh water so gathered togither is called a lake if it mooue not at all it is named a marish or fen but if it be somewhat deepe it is a standing poole and if it runne then is it a riuer if it gather through raines or by snowe then is it a torrent or and if it spring it is a fountaine which is euer the best water and doth slowliest putrifie
for it is least moist and is most concocted by the heauenly heate
also the lightest water doth hardliest corrupt for which cause it is most fit for the maintenance of mans life as approching neerest to the substance of the aire by which we breath
we haue said enough then concerning this matter
but me thinketh that our succeeding discourse requireth that we should entreate of those commodities which

men receiue by waters through nauigation which achitob shall be the subiect of your discourse

of the commodities which men reape of the waters by nauigation and of the directions which receiue from heauen and from the starres vpon the sea
chap

achitob

amongst such things as are woorthie of consideration in the sea and in other waters we must not passe ouer in silence those goodly commodities and great profits which they bring vnto men by the meanes of nauigations and of the dealings and trafficks which they exercise by them
for it is to be noted that euery land and countrey ca~not be furnished with al commodities bicause god hath so disposed therof that some abound in those things which othersome do greatly want stand in need of
but by meanes of sayling by water all that which can be required may be transported from one countrey to another with very small trouble charges so that one nation may communicate those commodities with another which the creator hath particularly bestowed on them all each granting mutuall helpe to the other by this meanes
wherin surely we may acknowledge the prouidence of god to be verie great manifold

for first the lord hath disposed of his creatures and distributed his treasures according to the diuersity of landes and countries euen in such manner as he diuideth his gifts and graces amongst men
for he bestoweth not all either vpon one or vpon two or vpon three or vpon any other certaine number of them and therefore there neuer hath beene nor shall be any one which either could or may surpasse all others so much that hee may haue no need of another or that hath sufficient for himselfe
for if one man possessed all he would thinke himselfe to be no more a man but a god rather and would therefore contemne all others
moreouer it is most certaine that if euery one were so well furnished with all things that they might all surpasse one another there would be no humane societie
for one would make no account of another but being all puffed vp with pride whereto they are naturally enclined there woulde arise a thousand quarrels and dissensions

amongst them as wee ordinarily see to happen amongst the proud mightie puissant and rich
for seeing that charitie which should dwell amongst men can take no place how could they be vnited and allied togither in amitie if they were not constrained therto through necessitie and if it be a difficult matter to conioine and maintaine them in peace and mutuall good will what neede soeuer they haue one of another one may easilie iudge what woulde ensue if they had not necessitie for their mistresse to this effect which causeth them to do in spight of al their abilities that which she cannot obtaine of them but by force
againe how could men exercise the workes of charitie amongst themselues which workes are very much commended vnto them by god to be done towards their neighbors if euery one could at his pleasure excell his companion as then god hath placed and disposed sundry members in one bodie and yet hath not appointed them one office but to euery one his owne so hath it pleased him to diuide and distribute his goodnes gifts and graces amongst men to the end that they may one serue another as members of one and the same bodie which can not consist without the reciprocall helpe of all
so likewise hath he established the sundrie regions of the earth enriching euerie one of them with certaine particular commodities which do often constraine men to helpe and succour one another and to liue in peace without which they woulde like madde beasts and destroy each other as we wretches doe finde true especially in time of warre
but wee may well note vpon this point that although the most mightie do by their hate enimities dissensions reuengements and warres contend oftentimes with all their power to stop and hinder the trafficke dealings and transportations of merchandize from one countrey and out of one place to another especially of foode and victuals yet whatsoeuer they may or can doe bee they kings princes or emperors they cannot for all that make such a stoppe

but that they will alwaies passe and scape by some meanes maugre all their powers
wherein wee must acknowledge that seeing god hath ordained that those which beare his image shoulde haue communication one with another for the causes aforesaide and that chiefly by the aide of nauigation it is a great presumption in mighty men to oppose themselues against the order of the omnipotent and against that

communion of benefits which hee will haue to bee maintained amongst men
whom he can constraine to obserue his ordinances euen through their owne couetousnes when their charitie faileth making them to despise all dangers that they may supply where neede is though they be forbidden vpon paine of death
for such restraint by commandement is so farre from hindring their couetousnes that it doth more inflame it bicause they expect greater gaine then if there were mutual libertie and therefore they cause more ware secretly to passe and by that meanes they put all to hazard yea they would rather open a way vnder ground like moles or else would flie in the aire like birds then leaue such trading so woonderfull is god in all his works and in the gouernment of all nature
for when he pleaseth he serueth his owne turne with the affections and euill works of men yea drawing good out of their euill euen against their owne wils
and therefore we may very well affirme that seeing god will haue men trafficke togither it cannot choose howsoeuer they enterprise to the contrarie but that this order must be continued
for this cause likewise it was not the will of the creator that the waters should so gather themselues into one place that they might not run through the earth but hee ordained that out of the great ocean which is like the great bodie of the waters and like the wombe out of which they doe all first spring and wherein they are engendred and whereby they are repaired for euer there should issue diuers armes and members by meanes whereof wee haue the mediterranean seas lakes floods riuers and brookes
so also in this distribution and by the meanes of nauigation god hath giuen vs many other meanes to the ende we might behold with our eies many testimonies of his prouidence engrauen in euery part of the vniuers by the disposition of the works of his almightie hand as they who saile vpon the waters are constrained to acknowledge

for as he hath appointed the watrie element to serue men to nauigate therin so hath he established the heaue ordained the stars enchased therin to direct them in the midst of the great gulfs deeps of the sea
for when the ships are entred very farre into it they that be therein doe cleane lose the sight of lande so that they cannot iudge by the consideration thereof in what place they are nor vpon what side neither to what place they may bend their course to finde a conuenient port but they must take their directions from heauen

and for this cause also though that the heauen be in perpetuall motion and that all the planets and starres doe follow it rising and setting in such sort as they doe not alwaies appeere to men yet there are some of another condition
for neere to the place which astronomers take for the pole there are certaine starres which haue their motion and course so disposed that they are alwaies seene at sea being neuer hidden like the rest and among these that is one which is called the which is neuer seene to remooue except a very little out of one place so that it seemeth the whole heauen turneth about this starre as we also maintaine that it hath the like place correspondent thereto directly ouer against it in the other part of heauen with a like appellation of name as we haue heretofore declared in our discourses concerning the celestiall bodies excepting the difference which is put betweene these two poles taken from their opposite situation in heauen and from the starres which are next vnto them which also haue their course and motion like the rest but doe onely differ in this that rising and setting are not attributed vnto them bicause they may be alwaies seen when the spheres are discerned
for when the skie is couered with clouds marriners doe finde themselues very much hindred and troubled
for then they prooue that which iob saith concerning the workes of god to wit

that hee commandeth the sunne and it riseth not and he closeth vp the starres as vnder a signet
and that he maketh the starre arcturus orion and pleiades and the climates of the south doing great things and vnsearchable yea maruellous things without number
whereupon we may note that here is especiall mention made of the septentrionall starres as well bicause that they are more seene then the rest as also bicause it is their propertie to bring and to procure raine and tempests if we may credite astrologers which cause that the heauen cannot be seene

and bicause that some of these starres are so disposed that they seeme to represent the figure of a chariot with fower wheeles and they are very much glistering aboue others they are commonly called by the name of bicause also they haue three other very bright starres neere to them placed in such order as if they were or oxen
indeede some haue called them the beare seeing them so co~ioined togither taking the foure quarters apart as if they were the fower quarters of a beare and the other three as the taile

thereof
there are some also who haue named them the dragon or serpent bicause that being considered togither they might seeme to represent some such forme
but howsoeuer it is certaine that pilots of gallies and ships doe direct and guide themselues chiefly by these northren starres as being most seene and best knowne by men and bicause they doe almost alwaies remaine in one place like the pole or else doe mooue so little that they are neuer out of sight especially that constellation which is properly designed by name of the beare is called the greater beare in comparison of a lesse called the lesser beare
and for which cause also the pole which is in this region and part of heauen is called arcticke which is to say of the beare for arctos in greeke signifieth a beare
now hereby we farther learne that it is very requisite for marriners and chiefly for masters and gouernors of gallies and ships to be astronomers at leastwise so much as to know the foresaid starres and to know how to iudge of the eleuation of the pole and of the degrees and the distances of euery land and countrie according to the eleuation
for it is by it that not onely marriners but geometricians and geographers also doe take their measures and dimensions to part and measure out the earth
but wee haue staied long ynough in this matter now we will consider how god hath diuided and limited out this terrestriall globe and the sundry countries and regions that are therein by the sea and separation of the water as aser you can discourse vnto vs

of the diuision of lands and countries amongst men by the waters and of the limits which are appointed them for the bounds of their habitations
chap

aser

strabo a man as well seene in good letters as anie other that hath written of geographie saith that the earth is enuironed about by the ocean and therfore he parteth it into foure very great gulfes

the first wherof turneth towards the north is called the caspian or hircanian sea the second and third is that of arabia and the gulfe of ormuz or the persian sea turning towards the south and the

fourth being greatest of all the rest is that whereinto the ocean entreth at the streight of gibraltar which some call the pillers of hercules which gulfe is called by the name of the mediterran or bicause it is compassed round about with land
and the same mediterran sea runneth enlarging it selfe making many bayes gulfs somtimes washing the coast of europe and sometimes that of africa and so it extendeth towards the east and receiueth diuers names according to the places through which it passeth
for the first coast by which it runneth is called mauritania tingitana which is that of tremissen

then doth it take the name of mauritania caesariensis towards algier and tunis then is it named the towards tripoly in barbarie then passing the quicke sandes it is the lybian sea and entring vpon the marmarica and cyrenaica it glideth with that name till it water egypt and then it is saide to be the egyptian sea
and all this coast is from the east to the west till you arriue at the gulfe of larissa beyond damiata and at the vttermost of the desarts of the where asia and africa do separate
from which port being in palestina you must turne north and as if you would take your course by the west and then this sea which was called the bicause of all syria to tripolis changeth name and is called the egean sea till you come to or helespont making all this way diuers baies and gulfes and vnder this name it coasteth thracia and the lands which abutte vpon macedonia and morea till you come to albania and there it beginneth to be called the adriatick sea then doubling towards the south it floweth by the countrey of calabria to the towne of rhegium vnder the name of the ionick sea and passing betweene sicilie and italy in stead of the old name charybdis it is called the tyrrhene sea and from thence it runneth towards the coast of genoa by name of the ligustick sea which diuideth and separateth france from italy being nominated the french sea then to end the course and finish the compasse it approcheth the isles of maiorca minorca being called the balearick sea
and proceeding farther it runneth to the streight of barbarie bearing name the iberian sea where it returneth to the first point from whence we said it first parted to wit at the streight of gibraltar which is the entrance of one sea into another

now in this briefe discourse vpon which cosmogrophers

haue written many great volumes we haue verie goodly matter to consider vpon not without much woonder of the prouidence of god in that it hath pleased him to diuide part and limit out the earth

and the sundry countries and nations that are therein by the sea and by the bosomes gulfes and armes thereof
for as it is written god hath made of one bloud all mankinde to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath assigned the times which were ordained before and the bounds of their habitation
which is as much to say that as men haue not made nor created themselues but haue beene created by the eternall so are they borne where he pleaseth hauing assigned them a place vpon the earth not at their choise but at his pleasure

and therefore also he establisheth their habitation or changeth it according to his good will either keeping them within the countrey in which they were borne or else driuing them out and bringing them into strange lands as we haue verie euident examples throughout all the holy historie where mention is made of the children of israel
for though the scripture doth deliuer vs no testimonie of the prouidence of god so speciall towards other nations as it assureth vs to haue beene towards the people of israel yet we must neuerthelesse beleeue that there is not any one man that dwelleth vpon the earth to whom the lord hath not by his prouidence assigned the place of his habitation but he would giue an example and more certainty in his people of that which he ordinarily doth towards all nations although hee doth it not so openly nor with so great fauour and grace as is declared in those whom he accounteth for his children

and therefore the prophet saith that it is god who changeth the times and seasons he taketh away kings he setteth vp kings bicause he giueth and taketh away kingdomes and he augmenteth cutteth off and altereth the limits of them as he pleaseth
whereby we also learne that we must not attribute either to the prudence and wisedome of any one or yet to the force and power or to the weapons or armies of men the changes which we daily see in the state of the most mighty but to the onely ordinance and disposition of god by which such alterations come to passe according as the soueraigne iudge knoweth to bee expedient and iust for the chastisement and punishing of men by one another or else to shew himselfe benigne and fauorable towards them
for which cause the scripture saith that the

lord vsing as his instrument senacherib the tyrant of assyria to chastise many people and nations

he calleth him the rodde and scourge of his wrath and doth greatly reprehend him by isay for that he attributed to himselfe the glory of those victories which he had giuen him not bicause of his vertues considering he was a fierce and cruell king but bicause god woulde vse him against those who deserued to be chastised by the hands of such a tyrant and murtherer
if then we consider as behooueth vs vpon that which we haue here summarily touched we shall finde therein excellent doctrine for all kings princes and people and for all men as well in generall as in particular to the end to induce them

that they may containe themselues within the inclosure of those confines wherein god hath placed them
for as he is cursed in the lawe which passeth the bounds of his neighbors possession so must we not doubt but that they are subiect to the same curse who cannot containe themselues within the bounds of those countries

in which god hath confined them bestowing vpon them power signories and habitation therein
for from whence proceede the greatest dissensions and cruellest wars but from the ambition and auarice of men which will one vsurpe aboue another that which appertaineth not vnto them and by such meanes doe their limits whereas if euery one would content himselfe with that part and portion of land which the creator thereof hath bestowed vpon him who doubteth but that men should liue in much more peace as then god through his prouidence would constraine them by necessitie and neede which they haue one of another to trafficke and communicate togither in libertie and mutuall securitie by that meanes to receiue out of one countrie into another those things which faile therein and abound elsewhere and for the causes by vs heretofore deliuered so it hath pleased him to set mightie and strong bounds and limits against their ambition and auarice especially of kings princes and great men
for we see how he hath diuided and separated one countrie from another and the diuers regions and kingdomes of the earth not onely by meanes of seas lakes and great riuers but also by craggie high and vnpassable mountaines which as the kingly prophet witnesseth he hath established by his power

that by this meanes men might be co~fined within the bounds of the habitation assigned by the eternall to euery people in such sort as he hath inclosed

the waters within their places to the course which he hath ordained them

hauing bounded them with hils and rocks
and yet there are no boundes so difficult to passe which may bridle and restraine the ambition and insatiable desire of men within any limits but that they will passe ouer the deepest the longest the amplest and broadest waters and the highest and steepest mountaines in the world so that there are no places so inaccessible through which they will not cut a passage one to another by great outrage and violence
wherein surely they euidently declare that they are much more furious then the sea how outragious and rough soeuer it bee seeing they can in no wise containe themselues within their limits as the waters doe which also maketh them more vnreasonable then brute beasts
for although there be many vnruly and furious horses in one stable yet each of them will commonly bee staied with an halter made but of a little coard or leather and will be kept by a little bar of wood from striking running ouer one another so that one onely stable will serue them all
but men doe to the contrarie shew themselues to be such furious and contentious beastes that the whole world cannot suffice them
for there is neither riuer sea lake nor mountaine which can be a barre sufficient to withhold them from forcing and rauaging one another destroying themselues by horrible massacres and cruell warres
which no doubt commeth vnto them especially through want of acknowledging and considering vpon the prouidence of god by which he hath appointed bounds to their habitation ambition and auarice as we haue said and for that they will not containe themselues within them obeying the ordinance of their creator
but we haue said ynough concerning this subiect
let vs now discourse vpon those commodities which come to men and to all creatures by the course of the waters thorough the earth
which amana shall be the substance of your speech

of the commodities which are incident to men and to all creatures by the course of the waters through the earth
chap

amana

if men doe but slenderly acknowledge the prouidence of god in the limits of their habitation which hee hath appointed as well by meanes of mountaines as by waters as we haue heard in the precedent speech they doe also make but small stay in the consideration of those great commodities which he giueth and sendeth continually to them by means of them of al the earth
for as he watereth this fruitfull mother by dew raine from heauen as hath beene heretofore expressed so doth he moisten it by meanes of fountaines floods and riuers which doe run through it
whereupon we must note that the life of all corporall creatures doth principally consist in heate and that this heate cannot be preserued and maintained without moisture whereby it is nourished euen as the flame of the snuffe or match of a candle or lampe is nourished and maintained by the fat and humor which is therein
therefore as god hath placed the sunne in heauen like a great fountaine of heate and a great furnace of fire for to be distributed and disposed into all partes of the world so hath hee established the sea here belowe in the earth as a great and perpetuall fountaine conuenient for the nourishment and conseruation of this heate which is communicated to the earth and to all the creatures that are therein
and therefore also this sea spreadeth it selfe into diuers places by the meanes which haue beene declared so that the courses of the waters in the earth are like the vaines in a mans bodie

for euen as the soueraigne creator hath placed the liuer in the bodies of liuing creatures which is as the fountaine of blood needefull for all the bodie to giue life thereto and then hath made vaines like riuers to disperse and distribute this blood to euerie member disposing them in such sort as there is not any part but doth by meanes of these vaines receiue as much blood as is needefull for the nourishment and preseruation of the life thereof so likewise he hath ordayned heere below in earth the sea

and springs of waters which he afterwards disposeth into euerie place by meanes of fountaines floods and riuers who are as the vaines through which the water that is as the blood of the earth is conueyed and communicated that it may be moistned to nourish all manner of fruits which god hath commaunded it to beare for the nouriture both of men and beasts
wherefore as in one bodie there are many veines some greater larger and longer and some lesser narrower and shorter which neuerthelesse do all answere to one selfe same source and fountaine and then doe diuide themselues into sundrie branches so the earth hath her floods riuers and streames some great others small which haue all their common springs and doe oftentimes ioine themselues together or diuide themselues into diuers branches and armes in such sort as the earth is moistened by them so much as is needfull in euerie part thereof
moreouer as it is watred to nourish the fruits so men and other liuing creatures do thereby receiue their beuerage necessarie for the preseruation of their life

but amongst all these things we are to consider that god the hath not onely prouided by meanes of them for the necessities of his creatures but euen for their honest pleasures so that it hath pleased him to conioyne an excellent beawtie with profit and vtilitie
for how goodly a thing is it to behold the fruitfull islands in midst of the sea the cleere and sweete bubling springs and gentle riuers and floods issuing out of rockes and caues of the earth which tumble downe the mountaines flow through the vallies and glide along the plaines through forrests fields and medowes being decked with many sundrie kinds of branched trees that are planted aside from inhabitants in middest of which infinite little birdes flie vp and downe tuning their voices to sing in sweete melodie and naturall musick what vnspeakable pleasure befalleth to all creatures especially to man to liue amongst such abounding beawties and who will not also admire the great varietie which is in the disposition and distinction that wee behold in the earth by the mountaines rocks valleies plaines fields vineyards medowes woods and forrests especially if we consider the fruits and profits which redound to men thereby besides the gallant diuersitie of infinite delectable pastures beawtified in all sorts for there is not one foote of earth which may not be said to serue to some good vse

no not in most desert places
some places are fit for fields and champion grounds others for pastures some for vineyards other for fruitfull orchards and others for high and well growne trees fit for building timber or for to the ende that men may helpe themselues therewith in all their needfull vses for firing
some places also are particularly commodious for cattell to graze in by which great gaine and pleasure is receiued
and for deserts mountaines and forrests they are the proper retyring places for wilde beasts by which likewise men do not only receiue profit but verie great delectation also and healthfull exercise in hunting of them and which is more such places are verie commodious for houshold cattell which do there feed in euerie place to maruellous profit
but let vs note that all these properties and profits should not be found in the earth if it were not conioyned with the water by the course thereof thorough euerie part of it
which water likewise doth cause many and vnspeakable profits that redound to men by fish which remaine not onely in the sea but also in lakes ponds and riuers being of so sundrie kindes and natures that it is not possible to number them
in which if the prouidence of god be most admirable

it is especially to be obserued in the sea
for how many sorts of fishes are there great little and of meane quantitie and how manie sundrie formes and what diuersitie of nature beleeue verily that whosoeuer should vndertake to number them by euerie kinde and particularly should be almost as much troubled as if he would purpose to emptie the ocean
but though there be not any little creature in the sea wherein god doth not declare himselfe and shew himselfe great and admirable yet doth he chiefly manifest himselfe so to be in two things
the first is in the hugenes and power of the great fishes which he hath created as whales and such like which seeme to be rather then fishes there being no beast in all the earth so great and strong for there are some that seeme a farre off to be islands or mountaines rather then fishes
and the other most wonderfull thing is that the creator hath set such a correspondencie in many points betwixt the fishes and beasts of the earth that it seemeth he would represent a great part of the one by the other
so we see also that many names of earthly beasts are giuen to many fishes because of the similitude and likenes which they haue together in figure and in nature yea it seemeth that god would

represent in the fishes of the sea almost all the other creatures which are in the rest of the world
for there are some which be called stars because they are like that shape according to which men commonly paint the starres
moreouer how many are there which beare the shape of earthly creatures yea of many instruments made by men

for amongst others there is a fish called the cocke which is also named by fishers in some countries the ioyner because it hath almost as much diuersitie of bones and gristles as a ioyner hath of tooles the forme of which they also represent
but if we speake of the sundrie fashions of fishes and of their colours scales heads skins fins and of their vnderstanding industrie and chase and of their shels and abiding places and of their natures and infinite properties who should not haue iust cause to woonder moreouer haue not men forged many fashions of weapons the forme of which they haue taken from diuers fishes what shall we also say of the finnes and little wings which god hath giuen them to direct them and to hold them vp in the sea and in other waters like birds in the aire and as ships are rowed and guided by oares and the rudder seemeth it not that god hath created them like watrie birdes to whom he hath giuen wings agreeable to the element for to sustaine themselues with and fit for their nature as he hath done to the fowles of the aire

we also read in genesis that the lord did make in one day the birds and fishes and euerie flying thing
for as the aire hath more agreement with the water then with the earth and approcheth neerer to the nature thereof so is there more answerablenes betweene the creatures which liue conuerse in these two elements then is between the the beasts of the earth and therefore we see that the seed of both kindes is multiplied by their egs
and we must also note that forasmuch as men can receiue no great fruit nor much profit by fish except in their victuals or in some medicine or such like vse which is not so co~mon as ordinarie nourishment god by his prouidence blessing hath made them so fruitfull that they multiplie and increase woondrously as experience doth euidently manifest vnto vs by the great number of frie or spawne that is found in one only fish
which fertilitie we must beleeue to proceede from the power which the almightie bestowed vpon them as also vpon all his creatures when he said vnto them bring foorth fruit and multiplie and fill the waters in the sea and let the foule multiplie in

the earth
a thing which we must well consider vpon to the end that we may referre to this blessing of god all those commodities which we daily receiue either from those creatures or from the earth it selfe or from the other elements and that we must render him continuall thanks and praises therefore
for he hath in no lesse wise blessed all his creatures then the fishes and the birds when by his word he gaue their nature to them in which hee created them and did presently after command them to bring foorth fruit according vnto that nature
to the ende then that we may be the more induced to glorifie so great a workeman for the excellencie of his workes which shineth in all creatures let vs now intreat of some fishes most accou~ted of by those who haue written of their nature and let vs consider of their singularities and woonders so much onely as the scope of our discourse will permit vs in such sort as we haue declared in our antecedent speeches
to you then aram referre the relation concerning this matter

of diuers kindes of fishes namely of the whale of the dolphin of the and others
chapter

aram

it is affirmed by all the learned who haue diligently searched out the secrets of nature that the water bringeth foorth both more and greater creatures then the earth doth bicause of the abundance of moisture that is therein
and the sea is so ample and so fit to giue nourishment and a gentle and fertile increase of all things by meanes of that generating seede which it attracteth from heauen and the aide of nature ordained by the creator which hath this propertie to produce alwaies something that seemeth new that it is no maruell if there be founde incredible and monstrous things in the water
for the seedes of all forms doe so interlace and themselues therein as well by the windes as by the agitation of the waues that one may well say as is said commonly that there is nothing on earth which is not in the sea yea

and that there are many things in it which cannot be found either in the aire or on the earth
now great fishes are chiefly resident vnder the torrid zone bicause that in the ocean heate and moisture serue for

augmentation

as saltnes doth for conseruation
and in this number is the whale of which the ancients write and whome some moderns call gibbar bicause that the common whale which some take for the musculus of aristotle doth not answere to the description of this which is of incredible hugenes
for if we will beleeue histories there haue beene some seene of fower acres of ground in length

they make an horrible crie and spout out of two holes of a cubite long which they haue neere to their nostrils so much water that they oftentimes drowne ships therewith
and of their crests men make faire rods which seeme to be of bone or of horne blacke in colour and like to the hornes of a buffe so flexible that they can hardly be broken they do shine in the sunne as if they were gilded
of euery peece of his crest is a rod made so that in one crest there are many rods
moreouer the bone of his whole head is so great that one might make a ship thereof

and as this kinde of fish is the heauiest and mightiest of all so the dolphin is the swiftest and most ingenious not onely of all watrie creatures but of those of the earth and of the aire
for they swim faster then a bird can flie
and therefore if this fish were not there were no fish could scape him
but nature prouiding therefore in putting his mouth vnder his belly hath so restrained him that he can catch nothing but backwards whereby the great swiftnes of such fishes doth euidently appeere
wherefore when the dolphin pressed with hunger pursueth any fish to the bottome and that he hath staied long there alwaies holding winde when he riseth he leapes aboue water with incredible quicknes and force to take breath againe
some haue marked in this kinde of fish that they haue their toong mooueable contrarie to the nature of all other
their voice is as when one waileth
their backe is bowed and bendeth outwards they are very louing to men and like well of musicke and indeede they doe not shun men as other fishes doe but come right before ships making a thousand leapes and frisks before them
sometimes also as if they had chalenged the mariners to trie who should goe speediest they take their course along with the ships and doe outstrip them how good winde soeuer they haue

amongst also the is very admirable
for he hath vdders and haire and calueth vpon the earth as sheepe

bring foorth and is deliuered of the second burthen presently after hir yoong ones
he snorts mightily when he sleepeth neere to the shore he bleates and bellowes like a calfe and for that cause beareth the same name
the sinnes wherewith he swimmeth serue for feete on ground to goe vpon
his hide whereof the islanders make girdles hath a maruellous propertie for the haire which is thereupon riseth when the sea increaseth falleth when it diminisheth
some holde also that this creature is very capable of discipline easily learning that which is shewed him and that he saluteth people by his lookes and with a certaine noise and shaking that he makes

now let vs speake of the tortoise which is of a very strange forme
there are found of them in the coast of india so great

that one shell onely is sufficient to couer a good pretie shed
and in the countrie of the chelonophagi there are some isles where they ordinarily vse tortoise shels in stead of boates
for we must note that there be three sorts of tortoises the terrestriall which breedeth in forrests marish ones which breed in fens and watry ones which breed in the sea
those then of this last sort haue insteed of feete so many broad gristles they haue no teeth but the nibbe of their beake is passing sharpe and their vnderchappe doth close as iustly within their vpper chap as a boxe doth with the lidde of it
being in the sea they liue vpon shell fishes for their mouth is so strong and hard that they crush them yea euen stones in peeces yet when they come on land they neuer liue but vpon herbes
they lay egges like birds so that sometimes one may finde an hundred togither
and they neuer hatch them in the water but putting them into an hole which they make in the ground and couering them well they smooth with their shels vnderneath the place wherein they are and hatch in the night time for a whole yeere long

also amongst the fishes which are famous for their strange operatiue power is the torpedo or crampfish

which is a kind of hedgehogge hath many bristles the touch of whom be nummeth the fishers hands by some naturall and secret vertue
and there be many kindes of these fishes who haue all of them their shell couered with bristles very thicke which bristles they vse in stead of feete to staie themselues vpon when they mooue and stirre from one place to another
their head and mouth is the lowest part of them and towards the ground
and amongst the

rest there is one not of the kinde of this bristled crampfish but a shell fish which the latins call remora because it hath such power that if it take hold of the bottome of ships it staieth them
yet we cannot read that any such thing hath beene seene since the time of caius caligula the emperor whom historiographers report to haue beene one time staied in his ship by this fish to his great endommagement

but the most woonderfull of all fishes is the triton otherwise called the sea bugge for hee hath haire vpon his head the nose of a man a broad mouth and the teeth of a wilde beast
his hands fingers and nailes are somewhat like those of a man
and the rest of his bodie is couered with a thinne shell with a taile vnder his belly in stead of feete like a dolphin

pliny reporteth that in the time of the emperor tyberius the people of lisbone sent embassadors onely to aduertise him that in the coast of their sea there was a triton discouered blowing of an horne in a caue

the nereides also otherwise called sirens or mermaides do very neere approch to humane forme sauing that they bee rough and ful of shels in euery part of their body
there are some also who testifie that they haue seene a hauing the entire forme of a man
finally it is a thing that seemeth altogither incredible that the diuersitie of fishes or rather should be such as they affirme who haue written thereof
but we may well beleeue that the facilitie of generation and of life in the waters

is cause of so many strange shapes
for heate and moisture consist togither in generation and nourishment maintaineth life and in the sea heate and fatte moisture and nutriment do abound
it is also to be noted that by reason of motion the pestilence neuer commeth into the water as into the aire for the sea is euer mooued and the aire is often still
for which cause all kindes of creatures may easily be preserued in the sea but not so in the aire
againe fishes mooue themselues in the sea easily and without labour which the beasts of the earth do not who therefore are constrained to be hungrie or necessarily to be consumed by too much labour and trauaile
moreouer the sea freezeth not neither yet is too hot like the earth and like other waters except it be and that very seldome in the superficies thereof which is touched by the aire
therefore through so manie commodities and by the mixture of creatures of diuers kindes many monsters are engendred in the sea so that sometimes

when it ariseth by meanes of the flowing thereof one may finde vpon the shore of the westerne ocean to the number of three hundred kindes of monstrous fishes
but although it seemeth that nature would expresse in fishes the formes of all terrestriall creatures put in them some resemblance of shape yet in the hinder part all fishes are except some fewe of a peculiar forme agreeable to their nature and do onely resemble other creatures in the forepart
for as the rudder directeth and gouerneth a ship in the sterne so the taile of a fish doth guide it in swimming
and for this cause the tailes of all fishes almost are forked
but this is most certaine that their sorts and kinds surmount the kindes of other creatures in multitude in greatnes in force and in varietie of shapes
but our intent is not heere to number them as we haue said for so we should finde matter enough to make a great volume as others haue done
wherefore to finish this argument and this daies speech see achitob if by our discourses of the sea of the waters and of the liuing creatures which are engendred do liue in them you can deliuer any instruction which may be answerable to that end for which we especially continue our treatise concerning this great vniuers

of the image that we haue of the state of this world and of men in the sea and in the fishes thereof
chap

achitob

let vs not doubt companions but that we haue a goodly image in this daies discourse of the state of this world and of all mans life
for first

what is this world but a sea wherein we nauigate and are in continuall danger nay is the sea it selfe so variable so inconstant and so outragious for if we haue neuer so little respite peace and rest like as when the sea is calme and quiet presently there arise such violent whirlewindes stormes and furious tempests as it seemeth oftentimes that heauen earth and all the elements conspire and runne togither to worke nor ruine
yea when this wicked world sheweth vs fairest countenance becommeth most calme and gentle and that it feedeth vs with the fattest morsels then is it most false vnto vs and then are we in greatest danger
for when

we thinke our selues most sure therein then are we sodainly tost and carried away as with violent waues and horrible whirewinds into the lowest gulfes and deepes of the earth
moreouer as the huge monsters of the sea and the greatest and strongest fishes do eate vp and deuoure the smallest and weakest and as the craftiest entrap the simplest and pray vpon them euen so is it with the men of this world
for the mightiest tyrants and the richest strongest and greatest rouers theeues and robbers do pill and take away the substance of the least and feeblest and do consume and deuoure them
and they which cannot doe so by force haue recourse to sleights deceits and treasons by which they surprise the simple and meeke
and therefore also as the holy ghost compareth in the scripture tyrants

rouers theeues and murderers to woolues beares lyons and such like beasts and the craftie and deceitful to foxes dragons and serpents who do by subtiltie and guile that which they cannot performe by power and force so doth he compare them to huge whales and to the great fishes of the sea
so because nilus a renowned riuer whereof we haue alreadie spoken passeth through the land of egypt and runneth into the sea by seuen mouthes or armes isay calleth pharaoh the king and tyrant of that countrey

leuiathan or whale which god did strike with his strong hand and his mightie arme ouerwhelming him in the red sea
it is also saide for the like consideration in the psalmes thou brakest the heads of dragons in the waters

thou brakest the head of leuiathan in peeces and gauest him for meate to the people in the wildernes

and the prophet abacuc doth likewise compare the king and tyrant of babylon to a great fisher who casteth his nets into the sea and causeth the fishes to come into them and so he taketh them

but heere we are to note that although there be some kinds of beasts who eate one another yet are they not all of this nature
for there are but certaine of them that liue so vpon praie and rapine
and amongst them that so liue there are but verie fewe that eate beastes of their owne kinde except great famine constraine them thereto yea hunger doth inuite them that liue by pray to chase and deuour others rather then their owne kinde
for it is necessitie and want of sustenance that driueth them thereto
and though especially fishes do least spare their owne kinde yet doe they not eate one another except when

hunger constraineth them thereto to preserue their life

but men most wretched surely haue not all these causes to mooue them against their own kind against their owne flesh and bloud as it is ordinarily seene that they are more cruelly and more fiercely bent one against another then any bruite beasts but contrariwise they shoulde be much better furnished in all their necessities and should liue much more at their ease if they could maintaine good peace and vnitie one with another
wherefore in that they do otherwise it is easie to iudge how much their nature is corrupted peruerse except they be regenerated by the spirite of god
for there is no bond of nature whatsoeuer no not that which is kept amongst the brutest beasts as of the female towards her yoong ones or of the male towards the female and such like which men do not shamefully breake and violate
but we must herein acknowledge a terrible iudgment furie of god against them bicause of their sin which hath so peruerted and infected the first original nature of the stock of mankinde
for when he giueth strength and power to the one for to torment and destroy the other yea to most cruell tyrants and bloudie murtherers who make lesse account of men then of beasts we must learne this doctrine that herein the iust ordina~ce of the almightie is very euident by which he punisheth the wicked by the wicked

taketh reuenge vpon his enimies euen by his enimies the~selues as he hath threatned them in his law
and therefore there is lesse maruel herein then that god suffreth the small fishes to be eaten by great ones the weakest by the strongest and the simplest by the craftiest as also the gentlest birds by the cruellest and lambes sheepe and other priuate domesticall and harmelesse beasts by woolues beares lyons and other wilde beasts
for it is very certaine that the beasts haue not offended their creator nor deserued his wrath through any sinne against him as men haue done who being created in his owne image are fallen from innocencie and holines through their own fault through the corruption of nature which the transgression of gods ordinance hath brought vpon them
and if we cannot make answere for the cause of this nature of vnreasonable creatures but onely that it hath so pleased god who is the master and lord of all these works and who hath prouided for them according to his good pleasure surely also when we can conceiue no other reason for the tyrannie and crueltie of men exercised

one vpon another this same reason should then suffice vs
for the onely will of the eternall the which cannot be but iust and reasonable alwaies must euer serue for a reason when wee cannot vnderstand the causes as we would
but as saide euen now this reason manifesteth it selfe sufficiently in his iust iudgements vpon men bicause of their sinnes
now albeit wee holde this sufficiently good in regard of the wicked and of those who oppose themselues and rebell fiercely against the almightie yet the consideration might seeme to vs to be otherwise in respect of the meeke and of those whome he holdeth not onely for his seruants but also for his beloued children who neuerthelesse are commonly a pray to the wicked as sheepe are to woolues
must indeed confesse that these iudgements of god seeme more strange to humane reason then the other do yet they are not so secret and mysticall but that he manifesteth causes enough not onely by his worde

but also by common experience
for first how much goodnes holines and perfection soeuer can consist in any man yet neuertheles as concerning his flesh he walloweth altogither in sinne and very much naturall corruption in pride arrogancie rebellion and disobedience against god which haue great neede to bee better mortified humbled tamed and brought downe
againe how easie a matter is it for vs to forget our creator and our owne selues and to abuse all the graces and benefits which we receiue continually at his hand also seeing that he will be glorified and that his power shall be knowne in the faith constancie charitie and patience of his we should not thinke it strange that he puts them to triall exercising them by diuers great and dangerous temptations and afflictions
now the tyrannie malice crueltie and peruersnes of the wicked serueth in all these things for his children and to his glorie through his prouidence notwithstanding that he hateth all the wicked vsing them only as rods and scourges to chastise and punish those whom he pleaseth as he is likewise serued by diuels without approouing their works insomuch as they proceed from themselues
but there is more yet for considering that god hath not created men like vnto beasts onely to liue in this world with a corporall temporall life but hath made them to immortality and eternall life like the angels he will then by the aduersities which he sendeth vnto them heere giue them to vnderstand that other blessings doe attend for them far greater then those which

may be tasted vpon earth and which are common betwixt them and beasts
behold then the fruit which me seemeth must be gathered in our discourse this day now to morrow wee will step out of the sea and waters to take land againe and to consider vpon the treasures and benefits therein which it produceth for the commoditie of men and the diuersitie of creatures that liue therein whereof aser you shall begin to discourse

the end of the eighth daies worke

the ninth daies worke
of fruits and of the fertilitie of the earth and the causes thereof and of herbs trees and plants
chap

aser

as the holy scripture teacheth vs that before god did create the beasts of the earth

he commaunded the earth that was discouered and free from the waters to bud foorth the bud of the herbe that seedeth seede the fruitfull tree which beareth fruit according to his kinde which hath his seede in it selfe vpon the earth and it was so we must likewise vnderstand that this commandement had not such vertue for that time onely but that it endureth and remaineth alwaies and so will doe till the consummation of the world
for all herbes trees and plants that the earth euer hath borne doth beare or shall beare euen from the creation of the same vntill the end of the world doe proceede from the first ordinance and eternall word of the soueraigne by which all things haue beene created
wherefore moses to the ende that men might acknowledge this diuine power which maketh the earth so fruitful doth expressely tell vs that god gaue this fertilitie before there was any sunne moone or starre in heauen
for hee saith that these goodly lights were created the fourth day but

that the production of herbs

trees plants was on the third day
thereby then we must learne that although the sun moone and starres besides the husbandrie of man do serue by the ordinance of god for to make the earth fertile yet for all that it can bring foorth no fruit if the word and blessing of the almightie do not giue it power
for as it was fertile before it was aided by the starres euen so is it now in regarde of the tillage and husbandrie of man
for there was neither man nor beast when it budded foorth the fruites which god commanded it to beare yea so much wanteth it to become fruitful by the trauell of man that to the contrarie it hath lost very much fertilitie and a great part thereof hath become barren since his first creation bicause of his sinne
for in lieu of the blessing that god at first gaue thereunto

he said afterwards to the man that it should be cursed for his sake and that it should bring foorth thornes and thistles and that he should eate the fruits thereof in sorrow
for these causes then we must alwaies haue respect to the power of the word and of the blessing of god by which all things haue been created in their order as we haue heretofore declared and man last of al as the of the lords worke
who hauing determined in his eternall counsell to create man after his owne image and likenes to the end that he might in this visible world represent his creator as in his most liuely semblance was not onely pleased to build him his lodging first to wit the whole world but would also replenish and furnish it euery where to the end that nothing might be found emptie
but that which is herein to bee chiefly considered is that this diuine prouidence hauing giuen essence to all corporall creatures hath therewithall prouided necessarie meanes to keepe and preserue them all in their natures
for minding to giue life to birds to fishes and to the beastes of the earth he had already prepared their foode before he had created them and had ordained the earth as the mother and the nurse of all creatures which are engendred and which dwell and are conuersant therein

and in the waters and aire also for the birds and fishes
moreouer as all bodies are composed of fire of aire of earth and of water so the lords will was that all these enimies should conioine togither and receiue aide one from another to the preseruation of liuing creatures by vertue of the alliance and agreement which is not onely betwixt the said elements but also betwixt them and the celestiall spheres as wee

haue alreadie discoursed
for considering that they be the principles of things hauing life they cannot liue nor be naturally conserued but by meane of the very same elements from which they take their originall
and therefore the prouidence of god causeth that they doe all accord togither to nourish and maintaine those creatures which he hath made and created

but seeing that we are in talke of the fertilitie of the earth

ordayned by god to that ende according as we haue declared who is it that can number the diuers kinds of herbs of trees and of all sorts of plants which it produceth and who is it that can but onely name and finde proper denominations agreeable vnto them and if we should speake of their diuersities and varieties in rootes in stalks in stockes in tops in branches in boughes in leaues in shapes in flowers in colours in seeds in fruits in tastes in smels and in sauours who would not maruell verie much we see how the lord speaking onely of the lilly of the field doth testifie that salomon in all his royaltie was not adorned like one of those and therefore he bringeth it as a testimonie of his goodnes in reproch of those which take care for their clothing as if they distrusted in the prouidence of god

and as if they supposed him not able enough to apparell them or at least that he had not so much care of men as he hath of the herbs and flowers of the field which he endueth and decketh with so gallant clothing with so many sorts of excellent faire colours and yet they neither spinne nor haue weauers nor clothiers nor drapers nor other and tradesmen to deale for them
yea how maruellous is the conseruation and multiplication of all plants by meanes of their owne seeds syons and fruits according as the creator did at first constitute for that may first speake of the smaller sort who could beleeue if experience did not assure vs that of one little graine of mustard seede should grow a great and high plant like a little shrub

in such sort that the birds of heauen might make their nests therein then let vs consider how corne pulse and all other sorts of seeds do bud grow and multiply
but who of himselfe would iudge that out of one little kernell of a nut or filberd there could grow so great trees and so much wood as should beare innumerable leaues and buds and so much fruit each yeere euerie one according to his owne kinde and that for long time would not all this seeme incredible if we were not ascertained by continuall experience and a sure

course in nature and if god doth shew himselfe most wonderfull in all these things in regard of the herbes trees and plants what shall we say if we proceed to the consideration of their natures properties and vertues and of the commodities remedies and profits

which men receiue thereby this surely is the most principall point
for how admirable is it that by the meanes of herbes trees and other plants which haue no soule that may minister life vnto them with motion and sense and which may much lesse participate with any reason god doth not onely preserue the life of men and of other creatures a thing to bee woondred at but doth also thereby giue them strength vigour and force for what are these herbs and plants which produce all sorts of corne pulse and other graine of which men make foode and are thereby nourished what is the vine and other who could thinke if he saw it not with his eies that there is neither man nor beast that could be nourished and preserue his life but by such meanes for how can that thing either giue or preserue and maintaine life which hath no life in it selfe and yet if we will consider of the medicines and remedies which men finde in herbes and plants onely besides those which they may take from other creatures who can in truth either declare or write wil not say all of them but onely the thousandth part for although the most excellent phisitions haue alwaies trauelled in this part of their art which is commonly called the knowledge of symples yet how farre off are they from the full and perfect theoricke of them for what a number of herbes and rootes be there which are vnknowen and haue yet no name and how many are there which are taken one for another and wherein the most skilful phisitions and herbarists are oftentimes deceiued and yet this little which we know should mooue vs to thinke vpon the great and ineffable bountie of god towards men and vpon the fatherly care which he hath of vs all
for though that by our sinnes we haue merited death both of bodie and soule which death our sinne hath not onely gained but also many diuers and strange sorts of diseases and corporall infirmities most grieuous and terrible yea sometimes hideous and horrible which are like butchers and slaughterers to put them to death yet the charitie and loue of our god is alwaies so great towards mankinde that he giueth vs as many and more yea sundrie medicines for one onely maladie
but we will be instructed

more amply by you amana in this matter that wee may acknowledge therein verie cleere testimonies of the prouidence of god

of the vertue that herbes and other fruits of the earth haue in phisicke and in food and of the true vse of them
chap

amana

it is daily seene that by the meanes of some small herbes which grow in a garden or in a mountaine or in some other desert place and which also are oftentimes troden vnder foote without any account made of them many are commonly deliuered not onely from great paines and grieuous maladies but euen from death it selfe which otherwise it seemeth would most certainely approch
wherin certes we haue a goodly subiect to consider that if god giueth this vertue to creatures of small estimation in comparison of many others and that by the meanes of them hee ministreth so great helpe and doth so much good to man what must be the power and bounty of that great and soueraigne phisition which maketh them preuaile and giues them power to heale for wee must vnderstand that it is not the herbes nor other drugs and preparatiues nor yet the apothecaries and phisitions who make and compound them that are the true cause of to the sicke but god alone who doth not onely giue the remedies but also knowledge to men how for to vse them and to be skilfull how to apply them to their owne necessities for which he hath created them
herein then we must acknowledge two great benefits that the most good and most puissant god hath conferred vpon vs
the first is

that he hath giuen vs medicines fit and necessarie for healing
the other is the knowledge of them and the theoricke how to apply them to their conuenient purpose and vsage
and one of these benefits without the other would indeede but little auaile vs
for as the workman cannot worke without such stuffe as is requisite for him to make his worke of as also it would be vnprofitable if no man should employ it and put it to vse for the same cause god which taketh care of the least of his creatures hath imprinted in

the nature of brute beasts that want vnderstanding and reason a certaine knowledge of things that are fit for them not onely for their nourishment but also for remedies in their diseases so that they neede no other phisitions but themselues onely

but in this discourse we are to note what iudgement we must make of so great vertue as we finde in all herbes and drugs and by like reason that we must consider thereof in the propertie of corne bread wine and of all meates and drinks which are as ordinarie and continuall medicines for the preseruation of life
for if that which is diminished and consumed daily in vs were not also repaired and restored daily by our meate and drinke wee should fall suddenly into greeuous maladies and finally into death
forasmuch then as it pleaseth god to preserue the life which he hath giuen vs and to maintaine vs in health and good disposition he giueth power to that which we eate and drinke to doe this
but if it should please him to doe otherwise there were neither meate nor drinke which could giue any sustenance and conuenient nourishment vnto vs but would rather conuert within vs into deadly poyson to take away our life and hasten our death euen as god doth oftentimes to that effect vse the aire without which we could no more liue then without meate and drinke
and therefore when it pleaseth god that we shall liue in health and long time he maketh the aire good and holsome for vs if otherwise it pleaseth him to strike vs with sicknes and to hasten our death he changeth it as if it were impoisoned as we doe very often finde in diuers contagious sicknesses and chiefly in time of pestilence
the like also is in victuals drinks and medicines
and therefore the lord menaceth his people by isaie declaring vnto them that he will take away the staffe of bread and of water that is to say the substance and naturall vertue which he hath giuen them to nourish which is the force that sustaineth them who are sustained as a staffe sustaineth him that is weake and as man cannot liue except he haue both meate and drinke sufficient the prophet hath comprised vnder bread and water all things needfull for nourishment and for the life of man
it is therefore in these things that god saith he will take away all power

as also moses doth amply declare in the blessings and curses of the lawe
for let vs also note that when god will punish men by dearth and famine he doth not onely make the earth barren as he threatneth but also curseth that little

fruit which it beareth yea in such sort that it still diminisheth and hath not the accustomed vertue and power to nourish
and therefore when the corne is sowne it yeeldeth not so many eares nor so many graines in the field as is expected and as it seemeth that it should yeeld
and afterwards when it is gathered and reaped and that it commeth to be threshed there is yet found lesse corne then was esteemed to be
and being laid vp in the barne it consumeth more then of custome carried to the mill it yeelds lesse meale then is looked for yea being kneaden into dough it seemeth to diminish briefly it seemeth to faile being made in paste brought to the ouen and so baked when it is in the binne vpon the table yea in the hand in the mouth in the stomack and in the bellie
for it doth not satisfie nourish and sustaine so well as in time of plentie and abundance but they which feede thereof are alwaies hungrie and famished
and so we may thinke of all other meates and drinks euen as we finde the contrarie in the blessing of god when through it he giueth fruitfulnes to the earth and abundance of all things according to the testimonie of his word
as then we are admonished to haue recourse to him onely to demaund our daily bread and all other things needefull for this life so must wee also doe when wee are visited by sicknesse
for hee is the soueraigne and onely phisition who can of himselfe heale vs
it is hee that striketh and giueth remedie which bringeth to the graue and draweth out againe which killeth and raiseth vp againe
and therefore hee saith to his people by moses if thou wilt diligently harken vnto the voice of the lorde thy god

and wilt doe that which is right in his sight and wilt giue eare vnto his commandements and keepe all his ordinances then will put none of these diseases vpon thee which brought vpon the egyptians for am the lorde that healeth thee
but although that god alone can doe all things without the aide of any creature and without the vse of any meanes except he please

yet doth he choose out such meanes as he pleaseth to performe his works towards vs and to distribute his gifts and that chiefly for two causes
the first is for that he will not haue his creatures remaine idle but serue to his glory and for the good and health of men considering that they were created to that end
and the other cause is that it pleaseth him to accommodate himselfe to our infirmitie which is such as we do not thinke that he is neere vnto

vs nor that he can or will do it except we haue alwaies some visible signes
although then it is as easie for him to nourish vs without victuales and without drinke as with them and to heale vs without phisitions and medicines and drugs as hee doth by meanes of them neuerthelesse it is his pleasure to do it by such aides and he will haue vs subiect to this order
and therefore let vs thinke that to despise the meanes which he giueth for the maintenance of this life is as much as to despise his commandements like mockers and rebels
and if we be such we may not hope for any succours from him seeing we reiect the remedies by which he will giue them vnto vs
but we must alwaies come to this point that although wee cannot receiue the benefits which it pleaseth the most good god to communicate vnto vs except by the meanes ordained by his prouidence thereto yet neuerthelesse we must not attribute this power to any of his creatures but to him onely and must giue him the whole glory considering that he taketh them not for any need which he hath or that without them he could not performe his works but onelie for the aide and supportation of our infirmitie
and therefore let vs beleeue that bread wine and all other meates drinkes drugs and medicines haue not any vertue of themselues but so much onely as god infuseth into them and as he thinketh needfull for our good by such instruments as he ordaineth thereto
wherefore men runne in vaine to such aides and especially to phisitions and apothecaries to be succoured by them except god the soueraigne phisition do put his hand thereto and except he blesse their arte and labour

experience certainly doth yeelde vs daily testimonie thereof
for it oftentimes hapneth that in stead of helping phisitions do hurt and in stead of healing do kill
and how so because there are very fewe which addresse themselues to the true and almightie phisition and who haue not more confidence in mortall men then in the immortall god as king asa is accused in the scripture and punished for this fault with death
true it is that some faile in that which they make none account of the ordinarie meanes established by god despising both phisitions and al the medicines of their arte which is almost as much as to refuse the vsage of those benefits which god giueth vs at need
but the greatest number consisteth of those who not onely haue recourse chiefly to the professors of this science and put all their confidence in them but will

moreouer in stead of vsing the aduise and assistance of good and learned phisitions addresse themselues more willingly to empiricks and such as are ignorant or else are sorcerers enchanters witches and worshippers of diuels
if then our desire be not to faile with the one nor the other we must rest in that way which is shewed vs in ecclesiasticus to wit honor the phisicion with that honor that is due vnto him because of thy necessitie

for the lord hath created him
for of the most high commeth healing and the phisition shall receiue gifts of the king
the knowledge of the phisition lifteth vp his head and he shall be in admiration
the lord hath created medicines of the earth he that is wise will not abhorre them

was not the water made sweete with wood that men might know the vertue thereof so hath he giuen men knowledge that he might be glorified in his woondrous works
which is as much to say that as god hath sweetned the bitternes of the waters in the desart by meanes of woode which he caused moses to cast thereinto so likewise doth he manifest his power by the arte of phisicke shewing marueilous effects thereby
and therefore the wise man doth adde with medicines god healeth men and taketh away their paines
of such doth the apothecarie make a confection and yet he cannot finish his owne worke for of the lord commeth prosperitie and health ouer all the earth
and finally he exhorteth the sicke to praie saying my sonne faile not in thy sicknes but praie vnto the lord and he will make thee whole leaue off from sinne and order thine hands aright and clense thine hart from all wickednes
then giue place to the physition for the lord hath created him let him not goe from thee for thou hast need of him
the hower may come that their enterprises may haue good successe for they also pray vnto the lord that he woulde prosper that which is giuen for ease and their phisicke for the prolonging of life
wherein namely this holy personage doth euidently declare what is the vertue of phisitions if they desire that the lord would blesse their works without whose blessing they can neuer come to a prosperous ende
behold then what seemed good vnto me to note concerning the true vse of the great and excellent gifts which god communicateth with vs for the maintenance of mans life
and pursuing this subiect let vs speake somthing more particularly concerning the diuersity and singularitie of diuers plants the discourse whereof aram commit to you

of the diuersitie of plants and of their difference and naturall growth and of their parts and of the most excellent amongst them
chapter

aram

the learned teach that there are fower kindes of plants to wit trees shrubs and herbes
now a tree is that whose stocke waxeth greene euerie yeere and therefore groweth to great height as the
the shrub called of latines frutex is that whose stocke remaineth for many yeeres together but it groweth not verie high as the and the myrtle
the called subfrutex resteth also vpon the stock but exceedeth not the height of herbes as the broome
and the herbe is that which hath neither stalke nor stock as housleeke sage or else hath a stock but so as it changeth euery yeere as the fennell
and yet a fift kind may be added between the herbe the shrub as rue bicause that sometimes it groweth great like a shrub and sometimes remaineth like other herbes which is also vsuall to the cabbage
but generally all plants may attaine to great height by husbandrie
also amongst specially those which are greene doe oftentimes growe into shrubs by the industrie of man in winter time whereby it appeereth that we must not take the true difference of plants and of their kindes by their greatnes or growth no more then in that the leaues of plants are not all of one bignes or bicause they alwaies stay vpon some and fall off from others or bicause they differ in colour or else bicause one plant is barren

and another beareth fruit
but wee must take this difference in foure things which are the vertue and propertie the odour the sauor and the shape of the leaues buds fruit barke and rootes and generally of the whole plant
of which fower differences the principall is the facultie vertue or propertie for the vertue proceedeth from the forme and the forme is that which distinguisheth the kindes
and therefore though the willowe and the vitex called agnus castus haue their leaues and barke alike it should neuertheles be a manifest error to vse the one for the other
for the vitex is hot and drie in the third degree of which it hath this marke that it driueth

away ventosities and flourisheth first amongst all trees but the willow is cold and moist flourishing very late and causing ventosities
now for the odour or sent one may euidently knowe by them the temperature of plants
and therefore they which are of one kinde although the one growe in india and the other in scythia yet doe they necessarily participate with the selfe same principall vertues
and for the sauour and figure they are discerned by the taste and eie wherein it is necessarie to imploy much diligence and labour to iudge well concerning the difference of plants
those then which are alike in forme in power in odour and in taste may without doubt bee accounted of one selfe same kinde for we search out the names of them according to their vertues
whereupon ensueth that they which haue one selfe same vertue may be comprised vnder one kinde though the herbalist call them by sundrie names according to the proportion of their figure

now some plants doe growe naturally in fieldes and forests some in the sea others in riuers others on the shore side some in marishes some amongst stones sands and grauell some in pits and so of others in such like places
for the place in which they growe or to which they are remooued and the temperature of the aire are much auailable to cause them growe and fructifie
through which occasion there are higher trees more flourishing fairer to behold and more charged with leaues and fruit

in some places rather then in other
whereupon ensueth that such as loue mountaines as the cedar saple pine the turpentine tree box tree iuniper tree beech and the doe there growe high and faire as in the plaines and lowe forrests the oke the beech the the elme the maple the ash the doe growe best
but neere to riuers and places the the alder the white and blacke poplar the tamariske the willow and the reede doe sping at pleasure though many of them doe growe in mountaines vallies plaines and forrests but they prosper not there so well
this difference also is marked in herbes and shrubs
for some growe well in marishes others in lakes and pooles others on riuers sides other prosper in watrish and muddie places others againe not abiding them doe growe in drie and stonie ground
some spring indifferently both in moist and drie ground
and some require the fields others vineyards and others meadowes
some

also loue the valleies others hillocks others high mountaines
some likewise prosper in priuate places and growe neere to wals of townes and cities and some growe in old ruines
but it is to be noted that though each kinde of plants growe and prosper best in his proper ground and doth loue very much his owne naturall situation yet sometimes herbs are found indifferently in mountaines hillocks valleies fields and meadowes
likewise the industrie and trauell of man doth bring to passe that that which is strange becommeth domesticall yet not without some manifest difference between the pure naturall production and that which is caused by arte
moreouer the parts of plants are the roote the stocke

the branches the leaues the fruit the stalke the tufts called vmbellae the graines the seedes the flowers the the wood the barke the sinewes the inner pil the vaines the sap the pith the gum called lachryma the knot and many other small parcels which the curious obserue therein all which serue to distinguish trees and herbes one from another which parts are somewhat answerable to the parts of liuing creatures
for the roots seeme to agree with the bellie as theophrastus holdeth or else with the mouth as others maintaine who referre the lower part of the stocke to the bellie and the leaues haue some reference to the haire the barke to the hide and skin the wood to the bones the vaines to the vaines the matrice to some entrailes which cannot liue without the matrice the flowers to egges the seedes to seede the branches and boughes to the extreme parts of liuing creatures and the fruit to the menstruous blood wherein the seede is many times inclosed
moreouer the parts of parts are woorthie of consideration as those of the roote whose middle part is as it were of wood out of which the plant doth oftentimes bud and is therefore defended with greater strength
and therefore if this middle part bee taken out of garlicke that which remaineth is not so sharpe and of so strong sauour as before and it seemeth likewise to bee lesse full of iuice
next the second part is the rinde or coate which is very small and the third is the peele or huske and the fourth is the which enuironeth the huske which is not properly called so because it is ment for that which compasseth the seede of the fruit and the fruit it selfe and also because it contayneth that which enuironeth the wood in the root insteed of the seed
whereby it appeereth that they which cast away this part full of

wood when they make their decoctions do verie ill considering that it is the most excellent of all the rest and of greatest force

for that which produceth the seede that onely contayneth the whole vertue thereof because it alone hath life
that part then which is of wood seemeth to be the chiefe and principall substance of the medicine because that that thing onely which liueth produceth the seed in that part only wherein it hath life
for although that in succorie and such like herbes some leaues grow out of the barke yet the herbe it selfe and the seed doe proceed out of the wood
as the leaues then are in the stalke or slip so is the barke in the wood and both leaues and barke are therein for safegard thereof
in the lower part the iuice falleth into the roote by the middle part the roote is nourished and in the vppermost part it is conuerted into seed
wherefore the vppermost part of the roote is best and most different from the nature of earth
the flowers likewise haue their parts for there is a kinde of leafe in the flower which alwaies shineth and is in all flowers because it is made of a verie fine substance
the buddes likewise wherein the flowers are contayned are parts of them and the seede of which the flower springeth as it is cause of the generation thereof so is it a part of the flower

and so is the stalke or foote called pediculus in which all these things are as it were planted and adioyned thereto
let vs also note that amongst trees the old are of more subtile qualitie then the other
and euerie tree which beareth leaues all the yeere long is hot and drie as the palme tree the oliue tree the cedar the myrtle
but this reason is not auaileable in herbes for houseleeke is of a grosse substance and yet beareth leaues all winter
and indeed both in herbes and trees they which grow wilde abroad are better then the domesticall and so are they which are odoriferous much more then they which haue a badde sauour and haue no sent at all especially if they grow in mountaines and therefore they are preferred by phisitions before the other
and we must note that most commonly the roots smell better and are sweeter then the other parts of the plant except the flowers which is so because the concoction is best done in the rootes
for all things which haue the humour well boiled smell best for that humour is most subtile and close
for which cause all flowers almost doe smell well
for by reason that the humour which is in them is verie subtile and little it is the more easily concocted

therein and therefore also it sooner perisheth
but this humour remayneth and is preserued in the rootes and in the stocke for the subtile substance thereof being well concocted doth abide in the earthie substance

whereby we may learne why yoong folks haue sweeter breath then olde and distempered people
for children haue their humour verie subtile and the small humour may be verie well concocted in yoong folkes by the great heat which aboundeth in them
but want of heat hindreth it in olde folkes and the qualitie of the humour is hurt in those that are distempered causeth that the decoction cannot be performed
now we haue staide long enough in this discourse but as we haue distinguished plants into fower principall kindes let vs now speake of the nature and propertie of the most especiall among them to the ende that according to our intention we may not passe ouer any of the workes of god without producing some testimonies which may cause vs more and more to celebrate his diuine prouidence
then achitob begin you to entreate of trees

of trees and especially of the pine the the and the cedar
chap

achitob

it is doubtlesse that the difference of trees of one kinde is chiefly caused by the diuersitie of regions
and therefore amongst those trees that are transported from one place to another some do beare fruit as the palmes at genoa some also beare but vnperfectly as the at millaine
there are some that cannot grow as the wood of aloës brought out of india into italy and some beare perfect fruit bicause they can agree with the aire and with the soile as well of one countrey as of another as the vines transported out of spaine into india
but aboue all the calmenes of the aire and the answerablenes of the place are of great efficacy in the naturall propertie of trees do often cause them to beare great quantity of fruit and blossomes and are the cause that some are alwaies greene
and therefore about the grand cairo and in the countrey of elephants the leaues do neuer fall off the and vines and in the isles and other regions of the west

indies discouered by the spaniards there is neuer a tree but is alwaies greene
and therefore there are diuers trees both of one and of diuers kindes also higher greener and fairer to behold in one place then in another
for in hot and moist countries all plants grow greater fuller of iuice and greener

if the proper nature of the plant doe not hinder and in hot and drie places they are smaller and drier and yet of no lesse vertue but in moist and cold regions the plants are weake and full of sappe
and they which are hot by nature grow broad and high but the cold are small
now all trees whereof we now particularly entreat do by nature grow greatly for the most part and flourish a verie long time
as iosephus recordeth that abrahams oke did yet stand in his daies and there were betwixt the destruction of hierusalem and the death of abraham two thousand yeeres
and next to the oke the palme the beech the the elme and the do flourish longest

now will proceede to a particular description of some trees the most woorthie to bee considered of

amongst which the pine chalengeth the first place whereof there are two kindes one is domesticall and the other sauage
the domesticall kinde hath an infinite sort of branches vpon the verie vppermost toppe of the stocke which spread rounde about it being very thicke of leaues which are pointed in the end and long it beareth plentie of great and sounde apples wherein are certaine hard kernels inclosed as blacke as soote in which the fruite is founde being couered with a thinne yellow skinne easie to get off by pilling it with your fingers
and this fruite is sweete and pleasant in taste of a fatte and oylie substance
for the sauage or wilde one there are many sorts of them
some growe on mountaines others on the sea coast
they of the mountaines are of three kindes
for there are some that be highest of all the rest which abound in the forrests of bohemia silasia polonia and other places whereof the countrey men make pitch
which are euery whit like to the domesticall sort sauing that their apples bee lesse for they bee not much greater then those of cypresse but they are a little longer and more sounde and husked like those of the domesticall pine being full of gumme and of a sweete sent
the second kinde of these mountaine pines are such as haue no stocke or trunke but sprout their branches out of their roote close to the earth running along the

ground till they attaine to tenne or fifteene cubits length they beare fruite like vnto the other but of a bigger sise and fuller of gumme and are founde in many places of italy
finallie there are many other which are of goodly height and yet not so high as those of the first kinde neither haue they the barke of their stocks yellow like the other pines likewise their fruite is somewhat enclining towards red but more brittle then all the rest
and the kernels of them are three square and crooked and in taste somewhat like those of the garden pine sauing that they leaue a certaine quicke sharpenes in the mouth which is proper to all wilde trees and they abounde in the territorie of trent
and the gumme that proceeds out of all these sorts of pines is white and sweete
the sea pines are of two sorts differing onely in the greatnes and smalnesse of their fruite and do all of them produce white odoriferous gumme which turneth into a thinne liquor

whereof men make black pitch
moreouer as concerning the fruite of the pine in generall it is most certaine that therein are many great vertues properties and that it is very profitable for mans bodie
for it is of a moderate temperature but that it enclineth more towards heate
it ripeneth it mollifieth it resolueth it fatneth and it nourisheth well
it correcteth the humours which are corrupted in the intrailes neuerthelesse it is hard in digestion and therefore to such as are cold of nature the kernels are ministred with honie to such as are hot with sugar to correct the strength of those kernels
they do helpe being often eaten the paines of the sinewes and are good for those that be troubled with the sciatica palsie shaking and numbnes of members
they clense the lungs and the corruption of them purging out all clammie hummors and rottennes
they are profitable against the cough and the corruption of the reines and bladder wherefore they ease them much who pisse but drop by drop and feele their vrine burne
they fatten leane folkes and being taken with the iuice of purslaine they doe helpe eruptions of the stomacke
also the picked leaues of a greene pine being stamped and drunke with wine doe appease paines of the heart

but the patient must abstaine from all fat meates
of the scales that couer the pine apples being sodde in very sharpe vineger is made a singular perfume against the dysenteria
and the water of those apples verie greene being distilled through a limbecke doth wash out the

wrinckles of the face
moreouer of the oldest pines is pitch made which is called nauall by reason that it is very good to pitch ships which to do men cut downe the pines with an hatchet which are become full of gummie iuice and hewe them in peeces as they doe other trees to make coales of
whereupon let vs note that they which inhabite mountaines say that it is a maladie amongst pines when not onely the hart thereof but the outward part of the stocke doth conuert into a gummie substance which hapneth to them through great abundance of liquor which causeth them to die euen as too much fatte suffocateth liuing creatures
and out of this gummie woode is pitch by woondrous skill extracted and the oile and foote are separated which haue diuers properties in medicines

let vs now speake of the

which groweth vprightest of all the trees and therefore is very fitte to emploie in all workes there are such high ones that in sweden some are seene of an hundred foote in length and that of some which are straight and of a like thicknes euery where without knots men may make worke of an hundred and ten foote long
this tree beareth fruite of a spanne long composed of certaine scales being one compiled vpon another vnder which the white seede is included without any iuice in them
it produceth an exquisite liquor and gumme betwixt two barkes which is called in vulgar italian lagrimo that is the teare of the and it runneth vnder the first barke which being opened lies like the matter of an old impostume
this gumme is liquid of a very good smell and somewhat sharpe in taste
it is very good for greene wounds not onely bicause it searcheth them but also bicause it is mundificatiue and incarnatiue
being assumed in drinke it clenseth the reines of grauell and doth much asswage the paines of the goute and of the sciatica
it healeth marueilously well all wounds of the head so that no other thing be applied thereto

the cypresse is likewise rich in beautie and in properties

of which trees there are male and female the female growes alwaies pointed towards the top and the male hath his branches spred abroad
each of them is a very high tree straight and bearing branches onely in the toppe thereof
and this tree is driest of all others hauing the humor very fat and well digested
and therefore it agreeth not with dung and excrements and waxeth

drie neere to waters
the wood thereof is odoriferous and looseth not the sent by oldnes neither is eaten with wormes nor doth rot through any fault but the leaues of this tree beaten into powder and strowed amongst apparell or with the seede do defend them that wormes cannot annoy them
it beareth fruite three times a yeere which is hard and sound containing the seed within
it casteth out of the stocke some gum but very little like vnto turpentine and almost of the same nature
this tree is very common in italie
but the right and naturall countrie thereof is the isle of candie for in what place soeuer the ground be there remooued and tilled if nothing else be sowen therein the cypresse will presently spring vp of it selfe
the decoction of their nuts made in strong vineger asswageth the paine of the teeth if the mouth be often washed therewith
so much doth the decoction of the leaues
which nuts being stamped and drunke with old wine appease the ough
they are very good and the leaues also to search great wounds in tough bodies
whereby it appeereth that this tree hath the vertue to drie vp without much sharpnes and heate as the taste doth testifie
for one shall taste therein very little sharpnes much bitternesse and more sowernesse

the cedar also is a tree that groweth very big and beareth fruit almost like to that of the cypresse tree but a little bigger
there be some that beare no fruit although that they bud
and that which beareth fruit buddeth not and the new fruit appeereth thereupon before the old is perfectly ripe
out of this tree runneth an excellent white and liquid gum which in time is by heate of the sunne congealed into graines
in syria and especially in mount libanon the cedars grow very high and in great plentie and are very like to
their branches from the bottome to the top are almost spread and placed rounde about it in fashion like the spokes of a wheele and the highest are euermore shortest
wherefore this tree a far off seemeth to represent the figure of a pyramis
the hart or pith of the cedar is very hard sweete and red wherefore the ancients supposed that the wood could not weare nor become but would endure for euer
so salomon caused the holy temple of god in ierusalem to be builded thereof and the pagans made their statues of it thinking it would endure as long as marble or brasse
some say that the greatest which was euer seene was hewed

in cypresse to make the gallie of demetrius which had eleuen oares vpon a side
for it was one hundred and thirtie foote long and as thicke as three men might fadome
there are also in many places of greece two kindes of small cedars which are like to the iuniper tree
now all cedars are of nature hot and drie in the third degree and the oile which is made of their gum approcheth to the fourth degree and is very subtile
wherefore it doth easily and without paine rot soft and delicate flesh but in hard bodies it operateth with more time difficultie
it drieth dead bodies and preserueth them from putrifaction by consuming the superfluous humors without touching the sound parts but in liuing bodies the heate which consisteth in them doth augment the forces of this oile which causeth it to burne the tender flesh
wherefore hauing such vertue it is no maruell if it kill nits lice wormes and vermine in the eares and if being applied it killeth the childe in the mothers wombe and being dead doth void it out with many other effects which phisitions attribute vnto it
but commend to you aser the sequele of our discourse concerning trees

of trees bearing cinamon cassia frankincense myrrhe and cloues
chap

aser

the loue of ones natiue soile hath a maruellous power in all things for nature produceth in some places such stubborne plants that for any endeuor and paines which one may take with them yet can they not be retained or kept but in their owne proper ground
many great personages both in france and in italie haue taken paines to tame them and cause them to growe in gardens orchards and other most pleasant places as any in the world
but as rusticall mountainers despise the delights and gallantnes of cities and esteeme not of ciuilitie and honestie of manners not being able to liue any where at ease and pleasure but in their owne cottages so it seemeth that many plants which are brought amongst vs and husbanded with great care and labour despising the sweetnes of the aire the beautie of gardens the pleasant watring of fountaines and the goodly companie of infinite herbs and

trees already made familiar haue at last retired into their owne deserts and wildernesses and into the place of their originall
now of the number of these is the cinamon which though that whiles rome flourished as many authors record it was planted in diuers places yet now is there not any of it to bee founde throughout italie nay in all europe
but asia aboundeth therewith in many places yea so doth arabia foelix in diuers parts and much more india especially in one island called monorique the mountaines whereof beare plentie of

this tree is somewhat like to our laurell tree hauing many branches at the ende whereof it beareth very small blossomes which being dried by the heate of the sunne and fallen on the ground there is formed thereof a little round fruit not much bigger then an hasell nut out of the kernell whereof the islanders doe extract good oile wherewith the diseased doe rub their sinewes and other in parts
the king of monorique receiueth great pr through these trees for none may be permitted to touch them without his licence
and certaine moneths of the yeere he causeth some twigges and syons to be cut the smallest and finest that may bee in the tree and the barke of them to be peeled off which is sold very deere to such strangers as trafficke therein
for this is the best of the tree
but the cinamon which is brought hither is nothing else but the second barke that is peeled off which being cut with a little knife rowleth vp togither of it selfe

and changeth colour
moreouer the propertie of cinamon is to dry and heate to the third degree for it consisteth of very subtile partes and is very sharpe in taste and of a certaine quicke astriction by means whereof it taketh away and dissolueth the superfluities of the body fortifieth the members
there is a distilled water made of cinamon which is strong in smell and taste and is of great vertue
for take a pound of cinamon braie it and put it into a vessell with fower pound of and halfe a pound of white wine then set your vessel being very close stopped in warme water and then make your distillation in the same water being placed vpon a furnace wherein the fire is temperately maintained in such sort that the saide warme water do alwaies boile
and this distilled water is verie soueraigne against all diseases that come through colde for it dissolueth and consumeth fleame and clammie humors and chaseth away all windines
it doth especially comfort the stomack

the liuer the spleene the braine and the sinewes
it is a singular and present remedie against faintnesse of the hart against paines and prickings of the mouth and stomacke it resisteth poisons and bitings of venemous beasts it prouoketh vrine and the flowers in women it is good for those that haue short breath that are sicke of the palsie or haue the falling sicknes
and in a word when neede is to heat to open to pierce to resolue and to comfort this water is very profitable therefore

now let vs speake of the tree that beareth cassia

for it is in the number of the greatest and most singular trees
the woode thereof is massiue close of the colour of boxe neere the barke and blacke in the midst like ebonie
when it is greene it hath a bad smell but this sauour doth weare away being drie
it beareth certaine cods which hang vpon the branches verie long round and massiue which being ripe waxe blacke and somewhat reddish
and they are full of a soft and blacke sappe like to thicke creame not sticking altogither like marrow in a bone but is contained as it were in little cases being one separated from another by thinne skins set very close togither betwixt euery one of which there is a very hard graine
in egypt and in india are very many of these cassia trees and in the isle of taprobana
their cods are not very great but cleare heauie and verie full in such sort that if they be shaken one cannot heare the graines rattle therein and these are the best
the sappe or iuice of them is hot and moist in the thirde degree

it is lenitiue and loosening and purifieth the bloud
it stancheth heat of choler and doth moderately loosen the belly
it is marueilous profitable for those that cannot make water especially if it be vsed with medicines that prouoke vrine
it purgeth choler and fleame and mollifieth the breast and the throate and resolueth inflammations therein it clenseth the raines from grauell and sand if it bee drunke with the decoction of licor as and other simples fit to prouoke vrine and if it be often taken it hindreth the stone in the raines
besides all this it is good against hotte agues and being outwardly applied it asswageth inflammations

amongst aromaticall trees the tree that beareth frankincense is woorthie to be considered of

the forme thereof is somwhat like to a pine and out of it runs a liquor that afterwardes waxeth hard which we call frankincense whereof there are two

sorts
one sort is gathered in sommer in the in the greatest burning heate of the yeere at which time the barke is split being then fullest of moisture
and this frankincense is whitish transparent and pure
the other kinde is gathered in the spring time by meanes of another incision which is made in this tree in winter and it is somewhat redde approching nothing neere either in goodnes or value or else in waight or vertue to the first
arabia hath many forrests wherein frankincense is found
and the inhabitants of the countrey do lance the trees with a knife to cause them distill gumme the better or else the liquor whereof it is made

amongst which trees there are some that may yeeld aboue threescore pounds euery yeere
moreouer being taken in drinke it is very good against dysenterias and fluxes of the bellie
it encreaseth the memorie chaseth awaie sadnes reioiceth the hart is profitable for all the passions therof
it also staieth the bleeding at nose being incorporated with the white of an egge and aloes and put into the nosthrils in a tent
it likewise appeaseth the paines of the megrim being mixed with myrrh and glaire of an egge and applied to the forehead and temples
it is also hot in the second degree and drie in the first and hath some astriction which is but little founde in that which is white

let vs speake of myrrhe which groweth abundantly in the same regions where frankincense doth
the tree which beareth it is full of prickles in some places being of fiue or sixe cubites high very hard and crooked and thicker then the frankincense tree the barke smooth like a laurell tree and the leaues like those of the oliue tree but rougher hauing certaine sharpe prickles at the end
out of this tree there distilleth a gummie liquor like teares which hardneth by little and little and is of colour somewhat greene and is cleere and sweete though somewhat vnpleasant in taste through bitternes
whereby it appeereth that the myrrh which heere we haue is not right for all these markes are not found therein but it is blacke and as if it were scorched mouldie and mossie on the outside
which wee neede not thinke strange considering that euen in alexandria where our men do commonly buie myrrh there is scarce any to be gotten which is not sophisticate
for the arabian mahumetans who bring it thither and sell it doe therein vse a thousand deceits mocking at such christians as traffike with them and at their

curiositie
there is great difference then betwixt natural myrrh which distilleth out of the tree and artificiall being sophisticated with gum and mixed with other things

such as is ordinarie in our apothecaries shops
now the right myrrh is of hot and drie qualitie in the second degree and being drunke it is verie profitable for those that haue the quartaine ague
it is vsed in antidotes against poisons against hurts by venemous beasts and against the plague
and being applied to wounds in the head it will heale them

let vs now speake of the tree that beareth cloues

which groweth in the southeast countries in certaine isles of the indian sea
the stocke thereof is like to that of a boxe tree and so is the wood
it flourisheth almost like to a and the fruit groweth in this manner
at the ende of euerie little branch there doth first appeere a budde which produceth a flower or blossome of purple colour afterwards by little little the fruit is formed and commeth to that passe as we behold it being red when it groweth out of the bloome but by heat of the sunne it waxeth blacke afterwards in such sort as it is brought hither
the inhabitants of the countrey especially of the isles of molucca doe plant and set almost in the same manner as we in europe do our vines
and that they may preserue this fruit and spice a long time they make pits in the earth wherein they put the cloues till such time as merchants come to carry them away
this tree is full of branches and beareth many blossomes white at first afterwards greene and at last red
the people there shake and beat the vppermost boughes of the tree hauing first made cleane the place vnderneath for no herbe groweth neere about it because it draweth all the moisture of the earth to it selfe
and the cloues so shaken downe are put to dry two or three daies and are then shut vp till they be sold
that cloue which sticketh still fast to the tree doth waxe great yet differeth not from the rest except in oldnes though some haue held opinion that the greatest are of the male kinde
this tree springeth of it selfe out of one onely corne of a cloue which hath fallen on the ground and it indureth an hundred yeeres as the inhabitants report
the vertue of cloues is verie great
for they are good for the liuer

the stomacke and the heart
they helpe digestion and binde the fluxe of the belly
they cleere the sight consume and take away the webbe and cloudes in the eies
they heat and drie to

the third degree they strengthen and open both together and are verie piercing
being beaten to powder and drunke with wine or the iuice of quinces they stay vomitings cause lost appetite to returne fortifie the stomacke and the head
they heat verie well a cold liuer
and for this cause they are ministred verie profitably to such as haue the dropsie especially to those who haue water spread throughout all their bodie
the smell of them fetcheth those againe that haue swouned and being chawed they sweeten the breath
they are good for such as are troubled with the falling sicknes with the palsie and with the lethargie
being eaten or taken in perfume they preserue from the plague and are verie commodious for such as are subiect to catarrhes and for such as are stuffed in the nose if they receiue the smoke thereof into their nosthrils
in briefe their vse is infinitely diuers profitable both in phisicke and in our ordinarie diet whereby we restore nature
and sith we are in this talke let it be your part amana to entreat of other trees bearing spices

of trees and plants that beare nutmegs ginger and pepper
chap

amana

amongst fiue kinds of nuts which the earth produceth to wit the common nut the nut of india nux metella nux vomica and the nutmeg this is the most singular and of rarest vertue which hath taken name from muske by reason of the sweete and pleasant sent thereof
now they who haue trauelled into india make great report

that the trees which beare nutmegs do abundantly grow in an isle named banda and in many other isles of the moluccaes and that it is as great and as long branched as a with vs and that there is but small difference in the growing of nutmegs and of common nuts
moreouer this fruit is at first couered with two barks whereof the outtermost is hairie or mossie vnder which is a thinne bloome which like a net or fillet doth embrace and couer the nut is like a skaule or coife called mace whereof there is great account made and it is reckoned amongst the most pretious and rarest spices which we plainly see in those nutmegs that are brought whole from the indies

being preserued in sugar or in iuice of carrouges
the other bark which couereth the nutmeg is like the shell of an hasell nut out of which they take it to bring vnto vs which is verie easie to doe by reason that the time of ripening being come this hard shell openeth and sheweth an inward rinde that enuironeth the nut about which we call as aforesaid mace which at that time appeereth as red as skarlet but when the nut is drie it turnes yellowish is thrise as deere as the nuts themselues
that which is more to be admired in this tree is that it beareth the fruit therof being so excellent naturally without any industrie or husbandrie of man
moreouer the best nuts are the newest not rotten the heauiest fullest most oylie abounding in moisture so that if one thrust a needle thereinto there doth presently some iuice issue
they are hot and drie in the second degree and restrictiue
they make sweet breath being chewed

and take away all stinking smell thereof
they cleere the sight strengthen the stomacke and liuer abate the swelling of the spleene prouoke vrine stay the fluxe of the bellie driue away ventositie and are maruellous good against cold diseases in the wombe
in summe they haue the same vertues that cloues haue
and when they are greene or new being bruised and well heated in a vessell and then put into a presse there issueth a licour which being cold is congealed like to new waxe and smelleth passing sweete and is very excellent for olde griefes of the sinewes and ioints engendred through cold

now speake we of ginger and other spices

which for the most part growe in the same regions of asia and especially in the indies and where nutmegs abound
in them there is great quantitie of ginger which is a roote not of such a plant as may properly be called a tree but rather an herbe considering that it groweth not very high but beareth leaues like a cane or reede which doe wax greene twise or thrise a yeere
this roote is very knottie and not aboue three or fower spans deepe in the ground and sometimes so big that it waigheth a pound
they that dig vp these rootes do alwaies leaue a space between two knots in the pit and couer it againe with earth as being the seede of this plant to receiue the fruit thereof the next ensuing yeere that is the rootes which shall be newly sprouted
in calecut the greene ginger is steeped and conserued in sugar or in a kinde of honie that is taken out of certaine cods or husks and is

conuaied into italie where it is much more esteemed then that of venice
for that which is there is made of dry roots artificially mollified

and which want much of their vertue and power
moreouer ginger is very profitable for it helpeth digestion it looseneth the belly moderately it is good for the stomacke and profitable against all things that may dim or blinde the sight
it heateth much not at first tasting like pepper
for which cause we may not thinke it to consist of so subtile parts the heat would else presently declare it selfe and it would suddenly become hot in act
wherupon ginger is knowne to be composed of a grosse and indigested substance not drie and earthie but moist and watrie which is the cause that it doth easily corrupt and rot to wit by reason of the superfluous moisture thereof
for such things as are very drie or moistned by a digested naturall and moderate humiditie are not subiect to corruption and rottennesse
thence also it proceedeth that the heate which commeth of ginger doth endure longer then that of pepper
for as drie stubble is soone on fire and soone burnt out euen so is the heate that proceedeth from simples and drie drugs
but that which issueth from moist ones as out of greene wood doth inflame slowlier and endure longer

pepper doth grow abundantly in the indies especially in the two isles called the greater lesser iaua it doth grow vpo little trees the leaues whereof resemble much the leaues of a the fruit whereof is no greater then a ball
and according to the diuers places where pepper groweth it is different in kinde yea in one place there are diuers sorts and chiefly round long pepper
now in some isles as alongst the riuer ganabara when the inhabitants plant pepper they burie the roote thereof neere to some other fruit trees and oftentimes neere to yoong palmes or date trees vpon the top whereof the twigs or syons doe at length growe
which the rods and small branches puld from pepper trees doe likewise being planted with the same trees which they imbrace running to the very top of them where the pepper hangs in clusters like the grapes of a wilde vine but closer and thicker
and when it is ripe they gather it and lay it in the sunne to drie vpon lattises made of palme trees till such time as it become blacke and wrinkled which is commonly done in three daies
and this pepper is round
but the trees that beare long pepper do differ from the rest especially in leaues and fruit

for the leaues are sharper at the end and the pepper hangeth vpon the tree like clusters of nuts made and heaped with many little graines
there is yet another kinde of pepper called ethiopian pepper or pepper of the negros which groweth in cods like beanes or pease and the graines thereof are a little lesse then those of blacke pepper
moreouer all pepper is hot in the fourth degree and therefore it burneth and blistereth the bodie so that the vse thereof cannot but be dangerous though it haue many secret properties against the quiuerings and shakings that accompanie feuers which vsually come to one and against the cough and all maladies of the breast
there is also a kinde of watrie pepper which groweth neere to slowe waters that runne but softly
the stalke thereof is knottie massiue hauing many pits out of which the branches doe growe
the leaues of it are like to mints sauing that they be greater softer and whiter
the seede is sharpe and strong and groweth vpon little twigs neere to the leaues in manner of grapes
it is so named of the places where it groweth and the likenes of taste which it hath with common pepper
but we haue spoken ynough concerning spices
let vs now consider of other most rare and singular trees the woonder whereof declareth the author of nature to be exceeding admirable as we may note aram by your discourse

of the of the baratha or tree of india of the gehuph and of brasill
chap

aram

those portugals spanyards and some frenchmen that in our time haue nauigated through the atlanticke sea towards the south and from thence towards the cast vnto calicut taprobana and other isles of the indian sea and regions vnknowne to ancient cosmographers doe make credible report vnto vs of so many diuers singularities which they haue beheld that we should be too vngratefull towards them if so often as we behold any of them in their writings we should not attribute praise vnto them for their laudable curiositie which hath vrged them to such discoueries considering that they are like so many mirrors to represent vnto vs that great architect of nature who amongst the very barbarians

hath engrauen images of himselfe in euery work of his omnipotencie
now among such trees as they haue written of and which as mee seemeth are worthie of greatest admiration although they bee not altogither so rare as many others the require place which are very common in arabia egypt and almost in all parts of africa and in iudaea as likewise in many isles of greece and regions of europe where they beare no fruit

which is not so throughout all africa for the palmes or beare in many places a sweete pleasant and very delicate fruit to eat and this tree is very high and hath the stock thereof very hard bearing no branches but round about the top with the ends of them hanging downe to the
it buddeth forth many blossomes hanging at certaine fine small stalkes clustred togither in figure like to clusters of saffron but much lesse and white and of those are formed reddish dates which haue a very hard long and crested stone within them
and there are of these trees male and female which are discerned in that the femall buddeth without blossomes

or flowers
and that which is most admirable in this diuersitie of kinde is that the female beeing separated from the male will hang downe hir branches and wither turning hir selfe that way whither her male hath beene caried so that the inhabitants of the countrie fearing to loose hir take of the earth and of the root of the male which they lay about the foot of the female who through this meanes springeth reneweth strength and beareth fruit
it is noted in that there are some which naturally follow the sun which way so euer he turneth as many other plants do which hauing a sympathy and secret inclination to this star as acknowledging his virtue and that their vigour is deriued from him do alwaies behold him they themselues loosing colour when hee is far off from them
and this is also very wonderfull in the date tree that beeing dead it reuiueth of it selfe by meanes of the proper rootes thereof which beeing very deepe vnder ground maintained by the radicall humour there do at length spring out of them certaine stalkes which are afterwards sustained by the sun there nourished and made trees

bearing fruit as before
moreouer out of the trunck of many people especially the negroes do extract a licour which they vse for beuerage in stead of wine by making a large slit therein with a certaine instrume~t a foot or two aboue the earth
and this licour is of the colour

of whay very good to drinke and almost asmuch inebriating or as strong as wine for which cause it must bee very oftentimes mixed with water
and when it runneth out of the stock it is as sweete as new wine but it looseth that sweetenes from day to day becomming more pleasant to drinke when it tasteth somewhat more tart because it doth then slake thirst best
they also draw out of this tree certaine threeds as fine as our threed

wherof they make tapistrie worke which serue like other things to couer them which neede not seeme verie strange considering that in many other places they beat the barkes of some trees so hard after they haue wet it that they do draw it out so fine and weaue it so artificially as one would suppose it to be some faire and thin taffata
such as haue sailed to manicongo and along the coast of ethiopia do assure vs thereof in their writings
for if that cotton commeth from trees and silke is spunne by wormes as all men know what should hinder the foresaid things to be of such ability through the ordinance of god established in nature to the end that men might receiue from these plants that which is needfull for them and which they cannot obtaine by the meanes that are common to others but if any make doubt therof because it is not notoriously known vnto all then must we shut the doore against al things that seeme rare
but what shal we say to that which is taught vs by many graue authors that of the fruit of these trees called the thebane date being dried in the sun til such time as it may be ready to be grou~d

men vse to make bread which is a common practise amongst those of that countrey moreouer for the particular vertues and properties of dates they are so much different

as there bee diuers kindes of them for some are drie and binding as those of egypt others are soft moist and sweete as those that grow in syria palestina and iericho
and the rest are in meane betwixt these two kinds and all are hard in digestion and breed headach
some say that two greene dates hauing their stones taken out and then filled vp with powder of vermilion being eaten doe keepe women with child that they may not abort and that being dried they be good to eate by such as spit blood to such as haue a weake stomacke and are troubled with the bloodie fluxe

now let vs speake of a tree

that doth much resemble the and is no lesse woorthie of woonder then it because it serueth for bread wine oyle and vineger
this tree is called by

the arabians baratha and of some iansialindi which is as much to say as the indian tree and the indians name it trican and the fruit thereof nihor or cocco
it is found in many ilands of india chiefly in zamat and in the circumiacent isles where the people liue vpon the fruit of this tree which fruit is as big as a mans head and is that which we terme an indie nut
the outtermost barke of this tree is all greene and aboue two fingers thicke amongst which they finde certaine fillets whereof they make cords wherewith the inhabitants of the countrey sowe their boats together
within this barke is another which they burne and beat to dust afterwards they vse this powder as a medicine for their sicke
vnder this second barke againe is a certaine white pith couered which is about a finger thicke and this they eate in stead of bread with flesh and fish
and to make it the better they dry it first and then bring it into meale and make verie good bread thereof as the ancients in old time made of acornes and of chestnuts for want of corne
in the midst of this pith they finde a verie cleere sweete and cordiall water which being curdled and conuerted into an oylie substance they boyle it and then this mixture becomes so fat as the best butter that can be made amongst vs
but if they would haue vineger they set this water in the sunne without making it to boyle and it will become cleere and sharpe and as white as milke
for their drinking liquor it runs out of the branches in great abundance
and two of these trees suffice for the nourishment of an whole family
furthermore their fruit is hot in the second degree and moist in the first

there is oyle drawen out of it verie good against the hemorrhoides and which healeth the paines of the reines and of the knees and purgeth the bellie of wormes
this bringeth also mens bodies into a good fat estate and restoreth leane and consumed persons

in the isles of the malucoes especially in taprobana doth likewise growe a tree of a meruailous propertie and effect which is named in their language gehuph and of the indians cobban it groweth very high but the leaues thereof are small
the barke is all yealow and the fruit big and round like a ball hauing a nut enclosed within it wherein is found a meruailous bitter kernell the tast whereof vpon the toung doth neere approach to the sauour of the fruit is very good to staunch thirst the kernell for all it is so bitter doth much surpasse it in sweetenes

through the excellency thereof
for they of the country do make an oyle which they keepe carefully because it is very good against the paine of the liuer and spleene whether it be taken inwards or outwardly applied to the diseased part
they keepe them also from the crampe
this tree likewise yeeldeth a certaine gum whereof they vse plaisters against all paines of their members

but amongst many singular trees found out in our daies in the south in the wilde country that is one which doth serue to die with which hath beene a great commodity to merchaunts and a meanes of new voyages for such as had accustomed to go to sea who entring into those countries when they beheld the sauages decked with many faire plumes of diuers colours and that they had their bodies likewise diuersly painted they made inquirie by what meanes they became so coloured

who shewed them a certaine tree which wee name brasill and the sauages call orauoutan
this tree is very faire to looke vpon hauing the outter rinde of grayish colour and the wood within red and especiallie the hart which is the most excellent part of all the tree and therewith merchants do chiefly furnish themselues
this tree hath leaues like the box tree as small but thicker and fuller and alwaies greene and it beareth not any fruit or gumme
that which groweth in the land of morpion and at cabo frio is better then any other
and there also is great store and quantitie of other trees seruing for tincture and euery one of a sundry colour
one is so red that it imitateth in fresh colour the finest scarlet of the world
another hath the inside so yealow as nothing can bee seene to approach neerer the pure colour thereof
some are all black and others reddish and there are some of so faire a purple colour as the ancients neuer vsed fairer
moreouer there is found a tree as white as fine paper meruailous faire and very pleasant to behold which might haue beene very good in times past to make tablets to write in then when men were ignorant of the vse of paper
in fine wee haue no colour bee it simple or compound whereof there bee not some trees to represent it naturally in the country of sauages
but heere let vs leaue strange trees and speake somewhat of our ordinary trees
and because that the history of them were sufficient to make vp a very great volume wee will content our selues to consider vpon a few of such as shall seeme to vs most fit for our purpose that wee may conclude

the discourse of this day and of this matter togither as you achitob shall presently performe

because that and doe prosper best in an hot and moist aire in a thin tender soile neere to the sea side and where moisture aboundeth they doe not onely abound in our europe but also in many places of asia and africa and in the isles of the sauages which haue beene discouered in our daies
now these three kinde of trees haue like agreeablenes of nature and do resemble each other in propertie and vertue

and therefore require one manner of culture
the is as great as the and and the leaues thereof are alwaies greene differing little or nothing from those of the being all of them pierced thorough with such little holes that they can scarce be discerned
the branches therof be flexible clad with a greene bark thorny
it beareth blossomes somewhat purple of the fashion of a bell hauing some fillets hanging in the midst of them they haue fruit at all times
for whe the ripe citrons fal there be others that wax ripe others that begin to bud
but there is verie great difference in this fruit both in bignes and in taste
for there are some as big as melons as those are vpon the coast of genoa in the isles of the adriaticke and egean seas
some are a little lesse others are as great as limons or a little greater as are those of the lake of garda which are better with meate then all the rest and taste more pleasa~tly
and for the biggest being not so good to eat because they haue more substance they are fit for apothecaries to conserue them in sugar or in honie
all of them beare the colour of gold they are long like limons hauing a thicker rinde wrinkled without and of a sweete smell
they haue a sharpe pith within full of iuice in which the graine is hidden in figure like to barley cornes being couered with an hard peele and of bitter taste
they grow all the yeere long and are gathered when they be yellow
moreouer these trees are nourished by the

south winde but are annoied by northerne blasts
they are sowed in their graines and planted in twigs boughes and graffes

the propertie of their fruit is to resist poisons which their graine doth chiefly effect
and the decoction of citrons doth sweeten the breath if one wash his mouth with it
being put whole into chests with apparell they doe not onely cause them to smell sweete but doe also defend them from moths
if they be eaten rawe they are of hard digestion and ingender grosse humors but hauing beene confected in honie or sugar they heate the stomacke well and fortifie it
they are good against melancholie and all maladies proceeding thereof
the graine is especially good against the stinging of serpents being taken in drinke and applied outwardly
their sharpe iuice doth represse choler and is very good against the plague by meanes whereof phisitions doe happily vse the sirrope which is made of it against pestilent feuers
likewise the sharpe and drie qualitie ruleth in the iuice of citrons and therefore it is drie and cold in the third degree but the rinde thereof is drie with much bitternesse so that it is drie in the second degree not cold but temperate a little differing from the meane
their meate is of grosse and flegmaticke substance and their kernell bitter and loosening heating and drying in the second degree
if a citron be boiled whole in rose water and sugar till such time as it be all consumed into iuice and if one take euery morning to the quantitie of a spoonefull of this iuice it will be a soueraigne preseruatiue against the plague

limons also haue the very same propertie and their iuice killeth the itch of the bodie it clenseth the spots thereof

destroieth wormes taketh away pimples in the face killeth wormes in the bellie and being mingled with sirrope it is singular good against hot and contagious feuers
this same iuice is of so strong and pearsing vertue that if you powre it out twise or thrise fresh and wash whole pearles therewith steeping them in it and afterwards expose them to the sunne they will within fiue or six daies become as soft as honie in such sort that you may fashion them how you list
likewise if you steepe for certaine howers golde therein it wil diminish in waight
in briefe limons doe not much differ from the vertue and nature of citrons but they are commonly somewhat lesse longer and not of so thicke a rinde fuller of iuice sharper in taste almost alike in seede of colour pale

oranges are more round and being ripe they haue a very

orient golden colour

their peele is thicker then that of limons and more bitter
the iuice within whereof they be full is not in all of one taste for some are sweete some sower and some tart
are alwaies greene like
they haue leaues like laurell broad thicke smooth sweete and pointed
their branches likewise are flexible pricklie and couered with a greene whitish coloured barke
their blossomes are white of a very excellent smell and are diligently gathered by perfumers where there is any quantitie for the composition of perfumes
some also distill water of them not onely for the excellencie of the smell thereof but also to serue in medicine especially against pestilent feuers which cause blisters
being taken in drinke it is very profitable when neede requireth to haue infected humors euacuated out of the inner part of the bodie to the outtermost part by sweatings for this water doth cause much sweating and doth greatly comfort the hart
the peele of oranges is hotter sharper and bitterer in taste then that of citrons and limons
and sweete oranges are hot in all parts but the iuice of all others is cold and resisteth corruption
wherefore they are good against feuers which the sweete are not
moreouer their iuice pressed out of the rinde doth easily inflame and doth also penetrate through great tenuitie within a glasse euen to the wine therein contained

the also is excellent amongst trees and doth require a warme and temperate aire as is that of prouence
it is planted of twigs faire and fruitful yoong branches pulled from off the boughes of the tree being very thicke and of a foote and halfe long
haue long pointed leaues thicke smooth greene aboue and whitish vnderneath bitter in taste and somewhat sharpe
they bud in iulie and haue white flowers hanging in clusters out of which grow the fruit greene at first and as they ripen paler then waxe they purple and at last turne blacke
they are gathered in the latter moneths of the yeere being no sooner ripe
they are strowed vpon the floore till such time as they become wrinckled
afterwards they are ground and then put into the presse with hot water and so they yeeld their oile
the wood of the is faire full of veines speckled massie and burneth as well greene as drie
it is in no wise subiect to vermine especially so long as it is planted bicause of the odour thereof which is strong yea it defendeth all other plants therefrom

which are neere vnto it as likewise through the bitternesse thereof it causeth cabbages and lettuse to die and all other moist herbes which are sowed in the plot with it

oliues are gathered for two occasions either that oile may be extracted out of them or that they may be reserued for bankets wherein they are serued to excite the appetite but all kindes of oliues doe not serue indifferently for these two vses for the greatest are best to eate and the least to drawe oile out of
they which are kept for feasts are conserued in brine and salted vineger in such sort as they retaine their naturall verdure
for the propertie of the oliue it hath in it a very restringent vertue for the decoction of the leaues in a clyster staieth the flux of the bellie and the iuice pressed out of the leaues with white wine and raine water restraineth all manner of bloodie flixe
the licour which distilleth out of the greene wood as it burneth healeth the itch tetters and ringwormes
new oliues being eaten prouoke the appetite and get a good stomacke although they harden the bellie
being very ripe they are moderately hot otherwise they are more binding and cooling
the oile that is extracted out of oliues is of singular vertue being either applied outwardly or taken inwardly according to the indisposed parts of the bodie it looseneth and mollifieth the bellie dulleth the malice of poysons and doth subtilly driue them away yea if any venim or burning happen on the skin of the bodie and begin to make an vlcer or sore there nothing is better to heale this hurt then to annoint it with new fresh oile of oliues

the pomegranate tree also is to bee no lesse esteemed of

then the forenamed trees because of the excellency of the fruit thereof
the leaues of it resemble those of the of a colour very thick and full of many red strakes hanging by a red stalke
the branches are pliable and full of prickles
the blossomes red and open like bels the mouth of them cut in fashion of a star out of which proceede thinne red leaues with certaine small seedes hanged by the midst like them in a rose
the fruit is couered with a rinde like vnto leather red without and yealow within full of infinite pointed graines red full of a iuyce with a stone in them
and these graines are separated one from another with maruailous cunning of nature by fine thin yealow skinnes
moreouer there are three sorts of pomegranates sweete sharpe and winie
and the qualitie of

them all is restringent but not alike
for by their tast you may iudge of their difference
and their graines are more binding drying then their iuice the rinde more then the graines and the blossomes haue the same virtue with the fruit
and the powder of a pomegranate dryed in an ouen in a new earthen pot close stopped beeing taken in drinck is maruailous singular to stay the flux of the bellie
the leaues also of a pomegranate tree well beaten or the iuice of them mixed with oile of roses doth verie much ease inueterated paines of the head beeing often laide to the forehead
the boughes of this tree do chase away venemous beasts for which cause the ancients were wont to lay them ouer and vnder their beds
the decoction of the root beeing drunck doth also kill great wormes in the belly and doth void them out
now haue wee said enough concerning trees for the subiect by vs vndertaken to morrow wee will discourse of the most singular hearbes and rootes to the end that in each sort of all kindes of creatures wee may haue somewhat wherein to acknowledge in the chiefest manner the infinite power and vnspeakeable bountie of him who hath made all these things for the vse of man
it shalbe then your charge aser to begin to entreate concerning simples

chapter

aser
the knowledge of symples hath alwaies beene had in such estimation amongst the ancients that many great monarchs both grecians and romaines although they were much troubled in the gouernment of their estates haue neuerthelesse studied how to obtaine this science and to illustrate it
for indeed it is not onely pleasant and delectable but also verie profitable and necessarie
and for this cause they haue been much commended who haue diligently written bookes concerning plants and concerning the vertues of them
and surely we are not a little beholding to their diligence by reason of the commodities that doe thereby redound vnto vs daily for the maintenance of our health which is the thing most to be desired of vs in all the world
for so much then as we haue so many goodly volumes amongst vs that all persons may thereby with small trauell become learned in this part of phisicke which is abundantly therein entreated of we wil satisfie our selues to passe away this day in discoursing onely concerning the most singular herbes and rootes which wee could therein note and as we yet do beare in memorie

all herbes may be diuided into two kindes one is vnder the name of the other of although in verie truth there is in all of them yea in many of those which are most common verie apt and proper vertues for the aide and maintenance of health and healing of diseases
but omitting those which are vsed in common foode and which are well knowen to euerie man we will onely speake of the most excellent in propertie in respect of their maruellous effects in the nature of men
amongst which although mallowes be verie common yet

are they woorthie of consideration

and we read that the ancients did sow this plant in their gardens of deliberate purpose for in those daies they did eat them like other ordinarie herbes
and euen to this day in italy they are so well ordered by the gardiners that they will grow as big as a shrub yea in sixe or seuen moneths
we neede not make heere a particular description of mallowes for there is none but knoweth them well enough but their vertue is verie admirable for their leaues sod being eaten do take away all hoarsenes and being powned with sage leaues they make a singular plaister for wounds other inflamations they are also very good against bitings of venemous beasts being applied with leekes and onions and the iuice of them dropt in ones eare appeaseth the tingling therein
being sod rootes and all till such time as the decoction bee all verie thicke and clammie they are giuen to women to drinke who are deliuered of their children with great difficultie which helpes them much and the iuice drunke to the quantitie of halfe a pound waight doth profit them as much
their seed also drunke with red wine doth deliuer one from all desire to vomit
and their yoong and tender stalkes being eaten with salt vineger oyle as sparage also are verie healthfull laxatiue
sixe ounces of their iuice being drunke is verie good for melancholie people and for
in briefe the mallow is verie profitable in many things and was for that cause called by the ancients omnimorbia that is to say good against all diseases

the wilde mallowe hath no fewer properties and was therefore called by the greekes althaea as beeing singular amongst all simples and fit for many medicines the vse thereof beeing very ordinarie in phisick and it is a common hearbe knowne by euery one
beeing sod in wine or in honied water or beaten and applied alone it is good for all wounds against the kings euill against wormes in the eare impostumes inflammation of the breast rupture of the fundament ventosities and shrincking of the sinewes for it resolueth ripeneth breaketh and healeth
the leaues thereof incorporated with oile are good to applie to all bitings and burnings by fire the seede and root of this plant haue the same operation with the leafe but they are more subtile and more drying and abstersiue
the seede is good against the dysenteria against spitting of bloud and flux of the bellie and so also is the decoction of the root
and both of them serue

greatly for difficultie in making water for grauell in the bodie and do breake the stone in the reines
must not faile here to remember amongst the most excellent herbes the purple violet

for because of the admirable virtues which it containeth
will not speake of the rare beautie of the flower thereof nor of the sweete and pleasant smell thereof though it bee to be maruailed at
but wee may affirme it to bee as excellent and singular a medicine as may bee found in any part of the world
for violets are temperate and very good to alter and change the ill qualitie of humors and to euacuate them
they chiefly purge choler and qualifie the vehemencie thereof
they are good for paines in the head which proceede from heat they cause sleepines mollifie the pricking of the brest and of the lunges they are profitable against the squinancie against the falling of the pallet in the mouth they chiefly serue against inflammations of the breast and of the side and staunch thirst
being dry they open the liuer cause inflammations to cease and are very fit against the iaundise
moreouer the iuice of violets and the sirup that is made of them mollifie the bellie and they bee good to vse in pleurisies to purge
and if any one receiue a blow vpon the head he shalbe kept from dizzines and other greater inconueniences if soone after he is stroken he drinke the flowers of violets brayed and vse this drinke for some time
it is also a singular and gentle purgation and of no lesse virtue then cassia if you drinke so much of the infusion of the roots of violets in white wine as you canne hold in foure fingers after they haue beene beaten in a morter beeing steeped a whole night in wine and afterwards strained through a cleane linnen cloth which drinke you may sweeten by putting sugar therein
this secret was taught me by a learned phisition of our time and haue oftentimes seene the experience thereof

betonie is likewise an hearb that is stored with many great virtues and properties
for which cause the italians

when they would highly praise any one say in a common prouerb tuhai piu virtu che non ha la betonica thou art endewed with more virtues then betonie is
this herb hath a small stalke and in many places is found of a cubit in height hauing leaues like an oake soft long cut round about of sweete smell great neere to the roote and the seed thereof at top of the stalke lookes like that of sauorie
now for the propertie of this plant the leaues thereof

brayed and layde to wounds in the head doe presently search them and healing them from day to day it is not long ere they fortifie the hurt part
being beaten and applied to the forehead they heale the paine of the eies which likewise the decoction of the root doth being sod in water til one third part be co~sumed if you wash your eies therewith
the iuice of the leaues being drunke doth purge downwards that blood the great abundance whereof doth dazzle and dimme the sight
wherefore betonie being eaten doth sharpen and clarifie it
and being beaten with a verie little salt and put into the nosthrils it stancheth bleeding at the nose
and the warme iuice being distilled with oyle of roses and put into the eares doth asswage the paine of them
the vse of this herbe is verie profitable for those which are pained at the stomacke and haue short breath who spit corruption who haue paine in their liuer and spleene and are troubled with running of the raines it prouoketh vrine easeth the gnawing of the bellie and guttes if it proceede not from encreasing of humours and is verie good against dropsies breaketh the stone stayeth the spitting of blood and taken fasting keepeth from drunkennes being drunke often with wine it healeth the iaundise refresheth those that haue trauelled farre sharpneth the appetite resisteth poysons venims and bitings of serpents and all other venemous and mad beasts being not onely taken inwardly but also applied outwardly to the wounds
in summe this plant hath so many properties therein that a verie learned phisition amongst the ancients hath written a whole booke thereof

ceterach hath many vertues of betonie it groweth on wals and olde ruines and vpon rockes and in shadie places
it hath neither stalke flower nor seed but hath many leaues growing out of a roote which are cut like those of mountaine polipodie red and hairie vnderneath and greene aboue
the decoction of this herbe is good for all melancholie passions it consumeth spleene is profitable for those that can hardly make water breaketh the stone in the bladder and is good for them that haue the iaundise
some bray ceterach leaues to lay them hauing beene steeped in wine vpon the spleene which serueth well for to open it
the yealow powder which is found behinde those leaues being drunke with a little white amber and with the iuice of plantaine or of purslaine is maruellous profitable for those that are

troubled with running of the reines

saint also is a verie excellent herbe
it is full of branches of a span in height reddish bearing a leafe like to rue

hauing a yealow flower like to a violet which being rubbed betwixt the fingers yeeldeth iuice as red as blood
this plant is called millepertuis or thousand holes because the leaues of it are all full of so small holes that one can scarce see them but onely betwixt their sight and the sun
it beareth seed in rough round and somewhat long huskes
this herbe hath power to open resolue search and binde againe
it heateth and drieth and is of subtile substance wherefore it prouoketh vrine
the seede thereof being drunke with wine voideth the stone out of the bodie and resisteth poysons both the seed and herbe being eaten or taken in drinke or outwardly applied healeth inuenomed bitings
the water distilled of this herbe when it beareth flower is singular good for those that are subiect to the falling sicknes or are troubled with the palsie if it be giuen them to drinke
the seed being beaten into powder with the iuice of renouée is good against spitting of blood
it purgeth the belly the flowers and seed also haue a maruellous vertue to heale all wounds except such as are in the head
wherefore the oyle wherein the flowers and cods full of seede shall haue beene long time steeped in the sunne doth heale verie well all greene wounds especially if it be mixed with turpentine
if the belly be rubbed with this oyle it is good against the dysenteria and a spoonefull thereof being drunke killeth the wormes
there is a singular balme made of the flowers thereof with the fruit of an elme and rosebuds putting all together in a glasse bottle and setting it in the sunne till such time as all be so consumed that it seemeth to be putrified then must all be strained thorough a cloth and kept so to be vsed chiefely for wounds and hurts of the bodie
now amana doe you prosecute our discourse concerning symples

of celondine cammocke wormewood hyssope sage and mints
chap

amana

in the description of plants we finde that there is mention made of two kindes of celondine otherwise called clarie either of them indued with many vertues
that which is called great celondine hath a slender stalke of a cubit long and hath leaued branches
the leaues thereof are soft and greene somewhat inclining towards a blew
the flower resembleth that of the white violet which buddeth out according to the order of euerie leafe
it beareth long and slender cods made pointed wherein the seed is enclosed
this herbe is of a verie abstersiue and hot qualitie
the iuice thereof is verie good to take out spots and the pin and web in the eies but because it is verie sharp you must before you applie it mixe it with those things that may represse the sharpnes therof as namely with womans milke being put into hollow teeth it looseneth them that they fall out
if you rub warts therewith they fall off and drie vp
the decoction of the roote being drunk with annise seed and white wine doth heale the iaundise and is good for eating vlcers and being chewed it asswageth the paine in the teeth
some make report that swallowes cause their yoong ones to recouer lost sight by applying this herbe vnto them

and that for this occasion it deriued the name thereof from a greeke word which signifieth a swallow as being verie well knowen by these birds and commodious for them
some alchimists say for chelidonium celidonium that is the gift of heauen vaunting that they can extract out of this herbe a quintessence not onely fit for their purposes but profitable also to conserue the health of man and to heale many diseases
celondine the lesse is without stalke

the leaues are round and thicke the flower yealow hanging at a small stalke
it keepeth but a verie little while for it springeth and dieth in the
and it is so named because it beareth flower in that season when swallowes come in as also great clarie doth
it is hot and drie in the fourth degree full because of the great sharpnes thereof
and therefore so soone as it is applyed it breaketh the skin and

causeth bad nailes to fall off
the iuice thereof snuffed vp into the nose doth greatly purge the braine
and a gargarisme made of the decoction thereof with honie hath the same vertue and euacuateth all euill humours in the breast

cammocke or hath also many singular properties
it is a plant well knowen by

because that as well with the branches as with the interlaced rootes it oftentimes stayeth the plough maugre the oxen
it also vexeth mowers and reapers much
for how thicke lether soeuer they weare yet will this pearce through like an aul as with needles wherewith it is armed being ripe
this herbe hath many branches of a span long turned with many knots the leaues thereof are small and slender like vnto the leaues of lentiles approching verie neere to the forme of rue somewhat hairie and of a reasonable sweet sent
the branches are full of verie sharpe and strong prickles
the flower is purple enclining to white and sometimes yealow
amongst other properties that this plant hath it is aboue all most singular in the roote thereof for to breake the stone in the reines and to voide it out especially when the conduits through which the vrine passeth are stopped vp
some that haue vsed for a verie long time to take the powder of the peele of this roote with wine haue beene holpen of the stone
and according to the testimonie of mathiolus a certaine man hauing vsed for many moneths together of the powder onely of this roote did helpe and heale himselfe of the burstnes in the cods after that all phisitions had giue him ouer except they might cut him as they had concluded
the decoction also of this roote and water that hath beene distilled cleanseth the reines of grauell prouoketh vrine purgeth the bladder the mouth thereof being stopt vp with clammie humours and is singular good to open the liuer and all vessels of sense life and motion
to make this water you must take fower pound of the rindes of greene rootes and being cut small set them a steepe in eight pounds of malmesie or of good wine then distill them in a glasse limbecke in balneo mariae

wormewood is almost infinite in admirable vertues

it produceth a branched stalke with whitish leaues very much cut like those of mugwort small yealow flowers round seed heaped in clusters
this plant is maruellous fit for inflammations of the liuer and stomacke
it is verie profitable for such as are sicke

of the dropsie if they often take the leaues therof co~fected in sugar
wormewood is of restringent qualitie bitter sharpe altogether being hot abstersiue comfortable drying
and therfore it purgeth downwards and driueth into the vrine all cholericke humors
it doth most principally comfort the stomacke and for this cause wine was made thereof called by the same name of the tops thereof is a decoction made with the root of dandelion which is very good to heale the iaundise
the iuice of wormwood mixed with the kernell of a peach killeth wormes
this herbe prouoketh vrine being taken fasting it preserueth from drunkennesse doth sharpen the appetite it is a soueraigne remedie for those that are subiect to stuffings by eating if they drinke the iuice thereof with vineger
being taken with wine it is good against poison with milke and home it is good to rub them that are troubled with the squinancie
the fume of the decoction thereof caseth paines in teeth and in the eares
and being made in wine of raisins it asswageth the paine of the eies if they be annointed therewith
being laid with oile of roses vpon a stomack weakned through long sicknes it doth fortifie it with figs vineger and meale of darnell it is good against the dropsie and for those that are grieued in their spleene
wormwood put into chests defendeth apparel from
there is a conserue made with a pound of the tops of this plant and with three pounds of sugar which may heale an old and despaired dropsie if it be often vsed

hyssop is a common plant but woorthy of great consideration it is like a shrub sprouting many wooden branches out of the roote of a foot and halfe high
the leaues are set euery where about the stalks here and there being long hard sweete in smell hot in taste and somewhat bitter
it beareth flowers on the top of the stalke of a blew colour like eares of corne
the qualitie of hyssop is pearsing attenuatiue opening and abstersiue and therefore it hath the vertue to heate and to purifie
being sod with figs water honie and rue and taken in drinke it is good for inflammations of the lungs for an old cough difficultie of breathing catarrhes and for those which cannot breath except they stand still and it is good also to kill wormes in the bellie
being beaten with salt and cumin it is good against bitings of serpents if it be laid thereupon with honie
it is profitable for those that are subiect to the falling sicknes being ministred in any sort vnto

them
being taken in drinke it voideth fleame and chiefly that which is in the breast and lungs
it serueth also for flegmaticke maladies of the braine and sinewes not onely to purge them but also to fortifie them
it driueth away ventositie mooueth appetite prouoketh vrine freeth from quakings and shakings of feuers and sharpeneth the sight
it maintaineth good colour in one and is good for the spleene and against the dropsie and is singular against squinancies being gargarised with the decoction of figs
the oile that is made of the leaues and flowers helpeth refrigerated or benummed sinewes and strengthneth them
in briefe the admirable vertues of this plant haue begotten this prouerbe he that eateth hyssop shall liue but too long
but the plentie thereof that is euery where causeth euen as it is with all other common things that it is made but small account of and is very seldome vsed in phisicke

sage also is very common so that there is no garden but is filled therewith yet the vertue thereof is not a whit lesse

as is daily experimented to the great profit of many
it hath many long square and white branches
the leaues are like those of a quince tree but more long more rough more thicke sharpe strong of good smell and yet somwhat vnpleasant
many make two kindes of sage common sage and wilde sage
but we may note that garden sage is all one with field sage neither can much difference be marked in them saue in the leaues which are thinner whiter and rougher in wilde then in garden sage
this plant is very singular against all cold and flegmaticke diseases in the head and against all paines of the ioints either being taken in drinke or applied in fomentations
wherefore it is very good for them who haue the falling disease or are sicke of the lethargie and for those that haue their members benummed or senselesse
it is profitable against defluxions of fleame and maladies in the breast
it is good for great bellied women to eate which are subiect to trauell before their time for euery light cause for it keepeth the childe in the wombe and doth quicken it
if you giue three or foure ounces of the iuice of sage to them that spit blood that they may drinke it fasting in a morning with honie the blood will presently be staied
the vse of sage in pottage and otherwise serueth to sharpen the appetite and cleanse the stomacke being full of ill humors
in summe when occasion is to heate drie and binde sage is a very good and fit medicine

mints haue likewise many great properties and are very common both in gardens and fields
whereof though there be many kindes for some haue small and crisped leaues others haue the stalke and flower red and others white yet is there no great matter to be made of these differences considering that one selfe same vertue resideth in all
mints beaten and made into a plaister do comfort a weake stomacke
it is a soueraigne thing to restore the smell and feeling to those that haue lost it so that it be often held to the nose
the leaues thereof dried and brought into powder kill wormes in little children
the iuice drunke with vineger stancheth blood with the iuice of a sower pomegranate it restraineth vomitings hickets and the colicke passion
mints laid vpon the forehead asswage the headach and laid vpon too tender dugs that are ful of milk it easeth the paine of them applied with salt it is good for bitings by dogs and with honied water it is good against paines in the eares
the water of the whole plant distilled in a in a bath of hot water and drunke to the waight of fower ounces staieth bleeding at nose
they that loue milke must presently after they haue eaten thereof chew mint leaues to hinder the milke that it doe not curdle in their stomacke if also you sprinkle cheese with the iuice thereof or with the decoction thereof it will keepe from corrupting and rottennesse
now referre to you aram the sequele of this discourse

of thyme sauorie marierom rue parsley and fennell
chap

aram

amongst common herbes admirable in their properties thyme is worthie to be noted
now there are two sorts thereof one bearing sundry twigs laden with verie manie little narrow leaues hauing small heads at the top full of purple flowers and the other is as hard as wood more branched and like vnto sauorie
in propertie it is hot and dry in the third degree
and therefore it prouoketh vrine doth heat and being taken in drinke doth purge the intrailes
it is good to make one spit out the of the lungs and in the breast
fower drams of drie thyme puluerized

being ministred fasting to one that hath the gout with two ounces and an halfe of honied vineger doth profit them verie much for it purgeth choler and other sharpe humours
it is good also for diseases of the bladder and the waight of a dram being taken with a spoonefull of honied water it is good for such as begin to haue a swollen belly for the sciatica and paine in the reines in the sides and in the breast for inflations and stitches about the forepart of the belly for melancholie persons for those that are troubled in minde and are in continuall fearfulnes if three drams be giuen to them fasting with a spoonefull of it will doe them much good
it is profitable also against inflammation of the eies and vehement paines therof and against the goute in the feete being taken with wine
the vse thereof is verie good for them that haue but bad sight
out of thyme there is an oyle extracted of the colour of gold which commeth forth with the water when the herbe being fresh and greene is distilled in a bathe of hot water
this oyle smels like a citron and is verie tart in taste and good for all things which haue need to be heated
but we must note that heed must be taken that to all the foresaid purposes blacke thyme be not vsed for it corrupteth the temperature of the person and ingendreth choler
and therfore that thyme must be chosen which beareth a carnation flower and that for the best yet which beareth a white flower

sauorie also is an herbe knowen vnto all

and hath the same properties and vertues which thyme hath being taken in such manner
there are two kindes thereof one is like to thyme somewhat lesse and more tender bearing a bud full of greene flowers enclining to purple
the other is greater and more branched which is often found in gardens hauing many boughes that spread about it being round and woodie
the leaues thereof are greater then those of thyme somewhat strong and harder which doe here and there grow about the branches in bunches togither after the springing whereof there grow out little buds enuironed with leaues which are much lesse then the other wherein grow small carnation flowers
the leaues and flowers of sauorie being made in a garland or chaplet and set vpon the head of such as sleep do waken them
being vsed in a cataplasme with sod together in wine it is verie auaileable against griefe of the sciatica
but the vse of sauorie is chiefly good for healthfull persons whether it be in pottage or in sauce or

otherwise
and it being dryed in the shade and brought into powder may be vsed insteed of spices and so may thyme and marierom with maruellous profit for health and strange drugs tbat are hurtfull may be spared as pepper and ginger are being commonly vsed

marierom is so good for all persons so that there are but few people which haue it not either in their gardens or in earth pots the whole plant is verie odoriferous and most profitable in phisicke
it is branched with small plyable twigs with long whitish and hairie leaues growing about those twigs
it beareth flowers in great number on the top of the stalkes and buds of the colour of the herbe being long and composed of an heape of scales wel compact together out of which groweth a litle graine
in propertie it resolueth and is attenuatiue opening and coroboratiue
it is excellent against all cold diseases of the head and of the sinewes both outwardly applied and taken in drinke as also for griefes in the eares noise in them and difficult hearing if some of the iuice of the leaues therof be dropt into the
the iuice thereof also being snuffed vp into the nose purgeth the fleame of the head cleanseth the braine and fortifieth it
the vse of this plant and of the decoction thereof is good against all euill in the breast which may stop the free course and recourse of breath
it is profitable for them that are diseased in the liuer and in the spleene not onely freeing the liuer and spleene from oppilations and stoppings but also making them strong and sound
the decoction thereof also being drunke is good in the beginning of a dropsie for difficultie in making water and for pulling in ones belly
and the leaues thereof serue against the stingings of scorpions being laid thereupon with salt and vineger

rue likewise by reason of the great and exquisite properties thereof deserueth to be remembred
this plant is alwaies green verie thicke of iuicie leaues many hanging at one stalke of small growth but very broad of a dark green colour
it produceth many little boughes branches on the top yellow flowers out of which grow little heads diuided into fower parts wherein small black seed is inclosed
this herb is very attenuatiue incisiue digestiue resolutiue prouocatiue driueth out ve~tosities very forceably
for it is hot in the third degree and not onely sharp in taste but bitter also by meanes whereof it may resolue and penetrate grosse and clammie humours and through the same qualities

prouoke vrine
it doth also consist of subtile parts and is numbred amongst medicines which drie greatly and therefore it is good against inflations asswaging the appetite of lust it resolueth and freeth from all windines
the seed thereof drunke in wine to the waight of fifteene ounces is a singular remedie against all poyson
the leaues eaten alone fasting or with nuts and drie figs do kill the power of venim and are good against serpents
the decoction thereof drunke is profitable against paines in the breast and in the sides inflammation of the liuer the gout and shakings of agues being eaten raw or confected it cleereth the sight is good against difficultie in breathing and against the cough being mixed with french cherries dried it alayeth paines of the eies being mixed with oyle of roses and vineger it easeth the headach being brayed and put into the nose it stancheth the bleeding thereof
the distilled water of it infused into an equall portion of wine and rose water is soueraigne for the paine in the eies

parsley is ordinarie and common in all gardens

and the vse thereof great and very commodious for the mouth and stomacke
neither is there any herbe more vsed in meates and in sauces
but it hath many properties in phisicke for which it is much to be commended
for the decoction of the leaues or rootes thereof openeth the passage of vrine and purgeth out grauell that hath long laine in the vrine conduits it easeth the colicke and paines in the raines being vsed in manner of fomentation vpon the grieued parts
the seede thereof is yet of greater vertue in the foresaid effects it serueth beeing drunke against venime of serpents and driueth out ventosities
the often vsage of parsley doth take away stinking of breath being applied in a cataplasme with crums of white bread it healeth tetters asswageth the swelling of the dugs and for women in doth diminish their milke
there is also another kind of parsley called commonly named broad smallage which hath as much or more efficacie in phisicke then the other especially the seede thereof which hath most singular vses
which being sharpe with great bitternesse is hot in operation with a pearsing vertue
wherefore it is good for wringings in the belly windines of stomacke for the colicke it is singular in drinke for paines in the sides in the raines and in the bladder

fennell doth also consist of two sorts one is of set fennel

and

the other wilde fennell
garden or set fennell is very pleasant in taste for the sauorie sweetenes thereof and is profitable being vsed in phisicke
the decoction of the leaues serue greatly for paines in the reines being drunke and prouoketh vrine
the herbe of fennell eaten or the seede sodden with barlie water doth make very much milke come into womens breasts
the roote braied and applied with honie healeth the bitings of dogs
the seede is excellent to suppresse winde being taken after meales though it be of hard digestion and doth but badly nourish the bodie
but fennell is most principally good both the leaues and seede thereof to cleere the sight and therefore some presse out the iuice of the leaues and tender stalks which they preserue and keepe for this purpose and they doe also distill the water thereof for the same vse
in the westerne part of spaine the fennell yeeldeth a licour like vnto gum which is of greater efficacie then the iuice thereof in medicines for the eies
wilde fennell is sharper in taste hath greater leaues and groweth higher then garden fennell
the roote thereof hath a good sent and being taken in drinke doth profit them much that hardly make water it is good against bitings of serpents breaketh the stone and healeth the iaundise which the seede thereof doth likewise
now achitob doe you proceede in talke concerning simples

of rosemarie cammomill the lillie baulme of grasse or and of pimpernell
chap

achitob

it would be very hard to finde out in one plant onely more vertues and properties then they who haue trauelled to publish the science of simples haue attributed to rosemarie and yet it seemeth to many that it is fit for nothing but to make garlands and nosegayes and being so very common is not esteemed to be of great efficacie
indeede it is a very ordinarie plant and in prouence it groweth to such greatnes that the people vse it for like other wood and the stocke is of such compasse that they make tables and harpes thereof yet all this lets not but it may be of admirable vertue
for it is very good against cold diseases

of the stomacke against the colicke and casting vp of meate

by eating it either in bread or drinking it in powder with pure wine
it is profitable for such as are diseased in the liuer or spleen for it doth not onely heate purifie and open but through the restringent vertue thereof it doth also fortifie
it is very good against all rheumes and all cold maladies against the falling euil numbnes of members the lethargie and palsie
it is good to wash the head and for fomentations of the ioints
it doth sharpen the sight sweeten the breath and being boiled in vineger and hard wine it staieth the rheumes that fall into the teeth and gums if the mouth be washed with this decoction hot
the powder therof dried doth consolidate greene wounds if they be washed before with wine wherein rosemarie hath beene sodden and then the powder be strowed on afterwards
the flowers thereof confected in sugar are good for all things aforesaide particularly against cold passions of the hart against maladies of the breast and against the plague
the decoction of rosemarie made in water and taken in drinke doth heale the iaundise
so likewise doth the seede being drunke with pepper and white wine
in the plague time it is good to perfume the house with this plant for the fume thereof driueth away ill aires

cammomill also groweth abundantly amongst corne

and in the fieldes bearing yellow flowers enuironed with whitish leaues and is of a strong sauour
but to mollifie resolue rarifie and loosen this plant is of singular operation and in this respect no medicine is better for wearie folkes then a bath of cammomill
the leaues beaten and put into white wine make a profitable drinke to heale quotidian and quartan agues the decoction thereof drunke healeth paines in the side and so doth the water distilled of the flowers which flowers being gathered without leaues beaten in a morter formed with oile into trochisks afterwardes dissolued againe in oyle if they bee therewith rubbed and chafed which are troubled with feuers from the crowne of the head to the foote and that they presently goe into bed to sweate they shall be holpen bicause of the abundant heate that goeth out of their bodie
cammomill is especially good to dissolue feuers that are without inflammation of any chiefe intraile principally those which proceede from cholericke humors and thicknes of the skin
being taken in drinke or the fume thereof receiued in at the fundament it is a great helpe to voide vrine

and grauell

the lillie is likewise very woorthie of consideration
it beareth long leaues euer greene smooth and iuicie it hath a stalke of two cubits high round straight euen thicke and strong all clad with leaues from the bottome to the top
at the top of the stalke growe three or fower little branches out of which issue small long heads of the colour of the herbe which in time become faire lillies of exquisite whitenesse crossed on the outside and the ends turned outwards round about
at the bottome of the flower growe certaine yellow stalks as it were dustie on the vpper side of the fashion of toongs out of the midst of which groweth one long one hauing a round head of the colour of the herbe
there is no flower so high and it surpasseth in beautie all other whitenesse
now for the vertue of this plant
the leaues thereof are good beeing applied against the biting of serpents beeing boiled they heale burnings and confected in vineger are good for wounds water distilled of the flowers are profitable for women that are deliuered of childe with great difficulty and voideth out the beeing mixed with saffron and cinamon
the oile drawne out of those flowers is good against all cold diseases of the sinewes as cramps and palsies and to mollifie all stiffenes in the ioynts and all kernelles
lillies long time steeped in oile beeing applied hot do ripen hot impostumes without paine and do breake them especially such as are in the ioints
and the bodie of the roots hath the same propertie
for beeing boiled and braied with oile of roses they ripen impostumes and beeing braied with hony they heale cut and lame sinewes clense the head of scabs and clarifie the visage and make it smooth
the seede of lillies also taken in drink serueth against the bitings of serpents
and the water that is distilled of the flowers in a limbeck doth take wrinkles out of womens faces and doth beautifie them very much

baulme is a very odoriferous plant and smelleth much like a citron the stalke and leaues thereof are somewhat rough and many stalkes issue out of the roote
the property of it is to reioyce the heart to comfort cold and moist stomacks to helpe digestion to euacuate the stoppings of the conduits of the braine to heale feeblenes and faintnes of hart to fortifie it being weake especially if the weakenes bee such that it oftentimes breaketh ones sleepe in the night moreouer this hearb staieth the panting

of the hart driueth away cares and sad imaginations which proceede either from the melancholie humor or from fleame combust
it hath also a laxatiue vertue not so feeble but that it clenseth and purgeth the spirits and bloud of the hart and arteries from all melancholie vapors which it cannot do to the other parts of the bodie
the leaues thereof taken in drinke or outwardly applied are good against stingings of the tarantula of scorpions and against the biting of dogs and it is good to bath such wounds with the decoction thereof
beeing mixed with salt they are profitable against the kings euill and mundifie vlcers and beeing applied do asswage the paine of gowts
they are vsed in clysters against the flux
also the leaues taken in drinke with niter are very good for them that are stopped by eating toad stooles or mushrums and in loch for them that are troubled with shrinking vp of the bellie and breath with such difficulty that they cannot do it except they stand vpright

grasse

or is one of the commonest herbs in the field yea euen in leane grounds
the branches thereof ly a long vpon the earth and are full of knots out of which and out of the top it often sendeth new rootes
the leaues are very small and pointed it is maruailous in propertie
for the decoction thereof taken in drinke healeth wringing in the bellie and hard making of water and breaketh the stone and grauell in the bladder
the root braied and applied searcheth wounds
and the iuice of the decoction thereof may bee vsed to the same effect which the herb also doth beeing beaten and keepeth wounds from all inflammation if to the decoction thereof bee put a little wine or hony and the third part of so much pepper myrrh franckincense and be made to boile afterwards againe in some copper vessell it is a singular remedy for the and the rheume which falleth into the eies
grasse also that hath seuen spaces betwixt the knots is very good for the headach beeing bound about it
it likewise stauncheth bleeding at nose
the seede thereof doth greatly prouoke vrine and bindeth the bellie and staieth vomiting
it is speciall good against byting of dragons
there is found in some places of germany a certaine kinde of grasse which is tilled with as great care as other corne or pulse because the people vseth the seede thereof in their meats which seede they call mama and they seeth it in pottage with fat meate and finde it as good as rice
it is smaller then millet and very white

but it must bee beaten in a morter to vnhuske it

there are three sorts of pimpernell
one groweth very great and hath a long root the leaues are couched round vpon the earth beeing cut and indented about the stalke is square the flowers thick in bunches smal and whitish
the next sort is little and hath a red stalke the leaues small not so much cut and thinner dented
the third kinde is the most common which is often eaten in sallades and set in gardens
the root of the two first kindes wherein all their vertue lieth is very good for paines in the reines and bladder which are caused by the stone
for it cleereth the reines of grauell and driueth foorth long kept vrine
the iuice also of this root beeing drunke with wine is singular against all poisons and bitings of venemous beasts
for which cause some esteeme much of this root to bee vsed against the plague
the third kinde of pimpernell is different in vertue from the former although they be verie like in forme of leaues
for it is more restringent in taste and verie nourishing for which cause it may be thought to be of a binding nature
wherefore it stayeth the dysenteria and other fluxes and the vomiting of cholericke humours
it healeth wounds and vlcers and it is of speciall vse in ointments that are made for wounds in the head and for cankers
some phisitions haue much commended it in the cure of pestilent and contagious feuers affirming also that the often vsage thereof is a soueraigne preseruatiue against dangerous diseases
now aser do you proceed in this our treatise concerning simples

of alkakeng pellitorie of the wall fumitorie angelica and of
chapter

aser

it is wonderfull to rehearse the vertues properties which many affirme to vs in their writings to co~sist in the solanum whereof the ancients made fower kindes
but will heere make mention of two onely which are verie common

sith that the rest are seldome found or neuer
the first kinde is called which is a small little herbe hauing many pits in the stalke thereof out of which grow blacke leaues like to those of basill but a little greater
it beareth white flowers yealow in the midst in fashion of a starre
the fruit thereof

is round hanging in clusters full of a winie iuice no lesse then iuniper seede wherein a small white graine is enclosed this fruit is of diuers colours for in some plants it is blacke in others yealow and in some enclining towards a greene
concerning the propertie of this plant the iuice of the fruit thereof as likewise of the leaues mixed with oyle of roses and a little vineger is singular against the headach when it is caused by heat
it is good for such as are franticke if one steepe linnen clothes therein and lay them to the forepart of their head
in like sort may they be applied to the forehead against hot rheumes that fal downe into the eies
it is good also to gargle it against inflammations of the throat and falling of the pallat
it is put in ointments to heale sore and grieuous vlcers
the leaues thereof beaten with salt and laide on a plaister breake impostumes that grow behinde the eares
in briefe when need is to refresh to dry vp or to restraine is verie conuenient

now for the other kinde of solanum commonly called alkakeng

it hath leaues like vnto nightshade but broader stronger somewhat sharp and not so black the stalke thereof is supple which beeing growne vp enclineth towards the ground
the flowers are white out of which rise little bladders as big as a nut and growe sharpe they are composed of eight sides of equall distance one from another
and they are at first greene and beeing ripe red within them they containe fruit one graine in each of them beeing fastned to the bottome of the bladder like to the seede of a red grape both sharp and bitter and full of a great number of small white graines within
in this fruit also is great vertue not onely to prouoke vrine but also to allay the burning heat thereof
for the iuice of it beeing drunke with the iuice of white poppie or of the seed of melons or of gourds or with the decoction of mallowes or with barly water is marueilous singular for the scorching heate of vrine
and this plant is so contrarie to adders that laying the roote thereof neere vnto them they are sodainly surprised with so great sleepe that they die therewith
the fruite thereof steeped in new wine is very good being laide on the eie lids
some put it in a vessell togither with ripe grapes which they suffer to boyle for certaine daies togither out of which they extract a very profitable wine for such as are troubled with grauell euacuating the grauell marueilously well and clensing the reines being drunke to the waight of

fowre ounces
and the same fruite taken in drinke healeth the iaundise

pellitorie is an herbe very well knowne and hath manie great properties the leaues thereof are rough the stalke redde about which are bitter graines which are fit to lay amongst apparell
this plant hath the vertue to refresh and binde for which cause it is singular good to heale greene wounds
for if it be laide vpon a wound being halfe beaten and very fresh and be not taken off for three daies togither there shall be no neede to vse any other medicine
the waight of three ounces of the iuice thereof being drunke is marueilous good to free vrine that hath long beene holden and the herbe heated vpon a tile and sprinkled with malmesey and applied to the forehead is very good for such as are troubled with grauell and cannot make water
the iuice thereof held within the mouth healeth the toothach
the distilled water thereof clenseth and clarifieth the visage the leaues being applied heale burnings swellings and inflammations being fried with fresh butter or capons grease and laide in manner of a vpon the belly they ease the colicke
a cataplasme also made of greene pellitorie beaten with crums of bread and oyle of roses or cammomill resolueth impostumes which grow in the dugs
and being mixed with or kids grease it is good for gouts and fals
the iuice likewise mixed in like quantitie of white wine and oile of sweet almonds being newly made alayeth the paines torments of the stone and dropped into the eares with oyle of roses it healeth the paine of them
some minister them to gargle for inflammation in the throat
and some giue them for an old cough
it is seene by experience that this herbe is abstersiue in so much as it is verie good to expell wormes

fumitorie is an herbe much branched and tender hauing verie small leaues growing here and there of a white ashie colour and in great number vpon euerie side
the flower thereof is purple
this plant is one of the most gentle medicines and least annoying that may be amongst laxatiue remedies
but it is euerie where so common that none esteeme of it
it is not only laxatiue but doth also fortifie the interiour members bindeth their veines which are too loose as also those of the stomacke and of the liuer and healeth feuers that proceed by choler or through stoppings
it euacuateth the cholerike humour verie much in

vrine the seed thereof is bitter and somewhat sharpe and it is somewhat more hot then the herbe that is temperate so that the whole plant is purifying penetratiue opening and laxatiue
and because of the cold and stiptick qualitie thereof it bindeth restrayneth and fortifieth
it doth gently loosen the belly it purgeth choler and burning humours
wherefore it is good against the meazels against cankers and all infections of the skin and other maladies which doe proceed from oppilations the iuice thereof cleereth the sight causeth teares to issue euen as smoke or fume doth whereof it seemeth to haue taken name

angelica is a most excellent plant

and verie worthie to bee here described
it is aboue a cubit in height it produceth a knottie stalke crested and full of pits the leaues thereof are long and indented round about the flowers white growing in bunches out of which springeth a little graine and smooth like a lentill
the roote is as thicke as a reddish diuided into many branches sharpe in taste and sweete in smell
also there are sundry sorts thereof for one kinde is set in gardens another sort is wild and another groweth in watrie places
all this plant is hot and drie in the second degree full or to the beginning of the third wherefore it is opening attenuating and resoluing
it is singular against poysons so that taken in drinke or often chewed it preserueth from the plague being taken alone it attenuateth flegmaticke and clammie humours
and so doth the decoction of the roote thereof which doth readily heale the cough that comes through cold for it causeth one to spit out and voide all clammie fleame
the same decoction receiued in wine or water healeth vlcers in the interior members dissolueth clotted blood and fortifieth the stomacke
the roote beaten to powder is soueraigne against fainting of the hart other passions thereof
it is singular against bitings of mad venimous beasts being laid thereupon with rue or taken inwardly for which cause many of our moderne phisitions imploy it in their counterpoisons preseruatiues
there is giuen halfe a dram of the root with a dram of treacle and the distilled water hereof to such as haue the plague who are constrained to sweat and seuen howers after to resume this drink and by this onely counterpoison some haue beene holpen
this roote chewed and put into holow teeth asswageth the paine of them
it also sweetneth the breath
whosoeuer shall hold a little peece thereof in his mouth or in the morning

drinke two spoonefuls of wine wherein it hath beene steeped hee shall not easily bee infected with euill aire all day after
the leaues thereof with the leaues of rue and honie applied in a cataplasme heale the bitings of and stingings of serpents
and being laide vpon his head that is sicke of an ague it attracteth to it selfe much of the heate of the ague

maidenhaire also is a very exquisite plant much like vnto ferne but with smaller leaues set in order heere and there one ouer against another in fine smal branches sharpe in taste black and shining
it is temperate in heate and coldenes and therefore it drieth purifieth and resolueth it is good to cause one spit and voide out of the breast and lungs all grosse and clammy humors it staieth the fluxe of the belly resolueth the kings euill and other tumors and being taken in drinke is singular for hardnes of water when one can make it but drop by drop it breaketh the stone
the decoction also thereof is good for them that draw their breath with paine and is profitable for the spleene and against the iaundise
and the herbe thereof being laid vpon the bitings of serpents is a singular remedie therefore
to open also the infusion thereof made in parsley water or in endiue water or in broth of blacke or in a little is very good and adding sugar thereto it healeth inflammations of the side doth greatly prouoke vrine
briefly all the vertues that phisitions attribute to called commonly capilli veneris agree with
now amana let vs heare you choose out other plants for the subiect of your discourse

of rheubarb licorice aloes sene saffron and centurie
chapter

amana

sith that it is not our purpose to write an entire historie concerning simples but onely to consider of the most excellent in their effects me seemeth that it is sufficient for vs so to make way to another matter to adde to our precedent discourses that which intend nowe to speake concerning some singular plants amongst which preferre rheubarb to the first place which is very plentifull in all india
the leaues of it are commonly two foote long broad

aboue and so growing narrower towards the stalke

hauing a certaine cotton or as it were haire round about it as is co~monly seene in the herb called in french bouillon blane
the stalk therof is but a foote high or little more and is all greene like the leaues
in the middle thereof groweth out a very small branch hauing certaine flowers about it that enuiron it which are like vnto purple violets saue in colour onely which is different being white and blew of sharpe smell and very vnpleasant to their nose that smell thereat
the roote is very deepe in the ground of a foote and an halfe long and as thicke as a mans arme some more some lesse and out of it there do many small ones sprout which before the great one be cut are digged vp with the principall to the end that it may more easily be cleft in peeces
it is on the outside of an ashie colour and full of yellowish iuice while it is fresh and greene and so clammie that in touching thereof it causeth the fingers to sticke togither
now this roote is an excellent medicine gentle and without danger wherein many singularities requisite in a laxatiue simple are comprised
and rheubarb is best while it is greene of a blackish colour somewhat enclining to a redde and heauie although it be of a rare bodie and which being broken is mixed with red and skie colour within and being chewed waxeth as yellow as saffron
besides it purgeth choler and flegme it clenseth and fortifieth the stomacke and liuer and healeth the paines and prickings of them
it clarifieth the bloud openeth and healeth all maladies that proceed of stoppings as the iaundise the dropsie swelling of the spleene and long feauers
it is good against spitting of bloud and stancheth it out of what part so euer it runne
and it may be taken at all times without danger and in all ages yea it may be ministred to little children and to great bellied women although the vulgar people thinke otherwise supposing that rheubarb is a very violent medicine and that phisitions vse it but in halfe despaired maladies which is not so

licorice is verie woorthie to be numbred amongst the most excellent phisicke plants
and thereof are two kinds

one bearing fruite and the other not that which beareth fruite groweth abundantly in germanie and in the territorie of bamberg and other places
and it is a verie branchie plant of two cubits high being thicke of leaues and fatte in manner of gum the flowers thereof are like an hyacinth the fruite thereof great like plantaine

berries and more rough and hairie enclosed within little cods like those of lentiles hairie also and full of smal prickles of yellow colour enclining to a blacke
the other kinde of licorice is very well knowne and groweth of it selfe in many places
in vertue it is abstersiue clensing and alaieth the bitternesse of humors and therefore it is very good for heate of the vrine
being chewed especially whilest it is fresh it stancheth hunger and thirst and retayneth that vertue for many daies
and the iuice thereof being made thicke and held in the mouth till it melt of it selfe hath the same effect
it is good for the breast and lungs and is therefore ministred to those who haue short breath or are in a co~sumption or pleurisie
the iuice aslwageth the prickings not onely of the arterie of the lungs but of the bladder also and doth excellently staunch thirst as being tempered with moysture and colder then our nature
and it is to be noted that the roote wherein lye all these properties is much better being fresh taken out of the ground then when it is drie and is more pleasant in taste being employed in medicines

the aloë is a plant which is seene greene in many townes in italie in windowes and galleries it is kept in pots full of earth more for pleasure to content the eie then for vse in medicine
but the licour and iuice that is pressed out of it and brought to vs is extracted out of the aloë that groweth in the lower syria and arabia and in the indies where the best is
this plant hath thick and fat leaues with certaine little prickles here and there on all sides
the root thereof is fat and oilie bearing a white flower out of which groweth a litle graine like that of smallage
in the thick iuice thereof prepared for medicine there is found grauell and earth which is nothing but the setlings of pure aloes but the good is pure and cleane not sophisticate without grauel or little stones reddish brittle of a good smell close like a liuer and very much enclining to the colour thereof easilie melting and very bitter that which is black and hard to breake is worth nothing
the aloë is profitable for many things because of the drines thereof without any sharpnes
it purgeth choler and fleame the head and stomach and is very good for paines in those parts it quickneth all the senses openeth the liuer and healeth the iaundise
it killeth wormes in the bellie beeing incorporated with ox gall and vineger and laid vpon the nauell
some apply the powder thereof to wonnds to search them it healeth vlcers and staieth

them
it appeaseth the paine of the head beeing applied to the temples forehead with vineger and oile of roses
in briefe the propertie thereof is to restraine to dry to prouoke sleepe to binde the bodie and yet to loosen the bellie

sene hath leaues like licorice thick fat

and in tast like beanes the stalke thereof is a cubit high out of which issue many branches as pliable as a leatherne thong
the flowers thereof are yealow straked with small purple strakes after which there grow certaine cods crooked like a sickle wherein is enclosed a black seede enclining to greene very like to kernels in grapes
it is sowed in diuers places in florence and prospereth very well especially in the territory of the city of florence but the best is brought from alexandria in egypt and out of syria
it purgeth without any annoiance choler fleame and melancholie
it mundifieth the hart the liuer the braine the spleene the lungs and all parts of the bodie and is profitable for all the accidents of them
it openeth the inner parts and maintaineth a man or woman in youth forsloweth age and causeth ioy of minde
the leaues thereof are good to wash the head with cammomill for they fortifie the braine the sinewes the sight and the hearing
briefly it is a good medicine in all long diseases and such as proceede of a melancholie humour
and therefore it is very profitable for them that raue and are out of their wits likewise for vlcers ouer all the body for palsies for the and falling euill
it fortifieth the hart especially beeing mixed with some other ingredient fit therefore as namely with purple violets
it is very good in the infusion or decoction thereof to ad some clones thereto to correct a little that annoiance which some say it doth to the stomach and to fortifie the vertue thereof
and beeing mixed with some infusion of roses or laxatiue sirup of roses it is an excellent purge for all euill humours
there is a sirup made of sene beeing taken greene from the plant and mixed with infusion of roses which is very good to that effect and is so gentle that one may minister thereof to women with childe and to little infants and people of all ages

saffron is a common plant and yet hath many vertues

it beareth many leaues long narrow small full not round hanging downewards thick and soft
the flower thereof is skie coloured and very faire to behold
out of the middle thereof growe certaine red threedes big at the top with which out of the same

place almost there growe other yealow ones in fashion like toongs
that saffron is good which dieth your hands with the colour thereof and that smelleth somewhat sharp and is not very brittle
in propertie it is good for feeblenes of stomack and faintnes of hart beeing taken in some small quantitie it preserueth from drunkennes and healeth the bitings of serpents and stinging of spiders
it is restoratiue the astriction thereof verie much aiding thereto which qualitie proceedeth from cold and earthines although that the qualitie of heat exceede therein in such sort as in all the substance thereof it is hot in the second degree and dry in the first
but the smell thereof is naught for the head and being taken too much it troubleth the spirit

centurie is likewise worthie of great consideration because of the properties thereof in phisicke
there be two sorts of it one is called great centurie and the other is lesser centurie
the great hath leaues like a walnut tree long greene like colewoorts indented about a stalke of two or three cubits high
the flower thereof is blew and the roote verie big full of iuice sharp with astriction and sweetnes
the lesser sore hath leaues like rue a square stalke somewhat more then a span long the flowers thereof are red inclining to purple and the root is small smooth and bitter in taste
for their properties the vertue of great centurie consisteth in the roote thereof which serueth for ruptures conuulsions difficultie in breathing old coughes pleurisies and spitting of blood
it is also giuen to them that are sicke of the dropsie of the iaundise and are pained in their liuer being either steeped in wine or beaten to powder and drunke
of the lesser galen hath composed an whole booke which he dedicated to his friend papias concerning the great and admirable vertues therein
for it purgeth choler and fleame for which cause the decoction thereof is good against tertian feuers which also and the iuice thereof helpeth stoppings and hardnes of the liuer and spleene
being drunke likewise to the waight of a dram with honie or laid vpon the nauell it auoideth wormes out of the belly
the leaues of this herbe wherein and in the flowers thereof lyeth all the vertue being applied fresh to great wounds search them and heales vp old vlcers but now changing our talke let vs leaue phisicke plants and say somwhat concerning those more excellent ones which particularly serue for the nouriture of man

of wheate rie barley and oates and of rice and millet

amongsts herbs and plants wherewith men are fed and nourished the chiefe degree is by good right assigned to wheat as to that graine whereof the best bread is made which onely with water may very well suffice for the mainteinance of our life hauing many properties also in the vse of phisick
now according to the diuersitie of places wherein it groweth people do name it and one sort differeth from another but wee will heere speake of that which is most common amongst vs
all wheat hath many verie small roots

but one leafe and many buds which may diuide themselues into sundry branches
all the winter time it is an herb but the weather waxing milder there springeth out of the midst thereof a small stalk which after three or foure knots or ioints beareth an eare not by and by seene but is hidden within a case
the stalke beeing made the flower bloometh some foure or fiue daies after and about so long endureth
that past the graine swelleth and ripeneth in forty daies or sooner as the climate is in heat
the fertility of this plant is meruailous as wee behold by daily experience
for there are some places in italie especially in the territory of sienna about the sea coasts where there hath beene seene to grow out of one only graine foure and twenty eares of corne and that one bushell of seede hath yeelded an hundred
the best wheat should bee hard to breake massiue waightie of the colour of gold cleere smooth kept three moneths ripe faire and growing in a fat soile to be the fitter to make better bread of
and the meale also must not be too much ground neither yet too fresh nor too long kept before it be vsed for if it be too much ground it maketh bread as if it were of branne that which is too fresh doth yet retaine therein some heat of the and that which is kept too long will be spoyled either by dust or by mouldines or will else haue some bad smell
now besides the common vse of wheat the manner how to make it in drinke is verie notable which drinke serueth insteed of wine in those countries where the vine cannot fructifie

for there they take

wheat and sometimes barley rie or oates euerie one apart or else two or three sorts of these graines or else all mingled togither and steepe them in fountaine water or in water of the cleanest and cleerest riuer that may be chosen or else for better in a decoction or wourt of hops and this is done for so long time till the graine begin to breake then is it dried in the sunne being drie it is beaten or else ground afterwards sodden in water in which it hath first beene steeped for the space of three or fower howers putting thereto a good quantitie of the flowers of hops and skimming the decoction or wourt verie well that done it is powred out and put in vessels for the purpose
this drinke is called beere and they which will haue it verie pleasant to the taste after it is made doe cast into the vessels sugar cinamom and cloues and then stirre it verie much
some doe put cockle into the composition of beere the more to sharpen the taste
and sith we are entred into this speech we will here note that wheat doth easily conuert into cockle chiefly when the weather is rainie and cold

for it commeth of corne corrupted by too much moisture or that hath beene too much wet by continuall raines in winter
it springeth first out of the ground hauing a long leafe fat rough with a slenderer stalk then that of wheat at the top whereof there is a long eare hauing on all sides little sharpe cods or huskes out of which three or fower graines grow together being couered with a verie hard barke
the bread that hath much thereof in it doth dizzie and hurt the head so that they which eat thereof do commonly fall into a sound sleep and their head is much troubled
it annoyeth the eies and dimmeth the sight
some also do make

amylum of wheat which serueth for many things
they take verie cleane wheat of three moneths olde which they wet fiue times a day and as often by night if it be possible being well soaked and steeped they powre the water away not shaking it to the ende that the thick and that which is like creame may not runne out with the water
after that it is verie wel mollified and the water changed it must be sifted that the bran which swimmeth at top thereof may bee done away and then must it be kneaded verie hard together casting fresh water stil vpon it
and so it must be laid in panniers or dossers to drie and then vpon new tiles to be parched in the sun with as much speed as may be for if it remaine neuer so little a while moist it waxeth sowre
the best is that which is white

fresh light and smooth
it hath power to mollifie in sharpe and rough things and is good against rheumes that fall into the eies
being taken in drinke it restraineth spitting of blood and asswageth the sorenes of the throat

next after wheat rie is in common vse to make bread of

this plant hath many stalkes smaller then those of wheat and blacker as the graine is also
meale made of rie is good for plaisters to draw
the decoction of the seede voideth wormes out of the belly especially if coriander seed be mixed therewith
the straw being soaked in water is good to binde vines insteed of rush or broome

barley is also much vsed euerie where

it beareth a broad leafe and rougher then wheat hath a britler and lesser stalk of eight knots with one onely rough broad leafe vpon the stalke
the graine is lapped in a cod which is close shut out of the top whereof groweth a long and sharpe beard
the best is that which is whitest most full heauie easie to boyle not waxing mouldie
there groweth a certaine kinde of it in many places the graine whereof is easily taken out of the huske or cod and is therefore called clensed barley
besides all barley drieth and cooleth and is also abstersiue
the meale thereof boyled in with figs resolueth al inflammations and impostumes with rosin and pigeons dung it ripeneth all hard swellings with melilot heads of poppie it easeth the paine of the sides and with quinces or vineger it appeaseth inflammations of the goute in the feete
the ashes of burnt barley is verie good for burnings being laide thereupon and applied to flesh that cleaueth not to the bone
concerning besides that it lyeth heauie vpon the stomacke it engendreth also cold and clammie humours it nourisheth little causeth windines and yet some say it is very good for them that haue the gout in their feet

there is a certain kind of drink called beere made of barley which is co~monly vsed insteed of wine in al the to wit in germany bohemia polonia fla~ders other cold countries of europe
and if one take too much therof it wil inebriate or make dru~ken as wel as wine that for a lo~ger time bicause that beere is more grosse and materiall and of harder digestion then wine whereto it is so like also in force and vertue that is likewise made thereof
next after barley oates are a graine very commodious

in leafe and stalke this graine resembleth wheate but it beareth

on the top thereof as it were little twolegd grashoppers hanging where the graine is inclosed which though it seeme to be created of nature rather fit for beasts foode then for man yet in germanie they oftentimes eate it in good fat flesh pottage being boiled therein after it hath beene cleansed of all filth as is vsed in rice
oates also in the vse of phisicke doe very neere approch to the qualitie of barley for being applied it drieth and moderately resolueth
but it is a little more cold and somewhat more restringent in temper so that it is good for the flux in the belly and profitable for those that haue the cough

wee may likewise consider of rice which the ancients did hold to bee a kinde of corne
the leafe thereof is very thick resembling that of a leeke
the stalke thereof is about a cubit long knotty bigger then that of wheat and stronger on the top of it groweth an eare parted into little branches on both sides whereof is the graine included in a yealow huske rough and hauing creuises on the side of an ouall figure and beeing taken out of the huske it becommeth white
it groweth in some places of italie in moist ground but it aboundeth in asia syria and egypt
rice is very vsuall in meat and nourisheth meanely but it is made of more digestion and of better tast beeing sod in almond milke or fat flesh pottage
it is very good to giue to such as haue the laxe and colick
the flower thereof is good in repercussiue plaisters
it staieth inflammations that rise in the dugs
the decoction of rice also is very profitable in clisters against laxes or fluxes and in drinke likewise
now to end this talke

wee will say something concerning millet for it hath many properties both in food and phisick
this plant beareth leaues like those of a reed hauing a stalke of a cubit long thick knottie and rough
at the top thereof do hang certaine hairie heads in which the graine groweth in great abundance beeing round massiue yealow and lapped in a thin skin
in many places bread is made of this graine and euen at verona it is carried hot about the streets whereof they make much account for it hath a sweetnes very pleasant to the tast if it bee eaten a little after it is drawne out of the ouen but beeing hard it is vnpleasant
the common people of trent are nourished with millet boiled onely eating it with milke and it is the best food that they can get
besides there are very good fomentations or made of millet to dry moderately and to driue out ventosities especially

beeing mixed with salt
it is happily applied against griping in the bellie caused through windines but it is much better yet beeing mingled with flowers of cammomill
it is commonly fried in a pan and then put hot into a bag and so laid vpon the diseased parts
it hath the vertue to preserue medicines long time from moulding and putrifying if they bee buried in an heape of millet yea and fresh flesh is long kept thereby in hot weather
now to finish this daies discourse it seemeth good to me achitob that you speake of the vine and fruit thereof of which men make their most delicious drinke

of the vine of grapes of wine and of
chap

achitob

it were very superfluous to make here a long discourse concerning the vine and concerning the diuers qualities which are found in this plant of which wee doe not onely receiue grapes a most pleasant and delicious meat but haue also that most exquisite drinke which wee call wine for all the world hath so much cherished the vine that there are few people of any condition soeuer but can discourse sufficiently well of it and of the nature thereof

we will briefly then declare that which wee shall thinke most notable therein and chiefly in the vse of medicine
the leaues and tender branches thereof helpe the beeing laid thereupon and appease inflammations and heat of the stomack
the iuice of them drunke serue against dysenterias or fluxes spitting of bloud weakenes of stomack and the corrupt appetite of great bellied women
the licour of vines which lieth thick vpon the stock thereof like gum beeing taken in drinke with wine purgeth grauell
the ashes of the branches and stones beeing mixed with vineger helpeth the hard bindings of the fundament and is good against the stingings and bitings of vipers and against inflammation of the spleene beeing laid thereupon with oile of roses rue and vineger

as grapes are the most singular fruits of autumne

so also are they the most nourishing of all the fruits of summer which are not to bee kept and they engender the best nourishment especially

when they bee perfect ripe
but all raisins do not nourish after one manner for sweete ones haue a more hot substance and therefore they cause thirst do swell the stomacke and loosen the belly
contrariwise tart ones doe binde doe nourish little and are of hard digestion
greene and sowre ones are naught for the stomacke
and the bigger grapes are the better they are especially if they be gathered verie ripe
they which are kept hanged vp are best for nourishme~t because their great moisture is dried
the fresh verie ripe grape is good for burnings if the wine thereof be prest out betwixt ones hands vpon the hurt places
the mother of the wine or grapes being kept and mixed with salt is profitable against inflammations of the dugs hardnes of them through too much abundance of milke
the decoction thereof clisterized serueth greatly for dysenterias or fluxes
the stones or seeds haue a restringent vertue and are profitable for the stomacke
being parched and beaten into powder it is good to eate with meate against the fluxe and weaknes of stomacke
drie grapes or raisins haue yet greater vertues and properties in the vse of phisicke and especially they which are sweetest and of most substance as they of damascus of cypres and of candia
the meate of them being eaten is good for the cough for the throat the reines and the bladder being eaten with their stones they serue against dysenterias
being boyled in a platter with sugar and flower of millet of barley and an egge they purge the braine being reduced into a plaister with flower of beanes and cumin

they appease inflammations
besides the nourishment of raisins is so distributed through the bodie according as their nature is sweete to the sweete sowre to the sowre meane to them that participate with both qualities and the sweete full and fat raisins doe nourish more then the sharpe and leane
they which are without stones either by nature or art if they be sweet they are so depriued of all astriction so that they be maruellous lenitiue
and therefore are they most fit for paines of the breast for the cough for sore throats for maladies in the reines and bladder and are good also for the liuer
but we may not here forget to make mention of the fruit of the wilde vine commonly called in french lambrusque because of the admirable properties thereof
the grapes of it are gathered and put to drie in the shade they are of a restringent vertue good for the stomacke and prouoke vrine they binde the

belly and stay spitting of blood

now must wee speake of wine which is made of the raisin

and grape produced by the vine
concerning it many affirme that it is the most sweete licour of all others the principall aide and chiefe prop of humaine life the chiefe restorer of the vitall spirits the most excellent strengthener of all the faculties and actions of the body reioicing comforting the hart very much and for these causes they say that the auncients haue called that plant which beareth the fruit out of which wee receiue this wine vitis quasi vita life
but yet wee must not deceiue our selues by so many praises attributed to wine considering that the vse thereof by the least excesse that may bee doth bring so many euils vpon man that they cannot bee numbred nor sufficientlie bewailed
but beeing vsed temperately wee must confesse that it is a thing of greatest efficacie in the world to nourish and strengthen the bodie
for it engendreth very pure bloud it is very quickly conuerted into nourishment it helpeth to make digestion in all parts of the bodie it giueth courage purgeth the braine refresheth the vnderstanding reioiceth the hart quickneth the spirits prouoketh vrine driueth out ventosities augmenteth naturall heat fatneth them who are in good health exciteth the appetite purifieth troubled bloud openeth stoppings conuaieth the nouriture throughout the whole body maketh good colour and purgeth out of the bodie all that which is therein superfluous
but if wine bee taken without great mediocritie and temperance it doth by accident refrigerate the whole bodie
for the naturall heat thereof by too much drinke remaineth choaked euen as a little fire is quenched by a great heap of wood cast thereupon
besides wine is hurtfull for the braine for the marrow of the back bone and the sinewes that grow out of it
whereby it falleth out that this principall part beeing hurt there succeede in time great and dangerous maladies thereupon to wit the apoplexie the falling euill the palsie shakings numbnes of members conuulsions giddines of the head shrinking of ioints the incubus the catalepsia lethargie frensie rheumes deafenes blindenes and shrinking of mouth and lips
moreouer wine immoderately drunke corrupteth all good manners and discipline of life
for this is it that makes men quarrellers wranglers rash incensed furious adulterers homicides in a word addicted to all vice and dissolution
besides

it is to be noted that wine is fitter for old people then for them of other ages for it moderateth and mantaineth the cold temperature of ancient folkes which hath come vpon them for many yeeres

but it should not be sufferable if we will follow the counsell of the elders for children and yoong folkes to drinke thereof till they attaine to the age of twentie yeeres
for otherwise it is as much as to put fire to fire
and yet if we would follow the counsell of the sages it should not be drunke at all except in certaine indispositions which might happen to the bodie according as the vse was in times past in greece namely at athens where wine was onely sold in apothecaries shops as now is
but aboue all heed must be taken that in the great heat of the yeere wine bee not drunke that is cooled by snow yee or verie cold water as we see by great curiositie done among vs
for it greatly hurteth the braine the sinewes the breast the lungs the stomacke the bowels the spleene liuer reines bladder and teeth
and therefore it is no maruell if they which ordinarily vse it are in time tormented with the colicke and paine of the stomacke also with conuulsions palsies apoplexies difficultie in breathing restrainment of vrine stoppings of the inward members the dropsie and many other great and dangerous diseases

it resteth for conclusion of this discourse that wee say somewhat concerning wine distilled through a limbecke in a bathe of water which the sages haue called for the admirable vertues thereof water of life
for to make which take of the best wine a certaine quantitie according to the vessel wherein you will distill it and that fill to the third part of the pot or bodie then couer it with the head thereof verie well closed so that no vapour may issue out set it vpon the furnace ouer a moderate fire in such sort that the wine boyle not
and to haue verie good you must distill it fower or fiue times and more for the more it is rectified the perfecter it will be
and in the first distillation it is sufficient to receiue the tenth part of the wine put into the limbeck for the second the halfe for the third another moitie or lesse so that the oftner you distill the lesser you haue but better alwaies
now you may know whether haue attained to full perfection by these signes if it arise to the like quantitie of water or verie neere as the liquor put in if being lighted or set on fire it burne al away and leaue not any

marke of moysture in the bottome of the vessell if a doth being dipt therein and lighted will not burne at all if a drop of oyle being cast therein sinke to the bottom and if a drop of this water spilt in the palme of your hand doe presently consume and euaporate
now the vertues and properties of this are verie many
for as it preserueth from all corruption those things which haue beene steeped therein so all corruption being done away it keepeth repaireth mantaineth augmenteth and prolongeth the life of those that receiue it
and it doth not onely preserue the naturall heat and mantaine it in vigour but it also regenerateth the vitall spirit quickneth and warmeth the stomacke sharpneth the braine and vnderstanding cleereth the sight repaireth the memorie especially if they vse it who are of a cold temper being subiect to rawnes of stomacke windines and other cold maladies
thus then haue we declared enough concerning the plants and fruits which the earth produceth for the commoditie of man
wherefore we will to morrow consider of the diuersitie of terrestriall creatures created to the same ende that we may be the more induced to glorifie him from whom we receiue all these benefits

the end of the tenth daies worke

the eleventh daies worke
of terrestriall beasts and especially of serpents namely of the aspis or adder and of the viper
chapter

aser

being this day to discourse concerning liuing creatures of the earth so much as the subiect of our speech doth require for the accomplishment of our worke it behooueth vs to consider that the terrestriall beasts being as it were innumerable in the species yet they consist of two principall kindes to wit of insect and of perfect beasts
they of the first kinde are called of the latins by this word insecta because of the incisions which appeere vpon their bodies retayning life in that part which we behold diuided and cut off and they are engendred for the most part of putrefaction but these things agree not with perfect creatures who take their forme in the matrice
now we will here summarily entreat of insect animals generally and consequently of the most excellent of their kinde whereof some creepe vpon the earth

as serpents others fly as flies
we are first then to note that all insect beasts are wilde and are verie hardly tamed and made milde for they haue their inner senses verie weak whereas such creatures as are made tame and familiar must haue the facultie of imagination and good memorie
moreouer these kindes of beasts haue little blood or none at all as philosophers hold who finde in them a certaine vitall humour onely which nature hath giuen them insteed of blood for which cause they are naturally fearfull and feare hindreth creatures from being tamed
likewise they haue commonly but short life and beasts who should be made familiar require time for that purpose
furthermore in this kinde of insect beasts some are engendred onely of putrefaction as flies others of egs as serpents and also by another manner which is perfected in the matrice by egs as

the viper
now in al this kind of beasts they are most admirable which we haue heere named to wit serpents because of their greatnes and puissant effects and or bees and also because of their worke

but amongst the many kindes of serpents

the aspis or adder is very worthie of consideration and much to bee feared for there are three sorts each whereof causeth him that is bitten by them soone to die except he bee quickly and very well succoured
one sort is named ptyas another chersaea both and the third is called chelidonia which abideth about banks of riuers specially of nilus
the ptyas and chersaea are of ashie and greene colour drawing a little to the colour of gold
but the chelidonia hath a blacke backe and white belly like to swallowes
and both the one and the other sort are of fiue cubits long in the regions of africa
they raise vp their necke when they will cast their venim wherewith when one is attayned their present remedie is speedily to cut away all that which is bitten or else it is hard to saue them from death and yet many speake of diuers remedies and amongst others they commend verie strong vineger aduising that it should be giuen to the patient to drinke euen so much and for so long time till he feele the qualitie in the right side of his flanks for they say that the liuer is first depriued of feeling in such an accident
some vse opopanax a drug extracted out of panaces heracleum which is giuen to drinke in wine mixed with water to cause them vomit the venim alreadie spread throughout the whole bodie
and after such vomiting they must take verie good treacle in drinke and apply it also vpon the biting
mattheolus describeth a quintessence

composed of and some simples and aromaticall drugs which is an excellent remedie of great efficacie when such accidents happen
for indeed it is most certaine that waters artificially composed and ingeniously distilled consisting of most subtile parts are in a moment dispersed throughout all the veines and arteries and euerie part of the whole bodie
and therefore they cause that the blood and spirits waxe not cold and doe not congeale in those vessels which containe them whereby also the naturall heat comming to augment it selfe doth strongly resist the force of the venim and doth presently surmount it

the viper also is a kinde of serpent it hath a flat head

and

broad neere to the ioint of the necke which is naturally small it hath a quicke eie and a naile in the nosthrill thereof hauing all the rest of the bodie short with the taile also and is of a pale colour
her pace and motion is verie quicke and she beareth her head aloft she differeth from other serpents in that they lay but egs and she bringeth foorth her yoong ones aliue which before they come foorth do so gnaw and eate her belly that she liueth not long after
and although the viper be verie venimous yet is her flesh verie good for the composition of treacle yea though her venim remaine with her after death
moreouer the biting of the viper is as much or more dangerous then that of the aspis for they who are hurt die within seuen howers after except they bee well succoured and at farthest within three daies except they be holpen by excelle~t remedies of which amongst others this is good cleane a chicken in two and lay the inside of her hot vpon the wound and do oftentimes reiterate this order scarifying the flesh round about the biting applying diuers times cupping glasses thereto
after which you must giue the patient of the iuice of ashtree leaues to drinke and lay the same leaues vpon the wound or else cammomill brayed or a plaister made of barley meale honied vineger
some vse bryar taken in drinke with wine or the iuice of baulme leaues drunke also with wine
some say also that the viper being flayed hir taile and head cut off and her intrailes drawen out and cast away afterwards sod like an eele and eaten by him that hath bin bitten doth greatly aide him to obtaine health
as treacle also being chiefly made of vipers flesh eaten and applied to is a singular remedie in such accidents

could here discourse of many other kindes of serpents but it is not our intent to represent a perfect historie of liuing things considering that many authors haue written thereof for our learning
wherefore wee will content our selues onely to adde to that which we haue saide concerning serpents

how that plinie hath noted that in the indies there are so great and such prodigious ones that they will swallow an hart or a bull all whole and that in the daies of attilius regulus generall of the romaines in time of the wars against the carthaginians there was seene a serpent in africa of an hundred and twentie foote long neere to the floud of bagrada which was assailed with engins of warre and all manner of weapons in such sort as if they had determined

to giue assault to some strong citie that in the raigne also of the emperour claudius there was a serpent killed named boa which was founde in mount vatican that had a childe found whole in her bellie
this author doth make mention of a certaine towne in italy called amycla

which had beene abandoned and left desolate of the inhabitants by reason of serpents that chased them away
but this is most admirable which he reporteth

that spiders seeing a serpent laide along vnder a tree where they haue weaued their cobwebs will runne directlie downe by a threed vpon the head of the serpent and will pierce him so to the quicke of the braine that they will constraine the serpent to hisse and gnash his teeth to tumble and torment himselfe without euer being able to get away or breake the spiders threed in such sort that he shall still remaine there

he saith also that a locust will kill a serpent in wringing him hard by the throat will not loosen till such time as he be through dead
but who wil not greatly wonder at that which the same author testifieth to haue seen by experience

that a serpent enclosed enuironed with ashe leaues on the one side and fire on the other he should rather choose to cast himselfe into the fire then to saue himselfe through the ashe leaues so much is this tree contrarie to serpents that they euen flie the shadowe thereof both at morning and ceuen and indeed to drinke the iuice of the leaues thereof and to lay the same leaues vpon the wound is a soueraigne remedie against all their bitings
whereupon plinie taketh occasion to note how that nature doth heerein shewe herselfe a verie benigne and prouident mother towards men in that the ash should alwaies budde before serpents should creepe out of the earth and that these trees should still be greene till such time as serpents should haue withdrawne themselues
now let vs speake of the other kinds of insects chosen by vs as the most excellent to wit bees and silkewormes concerning which amana let vs heare you discourse

of bees and of their honie and waxe and of
chap

amana

manie graue authors haue not disdained diligently to search out and curiously to describe the historie of bees being chiefly mooued therunto through admiration of their cunning in composing two so excellent commodities as are hony waxe we will here then deliuer that which we esteeme to be most woorthie of note in their writings

first bees are rusticke and wilde or tame and familiar
and the wilde are more illfauored to beholde more fierce and naught
of the tame there are two kindes
one kinde are round and short and of diuers colours and these are the best
the other are long and like to waspes and the woorst of these are rough and hairie
all of them hate stincks and infections and fly from them for which cause they neuer sting such as are perfumed with sweete odors
they neuer flie against the light nor vpon any flesh nor to bloud nor to any fat thing but doe onely seek out leaues flowers which haue an odoriferous iuice
they delight in harmonious sounds and noises whereby it commeth that being scattered they are assembled togither by the sounde of a bason or of some little bels or by clapping the hands gently togither
they vse great policie amongst themselues and there is no swarme but hath a king and captaine which is bigger then all the other bees and hath short wings straight legs a brauer march then all the rest with a spot in his forehead which serueth as a diademe or crowne and is in euery part more slick smooth and faire then all the rest
when hee goeth any whither the whole troupe followeth encompassing garding him not permitting that hee bee easily seene
and whilest all are at worke the king goeth from place to place cheering them and he himselfe doth nothing else
he neuer commeth foorth except when the whole troupe goeth into the fieldes which may be knowne certaine daies before by the noise which the bees make within their hiues attending for some faire day to part in
if the king loose a wing the troupe doth not forsake him for alwaies euery one of them desireth to be neere him and to do him seruice
and

if he be wearie they helpe him on their shoulders if tired they carie him and in what place soeuer he resteth all the swarme encampeth if perhaps they loose him they establish a new king of the race of the former hauing alwaies diuers elected and knowne amongst them to succeed those that faile
for the rest of their gouernment their witte is no lesse admirable then their worke as is recorded to haue beene obserued by aristomachus solensis who delighted himselfe for
yeere togither to nourish diligently these little animals so much he loued them neuer applying himselfe to any other thing
by which kinde of meanes it was knowne that in the day time the bees ward and watch at the gate as in a campe and rest in the night till such time as one amongst them being as sentinell wakeneth them with two or three sounds as it were of a trumpet
then all of them assemble to see if it be faire weather for they can iudge of the winds and of the raine and in foule weather they bouge not but if the weather be faire and calme all goe to worke
some bring in their feete that which they haue drawne out of flowers others beare water in their mouth and some againe helping them with a smal haire do lade themselues with drops of water ouer all their body
the yoonger sort go foorth to do these things and the older trauell within the hiues where their offices are appointed them
for some build others polish this brings in matter that victuals another water and all of them haue all things common and obserue equalitie in meate and worke
they watch who are idle and chastise and punish them euen sometimes by death
first they make their combes and waxe whereof they builde their lodgings
after they be lodged they consider how to multiplie themselues and last of all they make their honie
and they haue this wittie industrie to mixe in the matter wherewith they first besmeare or ouercast their hiues the iuice of the most bitter herbes they can finde to the end to put such small beasts or flies out of taste that woulde sucke thereof euen as if they had beene informed that their worke was sought after
in briefe all their manner of life order and policie is euery way admirable

but what may wee say particularly concerning their hony and wax

the vse whereof is so commodious and profitable to man it is certaine that these industrious creatures know how to choose and gather a kinde of dew which falleth from heauen at the rising of certaine stars especially in the vpon the

leaues of plants whereof they make hony
and the best is that which is of a deepe yealow colour and hath a pleasant smell beeing pure and neat shining euery where and sweete in tast beeing also of a meane substance betweene liquid and thick
in vertue it hath the propertie to hinder corruption and rottennes and therefore some make gargarismes thereof to clense and mundifie the vlcers of the mouth
it preserueth life especially in those that are of cold complexion so we behold that the bee which is a feeble and tender creature liueth nine or ten yeeres because shee is nourished by honie
it is abstersiue opening and attracteth humours
beeing in time applied to any part of the bodie which is bruised by some blow or fall it is a singular remedy to heale any such bruise if so bee the skinne bee not broken
and the wax which is made of the combes taken out of the hiues

after that they haue beene well pressed and that all the hony hath been drained out is likewise of singular vtility for men
the best should be very yealow sweete fatte light pure close euen neat and clensed from all filth
it is of meane quality betwixt hot cold moist and dry things and is of a grosse and clammie substance retaining an hot and resolutiue vertue which also aboundeth in hony
it is ministred in drinke against dysenterias but aboue all it is profitable in the composition of ointments which are made for wounds

now let vs speake of silkewormes which next to bees merit most admiration amongst all insect beasts
this worme is first bredde of another worme of the same kinde which hath hornes for thereof co~meth a snaile which afterwards produceth the silke worme called bombyx and by some necydalus which is like to a butterflie and laieth egs through the copulation of the male and female out of which egges in the end those wormes creepe who by so maruailous industrie do make vs our silke that in a short time is drawne out of their mouth by a small threed which afterward is weaued with such wondrous art that therein is nothing broken false or vneuen but euery whit perfect from the beginning to the end of euery bottome or clewe beeing one fastened to another
and that which maketh their labour seeme more wondrous is that these creatures are without flesh bloud or bones without vaines sinewes or arteries without scales or any intrailes as also outwardly they are seene to bee without teeth nailes prickles or bristles haire eies or eares and yet in

lesse then fortie daies how small soeuer they bee when they are engendred they become thick and great hauing the benefit of eating and sleepe and they cast their skin foure times
and then their body beginneth to glister oftentimes shewing the skeane of silke which is in their bellie which if they must make white they haue their head as white as siluer if the silke must bee yealow their head wilbee like gold if greene or tawny their head will beare the signe thereof
then do they seeke where to fasten it and so weaue their silke in order till such time as they haue performed their worke which doth not onely serue for clothing for men but for a singular remedie also to comfort a to reioice it and recreate sadde and melancholie spirits as wee may acknowledge by that excellent confection called of phisitions alkermes which for the most part compounded of the decoction and infusion of silke in the iuice of kermes beeing drunke is a soueraigne medicine against faintnes and syncopes
but hauing already said enough concerning insect beasts for the subiect of our discourse wee will consequently speake of some perfect beasts according as wee shall make choise of as of the most worthy to enrich our present worke to the end as wee haue decreed that the creator may bee glorified whereof aram you must now entreate

of the dog and of the horse
chapter

aram

amongst perfect beasts the dog and horse do by good right deserue the first and chiefe degree aswell because of their admirable sense as also because of the vtility pleasure and commodity which they bring to man
concerning these creatures

then shall our present discourse intreat and first of the dog which as many authors affirme tooke his originall from the woolfe being tamed by the industrie of man
now there are many sorts of dogs all which we may comprehend vnder two kinds the one is of them which are to keepe house and the other to chase withall

the ought to be of grosse and bigge bodie being square set and rather short then long his head great his throate wide thicke lips bigge hanging eares his eies blew and blacke burning

and sparkling his necke thicke and short his brest large and rough his shoulders broad legs thicke and hairy and a short and thicke taile which is a signe of force for the long and small taile noteth swiftnes his pawe and nailes great his barking high bigge and fearefull aboue all vigilant and very watchfull not running heere and there but staied and more slowe then hastie
hunting hounds are of sundrie sorts

they which are swift are either white or browne or gray or blacke
and the white are best for they are well winded quicke fierce wil not leaue the chase for any heat whatsoeuer neither will breake off for the prease of hunters nor for the noise and cry of men and they obserue change better then any other kinde of hound and are more certaine but they feare the water somewhat especially in
if they bee cleane white or spotted with red they are the better
the browne doth second them and are of a great courage forward quicke and fierce fearing neither water nor cold but they cannot endure heate and are not so easie to gouerne as the white
the graie are not so quicke and furious as the rest neither yet the blacke who are commonly the biggest bodied
yet there are good dogs of all haires and colours but to choose a faire and good hound indeed these signes must be obserued
his head must be meanly thick more long then flat his nosthrils wide and open eares broad and reasonable thicke crooked reines thicke loines bigge and large hanches faire thighes the right well knit the taile thicke neere to the raines and the rest small to the end the haire vnder his bellie rough a thicke legge and the pawe of his foote drie and like to the pawe of a foxe great nailes as high behinde as before and the dogge must be short and crooked but the bitch must bee long
for open nosthrils declare the dogge to be well winded crooked raines and straight hams signifie quicknes the taile thicke neere to the raines long and small to the end denote strength and force in the raines and that the hound is well breathed haire rough vnder the belly declareth that he is painefull fearing neither water nor colde a thicke legge foxes foote and great nailes demonstrate that he is not heauie footed and that he is strong in members to runne long without tiring
besides houndes there be bloud hounds tumblers and mungrels all which are of diuers kindes but our meaning is not to set downe an entire narration thereof considering

that it is not necessarie for that purpose which we haue decreed in our discourses
wherefore we will content our selues to note in generall that there is no beast of greater sense and loue nor more docible then the dog
for there be few things fit for the pleasure of man but may he easily taught to this kinde of creatures especially in all points concerning hunting
also histories abound with testimonies of their knowledge and loue towards those that nourish them
plinie reporteth of a dog

which defended his master being assayled by theeues till such time as they had slaine him and that after his death the dog would not leaue his bodie but kept it both from the birds and from other wilde beasts that would haue deuoured it
that another dog also knowing one amongst a troupe of people that had slaine his master flew vpon him and bit him with such furie that the murtherer was constrained to confesse the cause of the dogs rage reuealing his owne misdeed

now speak we of the horse

which of al beasts is most profitable for man and is full of meeknes and docilitie
he is praised in seuen and twentie conditions of which he seemeth to take three of the woman to wit yoong age meeknes of maners and beawtie three of the lion courage force and to be tall before not bowing in the midst nor higher before then behinde three of the eagle a good eie a little head and to beare his head straight and aloft three of the oxe the foote great thighes moderately thicke and short and strong ioints three of the hart quicknes deliuernes to runne and leape well and lightnes three of the asse strong hoofes an hard skin and a strong and able backe three of the foxe a faire taile agilitie and a faire skinne three of the goose to eate well and quicke and to digest it to haue full bowels and in his pace his feete equally distant without enterfiering and three which are proper to himselfe a quicke and easie pace liuelines promptnes and gallantnes of hart and readines to obey the bridle and spurre without being slow therein
if then we will know when an horse is perfectly faire

we must first note that he haue a small head a gallant and faire forehead drie and cleane flesh great and blacke eies and standing out short sharpe and straight eares little drie and thinne lips and not vneuen a wide throat big open and red nosthrils his neck neither too short nor too long but meane loftie not too fat and crooked like an arch and vault with a fine curled long maine

also that he haue a large breast soft and bearing out like that of a doue big boned legs but leane and drie of flesh straight high and euen from the foote to the knee thicke long fat sinewie and fleshie thighes but yet answerable to his buttockes sides and flanks high heeles thicke and short ioints and not close to the hoofe which must be hard high round blacke and hollow he must also haue the backe short not bunched nor high like an asses back but euen not too high nor too low broad long great straight and well flesht shoulders a smooth strong massiue thicke and as it were a double crupper a short taile of bone smal strong long haired which he must beare close betwixt his thighes a large and round flanke full sides and long aboue the belly which must be round small and well set vnder the sides that must be broad and long with a little distance from the hinder part to the ioint of the haunch and with small and equall cods

moreouer he must haue to be good a stately pace a deliuer trot a swift gallop a light course a bounding and sudden leap an assured and readie pace quicke at hand and prompt to turne euerie way to recule backe and to runne suddenly forward not stamping or ratling with his bit nor kicking against the spur but conforming himselfe to the will of his master without starting or being afraid of any thing that he seeth heareth or feeleth not flinging and kicking amongst other horses
in a word that horse is to be esteemed which hath a liuely and couragious hart which is obedient gentle deliuer quicke and wel mouthed hauing a good foot

and strong reines
for haire the bay is best of all others which being of diuers colours doe depend neuerthelesse vpon these fower bay rushet blacke and gray
for these fower colours proceed of fower principall humors whereof the bodie of an horse is composed and which agree and accord with the fire aire earth and water
for choler which resembleth the fire engendreth the bay blood which accordeth with the aire produceth the rushet or reddish coloured
fleame which is answerable to the water causeth the gray and melancholy which agreeth with the earth begetteth the blacke
the bay haire then excelleth all others as beeing that which beareth the signe and marke of a couragious horse hardie in warre and most singular in iusts and combats in so much as hee feareth nothing nor looseth courage howsoeuer he feele himselfe wounded because also hee seeth not by reason of his colour the bloud

runne streaming out of his bodie
the russet haire betokeneth a quick hardy and prompt horse but not of great force and the black is melancholy and vnsound and the gray is heauy and fearefull
moreouer by how much more these colours are diuersified and mixed with markes and spots by so much is the goodnes or badnes of the horse greater
we may also say truely

that amongst all the beasts which god hath created for the seruice of man there is not one which may compare with the horse either in beauty labor vnderstanding or profit and commodity
for the horse onely serueth for an honorable grace for man who makes him to goe at his pleasure sometimes softly sometimes a pace now a trot anon a gallop another time with swift posting speede and sometimes he plaieth with him causing him to make many risings and diuers bounds and leapes another time he maketh him runne wheeling about in a round ring then to bound and rebound and lastly to goe easily forwardes
and by meanes of this vse and exercise a man chaseth away melancholie humors fortifieth his stomack and whole bodie and augmenteth his disposition grace and ability moreouer there is no iourney so difficult which hee will not vndertake with a good horse knowing that he can passe any whither and saue himselfe from the assaults of theeues and robbers yea and oftentimes the horse fighteth with feete and teeth for the safety of his maister
but these generous beasts doe especially declare their valor and courage in the cruell encounters of battailes and fights beeing incited by the fearefull noise of gunshot by the hideous thundering of cannons by the sounding of trumpets and rumbling of drummes then say when all beeing in confusion it seemeth that the earth opens that the place flies in peecs and that hell swallowes vp all in respect of the shiuering of launces clinking of armor and the dreadfull cries of men who are there by thousands hewen in pieces
and many do scape by the onely meanes of their horses god shewing them such fauour as histories are full of testimonies thereof and of the admirable sense wherewith nature hath endued these beastes
amongst which alexanders horse bucephalus is very much celebrated chiefly because that hee would not suffer any to ride him but his maister although he had beene cloathed in kingly robes
it is also said that this horse beeing wounded at an assault of thebes he would not permit alexander to mount vpon another till such time as hee had brought

him out of all danger

plinie reporteth that a certaine king of scythia beeing ouerthrowne in battell when his enimie came to disarme him his horse ranne vpon him with such fury that he killed him reuenging so the death of his maister and that after the death of king nicomedes who was slaine his horse would neuer eat but died through hunger and sorrowe and that one named antiochus seazing vpon an horse of one galatus slaine in fight mounted thereupon reioicing at the death of the other which the horse of the vnderstanding did in rage and despight so fling and runne that he bare antiochus ouer mountaines and rocks casting himselfe at last downe from an high place so breaking his owne and his riders neck
but wee haue said enough hereof
now achitoe let vs heare you continue the discourse concerning beasts

of the elephant of the camell and of the rhinoceros
chap

achitob

it seemeth that there is no beast which approcheth neerer to the sense of man then the elephant
for he is endued with so excellent witte discretion and memorie that he surpasseth in these guifts all other beasts

as he doth in strength also
he is bigger then two great oxen couered with black haire hauing eies like to those of swine and such a mouth also beeing couered with a truncke or snout that hangs downe to the ground which serueth him for an hand to put his victuals into his mouth both meate and drinke and out of both sides thereof two great tuskes do issue which are fastned in his vpper iaw
his eares are two spans broad his thighs and legs thick and long in such sort that some are found of fifteene foot high his nailes beeing fiue in number about his feete are round and each naile a palme broad and his taile is about three handfuls long
in many regions of africa they vse these elephants to ride ordinarily vpon and they serue for many domestick businesses also so that the trafficke of them there is as that of horses here
but the indians vse them in the war putting vpon this beast a certaine saddle beeing girt very streight about him with two iron chaines vpon which they set two wooden

houses on either side one and in each of those houses doe three men lodge betweene which houses and the elephants neck is a little seat placed vpon which a man sitteth like as if hee were on horse back who guideth this beast by his words which he vnderstandeth very well and he carrieth neither bridle nor halter nor any thing else vpon his head
and euen as they which are within these houses vpon his back are armed with coats of maile with bowes launces swords and targets so likewise will he bee couered with a maile especially vpon his head and snout to which men fasten a sword of two fadomes in length thick and as broad as a mans hand wherewith this beast doth helpe himselfe in fight
in all things else he is of incredible force
for lewes de barthema in the discourses of his indie voiages doth testifie that he did see three elephants alone draw a ship out of the sea and set it a land after the people had gotten vnder it three great wedges of wood
for kneeling downe vpon the earth on the they did with their heads cast the ship on dry land

plinie recordeth many other wonders concerning these beasts saying that they honour the stars and principally the sunne and moone that some haue beene seene who beeing sicke haue fallen downe casting vp herbes towards heauen as if they would offer vp the fruits of the earth in sacrifice and praier to obtaine succour from aboue that all of them doe honour a king and fall downe vpon their knees before him and that they bring chaplets of hearbes and flowers vnto him

that some of them haue beene seene to record by themselues in the night time that which they haue beene taught in the day time to the ende that they might the better put it in practise
that marching in troupes the eldest amongst them goeth formost as captaine and another behinde them as ordering the rereward that intending to passe any riuer they put the yoongest elephants formost knowing that the great elephants would sinke lower because of their excessiue heauines and would by that meanes make the fourd more difficult to passe by reason of the water which would gather there
that they doe no harme except they be prouoked thereto and also that they are so gentle towards other weake beasts that passing by a flocke of small cattell they will gently turne backe with their heads all those beasts which they meete for feare of hurting them or treading them vnder their feete
they are verie long liued euen to two hundred or three hundred yeeres as aristotle

affirmeth and when the male and female couple together as man and woman they withdraw themselues for this purpose into most secret and hidden places and the females bear their yoong ones for two yeeres together and do neuer bring foorth but one and that but once onely in their life
of their teeth is the true iuorie made but because there are but few to be had therefore some saw and cut in pieces the bones of elephants which they sell for iuorie
moreouer historiographers report that the first time that elephants were seene at rome was in the triumph of pompey after he had subdued africke for he had two yoked to his chariot and that in the turnies and which germanicus caesar made to shew pastime to the people of rome there were elephants that leaped as if they would skippe and daunce and that fortie two elephants were brought in triumph to rome after the memorable victorie which ruscius metellus did obtaine in sicily against the carthaginians

the camell is also a verie tractable beast and profitable to man verie ingenious and apt to receiue discipline
for they serue to ride vpon to beare great burthens and also to shew men pastime in many exercises which is taught them by vse
there are some in all parts of the world but they abound in africa
and the arabians hold them for their greatest riches and possessions
there are three kindes of them one whereof is verie great another sort are verie little these two kindes hauing but one bunch vpon their backes and the other are of meane stature and haue two bunches each whereof are fit to carrie burthens and to ride vpon also besides some of them resemble asses in colour and some are reddish and they haue their hoofes almost clouen in two but not exactly so that their foote expresseth a kinde of semblance of fiue toes fleshie vnderneath which maketh them tender in stonie places
the best camels are those of africa because they beare their charges for the space of fortie daies together without euer eating any oates but onely such grasse as is in the fields or some boughes and their least burthen is of a thousand waight being by a naturall instinct so vrged to the seruice of man that with the least touch which may be vpon their necke or knees they will presently bend and kneele vpon the ground to receiue their loade which when they feele to be answerable to their strength they rise againe vpon their feete
there are some of them so swift that they will run fiftie miles and more in

one day but these are of small stature being good for nothing but to ride vpon
the noblemen of arabia numidia and africans of lybia do neuer vse other steeds
and when the king of tombuto would haue any matter of importance to be signified to the merchants of numidia with speed he sendeth a poste vpon one of his camels who runneth from tombuto to darha or segelmessa in the space of seuen or eight daies which are about fower hundred and fiftie french miles being a countrey full of deserts so that the way is verie hard to finde out but by the verie direction of the camell it selfe
when these beasts are lustie which lasteth for fortie daies together with them they waxe verie fierce and outragious and will remember the least blow that their masters shall strike them with a sticke so that if they may fasten their teeth vpon any of them they will lift them vp into the aire then cast them downe againe and murther them with their in terrible and grieuous manner but that time being passed they become gentle and tractable as before
they neuer drinke but from fiue daies to fiue daies and sometimes they stay nine or fifteene daies whether it be by custome or that this beast is drie or else that nature hath so well prouided that this creature which liueth in deserts should haue no need to drinke oftentimes in those places where water is seldome found
he daunceth at the sound of the trumpet and seemeth to reioice at musicke refreshing himselfe and taking new courage then when being tyred with a tedious iourney his guide beginneth to sing some merrie song

and some also haue beene seene to daunce at the sound of a tabor as the author of the description of africa doth testifie

now speake we of the rhinoceros which is named by some the bull of india being admirable amongst other beasts

for he is almost as big as the elephant his thighes are bigger of the colour of wood being all naturally armed with shels which he beareth like bucklers
he hath in the vppermost part of his forehead an horne for the length of a span or more very hard strong straight and verie sharpe which turneth towards the forehead and when he will fight he whetteth it
and there are some also which haue another little horne vpon the skinne of their backe which is so hard and difficult to penetrate that no arrow how sharpe soeuer it be can pierce it thorough
and therefore the indians arme themselues with their skins as we doe with harneis

and murrions and couer their horses with it as we doe ours with barbs and armour
this beast hath continuall warre with the elephant and is his great enemie fighting chiefly with him yea and with all other beasts when the female bringeth foorth her yoong ones of which the male is so carefull that nothing dare come nigh him but he will wreake his furie thereon
and he remayneth for the most part victorious ouer the elephant if he can picke him vnder the belly as being the softe place of all his bodie
for when the rhinoceros doth strike him there he giueth him so deepe a wound that the elephant can hardly scape death
and he hath this wit naturally that when he will prepare himselfe to fight he whetteth his horne against some rocke which horne the indians vse in many things and especially against all poyson so that being bitten or stung by any serpent or other venemous beast they haue their recourse to this horne
whereupon the author of the vniuersall cosmographie taketh occasion to suppose

that that which is attributed to the vnicorne is the propertie of the rhinoceros and that the pieces which are shewed vnder the name of are of the horne of this considering that there are as many such vnicornes as plinie solinus and munster write of as there be phenixes or griffrons
but omitting such disputations let vs consider vpon other excellent beasts the discourse whereof aser referre to you

of the lion of the tigre and of the panther
chapter

aser

of all beasts the lion doth beare away the chiefe price
hee hath a long bodie of tawny colour a fierce looke his taile long which he oftentimes mooueth his haire before soft and broad his skin impenetrable his hinder part narow a great head a wide throat his necke and teeth so strong that hee can carry away a camell and he is armed with very great and strong clawes besides he is so hardie that hee feareth not alone to assaile two hundred men
and then are they in their chiefest strength when the haire of their neck is so long that it couereth their neck and shoulders
africa nourisheth many of these beasts being most cruell especially

in the kingdome of fez and in all aethiopia but they which keepe in the colde mountaines are not so dangerous nor so troublesome to men
for in a litle towne named pietra rossa which is very neere to a forrest that stretcheth out all along the foot of a mountaine of the saide countrey lions doe oftentimes enter with so great mildenes that they gather togither and eate the bones and other things which they finde cast about the streetes and the women and children are so accustomed thereto that they are in no wise afraid of them
so many historiographers doe write that the lion onely amongst wilde beasts will doe nothing to those that couch and humble themselues before him
and how furious soeuer he be yet will he rather runne vpon a man then at a woman and will neuer set vpon children except he be very much oppressed by hunger
he knoweth when the lionesse who by nature is very lasciuious and wanton doth suffer to be couered by the leopard and then doth hee runne furiously vpon her to chastice her which causeth the lionesse to haue the craft to go wash herselfe in some riuer to take away the sent of the leopard who hath beene with her or else she will follow the lion a farre off to the end that he may not smell her
this beast drinketh little and eateth but in one day of twaine and if he be well sufficed he will remaine three daies after without eating
when he findeth himselfe assailed with shot he declareth his greatnes of courage in that he maketh no account thereof endeuoring to defend himselfe by the onelie hideousnes of his countenance and it seemeth verily that hee protesteth to be constrained to annoy those who pursue him in defence of himselfe in such sort that rather through rage then for feare of death he sets him in his owne guard
and he demonstrateth also another generositie of hart in that that feeling himselfe ouermatched both by dogs and hunters if it be in an open fielde where he may be seene he will make semblant to despise and scorne the hounds sometimes making head against them and will retire by little and little for his honour alwaies standing vpon his guard but after that he hath gotten the woode where he may not be seene to flie he runs away as fast as he can knowing very well that the place couereth his shame
if he feele himselfe stroken and wounded he can marke him who gaue him the blowe and will euer turne vpon him how great a number soeuer there be of people and yet for all his fury he quaketh to heare

the rumbling of wagons and is afraid to see a cocke which setteth vp himselfe and clappeth his wings and more afraid when he croweth but aboue all he feareth fire
they say also that lions be neuer sicke but through pride and that they which nourish them being minded to chase them yea to madde them do tie apes neere vnto them whose trickes and gestures they take in scorne and vexe themselues much thereat
but it is strange that these furious and proud beasts are tamed by the industrie of man euen to make them so familiar as to serue them
for histories report that marcus anthonius during the ciuill warres of the romanes caused lions to be coupled to endure the yoke and draw his chariot and that hee entred rome in triumph in such equipage
that hanno also captaine of the carthaginians did first vndertake to touch lions with his hand and that hee made them go vp and downe the towne like little dogs whereupon the people doubting so quicke and pearcing a wit which could inuent how to tame the fiercest beast of all others tooke occasion to suppose their common welth but badly assured in his hands

and so they banished him
belon also in his obseruations recounteth that there is an ancient church at constantinople to euery piller whereof there is a lion tied which the great turke causeth to be nourished and that their gouernors loose them handle them and tie them againe when they list sometimes leading them through the citie

the tiger approcheth neere to the force of the lion and is more to be feared because of his crueltie and swiftnes which they finde true who chase after their yoong ones
for when they carie them away running with all speede vpon good horses the tigresse returneth to her denne and finding it emptie taketh her course as swift as the winde following them by the tract which haue robbed her of her yoong ones who perceiuing her approch by the noise that she maketh vse to cast her downe one which she taketh in her mouth and carieth to her denne with incredible speed how heauie soeuer it be and afterwards returneth to the pursuite of the rest alwaies pursuing her fawnes till such time as she beholdeth that she cannot come at those who beare them away because they haue gained some towne wherein they are immured
these beasts are very common in hircania as also in the indies and in aethiopia and the inhabitants there do hunt them much because it is a very dangerous beast which

would do much harme if it might multiplie as also because their skinne is very faire whereof they make very excellent furres which haue spots of diuers colours wherewith they cloth themselues
but howsoeuer cruell the tigre is yet the hircanians do nourish and tame them for their pleasure
and plinie affirmeth

that the tigresse hath such feare and respect of man that so soone as she perceiueth him out of her denne she presently conueieth her yoong ones thence whereupon this author doth take occasion to admire the power of nature in that the greatest and cruellest of all beasts do presently vnderstand wherefore to feare without euer hauing seene any thing before which might cause feare
he recounteth also that the emperour augustus was the first that euer shewed the people of rome a tame tigresse in a cage and that after him claudius caesar shewed fowre at a time

the panther is another common beast in the regions of of africa very sauage and whom the inhabitants dread much

some say that the lucernes and leopards are one kind of beasts and that they serue for males to the panther not differing from them but in whitenes which is very great in her hauing little blacke spots set vpon her body in manner of eies
also very faire furres are made of her skinne which are called lucernes
moreouer some say that all beasts do very much loue the smell of the panther but the fiercenes of her countenance doth feare them and that to entrap other by her odour she hides her head that she may catch them
some also write that she hath a marke vpon her shoulder like to an halfe moone which augmenteth and decreaseth as the moone doth
this kinde of beasts haue the craft to watch passengers in woods hiding themselues close in the thickest groues of trees which they can finde out of which they start vpon them like theeues
and they haue this by nature to fold in their clawes whe they go that they may alwaies keepe them sharpe vnbroken and can open them when they wil shut them when they graspe any thing
but omitting the fiercenes of this beast who will not greatly admire the sense and imagination of a certaine panther whereof plinie writeth

she desiring to meete with some passenger lurked close in the midst of an high way one by chance comming thither finding hir would for feare haue turned his bridle to flee
but the poore beast couched and fell downe before him making signes to fawne vpon him and moaned and tormented hirselfe in such sort as hee

might easily vnderstand thereby that shee was in great paine and indeede hir young ones were fallen into a pit farre off from that place
the man taking hart at the beasts manners who drew him gently by the garment did follow hir to the same pit whither beeing come and knowing the occasion of the panthers greefe he drew hir yong ones out of the place whereinto they were fallen deliuering by this meanes their damme of paine and redeeming also his owne life
for this beast which could haue bereft him of it did contrariwise in acknowledgement of the benefite receiued by him leaping and skipping with hir little ones keepe the man companie out of the forrest shewing him by many signes that shee rendred thankes vnto him
but here change we talke and let vs heare you amana deliuer that which you haue learned concerning the nature of other beasts

of the woolfe of the beare and of the ape
chapter

amana

amongst all sauage beasts there are none more common then the woolfe
for asia africa europe and many places of that fourth part of the world which late cosmographers and other famous men haue by their long nauigations discouered do nourish these creatures
and although many haue thought that england had none of them yet there are some found in sundry places and especially about barwick
and in times past the country hath beene much vexed by them
but histories record that edgar their king who liued in the time of lotharius king of france a very politicke prince beeing aduertised of the spoile which these beasts did made an edict throughout his land that euery nobleman should bring vnto him each yeere tenne woolues or else the skinnes of them and that the prince of wales as he who receiued greatest commodity by hunting of them should euery yeere bring him an hundred
whereby it came to passe that in lesse then tenne yeeres there was no mention made of any of those beasts
now though they bee very common yet are they therefore worthie of no lesse consideration

and woonder
many authors haue written concerning their shape manners nature and differences as also how to hunt and take them
there bee few which are ignorant that the woolfe is a beast hauing gray haire mixed with black

whitish vnder the bellie a big head armed with long and strong teeth and short and stiffe eares whereupon the prouerbe arose hold the woolfe by the eares when he which speaketh is in doubt of what hee shall doe
this beast feedes onely vpon flesh saue sometimes on fish although aristotle and plinie write

that beeing oppressed with hunger hee eateth earth
but indeede this opinion did first spring because that these beasts are oftentimes seene to dig vp the fieldes for flesh which they bury after they haue had their fill to serue them when they want ought to pray vpon
when they be sick they know how to vse certaine herbes to make them vomit and to loosen their belly and their custome is to assaile weake and fearefull persons that trauaile alone much rather then hunters
they are so knowne to the fisher men along the lake of meotis as plinie reporteth that these honest people are wont to giue them part of their fish which if they faile to doe

they will in the night time teare and breake their nets
when the she woolfe hath yong ones if she find hir selfe oppressed with dogs or men she taketh one of hir whelpes in hir mouth to beare away that shee may not loose them all
and shee neuer leaues them except the hee woolfe remaine for their gard going both by turnes out for victuals and if they haue taken any beast they bring it vnto their whelps laying it downe before them to feede vpon if they be somewhat big they will then bring home some lamb aliue to make them kill it and teach them their craft
but finde nothing more admirable in the nature of the woolfe then that which hath beene noted by the author of the country farme

that there breede and engender certaine serpents in the kidneies of an old woolfe which being growne doe at last worke their breeders death and become very venemous things
concerning the subtlety and craft of woolues to intrap their praies it is very well knowen by euerie one being to the great hurt of people but their industrie is verie great in forrests where they can tell how to hunt the hart does watching them in fresh places as hounds should do yea they can direct themselues like a course of greyhounds to watch lurke in the borders of the wood whilest others hunt within
besides it is a common thing and many haue written therof yea isidore himselfe that if a woolfe espy a man be+fore the man perceiue him he can take away his voice because that with his corrupt breath he infecteth the aire which being so putrified doth also corrupt the breath of the man neer to the said

beast whereby he remaineth depriued of voice and hoarse howsoeuer he be endomaged thereby and that is it which hath begotten the common prouerbe lupus est in fabula which is said when one speaking of another that comes in vnlooked for doth hold his peace as if that the other parties arriual had taken away his voice and speech
but if the woolfe be first seene by a man it is thought that this malitious effect is not of so great power and that he looseth much of his fiercenes the cause whereof may be that knowing himselfe discouered he hath not the leisure to spread abroad his venim and insteed of running vpon the man he deuiseth how hee may runne and flye from him
if this reason be of any value doe not thinke that it hath beene yet written by any one at leastwise as haue read or heard
there is also another kinde of wolues

called lynx the furre of whom princes weare which as plinie saith resemble other wolues but that they are spotted like leopards
and oppianus writeth that they are engendred by a woolfe and a panther yet that cannot be affirmed of the lynx of germanie for there are no panthers

the beare is a beast in whom many things are found woorthie to be noted
barbarie and newfound land nourish a great number whom the inhabitants do hunt after diuers manners
but they doe chiefly entrap them by meanes of certaine deepe pits couered ouer with leaues and branches which they digge in the way that these beasts are accustomed to frequent and especially neere vnto trees where there is some swarme of bees for the beare loueth honie aboue all other meate whether it be for that he delightes to glut himselfe therewith or else to heale the sorenes of eies whereto he is very subiect and so passing vpon these pits he falleth thereinto and is there slaine by these barbarians
the male when he couereth the female doth embrace her as man doth woman and the she beare being full doth retire apart into her den not bearing aboue thirtie daies and doth oftentimes bring foorth fiue which at first doe seeme to be but an heape of white flesh without any forme without eies without haire and is as small as a mouse with some little apparance of nailes but through very much licking the she beare reduceth them into such forme as they haue
when this beast is vnprouided of a caue he buildeth his lodging with wood of which he makes so huge an heape and piles it so well that the raine cannot enter thereinto
after that he paues it and makes

his litter with the softest leaues of trees that he can finde
in winter time the male keepeth within his den for fortie daies long and neuer bougeth and the female for fowre moneths and the first fourteene daies they sleepe so profoundly that it is impossible to wake them though they be beaten with staues and one would not thinke how fatte they then be this time being past they sit vpon their taile and liue of nothing else but by sucking their forefeete
being come foorth of their denne they first eate of the herbe called or to open their pipes which are all as it were stopped vp
their foode is corne leaues of trees grapes apples honie creuises and ants which they vse especially licking them vp with their toongs from off the ground when they are sicke with eating the fruite of mandrakes for by this meanes they heale themselues
they go vpright vpon their hinder feete when they list descend downe trees backwards
and when they fight against the bull or other horned beast they hang themselues by all their fowre feete vpon them and vpon their head that they may thereby tire their enimie and so vanquish him
to conclude there is no creature more subtile in his simplicitie

but if we would speake of craftie beasts

subtile in all agilitie and sport then must we haue respect to the ape
for nature hath bestowed very good sense and meruailous craft vpon him
also he doth verie neere approch to the shape of man both in his forme of countenance nose eies and the vnder part of which there is no beast that hath except the ape
he hath also nipples vpon his brest like a man and vseth his hands and legs as man hauing nailes and fingers made and disposed as ours of which the middle most is longest
his intrailes likewise are almost like to those of man
africa and many isles of the lands nourish these creatures in great plenty and of diuers kinds some whereof are called monckeies and they haue long tailes and others are iackes or marmusets and they haue none they liue of herbes and corne and when they meane to steale some cares of corne there assemble twenty or thirtie of them togither and one staies for a scout out of the fielde where he no sooner espieth the lord of the ground to come but he squeakes verie loud at whose crie all the rest runne away and do saue themselues by nimble flight climing vp trees and skipping from one to another yea and the she apes with their yoong ones vpon

their shoulders will leape from tree to tree like the rest
and they are commonly so fond of their yoong ones that with too often embracing and too much clasping them they at last kill them
they which are tamed and taught do meruailous and incredible things
besides the author of the vniuersall cosmographie hath noted

that in the solitarie island there are apes greater vnhappier and wilder then are in all the world else which be named magots who being seene a farre off a man would iudge them to be humaine people
whereupon he thinketh that some are a little deceiued who haue written concerning sauages and men being rough all ouer their bodies like goats liuing vpon snailes and rawe flesh hauing perhaps taken such magots because they haue not beene neere to distinguish them for verie men
but enough of this would now haue you aram to pursue the subiect of our discourse

of the hart of the bore and of the vnicorne
chapter

aram

will now speake of the most gentle and simple beast of all the world

in his nature and which neuerthelesse is endued with great force which he sometimes vseth to the cost of those who hunt him and that is the hart or stag in whose chase great lords take much pleasure
he is so simple that he museth is astonished at euerie thing in such sort as if he see a cowe or an horse come neere vnto him he neuer taketh regard who rides him or if he perceiue him hee lookes downe at his feet as if he were amased what bowe arrowes or weapons soeuer he haue
he museth also at the songs and piping of shepheards
when stagges be not in rut they are verie sharpe at their victuals and feeling themselues fat they search out solitarie places apart and there abide knowing verie wel that they are not the apt for the course that they are then also chiefly hunted
being pursued they doe ofttimes stay their flight to take breath and looke here there round about them but when they perceiue the hounds that follow them they runne as before
and they make these stops by reason of a certaine pipe which doth greatly paine them and which is so tender that it presently breaketh with the least wound that may be
they

endeuour to runne with the winde that it may carrie with them the sent away from the hounds so that they may not easily take them
they heare a farre off and haue a verie good eare when they stand vpon their feete but if they lye downe they be verie deafe
plinie recounteth

that when the harts or stags of cilicia will passe from thence into cyprus they swimme ouer the sea but alwaies in troupes and in order resting the heads of the one vpon the crupper of the other and that by turnes in such sort that the hindermost goe before in their turne and the foremost turne behinde directing their course by the smell of the lande because they cannot see the shore
the bucks onely are armed with hornes and they alone of all beasts cast their hornes euerie springtime yet some haue seene but verie seldome marked to twelue yeers
when they feele that their hornes will fall they seeke out the most solitarie and desert places that they can finde whether it bee to hide them because they are ashamed to haue lost their armes or else to disappoint men of the benefit that doth redound vnto them thereby for their horne hath many properties in vse
and many say that of those hornes which harts cast the right are neuer found againe so that it is holden for certaine that they bury their right horne
their age is knowne by their heads because that euerie yeere they haue a knag more and there are some seene that are marked to two and twentie beyond which none doth note their age although they liue much longer
for histories record that aboue an hundred yeeres after the death of alexander the great there was an hart taken about whose necke this prince whilest hee liued had put a coller of gold and that he was growne so great afterwards and so fat that the said coller was hid within his flesh and couered with his skinne
moreouer stags doe change their place of aboade and their food according as the sunne doth approch in height
for in the moneth of nouember they keepe themselues to bushes and briers the tops whereof they eate to restore their nature after they haue beene in rut
in december they withdraw themselues into the thickest of forrests which may defend them from the cold windes snowes and yee
in ianuarie they come to the borders of the forrests and to tilled landes to feede on greene corne as rie and such like
in februarie and march because they loose and cast their hornes they thrust themselues amongst the bushes wherein they remaine all aprill

and may
in iune and iuly they goe into woods and and then are they fattest
and in september and october they leaue their woods and fall to rut and then haue they neither any certaine place nor meat because they follow the waies which the does haue passed liuing then with a little and feeding vpon what they chaunce to meete with

the bore is another beast in whose chase many exercise themselues and take singular pleasure but as the hart is gentle and fearfull so is the bore hardie and furious not fearing the dogs but attendeth for them in quiet and oftentimes also hee pursueth them to teare them in pieces with his teeth the biting whereof chiefly in the chest of the bodie is almost incurable
his place of aboad is neuer certaine therfore some say he is but a guest bicause he doth but run out of one forrest wood into another and yet he delighteth to remaine in the same countrey and place wherein he was first farrowed so that if any dogs chase him out of any wood or forrest he presently runs without any stay to his natiue place which he supposeth to be his safeguard and refuge
the meate which he liketh best is and acornes
his flesh is better then and therefore the auncient romanes made such account thereof that in their most magnificent bankets they would serue in whole bores to be set vpon the table

yet plinie saith that the bores of the mountaines in pamphilia and cilicia hauing eaten salamanders become verie venemous in such sort as they poyson those that eate of their flesh
besides when these beasts feele themselues more heauie then of custome they seeke for iuie and eate thereof or else for crabs which they finde in sande when the sea ebs
the sow or female beareth but once a yeere although the bore be verie apt to couer her
and the author of the aforesaide naturall historie doth affirme vnto vs that in the indies there are verie great wilde bores which haue two tuskes in their mouth of a cubit long and two other that issue out of their front like the hornes of a cow
and cardanus saith that in the same countrey there are bores like to others in forme in voice and maners and in their litteridge which are growne in two moneths and yet are smaller then conies and can scarce bite differing nothing from other saue that they haue fiue or sixe toes vpon their feete insteed of nailes

but let vs leaue these fierce beasts to consider vpon some

others and let vs speake first of the vnicorne

which at this day is so greatly esteemed of the horne of whom is holden of great vertue in phisicke and singular against all poysons

plinie describeth the vnicorne to haue a bodie altogether like an horse an head like an hart feete of an elephant and the taile of a bore bearing an horne in the midst of his front of two cubits in length and he saith that these beasts are nourished in the lande of the orsians in india
lewes de barthema in his nauigations into arabia affirmeth that he did at meca see two vnicornes and saith that the bodie and colour of this beast is like an horse of a darke gray hauing feet clouen before and hoofed like a goat
and that these two beasts had been giuen to the soldan of meca for a verie rich and precious present by a king of aethiopia to the ende to haue peace with him

belon hath obserued out of the testimonies of diuers authors that there are two sorts of beasts who beare one horne onely one of which is the asse of india which hath not clouen feete and the other is the orix being a kinde of goate that hath clouen feete
and he maketh mention of manie vnicornes hornes esteemed to be of verie great price especially of two which are in the treasurie of saint marks at venice each of them being of a cubit and halfe long the greatest ende whereof exceedeth not aboue three inches ouer
he speaketh also of that which our king hath which is at saint denis being seuen foote long and waigheth thirteene pounds and fower ounces in fashio like a taper being broad at the lower end about a plame and three fingers and so groweth lesse and lesse towards the ende and hath a pit in the great ende aboue a foot deepe which is the place wherein the bone is fastned that holds it firme to the head of the beast that beareth it
but this author doth mocke at the folly of those who many times doe buie pieces of bone which are cut of the teeth of the rohart of the hornes and ribs of many other beasts for true vnicornes horne paying sometimes for one of these little pieces three hundred ducats so much is vnicornes horne esteemed being most excellent for many vses in phisicke
theuet also flouteth at these abuses

and at many fables inuented vpon this matter alleaging that he had seene an horne taken from a beast of a cleane contrarie shape to that which the vnicorne is described to be of whereto the same vertue was neuerthelesse attributed
and that the countrey of the sauages breedeth a beast called pyrassouppi as big as the

foale of a mule hauing almost such an head as rough as a beare and clouen footed like an hart which beareth two long straight hornes that do come neere to vnicornes horne and wherewith the sauages cure themselues when they be bitten and wounded by venemous beasts and fishes
but now chaunge we our talke and achitob let vs heare you speake againe concerning some of the most rare and worthie beasts of the earth

of the hiena or of the of the beuer and of the otter
chap

achitob

if in all our discourses we haue any woorthy matter wherein to admire the workes of god in the nature which he hath ordained vnto them wee shall finde no lesse in the consideration of these whereof purpose now to speake the odour of whom is very sweete
and amongst the rest the ciuet cat called by ancients the hiena is woorthie of great maruell
for from her commeth an excrement so odoriferous that assoone as it is smelt doth pierce through all the senses and spirits and serueth to compose verie excellent perfumes

this beast is fashioned like a bedouant but of bigger bodie hauing blacke haires about her necke along the ridge of her backe which she setteth vpright being angrie
she is mouthed like a cat and hath fierie and redde eies with two blacke spots vnder them and round eares like vnto those of a badger
besides she hath white haire full of blacke spots vpon her bodie with a long taile blacke aboue but hauing some white spots vnderneath
the ancients haue spoken of this beast as of a wilde cat

and iohn leo in his description of africke doth name her so saying that she is common in the woods of aethiopia where the people do catch her with her yoong whom they nourish in cages with milke and porridge made of branne and flesh and that they receiue ciuet from her twise or thrise a day which is the sweate of this beast for they beate her with a little sticke making her leape vp and downe about the cage till such time as she doth sweate which they take off from vnder her thighes

and taile and that is it which is called ciuet
belon reporteth to haue seene one in alexandria so tame that playing

with men she would bite their noses eares and lips without doing them any harme and that she was alwaies nourished with womens milke
mathiolus likewise saith that he hath seene manie ciuet cats at venice which had bin brought out of syria and attributeth certaine properties to their excrements for which cause they haue beene more sought after now then in the daies of our fathers so that they are nourished at this day euen in france

cardanus also maketh mention of a beast called zibetum which is found in spaine that is like to a cat and carieth a bladder in her members the seede whereof is receiued into a spoone being of so excellent an odour that three drops thereof surmounteth the waight of three pounds of anie odoriferous tree

but the doth yet surpasse all other odour

and meriteth all maruell in the nature thereof
for it is a beast like vnto a goate in forme and haire but that she is of a more blewish colour and hath but one horne and is bigger of bodie
there are many in africa but chiefly in tumbasco and sini
when this beast is in rutte with the heate and rage that he then endureth his nauell swelleth and filleth it selfe with a certaine bloud in manner of an impostume which at length through much wallowing and rubbing against trees he maketh to breake out of which runneth this bloud being halfe corrupted which in tract of time becommeth very odoriferous
and the people of the country do gather it amongst stones or vpon the stocks of trees as the best muske that is bicause it is full ripe after that it hath rested some certaine time out of the bodie of the beast which engendreth it and that it hath beene perfectly concocted by the sunne which the other muske cannot be that is taken out of the liuing beast after that it is catched in chase
and therefore this most precious muske is shut vp and reserued in boxes and in the bladders of such of these beasts as haue at any time beene taken to serue to such vses as it is fit for wherupon commeth that there are muskes very different in goodnes
for there is but little brought to vs in true bladders of this perfect muske being ripe and gathered as before saide but all the flesh of this beast being beaten togither with the bones is commonly put into an old bladder and sold vs for pure muske
which we may verie well know in that we vsually finde little peeces of bone in our muske
and yet this same thus prepared smelleth so sweetely that we

may easily iudge how precious and exquisite the odour of the true and perfect muske is

the castoreum which proceedeth from the beuer is also verie much esteemed for the vertue of the sent thereof
this beast is as bigge as a dogge long gentle of blacke and a shining haire with a very long taile and feete like a goose hauing strong teeth and so sharpe that he vseth them as a sawe to sawe and cleaue timber whereof he maketh himselfe a lodging with marueilous cunning
they are found neere to the riuer of ister or danubius and neere to the rhine also and in many places of africke
in his stones doth lie a most exquisite licour which is proper to him and therefore plinie reporteth

that the beuer feeling himselfe oppressed with hunters biteth off his stones with his teeth as if he knew wherefore he were pursued and that is it which phisitions call castoreum

cardanus affirmeth that this beast is a kinde of otter euen as are a kinde of wilde wesels
for saith he in one selfe same kinde of beasts nature doth by little and little conuert it selfe from small to great ones from foule to faire ones and from weake to strong ones
besides the otter called by plinie lutra liueth commonly in the earth

and in the water and hath haire softer then feathers and his stones are fit and profitable for the same that castoreum is
but as matthiolus hath very well noted the vse of strange compositions doth bring many discommodities to those

which thinke to serue themselues therewith bicause they are either sophisticate or corrupted before they come to vs
and therefore he saith that the vse of ponticke or common castoreum which is blacke with rottennes and putrefaction is very venemous
but me thinketh companions that we stretch out too long our discourse concerning terrestriall beasts considering that we haue not vndertaken to write a perfect historie of them but only to set before our eies some of the most rare most excellent to make vs meditate vpon to admire the workes of god
there are many authors out of which one may gather the entire knowledge of liuing creatures and especially out of aristotle who hath described their nature in fiftie bookes by the commandement of alexander the great and after him plinie hath declared vnto vs in his naturall historie many things concerning the same subiect which were not knowne before
wherefore as when we entreated of the spheres meteors we referred al to the true astronomy philosophie

of christians so let vs now do as much vpon discourse concerning beasts reducing all that which we haue spoken to an inward meditation vpon the prouidence of god considering that the effects thereof do continually appeere in the commoditie profit and vtilitie which redound vnto vs by these creatures yea by the most venomous of them as aser you may giue vs to vnderstand

of the right vse of venemous creatures and wilde beasts and of the iustice and bountie of god which shineth in them
chapter

aser

vve must needes beleeue for a principle that if sinne had not entred into the world there had neuer any creature beene hurtfull vnto man
for hee had beene a peaceable lord and master of all liuing things and all things had beene obedient vnto him if hee had beene obedient vnto god as he ought to haue beene

we haue a cleere testimonie thereof after the fall of adam in those beasts which came vnto noah at the floud to enter and remaine within the ark with him

as also in those lions into whose denne daniel was cast
but as man hath beene very rebellious towards god not acknowledging him for his lord according as duty did require him euen so all creatures which should shew obedience to man not onely haue beene and are rebellious towards him but do also many times make war against him and do greatly annoy him euen according as it pleaseth the soueraine lord to chastice and punish the sinnes of men by the meanes of them
in this sort then must wee thinke vpon venemous and cruell beasts who doe not onely seeke to hurt vs but doe also serue the wicked wherewith to compound their poisons
for wee behold how god hath created many and diuers kindes of them who beeing good in their nature insomuch as they haue all beene created by god and in that hee is a worker who cannot performe any euill busines they doe neuerthelesse oftentimes greatly hurt men in steade of ministring aide vnto them yea they do sometimes also worke their death
and therefore wee must consider that the fault doth not proceed from the creature created good but from

the beeing punished by the iust iudgement of god by such scges of his iustice as it pleaseth him to make choise of the worke neuerthelesse which he hath done by his creatures remaining good insomuch as it serueth to chastice those who do deserue it

there are in earth and in the sea many very venemous beasts who by their poison kill men as are serpents vipers scorpions and such like
and although it may seeme that these creatures haue beene created onely but to doe hurt yet hath not god giuen their beeing without good and iust reason
for hee hath so well disposed all things that venims and poisons themselues serue very well for many other vses then to kill and impoison for they are profitable and necessarie in many occasions and serue for medicines and remedies in diuers accidents
and concerning their particular effects which turne to the dommage of man besides that which wee haue said that they are instruments of the diuine vengeance vpon sinne god will thereby moreouer make them acknowledge and perceiue their infirmity and what all humaine power is when it riseth vp against his maiestie and that men thinke to resist him
for who may bee so dull and disfurnished of reason that cannot vnderstand how vnsure their life is and how feeble their force and power considering that there needeth but some small venemous herb or some little portion of other venim and poison or the stinging of some small beast or the biting of some others which are but as wormes creeping vpon the earth doe not onely say greatly to torment but also to bereaue of life the greatest and most fearefull giant or prince in all the world
herein then haue wee a goodly example to teach vs to know what we are what we can do and how we must feare and bee in continuall doubt though wee suppose our selues to be neuer so strong and mightie
and we may also instruct our selues when we behold that there is no man so assured but that is somewhat mooued and receiueth some feare yea and many times very much at the onely sight and meeting of an adder or viper or of some other venemous beast
wee may also imagine that if the eternall creator of euery soule doth shew himselfe so much to be feared in such small and vile creatures who doe not subsist nor retaine any power but such as proceedeth from him what might this bee in comparison of his whole puissance if he would declare it vpon his enimies but indeede this neede not because he can

doe his pleasure by far lesse force

as when he was displeased with the proud arrogancie and peruerse obstinacie of pharaoh and of the egyptians who held the god of the hebrewes in disdaine he would not war vpon them with great armies of men but did onely raise vp troupes of frogs of flies and of lice against which the proud tyrants could not resist but remained vanquished
againe how did hee after that chastice his people in the wildernes by fierie serpents how many times afterwards did he bring many people into extreme necessity as if a strong armie

or fire had passed through their country and that onely by cankerwormes catterpillers and such like vermine wherewith he threatneth those that rebell against his statutes and doe we not consider what vexation oftentimes flies lice wormes rats and mice doe put vs vnto haue we not goodly occasion to bee proud high minded and to esteeme much of our selues seeing that there is not so much power in vs as to inuent the meanes how to defend and saue our selues from such little creatures who trouble vs day and night both at home and abroad and may we not heereby iudge how we could defend our selues from wolues beares lions tigres and other sauage and wilde beasts in whom there is no doubt but that we haue verie euident signes and testimonies proposed of the wrath and furie of god for who is so stout that is not much scared to encounter with or to heare the voice onely of any of these beasts we know that god hath menaced the transgressors of his commandeme~ts with them
for he saith thus will send the teeth of beasts vpon them with the venim of serpents creeping in the dust

and so hath he oftentimes done in the lande of samaria and in iudea yea not sparing the yoong children as was declared in them who were deuoured by the beares because they mocked the prophet eliseus
how many such examples of the wrath of god do histories set before our eies that haue beene executed in the daies of our fathers yea amongst vs who cannot be ignorant how that many times wolues haue deuoured little children digging down the house sides for them they beeing close by their parents wherefore sith the lord did say by amos the lion hath roared

who will not be afraide the lord god hath spoken who can but prophesie let vs learne two things first that if the onely voice of the lion terrifie those which heare it by much more reason must the word of god mooue vs secondly that the true seruants

of god cannot be silent when the lord shall haue commanded them to speake but will attribute all glorie to his name not standing in feare of venemous serpents wilde beasts and other scourges of his wrath but dreading the omnipotent only who executeth vengeance vpon the wicked when and how he pleaseth

and as by this discourse we must acknowledge the image of god being angrie and the pattern of his furie in all those creatures which may hurt vs and how much he is to bee feared and dreaded in his most high maiestie considering that his iudgements are so terrible being executed but by the smallest creatures of the earth so on the other side must we consider vpon the great bountie and benignitie of god of which he giues vs testimonies not onely in beasts created to the onely purpose to serue and profit man but also in those which seeme not to haue beene made but onely for their hurt
for as we haue alreadie said venims and poysons may serue to many other vses then to kill men and venemous beasts are not so full of poyson throughout all their bodie but that they may profit in sundrie occasions witnes the viper a most fearfull serpent whose flesh is verie requisite in the composition of true treacle which is a most soueraigne remedie against all venim and poyson
and there are manie verie dangerous diseases against which this flesh of the viper and of other serpents is verie profitable according to the testimonie of phisitions
who likewise teach that the scorpion whose stinging is mortall carrieth with him the true remedie for health if he be brayed and laide vpon the wound which hee hath made or else if being burnt the ashes of him bee drunke with wine
but how many rare properties doe they assigne to the oyle which is made of scorpions in briefe to speake in a word there is no beast so venemous none so sauage none so cruell be it great or small by which men may not receiue much profit if their nature were well knowne
all which we may better learne if we consider how that many creatures are nourished with that which to others is venim and poyson the discourse whereof amana let vs receiue from you

of the nourishment of many animals by that which is venim and poyson to others and of the naturall amitie and enimitie which is amongst them

it may seeme to many that hornets caterpillers spiders and such like vermin were not created to any other ende saue to endomage men but though we doe omit a thousand properties which all these creatures haue by nature seruing to vse in phisicke and that we doe but onely consider how they serue for food and nourishment to many other creatures yet shall we in this haue enough wherein to acknowledge the profit which doth returne vnto vs from most vile and contemptible creatures and by so much the more magnifie the prouidence of god who ordaineth all things for our good
for it is verie certaine that these small creatures which otherwise seeme to bee vnprofitable doe serue for food and meate to birds and foules and to such fishes as we doe ordinarily eate of so that we may rightfully say that we our selues are nourished by and such other vermin considering that we eate those beasts that deuoure them and doe liue vpon them
let vs but onely note the meate which and other common foules whom we so carefully bring vp for vs to feede vpon do most seeke after
certainely there is no beast which eateth more vncleanely and filthie meate for they spare neither serpents nor toads and yet we esteeme of their flesh egs and chickens as of verie good and delicate meat
this is in truth a maruellous kinde of naturall chimistrie and inimitable art

so to sublimate that which of it selfe is poison and would prooue so to man that hauing passed through the limbeck and fire of a small creature it is not onely purged thereby from al annoyance but doth also sustaine life and serue afterwards for holesome nouriture to man
and do we not behold that the nightingall and the are fat with eating venemous spiders which serue both for meat and a medicine to them plinie hath written

that deere and quailes do feede vpon poyson

and yet euerie one knoweth that their flesh is a delicious kinde of meate
but what another woonder is this which the same author declareth that there be certaine beasts which are not venemous of themselues and yet are dangerous meat when they haue eaten any venemous beast or herbe for in the mountaines of pamphilia and of cilicia the bores that haue eaten salamanders are verie venemous in such sort as they poyson those who eate of their flesh and yet they themselues can conuert such poyson to their owne nourishment
what reason can we giue of so excellent a secret in the nature of beasts haue neuer yet learned any reason of the philosophers
let vs then stay at the admirable effects of the prouidence of god who in those beasts which we doe commonly eate for our sustenance doth performe this maruellous chimistrie whereof wee but now spake and who causeth the force of poysons to be spent in the deserts to the small hurt of man to the end that his omnipotencie bountie and benignitie may be declared in all things towards vs

moreouer haue we not also worthie matter whereby to giue glorie to his name in that he hath created the beasts so different in nature with a naturall and secret amitie and enimitie which they do greatly beare one towards another for it is verie certaine that god maketh all this serue to the profit and commoditie of men in so much as there is a kinde of amitie commonly in priuate and tame beasts towards such as they are all seruing him who hath bin established for their master and that enimitie doth rather remaine amongst wilde beasts as also in tame beasts towards the wilde in such sort as many sauage beasts which doe nothing but harme haue by this meanes many of their owne kinde their aduersaries to make head against them and to resist them in whatsoeuer they would doe
but wee may especially woonder in that the most mightie great and strong beasts yea the most furious and cruell are commonly put in feare by the smallest and most weake
for what is an hog in regard of an elephant or a cocke in respect of a lion there seemeth to be no comparison betwixt them and yet the onely voice and grunting of an hog maketh the elephant afraide and the lion is not onely seized with feare at the crowing of the cocke but is much troubled when he seeth him but set vp his crest
also there are verie little beasts who doe not onely put verie great and cruell

ones in feare but do also kill them as the ichneumon which is a little rat of india doth kill the great and cruell crocodile a most dangerous serpent cleauing and piercing his belly after it is secretly entred thereinto thorough the mouth of this beast which is able to deuoure men and yet striketh no feare into this feeble creature

which as plinie recordeth hath another warre against the aspis ouer whom it remayneth victorious by this meane
it doth manie times wallowe and tumble in the dirt and as many times doth dry it selfe in the sun then feeling it selfe sufficiently armed with slime it assaileth the aspis alwaies holding vp the taile against him to receiue the blowes thereupon which the serpent shall strike wherewith hee can in no wise offend the bodie of the ichneumon in the meane space it picketh out some such fit place to strike him through the throat that hee therewith dieth and presently after it doth prepare it selfe as before to fight with another
in this discourse wee may behold a perfect image of humaine things considering that we cannot be ignorant how that it commeth oftentimes to passe that god abateth the most mightie and strong tyrants by the most lowlie and abiect persons and kings princes and people by meane and very men
and let vs also note that although the amitie and enmitie amongst liuing creatures proceedeth from a certaine instinct of nature so disposed by the creator and the causes whereof are either hidden or hardly knowne that neuerthelesse the best reason and most certaine which may bee alleadged concerning those examples which wee haue here touched is that god would declare vnto vs in them how hee doth mock at the pride and arrogancie of men and at all their puissance and force
for if hee bestowe so much power vpon little beasts as to affright yea euen to slay the most furious and that hee can ouerthrowe and destroy the most stout and valiant amongst men by their owne selues how much more should hee astonish them if with his almightie hand hee should beate downe their pride and punish their sins in his ire though the people saith the prophet rage and murmur

though kings band themselues and princes bee assembled togither against the lord yet hee that dwelleth in the heauens shall laugh the lord shall haue them in derision also they shall perish in the way when his wrath shall suddainely burne

now concerning that which particularly respecteth the amitie

betwixt priuate and domesticall beasts and their hate towards those that are wilde although that the neerest cause be very euident as that they do loue one another because they are nourished togither and receiue no domage one from another hating the wildenes of those who desire to deuoure them yet must wee passe farther and acknowledge another more remote and yet most certaine cause therein which is a naturall instinct to conserue and multiplie their owne kinde for the vtility and seruice of man according as the bountie and benignitie of our god hath by his admirable prouidence disposed of their nature whereupon let vs heare you aram plot out the subiect of your discourse

of the vtility that commeth vnto men by beasts and chiefly by priuate and beasts and of the woonderfull prouidence of god which declareth it selfe in them
chap

aram

sithence god hath so disposed all things by his prouidence for the good and commodity of men that they may receiue some profite euen out of the most venimous cruell and sauage beasts as wee haue already heard wee may in no wise doubt as indeede experience doth daily teach vs but that they do receiue great aide and help from priuate and tame beasts as are sheepe kine oxen bulles asses mules horses and such like
for we are serued with their labours and trauaile with their fruit with their flesh with their wool and with their skinnes
for from whence receiue wee our clothing except linnen but from beasts with how many sorts of wooles and of skins do they furnish vs

and from whence haue wee the silkes cloth and workes which are made and which serue to cloath the most stout and proud tyrants and other princes of the earth haue wee them not by the industry of wormes and small vermine in very truth wee may very well say that wormes cloath wormes and that the most stately amongst men doe take from the most vile amongst creatures the substance of their brauerie and pomp
for what are men but poore wormes of the earth who to make themselues a little excell the rest do take

from other wormes the ornaments of their magnificence and if we consider what commodity the milke which is drawne from some beasts doth deliuer vnto a thousand thousand persons if we consider of the great multitude that there is of all kinds of beasts of birdes and of fishes all which doe serue vs for foode and nourishment in diuers manners if how many sundry tastes and sauours we finde in all these meates of different natures according to the tasts complexions and dispositions of men and which are so tempered that they bee good for those that are in health for those that are sick for great for small for yoong for olde shall we not be rauished with all these wonders thereby to giue glorie to the soueraigne creator and moderator of all nature what shall we more say in that the skins of earthly beasts are of so many diuers colours and so well compact either of woole or of haire or of good skins of the varietie and diuersitie that there is in the feathers of birds and in the colours of them and in their songs which minister much pleasure to melancholy persons are not these so many excellent testimonies of the power of the omnipotent who created all these things through his bountie and benignitie towards vs surely there is nothing so vile contemptible in the least creature that is but doth preach the maiestie of god vnto vs
and therefore he said vnto his seruant iob

hast thou giuen the pleasant wings vnto the peacocks or wings and feathers vnto the ostrich for we see that they which will decke themselues do put vpon their heads the faire plumes of the ostrich of other foules which are sold verie deere also euerie one admireth the taile of the peacocke wherewith he sets foorth himselfe which he turneth like as into a wheele or a roundell being so gallantly garnished that there seeme to be as many eies or sunnes as there be feathers therein

speake not here of the nature of beasts nor of the industrie which god hath giuen to euerie one of them to know what is conuenient or hurtfull for them and to couet the one and auoid the other as also how they are furnished with care and power to preserue their life and the liues of their yoong ones
passe ouer in silence the power and diuers properties which consist in each of them for the discourse thereof would be infinite and we haue likewise alreadie said somewhat concerning that which is most in many rare and excellent beasts

but will here bring into the number one of the least and most common sort which wee behold euerie day in our houses for perhaps the consideration thereof will not be altogither vnprofitable vnto vs

and that is the cocke
if any question be made concerning his beautie in what birde may we finde more be it that we consider of his plumage and the diuersitie of colours which is commonly therin or of his faire kingly crest or his stately pace and braue carriage which cannot be more magnificent in the greatest monarch of the world and if this birde were not so common but were verie seldome seene there are but few other creatures which would be preferred before him although there were nothing woorthie of consideration in his nature saue that which we haue alreadie declared
what shall we say then if we will but meditate of what hart and courage he is in fight is there any other creature which can lesse endure to be ouercome and is more ashamed thereof againe what curtesie vseth he amongst the hens with whom he is conuersant and how much doth hee loue them euen to prouide for meat to feed them and to take it out of his owne beake to giue vnto them calling them when he hath found it as the henne calleth her little chickens together but that which finde most strange in him is the agreement which by nature he hath with the sunne which is such as one may verie well thinke that he hath some naturall astronomie and astrologie which is bred in him
for he vnderstandeth and perceiueth the course and motion of the heauen and of the sun and when his rising doth approch so that he declareth it by his crowing verie timely in the morning and that diuers times before any other creature can perceiue it yea or men themselues except they rise out of their beds to behold the skie
and yet for all that they must haue obtained some knowledge of the course and of the motion of heauen either by the science of astronomie or through long vse and continuall obseruations thereof as is with shepherds and those that watch in the fields
but if the heauens be couered with cloudes what can the most expert of them know therein saue by meanes of clocks which they haue in their houses the cocke then is more skilfull in this art
for without euer mouing from the place where he is at roust to sleep and what weather soeuer there be faire or fowle yet doth not he faile to sound out the chimes at his howers so as there is no clock so certaine and he serueth also for one to them that haue no

other
and therefore we may verie well say that how many cocks there are in the world so many naturall and domesticall clockes are they for those who haue them in their houses
and doe we not see how that souldiers especially almaines doe commonly carrie these creatures with them to serue as a trumpet to them to sound out the approch of day

but the cocke did not serue for a clocke only to peter but for a preacher also to recall into his memorie the words which he had heard of his master and for to draw him out of his sinne and to induce him to true repentance as he did
and the like ought we to doe so often as this birde croweth in the morning not onely to thinke our selues aduertised of the approch of the sunne which bringeth vs the temporall day after the darknes of the night but we must euerie day wake out of the sleepe of sinne wherein we are so soundly laide and prepare and dispose our selues to receiue iesus christ the true sunne of iustice which bringeth vs the eternall and perpetuall day that is neuer changed into night the light which ca~not be obscured by darknes
by this briefe discourse then we may iudge how many excelle~t matters we should find to entreat vpon concerning the nature of liuing things to make vs still more and more acknowledge the woonders of the prouidence of god if we would pursue to the full that which might be said concerning this matter in searching out the secrets of the diuers faculties of creatures
but we will content our selues onely to adde to this which we haue said that which well deserueth to be considered of in this place concerning the multiplication of such beasts as are most profitable for men and by whom they receiue most commodities whereupon achitob let vs heare you presently discourse

of the blessing and prouidence of god in the multiplication and conseruation of those beasts that are most profitable to men and by whom they receiue most commodities
chapter

achitob

the holy scripture teacheth vs how that god after he had created the beasts he blessed them saying increase and multiply

and

fill the waters and the earth
and that afterwards when the deluge had ouerwhelmed euerie liuing soule saue noah and his family and two of euerie kinde of beasts god likewise repeated the same benediction of them

saying bring foorth fruit and multiply and fill the earth
through which word that admirable fruitfulnes which we behold in all creatures did first come and is for euer conserued
wherein if we haue any woorthie matter deliuered vnto vs to acknowledge the prouidence bountie and benignitie of god towards men it is principally in this point which is notorious vnto all that the vertue of this blessing hath beene such that those beasts from whom we might receiue most commoditie and which are most tame and familiar haue much more multiplied then the other wilde and cruell beasts who might bring any perill or endomagement vnto vs whereto god himselfe had in some sort a regard when he commanded noah to enter into the arke

to take of cleane beasts seuen and seuen male and female but of vncleane beasts two and two onely
so that by this meane there did most remaine of the number of those the vse of whom was most necessarie for man giuing vs also a certaine testimonie of his fatherly bountie towards vs by which he is induced to haue respect vnto vs in all things

but if we consider what fecunditie there is in certaine sauage beasts and yet how it vanisheth and is surmounted by the multiplication of the other sort wherewith we serue our selues by a certaine kinde of manner which is altogether incomprehensible vnto vs there is no person but will finde himselfe rauished in the contemplation thereof
for let vs take for instance the wolues only
it is certaine that they are more fertile then sheepe kine other priuate domestical beasts which serue for the maintena~ce of our life to other vses for the commodity of the same
for the sheepe doth bring forth

nourish but one lambe the cowe one calfe the mare one foale and so of the rest whereas the woolfe bringeth forth and nourisheth many whelpes
moreouer none of those tame beasts no nor man himselfe doth eat any woolues but they many other wilde beasts which liue vpon praie yea man himselfe doe eate vp lambes sheepe kine and their calues and many times foales escape not and yet we neuerthelesse do daily behold how all these poore beasts which are a continuall praie to men and other creatures do encrease and multiply each

one more in his kinde then woolues and other cruell beasts who eat and deuour them
are not these then admirable effects of the prouidence of god the reason whereof doth surpasse the capacitie of our vnderstanding in very truth these things are no lesse woonderfull although there be great diuersitie of the subiect then the multiplication of the people of israell amongst the egyptians which was by so much the greater by how much the more they were oppressed by tyrannie and cruell dealing

let vs also note

how that this eternall wisedome fauouring the fertilitie of those beasts that are most profitable for man hath assigned to such as liue vpon praie and rapine an habitation in desart and obscure places in rockes caues and in dens
for so it pleased god to separate them from the other to the ende that they might the lesse annoy them
moreouer he sundered them amongst themselues in such sort that they do not liue togither in companies as others do that they might not ouerrun them
for woolues beares lions and such like do not communicate one with the other as priuate and domesticall beasts doe bicause they cannot agree one with another as the peaceable and innocent beasts
so likewise eagles haukes faulcons and other birdes of praie do not flie togither in volees and troupes as pigeons cranes geese such like do which serue vs for foode
thereupon then ensueth that wilde beasts cannot gather so much power as to hurt the other vpon whom they make continuall warre and who by this meane are oftentimes saued from perill
let vs adde in regard of birds that they of pray are not so fruitefull as those which are giuen vnto vs for foode witnesse the great number of chickens which the henne doth hatch at one time and the number of the yoong ones of patridges quailes in comparison of those who flie to deuour them
and although doues doe bring foorth but one at a time yet they recompence that insomuch as they breed almost euery moneth in the yeere
in meditation then vpon these things we must consider what and how great the bountie of god is towards vs and that all his creatures must be as so many preachers still to anounce vnto vs the puissance and infinite wisedome of him and as mirrors wherein he presenteth himselfe euery where before our eies
and when we serue him not according to our dutie we are well woorthie to be set to schoole to such masters as being beasts more brute more wilde more sauage then they who liue

with vs and are created for to serue vs
it is then as isay saide to the israelites who were ingratefull and rebellious against their god the oxe knoweth his owner and the asse his masters crib but israell hath not knowne my people hath not vnderstoode
and indeed in these two kindes of creatures we haue a goodly example to raise vs out of our sloth and ingratitude towards god if we do but consider onely what benefits do redound vnto vs by the seruice which we haue of oxen in tilling of our lands and drawing of carts and wagons and by asses in bearing all loades and burdens which are laide vpon their backs
wherein we are also to esteeme of the prouidence of god in regard of the forme of the bodies and members of these beasts
for he hath so disposed them that their onely figure and composition doth admonish men of the workes wherein these creatures must be imployed of the vses whereto they must be put
for oxen do cleerely shew vs that their back is not fit to beare packs nor saddle but that their necke is fitte for the yoke and their shoulders to draw carts and wagons whereby one may easily iudge as also by their heauines that they are vnfit to beare burdens like the asse whose backe head and shoulders are apt for the same

moreouer shall we not consider of the great bountie and prouidence of god in that he hath created the puissant strong buls so docible that men doe easily teach them to leaue all their fiercenes and make them so tame that a little yoong boy shall lead them like sheepe and put the yoke vpon their necke couple them and make them labour as he listeth this may make vs woonder at the indocilitie and wildnes of man being so difficult to correct and tame
for wee see that one onely childe can easily direct a great troupe of beasts be they oxen or buls and gouerne them himselfe but contrariwise the nature of man is so vntoward that many masters and gouernors are scarce sufficient to guide one onely childe
and what may we more say in that all the gouernment of these beasts is done without any need to muzzle their mouthes or to tye and fasten them in chaines or halters and without keeping them in bits and bridles like horses which men tame by such meanes surely wee neede not doubt but if god had not ordayned by his prouidence that oxen and buls should serue men in those vses whereto they would employ them that we should be able to draw no more seruice out of them then out of the wildest beasts that are in the world
by

so many testimonies then as we haue in the nature of beasts of the puissance bountie and benignitie of the creator of all things let vs conclude that we may verie well say to all such as doe not consider vpon the so admirable workes of god and vpon his prouidence therein that which iob said to his friends speaking thus aske the beasts and they shall teach thee

and the fowles of the heauen and they shall tell thee or speake to the earth and it shall shew thee or to the fishes of the sea and they shall declare vnto thee who is ignorant of all these but that the hand of the lord hath made all these and to morrow companions wee will take a view of the goodly riches and treasures which are hidden within the earth to wit of mettalles and precious stones the discourse whereof aser you shall begin

the end of the eleuenth daies worke

the twelfth daies worke
of mettals and especially of gold
chapter

aser

as we haue alreadie contemplated those things which appeere to be most rare vpon the earth so doe we now desire somewhat to refresh our spirits by the consideration of those things which are hidden within the intrailes thereof
that then shall be the subiect of our discourse for this day to the end that as the contemplation of the highest heauens did open an entrance into our discourse so we should conclude it by a treatise vpon that which is within the earth neerest to the center of this great vniuers to wit vpon mettals and stones
not that we intend to speake of them as by a particular description of their nature and species for then dare affirme that there are so many kindes of mettals engendred

within the earth that they cannot be particularly described and sith that nature adorneth the earth with aboue fiue hundred kindes of plants and with as many beasts it is verie likely that she exerciseth no fewer meanes vnder earth whereby to enrich it
but as we haue proposed vnto our selues no other ende in all our discourses of heauen of earth and of the creatures therein contayned but onely to consider vpon the most worthie things therein which might incite vs to an holy meditation of the prouidence of god thereby the more to glorifie him euen so will we doe in that which we now intend to declare concerning mettals and precious stones

mettall is that which is pliable by the hammer and hard stones are hard but not pliable and wax and mud are pliable but not hard
mettalles are seuen in number as the planets are
for gold representeth the sun siluer the moone amber called electrum mercurie iron mars lead saturne brasse venus and copper iupiter or else wee distinguish them in this sort
all mettall is perfect soft and pure as gold or it is pure and hard as siluer or it is hard and impure as iron or it is soft and impure as lead
and for amber it is compounded of gold and siluer as cyprus copper is made of brasse and iron containing an equall substance of brasse and of iron which causeth that iron too much concocted and high tincted is easily changed into brasse and rechanged againe into copper
but wee will now speake of gold which is the most perfect and purest of all mettalles
in very truth nature neuer tooke delight to make a more perfect elementary substance then gold is for it is as pure and neate in the qualitie thereof as are the simple elements whereof it is composed
and therefore by good right do wee hold it in price of excellencie far aboue all other riches and do esteeme it in our iudgement to bee much more precious then all other mettalles
for beeing in the composition thereof proportioned in equall qualitie fitly correspondent in the symmetry of the elements which compound it it is euen from the originall thereof so purified already as are the simple elements in such sort that by their coniunction togither in equall power there is engendred so delicate and perfect a mixture of indissoluble vnion composing an accord so faithfully that there is made thereby an incorruptible paste which is permanent to all eternity in the excellencie and goodnes thereof
wherefore gold cannot bee vanquished by iniurie of time and

of antiquitie neither can containe in it selfe nor support any excrescence and superfluitie of rust
for though it bee put into the water or fire and there remaine for any long space of time yet is it neuer stained neither doth accept any other quality but that which is naturall nor yet doth faile any whit which is the particular priuiledge that it hath aboue other mettalles
for they are all subiect to alteration and therefore change and corrupt for a small matter and accept a good or bad qualitie in their originall or end
but gold is incorruptible and therefore not subiect to such mutations yea though it bee drawne out in so small wire that it be as fine as threeds in a spiders web and though it be buried in most piercing medicaments as are sublimatum and verdegrease salt and vineger that it remaine two thousand yeeres therein it will not for all that bee corrupted but contrarywise the more refined but all gold hath not one selfe same perfection for their mines and sources are different in goodnes
sometimes also gold is counterfait sophisticate and falsified through the infidelitie or auarice of those who mingle it and multiplie it with other mixtures of mettals of lesse value and lesse pure then it is
but pure and refined gold is alwaies perfect by nature in all those qualities which wee haue already touched

and it is found in diuers manners to wit mixed with sand as in bohemia on the amongst the waters neere to goldebourgh and risegronde and amongst the stones in mountaines as in calecut and in the indies
but the first generation thereof is at the top of mountaines in the highest places because that the sun doth there more easily purifie that which retaineth too much earthines in it
and when the raine and torrents do flowe downe the mountaines they carry the gold downe with them to the foote thereof where it is gathered amongst the sand or else in waters neere thereunto whither it is driuen by violence of the flouds except perhaps the ground open with those raines and the gold doe there stick as it oftentimes chaunceth
and that which is alwaies found in the entrance of the mine is not the finest but the farther you goe the finer and purer it is of better waight and greater value
that then which is found in waters and riuers is fished for and is in forme of little graines and in rocks and mountaines it is taken out by deluing and digging

and therefore there are holden to bee three sorts of gold mines
for some are called pendent some iacent and others oblique and running
the pendent

are those which are found in the superficies of mountaines and haue the earth vnder them
they which are iacent or lie are belowe in the fielde and plaine ground carried thither by torrents and stormes of raine
and the other that are oblique haue a crosse course whether it bee in that which hangeth or lieth all whereof is driuen by flouds into the next riuers for which cause there are riuers throughout all the world the sand whereof seemeth to bee of azure and gold hauing indeede pure and fine graines of good gold

now according as the mines are so are there diuers meanes vsed to take out the mettall
for in those places which are dry without water they which are expert in the veine of mines hauing true knowledge what may be in that place do cause it to be digged eight or ten foote deepe and as many foote long and broad and as they proceede in their worke they still wash the earth that is digged vp continuing so till such time as they finde the gold which is sometimes so deepe that they are driuen to set vp arches of wood ouer them that the earth may not ouerwhelm them
and when the mines are pendent along the mountaines the difficultie is then more great wherefore they also set vp engines to defend them from dangers which are there verie imminent
for some to wit those that dig into the rocke are quite hidden therein euen as those that cut stone are within a quarrie others creepe scrambling vp the sharpe rockes with a basket at their backes seeking out the earth of the mine to carrie it to the water others wash the same earth in a sieue by meanes whereof the gold is separated remayning in the sieue after that the earth is runne out by little and little
moreouer out of these mines there issueth a stinking breath or damp which doth oftentimes choake and kill them that worke therein being not able to indure so bad an aire some also are drowned by waters which suddenly gush out of those places where they haue digged when they thinke not of any such thing quickly ouerwhelming them before they can make signe to those that are aboue to helpe them
againe these miserable poore soules are oftentimes affrighted by euill spirits who inhabite in great numbers in those hollow and solitarie places as many haue experimented to their great hurt
for sometimes it happeneth that these diuels tumble great stones and whole rockes vpon them throw downe their engines ouerturne their ladders breake their cordage and doe a thousand other mischiefes whereby men are oftentimes slaine

concerning riuers wherein the graines and sands of gold are found the dangers are not so great therein but the paine is no lesse
for if the riuer be little the indians vse to emptie and let it out till it be dry and then take off the bottome thereof and wash it as beforesaid and if the water be verie great they turne it out of the channell which done they goe to gather the gold in the midst of the riuer betwixt the stones and great pibbles so that sometimes there commeth greater profit by this fishing then by washing the digged earth to separate the gold
but howsoeuer yet is there great paines alwaies vsed to obtaine the riches of this mettall so much coueted by men and whereof the abuse is verie great as we may in some sort touch after that we haue spoken of other mettals which shall serue amana for the subiect of your discourse

of siluer amber iron lead brasse and copper
chap

amana

the most noble amongst mettals next to gold is siluer for although that copper in colour and lead in waight do neerest approch vnto gold yet in tenuitie of substance in purenes and fastnes

siluer is so like vnto it that good siluer may be rightly said to be imperfect gold in substance failing in colour and that by succession of time it is sometimes changed into gold as in many yeeres space lead turneth into siluer
the mines thereof are more ordinarie then gold mines for fraunce italy spaine england germanie and many other regions of europe do beare siluer in diuers places as well as the other parts of the world
and it is there engendred in fower manners to wit either in the earth which being gathered together and then molten in the fire doth yeeld siluer or in lead wherwith it is often found mingled or in brasse or in stones out of which it is also extracted by fire
for in the mountaine called mons regius stones retaine verie much siluer which being also put into the fire there is found in euerie pound of siluer that runneth out of them halfe an ounce of gold at least
siluer is also many times found to be mixed with copper as in alsaria neer to the rhine in the mountaines of saint anne

and in meissen for there are stones full of copper in which is great abundance of siluer
and when it is separated from lead it leaueth a scumme

which we call lithargyrium which is a kinde of impure lead

retayning some vertue of siluer
for quicksiluer though it agree in name with siluer yet it approcheth neerer to gold for it is like vnto it in tenuitie and waight and to siluer in colour onely
but for all this it is no mettall but a water condensate not by heat for it is not hardned nor by cold for then it would be a stone or mettall but by some other terrestriall rare and pure portion wherby it commeth to be verie waightie and cold splendent and liquide and is therefore rancked among those mettalline substances which differ but little from water and indeed the mountaines where quicksiluer groweth are verie greene and full of fountaines

let vs speake now of amber which wee haue put into the number of mettals
many authors do disagree verie much in the discourse of amber
for some reckon that which is called electrum amongst pliable and hard mettalline substances others will not acknowledge it to be any other then a gumme of a tree which is verie much like to that of the pine and producing rosin and is verie common in arabia the happie
philemon writeth that in two places of scythia amber is digged out of the ground like a kinde of stone and in one place it is white in another yealow
but omitting this argument we will follow those who make amber a mettall whose nature and propertie is in meane betwixt gold and siluer and that such is the true and natural amber as that which we vse in our beads is artificial
and it partaketh more of gold then of siluer because it is more pure and perfect and apt to be wrought
for if it did consist more of siluer it could not endure the forge and hammer
there are vessels made thereof for beautie and profit for good amber doth discouer poysons in these two manners by cracking and making the signe of an arch within
for when the rare humiditie thereof commeth to be consumed by the force of venim it cracketh and the colour changing it seemeth that in steed of the great splendor thereof there doth a kinde of staine represent it selfe like vnto an arch
now that this kinde of amber is verie rare it is not because there is not enough to be had in mines but auarice and ignorance of the vertue thereof causeth that the gold is extracted whereby it ceaseth to be amber

concerning iron it is taken out of the earth

and to make it malleable the masse thereof is when it is taken vp laid to drie in the sunne and that which is earthy doth soften in the raine as that which is moist doth melt by the sun and the most sharp part thereof which is as the venim of it is consumed by the fire
the mines of this mettall are common in europe as in diuers parts of france which are enriched by the forges that are there set vp to bring this minerall substance to his perfection
which by how much the more it is concocted and purged by so much the more is it better in goodnes in such sort as that which is earthy doth at last turne to scales and drosse and the most subtile part thereof doth conuert into steele after it hath beene well purged and a little marble added thereto
and this is artificiall steele

for there is in many places naturall steele namely in persia very good in the chaldean isle and neere damascus whereof the best cemiters in the world are made which cut so well that there is no rasor bee it neuer so well steeled and tempered that hath a more fine and sharper edge
for this cause some say that there are some kindes of steele and iron so excellent that waight for waight they are esteemed of greater price then gold
moreouer men may see what art can doe in iron when by much beating thereof and through the power of water iron bee it neuer so thin is made vnfrangible by blowes because that such water by meanes of fire doth consume the terrestriall and waterie excrement which is found in this mettall
when then the iron is brought to be most pure most hard and most light then is it most subtile and therefore most strong and resisteth best

lead consisteth of foure kindes
for there is black common

lead white which is ordinarily called tinne bisemutum which is of meane quality betwixt black and white and is rare and knowne but to few people though it bee found in the mountaines of bohemia and the fourth kind is compounded of stibium
the ore of lead is molten in furnaces prepared for that purpose and beeing molten it is let runne through pipes out of the furnace whither the workmen will
and whilest it remaineth very hot they cast cleere water vpon it to make the foure arise which waxeth very massiue hard to breake yealow and bright as glasse and this is that which is called litharge of lead
but this difference is betwixt white lead and true tinne

that this doth alwaies grow with siluer the other doth grow of it selfe in

such sort that tinne is almost white lead blaunched by siluer
brasse as wee haue already said is made of a matter verie neere approching to that of iron

and so also is copper
but brasse hath this propertie that it neuer rusteth as iron and steele doth and therefore it will continue longer
in times past also it was verie vsuall to make armor and bucklers thereof yea and launces likewise witnes homer who recounteth that menelaus pursued paris with a brasen launce
flutes and pipes of organes and other musicall instruments are commonly made of brasse but it doth properly agree with trumpets because it maketh a great noise in dorick musicke and inflameth men to combat
that of cyprus is harder and better then any other
some also because of copper make two kindes of brasse to wit naturall whereof the best hath spots of shining gold intermingled and there is reported to haue bin found in new spaine in america a peece of it of two hundred pound waight
then is there artificial brasse which is called copper or latten and the most excellent is that which in fower pounds of brasse doth containe one pound of white lead called tinne also when the white lead is mixed to the eight part of brasse then is the copper very good but it is base beeing mixed with black lead
for the vse of copper it is chiefly fit for faire instruments as ordinance cauldrons and such like wherein it is more excellent then brasse because also it doth not giue a bad tast nor smell to such meat as is boiled therein
thus haue wee summarily runne ouer that which wee thought most conuenient to bee spoken concerning mettals wee will now speake of pretious stones whereof aram do you begin to entreate

of precious stones and chiefely of the diamond
chap

aram

if wee first say somewhat concerning the originall and matter of stones the nature and vertue of them shall bee so much the more easie for vs to comprehend
now the originall of stones as of mettals is in the earth and they bee all made of an elementarie substance or of a pure and equall matter which is gathered togither or else is runne on an heape or else hath beene purified in some sort howsoeuer
in which

heat doth chiefly operate
for that is it which boileth the matter naturallie engendred to perfect the humor whereof afterwards

the minerall matter or stone doth consist
theophrastus distinguishing al that which doth so grow within the earth saith that some things participate with the water as gold and siluer and other mettals some accord with the earth as stones yea precious stones and all such earths as are in estimation because of their colours or of their sauors or of some other properties
but if he would infer as it seemeth that all precious stones are terrestriall if this opinion were true then should there be no precious stone bright cleere yet almost al of them are so
wherefore we may rather say that they are not earthie but watry that is to say that they are composed of a certaine humor which retaineth more of water then of earth for it is a certaine kinde of clammy slime wherein there is more water then earth which being dried and thickned through contiunance of the same operation and by the vehemencie thereof doth at last become a stone
now that a grosse and clammy humour doth easily conuert into stone we see euident in all liuing creatures and chiefly in our selues
for those stones and grauell which breed in the bladder and in the reines are ingendred of such humours as in tract of time haue beene boyled and hardned by the naturall heat of our bodie
so then precious stones which are bright and transparent are not composed of earth nor yet of water onely but are ingendred of a pure and liquid humour which retaineth in it selfe more of water then of earth
for in that these stones being cast into water sinke to the bottome it is manifest that they are not made of water onely for then they should swim aloft like yee and haile

for the splendor and light of some and obscuritie

or thicknes of others we must first note that the elements operating as in all things else in the generation of stones they participate more with the water and with the earth then with the fire and with the aire
and because that the earth is not transparent nor shining as it is euident that the water is cleer also it followeth that al the brightnes splendor of stones doth proceed from the water
therfore we say that al cleere transparent stones are ingendred of humours alike in cleernes light and contrariwise that they which are troubled obscure thicke do proceed from the earth to wit from a slimie blacke humour that retayneth much earth and but little water
and for so much as some stones are more cleere and more shining then others that proceedeth from the diuersitie of humors whereof they haue bin engendred

for some humors are more cleere and more purified then others
whereupon ensueth that some precious stones which are white haue beene generated by an humour hauing the colour of water which maketh them more cleere and more transparent then others and so of the varietie which is in the colours of all stones be they greene blew red purple yealow or of many mingled colours one must iudge the humours whereof they did proceed at first to haue beene such and that other precious stones which are not transparent proceed from troubled blacke and obscure humours for the water it selfe though it be neuer so cleere doth become blacke if it be mixed with neuer so little blacknes
and such precious stones as are splendant do shine by reason of their great brightnes which maketh their light continue and abound
as much must we iudge of the cause of staines spots shadowings cloudes vaines and other vices which are found in precious stones and of the difference that is in their massiuenes spungines lightnes waight and hardnes for all these things proceed from the diuersitie of the nature and of the colours of such humours as haue engendred them

now amongst precious stones these beare away the prise and are praised with especiall praise the white diamond for hardnes and soliditie the greene emerauld for beawty the red carbuncle called the rubie for liuely colour the skie coloured saphir for grace the yealow chrysolite for splendor the diuers coloured opall for varietie and the cleere pearle for whitenes and roundnes
first then let vs speake of the diamond

for as gold amongst mettals so the diamond amongst stones is most precious
for the substance thereof is hard and for that cause the more exquisite as that is amongst mettals which is the most pliable
by reason then of the hardnes and soliditie thereof the diamond beareth away the price amongst precious stones for in colour it is inferior to the emeraulde to the rubie and to the opall
but that which maketh it most to bee esteemed is because that the filings and small peeces thereof are precious so that one scruple is sold for sixe crownes of gold and because that by the hardnes thereof it cutteth all other stones beeing not onely commodious in sculpture but also very necessarie
neither will it bee well cut or polished but by the onely filings thereof so hard it is
for which cause many haue written that the point of a dart beeing rubbed with the pouder of a diamond it will easily pierce any armor wherein this

reason is apparant that the iron or steele is heated by the blowe whereupon it may be penetrated by the subtilitie and hardnes of the diamond
which is also commended for this vertue that being polished it doth greatly glister amongst precious stones for that it resisteth fire for the space of nine daies time without hauing any sense therof and afterwards it remaineth many other daies without being annoyed
which sufficiently declareth that this stone doth co~sist of most subtile parts for otherwise it would haue pores smal holes by which the fire entring it should easily breake
the diamond then retayneth a liuely and strong splendor in such sort that it doth not only shine but doth also sparkle and is besides that vnchangeable not being corrupted by iron by moisture by fire by age nor by vse
it hath also this property that being tied to the flesh of the left arm it doth hinder withstand the feares of night
it is not then without good cause that this stone is so much esteemed by vs and almost by all nations
for euen in the indies in calicut in persia in tartaria and other places where rocks of diamonds are commonly found they are verie deere and of great trafficke so that they are transported into all places how far remote soeuer they be witnes the isle of carge which lyeth in the bosome of the where bargaines are vsually made for diamond stone it remayning yet vncut from the rocke although it be scarce within sixe hundred and threescore miles of that place where it is had
and therefore it is no great maruel if diamonds be at so high a price as they are considering that they are so much in request by euerie one wherefore there are some found which are sold for twentie and thirtie thousand crownes a piece and aboue for we our selues know that there is one in the treasurie of our kings which did cost seuentie thousand crownes
wee are to note that in the mountaine of cugarquel which is neer to the riuer of goa in the east indies are the best and finest diamonds of all the world as to the contrarie in the isle of canada which neighboureth vpon florida there are found false ones but so faire and well cut by nature that the most subtile lapidaries are verie much troubled to discerne the one from the other whereupon this prouerbe did arise
loe theres a
but haue said enough hereof
now achitob doe you speake of the nature and propertie of other precious stones

of the emeraud of the carbuncle or rubie of the saphir of the iacinth and of the amethyst
chapter

achitob

the emeraud hath beene long time holden for the most precious stone of all other as well because of the beautie thereof as by reason of the manie great properties which are naturall thereunto in such sort as the price therof did exceed that of the diamond
but as the rarenes of some things make them deere so doth the abundance of other things make them to be lesse esteemed as it came to passe

that the great quantitie of emerauds which not long since were found in the countries of america hath much abated their price but not their beautie nor vertue which euer remayneth and is most excellent in those which are brought out of the for they of peru are of much lesse woorth
the greene emeraud then is the fairest of all precious stones but yet the most brittle
for it sometimes happeneth to breake euen in the act of coiture
being drunke it doth much resist poysons by the nature of the softnes thereof by reason that the abundance of the well concocted humour which is therein doth refresh the spirit by the perspicuitie thereof and so it is profitable to the nature of man and resisteth the force of venim and for so much as it is a stone it retayneth the vertue thereof stable
for we may note that all things which are pleasant to the sight are profitable for man whether it be in precious stones or gold or siluer silke or purple but aboue all the emeraud is faire if that the art therein deceiue not the sight for as well this stone as others are oftentimes counterfeited and falsified in diuers maers moreouer as the emeraud is verie soft so is it verie subiect to all casual chaunces for it is corrupted by fire and heat and by the touch of other precious stones which are harder chiefly of the diamond yea by euerie thing that can giue a blow
that which shineth most and almost like the sunne and which refresheth the sight as forrests and greene medowes doe is most to be esteemed
but beleeue there was neuer any mention made of a more rich basin then that of an emeraud being one of the greatest treasures of italie which is in the citie of

genoa for it is reported that it was pawned in the necessitie of the for fourteene hundred thousand ducats thinke then but how much this emeraud must bee woorth
but that which is also said that this is the same platter wherin our sauiour iesus christ did eat the paschal lamb in his last supper maketh me to doubt much whether there be any people that vpon one onely stone would lend so great a summe of money

the red carbuncle called the ruby is another precious stone

which is verie beautifull and hath the propertie to quicken the spirite and make it ioyfull
some authors haue made mention of three kinds of carbuncles saying that there be some which shine in the darke others also that shine if water bee powred thereupon and the third kinde is of those whose cleerenes is onely seene in another light to wit by day time or by candle light
theophrastus saith that there are some of the colour of water some of the colour of the amethyst others of the colour of the iacinth and some of a red colour which are called rubies
in the indies these stones are plentifully found and lewes de barthema reporteth that the king of pegum which is a citie in india hath carbuncles called in greeke pyropi of such magnitude and splendor that if any one should see the king in a darke place with these stones vpon him he would seeme to shine like a cleere light euen as if he were fired by the beames of the sunne

the saphir doth approch neere to the excellencie of the diamond in great hardnes in fairenes of colour

beeing of a skie colour and in beawtie and is very good for the sight if it bee not sophisticated
it refresheth a man and beeing drunke is profitable for melancholy people and for blowes bitings of scorpions and serpents
albertus magnus affirmeth that he had twise found by experience that the saphir would heale an anthrax which is a kinde of bile
which may be beleeued considering the medicinable vertue which is in this stone
for as thirst co~meth through the biting of a certaine snake called dipsas and as the hand is benummed by the touching of a little fish called remora so the venemous fire of the anthrax may bee extinguished by the long touching of the saphir but it must needes bee so big as it may couer the head of the bile

hauing already made mention of the iacinth and of the amethyst to which there are great properties assigned will now touch some principall points in them
and first wee are to note

that the iacinth is commonly of a yealow colour but the best is red yet it is not so big as the other beeing put into the fire it becommeth more obscure and redder and beeing out of the fire it shineth greatly
also this kinde of hyacinth doth differ but little from the carbuncle in estimation of price
they that are of the colour of water are counted for base and of no force
but serapio hath written that the good iacinth keepeth men that beareth it out of the peril of thunder and defendeth them from the plague and prouoketh sleepe
albertus magnus likewise saith that the iacinth doth augment riches and authoritie and that it doth greatly comfort the hart and cause much ioy
now because these things might seeme to be paradoxes to many we will here make a little discourse following the precept of the philosopher who thinketh it sufficient in hard and intricate questions if wee can well auoide and shun absurd doctrine
for by this meanes many shal be induced to esteeme more then they do of precious stones and to beleeue the properties which are attributed vnto them if not as true

at least wise yet as possible
say then that the iacinth is of cold temperature for that is almost common to all precious stones and causeth them especiallie the diamond not to receiue fire very easily forsomuch as the coldnes doth greatly helpe the soliditie and subtiltie thereof which maketh that stones do resist fire
besides the iacinth is good for the breath of man either because of the likenes of substance or by cleerenes or through some other mysticall cause whereby repairing and confirming the breath and the spirit it maketh man ioyfull for sadnes is nothing else but the contraction of breath and shortnes and difficultie of the same
by such reason then as some haue said that they haue experimented that if any thing doe comfort the heart it doth likewise resist the plague which doth chiefly come through feare and imbecillitie of heart as experience sheweth vs in regard of children women and fearefull people who are sooner taken with this disease then stout and hardie men the iacinth abolishing these two things feare and faintnes of heart it may say helpe greatly to resist the plague
so also making the heart and the spirit ioyful and by that meanes more capable of good counsell it shall be the easier for man to encrease in authoritie and to augment in richesse
for being defended from thunder although that the iacinth be as we haue said of cold temper which causeth that it will not easily receiue endomagement by fire yet do

not we attribute to it therefore that it will preserve a man from being hurt
but we may rather say that the spirit of his heart being reioyced by the vertue of this stone may haue the grace to direct him into some place where he may be cleane out of the perill of thunder
concerning the amethyst

it is also a precious stone and orientall although it be but of a low price in regard of others in it is seene the colour and grace of wine bearing a purple lustre and it is thought to hinder drunkennes if it be tyed to the nauell and to stir vp dreames
now aser let vs heare you pursue our discourse of stones

of the chrysolite topaze opall turkesse and of the agath
chap

aser

vvhosoeuer will neerely consider vpon that which hath beene written by the ancients concerning the chrysolite and topaze

shal finde that that which wee call a chrysolite was their topaze and contrariwise our topaze was their chrysolite
this stone is of yellow colour not pure but greenish and is nothing inferiour to the saphir in hardnes if it be orientall
for you must note that the germaine chrysolite and many other pretious stones which are found vnder the north cold septentrionall zone are not so hard as the orientall because that there the heat is not so sufficient that it may much attenuate the humour which composeth the stone and harden it for the perfect concretion and gathering together is the cause of hardnes which is done when some verie small parts are mixed and conioyned together as commeth to passe in the generation of euerie stone
moreouer the chrysolite is seldome found without some blacke spots wherewith it is foyled and but for this it is a verie excellent precious stone
it is thought greatly to represse lust if it be carried next to ones skin
besides it is of great coldnes whereby this argument is apparant that being laide vpon the toong of one that hath a feuer it appeaseth his thirst
plinie recordeth

that from an isle called topazos there was brought a chrysolite to queene berenice mother of king ptolemey the second which was fower cubites long and that the king of egypt did afterwards cause a statue to be

made thereof in the honor of the queene arsinoe his sister and wife which was placed in the gilded temple that this prince caused to be erected

the topaze is of a greene colour and softer then the chrysolite for it is easily brought into dust with a file in lapse of time also it loseth his splendor of it selfe so that although it be verie faire

yet none desireth much to weare it
cardanus affirmeth himselfe to haue found that fifteene graines of this stone beeing drunke make a singular remedie for melancholy persons

now speake we of the opall which for varietie of colours is accounted amongst the most precious stones
for in it the fire of the rubie the purple of the amethyst and the greene sea of the emeraud shine altogether by a maruellous kinde of mixture
there are some which haue a lustre so mixed with all colours that there can no more be seene in a rich tablet nor more liuely
others seeme to sparkle with violet flames changing in manner of a fire made of brimstone or of a fire kindled with oyle
plinie saith that the greekes did call the opall paederos that is to say pastime for little children

because of the great grace and beautie which this stone hath in it
for saith he first one would say that there were a greene heauen in a pure chrystal mixed with a purple colour and a golden lustre enclining to the colour of wine which is alwaies the last colour that doth present it selfe
and yet one would say that this stone hath the head crowned with a purple chaplet and that it is confusedly tincted with all these foresaide colours and respectiuely with each of them
moreouer there is no stone more cleere then this and some say that it is verie good for the head and comfortable to the sight
nonius a senatour of rome did so loue an opall that he had that he chose rather to be banished out of rome then to giue it to marcus antonius carrying nothing with him of all his wealth but the ring onely wherein that stone was set
opals are found in many places of egypt of arabia and of the indies but the best are brought from zeila and isle of east india which produceth them as great as walnuts
but we must note that the indians can counterfeit them so finely with simple glasse that it is an hard matter to discerne the natural from false ones yet their deceit is found in the sunne
for holding betwixt the thumbe and a false opall against the sunne all the diuersitie of colours which seemed to be in this stone will turne into one but the naturall

opall changeth lustre euerie minute and spreadeth it heere and there so that the diuersitie of the colours thereof will shine vpon your fingers beeing holden as is saide and exposed to the sunne

shall we say nothing of the turkesse which is garnished with the colour of heauen and which hath admirable vertue

for it is of a skie colour and celestiall blewe and verie bright
it is esteemed because that in the night it likewise looketh greene that part which is vpon the earth is marked with veines it is soft and not of too cold a substa~ce
also lime slaked laid vpon this stone seemeth to be blew and receiueth the colour of a precious stone
it is commonly made bunching and swelling out like an eie and is found in this forme sowed and set along the rocks in many places of the indies but the fairest turkesses are in the kingdom of rasigut
and because of the difficultie to come to those places where they grow the inhabitants of the countrey beat them downe with staues in such sort that they fall with their earth and mosse and the people doe esteeme so much of them that they account them as their greatest riches and delight hanging them about their necks in manner of carcanets
it is no maruell then if these stones bee rare amongst vs for wee see no verie common trafficke made of them and yet they are much in request at this day
their vertue and propertie according to the report of some is verie maruellous
for they say that the turkesse being worne in a ring doth keepe a man from hurt that falleth yea though it be from his horse and that it receiueth all the blow and is oftentimes broken in pieces which is lesse credible then that which some also affirme that the vertue thereof doth resist poysons

now let vs speake of the agath

which is the biggest of all such as are called precious stones
but it is of so variable a kinde that one can scarcely thinke it to be one onely stone
for the agath is white red yellow greene black changeable blew in briefe the colours of all precious stones and of all other besides do concur in it
and nature exerciseth so many fashions vpon it that we may see it represent forrests fields floods flowers trees
histories haue celebrated verie much the agath of king pyrrhus which represented the nine muses with apollo in the middest of them playing vpon his harp beeing all in sundrie garments in such sort as it seemed that nature did contend

with the painter to carry away the price of such a representation
cardanus reporteth that hee had in his keeping two agaths

in one of which nature had painted the hemisphere of heauen the distinct circles with the round earth in the midst enuironed by the waters and in the other an open gulf of the earth seemed to breath out a fume that darkened the aire wherein this was most admirable that the colour of the smoke should seeme to differ from that of the aire which was thereby darkened this appearing white and thick and the aire reddish and somewhat cleere
but though the agath bee noble and excellent for the varietie thereof yet because it is but little bright and shining it is but seldome esteemed to bee of great valew amongst precious stones
some doe attribute this propertie thereto to bee good against stingings of scorpio~s especially that agath which is spotted with little graines of gold which the isles of candie and sicilie doe produce
the same vertue is attributed to the agaths of india and to refresh the sight much by but onely looking vpon them and they say that they staunch thirst beeing held neuer so short a while in ones mouth
but enough of this now amana doe you looke to that which resteth for vs to consider vpon concerning these most precious stones that deserue to enrich our discourse

of pearle corall and chrystall
chapter

amana

it is no maruel though pearles bee so much sought after in these daies by euery one for ornaments especially for women for of old they haue beene in such or more request so that while the romaine empire flourished this was a common prouerbe
that a woman could or might goe without pearles aswell as a consull might go without officers meaning thereby that pearles were an honor to women and made way to be giuen them in the street as the sergeants did for the consull before whome they marched

pearle is placed among precious stones and is of great price beeing esteemed for whitenes splendor and roundnes and when it is found big polished and heauy then may it bee said to bee faire in all perfection
but there are very few pearles that haue all these bewties

conditions
concerning the generation thereof the ancient opinion hath euer beene that the pearle was engendred in shelles of fishes wherewith the indian sea doth abound which engendring at one time of the yeere doe open and gape in the night time by that meanes filling themselues with dewe whereby they conceiue pearles which they make according to the qualitie of the dewe receiued if it bee cleere they are cleere if troubled so are they troubled and fowle if aboundant the pearles are great if scarce they are little
moreouer if it happen to thunder the shels shut togither for feare that they haue so that they haue no leasure to take in dewe enough whereby they remaine lanck and emptie as if they had fasted and thereof also pearles do proceed that are without substance and full of winde
but marke what our french cosmographer saith

if these shels or oisters haue no other substance within them but this pearle so conceiued of dew how doth the race of this maintaine it selfe moreouer in the west indian seas where aboundance of these pearles are found it cannot bee seene how their generation may bee iudged by the cleere or obscure disposition of the weather for if that were so there is no doubt but that all the pearles which were found in one shell should be all of one manner whereas the contrary is seene that within one shell are found some darke pearles others drawing to a tawnie some pale some greenish and some againe blewish and very few there are which haue the perfection required in a faire pearle
thereupon he concludeth that this pearled fish maintaineth the kinde thereof by the egs which it breedeth and that the pearles come out of the sand and grauell wherein they breede and are hidden because that by little and little this grauell refineth it selfe and groweth into these shels or oisters till such time as it hath attained to an entire and perfect forme remaining still soft for so long time as the oister is within the water but beeing out it presently hardneth and becommeth such pearle as wee see
but without much disputing hereupon euery man is of opinion that these pearles are bred in the shels of fishes
and the experience hereof is not onely seene in the indian sea but also in the british seas yea in all seas and fresh waters because that such oisters do swim aswell as fishes of which there haue beene some fished vp in the riuer garonne
but the industry of such as fish for them in the bottome of the sea is wonderfull for from thence they fetch their best mother of pearle

which lie within and vpon rocks hidden in the waters
they which are appointed to such fishing enter into boats and afterwards leauing some within to gouerne them and to help themselues also vp when they haue done their fishing they cast themselues into the water diuing downe to the bottome where they sometimes remaine for the space of halfe an hower and with nets catch these shels hauing taken some they returne againe to the top of the water and are receiued by those in the vessell where refreshing themselues with meat and drinke and hauing fitted on that which they put before their face which is as of little peeces of seare cloth very fine like a thinne bladder made that they may see cleerely through within the water they leap in fiue or six times a day
these oisters are also found fastned vpon rocks which appeare aboue water from whence they are fetched with paine and beeing catched the pearles are straightwaies taken out which otherwise would consume and lose their fresh colour and in one shell there are sometimes thirty or forty small and meane ones but few great ones to wit one or two
they were doubtlesse

woonderfull faire which were giuen to ferdinand magellano in a certaine isle of the moluccaes which were fower in number each one of the bignes of a pigeons egge esteemed to bee woorth fiue and twentie thousand crownes a peece
but this was a very smal matter in comparison to the two vnions of cleopatra queene of egypt esteemed woorth fifteene hundred thousand crownes one whereof she dissolued in very strong vineger and dranke it vp at a banket because it might bee said that shee had surpassed in sumptuousnes of cost the feast which anthonie had made hir
now for the vertues of pearles they are very good for passions and faintnes of hart and purge the bloud and beeing put into medicines they take away clowdes and dimnes from before the eies and drie vp the moisture that runnes from them

corall is likewise fished for in the sea and put into the number of stones although indeed it is a plant or shrubbe which being drawne out of the mediterranean sea and feeling the aire doth waxe hard by the power thereof
and there is found white red and blacke in one selfe same plant which groweth amongst stones and rocks in the bottome of the water but the best coral is the red if it be euenly congealed for the white is not so massiue nor heauie but is light rare and full of holes like a spunge

when it is fished for it is all couered with mosse and hath no signe or apparition of rednes
but being clensed it taketh colour and appeereth fairely polished now those graines of round corall which are put in bracelets and collers are not found so in the shrubbe but it consisteth of many little branches whereof these graines are made with a wheele and files and are afterwards polished with vermilion with a certaine earth which is brought fro tripoly in africa
the properties which are attributed to coral are marueilous for some say that being ha~ged about the necke or taken in drinke it is good for them that haue the falling euill for bloodie flixes and loosenes of the belly to fasten the teeth to heale sorenes in the mouth to prouoke sleepe in such as haue feuers to diminish the spleene for those that vomite and spit bloud
auicen placeth it amongst those medicines that comfort the hart and plinie saith that being burnt and puluerized and so drunke with water it is good for them that haue wringing in their belly and the stone in the bladder
the ashes thereof also are put into medicines for the eies it thickneth refrigerateth and doth incarnate hollow vlcers and maketh skars smooth
but amongst other properties this is most admirable and true that red corall which is pure and fulgent like the carbuncle being tyed about ones necke so that it touch the skinne when that person is sicke or shall be in short space after or hath drunke any venim which he yet feeleth not the corall doth wax pale and lose the splendor thereof which cardanus hath often testified to haue prooued by experience

will hereto adde some short discourse concerning chrystall

because that as it is engendred in the veines of the earth of the same humour that the diamond is which opened the entrance of this discourse concerning precious stones so now this speech of chrystall may shut it vp againe
plinie and many others haue supposed that it was made of yce or snow in a word that it was water congealed through great cold
but it appeereth that chrystall is engendred of some verie wel purified humour in that it is the cleerest of all stones
againe if the oldest yce in the world be put into an hot place it doth presently melt which chrystall doth not
moreouer it is most certaine that it is not found on the tops of mountaines where there is continuall snow and extreme coldnes but in quarries of marble and of other stones yea and in mines of diuers mettals
this also is another

reason that yce doth alwaies swimme aboue water but chrystall sinketh to the bottome
that chrystall is best which is white and cleere as water
it melteth with verie great fire and doth conuert into glasse whereof there are verie faire vessels made
in vertue it is restringent and is therefore good for such as are sicke of dysenterias to drinke in good sharp wine after it is wel and subtilly beaten to powder
the ancients made a bowle of chrystall wherewith phisitions cauterized those which feared the fire and common fearing iron to do which they laide the same bowle directly toward the beames of the sunne by the reuerberation whereof they did their surgerie worke vpon the grieued part
now in this little which we companions haue declared concerning mettals and precious stones we may imagine that if there be sufficient matter to admire the effects of nature ordayned by the diuine prouidence what might we thinke if we should enterprise to speake of fiue hundred kindes of mettals earths and precious stones which the earth hideth within her bowels but sith that we haue attayned to the ende of our discourse which is to glorifie god in the knowledge and contemplation of his most noble creatures let vs aduise our selues how to giue some good instructions vpon that which hath beene deliuered concerning minerals and stones hidden vnder ground as aram you can declare vnto vs

of the instructions that men must take in that gold and siluer are hidden vnder the ground and of their vse and abuse as also of precious stones
chapter

aram

as god declareth a great and maruellous prouidence in all his creatures as we haue discoursed intreating vpon them so also doth he manifest it vnto vs in the creation of mettals especially of gold siluer which are esteemed for the most precious
for we see how he hath hidden them in the most deepe places of the earth hath couered them with great and high mountaines so that to dig and draw them out of their profound caues men must therein so trauell as if they had enterprised to ouerturne and to transport these loftie hils from one place to another and to search and

pierce through the earth from one side to another
for how is it searched by such as worke in mines it is a maruell that they are not alreadie come vnto the antipodes considering the deep pits gulfes and holes whereinto they are descended

iob hauing spoken of gold and siluer doth presently make mention of the bounds of darknes and shadow of death
and in verie truth they are things which doe fitly agree with these two minerals for they are hidden in verie obscure and darke places and couered with a verie thicke shadow yet cannot this limit the couetousnes and auarice of men notwithstanding that god hath sufficiently admonished them to moderate themselues seeing that he hath so hidden the gold and siluer which prouoketh their auarice making them so furious and insatiable
and therefore might verie well compare them to bruite beasts yea to a flocke of sheepe
for although that they daily behold by many experiences

the calamities which fall vpon the world through auarice and especially vpon those which are entangled with this vice yet cannot one take example by another but doe all followe one by one like poore brute beasts and sheepe following one another when they are leade to that slaughter house or when there is some one amongst them that hath lead the way to the rest and hath made the first leape
for what daunger soeuer there bee yea though it were to tumble headlong downewards into some bottomelesse pit it is sufficient if one begin the daunce for hee shall presently haue good companie yea such as there is not one of the whole troupe but will lustily rush after without thinking vpon any danger
who doth not see that it is euen so in mans life for according as some haue wickedly begun others pursue them and the latter cannot discouer their owne follie by that of the former nor yet correct it by so many examples as they haue of euill ends and pernicious euents which haue willingly fallen vpon the couetous
for this cause the prophet hauing described the follie and presumption of men which thinke to build an eternity vnto themselues with temporall riches he addeth their way vttereth their foolishnes

yet their posteritie delight in their talke like sheepe they lie in the graue death deuoureth them
see there the shepheard and the flock of the couetous death and the sepulchre

now our meaning is not here to blame the vse of gold and siluer but onely the abuse

for wee behold the great commodities

that men haue by communicating one with another and mutuallie aiding one another in all that which is rare and exquisite amongst them and that by meanes of those mettals and mony that is coined thereof
for so may they furnish themselues of all things necessary for their vse for their life and according to their wish not onely from one country to another but as wee may well say from one end of the world to another
and if by their auarice they abuse not this great commoditie it wil bee much more profitable to all
but their vnsatiable couetousnes of gaine is cause that the amiable communication and the good desire of one neighbor to profite another which should bee by meanes of gold and siluer is conuerted oftentimes into plaine robberie
for their harts are so set on fire with loue of riches that they propose no other determination vnto themselues saue to heape vp treasures by a deceitfull meanes which neuerthelesse they doe neuer enioy in peace and content beeing no more able to settle their couetousnes and asswage their appetite then to quench a great fire with laying dry wood vpon it but that it wil alwaies encrease and enflame the more
and to speake truth what is this gold and siluer but a little yealow and white earth and if there bee any difference it is onely in that the substance is more hardned and what doe they differ therein from the basest hard stones it is onely in colour
why then doe men trauaile and take great care to heap vp gold and siluer rather then to heap vp dust earth and stones but indeede this is much worse for they heap vp an vnhappy treasure when for earth and clay they gaine vnto themselues the treasure of the curse of god

for it is written cursed be hee that heapeth vp that which is not his how long will he lade himselfe with thick clay
but what this clay so yealow and white firme and exquisite doth dazzle their eies more then any thing else and yet for all that it is but earth
and therefore it is but opinion that causeth one thing to be esteemed more then an other
for if men had giuen that value to other mettals which they haue appointed to gold and siluer there would be almost no difference of the one from the other
say moreouer that if they had but equall regard to the vtilitie and nature of things according to the profit which they receiue thereby and the need which they haue therof they should more esteeme of iron brasse and copper then of gold and siluer considering that by iron the earth which nourisheth vs is plowed and arts and occupations

mantained and that by it we defend our selues from the furie of beasts and enemies and of tinne and copper we make the most principall vtensils and tooles in our houses to boyle our victuals in and for other infinite vses
in all these things then wee acknowledge the folly and want of iudgement in men who gouerne themselues more by opinion then by reason

we may say as much concerning precious stones

which they haue esteemed at a more high price then gold and siluer
for how many crownes doe they oftentimes giue for one pearle or for a diamond or for some other stone if the fancie take them and that they doe but onely like some small precious stone then doe they spare gold and siluer no more then if they were dust and clay then that which they so much delight in and for to obtaine which they direct and gouerne their whole course of life yea and put it into all confusion is nothing with them in respect of a small iewell
and what profit can redound vnto them by all this nothing else but a vaine persuasion that induceth them to obtaine a stone of such and such woorth as it pleaseth them to esteeme it at
if they would thinke as much of a flint a flint would no lesse content them
if it be for the beautie and colour that they so account of this merchandize is there any thing fairer cleerer or cleaner then glasse nay then chrystall likewise the marble alablaster iasper and such like matters do they giue much place in beautie or hardnes to the most excellent precious stones if for their vertues and properties in phisicke they are so much respected why then they should buy nothing more deere not esteem of any thing more then of herbs and plants speake not this to despise or condemne the vse of precious stones no more then of gold and siluer
for god did not create them but for the seruice of man and that he might please himselfe with them as with all his other creatures

for it was his will that his temple and the vessels therein the garments of the high priest and the seruice by him ordayned in the church of israël should be adorned and enriched with gold siluer and with precious stones
againe dauid and salomon and the other kings of israel were neuer reprehended nor condemned because they did abound in such riches
we doe not then condemne the vse but the abuse
for god requireth that his creatures may be vsed according to his ordinance and so moderated that there be no excesse whereby he may be dishonored offended or our neighbour

endomaged
but it is an hard matter to heape vp great store of gold and siluer and to dispend so much vpon precious stones and other the pomps of the world but that great wrong must needs bee done to many persons or at least wise that the deeds of charitie for which we were borne must needs waxe verie slacke
loethen that which haue thought worthy to instruct our selues in vpon our discourse this day concerning the richesse hidde within the earth
and sith that we haue in the twelue daies of our meeting entreated of the principall parts of all this visible world and of the creatures contained therein let vs now to conclude our discourse draw all these parts into one bodie to the ende that we may shew in this masse of the vniuers and propose as it were before our eies the image of the greatnes puissance and maiestie of god by the which men may in contemplation consideration of his works learne to feare honor and put their whole trust and confidence in him as they ought which achitob let vs heare you discourse vpon

of the doctrine and profit which euerie one must and may reape out of the totall workes of god in heauen and in earth to acknowledge and glorifie him
chap

achitob

if we doe well consider vpon those goodly matters which wee haue heretofore entreated of touching the creation of the world and adorning thereof in euery part wee shall without doubtfeele our selues as it were lifted vp vpon an high scaffold where wee may behold and contemplate god our creator in the excellent workes of his hands and in the maruailous effects of his prouidence in such sort as if all this visible vniuers were a shop wherein wee doe see him worke before our eies or else as if hee were seated in a stately roiall palace wherein we behold him reigne vpon his celestiall throne ouer euery liuing soule or as in a goodly temple wherein the glory of his maiestie shineth on euery side yea in euery creature which is therein as an image or mirrour to shew and manifest the creator and moderator of all things
and indeede without this contemplation and knowledge

for which we are borne and endued with reason let vs not thinke but that brute beasts haue more whereof to brag in regard of the world and of the beawtie and commoditie thereof and that they receiue more rest pleasure and profite thereby then men
for they content themselues with that which they haue and care not for that which they cannot attaine vnto enioying all that which is needfull for them and that with pleasure and without excesse superfluitie or any hurt
but men are to the contrary neuer content with their condition aspire euermore to that which they enioy not and which they might well let passe haue many times neede of that which is necessarie for them and receiue no pleasure but that which is mixed with some greefe and bitternes neither yet can they content themselues but that they must run into excesse to their great detriment

this is that which hath enflamed vs with desire in the progresse of our worke to discourse vpon heauen and earth
and hauing brought our intention to a desired end wee will here represent for the last point of our speech as wee did in the beginning thereof all the parts of the world in one bodie to declare in this great bodie of all the vniuers and to propose as it were before our eies the image of the greatnes of the power and of the maiestie of god and of his infinitenes to the end that wee may all learne by the contemplation and consideration of this image to honour him and to put all our trust and confidence in him as wee ought to doe
for this is the true doctrine and the great profite that euery one must and may reape by the grace of god of this totall worke in heauen and in earth to the end to acknowledge and to glorifie him
first then wee are to consider that not onely all that which wee haue declared concerning the workes of god in this great vniuers but also all that which the most learned euer could heretofore or hereafter euer may comprehend describe is nothing else but as a very light demonstration of some draught of his worke or of some corner of his magnificent pallace or of some small iewell of his inestimable treasures
for sith hee hath created all these things and that the heauen is his seat and the earth his footstoole as isay speaketh what may then bee the full perfection height and greatnes of himselfe

it is as iob saith in the highnes of the heauen it is deeper then hell

the measure thereof is longer then the earth and broader then the sea
it is hee saith isay againe who hath measured the waters

with his hand and hath compassed the heauens with his palme and hath comprehended the dust of the earth with three fingers and hath poised the hanging of the mountaines
thereby then wee must learne that god is infinite and incomprehensible and so high and so great that all this visible world is nothing in comparison to him and that he doth containe and confine and surpasse it in euery side both aboue and below before and behinde on the right hand and on the left
and that because wee cannot comprehend nor vnderstand what hee is the image of him was set before our eies in the heauens and in the earth and as in a glasse to represent vnto our vnderstandings him whom wee neither behold nor know except so far as it pleaseth him to represent himselfe vnto vs in his workes

lastly wee must learne that from the very first hower of our entrance into this world wee haue beene placed therein as in the temple of god to adore and praise him therein
and in verie truth whosoeuer shall consider of and know god as hee hath manifested himselfe in the creation of the world shall not hee haue good and iust occasion to feare and stand in awe of him for as wee read in the booke of iob if god cut off and shut vp or gather togither

who can turne him and straight after in his hand is the soule of euery liuing thing and the breath of all mankinde
on the other side shall not we be induced to haue recourse vnto him and to put our trust in him as in the who can saue and defend those whom he will take into his custodie and whom he will accept for his people and for his seruants and children who so dwelleth in the secret of the most high saith the prophet shall abide in the shadow of the
will say vnto the lord

oh mine hope and my fortresse in my god will trust who will deliuer vs out of all trouble
and to conclude we shall haue goodly matter whereby to giue him glorie and laude all the daies of our life by seruing him according to his holy will
we shall be say verie blinde and senselesse if we do not humble our selues vnder the greatnes of the puissance of god if we haue recourse vnto or put our confidence in any other but in him alone and if we do not acknowledge his great prouidence wisedome and bountie which he hath vsed euer since the beginning towards vs and the regard and care which he hath daily had of vs and how that he entreateth vs so benignly so tenderly and with such fatherly affection to the ende that

we may render thanks vnto him
for as we haue seene before that he created man he would prepare his lodging for him the which he did adorne with all beautie and with all riches and did afterwards place him in this world as in a most delectable palace made him lord master ouer all his creatures of whom he hath prouided him such abundance in such variety that it is impossible to comprehend these or to desire more
as it were then rauished in the consideration of so great bountie and liberalitie of god let vs crie out with the prophet oh lord our god

how excellent is thy name in all the world what is man that thou art mindfull of him and the sunne of man that thou shewest him so much grace as to visite him and to take care of him and so giuing glorie vnto his name for so many benefits and particularly for that it hath pleased him to grant vs this grace as to reduce to a desired ende our academicall discourses concerning his workes in the vniuers let vs pronounce this goodly canticle of the angels
holy holy holy lord god of hostes all the earth is full of thy glorie

the two unfortunate lovers
or a true relation of the lamentable end of john true and susan mease

and how they dy'd unfortunate
their lives this ditty doth relate

the tune is the brides burial

a ttend you lovers and give ear unto my mournful song of two that loved faithfully yet did each other wrong

at coventry in warwickshire this young man he did dwell his name john true a shooemaker and liv'd of it full well

at corly did this maiden dwell three miles from coventry yet for the love he bore to her he would her often see

and coming to her on a day he told to her his mind susan quoth he love thée dear be not to me unkind

if thou canst love and fancy me in heart and eke in mind will prove loving unto thee be not to me unkind

thy chearful looks rejoyce my heart and merry make my mind sweet susan then love me again be not to me unkind

good john thank you for your love and wish you at home to tarry am too young for you to wed and have no mind to marry

where you do dwell are maidens store of beauty fair and frée set not thy love upon me then for cannot love thee

this answer struck him to the heart as cold as any stone and homewards strait he did return with many a sigh and groan

wishing that he had ne'r béen born or in his cradle dy'd vnhappy man to love so true and yet to be deny'd

quoth he will to her again and hear what she doth say it may be she may be more kind though first she said me nay

then coming to the town again he sent for her strait way desiring her to speak with him but still she said him nay

then did he sigh lament and grieve and knew not what to say then did he take his pen in hand and writ these words strait way

my hearts delight and only joy kill me not with disdain vouchsafe that may speak with thée to rid me out of pain

resolve me swéetest thée pray why is thy hatred such know no cause unless it be for loving thée too much

as is my name so is my love sweet susan unto thée true is my name true is my love and ther so shall be

my love is loyal iust and good kill me not with disdain rather do me the courtesie to love for love again

when she had read and understood his mind and his intent she then began to like and love and yields him hearts content

john am thine if thou béest mine for ever and for aye it was to try thy constancy that did say thee nay

but here's my hand my heart love i'le ne'r thée more deny my love is constant firm and true and shall be till dye

then they imbrac'd each others love and joyn'd in heart and voice that she of him and he of her had made so swéet a choice

bvt fortune that doth often frown where she before did smile the mans delight the maidens joy full soon she did beguile

when she was setled in her love then he would change his mind and for to try her constancy would be to her unkind

and thus resolved in his mind he'd come to her no more but went and wooed another maid which griev'd her heart full sore

quoth he she proved unto me and unkind but now her true love have won i'le bear the self same mind

when she perceiv'd his love to her not as twas wont to be she did lament sigh wéep and grieve and then these words said she

wretch adieu quoth she disloyal and unkind and if dye for love of thée thou shalt not know my mind

woe to the time did beleive that flattering tongue of thine would god that had never séen the tears of thy false eyn

hard hap had to set my love on one that mocked me sure all the country did not yeild a man so false as he

thus was she brought to mean estate all comfort from her fled she did desire to speak with him
before that she was dead

her friends did séek to chear her up and to make glad her mind but she was kil'd with loving him who prov'd to her unkind

man may never maid love thée as have done but may my death remembred be to time that is to come

but may all maids example take by this my mournful death and now lord receive my soul to thée yield my breath

thus dy'd the pattern of true love thus dy'd a vertuous maid thus dy'd as good a harmless lass as ever love betray'd

six maids in white as custom is did bear her to the grave her parents grieve lament and more
no child at all they have

when as her lover understood for truth that she was dead he rag'd and ready was to tear the hair from off his head

but when he came into the place where his true lover lay he strait way ran unto the grave and there these words did say

susan quoth he i'le kiss thy grave upon my bended knée whereby i'le shew to all the world how dear loved thee

and as he lay upon the ground he heard a voice to say john true if e're thou loved'st me dear make hast and come away

then started he up from the grave and stood like one struck dumb and when he had regain'd his speech he said come come

and thus like one out of his wits he rag'd in pitious sort that all the neighbours presently were griev'd at his report

and thus with sorrow and grief of heart he lay a whole fortnight and when he had confest his fault he yielded up his spirit

according to his hearts desire and as he did request they dig'd his grave laid him down by her whom he lov'd best

you young men all that have true loves be sure unto your friend and if you love be sure your love be true unto the end

and thus end my story true so full of grief and woe may never any seek again to wrong each other so

treatise of Schemes Tropes very profytable for the better vnderstanding of good authors, gathered out of the best Grammarians Oratours by Rychard Sherry Lon+doner.
¶Whervnto is added a declamacion, That chyldren euen strayt fro~ their infancie should be well and gently broughte vp in learnynge.
Written fyrst in Latin by the most excellent and famous Clearke, Erasmus of Roterodame.
To the ryght worshyp+ful Master Thomas Brooke Esquire, Rychard Shyrrey wysheth health euerlastynge.·.
Doubt not but that the title of this treatise all straunge vnto our Englyshe eares, wil cause some men at the fyrst syghte to maruayle what the matter of it should meane: yea, and peraduenture if they be rashe of iudgement, to cal it some newe fangle, and so casting it hastily from the~, wil not once vouch safe to reade it: and if they do, yet perceiuynge nothing to be therin that pleaseth their phan+sy, wyl count it but a tryfle, a tale of Robynhoode.
But of thys sorte as doubte not to fynde manye, so perhaps there wyll be other, whiche moued with the noueltye thereof, wyll thynke it worthye to be looked vpon, and se what is contained therin.
These words, Scheme and Trope are not vsed in our Englishe tongue, neither bene they Englyshe wordes.
No more be manye whiche nowe in oure tyme be made by continual vse, very familier to most men, and come so often in speakyng, that aswel is knowen amongest vs the meanyng of them, as if they had bene of oure owne natiue broode.
Who hath not in hys mouthe nowe thys worde Paraphrasis, homelies, vsurped, abolyshed, wyth manye other lyke? And what maruail is it if these words haue not bene vsed here tofore, seynge there was no suche thynge in oure Englishe to~gue where vnto they shuld be applyed? Good cause haue we therefore to gyue thankes vnto certayne godlye and well learned men, whych by their greate studye enrychynge our tongue both wyth matter and wordes, haue endeuoured to make it so copyous and plentyfull that therein it maye compare wyth anye other whiche so euer is the best.
It is not vnknowen that oure language for the barbarousnes and lacke of eloquence hathe bene complayned of, and yet not trewely, for anye defaut in the toungue it selfe, but rather for slackenes of our cou~+trimen, whiche haue alwayes set lyght by searchyng out the elegance and proper speaches that be ful many in it: as plain+ly doth appere not only by the most excellent monumentes of our au~cie~t forewriters, Gower, Chawcer and Lydgate, but also by the famous workes of many other later: inespeciall of ye ryght worshipful knyght syr Thomas Eliot, which first in hys dictionarye as it were generallye searchinge oute the copye of oure language in all kynde of wordes and phrases, after that setting abrode good lye monumentes of hys wytte, lernynge and industrye, aswell in historycall knowledge, as of eyther the Philosophies, hathe herebi declared the plentyfulnes of our mother tou~ge, loue toward hys country, hys tyme not spent in vanitye and tryfles.
What shuld speake of that ornamente Syr Thomas Wyat? which beside most excellente gyftes bothe of fortune and bodye, so flouryshed in the eloquence of hys natiue tongue, that as he passed therin those wyth whome he lyued, so was he lykelye to haue bene equal wyth anye other before hym, had not enuious death to hastely beriued vs of thys iew+el: teachyng al men verely, no filicitie in thys worlde to be so suer and stable, but that quick lye it may be ouerthrowen and broughte to the grounde.
Manye other there be yet lyuynge whose excellente wrytynges do testifye wyth vs to be wordes apte and mete elogantly to declare oure myndes in al kindes of Sciences: and that, what sentence soeuer we conceiue, the same to haue Englyshe oracion natural, and· holpe~ by art, wher by it may most eloque~tly be vttered.
Of the whych thynge as fortuned to talke wyth you, Master Brooke, among other matters this present argument of Schemes and Tropes came in place, and offered it selfe, demed to be bothe profitable and pleasaunte if they were gathered together, and handsomelye set in a playne ordre, and wyth theire descriptions hansomely put into our Englishe tongue.
And bicause longe ago, was well acquaynted wyth them, when red them to other in ye Latin, and that they holpe me verye muche in the exposicion of good authoures, was so muche the more ready to make them speak English: partli, to renew the pleasure of mine old studies, and partelye to satysfy your request.
Beside this, was moued also wyth the authorytye of that famous clarke Rodulphus Agricola, whyche in a certeine Epistle wrytten vnto a frynde of hys, exhorteth me~ what soeuer they reade in straunge diligently to translate the same into their owne language: because that in it we sonar perceiue if there be any faute in our speaking, and howe euerye thynge eyther rightly hangeth together or is darkelye, ruggishly, and superfluously wrytte~.
No lerned nacion hath there bene but learned in it haue written of schemes fygures, which thei wold not haue don, except thei had perceyued the valewe.
Wherfore after theyr example obtaynyng a lytle lesure, red ouer sundrye treatises, as wel of those which wrot long ago, as of others now in our daies: fyndynge amonge them some to haue wrytten ouer brieflye, some confuselye, and falselye some.
Mosellane hathe in hys tables shewed a fewe fygures of grammer, and so hathe confou~ded them together, that his second order called of Loquucion pertayneth rather to the rhetoricians then to hys purpose.
Quintilian briefly hathe wrytten bothe of the Gramatical and rhetorical Shemes, but so that you may soone perceyue he did it by the waye, as muche as serued hys purpose.
Cicero in hys boke of an oratour wyth hys incomperable eloquence hathe so hid the preceptes, that scarselye they may be tryed oute by theyr names, or by theyr exa~ples.
Erasmus in hys double copye of words and thynges, hath made as ye tytle declareth but a comentarye of them bothe, and as it wer a litle bil of remembrau~ce.
Wherfore to make these thinges more playne to ye students that lyst to reade them in oure tongue, haue taken a lytle payne, more thorowelye to try the definicions, to apply the ex+amples more aptly, to make things defused more plaine, as in dede it shal ryght wel apere to the dylygente.
haue not translated them orderly out of anye one author, but runninge as sayde thorowe many, and vsyng myne owne iudgement, haue broughte them into this body as you se, and set them in so playne an order, that redelye maye be founde the figure, and the vse wherevnto it serueth.
Thoughe vnto greate wittes occupyed wyth weightye matters, they do not greatelye pertayne, yet to such as perchau~ce shal not haue perfecte instructoures, they may be commodious to helpe them selues for ye better vnderstandynge of such good authors as they reade.
For thys darre saye, no eloquente wryter maye be perceiued as he shulde be, wythoute the knowledge of them: for asmuche as al togethers they belonge to Eloquucion, whyche is the thyrde and pryncipall parte of rhetorique.
The common scholemasters be wont in readynge, to saye vnto their scholers: Hic est figura and sometyme to axe them, Per quam figuram But what profit is herein if they go no further? In speakynge and wrytynge nothyng is more folyshe than to affecte or fondly to laboure to speake darkelye for the nonce, sithe the proper vse of speach is to vtter the meaning of our mynd with as playne wordes as maye be.
But syth it so chaunseth yt som+tyme ether of necessitie, or to set out the matter more plai~ly we be compelled to speake otherwyse then after common facion, onles we wil be ignorante in the sence or meaninge of the mater that excellente authors do wryghte of, we muste nedes runne to the helpe of schemes fygures: which verely come no sildomer in the writing and speaking of eloquente english men, then either of Grecians or Latins.
Many thinges might brynge in to proue not onely a great profyt to be in them but that they are to be learned euen of necessitie, for as muche as not only prophane authors wythout them may not be wel vnderstand, but that also they greatelye profit vs in the readinge of holye scripture, where if you be ignoraunte in the fyguratiue speches and Tropes, you are lyke in manye greate doubtes to make but a slender solucion: as ryght wyll do testefy Castelio Vestimerus and yt, no+ble doctor saint Augustine.
confesse haue not made the matter here so perfecte as my wyll and desyer is it shoulde haue ben, and that haue but brieflye touched, and as it were with my litle fynger poynted to these thinges, which require a le~ger declaracion.
For what can be hasted, and absolute to? But if God spare me lyfe, truste hereafter to make it an introduccio~, wherbi our youth not onlye shall saue that moste precious Iewell, Time, whyle they wander by them selues, re+adynge at all aduentures sun+dry and varyous authors: but that also thei shalbe able better to vnderstande and iudge of the goodlye gyftes and ornamentes in mooste famous and eloquente oratoures.
For as lyke plesure is not to him whiche gooeth into a goodlye garden garnyshed wyth dyuers kindes of herbes and flowers, and that there doeth no more but beholde them, of whome it maye be sayde that he wente in for nothynge but that he wold come out, and to hym which be syde the corporall eie pleasure, knoeth of eueri one the name propertye: so verelye much difference is there in readynge good authors, and in sundrye sortes of menne that do it: and muche more pleasure, and profit hathe he whiche vseth arte and iudgement, then the other, whiche wyth greate studye in+dede turneth them ouer but for lacke of the knowledge of preceptes wanteth also the fruite and delectacyon that he more amplye myghte obtayne.
The lyuynge God from whome all good giftes do procede, gyue vs grace so to order all oure words and speache, that it may be to his honour and glory for euer and euer.
¶A briefe note of eloqucio~, the third parte of Rhetoricke, wherunto all Figures and Tropes be referred.
ELoquucion which the Greekes call Phrase, whereof also the name of eloquence dothe ryse, as of al partes it is the good lyest, so also is it the most profitable and hardeste: in the whyche is seene that diuine myghte and vertue of an oratoure, whych as Cicero in hys oratorie particions defineth, is nothyng else but wisedom speakyng
For vnto the maruelous greate inuencion of all thynges, bothe it addeth a fulnes, and varietie: it setteth oute garnysheth wyth lyghtes of eloquent speche, the thinges that be spoken of, and also wyth very graue sentences, choyse wordes, proper, aptly translated, and wel soundyng, it bryngeth that greate fludde of eloquence, vnto a certein kynd of stile and indyghtyng.
And oute of thys greate streame of eloquucion, not only must we chose apte, and mete wordes, but also take hede of placinge, and settinge them in order.
For the myghte and power of eloquucion consisteth in wordes consideced by them selues, and when they be ioyned together.
Apt wordes by searchyng muste be founde oute, and after by diligence conueniently coupled.
For there is a gar+nyshynge, euen when they be pure and fyne by them selues, and an other, whe~ they be ioyned together.
To chose the~ oute finely, and handsomlye to bestow them in their pla+ces, after the mynde of Cicero and Quintilian, is no easy thynge.
So Marcus Antonius was wonte to say, that he had knowen many wel spoken men, but none eloquente.
Tullye and Quintilian thoughte that inuencion and disposicio~ were the partes of a wytty and prudent man, but eloquence of an oratour.
For howe to finde out matter, and set it in order, may be comen to all men, whyche eyther make abridge+mentes of the excellent workes of aunciente wryters, and put in or that speake of anye themselues: but to vtter the mynde aptely, distinctly, and ornately, is a gyft geuen to fewe.
And because we haue deui+ded eloquucion into two partes, that is, wordes symple, or considered by them selues, and compound or ioyned together in speache, accordyng to thys we saye, that euerye eloquente oracion must haue in it thre poyntes: euidence, which be longeth to the parte of eloquu+cion, composicion dignitie, which belongeth to the other.
Of these thynges that we put in eloquucion, lette thys be the fyrste care, to speake euidentlye after the dignitye and of thynges, and to vtter suche wordes, whych as Cicero sayth in hys oratour, no man may iustely reprehende.
The playne and euident speche is learned of Gramarians, and it keepeth the oracion and without all faute, and maketh that euerye thyng may seme to be spoken pure+lye apettlye, and clerelye.
Euerye speche standeth by vsuall wordes that be in vse of daylye talke, and proper wordes that belonge to the thinge, of the which we shal speke.
Neyther be properties to be referred onely to the name of the thing, but much more to the strength and power of the significacion: must be considered not by hearyng, but by vnderstandyng.
So translacion in the whych comonly is the greatest vse of eloquucio~, applieth wordes not the selfe proper thinges.
But yet an vnvsed worde or poetical, hath also somtyme in the oracion hys dignitie, and beyng put in place (as Cicero sayeth) oftentymes the oracion may seme greater, and of more antiquitie, for that Poetes do speake in a maner as it were in a nother tonge, it is righte sone perceiued.
Finally two fautes are co~mitted in euerye language, whereby it is not pure: Barbarisme, and Solecisme.
Of the whych, that on is committed, when anye worde is fautely spoken or writen: that other, when in many wordes ioyned together, the worde that fo+loweth is not wel applyed to that that goeth before.
Of composicion and dygnitye, we wyll speake here after, when we come to the figures of rethoryque.
Before we come to the precepts of garnishing an oracio~, we thinke good, bryeye to shewe you of the thre kyndes of stile or endyghting, in the whych all the eloquucion of an oratoure is occupied.
For that there be thre sundry kyndes, called of the Grekes characters, of vs figures, trowe there is no man, though he be meanlye learned, but he knoweth, namely when we se so manye wryters of sciences, bothe Greke and latine, whych haue ben before tyme, to haue folowed for the mooste parte sundrye sortes of wrytyng, the one vnlyke to the other.
And there hath bene marked inespecially thre kyndes of endigh+tynge: The greate, the small, the meane.
The greate, the noble, the mightye, and the full kynde of endyghtynge, wyth an incredible, a certen diuine power of oracion, is vsed in wayghty causes: for it hathe wyth an ample maiestye verye gar+nyshed wordes, proper, translated, graue sentences, whych ar handled in amplificacion, and commiseracion, and it hathe exornacions bothe of woordes and sentences, in oracions they ascribe verye great strength and grauitie.
And they that vse thys kynde, bee vehement, various, copious, graue, appoynted and readye thorowlye to moue and turne mens myndes.
Thys kynd dyd Cicero vse in the oracion for Aulus Cluencius, for Sylla, for Titus Annius Milo, for Caius Rabirius: agaynste Cariline, agaynste Uerres, agaynste Piso.
But they that can not skyll of it oftentimes fall into fautes, when vnto them that seemeth a graue oracion, whych swelleth, and is puffed vp, whych vseth straunge wordes hardelye translated, or to olde, and that nowe longe sythens lefte of from vse of daylye talke, or more graue then the thing requyreth.
The small kynde of indighting, is in a subtile, pressed, and fyled ora+cion, meete for causes that be a lytel sharper then are in the comon vse of speakynge.
For it is a kynde of oracion that is lette downe euen to the mooste vsed custume of pure and clere speakyng.
It hathe fyne sentences, subtile, sharpe, teachyng all thynges, and makynge them more playne, not more ample.
And in the same kynde (as Cicero sayeth in hys oratoure) some bee craftye, but vnpolyshed, and of pur+pose lyke the rude and vnskylfull: Other in that are trymme, that is somwhat floryshynge also and garnyshed.
Cicero vsed thys kynde in hys philosophicall disputacions, in the oracio~ for Quincius for Roscius ye Comedy plaier, Te+ce~ce, Plautus in their Comedies.
Such as ca~ not ha~dsomly vse them selues in that mery conceyted of wordes, fall into a drye and feble kynde of oracion.
The mean and temperate kynd of indyghting standeth of the lower, and yet not of the loweste, and moste comen wordes and
And it is ryghtly called the tempe+rate kynde of speakyng, because it is very nygh vnto the small, and to the greate kynde, folowyng a moderacion and temper betwyxt the~.
And it foloweth as we saye in one tenour, distinguyshyng all the oracion wyth small ornamentes of wordes, and sentences.
Cicero vseth thys for the lawe of Manilius, for Aulus Cecinna, for Marcus Marcellus, and moste of all in hys bookes of oices.
In this it is fautye to come to the kynd that is nye vnto it· whyche is called dissolute, because it waueth hyther and thyther, as it were wythout senowes and ioyntes, standyng surely in no poynte.
And an oracion can not the to take anye heede, it goeth so in and out, and comprehendeth not any thyng wyth perfecte wordes Of Schemes and Tropes.
Scheme is a Greke worde, and signifyeth properlye the maner of gesture that daunsers vse to make, whe~ they haue won the best game, but by translacion is taken for the fourme, fashion, and shape of anye thynge expressed in wrytynge or payntinge: and is taken here now of vs for the fashion of a word, sayynge, or sentence, otherwyse wrytten or spoken then after the vulgar and comen vsage, and that thre su~dry waies: by figure, fae, vertue.
Fygure, of Scheme ye fyrst part, is a behaueoure, maner, or fashion eyther of sentence, oracion, or wordes after some new wyse, other the~ men do commenlye vse to or speake: and is of two sortes.
Figure of Dianoias, or sentence, because it properlye belongeth to oratoures· we wyll speake of it hereafter in place conuenient, now wyll we entrete of the figure Lexeos, or of worde, as it perteyneth to the Gramarians.
Figure Lexeos, or of worde, is when in speakyng or wrytyng any thynge touchynge the wordes is made newe or straunge, otherwyse then after ye comen custume: is of ii. kyndes, diccion, construccion.
Figure of diccion is the transformacion of one word, either written or pronou~ced: hath these partes.
Appositio apposicio~, the putting to, eyther of letter or sillable at the begynnyng of a worde, as: He all to bewretched hym.
Ablatio the takynge awaye of a letter or sillable from the begynnynge of a worde, of a letter, when we say: The pe~thesis of thys house is to low, for the epenthesis.
Wher note this ye word pe~thesis is a greke worde, yet is vsed as an englishe, as many mo be, and is called a pen+tis by these figures, Sincope and Apheresis, the whole word beynge as is before, epenthesis, so called be+cause it is betwyxt ye lyght vs, as in al occupiers shops co~menli it is.
Interpositio when a letter is added betwene the fyrste sillable of a word and the laste, as: Relligio~ for religion, relliques for reliques.
Consicio contrary to Epenthesis, is when somewhat is cutte of from the myddeste of the worde, as: Idolatry for Preassumpcio when a sillable is ad+ded to a word, the significacion of the worde therby nothyng altered, as: He vseth to slacken his matters, for to slacke his matters.
Absissio ye cuttyng away of a let+ter or sillable fro~ the end of a word, as: She is a wel may, for maid Extensio the making lo~g of a sil+lable whych by nature is short, as: This was ordeined by acte, for ordined.
Contractio the makynge short of a sillable which bi nature is lo~g, as He is a man of good perseuerau~ce: wher some men co~mit .ii. fautes at once, one yt they take perseuerau~ce for knoweledge, whiche signifieth alwais co~tinuance, an other yt they make this sillable (ue) short, where it is euerlonge: and so do they erre in thys worde, adherentes, also, ma+kyng (he) short, when it is alwayes longe, as when they saye: defye hym, and all his adherentes.
Delecio oute, when .ii. vowels comyng together, the first is as it were put out: as thone and thother, for the one and the other.
Figure of construccion is when the order of construccion is otherwyse then after the comen maner.
Presumpcio a takynge before, or generall speakynge of those thynges whych afterwardes be declared more perticulerlye: as, in the meane seaso~ that kyng Henry rode royally to Calais on a sumpteous courser, Lewes in a gorgeous chariot was to Boloygne.
Iunctio ioynyng, as Linacer sayeth, is when in lyke sentences a cer+ten comen thyng that is put in the one, and not chaunged in the other is not expressed, but lefte out: as in Uyrgyll.
Before forget Cesar, ey+ther the Parthian shall drynke of the flud Araris, or Germany of Ti+gris: here is left out, shall drynke.
Iniunctio is when the verbe in diuerse lyke sentences is referred to one: and that thre maner of waies.
Fyrste when it is set before, and is called Preiunctio as There dyd ouercome in hym, lechery, his chastitie, saucines his feare, madnesse hys reason.
Secondlye when it is set in the miodes, is called, Media iunctio as bewtye, eyther by age decaieth, or by syckenes.
Thyrdly whe~ it is put in the end and is called Postiunctio as bewtie by syckenes, by sorowe, or by age decayeth.
Disiunctio disiunccion, when of those thynges of whych we speake, eyther both, or eche one of them is concluded with their certen verbe, thus: The people of Rome destroyed Numance, ouerthrew Cartage, cast downe Corinth, and raced Fre+gels.
Concepcio when in vnlike clauses a certeyn co~mon thynge that is put in one of the~, can not agre with the other, excepte it be chaunged.
But thys is more playne in the latine because of the concordes, albe+it in englyshe for the verbe we may vse this example.
Hys head and hys handes were cutte of: In the whyche sentences the verbe agreeth wyth the nexte.
Appositio when two substa~tiues are put together immediatly with oute any verbe betwyxt, the one to declare the other, as in Uyrgyll.
Transgressio when the ryghte order of wordes is troubled, hath these kyndes.
Reuersio a preposterous order of the woordes contrarye to the good order of speakyng, as: He fell from of the wall, for he fel of from the walle.
Prepostera loquutio when ye that is done afterwardes, is set in speaking in the former place, as: plucke of my bootes and spurres.
Dissectio a cutting, when the ioy+nyng of a compound worde is losed by putting somewhat betwixt, as: Hys saying was true, as here shal appere after, for hereafter.
He shal be punyshed what man so euer offe~+deth, for whatsoeuer man.
Interpositio Interposicion, is a dissolucio~ of the order of the words by putting a sentence betwixt, as: The man (I speke it for no harme) wyl somtime haue his owne wyll.
Defectus when somewhat lacketh in speakyng, but co~menlye vsed to be vnderstand, as: Good morowe, good nyght.
Casus pro casu when one case is putte for another, as me thynke it is so.
Of Scheme, the second parte is in speach as it a faute, which though it be pardoned in Poetes, yet in prose it is not to be suffered.
Obscure is, when ther is a darknes thorow faut, eyther of the wordes, or of the settynge of them, and these ben the partes.
Improprietas when a worde nothynge at all in hys proper significacion is broughte into a sentence as a cloude: as you shall haue syxe strypes you longe for.
Super abundancia when ye sentence is laden with superfluous wordes, as, he spake it wyth his mouthe, he sawe it wyth hys eyes.
Sermo superfluus when a sente~ce is added, ye matter therby made neuer the waightyer: as ye Embassa+dours obteining no peace, returned backe home, fro~ whe~ce they came.
Inutilis eiusdem is a vayne repeting agayn of one word or moe in all one sentence, whyche faute by takyng lytle heede, Cicero also fell into, as in the oracion for Aulus Cluencius.
Sermo ubique sui similis a greater faute then the other, is when the whole matter is all alyke, and hath no varietie to auoyde tedious+nes, as: He came thither to ye bath, yet he saide afterwardes.
Afterwardes he chyd wyth hym, cryed more and more when manye were presente.
Suche a folyshe tellyng of a tale shall you heare in ma+ny simple halle folyshe persons.
Ambiguitas when thorow faute of ioynyng the wordes, it is doutefull to whych the verbe belongeth, as: Hys father loueth hym better then hys mother.
Sedulitas superflua when ther in speakyng tomuch diligence and curiositye, and the sentence ouerla+den with superuous wordes, whiche faute is the same, or verye lyke to that, that is called Macrologia whych is when the sentence vpon desyre to seme fyne and eloquent, is longer then it shulde be.
Inordinate is, when eyther order or dignitie lacketh in the wordes: and the kyndes ben these.
Humiliatio when the dygnitye of the thyng is diminyshed by basenes of the worde: as if we shuld say to a greate prynce or a kynge: If it please your mastershyp.
Turpis loquutio when the words be spoken, or ioyned together, that they may be wronge into a fylthye sence.
Of thys it nedeth not to put any example, when lewde wanton persons wyl soone fynde in owe.
Mala affectatio euyll affectacio~ or leude folowyng, when the wytte lacketh iudgement, and folowyng a good maner of speaking, runne into a faute, as when affectyng copy, we fall into a vaine bab+lynge, or laboryng to be brief, wax bare drye.
Also if we shuld saye: a phrase of building, or an audie~ce of shepe, as a certe~ homely felow dyd.
Male figuratum when the oracion is all playne and symple, lacketh his figures, wherby as it wer wyth starres it might shyne: which faute is counted of wryters, not amonge the leaste.
Male collocatum when wordes be naughtelye ioyned together, or set in a place wher thei shuld not be Cumulatio a mynglyng and hea+pyng together of wordes of diuerse languages into one speche: as of Frenche, welche, spanyshe, into englyshe: and an vsynge of wordes be they pure or barbarous.
And although great authors somtyme in long workes vse some of these fautes, yet must not their examples be folowed, nor brought into a co~mon vsage of speakyng.
Barbarie is a faute, whych turneth the speche fro~ his purenes, and maketh it foule and rude, and the partes be these.
Barbarismus is, when a worde is either naughtely wrytten or pro+nou~ced co~trary to the ryght law maner of speakinge.
And it is done by addicion, detraccio~, chaunging, transposynge, eyther of a letter, a syllable, tyme, accent, or aspiracio~.
Hereof we haue shewed exampels partly wher they be called figures, and partly, doute ye not, but both the speakynge and wrytyng of bar+barouse men, wyll gyue you mow. Hytherto be referred the fautes of euil pronouncing certein letters, of tomuch gapyng, or contrarye of speakyng in the mouth.
Inconueniens structura is an vnmete and vnconuenient ioynynge together the partes of spech in construccion, whych is by all thynges that belong to the partes of speche: as when one pae is put for another, when gender for gender, case for case, tyme for tyme, mode for mode, number for number, aduerbe for aduerbe, preposicion for preposicio~: whych because it is vsed of famous authores, in stede of fautes, be called figures.
Uertue, or as we saye, a grace dygnitye in speakynge, the thyrde kynde of Scheme, is when the sentence is bewtyfied and lyfte vp aboue the comen maner of speaking of the people.
Proprietie, is when in wryting and pronunciacion ther be no fautes committed, but thynges done as they shulde be.
Proportio proporcion is, whereby the maner of true wrytynge is conserued.
By thys the barbarous tonge is seperated from the verye true and naturall speche, as be the fyne metals from the grosser.
To speke is no lawe, but an obseruacion or markyng, not leanyng vpo~ cause, but vpon example.
For in eloquence, the iudgement of excelle~t men standeth for reason, as saythe Quintilian in hys fyrst boke.

In figure is no alteracion in the wordes fro~ their proper significacions, but only is the oracion se~tence made by the~ more ple+sau~t, sharpe veheme~t, after ye affec+cio~ of him that speketh or writeth: to ye which vse although tropes also do serue, yet properlye be they so called, because in them for necessitye or garnyshynge, there is a monynge and chaungynge of a worde and sentence, from theyr owne significacio~ into another, whych may agre wyth it by a similitude.

Particion called also distribucion rethoricall, is when a thing that mai be generally spoke~, is more largely declared, and diuided into partes.
This se~tence spoken as it were in a su~me, may be enlarged, if seuerally you reherse vp al the kindes of lear+ning.

So maruelouslye he knoweth all the of al the Poetes, he so aboundeth in the floures of the Rethoricians: He hath so boulted oute the paynefull rules of the gramarians.

Hitherto also apperteineth, whe~ we expou~d a thyng not barely, but repete the causes also sumwhat before, and of what begynnynges it came of.
As if not contente to haue sayd, that the made ba+taile with the Neapolitans, we rehearse also what wer the causes of theyr stryfe, who was the setter for+ward, and what was the occasion of the warre, what hope and truste eyther of them had to the victorye.

The thyrd kynde is the expression of lighter affeccions, as when wee go about by fayre meanes to gette the mery affeccions of menne to vs ward or to other, when the mynd is lyft vp into hope, myrth, laugh+ter, and as be louyng salutations, promises, co~munynges together in familiar epistles and dialogues, and the getting of loue and fauour in the begynnynges, and finallye thys figure doth teach, that Retho+rique is a part of flattery.
The sixt kynde of rethoricall descripcion is Pathopeia that is expressyng of vehement affeccions and perturbacions, of yt whych ther be two sortes.
The fyrste called Donysis or intencion, and some call it imaginacion, wherby feare, anger, madnes, hate+red, enuye, and lyke other perturba+cions of mynde is shewed and described, as in Ciceros inuectiues.
Another forme is called or wherby teares be pyked out, or pyty is moued, or forgeuenes, as in Ciceros peroracio~s, and complaintes in Poets: And to be shorte ther is gotten no greater admiracion or commendacion of eloquence then of these two, AEtopeia and Pathopeia if they be vsed in place.
The .vii. kind is Dialogismus whych is how often a short or long communicacion is fayned to a per+son, accordyng to the comelines of it.
The .viii. kynd is called Mimisis that is a folowing eyther of the wordes or manoures whereby we expresse not onlye wordes of the person, but also the gesture: and these foresayd sixe kindes Quintiliane dothe put vnder Prosopopeia
The .ix. kynde is the descripcion of a place, as of Carthage in the fyrst of Eneid.
The .x. kynd is called Topotesia that is ficcion of a place, when a place is described such one perad+uenture as is not, as of the fieldes called Elisii in Uirgil: refer hither Astrothesiam that is the descripcio~ of starres.
The .xi. kinde is Chronographia that is the descripcion of the tyme, as of nyght, daye, and the tymes of the yere.
greate parte of eloquence is set in increasing and diminyshing, and serueth for thys purpose, that the thyng shulde seme as great as it is in dede, lesser or greater then it seemeth to manye.
For the rude people haue commonly a preposterous iudgeme~t, and take the worst thynges for the beste, and the beste for the worst.
Al amplificacion and dimmucion is taken eyther of thin+ges, or of wordes.
Of thynges ryse effeccions, of words those fashions that nowe wyll shewe.
The first waye of increasyng or diminishing is by chaungynge the worde of the thynge, when in encreasynge we vse a more cruell worde, and a softer in diminyshynge, as when we call an euyll man a thiefe, and saye he hathe kylled vs, when he hathe beaten vs.
And it is more veheme~te if by correccion we compare greater wordes wyth those that we put before: As thou haste broughte not a thyefe, but an extorcioner, an adulterer, but a rauysher. &c. Lyke vnto this is Hyperbole whyche saythe more then the truthe is in deede, as when we saye: The crye was hearde to heauen, meanyng it was a greate crye.
An other kynde is by increase, whyche is when the thynges goyng before beynge exaggerate, we come from them to the hyeste: As agaynste Uerres.
It is a myscheuous deede to bynde a Citizen of Rome, haynous to beate hym, what? shall saye to hange hym? Another waye of increase is, when wythoute disstinccion in the context and course of the oracion, the circumstaunces sette in order, somewhat alwayes is added bygger then the fyrste, and that we come to the hyest by a swyfte pace.
As he was not ashamed to playe at dyce wyth iesters in the common cokerye, beynge a prieste, a Person, a Diuine, and a Monke.
There is another kynde of amplyfienge that is by comparison contrary to increase.
For as in increase the thynges that go before beyng exaggerat, we go from them to the hyest, so comparison ta+keth increase of the lesser, whych if they be greater in all mens opinions, that must nedes appeare verie greate that we wyll haue And comparison is made by ficcion, by puttynge to an example.
As in the fyrst part of the amplifiyng of Automes vomite, for he fayneth it had happened vnto hym at supper beyng but a priuate person.
If at supper in these great bowles of thine thys happened vn+to thee, who wolde not haue counted it a shame: But now in ye syght of the people of Rome beynge a co~mon officer, master of the horse, to whom it was shame once to belch· he wyth hys gobbets of meat that stanke al of wyne, fylled al his lap, and the iudgement seate.
Here am+plificacion is taken of smaller thin+ges, and is made by one degree of many degrees, this maye be an example.
If a ma~ gaue the euery yere xl. pou~d, woldest yu not thanke him? If a friend had redemed the out of prison wt hys money, woldest thou not loue hym? If eyther in battell or shypwracke a man by hys valiantnes had saued the, woldest thou not worshyp hym as God, and saye thou were neuer able to make hym amendes? What ingratitude is it then that Christ God man, which hathe made the, to whom thou dost owe al that thou hast, &c. so to dispyse hym, so wyth dayely fautes to anger him, for so great beniuole~ce to geue hym agayn so great contumelye and despyte? Neyther skylleth it that we haue rehearsed ficci+on and comparacion amonge argu+mentes, for there is no cause why that amplificacion and ornacion shuld not be taken out of the same places from whence ther commeth probacion.
Nor it is no newes the selfe same thynges to be applyed to diuerse vses.
As of all circumstaunces both of the thyng, and of the person are taken argumentes, but euen oute of the selfe same are affeccions and whych is manifest in the kynde As when we prayse chastitie in a yonge man, we go not aboute to perswade that he was chaste, but that that vertue shulde appeare greater in floryshyng age.
To lyke vse serue examples and similitudes, as in Esaye: The Oxe knewe hys owner, and the Asse the maunger of hys master, but Israel hathe not knowen me.
The example of the Oxe the Asse is not vsed for this to proue that the Hebrewes dyd not knowe their God, but that the impietie and folishnes of that nacion shulde be amplified.
The same may be applied to profe after thys maner.
If the Oxe and Asse knowledge theyr masters, of who~ they are norished and do serue them, how much more conueniente is it, that ma~ shuld knowledge hys maker and norisher, and serue him bothe in bodye and mynd.
Contrarye, when Paul sayth: no man serueth in warre on his owne wages, he proueth by similitudes, that it is not comelye, that they that war vnder the gospell, shulde be compel+led to be carefull for their liuynge.
He shuld haue applied it to amplifiyng, if he had propouned it thus.
They that serue vnder a capteine be not careful for their liuyng, but lokinge for the sustenaunce of their capteine, only studye for thys to do hym faythful seruice, howe muche more shame is it that some menne that haue promised to fyght vnder Christ in the gospel, to distrust such a capteyne, and studye all they can to gather riches.
Co~parison by put+tyng to example is, whe~ by setting out as it were a lyke example, wee brynge to passe that that we exaggerate may be thought either very lyke, eyther equal, either bygger.
And in this kynd both the whole is co~pared to the whole, the partes to partes: as in the oracion of for Milo.
Did pray you yt no+ble ma~ Scipio being a priuat perso~ kil Tiberius Gracchus whych sha+ked the co~mo~ wealthe but a lytle, shall wee beynge consulles suffer Catiline, that gothe aboute to wast the whole worlde wyth murther and fyre? Here bothe Catiline is compared to Gracchus, and the estate of the common wealthe to the whole world, a lytle shakyng to slaughter, fyer and wastyng, and a priuate person to the consuls.
Ther is an amplificacion also whe~ contraries be set together, wherby bothe the partes seme bygger, and more euidente.
As when exhorting men to liberalitie, we shewe howe foule a faute couetousenes is, that the foulnes of the faute being exag+gerate, the goodlines of the vertue shulde be more encreased.
There is another kynd of amplifiyng called reasonynge, when of those thinges that eyther folowe or go before, the hearer doth gather how great that thynge is that we wolde to be amplified.
By thynges that go before, as when Homer armeth Achylles, or Hector to batayle, by the greate preparacion, we gather how sore ye fight shal be.
Of thinges yt folowe: How much wyne Antony dranke, when yt hauyng such a strong body he was not able to digeste it, but spewed it vp the nexte daye after.
Of thynges ioyned to: as whe~ Ma+ro sayeth to Poliphemus: He had the bodye of a pineapple tree for a staffe in hys hande.
Manye other kyndes ben there of amplifiynge, which who so wyl se more at large, may read that right excellent boke of the famouse doctor Erasmus, whych he intituled the preacher.
The inuencion of many proposi+cions is, when the chyefe state or principal proposion of the cause is declared and proued by manye other proposicions and argume~tes, so set in iuste order that there be no confusion of proposions.
And proposicions be taken partely of those that be co~mon, and partly of those thynges that belonge properlye to the cause: As if a man wolde counsell Tullye not to take the condicion offered of Antony, that is, that by burnynge of hys bookes called philippia, he shulde haue hys lyfe, he myght vse commonly these proposicions.
Fyrste yt no man oughte to by his life so dere, that therby he shulde lose hys immortall name.
To thys generall may serue a perticuler taken oute of circumstaunces, that it oughte not to be done, of Cicero, whych by so many laboures hathe gotten vnto hym selfe an excellente and euerlastyng name, and that hath shewed moste eloquently by putting out so manye noble workes that deathe ought to be despised, inespeciallye seynge that now he hath not much tyme to beynge an olde man.
Agayn, another principall proposicion shall be taken of the circu~stau~ces.
That nothynge is worse, then that Cicero beyng a very good ma~ shulde owe his lyfe to Antonye the worst man of the world.
The third proposicion shal be co~iectural: how that Antony craftely goeth about that the bookes beynge burned, in the whych he perceiueth bothe hys owne immortal infamye to be, and the immortal glory of Cicero, whe~ he hath afterwardes taken awaye hys lyfe, he maye vtterlye extinguyshe Cicero.
So when proposicions be found, remaineth argume~tacio~ or proues, called in Greke Pistis because they make suretye of a doutefull thyng.
Unartificial be, foreiudgeme~tes, rumoures, tormentes, tabelles, othe, wytnesses, diuinacion, oracles.
To these be referred whych the Greekes cal Symeia or sygnes: For they also commonlye are not fer by the wytte of hym that disputeth, but are ministred otherwyse.
They be called signes properlye, whyche rysynge of the thynge it selfe that is in question come vnder the sences of menne, as threatninges, whych be of the time that is paste, cryinge herde oute of a place, whyche is of the tyme presente, of hym whyche is ared of the murther, whyche is of the tyme folowynge, or that bloud leapte oute of the bodye latelye when he came that dyd the murther.
Also of signes some bee necessary, as that he liueth whiche dothe breathe, and some probable, as bloude in the garmente, whych myghte also come oute of the nose, or otherwyse.
Also proues and argumentes are taken oute of circu~staunces, partly of the person, part+lye of the cause or thyng it self, and be called also of the Rethoricians places, neyther cleane contrarie to those that Aristotle hath taughte, neyther the very same: for some agree wyth them, some be all one, and some diuerse.
Onlye differeth the manour of teachynge, because the Rethoricianes do teache a patrone, the philosopher generally helpeth iudgement.
Kinred, nacion, coutrey, kynde, age, bryngynge vp, or discipline, of the body, fortune, condicion, nature of the mynde, studies, affectacion, wordes forespoken, deedes done before, commocion, counsell, name.
Kynred monisheth vs to co~sider of what progeny a man dothe come.
For it is semely, and happeneth co~monlye that the sonnes belyke the forefathers, and thereof procedeth causes to lyue well or euyll: Nacio~ sheweth what disposicion and maners euery nacion hath peculiarly of theyr owne.
The difference of kynde is knowen to euerye man: To diuerse ages diuerse thyngs be conueniente.
It skylleth more by whom, and by what wayes men be brought vp, then of whom they be begotten.
The hautoure of the bodye comprehendeth fayrnes or foul+nes, strength or weaknes: more credible is the accusacion of lecherye in a fayre body then in a foule, and violence more probable in the strong, then in the weake.
Condicion comprehendeth manye thynges: as whether he be noble or not noble, an officer, or a priuate person, a father or a sonne, a citizen or a straunger, a fre man, or a seruaunt, a maried manne, or a single man, a father or none, hauinge had but one wyfe, or two.
The nature of the mynde hath manifold varieties in men.
Some be fearful, some strong some gentle, some veheme~t, chaste, lecherous, glorious, &c. Studies, for other be the maners of the rustical, then of the law+yer, of the marchaunte, then of the Soldier, of the shipman then of the phisicion.
To these they adde affec+tacion: For it skylleth muche what maner man euerye one wolde seme to be, whether he be ye same or not: as ryche, or eloquent, iuste or mightie, mery or sad, a fauorer of the peo+ple, or of the great men.
Both wordes that be spoken before time, and dedes that be done, be also considered.
For of thynges that be paste, the present be estemed, also thinges that be to come.
Co~mocion in thys from the nature of the mynde, because that one is perpetuall that for a whyle: as anger is commocion, rancour the nature of the mynde, and feare a co~+mocion, fearefulnesse nature.
To these they adde the name of the person, of whence many tymes an argument is take~: as Cicero resteth muche vpon Uerres, or sweepers name, because beyng a strong thief, he swepte altogether.
Thus haue we shewed that much matter may be taken of thynges belongyng to a personne, so maye be also of those that belonge to a thynge or cause, whiche places bee so handeled of that he myngleth the~ wyth the places whyche Aristotle hathe comprehended in hys bookes of Topyckes.
Circumstances of the thynges be these: Cause, place, tyme, facultie, instrumente, manour.
And fyrste of euerye thinge there be foure causes, efficient, materiall, formall and finall.
The forme causeth it to be thys, and not another thynge: as the reasonable soule geueth to the body that it is a man, and the soule because it is a substaunce hathe her vnnamed forme, whereby she is a soule, and not an aungel.
And what soeuer is made, is made to a certen ende, and one thynge maye haue di+uerse endes: as nature hathe geuen brestes vnto women to geue milke, and also for comlynesse of theyr bodies, neyther doth any man that is of a sounde mynde take vpon hym anye businesse, but for that he desyreth to haue thynge: nor there is nothynge desyred, but vnder the consideracion of good or profite.
So the ende whyche is laste in effecte, and fyrste in intencion, loketh vpon the gettinge of profites, increase, and co~firmacion of them, and also vpon them, eschuynge of disprofites, diminyshynge, or puttyng them awaye.
But in chosyng them, false perswacion deceyueth manye, whylest by errour they beleue that to be good yt is naughte.
This place therfore serueth for ma+ny thynges, to make more or lesse.
Greatly happy shulde men be, if euerye man wolde looke vpon the marke, not the whych desyre hathe sette before hym, but whyche God and honest reason hath prefixed.
And of suche strengthe is the ende, that hereof is taken the felicitie of euery thyng.
To fast that the body maye obeye the mynde, to do good workes is an holy deede.
To faste to be whole in thy bodie is phisycke, and so of prai+ynge, almose, and other laudable workes.
An other circumstaunce of a thynge, is the place, whose qualitie oftentimes maketh the faute either greter or lesser: as to steale an holye thing out of an holy place, is worse then some other kynde of theft.
No lesse matter of argumentacion ministreth the qualitie of time, which signifieth two thynges.
Fyrst it is taken playnly for the time present, past, or to come: Seconde it signifieth oportunitie to do a thynge, and so when a man cometh as we wold haue it, we saye he cometh in time.
And in the seuenth of Ihon, when Christ sayth: My tyme is not yet come, tyme is taken for oportunitie of tyme.
The Rethoricianes put chaunce vnder tyme, because the ende of a thynge perteyneth to the time that foloweth: but of thys wyll we speke in the place called Euent.
Facultie is a power to do the thynge that is taken in hand: and in coniectures two thinges speciallye be considered: whether he could or wold.
Wyll is gathered of hope to performe it, and is made more probable whe~ the na+ture of the mynde is ioyned to it: as it is not like he wyl abide in his glorye, because he is enuious and ambicious.
Also when we counsell one to leaue of vayne mournynge, when it is not in his power to get agayne that is gone.
Instrument semeth to be a part of facultie: for instrumentes sometyme are cause of oure hablenes to do a thinge: and it is a more mische+uous deede to kyl with venome the~ with swearde.
And to instrume~t is the manour of doyng, that almoste it is all one.
But more properlye perteyne to the manour or fashion, those thynges that be eyther excused, or made greater by wyl: As lesse faute is it to fall into a vice by ignorance or frailtie, then of a purpose and full deliberacion.
The vse of circu~stances profiteth to amplifie, to extenuate, to euidence, to confirmacion, and probabilitie.
And hytherto be referred also the common places that indifferentlye apperteyne to all kyndes and partes of causes, of the whyche Rodulphe entreateth, and Aristotle in hys Topyckes.
But before we speake of them, it is to be noted, that thys woorde place, is taken foure maner of wayes.
They are called common places, because thei be entreated of, of bothe partes, althoughe not in all one cause: as he that is sore spoken agaynste by wit+nesses, swadeth that we shulde not geue credite to witnesses.
Contrarye, he that is by them spea+keth in defence of wytnesses, and so of other that we spake of before, when we entreated of vnartificial argumentes.
Lyke to thys sorte be sentences, whyche wee as it were wythoute the cause, but so that they serue to the cause whiche wee haue in hande: as bee the amplificacions of vertues, and the exaggeracions of vices.
As when wee accuse anye manne that by euyll companions he was broughte to do also the mischeuouse deede, common place shall bee, wyth wordes to exaggerate howe much it profiteth to keepe goodnesse, to bee in companye wyth good men, and contrarye howe greate myschyefe the companye of euyll men dothe cause.
In the third sence places be called seates of argumentes, whyche the Rethoricianes do applie to kyndes of causes: As in the kynde suasorie, honest, profitable, pleasau~t easye, necessarie. &c.
In demonstratiue kynde, kynred, contrey, goodes of the bodye and of the mynde.
In the Iudiciall kynde, inespecial deniall, those that we spake of euen nowe.
The fourth places be general, whych declare what belongeth to euerye thynge, and howe oute of eche of them there be taken argumentes, partly necessary, and partlye probable.
These be commen to the Oratours with the Logicians, albeit Aristotle hathe seperatelye written of them in hys Topickes, and in his Rethorickes hathe not touched the~, and they profite much both to iudgement, and to endightynge, but the varietie of authors hath made the handlynge of them sumwhat darke, because amonge them selues they can not wel agre, neyther of the names, neyther of the number, neyther of the order.
An example is a rehearsall of a thynge that is done, and an applyynge of it vnto our cause, eyther for similitude or dissimilitude, profitable to perswade, garnyshe, and delyght.
Examples, some be taken out of hystories, some of tales, some of fayned argume~tes, in comedies, and bothe sortes be dilated by parable and comparacion.
Parable is a feete similitude, whych sheweth ye example that is brought, ether like, vnlyke or co~tra+rye.
Lyke as Camillus restored the common wealth of the Romaines that was oppressed by the Frenchmen, and when it was brought into extreme losse, by theyr valiauntnesse expelled the Barbariens: So Ualla, whan thorowe the ignora~ce of ye Barbarians, learnyng was de+stroyed, restored it agayn, as it wer from death into hys former bright+nes.
As not lyke thanke is done to Laurence and Camillus, be+cause that the one moued by vertue wyth the ieopardie of hys lyfe deliuered his contrey from the vngra+cious, that other styrred vp by desyre of fame, or rather wyth an euyll luste to checke manye, resto+red agayn the oppressed, but brought it as it were into certen rules.
Co~trary, Brutus kylled hys chyldren goyng about treason, Manlius punished by death the va+liauntnes of hys sonne.
Comparacion sheweth ye thing yt is brought, eyther equall, lesse, or bigger: Lesse, as our elders haue warred oftentymes, because theyr marchau~tes and mariners wer euyl entreated.
What mynd ought you to be in, so many thousande citizens of Rome slaine at one message, and one time? Equall, as in the same Cicero.
For it happed vnto me to stand for an offyce wyth two gentlemenne, that one very naughte, that other very gentle, yet ouercame Catiline by dignitie, and Galba by fauoure.
Bygger: As for Milo, they saye he shulde not lyue that confesseth he hathe kylled a man, when M. Horacius was quitte, whyche kylled hys owne syster.
Parable, which some call simili+tude, some co~paracion, is a comparyng of a thyng yt hath no life, or no bodye to our cause and purpose, for some thyng that is lyke or vnlyke.
And as example is taken of ye dede of a man, and the person of an hystorye, or that is fabulous and fayned, so is comparison taken of thinges that be done, or that be ioyned to them by nature, or by chaunce.
As Attilius retournyng agayne to hys enemies is an example of kepynge faythe and promise: But a shyp in the whych the sayles be vp, or take~ down after the blow+yng of the winde, is a parable whiche reacheth a wyse man to geue place to tyme, and applye hymselfe to the world that is presente.
And lyke fashion is of a parable, as we haue shewed in example.
For sometime it is noted in a word as: Doest thou not vnderstand that the sayles muste be turned? Sometyme it is more largelye declared, as in the oracion for
And if vnto menne that sayle out of the hauen. &c. Analogia.
Icon called of the latines Imago an Image in Englyshe, is muche lyke to a similitude, and if you declare it is a similitude: as if you saye: As an Asse wyll not be driuen from her meat, no not with a club, vntyl she be full: no more wil a war+riour reste from murther vntyil he hath fylled his mynd with it.
This is a similitude: but if you saye that a man flewe vpon his enemies like a dragon, or lyke a lyon, it is an Image.
Howbeit an Image serueth rather to euidence or grauitie, or io+cunditie, then to a profe.
There is also a general comparacion, speciallye in the kynde demonstratiue, person wyth person, and one thing with an other, for praise or dispraise Indicacio or authoritie, is the co~paring of an other mans saying or sentence vnto our cause: of the whiche ther be seuen principal kyndes.
The fyrst a comon morall sentence, as a common principle perteyning to maners: as continuall laboure ouercommeth all thynges, and as be the sentences of Salomon and Cato: and all morall philosophy is ful of suche sentences.
The seconde are common rules, whych be called dignities in euery science.
The fourth called Chria which is a very short exposicion of any dede or worde wyth the name of the author recited.
The fyfte an Enthimeme whyche is a sentence of contraries: as if it be a great praise to please good men, surely to please euyl men it is a greate shame.
The called AEnos that is a saying or a sentence, taken out of a tale, as be the interpretacions of fables, and theyr allegories.
The seuen is any answere take~ out of the mouth of God, or taken out of the co~maun+dement of God.
Expolicion is, when we tarye in one thynge, speakynge the same in diuerse wordes and fashions, as though it were not one matter but diuerse.
goodlye example of the moste largest expolicion is rehearsed in Erasmus, whych, because it is very profitable, wyll wholye rehearse it.
wyse man for the co~mon wealth sake shall eschue no pe+ryll: euen for thys cause that it hap+peneth ofte~, that wher he wold not dye for the common wealth, he perysheth yet of necessitie wyth the co~mon wealth.
And because all the commodities we haue be taken of our contrey, ther ought no to be counted paynfull, taken for our contrey.
They therfore that flye that peryll which must be take~ for the co~mon wealth, do folyshely: for neither can they auoyde it, and they be found vngrate to the citie.
But they that by their owne peril put away the perils of their co~trei, they are to be counted wyse, seyng that bothe they geue to the co~mon wealth that honour yt they shulde geue, and had rather dye for many, the~ wt many.
For it is much against reason that receiuing thy naturall lyfe by thy coutrey, to deliuer it agayne to nature when she compelleth the, and not to geue it to thy co~+trey when she desyreth the.
And where yu mayst wyth hye valiauntnes honour die for thy contrei, to haue rather lyke a cowarde to liue in shame.
And for thy fryndes and parentes, and other acquayntance to put thy selfe in peryll: for the co~mon wealth in the whyche both it that most reuerende name of the contrey is conteyned, not to be wil+lynge to come in ieopardye.
Wher+fore as he is to be dyspised whyche being vpon the sea had rather haue hym selfe safe, then the ship: so is he to be rebuked, whych in ieopardye of the commen wealthe, prouideth more for his own then for ye co~mon wealthe.
When the shyppe hathe ben broken, many haue ben saued: But after the shypwrake of the co~trey no man can escape.
Whyche thynge me thynketh Decius dyd wel perceiue, whych reported who+ly to haue bestowed hym selfe, and for the sauegard of his men of war to haue run amonge the myddest of hys enemyes.
Wherfore he loste hys lyfe, but let it go: for he redemed for a thynge of verye small pryce a ryght dere thyng.
He loste his life, but he inioyed glo+rye, whyche written to his greate prayse, shyneth euerye daye more and more.
Wherefore if we haue proued both by reason by exa~ple, that we be bounde to put oure selfe in peryll for the common wealthe, they are to be counted wyse men, whych for the sauegarde of the con+trey auoyde no peryll.
It wolde be meete to exercyse chyldren in suche themes, wherby shal be gotte~ bothe wysedome and eloquence.
And here me thynketh maye ryghte well ende these Rethoricall preceptes, although be not ignoraunt that much helpeth bothe to persuasions and copye, the proper handlyng of tales taken oute of the nature of beastes, dreames, fayned narracions, sumwhat lyke vnto the truth, wt allegories much vsed of diuines.
But because they requyre a longer treatie, for this tyme leaue them of, addynge vnto these before written rules of oratory, a declamacion bothe profitable and verye eloquente, wrytten by Erasmus vnto the moste noble Duke of Cleue, as here appereth after.
That chyldren oughte to be taught and brought vp ge~tly in vertue and learnynge, and that euen forthwyth from theyr na+tiuitie: declamacion of a briefe theme, by Erasmus of
IF thou wilt harken vnto me, or rather to Chrisip+pus, the sharpeste of Philosophers, yt shalte prouide yt thyne infante and yonge babe be forthewyth instructed in good learnyng, whylest hys wyt is yet voyde from cares and vices, whilest his age is tender and tractable, and his mind flexible and ready to folowe euery thyng, and also wyl kepe fast good lessons and preceptes.
For we reme~+ber nothynge so well when we be olde, as those thynges yt we learne in yonge yeres.
Care not thou for those fooles wordes which charter that thys age, partly is not hable inough to receiue discipline, part+lye vnmete to abyde the labours of studies.
For fyrst, the beginninges of learning, sta~d specially by memo+rie, which as sayd, in yo~g ones is very holdfast.
Secondly because na+ture hath made vs to knowledge the study of yt thynge can not be to hasty, wherof ye author of al thyng her self hath graffed in vs seedes.
Beside this some things be necessa+ry to be knowe~ whe~ we be su~what elder, which by a certe~ peculier rea+dines of nature, ye tender age percei+ueth both much more quickly, also more esily the~ doth ye elder, as ye first beginnings of letters, ye know+ledge of to~ges, tales fabels of poetes.
Finallye, why shulde ye age he vnmere to lerning, which is apt to lerne maners? Or what o+ther thinge shuld chyldre~ do rather whe~ they be more able to speake, se+yng nedes thei muste do sumwhat? How much more profite is it ye age to sporte in letters, then in triffes? Thou wilt say yt it is but of litle va+lue yt is done in those fyrste yeres.
Why is it dispised as a smal thing, which is necessary to a very greate matter? And why is yt lucre, it ne+uer so litle, yet a lucre, dispised of purpose? Now if you ofte~ put a lytle to a litle, there riseth a greate heape.
Herewith co~sider this also, if beyng an infant he lerne smaller thinges, he shal lerne greter, growynge vpwardes in those yeres, in which those smaller shuld haue ben lerned.
Finally while he doth these things, at ye least he shal be kept fro~ those fautes, wherwt we se come~ly yt age to be infected.
For nothynge doth better occupy ye whole mynd of man, the~ studies.
Uerely this lucre ought not to be set light bi.
But if we shuld grau~te that by these labours strength of ye body is sumwhat diminished, yet thinke this losse well reco~pensed by winnynge of wyt.
For the minde by moderate labours is made more quycke lustye.
And if ther be any ieopardy in this pointe, it may be auoyded by our dilige~ce.
You must haue for this tender age a teacher to enter it by fayre meanes, not discorage it by foule.
And ther be also some things both plesau~t to be knowen, as it wer sibbe to childre~s wittes, whiche to lerne is rather a play the~ a la+bour.
Howbeit childehod is not so weake which eue~ for thys is ye more mete to take paynes labour, because they not what labour is.
Therfore if thou wylte remember how far vnworthy he is to be coun+ted a ma~ which is void of learning, and how flitting the life of man is, how slypper youth is to myschiefe, and mans age howe it desyreth to occupied, how baren olde age is, and further how few come vnto it, thou wylt not suffer thy yong babe in the whych thou shalte lyue styll as it were borne agayne, to let go any parte of hys tyme vnoccupied, in the whych any thynge maye be gotten that eyther maye do muche good to all ye whole lyfe afterwardes, or kepe it awaye from hurtes, and mischiefes.
After the longe despayred fruitfulnes of thy wyfe, hearsay thou art made a father, and that wyth a man chylde, whyche sheweth in it selfe a meruelous towardnes, and euen to be lyke the parentes: and that if so be we maye by such markes and tokens prouosticate anye thyng, maye seeme to promise perfite vertue.
And that therfore thou doest entend, to se thys chylde of so grete hope, as he some what of age to be begonne in good letters, and to be taught in very ho+nest learnynge, to be instructed and fashioned with the very wholsome preceptes of philosophy.
In deede you wyll be the whole father, and you wyll haue hym your very son, and to loke lyke you, not only in the fashion of hys face, and liniame~tes of hys bodye, but also in the giftes of hys wytte.
Uerely as am hertelye glad for the good fortune of myne especiall friende, so greatlye alowe your wyse entente.
This one thynge wolde warne you of boldlye in deede, but louinglye, not to suffer after the iudgemente and example of the co~mon people, that the fyrst age of your infante shulde flytte awaye wythout all fruite of good instruccio~, and then at the last to set hym to learne hys fyrste letters, when bothe hys age wyll not so well be handled, and hys wye shall be more readye to euyll, and peraduenture possessed alreadye wt the fast holdyng bryers of vices.
Yea rather eue~ now loke about for some man, as of maners pure vncorrupt, so also wel learned: into his lap deliuer your litle chyld, as it wer to a nurse of his te~der mind, that eue~ wt his milke he may sucke in swete lerning: deuide the care of thy litle so~ne to his nurses teacher that thei shuld suckun the litle body wt very good iuyce, so indue hys mynd wt very wholsom opinions, very honest lernynge.
For thinke it not conuenient that yu one of al the best learned, also wysest shuldest geue eare to those piuyshe women, or vnto me~ very lyke to the~ the beard excepted, whych by a cru+ell pytie, hateful loue, iudge that the chyldren euen vntyl they waxe springoldes, shuld be kept at home kyssyng theyr mothers, and among the sweete wordes of theyr nurses pastymes, and vnchaste tryflynges of seruauntes and maydens.
And thynke that they ought vtterlye to be kepte awaye from learnyng as from venome, saying that the fyrst age is so rude that it can receiue no discipline, and so tender that it is not mete for the of studies: and finally that the profite of that age is so lytle worth, that neyther anye coste shulde be made vpon it, neyther yt the weakenes of the chyl+dre~ shuld be Whyle proue euery of these thynges false, pray you a lytle whyle take hede, countyng as the truth is, fyrst that these thynges be writte~ of him which lo+ueth you as wel as any ma~ doth, inespecially of yt thing which so per+teineth to you, yt none can do more.
For what is more derer to you the~ your son, inespecial hauing but him alone, vpon who~ we wold be glad if we might bestowe yea our life, not only our substau~ce.
Wherfore who mai not se yt thei do leudly also vn+towardli which in tilling their la~d building their houses, keping their horse, vse ye gretest dilige~ce thei ca~, take to counsell men yt be wyse, of great experience: in bringing vp and teachynge theyr chyldren, for whose sakes al other things ar got+ten, take so litle regard that nether they once councel with theyr owne mynd, not seke for the iudgements of wyse men, but as thoughe there were a trie in hande, geue eare to folyshe women, and to euery rascal wretche, whych is no lesse shame to hear, then if a man takyng thought for the shooe, wolde set naughte by the foote, or wyth great study wold prouide that there shuld be no faut in the garmente, naught reckynge for the healthe of the bodye.
Good syr, wyl not here cause you to tarye wyth common places, howe muche the strength of nature, how much fatherly loue, the law of god, mens constitucions require the parentes to owe vnto the childre~, tho+rowe whom asmuche as we maye wee escape to dye, and be made to lyue euer.
But some thynke they haue gaylye done the office of a father, when they haue only begotte~ chyldren, where as thys is the least porcion of loue that the name of a father requyreth.
What greate thought take the mothers comenlye leste the infant shulde loke a go+gle or a squint, lest he shuld be puffe cheked, wrie necked, croke shuldred, croke legged, splaye footed, and lest that the proporcion of his bodye shuld not be trimme in euery point: whereunto besyde other thynges, they be wont to vse swadel bondes, and keepe in their chekes wyth lytle miters.
They haue regard also to theyr mylke, their meate, theyr bathes, their mouinges, by whyche thynges the phisicions in many bookes, and inespeciall Galene hath taught that the chyldren get good healthe of theyr bodye: neyther do they differ thys dilige~ce vn+to the seuenth or tenth yere, but eue~ assone as the chylde commeth oute of the mothers wombe, they take greate charge of thys.
And they do well, for the infancie not regarded, oftentymes causeth men to haue a syckely and sore disseased olde age, if they happen to come to it.
Yea moreouer or euer the chyld be born, yet dothe the mother take greate heede: Thei eate not of euery meat when they be greate wyth chylde, they take heede that they moue not theyr bodie to hurte them: and if there happen any thyng to fall vpon their face, by and by they take it away wyth theyr hand, and laye it vpon the priuie part of theyr body.
It hath ben proued by many experimentes, that by this remedie the deformitie whych wold haue bene on that part of ye body that is sene, hathe lyen hyd in the secrete place.
No ma~ calleth this to hasty a care whych is vsed for the worser parte of man.
Why then is that parte of man, wherby we be properly called menne, neglected so many yeres? Shuld he not do all agaynste gods forbod which wold trim his cap, let+tyng his head be vnkempt, and all scabbed? Yet much more vnreasona+ble is it that we shuld bestow iuste labours vpon the mortall bodye, and to haue no regarde of the immortal soule.
Further, if a ma~ haue at home an horse colte, or a whelpe of a good kynd, wyl he not straight waye begynne to fashion hym to do sumwhat, and wyll do that so muche the more gladlye, the readyer the yonge age is to folow the teachers mynde? Wee wyl teache a popiniaye while time is, to speke as a manne dothe, knowynge well that the elder he waxeth, the lesse apte he wyll be to be taughte, yea the common prouerbe geuyng war+nynge of thys thynge: That an old popiniaye careth not for the rod.
And what a thynge is it to be diligente in a byrde, and owe in teachynge thy sonne? What do the wytty husbandmen? Do they not teach euen straight way the pla~tes whyle they be yet tender, to put awaye theyr wylde nature by graffynge, and wyll net tarye tyll they be waxen bygge and myghtye? And they do not onlye take heede that the litle tree grow not croked or haue any other faute, but if ther be anye, they make haste to amend it, whyle it wyll yet bowe, and folowe the hande of the fashioner.
And what liuyng thynge, or what plante wyll bee as the owener or or housebande manne wolde haue it to serue for, excepte oure dylygence helpe nature? The sooner it is donne, the better wyll it come to passe, Indede to manye dumme beastes, nature the mother of all thynges, hath geuen more helpe to do theyr natural offices, but because the pro+uide~ce of God hath of al creatures vnto men onlye geuen the strength of reason, she hath left the greatest parte to educacion, in so much that one hath written very wel the first poynte, the middle, and the thirde, that is the chyefe of all mans felici+tye, to be good instruccion, ryght bryngynge vp. Whych prayse Demosthenes gaue to ryght pronunci+acion, and that in deede not falsely, but ryghte bryngynge vp helpeth muche more to wysedome, then pro+nunciacion to eloquence.
For diligente and holy bringing vp, is the founteyne of al vertue: As to folye and myschief, the fyrst, seconde, and thyrde poynte is vndiligente and corrupte educacion.
Thys is the thynge that is chiefelye lefte vnto vs. That is the cause why vnto other beastes nature hathe geuen swyftnes, flyght, sharpnes of sight, greatnes, and strengthe of bodye, scales, flyshes, heares, hornes, nayles, venome, wherby they may both defende their healthe, and prouide for theyr liuynge, and brynge vp their yonge: and bryngeth forthe man onlye softe, naked, and vnfensed: but in stede of all thys, hath ge+uen hym a mynde hable to receiue all discipline, because in this onlye are all thynges, if a man wyll exer+cise it.
And euerye liuynge thynge, the lesse mete it is to learnynge, so muche the more it hathe of natiue prudence.
Bees learne not to make their celles, to and to make honye.
The are not taughte to gather into their holes in somer, wherby they shulde lyue in wynter, but all these thynges be done by instruccion of nature.
But man neyther can eate, nor go, nor speake, except he be taught.
Then if the tree brynge forthe eyther no fruite or vnsauerye, wythout the di+ligence of if the dogge be vnmete to hunte, the horse vnapte to iuste, the oxe to the plowe, except oure diligence bee putte to, howe wylde and vnprofitable a creature wolde man become, except dilige~tlye, and in dewe tyme he shulde be fashioned by good bryngynge vp.
wyll not here rehearse vnto you the example of Lycurgus knowen of euerye man, whyche bryngynge oute two whelpes, one of a gentle kynde, but euyll taughte, that ran to the that other of sluggyshe syres, but diligently brought vp, that the meate and leapt vpon the beast.
Nature is an effectuall thynge, but educacion more effectuall, ouercommeth it.
Menne take heede that they maye haue a good dog to hunte, to haue a good horse to iournei with, and here thei thynke no diligence to be to hastie, but to haue a sonne that shulde be both worship and profite to the parentes, vpon whome they myghte a good part of the charges of their houshold, whose loue mighte noryshe and beare vp their vnweldy age, and yt shuld shew hym self a trustye and healpynge sonne in a lawe, a good husbande to his wife, a valiaunte and profitable citizen to the common wealthe, saye to haue suche eue, eyther they take no care, or else they care to late.
For who~ do they plant? for who~ do they plowe? for who~ do they buylde? for who~ do thei hunt for riches both by land by sea? not for theyr chyldre~? But what profite or worshyp is in these thinges, if he yt shal be heire of the~ can not vse the~? With vnmesurable studye be possessions gotten, but of the possessor we take no kepe Who prepareth an harpe for the vnskylfull of musycke? Who garnysheth a librarie for hym that can skyl of no bookes? And are so great ryches gotten for hym whyche can not tell howe to vse them? If thou gettest these thynges to hym that is well broughte vp, thou geueste hym instrumentes of vertue: but if thou get them for a rude and rusticall wytte, what other thynge doest thou then minister a matter of wantonnesse and mischiefe? What canne bee thoughte more folyshe then thys kynde of fathers? They prouide that the bodie of the sonne maye be wythout faute, and shulde bee made apte to do all manner thynges comelye, but the mynde, by whose moderacion all honeste wyrkes do stand, that they care not for.
It nedeth me not here to rehearse that riches, dignitie, authoritie, and also healthlnes of body, whych menne so desirouslye wyshe to theyr chyldren, nothynge doth more get them vnto man, the~ vertue and learninge.
They wyshe vnto them a praye, but they wyll not geue the~ a nette to take it with all.
That thing which is of al most excellent, thou canst not geue thy sonne, but thou mayest store hym wyth those good sciences, wherby the best thinges be gotten.
Now is this a great inconuenience, but it is yet a greater, that they leaue at home their dogge wel taught, their horse well broken and taught, and theyr son enstructed wyth no learnyng.
They haue land well tylled, and theyr sonne shamefull rude.
They haue their house goodly trim+med, and theyr sonne voyde of all garnyshyng.
Further, they whych after the peoples estimacion seme to be meruelouse wyse, do prolong the diligence to garnyshe the mind eyther into an age vnapte to bee taughte, or else take no care at all for it, and are meruelouse thoughtfull of externall goodes of fortune, yea or he be borne, whom they haue appoynted to be lorde of the~ all.
For what se we not them to do? When their wyfe is greate wyth chylde, then call they for a searcher of natiuities, the parentes are whe+ther it shall be a man or a woman kynde.
If the astrologer by the byrth houre haue sayde that the chylde shulde be fortunate in warre: wee wyll, saye they, dedicate this chyld to the kinges courte.
If he shal pro+myse ecclesiasticall dygnitie, wee wyll, saye they, hunte for hym by some meanes, a Byshoprycke, or a fatte Abbotshyp.
Thys chylde wyl we make a president or a deane.
Thys semeth not to them to hasty a care when they preuente euen the very byrth: and semeth it to hastye that is vsed in fashioning your chil+drens myndes? So quyclye you pro+uide to haue your sonne a or an officer, and therewyth wylte thou not prouide that he maie be a profitable captayn or officer of the common wealth? Before the tyme come you go aboute this, to haue your sonne a byshop, or an abbot, and wylt thou not fashion hym to this well, to beare the office of a byshop, or an abbot? Thou seeste hym to a chariot, and shewest hym not the manner to guyde it.
Thou puttest hym to the and passest not that he shulde learne those thynges that becommeth a shypmaster to know.
Finally in all thy possessions thou regardest nothing lesse then that, that is moste precious, for whose sake al other thynges be gotten.
Thi corne fieldes be goodly, thy houses be fayre, thy ves+sel is bright, thy garmentes, and al thy housholde stuffe, thy horses bee wel kept, thi seruau~tes wel taught, only thy sonnes wyt is foule, filthy all sluttishe.
Thou hast perchau~ce bought by the dru~me a bond slaue, vyle, and barbarous, if he be rude and ignoraunt, yu markest to what vse he is good, trimly thou bryngest hym vp to some craft, either of the kytchen, physicke, husbandrye, or stewardshyp: only thy so~ne thou seest lyght by, as an thynge.
Thei wyl say: He shal haue inough to lyue on, but he shall not haue to lyue well on.
Comonly the rycher that men be, the lesse they care for the bryngyng vp of their chyldren.
What neede is it, say they, of anye learnyng, they shall haue inoughe? Yea the more nede haue they of the helpe of phylosophy and learnyng.
The greater the shyp is, the more marchandyse it carieth aboute, the more neede it hathe of a connynge shyppe master.
Howe greatlye do Prynces go about this, to leaue vn+to their sonnes as large a dominion as they ca~, and yet do none care lesse that they shuld be brought vp in those good wayes, wythoute the whych, principalitie can not wel be ordred.
How muche more dothe he geue, that geueth vs to lyue well, then to lyue? Uerye lytel do chyldren owe vnto theyre fathers of they be no more but begotten, and not also broughte vp to lyue verteouslye.
The saying of Alexander is muche spoken of: excepte were Alexander, wold wishe to be Diogenes.
But very worthely doth Plutarch rebuke it, because that so much the more he shuld haue wyshed to haue had Diogenes philosophye, howe muche the greater hys dominion was.
But muche more shameful is theyr sluggardy, whyche not onely bryng not vp their chyldre~ aright, but also corrupte them to wyckednesse.
When Crates the Thebane dyd perceiue thys abhominacion, not without a cause he wolde go in to ye hyest place of the citye, there crie out as loud as he could, caste them in the teeth wyth theyr madnesse in this wyse.
You wretches what madnesse driueth you? Take you suche thought to gette money and possessions, take you care for your children for whom you get these thynges? As they be scante halfe mothers whych onlye bringe forth, and not vp their chyldren, so be they scante halfe fathers, whith when they prouide necessaries for theyr chyldrens bodies, eue~ somuch that they maye ryot wythall, prouide not that their myndes maye be garnyshed wyth honest disciplines.
Trees per adue~ture wyl grow though eyther baren, or wyth wild fruite: horses are foled, though per+chaunce they be good for nothyng: but menne (truste me) be not borne, but fashioned.
Menne in olde tyme which by no lawes, nor good order ledde theyr lyues in woodes, in wa~+derynge lustes of bodye, were rather wylde beastes then men.
Reason maketh a man: that hathe no place where all thynges are gouer+ned after affeccion.
If shape and fa+shion shulde make a man, Images also shulde be counted among men.
Elegantly sayde Aristippus when a certen ryche man him what profite learnyng shuld brynge to a yong man: it be no more but this quod he, yt in the playing place one stone sytte not vpon an other.
Uery properly another Philosopher Di+ogenes trowe, bearynge in the myd day a candle in his hand, walked aboute the market place that was full of men: beinge axed what thynge he sought: seeke quod he, a man.
He knewe that there was a greate company, but of beastes, and not men.
The same man on a daye, when sta~ding on an hye place he had called a great together, and sayde nothing else but come hi+ther men, come hyther men.
Some halfe angrye cryed agayne: we are here men, say what thou hast.
The~ quod he: wold haue men come hy+ther not you whych are nothyng lesse then men, and therwyth draue them away wyth his staffe.
Surely it is very trewe, that a man not instructed wyth Phylosophye nor other good sciences, is a creature somewhat worse then brute beastes.
For beastes folowe onely the affectes of nature, a manne except he be fashioned wych learning, and preceptes of philosophy, is into affeccions more the~ beastlike.
For there is no beast more wylde, or more hurtefull then a manne, whom ambicion dryuethe, desyre, anger, enuye, ryot, and luste.
Therfore he that prouideth not that his sonne may by and by be instructed in the beste learnyng, neyther is he a manne, nor the sonne of a man.
Were it not an abhominable sight that the mynde of a man shulde be in a beastes body? As we haue read that when she had enchau~ted men wyth her wytchcraft, dyd turne them into Lions, beares, and swyne, so that yet ther shuld be stil in them the mynde of a man, which thyng Apuleus wrote to haue happened to hym selfe, and Austin also hathe beleued that men haue bene turned into wolues.
Who could abyde to be called the father of such a monster.
But it is a more meruey+lous monster that a beastes mynde shulde be in a mans bodye, and yet do very many please themselues in suche chyldren, and bothe the fathers seme, and the common people thynke suche to be verye wise.
It is sayde that beares caste oute a lumpe of fleshe wythout anye fashion, whych wyth longe lyckyng, they forme and brynge into a fashyon, but there is no beares yonge one so euyll fauored as a manne is, borne of a rude mynde.
Except wyth much studye yu forme and fashion this, thou shalt be a father of a monster and not of a man.
If thy sonne be borne wyth a copped head or crocke shuldred, or splay footed, or wyth syxe fingers in one hande, howe lothe woldest thou be for it, how arte thou ashamed to be called the father not of a man, but of a monster: and art thou not asha+med of so moustruous a mynde? Howe discoraged be the fathers in theyr hertes if their wyfe brynge forthe a naturall, an infante of a brute mynde? For they thynke they haue begotte~ not a man, but a mon+ster, and excepte feare of the lawe dyd let them, they wolde kyll that that is borne.
Thou blameste nature whych hath denied the minde of a man to thy chylde, thou causest by thyne own negligence, that thy sonne shulde be wythoute the mynde of a man.
But thou wylte saye: Better it is to be of a brutishe rather the~ of an vngracious mind.
Naye better it is to be a swyne, the~ an vnlearned and euyll man.
Nature, when she geueth the a sonne, she geueth nothyng else, the~ a rude lumpe of fleshe.
It is thy parte to fashio~ after ye best maner, that matter that will obey folow in euery poynt.
If thou wylt slacke to do it, thou hast a beaste: if thou take hede thou hast, as myght saye, a God.
Srayght waye assone as thy infa~te is borne, it is apte to be taughte those thynges whych properlie belonge to a man.
Therfore after the sayinge of Uyrgyll, bestowe diligente labour vpon hym, euen from hys tender age.
Handle the waxe strayght way whyle it is very soft, fashion thys claie while it is moist, season thys earthen vessel wyth verye good liquour; while it is newe, dye your wolle whyle it commeth whyte frome the fuller, and is not defiled wyth any spottes.
Antisthe+nes dyd verye merilye shewe the same, whyche when he had taken a certen mans so~ne to be taught, and was axed of hys father what thinges he had neede of: a newe booke quod he, a newe pensyle, and a new table.
Thou canst not haue a rude lumpe, but and if thou fashyon it not lyke a manne, of it selfe it wyll waxe naught, into monstruous formes of wylde
Seynge thou doest owe this seruyce to God nature, although there were no hope that thou shuldest haue any profite ther+by, count in thy mynd, how greate comforte, how greate profite, howe much worshyp the children that be well brought vp brynge to theyr fa+thers.
Agayne into what shames and greate sorowes they cast their parentes that bee euyll broughte vp.
There is no nede to bryng here vnto the examples out of olde chro+nicles: do no more but remember in thy mind the housholdes of thine owne citye, howe many examples shalt yu haue in eueri place? know thou doest often hear such wordes.
It is a matter to brynge vp chyldren well, graunt: but no man is borne to him selfe, no man borne to be idle.
Thou woldest nedes be a father, yu muste be a good father, yu haste gotten the~ to the co~mon wealth, not to thy self only, or to speake more lyke a christen man, yu hast begotte~ the~ to god, not to thy selfe.
Paul wryteth that so in dede women be saued, if they bryng forth childre~, so brynge the~ vp that they continue in ye study of vertue.
God wil straitly charge the pare~ts wt the childre~s fautes.
Ther+fore excepte yt euen forthwith thou bryng vp honestly yt, that is borne, fyrst yu dost thy selfe wronge, which thorow thy negligence, gettest yt to thy selfe, then the which no enemye could wyshe to an other, ether more greuous or paynful.
Dionisius did effeminat wt delyghtes of the court Dions yong son yt was run awaye from him: he knew yt this shuld be more carefull to ye father, then if he had kylled hym wt a swerde.
litel whyle after when the yong manne was forced of his father that was come to him, to returne agayne to his old vertue, he brake his necke out of a garret.
wise child maketh the father glad, a folish son is sorow to ye mother.
But a wyse chyld not only is pleasure to hys father, but also worship and succoure, and finallye hys fathers lyfe.
Contrarye a folyshe and leude chylde, not only bringeth hea+uynesse to hys parentes, but also shame and pouertye, and olde before the tyme: and at laste causeth death to them, of whom he had the begynnyng of lyfe.
What nede me to rehearse vp? daily are in our eies the examples of citizens, whome the euyll maners of theyr chyldre~ haue brought to beggarye, whome eyther the sonne beyng hanged, or theyr daughter an whoore of the stewes, haue tormented wyth intol+lerable shame and vylany.
know greate men, whych of manye chyldren haue scante one lefte alyue.
One consumed wyth the abhominable leprie, called by diminucion ye french pockes, beareth his death aboute wyth hym: a nother hathe burste by drynkynge for the beste game, an other goyng a whorehun+tynge in the nyghte with a visar, was pitifullye kylled.
What was the cause? Bycause theyr parentes thynkynge it inough to haue begot+ten them, and enryched them, toke no heede of theire bryngynge vp.
They shall dye by the lawe, whych laye awaye theyr children, and cast them into some wood to be deuoured of wylde beastes.
But there is no kynde of puttynge them awaye more cruell, then to geue vp that to beastlye affeccions, whych nature hath geuen to be fashioned by very good waies.
If ther wer ani witch could wyth euyl craftes, and wold go about to turne thy sonne into a swyne or a wolfe, woldest thou not thynke that ther were no punyshemente to sore for her myscheuouse deede? But that whych thou abhor+rest in her, thou of purpose doest it thy selfe.
How huge a beaste is lechery? how rauenous and insaciable is howe wylde a beast is dronken shyp? how hurtfull a thing is anger? how horrible is ambicion? To these beastes dothe he set ouer hys sonne, whosoeuer from his tender youthe doth not accustume hym to loue that, that is honeste: to abhorre synne: yea rather not on+lye he casteth hym to wyld beastes, whych the most cruel casters away are wonte to do, but also whych is more greuouse, he norisheth this greate and perilous beaste, euen to hys owne destruccion.
It is a kind of men most to be abhorred, which hurteth the body of infantes wyth bewitchyng: and what shal we say of those parentes whiche thorowe their negligence and euyll educaci+on be witch the mynd? They are cal+led murtherers that kyll their chil+dren beynge newe borne, and yet kyll but the body: great wyc+kednes is it to kyll the mynde? For what other thynge is the deathe of the soule, then foly and wickednes.
And he doth also no lesse wrong to his contrey, to whom asmuch as ly+eth in hym, he geueth a pestilente citize~.
He is naught to godwards, of whom he hath receyued a chylde for thys purpose, to brynge hym vp to vertue.
Hereby you may se, how greate and manifolde mischiefes they committe whych regarde not the bryngynge vp of tender age.
But as touched a lytle before, they synne more greuouslie then do these, whych not onely do not fashi+on them to honestye, but also season the tender and soft vessel of the infante to myschiefe and wyckednesse, and teacheth hym vyce before he knowe what vice is.
How shuld he be a modeste man and dyspyser of pride, that creepeth in purple? He can not yet sound his fyrste letters, and yet he nowe knoweth what crimosine and purple sylke meaneth, he knoweth what a mullet is, and her dayntie fyshes, and disdainfullye wyth a proude looke casteth away co~mon dyshes.
How can he be shamefast whe~ he is grow+en vp, which being a litel infa~t was begon to be fashioned to lecherye? How shall he waxe liberal whe~ he is old, which being so litel hath ler+ned to meruell at money gold? If ther be ani kynd of garment lately fou~d out, as daili ye craft, as in time paste dyd Africa, bringeth forth some new mo~ster, yt we put vp+on our infa~t.
He is taught to stand in his own co~ceite: if it be take~ a way, he angerly axeth for it again.
Howe shall he beyng olde hate dru~+kennes, whych when he is an infa~t is taught to loue wine? They teach them by lytle and lytle suche filthy wordes whych are scant to be suffe+red, as sayth Quintilian, of the delicious Alexandrians.
And if the child speake any suche after them, they kysse hym for hys laboure.
warant you they knew their yong, growynge nothynge out of kynde, when theyr owne lyfe is nothynge else then an example of naughtynes.
Beynge an infant, he learneth the vnchaste flatterynge wordes of nurses, and as we saye, he is fashio+ned wyth the hand to wanton touchynge.
He seeth hys father well whetteled wyth drynke, and heareth hym bablynge oute that, that shulde be kepte in.
He sytteth at greate, and not very honest feastes, he heareth the house ful of iesters, harpes, mynstrels and daunsers.
To these maners the chyld is so ac+custumed, that custume goeth into nature.
be that fashi+on their chyldren to fiersenesse of warre whyle they be yet redde fro~ the mother.
They lerne to loke fiers+lie, the learne to loue the swearde, and to geue a strype.
From such be+ginninges thei are deliuered to the master: and do we merueyle if wee fynde them vnapte to lerne vertue, whych haue dronke in vyces, euen wyth the mylke? But hear some men defendynge theyr folye thus, and sate that by thys pleasure whiche is taken of the wanto~nes of infantes, the tediousnes of is reco~pe~sed.
What is this? Shuld it be to the verye father more pleasaunt if the chylde folowe an euyll deede, or expresse a leude worde, the~ if wyth his lytle stutryng tonge, he spake a good sentence, or folowe any deede that is wel done? Nature specially hathe geuen to the fyrste age an easines to folowe and do after, but yet thys folowyng is some what more proue to naughtynesse then to goodnes.
Is vyce more ple+saunte to a good man then vertue, specially in hys chyldren? If anye fylthe fall vpon the yonge chyldes skyn, thou puttest it away, and dost thou infect the mynd wyth so foule spottes? Nothynge stycketh faster then that that is learned in yonge myndes.
pray you what motherlye hertes haue those women, whiche dandle in their lap their chyldren tyl they be almost seuen yeres old, and in maner make the~ fooles? If they be so much disposed to play why do they not rather get apes, and litle puppets to play wythall? saye they: they be but chyldren.
They be in deede: but it ca~ scant be told how muche those fyrste beginninges of our yong age do helpe vs to guide all our lyfe after, howe hard vntractable a wanton and dissolute bryngyng vp, maketh the chylde to the teacher, callynge the same gentlenes, when in deede it is a marring.
Might not an accion of euyl handlyng children meruelous iustli be laid against such mothers? for it is plainely a kynde of witchcraft of murther.
They be punyshed by the lawe, bewitche their childre~, or hurt their weake bodies with poisons: what do thei deserue which corrupt ye chiefe parte of the infa~t wt most vngracious venome? It is a lighter matter to kyl the bo+dy then the mind? If a child shulde be brought vp amo~g the gogle eied stutters, or haltyng, the body wold be hurt wt infeccio~: but in dede fautes of the mind vpon vs more priuely, also more quickely, settel deper.
The Paul worthi+ly gaue this honor vnto the verse of Mena~der, he wold recite it in his epistels: Euyl comunicacio~, corrup+teth good maners: but this is neuer truer the~ in infantes.
Aristotle whe~ he was axed of a certen ma~ by what meanes he myghte bringe to pas, to haue a goodly horse: If he be brought vp quod he· among horses of good kynde.
And yt if neyther loue nor reason can teach vs howe greate care we ought to take for ye first yeres of our children, at ye least waies let vs take example of brute beastes.
For it oughte not to greue vs to learne of the~ a thynge yt shall be so profitable, of whome ma~kinde now long ago hath lerned so many fruitful things: seuce a beast called Hippopotamus hath shewed ye cut+ting of veines, a bird of egipt called Ibis hath shewed ye vse of a clister, which ye phisicio~s gretly alow.
The hearbe called dictamum whiche is good to drawe out arrowes, we haue knowne it bi hartes.
Thei also haue taughte vs that the eatinge of crabs is a remedy against the poyson of spyders.
And also we haue learned by the teachyng of that dictamum doth confort vs agaynst the byting of serpentes.
For thys kynde of beastes fyghte naturally agaynste serpentes, of whom whe~ they be hurt, they haue ben espyed to fetche theyr remedye of that herbe.
Swallowes haue shewed vs salandine, and haue geuen the name vnto the hearbe.
The wesyll hathe shewed vs that rewe is good in medicines.
The Storke hathe shewed vs the herbe organye: and the wylde bores haue declared yt Iuy helpeth sickenesses.
Serpentes haue shewed that fenel is good for the eye syght.
That vomite of the stomacke is stopped by lettise, the Dragon mony sheth vs.
And that mans donge helpeth agaynst poyson, the Panthers haue taught vs, and many mo remedies we haue learned of Brute beastes: yea and also that be verye profitable for mannes lyfe.
Swine haue shewed vs the maner to plow the lande, and the Swalowe to te~per mud walles.
To be short, there is in maner nothyng profitable for the lyfe of man, but nature hathe shewed vs an example in brute beastes, that they that haue not learned philosophy and other sciences, maye be warned at the least waye by them what they shulde do. we not se howe that euery beaste, not only doth beget yonge, but also fashion them to do their natural office? The byrde is borne to flye.
Doest thou not se how he is taught therunto fashioned by his da~me? We see at home how the cattes go before their kytlynges, and exercyse them to catche myse byrdes, because they muste lyue by them.
They shewe them the praye whyle it is yet alyue, and teache them to catche it by leapyng, and at last to eate them.
What do hartes? Do they not forth wyth exercise their to swyftnes, and teach the~ howe to runne? they brynge them to hye stiepe doune places, shewe them how to leap, because by these meanes they be sure agaynste the traines of the hunters.
Ther is put in writing as it were a certen rule of techyng elepha~tes and dolphins in brynginge vp their yonge.
In Nyghtingales, we perceiue the offices of the techer and learner, how the elder goth before, calleth backe, and correcteth, and howe the yonger foloweth and obeyeth.
And as the dogge is borne to huntyng, the byrde is flyinge, the horse to runnyng, the oxe to plowynge, so man is borne to philosophy and honeste doinges: and as euery liuing thing lerneth very easly that, to the whiche he is borne, so man wyth verye lytle payne perceiueth the lernyng of vertue and honestye, to the whiche nature hath graffed certen vehemente seedes and principles: so that to the readinesse of nature, is ioyned the diligence of the teacher.
What is a greater inconuenience then beastes that be wythout reason to knowe and remember theyr duetye towarde theyr yong: Man whych is deuided from brute beastes by prerogatiue of reason, not to know what he oweth to nature, what to vertue, and what to God? And yet no kynde of brute beastes looketh for anye rewarde of theyre yong for their noursynge and teachynge, excepte we luste to that the Storkes noryshe agayne theyr da~mes for worne wyth age, and bear them vpon their backes.
But among men, because no continuaunce of time taketh awaye the thanke of naturall loue: what com+fort, what worshyp, what succoure doth he prepare for hym selfe, that seeth hys childe to be well brought vp? Nature hathe geuen into thy handes a newe falowed fielde, nothynge in it in deede, but of a fruitfull grounde: and thou thorow neg+ligence sufferest it to he ouer growen wyth bryers and thornes, whyche afterwardes can not be pulled vp wyth any diligence.
In a lytell grayne, howe greate a tree is hyd, what fruite will it geue if it spring oute.
All thys profite is except thou caste seede into the forowe, excepte thou noryshe wyth thy labour this tender plant as it groweth, and as it were make it tame by graffyng.
Thou awakest in tamyng thy pla~t, and slepeste thou in thy sonne? All the of mans felicitie standeth specially in thre poyntes: nature, good orderyng, and exercyse.
cal nature an aptnes to be taught, and a readines that is graffed within vs to honestye.
Good orderynge or teachyng, call doctryne, whiche stondeth in monicions and preceptes.
call exercyse the vse of that perfitenes which nature hath graf+fed in vs, and that reason hath furthered.
Nature requyreth good order and fashionynge: exercyse, except it be gouerned by reason, is in daunger to manye perylles and erroures.
They be greatly therefore deceiued, whych thynke it sufficie~t to be borne, no lesse do they erre whyche beleue that wysedome is got by handelynge matters and greate affayres wythoute the preceptes of philosophye.
Tel me praye you, when shall he be a good runner whych runneth lustelye in deede, but eyther runneth in the darke, or knoweth not the waye? When shall he bee a good sworde player, whych shaketh hys sworde vp and downe wynkyng? Preceptes of philosophye be as it were the eyes of the mynde, and in manner geue lyght before vs that you may see what is nedefull to be done and what not.
Longe experience of diuerse thinges profite much in dede, confesse, but to a wyse man that is diligently instructed in preceptes of well doynge.
Counte what thei haue done, and what thei haue suffered all theyr lyfe, whych haue gotten them by experience of thinges a sely small prudence thinke whether yu woldest wyshe so greate myschiues to thy sonne.
Moreouer philosophye teacheth more in one yere, then dothe anye experience in thyrty, and it teacheth safely, whe~ by experience mo men waxe miserable then prudent, in so much that the old fathers not without a cause sayde: a man to make a perill or be in ieopardy, whych assayed a thing by experience.
Go to, if a man wold haue hys sonne well seene in physycke, whether wolde he rather he shulde reade the bookes of phisicions or learne by experience what thynge wolde hurt by poysonyng, or helpe by a remedy.
Howe vnhap+pye prudence is it, when the shypman hathe learned the arte of saylynge by often shypwrackes, when the prince by continuall batayles and tumultes, and by co~mon myschieues hath learned to beare hys office? Thys is the prudence of fooles, and that is bought to dearlye, that men shulde be wyse after they be strycken wyth myschief.
He lear+neth very costely, whych by wanderyng lerneth not to wander.
Phi+lippus wyselye learned hys sonne Alexander to shewe hym selfe glad to lerne of Aristotle: and to learne philosophy perfectlye of him to the ente~t he shuld not do that he shuld repent hym of.
And yet was Phylyp for hys singuler towardnes of wytte.
What thynke ye then is to de looked for of the co~+mon sorte.
But the manner of teachinge doth briefly shewe what we shulde folowe, what wee shulde auoyde: neyther dothe it after wee haue taken hurte monyshe vs, thys came euyll to passe, hereafter take heede: but or euer ye take the matter in hande, it cryeth: If thou do thys, thou shalt get vnto the euyll name and myschiefe.
Let vs knytte therfore this threfolde corde, that both good teachyng leade nature, and exercise make perfite good tea+chyng.
Moreouer in other beastes we do perceiue that euery one doth sonest learne that that is most properly belonging to hys nature, and whych is fyrste to the sauegarde of hys healthe: and that standeth in those thynges whith brynge either payne or destruccio~.
Not onlye liuing thyngs but plantes also haue this sence.
For we se that trees also in that parte where the sea doth sauour, or the northen winde blow, to shrynke in their braunches and boughes: and where the wether is more gentle, there to spreade them farther oute.
And what is that that properly be longeth vnto man? Uerelye to lyue according to reason, and for that is called a reasonable creature, and diuided fro~ those that ca~ not speake And what is most destruccio~ to ma~? Folyshenes.
He wyll therfore be taught nothyng soner then vertue, and abhorre from nothynge sooner then folyshnesse, if so be the diligence of the parentes wyll inconti+nent set a worke the nature whyle it is emty.
But we here meruelous complantes of the common people, howe readye the nature of chyldre~ is to fal to vyce, how hard it is to drawe them to the loue of honesty.
The greatest parte of thys euyll is thorowe oure owne faute, whyche mar the wittes wt vyces, before we teache them vertues.
And it is no maruell if we haue them not verye apte to learne honestye, seyng they are nowe already taughte to myschiefe.
And who is ignoraunt, that the labour to vnteache, is both har+der, and also goth before teachyng.
Also the common sorte of men do a+mysse in thys pointe thre maner of wayes: eyther because they vtterlye neglecte the bryngynge vp of children, or because they begynne to fashion their myndes to knoweledge to late, or because they putte them to those men of whome they maye learne that that muste be vnlerned agayne.
Wee haue shewed those fyrst maner of men vnworthi to be called fathers, and that they very litle differ from suche as theyr infantes out abrode to be destroyed, and that they oughte worthely to be punyshed by the lawe, which doth prescribe this also diligentlye by what meanes chyldren shuld be brought vp, afterwards youth.
The second sorte be very ma+nye, wyth whom nowe specially entend to
The thyrd doth amysse two wayes, partly thorowe ignoraunce, partly thorowe retchlesnes.
And syth it is a rare thynge and a shame to be ignoraunte to whome thou shuldest put oute thy horse, or thy grounde to be kepte, howe muche more shamefull is it not to knowe whom thou shuldeste put thy chylde in truste wythal, be+ynge the dearest part of thy possessions? Ther thou beginnest to lerne that, that thou canst not skyll well of thy selfe, thou axest counsell of the beste seene: here thou thynkeste it maketh no matter to whom thou thy sonne.
Thou assignest to thy seruantes, eueri man his office that is metest for hym.
Thou tryest whom thou mayest make ouersear of thy husbandrie, whome to appoint to the kitchen, and who shulde ouersee thy housholde.
And if there be any good for nothynge, a slug, a dulhead, a foole, a waster, to hym we co~mit oure childe to be taught: and that thynge whych requireth the cunningest man of all, is put to ye worst of our seruauntes.
What is vntoward, if here menne haue not an vntoward mind? Ther be some whych for theyr couetous mynd be a feard to hyre a good ma+ster, and geue more to an horskeper then a teacher of the chyld.
And yet for al that they spare no costly feastes, nyght day thei playe at dice, and bestowe vpon houndes fooles.
In thys thynge onely they be sparers and nigardes, for whose cause in other thynges myght be excused.
wold ther wer fewer whych bestowe more vpon a rotten whore, then vpon bringyng vp of their chylde.
Nothyng sayth the Satir writer sta~deth the father in lesse cost then the sonne.
Peraduenture it wyll not be much amisse here to speake of ye day dyet, which longe ago was muche spoke~ of in ye name of Crates.
Alow to thy coke x. pou~d, to thy phisicion a grote, to thy flatterer .v. tale~ts, to thy cou~sel+ler smoke, to thy harlot a talent, to thy philosopher .iii. halfpe~s.
What lacketh to this preposterous count, but to put to it yt the teacher haue iii. farthings: Howbeit thinke yt the master is meant vnder ye name of philosopher.
Whe~ one that was riche in money, but of wit axed Aristippus wharwages he wold axe for teching his son, he answered .v. C. grotes.
You quod great a su~me: for wt this much money a man maye bye a seruaunce.
Then the philosopher very properly againe: but now, quod he, for one thou shalt haue two: a sonne mete to do the seruice, and a philosopher to teache thy sonne.
Further if a man shulde bee axed, whether he wold haue hys onlye sonne dead to wynne an hundred horses, if he had any of wysedome, he wold answer (I thinke:) in no wise.
Whi geuest thou then more for horse? why is he more dilige~tly take~ hede to then thy sonne? why geuest thou more for a fole, then for the bringyng vp of thy chylde? Be frugall and sparynge in other thynges, in thys poynt to be thryfty, is no sparynge but a madnes.
There be other agayn that take good heede in chosyng a master, but that is at the desyre of their friendes.
They lette passe a meere and cunninge man to reache chyldren, and take one that can no skyll, for none other cause, but that he is set forwardes at the desyres of their friendes.
Thou mad man, what meanest thou? In saylynge thou regardest not the affeccion of the~ yt speake good wordes for a man, but thou secteste hym to the helme, whych can beste skyll to gouerne the shyp: in the sonne, whe~ not only he hymself is in ieopardy, but the father and mother and all the housholde, yea and the common wealth it selfe, wylte thou vse like iudgement? Thy horse is sicke, whether wilt thou sende for a at the good worde of thy friend, or for his cu~nyng in lechcraft.
What? Is thy sonne of lesse price vnto the then thi horse? Yea settest thou lesse by thy selfe then by thy horse? This beyng a foule thynge in meane citi+zens, how much more shamefull is it in great menne? At one supper a dashynge agaynst the mischeuous rocke of dice, and so hauynge shypwrake, thei lose two hundred pou~d, and yet they saye they be coste, vpon theyr son they bestowe aboue xx. pounde.
No man can geue nature, eyther to himselfe, or to other: howbeit in this poynte also the dilige~ce of the pare~tes helpeth much.
The fyrst poynt is, that a ma~ chose to hym selfe a wyfe that is good, come of a good kynred, and well broughte vp, also of an healthfull bodie.
For seyng the kynred of the body and mynde is very knytte, it can not be but that the one thynge eyther muste be or of the other.
The nexte is, that when the dothe hys duetye to get chyldren, do it neither beyng moued wyth anger, nor yet for these go into the chylde by a secrete
ceen philosopher seemed to haue that thyng seynge a yonge man selfe not verye it is meruell quod he, but if thy father the whe~ he was Uerily thinke this also maketh greatli to the matter, if the mother at all times, but specially at ye time of concepcion and byrthe, haue her mynde free from all and be of a good co~science.
For ther can be nothyng eyther more quiet or more merye then such a mynd.
The thyrd point is yt the mother noryshe with her own brestes her infa~t, or if ther hap any necessitie that it maye not so be, let be chose~ a nurse of a wholsome body, of pure mylke, con+dicions, nether drunke~, nor brauler, nor lecherous.
For the vices that be take~ euen in ye very beginninges of lyfe, both of the bodye and of the mynd, abyde fast vntyl we be olde.
Some men also write yt it skilleth muche who be his sucking felowes who be his playfelowes.
Fourth+lye that in due season he be set to a chosen scholemaster alowed by all mens witnes, and many waies try+ed.
You must be dilige~t in chosyng, and after go thorowe with it.
Homer disaloweth wher many beare rule: and after the olde prouerbe of the grekes.
There is nothynge more vnprofitable, then often to chaunge ye master.
For by that mea+nes the web of Penelopes is woue~ vnwouen.
But haue knowen childre~, whych before they wer .xii. yere old, had more the~ .xii. masters, and that thorowe the rechelesnesse of their pare~tes.
And yet after this is done must the pare~tes be dilige~t.
They shall take heede bothe to the master to the sonne, neither shall they so caste away al care from the~ as they are wonte to laye all the charge of the doughter vpon the spouse, but the father shall oftentyme looke vpon them, and marke whether he profite, remembrynge those thynges whych the olde men spake both and wittely, that the is set before the hynder part of the head: and that nothyng sooner fatteth the horse then the masters eye, nor that no dunge maketh the ground more fruitfull then the masters footyng.
For as for the elders it is meete sometyme that they be sente far out of oure syght, whiche thing as it were a graffing, is inespecially wont to yongemens wyttes.
Emonge the excellent ver+tues of Paulus Emilius, this also is praised, that as ofte~ as he might for his busines in the co~mon welth he wolde be at the exercises of hys so~nes.
And Plinie the nepheu was contente nowe and then go into the schole for his friendes sonnes sake, whom he had taken vpon him to brynge vp in good learnynge.
Furthermore, that that wee haue spoken of nature is not to be vnder+stand one wayes.
For there is a nature of a common kynde, as the nature of a man is to vse reason.
But ther is a nature peculier, eyther to hym or him, that properly belo~geth either to thys man or that, as if a man wolde saye some menne to be borne to disciplines mathematical some to diuinitie, some to rethorike some to poetrie, and some to war.
So myghtely disposed they be and pulled to these studies, that by no meanes they canne be discoraged from them, or so greatly they abhor them, that they wyl sooner go into the fyre, then apply their mynde to a science that they hate.
knewe one familierlye whych was verye well seene both in greke and latin, and well learned in all liberall sciences, when an archbishop by he was found, had sende hither by hys letters, that he shulde begynne to heare the readers of the lawe agaynst hys nature.
After he had co~playned of this to me (for we laye both together) exhorted hym to be ruled by his patron, saying that it wold wexe more easy, that at the beginning was harde, and that at the least waye he shulde geue some part of hys tyme to that study.
After he had brought oute certen places wonderfull folyshe, which yet those professours halfe goddes dyd teache their hearers wyth greate authoritie, answered, he shuld set light by them, take out that whiche they taught well: and after had preased vpon hym wyth many argumentes, am quod he so minded, that as often as turne my selfe to these studies, me thinketh a swerde runneth thorowe my hert.
Menne that bee thus naturallye borne, thynke they be not to bee compelled against their nature, lest after the common saying we shuld leade an Oxe to wreastlynge, or an Asse to the harpe.
Peraduenture of this inclinacion you may perceiue certen markes in lytle ons.
There be that can pronosticate such thynges by the houre of hys birthe, to whose iudgemente howe muche ought to be geuen, leaue to eue+rye mans emacion.
It molde yet muche to haue espyed the same assoone as can be, we learne those thynges moste easelie, to the which nature hath made
thinke it not a very vayne thing to coniecture by ye figure of the and the behaueour of the rest of the bodie, what disposicion a man is of.
Certes Aristotle so greate a philosopher vchsaued to put oute a booke of phisiognomye verye cunnynge and well laboured.
As saylyng is more pleasaunt when wee haue bothe the wynd and the tyde, so be we soner taught those things to the whych we be inclined by redines of wyt. Uirgyll hath shewed markes wherby a man may know an oxe good for plough, or a cowe meete for generacion encrease of cattell.
He techeth by what toke~s you may espie a yong colte mete for
Sraight waye the colt of a courage tra~plethgaylie in the fieldes. &c. for you know the verses.
They are deceyued whyche beleue that nature hathe geuen vnto man no markes, whereby hys disposicio~ maye bee gathered, and they do amisse, that do not marke them that be geuen.
Albeit in my iudgemente there is scante anye discipline, but that the wyt of man is apt to lerne it, if we continue in preceptes and exercise.
For what may not a man learne, when an Eliphant maye be taught to walke vpo~ a corde, a bear to daunse, and an asse to playe the foole.
As nature therefore is in no mannes owne hande, so wee haue taught wherin by some meanes we helpe nature.
But good orde+rynge and exercise is altogether of our own witte and diligence.
How much the waye to teach doth helpe, thys specially declareth, that we se daylye, burdens to be lyft vp by and arte, whiche otherwyse coulde bee moued by no strength.
And how greatly exercise auaileth that notable saying of the old wise man, inespeciallye proueth, that he ascribeth all thynges to diligence and study.
But labour, say they, is not meete for a tender age, what readines to lerne can be in children whych yet scarse knowe that they are men: wyll answere to bothe these thinges in few wordes.
How agreeth it that that age shulde bee counted vnmeete for learnynge, whych is nowe apte to learne good maners? But as there be rudimentes of vertue, so be there also of scicences.
An horsecolt, which forthwyth sheweth his gentle kynd, is not straight way forced wyth the bytte to cary on hys backe an armed manne, but wyth easy exercises he learneth the fashion of warre.
The calfe that is appoynted to the plowghe, is not strayght wayes laden wyth werye yockes, nor prycked wyth sharpe godes, but as Uirgyl hath elegant+lye taught: Fyrst they knyt aboute his necke circles made of tender twygges, and after when his free necke hathe bene accustumed to do seruice, they make rounde hoopes mete, when they be wrythe~, ioyne a payre of meete ons together, and so cause the yonge to gooe forwardes, and often tymes they make them to draw an empty cart, and sleightly go awaye, but afterwards they set on a great heauy of beeche, and make them to draw a great plough beame of yro~. Plowmen can skyll howe to handell oxen in youthe, and attemper their exercises their strength muche more diligently ought this to be done in bringing vp our children.
Furthermore the prouide~ce of nature hath geuen vnto ons a certen mere habilitie.
An infant is not yet to whome thou shuldest reade ye offices of Cicero, or the Ethickes of Aristotle, or the moral bokes of Seneca or Plutarche, or the epistels of Paule, confesse, but yet if he do any thyng vncomly at the table, he is monyshed, and when he is monyshed, he fashioneth hym selfe to do as he is taught.
He is brought into the temple, he lerneth to bowe his kne, to holde hys handes manerly, to put of hys cap, and to fashion all the behaueour of hys bodie to worshyp God, he is co~+maunded to holde hys peace when misteries be in doyng, and to turne hys eyes to the alter.
These rudimentes of modestye and vertue the childe lerneth before he can speake, which because they sticke fast vntil he be elder, they profit somwhat to true religio~.
Ther is no differe~ce to a chyld when he is first borne, betwene his pare~tes straungers.
non after learneth to knowe his mother, after his father.
He lear+neth by litle litle to reuere~ce the~, he learneth to obey them, to loue the~.
He vnlerneth to be angrye, to be aue~ged, when he is bidde~ kysse the~ that he is a~gry withal, he doth it, vnlerneth to bable out of mea+sure.
He lerneth to rise vp, geue re+uerence to an old ma~, to put of his cap at ye image of the crucifix.
Thei that thinke yt these lytle rudime~tes help nothing to vertue, in my mind be greatly deceiued.
certe~ yonge man whe~ he was rebuked of Plato because he had plaied at dice co~plai+ned yt he was so bitterly chidde~· for so litle harme.
The~ quod Plato, although it be but smal hurt to play at dice, yet is it great hurt to vse it.
As it is therefore a greate euyll to accustume thy selfe to euyl, so to vse thy selfe to small good thynges is a greate good.
And that tender age is so muche the more apte to learne these thyngs, because of it selfe it is plyaunt vnto all fashions, because it is not yet occupyed wyth vyce, and is glad to folowe, if you shewe it to do any thinge.
And as co~monlye it accustumeth it selfe to vyce, or euer it vnderstand what vyce is, so wyth lyke easynes maye it be ac+custumed to vertue.
And it is beste to vse best thinges euen at the fyrst.
That fashion wyll endure longe, to the which you make the empty and tender mynde.
Horace wrote that if you thruste oute nature wyth a forke, yet wyll it styll come againe.
He wrot it and that very truly, but he wrote it of an olde tre. Therfore the wise husband man wil straight waye fashion the plante after that maner whyche he wyll haue tarye for euer when it is a tree.
It wyll soone turne in to nature, that you powre in fyrste of all.
Claye if it be to moyste wyl not kepe the fashion that is prynted in it: the waxe may be so softe that nothynge can bee made of it.
But scarse is there any age so tender that is not able to re+ceyue learnyng.
No age sayth Seneca, is to late to learne: whether that be true or no wot not, surely elderly age is very harde to learne some thyngs.
This is doutles, that no age is so yonge but it is apte to be taught, inespecially those thynges vnto the whych nature hathe made vs, for as sayd: for thys pur+pose she hath geuen a certen peculi+er desyre of folowyng, that what so euer they haue herde or seene, they desyre to do the lyke, and reioyse when they thynke they can do any thyng: a man wolde saye they wer apes.
And of thys ryseth the fyrste coniecture of their wyt and aptnes to be taughte.
Therefore assone as the man chyld is borne, anone be is apte to lerne maners.
After whe~ he hath begon to speake, he is mete to be taught letters.
Of what thynge regarde is fyrste to be had, a readines by by is geuen to lerne it.
For learnyng although it haue infinite commodities, yet excepte it wayte vpon vertue, it bryngeth more harme then good.
was refused of wyse menne theire sentence, which thought that children vnder seuen yere olde shulde not be set to lernyng: and of thys sayinge manye beleued Hesiodus to be the author, albeit Aristophanes the gra+marian sayd, that those morall pre+ceptes in the whych worke it was written, were not made by Hesiodus Yet nedes must he be some excelle~t wryter, which put forth such a booke that euen learned menne thought it to be of Hesiodus doing But in case it were Hesiodus, with out doute yet no mans authoritie oughte to be of suche force vnto vs, that we shulde not folowe the better if it bee shewed vs. Howebeit who soeuer wer of thys mynd, they meant not thys, that all thys time vntyll seuen yeres shulde bee quite voyde of teachyng, but that before that tyme chyldren shulde not bee troubled wyth the laboure of studies, in the whych certeine tediousnes muste bee deuoured, as of cannyng wythout booke, sayinge the lesson agayn, and wyth wrytinge it, for scant maye a man fynde anye that hathe so apte a wytie to bee taught, so tractable and that so wil folowe, whyche wyll accustume it selfe to these thynges wythout pric+kyng forward.
Chrisippus apoynted thre yeres to the not that in the meane space there shuld be no teachynge of manners, and speach, but that the infame shulde be prepared by fayr meanes to lern vertue and letters, ether of the nur+ses, or of the parentes, whose maners wythout peradue~ture do help very much to the good of chyldren.
And because the fyrste teachyng of chyldren is, to speake playnly and wythout faute, in this afore tyme the nourses and the parentes helpe not a lytle.
Thys begynnyng, not only very muche pro+fiteth to eloque~ce, but also to iudge+ment, and to the knowledge of all disciplines: for the ignoraunce of tonges, eyther hath marred all the sciences, or greatly hurt the~, eue~ diuinitie it selfe also, phisicke law.
The eloquence of the Gracchians was muche merueyled at in tyme paste, but for the most they myghte thanke theyr mother Cornelia for it, as Tullie iudgeth.
It apeareth sayth he, that the chyldren wer not so much brought vp in the mothers lappe, as in the mothers co~munica+cion.
So theyr fyrste scholyng was to them the mothers lap.
Lelia also expressed in her goodly talke the eloquence of her father Caius.
While she was yet yonge she was dyed wyth her fathers communicacion, euen when she was borne in his armes.
The same happened to the two sisters, Mucia and Licinia, neeces vnto Caius.
Specially is praysed the ele+gance of Licinia in speakyng, whiche was the daughter of Lucius Crassus, one wyfe as weene.
What nedes many words? All the house and all the kynred euen to the nepheus, and their cosyns dyd often expresse elegance of their fore fathers in artificiall and cunnyng speakyng.
The daughter of Quintus Hortencius so expressed her fathers eloquence, that ther was longe ago an oracion of hers to se, that she made before the officers called Triumuiri, not only (as Fabius sayth) to the prayse of womankynd.
To speake without fa no litle helpe also the nourses, tutors, and playe felowes.
For as touching the tonges, so great is the readines of that age to learne them, that wythin a few monethes a chylde of Germany maye learne Frenche, and that whyle he dothe other thinges also: neyther dothe that thynge come euer better to passe then in rude and verye yonge yeres.
And if this come to passe in a barbarous and vnruled tonge, whych wryteth otherwyse then it speaketh, and the whych hathe hys schriches and wordes scarse of a man, howe muche more easely wyl it be done in the Greeke or Latine tonge? Kyng Mithridates is read to haue perfitly knowen .xxii. tonges, so that he could plead the lawe to euery nacion in their owne tonges wythoute anye interpreter.
The mistocles within a yeres space lerned perfitely the Persians tong because he wolde the better co~men wyth the kyng.
If su~what old age can do that, what is to be hoped for of a chylde? And all this businesse standeth specially in two thynges, memorye, and imitacion.
We haue shewed before alredy that there is a certein naturall greate desyre in chyldren to folowe other, and very wyse men wryte that memorie in chyldren is verye sure in holdinge faste: and if we distrust their autho+ritie, experience it selfe wyll proue it vnto vs. Those thynges that we haue seene beyng chyldren, they so abide in our mindes, as though we had sene them yesterdaie.
Thinges that we read to day whe~ we be old, wythin two daies after if we read the~ agayn they seme newe vnto vs. Furthermore howe fewe haue we seene whych haue had good successe in lernynge the tonges when they were olde? And if some haue wel spedde them in knoweledge, yet the right sound and pronunciacion hath chaunsed either to none, or to very few.
Neyther for thys muste we call chyldren to lerne the tonges after sixtene yere olde, because that the elder Cato lerned la+tine, and Greeke, when he was thre score and ten yeres olde.
But Cato of Utica muche better lerned then the other and more eloquent, when he was a chylde was continuallye wyth hys master Sarpedo.
And here we ought so much the more to take heede, because that yonge age led rather by sense then iudgeme~t, wyll assone or peraduenture soner lerne leudnes things yt be naught Yea we forget soner good thinges the~ naught.
Gentile philosophers espyed that, merueyled at it, and could not search out the cause, whiche christe~ philosophers haue shew+ed vnto vs: which telleth yt this redines to mischiefe is setteled in vs of Adam the first father of ma~kind.
Thys thynge as it can not be false, so is it very true, that the greateste parte of this euyll co~meth of leude and naughty bryngyng vp, inespeciallye of tender youthe, whyche is plyeable to euerye thynge.
We fynd in writyng that great Alexander lerned certeine fautes of hys master Leonides, whyche he could not leaue when he was well growe~ and a great Emperour.
Therfore as long as amonge the la+tines floryshed that olde vertuousnes of good maners, chyldren were not committed to an hyrelynge to be taught, but were taughte of the parentes them selues their kinsfolke, as of their vncles both by father and mother, of the graundfathers, as Plutarch sayth: For they thought it especially perteyned to the honour of their kynred, if they had very manye excellentlye well seene in liberall knowledge, where as now adayes all nobilitie almost sta~deth in grauen armes, dauncing, huntynge, and dicynge.
Spurius Carbilius of a bond man made free, whose patrone Carbilius brought in the fyrste example of diuorce, is reported to be the fyrste that taught an ope~ gra~mer schole.
Before thys tyme it was counted a verye vertuous office if euery ma~ taughte hys kynsefolke in vertue and lernyng.
Nowe is thys theyr onlye care, to seeke for their chyld a wyfe wyth a good dowrye.
That done, they thynke they haue done all that belongeth to a father.
But as the world is alwayes redy to be worse and worse, day nnes hathe perswaded vs to this office to a tuter that is one of our householde, and a gentleman is put to be taught of a seruaunte.
In whyche thynge in deede, if we wolde take heede whom we chose, the ieopardy were so muche the lesse, because the teacher liued not only in ye fathers syght, but also wer vnder hys pow+er if he dyd amysse.
They that wer very wyse, either bought lerned ser+uauntes, or prouided they myghte be lerned, that they myghte be teachers to their children.
But howe muche wyser were it, if the parents wolde get lernyng for thys entent, that they them selues myght teach theyr owne chyldren.
Uerelye by thys meanes the profite wolde be double, as the co~moditie is double if the Byshoppe shewe hym selfe a good man, to the entente he maye encourage very many to the loue of vertue.
Thou wylt saye: euerye me~ hath not leasure, and they be lothe to take so greate payne.
But go to good syr, Lette vs caste wyth oure selfe howe muche tyme wee lose at dice, bankertynge, and beholdynge gaye syghtes, and playinge wyth fooles, and weene wee shall bee ashamed to saye wee lacke leasure to that thynge whych oughte to be done, all other set asyde.
We haue tyme sufficiente to do all we shulde do, if we bestowe it so thriftelye as we shulde do.
But the daye is short to vs, whe~ we lose the greater part thereof.
Consider thys also, howe greate a porcion of tyme is geuen now and then to the busines of our friendes.
If we can not do as they all wolde haue vs, verelye wee oughte chiefely to regarde our chyldren.
What payne refuse we to leaue vnto oure chyldren a ryche patrimonye and well stablished: and to get that for them whiche is better then all this, shulde it yrke vs to take laboure? namelye when naturall loue and the profite of them whyche be mooste neareste vnto vs, maketh sweete al the grief and payne.
If that were not, when wolde the mothers beare so longe tediousenes of chyldbyrth and nur+syng.
He loueth his sonne lyghtlye whych is greued to teache hym.
But the manner to enstructe them was the more easy to them in olde tyme, because the learned and vnlearned people spake all one tong, saue that the learned spake more truelye, more elegantly, more wiselye, and more
confesse that, and it were a very shorte way to learnynge, if it were so nowe a dayes.
And there haue bene some that haue gone aboute to renewe and brynge again those olde exam+ples, and to doo as those olde fathers haue done afore tyme, as in Phrisia, Canterians, in Spayne Queene Elisabeth the wyfe of Far+dinandus, oute of whose familye there haue come forthe verye manye womenne bothe merueylouselye well learned and verteouse.
Emong the englishe men, it greued not the ryght worshypful Thomas More, although beyng much occupyed in the kynges matters, to be a teacher to hys wyfe, daughters, and sonne, fyrste in vertue, and after to knowledge of Greke and La+tine.
Uerely this ought to be done in those that we haue apoynted to learnynge.
Neyther is there anye ieopardie that they shulde be ignoraunt in the peoples tonge, for thei shall learne that whether they wyl or not by companye of men.
And if there be none in oure house that is lerned, anon we shulde prouide for some cunnyng man, but tryed both in maners and lernyng.
It is a folyshe thyng to make a profe in thy sonne, as in a slaue of litle value, whether hys teacher be learned or not, and whether he bee a good man that thou haste gotten hym or not.
In other thinges pardon may be geuen to negligence, but here thou muste haue as manye eyes as Argus had, and muste be as vigilant as is possible.
They say: a man maye not twyse do a faute in war: here it is not laweful to do once amisse.
Moreouer the soner the child shall be set to a master, so much shal hys brynginge vp come the better to passe.
knowe some men fynde thys excuse, that it is ieopardy lest the labour of studies make ye good health of the tender bodye weaker.
Here myght ensure, yt althoughe the strength of the bodye wer sumwhat taken awaye, that thys inco~moditie is well recompensed by so goodly gyftes of the mynd.
For we fashion not a wrestler, but a philosopher, a gouernour of the common wealth, to who~ it is sufficient to be healthful, although he haue not the strengthe of Milo: yet do co~fesse that somewhat we must tender the age, that it maye waxe the more lu+stye.
But there be manye that foolyshely do feare leste their chyldren shulde catche harme by learnynge, whych yet feare not the much grea+ter that cometh of to muche meate, whereby the wyttes of the litle ons no lesse be hurted then bee theyr bodyes by kyndes of meates and drynkes that be not meete for that age.
They brynge theyr lytle children to great and longe feastes, yea feastyng sometyme vntyl farre forth nyghtes, they fyl them wyth salt and hoat meates, somtyme eue~ tyl thei vomite.
They bynde in and loade the tender bodies wyth vnhandsome garmentes to set them out, as some trym apes, in mans ap+parel, and otherwayes they weaken their children, and they neuer more tenderlye be afrayed of their health, then when co~municacion is begon to be had of lernynge, that is of that thynge whych of al other is moste wholesom and necessarye.
That whych we haue spoken touchyng health, that same perteineth to the care of hys bewety, whyche as confesse is not to be lyght set bye, so to carefully to be regarded, is not very meete for a man.
Neyther do we more weywardlye fear any other thyng then the hurt of it to come by studie, where it is hurt a greate deale more by surfet, dronkennes, vntymelye watchynge, by fyghtyng and woundes, finally by vngracious pockes, which scarse a+nie man escapeth that liueth intem+peratly.
From these thyngs rather let the~ see they keepe their children then fro~ lernyng, whych so carefully take thought for the health and bewtie.
Howbeit thys also may be prouided for by our care dilige~ce that ther shuld be very litle labour and litle losse.
This shal be if neyther many thyngs, neither euery lyght thynge be taught them when they be yong, but the best only that be mete for their age, whi+che is delighted rather in pleasau~t thynges then in subtile.
Secondly, a fayre manoure of teachynge shall cause yt it may seme rather a playe then a labour, for here the age must be beguiled with sweete flattering wordes, which yet ca~ not tell what fruit, what honour, what pleasure lernyng shall brynge vnto them in tyme to come.
And this partly shal be done by the teachers ge~tlenes, curteous behaueour, partlye by his wit subtile practise, wherbi he shal deuise diuerse prety meanes to make lerning plesau~t to ye chylde, pul hym away fro~ feling of labour.
For there is nothynge worse then when the waywardnes of the master causeth the children to hate ler+nyng before they knowe wherefore it shulde be loued.
The fyrst degree of lerning, is the loue of the master.
In processe of tyme it shall come to passe that the chyld whych fyrst be+gan to loue lernyng for the masters sake, afterwards shall loue the master because of lernyng.
For as many giftes are very dere vnto vs eue~ for thys cause, that they come from them whome wee loue hertelye: so lernyng, to whom it can not yet be pleasaunt thorowe discrescion, yet to them it is acceptable for the loue they beare to the teacher.
It was very wellspoken of Isocrates that he lerneth very much, whych is desirous of lernyng.
But some be of so vnpleasaunt maners that they can not bee loued, no not of their wyues, theyr countenau~ce lowryng, their companye currishe, they seme angrye euen when they be bestepleased, they can not speke fayre, scarse can they laughe when men laugh vpon them, a man wold saye they were borne in an angrye hour.
These men iudge scant wor+thye to whome we shulde put wylde horses to be broken, muche lesse wuld thynke that thys tender and almost suckynge age shuld be committed to them.
Yet be ther some that thynke that these kynde of men, euen inespecyally worthye to be set to teache yonge chyldren, whylest they thynke their sturdynes in lookynge is holynes.
But it is not good trustyng the lookes, vn+der that frownynge face lurke ofte~ tymes most vnchaste and maners, neyther is to be spoken amonge honeste men, to what shame+fulnes these vouchers abuse chyldren by fearyng them.
No nor the parentes the~selues can well bring vp theyr chyldre~, if they be no more but feared.
The fyrste care is to be beloued, by lytle and lytle foloweth after, not feare, but a certen liberall and gentle reuerence which is more of value then feare.
Howe properly then praye you be those chyldren prouided for, which being yet scante foure yere olde are sente to schole, where an vnknow+en scholemaster, rude of manners, not verye sober, and sometyme not well in hys wytte, often lunatike, or hauynge the fallyng sycknes, or frenche pockes? For there is none so vyle, so naughte, so wretched, whome the common people thynketh not sufficiente ynoughe to teache a grammer schole.
And thei thynkyng they haue gotten a king+dome, it is marueyle to howe they set vp the brystels because thei haue rule, not vpon beastes, as sayeth Terence, but vpo~ that age whiche ought to be cheryshed wyth all gentlenes.
You wolde saye it were not a schole, but a tormentynge place: nothynge is hearde there beside the flappynge vpon the hande, beside yorkynge of roddes, besyde howlynge and sobbinge and cruell threatnynges.
What other thynge maye chyldren learne hereof, then to hate learnyng? When this hate+red hath once setteled in the tender myndes· yea when they be old they abhorre studye.
It is also muche more foolyshe, that some men sende their lytle chyldren to a pynyshe dronken woman to learne to reade and wryte.
It is agaynste nature that women shulde haue rule vpon menne: besyde that, nothynge is more cruell then that kynde, if they bee moued with anger, as it wyll soone be, and wyll not cease tyll it be full reuenged.
Monasteries also, and colleges of brethern, for so they cal themselues, seeke for their liuynge hereof, and in theyr darke corners teache the ignoraunt chyldren commenlye by menne that be but a lytle learned, or rather leudlye learned, althoughe we graunte they bee bothe wyse and honeste.
Thys kynde of teachynge howe so euer other menne alowe it, by my counsell no manne shall vse it, who soeuer entendeth to haue hys child well brought vp.
It behoueth that eyther there were no schole, or else to haue it openlye abrode.
It is a shorte waye in dede that co~monlye is vsed: for manye be compelled of one more easelye by feare, that one broughte vp of one liberallye.
But it is no great thynge to beare rule vpon Asses or Swyne, but to brynge vp chyldren liberallye as it is veri hard, so is it a goodly thing.
It is tiranny to oppresse citizens by feare, to keepe them in good order, by loue, moderacion and prudence, it is princely.
Diogenes beynge taken of the Agenites, and brought oute to be solde, the cryer axed hym by what title he wolde be set out to the byer.
Axe quod he if any wyl bye a man that can rule chyldren.
One that hadde chyldren at home communed wyth the philosopher, whether he could do in deede that he professed.
By shorte commu+nicacion he perceyued he was not of the co~mon sorte, but vnder a pore cloke, ther was hydden great wise+dome: he bought hym, and brought hym home, put his chyldre~ to him to be taught.
As ye Scots say, ther be no greater beaters then frenche scholemasters.
When they be tolde thereof, they be wonte to answere, that that nacio~ euen lyke the Phrigians is not ame~ded but bi stripes.
Yet graunt that there is some difference in the nacion, but much more in the propertie of euerye seuer al wyt.
Some you shal soner kyl, then amende wyth stripes: but the same in loue and gentle mo+nicions you may leade whither ye wyll.
Truth it is that of thys disposicion my selfe was when was a childe, and when my master whych loued me aboue all other, be+cause he sayd he conceiued a certen great hope of me, toke more heede, watched me well, and at laste to proue howe could abyde the rod, and laying a faute vnto my charge which neuer thought of, did bear me, that thinge so put awaye from me all the loue of studie, and so discouraged my chyldyshe mynd, that for sorowe hadde almost consumed awaye, and in deede folowed therof a quartaine
When at laste he had perceiued hys faute, among his friendes he bewailed it.
This wyt (quod he) had almoste destroyed before knewe it.
For he was a man both wyttye and well learned, and as thynke, a good ma~.
Here nowe (good syr) co~iecture me howe many frowarde wyttes these vnlerned greate beaters do destroye, yet proud in their owne conceite of learnyng, wayeward, dronken, cruel, and that wyl beate for their pleasure: them selues of suche a cruell nature, that they take plesure of other mens tor+mentes.
These kynde of men shuld haue ben or hangme~, not teachers of youth.
Neyther do any torment chyldren more cruelly, the~ they that canne not teache them.
What shulde thei do in scholes but passe the daye in chydyng and beatynge? knewe a diuine and that familierly, a man of greate name, whych was neuer satisfied wyth crudelity against his scholers, whe~ he him selfe had masters that were very great beaters.
He thought yt dyd much helpe to caste downe the fiersnes of their wittes, tame the wa~tonnes of their youth.
He neuer feasted amonge hys flocke, but as Comedies be wont to haue a mery endyng, so contrary when they had eaten theyr meat, one or other was haled oute to be beaten wyth roddes: and sometime he raged against them that had deserued nothynge, euen because shuld be accustumed to stripes.
my selfe on a time stode nexte hym, when after diner he called out a boie as he was wo~t to do, as trow ten yere olde.
And he was but newe come frome hys mother into that compani· He told vs before that the chyld had a very good woman to hys mother, and was earnestly committed of her vn+to hym: anon to haue an occacion to beate hym, he beganne to laye to hys charge wotte not what wa~tonnesse: When the chylde shew+ed hym selfe to haue nothyng lesse, and beckened to hym to whome he committed the chyefe rule of hys colledge, surnamed of the thynge, a tormentoure, to beate, hym ne by and by caste doune the chylde, and beate hym as thoughe he had done sacrilege.
The diuine sayde once or twyse, it is inoughe, it is inoughe· But that tormentour deaffe with feruentnes, made no ende of his bo+chery, tyl the chylde was almost in a sounde: Anon the diuine to vs, he hathe deserued nothynge quod he, but that he muste be made lowe.
Who euer after that maner hath taught hys slaue, or hys Asse? horse is better tamed with puping of the mouth or softe handlyng, then wyth whyp or spurres.
And if you handle hym hard, he wil whynche, he wyll kycke, he wyll byte, and go bacwardes.
An oxe if you pricke hym to harde wyth godes, wyl caste of his yocke, and run vpon hym that pricked hym.
So muste a gentle nature be handled as is the whelpe of a Lion.
Onlye arte tameth Elephantes, not violence, neyther is there any beaste so wylde, but that it wyl be tamed by gentlenes, neyther any so tame, but immoderate cruelnes wil anger it.
It is a seruyle thynge to be chastened by feare, and common custume calleth chyldren free men, because liberall and gentle bringyng vp be+commeth them, much vnlike to seruile.
Yet they that be wyse do thys rather, that seruauntes by gentelnes and benefites leaue of their sla+uyshe condicions: reme~bryng that they also be men, and not beastes.
There be rehearsed meruelous examples of seruaunts toward their masters, whome verely they shulde not haue founde such if they hadde kept them vnder only by strypes.
seruaunt if he be corrigible is bet+ter amended by monicions, by honestie, good turnes, then by stripes: if he be paste amendemente, he is hardened to extreme mischief and eyther wyll runne awaye and rob hys master, or by some craft go aboute his masters deathe.
Sometime he is reuenged on his masters crueltie, thoughe it coste hym his lyfe.
And there is no creature more fereful the~ man, who~ cruell iniurie hathe taught to dispyse his owne lyfe.
Therfore the commo~ prouerb that sayth a man hath as manye enemies as he hath seruauntes, If it be true, thynke it may be chief+ly imputed to the vnreasonablenes of the master: for it is a poynte of arte, and not of chaunce to rule wel seruauntes.
And if the wyser masters go aboute thys thynge, so to vse their seruauntes, that thei shuld serue them well and gently, and in stede of seruantes had rather haue them fre men, how shameful is it bi bryngyng vp, to make seruantes of those that be gentle and free by na+ture? Not wythout cause dothe the olde manne in the comedie thynke that there is greate difference betwixte a master and a father.
The master only compelleth, the father by honestie and gentelnes accustumeth sonne, to do well of hys owne mynde, rather then by feare of an other: and that he shulde bee all one in hys presence and behind hys backe.
He that can not do this sayth he, lette hym confesse that he can not rule chyldren.
But there oughte to be a litle more difference betwyxte a father and the master, then betwixt a kinge and a tirant.
Wee putte awaye a tiraunte from the common wealthe and we chose tirauntes, yea for oure sonnes, eyther we oure selfes exercyse tirannye vpon them.

You fathers saythe he, prouoke not your chyldren to anger, but bring them vp in discipline and chastisyng of the Lorde.
And what the discipline of the lorde is, he shal soone se that wyll consider, wyth what gentlenes, what meekenes, what charitie the Lord Iesus hath taught, suffered, and noryshed and brought vp by litle and lytle his dis+ciples.
The lawes of man do temper the fathers power: the same also permit vnto the seruauntes an accion of euyll handlyng, and from whence then commeth thys crueltye amonge christen men? In time paste one Auxon a knight of Rome, whylest he wente about to amende hys sonne by beatynge hym vnmesurably, he kylled him.
That crueltye so moued the people, that the fathers and chyldren haled hym in to the market place, al to be hym, thrust him in wyth theyr wrytyng pinnes, nothynge regarding the dignitie of his knighthod, and Octauus Augustus had much a do to saue hym. but now a daies howe many Auxons do we see whi+che thorowe cruell beatynge, the chyldrens healthe, make them one eyed, weaken them, and sometyme kyll them.

Then this tormentour began fyrst to complayne, he wrote to hys father to take awaye hys sonne as sone as could be, and that he had be+stowed as much phisicke vpon him as he coulde, but in vayne vpon the chylde that was paste remedye.

He that played thys playe was a chylde borne to all myschiefe, whiche by other vngracious deedes afterwardes, made men beleue the ether to be true that were done before.
And he was nephewe by the systers syde to this mad docter: eue~ then playing a part before to thyngs whych souldiers are wont to do in bataile or robbynge.
At an hostes house of his, he pulled oute the faucet, and let the wyne runne vpo~ the ground, and as one to shew a pleasure, he sayde that he felt the sauour of the wyne: wyth an other of hys felowes he daylye played at the sworde, not in sporte, but in ear+nest, that euen then you myght wel perceyue he wolde be a thyefe or a murtherer, or whych is very lyke to them, that he wolde be an hyred souldier.

For he had for that other a good rewarde: and he was of this sorte of gospellers, to whom nothing is more swete then monei.
His godfather was made surely to beleue that the child was wt a good and diligent master, when in deede he dwelte wyth a boucher, was continually in company, and made drudge with a man that was halfe mad, and continually sicke.
Thus fauoringe more his kynseman then hym by whom he had so much profite, the suspicion was layde vpon the harmeles, to whom they ascribed so muche malice that he wolde teare and defile his owne garmentes to auoide suspicion if any suche thyng had bene done.

He shall shewe, that that whyche the grekes cal proboscida, or his snout, the latines call his hande, because wyth that he reacheth hys meate.
He shall tell hym that that beaste doth not take breath at the mouthe as we do, but at the snoute: he hath teth standyng out on bothe sides, and they be iuory, which rich me~ set much price by, and therwith shal shew hym an iuory combe.
Afterwardes he shall declare that in Iude ther be dragons as greate as they.
And that dragon is bothe a greke worde and a latine also, saue that the grekes saye dracontes in the genitiue case.
He shall shewe that naturallie betwyxte the dragons and the Elephantes is great fyghte.
And if the chylde be somewhat gredy of learnynge, he maye rehearse manye other thynges of the nature of Elephantes and dragons.

Continuaunce hurteth not so it be mesurable, spi+ced also wyth varietie and plesau~tnes.
Finally if these thynges be so taught, that imaginacio~ of labour be awaye, and that the chylde do thynk al thinges be done in playe.
Here the course of our talkyng put+teth vs in reme~braunce briefely to shewe by what meanes it maye be brought to passe that lernyng shuld waxe swete vnto the chylde, which before we somwhat touched.
To be able to speake redely, as told you is easely gotten by vse.
After thys co~meth the care to reade and write of it selfe is somwhat tedious, but the griefe is taken awaye a great parte by the cu~nyng handling of the master, if it be sauced wt some pleasaunt aliurementes.
For you shall fynde some whych tarye long and take great paine in know+yng ioynynge their letters in those fyrst rudime~tes of grammer, whe~ they wyl quyckely lerne greater thyngs.
The yrkeso~nes of these thinges must be holpe~ by some pretie craft, of the which ye old fathers haue shewed certe~ fashions.
Some haue made the letters in sweete crustes and cakes that chyldren loue well, so in manner they myghte eate vp their letters.
When they tell the letters name, they geue the letter it selfe for a rewarde.
Other haue made the fashi+on of iuorie, that the chylde shulde playe wyth them, or if there were a+ny other thyng wherin that age is specially delited.
The englyshe me~ delyte principally in shotynge, and teache it their chyldren fyrst of all: wherfore a certen father that had a good quicke wyt perceiuinge his sonne to haue a greate pleasure in shotyng, bought hym a prety bowe very fayr arrowes, in al partes both of hys bowe arrowes were letters painted.
Afterwards in sted of markes, he set vp the fashio~ of let+ters, fyrste of Greke, and after of late~: when he hyt, tolde the name of the letter, besyde a greate reioysinge, he had for a reward a cherye, or some other thynge that chyldre~ delyte in.
Of that playe commeth more fruite, if two or thre matches playe together.
For then the hope of victorie and feare of rebuke maketh them to take more heede, and to be more chereful.
By thys deuise it was broughte aboute that the chylde wythin a fewe dayes playynge, had perfitely lerned to know sound all hys letters whych ye co~mo~ sort of teachers be scarse able to brynge to passe in thre whole yeres wyth their threatyngs, and brawlynges.
Yet do not alowe the diligence of some to pain+ful, whych drawe out these thyngs by playinge at chesses or dyce.
For when the playes them selues passe the capacitie of chyldren, how shal they lerne the letters by them? This is not to helpe the chyldrens wyttes, but to put one labour to an other.
As there be certen engins so full of worke and so curious, that they hynder the doynge of the busines.
Of thys sorte commonly be all those thynges whych some haue de+uised of the arte of memorye for to gette money, or for a vayne boastynge, rather then for profite: for they do rather hurte the memorye.
The best crafte for memorie, is tho+rowlye to vnderstande, and then to brynge into an order, last of al ofte~ to that thou woldest remem+ber.
And in litleous there is a natu+ral great desyre to haue the mastry inespecially of suche as be of lustye courage, and lyuely towardnes.
The teacher shall abuse these incli+nacions to the profite of hys study.
If he shall profite nothing by pray+ers, and fayre meanes, neyther by gyftes mete for chyldren, nor prayses, he shal make a contencion with hys equales.
Hys felowe shall be praysed in the prese~ce of the duller.
Desyre to be as good shall quicken forwards, whom only adhortacion coulde not do.
Yet it is not meete so to geue the mastrie to the victor, as thoughe he shulde haue it for euer: but somtime he shall shewe hope to hym that is ouercome, that by takyng hede he may recouer ye shame: whych thynge capteynes be wonte to dooe in batayle.
And sometyme we shall suffer that the chyld shuld thynke he hadde gotten the better, when he is worse in deede· Finally by enterchaungyng, prayse and disprayse, he shall noryshe in them, as Hesiodus sayth, a stryfe who shall do best.
Perchaunce one of a sadde wyt wyl be loth so to play the child among chyldren.
And yet the same is not greued, neyther yet ashamed to spende a greate parte of the day in playing wyth litle puppies and marinesettes, or to babble wyth a pie or or to play the foole wyth a foole.
By these tryfles, a verye sadde matter is broughte to passe, and it is meruell that good men haue litle pleasure herein, seeyng ye natural loue of our children, and hope of great profit is wunt to make those thynges also pleasau~te, whyche of them selues be sharpe, sowre and bytter.
confesse that the preceptes of grammer be at the beginnynge somewhat sowre, and more necessary then pleasant.
But the handsomnes of the teacher shal take from them also a greate parte of the payne.
But nowe wyth what compasses, and hardenesse be chyldren troubeled whyle they learne wythout the booke the names of the letters before they knowe what manner letters they bee? Whyle they be compelled in the de+clinynge of nownes and verbes to can by toote in howe manye cases, moodes and tenses one worde is put: as muse in the genetiue and da+tiue singuler, the nominatiue and vocatiue plurel? Legeris of legor, and of legerim, and legero? What a beatyng is the~ in the schole, whe~ chyldren be axed these thynges? Some light teachers to boast their lernynge are wonte of purpose to make these thynges somewhat har+der.
Whyche faute maketh the beginnynges almost of all sciences in doute, and paynfull, specially in logicke.
And if you shewe them a bet+ter waye, they answere they were brought vp after thys fashion, and wyll not suffer that anye chyldren shulde be in better case, then they them selues were when they were chyldren.
All difficultye eyther therfore muste be auoided, whyche is not necessarye, or that is vsed oute of tyme.
It is made softe and easy, that is done whe~ it shuld be.
But when tyme is, that of neces+sitie an harde doute muste be learned, than a cunnynge teacher of a childe shall studye as muche as he may to folowe the good and frendlye Phisicians, whych whan they shall gyue a bytter medicyne do anoynt, as Lucrecius saith, the brim+mes of their cuppes with honye, that the chylde entised by pleasure of the swetenes shuld not feare the wholesome bytternes, or else put su+ger into ye medicine it selfe, or some other swete sauoryng thynge.
Yea they wyl not be knowen that it is a medicine, for the only imaginaci+on sometyme maketh vs quake for feare.
Finally thys tediousenes is sone ouercome, if things be taught them not to much at once, but by ly+tle and litle, and at sundrie times.
Howebeit we ought not to distrust to much chyldrens strength, if perhaps they muste take some paines.
chyld is not myghty in strength of bodye, but he is stronge to continue, and in abilitie strong inough.
He is not myghty as a bull, but he is strong as an emet.
Euerye thyng is mighty in that, to the whyche nature hathe made hym.
Do we not se tender chyldren tu~ne merueylouse swyftlye all the daye long, and feele no werinesse.
What is the cause? Because playe is fitte for that age, and they imagine it a playe and no labour.
And in euerye thynge the gretest part of payne is imaginacion, whych somtyme maketh vs feele harme, when there is no harme at all.
Therefore seynge that the prouidence of nature hath taken awaye imaginacion of laboure frome chyldren, And howe muche they lacke in strengthe, so muche they be holpen in thys part, that is, that they feele not labour, It shal be the masters parte, as we sayde before, to put away the same by as many wayes as he can, and of purpose to make a playe of it.
There be also certen kindes of spor+tes meete for chyldren, wherwyth theyr earnest studye must somwhat be eased after they be come to that, they muste lerne those higher thynges whyche can not be perceiued wythoute diligence and laboure: as are the handling of Themes, to turne latine into Greeke, or greeke into latine, or to learne cosmographie wythout booke.
But moste of all shall profite, if the chylde accustume to loue and reuerence hys master, to loue and make muche of learnyng, to feace rebuke, and delyght in prayse.
There remayneth one doute, wonte to be obiected by those whych saye: The profite that the chylde gerteth in those thre or foure yeres to be so lytle, that it is not worthe the laboure, eyther to take so muche payne in teachynge, or bestowe so much coste.
And these in dede seme vnto me, not so muche to care for to profite the chyldren, as for the sparyng of theyr money, or the teachers labour.
But wyl saye he is no father, whyche when the matter is of teaching his child, taketh so greate care for expenses.
Also it is a folyshe pitie, to thintent the master shuld saue his labour, to make his sonne lose certen yeres.
graunt it to be true in dede ye Fabius sayth, yt more good is done in .i. yere after, then in those .iii. or .iiii. why shuld we set light by this litle yt is won in a thyng far more precious.
Let vs graunt that it is but a very lytle, yet were it better the chylde to do it, then eyther nothyng at al, or lerne somewhat that after muste be vnlerned.
Wyth what businesse shall that age be better occupied as sone as he beginneth to speake, whi+che in no wyse can be vnoccupied? Also how lytle soeuer it be that the former age doth bringe, yet shal the chylde lerne greater thynges, euen in the same yeres, when smaller shuld haue ben lerned, if he had not lerned them before.
Thys sayth Fa+bius, euery yere furthered and increased profiteth to a great summe and as much tyme as is taken before in the infancie, is gotten to the elder age.
It nedeth not to rehearse that in those first yeres certen thinges be easely lerned, which be more hard to be lerned whe~ we be elder.
For it is very easely lerned, that is lerned in time conueniente.
Let vs graunt that they be small and litle thynges, so we confesse them to be necessarye.
Yet to me in deede it semeth not so litle a furtheraunce to lerning to haue gotten though not a perfit knowledge, yet at the least waye a taste of bothe the tongues, besydes so many vocables and names of thinges, and finally to haue begun to be able to reade and write pro~ptly.
It greueth vs not in thinges much more vile, to gette all the vauntage we can, be it neuer so lytle.
diligente marchaunt setteth not light bi winning of a farthing, thinkyng thus in hys mynde: it is in dede of it selfe but a litle, but it groweth to a summe, and a litle often put to a lytle, wyll quyckelye make a great heape.
The Smithes ryse before daye, to wyn as it were parte of the day.
Husband men vpon the holy daye do some thynges at home, to make an ende of more worke the other dayes.
And do we regarde as nothyng the losse of .iiii yeres in oure chyldren, when there is nothyng more costly then tyme, nor no possession better the~ lerning? It is neuer lerned tymely inoughe that neuer is
For we muste euer learne as longe as we lyue.
And in other thyngs the lucre that is loste by maye be recouered by diligence.
Time whe~ it is once flowen awaye (and it flyeth awaye very quickely) may be called againe by no inchauntmentes.
For the poets do trifle whyche tell of a fountayne, wherby olde men do as it were yong agayne: and the phisicions deceiue you, whych promise a gay floryshyng youth to old men thorowe a certeyn folishe essence wote not what.
Here therfore we ought to be verye sparyng, because the losse of tyme may by no meanes be recouered.
Beside this the fyrst part of our lyfe is cou~+ted to be best, and therfore shuld be bestowed more warelye.
Hesiodus aloweth not sparynge, neyther at the hyest, nor at the lowest, because when the tunne is full it semeth to hasty, and to late when it is spente: and therefore byddeth vs spare in the myddes.
But of tyme we muste nowher cast away the sparing, and if we shuld spare when the tunne is ful for thys cause that wyne is best in the myddest, then shulde we most of all saue our yonge yeres, because it is the best parte of the life, if you exercise it, but yet yt goeth swyftest awaye.
The husbande manne if he be anye thynge diligente, wyll not suffer anye parte of hys lande to lye vacante, and that that is not meete to brynge forthe corne, he set+teth it eyther wyth yonge graffes, or leaueth it for pasture, or storeth it wyth potte hearbes.
And shall we suffer the beste parte of our lyfe to passe awaye wyth oute all fruite of lerning? Newe falowed ground must be wyth some fruit+full thynge, leste beynge vntylled, it brynge forthe of it selfe naughty cockle.
Lykewyse the tender mynde of the infante, except it bee strayghte wayes occupyed wyth fruitefull teachynges, it wyl be ouercoued wyth vyce.
An earthen potte wyll keepe longe the sauoure of the liquore that it is fyrste seasoned wyth, and it wyll be long or it go out.
But as for an earthen vessell beynge newe and emptye, you maye keepe it for what liquore ye wyll.
The mynde eyther bryngeth forth good fruite, if you caste into it good seede, or if ye regard it not, it is fylled wyth naughtines, whych after+wardes must be pulled vp.
And not a litle hath he wonne whych hathe escaped the losse, neyther hathe he brought small helpe to vertue, whiche hath excluded vyce.
But what nede many wordes? Wylt thou see howe muche it auayleth, whether one be brought vp in learnynge or not? Beholde how excellently lerned in the olde tyme men were in their youth, and how in oure daies they that be aged be hable to do no+thyng in studie? Ouide beyng a verye yonge man wrot hys verses of loue.
What olde man is hable to do lyke? What maner of man Lucane was in hys youthe hys workes declare.
Howe came Because that beynge but .vi. moneths old he was brought to Rome, strayght waie deliuered to be taught of two the best gramarians, Palemo~, and Cornutus.
Hys companions in stu+dye were Saleius Bassus, and Aulus Persius: that one excellente in historye, that other in a Satyre.
Doubtles hereof came that most perfite knoweledge that he had in all the seuen sciences, his so marueylous eloquence, that in verse he was both an excellente oratoure, also a Poet.
In thys our time ther wa~teth not exemples of good bringing vp (although thei be veri few) yt as wel in wome~ as me~.
And what is more marueylous tha~ Ursinus a childe of .xii. yeres olde? for the reme~braunce of him, he also in a very eliga~te epistle put in eternall memorye.
How sewe men shal you nowe fynd, whiche at one time be able to endite two epistles to so manye notaries, that the se~tence in euerye one do agree, and that there shoulde happen no inconuenience speache.
That chylde did it in fyue epistles gaue the argumentes wtout any study, was not prepared afore ha~d to do it.
Some men when they se these things, thinking that thei passe al mens strength, ascribe it to witchcraft.
It is done in dede by witchcrafte, but it is an effectual enchau~ting, to be set in time to a learned, good, and vigilant master.
It is a stronge medicine to learne the best things of learned men, and emonge the learned.
By such wytchcrafte Alexander the greate, whan he was a yonge man, besides eloquence, was perfit in al the parts of Philosophie, and except the loue of warres, swetenes to raygne had quite raught away his inclinatio~, he might haue bene counted the chiefe among the beste Philosophers.
By the same meanes Caius Cesar beinge but a yonge man, was so eloquent wel sene in the mathematical sciences.
So well sene also were many Emperors: Marcus Tullius· also Uir+gil, and Horace in their youth were so excellent in learninge and Eloquence, all bycause they were strayght waye in their tender age learned of their parentes nourses the elogancy of the tonges, and of the beste maisters the liberal sciences: as Poetry, Rhetorique, Histories, the knowledge of antiquities, Arithmetique, Geographye, Philosophye, moral and political.
And what do we you? wee kepe out children at home till they be past fourtene or fiftene yere old, and whan they be corrupted wyth idlenes, ryot, delicatenes, with muche worke at the laste we sende them to the co~men scholes.
There to further ye matter wel, they taste a little grammer: after, whan they can declyne words, ioyne the adiectiue and the substa~tiue togither, they haue learned al the grammer, and tha~ be set to that troubled Logike, wher they must forget againe if they haue learned to speake anie thynge well.
But more vnhappye was the tyme whan was a child whiche al to vexed the youth with modes of and other folyshe questions, teching nothinge els then to speake folishelye.
Uerely those masters bicause they wold not be thought to teach folish thinges, darckened grammer wyth of Logike and euen for this verelye, that afterwardes they shold returne back+wardelye to learne grammer, they were olde, whiche we see happeneth nowe to some diuines that be wyser, that after so manye hye degrees and all their titles, wherby they maye be ignoraunte in nothing, they be faine to come againe to those bookes, whiche are wonte to be reade vnto children.
blame the~ not, for it is better to lerne late then neuer, that thing which is necessary to be knowen.
Good Lorde what a world was that, whan wyth greate boastynge Iohn Garlandes verses wer read to yonge men, and that with longe and painefull commentaries? wha~ a greate parte of tyme was consumed in folyshe verses· in saying the~ to other, repetynge them, and hearynge theim agayne? whan Florista and Florius were learned with+out booke? for as for Alexander, thynke him worthye to be receiued amonge the meaner sorte.
Moreouer howe muche tyme was loste in Sophistrye, and in the superfluous mases of Logyke? And bicause will not be to longe, howe troublesomelye were all sciences taughte? howe paynefullye? whiles euerye reader to auaunce him selfe, wolde euen straighte waye in the begynninge stuffe in the hardest thynges of all, and sometyme verye folyshe thyngs to.
For a thyng is not therfore goodly bycause it is harde, as to stand a far of, and to caste a mustarde seede thorowe a nedles eye misse not, it is hard in dede, but it is a verye trifle: and to vndo a payre of tariers, it is much worke, but yet a vayne and idle subtiltye.
Adde here vnto, that oftentymes these thynges be taught of vnlearned men, and that is worse, of lewd learned men, somtyme also of sluggardes and vnthriftes, which more regarde takynge of money tha~ the profite of their scholers.
Wha~ the commune bryngynge vp is suche, yet do wee maruayle that fewe be perfitly learned before they be old.
The beste parte of oure lyfe is loste wyth idlenes, with vices, wherewith whan we be infected, we giue a litle parte of our tyme to studies, and a greate parte to feastes and plaies.
And to an yll matter is taken as euil a craftes manne, either teachynge that is folyshe, or that whiche must be vnlearned againe.
And after this we make our excuse that the age is weake, the wyt not yet apte to learne, the profite to be verye small, and manye other thinges, whan in dede the fault is to be ascribed to euill brynginge vp.
wil not trouble you any le~ger, onelie wil speake to your wisdome whyche is in other thynges verye sharpe and quycke of syght.
Consider howe deare a possession youre sonne is, howe diuerse a thynge it is and a matter of muche worke to come by learnynge, and how noble also the same is, what a redines is in all childrens wyttes to learne, what agilitie is in the mynd of ma~ howe easily those thynges be learned whyche be beste and agreable to nature, inespeciallye if they be taught of learned and gentle by the waye of playe: further how fast those thynges abide with vs, wherewt we season fyrste of all the emptye and rude myndes, whiche thynges an elder age boeth more hardelye, and soner forgetteth: Beside thys how dear and the losse neuer recouered, tyme is, howe much it auayleth to begin in seaso~, and to learne euery thyng whan it shold be, how much continuaunce is able to do, howe greately the heape that Hesiodus speaketh of, doeth increase by puttinge to little and litle, how swiftly the time flieth away, how youth wyll alwayes occupied, howe vnapte olde age is to be taught: If thou consyder these thynges thou wilt neuer suffer that thi litle child shoulde passe away (I wil not say) seuen yere but not so much as thre dayes, in the whiche he maye be eyther prepared or instructed to learnynge though the profit be neuer so litle.

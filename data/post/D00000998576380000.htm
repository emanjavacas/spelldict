description of all kindes of Haukes that are in vse, and theyr properties.
The reclayming, imping, mevving, and fleyng, both the fielde and riuer of the same Haukes.
Their diseases and cures, and all suche speciall points as in any vvise appertaine to that most excellent and Gentlemanlike qualitie.
Also a littell treatise translated out of the Italian tongue, touchyng the diseases happening to Spaniels, vvith their cures.
To the right Honourable, my verie good Lord, Ambrose, Earle of Warwicke, Baron Lisle, Maister of hir Maiesties Ordinance, Knight of the most honourable order of the Garter, and of hir highnesse priuie Counsell: George Turberuile wisheth encrease of honoure, with all good fortune.
RIght Honorable, if a man oughte of dutie to offer gretest reco~pence where he lies most deeply indetted, and that all seruices are due to those, from whome we receyue our only countenance and ayde: Truly of force then must yeeld all my endeuours and seruice to your Honour, and my good Ladie Warwike, (the duetie reserued to my great Lorde and Master) towardes the requitall of the least part of your Honourable goodnesse, whome haue euer though know and confesse farre to base for your worthie mind and calling: yet for that it best fitteth a melancholike heade, surcharged with pensiue and sullen humors, my earnest sute must be for good acceptance at your honors hands, and withall, to craue that it may boldly passe vnder the shielde and safetie of your garde, the better to brooke the hatefull encounter of swelling enuy, a common foe to such, as either seeke by well doing, to win good will from equals, or by painful writing, to purchase prayse from Peeres.
The deuice is none of mine, but a collection out of sundry Authors, aswell Italians, as French, from whom haue gathered some chiefe points of Falconrie, to pleasure my Country men withall: In part for that neuer found hitherto any booke treating of the same matter, in part, bicause know sundry Gentlemen (my great friends) deeply addicted to that commendable sport of hawking, whom if may find as gratefull, as haue framed my selfe painfull, haue the hoped hire of my trauell, and they assured to bestowe no more on mee for my forepassed industrie, than they are to receiue fro~ me for their after curtesie.
So as there doth rest no more vpon my hands at this time, but to intreat your Honor to bestow your good liking, and lawful fauour vpon it, and me: For which as haue alwayes beene by desert bounde, so will by franke good will, rest most ready to the expence of my dutiful seruice vpon your noble line and house, during the remainder of my life: wishing vnto your Honor, and my verye good Ladie, (Ladie Countesse Warwicke) all good successe and fortune, with maintenance and encrease of your Honorable state and present felicitie.
Deeme that no man doubts, but games and al our chiefe delights, VVere first deuisde to dau~t the dumps of pe~siue payned sprights.
To cleare the clowds of drowping cares, and mists of mournful mind, And banish bale, that heauy harts in cheerlesse chaines did bind.
And more than that, to further health, by mouing to and froe, That in our lumpish lustlesse limmes, no dire disease might groe: VVhich otherwise (set sport aside, and sweete delightfull glee) In idle bodies breedes of force, as we by proofe do see, Not much vnlike the standing lakes, in durtie dampish groundes, VVhere water hath no power to passe, most noisome filth aboundes.
If games were thus found out at first, for minde and bodies ease, Aswell to quit that one of griefes, as th' other of disease: VVhy then? of force it follow must, that those delights are chiefe, And most to be imbraste, that lend to either part reliefe.
VVhich if be so, neede not blush; or deeme it my disgrace, If Hawkes and Spanels preferre, and set in hiest place.
For truly no deuise delights, the minde of man so much, No game so gladsome to the limmes, there is no pleasure such, No Phisicke fitter to remoue the dregges of direfull paine, And to restore to former life, the feeble force againe.
Of Spanels first meane to speake, for they begin the glee, VVho being once vncoupled, when they feele their collers free, In roysting wise about they raunge, with cheerfull chappes to ground, To see where in the champion may, some lurking fowle be found.
sport to vew them stirre their sternes, in hunting to and fro, And to beholde how nature doth hir power in Spanels sho: VVho scoure the fields with wo~drous skil, and deale in cunning sort, As though indeed they had conspirde, to make their master sport.
VVhat merier musicke can you craue? what note but halfe so good? As when the Spanels crosse the ronne, of Feasants in the wood? Or light vpon the little Poutes, where they haue lately bene? Assuredly no better glee, is either heard or seene.
So as by Hawkes doth pleasure grow, vnto the gazing eie, And dogges delight the listning eares, before the hawkes do flie.
VVhat dolt so dull but takes delight, when once the Spanell springs The fearfull fowle, and when the hawke lies long vpon hir wings? VVhat sense so sad, what minde so mazde, but settes his sorowes by, VVhen once the Falcon free begins, to scud amid the skie? To turne and winde a birde by sleight, and eke at last to slay VVith strong encounter, doues and duckes, and euery other pray? The pretty Partridge, Rayles and Quayles, that haunt the open field? And from hir mountey to enforce the Hearon haught to yeeld? By binding with hir close in cloudes, in maner out of sight? For noble Peeres and cheefest States, a passing pleasant flight? So small a birde, so large a fowle, at such a loftie gate, To reach and rappe, and force to fall, it is a game of state.
No fellow to the flight at Brooke, that game is full of glee, It is a sport the stowping of, a roysting Hawke to see.
And if she misse, to marke hir how she then gettes vp amaine, For best aduauntage, to eneaw the springing fowle againe.
VVho if be landed as it ought, then is it sure to die.
Or if she slippe, a ioy to see, the Hawke at randon flie, And so for head to slea the fowle, a noble sport to vew, In my conceyt no pleasure like to Hawkes, tell you trew.
It settes the senses all to worke, there may none idle bee, The tung it lures, the legges they leape, the eie beholdes the glee: The eares are busied eke to heare, the calling Spanels quest, Do tell me then what sense it is, that respite hath to rest? And more than that, the hart it leapes, and laughes for ioy to think How such a slender hawke should cause, so huge a fowle to shrink.
This kinde of sport doth banish vice, and vile deuises quight, VVhen other games do foster faults, and breede but base delight.
No idle thought can harbor well within the Falconers braine, For though his sportes right pleasant be, yet are they mixt with paine.
The toile he takes to find the fowle, his greedy lust to slay, The fowle once found cuts off co~ceits, driues il thoughts away.
He lures, he leapes, he calles, he cries, he ioyes, he waxeth sad, and frames his moode, according as his hawke doth well or bad.
Dame Venus harbors not in holtes, no Cupide haunts the hilles, Diana dwelles in open place, with bow hir game she killes.
In wooddes no wanton Goddesse woonnes: in Cities soiournes sinne, There vice in vawts dungeon dwelles, the lecher lurks within.
Dianas traine doth loue the laundes, they long abrode to rome, But bawdie Venus ympes embrace, the loitring life at home.
To dice, to daunce, to coll, to kisse, to carde the time away, To prate, to prancke, to bowle, to bowse, and ripple out the day.
To checke at Chesse, to heaue at Maw, at Macke to passe the time, At Coses, or at Saunt to sit, or set their rest at Prime.
Both Ticktacke and the Irish game, are sportes but made to spende, wote not I, to what auaile those trifling games do tende, Vnlesse to force a man to chaufe, to chide, to sweate, to sweare, To brawle, to ban, to cursse, and God in thousand parts to teare.
At cockepit some their pleasures place, to wager wealth away, VVhere Falkners only force the fields, to heare their spanels bay.
VVhat greater glee can man desire, than by his cunning skill, So to reclaime a haggarde hawke, as she the fowle shall kill.
To make and man hir in such sort, as tossing out a traine, Or but the lewre, when she is at large, to whoup hir in againe? VVhere birds, beasts, ech thing else, their fredom so embrace, As let them loose, they will be thralde no more in any case.
VVhat finer feate than so to ympe a feather, as in vew, man would sweare it were the olde, and not set on anew? VVhen hawkes are hurt and broosde, by rash encounter in the skies, VVhat better skill, than for their harmes a powder to deuise, To drie the bloud within the bulcke, and make his Mummie so, As no Phisition greater Arte, on pacients can bestow? To cure the crampe, and eke the cray, the stone that lies within, The Philanders, the Frounce, the Goute, the Panthas, the pin, The Rie, the Rhewme, the Canker, and both lice and mytes to marre, And all such wormes, as with your hawks do wage co~tinual war: To make hir mewe when time requires, to bowse and eke to bath.
By cunning skill to cause hir cast, such glit as breedes hir skath.
To cut hir hoodes, to shape hir gesse, hir tyrets, and hir line, VVith Belles, and Bewets, Veruels eke, to make the Falcon fine: Beleue me is no common skill, no bare or base deuise, But meet, for ciuill courtly men, that are reputed wise.
VVhich if be so, then yeelde me thankes, that beate my busie brow, And tooke this toile for thine auaile, to teach thee when how To worke this practise and deuice.
Accept the Printers paine, VVho shewes thee sundry shapes of hawks, though litle to his gain.
Both he and can do no more, than offer our good will, And all to further thy delight, and adde vnto thy skill.
VVhich if we do, we haue the hire, of both our meanings than, You cannot do a better deede than thanke the painfull man.
The Induction or proeme to this discourse, and treatise of Hawking.
WE find this a generall rule and obseruation, and doe holde it for good, in all Artes and Sciences, wherein men do trauell and busie them selues, eyther to the benefite of others, or to their owne pryuate pleasure, and humores, in the beginning of their workes to lay downe the subiecte of that whereof they meane to treate, whiche in verie deede is nothing else, but the ground and matter which doth moue them to write: which doth not only fall out in all liberall sciences, and studies greatly accompted and reuerenced of the learned of all ages, but also in the base and grosser trades of men, dayly practised with the hande.
As when the Goldsmithe doth determine with him selfe by curious and cunning arte, to fashion a Iewell of any price and value, he is driuen to make choyce of his mettall, either golde or siluer, whereon to bestowe the excellencie of his arte, which cannot be named by a more fit or conuenient terme, than to be called the Subiecte of his science.
Likewise here myne Author, in this treatise, and booke of Falconrie, following the accustomed order of the learned, and common practise of such as doe write, hath layde downe a Hawke, the Subiect of his deuise, of which he is determined at large to speake, with full shewe and declaration of the true nature and properties of all Hawkes, as also such other matter as is incident, and appertayning in any respecte to that skill, of all other gentlemanly sportes and practises, the most pleasant and commendable.
But before he doth aduenture too deale specially of any matter concerning Falconrie, to giue the Reader a perfite and absolute vnderstanding, both of his conceite, and of the knowledge of the thing, hee thinketh it not besides his purpose, but a matter most necessarie to the attaynment of his deuise, to frame a generall diuision of all Hawkes and Birdes of praye, racking (as it were) and deuiding that one entyre and generall name of a Hawke into many members and partes, the better thereby to display the true nature, qualitie, and condition of a Hawke, as also the skill of Falconrie: for the whole being layde out into his members and partes, it shall bee the more easie to come to the notyce of that, whereof he is resolued to write, whose nature and substance is included in his particular members.
Wherfore myne Author following that order and prescribed rule of knowledge, hath vsed this methode, setting downe to the viewe of the reader, in the verie entrie and proeme of his worke, a manifest and generall diuision of Hawkes, the better to decypher the speciall nature, of eache one Hawke in his own proper kynd, which otherwise were verie hard to do, by meane of confusion of sundrie names and termes, as also, the number of byrdes of praye.
generall diuision of Hawkes, and Birdes of praie, after the opinion of one Francesco Sforzino Vycentino, an Italyan Gentleman Falconer.
First (sayth hee) you shall vnderstand, that of Hawkes, that doe liue by praye, and are in knowledge and vse of men, there are nyne kindes.
This Hawke whome terme a Matagasse, after the French is in the Italian tounge, called, Regestola Falconera, and among the Germa~s, Thornkretzera, Hawke not in vse with vs, and in trouth of sle~der regard and estimation in nature.
Yet neuerthelesse, both to followe myne Author, and to make my diuision perfect, holde it needefull to recken that kynde of Hawke among the rest: and in the latter ende of the first part of this treatise, will briefly describe you his nature, which is no lesse base than straunge.
You must note, that all these kynde of Hawkes, haue their Tyercelles, whiche are the male byrdes and cockes of euerie sorte and gender: And further, that the female of all byrdes of praye and rauyne, is euer more huge than the male, more ventrous, hardie, and watchfull, but of suche byrdes as do not liue by rauyne and pray, the male is more large than the female.
MOreouer, you shall know, that those nyne sortes of hawkes, may againe be deuided into two kyndes, and eyther differing from the other in condition.
For some of them do pray vpon the foule, by stouping down from their winges, and so seazing on the foule with their foote, doe breake in sunder with their beakes, the necke bone, beeing of more force and strength in that part, than in the foote or talons.
And this sorte of Hawkes, do neuer vse to plume or tyre vppon the foul whom they haue seazed, vntill such time as they perceiue it to leaue busking and bating in the foote: of which kynde and qualitie are, The Egle. The Mylyon.
Nowe that other sort which speake of, do slay their praye and game by mayne force of wing, at randon and before head, not stowping at all from their wings, as the other hawkes doe, whom made mention of before.
And these hawkes haue their chiefe force and strength in the foote, and not in the beake, and therefore no soner do seaze vpon the pray, but presently they giue them selues to plume and tyre thereon.
Thus farre haue made a generall diuision of all kyndes of Hawkes that do liue by pray, againe (as you see) haue deuided those kynds into two partes.
Wherefore nowe do purpose to deale more specially in the matter, and more particularly to proceede to the natures of euerie of them, to yeelde you a more perfect knowledge, and light therein.
AL Hawkes and byrdes of pray, be comprysed, and included, vnder these two names.
Aetos. or, Hierax. which is to say, Aquila. or, Accipiter.
These two kindes doe serue to flye the praye, for mans pleasure and pastime, of which only hawkes, my purpose is to treate and speake in this discourse here following.
For all hawkes and byrdes of praye, do not serue the Falconers vse, but onely such as are hardie and free of mettall, able to flye the fielde and ryuer.
And therefore those onely kyndes shall be the Subiect of my booke, and not those base, bastardly refuse hawkes, which are somewhat in name, and nothing in deede.
As the Greekes would, that Hierax, the Latyns that Accipiter, which is a speciall terme to one hawke and byrde of pray, shoulde giue the generall name and title to all Hawkes and byrdes of praye, bycause of his excellencie: So in like manner, the Frenchmen of our age, haue ordained that the Falcon, which is a terme peculiar and proper to one kinde of byrde of praye, shall giue generall name and appellation to all hawkes, and byrdes of praye, what so euer they bee, bycause the Falcon doth passe all other hawkes in boldnesse and curtesie, and is most familiar to man, of all other byrdes of praye.
And thereof it proceedeth, that we say, the Falcon Gentle, the Haggart Falcon, the Falcon Sacre, and so likewise of the other hawkes, calling them all by the name of Falcon.
Moreouer, as the Falcon, whiche is a speciall name of one kynd of hawkes, hath giuen name to all other hawkes and birds of praye.
So hath it bestowed the name and tytle of a Falconer, to euerie one of what state or calling soeuer hee bee, that doth deale with any kinde of Hawkes: and the terme of Falconrie, to the arte, profession, and knowledge of luring and manning those byrdes of praye, by which singular skyll, they are made to flee all other foules, as well those foules of ayre, as of the lande and ryuer.
Whiche in my conceite, deserueth no slender commendation and prayse, being a matter almost quite against the lawes of nature and kynde, for one foule so artificially to vndertake and so cruelly to murther another, and hauing atchieued his enterprise, with greedie and willing minde, to repaire to man againe, hauing the whole scope of the heauens, and the circuite of the earth at their pleasure to range and peruse: and to yeelde them selues in such franke maner to the pryson and custodie of man, being by kinde set free and at libertie to praye, and dispose them selues.
Suche and so great is the singular skill of man, when by arte he is resolued, to alter the prescribed order of nature, which by industrie and payne we see is brought to passe and effect.
HAuing deuided all those byrdes of praye and rauine, whiche serue to Falconrie Hawking, into Eagles and Falcons, mean first of al to decypher you the Eagle and Vulture, whom some haue thought to be comprised vnder the kynd of an Eagle.
And so consequently after that, to speake of Falcons which are byrdes of pray, seruing to the vse and mysterie of Hawking, and taking their names of the Falcon.
Aristotle was of opinion, that there was sixe kynds of Eagles, which are named by him, according as it pleased the inhabitantes of Greece to enforme him.
Plinie in making the same deuision of Eagles, hath varied in that poynt altogether from Aristotle, as touching the names and termes of Eagles, for that they were of diuers countries, and did write in seuerall languages.
But for that meane in this booke onely to speake of those kyndes of Eagles which serue to Falconrie, will deale but with two sortes of Eagles, for at these dayes we haue the vse and experience but of the browne Eagle, whiche is the Eagle Royall, and the blacke Eagle, the other kyndes being of a base and slender courage, as no Falconer will payne him selfe to lure them, or manne them for vse or pleasure.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of brown or yellow eagle] THe brown or yellow Egle after Aristotles opinion is called in Greeke Guyseon, which doth signifie in the Frenche tong (kindly no bastard borne) bicause it is of all other kynds of Eagles the true right Eagle, he doth cal him by ye greeke word Chrisaitos, by reason of his golde~ mayle, in Latin he is termed Stellaris, and Herodus.
This is that Eagle whome we call the Egle royall, king of byrdes, and sometimes the byrde of Iupiter, and that Egle, which ought to be taken and accompted the principall best, being more huge and large than the rest, and besides more rare and daintie to be seene.
For shee doth haunt moste commonlye the toppes of highe and craggie mountaines, and doth there praye vpon all sortes of foules, as also Hares, Kyddes Gotes, and such other like wilde, and sauage beastes of the field.
This Eagle dothe liue alwayes solitarie and alone, vnlesse happily she haue hir broode with hir, whome she doth conducte and guyde from place to place, the better to instruct them howe to kyll their praye, and feede them selues.
But no soner hath she made the~ perfit, and throughly scooled them therin, but presently she chaseth them out of that coaste, and doth abandon them the place where they were eyred, and will in no wise brooke them to abide neare hir, to the ende (that the countrey where she discloseth) and maketh her Eyrie, bee not vnfurnished of conuenient pray, which by the number and excessiue store of Eagles, might otherwise be spoyled and made bare.
For it is verie likely, that if hir broode and increase should there make stay, beeing so huge byrdes, and of so great rauyne, there woulde in short space lacke praye for hir selfe, and by meane thereof breede hir to a farther euill and mischiefe: for the auoyding of whiche, this prouident and carefull foule doth presently force hir broode to depart into some other part and region.
This Egle maye with ease be discerned from the Vulture, bycause this Eagle Royall, being browne or yellowe maylde, hath not hir armes or feete in any co~dition couered with plume, as the Vulture hath.
True it is, that the arme of the Eagle is short, yellow mayld all beset with scales, the pounces large, her beake blacke, long, and crooked at the toppe.
The trayne of the Egle Royall, as also the trayne of the slender blacke Egle, is short and stiffe at the poynt, euen as the traine of the Vulture is.
The Egle is alwayes of one self hugenesse, in respect of hir nature, and it can not be said, in that she is an Eagle, that she is either larger or lesser, at any one time or other, vnlesse you will giue hir the surname and addition of blacke, yellowe, or some other such proper name and terme, which doth alter hir according to hir accydentes, but nothing at all in regarde of hir substance and nature.
And were it not that she is so massy a foule, and not portable on the fiste (as in troth she is exceeding huge) and besides, it is so harde and difficulte a matter, to prouide hir pray and foode, Princes, and puissant states, would more vsually haue hir, and hawke with hir, for their solace and pleasure, than they nowe doe.
But by reason she is so huge and ventrous, she might happily offer force and violence to the eyes and face of hir keper, if at any time she should conceiue displeasure against him.
And for this cause in chiefe, the Egle is not in vse, as other meaner hawkes and of lesse force be in these dayes.
He that will haue the Egle to be good and tractable, muste deuise to take her an Eyesse in the Eyrie, mannyng and accustoming hir among houndes and greyhoundes, to the end that when he goeth and addresseth him to the fielde, the Egle soaring aloft ouer the houndes starting the game, Foxe, Hare, Gote, or such like beastes of the wood, shee making hir downeco~me, and stouping from hir wings, may so stay and seaze vpon the game, vntill the dogges come in and procure the fall thereof.
man may feede hir with any kynde of flesh, and chiefly of such game and praye as she slayeth in the fielde by flight.
Tawnye, or browne mayle in an Eagle, deepe and hollow eyes, specially if she be bred in the weast partes of the worlde, is an assured signe of hir goodnesse: for the tawnye Egle is euer founde good in proofe.
Also the whitnesse on the head of an Eagle, or on hir backe, is a singular token of an excellent Eagle.
That Eagle, that when she fleeth from the fiste of hir keeper will either flee vpon the man, soaring round about him, or light on the grounde, and take the stand, is by al probabilitie and coniecture, no inwarde Eagle, but a fugitiue, and a rangler.
At what time the Egle, displayes hir trayne in hir flight, and makes a turne in hir mountie, it is a verie great signe that shee determineth to flye on head and gadde: the nexte remedie for which mischiefe is to throwe hir out hir meate, and lure hir with as loude a voyce as you possible may.
And if it be so that she then stoupe not to that which is caste out vnto hir, then eyther hath she ouer gorged hir selfe, or otherwise she is to hye and too full of fleshe.
meane to auoyde this inconuenience, is to sowe the feathers of hir trayne together, to the end she may not spread them abroade, nor vse the benefite of hir trayne feathers in hir flight.
Or else another way is, to deplume and make bare hir tuell and fundament so as it may appeare, and then certainely for feare of the colde ayre she will not aduenture to mounte so hie: but feeling hir trayne feathers fast sowed together, she will stande in awe of other Eagles, whome by the meane of that deuice and practise, she shall in no wise be able to auoyde.
When the Eagle maketh a short turne vpon hir keeper in hir flight, and flyeth not out aforehead, that is one principal good token that she will not away.
It hath beene sayde, that an Eagle is of force to arest and cause a woulfe to stay, and will take him, with the ayde and assistance of dogges, making into hir rescue, and that it hath bene seene and experimented.
But for my part finde the oddes of them so great, as leaue the beliefe of it to the reader, not recyting it as a troth, but a thing written, to shewe the great hardinesse and vndaunted nature of the Eagle.
It is reported that the men of the countrey where the Eagle eyreth, knowing thereof, and intending to bereaue hir young broode, doe arme and well furnish their heades, for feare least the Eagle doe offer them force and violence.
And if so they shewe the old breeder one of hir chickens, or tye it to the bough of a tree neare the place where she buildeth, she will call and cause the damme to repayre thether by continuall cleping, who findeth hir, and pitying hir cryes, will bring it so much prouision and praye, as he that commeth to take hir from the eyrie, shall there dayly be sped of as muche fleshe and prouision as will verie reasonably serue him and sixe others.
For the olde Eagle will conuey thyther Hares, Conies, foules, and such other like vittell, and viandes, for the supplye of hir necessitie.
The Eagle doth not commonly vse to praye neare vnto his eyrie, but to kyll hir prouision abroade as farre off as she maye.
And if so it happen, she leaue any fleshe after she is full gorged, that doth she reserue carefully for the nexte day, to the ende that if foule weather should happily growe to hinder hir flight, yet she might be stored of sufficient praye for the daye following, without any further trauell.
An Eagle doth not forsake or chaunge hir Eyrie all hir life time, but of custome doth yearely returne and make repayre to one self place, and there buildeth most assuredly, by meane where of it hath ben noted and obserued in time past, that an Egle doth lyue verie many yeares.
Before hir olde age, hir beake waxeth so exceeding long and croked at the toppe, as she is much hindered thereby of hir feeding: in sort as she dyeth not of disease or by extremetie of age, but only by reason she can not possible vse the benefite of hir beake, being accrewde and growne to such an exceeding length and disproportion.
Aquilae senectus the age of an Eagle, which is properly applyed to men that do lyue only by drinke, as olde men are wont to do.
The Eagle doth euer wage warre with the little Roytelet, whome the Frenche men doe so terme, for that this foule is thought to be a little king among byrdes, as the Etimologie of the worde doth seeme to importe, the Latines likewise they call him Regulus, and the Germans a Goldhenlyne.
The occasion and chiefe grounde of this controuersie betwixte the Eagle and the Goldhenlyne, is (by the report of Aristotle onely vpon the name, for that she is called the king of birdes, of which title and preheminence the Eagle would willingly bereaue hir. Againe there is one other kind of litle foule whom Aristotle calleth a Sitta, the Latines Reptitatrix or Scandulaca, and the Frenchmen Grimpereau, that doth ye Egle verie great outrage offence.
For no soner perceiueth she the Eagle to be absent from the eyrie, but presently in great dispite she breaketh all hir egges in pieces.
These two being in a maner ye lest birds of all other, are the gretest and deadliest enimies to the Egle and do co~tend with hir vpon poyntes of principalitie rule.
When sayde before, that the Eagle royall was of a yellow mayle, meant nothing else by that speach, but that the Eagle was maylde, of the verie coloure of a Deares haire, which is in deede not yellowe, but browne or tawnie.
And albeit Aristotle for his pleasure, termed it by the Greeke worde, Chrisaitos, which is as much in effect, as to say, the golden Egle: yet must it not therefore bee concluded, that this Eagle is of a right golden mayle, but of a more browne or tawnie mayle, than the other kinde of Eagle is.
The Paynters, and Statuaries of Rome, haue disguised this Egle in their portraytours, for euery man knoweth, that it is farre otherwise, than they haue drawne it.
As well the browne Eagles as the blacke, are skynned and vncased, as the Vultures be, and their skynnes sent to the furryers and pellytours of Fraunce, with their winges, heades, and talons, and euen of the same verie coloure, as haue here set it downe, and declared it vnto you.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of black eagle] Haue signified vnto, you that there are only two sortes of Eagles which serue for Falconrie, which are the yellow or tawnie Eagle, whome haue hitherto treated of, and the blacke Eagle whome must now decypher vnto you.
Aristotle doth terme the blacke Eagle Melauratus, and Lagophanos, bycause she taketh the Hare: and this Eagle the Latines call Pulla, Fuluia, Leporaria, and Valeria, the oddes and difference betwixte these two Eagles is easie to be founde, for this blacke Eagle is lesse than the Eagle royall, which is the yellow and tawnie Eagle, and the blacke Eagle doth as muche differ from the yellowe Eagle, as the blacke Mylion doth from the Mylion Royall.
Plinie hath placed this blacke Eagle in the firste order and rancke of Eagles, as one that would willingly prefer hir before all other kyndes of Eagles.
And here Aristotle hath set hir but in the thirde order and place.
The blacke Eagle (sayth he) being lesse huge and corpulent than the other, is of farre more force and excellencie.
Moreouer he affirmeth that the Eagles doe towre vppe and mount so hye, of purpose for prospect, and to see from farre.
And by reason that their sight is so cleare and perfect, men haue reported them of all others, to be the only byrdes that doe participate with the diuine nature.
Moreouer, for the feare the Eagle hath of hir excellent eyes, she maketh not hir stowping from hir gate at once, and rashly, as other kynd of long winged hawkes do, but by litle and litle.
The Hare is a praye in whome she taketh great pleasure, yet when she findeth the Hare running, she offereth not forth with to seaze on him vpon the mountaine, but can forbeare and staye hir time, vntil he be on the playne champion, and then seazing on him, she presently caryeth him not away, but doth first make trial and experience of him, poysing and weying him in hir pounces, and after that lifting vp the sillie beast, doth beare him cleane away, and prayeth on him at hir best will and pleasure.
Nowe as touching the Vultures, and first of the large ashe coloured or blacke Vulture.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of black vulture] THere are two sortes of Vultures, to wit, the ashe mayld, or blacke Vulture, and the browne or whitish Vulture.
First will speake of the blacke or ashmaylde Vulture, who is in deede more huge than the browne, for the Vulture is the most large byrde of praye that is to be founde, and the female Vulture more large than the male, euen as it falleth out by experience in all kyndes of byrdes of praye and rauyne.
The Greekes, they call the Vulture Gips, and the Latines Vulture.
This Hawke is a passenger in Egipt, more knowne by hir coate and case than otherwise, bycause the furryers doe vse their skynnes for stomackgers, to guard and defend the brest against the force of feruent colde.
All other byrdes of praye do differ from the Vulture, in that they are destitute and voyde of plumage vnder their winges, whereas the Vultures be there vested and couered with an excellent fyne downe.
Their skinne is thicke like a Goats skinne, and namely you shall finde vnder their gorge, a certayne patche of the breadth of your hande, where the plume is somewhat inclining to a redde, like the haire of a Calf, for that kind of plume hath not a webbe fashioned, as other feathers are vsually shapte and proportioned, but are like vnto the downe which is to be founde on eyther side the necke, and on the vpper part of the plye and bent of the wyng, in which parts the down is so white, that it glistereth and is as soft as silke.
The Vultures haue this one poynt speciall, and peculiar to them selues, in that they are rough legged, a thing that hapneth not to any other kynd of Eagles or byrdes of praye.
Of the lesse Vulture, whiche is the browne or whitish Vulture.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of brown or whitish vulture] THe browne or whitishe Vulture, doeth differ from the blacke maylde Vulture, in that hee is somewhat lesse, than the blacke Vulture is, hauing the plumage of hir throte or gorge, of hir backe, the fethers vnder the belly neare the pannell, and of the whole bodie tawnie, or browne of colour: but the brayle fethers, and of the trayne, like to those of the blacke maylde Vulture: whiche induceth some to thinke that there is no difference at all betwixte these twoo kindes, saue that the one is male, and that other female, in the same gender kind.
But this is most certaine assured, that with Noble personages you shal see as wel the one kind as the other.
Eyther sort hath a short trayne in regard of ye largenesse of their wings, whiche is not the nature and shape of other birdes of rauine and praye, saue onely that fowle whome the Frenche terme Piscuerd, the Italians, Pigozo, and in our mother speache may call the Woodwall.
You shal euer finde the Vultures rough, and heary legged, whiche is an euident signe that they frotte and rubbe them agaynste the rockes, where their chiefe abode and staye is.
And further you shall note that the browne or blancke Vultures are more rare and dayntie to bee seene, than the blacke or ashemaylde bee.
Agayne this is peculiar to them in their kinde, that the fethers on their heades bee shorte in respect of the Eagles fethers, which hath bin some cause, that they haue bene thought to be balde and without plume, thoughe in verie deede it bee nothing so.
The Vulture that is ashecoloured or blacke maylde, hathe shorte armes all beset with plume, euen to the very Talons, whiche is a speciall note among all those birdes of rauine, only peculiar to them, and not to any other fowle, hauing crooked Talo~s, vnlesse it be the Owle, who is roughlegged, euen in sorte as these Vultures be.
To discerne the browne from ye ashemayled Vulture, you muste note, that the browne Vulture hath hir necke fethers very strayght long, muche like to those that the Cocke hath or the Stare.
In regard of those feathers on hir backe, sides, and the corner of the plye of hir wings, whiche are little and slender, in manner of scales, but the breaste feathers as also those on the backe, and the couert feathers of the trayne, are to the redde Vulture redde, and to the black Vulture blacke, and to bothe kindes verye large, by meane of their hugenesse they can not be vppon their wings, nor ryse from the stande without some aduauntage.
man shall seldome see them vpo~ the playnes, and champion of Italie, Almanie, and Fraunce, vnlesse happily sometime in the winter, for then they rangle and wander into euery parte, for at that tyme in chiefe they abandone and forsake the toppes of the stately and high mountaines, to auoide the extremitie of cold, doo take their passage into more hote regions and countries, where the clymate dothe better serue their purpose, and better agree with their nature.
The Vultures at the moste, doo not disclose aboue twoo or three chickens or yong birdes, and it is a very harde matter and almoste impossible for any man to robbe their eyrie, for that moste commonly they buyld in some hanging cliffe whether there is very harde and daungerous accesse.
They may bee nourished and fedde with tripes, offell, and inwardes of beastes.
And bycause they doo vsuallye haunte the fieldes of purpose to deuoure the offell and refuse partes of suche beastes as men haue slaughtered and slayne, and suche like carrion, some men are of opinion, that they doe presage and betoken greate murther and bloudy spoyle of men that are in armes.
The opinion of William Tardiffe a Frencheman, concerning the diuision of birdes of praye, and other things woorthe the obseruation.
BIrdes of pray (sayeth he) which we vse in Falconrie, be of three kindes, The Eagle, The Falcon, The Goshawke.
Of Eagles there are two kindes, the one is absolutely called the Eagle, the other Zimiech.
redde mayle in an Eagle, and deepe eyes, specially if the be bred in the west mountaines, (as is before sayd) is one speciall signe of hir goodnesse.
Whitenesse vpon the head or backe of an Eagle, betokeneth the excellencie of the Eagle, whiche in the Arabian tongue is termed, Zimiach, in the Syrian language.
The Eagle must euer be taken when she is in the eyrie, for hir condition is to waxe afterwards very bold outrageous.
It is sayde, that when the Eagle beginneth to growe to lyking, neare cawking or calling time, she co~monly flyeth with other Eagles, bearing with them to their stande where they vse to praye, a peece of Arsenicke, otherwise called Orpiment, whiche doth delay and mortifie their luste and desire.
The Eagle will seaze vpon the Goshawke and any other fowle of rauine, or pray yt doth flye with Iesses, making sure accompt that it is a fitte pray for hir.
And for that only cause and none other, coueteth to apprehend and take them in their flight, for when they are wilde and ramage, vsing the deserts, she offereth them not any suche violence.
meane to auoyde the Eagle, when a man is determined to flye with his hawke, is to plucke of the hawkes Iesses before shee flye, for otherwise let hir do hir beste, shee shall not escape the Eagle.
That Eagle, which is the kindly and right Eagle in deede, will slaye the Hare, the Foxe, and suche like beastes of the Forest and fielde.
The Eagle called Zimiech, will kill the Crane, and other lesse fowles.
deuise and remedie for you, when the Eagle doth moleste and hinder your game in hawking.
Fynde the meanes to get an Eagle, and seele vp hir eyes, but yet in suche sorte, as shee may haue a little sighte to aspire and clyme to hir mowntee, into whose tuell and fundamente conueye a little Assa fetidà, and sowe vp the place.
Then tye to hir legges, eyther a wing, a peece of fleshe, or a redde clothe, whiche the other Eagles maye coniecture to bee fleshe, and so lette hir flye.
For then will shee in hir flyghte, for hir owne safetie and assuraunce, pull downe all the other Eagles from their stately gate and pitche, which otherwise she woulde neuer do, were it not for the payne of that whiche is conueyed into hir tuell.
Now will laye you downe the report of Frauncis Sforzino Vicentino, an Italian, as touching the diuision and nature of Eagles, and so proceede to the Falcon.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of eagle] THere are twoo sortes of Eagles, that is to saye, the huge royall Eagle, whiche is the Haggart or Passenger.
And a lesse Eagle, whiche is a base and bastarde Eagle in respect of the other.
The ryghte Eagle is bredde in the hyghest clyues of Leuante, and speciallye in those of Cyprus.
They are as large as a wylde Goose, and more.
Some of them are of a browne mayle, and some other of a spotted mayle, their gorges and breastes are full of straked lynes, tending to redde, they haue long heades, greate beakes, and very muche crookte, strong armes, and roughe large stretchers, in a manner as greate as the palme of a mans hande, boysteous talons, and a reasonable long trayne.
These Eagles, in the mayne fielde wyll take the Hare, and by force holde him, and carrye him in the ayre as they flee, vntyll they espye some rocke or other fitte stande, where they maye praye vppon him.
In lyke sorte they take other beastes, and sundrye tymes doe roue and rangle abroade to beate and seaze on Gotes, Kyddes, and Fawnes.
They are in vse and price with sundry noble men, as hath bene reported vnto mee credibly.
The greate Turke of all other Princes, doth moste vse to flee with the Eagle, and dothe gyue his Falconers in charge, to man and lure them, as they doe the Goshawke: and beeing throughly manned, hath a caste of Eagles at one tyme, vpon one pearche betwixte twoo of his people into the fielde, when they are there, they flee bothe togither, the one at the mowntee, a very stately pitche, and the other more base and lowe, and that Eagle that dothe flye the base pitche, is taught to make a greate noyse as shee roueth too and fro, ouer the Foreste, not muche vnlike the questing or calling of a dogge, by meane of whiche sodayne crye and noyse, diuers tymes there issue out of the couerte, some wylde and sauage beasts, whiche are no sooner discryed by that high fleeing Eagle, but sodaynly she bateth of hir pitche, stoupeth from hir wings, at the downecome either seazeth or rifleth some one of them, slaying them by force, vntill the dogges maye make in to hir reskewe.
And thus betwixt the Eagle and curres, the praye is taken not without the greate pleasure and lyking of that mightie Prince the Turke.
You maye gesse of the excellencie of this gallante pastime, if it bee trewe, as it is vouched by report.
Heerein can affirme nothing of my selfe, but do folowe mine authour, from whome collected this kinde of hawking, and ambolde to make recytall of it in this place, bothe for the hugenesse of the fowle, as also the straungenesse of the practise.
All these kindes of Eagles, haue their Tyercelles or male birdes, of whome some huge, some of myddle syse, and other some lesse, whiche are called Bastarde Eagles, not had in any accompte.
Thus (as you see) haue layde downe to your vewe and iudgements, the kindes and sortes of Eagles, with their proper descriptions due to them, and other poyntes incident to their natures: and haue stayed more aboute the matter, than needed, in mine owne opinion, beeing a fowle so little in vse with vs, but haue done it as well to make my diuision perfectly, as also to decipher that, whiche euery one perhappes hath not read, as touching the naturall inclination of this royall birde, who for that shee is Queene and chiefe of all hawkes, deserueth some larger discourse than the reste, whiche are in nature more base, though in vse more familiar and ordinarie.
Of the Falcon, and how many sortes of Falcons there are.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of falcon] THere are seauen kindes of Falcons, and among them all for hir noblesse hardy courage, withall the francknesse of hir mettell, may, do meane to place the Falcon Gentle in chiefe.
This Falcon is called the Falcon Gentle, for hir gentle and curteous condition and fashions.
In hart and courage she is valiant, ventrous, strong, and good to brooke both heate and colde, as to whome there commeth no weather amisse at any time, whereas the most part of other Hawkes, eyther are lightlie offended with the one or the other, and muste haue a hand kept vpon them accordingly, or otherwise, there is no great pleasure to be taken in them.
The seconde is the Haggart Falcon, whiche is otherwise tearmed the Peregrine Falcon.
The Haggart is an excellent good byrd, but (as my Authour affirmeth) very choyce, and te~der to endure hard weather: but in mine owne conceyte she is in nature farre otherwise.
And my reason is this, that shee should be better able to endure colde than the Falcon Gentle, bycause she dothe come from forayne partes a straunger, and a passenger, and doth winne all hir pray and meate at the hardest by mayne wing, and doth ariue in those parts where she is taken when the fowles do come in greate flockes, whiche is the very hardest parte of the yeare.
Moreouer being a whote Hawke by kinde, she shoulde the better sustayne the force of weather, and that shee is a whot Hawke of nature, may bee gathered by hir flying so high a pitche, which take to be, for that in the higher parts, she findeth the colder ayre, for ye midle Region is more cold, than the rest, bycause thither commeth no reflexion.
And agayne, shee meweth with more expedition (if she once begin to cast hir feathers) than the other Falcons do.
But these poyntes of controuersie leaue to the learned, and such as haue the experience of the matter.
The third is that Falcon which is called the Tartaret, or Barbary Falcon, whome they doe chiefly vse in Barbary, and most accompt of.
The fourth is the Gerfalcon, which is generall, and common ynough, as well in Fraunce, as in other places.
The sixte, the Laner, common as well in Fraunce, as in other Regions.
These seue~ kinds of Falcons, are al hardie and good, according to the pray that belongeth to their force and nature.
For they are diuers in nature, and of seuerall plumes, and besides that, disclosed and eyried in diuers countries.
Wherefore, meane to touche euery one of their natures, and to declare you, wherevnto eche is enclined, according as they are ma~ned, and gouerned, and first of all will treate of the Falcon Gentle.
But before speake of the Falcon Gentle, will somewhat touch the Etimologie of the name, and lay downe the opinions of two learned men, and auncient writers as touching that matter.
Firste Suidas a Greeke Authour dothe affirme that Falco which in our mother speach doth import a Falcon, is a generall name to all Hawkes of pray and rauine, as Accipiter is in Latine, and [undefined span alphabet] in Greeke.
Festus, he is of opinion, that the Falcon is so named, bycause of hir pownces and crooked Talons, which do bend like vnto a syth, or sickle, which in Latine is called Falx.
But wherehence soeuer the name is deriued, this is moste assured, that of all other birds of pray, the Falcon is most excellent and the very prince of all other Hawkes, both for hir goodnesse of wing, and great hardinesse and courage.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of falcon] THe Falcon Gentle, by nature doth loue to flee the Hearon euery way, and is a very good Hearoner as well from hir wings at the downe come, as from the fiste, and aforehead, and will flee all other kindes of greater fowles, as those which are tearmed birdes of Paradise, fowles more large than the Hearon.
Moreouer she is good to flee the shoueler a fowle like the Hearon, but somewhat lesse, the wilde Goose, and such other like fowles, and therefore is excellente at the Riuer or Brooke.
If you take the Falcon gentle an eyesse, you maye boldly flee the Crane with hir, but if she be not an eyesse, she wil neuer be so hardie as to venture on the Crane.
And therfore being an eyesse, and neuer seing, nor knowing any other lesse fowle than the Crane.
If you cast hir off to the Crane, she foorthwith thinketh it to be a fowle fitte for hir, and by meane thereof fleeth the Crane very well, and becommeth a very good Crane fleer, for Hawkes commonly proue eyther cowards, or hardie after that they are first quarred.
IF a man doe well, he shoulde neuer take the Falcons out of the eyrie, till time they be full summed, and hard penned, or if he do happily committe that errour, he should not man hir, but presentlie cause hir to be conueyed and placed in an eyrie, that most doth resemble the eyrie of a Hawke, if he maye conueniently come by any such, and ther breede hir, and feede hir with good fleash, such as is the fleash of Pullets, Chickens, Pigeons, such like, for otherwise hir wings will not grow to any perfection, and hir legges and other partes woulde quickly be broken and waxe crooked, and hir traine feathers, and for the most part, all hir long feathers and flagges be ful of taints.
THat you may the better make choyce of your Falcon, and know a good Falcon from a refuse, will describe you the perfecte shape of a right good Falcon, suche a one as is very like to be good, though many times we see, that in proofe, the most likely things to shew, to the eye, become in proofe, the worste and of least regard.
The shape of a good Falcon therefore is, first to haue wyde nares, high and large eyeliddes, a greate blacke eye, a rounde head somewhat full on the toppe, a shorte thicke beake blewe as azure, a reasonable highe necke, barbe feathers vnder the clappe of the beake, a good large breaste, rounde, fleshy, strong, harde, and stiffe bended.
And that is the true cause, why the Falcon doth greatlye affye in hir breaste, and striketh with it, and gageth it moste at hir encounter.
And by meane she is very strong armed, shee vseth the more freely also to stryke a fowle with hir pownces and talons.
Moreouer she muste be broade shouldered, shee muste haue slender sayles, full sides, long and greate thighes, she must be strong and short armed, large footed, with the seare of the foote softe, and all one for hewe with the seare of the beake and nares, blacke pownces, long wings and crossing the trayne, whiche trayne ought to be short, and apte to bende and bowe to euery side.
For in the trayne of a hauke doth consist a greate helpe, when she flyeth.
And therefore (as well as for beautie) if a trayne feather or couert feather be broken, or brused, we do couet to ympe them agayne, or set them to right, bicause it may be the lesse hinderaunce to the hawke in hir flighte.
You muste note that those verye Falcons, that are of one kinde and sort, haue very greate difference and oddes betwixt them, and are called by diuers names, according to the tyme that a man beginneth to deale with them, doth vndertake them, according to the places where they haunte, and according to the countries whence they come.
They are diuided into Mewed hawkes, Rammage hawkes, Sore hawkes, and Eyesses, into large hawkes, meane hawkes, and slender hawkes, all whiche are of diuers and seuerall plumes and mayles, according to the diuersitie of the regions.
Also they are of diuers prices, according to the goodnesse and estimation of them.
Agayne, some are blacke Falcons, some russet Falcons, some other blancke Falcons: some of whiche are riuer Hawkes, to slaye the fowle at the brooke, and other some fielde hawkes, to flye the lande, and there to kill the Fesant, Partridge, and such like fowles.
Thus you see howe diuers and many they be, according to their outwarde accidentes, yet in nature, all Falcons.
Therefore, bicause am to treate of euery kinde seuerall, will not longer holde you in this place, with description of the Falcon Gentle, but hereafter when write in another place of the diseases, cures and the manning of these hawkes, will as neare may, let passe nothing, that shall belong in any respect vnto the Falco~, but that in one place or other you shall finde it.
Of the names of a Falcon, according to hirage and taking.
THe firste name and terme that they bestowe on a Falcon, is an Eyesse, and this name dothe laste as long as she is in the eyrie, for that she is taken from the eyrie.
Those Falcons are tedious, and do vse to crye very muche, in their feeding they are troublesome, and paynfull to bee entred: but beyng once well entred and quarred, they leaue a greate parte of that vice, and do proue very good to the Heaton, and to the ryuer, and all other kindes of fowle.
The seconde name is a ramage Falcon, and so she is called when she hath departed and left the eyrie, that name doth laste, and she is called a ramage hawke, May, Iune, Iulie, and August.
These Falcons are harde to be ma~ned by reason of the heate, and for that they can ill brooke hunger, or to stand emptie panneld: but who so can vse them with pacience and iudgemente, shall finde them passing good, for that they are without faulte.
Thirdlie they are called sore Hawkes, from the ende of August, to the laste of September, October, and Nouember.
Those hawkes are of good disposition, they will doe verye well, and are in their prime and full pryde for beawtie and goodnesse.
Neuerthelesse those firste plumes that they haue, when they forsake the eyrie, those doe they keepe one whole yeare, before they cast or mew them, and that kind of feather, is called the Sore feather.
According to the diuersitie of these tearmes, and times, these Hawkes do become better and better to be manned and kept.
The fourth speach and tearme that is bestowed on them (as my Italian Author doth call them) is, that they are tearmed Marzaroli, and so are they called from Ianuary, February, Marche, Aprill, vntill the middest of May.
haue no proper englishe phrase for them, but they are very tedious and paynefull, and the reason is, for that they must be kept on the fiste al that space.
Diuers of them are great baters, and therfore not very greedy of meate or hungrie, they are but badde Hawkes muche subiect to Filanders, and the wormes: who lookes to win credite or good by keeping them, must be of good experience and no lesse pacience.
Fiftly, they are called (Entermewers) or Hawkes of the first cote, that is from the middle of May, till Iune, Iuly, August, September, October, Nouember, December.
Those Hawkes are called Entermewers, for that they cast the old, and haue new feathers, and they proue very good, and hardie Hawkes, but no great trust is to be giue~ them, for that they are giddy headed, and sickle: wherefore he that lookes to haue good, or credite by keeping of them, must be very circumspect, and regarde their natures very well, and must keepe a good hard hande on them, and muste make his fiste theyr pearche, and neuer in a manner lette them bee from the fiste.
Besides, in those seuen kyndes of Falcons, whiche spake of in the first deuision, there are included sundrie sortes tearmed according to the Countries and places where they are eyried and whence they come, the speciall names and properties of all whiche, holde it not so needefull to discourse vppon, speaking fullie and sufficiently of those seauen kyndes of Falcons in theyr tymes and places, as they shall offer them selues in order vnto me to be deciphered vnto the Reader, to whose good iudgement and industrie meane to referre and leaue sundry things whiche leaue vnspoken of, for that there is no man that is desirous of skill, but, may with ease and will with diligence, (I doubt not) flee ouer to those very Authours in Frenche and Italian, from whence haue made this briefe collection, where he shall be assured to fynde things more at large set out: but the effect (vnlesse be deceyued) comprysed in these fewe pages of paper, aswell concernyng the kyndes of Hawkes, as also their mannyng, luring, flightes, mewing, diseases and cures in euery condition, as (I trust) to the pleasure and profite of the gentle and willing reader.
Wherfore wil now proceede to the Haggart Falcon, a most excellent byrde, if hir nature and propertie be obserued in dewe maner.
Of the Haggart Falcon, and why she is called the Peregrine, or Haggart.
Haue many times studied with my selfe, for what cause the Haggart Falcons, the most excellent byrdes of all other Falcons, haue bene termed Haggart or Peregrin Hawkes.
And at first was of opinion that men so called them, for that they are brought vnto vs, from farre and forayne countries, and are in deede meere strangers in Italie, and (as a man may call them) trauaylers.
And this know for truth, they are not disclosed or eyred in Italie, and besides that there are few in Italie, that do take them at any time, but the greatest store of them are brought and conueyed thither from forayne regions· but if they shoulde be termed Peregrine or Haggart Falcons, for this onely cause, and onely in respect hereof and nothing else, then might we as well bestow that name also vpon all other Falcons, that are not bredde in Italie, as vpon the Tunician and other Hawkes that are passengers.
Wherfore am of opinion, that for three causes principally and in chiefe, they are called Haggart, or Peregrine Falcons.
First, bicause a man can not finde, nor euer yet did any man Christian or Heathen, fynde their eyrie in any Region, so as it may well be thought, that for that occasion they haue atchieued and gotten that name and terme of Peregrine or Haggart Falcons, as if a man, would call them Pilgrims or Forayners.
The second cause is, bycause these Falcons do rangle and wander more than any other sorte of Falcons are wonte to do, seeking out more straunge and vncouth cou~tries, which in deede may giue them that title of Haggart and Peregrine Hawkes, for their excellencie, bycause they do seeke so many straunge and forayne coastes, and do rangle so far abrode.
The thirde and last cause, do thinke, may be their beautie and excellencie, bycause this worde Peregrino or Peregrine, doth many tymes importe an honorable and choyce matter, had in great regard: but it skilleth not muche whiche of these three alleged is the true cause, wee will not stande vpon the nyce poynt, for that a good Falconer, ought much more to regarde the searchyng out of the true nature and propertie of Hawkes, than to haue so great and speciall respect vnto their names and termes.
Wherefore conclude, that these Haggart Falcons are not of Italie, but transported and brought thither from forayne places, as namely from Alexandria, Cyprus and Candie.
And yet this is for certayne, that in Italie there are taken of these Haggart Falcons, as in the dominio~ of the renowned Duke of Ferrara, and in the countrie neare Rauenna, beyng brought thither by force of weather and winde.
And by that meanes there are none of those Haggarts founde eyesses, but they are all eyther soare Hawkes, or mewed Haggarts.
Of shape and proportion they are like the other Falcons, and are of three sortes, as touchyng their making, and moulde, that is to say, large, little, or Falcons of a middle sise.
Some of them are long shapte, some shorte trussed Falcons, some larger, some lesse.
They are ordinarily of foure mayles, eyther blancke, russet, browne, or turtle maylde, and some pure white maylde, without any iote or spotte of any other colour, but those a man shall ver seldome see.
And for that cause meane not to say much of that kinde of mayled Falcons, but will deale with suche as are more ordinarie in vse.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of haggart falcon] Good and right Haggart Falcon ought to haue hir head of a darcke or blancke plume, flatte on the toppe, with a white wreath or garlande enuironing hir head, a large blew bending beake, wide nares, a great, full, blacke eye, hie, stately necke, large brest, brode shouldred, a great feather, in colour like the feather of a Turtle, log vanes and sayles, but sle~der shapte, long traine, hie thighes, and white on the inside, meane hir pendant feathers, shorte, and great armed, large wide foote, with slender stretchers and talons, and the same to be eyther pale white maylde, or pale blewysh, tending somewhat to azure.
These are generally, the most assured tokens of an excellent Haggart Falcon.
Good skilfull Falconer, will quickly discerne a good Haggarte Falcon, from a sleight Falcon, though he be farre of, by the stirring of hir wings.
For that a Haggart Falcon vseth not a thicke stroke, but stirreth hir wing by leasure and seldom, and getteth vp to hir mountee, without any great making out.
And although perhaps she be not so large as the sleight or sore Falcon, yet to seeming and shewe she is more large, which happeneth by meane of hir sayles, which in very deede are of greater scope and compasse than the sleight Falcons are.
Contrarywise, the sleight Falcon she vseth a more short and quicker stroke with hir wing, than the Haggart dothe, and doth not deale so leasurely.
There are besides this one difference, sundrie other, betwixt these two kindes of Falcons, which in this place, will deliuer you, for that you shal the better iudge the oddes betwixt them, being both very good Falcons, and the best of all other, both for field and riuer.
The difference and oddes betwixt the Haggart, and the Falcon Gentle.
FOr that diuers haue delight to know the difference betwixt the Falcon Gentle and the Haggart, will here shewe you certayne speciall poynts concernyng the difference of them both.
First the Haggarte is a larger hawke than the Falcon gentle, and a longer armed Hawke, with a reasonable large foote, and hyr talons more long than the Falcon gentles are, a high necke and a long, a fayre seasoned head, and a more long beake than the other hath.
The beame feathers of the Haggart, as she is in hyr flight, are longer than the Falcon gentles, hir trayne somwhat larger, the Haggart hath a flatte thighe, but the Falcon gentle a round thighe.
The Haggart will lie longer on hyr wings than the Falcon gentle, and hath a more deliberate and leasurely stroke than the other Falcon hath, as sayd before.
From the fiste, it is reported by some, that the Falcon gentle dothe flie more speedely than the Haggarte, but at a long flight the Haggarte is farre the better of both, and doth excell all other kinde of Hawkes both for good wing, and maynteynance of hir flighte.
Which is a perfite proofe of a very good backe.
The Falcon gentle is more hastie and whote in all hyr doings than the Haggarte, and is thought more rashe and outragious of nature than the Haggart is.
And whe~ they flee togither, the Falcon gentle will make hir stowping and downecome more vnaduisedly, and will vse the greater haste to be at hir pitche agayne than the other, and missing the fowle at the stowping, the Falcon gentle is in the greater chafe, and will presently flee on head at the checke, so as many times she is harde to come by agayne.
Whereas the Haggarte is more deliberate and better aduised, whiche proceedeth in my opinion, for that she better knoweth the aduantage of hir flight, than the Falcon gentle, bycause she hath bene forced often to praye for hir selfe, and hath not bene subiect to the order of any keper, neyther hath had any hande kepte vpon hir, to make hir eger and greedie of the praye, more than naturally she is accustomed to flee at hyr seasons, to gorge hir selfe, whiche she doth both aduisedly and to great aduantage.
The Haggarte Falcon is taken in Candie, Rhodes, and many other places, of that Sea whiche is called Archipelagus, or the Iegean Sea.
The best sorte of those Haggart Falcons, haue their beakes of the colour of Azure.
Those of Cyprus whiche are small Hawkes and of a russet mayle, they are the moste hardie and ventrous Hawkes of all others.
Much more might be sayde, as touchyng the Haggarte and Falcon gentle, but, for that the Hawkes are dayly in hand and vewe, and bycause haue a larger field to eare, whiche is, to lay you downe the mannyng of them, and such things as are more necessarie to a good Falconer.
leaue it, and will proceede to the next kinde of Falcon, whiche is the Tartaret or Barbarie Falcon.
As touchyng whose name and nature meane to deliuer you, what haue gathered as well out of the French copie, as also borowed from the Italian, whom do much reuerence as well for his language, as for his rare and deepe deuise in all things wherein he doth deale.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of Barbary falcon] THe Barbarie or Tartaret Falcon, is a hawke not very co~mon in any countrie, and she is called a passenger or passebie, euen as the Haggart Falcon is.
They are not full so large as the Haggart Falcon, though some me~ do write otherwise of them, they are red plumed vnder the wing, strong armed with long talons and stretchers.
They are very ventrous vpon all kindes of fowles, and will flie at any game that the Haggart doth.
With this Tartarot, or Barbarie Falcon, and the Haggart also, you may flee all Maye and Iune, for they are Hawkes, that are very slacke in mewyng at the first, but when they once beginne, they mew and shedde their feathers very faste.
For what cause this Falcon is called a Barbary or Tartaret Falcon.
THese kinde of Falcons are called Barberie Falcons, for that most commonly they make their passage through Barbarie and Tunyse, where they are taken more often than in any other place: As namely in the Iles of Leuant, Candie, Cypres and Rhodes, where these Hawkes do more frequent, and vse than in any other Region, and the Countrie men will sooner take them, by endeuour if they may, than any Hawkes that are eyreed in their countrie.
And truly doo not thinke, that in any other place there are so many good Craneslayers, as there are to be had in the Ile of Candie.
The reason of it is, for that the Nobilitie and states of the countrie, are much more enclined to keepe those kinde of Hawkes that will kill the Crane, than any other people are elsewhere, and they do enure and make their Falcons to that kinde of game, more than to any other fowle.
Thus much it hath pleased mine Author to write, of and in commendacio~ of the Barbarie Falcon: but here with vs in Englande, neuer saw or hearde of the proofe of those Hawkes, to be so good or excellent, as by his reporte finde them.
Sundrie other kindes of Falcons proue better with vs here, as namely the Falcon gentle, the Haggarte, and such lyke, which eyther are passengers, or brought to vs from other countries.
The Barbarie Hawke is muche lesse than eyther the Falcon Gentle, or the Haggart, and therefore will only followe myne Author as touching his prayse, and so proceede to the next kynde of Falcons, delyuering you both the opinion of the Italian and French Gentlemen therin.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of gyrfalcon] THe Gerfalcon is a birde of great force, a verie fayre hawke, specially being mewed, shee is strong armed, shee hath large stretchers and singles, she is fierce and hardy of nature, by meane whereof she is the more difficult and harde to be reclaymed.
Gerfalcon will looke to haue a gentle hand kepte on hir, and hir keeper to be curteous and full of patience.
The Gerfalcon is a gallant hawke to beholde, more huge than any other kynde of Falcon, hir eyes and hir head are lyke the Haggart Falcon.
She hath a great bending beake, large nares, a mayle like vnto a Laner, verie long sayles, and sharpe poynted, a trayne muche like the Laner, a large foote, marble feared, blanke, russet, and browne plumed as other Falcons be, more beautifull to the eye than any other kynde of Falcon.
These kinde of hawkes are made to flee from the fiste to the Heron, Crane, Goose, Bustarde, and suche other like foules.
When they are mewed, they doe verie much resemble the Laner, they doe not chaunge the marble seare of the foote.
Theyr Tiercels (whome we call Ierkyns) are had in great pryce, they are brought from Leuant, Cypres, Candy, and Alexandria by Merchantes.
The Gerfalcons by report, doe most commonly eyree in the partes of Prussia, and vpon the borders of Russia, and some of them come from the confines and mountaynes of Norway.
But most commonly they are taken about Almayne Passebyes (as we terme them) or passengers.
With the Gerfalcon you maye naturally flee all kyndes of foules, as haue alreadie written of the Haggart, and the Barbarie Falcon.
Let it not discourage or amaze you, that the Gerfalcon is so harde to be reclaymed and manned, for the fiercenesse and hardinesse of their nature is the onely cause thereof, but in the ende beyng once wonne, they proue excellent good hawkes.
They will sitte verie vpryght and stately on the fiste.
Theyr beakes are blewe, and so are the seares of their legges and feete, their pounces and talons are verie long, and in troth, they will lightly refuse to flee at nothing.
At my beyng in Moscouia, sawe sundrie Gerfalcons, verie fayre and huge hawkes, and of all other kyndes of hawkes, that onely byrde is there had in accompte and regarde, and is of greater price than any other.
The reason whereof learned of certayne Englishe Merchauntes my countrey menne, who tolde me, that the Emperours Maiestie Iuan Vazilniche, did vse to flee the Rauen with a cast of Gerfalcons, and tooke no slender pleasure and delight therein.
The Rauen truely is a monstrous strong flight, by meane she is of so great force and wight of wing, and withall doth vse to make so many turnes in the ayre, as you shall see no other foule do the like.
Yet neuerthelesse, as they told me, they had seene a cast of Gerfalcons beate hir in such wise, as she hath bene forced to take the stande, and to pearche in a Pyne or Fyrre tree for hir succour and safetie.
But that shifte little preuayles, for no sooner is she pearched, but presently by commaundement of the Emperoure, eache Muscouite drawing his hatchet from his backe (without which tooke they neuer trauell in that countrey) bestoweth his force to the felling the tree, which is lightly doone by meane of many handes, and the tendernesse of the tymber, the hawkes all that whyle lying vpon their winges looking for their game: who finding the tree to fayle hir, at the fall is dryuen to trust hir winges agayne, and so by a freshe flight and newe encounter, doth yeelde exceeding pleasure to his Maiestie and such as are in the fielde, and in fyne, is slayne by hir mightie aduersaries the Gerfalcons, who most greedily doe seaze vpon hir, as their kynde hath taught them to doe.
imagine the flight to be verie strong, and truely the pastime and pleasure can not be small, but a game fit for such a mightie Prince as his Maiestie is.
THere be three kindes of Sacres, the first is called Sephe, after the Babylonians and Assyrians, that kynde of Sacre is founde in Egypt, and in the weast partes, and in Babylon.
The seconde kynde is called Semy, she kylles the Choughe, as hir proper game wherein she taken the greatest pleasure.
The thyrde is called Hynair or the Peleryn Sacre, after the Egyptians and Assyrians.
She is called a Peleryn or Haggart, for that hir eyree is not knowne, and bycause yearely she maketh hir passage towardes Iudea, or Media, she is taken in the Iles of Leuant, Cypres, Candye, and Rhodes.
And therefore some thinke she commeth out of Russia, and Tartaria, and also from the greate Sea.
That Sacre that is taken an entermewer, is the best hawke, The Sacre is of all hawkes the most laboursome, and best able to brooke hir flight.
Shee is also peacible and verie tractable, and a hawke that can best away with course and grosse diet.
The praye of the Sacre are greate foules, the Heron, the Goose, the Crane, Bytor, and withall the small beastes of the fielde and forest.
It is well to be sene, that the Sacre is a hawk somwhat larger than the Haggart falcon, of a rustie and ragged plume like the Kyte, the seare of hir beake foote like the Laner, hir pou~ces but short, neuerthelesse, she is of great force, hardie to all kynd of foule, as haue alreadie reported of the Haggart and Barbarie Falcons, but not so ventrous and free to flee the Crane, or such like game as the Haggart Falcon is.
This Sacre is a passenger, euen as the haggart Falcon is.
No man is able truly to say, where she eireeth or discloseth, but at the Rhodes they say they come from the parts of Russia, and Tartaria, and the Ocean Sea.
These Sacres are taken in great number in the Iles of Leuant, Candle, Cypres, and Rhodes, sundry other Ilandes of the Ocean sea.
But must needs confesse to you, that the Sacre is more disposed to the fielde a great deale than to the brooke.
As to flee the wilde Goose, the Byttor, the Feasant, the Partridge, and all such like foules.
And is nothing so daintie of hir dyet, or to be kepte, as the long winged hawkes are.
The Sacre is much like the Falcon Gentle for largenesse, and the Haggart for hardinesse, and is a passenger as the Haggarte is.
She is a Hawke chiefly to flee the kite, and yet may be made and manned, to flee the field, and slay other game of the field as the Falcon doth.
The Noble men that take pleasure in the Sacre, to make a flight with hyr at the kite, do vse this order and deuice, to bring the kite downe from hir mountee, for that in the heate of the day she doth vse to sore and flee of an exceding height in the cloudes, to take the comforte of the colde and freshe ayre, that is in the middle region: They tie a foxe tayle to the legge of a Mallard or Ducke, whom they cause to be borne on the fiste of some one Falconer, and do so let the ducke flee in the middest of a playne, whom as sone as the kite descries from hir pitche, she presently bateth of hir gate, and maketh hyr stoupyng to the grounde, and there gazeth and wo~dreth at the straungenesse and the shape of this fowle; then do they cast of the Sacre to the kyte, who forthwith trusting to the goodnesse of hyr wing, getteth vp to hyr pitche, as hie as possible she may, by making often turnes and wrenches in the ayre, where it is a very pleasant sporte to behold the bickring that is betwixt them in the ayre, specially if it be in a playne, where no trees or groues are, to hinder the sight of the matter, and the day fayre and not windie, for then will the Kite and Sacre sore so hie, as they will flee cleane out of sight.
But that serueth not the Kytes purpose and turne, for the Sacre neuerthelesse doth conquere hyr in the encounter, beating hyr to the grounde by meane of the sundrie stoupings and downe comes that she maketh vpon hyr.
They flee with the Sacre at twoo sortes of Kytes, that is, to the Kite royall, which is called by the Frenche man, the Mylan Royall and at one other kinde of Kyte, called the Blacke Kyte, (the Mylan Noyer whiche is farre the more nimble byrde of the twoo, and doth more busilie trouble the Hauke in hyr flight than the other doth, by meane she is the lesse of the twoo, and vseth hyr wings farre better.
Of al Hawkes, this kind of Hawke hath the longest trayne.
We call the Tyercell of the Sacre, the Sacret, which is the male bird, and the Sacre the female, betwixt whom there is no oddes more than in the quantitie and proportion.
For co~monly among birds of pray, the male is lesse than the female.
The Sacre is called in Latine Buteo, and the Sacret Subuter.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of Lanner falcon] THe Laner is a hawke common in all countries, specially in Fraunce and other places elsewhere, for voluntarily she maketh hyr eyree, and buildeth in high trees and Forestes, and commonly in Crowes nestes or in the high rockes clyffes neare the sea, according as the cou~trie is for the purpose.
The Haggart is somewhat lesse than the Falcon gentle, faire plumed when she is an entermewer, but of shorter talons than any other kynde of Falcon.
And some holde opinion that those Laners that haue the largest and best seasoned heades, and the seare of ye foote azure or blewish, be the eyesses or soare hawkes, they are the best and choysest Laners.
With this hawke may you flye the ryuer, as well with the Laner as the Laneret, for they are both good, and likewise maye you vse them to other kindes of flightes, and specially to the fielde to kyll the Partridge, the Feasant, the Hare, the Choffe, the Dawe, and al such sort of lesser foule.
The Laner is not ouer daintie of hir feeding, but can better brooke grosse and course vittailes, than any Falcon else can doe. Mewed Laners and Sacres, are hardely knowne from the soare hawkes, bycause they do not chau~ge their plume.
By these three signes you shall best know the Laner.
They are more blanke hawkes than any other, they haue lesse beakes than the rest, and are lesse armed and pounced than other Falcons be.
THE Laners doe commonly eyree in the Alpes that deuide Italy from Almayne: some of them are reasonable hawkes, some of a middle sute, and some lesse.
Their heades are white, flat aloft, blacke, and large eyed, slender nares, short beake and thicke, and lesser than the Haggart Falcons, or the Falcon gentle.
They are marble or russet maylde, the breast feathers white, full of russet spottes, the points and extremities of their feathers full of rounde white droppes.
Their sayles and trayne long, they are short legged, with a foote somewhat lesse than the Falcons, marble seered: but beyng mewed, they chaunge the seere of the foote to a yelowe.
These Hawkes will brooke to flee long on their winges after their maner, and when they espie one that goeth abrode with a Sparowhawke to the elde, they presently follow couer the Spaniels, so as no soner is the Sparowhawke cast of to ye Partridge, but if she misse or come shorte of hyr game, the Laner stoupeth with great nimblenesse of wing, and eyther killeth the fowle, or otherwise enforceth it to stoupe and fal amid the flight to the grounde.
You shall neuer lightly see a Laner lie vpon the wings, after she hath flien to marke, but after one stoupyng she maketh a poynt, and then doth awayte for the fowle after the maner of a Gosehawke: for if she misse at the first downecome, or kill not in the foote, she is by nature so slothful and dull, as she will seeke the aduantage, to hyr greatest ease: and therfore doth commonly vse vpon the questing and call of the Spanels, to attend very diligently, and so to pray at hir pleasure.
They are highly esteemed in Fraunce, and (as they say) there made to the riuer, and there do they vse to flee with a caste or leashe of Laners to the brooke, and sometimes with the Laners and Lanerets togither, and sometimes do flee the field with the Laner: but in Italie they do not vse this kinde of Hawke at all.
With vs in England this kynde of Hawke is in price, but accompted very slouthfull, and hard mettelde, so as vnlesse you keepe a very hard hande vpon hyr, she will do little good, cleane contrarie to the nature of a Falcon gentle, who for one good vsage will shewe a treble curtesie, and the better she is rewarded the better will she flee: but vse the Laner well, and she maketh slender accompt thereof, but becommeth slouthfull, and vnapt to flee eyther field or riuer.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of Tunisian falcon] THe Tunician is a Falcon euen muche of the nature of a Laner, yet somewhat lesse than the Laner, but verie like hyr in plume and foote, alwayes more sluggish and heauie in hir flight, and yet more creese than the Laner, and she hath a large rounde heade.
THis Falcon is termed a Tunycian, for that ordinarily and most vsually she is founde to eyree in Barbarie, euen as haue reported to you, that the Laner doth in Fraunce and otherwhere.
And bycause Tunyce is the head and chiefe Citie in all Barbarie, and the Prince and state there, commorant and most abyding, holding the court there, and doe most chiefly vse to flee with these kynde of Falcons of all others, they are most chiefly termed Tunycians.
The Tunycian may also be called a Punycian Falcon, for that which we reade of the warres Punicke, against the Carthaginenses, beyng mainteined against the inhabitantes of that place, where nowe is situated Tunyce.
The Tunycian is large, approching neare the nature of a Laner, and verie like in plume and mayle, and not vnlike, for the seare of hir foote, but somewhat lesse, and of a longe flyght: hir head is large and rounde.
They are excellent good for the ryuer, and will lye well vpon their winges, and flye the field well, as haue sayde before of the Laner.
They doe naturally take pleasure to strike and seaze vpon the Hare, and all other kynde of pray whatsoeuer.
This kynde of Falcons is not so ordinarie or common, in all partes and regions as other hawkes are, saue only in Barbarie and Tunyce.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of merlin falcon] THere is a kynde of Falcon that is called a Merlyn.
These Merlyns are very much like the Haggart falcon in plume, in seare of the foote, in beake and talons.
So as there seemeth to be no oddes or difference at al betwixt them, saue onely in the bignesse, for she hath like demeanure, like plume, and very like conditions to the Falcon, and in hir kind is of like courage, be kept as choycely and as daintily as the Falcon.
Assuredly diuers of these Merlyns become passing good hawkes and verie skilfull, their propertie by nature is to kyll Thrusshes, Larkes, and Partridges.
They flee with greater fiercenesse and more hotely than any other hawke of praye.
They are of greater pleasure, and full of courage, but a ma~ must make greater care, and take good heede to them, for they are such busie and vnruly things with their beaks, as diuers times they eate of their owne feete and talons verie vnnaturally, so as they dye of it.
And this is the reason and true cause, that sildome or neuer shall you see a mewed or entermewed Merlyn.
For that in the mewe they do spoyle themselues, as haue before declared.
My Italyan Author hath these words, both of the shape and in commendation of the Merlyn.
The Merlyn is (sayth he) of the shape of a Falcon, lesse than the Sparowhawke, more nimble and wight of wing than any other hawke, she doth kyll all such game and pray as the Sparowhawke doth vse to slay, specially small byrds, namely Larks, Sparowes, and such like, all which she doth pursue with exceeding crueltie and courage.
She is reported to be a hawke of the fiste and not of the lure, albeit a man may if he will, make hir to the lure also.
She is a verie ventrous hawke and hardie: by this we may coniecture it: For though she be little bigger than a Piegon, yet notwithstanding, she will hazard hir selfe to flee the Partridge, the Quayle, and such other like foules, more large than hir selfe, and wil pursue them in so cruell maner, as sundry times she followeth them, euen to the villages townes, whether the silly birdes do flee for ayde and rescue, from their naturall foe the hawke.
The Merlin is the only hawke of al others in whom (as mine Author affirmeth) there is no difference betwixt the male and female, but yet by experience we finde it otherwise, for the female is ye larger bird of the two, and more big than ye other in sight.
Some are of opinion, that Lydos, Hierax, in greeke, and Leuis accipiter in Latin, is our Merlyn of whome we speake, and that those birdes of praye whome Aristotle termeth Leues to our iudgement shuld be the Merlyns, bicause they are the lesse hawkes of all others that are to be founde.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of hobby falcon] OF all birdes of praye that belong to the Falconers vse, know none lesse than the Hobbye vnlesse it be the Merlyn.
The Hobbye is a hawke of the lure, and not of the fist: also she is of the number of those hawkes that are hye fleeing and towre hawkes, as the Falcon, the Laner, and the Sacre be.
If a man be disposed to describe the Hobbye, he can not do better, nor deale more artificially, than to matche hir for shape with the Sacre.
For in good fayth there is but small difference or inequalitie betwixt them, saue that the Sacre is farre the huger byrde.
The propertie of the Hobbie in all countries and regions, where they are eyreed, or otherwise brought is to soare and flee vpon the hountesmen and Falconers, and so to follow them verie watchfully, to the ende that when they spring or put vp any smal byrdes, she may sloupe from hir winges, and seaze on them as on hir pray.
And this is so ordinary a hawke, and the practise that speake of so generall, as there is not the simplest bowre or peasant but doth know it.
can make no fitter nor more apte comparison, than to resemble the frye and small fish of the sea, being had in chase by the huger sort of fish desirous to deuour them: to the small foules and birds of the ayre, pursued by the Hobbye.
For as sone as the silly fishe that is chased by the Delphin and such like, do perceiue their safetie to be nothing in the Element of water, where, by God and nature they are alotted to liue, eftsone haue they their recourse to the ayre to saue them selues, chosing rather to lye at the mercie of the rauening sea foules, soaring vpon the water, than to yeelde them selues in pray to their naturall aduersaries the fish.
Euen so the Hobbies perceiuing the huntesmen or Falconers in the field so hunt the poore Leueret, or flee ye Partridge, do forthwith accompanie them, soring vpon them, in hope to encounter some one smal bird or other, whom ye hounds or spanels shal by fortune put vp, and spring by ranging ye field.
Then the Larkes and such like small foules, whose nature is not to braunch or take the tree, but altogither to liue vpon ye grou~d, finding themselues pursued by the hounds and spanels, to begile the~, are enforst to trust to their wings, and to take the ayre, being there, finding the~selues molested by ye Falconers Hobbies, do make their choyce and election to become a pray rather to the dogs, or seeke mercy among the horse legges, and so to be surprised aliue, than to affie in the curtesie of the cruell Hobbies, and to be taken in their cruell talons, where they are most assured to dye the death.
The Hobby is so nimble and wight of wing, that she dares encounter the Crowe, and to giue souse for souse, and blowe for blowe with him in the ayre.
This is a naturall and speciall tricke that she dothe vse, espying the Falconers in the field she doth followe them, and attende on them, but it is but for a certaine space, as though in verie deede she had hyr lymites and boundes prescribed hir, and appoynted howe farre she shoulde flee.
For as sone as she leaueth them, she presently scoureth along the syde of some groue or highe woode, where she dothe ordinarily vse to pearch and take the stande.
The Hobbye hath a blew beake, but the seare of hir beake and legges is yellowe.
The crynet or little blacke feathers vnder hyr eyes be verie blacke, so as moste commonly they continue and proceede from the beake to the temples or eare burres, and in like manner, is there an other blacke streake that descendeth to eyther side of hir gorge.
As touching the top of the heade, it is betwixt blacke and yellowe, but hath two whyte seames vpon the necke.
The plumes vnder the gorge and about the browes, are reddishe, without spot or droppe.
The plumes vnder the bellie (or as may best terme them) the breast feathers, are broune for the most parte, and yet poudered with whyte spottes, as Ermynes.
All the backe, the trayne and the wyngs are blacke aloft, she hath no great scales vpon hir legges, vnlesse it be a fewe that beginne behinde the three stretchers and pouncies, which are verie large in respect of hir short legges.
The pendant feathers (which are those behinde the thigh) are of a rustie and smokie vernish complexion.
When a man seeth hir sore aloft in the ayre, he wil iudge hir vnder the wings, that hir plumage and downe, as well of hir winges as betwixt hir legges, is russet and reddishe mayled.
There are two foules, wherof the one is called Ian le blancke which take to be the Harrohen or capped Kyte, and the other Blanch queue the ring tayle, who doe alwayes flee with hir for company, beating and sousing the Larkes, and if happily they spye the Hobbye encountering the Larke, whome they put and force so hir winges, it is a pleasure to behold the game that is betwixt this cast of bussardes and the hawke.
For their desire and intent is to bereaue the sillye Hobbye hir praye: but shee being nimble and wight of wing, encountreth with them, entercepting the Larke from them, manger their might and sundrie times they buckle so together, as you shall see them come tu~bling down both yfeare, one fast griping seazed on the other.
Some would haue that this Hobby of whom write, should be that byrde whome Aristotle calleth Hipotriorchis, and the Latines Subuteo: but am not of that mynde, but that it should rather be the Sacret whome Aristotle doth meane.
But let the learned reader iudge the controuersie, am to lay downe their natures and properties, and not to decyde any matter of controuersie which in deede doth belong to the curious Falconer, and not to him that doth imbrace more the sporte, than the diuersitie and oddes of speache, which in euerie arte a man shall be assured to fynde.
Let it suffice if gyue the Reader to vnderstande the nature of euerie hawke nowe adayes in vse, and withall (according to my promise and meaning) doe let him knowe the meane to flye with them bothe the fyelde and brooke, as also to doe hym to witte, howe to Mewe, Ympe, and cure them beyng diseased.
These are the speciall poynts, and such as deserue thankes from me, and commendation from him.
will proceede in the description of the nature of this hawke, according to the opinion of the Italian.
THe Hobbies are more large than the Merlyns, and for beake, eyes, plume, and foote, they verie much resemble the Falcon.
They will lye vpon their wings reasonably wel, folowing me~, and spanels, fleing vpon them many turnes, to the end that whe~ any Partridge or Quayle is sprong, they may the better stoupe from their wings, and so seaze on the foule, which sundry times they doe.
These kinde of hawkes are vsed of such as go with nettes, and spanels.
The dogges they range the field to spryng the fowle, and the Hobbies they accustome to flee alofte ouer the~, soring in the ayre, whom the sellie byrdes espying at that aduantage, and fearyng this conspiracie (as it were) betwixt the dogges and Hawkes, for their vndoing and co~fusion, dare in no wise co~mitte themselues to their wings, but do lie as close and flat on the ground, as they possible may do, and so are taken in the nettes. some Gentlemen haue made reporte, and for truth assured me, that the (Emperoure Ferdinando of famous memory, did giue his Falconers in charge to keepe reclayme sundrie Hobbies.
And his Maiestie diuers times for recreation, would take his horse, and into the fieldes, with a Hobbie on his fiste, holding in his right ha~d a long sle~der pole, or reede seuen foote in length, on the toppe whereof there was conueyed by sleight, a strong line, with a sliding knotte: And, when happely his Maiestie had espied a larcke on the ground, he would forthwith hold vp, and aduaunce his Hobbie, to the vewe of the sellie byrde, whom as soone as the larcke sawe, she would in nowise dare to spryng, but lie as still as a stone, flat vpon the earth, so fearefull they are of the Hobbie in chief of al other Hawkes: then would the Emperour at his good leasure and greate pleasure, with his long pole, and the sliding line, take the sellie fowle, and drawe hyr vp vnto him, and truely tooke no small delight in this kinde of pastime, and would cause his Falconers to do likewise, who by this deuise tooke many byrdes, and in this sorte woulde they Hawke fro~ the beginning of September, to the end of October.
This practise did somewhat resemble, and drawe to the nature of our deuise, in daring of larckes, whiche wee vse at these dayes, but (in my iudgement) nothing so ready and fitte as our pastime and ginne which we haue, whiche is a very good sporte and full of delight, to see the fearefull nature of the sillie Larcke, with the great awe and subiection that the Hobbie hath hyr in, by the lawe of kinde: for assuredly there is no other Hawke, no not the hugest, whom the larcke doth so much feare as ye Hobbie which may manifestly appeare by this that haue written, as also by dayly experience and practise in that behalfe.
Of the Goshawke, after the opinion of VVilliam Tardiff a Frenchman.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of goshawk] generall deuision of Goshawkes, whom the French men call Autour.
THere are (sayth he) fiue kindes of Autours or Goshawkes, speaking of the Goshawke in the largest name and nature, comprysed in that woorde, Autour.
The first and moste noble kinde, is the female Goshawke, whiche is with vs most ordinarily in vse.
The second is named a demy Autour, or Goshawke, as it were a kind betwixt twoo other sortes, and that is a spare slender hawke and of little regard, in respect of any good she will do.
The third is the Tyercle whiche is the male, or cocke to the Goshawke, who doth slay the Partridge, and is not of sufficient force to kill the Crane.
He is termed a Tyerclet, for that there are most commonly disclosed three byrdes in one selfe eyree, two Hawkes, and one Tiercell.
The fourth kind of Autour is ye Sparowhawke, whose nature is to kill all kinde of praye that the Goshawke dothe, saue onely the larger sorte of fowles.
The fifth kind is called Sabech whom the Egiptians terme Baydach which doth very much resemble the Sparowhawke, but is lesse than the Sparowhawke, and hath a very blewe eye.
There are sundrie sortes of Goshawkes, and those brought and conueyed out of sundrie forayne partes and regions, but among the~ all, that Goshawke that is bred eyreed in Armenia, and Persia, is the principall best hawke, and then next to hyr in goodnesse, the hawke of Greece, and lastly that of Afrike.
The hawke of Armenia hath hyr eyes greene, but ye best of yt kinde is she that hath blacke eyes, blacke plumes on hir backe.
The hawke of Persia is large, wel plumed, cleare and deepe eyed, with hangyng and pendant eyleddes and browes.
The hawke of Greece hath a great head, well seasoned, a strong necke, and is reasonable well plumed. the Goshawke of Afrike, hath blacke eyes in hyr soarage, but being a mewed hawke, hyr eyes become reddish and fierie.
At what times Hawkes begin to fall to liking, which is at Cawking time, all byrdes of pray do assemble themselues with the Goshawke, and do flocke togither.
As namely the Falcon, the Sacre, and such other that liue on praye and rauine.
And hereof it proceedeth that the Goshawkes become so diuers in goodnesse, force, and hardinesse, according to the diuersitie of their choyce, and cawkyng.
The best Goshawke ought to be weightie, and a heauie bird, as those of great Armenia bee.
In Syria they make choyce of their Hawkes, by the Massynes and poyse of them, do esteeme ye most weightie Hawke for the best: as for the mayle conditions they do little regard or prize.
The blancke Goshawke is the largest, the fayrest, and moste apt and easie to be reclaymed, and withall the strongest of all Hawkes of that sorte, for she can kill the Crane.
And by reason she is eyreed in a very hie and loftie place, and ca~ best endure the colde, which is most frife in the middle region of the ayre, therefore is she good to flee all fowles of that sorte and condition.
The Goshawke that doth encline and tend to a blacke maile, and that hath superfluous plumes on hyr head, reachyng downe hir fronte or forehead, like a peruque, or borowed hayre, that is a very fayre Hawke for beauty, but nothing strong.
SHe ought to haue a small head, hyr face long and straight like the Vultur or Eagle, a large winde pipe or throte, great eyes, deepe set, and the apple or middle parte of the eye blacke, nares, eares, backe and feete, large and blancke, a blacke long beake, long necke, bigge brest, harde flesh, long thighes, fleshie, and distant one from the other, the bone of the legge and knee shorte, long and large pounces, and talons.
The shape from the sterne or trayne, to the brest forwarde, ought to grow to a roundenesse.
The feathers of the thighes towards the trayne should be large, and the trayne feathers, short, softe, and somewhat tending to an yron mayle.
The brayle feathers ought to bee, like the brest feathers, and the couert feathers of the trayne, should be spotted, and full of blacke rondels, but the colour of the very extremitrie and poynt of euery trayne feather, ought to be blacke streaked.
Of mayle colour, the best is the red, somewhat tending to blacke or playne grieseld.
The signes of a good Goshawke, are haughtie courage, desire and greedie luste to feede, often tyring and plucking of hyr meate, suddayne snatching of hyr foode vpon the fiste, good enduing, and great force in assayling hir game.
The signe of boldenesse in a Goshawke is this, tie hyr in an open lighte place, and after a while darcken and obscure it, by shutting some windowe or such like deuice, then touche hyr vppon the suddayne at vnwares, if she then iumpe, and leppe to the fiste without feare or astonishment, that is an assured signe of hardinesse in a Goshawke.
The token of force in a Goshawke, is this, tie diuers Goshawkes in sundrie places of one selfe chamber or mewe, and that Hawke that dothe and mewte hiest and farthest of from hir, vndoubtedly is the stro~gest Hawke, for that one point declareth and argueth a good strong backe in the Hawke.
token of goodnesse and excellencie in those demie Gosshawkes, whom my Author doth terme petite Autours is to haue large and cleare eyen, a small head, long necke, lowe and close plume or downe, harde fleshe, a greene seere of hir foote, large stretchers and not gowtie or fleshie, quicke enduyng, large panell, and able to slyse farre from hir when she mewteth.
The point of the beake to be blacke is a very good signe.
ALbeit there be a generall rule, that contraria contrarijs dinoscuntur which is that one contrarie is knowen sufficiently by the other, and therefore hauing made you full shewe of the good shape of Goshawkes, the ill proportion will easely thereby fall out and be descerned of it self without any farther trauayle, yet neuerthelesse followyng mine Authour, think it not amisse to decypher you the ill forme of a Goshawke: which is, to haue a great head, a shorte necke, to be thicke and grosse plumed, softe fleshed, short thighed, long armed, shorte talons, tawnie hewed, tending to blacke, and harde and rough vnder the foote.
Goshawke that when she is loose in the house, flees as though she were at large and libertie, breakyng out of a mewe hauyng great grosse feathers, eyes as redde as bloud, that is euermore batyng, and beyng set on the perche, offreth to flee at the face of a man, suche a Hawke if she be kepte lowe in fleshe can not be borne on the fiste, if she be hie and full of fleshe, she wil not then abide with hir keeper, but rangle and gadde: wherfore of such Hawkes there is no accompt to be made at all.
fearefull Goshawke is hardly to be reclaymed and manned, for the feare she hath will alwayes cause hyr to refuse the fiste and lure, and make hyr checke, and not willingly repayre to any deuise wherwith she is called and rappelde, after hyr flight: whiche is a verie great inconuenience in a Goshawke, and no small hindrance to the sporte of him that shall happen to haue suche a fearefull Hawke: for commonly vnlesse they be firste fonde of the keeper, and in loue with the call, they will not flee their game to the likyng of their owner, and the tediousnesse in commyng by them agayne after the flight, dothe breede forgetfulnesse of the pastime, how good and delectable soeuer it were before.
That Goshawke, that hath pendant plumes ouer hyr eyes, and (as they say in the Countrie) whose feathers hang in hir light, the whyte of whose eye is very watrishe and blancke, that is redde maylde, or bright tawnie, hath the moste assured token that may be of ill condicions, and is not like to be well co~ming.
But if happely such a Hawke fall once to be good, she will then proue a passing Hawke.
Sometimes (though very seldome) do wee see a Goshawke of badde shape and in condition cleane contrarie to those signes that ought to be lookt for in a good Goshauke, proue light, lusty, able to hold out and maintayne hir flight, and such a one as will very well slay the greater sorte of fowles.
The Goshawkes praye, is the Fezant, the Malard, the wilde Goose, the Hare and Conie: besides all whiche she will strike ventrouslie, and seaze on a Kidde or Goate, and keepe him play so long, as the dogges at length shall come in to assyste hir and further the fall of it, whiche doth manifestly decypher the great inestimable courage, and valour of the Hawke.
Out of the French haue collected this concerning the Goshawke.
SOme men haue thought, and bene of this resolute minde, that the (Autour) or Goshawke hath bene of the kind of a Vultur, for the affinitie and nearenesse of their termes and names: for (Autour) in the French, is that Hawke whom we call the Goshawke, and (Vantour) is the Vultur, which twoo termes, as you see, draw very neare to one speach.
Some other haue been of opinio~ that betwixt ye Goshawke and Sparowhawke, is no oddes or differe~ce in nature, saue only in respect of the hugenesse of that one, and the slendernesse of the other: but my purpose is to treate of the Goshawke seuerally from the Sparowhawke, and so to proceede to the Sparowhawke, of whom wil write, according to the French and Italian Authours, in a seuerall chapter by it selfe, to auoyde the co~fusion, which otherwise might happen in that behalf.
The Goshawke is euer more regarded than hyr Tiercell, for the males, or cockes among Hawkes and byrdes of praye, do make euident proofe and shew to the eye, of their difference from the femals and Hawkes.
Againe we may with ease discerne the Goshawke from hyr Tyercell, for that she is farre larger, tha~ the Tiercell of hir kind.
The Falconers and Ostregers, haue to these two sorts, added a thirde kinde (as sayd before) whome they terme the Demygoshawke, as a byrde indifferent, betwixt the other twoo.
Bothe kindes of them are more hie, and longer armed than eyther the Falcon, or Gerfalcon: they are Hawkes of the fiste, and (as wee call them) rounde winged Hawkes, quite contrarie to those wrote of before, all whiche are Hawkes of the lure, and long winged Hawkes, otherwise called Towre Hawkes.
The Hawke (I meane the female) is uery much like the Egle in mayle, and if wee may make bolde to compare the lesse with ye larger, she hath a more stately high necke than the Egle, and of a more redde or yron mayle, the grownde of hir plume and downe tending to a redde colour.
Those Goshawkes that are of Slauonia, are good at all maner of game, large, hardie, and fayre plumed, their toungs black, and their nares great and wide.
There are Goshawkes, whom the Italians call, Alpisani, or haukes of the Alpes, which are much vsed in Lombardie, and Tuscane, they are more thicke than they are lo~g, fierce hardie.
But those Goshawkes that our Ostregers haue now adaies, are chiefly conueyed out of Almayne, hauing their eyes and the feare of the beake as also of theyr feete and legges, yellow, contrarie to the Gerfalcon, whose feare is blew and azure.
Their traynes are garnished with large droppes or spottes, crossing the feather, partie blacke, and partie grey, as also the plumes of the necke and head, are more towardes a russet, and powdred with blacke, but those of the thighe and vnder the bellie or pannell, are otherwise marked, for they are not full so yellowe, hauing rounde droppes on them, not muche vnlike those that are on the Peacockes trayne.
The Goshawkes of Almaine are not verie fayre though they be large Hawkes, redde mayled, and yet not hardie.
There are sundrie of them good in their soarage, but beyng once mewed proue nothing worthe: there be diuers of the~ taken in the forest of Arde, and in sundrie places of Almaine.
The Greekes haue called the Goshawke Hierax, the Latins Accipiter stellaris, and the Italians, Astuy.
Thus much haue collected out of another French Author, as necessarily belonging to the description of the nature of a Goshawke, bicause you shall see the seuerall opinions of sundrie wryters, and gather to your owne vse, what shall occurre and thwarte best with your liking, for it is not the mayle and plume of the Hawke that so greatly regard, or do meane to stand vpon, as the making, reclayming, diseases, and cures of the sayd Hawkes, each one after their proper nature and qualitie, if so my health will giue me leaue to runne myne authors through aduisedly, according to my meaning and resolutio~, at what time first vndertooke this collection.
Out of the Italian concerning the Goshawkes and their kinds.
THere are sundie sortes of Goshawkes, according to the diuersitie of places and regions.
There be Hawkes of Armenia, Slauonia, Sardinia, Calament, of the Alpes, whiche they vse in Lombardie, Tuscan, Marca, and Puglia, some other of Russia, Friuli, Almania, and othersome of Lombardie, all which will briefly touch vnto you, and not long dwell in the matter, hauing out of my french authors already deciphered the natures of the most part of them.
First of al there are Goshawkes, called Armenia Hawkes, much differing from the Goshawke, in sort as almost, they haue no resemblance at all to the other kinds of Goshawkes.
They are very fayre and huge, the mayle of them is blancke, as sundrie haggart Falcons be, they flee with great courage and life, all greater sort of fowles.
There are others eyried in Slauonia and Dalmacia, and thence are they tearmed Slauon Goshawkes, which indeede are good for any thing a man will employ them vnto.
Very fayre hardy Hawkes, large footed, very well penned, theyr downe and plumage excellent fine, their tungs blacke, and their nares large and wide.
Those of Sardinia are nothing like the other Hawkes, they are browne, and russet plumed, finall Hawkes, hard and not small footed, and nothing ventrous.
Those of Calament are short trussed Hawkes, and large, blancke seared on the foote, those flee the greater fowles exceeding well.
The Goshawkes of the Alpes, and of Calabria, are in a manner more large than they are long, very prowde, and hardie Hawkes.
The Goshawkes of Lombardie are not very large, browne mayld, and cowardly kytes to do any good.
The Goshawke of Russia and Sarmatia, is a large and huge Hawke, the most part of them are blancke Hawkes, and taken vp of great Princes and noble states, they are apt and able to do any thing that may be looked for from Hawkes of that kinde.
My selfe haue seene great store of them in the Citie of Mosqua, which is the chiefe dukedome of all Russia.
The Moscouits Tartarians doe vse to flee with those Goshawkes at the brooke, there do beate vp the fowle with y~e drumme, without whiche you shall seldome see a Boyaron (as they tearme them) which is a Gentleman, ride at any time.
And one speciall thing which noted among them was, that as well Moscouites, as Tartares, do vse to beare their Hawkes on the right fiste, whiche is cleane contrary to our manner and guise heere in England, or in any other Region that haue heard or seene, saue only in those North partes, no reason can yeeld for it, but that, each countrey for the most part hath his fashion.
Those of Friuli, are good Hawkes, and large, but not so fayre as the Slauon Hawkes.
Note this, that a good Goshawke ought to be littell, and broad shouldred, large brested, very round and fleshly, hauing a long thigh, a short legge or arme, and the same greate, and a large foote, and not gowty but slender.
Contrariwise the Tiercell should be large, for it is a common saying.
All Goshawkes are by nature greedye, and catching of whome some we vse to flee the riuer, and fresh brookes, and some the Sea, and othersome agayne the field, and neuer or very seldome the riuer or brooke.
The firste sorte for the most parte doe pray vppon Duckes, Geese, Hearons, Shouelers, and such lyke fowle, as do vsuallie haunt, and liue in the Sea and riuers.
And those diuers times doe seaze and take theyr pray vppon the suddayne at vnwares, by fleeing lowe neare the ground, and stealing vppon the fowle.
The other, after a while that they haue vsed to flee the field, do pray on Pigeons, Pullets, Hennes, and Partridges.
And being once mewed hawkes, and past their soarage, they will take the stand vppon some tree, and finding eyther Patridge, Fezant, Pullet, Henne, or suche other like fowle, they make their stowping so fiercely and in such great hast, and do flee them so farre before hed and at randon, mayntayning, and making good their flight, as in the end they kill them, and do pray vpon them.
Of the Goshawkes, those that bee ventrous, and hardie, will kill the Hare, and hauing kilde him, diuers times, they swallow in for hast greate bones, and doe put them ouer very well, and endue them safely withoute anye hurte at all.
Those that are the riuer Goshawkes, and doe haunte the water, and brookes, are commonly the moste hardy and ventrous Hawkes of all that kynde, and do at the riuer of theyr owne inclination and nature fall to kill the greate fowles of the Riuer, of whyche haue before made recitall and mention.
Truely the Goshawke is very muche to be regarded for hir hardie mettall and courage, for that therein she is not inferiour to anye kynde of Hawke, but rather more fearce and eger.
And agayne to bee kept with greater care, for that shee is more choyce and daynty, and doeth looke to haue a more nice hard kept on hir, than any other kind of Falcon or Hawke, vnlesse it be y~e Sparowhawke, which is all one in a maner in nature with the Goshawke, and of whom purpose now to write.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of sparrowhawk] Wil now write somewhat of the Sparhawke, for that she is in hir kynde, and for that game that hir strength will giue hir leaue to kill, a very good Hawke, and much vsed in Fraunce, And besides, he that knowes well how to man, reclayme, and flee with the Sparhawke, may easely know how to keepe, and deale with all other Hawkes.
Moreouer it is a Hawke, that serues both winter and somer, with great pleasure, and the game that she fleeth is ordinarie, and common to be had, and she will generally flee at all kynde of game, more than ye Falcon, or than any other kind of Hawke will.
And the winter Sparhawke, if she proue good, will kill the Pye, the Iaye, the chough, the Woodcocke, the Thrush, the blacke Birde, the Veylfare, and sundry other sortes of byrdes.
The diuersitie of Sparhawkes according to their times and ages.
THe Eyasse hawke, is she that is taken in the eyree.
The brancher, is she that followeth the old Hawke, fro~ braunch to braunch, and tree to tree, whiche is also tearmed a ramage Hawke.
The Sore Hawke, is she that hath flien, and prayed for hir, and is taken before she mewe. The fourth kynde, is that Hawke, that is mewed, and hath cast hir soare feathers.
SParhawkes are of diuers ploumes, some are smal plumed, and blanke Hawkes, othersome of a larger feather, whiche are not so good in oure opinion as for theyr shape.
The Hawke that is well shapt is large and short, with a slender heade, large, and broade shouldred, bigge armed, large and wyde footed, and blacke maylde, with a good great beake, hir eyes somewhat hollowe, and deepe set, blanke eye liddes, the seare of hir beake twixt greene and white, a hie bigge necke, long wings, reaching quite athwart the bodie of the Hawke, so as the poynt of the wing meete with the toppe of the trayne very neare, and that hir trayne be not ouerlong, but of a reasonable broade feather, sharpe pownces, small and blacke, and euermore well disposed to feede hungerly with great appetite.
The Nyasse Hawke is good, and will come to the fist very well, and not lightly soare away, or be lost.
The Sore Hawke is hard to bee manned, but will prone good, if she will once brooke company, this Hawke, for that she hath prayed for hir selfe, is very ventrous and hardie.
The best Sparowhawke, is that Hawke whom we cal the brauncher.
THere are Sparowhawkes, whome the Italians call di+ventimiglia whiche are large and long Hawkes, with a greate beake, large foote, and with thirteene feathers in the trayne.
Those Hawkes are excelle~t to flee any kind of game.
There are other called Slauon Hawkes, good for all purposes, and full of hardinesse, long and large Hawkes, hauing a great long beake, and blacke brest feathers.
There are others of Calabria not very large, but of greate courage, plumed like the Quayle, that will do according as they are taught and manned.
There be sparowhawkes eyreed in Corsica and brought fro~ Sardinia, small Hawkes, browne or canuas maylde, that will flee very well.
The Hawkes of Uerona and Uicentia, are of meane size, and many of them do proue to be good Hawkes.
There be Sparohawkes called Alpisani, of the Alpes, that are large, wight of wing, and ventrous to flee any kynde of fowle.
Ther are others eyreed in ye bale of Sabbia, of a reasonable lise, russet maylde, entermedled with golden spottes, or droppes, like the turtle, those be very good to flee great fowles.
Ther is one other kind of Sparowhawkes, eyreed in Bergamasca, in a vallie called the Blacke vale, neare the confines of Uoltolina, slender Hawkes, browne mayld, good to be manned and reclaymed, and those are the principallest of all other Sparowhawkes.
do not here in this place deale exactly of the mayles, and plumes of these kinde of hawkes, in parte for that the hawkes are of sundry and seuerall plumes, according to the diuersitie of countries and regions, where they are eyreed: and parte, for that the hawkes themselues are so ordinary in vse, as it were to be esteemed but a superfluous labour, to waste muche tyme therein, in penning of that, which is (in the opinion of men) of no greate importance.
My chiefe care and industrie (if health allow mee leaue, and sicknesse too muche offende not my ease) shall consist in the reclayming and ma~ning of all these kindes of hawkes, according to their natures and properties, and in displaying the meanes to flee with them, and to keepe them, both for the fielde and brooke.
And after that, in declaration of their diseases, ordinarily incidente vnto their kindes, and the beste remedies for the same, whiche (I doubt not) are the only and chiefest poyntes that the discrete and learned reader will accept from mee, and suche as will moste stande him in steade that doeth meane to deale with hawkes.
Wherefore thus make the Epiloge and conclusion of the first part of my treatise and collection, wherein are contayned all the kindes, names, and the causes of those names, of all suche Hawkes birdes of pray as are most in vse, and regarded among noble men and gentlemen at these dayes, crauing the Reader to bestowe no lesse good liking vppon the translation and collection heereof (if it in anye parte deserue it) than haue employed trauaile and paines in the true search and examination of the same, both out of the Frenche and Italian Authours, where must confesse, haue not translated Uerbatim, and by word of line what founde (for then had not dealt so exactly as now haue done, for that found sundry thinges not so well agreeing to our humours and vse,) but haue taken my pleasure of them, in making choyce of the chiefest matter, whiche did occurre in them, hoping, that the more my paynes haue bin the lesse shall be mine offence, and the greater the liking of the Reader, and the better hys acceptaunce: whiche if finde, both for my trauayle, shall thynke my selfe sufficiently guerdoned, and the careful Printer deeme both his coste and charge well employed, beeyng meante, to the benefyte and pleasure of his natiue countreymen, whose auayle he chiefly respecteth herein, and not any great aduauntage that shall priuately fall out to him.
THough the Matagasse be a Hawke of none accompte, or price, neyther with vs in any vse, yet neuerthelesse, for that in my deuision made recitall of hir name, according to the French Author, from whence, collected sundrie of those poynts and documents, appertayning to Falconrie: thinke it not beside my purpose, briefly to describe heere vnto you, though must needes confesse, that where the Hawke is to so slender value, the definition, or rather description of hir nature and name must be thought of no great regard.
She is beaked and headded like the Falcon, hir plume is of two colours, hir brest white, hir eye, beake, and foote blacke, a long blacke trayne, hir flagges and long fethers partly black, and white, and the coloure of those fethers she chaungeth not, though she mewe neuer so ofte.
Hir feeding is vpon Rattes, Squirrells, and Lisards, and sometimes vpon certaine birdes she doth vse to praye, whome she doth intrappe and deceyue by flyght, for this is hir deuise.
She will stand at pearche vpon some tree or poste, and there make an exceeding lamentable crye, and exclamation, suche as birdes are wonte to do, beeing wronged, or in hazarde of mischiefe, and all to make other fowles beleeue thinke that shee is verye muche distressed, and standes needefull of ayde, wherevpon the credulous sellie birdes do flocke togither presently at hir call and voyce, at what time if any happen to approche neare hir, she out of hande seazeth on them, and deuoureth them, (vngratefull subtill fowle) in requitall of their simplicitie and paynes.
These hawkes are in no accompt with vs, but poore simple fellowes and peasantes sometimes do make them to the fiste, and beeyng reclaymed after their vnskilfull manner, do beare them hooded, as Falconers doe their other kindes of hawkes whome they make to greater purposes.
Heere ende of this fowle, bicause neither accompte hir worthe the name of a hawke, in whome there resteth no valour or hardinesse, ne yet deseruing to haue any more written of hir propertie and nature, more than that shee was in mine Authour specified, as a member of my deuision, and there reputed in the number of long winged hawkes.
For truely it is not the propertie of any other hawke, by suche deuise and cowardly wile to come by their praye, but they loue to winne it by mayne force of wings at randon, as the rounde wynged hawkes do, or by free stowping as the hawkes of the Tower do moste commonly vse, as the Falcon, Gerfalcon, Sacre, Merlyn, and suche like, whiche do lye vpon their wing, roding in the aire, and ruffe the fowle, or kill it at the encounter.
cannot saye, that at any time haue seene this kinde of hawke, neyther in any booke read of hir nature and disposition, as haue here made mention of it, saue onely in my authur, who writing of Falconrie, was so bolde as to rancke hir among other hawkes, of greater accompt and valewe, and in Gesner, where hee treateth of all kinde of birdes and fowles, where, remember wel, haue read of the name and nature of the Matagasse, and there haue seene hir proportion shape sette downe in coloures, suche as haue before declared you in this chapter.
and, in my iudgemente, no oddes or difference to bee founde, betwixt Gesnerus description, and mine authors, in that behalfe. (&becaus) The Second parte or booke, of this collection of Falconrie.
Certayne speciall poyntes, necessarie for a Falconer, or Ostreger, collected out of the Italian Author.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of man with falcon] Hauing made you sufficient shewe in the former part of this booke, and collectio~, of all kinds of hawkes seruing to Falconrie, it shall not be amisse to deliuer you some speciall necessarie rules, due to a good Falconer.
Firste, it is behooueful for a Falconer to bee very diligent inquisitiue to learn and marke the qualitye and mettell of his hawkes, to knowe whiche hawke he shal flee withall earely, and with whiche late, bycause all hawkes are not disposed or mettelde alike.
Wherefore, the firste and speciall obseruation is, to note the naturall inclination and disposition of his hawkes in that behalfe.
Then nexte is it necessarie for him to bee fonde ouer his hawke, patte~t, withall carefull to keepe hir cleane out of lise, mytes, and all suche other diseases, as shall hereafter treate of in the latter parte of this collection, with suche remedies, as shall laye downe for euery griefe.
And of the twoo, hee must rather keepe his hawke hye, and full of fleshe, than poore and lowe.
Besides that, this is one generall rule, whiche by experience you shall finde to bee most true, that all kindes of hawkes are more subiect to infirmities, being poore and lowe, than when they are lustie and full in fleshe.
Euery night, after he hath fleen with his hawke the daye, either at the fielde, or brooke, he muste giue his hawke casting, somewhyles plumage, some other while pellets of Cotton, or suche like, and agayne, sometimes some one medicine or other, according as by hir casting, or mewte, he shall perceyue hir to stande needefull thereof, whiche poynte will more at large describe, in another place proper and peculiar to that matter.
Euery night, hee muste not forgette to make the place very cleane vnder the pearche, so as he may bothe finde the casting of his hawke, and be certainly assured whither she hath already caste or not, whereby he may the better iudge and discerne hir state.
For by the casting is founde, whither the hawke do neede eyther vpwarde, or downward scowrings, or stones, or any suche like remedie.
He muste remember euery euening to tye out his hawke a weathering, saue onely in suche dayes, as she hath bathed before, for bycause then the taking ouermuche moysture, wyll breede hir a thousande euills and inconueniences.
For suche euenings as she hath bathed the daye, shee ought of right to be placed in some warme chamber on a pearche, with a candle burning by hir, where she must sit vnhooded, if so she be gentle, and not rammage, to the ende she may tricke hir selfe, and reioyce by enoyling hir after the water, before she flee againe.
Euery morning earely he muste not forgette to set hir out to wether hir, where if shee haue not alreadie caste, shee may caste, and there keepe hir hooded, till suche tyme as shee go to the fielde.
In feeding his hawke, he muste beware of giuing hir twoo sortes of meate at one time, to gorge hir withall, neither must hee gyue hir suche fleshe, as hath any euill sauour, and is not sweete, but muste respecte to allowe hir holsome meates, for breeding ill diseases.
For Hawkes are dayntie birdes, in their kinde, and the more to be considered of, when they are in hande, vnder a Falconers keeping and vsage, bycause they were wonte to praye for themselues at libertie, and therein followe suche lawe and order, as nature had prescribed them, but being restrayned, the course of kinde is quite altered in them, and therfore the greater arte and regard to be vsed for them.
He muste beware, if happily he haue occasion of necessarie busines, at his departure from home, not to leaue his hawke tyed on a pearche of any greate heyght from the grounde, for feare of bating hanging by the heeles, for then either will she caste hir gorge, or otherwise spoyle hir selfe: but she muste be placed on a lowe blocke, or stone, and if there be mo hawkes than one, they muste be sundred so farre one from the other, as they maye not approche or reache one the other, neyther with beake, talons, or otherwise, bicause their nature is to byte, and buckle togither, if they come within reache.
When he addresseth him to make his flighte with his Falcon, it is behoouefull for him to haue all hir fellow Falconers, or such as haue hawkes in the field, to set downe their hawkes on the grounde, to be in the more readinesse to assiste him in his purpose, and to tye them sure, for feare of ill accidents that may befall them.
And againe, at the ryuer, he must skilfull to lande his fowle so placing the residue of his company, and their hawkes, as they may flee eke without any encounter, which is not onely the losse of the fowle, and hinderance to their sporte, but also the ruine and spoyle of their hawkes on both partes.
He must be carefull that his hawke keepe hir gate, and flee it good, so as in no wise hee plucke hir not downe, nor make hir bate of hir pitche.
He muste alwayes be assured to haue mummy in powder in his bagge in a readinesse, whatsoeuer should happen, with suche other medicines as shall hereafter treate of, for that it may so fall out, as his hawke may receyue a broose at the encounter of a fowle.
Moreouer he muste not be vnfurnished of Aloes washt, Cloues, Nutmugges, Saffron, casting, cryance, and suche like necessarie implementes.
And he must remember that his Aloes be shining and cleare, for then is it of the beste sorte of Aloes.
Lastely he muste be able to make his lures, hooddes, of all sortes, Iesses, bucts, other nedefull furniture for his hawke, and must not be without store therof to allow his betters and states in the fielde, if happily they want any suche deuises.
He cannot well be without his coping yrons, to cope his hawkes beake if it be ouergrowen, whiche will be a hinderance to hir feeding, and to cope hir pownces and talons, if neede be.
He muste haue his cauterizing buttons, and other yron or siluer tooles, to cauterize or burne his hawkes if cause require suche cure.
For hauing all these necessaries, and doing as haue will tell you, all his game shall succeede and sorte wel, he be assured for ye most part of good pastime in ye fielde, when other ignora~t gromes shal both lacke sport, loose their hawkes, the greatest corsie yt may happen to a gentleman yt loues ye game.
Let these fewe aduertisementes and instructions suffice in this place, if other wynts necessarie not recited here, be reme~bred at the full in any other parte of this booke, craue but thankes for my paines, curtesie at the Falconers handes, for whose learning and pleasure partly and chiefly wrote this collection.
The first instruction is, how to make a Falcon and other hawkes fleeing, after the opinion of Ian de Franchiers.
FIrst, let your hawke be taken on the fiste, and hoodded, then let hir be watched three dayes and nightes, before you vnhoode hir, and feede hir alwayes hooded in an easie rufter hoode.
At the ende of three dayes you may vnhoode hir, and feede hir vnhooded, and when she is fedde, hoode hir againe, so that she be not vnhooded (but whe~ you feede hir) vntil she know hir meate: then when she beginneth to be acquainted with you, hoode hir and vnhood hir oftentimes, to the end she may the better abide the hoode.
But vse hir gently, and be pacient with hir at the first, and to the ende your hawke may be the better manned, the sooner reclaimed, you shall do wel to beare hir co~monly in places where most people do freque~t, and where most exercises are vsed.
And when she is well manned, make hir come a little to the fiste for hir meate.
And when you haue shewed hir the perche or stocke, and tyed hir vpon it, put with hir vpon the sayde pearche or stocke some Pullet, or other quicke fowle as often as you may, and let hir feede thereon at pleasure vntill she be reasonably gorged, and do in like maner vpo~ the lewer vntill she knowe it perfectly.
Afterwardes you may giue hir more libertie, and lewer hir with a cryance, lewring hir twice a daye further and further of.
And when shee is throughly lewred, you shall teache hir to flee vpon you, vntill she know bothe howe to get to hir gate, and to flee rownde vpon you.
Then shall you caste hir oute some quicke fowle, and when shee hath stowped and seazed vpon it, you shall suffer hir to plume it and to foote it at hir pleasure, giuing hir a reasonable gorge theron, as is before sayde, and continewing alwaies to rewarde hir vpon the sayde lewer, in such sort, that she neuer finde the lewer without some rewarde tyed vpon it, and by that meanes shee will alwayes loue the lewer and hir keeper well, and will not lightly rangle or be loste.
Thus you may continue hir fortie dayes, or thereaboutes, and then you may flee with hir safe ynough.
But before you so doo, lette hir bee skowred and bathed, and fedde with cleane meate, and well washed, gyuing hir casting euery nyght, euen as men vse to giue fleing hawkes.
The manner of fleyng with hawkes, as well to the fielde as to the Ryuer, and firste to the Ryuer, according as Martine teacheth.
YOu must vnderstande that the ryuer hawke ought to be let into the winde, and aboue hir praye to gette the vauntage of hir gate, and to be at hir pitche: then shall you make in towardes the praye.
And when they are gotte vp to their full pitche, runne vpon the fowle, and lande them, laying them out from of the water, and if you fayle in doyng therof, then you shoulde take downe your hawke with some pullete, Pigeon. or other quicke fowle, to teache, and the better to winne suche hawkes as are but lately entred, vntill they knowe their praye and their fleing perfectly.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of men, one on horseback, with dogs and birds] THere is another manner of fleing whiche is called the flight at the Hearon, this is the noblest flight of all others.
For the Hawke oughte to bee well lewred and well trayned to get vp to an high gate, and therewithall shee must well know a quicke fowle, and such a Falcon as is apte to flee, the Hearon shoulde not bee flowen with, to any other kind of fowle but onely to the Hearon most commonly.
For asmuch as amongst all other flights, there is no suche mountey made, nor suche force vsed as in the flight at the Hearon, and therefore reason would that such Falcons should not bee flowen withall or inured to any meaner or lesse pray than the Hearon.
For if a Hawke be a good Hearoner, it is sufficiente, and if after your Hawke haue flowen the Hearon, you should let hir flee any other sleighter fowle or pray, She will lightly (by your owne default) become a slugge and take disdayne, in suche sort that (where before she was a good Hearoner) shee will be so no more, and will turne to hir owne ease, so that she will neuer care to flee the Hearon.
For asmuche as shee will giue hir selfe to pray vppon fowle that is more easy to reach, and will forget or forslow hir valiant hardinesse, the whiche is much to be lame~ted if a man haue once a good Hearoner, and do so spill hir. Neuerthelesse you may flee with the Sacre all maner of fowle more easely than with any other kind of Hawke, bycause she is alike common to all fowle, euen so is she hard to be made, and of a hard and dull capacitie, but despaire not therefore, for in the end they proue good if the Falconer take suche paynes with them as he ought to doe.
For the flight to the field as Master Amé Cassian teacheth.
SOme kinde of Hawkes there bee whiche are made for the field.
For asmuche as there be some men which delight more to haue Hawkes for the field than for the riuer, the Hawkes which are good to flee the field, are first entred by the Spaniels, and aswell accustomed to knowe them by the heare and proportion, as they know their pray by the feather and flight, and secondarily they are also entred by customary knowledge of their pray, and therefore it is not lightly possible that this kind of pastime shoulde bee perfectly handled, vnlesse the dogges and Hawkes be so well aquainted and knowen one to the other, that each of them do loue others, for although naturally the Hawke be hardly entred to become familiar with the dogges, and will not lightly nor at the first loue them, yet maruayle you not thereat, for in the end all field Hawkes will loue them, and become familiar with them, but to bring that to passe, you must continually beare your Hawke amongst Spanyels, and aquaint hir with them, that she may the better abide them, and that beeing done, the oftner that youre Hawke flee the field, the truer you shall finde mine opinion: surely you may easely haue good Hawkes to the field, if you keepe them in good order and diet as reason requireth, giuing them vpon their first, second, and third pray, a reasonable good gorge, and afterwards you may withdraw and abate youre reward by little and little, to make your Hawke the easlyer forget it, for by that meanes you shall make youre Hawke knowe hir liue fowle the better, if you rewarde hir with the head and braynes of the fowle taken, and so of euery one which she shall slay, vntil you would giue hir a gorge, at time and houre conuenient, and by that meanes, you maye haue a good field Hawke vnlesse the fault be your owne.
THere is yet another kynde of flight to the field which is called the great flight, as to the Cranes, wilde Geese, Bustarde, Bird of Paradise, Bittors, Shouelers, Hearons, and many other suche lyke, and these you maye flee from the fiste, whiche is properly tearmed the Source.
Neuerthelesse in this kinde of Hawking whiche is called the greate flighte, the Falcons or other Hawkes cannot well accomplish their flight, at the Crane, Bustard or suche lyke, vnlesse they haue the help of some Spanyell or suche dogge, well inured and taught for that purpose with your Hawke.
For asmuch as great flights require pleasant ayde and assistance, yea and that with great diligence.
Aduertisement giuen by Master Martine to make a Hawke bolde and hardy, and to loue hir pray.
IF you woulde haue your Hawke hardy, keepe hir oftentimes all day long vpon your fiste, and feede hir with Pullets flesh earely in the morning asmuch as shall be sufficient for a beaching, that done set hir abroade in the Sunne, with water before hir, to the end she may bathe when she will, and bowze, as naturally they are enclined to do, and it doth them singular great pleasure, for bowzing may oftentimes preserue them from sicknesse, and yet sometimes a Hawke bowzeth after some disease whereof she hath long languished, and dieth, or else she is thereby recured: for after such a disease, bowzing doth eyther cure hir or quite dispatch hir. Nowe when you haue done as is before sayde (whether she bathe or not) you shall take your Hawke vppon your fiste, and so keepe hir on the fiste vntill you go to bedde, and when you go to bedde set a candle before hir, whiche maye last all the night, and in the morning (if she did bath) you shall set hir in the Sunne for one houre vntill she be well wetherd, and then afterwards (if she did not bathe) take wine and water, and therewith bespout hir well with your mouth three houres after, setting hir in the Sunne agayne, and (for lacke of Sunneshyne) before the fire, vntill she bee very well dried, and if you bee well assured that she is throughly enseamed cleane, and hathe bin well manned by the space of thirty or fortie dayes, then maye you flee the fielde with hir, and if you perceiue that she haue good desire to flee, let hir flee, and if she kil any thing, giue hir a good gorge therevpon, but if she kill nothing, then feede hir with the legge or the wing of an Henne or a Pullet, washed in cleane running water, keeping hir still vppon the fiste as is before sayde: and the next day flee with hir agayne, and if she kill any thing, giue hir hir rewarde, and keepe hir in this order vntill she be perfectly entred and quarred: but then you must haue discretion, for sometimes by thys order you may bring hir lowe, in suche sorte that she shoulde not easely be recouered to make hir flight strongly.
Yet Martine sayth the contrary, but if an Hawke be very harde and stubborne to hir keeper in hir flight, then let hir be well spowted agayne with luke warme water, and so set abroade all night in the open ayre.
In the morning let hir be set eyther in the Sunne or before the fyre, where when shee hathe well proyned hir you maye goe flee with hir, and if she kill and flee well, then keepe hir in thys order and tune, for else she maye take sundrie euill toyes.
And thys precepte serueth as well for them that desire to haue good Hawkes for the fielde as otherwise: and if you woulde haue your Hawkes loue theyr pray, take Cynamon and Sugercandie, of each a lyke quantitie, and make thereof a powder, and when youre Hawke hathe kylled anye thyng, and that you come to reward hir, sprinkle some of that powder vpon the parte wherewith you rewarde hir, and it shall make hir loue that kynde of pray the better euer afterwardes.
IF you haue Eyasse Hawkes, you shall feede them moste with Pultrie, Beefe, or Gotes fleshe: and thys is done to keepe them from ill toyes: and when they be well lewred and trayned, then beare them vppon the fiste hooded, and ordred in all poyntes according to the rule prescribed before in the fyrste Chapiter, and after xxx. or xl. dayes past, bring them to the flighte, and the first, seconde, and thirde flight, you maye bee fonde ouer them, abating your fauor afterwardes by little and little, vntill they bee brought in perfect tune, spowting them oftentimes with wine and water.
For (as Martine sayeth) some Eyasse Hawkes wyll not muche bathe them.
Neuerthelesse you ought therein also to vse discretion, for by often bathing or spowting, you maye bring youre Hawke very lowe, in suche sort that shee shoulde haue more neede of a good gorge, than of bathing, or spowting, and especiallye suche Hawkes as are fierce of nature, and wyll not often bathe of themselues.
consideration of the diuersitie of Hawkes natures, according to Martine.
THere are some sortes of Falcons whyche haue thys diuersitie of nature, that some of the~ well flye well beyng high and full of fleshe, and some other flee best when they are kept lowe.
Wherefore a Falconer should haue especiall consideration therevnto, for Falcons are fitte for all flightes, as is before sayde, but the blanke Falcons are of one nature, and the blewe Falcons of another, and the Falcon of the reddish plume hathe also hir properties diuers from the rest.
Neuerthelesse to speake as haue founde, of all other Hawkes the blancke Falcon is beste.
And bothe by reason and experience fynde that shee would be kepte higher and in better plight than other Hawkes, for you shall see the blancke Falcon keeping a lyke hand vppon hir and other Falcons proue higher and in better plight when shee is fleeyng than any other Hawke.
And the reason is, bycause shee is very gentle, and with more ease manned than any other kynde of Falcon, and loueth hir keeper better, so that thereby shee keepeth hirselfe higher and in better plighte than suche Hawkes, as bate muche and are frowarde of condition.
(&becaus) Howe to seele a Sparowhauke and to make hir fleing according to Guillam Tardif.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of sparrowhawk] Sparowhawke newly taken should be thus vsed, take a needle thredded with vntwisted threde, and (casting your Hawke) take hir by the beake and put the needle through hir eye lidde, not right againste the sight of the eye, but somewhat nearer to the beake, bicause she may see backewardes.
And you muste take good heede, that you hurt not the webbe, whiche is vnder the eyelydde, or on the inside thereof.
Then put your needle also through that other eyelydde, drawing the endes of the thredde togither, tye them ouer the beake, not with a streight knotte, but cut off the thredes endes neare to the knotte, and twiste them togither in suche sorte, that the eyeliddes may be raysed so vpwardes, that the hawke maye not see at all, and when the threade shall waxe loose or vntyed, then the hawke may see somewhat backwardes, whiche is the cause that the thredde is put nearer to the beake.
For a Sparowhawke should see somwhat backewards, and a Falcon forwards.
The reason is, that if the Sparowhawke shold see forewardes, she would beate of hir feathers, or breake them when she bateth vpon the fiste, seeing the company of men, or suche like, she would bate to muche.
But to trimme your Sparowhawke in hir rightes, shee must haue Iesses of lether, the whiche muste haue knottes at the ende, and they shoulde be halfe a foote long, or thereabout, at the leaste a shaftmete betwene the hose of the Iesse, and the knotte at the ende, whereby you tye the hawke.
She should also haue twoo good belles, whereby she may be the better hearde.
For commonly when a Sparowhawke taketh any praye, she will carry it into some thicke bushe to feede thereon, in suche sorte, that she cannot lightly be eyther hearde or seene, and whiles she plumeth it, the plumage doeth oftentimes couer bothe hir eyes, or one of them, then to take awaye the saide plumage, she straineth with one of hir feete, and therby hir belles discouer hir.
Therefore if shee had but one bell, she might happen to scratte with that foote whiche lacketh the bell, and so shoulde not be hearde.
The Sparowhawkes which are wonted to be hooded, and whiche will gently brooke it, are muche better than they which will not be hooded.
For they bate lesse, and are with more ease borne in the rayne, or any euill weather.
For beeing hooded, the Falconer may hyde and couer them with his cloke, which he cannot do to the other.
Furthermore they shall be able to flee better and more strongly, that are good weather hawkes, for they shall be lesse brused, than a hawke whiche is not hooded, whiche will weary hir selfe with bating, withall a man may the better flee with the~ at aduantage, bicause they bate not, but onely when you woulde haue them to flee, whereby they haue the greater courage, and also a man may beare them in all places, without bating or beating themselues out of breath.
Hovve a man shoulde manne a Sparowhavvke, and make hir fleing.
FOr as muche as Sparowhawkes are of sundrye sortes of plumes, and sundry shapes and proportions, there are also sundry manners of manning them and making them, there is muche lesse paynes to bee taken with some one, than with some other.
For the more eager and sharper sette that a Sparowhawke is, the sooner shall you winne hir, and man hir. Firste, to winne hir to feede, rubbe hir feete with warme fleshe, chirping and whistling to hir, and sometimes present the fleshe vnto hir beake, and if she will not yet feede, rubbe hir feete with a quicke birde, and the birde will crye, and if the Sparowhawke doe seaze it with hir feete, it is a token that she will feede.
Then teare off the skinne and feathers of the birdes breaste, and offer it to the hawkes beake, and shee wyll taste thereof.
For a Sparowhawke whiche feedeth immediately after she be taken, doth shewe that she is eager, and hath good appetite.
And you may giue hir as muche more at euening, yea and sometimes in the daye time, so that she be not gorged firste, but that she haue put ouer hir meate.
When she is thus well entred, and will feede when you chirpe or whistle to hir, then may you hoode hir with an hoode that is large and deepe ynough, so that it neither hurte nor touche hir eies, When she will indure to be hooded and vnhooded, without bating, and that she will feede hooded, then must you abate hir meales, giuing hir lesse meate, and feede hir betimes in the morning, when she hath endewed, (that is to say, when shee shall haue put ouer hir meate, so as there remayneth nothing in hir gorge) then may you giue hir a beaching in the daye tyme, taking off, and putting on agayne hir hoode, to make hir the more eager.
For it will not bee amisse, to gyue hir a bitte or twoo of meate euery time that you hoode hir.
When it is euening, then suppe hir vp, giuing hir the heade or braines of a Henne or Pullette, vntill the morning.
And if you perceyue that shee is becomme very eager, then loose the threade wherewith shee is seeled, but lette it bee nyghte firste, and that shee haue seene backewardes, as before sayde.
If shee maye abyde companie, yet watche hir all that nighte that you vnseele hir, to the ende shee may also bee accustomed to heare people speake, and bee acquaynted with them, and when you hoode hir agayne, giue hir twoo or three bittes of meate.
In the morning betimes, put a birde in hir foote, whome if shee seaze hardily, and plume thereon eagerly, then may you boldely take off hir hoode, but if shee bate then, hoode hir agayne, and watche hir vntill shee bee thorowly wonne and manned: but if she feede well before companie, and become familiar and quyete before them, watche hir no loger, but keepe hir on the fiste some parte of the nighte amongest companie, making hir to plume, giuing hir nowe and then a bytte or twoo of fleshe, and putting hir hoode on and off therewithall.
When you go to bedde, sette your hawke neare to your beddes headde, vpon some trestle or stoole, that you may wake hir often in the nighte.
Then rise before daye, and take hir vpon your fiste, and off with hir hoode, that shee may see the people about hir, and when shee beholdeth them, put a quicke birde in hir foote, as before sayd.
When she feedeth thervpon, hoode hir againe, giuing hir the reste of your bird hooded, and when it is further forth day, you may looke whether shee haue any thing in hir gorge, or not.
If she haue nothing aboue, giue hir some little beaching, and beache hir oftentimes before companie, hooding and vnhooding hir.
But at night she shoulde be alwayes vnhooded, that shee may see people, become acquainted with them, giuing hir to feede of a Hen or Pullet.
To heale ye places wher she was seeled, to the ende she may see the better, when yu goest to bedde, holde hir in a darke corner, and spirte a little water vpon hir heade, that she may frote hir eyes agaynst the pynions of hir wings.
Then in the morning when she perceyueth the daye light, and hath warme meate readie vpon your fiste, and is cleane loosed that shee maye see bothe before and behinde hir, and seemeth to be familiar and bolde amongst people, then may you make hir as before sayde.
But remember that you giue hir no plumage that daye, in whiche you haue giuen hir washt meate, yea and allowe hir no plumage vntil she be well manned.
For vntill she be throughly manned, she will not dare to caste.
Then if you woulde throughly man your Sparowhawke, and keepe hir eagre, take hir earely in the morning vpon your fiste, and go into some place where no body shall interrupt you, where firste cause hir to plume with hir beake vpon some quicke birde, then vnseaze hir, and set hir vpon some thing, and reache hir your hande, and shew hir your siste, giuing hir a bitte or two thereof.
And if she come therevnto willingly, then call hir agayne morning and euening, further and further of, but euer before company, to acquaynt hir the better with them, fastning a long line or cryance vnto hir limmes: if it be faire weather, and that the Sunne shine, you shoulde then proffer hir the water, to the ende shee maye bathe hir. Prouided alwayes in so doing that she be sounde, well manned, and that she be not poore, nor gorged.
For bathing is a thing whiche maketh a hawke familiar and lustie, But remember yt alwayes after she haue bathed, you giue hir some lyue birde to feede on, and alwayes when you call hir or feede hir, you muste chirpe with your mouth, or whistle, to the ende she may becomme acquainted with your whistle, and come therevnto.
You must feede hir amongst horses dogges, to make hir also the better acquainted with them.
If she haue flowen, and you woulde sette hir in the Sunne to weather, sette hir vpon the ground on some coodgell or truncheon, making hir faste, and she will alwayes loue the better to sitte vpon the grounde.
After she hath bathed, if you perceyue your Sparowhawke lustie, you maye flee with hir the nexte daye towardes the euening, but firste you muste haue reclaymed hir to come out of a tree, and called hir to you sitting on horse backe, being alwaies prouided of some Pigeon, or other quick thing, to take hir downe the more easily.
For before a man flee with a Sparowhawke, she shoulde be throughly well reclaimed, by watching, carying, feeding, and pluming before people, that shee loue hir keepers fiste, and his countenaunce, that she can abyde both horses and dogges, that she be cleane within, as well skowred with washt meate, as also with plumage, and thaf shee bee sharpe sette, and well comming, as well from the pearche, as from of the grounde, or out of a tree. (&becaus) The meane to make a Sparowhawke fleeing.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of sparrowhawk] FIrste, hee that woulde flee with a Sparowhawke lately reclaymed, muste flee in an euening somewhat before Sunnesette: For at that tyme shee will bee moste eager and sharpest sette.
Secondarily, the heate of the Sunne (if one shoulde flee in the morning) doeth muche trouble the hawke, and rayseth and stirreth hir courage, making hir prowde and ramage.
So that she leeseth the eagernesse of hir appetite, and remembreth it not, thinking on nothing else but to soare and gadde abroade, whereby she may be easily loste.
Furthermore, towardes the euening she ca~not soare so far away from you, (although she should soare) as she would do in the heate of the daye, bycause the night will enforce hir to go to the perche and stande.
Also to enter your Sparowhawke, it shall be beste to seeke out some champaygne countrie, farre from the wooddes, and let hir be vnhooded when the Spaniels be vncoupled, then if the Partridge spring, and she bate, cast hir off, if they spring neare you.
And if she kill, reward hir (vpon the grounde) of the heade, braynes, necke, and breaste of the Partridge.
When she hath fedde, take it from hir, and vnseaze hir, and gette vpon your horse a good waye from hir.
Then whistle and call hir, and if shee come vnto you, rewarde hir better.
Aboue all things, you muste take good heede that she fayle not hir firste flyghte at greate birdes, leaste shee turne tayle, and accustome hir selfe to smaller game.
But if shee bee once well entred at great game, you may quickly make hir flee Larkes and small birdes.
If you finde that she haue most minde to flee Larkes, lette hir flee them, and rewarde hir on them.
For there is no flyghte pleasaunter than the flyghte of the Sparowhawke at the Larke.
And for as muche as the fleshe and bloude of Larkes is hotte and burning, it shall bee good when you flee the Larke, to gyue your hawke washte meate twyce in a weeke, and plumage very often.
But gyue hir no plumage that daye that shee hath washte meate, nor the daye that she batheth.
When there is a knotte of good companie mette togither, and euery man hath his Sparowhawke, if one of the~ see his Sparowhawke flee whe~ another is also from the fiste, there beginneth the pastime, yet they may flee togither.
But it is a pleasure to take a Larke lowring, or clyming.
Or if a Sparowhawke haue beate~ downe a Larke, or that ye Larke be slipte from hir, and gotten vp towring as hyghe as a man maye beholde, and then an other Sparowhawke clime after hir, get so high that by often taynting hir, so as the Larke is constrayned to stowpe to the grounde, and the hawke in the tayle of hir.
Then the Larke had rather flee for succoure betweene the legges of the men and the horses, than to fall in the tallauntes of hir naturall enimie: yet commonly shee is there taken also.
Hee that woulde learne to make a Falcon well, lette him beginne with a Hobbie, and hee that woulde make the Gerfalcon flying, let him acquaynte himselfe with the Merlyne.
But hee that can keepe and make a Sparowhawke well, shall also be able to keepe a Goshawke, for by the one that other is learned.
TO remoue the lyme from a hawke, take dry and fine sande and cleane ashes mingled togither, put them vppon the place whiche is lymed, and suffer it so one nyght.
Afterwarde you shall beate well togither three yolkes of egges, and with a feather you shall laye them vpon the sayde places, and suffer the~ so twoo nights.
Then take as much larde as a plumme. and as muche butter with it, melt them bothe togither, and anoynte the sayde places, and suffer the hawke so one other nyght.
Then on the morrowe washe hir with warme water, and wype hir with a cleane lynnen clothe, vntyll you haue wyped of all the lyme, whiche by this deuise will easily bee remooued.
YF you woulde make sounde a brused feather, then temper yt place which is brused, in warm water, whe~ the webbe thereof is well softened, and becomme tender with the hotte water, sette it as euen as you can out of the water.
Afterwardes take a greate stalke of a Colewoorte, and warme it well vpon the coales, or in the flame: then cleaue it in sunder, and within the clyfte put the brused feather, strayning the twoo sides of the Colewoorte stalke togither, vntyll it haue broughte the brused feather into his former estate.
The stalke of the herbe called Brionie, hath the same vertue.
To right and mende a feather broken on the one side, and to ympe a broosed feather.
TAke a slender long needle, laye it in Vineager, or salte water, that it maye ruste and so holde the better within the feather: Afterwardes threade it with vntwisted threade, and drawe it through bothe endes of the brused places, then draw it backe by the threade, vntill it may draw that one part to that other, so as the webbe may bee close ioyned togither: and suffer not your hawke to flee, nor to vse hir wings, vntill it bee closed and strong agayne.
But if it were broken on bothe sydes, cutte it off, and take a square ymping needle, like vnto a Glouers needle, laye it in Vineager and salte water, and thruste it into bothe the endes of the webbe, vntill you haue brought them togither: then giue your hawke reste vntill the needle bee rusted in that webbe.
For a feather that is broken or brused within the quyll, take another quill that is lesser, that it may go into the broken or brused quyll, then cutte off the feather in that place, and the stalke of the quyll beeing put into the olde quill, force the ende of the feather into the newe quill that is cutte: Afterwardes ioyne togither the twoo peeces, with the quill that is so put in, couering the place where it is so ioyned, with Cotton or small downe feathers, with glewe or Semonde, or if you woulde not ympe it, glewe it in with Semonde or Rosen and waxe molten togither.
If the feather bee dropte away cleane, then put in another of like syze and colour.
For to bynde in a feather that were slipped out of the pynion, take flexe small chopped, and myngled with the yolke of an egge well beaten, put them togither vppon a lynnen clothe, whiche is very neare worne, with the whiche you shall bynde on bothe sides the place where the feather slypped, or else anoynt that place with Myrre and Goates bloude myngled togither.
To make a feather come agayne, whiche is caste and loste by bruse or otherwise, and especially in the trayne of an hawke, take oyle of Walnuttes, and oyle of Bayes, as muche of that one as that other, myngle them togither, and droppe them into the place where the feather grewe, and it shall put out a newe feather speedely. (&becaus) Howe to beare and make a Falcon.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of falcon] Falcon lately taken, shoulde bee seeled in suche sorte, that when the seeling beginnes to slacken, the Falcon maye see forwardes, to see the meate before hir.
For shee is better content when shee seeth the meate plainely before hir, than if shee sawe it sidewayes, or looking backe.
And shee shoulde not bee seeled too strayght, neyther yet oughte the threede wherewith shee is seeled, be ouerstreyght bownde or knitte aboue hir heade, but twysted and twyrled togythers.
hawke newly taken, shoulde haue newe furniture, as newe Iesses, Leasse, and Bewettes, all of good leather, and the Iesses mayled, and the Lease made with a button at the end.
The muste you haue a little rownde stycke hanging in a little string, with the whiche you shall oftentymes stroke and handle your Falcon.
For the more shee is handled, the better shee wyll bee manned, and becomme the gentler, and the more familiar: and also if you shoulde stroke or handle hir with your hande, you myght chaunce to catche a knappe of hir beake nowe and then.
She must haue twoo good belles, to the ende she may the better be founde and hearde, when she stirreth or scratteth.
She muste haue a hoode of good leather, well made and fashioned, well raysed and bossed agaynst hir eyes, deepe, and yet streyght ynough beneathe, that it may the better abyde on hir heade, and yet neuer hurte hir.
So must you also a little cope hir beake, and tallans, but not so muche that you make them bleede.
Howe you shall manne a Falcon, and bring hir out of hir ramagenesse.
SOme saye, that the soare Falcon whiche hath bene tymely taken, hath already passed the seas, is both the best Falco~, also the hardest to be wonne ma~ned.
Wherfore obseruing the order which is before rehearsed, you must feede such a Falco~ wt good warm metes (as pigeo~s, such like quick birds) vntil she be full gorged twice a daye for three dayes.
For you must not breake hir of hir accustomed dyet all at once, and beeyng lately taken, shee will more willingly feede on warme meates, than any thing else.
When you feede hir, you muste whoope and lewre as you do when you call a hawke, that shee maye knowe when you wyll gyue hir meate.
You muste vnhoode hir gently, gyuing hir twoo or three byttes, and putting on hir hoode agayne, you muste giue hir as muche more.
But take heede that shee bee well and close seeled, three dayes beeyng passed, if you perceiue hir to bee eager and greedie of meate, and that she feedeth with good appetite, then begynne to abate hir hir meate, that is to saye, gyue hir but lyttle at once, and often, so that shee haue not muche aboue at one time, vntill it bee euening, and beare hir late vpon your fiste before you go to bedde, setting hir vpon a trestle or stoole very neare you, so that you maye wake hir often in the nyghte.
Afterwardes you shoulde take hir on your fiste agayne before daye, with some quycke birde or suche like meate: and when you haue obserued this order with hir twoo or three nyghtes, and that you perceyue she beginnes to bee muche better fellowe than shee was wonte, and that shee seemeth to beginne to bee reclaymed, and feedeth eagerly vpon good meate, then beginne to chaunge hir dyete, gyuing hir often, and little at ones, the harte of an Hogge or a Sheepe.
In the euening when it beginnes to bee late, (without casting of hir) lette hir seeling threade a little loose, spowting water on hir face, that shee maye Ieouke the lesse, and watching hir all the nyght, holde hir vpon your fiste vnhooded.
But if she see any thing that muslike hir, and make semblaunte to bee afearde, then lette hir bee carryed into some darke place, where you haue no more but lyght to hoode hir agayne.
And afterwardes gyue hir some beaching of good meate, and lette hir bee watched diuers nyghtes togither, vntill shee bee reclaimed and Ieouke vpon the fiste by daye time, although to lette hir Ieouke also sometimes in the nighte, is a thing whiche maketh hir the sooner manned.
In the morning by breake of the daye, lette hir haue some warme meate to beginne with.
And bicause there bee sundrie Falcons of sundry sortes and conditions, (as some mewed at large in the wooddes, some other taken at stande, where they haue long vsed, and some other taken soare hawkes, (whereof we now treate) whither they bee Sorehawkes, mewed or Nyasse, yet are they of sundrye natures and properties, and therefore they muste bee diuersly gouerned and entred, which is the cause that it is harde to giue generall rules.
For those whiche are gentle, easie to bee reclaymed, and of a good kinde and nature, ought also to bee the more fauoured, and the more gently handled.
But when your hawke is broughte to the poynte before rehearsed, as well for the hooding, as also for hir eagernesse to feede, if you perceyue that shee beginne to bee acquaynted therewith, you maye vnhoode hir by daye time, farre from company, firste gyuing hir a bytte or twoo of good meate.
Afterwardes hoode hir agayne gently, gyuing hir a little meate againe hooded.
Aboue all things, you muste beware to hoode or vnhoode hir in any place, where shee maye bee frayed, for that were able to marre hir at the firste.
When shee beginneth to bee acquaynted with companie, if you perceyue that shee bee eager or sharpe sette, vnhoode hir, and giue hir a bitte or twoo of meate, holding hir right againste your face and countenaunce.
And when it is night, cutte the thredde wherwith shee is seeled, and you shall not neede to watche hir, if you perceyue hir bolde ynough amongest companie.
But yet lette hir bee sette vpon a trestle by you, that you may awake hir twoo or three times in the nighte, and take hir on your fiste before daye.
For ouerwatching of a hawke is not good, as long as a man may reclayme hir otherwise.
And if by suche good gouernmente, and by dealing curteousely with hir, and keeping hir from sodayne feare, you perceyue that shee beginne to bee acquaynted with you, and to knowe you assuredly, and that shee feedeth eagerly, and sticketh to hir meate before companie, then giue hir washte meate, and beache hir in the morning, so that shee maye alwaies haue somewhat in hir gorge: whiche meate you shall laye in cleare water halfe a daye, and you shall cause hir to feede in companie, giuing hir in the morning aboute Sunne rising the wing of a Henne or Pullette, and at euening, hooding hir againe, take the foote of a Conie or an Hare, whiche is cutte off aboue the ioynte, and flaye it, stripping awaye the clawes also, and temper and steepe the skinne in faire water, (pressing and wringing it a little) the whiche you shall giue hir with the ioynte of the pynion of a Hennes wing.
You muste take good heede, howe you giue your hawke any feathers, vntill shee bee throughly reclaimed.
For vntill shee bee throughly wonne and reclaymed, shee dares not caste vpon the fiste.
And on the fiste you muste beare hir continually, till shee bee throughly manned.
But when shee makes semblante to caste, vnhoode hir gently by the tassell of the hoode.
You maye giue hir two dayes washte meate, and the thirde daye plumage, according as shee is cleane or fowle within.
And when shee hath caste, then hoode hir agayne, gyuing hir nothing to feede on, vntill she gleame after hir casting.
But when shee hath caste and gleamed, then gyue hir a beaching of hotte meate, in companie gyuing hir twoo or three byttes at once: and at euening make hir plume a Hennes wing in companie also.
When you finde hir well reclaymed, and throughly manned, and eager, and sharpe sette, then it is tyme to feede hir vpon the lewer.
And you muste marke whither the feathers of your hawkes casting be fowle or slymie, and whither the slyme thereof be yellowe or not.
For if they bee, you muste bee very circumspect to make hir cleane with washte meate and casting, and if shee be cleane within, then giue hir not so strong castings, as Hares feete, or Connyes feete: but giue hir the pynions of an olde Hennes wing, or the plumage that is to bee taken therevpon, or the necke bone chopped foure or fiue times betweene the ioyntes, washed, and steeped in faire water.
To make an ende of this chapter, it is certayne, that it requireth more tyme to winne and to watche a Falcon once mewed in the woodde, than one whiche is taken sore at passage.
And likewise it is harder to winne a hawke taken at stande, when she hath long time bene accustomed, than it is to make a hawke whiche hath bene handled before.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of falcon] BEfore you shew the lewre to a Falcon newly reclaymed, you must consider three things, First, that she be well assured and boldened in companye, well acquainted also with Dogges and with Horses.
Secondarily that she bee sharpe set and eager, hauing regarde to the houre of the morning or euening when you will lewre hir.
And the third consideratio~ is, that she bee cleane within, the lewre must bee well garnished with meat on both sides, and you must be apart in some secrete place whe~ you would giue hir the length of the lease.
You must first vnhood hir, giuing hir a bit or twayne vppon the lewre, as she sitteth on youre fiste, afterwardes take the lewre from hir, and hide it that she see it not, and when she is vnseazed, cast the lewre so neare hir that she may catche it within the length of hir lease, and if she do seaze vpon it, then shall you vse the voyce and accustomed speache of a Falconer vnto his Hawke, and feede hir vpon the lewre on the ground, gyuing hir thervpon the warme thigh of an Henne or Pullet, and the hart also.
When you haue so lewred hir at euening, giue hir but a little meate, let hir be lewred so timely, that when she is therewith accustomed, you maye giue hir plumage and a Iuk of a ioynt.
Afterwardes, and in the morning betimes, take hir on your fiste, and when shee hathe cast and gleamed, giue hir a little beaching of good warme meate.
Afterwardes when the daye is further forwardes, and that it is tyme to feede hir, take a Criance and tie it to hir lease, and goe into some fayre pleasaunt meadowe, and giue hir a bitte or two vppon the lewre, as before said, then vnseaze hir, and if you perceyue that she be sharpe set, and haue seazed vppon the lewre eagrely, then gyue hir to holde vnto some man whiche may let hir off to the lewre, then shall you vnwinde the Criance, and drawe it after you a good way, and hee whiche holdeth the Hawke must holde his right hande on the tassell of the Hawkes hood in a readinesse, that hee maye vnhood hir as soone as you begin to lewre, and if she come well to the lewre, and stoupe vppon it roundly, and seaze it eagerly, let hir feede two or three bittes vppon it, and then vnseaze hir, and take hir from off the lewre, and hood hir, and then deliuer hir agayne to hym whyche helde hir, and goe further off and lewre hir, feeding hir alwayes vpon the lewre on the grounde: and vsing the familiar voyce of Falconers as they crie when they lewre.
And thus you shall lewre hir euery day further and further off, vntill shee bee well taught to come to the lewre, and to take it eagrely.
Afterwardes let hir bee lewred in companye, hauing regarde that neyther Dogges nor other thyng come in suddaynly to fray hir, and when you take hir vp from the grounde, hood hir vppon the lewre, and when you haue well and often lewred hir on foote, then vse to lewre hir on Horsebacke: the whiche you shall the easlyer winne hir too, if when you lewre hir on foote, you cause some on Horsebacke to come neare you, that she may see them, and cause them to come neare hir when shee feedeth vppon the lewre, causing them also to turne and tosse theyr Horses aboute hir, but let their Horses be ruly, least they shoulde vppon the suddayne affright hir.
Furthermore the better to acquaint hir with horses, and that she maye the better knowe them, carrie youre Falcon (whiles shee feedeth) on high vppon the lewre neare vnto some man on Horsebacke, or get your selfe vp on Horsebacke, and rewarde hir vpon the lewre amongst horsemen, and when shee is well accustomed to them and well acquaynted with them, making no resemblance to feare them, you may then lewre hir on horsebacke in this manner: Hee whiche holdeth hir to let hir come to the lewre must bee on foote, and you where you lewre shall bee on Horsebacke, and when you call and cast the lewre about youre heade, then hee whiche holdeth hir, shall take off hir hood by the tassell, and you the meane while shall call and lure in the counningest wise you can, as Falconers vse to do: and if she seare eagerly vpon the lewre, and feare neyther people nor horses, then take off the lewring line or Creance, and lewre hir loose further and further off.
And to make a Falcon come which is but newly reclaymed, and to make hir come in company of another Hawke, there must be two to hold a cast of Falcons, and two which shall lewre them, but he whiche holdeth the Falcon that is but lately lewred, shall not let hir come so soone as the other shall doe: then shall the lewre be throwen out vnto the Falcon whiche is but lately lewred, and when she is fallen thervppon, hir keeper shall carrie hir vppon the lewre, to feede amongst the other make Hawkes.
This being done twice or thrice, shee will followe them and loue them: and if you would haue hir loue dogges whiche is most necessary, you muste call dogges about you when you feede hir, or giue hir tyring or plumage.
How you shall bathe your Hawke being but lately reclaymed, how you shal make hir fleing, and to hate the cherke.
WHen your Falcon is well lewred aswell on horsebacke as on foote, and that she is ready to be caste off, and hathe bene well rewarded vpon the lewre, and is now altogither reclaymed from hir ramage toyes, and when she is also somewhat recouered of the paine and trauayle which you haue put hir vnto in making and reclaiming hir, and bee yet in good plight, and haue hir thighes ploompe and well brawned, then offer hir water to bathe hir, spie out a fayre day when the weather is cleare and temperate, then take a basyn so deepe that your Hawke may stand therein vp to the thighes, and fill it with water, and set it in some secret place: afterwards your Hawke being lewred and well rewarded in the morning with warme meate, beare hir vp vnto some high place, or banke, and there hold hir in the sunne vntill shee haue endued hir gorge, taking off hir hood, that she may proyne and picke hir selfe: that being done, hood hir agayne, and set hir neare to the bason, afterwards taking off hir hood agayne (if she will) let hir leape downe into the bason or vpon the grasse by it, and to make hir know the water, flappe therein with a little wand, and let hir bathe therein as long as she list: when she commeth out of the water, take some meate in thy hande and proffer it vnto hir, and be well ware that she come not out before thou proffer hir thy fiste to giue hir a bit or twayne, then take hir vp and hold hir in the Sunne, and she will picke and proyne hir on your fiste, or vppon your: knee if she will not bathe hir in a basyn, then proffer hir to bathe in riuer water at some foord.
Bathing giueth an Hawke great courage, much boldnesse, and eager appetite: that daye that she batheth, giue hir nowasht meate.
To make a new lewred Falcon, and to make hir vpwardes, the morow after she hath bathed, get on horsebacke in the morning or in the euening, when she is sharpe set, and choose out some field or pasture, where fewest dooues or choughes be, then take your lewre well garnished on both sides, hauing vnhooded youre Hawke, giue hir a bit or twayne vppon the lewre, then taking it away from hir, hood hir agayne, then going fayre and softly against the winde, vnhood hir: and before she bate or find any checke in hir eye, whistle hir from off your fiste fayre and gently, and when she flyeth about, (trotting forwards with your horse) cast our your lewre, and suffer hir not long to flee about you at the first.
Continue this both morning and euening for a fewe dayes, and if you perceyue that your Hawke haue no great list to flee about you, nor to stoupe to the lewre, and that shee maketh no semblaunce to loue other Hawkes, then must you make hir flee with one which loueth other Hawkes, and which will not gadde out to any chaunge or checke: and that must first be done at the partridge, for they flee not farre before an Hawke: and if youre Falcon haue flowen, and returne to you twice or thrice, cast out the lewre vnto hir, and reward hir vpo~ your Horsebacke, and afterwards feede hir vp, on the lewre vppon the grounde with good hote meate, to make hir resolute in hir fleing, and that shee may retourne to you with the better will, and if the fowle which you flew vnto be killed by any other Hawke, let your Hawke feede with the other Hawke, and when she is so rewarded a little, take hir off, and feede hir vpon the lewre.
If you flee to the riuer with youre Falcon, and that the flight be fayre and likely to be landed, stay, and drawe vnder the wind, and taking off your Hawkes hood, cast hir off with the rest.
Whe~ you would haue your Hawke prooue vpwards and a high flying Hawke, you must let hir flee with a very high fleeing Hawke, but see that your Hawke be well taught to hold in the head, and that she loue well to flee with the other Hawkes, and if the fowle be in a poole, or on a pitte or plash, you must first cast off the high fleeing Hawke, and hee which holdeth your new lewred Hawke, shall do well to get him vnder the wind, and when hee seeth his vantage let hym vnhood hir, and if shee bate then it is to get vp to the other Hawke.
Then let him cast hir off and she will climbe against the wind right vnto the high fleeing Hawke, and before shee weery hirselfe too much with climbing to reache or couer that other Hawke, lay out the fowle, whe~ the high fleeing Hawke shall be at hir pitch, and lay them out behind hir, if she kill the fowle, then giue your Hawke rewarde of the Harte and the brest with the other Hawkes.
If your Hawke go out to anye checke, and kill a Dooue or a Crow, or anye other checke and feede vpon it, or haue fedde vppon it before you come at hir, seeme not roughly to rebuke hir at first, but take hir downe to the lewre, giuing hir a bit of meate, and hood hir vp, and flee not with hir in two or three dayes after, but when you do flee, flee as neare as you can where there be no checke, but if by no meanes you can keepe hir from checking and going out, then for your last remedie, doe as followeth.
If youre Hawke haue killed a cheeke, and you come to hir before shee haue fedde thereon, take the gall of a Henne, and anoynte therewith the brest of the cheeke whiche she hath killed, when she hath plumed it and is come to the bloud, and let hir feede but little thereon, least you make hir sicke, for shee will surely cast it agayne, yea though she should not cast it, yet woulde shee haue small lust to flee at such a fowle againe, but wyll hate and loth the meate thereof, or put any bitter thing therevppon, as powder of mirre, or yong small woormes cutte in gobbets, but take heede that the bitternesse be not ouer strong, and if that the bitter tast haue discouraged the Hawke, then weate hir meate in sugred water.
Some put on two payre of belles vppon their Hawkes legges, or stitch togither theyr principall long feathers of their wings, and also it shall be good when she goeth from cheeke, to cast hir out the lewre, or to lay out an hurt fowle before hir which she may kill. (&becaus) How to flee the Hearon.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of men, one on horseback, with dogs and birds] TO make youre Falcon a good Hearoner, you must set hir very sharp, and haue a liue Hearon, wherof you shal make your Hawke a quarrey in this sort.
In the morning when it shall be time to feede your Hawke, if you perceyue that she be very sharp set, go to a meadow, and let the Hearon go after that you haue brused both his feete and his bill, and hide your selfe behind some bush: and then he which holdeth the Hawke shal vnhood hir, the which shal be vnder the wind.
And if your Hawke will not flee at the Hearon, cast out youre lewre the whiche you shall hold in a readinesse therefore: but if she doe seaze on the Hare, make hir a quarrey thereon, giuing hir first the Hart, and when she hath eaten it, giue the Hearon to him which helde the Hawke before, who retiring backe a little shall lewre, tossing the Hearon about his head, holding hir by one of the legges or wings: then do you vnhood your Hawke againe, and let hir flee to him which lewreth sowith the Hearon, and let him not cast it out vnto hir but stay vntil she take and seaze it in his hand as he lewreth with it: then despoyle the brest of the Hearon and let your Hawke feede vpon it, and take ye marrow of the bone in the Hearons wing, and giue it your Hawke: and in this doing two or three dayes you shall nowsel youre Hawke therevnto and make hir loue the Hearon, the whiche you shall also bring the sooner to passe, if at ye first you inure hir with a make Hawke a good Hearoner.
Then hauing found the Hearon at siege, you must get you with your Falcon vp into some high place, into the wind, and let him which hath the Hearoner (that is the male Hawke) put vp the Hearon, and when he hathe cast off his Hawke to hir, let him marke whether the Hearon do mount or not, for if she mount, then cast not off your Hawke, nor vnhood hir not, but if the Hearon seeme to be discomfited, and that she fall downe into the water, and that the make Hawke do stoupe hir, then vnhood your yong Hawke, and aduaunce hir: if she bate to bee gone, let hir flee to it.
How a man shall make his Hawke to loue other Hawkes, when she hateth to flee with them.
THere are some Falcons whiche will not flee with other Hawkes, but draw backward, and stirre not: some other will crabbe with euery Hawke, and flee of purpose to crabbe with them: some Falcon hateth to sitte or to flee with another Hawke, eyther for doubt and feare which she hath of them, or els for bicause she loueth the~ not.
That hawke which hateth other Hawkes doth crabbe with them, and she whiche feareth them, dothe flee from them.
For remedie heereof you muste haue a gentle Lanner, whyche maye bee sette on a pearche with that Hawke whyche hateth others, but farre ynough off, and by day light, then giue each of them a bitte of meate as you passe by them, and set them nearer and nearer, and when they bee neare one to another, put meate betweene them that both of them maye feede vppon it.
Then if the Falcon make no semblant to crabbe with the Laner, you shall gorge hir vp at night with good meate, and set hir abroade in the frost or colde vppon a pearche, if shee bee high and in good plight able to abyde it, and so shall you lette hir sitte three or foure houres.
In the meane time holde your Lanner neare to the fyre, and afterwardes take hir vppon your fiste, then lette another bring you your Falcon hooded, and holde hir close betweene your side and the Lanner, and when shee feeleth the warmth of the Lanner, shee will drawe to hir, and hugge to hir for the heate, and lette them stande so together without ieouking (eyther the one or the other) vntill you see that the Falcon doe greately desire to ieouke, then vnhoode hir fayre and softely, and let it be in suche a place as shee see not, but let hir sit so all the night vpon your fiste.
And when day appeareth, you must set them on the pearche that one neare to the other, yet so as they cannot one reache to another: That beeyng done two or three nightes togyther, lette them both be set abroade the third night in the cold, so neare that they maye sit close togyther on the pearche, and when you see them sit close that one to that other for warmth, then vnhood them, and afterwards feede them, pearche them, and lewre them both togither, and take payne to fynde the aduauntage.
How you shall enseame a Hawke, or giue hir castings, skourings. &c.
SOme Falcons be harder to enseame, than some others are, for the longer that a Falcon hath bene in the hande, the harder she is to be enseamed: and an olde mewed Falcon of the wood, whyche hath mewed but one cote in the Falconers handes, is muche easyer to be enseamed, than a yonger Falcon whiche hathe bene longer in the Falconers hands: the reason is, bycause a Hawke whiche prayeth for hir selfe, dothe feede cleaner, and better, according to hir nature, and vppon more holesome meates, than she doth when she is in mannes handes, so that it is no meruayle though she bee not so fowle within when she is at hir owne diet, as when another man feedeth hir.
For a Hawke whyche is in oure keeping dothe feede gredily both on skinne, feathers and all that commes to hand.
Neyther is shee mewed with so cleane and holesome feeding, nor dothe endue hir meate so well, nor hath suche open ayree at times conuenient as a Hawke whych is at large to pray for hir selfe.
When you draw your Hawke out of the mewe, if shee bee greasie (the whiche you shall knowe by hir thighes if they be rounde and fatte, and also by hir body if she be full in the hand, and that hir fleshe bee rounde as high as hir brest bone) and if shee bee well mewed, and haue all hir feathers full sommed, then giue hir when shee woulde feede in the Morning a bitte or two of hote meate, and at nighte giue hir but a little, vnlesse it bee very colde, and if she feede well without constreynt or forcing therevnto, then giue hir washt meate thus prepared: take the wings of a Henne or Pullet for hir dinner, and wash them in two waters, and if you giue hir Hares flesh or Beefe, let it be washt in three waters, on the morrow giue hir the legge of a Henne very hote, and at noone meate temperately warme, a good gorge, then let hir fast vntill it be late in the euening, and if she haue put ouer hir meate and that there be nothing left in hir gorge, then giue hir a little warme meate, as you dyd in the morning, and let hir thus be dietted vntill it bee time to giue hir plumage, the whiche you shall know by three tokens, the first is, that feeling the end of the pinion of the Hawkes wing, you shall feele the flesh as it were tenderer, and softer than it was before she eate washt meate: the seconde, if hir mewtes bee cleane and white, and that the blacke of the mewt be right blacke and not mingled with any other fowle thing or colour: the third token is, if shee bee very sharpe set and do plume eagerly, you maye giue hir casting eyther of a Hares foote or a Coonnies foote, or of the small feathers, which are on the ioynt of the pinion of an olde Hennes wing: take then the forefoote of a Hare, and beate it with the backe of a knife vntill the bones and clawes do fall out, bycause the small bones may mouldre and be all to frushed to peeces, the which you shall afterwards cut and lay it in fayre freshe water, then wring it, and giue hir it at two morsells, and when you set hir on the pearche, sweepe cleane vnderneath it that you maye see whether the mewte bee full of strakes or skinnes or not, and whether it bee full of slime and ordure or not, and if it bee, then continue this kinde of casting three or foure nights togither with washt meate as is before sayd, and if you perceyue the feathers disgested and soft, and that hir casting be great and full of ordure, then take the necke of an olde Henne, and cut it all alongst betweene the ioynts; and lay the ioynts in cleare cold water, and giue it to your Falcon without any other thing: and this is done bycause it beareth downe before it into the pannell, the meate which is vpon the ioynts, and there in the pannell the flesh co~sumeth and the bones remaine sharp pricking, which breake the kelles and skinnes, and the grosse ordure, and beare them with them: and giue hir so three nights togither, giuing hir by day washt meate as is before rehearsed, afterwardes giue hir casting or plumage agayne, according as hir state dothe require.
And thinke it not straunge that a Falcon which is to be enseamed, is sometimes a fortenight or more before shee will take casting: neyther yet that some Falcons will easiyer be enseamed in a month, than some other in fiue weekes, according as they be stronger or weaker of nature, and fedde with cleaner or fowler meates, or according as they haue bin shorter or longer time in mennes hands and keeping.
When you haue drawen your Falcon out of the mewe, and that hir principal feathers be ful sommed, or that she haue some yet in the quill, do not giue hir washt meate, but quicke birdes, and good gorges thereof, and set hir asmuche as may bee in open places, for otherwise hir feathers maye chaunce to shrinke in the quill, and come to nothing.
To enter or make a Hawke, after the fashion of Lombardy.
WHen a Sparowhawke is ma~ned and reclaymed, then giue hir nine or ten traynes at the least, and when she killeth, feede hir vp alwayes, and let the Quayle wherewithall you trayne hir, haue a feather pulled out of each wing, and cast off the Sparowhawke to hir a farre off, so often yt she wil recouer the Quayle farre off, and then cast hir out a Quayle which hath hir full wings, afterwards you may flee the wilde Quayle with hir: and euermore when she doth kill, feede hir vp with a full gorge: the Almaines are of opinion that the tercell of the Goshawke is more weightie and more valiaunt than the Hawke, both to Partridge and Feasant.
If you woulde make a Sparowhawke to the Pye, then dismember the Pye, and cast hir on the ground to the Hawke, and feede hir vpon hir with a hote meale, as with a Finche or suche lyke bird, vse that order with hir twice or thrice, and afterwardes you may cast vp a Pye to your Hawke that is seeled, beeyng dismembred as beforesayd, and let hir kill hir, and feede hir vpon hir, also you may take a feather or two out of the Pyes wing, and set hir vp in some tree, and let your Hawke kill hir there, and make hir as good reward as you can thereof, and this beeing thus vsed, you maye flee with your Hawke to the wild Pye, but euer remember that in making these trayns your Pye be disme~bred that is to say, hir bill and hir tallents cut off, or so tyed and abated that she may not spoyle or hurte your Hawke.
Goshawkes and Tercells of Goshawkes are better when they are taken haggards of a Cote or two Cotes out of the wood, than they are when they bee Sorehawkes, but then they must be kept with more delicate feede then the Soarehawkes, for they are made daungerous.
For asmuche as in the wooddes they did commonly pray vpon warme meates, and therewithall they are sooner lost than Sorehawkes be, by reason they remember their eyree, but they should not be aboue one or two Cotes at the most. (&becaus) To enseame a Falcon and to make hir.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of falcon] TAke your Falcon and vse hir as you vse the Goshawke in maner before declared, sauing that when you feede hir you shall call and lewre as if you called hir to the lewre: and euery day you shall proffer hir water, and euery night giue hir casting accordingly as you shall see that she endeweth: and take off hir hood often times amongst company, and to the end she shall not bate, hold alwais the hood by the tassell in your hand ready.
And in the euening when daylight beginneth to faile, take off hir hood amongst company of people by the candlelight vntill she rowze and mewte, and then set hir on ye perch and not before, and set light before hir, and when shee is well woonne to know the fiste, then begin to make hir knowe the lewre, and so by little and little reclayme hir, vntill you maye call hir loose without criance.
Euery Falcon hath neede of a make Hawke to teach hir to holde in the head, and especially the haggart Falcon, the which may be peraduenture an haggart of two or three cotes, yet shall be the better Hearoner: but if a haggart mewed will not hold in the head, then cutte off some part of hir two principalles in eache wing, the long feather and that which is next to it, and that shall force hir to hold in.
They always giue their Hawkes tyring both morning and euening, but the Falconers of the East parts are of a co~trary opinion and say that it weakeneth a Hawkes backe.
If you would make your Hawke vpwards or high flying, then after she is reclaymed and lewred and ready comming, when you lewre hir and that she commeth towards you, stoppe ye lewre vpon hir and let hir passe by you, and when she retourneth towards you throwe hir out the lewre, and make much of hir, and do thus oftentimes vntill you may suffer hir to flee lo~ger about you and to get vp higher, the whiche you must do in a plain field where no wood or trees are: and if she get vp to any pitch, then let hir flee a turne or two of iollity, and when she is at the highest and right ouer you, throwe hir foorth the lewre, or a Pigeon or Pullet, and giue hir a good gorge thereon, making the moste of hir that you can deuise, and take heede that you caste not your lewre into the water, least she shoulde thereby be rebuked.
And when she is at hir gate, if percase she gadde out after some checke, and kill it, then take the pray from hir angerly, and beate hir therewith about the head, and hoode hir vp without any rewarde: and hereby she will the lesse delyght to rake out after a checke.
When your hawke hath killed a fowle, take it out of hir foote, and cast hir vp againe, and when she is right ouer you, caste out the lewre, and feede hir vp vpon it, to make hir loue the lewer the better.
But at the beginning rewarde hir and feede hir well vpon the quarrey, and that shall encourage hir and keepe hir from going out to the checke.
When she is well in bloude, and well quarried, then let hir flee with other hawkes, vntill she be wel acquainted and inured.
If you would make your hawke to the Crane, take a Nyasse Falcon gentle, and in entring of hir let hir kyll the greatest fowle that you can finde.
And when you woulde make hir fleeing, lette hir flee from the fiste, and succour hir quickely.
For you muste haue dogges made for the purpose, whiche may helpe and succoure hir sooner than a man can doe.
And lette suche dogges feede alwaies with your hawke, to make them the better acquaynted.
If you woulde make a Falcon to the Hare, hir lewre should be then a Hares skinne stuffed with strawe, and when she is well lewred, that you would enter hir, tye the sayde Hares skinne to the ende of a cryance, and fasten it to your saddle pommell, and when you galloppe, it will be like vnto a running Hare.
Then vnhoode your hawke, and crye, Backe with the Greyhoundes, backe with the Greyhoundes.
And when your hawke commeth to seaze the sayde Hares skinne, lette go your cryance, and suffer hir to take it, and reward hir well vpon it, and make the most of hir that you can deuise.
And when you go about to enter hir ye second time, let not slyppe your cryance at the firste, but rather pull it from hir by force, and afterwardes let hir seaze vpon it, and so by little and little you shal teach hir to beate it and stowpe at it.
And you muste feede hir alwaies amongst the dogges, and when shee is well nousled and entred in this manner, take a lyue Hare, and breake one of hir hinder legges, and lette hir go in some fayre place amongest your dogges, and your Falcon wyll stowpe hir and ruffe hir, vntyll the dogges maye take hir.
Then take hir from the dogges, cast hir out vnto the hawke, crye backe, backe.
If you woulde make your hawke fleing to the Partridge, or Feasant, when she is reclaimed and made, then euery tyme that you lewre hir, caste your lewre into some lowe tree or bushe, that she may learne to take the tree, or the stande.
And if she take the stande before shee espie the lewre, lette hir stande a whyle.
And after drawe the lewre out before hir, and crye, Lo birde, lo, Hey lo birde, hey lo, and rewarde hir well.
For in this manner she will learne to take stande.
But feede hir alwayes on the grounde, and in some thicke place, for in suche places she muste encounter with the Feasant at pearche.
And at the firste flee with hir at Feasant, or Partridge that bee yong, to gyue hir the aduauntage, and afterwardes at the olde.
If a Falcon wyll not take stande, but wyll keepe hir on wing, then muste you flee with hir in playne places, where you may alwayes see hir vpon you.
Sacres and Laners will commonly take stande bothe in a tree, and on the grounde, but the Falcon Gentle taketh stande more willingly vpon the grounde.
And when you drawe a hawke out of the mewe, beare hir not muche in hotte weather, for feare leaste by muche bating in heate, shee may gette the Pantyse.
But if there be no remedie, then keepe hir alwayes hooded, and take as good heede to hir as you can.
If your hawke be coye and daungerous, then giue hir salte with hir meate, meane a dramme of the Salte called Sal Inde, or Sal geme, or Salis albi and gyue hir water, for shee shall haue neede thereof.
And make hir Ieouke all nyghte in payne, and in a moyste or colde place, and so shall she watche moste of the nyght, and thereby hir greace and pryde will be abated.
Sacres must be nowsled and entred as soone as they bee manned, for else they are very harde to bee entred.
Drawe your hawke out of the mewe twentie dayes before you enseame hir.
If a Falcon trusse and carrye, to remedie the same, you muste cope hir tallantes, hir powlse, and hir petie single.
Neuer rewarde your hawke vpon ryuer fowle, but rewarde hir, and make muche of hir vpon the lewre, to the ende she may the better knowe it and esteeme it.
The Souldane fleeth to the Crane, wilde Goose, and Bustarde, with three or foure hawkes at once (or more) from the fiste, yea and those of all kinde of hawkes also, as Sacres, Gerfalcons, peregrine Falcons, and Vilanes.
And afterwards a man may make them flee to the mowntie.
You shoulde flee to the Crane before Sunne rysing, for she is sluggishe and slowthfull, and you may caste off to hir a caste or a lease of Falcons, or you may hawke to hir with the Goshawke from the fiste without dogges.
And if you haue dogges to helpe succour your hawkes, see that they bee stanche and gentle, and well made for the purpose, and a Greyhounde will bee moste readily made therevnto.
You shall flee but once in a daye at the Crane, and therevpon rewarde hir liberally, and make as muche of hir as you can.
The Almaines doe flee at the Pye with a lease or twoo caste of Falcons at once, and they make them to mownte and to stowpe, as they doe at the Ryuer.
But this muste be in a playne, where there be no trees nor woodde, but little shrubbes and bushes.
If you vse to giue your hawke a brekefast or beaching very timely in ye morning, it wil make hir eager to flee at suche time as will be conuenient for hir to flee.
And especially a Falcon, whiche you woulde haue high fleeing, and those shoulde not be highly kepte, but shoulde be fedde nyne dayes togyther before Sunne rising, and at nyghte late in the freshe or coole of the euening.
So shall you make them highe fleeing, and by that meanes they wyll euery daye get gate higher higher, so yt they be flowen with euermore in the playne champaygne.
The Falcon gentle is commonly better inwarde when she hath mewed, than in hir soarage.
The Falcon will kill the Hearne naturally, if she be a peregrine Falcon, and yet you shall do well to giue them traynes.
Falcon may flee ten flightes at riuer in one day, if the season be not extreme, and that is the moste that you shall flee with hir.
The Falcons whiche are ryuer hawkes, shoulde alwaies be borne vpon the fiste.
hawke shall haue forty castings before she be perfectly made.
For a hawke whiche hath not casting euery nighte, will be surcharged with abundance and superfluitie of humors, the whiche do (from the stomacke) so ouerflow their brayne, that they cannot flee so high as else they would do.
And therefore all hawkes should haue casting euery night naturally, if you woulde haue them sounde and cleane: it is good to giue them tyring or plumage at nighte, especially field hawkes, but not ryuer hawkes, for weakening their backes.
And euery thirde daye you shall present them to the water at the longest.
Touche your hawkes fethers as litle as you can, for muche handling will make them out of order.
The Vyllaine and the Lanerette may be sette vpon the stone incontinently, as soone as they be made.
When your hawke hath flowen or bated, feede hir not as long as shee panteth, or bloweth, nor vntill she be in breath agayne.
For if you should it is perilous to bring hir into the disease called Astma, and (in a hawke) the Pantise.
If a hawke (eyther Falcon or other) chaunce to be out of heart, and discouraged, (which happeneth oftentymes) then take suche paynes with hir that shee may kill some praye, and feede hir vp vpon it with a full gorge euen as long as she will eate, and the same night sette hir abroade, that she may Ieouke in the open ayre at hir own pleasure: and on the morrowe take hir and feede hir with small birdes to enseame hir, neyther more nor lesse than you would do with an hawke that were newe drawen out of the mewe.
If a Falcon or other hawke will not seaze or gorge, take the quill of a wilde Gooses feather, and tye it vnder hir long single, and she will seaze and grype.
And when she beginneth to feaze, take away the sayde quyll, and shee will seaze long afterwards.
If you cannot giue couert to your Falcon, or your Goshawke, then caste hir off with the Sunne in hir backe.
All hawkes may be made flee at ye sowrce or spring.
But in what sorte soeuer you flee with your Goshawke, lette hir haue the Sunne in her backe.
ALl traines of Partridge, Rookes, Crowes, and Choughs, shoulde bee seeled.
Nowe to enter your hawke at any of them, make a lyttle pytte or hole in the grounde, and putte your trayne therein.
Then couer the hole with a little borde, the whiche you shall fasten to a small cryaunce or corde, and that you shall holde in your hande to drawe away when you lyst.
The~ you shall make as though you vncoupled your spanels to hunte and put vp the game, and you shall carry your hawke vnhooded.
And when you perceiue that your hawke looketh that way where you haue layed the trayne, then drawe of the borde, and cause the traine to spring as though the spanels had sprong it.
And if your hawke do take it, let hir feede thereon hir fill vpon the grounde: And thus must you do sundry times.
If you woulde haue a good hawke, then nowsel hir yong, for so will she encrease hir force by little and little, and in the ende, shee will ouercomme bothe Feasaunte and Partridge, &c.
And when shee hath killed, lette hir grype and seaze the praye at hir pleasure.
And lette hir also plume therevpon as long as she will, euermore let hir be rewarded vpon the grounde.
And when shee is well nowsled, then rewarde hir neuer but vpon the cockes of all prayes, bycause that wyll make hir loue that praye the better.
And when shee killeth a henne of any kinde, lette hir no more but plume vpon it, and gyue hir but the heart, and the brayne at the moste, bicause she shall not loue to flee the Henne so well as the Cocke.
It is muche better to nousel hawkes at yong fowles, than at the olde.
For moste commonly if a yong hawke be let flee at olde game, shee will turne tayle, and cowardly giue it ouer, vnlesse you do as before is declared.
If you woulde nousel or enter a haggarde, then do not enter hir or sette hir in bloude vpon a yong praye, or inure hir thereto.
For then she woulde not afterwardes passe muche for olde game.
And likewise for the same consideration you shall not nousel nor enter a mewed hawke at yong game.
For the Goshawke all fowles generally are good traynes, as Crane, Bustarde, Hearne, wilde Goose, Riuer fowle, Cormorantes, Choughes, Rookes, Kyghtes, and all other fowle that haunt Ryuers or plashes.
Howe to make a trayne or flight for the Goshawke.
SEtte one of the sayd fowles vpon the water, and betweene you and the water, let there bee some small shrubbes or bushes, so as the Goshawke may haue couerte to take the stande if neede be, as also to keepe hir out of sight of the fowle, for hir aduantage.
Then aduaunce your fiste, so as the hawke maye discrie the fowle.
After whiche you may hold it lower againe, and so cast off the hawke.
And if so be yt she seaze the fowle, lette hir feede thereon at hir pleasure on the grounde.
To make your Goshawke to the brooke, lette hir flee those traynes afore sayde, as haue tolde you.
But when you see the hawke approche the fowle, to be within daunger, then strike vp your drumme before such time as ye fowle do espie your Goshawke.
For if she once see the hawke before shee spring, she will by no meanes willingly forsake the brooke, but fall to dyuing and ducking, a defence whiche nature hath prouided taught the~.
Thus muste you deale with the Goshawke to the brooke, but if you will flee with hir to the Hare Lyueret, (which is a game that the Goshawke dothe muche delyghte to kyll and praye on) then muste you breeche hir, and at no time let hir flee without that deuise, for feare least she spoyle hir selfe.
For the Hare is of some force, and in striuing to escape from hir, will force hir to stretche hir armes, and open hir selfe to wide, which is the vtter vndooing of your hawke.
The Sparowhawkes do vse to kill the fowle at the Sowrce or Souse, as the Goshawkes do, whiche nature hath taught them, (for that beeing rounde winged hawkes,) if they dealt not vpon the aduauntage, the fowle might easily slippe from them, and escape their daunger.
But so greate is the curtesie of kinde, as shee euer seeketh to recompence any defect of hirs, with some other better benefite, or at least such as shall serue the turne.
Thus haue you the Frenche Falconers opinions layde downe, as touching the fleeing with eche kinde of hawke, or at leaste, the greatest parte of them.
For the knowledge to flee with the Falcon, serueth for all Towre hawkes, and the Goshawke for the rounde winged hawkes. (&becaus) To manne, hoode, and reclayme a hawke, after the opinion of the Italian Falconer.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of man with falcon] HE that will furnishe his hawke accordingly, muste haue Iesses and Bewettes of good leather, and shrill belles, according to the hugenesse or condition of his hawke.
So must he also haue a hoode for hir: and therewithall he must oftentymes hoode and vnhoode hir, in such sort that shee be not afrayde thereof, nor of hir keeper when hee handleth hir.
In nine nightes hee shoulde not suffer hir to iouke at all, nor to come on any perche, but shoulde keepe hir continually so long vpon his fist.
And when he will call hir, let him obserue this order: Set the Falcon vpon the perche and vnhoode hir, then shewe hir your fiste with some meate in it, and call hir so long till she come to it.
And when she commeth feede hir, and rewarde hir as pleasauntly as you can: But if she come not, giue hir nothing at all vntill she be verye sharpe set.
And this order must you keepe with your Hawke seuen or eight dayes togither.
When you would lure hir, giue hir vnto some other man to holde, and call hir with a lure well garnished with meate on both sydes, as you called hir to your fist.
After you haue vsed that maner of calling sixe dayes or thereaboutes, cause hir to be helde further from you, and cast the lure about your heade, and throwing it out vpon the grounde a little from you: And if she come to it roundly, then feede hir and rewarde hir bountifully.
And whyles your hawke is vpon the lewre, go aboute hir fayre and softly, lewring and crying: wó hó hó, as Falconers vse.
And when you haue thus done by the space of certaine dayes, take your lewre garnished as before sayde, and euery day call hir to you as farre as shee may well heare and perceyue you: and let hir be loose from all hir furniture, that is without either loynes or cryaunce: and if she come so farre off to you, then feed and rewarde hir well, and stoppe hir in hir feeding oftentymes, for that will make hir come the better: but take heede that you hurt hir not in so doing.
And when you haue vsed hir thus a moneth, or vntill she come well and roundly, and that shee be familiar with the man without any straungenesse or coynesse, then may you stop the lewre vpon hir, and make hir flee vpon you.
But before you do so, it shall be meete to bathe hir, least when she is at libertie she rangle to seeke water, and so you might leese your Hawke: and euery seuen or eight dayes, your Hawke should be set to the water, for the nature of them so requireth.
When you haue thus manned, reclaymed, and lewred your Falcon, go out with hir into the fieldes and whistle hir of your fyst, standing still to see what she will do, and whether she will rake out or not.
But if she flee rounde vpon you, as a good Hawke shoulde flee, then let hir flee a turne or two: whiche done, throwe hir out the lewre, and let hir foote a henne or a pullet, and kill it, and feede hir well therevppon.
Vnhoode hir often as you beare hir, and cease not so to do vntill she haue endewed and mewted sufficiently.
When your Falcon is thus made manned, go abrode with hir euery morning when the weather is fayre and calme, and chuse a place for hir to flee in, where there is some narrow brooke or plashe of water.
And when you cast hir off, go into the winde so farre that the fowle may not descrie you.
And when she is cast off, and beginneth to recouer hir gate, make you then towardes the brooke where the fowle lie, alwayes wyling and making your Hawke to leane in vpon you.
And when you perceiue that she is at a reasonable pitche, then (hir heade being in,) lay out the fowle, and lande it if you can, and if you cannot, take downe your Hawke, and let hir kil some traine, as thus.
Take with you a Ducke, and slip one of hir wing feathers, and hauing thrust it through hir nares, throw it out vnto your Hawke, and cast it as high as you can right vnderneath your Hawke, that she may the better knowe your hande, and you.
And remember that you neuer flee a yong Hawke without some quicke thing caryed into the field with you, that if she faile at first to kill the wilde fowle, you may yet make hir kil that traine which you bring with you.
And this you shall doe for a certaine time, vntill your Hawke be well entred and quarreyed, and that she knowe a quarreyor sufficiently.
Some other Falcons there be of a contrarie nature, which will require great skill to finde their properties.
And the same being knowne, you may keepe them high or poore, according to their conditions.
So shal you do more good with them, than if you haue no respect to the diuersitie of their nature: for then you should commit great errours, and seldome make good Hawkes.
First you shall feede your Hawke well vpon a fowle of the same kinde that you woulde traine hir withall, or haue hir flee to.
And you shall doe so vntill you haue acquainted your Hawke with that kinde of fowle, the which you may do in this sort.
Take that fowle that you will make the trayne of, and set it on foote with meate tyed vpon the backe of it, and go so neare it that the Hawke maye see it: and when she seeth it, let hir seaze therevpon, and foote the fowle and kill it.
Or you may thus do better: Take a Cryance, and tye the fowle (which hath the meate tyed on hir backe) by the beake, and cause one to stande close which maye holde the same Cryance.
Then vnhoode your Hawke, and stande a farre off, and let him drawe the fowle and stirre it with his Cryance, vntill your Hawke may see it styrre.
And if she foote it, then may you afterwards make hir this other kinde of traine.
Take a quick fowle which can flee, and when you haue half seeled it, and cast it out, let your hawke flee to it, and if she kil it, reward and feed hir vp well vpon it.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of sparrowhawk] IF you would know howe to feed and man Sparrowhawkes that be taken tender penned out of their eyree, it is meete that you keepe them in a freshe and sweete place, and giue them as much as they will eate, of small byrdes, as Sparrowes, Martlets, and such like.
And also you may giue them other flesh, but see that it be sweet, cleane, and good, shred into small pellets vpon a cleane trencher.
When they beginne to waxe full somed, giue them Sparrowes, and other small birdes whole, that they may learne to plume, foote, and tyre: and set them a Bason of cleane water in a heape of sande, that they may bathe therein and proine and picke their feathers.
They that be thus dealt withall do not know how to pray and therfore you must enter them by traynes in this maner.
Take a yong chicke~ which is of colour and plume like a Feasant or Partrich, cast it out before your Sparhawke.
But if she flee not vnto it, nor do foote it, then strip the skin vpon the head of the chicken vntil it bleed, and she will lightly seaze it, thinking that it is flesh to feed vpon.
Then feed hir vpon it well, and thus you shall vse hir vntill she wil seaze a chicken of hirself.
When she will take a chicken of hirself, go into some fayre close or medow where nothing may be to interrupt you, take a yong chicken and throw it vp vnto your hawke vntill she flee to it and foote it: then feede hir vp therevpon, and coy hir asmuche as you can deuise: For Nyasse Sparhawkes are much more daungerous and coy than others be.
When your Sparhawke will foote a chicken well as before sayd, then you may trayne hir thus.
Cause some of your seruants or others to stande close in some ditche or other priuie corner, with a liue chicken in his hande: and stande your selfe with your Sparhawke vpon your fist a little distance from him: then crie and speake as you would speake, and cry to your Spaniels when they range the field.
And when you thinke that your Sparhawke looketh that way as he that hath the traine standeth, let him cast vp the chicken, as highe as he can, and let your Sparhawke flee thereat, and seaze it.
That done, rewarde hir, and feed hir therevpon, making much of hir, and cheering hir euermore among.
When you haue thus trayned hir, mount on your horsebacke, giue hir like traynes in the field as before sayd.
Then set hir sharpe against an euening, and go out to seeke some game: and if you find, seek to make hir one flight at aduauntage, and let hir flee but once, and suppe hir vp vpon the pray.
Thus in foure or fiue dayes at the beginning woulde haue you let hir flee but one flight in a day, rewarding hir well alwayes when she killeth any thing, to the ende she may knowe hir game the better, and take the greater delight therein, vntill she be throughly nousled.
To keepe your Sparhawke in good order, ryse early in the morning, and taking hir vpon your fyst, tappe hir on the trayne with your two forefingers, and stroke on hir wings that shee may mantle and warble, and aduaunce hir selfe bolt vpright and delicately vpon your fyst.
Sometymes also take off hir hoode, and put it on againe fayre and softly, for rebuking hir.
When you haue kept hir two houres vpon the fist, then set hir in the Sunne to weather hir halfe an houre: that beeing done call hir to your fist wyth meate, and whistle to hir often, and chirpe with your lippes, that she may learne to know that voyce when you call hir, and when she commeth rewarde hir well.
Thus you shoulde vse hir dayly, vntill she come well to the fyst: remembring alwayes that you deale with hir as gently and as amiably as you can deuise.
When she is well manned, and well comming, trie if she couet not the water to bathe hir.
And if she do bathe, then may you afterwardes flee with hir: But first get on horsebacke, and call hir from off the grounde with a Cryance, for feare least she shoulde thinke straunge to come to you on horsebacke: and if she come well to you from the ground, being on horsbacke, then may you boldly flee with hir.
But remember alwayes to espie some flight with aduauntage at the first, for discouraging of your Hawke: For if she be once well nousled and entred, you may afterwards he the bolder how and when to flee with hir.
TO feede a Sparhawke orderly, you shoulde giue hir good meates, as thighes of Chickens and Pullettes, yong Sparrowes, Martelettes and other small byrdes.
Also sheepes hearts, or Lambes heartes: all these bee excellent meate for a Sparhawke.
And those you must gyue them cleane and hote, if it bee possible: for with hote meates you shall keepe hir alwayes in best plighte, and leaste daunger to abate.
And to preuent diseases, you shall giue hir euery nighte casting of Cotton or Lint, or suche lyke.
And yet some are of opinion, that it is not best to giue a Sparhawke casting so often: But by theyr leaue, thinke it meete: and my reason is, that when you gyue hir casting, you shall alwayes perceyue the disposition of hir gorge and pannell from tyme to tyme, by the signes whiche you shall see vppon the casting, and in it: As sometymes it will bee white, sometymes blacke, sometymes yellow, sometymes greene, and of other colours: and by this meanes knowing the infirmitie of your Hawke, you maye the better prouide remedie for the same.
Therefore thinke it best to gyue a Sparhawke casting, and it shall not bee amisse to put therein sometymes a whole Cloue, in a pellet of Cotton, whiche is a tryed medicine to drawe euill humours from a Hawkes head: Or sometymes you maye put a chyue of Saffron in hir casting.
And aboue all things, giue hir water once in three or foure dayes: For Sparhawkes doe muche couet the water, and it is the beste thing (with other good dyet) that can bee, to keepe a Sparhawke alwayes sounde and in good case.
TAke heede that you feede not your Hawke with two sortes of meate at once, for that is perillous.
Forasmuche as the substaunces of them beeing diuerse, they striue in disgestion or endewing, and breede euill humors and wormes in a Hawke, and sill hir with winde.
And beware also that you feede not youre Hawke wyth fleshe of beastes that bee olde, nor that bee hurte or taynted: For suche meates are harde to endewe, and full of venome and corruption, breeding diseases.
Beware also that you giue not youre Hawke the fleshe of a broode henne.
And it shall not be amisse sometimes to chaunge your Hawkes meate and feeding.
Gooseflesh (if you vse it oftentymes) will breede many flegmatike humors in a hawke, and the cray in hir pannell.
The flesh of a yong Calfe is good for a gorge or two: but if you giue it oftner, it ingendreth flegme and colde humors in the heade, and breadeth lise in hir.
The hart is much better for co~mon feeding than the rest.
The flesh of a Ram goat, a female goat, or a gelded goat, is good to set vp a hawke.
But some are of opinion that it breedeth the goute, and moyste watrie humours, and opilations in the gorge.
Mutton is not good, for it breedeth humours in the heade, as the Rye and such like: it dries vp and enflames a Hawke, and makes hir hose sit close to hir legges.
Lambes fleshe, and the fleshe of a Kidde, is good giuen with Goates milk, especially when your hawke is poore, and hath bene hardly delt withall.
Hares flesh, or Conies flesh, either colde or hote, is verie good to endew, and sounde meate for a Hawke: but take heede that you giue hir none of the braynes, nor anie of the haires or bones, for they are perillous, and breede wormes in the gorge and in the guttes.
Cattes fleshe is vnholesome, and harde to be indewed, and breedeth perillous wormes, and stoppeth a Hawke in the gorge, and marreth hir winde.
Rattes fleshe is good and wholesome: it consumeth choller, helpeth to loose the head, giueth good appetite and disgestion.
Dogges fleshe is good and verie sound, and verie meete for those kinde of Falcons, whiche are whote Hawkes of nature.
Woolues fleshe is naughte, and contrarie to a Hawkes nature.
The flesh of a Foxe (as my Authour affirmeth) is holesome and setteth vp a hawke.
If your Hawke happen to sit abrode in the colde ayre, and especially in the night, giue hir small birdes to feede vpon, bycause they are hote of nature and comfort much: but beware that you vse it not continually, for it will make hir too stately, and cause hir forget you, in suche sort, that you shall hardly reclayme hir from hir coynesse.
To feede with ryuer fowle and such lyke, there are some of them good, and some bad, as will breefly declare.
Some hold opinion, that the bones and bloud of a Bargander, Moorehen, and such like, may be giuen to an hauke: but that the skinne, flesh, or feathers of them are not good, bycause they breede euill humours.
The flesh of a Ducke or of a Crane (as they report) is good and wholesome.
The flesh of a Partriche is most excellent when a Hawke is sicke and diseased.
The flesh of a wylde Goose, or of a flecked Crowe, is good: but you must giue your Hawke but little thereof, and none at al of their bloud: for it is salt, brackish, and of an euill nourishment.
The fleshe of these flesh Crowes, and of the Wagtayles (a Dishwasher as we terme them, in Latin called Motacilla and the Cormorant, is of euill nourishment and disgestion.
The flesh of a white Storke, and also of the blacke Storke, called (Saracinessa) is euill of nourishment, and hard to be endewed, and stinking.
The flesh of the Bitter, and Sea Coote, is good and sounde, especially when the Sea Coote doth feede and scoure hir wyth sande, it is good to enseame and breath a hawke: although naturally all water fowles are colde of complexion, moyste and hard of disgestion.
The flesh of the white Heron, otherwise called the Shoueler, and of the blew or ashe coloured Heron, is of good disgestion and nourisheth well.
The flesh of Finches, hedge Sparrowes, and such like, are in maner all one: and you muste beware that you giue not your hawke too much of them at once.
The flesh of a Hearon royall, that is to say the gray Hearon, is reasonable good, according to the opinion of many auncient Falconers: but Ptholomeus king of Egipt doth alledge the co~trarie, saying, that naturally all foules which liue vpon fish, frogs, or snakes, and such like venemous wormes, are euill of disgestion, and that their bloud breedeth opilations and euill humours, although they seeme to delight hawkes to feed on them for their delicate sweetenesse and taste.
The flesh of the redde Haro~ is good: but you must giue but little of it.
The flesh of the Swan, and many other kindes of water fowles to long here to be rehearsed, are to be vsed according to the tyme and circumstances of occasion.
The flesh of Sea Crowes, and Rauens, Cormorants, and such like, are of a brackishe bloud, and therefore you may nowe and then giue your hawke a gorge thereof: but you must not vse it often.
The flesh of rauening byrdes, as Kightes, Puttocks, Harpies, Eagles, Eyrons, and such like, all these are verie contrarie to the nature of Falcons, and are stinking, of euil disgestion, and chollericke.
Their bloud and braynes are worst of all, for they breede perillous wormes.
The flesh of all byrdes which feede vpon seedes, as Feasants, Pertriche, Quayles, and such like, are the best that can be, especially when a falcon or any other Hawke is sicke.
Doues flesh is excellent, eyther when a hawke is sicke, or to mew withall: for it makes a hawke to mewe well quickly.
Pullets fleshe, and Chickens fleshe, is good at all times, and alwayes in season, as the flesh of that fayre fowle Bella Donna is.
To man and make a Hawke: and first of a Niasse Falcon.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of Niasse falcon] THere are three sortes of Falcons. viz. Niasses, Sorehawkes, and Hawkes, taken praying for themselues at large, whiche our Falconers call ramage or sleight Falcons.
And am of opinion that they are all made after one sort, and are manned much a like.
But by mine aduice no man shall much assure himselfe in a Niasse, bycause ouer and besides that (for the most part) they proue not well, they do also require great paynes and attendance with extreeme pacience, to make them kill and stoupe a fowle well, or to flee a high pitche.
Neuerthelesse if any man will needes be doing with them, he shoulde first make a Niasse to the Hearon from the fist, meane both the blew and redde Hearon, and to suche other great fowles.
For as much as the Niasse hawkes are naturally good seazers, bold, and hardy birds.
And after they be well in bloud, and entered in fleeing to those fowles from the fyst, then may you make them to the Ryuer, going into some fayre large field, whereas there may be eyther some wilde Pecockes, fleshe Crowes, or some other great fowle, bearing your Falcon on your fist: loose hir hood in a readinesse, drawing as neare the fowle as you can, and the first fowle or byrde that springeth, vnhoode hir and let hir flee from the fyst to the same fowle, bycause they may drawe your Hawke vpwardes.
And when she is at a greate gate, or at a reasonable pitche, then throwe hir out a Ducke, or a Mallarde seeled with a feather through the nares.
And if shee kyll it, then rewarde hir well, and feede hir vpon it wyth as muche fauour as you can deuise, alwayes lewring and crying to hir to comfort and encourage hir.
IF a falconer chaunce to recouer a Ramage Hawke which was neuer handled before, let him immediately seele hir, and therewithall let him euen then also put on hir Iesses, the which must bee of Shameuse leather, or soft Calues leather, or suche other leather as maye bee gentle and plyaunte to hir legge.
At the ende thereof it shall not bee amisse to sette two Veiuelles of Syluer, the one thereof maye haue the armes of the King, or Queene whom you serue, and the other a Scutcheon of your owne armes.
For as much as when they flee out, if they chaunce to be taken vp, they may the sooner be returned againe and restored to their owners, the which must then remember to rewarde the taker vp of his Hawke liberally.
You shall also put hir on a a paire of good Belles with two propre bewets: Being thus furnished, you shall go about to man hir, handling hir often gently, and both to auoyde the sharpnesse of hir beake, as also the better to rebuke hir from byting and nipping: you shall haue a streight smooth sticke, as bigge as your finger, and halfe a foote long or more, with the which you shal gently stroke your hawke about the pinions of hir wings, and so downwardes thwart all hir trayne.
And if she chaunce to knappe or byte at the sticke, let hir bite hardly, for that will rebuke hir thereof, whereas your hande being twitched away fearefully, would make hir proceed the more eagerly.
To man hir well you must watche all the nighte, and keepe hir on youre fiste: and you muste teache hir to feede seeled: and hauing a greate and easie rufterhoode, you muste hoode and vnhoode hir oftentymes seeled as shee is, handling hir gently about the heade, and coying hir alwayes when you vnhoode hir, to the ende she take no disdayne or displeasure agaynst hir keeper.
And also make hir to plume and tyre sometimes vpon a wing, and keepe hir so on the fist day and night without perching of hir, vntill she be wearie, and suffer you to hoode hir gentely and stirre not: and correct hir of hir ramage toyes, especially of snapping and byting, stroking hir euermore as before sayde with your sticke.
But if it happen (as it doth sometimes) that your chaunce be to haue a Falcon so ramage and shrewde metteld that she will not leaue hir snapping and byting, then take a cloue of Garlike cleane pilled, or a little Aloes Cycatrina, and when she byteth or snappeth at your hand or sticke, offer hir the Garlike or Aloes, and let hir bite it: for eyther the strong sent of the Garlike, or the bitter taste of the Aloes, will quickely make hir leaue hir biting and snapping.
IT happeneth oftentimes that Falconers haue Hawkes which come from Cyprus, Candya, Alexandria, and other farre countreyes, the whiche hauing beene in the handes of suche as coulde not well skill of them, become coye and verye vntowarde to be hooded, and will hardly bee woonne to abyde the Hoode by any meanes.
In this case you muste fyrst seele youre Hawke, and beeing seeled, you muste fitte hir with a large easie Hoode: and hoode and vnhoode hir often therewith, watching hir a nighte or twoo, and handling hir oftentymes aboute the heade as before sayde, vntyll she haue forgotten that faulte.
And when shee once doeth leaue it, you maye vnseale hir in an Euening by Candle lighte, handling hir styll softly wyth your hande aboute the heade, hooding and vnhooding hir oftentymes, vntill shee wyll well abyde the Hoode and brooke to bee handled.
And here thinke good to expresse myne opinion, that hee whiche taketh in hande to bee a Falconer, ought fyrste to bee verye pacient, and therewythall to take syngular delyght in an Hawke, so that hee may seeme to bee in loue (as it were naturally) with his Hawke, euen that a man would say, it were a thing bredde so in the bone as it coulde neuer bee rooted oute of the fleshe.
For suche a man with neuer so little payne and industrye, will become an excellent Falconer: but hee whiche taketh not that delyght in his Hawke, but doeth rather exercise it for a pompe and boast, than vppon a naturall instinct: or beeyng a poore manne, doeth vse it to get hys lyuing, such a man in mine opinion shall seldome proue a perfecte Falconer, but a marrehawke, and shall beare the bagge after a right Falconer.
To turne to my purpose, when your Hawke beeing so seeled, doeth feede well, and will abyde the Hoode, and to bee handled, withoute stryking or byting at your hande: then in an Euening by Candlelyght you shall vnseele hir, and wyth youre finger and a little spyttle, annoynte the place where the seeling threade was drawne thorough.
And when you haue hooded hir, take hir on youre fyste, and holde hir so all nyght vntyll daye appeare agayne, doyng off hir Hoode oftentymes, and handling hir gently wyth your hande, strokyng hir softly aboute the wyngs and the bodye, hooding and vnhooding of hir, and giuing hir sometymes to feede, a morsell or twayne, or sometymes tyring or plumage.
But aboue all things, you muste watche hir on the fyste, so manye nightes togither, without setting hir downe on anye pearche, that shee may bee wearie, and suffer you to hoode and handle hir gently without anye maner of resistaunce, and vntill shee haue altogither left and forgotten hir stryking and byting at your hande: but some Hawkes will bee long before they leaue that fault, as the more coy or ramage that they bee, the longer they will retayne those ill tatches, and will not peraduenture be woonne from them in three, foure, or fyue dayes.
When shee is well reclaymed from it, then you maye let hir sitte vppon a pearche to rest hir.
But euerie night you shall doe well to keepe hir on the fyste three or foure houres, handling hir, and strokyng hir gently, and causing hir to tyre or to plume, alwayes making of hir, and hooding and vnhooding hir oftentymes as before sayde.
And the lyke maye you doe also by daye lyghte, but in a Chamber a part, where shee may see no great light vntil she feede surely and eagerly without dreade.
IF your hawke be thus in foure or fiue dayes manned, so that she beginne to feede eagerly and boldely, then you shall fyrste beginne to make hir knowe youre whistle, or the chirping of your mouth: and afterwardes your voyce, in this maner.
Take a quicke Pullette, and goyng into some secrete place, where your Hawke maye well perceyue the fowle, and yet see no great open lyght, let hir plume and feede vppon it, as shee sitteth vppon your fyst: then chyrke wyth your voyce, and vse those other soundes which Falconers do to their Hawkes: and feed hir so hooding hir gently: then afterwardes you may let hir plume a little vpon some wing, beeing still hooded, as well to loose hir in the heade, and to make hir cast water, as also to teache hir the better howe to sitte on the fyste.
The feeding for a Falcon shall bee Pullettes, not verie olde, Calues heartes, wethers harts, and hogges harts, and to giue hir a conuenient gorge, to the ende she may the better disgest both the grosse substance, and the slimie matter.
But if your Falcon be not eager or sharpe set, then shall you do well to washe hir meate sometymes in fayre water, and some other whiles in vrine, wringing it a little and then feeding hir therewith, for one, two, or three gorges, and that not continually: but respecting a day or two betweene, and that is referred to the discretion of the good Falconer.
For this is done somewhat to abate a Hawke and to enseame hir.
It shall not be amisse also in the morning when she is emptie both in the gorge and pannel, to conuey into hir a little Sugercandie, to the quantitie of a small nutte, for that dissoluing in hir, will make hir the better to endure, and will bothe breake the grosse substaunce, and disgest the glitte in hir, and also will make hir eager, as shall be further sayd hereafter.
WHen your Hawke feedeth eagerly, and knoweth your whistle and your voyce, then may you teach hir to know hir feeding, and to bate at it in this wise.
You should with your right hande shewe hir meate, crying and lewring to hir aloude, and if shee bate or strike at it, then must you quickly and handsomely let hir foote it and feede on it for three or foure bittes: and do thus oftentimes, to the ende she may the better know hir feeding.
And afterwards feede hir, and giue hir euerie night (without intermission) some casting eyther of feathers, or of cotton, with two Cloues, somtimes cut in foure peeces, and put into the casting, or a little Aloes wrapped vp in the Cotton, according as the Falconer shall see that it is requisite.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of falcon] WHen a Falcon hath learned to feede, and to knowe the call of hir keeper: then to make hir hardy, you shal suffer hir to plume a pullet or good great chicke~.
And you shal go into some close place, where she may not see ouermuch light, as before sayde, where loosing hir hoode in a readines, you must haue a liue pullet in your hande, kneling on the ground, lewring and crying alowde vnto hir, make hir plume and pul the pullet a litle.
Then wt your teeth drawing the strings, vnhoode hir softly, suffring hir to plume and pluck it wt hir beake twice or thrice more, caste out the pullet vpon the grounde before hir.
Then must you with raysing or holding downe your fiste, encourage hir vntill she leape downe vpon the pullet, and seaze it.
Then when she beginneth to breake it and to take bloude, you shal lewre cry alowde vnto hir, and encourage hir by all the meanes yt you can, feding hir vpo~ the ground.
And therwithal you shall take hir vp gently and nymbly with the pullet in hir foote, whereon lette hir plume, and feede nowe and then a little.
Then hoode hir gently, and at laste gyue hir tyring of a wing or a foote of the sayde pullet.
AFter that your Falcon hath twice or thrice thus killed a pullet in some secret place, the~ must you make hir know ye lewre in this wise.
Fasten a pullet vnto your lewre, and go a part.
Then giue your Falcon to holde vnto some other man, who may draw loose ye strings of hir hoode in a readinesse.
And when you are gone a little backe fro~ him, take your lewre at halfe ye length of ye string, and cast it about your heade once or twice, lewring with your voice also.
Then let yt other vnhoode your hawke, whiles you throw out ye lewre not far from your hawke, lewring crying still vnto hir.
And if your hawke do stoupe to ye lewre, seaze ye pullet, suffer hir to plume hir, coying hir, lewring stil wt your voyce.
Then let hir feede on the pullet vpon the lewre, and afterwards take hir vpon your fiste togither with hir meate, and hoode hir, suffring hir to plume and tyre, as is before sayde.
WHen your Falcon hath come well three or foure times vnto the lewre in some secrete place, as well to a lyue pullet as to a deade, then shall you go abroade into some fayre medow, where are no trees, and fastning a quick pullet vnto ye lewre, giue your hawke to hold vnto another man.
The~ tying also a cryance vnto your hawkes lease, cause that other which holdeth your hawke to make ready hir hoode, and giue hir a little bytte of meate on his fiste, chirping and cheering hir wt his voyce: Euen therwithall do you go abacke foure or fiue paces or more, lewring twice or thrice, lette him whiche holdeth the hawke, do off hir hoode, then do you take the lewre at length of the string, and cast it about your heade, crying and lewring alowde, throwing it vpon ye grounde: and if your hawke stoupe at the pullet, suffer hir to breake it, and feede hir vpon ye lewre, casting hir to eate the braines and the heart of the pullet with the lewre also, alwayes crying and lewring.
And this order shall you obserue dayly further and further off, vntill shee be well lewred, entred, and manned.
WHen your Falcon will come a far off vnto the lewre, and stoupe to it being throwen out, wtout any coynesse or ramagenesse, then setting hir sharpe, you shall get on horsebacke in a morning, and go into some faire playne fielde, and as neare as you can, where ther is no wood nor trees, there giuing your hawke vnto some other man to hold (whiche muste also bee on horsebacke.)
Put your cryance to your hawke in suche wise, that she may not tangle hir selfe therwith in comming to ye lewre.
The~ drawing backe a little as much as you thinke meete, gyue a signe to him yt holdeeth ye hawke, to make ready hir hoode, let him hold vp his fist on heigth.
Then lewre you three or four times as lowde as you ca~, alwaies casting ye lewr about your hed, whervnto for ye first time wold haue a Pullette fastened still.
And whyle you so do, lette him whiche holdeth your hawke, pluck of hir hoode, and if she come streight to the lewre, forbeare vntil she come within eight or ten paces of you, then cast it vnto hir.
And if she take the lewre, lette hir plume thervpon, and lewre you still with your voyce, lighting of your horse, and draw neare to your hawke fayre softely, lewring crying vnto hir, and so feede hir as afore sayd.
But after that she be called two or three daies to ye lewre on horsebacke with a cryance, or more or lesse, according to ye towardnesse or vntowardnesse of the hawke, if shee come roundely a bowe shot from you, you may then go out in a morning, hauing set hir reasonably sharpe for the purpose, cal hir loose on horsebacke, yt is without either lease or cryance, but loose, and in co~pany.
And if she come to you, feede hir vpon the lewre, as beforesayde, lewring still vnto hir, to make hir acquainted with your voyce.
And the nexte daye you may call hir to the drye lewre, without a Pullette, or any thing vppon it.
And when she is come to the lewre, caste hir out a quicke Pullette, breaking firste the feete and legges thereof, and let hir kill it vpon the lewre, and feede hir vp.
WHen your hawke will come, and stoupe to the lewre roundly and without any ramagenes, the~ if she be a haggard, you must put hir on a payre of great lewring bels, and the like shall you do also to a soarehawke.
And so much the greater ought your bells to be, by how much more you see your hawke gyddyheaded, or like to rake out at cheeke.
For it ca~ be no hurt to clogge hir wt great bells at ye first, vntil hir co~ditions be knowen well perceyued.
That being done, hauing also set hir sharp, go one morning on horseback into some faire large field, wtout wood or trees, if it be possible, and hauing your hawke vpo~ your fist, co~sider of ye wind, ride you vp into ye winde, or towardes that way as the winde bloweth, halfe a bowe shotte.
And hauing loosened your hawkes hoode, whystle softely, as it were to prouoke your hawke to flee.
Whervpon she will beginne to bate, or at least to flappe with hir flagges and sayles, and to aduaunce hir selfe vpon your fist.
Then suffer hir vntil she rowse or mewte, when she hath done either of them, vnhoode hir, and let hir flee with hir heade into the winde.
For therby she shalbe the better able to get vp on wing, and to get into the winde.
Then will your Falcon naturally clyme vpwardes, rouing fleing rounde.
Therfore whe~ you see that she hath flowen twoo or three times, you shal cry and lewre with your voyce, and cast the lewre about your heade, whervnto first tye a pullette, as before sayde, and if your Falcon come in, when she approcheth neare you, the~ cast out ye lewre into the wind, if she stoupe to it, reward hir as before.
To make a Falcon leaue the stande on the grounde.
YF your Falcon at firste when she fleeth from the fiste, will not get vp, but take stande on the grounde, as the most part of soare Falcons do commonly, you shall not yet therefore be discouraged, nor out of hope, but rather making towardes hir with your horse, threatning of hir, seeme to feare with your wande, and driue hir from the stande, vntill she flee a turne or twoo.
Then take hir downe to the lewre, and feede hir.
But if so chaunce yt your hawke will not leaue that faulte of taking the stande, then muste you seeke to finde out some Choughe, Starling, or some suche birdes, making readie your hawkes hoode, drawe as neare them as you may, vntill they rise.
Then vnhoode your hawke, and no doubte if she will flee them, they will trayne hir well vpwards.
Then must you haue in a readinesse a Ducke seeled, as before sayde, and so as she may not see but backewardes, bycause shee maye thereby mownte the higher And holding hir faste by one of the wings, neare vnto the body, in your right hande, and lewring with your voyce to make your Falcon turne the heade, forbeare tyll shee be at a reasonable pitche, then running vnder hir, caste vp your Ducke towardes hir, that she may perceyue it, and that the Ducke may be to hir in steede of a trayne.
And if shee strike hir, or stoupe hir, or trusse hir, then suffer hir to kill it, and rewarde hir vpon it, taking out one of hir legges, or both, if nede require, feede hir vp with a reasonable gorge.
This being done once or twice, or oftener, according to the occasion, your hawke will leaue the stande, and delight to keepe hir on wing, and become also the more obedient and louing.
WHen your Falcon is accustomed to flee for it, and will lye vpon you at a great gate, or at a reasonable pitche, and will come and holde in the heade at your voyce and lewring, then may you go to the Ryuer, where you shall finde any fowle, and there shall it behooue you to vse suche pollicie, that you may couer the fowle, and get your hawke to a good gate, aboue the fowle.
And when hir heade is in, then laye out the fowle, and cry, Hey gar, gar, gar.
And if your Falcon do stoupe them, and enewe them once or twice, then quickly thrust your hande in youre hawking bagge, and make hir a trayne with a Ducke seeled.
And if your hawke do eyther trusse or stoupe it, succoure your hawke immediately, crossing the Duckes wings, and lette your hawke plume. &c.
am of opinion, that for the firste or seconde tyme that you shewe your hawke a fowle, it shall not bee beste to shewe hir greate fowle, but rather small fowle, as the Dapchicke, or suche like.
For if you shewe them the greatest fowles at the firste, it often happeneth that they slyppe from the hawke vp the winde, and the hawke cannot recouer them, (but raketh out after,) whereby the Falconer is fayne to trotte farther than hee woulde, yea and sometymes also hee leeseth his hawke.
Wherefore in my iudgement it were better at the firste to bee merry and wise.
To make a hawke inwarde at the Ryuer, when she raketh out.
YF it chaunce that your hawke rake out with a fowle, and cannot recouer it, and in the ende giues it ouer, and comes in againe directly vpon the man, then shall you do well to cast hir out a seeled Ducke.
And if shee stoupe it, or trusse it, crosse the wings, and suffer hir to take hir plesure, rewarding hir, and giuing hir the heart, braynes, tongue, and lyuer, with a legge or two, according as you see occasion.
And for default of a quicke Ducke, take hir downe to the drye lewre, and lette hir plume a pullette, and feede hir vpon it.
Thus doing, your hawke will learne to giue ouer a fowle that rakes out, and hearing the keeper lewre, shee will learne the better to holde in the heade, and to make backe againe to the Ryuer.
HE that woulde make a flyght for a Haggarde, he shall do well in my conceyte, to flee where there bee no Crowes, Choughes, or such like, for the first two or three flights, bicause she shall take none occasion to rake out after suche cheeke.
And it shalbe good also, that you let hir not flee out on heade too far at the first, but runne after hir, and cry to hir VVhyloe, whyloe make hir turne heade.
And when she is come in, take hir down with the lewre, vnto the whiche woulde haue a quicke pullette fastened, as before sayde.
And you shall suffer hir to tyre, plume, and feede as before, &c.
It happeneth oftentymes, yt a Haggard through hir gadding moore gallantnesse of minde, doth ra~gle out from hir keeper, more tha~ vpon any other cause.
Then shal you clogge hir with greater lewring bells, make hir a traine or two wt a ducke seeled, to teache hir holde in, and knowe the man.
You shall not neede to trayne a Haggard so often as a Soarehawke, bycause they haue bene accustomed to praye for themselues, and doe by experience knowe one fowle from an other.
But they doe muche better remember eyther the rebukes, or cherishings whiche are made to them, than Soarehawkes do: and therfore it behooueth to vse more care and heede aboute a Haggarde, than a soare Falcon, and aboue all things to take hir often downe with the dry lewre, and to lette hir take hir pleasure of hir rewarde.
And (as Falconers tearme it) to bee euer well in bloude.
For otherwise she will not long be at your commaundement, but make you followe hir. (&becaus) How to make your Falcon kill hir fowle at the firste.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of falcon] WHen a Soare Faulcon, or a Haggard is well lewred, and flyeth a good gate, or a reasonable pitch, and stoupeth well, then shall you first cast off a well quarried or make Hawke, and let hir stoupe a fowle vpon a brooke or a plashe, and watch hir vntill she put it to the plunge: then take downe your make Hawke, and reward hir, and hood hir vp, setting hir a little way off by the flight, that you may vse hir help afterwards if neede be.
This being done, take your yong hawke which is not yet entred, and going vp the wind halfe a boweshotte, or thereabouts, loose hir hood, and softly whistle hir off the fiste, vntill she haue rowsed or mewted, then lette hir flee with hir head into the wind, hauing first giuen fhew to youre company that they be in a readinesse against the Hawke bee at a good gate, and to shewe water, and lay out the fowle.
This order being obserued, and running and crying as Falconers vse to do, hawke on your Faulcon, and giue hir leaue to get vp, and when she is at a reasonable pitch, and couering the fowle, giue a signe to youre companions that they drawe neare to the water, and all at once make in vpon the fowle on all sides the brooke (as Falconers tearme it) to land hir: then if your Falcon stoupe and strike or trusse it, runne in apace to help hir, and crossing the fowles wings, let your Hawke take hir pleasure on it, feeding hir as custome is: but if so chaunce that she cannot slay it at the firste stouping, then you muste giue your Hawke respite and time to recouer hir gate: And when she is at hir gate againe, and hir head in, then lay out the fowle agayne as before sayd, vntill you may land it at the last, alwayes remembring that as soone as shee seaze it, you succour hir quickly and reward hir according to order.
True it is that to be assured, you shal do well always to haue a quick Mallard or Ducke in the Hawking bagge whensoeuer you would make a flight: and if your Hawke kill not the fowle which is stouped (as often hapneth by many ouerthwart cha~ces) then may you quickly haue recourse to the hawking bag, and feeling your liue Ducke (your Hawke being at hir pitche and hir head in) you may throw hir vp to your Hawke, reward hir &c.
For this order shal alwais maintain your hawke to be inwards, and in good life, and bloud.
How to do when your riuer Hawke will take stand in a tree.
IF you haue a Falcon whiche (assoone as shee hathe once or twice stouped endewed a fowle) wil take stand on a tree, you must asmuche as maye bee, eschue to flee in places where trees be, and you muste haue two or three liue traynes, and giue them to sundrie Falconers, placing them all of purpose, some here, some there: and when your Hawke hath stouped and woulde goe to stande, then lette him vnto whome the Hawke doth most bend, cast out his traine ducke, seeled, and if the Falcon slay hir, then reward hir &c.
And by this meanes she will leaue that fault, but if in this doing twice or thrice, she will not leaue that tricke, then the best counsell can giue you, is to ridde your hands of such a kight.
WHen your Hawke is well quarried, and fleeth well to the riuer, and fleeth a great gate, or a reasonable pitch, then shall you do well also to make hir fond of the lewre: for when a Hawke hath stouped once, twice or thrice, you shall do well to take hir downe with the lewre, and to let hir kill a Pullet and feede hir vppon it: yea the higher fleeing that a Hawke is, the more neede to take hir downe the oftner with the lewre, and to regarde that you ouerflee hir not: For if it happen that a fowle beeing often stouped, will not spring agayne, but will rather fall to diuing (which Falconers call the ploonge) then must you take hir with dogges, or kill hir with Hawking poles, or vse some such other deuise, and be fayne to take down your Falcon with the lewre, and giue hir ye fowle vpon the lewre, feeding and rewarding hir with asmuch delight as you can to make hir fond of the lewre.
It hapneth oftentimes, that many Falcons will hardly become fond of the lewre, through the greate desire they haue to kill their fowle.
To helpe that, thinke it not sufficiente onely to keepe hir from often killing, but sometimes you muste also take the quarrey out of hir foote as soone as she hath fedde vpon alittle of the braynes, and hood hir vp, then giuing hir vnto another to hold: go from hir a bowshotte, and call hir to the lewre, and so feede and reward hir well vppon the lewre with the fowle that she killed, and this order will make hir fond of the lewre.
How to help a Hawke when she is froward and coy through the pride of grease.
SOmetimes a Falcon will become very prowde and disdaynefull by being ouer high kept, in sort that she shall not neede to be fedde nor rewarded according as they feede when they pray of themselues at large: and although she flee and kill, yet assoone as she hath plumed a little, let hir keeper take a sheepes hart colde, or the legge of a Pullet, and whiles the Hawke is busie in pluming, let the Falconer conuey the hart of the Sheepe, or the Pullets leg into some part of the body of the fowle, that it maye take some tast of it: and when the Hawke hath eaten the braynes, hart, and tongue of the fowle, then let him take that foorth and call his Hawke with it vnto the fist, let him feede hir therewith, and giue hir a little of the feathers in the necke of the sayd fowle, to scowre hir make hir cast.
IF a Falcon vse to rake out after checke or otherwise, and leane out so farre, as neyther for whouping, lewring, or for casting the Hawkes gloue about your head, she will come in againe to the flight, but rather still more and more gad out, and so flee away: in this case you muste followe after hir, lewring and whouping a good, proffering hir to the lewre, to make hir put in hir head againe: and if she do turne and come to ye lewre, then feede and reward hir, &c.
And do not faile in any wise to be fond of hir, when shee commeth to the lewre, bycause she may therby the better learne to know your voice, to come to the lewre another time.
Holding this order (especially with soare Hawkes or Hawkes of the first Cote) they will learne to holde in at the voyce or sight of the lewre, yea and that with such readinesse as it will breede admiration in all them that behold it, to see the excellencie of arte, what it is able by cunning to atchieue, whiche truely dothe appeare in nothing more than in Hawking.
WHen a Hawke is well made to the riuer, you shoulde not flee with hir aboue two flights in a morning, but feede hir vp although she kill not: but if she bee a stately high fleeing Hawke, you should not in any wise flee hir aboue one flight in a Forenoone, for it will bring hir downe, and make hir fall off hir stately pitche by often fleeing, and becomming greedy and hote of the quarrey.
When a good high fleeing Hawke beeing whistled, or cast off the fiste, dothe gather vpwards to a great gate, you must haue regard to continue hir therein, fleeing with hir vpon broade waters and open Riuers, eschuing little brookes and gullets, and such places as lie neare vnder couert, where there be trees, shrubbes, and bushes, in suche sort that it will be very hard to land a fowle hansomly from them, at least not without help of dogges and great clapping and a do.
Yea sometimes eake you must of force alight from off your Horse, all which things are able to marre a high fleeing Hawke.
For asmuche as crying, clapping of hands, noyse, bawling of dogges, and alighting on foote, and furthermore when a Hawke cannot see the water vnder hir, al these things do teache hir to forget hir kindly fleeing, and to play the Kite, houering and winding as the Kite doth in the ayre, without any shew of state: and in twice or thrice doing so, she abateth hir gate, and marreth hir fleing.
Therefore let the Falconer take good heede to that consideration, and keepe his Hawke alwayes as high fleeing as he can, suffering hir but seldome to kill and not to stoupe, beyond twice or thrice at the most, and euen when she is at the highest, let him take hir downe with the lewre: where when she hath plumed and broken the fowle alittle, let him feede hir vp, by that meanes he shall mayntayne his Falcon high fleeing, and inward, and very fond of the lewre.
Here will not denie but that if shee kill euery day, although she stoupe from a very high gate, yet if she be not rebuked or hurt therewith, she will doubtlesse become euery day higher fleeing tha~ other, mary therwithall she will so much forget the lewre, as the more you shew it hir, the more she will bend from it, and flee out on head, from hir keeper: and oftentimes will teach you hot poasting iourneys.
Wherefore aboue all things, the high fleeing Hawke should be made inwards, and (as we tearme it) fond of the lewre, bycause it is no lesse prayse worthy in a high fleeing Falcon to make in and turne head at ye second or third tosse of the lewre, and when she powreth downe like a stone vpon it, than if she had killed: nay rather suche are more esteemed than the other.
And so is ye Falconer more prayse worthy which doth winne his Hawke therevnto.
For to come vnto the lewre is a thyng taught by art and industrie, but to kill a fowle is the naturall propertie of a Hawke.
IT hapneth oftentimes that a Hawke (although she bee naturally high fleeing) will yet be long before she be made vpwards, but will fishe and play the slugge: for when she should get vp to couer the fowle, she will stoupe before the fowle bee put out, the which may proceede through two causes.
Firste it maye be that shee is too sharpe sette, and the seconde cause may be that she is flowen withall out of time, eyther too soone or too late.
So that when you see a Falcon vse those euill tatches without apparant cause, you shall do well to cast hir out a dead fowle or a dead Pullet for a dead quarrey (as Falconers tearme it,) and to hood hir vp without any rewarde, to the end she may take none encourageme~t to vse those vile tricks: for there is no greater spoyle to an high fleeing Hawke, than when she killeth a fowle from a base and lowe pitche, and so much the greater is the losse of hir by how much the more, she doth vse those vile buzardly parts.
Therefore by my best experience, prayse that order, to throwe hir out a dead quarrey and hood hir vp: then afterwardes within halfe an houre, call hir to the lewre, and feede hir, and do this as often as she vseth to fishe or to play the base slugge on that fashion, and to find whether it proceede of being too sharpe sette, or of fleeing out of time, the Falconer shall doe well with all diligence to note the naturall disposition of his Hawkes: as, whiche will flee beeing high and in good plight, and whiche best, when she is kepte lowe, whiche will flee best when she is set most sharpe and eager, and whyche contrary, and whiche in a meane betweene both, whiche earely at Sunnerising, and whiche when the Sunne is two houres high or more, whyche sooner, and whiche later in an euening.
For the natures of Falcons are very diuers and sundrie, in suche sorte as to flee with a hawke at hir best houre and time, and to flee with hir out of that time, is a thing which will shew as great difference, as betweene an excellent good Hawke and a Kight.
Therefore let the Falconer haue especiall regarde therevnto, setting hys Hawkes to flee according to their natures and dispositions, and keeping them always in good order.
And here it is to be noted, yt all Hawkes aswell Sorehawkes, as mewed hawkes and haggards, should be set out in the euening two or three houres, some more and some lesse, hauing co~uenient regard to their nature, as it is stronger or weaker: and in the morning also, accordingly as they cast, hooding them first then setting them abroade a weathering, vntill you get vp an Horsebacke to go to field, and so your Hawkes will always be well weathered and in good order These bee the best meanes and obseruations which can set downe for Riuer Hawkes, whiche if it succeede wel to you, then shall you stande assured of your sport, and of my desire.
NOw to teach you to make a flight at ye Hearon: although it be the most noblest and stately flight that is, and pleasant to behold, yet is there no suche art or industrie therein as in the other flights.
For the Hawke fleeth the Hearon: moued by nature, as against hir proper foe: but to the riuer she fleeth as taught by the industrie and dilige~ce of the Falconer.
Then must it needes follow, that (suche Falconers as haue flowen at the Riuer, when the end of the month of February or the beginning of Marche is come, a time when Hearnes begin to make their passage,) if you will make those Falcons to that flight, you must cease fleeing at the Riuer with them any lo~ger: but you must pull them downe and make them light, the which you shall do by feeding them with no wild meates, but the harts and flesh of Lambes, Calues, and chickens, and calling of them to the lewre with other make Falcons, that is to say, a cast at once, to the end they may accustom and aquaint themselues one with another, and so maye the better flee the Hearon by helping one another, by succouring each other.
Herin you must take good heede so to acquaint them that they crabbe not togither, for so would they do when they come to the flight, whereby they might be in perill to be spoyled or killed.
When your Falcons be skowred and cleane, so as beyng sharp set, they may be called hungrie Hawkes, or (as Faulconers tearme the~) eagre Hawkes, you must get a liue Hearon, vppon the vpper part of whose bill or truncke you must conuey the ioynt of a reede or Cane, so as shee may not hurt the hawke therewith: that being done, tie the Hearon in a Criance, then setting hir vpon the ground, vnhood your Hawke, to the end that when she espieth the Hearon she may flee hir: and if she do so, make in apace to succour hir, let hir plume, take bloud of it, allowing hir ye braynes, the marrowe of the bones with the Hart altogether: (the Italians call it Soppa.
Hauing thus layde it vpon your hawking gloue, giue it your Hauke: and afterwardes rippe the breast of the Hearne, let your hauke feede theron vntill she be wel gorged.
This being doone, hoode hir vp, vpon the Hearon, suffring hir plume theron with all the fauour that may be: then take hir vpon your fist, and lette hir tyre a little vppon the foote or pynion of the wing.
But if a Falconer haue not store of Hearons to traine withall (as often as it happeneth, by meane the fowle is rare and dayntie) then may he do thus: When he hath armed or cased the Hearons tronke with a cane or reed, as beforesayd, he may take a pece of a Calues skin, or such other like, as long as the neck of a Heron, beginning at the head continuing to the shulders body of the hearon, let him sew it in proportion and shape of a sheath, that it may arme the Hearons neck and head: afterwards with a pensill, pen and inke, or such other deuice, let him paint it as like as he can to the neck and head of an Heron, with fethers euery thing to the purpose.
Then let him set the counterfeat Hearon vpon the ground, as before said: and when the Hauke dothe flee it and foote it, he muste haue a quick yong Pigeon, the which he must hansomly conuey vnder the Hearons wyng, and let the Hauke plume and feede theron, reseruing the Hearon safe for an other tyme, and to make trayne agayne with it the nexte daye.
Then hauing thervpon rewarded youre Hauke, and coyed hir sufficiently, you maye goe the next daye into a meadowe, or other conuenient place, with your Falcon on your fyst: and giuing the Hearon armed, as beforesayde, to some other whyche maye holde it vnder his arme a good waye off from the Hawke, as halfe an Arrowe shoote or more: Then your Hawke beyng vnhooded, giue signe vnto him to throw vp ye Hearon on high, and if your Hawke seaze it, reward and feede hir with a Pigeon as beforesayd, dealing familiarly with hir, and the third day you may do agayne in like manner, causing hym that holdeth the trayne to hide himselfe as close as he can, and to cast out the Hearon as farre from him as he may All these being done, and the Hawke hauing thus often taken hir trayne to your liking, you may the fourth day in a fayre field, put out the Hearon without Criance or arming hir at all: and when she is vp of a reasonable height, you maye cast off your Hawke, who if shee binde with the Hearon and bring it downe, the~ make in apace to reskew hir, thrusting the Hearo~s bill into the grounde, breake his wings and legges that the Hawke may the more easily foote and plume it Then reward hir as bountifully as you can with the braynes, the marrowe of the bones and the hart as is before declared (making hir the Italia~ Soppa many vse to make a trayne another way which doth not mislike me, and that is this: they cause one to climb a tree with the Hearon, and from thence he casteth hir out to the Hawke, and then they let their Hawkes flee as before sayde.
But as touching these traynes, it behoueth that the Falconer be of good Iudgement, as also in diuers other things.
For euen as the Hawke doth flee them with better or worse liste and life, so behoueth it that the traynes prouided be stronger or weaker accordingly.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of hawk] WHen youre Hawke will kill a trayne lustely and boldly, then may you go into the field to find a wild Hearon at siege, and whe~ you haue found hir, winne in as nye to hir as you can, and go with your Hawke vnder the wind, where hauing first loosed hir hood in a readinesse, as soone as the Hearon leaueth the siege, off with hir hood, and let hir flee: and if shee climb to the Hearon, and beate hir so that she bring hir downe, runne in apace to reskewe hir, thrusting the Hearons bil into the ground, and breaking hir wings and legges, (as is aforesaid) feede hir and reward hir vpon youre hawking gloue, in maner before declared.
But if your hawke should fayle to beate downe the Hearon, or do giue him ouer, then shall you flee the Hearon no more with hir, vnlesse it bee with some other make Hawke, whiche is well entred and in good fleeing.
And thereby the vnskilful Hawke seeing that other Hawke flee at the Hearon and binde with hir, will take courage and flee eake with that other make Hawke eyther little or much, and if they kill the Hearon, then should they be fedde and rewarded togither while the quarry is hote, making them an Italian Soppa as before sayd.
And by this meanes the coward Hawke may be made bold and perfect.
But if it chance that any lusty roysting Hauke wil flee the Hearon of hir selfe without trayne, or ye Shoueler, the Falconer, shold let hir foote it, plume, and breake it vntill she finde bloud, and shold giue hir the Soppa, as Falconers do tearme it, for so they will become much bolder and the better Hearoners also.
But he that will worke surely to enter his Hawke at the Hearon, let him helpe hir by any practise or meanes that he can deuise: and these be the meanes and precepts to make a Falcon a good Hearoner. (&becaus) Of such Hawkes as flee from the fiste, and first of the Sacre.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of hawk or falcon] YOu must vnderstande that all sortes of Falcons are made too the Lewre after one selfe manner, but they are not hawked with all alike: for the Sacres, Lanners, Gerfalcons, Millions, and Merlins, do not flee the riuer, vnlesse happely the Laners do, which as vnderstand do flee the riuer in Fraunce: but they flee not single, but sundry Lanners at one time, more than a cast or a leasse of them at once, and so peraduenture do the Gerfalcon and the Million.
Whereof although there be fewe in this countrey which are made or flowen withall, yet will not spare to write what haue learned of them by heresay, beginning with the Sacre.
say that they are flowen withall from the fiste, in a playne field where there are fewest blockes, or stubbes, or such other impedime~ts, but that a man may gallop freely: men hawke with them to the Hearon, the Kight, and such like, as also at Feasant, Partridge, Quayle, and sometimes at the Hare, but with more than one single Hawke atonce as sayd before.
And in Cyprus they hawke with them to the Crane with the help of the peregrine Falcon in this order: When they haue founde the Crane, the Falconer doth loose his Hawkes hood in a readinesse (I meane the Peregrine Falcon) and drawing as neare to the Crane as he can vnder the winde, when shee riseth, hee quickly vnhoodeth his Hawke and lets hir flee, and after hir they cast off a cast or a lease of Sacres, which follow the peregrine Falcon, that leadeth them as the more weightie and valiant Hawke: and bycause the Crane striueth not at the encounter in defence as ye Hearon doth, but always fleeth right forthwards, therefore the Peregrine Falcon doth seaze vppon the Crane, and buckling with hir two or three boundes, the Sacres make in and beate hir downe to the ground vntill the Falconers come in to reskew their Hawkes, who speedely thrusting the Cranes bill into the ground, do eftsoone breake hir wings and legges (as they do the Hearnes,) bycause they do Hawkes most wrong with their legges and feete: whiche being done, they reward and feede all their Hawkes vpon the Crane, making them an Italian Soppa vppon their hawking gloue, of the braynes, marrow, and the hart, but geuing the peregrine a greater reward than the Sacres, (yet with discretion) they reward them all togither.
Those peregrine Falcons which are good for the Crane, are muche esteemed in Cyprus of great states, and so much the more, by how much they are more rare and passing in perfection.
But heere amongste vs this flight is not vsed, as well for that we haue no such ordinarie store of Cranes, as also bycause our fieldes are not so playne and free without fewell as theirs are in Cyprus.
This is the order in Cyprus, but in Fraunce, the chiefe vse of the Sacre, is to kill the Kite as haue touched, and partly made you shew in the description of the Sacre, in the former part of this collection.
But by this ye see, Euery countrie hath his custome. (&becaus) How to flee with the Lanner from the fiste.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of Lanner falcon] LAners are muche esteemed in Fraunce, for they flee with them (a caste or more at once) to the Ryuer also.
And bycause they are hawkes (whiche mainteyne long flightes,) they tyre a fowle in suche sorte, that with dogges and hawking poles they kill many, and by that meanes they spoyle more wt a Laner, than with a better hawke.
These Laners are flowen withall at Partridge also and Feasant, and some saye that many of them proue very good therefore.
But in Italie they vse no suche fleing, peraduenture bicause there is no greate skill in it.
If you would flee with a Laner, you must keepe hir maruelous short and sharpe sette.
For they are of the same nature that a Sacre, and that one (in manner) is made euen as that other is: and bicause they keepe their eastings long, by reason they are harde metteld hawkes, you shall not giue them casting of cotton, but of towe, or knottes of hempe, or the shauing of a Hasell wande.
And if you giue them any Cotton casting, yet put the towe or knottes of Hempe on the outside of it, and so bycause they take small pleasure therin, they will cast the sooner.
Let this suffise to be sayde of these kindes of hawkes, bycause they are ordinary, their natures too well knowen of all men.
Will speake some few words of the Gerfalcon and the Milion, whiche are all (in manner) of one nature, as ye hawkes laste rehearsed, and are made to the lewre in the selfe same manner.
These hawkes (as far as haue vnderstoode) do not flee the Riuer, but alwaies from the fist they flee the Hearons, Shouelers, and the Kight with the forked tayle, and at suche other flightes.
In going vp to their gate, they holde not that course or way whiche other Falcons do.
For they clyme vp vpon the trayne, when they finde any fowle, and as soone as they haue reached hir, they plucke hir downe, if not at the first, yet at the second or thirde incounter.
They are fedde and rewarded as other Falcons are: they are very craftie of nature, and couet to keepe their castings long through slouth.
Therefore you shall not giue them casting of Cotton, but of Towe, Hasell, or harde things, as you shall do the Sacre Laner.
And you must keepe them likewise very eager and sharpe set.
It is a hawke that is flowen withall by great states, Princes moste commonly.
And therefore will write no more of it, as one that haue no greate practise thereof.
YF you will flee with the Merlyne at Partridge, chuse the female, whiche is the larger, for they onely will proue good therevnto.
And in trayning or making the Iacke, you should but loose your time.
When you haue made the female Merlyne to the lewre, in maner before described, and that she will likewise abyde the hoode, you muste make hir a trayne with a Partridge, if you can get any, if not, then with some other liue birde, in suche order as hath bene set downe to trayne other hawkes.
And if she foote and kill it, then rewarde hir, suffring hir to take hir pleasure on it, &c.
This being done, you may strayghtwaies flee with hir the wilde Partridge: and if she take it at the first flight (whiche seldome happeneth) or if she flee it to marke and take it at the seconde flight, beeing retryued by the Spanels, feede hir vp vpon it with a reasonable gorge, cheering hir with your voyce, in such sort, that she may know the same.
But if she proue not hardie at the first traine, then you shall do wel to proue hir with another traine, before you flee with hir at the wilde game.
But if at the seconde trayne she proue not hardie, it is a token that shee is cowardly, and nothing woorth. (&becaus) To flee with the Merlyne at the Larke and Lenet.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of merlin falcon] Like it well that men flee with a caste of Merlynes at once at the Larke or ye Lenet.
For ouer and besides that they of themselues loue companie, and to flee togither, they do also giue greater pleasure or delyght to the lookers on.
For nowe that one (at the stouping) strikes the birde, and then that other at hir downe come: and when that one clymeth to the mowntie aboue the Larke, then that other lyeth lowe for hir beste aduauntage, whiche is moste delectable to beholde.
Yea and sometimes the poore birdes becomme so fearefull, that they shrowde themselues in the houses chambers of suche as dwell neare the fieldes.
So that both the birde and the hawke are oftentimes take~ both togither by the countryman.
And therfore it shall not be amisse to tye vnto their Iesses or Bewets some vervile, bearing the armes of their owner master (as if they were Falcons) to the ende they may be restored vnto the~.
But to returne to my purpose, saye that when the Merlynes are throughly manned, and made gentle, you may cary them into the fielde, where hauing founde a Larke or a Lenet, (making loose hir hoode) you must go as neare as you can into ye winde to the birde.
And as soone as the birde riseth from the grounde, vnhoode your cast of Merlines, and cast them to flee vntil they haue beaten downe the Larke or Lenet, and let them feede on hir for their labour indifferently.
But heerewithall note that there is a kinde of Larkes, (called cutte Larkes) whiche do not mounte as the long spurde fielde Larke doeth, but flee forheade before the Merlyn.
In any case let them not flee such Larkes, for neither will they make you like pastime, nor yet ca~ you flee them without daunger of leesing your Merlynes.
LEtte vs now speake of the order howe to mewe hawkes, and of the Mewes.
Firste to speake of Falcons, they maye bee flowen withall vntill Sainct Georges daye, that is aboute the myddest of Aprill.
And you muste diligently marke, whyther they haue any lyse or not.
And if they haue, pepper them to kyll the sayde lyse, and skowre them before you caste them into the mewe.
That beeing done, you may put them into the mewe.
There are two sundrie sortes of mewing, that is to saye, mewing loose at large, or at the Stocke: and will firste speake of this laste kinde of mewing.
THe place wherein you shoulde mew a hawke at the stocke, should be a lowe parler or chamber vpon the grounde, farre from any noyse or concourse of people, and situate towarde the North or Northeast.
Place therein a table of a conuenient length, for the number of your Falcons, and let it bee fiue or sixe foote broade at the leaste, with little thinne bordes or planckes all alongst the sides and endes, nayled on foure fingers high.
And lette this table be sette on trestles of twoo foote high, or three foote high from the grounde, and fill these tables with greate Sande whiche hath pretie little rounde pebble grauell stones in it: in middest whereof you may place some greate free stones a Cubite high, made like vnto a piller, flatte in the bottom, and playne smooth aboue, growing by peccemeale lesse and lesse vnto the toppe of them.
Wherevnto lette your hawkes be tyed, eyther Falcon, Gerfalcon, Myllion, or Merlyne.
Then take a small corde of the bignesse of a bowstring, or little more, put it through a ring, and binde it about the stone, in suche sorte that the ring or swyvle may go rounde about the stone, without any stoppe or lette: And thervnto tye the lease of a Falcon, which may so stand vpon the sayd stone being sette in the sande.
But you muste haue regard, that (if you mewe moe Falcons than one at once in one roome) you sette your stones one so farre from another, that when your hawkes bate, they maye not reache one another for crabbing.
The greate stones are set, for that a Falcon feeling the freshnesse and coolenes of the stone, will delight to sitte still vpo~ it, the little grauel stones are, bycause a hawke will ofte~tymes swallow them to coole hir within, and will keepe them some times twoo or three houres, or more within hir.
The sand also is necessary, bicause when they bate, they shall not marre their feathers, and also bicause thereby their mewtes are the eassier cleansed, and to bee remoued from them.
The little corde or bende with the ring on it, are tyed about the stone, bicause the Falcon bating this way and that way, she shall neuer twinde nor tangle, bicause the ring followeth hir still.
All daye your Falcons shoulde bee hooded vpon the stone, vnlesse it be when they would feede, for then only you must take them on ye fiste, vntill they haue fedde.
At night off with their hoodes, and bicause somtimes inconueniences do happen by night, the Falconer may do well to haue his bedde in the mewe, that he may the sooner and in tyme helpe or redresse any thing that shall happen amisse amongst his hawkes.
IF you woulde mewe your Falcon at libertie and at large, then must you mew but one at once in one roome, and yet if the circuite of your mewe be greate capable inough, there may two, three, or four Falcons be mewed therin wel inough (with diuisions.)
The scope for one Falcon muste bee twelue foote square, as muche in height, or thereabout, wt twoo windowes a foote and halfe broade, or two foote broade at the most.
Wherof that one should open towardes the North, wherby ye mewe may alwaies receyue freshe colde ayre, and ye other towards the East, for ye heate and co~fort of the Sunne.
And eche of these windowes should haue his close casementes on ye out side, to shut when you list, either one or both of them, according as occasion serueth.
If your hawke be a madbraine Kite, a great bater, then should it be beste that this mewe or chamber were on ye grounde, which if be so, you must couer the grounde with grosse sande foure fingers thicke, and therevpon sette a stone in suche sort as before sayde, bicause Falcons do couet to stande vpon a stone.
And therwithall you must make hir twoo handsome perches, neare to eache windowe one, that sitting on that one, shee maye haue the comforte of the Sunne, and on that other, the freshe of the coole ayre, and euery weeke, or at leaste euery fortnyght, you muste sette hir a latten bason, or a vessel of ston or eartheo, and at euening fyll it with water, that your hawke may to the water, if shee desire it.
And if shee doe bathe therein, then take it awaye the nyghte following, and haue regarde that your bason, panne, or suche other vessell bee of suche byggenesse and depth, that a hawke may therein commodiously bathe at ease.
Your mewe muste also haue a Portall, wherein there may be a little hole bilowe to conuey in the deuise whereon their meate is serued, called amongst Falconers, the Hacke.
Take a peece of thicke boorde, a foote and halfe long, and a foote broade, or thereaboutes, vnder the whiche fasten twoo little trestles three or foure fingers hyghe.
Then with an awger or a pearcer, boare twoo holes one eche side thereof, and through eche of these putte a shorte corde of the byggenesse of a bowestring, with the endes downewarde, through the holes and knottes faste knitte on them vnder the button of the borde, so strayghte knytte, that you cannot rayse the corde aboue the boorde more than a fingers breadth, or theraboutes.
And when you would giue your hawkes meate, take a little sticke somewhat longer than the Hacke, and as bigge as your finger, but let it be of strong woodde, as Crabtree, Holly, or such like.
And vpon that sticke binde your hawkes meate, put the endes of ye sticke vnder the cordes, vpon the Hacke, so conuey it into the mewe to your hawkes, bicause ye hawke shall not trusse or dragge hir meate away into ye mew, but may feede there.
And assoone as she hath gorged hir fed, take it away againe.
And it is to be vnderstood, yt if you mew more tha~ one hauke single, then must you haue for euery hauke hir seuerall Hacke.
And it shalbe good to kepe one set hour in feeding your hawke, for so shal they mew sooner better: thus may you mewe hawkes (loose at large.)
But vnlesse it be a Falcon which is so hotte and madbrayned, that you are forced to mewe hir so at large.
In mine opinion it shall be better to mewe at the Stocke or Stone, as before sayde, or else to mewe them at the Grate (as we call it.)
For in that kinde of mewing we take our hawkes on the fiste euery day, and so may see in what plight and state they be.
And if they be sicke, or fallen into any infirmitie, then may you giue them suche medicines as shall be declared in the next diuision, the whiche cannot be done when you mewe at large.
And therefore commende the mewing at the Grate, bicause many times our happe is to haue Haggardes, or Passengers, or Lentrers, the which haue flowen either to the Riuer, or prayed for themselues.
So that it shall be needefull to beare them often and euery morning in the coole ayre, vntyll midde Iulie, or more, or lesse, according as you shall see them ramage and coy, yea and to call them to the lewre, and to ride abroade with them also sometimes an houre or twoo, in the freshe ayre.
And it shall be a thing moste necessarie for a haggarde or a hawke that hath prayed for hir selfe, eyther more or lesse.
This haue obserued in mine owne experience, and me thinkes it an aduertisement woorthy the noting vnto all Falconers.
Sundry Gentlemen do vse to mewe their hawkes on the pearche, whiche truely can moste commende, as well for that they are then assured to be cleane fedde, as also to be dayly perused for lise, wormes, and other diseases, whereto they are by nature subiect. (&becaus) How to mew Marlins.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of merlin falcon] MArlins are also woorth the mewyng, if they bee hardie, and haue flowen well in theyr soreage.
For although some men bee of opinion, that a mewed Marline is seldome good, and that they are not possible to be mewed: yet haue had Marlins that (being good in their soreage) haue proued much better when they were mewed.
So that would wish him that hath a good Marlyn, to mew hir: for surely if you can mew them, they will proue better and better.
Some men in the mew doe vse to cast meale about their Marlyns, bycause they shoulde not eate theyr feete: but aswel bycause they may eate theyr feete howsoeuer they were mewed, if that were their propertie: as also bycause in those that haue mewed, haue found no such cruelty vsed towards themselues: therefore count it but a fable, nor will giue any other rules in the matter, than such as haue prescribed alreadie for the mewing of Falcons, and such like long winged hawkes.
YOu shall not neede to shew any other game to a Goshawke for hir first entring, than a Partridge, bycause in learning to flee the Partridge they proue most excellent.
And the first yeare you shall doe best to flee them to the fielde, and not to the couert, for so will they learne to holde out, (and not to turne tayle) in the middest of their flight.
And when they be mewed Hawkes, you may make them do what you will: and vnderstande you, that you shall not neede to take such paine, nor to vse such arte in making of a Goshawke which is taken a brauncher, as wyth a Nyasse, for she will alwayes knowe of hir selfe what to do.
Yea and it shall be rather better to let hir bee a little rammage still, than to man hir ouer much.
And if you would instruct hir to kill great fowles, make hir traynes thereof, as haue shewed in the treatie of Falcons.
And if you would haue hir continue at those flightes, then you must not let hir flee any lesser fowles, for that would quickly marre hir.
If you woulde make hir to flee with a Spanell or Dogge to helpe and assiste hir, then feede your Goshawke with great fowles, as Cranes, Wildegeese, and such like, and giue your Dogge fleshe tyed vnder the wings of suche fowles, when you trayne your Hawke with them, and let your Dogge be rewarded with the sayd fleshe, when you reward your hawke vpon the traine: and alwayes acquaint the Dog and the Hawke well togither.
And this order you shall obserue for a month, or vntill your dogge will throughly knowe his dutie.
And euermore keepe your dogge tyed vp: for if you let him go loose, it wil marre him if he were the best that euer was.
And neuer giue him rewarde of flesh, but when he maketh in at such fowles to rescue the Hawke.
Call your Goshawke to none other thing than to your fist.
Yet sometymes you may take hir downe with a dead Pullet, or such like.
And oftentymes spowte good wine vppon your Hawkes Seare, obseruing the order to set hir to the water, as is before rehearsed in the treatise of Falcons.
Euermore note that a Goshawke (for that she is dainty) would be cured with sweete things ministred in all suche receytes as you shall giue hir. (&becaus) To make fleeing the Goshawke, either Niasse or Ramage.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of goshawk] YOu shall firste obserue manye things alreadie written of other kindes of Hawkes: as to seele and watch your hawke, winne hir to feede, to the hoode, and to the fyst, and diuerse other such points which should be but tedious to rehearse.
Therfore let me write of the order howe to make a flight with a Goshawke, eyther Niasse or Ramage, the whiche is very harde to doe well.
And for my part woulde not counsell any man to trouble himselfe much with them.
But if any man haue a Niasse or Ramage Goshawke, whereof he woulde see the proofe, let him man hir, and make hir to the fist: then let him enter hir first to yong Partridges, vntill it be Nouember.
In which tyme the fieldes are rydde cleane, and become emptie, and the trees bare of leaues: then may you enter hir to the olde Rewen, setting hir short and eager.
And if shee kill at first, or seconde flight, feede hir vp for three or foure tymes with the Partridge whiche shee hath killed: by that meanes haue seene some of them come to good perfection.
YOur Sore Goshawkes, or your Haggardes, shall be trimmed with Iesses, Bewets and Belles, as soone as they come to your handes: and you shall by all meanes make them abyde the hoode well, the which will be best brought to passe, keeping them seeled, and hooding and vnhooding them oftentymes, and teaching them to feede on the fyst three or foure dayes, more or lesse vntill they leaue theyr ramagenesse and coynesse, and become gentle: that being done, vnseele them at night by candlelight, causing them to plume or tyre vpon a wing or legge of a Pullet, and vse your Hawkes gently, and deale the best wyth them that you can deuise, vntill you haue throughly manned and woonne them, and that in secrete places where they may not see much light, setting them vpon a Pearche, and vsing all diligence to make them iumpe to the fist by little and little, vntill at last they will come three or foure yeardes from you, and feeding them most with the legges of Pullets or Calues hearts: then you may go into a Garden, or into a Close abrode, and causing them to feede first a bit or two vpon your fist, with their hoodes on, and afterwards asmuch with their hoodes off, cast them down fayre and softly to some Pearche, and make them come from it to your fist eyther much or little, with calling and chirping to them, saying: Towe, Towe, or Stowe, Stowe, as Falconers vse, and when they come feed them, crying and calling still to make them acquainted with your voyce.
The next day you may call them with a Cryance, setting them vpon a Pearche vntill they come vnto you further off, feeding and rewarding them liberally to make them loue you.
And when they come to the fist redily and without checking or ramagenesse, then lay a little from you a dead Pullet vpon the ground, the hawke sitting vpon the Perch, and calling and chirping to hir, if she come and seaze the Pullet, let hir plume hir and feede a bit or two thereon, walking aboute hir vntill you may without daunger or mouing of hir, come neare and take hir vpon your fist, and so feede hir: That beeing done, let hir tyre and plume.
Here must aduertise you that the wing of a Pullet colde, is not good feeding for a Hawke: for it will make a Hawke sicke: But the legges eyther hote or colde may be giuen.
And likewise you shall marke that would haue you cast out a Pullet to a Goshawke deade and not aliue: for these kinde of Hawkes are much enclyned of nature to play the Poulters.
So that if you should vse to throw the~ out liue poultrie, it might make them sometymes when they flee turne tayle to the Partridge, and seaze the Pullets or Chickens which they shall see in husbandmens yardes and backsydes when they flee.
Or in lyke maner when they are set to bathe at length of theyr loynes, the which would not onely marre them, and make them full of ill properties, but also might cause the ignorant people (as women and boyes) to kill them in steade of a Puttocke.
When you haue thus called your Goshawke abrode two or three dayes vntill she be well cunning, you shall take hir on your fist, and get vp on horsebacke with hir, and so ryding with hir the space of an houre or there aboutes, vnhoode and hoode hir sometymes, and giue hir a bitte or two of meate in the presence and sight of your Spaniels, bicause shee shall not be afearde of them.
That being done, set hir on a tree with a little short Cryance tyed to hir loynes, and going seuen or eight yeardes from hir on horsebacke, call hir to your fist with such voyce and wordes, as Falconers vse: and if she come, giue hir two or three bittes for rewarde, and cast hir vp againe to the tree, then throw out the dead Pullet eight or ten yeardes from hir.
If she flee to it and seaze it, let hir feed three or foure bittes vpon it, ryding the meane while about hir on horsebacke, and rating backe your Spaniels, bycause they shall not rebuke hir at first, and so make hir euer after fearefull of dogges.
Then alight off your horse, gently take hir vpon your fyst, feede hir, and when you haue so done, hoode hir and let hir plume or tyre.
Here will say for mine owne opinion, that a deade Partridge, or a counterfeyte Partridge, made with the verie plumage, wings and tayle of a Partridge, were much better to throwe out vnto your Goshawke, bycause it woulde make hir both know Partridge the better, and poultrie the lesse.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of goshawk] WHen your Goshawke is thus manned and cunning, then may you go into the fielde with hir, carying with you a trayne Partridge if need be: and vnhooding your Hawke, beare hir as quietly as you can: you may lette hir plume or tyre a little to make hir eagre.
And if the Partridge spring let hir flee: if she marke one or two or more on the ground, then go to hir faire and softly, and manacing hir with your hande, or with a wande, cause hir to take Pearche on some tree thereby.
Then if you can retryue the Partridge with your Spaniels, as soone as it springeth, you must crie Howit, Howit: and if she flee it to the marke agayne, you must put hir to a tree, and retryue it the second time, crying when it springeth as before sayde And if shee kill it, feed hir vp with it: but if so chaunce that the Spaniels should take it, as oftentymes hote Spaniels light vpon the Partridge, being eyther flowen out of breath, or otherwise surcharged with feare: then alight from your Horse quickly, and taking it from the Spaniell, cast it out to your Hawke crying, ware Hawke ware and let hir feed hir fill on it.
The next day you shall not flee with hir, bycause hauing fed and rewarded hir with bloudie meat, she will not so soone be in good case to flee againe.
For such meate is not so easily indewed by a Hawke, as the legge of a Chicken or such like.
Vsing hir thus three or foure tymes, she will be well in bloud, and become well fleeing at this pleasant field flight.
Howe to helpe a Hawke that turneth tayle to tayle, and giueth ouer hir game.
IT happeneth oftentymes, that when you haue let your Goshawke flee at a Partridge, she will neyther kill it, nor flee it ot marke, but turneth tayle to tayle, as Falconers terme it: that is when she hath flowen it a bowshot or more, she giueth it ouer, and takes a tree.
Then shall you call in your Spaniels to the retryfe, that way that your Hawke flewe the Partridge.
And the Falconer drawing himselfe that way, may cast hir oute a quicke Partridge which he shall carie for suche purposes in hys Hawking bagge, in suche sort as the Hawke may see it, and thinke that it is the same whiche she flewe.
And so crying when you cast it out, ware Hawke ware, make hir seaze it and feede hir vpon it, that she may be encouraged thereby to flee out with a Partridge.
The day following you shall not flee with hir, as is before sayde, but prepare hir agaynst the thirde day and set hir sharpe: and if then also your Goshawke giue ouer, serue hir with a quicke Partridge againe.
But if shee doe it the thirde tyme, woulde not wishe you to trouble your selfe anye longer with suche a vile Buzarde, but ridde your handes of hir, for sure it is great oddes that shee will neuer proue good.
And yet if anye man wyll trye his Hawke to the vttermoste, then let him make hir flee a Partridge whiche is flowne to the marke wyth some other well entered Hawke, at the first or seconde flight.
And if she kill that, let him feede and rewarde hir well, vsing hir to such flightes three or foure tymes, and so peraduenture shee may learne to holde out, and mainteine hir flight the better.
FOrasmuch as the Goshawkes which are taken in September, or October, do not know their pray so well as they which are taken later, since they haue not prayed so long as those olde, it happeneth many tymes that when they are made to the first, and brought euen to the poynt to flee, if you let them flee at a Partridge, they take a tree and will not flee at all.
To redresse that, you shall go into a plaine fielde where are no trees, with a quicke Partridge, the which you shal giue to some of your companie, your selfe shall ryde vp and downe halfe an houre with your hawke vpon your fist vnhooded: and then drawing neare to your co~panion which hath the Partridge, when you come within ten or twelue paces of him, let him priuily cast out the Partridge, and let your Hawke flee at it: which done, rewarde and feed hir well therevpon.
If peraduenture your Goshawke haue need of more such traynes, then you may co~tinue it three or foure tymes, vntill she be well in bloud with such flightes.
But surely such Hawkes are not greatly to be regarded.
The same that is sayde of Goshawkes, is to be vnderstoode also of Tercels.
And alwayes remember that the next day after you haue rewarded and fedde your Hawke vpon the fowle or byrde that she killeth, feede hir the nexte daye with sheepes harte, or Hennes legges betymes in the morning, to bring hir in order agayne to flee.
SOre Goshawkes (especially Niasses are commonly verye fonde of the man, and therefore shoulde bee flowne with a little more ramage, and before they bee throughly reclaymed, for else oftentymes wythin two or three strokes with theyr wings, they will giue ouer the fowle that they flee, and returne streight agayne to theyr keeper.
Therefore remember to flee with them assoone as you can, and that vntill they be perfectlye nousled and in bloud.
They must also bee set in places where they see not manye folke, for feare they become verye fonde of the manne: But when they haue flowne, and haue killed twice or thrice, then set them where people and Dogges frequent, the whiche shall bee necessarie, to preuent the inconuenience whiche might happen, when they are at marke neare to a house, or vpon a high way, if then they shoulde bee discouraged wyth sodayne sight of any persone that went by.
And yet by this aduertisement of fleeyng quickly with a Sore Goshawke or a Niasse, might make some Falconer learne a woorse mischiefe, if by fleeing ouer soone with his Hawke, hee shoulde pull hir downe, or make hir poore, the whiche woulde cause hir to become fearefull and cowardlye, and to giue ouer a Partridge, as haue seene dyuerse, that although they were at the fyrste verye towarde Hawkes, yet after they haue beene once pulled downe, they haue loste theyr courage and goodnesse.
And therefore by what meanes soeuer a Goshawke or Tercell shall become poore, it shall bee the Falconers parte fyrste to sette hir vppe agayne, before he flee with hir, vnlesse it bee some Goshawke (whereof there are but fewe) which will not flee when shee is hie, and in good plight.
Then the Falconer may somewhat bate hir fleshe, and pinche hir with scouring, washt meate and such like deuises: But let him alwayes rather keepe his Hawke in such wise, that shee may flee when she is lustie: and therewithall let him set hir abroade (when it is not ouer colde) betymes in the morning for one houre or twaine.
For beeing so weathered, when shee hath flowne a Partridge to the marke, she will not away, vntill it be retryued by the Spaniels.
That a Goshawke being a good Partridger, be not flowen with to the Feasant.
IF your Goshawke be once a good Partridger, beware that you let hir not flee the Poute, or the Feasant, for the Feasant fleeth not so long a flight as the Partridge doth.
And therefore the Goshawke being naturally more rauenous and desirous of pray than any other Hawke, woulde more delight to flee a short flight to the Feasant, and will care lesse to holde out at a Partridge.
True it is that some are good for both, but those are verie rare: And therefore you must haue consideration thereof, as also to keepe them in good order with fleeing, bathing, weathering, tyring, pluming, and dyuerse other poynts of Falconrie, the which do serue also for Tercels aswell as for Goshawkes.
THe traynes whiche you vse to giue Sore Goshawkes and Niasses, are not so requisite for a haggarde.
For the Sorehawkes and Niasses when they are made to the fist, and to seaze a Pullet vpon the grounde, will then abyde and neuer sore away, and may immediately be flowen withall at a Partridge, so that you beare a liue traine Partridge with you to serue hir if neede be, as hath bene heretofore declared in entering of other hawkes.
And the principall poynt of consideration is, that you encourage any Hawke well at the first.
In fleeing with a Goshawke, it happeneth oftentymes that fleeing in the Snowe, and killing their pray vpon the grounde, they fill their Belles with Snowe, so that the Falconer cannot tell where to finde them.
At suche tymes then, fasten a Bell vpon the two couert feathers of your Hawkes Stearne or Trayne, and that aloft neare to hir rumpe.
For so doe the Falconers of Dalmatia vse at all times of the yeare to flee with their Hawkes.
And it is a good meane to know at all times where, and what is become of your Hawke.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of goshawk] NOwe haue (in mine owne iudgement) set downe as muche as is necessarie, to make a Goshawke perfect in killing of a Partridge or any other fielde flight: will also declare howe you maye flee to the Ryuer with a Goshawke, and howe you may kill greate fowles wyth hir.
Goshawke (but no Tercell) may flee to the Ryuer at Mallacde, Ducke, Goose, Hearon, and suche lyke, whether it bee bycause she proueth not to the fielde, or for any other delight that shee or hir keeper hath to the Ryuer.
And you shal holde this order in making hir, the which doubtlesse shall bring hir to perfection: For Goshawkes do more willingly flee suche flightes than at any other.
And yet is there great difference seene in the proofe of them: for some of them proue muche hardyer and better than some other doe.
Well, the Falconer shall fyrst make his Goshawke to the fist, in suche sorte as haue prescribed, when taughte to flee them vnto the fielde.
Then muste hee carrie hir into the fielde wythoute Belles, with a liue Ducke gyuen vnto one of his Companions.
And the Falconer muste haue with him a little Drumme or Taberde fastened to the Pommell of his Saddle, togither with the sinewe of an Oxe legge dryed, whiche shall serue him to strike vppon his Drumselet or Taberde: and causing his Companion to hide himselfe in a ditche, or pitte, with the Ducke tyed to a Cryaunce, his Hawke beyng vnhooded vppon his fyst, hee shall drawe towardes his companion whiche standeth so hidde in couert.
And when hee is neare him within two or three paces, or little more, hee shall strike vppon his Tabarde twice or thrice: and his Companion hearing him, shall throwe out the Ducke aloft.
And let the Falconer cast off his Goshawke to it, and if shee take it at the Sowrce, let him rewarde hir and feede hir with a reasonable gorge, making hir all the cheare that may be: then let him take hir vpon his fyst and hoode hir, suffering hir to plume or to tyre vppon a wing or a legge of the Ducke.
The next day he shall not flee with hir, as before haue admonished.
But the thirde day hee may go againe in lyke maner with hys Companion, or else maye seeke some water pashet or pitte where wyldefowle lye, as Teales or suche lyke.
Prouided alwayes that hee seeke the aduauntage of his flighte, where the Banckes bee high: For the higher that the bankes be, the better he may come to make his flight: and in suche a place, he and his Companion, one on the one syde, that other on the other, maye ryde fayre and softly vntill they finde fowle, and yet put them not vppe.
When they haue founde them, bothe of them shall drawe backe along by the Bancke, and the Hawke beeing vnhooded, they shall trotte bothe of them ryght vppon the fowle with theyr Horses.
When they bee neare them, hee whiche hathe the Tabarde shall beate it, so that the Fowle maye ryse, and then hee maye lette flee hys Hawke: and if shee take anye of them at Sowrce, let him make in to hir a pace, and crosse the Fowles winges, so that shee maye foote it and plume it at hir pleasure, rewarding hir as before .&c.
And the better to encourage hir when hee hathe hooded hir, let him sette hir vppon the Fowle, and let hir plume it hir fyll, and after let him take hir on his fist, and giue hir a wing or a legge of the Fowle to tyre on: And the next day let him not flee .&c.
And when hys Hawke is throughly nousled and in bloude, then hee maye flee twice in a day or oftner with hir, rewarding hir as before is expressed.
Vsing his Hawke thus, hee shall so well encourage hir, that hee maye flee the oftener wyth hir at hys pleasure.
SOme delight to flee Wildegeese and Cranes with a Goshawke, and such other great flightes.
And the traine must bee made in this wise: When the hawke is made to the fist as before sayde, let him go on foote abroade into the fielde with his Goshawke on his fist, carying with him a Wildegoose, or a tame Goose of the colour of a Wildegoose, tyed by the tayle with a Cryaunce.
And hauing sette hir on the grounde eyght or tenne Paces from him, lette hym vnhoode the Hawke, and twitche the Goose wyth the Cryaunce vntyll hee, make it stirre and flicker with the wings.
Then if his Goshawke bate at it, caste hir off, and runne in to succour hir, so that the Goose beate hir not with hir wings, for discouraging hir.
And if hee haue store of traynes, then he shall rewarde and feede hir on the braynes, hearte, and thyghe of that whiche hee trayned withall.
But if hee haue no store, then it shall bee needefull to saue that for another trayne.
This done, lette him closely conuey a Pygeon vnder the wing of the trayne, and rewarde his hawke therewith, as hathe beene heeretofore declared in the traynes to the Hearon.
And the nexte daye lette hir not flee, but sette hir downe, &c.
The thirde day he may giue hir another trayne, somewhat further off.
And the thirde trayne he shall gyue it hir on horsebacke, fiftie or three score paces off at the leaste, or so farre off as hee maye come in to succoure his hawke in tyme.
His hawke beeing thus trayned and entred, he may ride out with his hawke (without belles, bicause the Geese shall not ryse before the Falconer haue broughte his hawke to the vauntage) then with his Tabard to beate it vp, so forth, whereof haue tolde before.
And hauing founde any wilde geese, he shall shewe them to his hawke, who being naturally mooued, will make from the fiste to them, and will flee lowe by the grounde, vntill she come neare them.
Then the Falconer shall ryde after apace, and strike vpon his Tabarde, vntill hee rayse the Wildegeese.
And if his hawke seaze any of them at Source, hee shall quickely succoure hir, and rewarde hir, &c.
But for as muche as Wildegeese will rise as soone as they see any bodie.
Therefore the Falconer muste teache his hawke to take the aduauntage, whiche is thus done: As soone as hee hath founde them a farre off, lette him alyghte from his horse, and carrye his hawke vnhooded behinde his horse, stawking towardes them, vntill he haue gotten reasonably neare them, holding downe his hawke couerte vnder the horse necke or bodie, in suche sorte, that shee maye finde the Geese.
Then the Falconer shall runne in apace, and strike vppon his Tabarde, to rayse the Geese.
And if she kill any of them, rewarde hir, &c. Vsing his hawke in this order, shee may be made to kill twoo or three, or more, in a daye.
And in like manner maye shee bee made to the Crane.
And in like sorte may he creepe to flee at fowle which lye vpon pyttes, or pondes.
First shewing them to his hawke, and letting hir drawe to them, and then running in to putte them vp with his Tabarde.
But the Falconer muste take heede, that as long as hee may finde greate flightes, hee flee not at smaller fowle, to the ende his hawke may continewe the more boldly to flee greate flightes.
For a man maye soone make a hawke a cowarde and a slugge.
Yet some there bee, (but those are very rare) whiche fleeing at all kindes of fowles, becomme still hardyer and hardyer, and better and better.
Nowe hauing wrytten sufficiently of suche flightes, wyll passe ouer to teache the meanes to mewe a Goshawke.
WHen you haue flowen either with Goshawke or Tercell, foare, or haggarde, vntill Marche, giue hir some good quarrey in hir foote, and foreseing that she be cleane from lyse, cutte off the buttons of hir Iesses, and throwe hir into the mewe, the whiche may bee a roome either bylowe, or on the grounde, set towardes the North if it be possible.
And as for the bygnesse, so that it be not too little, lette it be as large as you will, and let the pearches therein be lyned with Canuas or Cotton, so that the hawke hurte not hir feete therevppon: for thereby shee might catche eyther the gowte, or the pynne.
Let the mewe also haue a windowe toward the East, and another towarde the North, to take freshe ayre, and the comforte of the Sunne.
You shall also prouide in the same mewe, a Bason or other vessell for water, and euery three dayes at the moste, chaunge and shifte the water.
And feede your hawke eyther with Pygeons, or with Quayles, or else with hotte fleshe of a Weather or gelded Goate, for that will make hir mewe well and quickly.
ABout the beginning of October, if you perceiue your Goshawke faire mewed, and harde penned, then gyue hir either chickens, or Lambes heartes, and Calues hearts, by the space of .xx. dayes togither, to skowre hir and to make hir slise out the slymie substance and glytte out of hir pannell, and to enseame hir (as Falconers terme it.)
That being done, one euening you may draw hir out of the mewe, and new furnish hir with Iesses, Bells, Bewets, and of all other things that shalbe nedefull.
And when you haue seeled hir, keepe hir so seeled twoo or three dayes, vntill she will be gently hooded.
And therof a Falconer ought to haue a speciall regarde.
For commonly all mewed hawkes are as coy to be hooded, as whe~ they were first taken.
But when you haue woonne hir to abyde the hoode gently, then in an euening by candle lyght you may vnseele hir, and the nexte daye you may go aboute to shewe hir the fiste and the gloue.
And as haue before aduised you to deale with Haggardes, or hawkes new taken from the Cage, you shall not forget to let hir tyre and plume morning and euening, giuing hir somtimes in the morning, when hir gorge is emptie, a little Suger Candie, for that will helpe hir maruelously to endewe.
Sometimes also when shee is emptie in gorge, and panell, you shal giue hir skowrings of Aloes Cicotryne, Cloues, Stauesaker, wrapped in a little peece of Cotto~ or in Towe, or lynen cloth.
But hereof shalbe written more playnely in the treatise of medicines.
WHen the Falconer shall perceyue his Goshawke to feede eagerly, and perceyueth by his iudgemente that shee is enseamed, and that hee may boldely flee with hir: then lette him go into the fielde, and finding Partridge, if the hawke bate at them of hir owne accorde, it is a token, that shee is emptie, and readie to flee: but if shee bate not, then doth it betoken the contrary.
Therefore in suche case feede hir still with washte meates, and things conuenient, as long as you shall thinke requisite.
For doubtles if she be once throughly enseamed and readie, shee will flee of hir owne accorde.
And then if shee kill, feede and rewarde hir as hath bene before declared.
But if she flee to the marke with a Partridge, then you muste retriue it, and serue hir as is also before expressed.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of sparrowhawk] SParowhawkes are to be considered of as all other kinds of hawkes are, according to their age and disposition.
Some of them are named Nyasses, some Braunchers, some Soarehawkes, and some mewed hawkes: Some also Haggards, beeing mewed in the woodde, they are called Nyasses, which are taken in the eyree.
Branchers are those, that hauing forsaken the eyree, are fedde by the olde hawke vpon the boughs and branches neare about the eyree, and therevpon they are called Branchers: afterwards they are called Soarehawkes.
They are called Soarehawkes, bicause when they haue forsaken the woodde, and beginne to pray for themselues, they flee vp aloft vpon pleasure, which with vs Falconers is called soring.
Mewed hawkes are all hawkes that haue once or more shifted their feathers: and Haggards are they whiche pray for themselues, do also mewe themselues either in the woodde, or otherwise at large.
To beginne with the Nyasse, whiche is of greatest difficultie to bring vnto anye perfection, you muste firste feede hir in some freshe coole chamber or parler vpon the ground.
And ye same chamber shold haue two windowes not very large, wherof that one should open towards the North, and that other towardes the Easte, to take the freshe coole ayre, or the comforte of the Sunne at hir pleasure.
These windowes muste be open, barred ouerthwarte with lathes, or thinne bordes, so thicke that neyther your hawkes maye gette oute, nor your Catte maye come in.
And in this chambee caste and strewe Vyne leaues, and other freshe leaues.
For it refresheth a hawke maruellousely to reste vppon them.
And for the same consideration it shall not bee amisse, to sette twoo or three greate free stones in the chamber, wherevppon the Hawkes may sitte coole fresh.
You must also haue twoo or three pearches lyned or couered, one a little higher than another, so that the hawke as she groweth huger and huger, may flee from one pearche to another, and neuer hurte hir feete.
And whe~ she is full sommed, so as she can flee, then will it be meete and moste necessarie to sette some large bason, or other vessell full of water, that shee maye bathe hir at pleasure therein.
For that is not onely very holesome for hir body, but also will make hir put out hir feathers ye better, the faster.
And you shall doe well to shifte hir water euery three dayes.
You shall feede hir with yong Sparrowes, Martelettes, and yong Pygeons, and sometimes with Sheepes heartes: and whyles shee is very yong and little, you shoulde cutte hir meate, and shredde it in small pellettes vpon a trencher, or a cleane borde for the purpose, setting it so neare hir, that shee maye reache it with hir beake, and feede.
Thus you shall feede hir twice, or more euery daye, euen as you shall see hir endewe it, or (as Falconers saye) putte it ouer.
Beware that you gyue hir not gorge vpon gorge, for that wyll make hir caste hir gorge.
But when shee is full sommed, and fleeth aboute, then you shall doe better to gyue hir whole birdes, and sometimes to feede hir vppon your fiste, suffring hir to kill and strayne the lyue birdes in your hande: Yea and sometimes to put quycke birdes into the chamber to hir, that shee maye learne to knowe them, to foote them, and to kill them: and lette hir feede vppon them hir selfe in your presence.
For that shall bee very good, as well to nowsel hir, as also to make hir leaue that vyle condition which commonly all Nyasses haue, whiche is, to carry and hyde their praye in some hedge or ditche, or secrete place: and therein they will sitte very close for beeing hearde, when they heare or perceyue their keeper to seeke them.
And also it shall not be amisse, euery morning to go into the sayde chamber, and to call them to the fiste, whistling and chirping with your mouth, for by yt meanes you shal both manne them throughly, and also you shall gayne the time which you should else spend afterwardes, in making them when they were ready to bee drawen out of the sayde chamber.
WHen your Nyasse Sparowhawke hath put foorthe all hir feathers, is full sommed, then shall you take hir out of the chamber, and furnishe hir with belles, bewets, Iesses, and lynes.
And by my counsell you shall also feele hir at the firste, to make hir gentle to abyde the hoode, whiche is contrarie to hir nature, and to make hir tractable to be handled, vsing hir fauourably and louingly alwayes: and at the firste with a hoode whiche is too greate and large, to hoode and vnhoode hir oftentimes, stroking hir heade softely with your hande, vntill shee wyll stande styll, and abyde the hoode gently.
Then in an euening by lyghte of a candle you shall vnseele hir, gyuing hir somewhat to tyre vpon, handling hir and stroking hir feathers gently, sometimes hooding and vnhooding hir.
And bicause Nyasse Sparowhawkes are seldom made perfect and good without greate paynes and diligence, therfore obserue these things, and vse them accordingly, if you will haue a good Nyasse hawke.
WHen your Nyasse is well wonne to the hoode, and to the fiste, lette hir kill small birdes vppon your fiste, then call hir twoo or three dayes togyther, vntill shee wyll come farre off.
Then you muste take a quycke Pygeon tyed by one foote with a Cryaunce, and stirre it vntyll your hawke wyll bate at it, and seaze it, though not farre off, yet as you may, and helpe hir at the firste, leaste the Pygeon struggling with hir, be too strong, and discourage hir.
Then lette hir plume hir and foote hir, and feede hir therevpon with as muche fauour as you maye, and whistle to hir, to make hir knowe your whystle, vntyll shee haue taken a resonable gorge.
Then hoode hir vp, and lette hir plume or tyre a lyttle afterwardes.
They daye following you shall call hir to the fiste, and shewe hir a lyue Pygeon, so neare that shee maye reache at it with hir beake.
Then caste it oute before hir, vntyll shee flee it, and take it.
That done, rewarde hir, &c. Agayne you shall another tyme throwe oute a chicken before hir, and if shee take and foote it, rewarde hir, &c. Afterwardes you shall cause one to hide himselfe close in a ditch or pitte, and throw hir out a Pigeon or Pullet, if she take it, reward hir and feede hir vp with the braynes, hart, and a legge or a wing, whistling, chirping, and speaking to hir to encourage hir: and this order you shall obserue awhile, stil seruing hir with greater and greater traynes: for by that meanes you shall giue hir courage to flee, yea if it were at a Feasant, for that chickens are some of them not much vnlike a Feasant poult.
As also vsing hir to greate chickins, shee will neuer couet to carry as shee would do if you trayned hir with smaller birds, which is a thing woorthy the obseruation, as you shall find by experience.
And when you haue giuen hir sufficient traines of chicken and such like, you shall one day set hir sharp, then take a Quayle tied in a Criance, and in a playne meadowe: First shew hir vnto your Sparowhawke, then throw it vp aloft and cast your Hawke off handsomly after hir, and if she take it, reward hir with the braynes to nousse and encourage hir, but feede hir with the legge of a chicken or Pullet, and deale daintely with hir.
The next time you may trayne hir with a Quayle withoute a criance, the which hauing a legge broken, and two feathers pluckt out of each wing, giue it to another which may closely throwe it out to hir, and feede hir vp therevppon with a good gorge.
Being thus oftentimes trayned, you may ride out into the fields about nine of the clocke, where calling your sparowhawke to youre fiste and giuing hir a bitte or two of meate, go with your Spaniels to seke some Beauie of yong Quayles, aduauncing your fiste aloft, that your Hawke may see them when they spring, and let hir flee with aduauntage at the firste.
If she kil, reward and feede hir, &c. but if she misse, or that you find no yo~g Quayles, then serue hir with a trayne of a Quayle as is often before sayd.
WHen your Sparowhawke is once made, you may goe freely into the field: and if you find any yong Quaile let hir slee thereat with asmuch aduauntage as you can: and if she take it, reward and feede hir &c. Remember that at first entring of your Hawke you hold your fiste aloft alwayes, aswell bycause youre Hawke maye see the game spring, as also that she may learne to haue an eye to the Dogges, the whyche you shall alwayes cause to hunt on your right hand whe~ they raunge, but especially when they quest and call, to the ende you maye the better and at more aduauntage cast off youre Hawke whe~ you let hir flee.
And when your Sparowhawke doth know hir game and how to flee, then may you flee more than one flight in a forenoone or an afternoone, so that always you giue hir some smal reward at euery flight that she killeth.
And bycause it behoueth muche alwayes to encourage youre Hawke, and to keepe hir well nousled, you shall doe well euer to carrie a liue Quayle with you, that if you find none, or flee and misse, you may therewith trayne or serue youre Hawke accordingly: and you maye cause it so to be cast out vnto hir, that she will thinke it is sprong with the Spanells.
As also would wish you euermore to keepe aliue the seco~d Quaile that you shall take, and keepe it in your hawking bagge, so as if neede be, it may serue you at night or at any time to reward your Hawke with: for keeping your Hawke in this order, she can neuer lightly be discouraged.
And when youre Hawke is throughly entred and perfectly well in fleeing, and well nousled, then you shall hold your hande lowe, whereas before you held it aloft.
For your Hawke being much quicker sighted tha~ you are, she will sooner see the game spring also, and bate at the whurre, as we tearme it: then before the Hawke can reeouer your fiste, the game is flowen farre off to hir great disaduantage: yea although you should let hir go when she bateth, yet shall she not flee with such aduauntage as you might lette hir flee when she and you both spied the game spring at once.
He therefore that will be a perfect keeper of a Sparowhawke or such like, must haue a quicke eye, and a good consideration and regard to the Spanells, keeping them still as neare as he can vpon his right hand, and hold his hande lowe, bycause hys Hawke shall not bate at the game before he see it.
And also it shall not be good to be ouer neare the Dogges, but rather a little aboue them, that you maye let youre Hawke flee coasting at the vantage when the game springeth, and alwayes to be quicke of eye and nimble of hand, for he that is not so, nor regardeth the aduauntages of a flight, shall hinder hys Hawke whereas hee myghte further and helpe hir.
How to make a Sparowhawke, being eyther Sorehavvke, ramage, or mevved Hawke.
NOw haue spoken at large of Nyasse Sparowhawkes, it were meete that should set downe some instructions also concerning Ramage Hawkes, and suche as are taken when they haue prayed for themselues.
And yet in effect the same precepts that serue for a Nyasse, wyll serue also for ramage Hawkes and mewed Hawkes.
But yet they, (I meane ramage and mewed Hawkes) require not so muche payne to make them know their game nor to enter them, bycause they haue bene practised in praying for themselues, and the Nyasses are altogether ignorant and simple: so that the Nyasses must be taught to knowe their game, in a manner, euen as they are taught by the breeder in the wood, the whyche (as haue heard old Falconers tell) when hir yong Hawkes go out of the nest and can hoppe or flecke from one bough to another, commeth in with some pray vnto them, and calling them altogether, she fleeth aloft and lets the bird fall amongst them, so that which soeuer of them catcheth it with hir tale~ts, feedeth vppon it for that meale, and then returneth the olde Hawke for some pray, vntill she haue fedde them all taughte them to foote their pray And therefore when a man hath them Nyasse which neuer wer taught so by the breeder, he must practise as neare as he can like the old Hawke, to teache them to foote and to kill their pray and to know it, the which you shall not be troubled with in a soare rammage or metred Hawke.
For they whiche beare those names, haue learnt to praye for themselues: and most of all the mewed haggard Hawkes, for they are throughly nousled and trayned therein, yea and most commonly they haue learnt such conditions, that with all the paynes we can take, fewe of them can be brought to any good perfection.
But he whiche hathe a Haggard Sparowhawke, must aboue all things take paynes in weyning hir from that vile fault of carying, and that shall he do by seruing hir often with great Pullets, and other great traynes the which she ca~not carrie, and therby, she will learne to abide vpon the quarrey.
Also they whiche delight in Haggards, must take greate heede that they offend them not, but rather coye them as much as they can with all deuises of fauor cherishing, for they wil remember fauor or iniurie muche better than any other kynde of Hawke.
And of the same condition are Lentmers for the most part, the whiche are called with vs March Hawkes, or Lentmers, bycause they are taken in Lent with lime or suche like meanes.
And the Italians call them Marzarolli, bycause they are taken in March or thereabouts: so that the Etymologie of the name proceedeth all vpon one cause, and they are called so whether they be Soare Hawkes or mewed hawkes.
Neither is there any great difference betwene them and haggards for euill conditions, but the Lentmers are more subiect to moyst humors, and especially in the head, and therefore you must plie them with casting and skowring, as shall bee more at large declared in the treatise of medicines.
Certayne obseruations for an ostreger in keeping of a Goshawke.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of man with falcon] MAny times it hapneth yt a Goshawke or a Tercell whiche was good in hir Sorage, doth become nothing so toward or good when shee is mewed: and that proceedeth bycause in hir soarage she was not cherished to make hir take delight in hir flight: for in a manner all the skill of a Falconer or Ostreger consisteth in coying and delicate vsage of his Hawke, and so cherishing hir, that she may take pride and pleasure in hir flight.
Therefore woulde not thinke it amisse if hee had always at the first entring of his Goshawke or Tercell, a traine Partridge in his bagge, to serue hir with, when neede dothe require, and so he shall winne hir loue.
And therewithall lette him marke these obseruations, to keepe his Hawke in good tewne alwayes.
First let him consider that naturally all Goshawkes are full of moyst humors, and especially in the head: and therfore let him plie them with tiring, and plumage, both morning and euening, for that will open them in the Head, and make them cast water therat.
Let the Goshawkes tiring be the rumpe of a beefe, or ye vppermost ioynt of a wing which we call the pinion, or a chickens legge, giuen by the fire or in the warme Sunne.
This will not only keepe your Hawke open in the head, but also keepeth hir in exercise and vse and fro~ slouthfulnesse, which might marre hir vtterly spoyle hir.
It is good also to giue hir euery nighte casting eyther of feathers or of cotton, and then in the morning to marke whether it be wrought round or not, whether it be sweete or not, whether it be moyste or drie, and of what colour the water is that droppes out of the casting, for thereby hee shall iudge in what case his Hawke is.
He shoulde also haue regarde to hir mewtes, to see whether they be cleane or not, and therevppon he may giue medecines accordingly, as shalbe hereafter declared.
For the infirmitie of a Hawke being once knowen, it is the more easily cured.
He hath also to consider the season: for in the winter and colde weather, he muste sette his Hawke or Tercell warme, in some place wher fire is made: he must rolle the pearch with cotton or some suche like thing, and the pearch must be set farre from the wall that his Hawke hurt not hir feathers when she bateth: but if it be not colde, he may set hir euery morning in some place where the Sunne hath power for an houre or two.
Remember that no Hennes or pultrie come neare yt place where your Hawke shall pearch, and especially in Lent when Hennes haue yong chickens commonly following them.
Remember also in the spring to offer your Hawke to the water euery weeke, for else she wil soare away whe~ she fleeth, and make you seeke hir.
If your Hawke bathe hir at any time of hir owne accorde after hir flight, go presently to the next house with hir, (if it be in Winter or cold weather) and weather hir by a fire with hir backe to the fire, and not hir gorge, for that woulde make hir sicke.
And likewise drie youre Hawke if you haue caried hir in the Rayne.
Let a good Falconer or Ostreger alwayes keepe his Hawke lustie and high, and yet keepe hir in suche tewne that she may flee best when she is high: for doubtlesse the plucking downe of a Hawke dothe marre hir and make hir cowardly.
Aboue all things an Ostreger must bee patient and neuer chollerique.
good Ostreger muste also keepe his Hawke cleane, and hir feathers whole, and if a feather be broken or brused, hee must ympe it presently, as shall be taught herafter also in this booke, and therefore he must haue his ymping needles, his Semond, and suche other things about him euermore in a readinesse. (&becaus) Certayne obseruations concerning Sparowhawkes.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of sparrowhawk] SEt youre Sparowhawke euery morning abroade in the Sunne two houres or neare there aboutes, and set hir in the water twice in a weeke at the least, and especially Nyasses, for they couet ye water more tha~ the rest.
Soare Sparowhawkes would not be flowen withall too soone in a morning, for they soare willingly.
Take your Sparowhawke from the pearch alwayes with somewhat in your hande, to make hir loue you and be fonde of you, for that is a thing of no small importance and co~sideration.
As also to make your Sparowhawke foote great fowles, to the end the may not learne nor be accustomed to carrein.
And as touching mewing of a Sparowhawke, some vse to put their Sparowhawke in the mew assoone as they leaue fleeing with hir, cutting off both hir bewettes, lines, and the knottes of hir Iesses, and leaue hir in the mewe vntill she be cleane mewed.
But if you will haue hir to flee at Partridge, Quayle, or Feasant poult, then you muste drawe hir in the beginning of Aprill, and beare hir on the fiste till she be cleane and throughly enseamed.
Some other keepe their Sparowhawkes on the pearch vntill March, and then throwe hir into the mewe being peppered for lyse if shee haue any.
Hir mewe should be a chamber aloft from the grounde eight or nine foote long, and fiue or sixe foote brode, with two windowes, to the East and the North, as is before declared in the description of the mewe for a Goshawke: and set hir perches and al other things euen as for a Goshawke, sauing that the mewe muste haue one little windowe to conuey in hir meate at.
And your Sparowhawke being thus prouided of hir mewe, go in to hir in Maye in an euening by candlelight, and taking hir softly, giue hir to thy companion to hold, vntill thou haue pulled out all hir traine feathers one after another, holding the principall feather with thy one hand (whiche Falconers do call the couert feather) and plucking out the other feathers with that other hande, for so shalt thou doe hir least hurt: and this shall make hir mewe the faster, if thou feede hir with hote meate and birds, and alwayes keepe an houre certayne to giue hir hir meate.
Some will set water in the mewe by their Sparowhawke continually, shifting and renewing the water euery second or third day.
Some set water before a Sparowhawke in the mewe but once in a fortnight, and then take it away againe within .xxiiij. houres after they haue set it there.
Some will neuer set water before their Sparowhawkes at all when they mewe them, saying that Sparowhawkes are very hote, and plucke out their owne feathers for extreame heate, and that therefore water is not to bee giuen or allowed them, bycause it killeth and delayeth the heate in them, which should further their mewing.
like that opinion: But for mine owne part and experience, woulde leaue the extremities and take the meane.
And woulde thinke it best to set water before a Sparowhawke in the mewe, once in xiiij. dayes at the least, or oftner, if ye Hawke seeme to haue neede, the which you shall easely perceyue, if she haue any feathers or downe that stand staring vp on hir backe, and when she sitteth alwayes as though shee woulde rowze, or is twitching at hir feathers with hir beake, then set hir water: but to set it by hir continually, dothe foreslowe hir mewing: and too keepe it alwayes from hir, doth make hir that she meweth not hir feathers so cleane or so gallantly, as when shee may haue water once in a fortnight.
As touching remedies for Hawkes that be slowe of mewing, it shall be set downe in the treatise of medicines in this booke also. (&becaus) The third part, or Booke, of this collection of Falconrie.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of man with falcon] BEfore deale with diseases of Hawkes, and cures due to the same, (which is the subiect of this third, and latter parte of my Collection of Falconrie) holde it very necessarye, and of importance, as well to the attaynement of the cause of each particular disease, as also the deuise of remedie for eache kinde of mischeefe, to speake somewhat of the complexions of Falcons, vnder whose name and nature (you knowe) in the beginning of this Booke of Falconrie, haue comprised all other Hawkes, in regarde that the Falcon is cheefe, and the Queene of all other Hawkes: nothing doubting at all, but that diuers will muze at the name and tearme of the complexion of a Hawke, as though indeede there were no such matter, ledde therevnto by their grosse conceyte and blinded imagination, for that they can not in their opinions iudge so easily of the natures of Hawkes, as they can of the complexions of men, whose clearenesse and thinnesse of skinne bewrayes their inclination and complexion, whereas Hawkes are not in any condition so to bee deemed and iudged, by meane of their plumes: whiche indeede is farre otherwise, for, as in man the natural complexion is truly discerned by the skinne, so is the naturall disposition and constitution of a Hawke by hir cote and plume: whiche aduenture not to reporte of my selfe, for that it striueth so much with common sense and ordinarie capacitie, but do follow mine Author, and thervpon am emboldned to auow it, not blushing to laye you downe hys speaches, as touching thys matter, though not in the Frenche Phrase, wherein he wrote it, but in the English ydiome, into which haue translated it.
Artelowch mine Author, writing of the complexions of Falcons, in his treatise of Falconrie, medicines, and cures, and such lyke matter, reporteth, and eke aduiseth That the blacke Falcons are melancholicke, and therefore should of right be phisicked with hote and moyst medicines, by meane of their complexion, which is cold and drie, as with Aloes, pepper, Cockes flesh, Pigeons, Sparowes, Gotes flesh, and such like.
That the blancke Falcons are flegmaticke, and to be Phisicked with hote and drie medicines, bycause of their flegme, whych is cold and moist, as with Cinamon, Cloues, Silermont, and Cardamomum, Gotes flesh, Choghs such like.
The russet Falcons be of sanguine cholericke complexio~, mixt indifferently, and therefore to be phisicked with cold medicines, moderately moyst, and drie: As with Myrtells, Cassia Fistula, Tamarinds, Vineger, Pullets, Lambs flesh, and suche like.
Hauing spoken thus much of the complexions of Hawkes, a matter not long to be stood vpon, will referre you ouer to the Italian Authors, as touching the diseases and cures, whose iudgements do very well allowe, in many pointes preferre beyond the French Falconers, for that they seeme to be the more reasonable men, and lesse giuen to friuolous inuentions.
Yet neuerthelesse in the last part hereof, you shall at your pleasure, peruse the French Falconers also, for that would haue you to want nothing that may be to your better knowledge and furtherance in Falconrie.
The opinion of master Francesco Sforzino Vicentino, an Italian Gentleman Falconer.
IT doth belong to a good and skilfull Falconer, not alone to knowe all kinds of Hawkes, and to haue the cunning how to reclayme, keepe slee, ympe, mewe the sayd Hawkes, with sundry other like matters incident and appertayning to Falconrie: but it is very necessary and behouefull for him to haue knowledge and good experience in their diseases and cures: for that they are birds subiect to sundrie maladies and accidents, the cure of all whiche dothe rest in the carefull keeper.
Wherefore hauing (vnlesse flatter my selfe) in the former parts of this collection, performed my promise, made in the very entry and beginning of this booke, as touching Hawkes, and other matters belonging to the misterie and skill of Falconrie: it is only left now, and rest charged, with their diseases and cures, to decipher vnto you the meane to know the maladies, as also a methode to recouer them: wherein if happelie any man desire a more ample discourse, of ye natures original causes of those diseases, tha~ herein shall bewray, let him know bethink himself yt am neither profound Philosopher nor learned phisitio~ by professio~, but yt in these deale as a Falconer, manifesting making shewe of cures proper peculiar to euery disease, wherwt cold euer yet find a Hauke charged, such as may light vpo~ any kind of Hawke, by misfortune casualtie.
And as touching remedies for their mischeefes, meane to speake of very few which haue not sundrie times approued wt very good successe, wherefore say, yt Hawkes may be diseased and vnperfect, eyther in body or feathers, which intend meane, whe~ they are vnable by any euil aceide~t to performe their parts and dueties in any co~dition, as not to be able to flee, or strayn ye pray wt their pownces, or any such like actio~, which by nature they ought to perform.
In body they are diseased, eyther by some outward cause, as by a stripe, or bruse: or else by some hidde~ inward euill, as by corrupt contagious humors, proceeding either of too gret heate moysture of ye head, or otherwise ouermuch drought siccitie of ye Liuer inward partes, fro~ which procedeth many times, the Pantas, shortnes of breath, other perilous euils, whereof meane to write in their peculiar places heereafter.
Again, Hawkes are accustomed to be ill affected diseased (as may tearme it) in their feathers, for yt diuers times being sound of body, in perfect state of health, yet they cannot flee or stirre their wings, by mean of some broke~ or sliued feathers, especially ye flagges, lo~g feathers, or sacels, which sundry times are broken eyther in ye quill, being bloudie feathers, or neare the top or poynt of the feather: the remedie for whiche mischiefe euill accide~t, will reserue to the last part of this treatise, as a matter meetest for yt place.
But bycause the mischiefes and diseases that grow within the bodies of Hawkes, may best be discerned knowe~ by their excrement, and by that which commeth fro~ them, as namely, by ye casting muet of a Hawke.
Therefore accompt it most expedient, to haue good iudgeme~t, to distinguish know the diuersitie and difference thereof, the better to come by the true knowledge of the diseases, wherby, ther may in good time be had a conuenient remedie for the euill.
How to knowe the health and disease of a Hawke by hir casting.
FAlconers do vse to giue two sorts of casting to their hauks, eyther plumage, or cotton bicause most co~mo~ly they giue ye Falco pellets of cotto~ for hir casting, wil first speak therof.
You must make choyce of fine, soft, white cotto, therof fashio~ frame your casting as big as a great nutte, at euening co~uey it into hir gorge, after you haue inpt hir: in ye morning betimes make dilige~t search to find it, to peruse it in what maner ye hauke hath rolled, cast it, bycause thereby you shal perceiue hir good or euill state: for if she cast it, round, white, not lothsome in smell, not very moyst or waterish, it is a manifest token yt she is sound.
But otherwise, if she rolle not hir casting wel, but cast it lo~g, not white, stincking, very moist slimie, it doth argue, yt she is full of diseases, as shal more specially declare vnto you eftsone.
You must obserue this, yt these castings do import betoke~ ye greater euil, by how much more they do resemble ye muet of a hauke in colour smel.
For by yt, they do make shew yt your hauke doth abound wt too much euil humor.
Wherfore you must ye more dilige~tly mark it, wring it betwixt your fingers, to see, how much, what kind of moisture doth drop fro~ ye casting, withall note the smell colour therof.
But now it is high time to procede to a more special declaratio~ of those castings, yt you may be {per}fect in each co~ditio~.
IF your hawkes casting be long, not wrought round, and be full of water, how much more long and moist it is, so muche more it betokeneth the hauke to be diseased.
And againe if so it be blacke, stincking, so much the more the hawke is in euill case state.
Al, and euery of these signes, do yeeld a shew and proofe, that the hauke hath bin fowle fed, with corrupt fleshe.
Wherefore, to remedie thys mischeefe, you muste feede hir with hote Birdes, as Swallowes, Sparrowes, yong Doues and suche like, giuing them aliue, or as soone as they are killed.
But if it so happen, for all this care and good intendaunce, that the casting continue at one selfe stay, and be like euill in shewe, then must you needes giue your Hawke a skowring, according to arte, such as will teach you to make hereafter.
If your Hawkes casting be greene, it is a signe that she is ill affected and diseased in the Liuer, the cure whereof wyll referre to a peculiar Chapter for the same euil.
But know neuerthelesse, that Hawkes, when they are ramage, diuers times doe cast suche like greene castings as speake of, and make suche muets, by reason of some wild foule that they haue killed, and prayed vpon at their own pleasure, or otherwise haue had the same giuen them by Falconers.
And a man neade not greatly force thereof, for that with good feeding, they will lightly be recouered, and ridde of this disease.
When the casting happeneth to bee yellowish blacke, and very moist and slimie, it argueth youre Hawke to bee stuft with euil humors, proceeding of too greate heate, or of immoderate and ouergreat flights, or too much bating.
For recouerie of which euill, you must as spedelie as you maye, bestowe good feeding vpon your Hawke, and coole hir, by washing hir meate in good freshe water, as endiue water, or suche like, as shall best please the fancie of the Falconer, allowing hir besides, one or two, or moe castings of cotton: into whiche you must conuey very excellent good Mummy beaten into pouder, and otherwhile among incense, vsed in like manner.
But if it so fal out, that your Hawke continue hir ill casting, for al this remedie it shall not be amisse, for twice or thrice to giue hir this kind of casting, or vpward scowring euery other day.
Take Aloes washt, beaten to powder, one scruple, powder of Cloues foure graynes, of Cubebes beaten to powder three graynes: all whiche beeing well confected, and made in mixture, enwrappe in a peece of cotton, and giue your Hauke being emptie and hauing no meate aboue or in hir pannell.
And nothing doubte, but vsing this order which prescribe you, your hawke shall recouer in short space.
In any case you muste be circumspect and heedefull, hauing a hawke thus diseased, to marke diligently whither she do mend or payre, whether she waxe hye, or abate hir fleshe.
For that according as she shall do any of these, it shall be necessary for you, eyther to augment or decrease your skowring, and hir feeding.
And beleeue me, knowe this by experience, that sundry hawkes do perishe more by being ouer poore and lowe brought, throughe negligence of ill keepers, that make slender regarde of them, tha~ by the extremitie of the disease.
This shall be sufficient as touching castings of Cotton, whiche (as sayde before) were peculiar to Falcons.
Falconers are accustomed to giue their hawkes casting of plumage, sometimes being emptie aboue, and eake in feeding to suffer the~ to take fethers, but specially to Sparowhawkes.
They giue them ioes of wings of small birdes, Quailes, when they haue fedde them, tearing them out with their teeth, and plucking away the longest feathers, and so giue it.
These castings, in the morning being wrought round, and caste without any ill sauour or slinke, do make euident shewe that the hawke is sounde: and howe muche more rounde and sweete they are, the better token of the hawkes good state.
But contrariwise, if the casting bee long, slimie, and rammish in smell, with some small partes of the fleshe vndisgested, cleauing to the same, and withall frothie, hauing a kinde of fome sticking on it, all these things togither, and euery one speciall by it selfe, do importe the disease of the hawke, and make full shew of hir ill state.
And therefore that she standeth nedeful of a good skowring, and good intendance, as sayde before.
The waye to knowe in what tune hawkes are, by their mewting.
WIth that helpe and lighte that haue alreadie gyuen you, by the hawkes casting, if you diligently obserue the mewte, you shall easily prognosticate and foresee hir euill, and any suche disease as your hawke is affected with.
For if the mewte be white, and not ouerthicke, nor ouercleare, and besides not hauing any blacke spotte in it, or at the leaste but little, it is an euidente proofe that the hawke is excellently in tune, and not diseased.
But if it be white, and very thicke in the middest, well it maye importe healthe, but it argueth the hawke to be ouergrosse, and too full of greace.
And therefore it shall be needefull to cure that mischiefe, by gyuing hir liquide and moyst meate, as the heart of a Calfe, Lambe, or such like.
And for one or twoo mornings, to allow hir (being empty and hauing nothing aboue to put ouer) a quantitie of suger Candie, which wil skowre hir, make hir slyse, or else a gutte of a chicken well washt, of a conuenient length size, full of good oyle Oliue, well clarified in water, in suche sorte as heereafter shall instruct you.
It is easily founde, when a hawke is ouergreasie, and not enseamed, by hir mewte, when it is white with some blacke in it, whiche euill is easily remooued, by gyuing hir hot Sparowes, and yong Pygeons.
But if hir mewte be white, entermedled with red, yellowe, grey, or such like colour, it is a signe that the hawke is very ill and diseased, and moreouer yt she standeth nedefull of a skowring, as of Mummy purified beaten to pouder, wrapping it in cotton, or some suche like matter, to set the gorge stomake of your hawke in tune agayne, and other inwarde partes, as hereafter shall make further shewe of in a place meete for yt speache and discourse.
Assuredly, when you see your hawkes mewte so full of diuers colours, it is very necessary for you to respect hir cure, and to endeuour your selfe to remedy that mischefe, or otherwise she muste nedes perishe vnder your hand, for that those are very deadely signes and proofes of the yll state of your hauke.
The white mewte, hauing a greater part of yellowe in it, than of any other coloure, doeth euidently make shewe, that the Hawke is surcharged with cholericke humoures, caused and engendred by flyghtes, when you flee with your hawke in the heate of the daye, as also of ouermuche bating.
Whiche euill you maye prouide for and eschewe, by gyuing your hawkes meate washt in cold waters, as Buglosse, Endyue, Bourage, and suche like holsome colde waters, very medicinable for that mischiefe, alwayes reme~bring to strayne the hawkes meate, and wring it in a lynnen cloth, after you haue washt it in the waters aforesayde.
And if this fall not oute in proofe to your contentmente, then if you can gyue your hawke a quantitie of Agaricke in a skowring, for the space of one morning or twoo, not suffring hir to flee, or do any thing, but do set hir downe.
There is no question, but by the care and diligence of suche a keeper, your hawke shall quickly recouer.
The mewte of a hawke, whiche is very blacke, declareth hir lyuer to bee infected, and is the moste deadely signe of all others.
For if it continewe three or foure dayes, moste assuredlie the hawke wyll pecke ouer the pearch, and dye.
But if it bee so but once, and no more, it greatly skylles not.
For then may it proceede of one of these two causes: eyther for that the hawke in pluming and tyring on the fowle, hath taken of the bloude or guttes of the praye, whiche is a matter of nothing: or else bycause shee hath bene gorged with filthye meate.
In this case, it behooues you to respect hir, and to allowe hir good warme fleshe, and a cotton casting, with Mummy, or the pouder of Cloues and Nutmegges, with a small quantitie of Ginger, to set hir stomack in tune agayne.
greene mewte is also a signe of an infected and corrupte lyuer, and happely of some Apostume, vnlesse shee make that kinde of mewte vppon this occasion, that shee hath bene gorged with some wylde and rammish meate, or hir selfe be a rammage hawke: for then this rule doeth not holde.
You must looke to this euyll as soone and with as great speede as you possible may, feeding hir with meate all powdered with Mummie prepared, if she will take it with hir flesh, as diuers hawkes will do of themselues: but if not, then must it be giuen hir in a casting, or some skowring, continuing it in this manner, sometimes after one fashion, sometimes after another, vntill you finde the mewte to be chaunged from the badde colour to the better.
But when this mischiefe doth procede, and continewe long space, then shall you bee fayne to bestowe on hir a skowring of Agaricke, to rydde those euill and noysome humors whiche do offende your hawke, and after that another skowring of Incense, beaten into pouder, to recomfort hir.
The mewte that is not perfectly digested, tending to redde, and that is full of small woormes, like vnto fleshe, not perfectly digested and endewed, gyues manifeste proofe, eyther that the hawke is not well in hir gorge, or else that she hath bene fedde with ill and corrupte meates, colde and stinking, and vnholsome for a hawke.
This euill may bee cured and helped, with good warme meates: and besides that, with skowrings of Woormeseede enwrapped and conueyed into Cotton, or Lynte.
And it shall not bee amisse to gyue hir a skowring of pouder of Cloues, Nutmegges, Ginger, whiche doth maruelously strengthen, and set the gorge in time.
The darke sanguine mewte, with a blacke in it, is the most deadely signe of all other, do not reme~ber that euer saw Hawke make that kind of mewte, but she died.
Yet neuerthelesse a man ought not therefore in that case to gyue ouer his hawke, and to dispaire of hir, but rather to allowe hir of that receyte and medicine, whiche earste Iherom Cornerus, that noble man, and cunning Falconer made, or else that whiche was deuised by Signor Manolus the Greeke, whiche haue manie times experime~ted in Falcons, not without good successe, and greate commendation.
And therefore hereafter will laye it downe for your better knowledge and practise, as the excelle~t deuises of moste skilfull men in Falconrie.
And yet for all this, it may be, that a hawke doth make the like mewte that wrote of, by meane of tyring on a fowle, and taking the bloude of it, and of the raynes guttes, which if do happen, it is a matter not to be regarded.
haue sundry times seene the mewte of a hawke greye, like mylke when it is turned and waxen sowre, whiche truly is a deadlie token, and signe of greate daunger.
Yet it shall not be amisse, to vse the receyte whiche lately spake of, deuised by those Gentlemen Falconers aforesayde.
By this whiche haue spoken, as touching the mewtes of hawkes, it maye bee gathered howe greately it doeth import, and howe behoouefull it is for a Falconer, or Ostreger, for the better cure of his hawkes, to peruse euery morning wt great care the mewte of his hawkes.
For that it doth greatly concerne the good health and state of them, to finde out at the firste their indisposition and diseases, before they be too deepely rooted and confirmed in them, when truely it wyll prooue a very harde and difficult matter to remoue the euill.
But nowe accompte it hygh time to proceede, and descende to the knowledge and particular cure of the ordinarie euills and diseases, whiche do plague and pester hawkes.
In whiche discourse, to obserue some methode and order, wyll speake generally of all infirmities and yll accidentes happening to the bodies of hawkes, as namely of the Feuer, and so consequently of euery speciall disease that belongeth to eache particular member of a hawke, as well those that are within the bodie, as withoute: And besides all these, of the gorge, guttes, and lyuer, of the stripes and bruses that happen to hawkes: and lastly of their feathers, and other euils.
Laying downe to your viewe in the latter parte heereof, suche instrumentes and tooles, as Falconer do vse to cauterize their hawkes withall, with suche other ordinarie remedies, as they do commonly bestow vpon their diseased and sicke Hawkes. (&becaus) Of the Feuer or Ague, wherewith Hawkes are wont be molested and troubled.
Haue noted and obserued, that the Feuer happeneth vnto Hawkes, by reason of some smal colde, and heate ensewing the same.
And verely in myne opinion, it doth much resemble the Tertian, wherewith we our selues are dayly vexed.
You may easily gesse this griefe, whe~ you see your hawke shake tremble, and presently after holde hir wings close vnder hir trayne, slouping downe with hir heade to groundewarde.
And besides all these tokens, you haue one more, which is, that your hawke will haue hir barbe feathers vnder hir beake staring, and out of order, and sometimes eake she hir meate.
And if happely you touche hir with your hande, you shall feele sensibly the extremitie of heate that doth surcharge hir.
All, or the moste part of these signes, do euidently argue your hawke to bee troubled with a Feuer, a very daungerous griefe, but not altogither deadely, for that haue seene many hawkes recured of this disease.
Wherfore all your care must bee, to coole and refreshe hir, bycause in deede the Feuer is nothing else but an inordinate heate.
In this case, hir feeding muste bee, either the legge of a chicken, or a yong Pygeon, or some other small fowle, but Sparrowes laste of all, for they are not to be allowed in the beginning of the disease, for their great heate.
And you must reme~ber to washe hir meate in the water of Buglosse, or Endiue, or in a mucillage of Psillin, in ye iuyce of Cowcumbers or Mellons, and afterwards drye it in a cloth, so giue it hir to feede on.
Moreouer you must (if you do wel) bathe the perche, also hir legges in the Sommer with Plantaine water, (or for want of ye water, with ye very iuyce of it) wt Lettice water, or Nightshade water, and sometimes among with the iuice of Henbane, Lettice water, Nenuphar, Howsleeke, suche other cooling deuises, to delaye hir inordinate heate inflamation, setting hir in some out place where the ayre is fresh, but not where she may take the ayre to much, for yt may breede a further inco~uenience.
If your sicke hawke be very lowe brought in state, you muste allowe hir a gorge twice a day, but with discretion iudgement, not giuing hir ouermuche at one tyme.
And if so the Feuer cease not by these practises aforesayde, it shalbe well done to giue your Falcon of excellent good Reubarbe, finely beaten to pouder, twoo scrouples, in a Cotton casting, to purge skowre hir choler, whiche is the very originall grounde of hir feuer.
There are some that do will and prescribe, yt you must let your Falco~ bloude in the thygh, whiche albeit haue not experimented, yet doth it sta~de with reason, that it may do good, if you can finely do it: but it were much better in mine opinio~, to open the vayne vnder hir right wing, bicause that would chiefely refrigerate coole the lyuer out of ha~d, so by a co~seque~t ye whole body throughout.
This order aforesaide is to be vsed, if ye feuer be a hotte feuer wherewith your hawke is molested.
But if it happen to bee a colde feuer, which you shall perceyue, by that your hawke will be extreme colde, if you touche hir. Hir eyes looke not of their woonted hewe, and besides all this, shee seldome mewteth, and that with greate payne.
Then you must set hir in some warm place, after hir fitte of colde is past, she must be gently borne on ye fist.
Besides, whe~ ye feuer hath left hir, for yt time you should let hir flee a little: it wil do hir great good.
Looke yt hir meate wherwith you feede hir, be hot fleshe, as Sparrowes, (which in this colde feuer are very wel to be allowed, though in ye hot agew told you they were hurtful) pullets, Pigeons, such like hot fowles, the flesh of whome you must washe in wine, wherein haue bin boyled these hot things folowing, as Sage, Pelamountaine, Cloues, Cynamo~, such other sweete co~fortable deuises.
Besides you may gyue your hawke the foresayde flesh, if it please you, with honie, and a little pouder of Dill, Fenel, Comin medled togither.
But specially you muste obserue this rule, remember it well, not to giue your hawke gorge vpo~ gorge: againe, if your hawke be hye in flesh when this disease taketh hir, she must be fed but little seldome, although in deede it be very good at all times, howsoeuer she be affected, to kepe a reasonable hande vppon hir, as touching hir dyet, whither she be diseased or in perfect state.
For of ouer greate gorges, and too full and liberall a hand, do procede a thousand mischiefes and diseases to a hawke, as experience doth dayly instruct vs, both to the greate paynes of those sillie birdes, and the greate griefe and coste of the vnskilfull keeper, whose purpose and meaning perhaps, is by giuing his hawke liberally, to haue hir flee lustily, and to continue in perfect healthe and state, whereas in trothe nothing doth so muche offende a hawke, as too greate a gorge.
As in all other things, so in this likewise, The meane is beste.
Some Falconers do prescribe this methode for cure of ye feuer in a hawke, whiche doe not greatly commende or allowe.
They will you to take Reubarbe, Muske, Suger candie, and the iuyce of Motherwoorte, and making a pylle of those things aforesayde, to gyue it your hawke, feeding hir afterwardes with Sparowes, or yong Rattes, whiche are very hotte meate.
Other some appoynte a paste or myxture to be made, as bygge as a nutte, of these things following, whiche being stieped a space in Vyneger, muste be gyuen hir, not dealing with hir in sixe houres after, at the leaste.
They take to the composition of this paste, Aloes, Muske, and the fatte of a Henne, egall portions, giuing it the hawke in manner aforesayde.
The signes that they gyue to knowe the Feuer, are the wrything of the hawkes trayne, the coldenesse of hir foote, and oftentymes the casting of hir gorge.
But the firste rules and remedies do satisfie mee sufficiently, without these, bycause finde in them some more reason: yet doe not thinke it amisse, to sette downe diuers mens opinions, bycause euery man maye make his choyce: for what liketh one, perhappes, contentes not another.
Of diseases of the heade, and first of the Apoplexye, or falling euill.
HAuing in purpose to treate of the diseases, wherewith hawkes those fillie birds are vexed in their heades, must do you to knowe, that vnder the name and terme of the heade, do not only comprise that part that contayneth the brayne, but also the eares, eyes, beake, or clappe, nares, and mouth of the hawke: all which partes are subiect to sundry diseases and euils.
But firste of all, meane to speake of the chiefest, and most principall part of all the rest, of such maladies as light vpon the brayne, and after that, of suche as happen to the externall and outward parts of the hawkes head.
Among all which infirmities griefes, account the Apoplexie (whome the Italians call Gozza the greatest and most perillous, as the which doth ordinarily cause and bring sodayne death.
This mischiefe doth commonly befall hawkes, by meane of too muche grease, and store of bloude, for that at that tyme there doth happely breake some one vayne or other in ye braine, which doth fill some co~cauitie or hollow Cell of the brayne wt bloude, in which Celles (as the learned do imagine affirme) the Animall spirites are inge~dred, and haue their beginning.
Without which Animall spirites, no lyuing creature can eyther haue sense or moouing.
Wherevpon it doth follow of very necessitie, and by a meere consequent, that the passage of those spirites beeing shutte vp, and intercluded, the creature, whatsoeuer it be, muste dye. Agayne, it may happen, for that the hawke hath bene sette too long in the heate of the Sunne, for by that occasion there may bee so muche humiditie and moyste humour drawen vp into the brayne, as may ingender this euill, and procure this mischiefe in the hawke.
Moreouer it may chaunce, by making a lo~g flight at a Fesant, or Partridge, in the heate of the daye, by meane of which the hawke hath surcharged hir selfe with ouermuche trauaile.
Wherefore it shall be behoouefull and necessarie, so to vse the matter with care and diligence, as it may be foreseene, that hawkes incurre not this aduenture and euill.
Wherevppon, for that hawkes in the mewe, are accustomed to gather muche grease, it shall be good, for the space of fifteene or twenty daies before the drawing of them out of the mewe, to feede them with lyquide and slypper fleshe, such as may lyghtly be put ouer, and passe through them.
As namely, with the heartes of Calues, Lambes, or Goates, washed in luke warme water, and afterwarde dryed in a lynnen clothe, before you gyue it your hawke.
Lykewise may you boldly feede your hawkes before they are drawen out of the mewe, with small pullettes, and yong Sparrowes.
When you haue thus doone, and obserued this order of feeding them, when the tyme is come to drawe them out of the mewe, you muste remember to drawe them very orderly, and after that to continewe the same kinde of feeding, and to keepe the same hande vppon them, for other twentie dayes space at the leaste, to skowre and disburden your hawkes of that slyme and glytte, whiche doth surcharge them, hauing them alwayes for the moste parte on the fiste, and especially at nyghte.
Neyther shall it be euyll to skowre them, (or as our Ostregers and Falconers do terme it) to enseame them, by gyuing them a quantitie of washt Aloes, allowing a Falcon as muche as the byggenesse of a Beane, beaten into powder, wrapped in Cotton, and so to make hir a skowring thereof, and besides to giue hir Suger Candy, twoo or three mornings.
But in any condition you muste beware not to vse Aloes vnwashte, bycause thereof are bredde sundry ill accidentes in hawkes.
And for that occasion is it prescribed you, to vse Aloes washe, to auoyde that vndoubted euill, whiche would otherwise happen.
Moreouer, haue happily, and with good successe approoued this remedie.
haue gyuen so muche larder, or butter, as coulde well conuey into my hawkes throte, when shee hath beene emptie aboue, hauing firste prepared the larde or butter, by washing it seuen, eyght, or moe tymes in cleare water, and afterwardes letting it soke in Rose water a space, and lastely by putting vnto it of the beste Suger that coulde gette, or Suger Candie beaten to pouder.
And my order was, euer to gyue this skowring euery seuenth or eyght daye.
And this is not alone to bee vsed to hawkes in the mewe, but also to suche as are kept on the pearche and stocke.
But if it so fall out, that by these deuises and skowrings you cannot make your hawke haue a stomake and gredie appetite to feede, it shall not bee euill to pysse vppon hir meate, and hauing dryed it in part againe, to giue hir a gorge sufficient, so muche as may serue hir, and as she will take.
For the more liquide and slypper fleshe you giue hir, the sooner wil she be enseymed.
And by this meanes doe Falconers preserue their hawkes from the falling euill, and sodayne mischiefe, and besides that from sundry other perilous accidents, that do followe those sillie birdes.
FAlcons, Goshawkes, and other birdes of praye, are woont to be muche combred and molested with the swelling of the heade, and the Apostume thereof, a very greuous euill, occasioned by abundance of euill humors, the heate of ye head.
It is discerned by ye swelling of ye hawkes eyes, by the moysture whiche sundrie tymes issueth, and distilleth from the eares, and often eake by euyll sauoure, and smell of the Apostume.
Also it may bee perceyued by the small desire the hawke hath to mooue or aduaunce hir selfe by the wresting of hir heade, and the little regarde shee hath to tyre and pull the fleshe that shee feedeth on, as thoughe in deede tyring were verie paynefull to hir, and by that shee is scarce able to open hir clappe, and beaten after hir accustomed manner.
Agaynst this moste perilous euill, it shalbe very necessarie firste of all to skowre your hawke throughly, and after that the heade in chiefe.
As touching the generall skowring, can commend and allowe you to gyue hir three or foure mornings, when shee hath no meate to put ouer, a pyll as bygge as a nut of Butter washt seuen or eyght tymes in freshe water, and steeped well in Rose water, myngling it afterwarde with Hoonie of Roses, very good suger, holding your hawke on the fiste, tyll she make one or twoo mewtes.
Which being done, to disburde~ and skowre the head, it shall be excellent well done to take of Rewe seede foure drammes, Aloes Epaticke twoo drammes, Saffron one scruple, reducing and forcing all these to fine powder, and with a quantitie co~uenient of honie of Roses, to make a pyll of that bygnesse and syze, as may well be co~ueyed into the hawkes beake, by whiche hir brayne maye bee purged and skowred, thrusting the pyll so deepe into hir throte, as you may well see, holding hir a space after it vppon the fiste.
And that done, setting hir downe on the pearche, in a conueniente place, for a time, and twoo houres after, to feede hir at hir accustomed time with good hotte meate.
But if happely there be any of the corruption and filthe in the hawkes eare, it shall be very necessarie, carefully with an instrument of siluer, or other good mettall for the nones, that the one ende bee sharpe poynted and edged, of purpose to apply lynte, and on the other ende hollowe, and fashioned like vnto the eare of a hawke, to clenze and remooue the filth that furreth the hawkes eare.
And with that ende, whereon the lynte or bombaste is, to skowre it very dayntity, and presently vppon the same, to infuse and droppe in a quantitie of Oyle of sweete Almondes, freshe and luke warme, and after the same to conuey into the eare a little lynt or bombast, to keepe in the Oyle, till suche time shee be dressed agayne, to the ende the Oyle may supple and mollifie the filthe, so as it may easily bee remooued, and clenzed.
And this order muste you obserue and continue, vntil the Apostume be resolued and throughly rype.
But if it so fall out, that the Apostume wyll not come to maturation, or rype, in sorte as it may growe to suppuration, and be mundified in manner aforesayde, but will reste at one staye in the heade of the hawke: then muste you be fayne to come to cauterize the heade aloft, and bestowe a button there, to cause the humor to breathe, and to bring the corrupte matter thyther, remembring after this fyer and cauterie to remooue the escare, by bestowing on it for the space of eyght or nyne dayes, butter, by whiche you shall easily remoue the cruste or escare, whiche is made by the fier.
You must not forget, if it be so as your hawke be so weake, as she is vnable, or so frowarde, as she will not feede and tyre vppon hir meate whiche you gyue hir, then to cutte it in small pellettes, and so giue it hir, eyther by fayre meanes or fowle, not leauing to vse it so, if it bee possible, as she may receyue it willingly, and feede hir selfe, bicause it may the better nourishe hir.
For this is one vndoubted rule, that when a hawke doth refuse to feede and tyre, she is very vnlusty, and diseased, and not one among a hundreth of them, that doeth recouer.
And for mine owne parte, in all my time, haue recouered but one Falcon beeing so diseased, and that by the meane and cure aforesayde, and by vsing the cauterie.
Lette this suffise, as touching this monstrous accident, for meane to referre you to another place for the cauterie and fire, whiche you shall vse to hawkes, where will speake specially therof.
Onely gyuing you this caueat before you go, that this euill of the heade, is infectious, and will passe from one hawke to another, as the maungie doeth among Spanels, or any suche contagious disease.
Wherefore it shall bee very good to sequester and sunder the hawke that is thus affected, from your other hawkes, for auoyding of the same euyll.
Of the distillation and swelling of a hawkes heade, and also of hir eyes and nares.
HAwkes are accustomed to haue a certayne distillation or Catarre in their heades, bicause, when they are harde fleen withal, set in greate heates, by long paynefull flyghts, they easily take colde vppon the same, either through some vnhappy stormes of weather, or great windes, or by reason of the extreme cold of winter, and chiefely when they are full of grosse and naughty humors.
Of this Catarre or distillation, sundry times there growe a thousande mischiefes to those poore birdes, and specially the swelling of the heade, with a kinde of dropping humor, which is the cause many times, that the hawkes eyes becomme lesse, and are contracted in a manner togither.
Beside whiche inconuenience, the nares also becomme to be stufte and stopped with excessiue excrement, that descendeth from the brayne.
All whiche euill accidentes do require, and stande needefull of seuerall cures, before they can be remoued, and the hawkes inioy their accustomed health.
Wherefore firste of all, it shall bee necessarie to skowre your hawke, beeing thus affected and diseased, with butter prepared in manner aforesayde, or with Oyle Olyue, prepared after that fashion, as shall instruct you in the chapter of the Pantas.
haue, in the Catarre of Falcons, (as also of other hawkes,) diuers tymes vsed with greate good fortune and successe, to gyue them of Agaricke twoo scruples, of Cynamon finely beaten, of the iuyce of Lyquerisse, of eyther one scruple, beeing made also into powder, and with a quantitie of Honie of Roses, to make all those things aforesayde into a pyll, as bygge as a Beane, for the largest sorte of hawke, and for other lesse hawkes, halfe as bygge.
And this was accustomed to gyue my Falcon, and other hawkes in the morning, hauing nothing aboue in their gorges, holding my hawke on the fiste, vntill suche tyme the medicine beganne to woorke, bycause shee shoulde not caste the skowring, (whiche then would do hir no pleasure at all) and after three houres, then to feede hir with some good meate.
You muste remember, and note this very well, that if your hawke to whome you giue this skowring, be greasie, and ful of flesh, you may boldely gyue it hir twoo or three mornings.
But if shee be poore, and lowe, then once or twice to allowe this skowring will very well suffise hir.
For there is euer respect to be had of the state of a hawke, when any vpwarde or downewarde skowring is gyuen them, for otherwise it wil do them greater mischiefe, than pleasure.
But when you perceiue your hawkes head to swell, and hir eyes to be full of dropping humors, and to waxe lesse than naturally they were accustomed to be, by meane of the swelling of hir heade: It shall be good, hauing gyuen hir this generall skowring, that haue spoken of, to skowre the head alone, and purge it with some deuise, to force hir snyte and snuffe, as me~ do accustome to sneze: to force hir therevnto, you may take Pepper, Cloues, and Mustard seede, of eache one a like quantitie, making them all into very fine pouder, as is possible, and then with a whistle of siluer, or other like mettal, (yea though it be but a quill, it will serue the turne) beeing applyed vppon hir nares, to blowe it into hir nares as strongly as you may, to make it pierce further in.
And besides that, you may rubbe and frotte the pallate of your Hawke with the sayde powder, and not feede hir after it, vntill suche tyme she haue lefte snyting and snuffing.
If you continewe this practise three or foure dayes, your Hawke shall recouer assuredlie.
To discharge the heade of a hawke, that is stuft with yll humor, Senauza, which the Apothecaries do sellin the winter, haue founde a very excellente thing, and of greate force, gyuing of it the byggenesse of a Beane vnto my hawke, beeing emptie, hauing nothing aboue.
And withall was accustomed to rubbe the pallate of hir mouthe, forcyng also some parte of the powder to ascende vp into the heade, by the hole that goeth to the brayne: and after had so doone, woulde caste my hawke to the pearche, vnhooding hir.
Which was no sooner doone, but you shoulde see hir caste a worlde of slymie filthe and moyste humoure, and snyse at hir nares as faste.
But if it be so, that the abundance of humors in the heade, by none of these aforsayde remedies will be remoued, applying them neuer so often, nor ye mischiefe cease to vexe your hawke whiche you shall easily discerne by hir slymie castings, and the abundaunce of filthe that will issewe at hir nares: then must you of force be dryuen ve~trously to flee to the actuall cauterie, with an yron button heate in the fier, to cauterize hir vpon the heade, vsing no lesse iudgemente and discretion therein, than the dayntinesse of the place requires, regarding the bone of the hawkes heade, whiche is not very strong, or harde.
And before you do vse the cauterie, it is necessarie to cutte away those feathers, that are growing about the place where you meane to bestow your fier.
If with this monstrous moystnesse of your hawkes heade, there be ioyned a swelling, or the dropping of hir eyes: in that case do thinke it best, to bestow your button vpon hir head, iuste betwixte hir eyes, obseruing the same order that haue alreadie prescribed you.
When the nares of your hawke are stufte with filthe, and surcharged with suche distillation from the heade, as haue spoken of: after a conuenient skowring, then shall it be good to take Pepper and Mustarde seede beaten into fine powder, and putting it in a cleane lynnen clothe, to stype it a space in the strongest Vyneger you can gette: and that done, to bestowe some fewe droppes thereof vppon hir nares, so as they may enter and pierce hir nares.
For truely this deuise will so scowre and drie vp the humor, as it will doe great pleasure.
But if so with these remedies and meanes you cannot resolue it, then must you be fayne to vse the cauterie, not aloft vpon the head, but round about the nares, giuing hir a little touch with the fire, somewhat belowe the nares, to make them more large, alwayes vsing the matter so carefully, as you touch not the roote or (poret) of hir nares.
When you haue in this maner bestowed your fire, and actuall cauterie, vntill such time the payne do ceasse, and the escarre fall away, (whiche is nothing else but the crust that is growen there, by meane of the fire,) you must anoynt the place with fresh butter, and after that you haue so done, then proceede to the cure of it with the powder of Masticke, or Olibanum.
This is a very good remedie for the swelling in the head of a Hawke.
Take Stauesacre, a quantitie of Pepper, and a little Aloes Epaticke, beate these sayd thinges into fine powder, and put them into the water of Rew, where when it hath bin steeped a space in the said licoure, with a little bombast or lint, bath your Hawkes nares twice a day, and you shall finde it ease your Hawke greatly, and ridde a greate parte of the filthie matter that breadeth the stoppage in hir head.
If all these remedies which haue alleaged generally, nor any one speciall medicine will preuayle, as sayde before: then muste you repose your chiefe trust in the cauterie, which must be done either on the head with a cauterizing button, or about the nares with a nedle, or sharpe yron, fyre hotte, or some golden or siluer instrument, of purpose made, applying after the fire, for the remouing of the Escare, and the cure of the same, the remedies aforesaid.
THere doth diuers times happen vnto Falcons, and other Hawkes, a mischeefe, whose nature is, to cause the Hawke to shake hir head continually, so as at no time she can hold it still or steadie, but is euer mouing it to one side or other, holding hir eyes close shut withall.
This disease is called Soda, which in english we may tearme ye Megrim or a kind of Palsie, by meane the head is in continuall mouing.
This euill may proceede, eyther by the fowlenesse of the panell, or of a corrupt and naughtie liuer.
The remedie for it is this, whichu hae found very good, and wherewith haue cured my hawke in times past.
You must giue your sick hauke a casting of cotton, in whiche you shall enwrappe of Aloes Epaticke one scruple, of Cloues two graynes, making these into powder, before you giue it: then two houres after the taking of this skowring, feede your Hawke with a yong Pigeon, or a hote Pullets legge, vsing this selfe same order three or foure mornings one after another.
Take as much vnwasht Larde as the toppe of youre little finger, with a quantitie of Peper, and a little Aloes Epaticke, beate these two last into powder, and conuey them into the Larde, whiche done, thrust them into your haukes throte, holding hir on your fiste a space after it: then tie hir on the pearch in the sunne, and ther let hir stay til she cast both the skowring, and the slimie matter which is in hir gorge.
And this medicine may you vse euery thirde day once, feeding your Hawke with hote meates, as Pigeo~s, and yong Sparowes, euery time you giue hir this skowring, conuey into hir a little Aloes, which is an excellent thing to skowre hir, and quitte hir of this disease.
If these receytes and skowrings yeelde no remedie, then must you to the actual cauterie, shearing away the plumes about that part of the head where you will applie youre fire, euer respecting the bone, and burning nothing but the very skinne, to let the mischiefe breath, remouing the escare, and do+ing the cure after the escare remoued, as is before said.
Let this suffice for this monstrous mischiefe, whiche killes many Hawkes: yet haue cured my Hawkes twice, by these remedies in my time.
BEsides those other euils, ther is a Cataract which doth light vpon the eyes of a Hawke, whome we may tearme a suffusion, a mischiefe not easely remoued, and diuers times impossible to be recured, as namely whe~ it is growen too thicke, and ouerlong hath bin suffered in the eye, without seeking remedie for it: but if it be not confirmed, then may it well be remedied, and my selfe haue cured sundrie Hawkes affected with this euill.
This euill accident dothe happen, by meane of grosse humors in the head, whiche are wont to dimme and darken the sight, and sometimes cleane to put out the Hawkes eye without redemption.
It maye bee, that the hood is the cause and grounde of this disease, for neuer in my life remember that sawe any other byrd or fowle troubled with it but only the Falcon: and perhaps, it lights on hir, in chiefe, for that of all other, shee is moste vsed to the hoode, and to be almost at no tyme vnhooded.
You must therefore haue an eye, and especiall regarde to this inconuenience, at ye first, by giuing one or two mornings a skowring of Aloes, or of Agaricke, to skowre your Hawke withall, bycause if you shoulde aduenture vppon any sharpe or hard painefull medicine, applying it to the eye of youre Hawke, it woulde perhaps cause a greate repaire of euill humors and accidents to the place diseased.
When you haue giuen thys skowring of Aloes, or Agaricke, to remoue the matter from the eye, you must vse a powder made of washt Aloes, finely beaten, one scruple, and of Suger candye two scruples, blowing of this powder into your Hawkes eyes three or foure times in a daye, with the Pipe or quill aforesayd.
Thys is the gentlest, and moste soueraine medicine that you can applie to the eye in thys case.
and whilest you do minister this receyte, it shall be good sometimes to bath the eye with the vrine of a little boy.
If by these medicines aforesayd, the webbe of the eye wyll not be remoued, we must be driuen to vse a stronger receyte, which is this.
Take a newe layde egge, and rost him so long vntill the white of him become like milke.
When you haue so done, put it into a fine white linnen cloth, and strayne it so much and so long, vntill you see issue through your strayner a cleare greene water, wherof you shall now and then infuse a droppe or two into the hurt eye, vsing it so three or foure times in the day at the least, vntill you see your Hawke amend of hir mischeefe, and waxe sound.
Last of all, if these things auayle not to the cure, do commend and allow aboue all the rest, that you take the iuyce of Celendyne rootes, making them cleane from the earthe that doth vse to hang to the moores: then scrape away the outmost rynde and pill of the roote, and vse the iuyce to your Hawke.
Truly haue found this to be of singular force and vertue in the like accident.
It shall not be amisse, in this and suche like affections and ill passions of the eye of a Hawke, to bath hir eyes often with rose water, wherin haue bene boyled the seads of Fenygreke.
But you must remember, that this water or colirie, be somewhat warme when you vse it, bycause the eye is so noble, and so sensible a member, as it can ill brooke things eyther ouerhote or ouercolde, but muste haue them moderately hotte or cold.
This deuise may you vse to bath your hawkes eye withall, vntill such time she be recouered, feeding hir meane while with good meates, and such as are light of digestion.
Hawkes are of so noble and excellent a nature, as the most part of medicines that you doe applie to the hurtes and cures of men, you may boldly bestowe on Hawkes, as things very holesome for them, as by their working will be most euidently seene and perceyued: yet muste there be a discretion vsed, in the administration of these sayd receytes, hauing alwayes a regard vnto the weake and delicate nature of Hawkes, in respect of men: and therefore ye quantities of euery thing must be allowed and giuen accordingly.
It happeneth diuers times, that through the Catarre, and paine of the head and eyes, there lights vppon the eares of a Hawke so mortall and deadly an apostume, as seldome when, though there bee greate care vsed about the cure, she maye be brought to perfect state, or recouered.
And this proceedeth, bycause the mischiefe lies so neare a neighboure to the brayne, as before it can breake or be clensed outwardly, it causeth the Hawke to perish.
Besides that, it is very hard to applie medicines in that place: but if the Hawke be of so strong a nature, that she brooke the breathing and rupture of this disease, which you shall perceyue by the quitture and filth that dothe issue from hir cares, giue hir this remedie, which is a very noble receyte, and approued of me often times, as well in men, as in Hawkes, to my great commendation and glory.
Take honie of Roses, and oyle of egges, incorporate them togither, and powre twice or thrice a daye into the eares of your Hawke, some fewe droppes of it hote: and if you find by the abundance of filth, that there needeth great abstersion, you maye adde therevnto a quantitie of Sarcacoll beaten into powder.
The wine of Pomegranats is a most excellent remedie in this mischiefe, confected with those things aforesayd.
Butter well coyled and beaten in a morter of lead, one houre at the least, and afterwardes powred into the Hawkes eares reasonable hote, twice or thrice aday, is a very good remedie.
Of such euils as happen to Hawkes in their chappes and mouthes.
THe chappes, and mouth of a Hawke is subiect to sundrie diseases, and in ye Hawkes mouth, there are wont to growe certayne white peeces of flesh, and sometimes tending somewhat too blacke, which do hinder the Hawke from hir feeding, by meane whereof without any other euident cause, she beco~meth leane, and lowe.
Wherfore it shall bee very necessary to looke into hir mouth sometimes, both in the Palat, and vnder the tong, bicause that many times, there especially, do growe vp certaine peeces of flesh like in shape to a graine of Peper, sometimes lesse, sometimes bigger than a Peper grayn, which it shall be necessary to cut away, either with a payre of cysers, if you may commodiously do it, or with Roch Alome burnt, or with a droppe of Oyle of Brimston, applyed vpon a little cotton, with an yron vnto the place, taking away the corrupte flesh.
You must mundifie the place with honie of Roses, and bombast or lynt, vntill you see the quicke flesh vnderneath it, then afterwards, vnto the honie of Roses, you may apply and adde, a little powder of Masticke, or incense to consolidate the wounde, washing it sometymes among with white wyne.
Moreouer, and besides this, there is wont to happen vnto Hawkes in the mouth, a certaine frownce or impedimente, which doth hinder their feading, as the other peeces of flesh do, of which haue spoken before.
This frownce may be very well perceyued and discerned with the eye, and will appeare also, by the feeding of the Hawke.
Diuers times this kind of euill is cured with honie of Roses, and with the powder of nutshels, bound in a peece of linnen cloth, well bathed and styped togyther, and thrust vnder the whote ymbers, vntill it may bee brought vnto fine powder: thys may you continue twice a day, as long as shall bee needefull.
But if this will not serue the turne, it shall be very necessary to mortifie and kill the frownce with Aquae fortis, such as goldsmiths do vse to part their mettalls withal, hauing respect not to touch it any where, sauing only vpon the frownce, and part diseased, for that it will fret the good and sound fleashe.
After you haue mortified the frownce or canker with Aquae fortis, as haue tolde you, then must you mundifie and consolidate it with honie of Roses, which wyll cure it out of hand.
Also it is very good, to applie this receyte following in the cure of the frownce, whome the Italians call Zaruoli.
Take a cleane Skillet, wherevnto put good white wine, a quantitie of Verdigrece, well beaten to powder, of Roche Alome like quantitie, one ownce of honie, and a fewe drie Rose leaues, boyle all these thyngs togither to the consumption of halfe the wine: then strayne it, and with the strayning hereof, twice or thrice a day, bath the frownce with a little lint or bombast, tyed on the toppe of an instrumente for the purpose.
But you muste well regarde whether the fleshe be good or no, and with a toole fitte for it to searche and cutte away the dead fleshe, for otherwise it will doe little pleasure, and the Hawke shoulde bee assured to suffer greate paynes, and yet to dye at laste.
Hauing mundifyed the wounde with the receyte aforesayde, bathe it onelye wyth Honie of Roses, and it wyll dispatche the Cure.
Take Verdegrece a quantitie, bynde it in a linnen clothe, stype it one day and one nighte in Rose water, or Plantine water, or common water, not hauing the rest, and afterwardes wash the frownce therewith, vntill they be mortified, whyche you shall well perceyue by the quicke fleshe that will growe vnder: then applye Honye of Roses in the ende of the cure, and it shall doe your Hawke great good.
Egiptiacum is an excellent thing to cure kill the frownce in a Hawke, which is none other thing, but a very Canker, suche as men are plagued withall.
Wherefore, take Verdegrece, Roch Alome, of eyther two ownces, Honie of Roses one ownce, water of Plantaine, wine of Pomegranats, of eyther two ownces, and a halfe, set them on a softe burning fire, alwayes stirring them with a sticke, or wodden splatter, vntill it turne to the thicknesse of honie: then take a little of it, and mingle with a qua~titie of Plantaine water, and you shal find this the most excellent remedie, aswell for the frownce in a Hawke, as also for the Canker in the mouth of a man.
Thus much is necessary to be vsed, when the frounce dothe happen vnto a Hauke by some apostheme of ye head, enge~dred by a corrupt liuer, or some other inward part.
But many times it so falleth out, that the beake of a Hawke is hindred and offended with this kind of euil, and not the mouth so much: in such sort, as the Hawke cannot well feede, by meane this mischiefe doth so fret and eate the horne of hir chappe and beake.
For remedie of that, you must take a sharp knife, and pare away, as muche of the beake as is corrupted: but if the maladie or frownce haue eaten very farre vnder the horne of the beake, it is not sufficient to cut it away with a sharpe knife, as farre as the canker hath eaten, but you must afterwardes anoynt the place with honie of Roses, twice or thrice: and in so doing the Hawke shall recouer and do well, for the honie of Roses will both mundifie and incarne.
Sometimes a Hawkes beake or clappe doth ouergrowe so much, as it is very necessary to cope it with an yron, and afterward to sharpen the beake with a knife, taking away so much as is needeful for the better feeding of your Hawke, but in any wise you muste not medle with the nether clappe, bycause that doth not commonly growe so fast, nor so farre as to hinder your Hawkes feeding.
Let this suffice as touching ye diseases of ye Hawkes mouth, and the frownce, bycause ther is no canker or frownce so ill, but being taken in time, with these receites, it will be recured assuredly.
ONe speciall disease among others that be lurking and secret within the brest and couert parts of a Hawke, is the Pantas, a very daungerous euill, and familiar to Hawkes: for lightly fewe escape, that are once encombred wyth thys infirmitie.
This mischeefe proceedes, when the lungs and those breathing members by excessiue heate are ouerdried, and baked, in such sort, as they cannot by any meanes freely drawe the ayre to them, nor yet vtter it well being once receyued, for the better cooling of the hart, whose bellowes the lungs are, by nature ordayned for that speciall purpose and office, wherby the hart wareth inflamed, and by a necessarye consequente, the Hawke of force must perish.
Beside that, the humiditie and moysture of the head distilling from aboue, vpon those breathing partes, and there encreased, and waxen thicke, is wont also to be a great furtheraunce to thys mischiefe, and breede difficultie of breathing.
Wherefore it shall be very necessary, to regard it at the firste, before the disease haue taken too deepe roote: for that then (for any thing know) there is no remedie in the worlde to be had for this Pantas, which is commonly tearmed Asina.
You maye iudge of the beginning of this greefe, and know it by thys.
Your Hawke laboreth muche in the panell, mouing hir trayne often vp and downe, at each motion of hir panell, and cannot many times mewte or slise: and when shee doth slise, she droppes fast by hir, and makes a small rounde burnt mewte: these are apparant proofes, that shee hathe the Pantas growing on hir. Againe, you may perceyue it by the more violent motion of hir gorge than custome was, but the other are the most assured signes that you can desire and infallible.
Moreouer, when your Hawke doth often times open and close hir clappes and beake, then is the disease very neare confirmed.
And looke how muche the more shee dothe it, the more is the Pantas rooted on hir, and then is the cure desperate, and not to be hoped for.
The best remedie that euer coulde fynde for the Pantas, was to scowre the Hawke with good oyle oliue, well washed in sundrye waters, so long, vntill it became cleare and white.
My accustomed maner of washing it was, to put it in an potte, that had a little hole in the very bottom of it of purpose made rounde, whereby it mighte the better bee stopte with the toppe of my finger: then do conuey into this potte that quantitie of Oyle, whiche meane to washe in it, and with cleare water do there coyle it togither with a wodden splatter, or a spone, that the water waxeth somewhat darke with it: after whiche remouing my finger, the water passeth away by the hole, the Oyle remayning behinde, and swimming aloft, as it is the nature of it to do.
And thus do sixe, seauen, or eyght times, so long, vntill perceyue the Oyle to haue no filthe lefte in it at all.
Then of this Oyle thus prepared, bestowe vppon my Hawke that hathe the Pantas, filling therewith a chickens gutte washt very cleane, of an ynche long and somewhat more for a Falcon and Goshawke: but for other lesse Hawkes, of a lesse length, fast knit at bothe endes with a thread, to the ende the Oyle maye not issue out, whiche gutte conuey into the Hawkes throte, after she hath cast, and is emptie aboue and in the pannell bothe, holding hir on the fiste till shee make a mewte: and one houre after she hath left mewting, then feede hir with some slipper fleshe, as the harte of a Calfe, or a Pullets legge, refusing to vse olde Pigeons and Sparowes, bycause they are ouer hote meate, vnlesse happely the Hawke were very lowe and poore, but being hie and full of flesh, those other meates aforesayde, are not alone holesome, and sufficient for hir, but they will be much better, being washt in water of Buglosse, and wroong drie in a linnen cloth, and then minged with the powder of Suger candie, vsing this order sixe or eyght dayes or moe, euery other day till my Hawke recouer: giuing hir euery third or fourth daye, a cotton casting with Cubebes and Cloues, to scowre and discharge hir of such moyst humors as destilleth from hir head, whiche sometimes (as haue sayde before) is the chiefe and originall ground of this disease.
Besides this remedie, there is one other very good, and that is butter, and Larde, well slised, and washed in sundrie waters, till they become very cleane, and whyte, whyche you maye keepe in Rose water, vntill you haue occasion to vse it.
Of these beeing thus prepared and conserued, you maye take as you haue nede, for euery skowring suche a quantitie, as will serue to make a pill or pellet, so greate as you maye well conuey into your Hawkes throte, vsing it in maner and time aforesayd: giuing hir now and then among that skowring of Cubebes and Cloues, as well for the reason alreadie alleaged, as also bycause of hir liquide meate and slipper feeding vppon those harts, so bathed and stieped in water.
For Cubebes and Cloues will greatly comfort the stomacke and gorge of your Hawke.
haue found by experience that Oyle of sweete Almonds is of wonderous efficacie in the cure of this disease, giuing it in a chickens gutte as aforesayd.
If these remedies which haue shewed, doe not preuayle, nor performe the perfit cure of your diseased hawke, ne yet doe make hir mewte, which happened at no time to me in all my experience and practise.
But when there is no remedie to bee had at all, can well allow the vse of Agaricke with a cotton casting, bycause Agaricke is of great force to cause a Hawke to slise But if for al this, the griefe do dayly proceede and increace, then do thinke good that you bestowe a Cauterie vpon youre Hawkes heade, betwixt hir eyes, eake at hir nares, specially if there be any imperfectio~ in the~.
Some me~ are of opinion, yt for ye cure of the Pantas you shulde giue your hauke two inches of a Lucerts tayle, newly cut off, conueying it into youre Hawkes gorge, and afterwardes setting hir in some darke place, till the haue cast, and then to giue hir gotes milke, with the bloud of a Doue.
Othersome writers do will and aduise to let the Hawke bloud in the necke.
But for my parte, haue neyther tried the one, nor the other, if shall tell you the trouth of the matter, bycause doe not at all like of these deuises: but doe assure you, that with those other remedies and receytes, whiche haue taught you in this Chapter of the Pantas, (I meane, the skowrings, and the cawterie,) haue done very muche good, and recouered my Hawkes of this disease, and therefore do recommend you to them, as vndoubted experiments.
Betony reduced into the forme of an Electuarie with honie, is a very good remedie for this greefe, as well in men, as in Hawkes.
One other remedie which find in an Italian Author, is this.
Take Mummy, Rhewbarbe, Saffron, Suger candye, make all these into powder, giuing it to your Hawke, for the space of eight days at least in a chickins skinne, if shee will take it, if not, force it into hir.
And while you minister thys medicine vnto hir, al that time let hir not be borne on the fiste: and withall among sometimes, giue washt fresh butter with suger candye, and sometimes a cotton casting with incense within it.
But do more commend, to giue hir bole Armoniacke, in a pill with honie.
These remedies no doubt, are very good and soueraigne against the Pantas of a Hawke.
Make you choyse of them, but let the Cawterie be the last refuge, for that is an extremitie.
Remember this rule of Phisicke, that euer it is best to begin wt the weakest: for if they will profit and do sufficient good, in vayne it were to charge nature with the strongest receytes, which are rough, and churlish in working.
Of the infirmitie and disease in the gorge of a Hawke, when she dothe cast hir gorge.
SVndry are the diseases that Hawkes are pestred withall, by meane of the indisposition of the gorge, when yt parte is out of tune: among which the most ordinarie and perillous is the casting of the gorge, when a Hawke dothe cast hir meate vndigested, in the selfe same forme she receyued it· or else corrupted, and of a lothsome sauoure, both whiche they doe many times.
If shee cast it cleane, and not stincking, but of good smell, ther is no great feare of the matter, nor any great danger: bycause it maye proceede by meane some small bone is crossed and turned in the gorge of the Hawke, whiche doth cause hir to cast it againe for hir more ease and quiet: Wherefore in this case it shall be good for the more suretie, and to knowe the worst of the accident that may happen thereby, to beare your Hawke to the water, or to offer hir a bason of water, to trie whether she wil bowze or no.
For by bowzing, besides the good that she shall receyue by it, you shall haue euident proofe and vndoubted shewe of hir disease, and that in deede shee is sicke, and dothe stande in neede of Phisicke: but if shee bowze not at all, it argueth hir to bee in good time.
These accidentes are wonte to happen by meane of ouer much moysture and humiditie, and through excessiue rotte~ humors, engendred in the gorge.
Wherefore if the Hawke cast hir meate well sauoring, and of good coloure, neyther stinking to smell, nor lothsome to vewe, and do bowze after it, it shall be good to heate and comfort the gorge, with the powder of Nutmegges and Cloues, with a quantitie of Muske, all enwrapped in a peece of fine cotton, or bombast, giuing it to the hawke when she is emptie paneld, as custome is to do, holding hir on the fiste, vntill shee put ouer hir sayd casting into hir gorge.
Then two houres after she hath cast it againe, it shall be very necessary to feede hir with yong Doues, giuing but halfe a gorge, or somewhat lesse at a time: and at nighte when hee suppes hir, to lette hir plume a little, and if the Hawke will bowze, to giue hir leaue to doe it, for truly it will be very wholsome for hir.
By this meanes, promise you, haue recouered sundrie sieke Hawkes, and chiefly Sparowhawkes.
haue ouer and besides this, vsed with great good successe, good Rose water, altred wt a quantitie of powder of Cloues, and muske, preparing it after this manner: haue taken Rose water two ownces, powder of Cloues two scruples, of fine Muske fyue graines: and of this haue giuen my Hawke fyue ownces, or there about, after that as my Hawke hath bin either poore or hie in state, holding hir on the fiste, vntill she hath made a mewte.
This medicine will bring hir to a good apetite, a sweete breath, and will besides all these scowre very well.
But if that which she doth east, be corrupted and stincking: ouer and besides the aforesayd remedies, whiche indeede are excellent good, can allow well that you take the roote of Celidonie, or Celondine, remouing away the vpper rynde and pill off the roote, vntill it looke redde, and droppe agayne, then to infuse it in a quantitie of luke warme water, stirring the roote vp and downe in the water, to cause it to receyue the effect and qualitie of the Celydonie the more.
Of which roote you must (after you haue so done) conuey a pellet as bigge as a beane for the huger sorte of Hawkes, into the beake of your Hawke, thrusting it downe with your forefinger into the very gorge of hir, to the end it may the better descend into your Hawke.
Besides this, it is very good to open hir beake, and conuey into hir one spoonefull of the water aforesayd, not all at once, but at twice or thrice, closing fast hir clappes againe, bycause shee maye the better keepe it, and not cast it vp presently.
Thys beeyng done, keepe hir a space vppon the fiste, vntill the roote and licoure bee well settled in hir gorge.
After whyche, cast hir on the pearche, in suche a place, where is no resorte, eyther of people, dogges, chickens, cattes, or other suche lyke thynges, to the ende you maye the better discerne hir skowring: and besydes, that shee maye haue the lesse cause to bate.
There let hir stande, vntill shee hathe cast all the roote whiche shee receyued, and that the water hathe made hir mewte and slise sufficiently, whyche will doe hir very greate good.
Then after two houres it shall be well, to giue hir a yong Ratte or Mouse, newly stripped out of the skinne hote, and for lacke thereof, a yong Pigeon, whome you shall kill, by throwing hir forcibly against the grounde, with the raines downeward, bycause the bloud may gather togither, and stande: whereof feede youre Hawke, giuing hir the hart also, and the reynes thereof, withoute anye more allowance of any of the Pigeons fleshe.
When shee hathe dispatched and rydde this beaching of the Pigeons hart and bloud, or of the yong Ratte, then giue hir in like manner the like quantitie, onely of the dead doue: onely twice a day to a Sparowhawke, but to a Falcon or Goshawke, foure or fyue beachings in one day, euer obseruing the selfe same order that haue prescribed you.
The next morning you may, if neede be, in a little lint, or flaxe, or such like deuise, gyue a skowring of incense or Olibanum, meane, the leaues of it broosed in your hand, as small as is possible, gyuing hir but a small gorge, to the ende, that towardes the euening, you may allowe hir a reasonable supper.
By this vsage and order haue cured sundrie Hawkes of mine owne, and other mens.
You must note, yt whe~ these remedies aforesaid, do not profit, nor do the feate, and that the Hawke doth cast hir, more than twice, then is it a desperate case, and so much the woorse, if the Hawke be lowe and poore, for then in that case haue seene very few or none recured.
Neuerthelesse, haue somtimes seene a meruayle wrought in this case, by making the greater kind of Hawkes, as Falcons, Gerfalcons and such like, dronke with a sponfull or two of strong Malmesie, conueyed by force into hir gorge: but to ye lesser Hawkes you must not giue so muche of the Malmesie, but in lesse quantitie.
Which done, they haue bin placed vpon a bedde or a cusshen, for on the pearch they cannot stande, being drowsie, but will lie as things in a traunce, for the space of a quarter of an houre, and many neuer recouer themselues againe, but if happily any do after they are thus dealt withall, recouer and slise, and scoure away their medicine, no question that Hawke shall throughly recouer: then is it good to giue hir of the bloudy parts of a Pigeon vsed in that manner as foreshewed you, but this daungerous medicine is not to be giuen, but in desperate cases.
Of diuers accidents that happen to Hawkes, by meanes of fowlenesse of the gorge, and indisposition thereof.
IT hapneth sometimes that a Hawke can hardly put ouer hir meate which may be discerned by this, when in the morning she hath of hir supper aboue.
This misfortune chaunceth partly by reason hir meat was ouerdrie, and (as we may say) so hard baked in the gorge, as she coulde not put it ouer, and partly agayne, for that the Hawke cannot endue sufficiently, neyther yet dothe fyll in the pannell as shee oughte to doe.
In the firste case, haue holpen diuers with gyuing the Hawke water at wyll, to bowze hir pleasure, bathing besides hir feete pearche with freshe colde water: whiche not seruing the turne, haue thruste my forefinger into hir gorge, and so holpen it along, and somtimes my little finger, or a waxe candle: and by that meanes haue caused hir to fill in the ventricle sooner than otherwise she woulde haue done.
The weakenesse of which part diuers times is a cause that the hawke doth not well endew, nor fill in the Panell.
Somewhiles againe haue vsed, chiefly to Falcons, to giue a skowring in Cotton of powder of Mummie, prepared of Cloues and Nutmegs, rolling aloft vpon the cotton a litle lynte of Flaxe, bicause they should the sooner caste it.
When a hawke doth endew but slowly, hath by yt meanes smal lust to hir meate, you must thus do, to make hir more eger sharpe, wrappe hir meate in the feede of Nasturciu~, or watercrassies, and so cause hir to take it.
But this muste be vsed onely in winter, by reason that kinde of seede is very hotte.
The meate being thus vsed, will bring hir to be very sharpe sette, and cause hir to be well breathed, and besides make hir lustie, for in deede it is a medicine very excellent, and of infinite vertue.
Besides, sometimes the gorge is so out of tune, as it is the cause that the hawke at hir accustomed houre doth not caste, but retayneth hir casting within hir. Wherevpon it behooues some arte to be vsed to make hir caste.
The nexte remedie for yt (as haue sayde already) is to gyue the roote of Celendine, prepared in forme aforesayde.
Moreouer Mustard seede, otherwise called Senvye seede, is an excellent a present remedy for yt mischiefe, being co~ueyed into ye hawkes throte, of ye bignes of a beane, to ye huger sort of haukes: but to ye lesser haukes a lesse qua~tity ought to be giue~: and besides yt, one graine of Cloues, wt a litle pure Aloes wel washt, albeit yt wil somwhat vexe wro~g ye hauke in this ease But aboue all other, do commend and preferre a skowring conueyed into a little cotton casting, that is made of the pouder of Aloes Epaticke washt, of Cloues, Nutmegges and Ginger, of eache of these equall portions, rolling the cotton in a little Tow or Flaxe, making it as hard with your hande as you may, then rolling it in ye pouder of Cloues, and forcing it downe the hawkes throte: and presently you shall see your hawke caste it vp with the olde casting whiche she had before.
This, besides the benefite of that, will comfort greatly stre~gthen the gorge, and skowre the heade of all such euill humors, as are there, surcharging the same.
The vse of this deuise nowe and then, will be very necessarie and beneficiall to your hawkes without doubt.
If your hawke will not cast, take Aloes, Pepper, pouder of Cloues, and honie of Roses, making of all these a long pyll, and as bygge as a casting, gyue it your hawke, and she shall presently caste vpon the taking of it.
Of woormes, that molest and trouble hawkes out of measure.
NOwe do holde it high time, and the place very conuenie~t to write of such kinds of woormes, as do trouble and vexe ye poore hawke, as hir mortall enimies, which after a sort do depende of the gorge, through whose weakenesse there are engendred grosse and viscuous humors in the bowelles of a hawke, where beeing weakely wrought by default of naturall heate, the humor conuertes into small woormes a quarter of an ynche long, and more.
You may perceyue these woormes to plague and trouble your hawke, when you see hir caste hir gorge, when hir breath stynckes, when she trembleth and wrytheth hir trayne, when she croakes in the night, offreth with hir beake to hir pannell, when hir mewte is not cleane, white, nor in suche abundance as it oughte to bee.
And besides all this, when your Hawke keepes at one staye, and is lowe of flesh continually.
In this case it behooues you to destroy these woormes eyther with a skowring of washt Aloes Epaticke, Mustard sede, and Agaricke, of each one egal portions, vsing to giue it as haue taught you before.
Or else, by ministring the pouder of ye Gall of a Bore in the smoke: or if these fayle, to gyue the pouder of Harts horne being dryed.
White Dittander, Hiera pigra minore, (for there are sundry kindes of it) of eache two dra~mes, Aloes Epaticke well washt three drammes, Agaricke, Saffron, of each one dramme, being all incorporate with Hoonie of Roses, is an excellent remedie agaynst the woormes.
You muste keepe it well, and giue Falcons, Goshawkes, suche like, the bygnesse of a beane, but to Sparowhawkes, and the lesser sort of hawkes, as muche as a pease, in form of a pill, thrusting it down your hawkes throte, keping hir after it a space on ye fist, till she haue slised mewted hir medcine, feding hir afterward wt good meat after your wo~ted maner.
For the same disease it is very good, to giue a skowring of white Dittander, Aloes Epaticke well washt, Cubebes foure or fiue, a fewe flakes of Saffron enwrapped in a morsell of fleshe, to cause the hawke the better to take it.
This receyte, no doubt, will bothe make the hawke to slyse and mewte, and withall recouer hir.
For it is an approoued remedie againste the woormes, and specially when the hawke doth wrythe and wrest hir trayne.
Againe, take Rheuponticum, Suger Candy, filings of yron, of eache like quantitie, of these, with iuyce of Woormewood, frame pilles, and co~ueying them into the skinne of a chicken, giue your hawke one pill at a time, it shall do hir pleasure.
NOw am entred in speche of wormes, thinke it good to write somwhat of ye Filanders, to giue both knowledge cure of them.
Albeit these wormes doe not all depende of the gorge, for their naturall place being is neare the raynes of a hawke, where they be enwrapped in a certaine thinne nette or skinne, seueral by themselues, apart from either gut or gorge.
These Filanders (as the very name doth import,) are smal as threedes, one quarter of an ynche long, a more proper and peculiar to Falcons, than to any other hawke or fowle.
And this makes me to thinke, ye they are naturally allowed ye Falcon, bicause in deede they do not at al times vexe trouble the hawkes, but now then, specially when ye hawke is poore, low of flesh.
But if she be hie lustie, then by reson of ye abundance of nourishment foode yt they receiue from ye hawke, they molest hir not at all, but rather do hir good: and my reason is this.
cannot be induced to thinke that nature (who doth vse to make nothing but to some ende and purpose) hath produced placed those Filanders in that part of the Falco~ for naught, or to hurt the hawke.
But how and in what sort they pleasure or profit the hawke, coulde neuer yet reache by coniecture.
When they are troubled and grieued with the Filanders, you shall firste discerne it by the pouertie of the hawkes, by ruffling their traynes, and by certayne twytches and startes that they wyll make, strayning the fiste or pearche with their pownce, and lastly by their crooking in the nyght time, which kinde of noyse they vtter, when the Filanders pricke and gripe them within.
For when they wante their sustenance, whiche they can by no meanes haue, when the hawkes are lowe and poore, then do they endeuour to rende and breake that slender nette wherein they are naturally inclosed, to yssewe oute to seeke their vittayles some other where.
And manye tymes it happeneth, that, not seeing to it in tyme, and at the firste, they passe through their webbe, and crall vp as hyghe as the verie hearte, and other principall partes of the Hawke, whereof it muste needes consequently followe, that shee perisheth without redemption.
haue sometimes seene this pestilent woorme by piercing and breaking the bed wherein nature hath layde them, ascend vp so highe, as they came foorth, and appeared at the Hawkes beake and mouth.
Wherefore it shall be necessarie to respect the cure of these Fylanders, not by killing them (as you woulde doe other woormes, (for then happely beeyng deade, and rotting in that place, from whence they can not passe awaye with the Hawkes mewte, they woulde there corrupte and breede a filthie Apostume in hir) but the waye that you muste take: is, by making the~ droncke with some medicine to entertayne them, in such sort, as they may not offend or grype the hawke.
The beste remedie that can bee deuised for it, is to take a Garlicke head, pysling from the cloues thereof the vtmoste finde: whiche doone, you shall with some small yron toole, or bookine hette in the fyre, pierce the cloues, and make certayne holes in them.
And afterwards steeping them in Oyle at leaste three dayes, gyue your Falcon one of them downe hir throte: for the cloue of Garlicke vsed in this manner as tell you, will so inrage astonne the Filanders, that for thirtie or forty dayes after they wil not at al molest your hawke.
Wherevpon some Falconers, when their Falcons be low and poore, once in a moneth do of ordinarie gyue them a Cloue of Garlicke, for feare of the Filanders, to preuent the woorste, and truely to good effecte.
And for that verie purpose and cause, are seldom or neuer without Garlicke stieped in Oyle, where yt lo~ger they lye, ye better, more medicinable they are.
Thus must you deale with those Filanders, that lye in the raynes.
But there is one other kind of Filanders, lying in the guts, or pannell of a hawke, which are long, small, and white worms, as though they had dropt out of ye raines of ye hawke.
If you will destroy those Filanders, you must take Aloes Epaticke, fylings of yron, Nutmegges, so much Honie, as wil serue to frame a pyll, which pyll you shall giue your hawke in ye morning, as soone as she hath easte, holding hir on ye fiste for ye space of an houre after.
Then cast hir on ye perche, when you gesse hir to haue slysed hir pill, and mewted it cleane, then feede hir with good hotte meate.
There are besides these, yet one other sorte of Filanders in the guttes of a hawke also, whiche cause a hawke to caste hir gorge as soone as she hath fedde, and do make hir strong breathed: for them prouide this remedie.
Take Aloes Epaticke, Wormwood made into very small pouder, temper the pouder with Oyle of bitter Almondes: and that done, annoynte therewith the flanckes and sides of your hawke.
And if you like not the Oyle, for gresing your Falco~s feathers plumes, compounde those sayde pouders wt Vineger at the fire: but it is certaine that the Oyle is the better farre of both, and more proper to this disease.
If you can, giue your hawke Oyle of bitter Almonds, and not disquiet hir gorge, after it bestow ye other cure vpon hir, with the annointing hir as haue taught you· you shal finde it the most perfect remedie, yt may be against those Filanders, that lodge in the guttes and bowels of your hawke.
THe lyuer of a hawke is oftentimes inflamed by ouermuch bating trauaile, as it happeneth not seldome to Falcons brought from farre forrayne parts by shippe: againe, when they bee impacient and bedlam in the mewe, or when they flee surcharged wt ouergreat bells.
For the ouerbelling of a Falco~, puts hir to a greater payne trouble, than needes.
Againe somtimes it happeneth by meane of an Apostume, which is enge~dred either by some pricke of a thorne, or the stripe of an other hawkes pownce, by crabbing wt hir.
For whe~ they haue such a stripe or pricke, ye skinne is broken outwardly, but ye bloud remaining corrupt within, enge~dreth ye apostume.
Many times this disease of the lyuer proceedes of some broose agaynste the grounde, or in a tree, or the encounter with another fowle.
You shall perceiue this disease of the inflamation of ye liuer, when your hawke standeth melancolie, casteth not at hir accustomed and woonted houres, by hir fowle castings, by hir stynking and yll coloured mewtes, (whereof spake before) by hir labouring thicke in the panell, and by feeling of hir: For hir pulse dothe beate as the pulse of a man that hath a feuer.
The disease is the moste pestilent and daungerous of all others.
If the heate of hir lyuer proceede of too muche bating, or broyling with hir selfe, you maye easily cure hir with foure or fyue good lyquide and cooling gorges, as to feede hir with the legge of a Pullette, or the hearte of a Veale, bathed in water of Buglosse, Bowrage, Hartes tongue, and suche like waters.
Moreouer it is very souerayne, to washe hir meate in the iuyce of Heubane, or else (that whiche doeth muche more refreshe the hawke) to take a lyttle larde or Bacon, withoute the rynde, and well washte and conserued in good Rose water, and laste of all rolled in powder of Suger Candie.
With this receyt more than with any other, am accustomed to recomfort and refreshe my hawke, when she is sicke of hir liuer.
And specially, good freshe butter, or Oyle washte and prepared, as taught you in the former chapter.
But when the mischiefe of the lyuer is engendred by some pricke of a thorne, or the crabbing with some other hawkes or fowle, as diuers tymes it happeneth to the Falcon, by encounter with a Hearon, when they binde togither in the ayre.
In this extremitie, Mummie purified, made to powder, is very good.
You must rolle your hawkes meate in this Mummie prepared three or foure tymes, so gyue it your hawke: and if shee refuse to take it of hir selfe, then conuey it into hir by force, with a Cotton casting, four or fiue dayes one after an other.
If she be ill affected in hir lyuer, by a broose against ye grou~d or against a tree, or by encounter with some other fowle, then take Rewbarbe of the best one scruple, dry it vpon a hot yron panne, vntill it may be made into fine pouder, of that gyue in a canuas casting, the weight of two graines of wheate to your larger sort of hawkes, but for the lesse hawke ye one halfe will suffise.
After she hath taken this casting, if she be hye in fleshe, then two houres after feede hir with a Pullets legge, washt in one of those cooling waters, but if she be lowe poore, wt good hot meate.
Thus must you co~tinue four or fiue dayes, giuing one day the casting wt Rewbarbe, another day wt the Mu~my aforesayd.
Truly without doubt your hawke shal recouer if you folow this methode, vnlesse the lyuer be remoued out of his place, which somtimes doth happen by somegreat broose or straine.
And you shall know it by a co~tinual hardnesse, which you shal feele in the hawkes panell, by hir yellowe mewtes.
For this inco~uenience there is no remedie in ye world to be had, although you wolde trye all yt medicines yt are to be vsed to hawkes, you shal profit nothing.
It must nedes folow, that wtin fiue daies your hawke peke of ye perche.
Giordanus, an excellent Falconer, for ye indisposition heate of the lyuer, willeth you to take halfe an ownce of Soldanel, and one ownce of Iroes, which is floure de Luce.
You muste beate these into fine powder, conuey it into your casting, so giue it your hawke.
Withall at nyght he willes you, when your hawke hath put ouer, and well skowred hir filth, feede hir with good meate, washt in these cooling waters following.
Take water of Endiue, Maydenheare, Cycorie, and Buglosse: in these waters may you wash your hawkes meate, as also hir casting, if it please you, wrapping in ye casting ye pouder aforesayde.
For what with the helpe of the one and the other, no doubt you shall see a very good effect.
Moreouer the sayde Giordanus sayth, yt Gerfalcons are of al other ye hottest hawkes, therfore to maintaine kepe the~ sou~d he doth aduise to wash their castings in this water folowing.
Take Endiue water, Maydenheare, otherwise called Capillus Veneris, the water of Scabiosa, of eyther twoo ownces, one dramme of choise Rewbarbe, of the best Agarick one scruple, put these in infusion, where after they haue bin infused seuen houres, wash your Hawks casting in it.
This order vse euer, when your Gerfalcon is out of tune, and it shall greatly pleasure hir.
Of diseases that happen to Hawkes feete, and first as touching the swelling of a Hawkes foote.
SOmetymes the arme and foote of a Hawke doeth swell, by meanes of yll humors that descende and drop downe, through weaknesse of the foote or arme, through ouergreat trauail toile, through age, by reaso~ of some blow or broose receiued lo~g before.
This mischiefe may easily bee discerned as well by vewe of eye as touch of hande: for besides that you shall plainly perceiue it in sight, you may feele a verie great heate in the member, so as sometimes the hawke is vnable to stande on hir legges, for paine and anguish thereof.
Wherfore it is necessarie to looke to it with all care that may be, and so vse the matter, as the humor breede not the goute, or the pinne, which oftentymes happeneth to those poore byrdes, to their great and continuall plague.
The way to cure it, is to giue the humor a vent by launsing it, and after that to recomfort the member by often annoynting it with the white of an Egge, Vinegar, and Rose water, well beaten and coyled togither, or else with verie good olde Oyle of Oliues, such as you can come by out of a Bottell wherein Oyle hath beene long time kept: for those droppes that hardly come out of the Bottel, are farre better than any newe fresh Oyle, and are more medicinable in this case.
Moreouer besides the ceasing the paine, to delay the swelling, you shall finde it verie excellent good, to take the powder of Acacia, and terra Sigillata, of either four drammes, incorporating them with vineger, the white of an Egge, Rose water, and the iuyce of Nightshade, as muche as will suffice to make this vnguent soft and delicate, and with this receyte to annoynt the hawkes foote or arme oftentimes for a space: for this vnguent no question, will both take away the immoderate ache and paine, as also mollifie and delay the swelling, and so restore your hawk to hir former plight againe.
An other approued medicine is, to annoynt the swelling of your hawkes foote with Olium Petroleum, (which is the oyle of a Rocke) and with Oyle of white Lillies, taking of eche of these like quantitie, the bloud of a Pigeon, and the tallow of a candle, heating all these togither a little at the fire.
This vnguent will throughly resolue the mischiefe, or at the least, by resoluing the thinnest humors, bring it to that passe, as you shall see the grossest partes well digested, which you shall perceyue by the whitenesse and hardnesse therof.
Then must you make an issue, by launcing finely with a knife the skin of the hurt place, and afterwards annoint it for certaine dayes with the vnguent aforesayde, and it shall recouer.
Besides this, a very good remedie for the swelling in a hawkes foote, after a rupture made, is to vse this cerotte that followeth.
Take Gumme Arabicke, Armoniacke, Sagapeum, a gumme so called, of either two drammes, Greeke Pitch, and ship Pitche, of eche a reasonable quantitie, Powder of Masticke three ounces, of Oyle of Iuniper, or of the Firre tree, new waxe as much as wil suffice to make a Cerot, according to Art: dissolue your gumms in Vineger, which done, spread of this vpon a pleggat of linnen cloth, applying it handsomly both within the foote and without, making certaine holes wherthrough to conuey the hawkes stretchers or talons: Alwayes remembring if the swollen part be broken before the application of your Cerot, to mundifie and clense the water and slime that is in the wound, and so euery two or three dayes to chaunge and renew your Cerot.
The vertue of it is to desiccat, comfort and mundifie the filth and quitture that is in the hurt member, whereby the hurt must of force be recouered.
MAny times for all the care and remedies aforesayde, the gowte doth befall a Hawke, which is none other thing than a hard tumor and swelling, full of corruption aboute the ioyntes of a Hawkes foote and stretchers, which disease is verie painefull and offensiue, by meane whereof the Hawke cannot pray.
Truly the Gowte is an incurable euill, and may bee tearmed a nunquaem sanus.
Let falconers, and writors say what they lyst, for my part, can this much assure you, that in all my life, was neuer able by anye deuise to cure the Gowte confyrmed, whether it were for want of cunning in me, or by reason of the malignitie of the disease, whiche doeth rebell and scorne anye remedie that shall bee applyed vnto it.
Yet notwithstanding, bycause it shall not seeme, that doe it vpon slouth, and for desire to bee silent, will laye downe some one remedie or two vsed by dyuerse Falconers, thoughe oft tymes to small purpose or successe.
Some for the Gowte, do vse to take the Pilles of wilde Apples or Crabbes, wilde and sowre Sloes, the rinde of an Ashe, or the Keyes that grow vpon the Ashe beaten into small powder, mingling it with halfe a pounde of olde Oyle Oliue, all which they put into a Glasse Bottell: or other vessell of Glasse, close stopte wyth Paste, or suche lyke deuise, so as no breathe may issue foorthe of the Vessell, whiche done, they couer it in Sande in the Sunne, or in Horse dung, for the space of fortie dayes, and after that, they streyne it altogyther, so as the vertue of the ingredience maye bee incorporated wyth the Oyle.
With this forsooth they annoynt the place, hoping to resolue and cure the Gowte, whiche coulde neuer doe vpon any Hawke of mine.
Other some doe accustome to annoynt the Gowte in a Hawke, with the milke or iuyce of Selendine, and the marrow of a Bacon hogge, and taking a peece of linnen clothe, do bath the member euery thirde day, with the strongest Vineger they can get, and do cause theyr Hawke to stande vpon all this, for remedie of the Gowte.
Againe, there are, that with the iuyce of Selendine, Vineger, and Honie, doe vaunte they haue made an vnguent, wherewith they haue done greate woonders.
But bycause by experience coulde neuer finde these to preuaile in the cure of the goute, leaue to speake or wryte in commendation of the same, putting you out of all hope for recouerie of the same.
Of the Pin in the Hawkes foote, a disease much like the corne in the foote of a man.
THere is yet one other euill which happeneth in the foote of a hawke, by meane of matter that powreth downe, in a maner as hard to be cured as the Goute, and as combersome to the fillie hawke as the Goute, for by reason of the Pyn she is neyther well able to foote hir pray, to feede hir selfe, nor yet to stande sure vpon hir Pearche.
The Pynne is a swelling disease, that doth resemble sharpe nayles, rysing vp in the bottome or palme of the Hawkes foote: and by reason it doeth so muche in shape resemble a nayle, by meane of the sharpnesse thereof, those swellings are called by the Falconers of Italie Chiodetti, as a man woulde terme them in English, small nayles, of which verie fewe Hawkes can bee recured.
Yet for remedie of this disease, some do aduise to open the vain of the leg, a thing not only friuolous to talke of, and a verie olde womans fable, or Cantorburie tale, but also verie perillous to be put in practise.
For truly neither wil my selfe at any time practise it, ne yet aduise others to do it.
can more co~mend, that you mollifie and make soft the sayde Pyn with strong Vineger, the best that may be gotten, which done, pare it till the bloud follow after: then to bring it to maturation, and to ripen it, applie handsomly vpon it in a linnen plegget, a quantitie of vnguent made of iuyce of Lemmons, one ounce a halfe of hennes greese, three drammes powder of Masticke, leaues of Bittonie, and Frankensense, or Olibanum, a reasonable portion, and so much newe waxe as will serue the purpose.
Besides this, doe vse to boyle in good white wine, all these things togither, Waxe, Oyle of bitter Almondes, of eche lyke quantitie, a little Sage, Frankinsense, Rewe, Rosemarie, to the consumption of three partes, then pounding well all these wyth Turpentine and yellowe Waxe, make an vnguent of excellent vertue and operation.
And if by these remedyes aforesayde, the Pynne become to be soft, and forgo his hardnesse, then doeth it behoue you, to cutte it out from the roote, as lowe as is possible, and to drye it vppe with Agrippa, an vnguent so called, and with Gratia dei, mingling these two togyther by equall portions, as muche of the one as of the other.
Ouer and besides all these, the playster that is called Emplastrum Sacrum, and Isis, whom the Apothecaries do so terme, are of singular vertue, bycause they doe mollifie, and desiccate the wounde or disease.
cannot remember, that aboue twice, coulde euer doe any good vpon my Hawkes herewith (nor with any other remedie) and therefore will leaue to make any further recitall hereof.
There be some ventrous Falconers, that will with a cauterizing yron go about to roote and burne out the Pinne, which will at no time endeuour to doe, doubting least thereby shall shrinke my Hawkes sinewes, and spoyle my Hawke, by meanes they are so neare neighbours to the Hart.
Of the breaking of a Pounce, or Cley of your Hawke.
SEyng that haue begonne to wryte, and decipher you the mischiefes that doe happen to Hawkes feete, it shall not bee besyde my purpose, nor amisse, to saye somewhat of the cure of theyr Pounces and Talons, when eyther by stryking the fowle, or by any other accident, they breake cleane off, or riue in sunder.
Wherfore when your Hawke happeneth to haue this mischief, the part of the pounce, or the whole pounce beeing broken away, you muste applie vnto it the bladder of the gall of a Henne, vsing the matter so as it may get into the broken Talon, bynding it so handsomely and artificially to the Hawkes foote, as the gall may not issue out, nor fall away from the place.
This deuise will stoppe the bloude, ceasse the paine, and within foure or fiue dayes, fasten and harden the horne of the Pounce, so as the Hawke shall be able to flee: and if she be a falcon, she shall strike or ruffe a Ducke as before hir hurt.
And to the ende your Hawke teare it not awaye with hir beake, it shall be necessarie eyther to clappe hir on a hoode with a false beake made vnto it, or to fasten to hir hoode a peece of leather artificially, so long and large as maye serue the turne, to arme hir beake, so as in time hir Pounce, if it bee but broken, maye waxe hole againe: or if it bee cleane ryued awaye, a newe may growe in the place agayne.
Let this suffice as touchyng the breaking or ryuing of the Pounce of a Hawke.
VVhen the thigh or legge of a Hawke is out of ioynt.
BY some outwarde accident, many tymes the thighe or legge of a Hawke is become out of ioynt: wherefore it shall be verie necessarie in this case, as soone as is possible, to set it in his right and naturall place againe, to the ende that no matter nor fluxe of humor descende or distill, to hinder the setting of it in ioynt againe, whiche must needes ensue if it be not regarded in time.
Which done, set the Hawke in some such place, where she shall haue no occasion to bate or broyle with hir selfe, but bee at the greatest quiet and rest shee maye, applying medicines that haue vertue to desiccate and strengthen the hurte member, which you shall doe, by bathing a Linnen plegget, or a plegget of Flaxe in the white of an Egge, Oyle of Roses, and Turpentine, with two drammes of Saenguis Draconis, and of Aloes incorporated togyther, and bynding it aboute the thigh or legge whiche is out of ioynt, and fastning ouer and aboue the sayd plegget a slender roller of linnen cloth, to conserue and kepe it the more firmely and stayedly in the place where you woulde haue it to remayne.
Vsing the matter thus ten dayes togyther, shifting and renewing the medicine euerye two dayes once, to the ende the plegget waxe not ouer drie and stiffe to the hurte member.
can lyke verie well withall, if before you applie this sayde medicine, you bathe well the thigh or legge of the Hawke with a reasonable warme lotion or bath, made of Wine, Roses dried, Myrrhe, Sage, Comfrey, Camomill, and Rosemarie: for these will warme and comfort the nerues and sinewes, and withall drie vp such fluxe of humor, as shall poure downe vpon the lame and broosed member.
When a Hawke hath broken a thigh or a legge.
IF by any mishap your Hawke haue broken an arme or a leg, as sundrie tymes Falcons that are fowle slayers doe vse to doe, by some strype, or encounter at the Brooke with a strong fowle, you must with all care and speede, sette right the broken bones in their naturall place againe: whiche done, deplume and plucke away the feathers from the member that is hurt, round about the wounde.
Then take Bole Armoniake Aloes Epatick of the best, Saenguis Draconis, Of eche a reasonable quantitie, made into fine powder.
After that take of Beane floure, Barly floure, Linsede floure, Of eche one dramme.
Then take of Oyle of Dill, Oyle of Roses, Of eche two drammes.
Then take The white of an Egge, The mucillage of Fenegreke, The mucillage of Linseede, The mucillage of Hollihock, So muche of these as will serue too make a playster according to arte.
When you haue made this playster, spreade a portion of it thinne, vpon Flaxe or Linte well towsed, applying it vpon the rupture and broken place, wyth as greate cunning and care as you can: you can not vse it too daintily, when you applie it, bycause of the tendernesse of the hurt.
This done, bynde it with a fine Linnen roller to staye the playster.
Then make fine splets of Timber, all of one length, thinne as may be, and in fashion like the scales of a Sworde scabbarde, whome you must enwrappe in Lynt for broosing the member.
These splets bestowe orderly aboute your Hawkes legge or thighe on euerie side, bynding them with the Linnen rollers or fillets artificially, but neyther so loosely as the bones may slippe out of theyr place, ne yet so streightly, but that the hurt member may receyue hys naturall nourishment and comfort.
For otherwise it woulde be mortified, and the vse of it lost.
This ligature and rolling of the member, must be continued at the least .xxx. dayes, for that the bone cannot close againe firmly vnder one Monethes space.
Yet can wishe, that you vnbinde your rollers, and chaunge your medicine, twice at the least in the first fiftene dayes, dealing so daintily as the bones may not sunder thereby.
And by meane thereof will your medicine, and the ligature, worke the better effect.
Lastly, it shall not be amisse, after you haue thus done, to vse for three or foure dayes this lotion or water, to bath your hawkes legge, to strengthen and comfort the place.
Take Roche Alom one dramme, Roses dryed, the pyll or rind of Pomgranets, and Frankinsense, of ech a small quantitie, white Wine as muche as will suffise: wherein you must boyle these things aforesayd, to the consumption of halfe the wine, with this lotion, bath your hawkes thighe and legge, plucking away the feathers as aforesayde.
And this shall comfort the member, so as no fluxe of humors shall repayre to the place.
Besides all this, you must not forget, during the time of this cure, to keepe your diseased Hawke remoued from all noyse and accesse of people: and if this misfortune befall hir in the Winter time, you must set hir warme.
Moreouer, it shall be good and necessarie in the beginning of your cure, to giue your hawke, Aloes washt, or Agarick in Trocysckes to scoure hir, to the ende there grow no inflamations.
And withall to feede hir with good meate, the better to mainteyne hir in state during the cure.
It will be good for you to vse the helpe of some Apothecarie for the confection of the playster, as also for your lotion or bathe: for the more artificially it is made, the better effect it will take.
Truely it doth stande with good reason, that it will recure your Hawke, the receyte is so good.
All the care must be in the daintie handling of the broken member, and in rolling and spleting it orderly.
HAwkes are wont diuerse times to receiue stripes and blowes by other fowles, as the Falcon by encounter with a Heron, and sometimes by some other accident, as by carying hir in a hawks bag vpo~ occasion, or by rashing into bushes and thornes, or such like hurtfull places.
These strypes and hurtes either are simple hurtes (as they are termed) that is to say in the skinne and fleshe of a Hawke only, or else compoundes, as when a nerue and sinewe is prickt, or cut in sunder.
The symple woundes and hurtes are of slender or no daunger at all, and will bee recured lightly agayne, eyther with the iuyce of Orgium, or a bathe and lotion made of Masticke, Aloes, and Myrrhe, two drammes, Pympernell, Comfrey, and Sage, of eyther a handefull and a halfe, of Agresta cleare and good, sixe poundes, putting all these things aforesayde, into a stone Vessell made verye cleane, or else into an earthen potte, there suffering it to boyle so long with a close couer vppon it, vntill two thirde partes of the Agresta bee wasted and consumed.
Then strayning it verie well, adding vnto it one ounce of powder of Myrtils.
This may you reserue to vse as a blessed and soueraigne medicine.
There is yet one other notable medicine, deuised by maister Fredericke Zorzi, and oftentymes approued by me, with verie good successe.
Take good Aloes, Myrrhe, Olibanum, and Saenguis Draeconis, of either one dramme, of fine Graynes one scruple: beate all these into powder, and infuse them in two ounces of Aqua vitae, for the space of twelue houres: then after strayne it verie well, and of this vse to the hurtes of your Hawkes head, and also to hir shoulders, if they receyue any broose or stripe.
But in any condition cannot allowe the vse of Oyle of Roses, in hurtes of the heade, as it seemes, that the sayde Authour woulde haue it.
If your Hawkes skinne of hir thigh or hinder partes be broken, fretted awaye, or hurt by bearing hir in a close Canuas bagge, or such like, you maye easily recouer hir with thys deuise.
The leaues of dryed Sage beaten to powder, or the powder of Olibanum, or Masticke, bathing the hurt with white wine, when you meane to applie the powder, and in two or three dayes you shall see it recouered.
But if the stripe be ioyned and matched with the offence of any nerue or sinewe, then will it be a harder matter to cure, for that the hurt is of greater importaunce and daunger, for then is it wont to be full of paine, and to cause inflamation.
Wherefore in this case, the best remedie that can be deuised is, excellent good Oyle powred reasonable hote into the hurt, taking away the feathers first that are about the wounde, and vsing this bathe about the member where the hurt is.
Take Roche Alome one dramme, dryed Roses, ryndes of Pomegranettes, and Myrrhe, of eche a quantitie, boyling all these in good odoriferous white Wine to the consumption of halfe.
No question this will greatly comfort the wounde, and hinder the fluxe of humors, that otherwise woulde flowe downe to the place, and breede an Apostume.
Much more might be sayd of stripes and brooses of hawkes, but doe leaue you ouer to the learned Phisitions, and skilfull Surgeons, bycause will not ouerwearie you with tedious circumstaunces: accounting it sufficient for mee, to haue layde downe the cures for most ordinarie hurtes, which doe ryfest happen to Hawkes, and of such as haue tymes past by fortune come to my handes.
If you couet to haue greater store of medicines, for the cure of any member or hurt part of your Hawke, aduise you that haue skill in the Italian tongue, to flee ouer to Messier Frederigo Giorgi, his practise, plainely and excellently set downe in his booke of Falconrie, from whence haue collected sundrye things.
But as touching these hurtes and strypes of Hawkes, haue not borrowed muche of him, but haue in this parte of my collection, more vsed the briefe cure of Francesco Sforzino Vicentino, that excellent Italian Gentleman Falconer.
HAuing hithervnto spoken of such diseases and greefes, as for the most part Hawkes are troubled withall within their bodies: nowe remayneth that in fewe speeches shew you a remedie for vermin and Life, a particular passion and affection that lighteth on the skinne of a Hawke, and specially about hir heade, the plie of hir wings, and hir trayne: for in deede these Life and Mytes doe chiefly raigne and lodge in those three partes of the Hawkes more than in any other.
Falconers doe vse to ridde these vile wormes and Life in the Winter time, by taking of pepper beaten to powder two drams, of warme water one pounde, or as much as will suffice, mingling the Pepper and water well togither, and then to pepper (as we terme it) or washe all hir feathers with the sayde lotion or bathe, and specially those partes of the Hawke whereof spake before, where the Mites and Life do most haunte: whiche done, they set the Hawke on a perche, with hir trayne and backe to the Sunne ward, holding in their handes a small sticke one handfull long, on the toppe whereof they fasten a peece of waxe, either red, or greene, and with that, (while the Hawke doth weather hir) they take away the Life and Mytes crawling vpon the feathers, so as before the Hawke be throughly dryed and weathered, what with the waxe, and their owne dropping away, there will not be a vermin left about the hawke.
For the Pepper and water doth so much disease them, as they are enforced to leaue their accustomed lodgings: then the heate of the Sunne, or fire, helpes to make them shew themselues: and the waxe by cleauing to them, vtterly and clearely riddes the hawke of them.
haue seene some Falconers adde vnto the Pepper and water, a quantitie of Stauesagre, as an enimie to the life and mytes, by meane of strength and force that is in it: and take it to be verie necessarie to be added in this medicin to the Pepper, for the better dispatch of those vile vermines, which do so much vex and annoy the hawke, as she can by no meanes keepe hir selfe in good state, whilest she is incombred with them.
You must remember to pepper your hawke in this maner, as haue shewed you, in a verie warme sunnie day, when there is no winde at all blowing in the Skie.
But if by fortune you bee enforced to do it in another time, when the weather is colde, and the Sunne not shining, then must you set your hawke by the fire to weather hir, and drie hir feathers: but neither must the fire be ouer hote, nor the gorge of your Hawke towardes the fire, whereof haue giuen you aduertisement before, in those precepts which are to be obserued of a good Falconer.
For if you set hir with the gorge to the fire, no doubt, she will receyue no small harme and inconuenience thereby, and for the moste part death ensues of it.
In the Sommer time you may dispatch your hawke of the Life Mites with Auripigmentu~ beaten into verie fine pouder, bestowing and sifting it betwixt the hawkes feathers with your fingers, and specially in those places where they doe most vsually haunt, alwayes hauing regarde that none of the powder come into your hawkes eyes for offending hir.
And after the bestowing of this powder, you must in no wise bespowt hir with water (as some do vse to doe) to the great hurt and mischiefe of those poore byrdes.
For the bathing or spowting hir with water, is a meane to make the powder to frette awaye, and consume the Hawkes feathers.
Some other affyrme, that Mynt leaues boyled in water, to the consumption of a thirde part, bathing the Hawke therewith somewhat warme, will dispatch the Lise and Mytes, but for my part, neuer approued this medicine, and therefore can saye little of it.
Let these suffise as touching the peppering of lowsie hawkes, for of all other plagues that befall the Hawke, account thys the least, bycause they may most easily be destroyed, as dayly experience doth teach vs: and yet the remedies for them good to be knowne, bycause you shall seldome or neuer buy a Hawke from the Cage that is not lowsie, or set your Hawke on a Perche where a lowsie Hawke hath stoode, and she shall be assured to be neuer a lowse the worse for it.
And first of all, of their laying egges in the mew.
Among all which (to passe ouer the gresinesse and excessiue glitte, that they are surcharged withall, hauing somewhat toucht that matter in the Chapter of the Goute) the greatest mishap that may be is, when Hawkes fall to laying egges, and to be with egge in the mewe.
For in verie deede this is a great mischiefe, and dyuers tymes doth kill the hawke.
You shall first perceyue it by the creaking and crying that they vse in the mewe sometymes, and otherwhiles on the perche, albeit now and then they do it for egernesse and apetite, when they are sharpe set: which as it is easily founde, so is it as quickly remedied.
man shall knowe when they fall to lyking and laying, by this, from the necke of the Hawke, downe to the verie middle of hir traine, there is vpon the feather, a certaine thing like the floure of Branne, of a pale and ashie colour.
And bycause this accident happeneth by meane of too muche daintinesse, and lustfull pride of the Hawke, it shall bee good to keepe hir low, and to holde a hard hand ouer hir, pinching hir of hir feeding, giuing hir liquide and moyst fleshe, from the middle of Aprill, to the ende of May, which is the only time to be feared of all the yeare for this matter.
When the Hawke doth leaue hir croaking and crying in the mewe, it is a manifest proofe that she is with Egge, whiche you shall knowe, both by hir grossnesse and filling in the pannell, as also by hir ydle standing withoute list to feede.
And if happely the Egges bee growne any thing great within hir, you shall hardly hinder hir, but that shee will lay them.
Therefore (as tell you) it shall be good in tyme to looke vnto it, keeping hir lowe in Aprill and May.
And in those monethes to minister vnto hir, Aloes Epaticke washt, a quantitie of Saffron lapped in Bombast or Cotton, wherevpon conuey a little Flaxe or Towe, and make a casting or scouring of it, thrusting it downe hir throte into hir gorge, the Hawke being both emptie panneld, and hauing no meate aboue to put ouer, keeping hir on the fist after it, till such time the scouring be in hir gorge.
Of this and suche like scourings may you giue your hawke euery third or fourth day, for foure or fiue times, feeding hir with liquid meates, such as will lightly be indewed.
And vsing this order, no doubt your hawke shall do well.
Againe it is verie good agaynste the same mischiefe, to cause your Hawke in foure or fiue byttes of meate, to take a quantitie of Saffron in chyues, vsing hir after the manner and forme aforesayde.
Moreouer it is a very good way, to delay and kill the list and lyking of a Sparhawke, to feede hir for three, foure, or moe dayes, if you thinke good, with liquid meates washt in water, wherin the great pilles of Ornus haue beene infused for the spare of eight or ten dayes, being finely cut to peeces.
But it shoulde be farre better, if you cause those rindes and pilles to bee boyled in water, so long vntill they become softe and tender, and then to wash your Hawkes meate therein.
If your Hawke bee with Egge (as they terme it) so as you may perceiue and feele the egges within hir, besides those foresaid remedies, it shall be good to annoynt hir tuell with oyle Olife: which being done, conuey in thy forefinger at hir tuell, as finely as thou canst, to feele the egges, whiche if thou once feele, gripe thy Hawkes pannell softly for hurting hir, forcing downwards the egge towardes thy finger in hir tuell, and if it be possible so bring it away cleane, and rid thy hawke of it: but if thou canst not do it, breake it euen there right, and afterwarde bestowe a clyster vpon thy hawke of things lenitiue, to make hir mewt and slise well: for by this meane (as my Italian Authour doth informe me) thou shall discharge thy hawke of this mischiefe, and bring hir to be in perfite state againe.
SOmetimes it so falleth out, that Hawkes doe not mewe in time, so as they may be flowen with in the pleasant tyme of the yeare, nor be drawne when other Falconers do accustome to drawe their hawkes, but they come so late as the yeare is farre spent, and small pleasure to bee taken in keeping or fleeing with them, for which a man is sometimes driuen of force to vse deuise to further the matter, and to practise to make hir mew sooner than hir accustomed maner is to mew of hir selfe.
Wherfore to make a hawke mewe timely, the surest and best way is to cast hir off into a good mewe for the purpose, (made in maner as haue taught you before) and there to allow hir of the best hote meates that may be had, as Quayles, Pigeons, and Sparrowes, and now and then among, to set hir in the mewe some vessell, large and deepe, conueniently filled with water, wherein your hawke may bowse and bath at hir pleasure.
But if this ordinarie kinde of good and kindely mewing will not serue the turne, (which seldome, or neuer almost happeneth to Goshawkes, for that by this former fashion vsage they do vse to mewe verie well and orderly) then (as sayde) it behoueth to assist and further nature by Arte and Phisicke, to cause a Hawke to mewe tymely.
To helpe in this case, those kyrnelles or small nuttes, whiche are growing vnder the throte of a Weather, are verie good (as mine Authour affyrmeth) vsing them euery thirde day, for thrice, or thereaboutes, allowing a Sparrowhawke three or foure of them at once, being both emptie gorged and panneld.
But you may giue a Falcon sixe or more at one time, holding the hawke on the fist, till she beginne to slise and mewte, and after that a space feede hir with good hote meate, alwayes remembring, that if the hawke do loath the taking of them, (as happely shee will) or doe not verie well brooke them after she hath taken them, then that you giue hir respite betwixte tymes, for three or foure dayes togither, to the ende shee may not finde hir selfe cloyed with them.
If at the ende of eight dayes she beginne to cast any feather, then may you into the mewe with hir, without more a doe: but if not, then must you fall to giuing hir of those glandulous kirnels of the Weather againe, once or twice more: for vsing it in this order the seconde time, without question, within sixe or seuen dayes shee will cast the backe feathers, or hir sarcels or flagges: the~ must you throw hir into the mew, giuing hir water to bath, for shee will verie muche couet the water, and you shall see hir within two or three dayes so bare and in a maner cleane without feathers, as she will not be able for lacke of them, to flee to hir ordinarie stande or pearch.
Wherefore can commende, and aduise you to haue some lowe perche and stande for hir in the mewe, wherevnto shee may iumpe when she hath cast hir feathers, so as she is vnable to flee.
Especially remembring to feede hir all that while she is so without feathers, twice in a day, allowing hir such and so much meate, as she can endew, and make away with.
For all that tyme will she couet great gorges, and ridde great store of meate, vntill shee haue recouered hir cote againe.
And to restrayne hir, or keepe a harde hand vpon hir, hauing mewed hir feathers, and being now at poynt to put forth newe in their places, wyll breede hir feathers to bee full of tayntes, and ill fauoured, and besides that hir sarcelles and principalls will not be so long and large as they ought to be, by meanes whereof she will not be able to flee so well as shee was accustomed.
Some others, to cause a hawke to mewe speedely, do wyll you to enwrappe hir meate in the powder of a Frogge, dryed in an Ouen, or Fornace.
Other some, in the powder of a Cuttell bone, taking of the powder of this fishe bone, to the weyght of a pennie.
But these practises and deuises did neuer approoue, and therfore do committe them to the discretion of the Reader.
Of accidentes that happen and lyght vpon a hawkes feathers, and firste, how to vse the matter, when a feather cannot be imped.
DIuers and sundrie tymes it so falles oute, that a hawkes feather beeyng drawen out of the wyng or trayne, by violence and force, the hole closes vp, and shuttes after it presently, in suche sorte, as a newe feather can by no meanes growe and spring vp in the place, to serue the hawkes turne and vse agayne.
For remedie heereof, some doe wyll a man to make the hole agayne, where it was before, and to open it a freshe, with a Barlye grayne, dryed so as it bee not burnte.
Then after that, to keepe it open, that it runne not togyther agayne, you muste frame a small pellette of Larde, or boyled Hoonie, whiche being conueyed into the hole, will there abyde, vntill suche time as the shooting oute of the new feather do remoue it, and displace it.
Some other time it happeneth a feather to be broken in the quill, so neere the wing, as it is not possible to ympe it againe: then do they vse, (to make the quill to fall and droppe away withoute payne to the Hawke) this deuise.
They annoynte the place with the bloude of a yong Ratte, whiche will cause the broken quyll to come away.
After which, to kepe the hole pen, they vse the helpe aforesayde, with the Barly corne.
These twoo cures, neuer tryed, bycause it was neuer my happe, (I thanke fortune) to stand needefull of the practise.
But truely like neyther of them so well, as can greately commende them.
Otherwhile it chaunceth, through the hurte of a Hawkes wing, that one or twoo of hir Flagges, long feathers, or Sarcelles, are broosed, and thereby bothe put hir to greate paynes, and eake hinder hir fleeing.
Wherefore, it shall be in this case very necessarie, as soone as it happeneth, to looke and vewe the wing well, whither there be any bloude, muche or little, in the quill that is broosed, in maner aforesayde: which if be so, it shal be nedefull to pierce it with a sharpe needle, or such like instrumente, to gyue the bloude yssewe, before suche time as it bee congealed and waxen harde.
And after that, to annoynte the broose (and especially, where the blacke bloude is) with olde larde, and restie Bacon.
Moreouer, it shall be very good to cease the payne, to poure vppon the hurte place, three or foure droppes of good Oyle of Roses, somewhat hotte, whiche hauing vsed for the space of three or foure dayes, it shall not bee amisse, to bathe it with Aqua vitae, to drye and resolue it.
If you vse this meane in the beginning, when the hurt is firste taken, no doubt, it wyll breede resolution.
But if by negligence or otherwise, it be foreslacked at first, so as the broosed Sarcell, or other feather growe oute of order, and crosse the nexte feather to it in fleeing, and by that meane bee a hinderance to the Hawke, and a payne, it shall be good to cutte it off in the quill.
And to the ende there may growe another second feather in the place of that, whiche is so spoyled and cutte off, it shalbe well done, to make the quill to droppe away.
To bring that to passe, firste of all wipe wel the bloude congealed and corrupted within the place, and after that, fill it with Aqua vitae, of the beste that may bee gotten, and deale so artificially, as the Aqua vitae may staye, and not droppe out of the place.
Which muste be done, by stopping the hole with waxe, or such like deuise.
This Aqua vitae, by meane of the heat of it, will cause the quill to fal away within eight dayes, or little more, by meane whereof there may shoote oute a newe feather.
The way and manner, howe to ympe a Havvkes feather, hovvsoeuer it be broken or broosed.
SOmetymes it so falleth oute, that the feathers of a hawkes wing, or trayne, bee broken, wherevppon it is bothe necessarie and needefull, to sette other lyke in theyr steades.
Whiche feare, wee terme, the ymping of a hawkes feather.
This may be done in foure seueral manners and fashions, after that the feather is broken.
For firste, in the greater and huger sorte of hawkes, if a feather bee broken one fingers breadth, or thereaboutes, within the quill, then your nexte remedie is, to sheare it off with a payre of Syssers, or sheares, to the ende it may not cleeue or ryue any further.
Then hauing prepared a like feather to the same, of some other Hawke or fowle, resembling the broken feather: you muste cutte the quyll of it, and so force it togyther, as it maye enter the broken quyll of the Hawkes feather, annoynting it before you thruste it in, or seeme to place it for good and all, in the gummie fatte of a fygge, the yolcke of an egge, or some kinde of Semonde made of purpose, thrusting it very directly into the truncke and quill of the broken feather, and as wee maye terme it, graffing the one in the other.
And to the ende it maye haue the better holde, and the faster staye, it shall not bee amysse, to ciynte, or nayle them faste togyther, with the poynte of a Partridge feather, taking the very toppe of it, and strypping awaye the feathers on eyther syde the webbe: and after that, making a small hole with a slender needle, so as it passe through bothe the quilles, as well that whiche stycketh faste in the hawkes wing, as the other borowed and adopted feather, drawing through the hole made with the needle, the poynte of the Partridges feather, to fyll vp the hole agayne.
Whiche done, cut it off close by the webbe finely on eyther side, and so will it stande very handsomely, faste, and almost not to be discerned, but to be the hawkes naturall feather.
But if a Sarcell, a Flagge, or a Trayne feather bee broken, or slyued amydde the quyll, so as another feather ymped in him after the manner aforesayde, can well take no holde, or stande sure: Then shall it bee necessarie to take a Iunyper sticke, or suche like drye tymber, and thereof to make a small sharpe pegge, so as it may enter the quyll, whiche done, dyppe the one ende of it in Glewe, Semonde, or the slyme of the fishe, whome my Author termeth a Colpisce, the Germaines a Leymefische, (a fishe, as Gesnerus reporteth, so softe and tender, as beeyng sodde, or fryed, he falleth all to a gellie, or glewe, for whiche cause hee is detested greately, and bannished all mens tables.)
He is headded like an Ape, and for that occasion (called of diuers, Marmotum, as we may interprete it, a Marmoset, or an Ape.)
In the slyme (I saye) of this fishe, dyppe your Iuniper sticke thrusting it into the broken quill, reme~bring to place it so aptly, as it may be without the quill, of iust size to answere ye length of ye feather when it was sound vnbroken.
Then do put ye other end likewise in the glew, or Semond, co~ueying it by force into ye quil of the fether which you haue gotten, so close as the one quill touche the other directly.
After all this, fasten clynte both ye quils to ye Iuniper pegge, wt a Partridge his feather, as before.
And if it were so, as the quill were slyued or rente, pierce it through with a needle and threede, and with the threed bind it harde to the sticke, on both sides the quil, and it will hold very faste, and serue the hawkes turne in hir flight in steade of a naturall feather.
If a sarcell, or other feathers be broken aboue the quyll, towards the poynt of ye fethers twoo or three fingers bredth, you must cut it off with a sharpe penknife, aslope, and (as they say) a swashe, then take another like feather to the same, cutting it in like maner, as you did the other, so as it may fitte with ye same feather, both for length and cutte.
Which done, with an ymping needle sayde in Vyneger and salte, so close them togither, as they may be thought to be one feather.
The laste maner of ymping is, when a feather is not quyte broken off, but broosed, and (as it were) but markte, so as it can not bee holpen and righted agayne with warme water.
In this case it shall be better, rather to cutte awaye the feathers, onely to cutte the nether parte of the webbe, iuste ouer agaynst the broosed place, leauing the vpper parte whole and vntouchte: then to take a long slender needle, like a Glouers needle, and to threede it, and hauing so done, to thruste the eye of the needle beeing threeded, into the greater parte of the feather towardes the quyll, forcing the poynte of it so hard with a thymbell, as it may bee cleane hydde in the feather, and no parte of it to bee seene.
After that, ioyning bothe sides of the broosed feather togyther, where you cutte the webbe, drawe the threede as harde and as streyghte as you can possible, so as the poynte of the needle, by pulling of the threede that hangeth out, may so farre enter the vpper parte of the feather, as it maye bee halfe on the quyll side, and the other halfe on the poynt of the broosed feather, which wil strengthen the feathers maruelously.
This done, cutte off the threede, which was for none other purpose put there, but to draw the point of the needle backe into the vpper parte of the feather.
Hovv to ympe the trayne of a havvke, beeing all broken, and neuer a feather whole or sound.
MAnye tymes it so fortunes, as the trayne of a hawke is quite spoyled, and no one feather lefte to serue the turne.
Wherefore it shall be necessarie in this case, to set your hawke a newe trayne, which is done after this manner.
You muste take a peece of paper as bygge as your hande, in the myddle whereof you muste slytte a hole, through which conuey the hawkes trayne being broken, vp to the very rumpe of hir, drawing backe throughe the sayde slytte of the paper, all the brayles and smal fethers of the trayne that grow about the hawkes tewell, both aboue and beneath, so as there appere none at all, but the long feathers, vppon whiche you meane to woorke your feate.
Then cutte off those long trayne feathers wt a fine penknife, beginning fro~ the first, second, third, fourth, fifte, and so on the other side of the trayne in like manner, and you must cut them off aslope, sidewayes, towards the toppe of the truncke or quill, vntill you come to the twoo couert feathers, which twoo you must cut directly, not sloping, as you did ye rest.
So as when you haue done, the trayne of ye hawke may be in shape like the pypes of a payre of Organes.
Then take the trayne of a mewed Iay, (if it be possible, bicause they are the fayrest feathers beeing mewed) setting in euery quyll of the hawkes trayne, one feather of the Iaye, orderly, the first feather of the Iaye, in the firste quill of the Sparowhawke, and so consequently.
And if the Iayes feather will not enter the hawkes quill, then muste you cutte it a little, and broosing it with your finger, force it into the cutte quill, anoynting the ende of the borowed feather in the fatte of a sigge, the yolcke of an egge, or suche like stuffe, and so placing it right and directly with the hawkes feather.
Hauing set one feather in this order aforesayde, on the one side of the hawkes trayne, passe ouer to the other firste feather of the other side, and do in lyke manner, alwayes placing and ymping them so, as in length, and eache condition else, they may agree fully with the naturall feather of the hawke: and so from one to the other, vntill you come to the twoo couert feathers, whiche you muste sette laste of all the rest, and those in so good order, as your eye may iudge them to be excellently ymped by the iuste lengthe syze of them.
After all this, take awaye your paper, and with a knife wette in a little spittell, go ouer all the ymped feathers, putting ye knife betwixte euery quyll, close by ye rump of your hawke, and so go along the feather, to cut away all such small feathers, as shall be out of order, by meane of the ymping and cutting of the feather in the trayne of your hawke.
Whiche done feather by feather, set your hawke firste on your fiste, and so after a space on the perche, that she may tricke hir selfe, and right and enoyle hir feathers with hir beake.
Here will not omitte to remember euery good Falconer, that he haue in his house, and in a readinesse about him at all tymes, his ymping needles, and suche like necessarie implementes, to serue the turne withall, and to lende his companions, if they neede.
For it shall redounde to his credit greatly, and by meanes thereof he shall be accompted a gallant Gentleman, and a good fellowe.
Now in myne owne opinio~, haue discoursed sufficientlye of all diseases, made you priuie to the Italians order of phisicking his hawke, whiche can very well commende, as greatly agreable to reason.
Yet neuerthelesse in this last part, you shall for your greater store of remedies, and better knowledge, haue the Frenche Falconers manner of dealing wt their hawkes set downe.
But before do that, will write somewhat to instruct you howe to prepare your Mummie, a very necessary thing to be learned, and withoute the whiche you oughte to bee at no time, if you meane to kepe hawkes, and to haue them in good order and tune.
The waye and meane to prepare Mummie for Falcons, and other birds of praye, and when and howe it oughte to be gyuen.
SYthence that in these receytes for hawkes diseased sicke, haue diuers times made mention of Mummy, and of other medicines appropriate and peculiar to sundrie griefes, here thinke it not amisse, to laye downe the meane, how to prepare it for the vse and benefite of all Falconers, that shall haue occasion to imploye it to any sicke hawke: For that in cure of a broose, take it to be the most ready and exquisite way to recouer the hurte hawke againe.
First, you must take Nutmegges, in number four, Cloues, Ginger, Cynamon, of eyther halfe an ownce, Saffron one dramme, reducing all these to fine pouder.
Boyle them in an earthen potte well glazed, couered close with a reasonable quantity of good Malmesie, to the co~sumption of a third part: then take Mummie three ownces, or foure, or so much as shall content you, beating it to pouder, and putting it into a lynnen cloth, so bounde, as it may by no meanes ifsew out of ye same.
Hang it so by a string fastned to a sticke, as it may not reache the bottom of the pot, but as it may be infused in ye very middle of the Malmesie, which you must cause to boyle againe at a soft fire, so long vntil there be a co~sumption of another thirde part.
Which done, take it from ye fire, let ye Mummie, being so bounde in ye lyne~ cloth, rest for ye space of four or fiue hours, to the ende the vertue of those pouders may pierce and enter the Mummie, which by this meane will become very perfect.
And hauing done al this, kepe the Mu~mie out of the sunne winde in ye shade, in the self same cloth wherin it was infused, vntil it be perfectly drye againe, and the vse it in pouder at your nede, eyther strewing it vpon your hawkes meate, or gyuing it in casting of Cotton, as haue taught you before.
There is a kind of pill or past, deuised by that noble Gentleman, Hierom Cornarus of famous memorie, for sicke Falcons which haue lost their appetite, and day by day become megre and lowe, making a blacke mewte, of full of flesh vndigested, which is prepared in this maner following.
Take Saffron, Agaricke, Cubebes, Frankinsense, Rewe, Cloues, Cinamom, fine Aloes, of eyther two scruples, two Nutmegs, choyce Mummy, Rewbarbe of the best, of eyther one dramme, and the fifte parte of the marrowe of a Beefe, or Veale, as muche as will suffise to make a mixture of these powders aforesaid: of al whiche you must make a pill or paste, giuing thereof to the huger sorte of Hawkes as muche as a Beane in a pill, in manner aforesayd.
This is a very good receyte, but not so good as this vnderwritte~, which is deuised by Messer Manoli the Falconer to the renowmed Signor Bartelmewe Aluiano, and practised vppon his Falcons, being sicke, and ill affected in their gorges.
He was wont to take Triacle, Hiera Pigra, Cassea Lignea, Cloues, Cinamom, Aloes, Galenga, Agaricke of the best, Sirup of Roses, confection of Hamech, Diacatholicon, Benedicta, of eyther one scruple, choyse Rewbarbe, Mummy washt and purified, of each two scruples, of Nutmegge three drammes, beating to powder those thinges that are to be beaten in powder, and incorporating all with honie of Roses, making thereof a pill or paste, which he would keepe to serue his turne at neede, whereof he would giue his huger Hawkes the quantitie of halfe a Beane, and to lesser Hawkes, a lesser quantitie, in forme of a pill, beeing emptie both in gorge and pannell.
And truely, this would worke a maruelous effect vpon his sicke Hawkes: and if you vse the same, no doubt you shall find greate pleasure in it.
Of the cauterising instruments and tooles, vvherevvith Falconers do seare their Havvkes in desperate cures, when nothing else vvill serue the turne but fire, the last refuge of all others.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of instruments and tools] HAuing sundrie times in my collection of Falconrie, spoken of cawterie, to be bestowed vpon Hawkes, according to the diuersitie of their diseases and hurts, it shall be very needefull for me here in the later ende of my third booke, to set down the proportion and shape of the yrons, which are proper to yt matter, and maner of cure, being a very necessary thing for euery good Falconer to haue those yrons about him continually to serue his turne.
Wherefore say, that the cawterising yrons, are made in foure maners, and beare foure seuerall kinds of shapes, as by their peculiar pictures and portraitures may be seene.
A] Wherof ye first assigned to this charact doth serue to cauterise ye hed of a hauke, bicause it is round, somewhat playne on the toppe.
B] The second, signed with the letter shall seerue to cawterise ye nares, without danger or hurt to ye little stert yt groweth vp in the midle of the nares, for that it is round, and hollow at the toppe.
C] The third, which is is a cawterising button to burne or seare the head of a Hawke, and with that other deuice on the backe side, to cut the skin vnder the nares if neede be.
D] The last, signed with the character is often times vsed to cawterise and enlarge the nares of a Hawke, therefore is made so small sharp at the poynt, ye better to enter ye nares.
Of these tooles and instrumentes, it behoues you to haue larger, and lesser, according to the varietie and proportion of your Hawkes, for that ye Falcon and Goshawkes head being more huge than the Sparowhawkes, it shall not bee good, nor co~uenient to cawterise the~ all wt one selfe yron, of one bignes, but to shift your toole, according to the qualitie of the Hawke.
Ouer and besides all these tooles aforesaid, a Falconer must haue his paire of kniues, one streight poynted, the other bending at the toppe, a splatter, his coping yrons, a payre of Sizers, and a Surgeons instrument, to serue his vse in all diseases of a Hawke, about hir beake and pownces.
Thus muche accompt sufficient as touching Hawkes, birds of pray, so as now there remayneth nothing more, but the French Falconers opinion of diseases and cures, and lastly, one small treatise and very necessary discourse, as touching the diseases that happen to Spanells, with the cure of the sayd mischiefes, which shall be the very last part of all this collection of Falconrie.
Though like the Italian Gentleman very well, for hys singular skill and iudgement in Falconrie, yet neuerthelesse, bycause find sundry things very good and necessarie in the French practisioners, which maye stande you in stead, (as well for manning lewring, as also curing your diseased haukes) for whose only benefite vndertoke the collection of this my booke.
And partly, for that the French Gentleman shall not growe iealous of mee, that skorne his skill, in regard of the learned and delicate Italian, waying them both indifferently, if find them both to deserue like due commendation and praise: haue heere offered to your viewe and iudgementes sundrie French mens opinions, and inuentions, as touching this Arte of Falconrie, crauing you to iudge the best, both of them and me: of them your neighbours for their first inuentions: and of me youre countrie man, for my late collection: whose paynes bestowed heerein, shall be nothing but a pleasure, if may find my selfe guerdoned with good liking and deserued thankes from you.
And so committe you ouer to the discourse it selfe, withoute anye farther circumstaunce or protestation.
How to keepe and mayntayne all manner of Hawkes in health, good plight and liking.
TO keepe Falcons and all maner of birds of pray in health, the chiefe Falconers saye, yt they must neuer haue a great gorge gyue~ the~, specially of grosse meates, as Beefe, Porke, such other yt are hard to be put ouer and endewed.
Moreouer you must beware in any wise that ye feede them not with the flesh of any beast that hath lately gone to rutte, for yt will kill them, and yee shall not perceiue how.
fynde by experience, that the giuing of great gorges, and the feeding of them with such sorts of fleshe, (specially colde,) dothe destroy and surfit moe Hawkes than all other mischaunces that can happen to them.
And therefore warne all Falconers to beware howe they ouergorge their Hawkes: and if they be driuen to feede them with grosse flesh for want of better, let it be well soaked in cleane water, and afterward sufficiently well wroong.
It must be done in Sommer with colde water, and in Winter with suke warme water, and it must not be wroong too muche with the hande: for the massinesse of the fleshe, and the loocenesse of the water, will cause them to put ouer and to indew the sooner and more spedily.
And it will cause them to haue the larger panels, whereby they shall the better scowre themselues downeward of the glitte, and grosse humors.
And thys is to be vnderstoode of all grosse fleshe wherewith yee shall be fayne sometimes to feede your Hawkes: but not of any other feeding that is light and of good digestion.
For yee must haue discretion to reward your Hawke now and then with some good liue and warme meate, or else shee maye bee brought too lowe.
Neuerthelesse the seruing of your Hawkes with washt meate (as is sayde before) is the way to keepe them in healthe.
Of Aloes Cicotrina, wherewith you must make scowrings for youre Hawkes.
Tell you further, that to maintayne youre Hawkes in good plight, to keepe them from all diseases, you must euery fifteene days, giue the~ ye mountena~ce of a beane of Aloes Cicotrine, which must bee put into them, wrapped vp in a little of the flesh, or of the skinne of a Henne, to the intent that the taste of the Aloes which is very bitter, be not felt of them.
And whe~ your Hawke hath swallowed it downe, beare hir vpon youre fiste, the better to cause hir to keepe that whiche is giuen hir, which done, let hir afterward cast vp the water slime whyche she hath in hir body: and take vp the rest of the Aloes againe which she hath cast, and let it not be lost, for it is good and will serue for another time.
Then set your Hawke in the Sunne or against the fire hooded, and feede hir not till two houres after, at whiche time you shall giue hir a reasonable gorge of some liue birde or fowle.
And the said medicine must be giuen in the morning after that the Hawke hath cast.
Of common pilles that are giuen to Hawkes for laxatiue medicines or downewarde scowrings.
NEuerthelesse in stead of the sayd Aloes, ye may at youre discretion vse common pilles, suche as Potecaries giue men to make them loosebodyed.
And many are of opinio~, that they be much better tha~ that other of Aloes: for the pilles driue downeward and scowre more strongly and with greater effect.
Yet notwithstanding, ye may vse eyther of those two, making the~ at your pleasure.
Of the said pilles you shall giue your Hawke one or two, after as the quantitie of them is, and when she hath taken them, set hir by a fire, or in the Sunne, and feede hir not for the space of two houres after, at whyche time ye shall giue hir some quicke and liue thing to feede vppon: For the taking of the pilles will set all hir body out of temper and tune.
And so ye shall keepe your Hawkes in good plight, state and health.
TAke Aloes Cicotrine, and graines of Filander, otherwise called Stauesaker, and Cassia Fistula, as much of the one as of the other, to the mountenance of a beane, togither, whe~ ye haue beaten it into powder put it into a Hennes gut of an inch long, tied fast at both ends: then conuey it into hir in the morning, so as she may put it ouer, and that must be after shee hath cast, if she had any casting at al.
Then set your Hauke by the fire or in the Sunne, and feede hir with a quicke chicken, or some other liue warme meate two houres after, as is said afore: and so your Hawkes shall be kepte in good plight state.
And it is to be noted that you must not giue so muche to a Goshawke, for they be not of so strong and churlish nature and mettell as other Hawkes are: much lesse to a Sparowhawke, bycause she is not able to brooke so strong a medicine, as the Goshawke is.
And therefore you must beare in mynde that your giuing of the said things to your Hawkes must bee according to their natures and strengths, by the good discretion of suche as through their noble disposition doe place their care, pleasure, and minds, vpon such things.
To make a Hawke cast when she keepeth it too long.
FOrasmuch as Hawkes do sometimes keepe their casting too long and cannot put it vp: or else it may now and then fall out that a man knoweth not whether they haue any casting or no: in such cases, you must giue your Hawke a little Aloes, and then she will cast it togither with the slime and filth that hindred the casting of it.
And for want of Aloes, giue hir the mountenance of a beane of the roote of Celendine in two or three pellets, and it will ease hir out of ha~d.
And to further the matter, it shall not be amisse to giue hir one spoonefull of water, wherin the Celendine rootes haue bin stieped some space: for the bitternesse thereof will force hir to cast.
IF you mind to keepe your Hawkes in tune and state to flee well, you must make them bath oftentimes, and you muste set water by the~, though they list not to bathe.
For somtimes a Hawke is desirous to bowze and take of the water by reason of some chaunce, or for some heate of hir body, or of hir liuer: and then is water good and auaylable to set hir agayne in good plight and health: whiche thing you shall lightly perciue by that, that the Hawke will make countenaunce of more cheare and reioyce more.
When your Hawke is bathed (whether it bee Goshawke or Falcon,) lette hir be throughly well wetherd at the fire of in the Sunne.
And if shee happen to bee washed, or sowst with raine, or otherwise, let hir be throughly weatherd as is said afore, least she surfet by cold, specially whe~ she commes from the field and from hir fleeing.
For then is she co~monly marrde for lacke of good order, and looking too, in somuch that therevpon insew the Pantas, and other diseases.
And therefore when the Falconer perceyueth the tyme to be daungerous for his Hawke to take such maner of colde, as in winter time after hir flight, or by taking wet in flying: he must first weather hir well at the fire or in the Sunne, and then giue hir fiue cloues of Maces in hir casting, and that wil heate hir againe.
To keepe Hawkes from inconueniences which they take of themselues, or which happen to them vnwares.
FVrthermore, to preserue Hawkes from mischiefes whyche they take lightly by cold or otherwise: when ye haue bathed and wetherd them, beware of setting them in cold and moyst places, but choose some warme and drie place, and with some clothe roll the pearch or billet that they stand on.
For diuers times when Hawkes haue beaten and broosed them selues at the encounter, with great toyle in the field or at the riuer, they be so tyred, and take cold so lightly, and do so chafe their feete, that if ye should set them downe in that plight, vpon a stande of stone or wood, their legges and feete would swell, by reason of the humors that would fall down and distill from ye higher parts, and by that meane breede gowtes, as happeneth in me~ by like disorder.
For suche diseases light not to men nor yet to Hawkes, but for want of good heede and looking too whe~ they haue distempered themselues by anye immoderate exercise.
When such diseases light vpon poore Birdes, they be hard to be cured, vnlesse a man haue very good skill to order them, and to prouide remedie for them.
How men should make their Hawkes to tire euery day.
Say further, that the good Falconers and suche as haue a care to vse theyr Hawkes well, and to keepe them in health, must make them to tire towardes the euenings before they let them iouke.
When your Hawke hath put ouer and indued, afterward in giuing hir casting, you may well at youre discretion gyue hir (if you list) a little Aloes Cicotrine in hir casting, or else some commo~ pill, and that doth greatly scowre the head, and doe hir much good.
And that must be done eyther once a weeke, or twice in three weekes: and the sayd medicine is giue~ diuers times by such as like not to giue their Hawkes tiring.
Neuerthelesse say that tiring in the morning after the Hawke hath cast, is very good.
And if the tyring be of plumage, keepe hir from eating of feathers (as well as you may) for feare least she take casting before the euening: for towards night it is no daunger, for then of common course shee is to haue casting.
Let hir tire against the Sunne, snyting and sewing hir beake a little at your discretion, after as you find your Hawke lowe and poore, vntill you intend to go to your pastime.
haue knowen many Falconers that neuer make their Hawkes to tire, saying that it is but a custome, and needelesse: but say the contrary.
For inasmuche as the Hawke is exercised by reasonable tyring, shee becommeth the helthyer and the lighter both of body and of head, by all moderate exercises, yea and she is the better in state also as you may perceyue.
And beleeue that the opinion of such as saye so, proceedeth of nothing but of slouth and of small loue whych they haue to their Hawkes.
Therfore forget not to make your Hawke to tyre against the Sunne in the morning: for it riddeth them the better of the watry humors that descend out of their heads, if either before the doing of it or after, you set them vpon a pearch against the Sunne, that they may tricke and enoyle themselues at their pleasure.
This done, ye may sette them in their accustomed places.
And bicause some Falconers are so slouthfull (as is sayd afore) that they will not make their Hawkes to tire, and othersome haue not leysure always to do it: in stead of tyring, will giue them a remedie that followeth to ease them of their watery humors which they haue in their heads for want of tiring.
Take Agarike beaten into powder, and Ierapigra, with a little Saffron, and make a pill of it as bigge as a beane, and put a third part lesse of Ierapigra than of Agaricke to binde your pouder togither.
Let that pill so made be put into hir wrapped in Cotton, towards euening when she hath indued hir gorge and is emptie, making hir to receyue it three or foure dayes togither.
And you may vse this medicine from mooneth to mooneth at youre discresion: And by the opinion of all Falconers, ye may giue this pill for all vnknowen and hidden diseases, for which you know none other remedie.
Another receyt to keepe and mayntaine youre Hawkes in good healthe.
IF you intend to keepe and maintayne your Falcons and all other Hawkes in health, take Germander, Pelamountayne, Basill, Grimelsede, and Broome flowres, of each of them halfe an ownce: of sop, of Saxifrage, of Polepodie, and of Horsemintes, of eache of them a quarter of an ownce: of Nutmegges, a quarter of an ownce: of Cucubes, Borage, Mu~my, Mogewort, Sage, of the four kinds of Miraholans, Indorum, Kebulorum, Beliricorum, and Embelicorum, of eache of them halfe an ownce: of Saffron an ownce, and of Aloes Cicotrine the fifth part of an ownce.
All these things confect to a powder, and at euery eygth day or at euery twelfth day giue your Hawkes the quantitie of a beane of it with their meate.
And if they will not take it so, put it in a Hennes gutte tied at both ends, or else after some other meanes, so as ye cause them to receiue it downe.
And if they cast vp the fleshe againe by force of the powder, let it no more be giuen them with fleshe, but in the foresayd maner of the gutte, and lette them stand emptie one houre after.
And according as you see your Hawke disposed, make hir to vse this medicine, to skowre hir of the euill humors that are in hir body, bred of feeding vpon naughty flesh, which ingendreth suche humors and causeth many diseases in Hawkes.
That the diseases whiche Hawkes haue in their heads, do commonly come of giuing them too great gorges, and of foule feeding: the meane of knowe it.
THe chiefe Falconers saye and agree, that the diseases in Hawkes heads do most commonly breede of giuing them too great gorges, especially of grosse and ill flesh.
For when a Hawke hath too full a gorge, she cannot well put it ouer and indue it, wherevpon it falleth to corrupting and stincking in hir gorge by lying too long there, and speciallye, more in a Hawke that is lowe and poore than in one that is high, and full of flesh, insomuch that she is forced to cast it all stincking.
And if she happen to put it ouer so stincking, it atteynteth and rotteth hir panell, by meanes whereof the fume and stinch ascend vp to hir head, and there close and stuffe vp hir eares, and the passages of hir pipes and head, so as the humors whiche were wonte, cannot passe away as they were accustomed, by reason whereof the head swelleth inordinately.
For the humor seeketh issue and vent eyther at the eares, or at the nares, or at the throte: for wante whereof the Hawke falles in daunger of death if shee haue not speedy remedie.
And to discerne this disease of the head, the Hawke will sniffe often, and shet hir eyes towards night, and sometimes shet eft the one and eft the other eye, and make as though she iowked with woorse cheere than shee was wont to doe: and then must you beware that shee swell not betweene the eye and the beake.
And if she do, then cauterize hir in that maner that is set downe hereafter.
Whensoeuer the humor makes a shew to sew out at the Hawkes eares, at hir nares, or at hir throte, then is shee in perill of deathe, if shee bee not holpen presently.
YOu muste take the larde of Bakon that is not restie, nor ouer olde, and of the fattest of it make slyces, as it were to larde Partridges, and suche small birds, and let them steepe in freshe colde water a whole night, chaunging the water three or foure tymes.
Then take the marowe of beefe well picked, and suger once boyled and clarified, and of those three things being eche of like qua~titie, with the quantitie of a lyttle beane of Saffron in powder, well mingled togither, make pilles of the bignesse of a beane, and giue them to your hawke, causing some body to caste hir, and opening hir beake by force, if shee will not take them otherwise.
This done, set hir by the fyre, or in the Sunne, and anone ye shall see howe she will skowre and slyse by casting vpwarde and downwarde the grosse humors wherwith hir bodie is ouercharged.
And when she hath muted well three or foure tymes, let hir be taken from the fire, or out of the Sunne, and set vpon hir pearche in hir accustomed place, and let hir not be fedde till twoo howers after, and then allowe hir of a chicken or mutton but halfe a gorge.
Let hir be thus dealt withall three dayes togither, making hir to tyre euery day agaynst the sunne both morning and euening.
And foure fiue or sixe days after, giue hir euery day a cloue of Mace in hir casting, and she shall recouer.
When the three dayes are paste, wherin you haue so scowred hir, take a little pepper beaten into very fine powlder, and mingling it with vineger in a sawcer, open hir beake, and rubbe the roofe of hir chappe therewith, and likewise put a droppe or twayne of it into hir nares, and set hir by the fire or in the Sunne, and you shall see how mightily it will open hir head.
Howbeit you must not giue this medicine to a Hawke that is very poore, for she will not bee able to brooke it.
And within an houre or two after, feede hir with a chickens leg: and after let hir haue twice a day at hir houres a reasonable gorge, and let the sayde powlder be giuen hir no more but once.
In stead of this powlder, some giue thys medicine following, whyche you maye gyue also if you thinke good: that is to witte, a little Stauesacre, howbeit that it is very strong, if there be not skill vsed to delay the strength of it.
Wherefore if you mynde to giue your Hawke of it, giue hir not past three or foure graynes of it wrapt in a cloth or in lint, whiche you must breake afterwarde and beate into powlder.
Then take a little cleane water in a dishe, and put your powlder in it, and mingling it togither in manner of a Sirop, put three or foure droppes of it into your Hawkes nares, and sette hir in the Sunne or by the fire as is sayd afore, if it be colde.
That done, then by Martins aduice take pitche if you will, to the mountenance of a beane, whyche you must warme betwixt youre handes, and afterwarde cleane it to the roofe of hir beake, rubbing it ouer with a little of the powlder of Stauesacre and Pepper, till shee feele the pitche well vppon hir Palate: and by and by in laboring to shake off the sayde pitche and water from hir Palate, shee will cast: and let hir cast hir fill till shee bee throughly scowred.
And when yee thinke shee is scowred sufficiently, take away the sayd pitche if it bee not falne off already, and set your Hawke to the fire, or in the Sunne as is sayd in the medicine of the Pepper, and feede hir with some good meate one houre after.
And to recomfort youre Hawke after all these medicines, yee maye giue hir foure or fyue Cloues of Mace as is sayde afore, after as the bignesse of them is, whyche you must firste brooze a little, and put into hir casting.
For the Cloues so giuen are singularly good for Hawkes against all Rheumes and humors of the head, so that it maketh them to haue a good breath and keepeth it from stincking, by setting theyr whole bodies in a temperate heate.
And the Cloues being so gyuen euery eight daye, is ynough to keepe a Hawke from all rhewmatike diseases of the head, and from all other diseases that come of cold.
NOw that haue spoken of the disease of the head whyche commeth oftentimes of gyuing too greate a gorge or of fowle feeding, will speake of the Rhewme or pose whyche breedeth of the coldnesse of the brayne, and vpper parte of the head.
The Hawkes that haue this disease, indure suche payne as they cannot holde open their eyes.
And of this disease spring many other griefes, as the pinne and the webbe in the eye, whereby they lose theyr syght: and sometimes they lose their syght withoute hauing the pinne and webbe in theyr eyes.
Besides that, there followeth the hawe in their eyes as in the eyes of a Horse, and sometimes also the pip in their tungs, and another disease whiche is called the Efforcyllons in the Frenche tong (I knowe not what Englishe tearme to bestowe vppon it.)
And moreouer the swelling of the roofe of their pallate whyche is called the Vuila, an ill disease, whereof breedeth the Cancre.
All these diseases are very daungerous and put Hawkes in great hazard, if there be not skill to remedie them betimes.
And Master Amé Cassyan sayth that suche diseases breede of flewme whiche is in the bodies of Hawkes, as sayd afore of the other Rhewme: and that fleume commeth of setting them in moyst and colde places.
Also sometyme it commeth of bringing them home colde and wet out of the fieldes, and of setting them downe vppon their pearches withoute drying or warming them at the fire or in the Sunne.
The remedie of those diseases is first and formost to cawterise them in manner following.
Fashion a little yron with a rounde heade like a peaze, (whiche is called a button) and make it in manner redde whote in the fire, but yet not ouerwhote: (for yron is very violent if it be too much het.) Cauterise hir therewith on the toppe of hir head, bycause the griefe and disease is there grounded.
Cause your Hawke to be well cast, that you maye cawterize hir at youre ease, and pleasure, for you must beware of burning hir too deepe, and therefore that ye may be sure to do it well, mayle your Hawke fast, and pull off a fewe of hir feathers.
Assoone as you haue done so, take another yron with a poynte as sharpe as the tooth of a combe, and put it in the fire as afore sayde, and therewith pierce hir nares in ye middes.
The~ two or three days after, take another flat yron of a finger broad, heate likewise red whote, and cauterise your Hawke againe therewith handsomly as it were betweene the eye lid and the horne of the beake, and do it with the sharper side of the yron: not that the yron ought indeede to haue any edge, but rather by all reason to be blunt.
And take good heede that the fire touch nother the ball of hir eye nor hir nares, and therefore see that ye gard hir eye with a wet cloute to keepe it from the smoke.
All such maner of fires must be giuen towards the euening, before Hawkes are supped, when they are emptie, for otherwise ye handling of them would make them cast their gorges.
When all is done as it should be, halfe gorge your Hawke, or somewhat lesse with warme meate.
And the same daye make prouision of suche Snayles as are among vines, or among Fenill, and suche as haue gray shelles, they are the best, for men are wont to eate of them.
Steepe fyue or sixe of them in the milke of an Asse, or of a Gote, or else (for want of that) in womans milke, and let it be done in a good large glasse well couered, that they creepe not out.
The next morning breake the shelles, and wash them in newe milke as it commeth from the Cowe: then giue foure or fiue of those Snayles to your Hawke, after that they bee of bignesse.
And assoone as that is done, set hir against a fire or the Sunne, and remoue hir not away till she haue muted four or fiue times.
And if she can abide the heate well, let hir alone still, for it doth hir much good.
After noone fede hir wt a Hennes legge or with some small birds, or with a Ratte or a Mouse, whiche are best of all, and then set hir in a warme place and giue hir not too great a gorge.
When euening commes, that she hath indued put ouer hir meate, take fiue or sixe Cloues of Mace, broken asunder, and wrapped in a peece of flesh or a pellet of cotton, and make hir to receyue it by fayre meanes, or fowle, by opening hir beake, and conueying it into hir.
Continue this medicine foure or fiue dayes, and your Hawke shall recouer.
Afterward make hir to tire euening and morning and let hir feeding be styped in milke as is sayde afore of the Snayles, for the milke scowreth hir body within, and is very nutritiue, and will quickly bring hir to be hie, and in fleshe agayne.
Another medicine that Mallopin giueth in stead of the other aforesayd.
TAke the powlder of Saffron and Camomill, of eache the mountenance of a little peaze, when ye haue mingled the~ togither, put thereto Larde that is neither restie, nor ouer salted, and steepe them a nyght and a day in three or foure changes of water, and then washe the Larde throughly in faire licoure.
That done, take Suger clarified, and the Maree of a Beefe.
Of the things aforesayde, take as muche of the one, as of the other, so as you may make fiue or sixe balles of the bignesse of a Beane.
Then myngle the sayde mixtures, and the powders togither, and euery morning gyue your hawke one of the balls, tyll all be spente: and as is sayde afore, sette your hawke by the fire, or in the Sunne, feede hir not by the space of an houre or twayne after: at which time you shall gyue hir either a Hennes legge, or some small birdes, or a Rat, or some Myce.
And in the morning, when she hath well indewed, giue hir foure or fiue cloues of Maces lapped in a little flesh, or in the skinne of a Henne, or in pellettes of Cotton.
And so may you cauterize hir before the sayde medicin, after the maner that haue shewed before in the former receyte of the Snayles, so you draw hir meate in Mylke, or in fresh butter.
For the disease of the eares, whiche commeth of the Rhewme and colde.
SOmetimes there happeneth another disease to hawkes, by reason of moysture of the heade, whiche is called the disease of the eares, bycause there yssue out certaine humors by them.
And ye shall know the disease by this, that the hawke will oft times wrythe hir heade backe, and maketh not so good cheare, as she shoulde do, and is more vnlustie.
Wherefore search and peruse hir eares, and you shall finde the disease there.
The remedie whereof, by Master Amé Cassians deuise, is this.
Take a little long yron, rounde at the ende as a peaze, and Oyle of sweete Almonds, or for lacke of that, Oyle of Roses, whiche is muche better, if you can come by it.
Then heat your yron in the fire, neyther glowing red, nor very hotte, and put it into the Oyle, and of that oyle so heat with the yron, droppe a little into your hawkes eares, putting the yron a little into them, that they be not stopped.
For then of suche inconuenience happeneth oftentymes the Canker to the brayne, which is incurable, killeth the hawke.
And beware of thrusting the yron to farre in, or of beeing too hotte, for else you may kill hir.
You must continue the ministring of this Oyle, foure or fiue daies, alwaies wiping away the humors gently, that yssewe out of hir eares, alwaies respecting hir casting, whither it be cleane or no.
And if you list to skowre hir with a common pyll or twaine, they wil ease hir heade maruelously well, and doe hir exceeding muche good: or if you do it with the sayde balles of Larde, Suger, and Marow of Beefe, it is good likewise, for you may vse eyther ye one or ye other at your pleasure.
Of the disease of the eylyddes, whiche commeth of the rewme and colde.
ANother disease happeneth to Hawkes, in the eyelyddes, whiche causeth a swelling vnder the the eylydde, betweene the eye the feare of ye beake (we haue no proper speach for it) if ye remedie it not betymes, it wyll swell rounde about: and thereof commeth the Hawe in the eye, whiche will ouergrow the eye, stoppe it.
And assure your selfe it is a signe of death, if it growe too long.
For haue seene many dye of it in my tyme, for lacke of remedie.
Now by Master Amé Cassyans opinion, the remedie is this.
Heate the little rounde yron that spake of afore, cauterize hir with it softly vpon hir heade, as is said for ye Rewme.
Likewise with ye other cutting yron seare hir betweene the eye the beake.
Also pierce hir nares with the lyttle yron, and afterwarde gyue hir the medicine of the Snayles, after the manner aforesayde, foure or fiue dayes togyther.
And for wante of that medicine, you maye vse the other, of Larde, Suger, and the Marow of Beefe mingled with the powder of Saffron and Camomill.
Of the Hawe in the eye, whiche commeth of moysture, and colde, and howe it happeneth.
MOreouer somtimes there growes a great disease in their eyes, which is named the Hawe, and commeth after the same manner that it commeth in horses: namely, sometyme by a blowe, or a stripe, sometyme by a disease in the heade, moste commonly by hurting of the eye with the streyghtnesse of the hoode, or by some other misfortune, which cannot sometimes be eschewed.
And you shall discerne the co~ming of this disease, by seeing a little filme growing vp from the bending of hir beake, and couering hir eye by little and little.
And this filme is somewhat blacke afore, and is called the Hawe, which putteth out the eye, if it once ouergrowe the ball of it.
To remedie the same, take a little needle yt is very sharpe poynted, and fine threeded with a silke threede, and therewith take vp the Hawe handsomely, and cut it with a little slicer, as do too horses, but beware that you cut it not too muche, for hurting of the eye, which you must washe with Rose water three dayes togither.
In these cures of diseases that grow in the eyes, there must be great care vsed, for feare of a greater mischiefe, bicause of the dayntinesse of the place.
Of a blowe giuen to the eye, or of some other mischaunce.
SOmetime the eyes of hawkes are hurt by some mishappe, some stripe, or otherwise, as sayde afore.
Against such vnlooked for mischaunces, Master Amé Cassyan giueth clere Fenell water, Rose water, as much of the one as of the other, therwith washeth ye eye twyce or thrice aday.
Master Malopin in his booke of the Prince, willeth to take the iuyce of Celondine, otherwise called, Herbe Arondell, or Swallowes herbe, to conuey it into the eye.
And if it be not to be had greene, to take it drye, and to beate it into pouder, and to blow it into hir eye with a quill, and this shall recure the hawke.
Of the Filme in the eye, which some call the Veroll, or the Pinne and webbe.
THere is another disease in the eye, called a Filme, whiche commeth sometimes of disease in the head, of Rhewmes that distill into the eyes, and sometimes of standing too long, or too close hooded, whiche hapneth through the fault and negligence of suche as haue the bearing and ouersight of them.
For the remedie heerof, Master Martin sayeth, that ye muste take Celondine, and bray it, putting thereto Hoonie and fresh butter, and of eche of those three gyue your hawke a like portion with a hotte gorge, and moreouer put the powder of Pepper and Aloes in hir eye.
Or else (as sayeth Master Amé Cassian you muste giue hir the foresayde medicine of Larde, Suger, and Marow of Beefe, three or four dayes togither, to skowre hir, setting hir by a fire, or in the Sunne, and feeding hir after it with some lyue fowle, and keeping hir out of the wind, from standing colde, or moyste.
After she is so skowred, if ye see that the webbe shewe it selfe muche, cauterize hir vpon the vpper part of hir head, and likewise a little betwene the eye and the beake, after the manner aforesayde.
When all this is done, squirte a little Rose water into hir eye, and if nede be, minister thereto the powder or the iuyce of Celondine, otherwise called Herbe Arondell, as is sayde afore.
This disease of the Pinne webbe, is of some men called the Veroll, for the remedying whereof, they burne the shell of a Tortoyse in a newe pot, and beate it into fine powder, whiche they serce through a fine cloth.
Then take they a Cockle of the sea, which is fashioned like a Hart, and burning it throughly in the fire, make it into fine powder, serce it likewise.
These three powders myxte togyther in equall portions, they vse to put into their hawkes eyes tyll they be whole.
Master Michelin telleth of one other receyte for the sayde disease, which is this.
Make a little hole in the top of an egge, and powre out the white of it: then coyle cleare Rose water, and Sanguis draconis, well togyther, and fill vp your egge with them, and stirre them throughly with a smal sticke.
Afterward wrappe vp your egge in paste, and stoppe vp the hole of it, that nothing get out: which done, set it so clozed in the fire, till the paste become blacke and redde at the taking it from the fire.
Then take out that which is within it, and beate it into pouder, and serce it through a fine cloth: and of that powder you may vse to put in your hawkes eye till it bee cured, washing hir eye now and then with water of Fenell, and of Roses.
Master Mallopin makes another medicine for the same disease, which is this.
Take the dung of a Lyzart, (which is called a Prouinciall) and beate it into powder, with Suger Ca~die, somewhat more in quantitie than the other, mingling the~ both togither.
He sayeth, that this powder is much better than all the others, whereof you may vse as is sayde afore, conueying into your hawkes eye water of Roses, and of Fenell.
For the disease that breedeth in hawkes beakes, commonly called Formica.
DIuers tymes there growes a disease vppon the horne of hawkes beakes, which eateth and fretteth the beake from the heade.
Master Amé sayeth, it is a woorme that eateth the horne of the beake within, by reason whereof the Hawke is in greate daunger, if shee bee not holpen in tyme.
Yee shall perceiue it by this, that the horn of the beake waxeth rugged, and the beake beginneth to ryue and cliue from hir head.
Take the gall of an Ore, (or of a Bull, whiche is better than of an Oxe) and alltoo beate it, and breake it in a dishe, and put thereto the powder of Aloes Cicotrine, and myngle them well togither.
Then noynte the horne of your hawkes clappe or beake therewith, and the very place where the Formica growes, twyce adaye.
But beware that you touche neyther hir eyes, nor hir nares.
And continewe your so doing, till she be throughly cured, and lette hir bee bathed with Orpiment Pepper, to kepe hir from vermine Mytes.
For the disease that breedeth in the Nares of Hawkes.
ANother disease bredeth in Hawkes nares, so as they swell exceedingly: and sometyme vppon the horne of the beake there ryseth a cruste, at ye remouing whereof the flesh is found to be raw vnderneath the clappe, insomuche that diuers times they loose ye one half of their beake.
Master Amé Cassian saith, yt the hawke hath smal Mites in hir heade, which creepe downe alo~gst hir beake, entring in at hir nares, do brede ye sayd disease: that ye hawke feeling them, being molested therwith, thrusteth hir talants into hir nares.
Or else it happeneth somtimes, that a cast of hawkes do buckle crab togither, therof breedeth the sayde disease.
Make little matches of paper, of the bygnesse of the tag of a poynt, let your hawke be cast handsomely, set your matches on fire with a candle, seare your hawke vpon the place swollen, taking good hede that you do it not too roughly.
Which being done, annoynt it the next morning with a little Hennes grease, and so will it heale well, hir beake and nares will not be stuft, but remaine open.
Neuerthelesse ye must be fayne sometimes to touche hir with an yron, which is more daungerous than the other.
The disease called the Frownce, whiche breedeth within hawkes beakes, and in their tongues.
THe Frownce proceedeth of moyst colde humors, which descend from the hawkes head to their palate, and ye roote of ye to~gue.
And of yt cold, is ingendred in ye tongue ye Frownce, otherwise called (of the French me~ ye Barbillons, or Sourchelons.
by meanes of which they loose their appetite, ca~not close their clap, whereof they oftentimes dye: that disease is named ye Eagles bane.
For as reported to you in ye first parte of this collection, the Eagle seldome when dyeth of age, but onely by meane hir beake doth ouergrowe, so as she ca~not feede gorge hir selfe.
Yee may perceiue this disease by losse of hir appetite to feede.
And to know it the better, open your hawkes beake, looke on hir tongue, whither it be swollen or no: And if there appere not that disease, open hir beake againe within a while after, see if there be any likelyhoode of it, and so may yee easily discrie the mischiefe.
For remedie wherof the sayde Master Mallopin sayeth, that you must take Oyle of swete Almondes, or Oyle Olyue washt in foure or fiue waters, and with that Oyle annoynt hir throte and hir tongue three or four times a day with a feather, for fiue or sixe dayes togither.
And if your hawke cannot feede, lette hir meate be cutte and shredde into very small pellets.
This done, open hir beake gently, and make hir to receyue it downe, by conueying a small stycke into hir throte, gyuing hir not paste halfe a gorge at a tyme, and that muste bee eyther of Mutton, or of some lyue fowle, Henne, Chicken, or suche lyke: fiue or sixe dayes after, open hir beake handsomely agayne, and with a payre of sharpe Sissers, cutte off the typpes of the Barbillons, till the bloude followe, but yet beware of cutting away too muche.
After this, annoynte and moysten wel hir throte with syrope of Mulberies, called of the Apothecaries Diamoron, and then annoynte hir with Oyle of sweete Almondes, or with Oyle Olyue, tyll she be recured.
Of the disease called by the Frenche men, Escorchillons, a kinde of frownce or Canker.
SOmetimes there happeneth a disease to hawkes, whiche is called the Escorchillons, a harde disease to bee discerned.
It breedeth commonly of a Rhewme, confirmed in the heade, from whence spring many other diseases, (whereof haue made mention in the Chapter of Rhewmes in the heade, and of the disease called (the Barbillons, whiche breedeth in Hawkes tongues,) as the Pyppe doth, the disease of the palate, and the Canker, which are very daungerous diseases and deadely.
If yee wyll knowe the Escorchillons, let your hawke be caste handsomely, and open hir beake, and force downe hir tongue with your fingers ende, so as you may see hir windepype, and a little beneath hir windepype yee shall finde the Escorchillons, lyke three or foure sharpe prickes growing one agaynste another, that sometymes the Hawke cannot caste, by meane thereof.
And that is a perfect waye to knowe this euyll.
Furthermore, in the same place, and on eyther syde of the windepype, yee shall finde twoo small stertes of deshe, whiche are naturall to all Hawkes.
But at the lower ende of them doe growe vp manie lyttle prickes, whiche are the cause that a Hawke can not well caste in the morning, insomuche that sometymes shee is fayne to caste hir casting by peecemele, and not whole.
And that is another assurance of the sayde disease, whiche maye bee well cured and remedied bothe togyther.
The remedie which Amé Cassyan gyueth for this disease, is sette foorthe in the former Chapter by Master Mallopin, where hee wylleth you to take Oyle of sweete Almondes, or Oyle Olyue, &c.
The disease of the Canker which breedeth in the throtes and tungs of Hawkes.
YE must vnderstande that the Canker breedeth of fowle feeding your Hawkes, not washing of their meate in colde water in Sommer, and in warme in Winter, whiche ingendreth in their guttes grosse slimy matter.
And when those humors come to be moued, they fume vp into the head, and (so distilling agayne) ingender heate of the lyuer, which breaketh out in the throte and the tung, and there ingender the Canker.
You shall discerne this disease by the feeding of your Hawke, for in taking hir meate she letteth it fall, and afterward hath much adoe to swallowe it.
Therefore let hir beake be anoynted, and you shall find the disease of the Canker.
Take Oyle of Almonds or Oyle Olife washed as is sayd afore, and anoynt well hir throte with it twice or thrice a day.
That done, giue hir the sayd medicine of Sugre, Lard, and marrowe of Beefe three dayes togither, and feede hir with Mutton or with Pullets or Hennes flesh dipped in the foresayd Oyle, but ye must not washe your Oyle of Almonds.
After this, you must behold and regard the Canker, and if you find it white, take a small yron made at the one ende lyke a Rasor, and at the other end edged and sharp.
And if hir tung be very much ouergrowen with the Canker, slit open it handsomly alongst the side of hir tung, and with your Raser scrape away the whitenes softly which you see there.
Then take a little Cotton or lint to drie and drinke vp the bloud of hir tung, and see that none be left.
And if the other side of hir tung happen to be so too, slit it likewise: which done, take the iuyce of Maydenheare, and lay vpon it.
And for want of that herbe, take a little bineger, or rather the iuyce of a Lymon which is much better, and wash hir meate in Oyle till she be throughly recured.
Anoynt wel hir throte and tung with Sirup of Mulberies (otherwise called Diamoron two or three dayes togither, after whiche take of the foresayd good Oyle: Then take the powder of Brimston and of sugre candie, or of other white suger mingled well togither of eche a like, and put a little thereof vpon the Canker: for it you should lay much, it would fret the tung too sore.
And this maner of dealyng is better for a confirmed Canker, than any other.
Therfore wash hyr meate with the oyle aforesayd, and feede hyr with mutton, or the flesh of Hennes or pullets.
Of a kinde of Pippe that is in a Hawke.
THe Pippe co~meth chiefly of cold and moystnesse of the head: and sometimes of feeding your hawke with euill and rotten flesh, without washing it and making it cleane in warme water in the winter, and in colde water in the Sommer.
Whereof ingendereth slimy grosse humors in the bodie, which ascend vp to the head ingender the pip on the tip of the tung as ye see co~monly fall out in chickens.
And ye may perceiue this disease by your hawkes often sniting, by making a noyze twice or thryce in hyr snyting.
M. Amé Cassian sayeth, that to remedie this disease, you must caste your hawke gently, looke vpon the tip of hir tung: and if ye finde hir to haue the pippe, ye must scoure hir with a pill made of Agarik and Ierapigra, giuen two or three dayes togither with hir casting towards night, and that will rid hyr of the rhewme in hyr head, the rather if she be made to tyre against the sunne in the mornings, as is sayd afore.
M. Malopin in his booke of the Prince, sayeth, that to cure the Pippe, ye must binde a little cotton vpon a stickes ende, and dipping it in sweete rosewater washe well hir tung with it: and afterwarde annoynt it three or foure dayes with oyle of Almonds, and oyle olife well washed as is before sayd: and when ye haue done so, ye shall finde the Pippe all white and soft.
Then take an awle, and with the poynt of it lift vp the Pippe softly, remouyng it as women do Pippe their Chickens.
Howbeit ye must not remoue it till it be full rype: for if yee take it to greene, you shall hurte your hawke.
And looke that you wet hir tung and palat twyce or thryce a day with the foresayd oyle, till she be throughly cured.
Of the disease of their palat which falleth of swelling by reason of moysture of the head.
SOmetimes it happeneth that the palates or roofes of hawkes mouthes are swollen, and looke whytish: which commeth of moysture and cold wherwith their heads are surcharged.
And ye may perceyue this disease by that they cannot close their beakes, and by that they looke not so cherely as they were woont to do, ne can put ouer, or endew their meate but with greate payne.
To cure your hawke of this disease, you muste open hir beake, where you shall finde the roofe of hir mouth whytish and swollen.
And if you find it not so, you must searche hir beake to discerne if she haue any other disease there that lettes hir to shet it: for sometimes their beakes growe more on the one side of the clappe than on the other, so as they cannot close the~.
The remedie that M. Amé Cassian giues for this euill, is this: The hawkes that are so diseased must haue the sayd pilles of Larde, suger, and maree of beefe, giuen them euery morning, one or twoo, for foure or fiue dayes space togither, and aboute an houre or two after, feede them with some poultrie or mutton drawen through the foresayd oyle.
And after those dayes, open hir beake againe and softly scrape of the whytenesse: and if ye finde the swellyng abated, then do none other thing to hyr but onely continue your anoynting of hyr with the sayd oyle.
But if ye perceiue the swellyng to ryze to high, ye may launce or pricke it, but ye muste beware that yee stryke not to deepe, for ye may soone kill your hawke.
Afterwarde lay the iuyce of maydenheare to it, and continue it till it be throughly cured, and alwayes drawe hir meate in the sayd oyle, or else in milke or butter.
THe disease of the iawes co~meth either of drawing the hoode to streyt, or for that it is to close streyt of it self.
And yt causeth the Rewme to droppe downe out of the hawkes head vpon hyr gummes iawes, (if we may so terme them.)
You shall know it by this, that she can neyther open nor shet hir beake.
ANnoynt well the gorge, iawes, and nares of your hawke with oyle of sweete Almondes three or foure dayes togither, and for want of that, take oyle Olife washt in two or three waters, and drawe hir meate through it as is sayde afore, and giue hir pilles of Lard, sugre and marie of a beef, or else common pilles to scoure hyr bothe vpward and downeward.
Of the Hawke that hath broken hir clappe, by some mischaunce.
AN other inconuenience befalleth Hawkes by the negligence of such as kepe them: for in their feeding there cleaneth or remayneth some peece of flesh in their iawes or in the roofe of their mouth, or on some place or other of their beake, whiche marreth their beakes, so as it is enforced to fall away in sliuers and peeces.
This hapneth for want of wiping their beakes as they ought to be after their feeding, by meane whereof both hir clappes grow so much, as at length it falleth to breaking and riuing, if it be not remedied in time.
And thereof breedeth this disease which we call Formica Corrosiua wherby the beake becommeth brittle and is vtterly marred.
Looke into your Hawkes beake, coping it and keping it very cleane, and if you find any Formica corrosiua there, remoue it.
That done, anoynt the horne of hir beake with the bloud of a Snake or an Adder, and the bloud of a Henne, mingled togither, to make it to grow the more speedyly.
Also let the meate which she eateth be cut in small pellets, for otherwise she cannot feede.
And yet for all that, ceasse not to flee with hir.
Within .xv. dayes or three weekes after, when ye see hir beake begin to grow agayne, cast your Hawke handsomely, and cope hir nether clappe that the vpper clappe may ioyne orderly vnto it, as it should do of his owne nature.
Of the falling sicknesse, whiche hapneth to hawkes as well as to men, and other liuing things.
THe chiefe Falconers say, that the falling sicknesse happeneth too hawkes, through a fumyng heate that ascendeth vp from the liuer to theyr heads, and maketh them to fal downe vpon the suddayne.
M. Mallopin sayeth, that to remedie this disease, the hinder part of their head must be pervsed sought, where a man shall finde two little pittes, whiche muste be cauterized with a wyer of brasse.
And if that help not, then must you cauterize hyr dayntely vpon the head with the foresayd round yron, or else you may hap to kill hir.
This done, drie redde Lentils in an ouen, and make them into fine powder: then take the filyng of yron, the finest of it, as much of the one as of the other, and mingle the~ bothe togither with honie, and make it in little balles of the bignesse of a peaze.
Then giue your hawke two or three of them, puttyng them as farre into hir gorge as you can, and holde hir vpon your fist at the fire or in the sunne til she haue made a mute or twayne, and let hir haue no meate till noone, and then serue hir of a Pigeons wing, dealing so with hyr seuen or eight dayes togither: In the night let hyr be kepte alwayes abrode, and in the day times in the darke, with water continually before hir. M. Amé Cassyan teacheth another medicine: that is to wit, that the skinne of theyr heades muste be launced right ouer agaynst the foresayde pittes, where there are little veynes whiche muste be taken vp with a silke threede, and annoynted ouer with the bloud of a Chicken.
Whiche beyng done, ye must gyue hir the foresayde pilles seuen or eight dayes togither, takyng good heede that ye set hir not neere any other hawkes, and that your hawking gloue be very cleane.
For that kynde of diseaze is contagious, and will soone passe from one hawke to another, by feeding on the gloue whereon another hath bene fedde before.
And by night lette hir stande in the winde and open ayre, and by day in darke places, with water alwayes afore hyr, as is already taught you.
Of another falling euill which first breedeth in the necke and in the gorge of a Hawke.
IF you perceyue your hawke to haue a swollen necke gorge, that she panteth more strongly in the mornings at one time than at another: assure your selfe that she hath the falling euill.
Martin sayeth, that you must take Sanguis draconis, Nutmegs, that kinde of Mirabolans, whiche are called Kebuline, Cloues, Cynamon and Ginger, of eche two pennie weight, and making it all into fine powder, strew a quantitie of it euery morning vpon hir meate, supping hir euery night with a ratte or a mouse, three or foure dayes togither, and that will make hir whole and sounde.
Of the Fistula, a grief that proceedes through payne of the head.
YE shal perceyue when your hawke hath ye Fistula, by the ru~ning of hir nares by the streaming downe of ye humors fro~ hir head.
Ye must cast your hawke handsomly, and deplume hir head behinde in the backer parte, and anoynt it with butter and swynes bloud togither.
And you shall finde a vayne that co~meth downe to hir eyes, whiche you muste cut, and knit it againe with a redde silke threede, anoynting it well and throughly with butter swynes bloud for nine dayes togither, and then it will recouer hir.
IF your hawke gape much and beate hyr wings, then be yee sure that she hath ye swymming in ye head.
Take a fine needle that is sharpe poynted, and when ye haue well het it in the fire, pearce hir nares with it through on bothe sides, and beware that ye go not awrie, for so ye may do hyr great harme.
Then anoynt it with Oyle and butter togither, and it will recouer hyr, by meane of the vente that you shall giue the humour by the nares.
For all maner of diseases in the head, and specially for the ache that is in a Hawkes head.
WHensoeuer your hawke hath any great disease or payne in hyr head, take sixe graynes of pepper, foure of Stauesaker, and fiue cloues, beate them togither into sine powder, and feede hir but three dayes togither, with warme meate mingled with it, and she shall recouer.
And for want of that, ye may vse the fine powder that is me~cioned heretofore.
And if your hawke will not be fedde with it, let it be conueyed into cotton or into a a Hennes skin, to take away the sent of it, feede hir with none other than warme meate, and such as is light of disgestion.
For the diseases of the head, do so weaken hyr appetite and stomacke, that she cannot put ouer, nor indew hir meate.
And to the ende she may the better indew it, giue hir but small meales till she be throughly recouered.
And if she will eate the yolke of an egge, droppe vpon it some of the sayde powder, and giue it hir with whote meate, and so ye shall recouer hir.
Here are sundry receytes and medicines, whiche neuer haue proued, and therefore can warrant little of them: but neuerthelesse finde them in my French Authors, and therefore am so ventrous to place them here in this collection of remedies for hawkes: leauing them ouer to the desirous Falconer, that hath a wil to practise vpon his hawke.
For store (they say) is no sore, among many there must needes fall out some good and wholesome receytes.
Wherfore iudge discretely of all: and make proofe of suche as you lyke: Experience is the mother of skill.
YOu must vndersta~d yt there are .ij. sorts of diseases in hawks, called by the name of the stone: scarsly dothe the one come without the other.
The one keepth beneath in their tuels, the other in their bowels panels: they may be cured bothe togither.
And M. Amé Cassian saieth that the stone or Cray commeth by the eating of filthie flesh, by meane of foule feeding.
For it burneth drieth in theyr bowels, (as sayd heretofore in the diseases of the head) bicause the filthe which they haue gathered in their panels inflameth their Liuer, which doth so drie vp the substance of the guttes, that they ca~not mute, but must needes die of it, if they be not cured.
Some say that this disease cometh of giuing them washt meate whote before it be throughly cold, that is like ynough: for a hawke likes not of water and bloud both togither at once.
The stone in the fundement cometh of the filthe whiche the hawke shoulde mute, which thickeneth lies bakte at the tuell: by meanes wherof she becomes so poore, that she ca~not mute or slyse from hyr, so must needes die.
Yet notwithsta~ding haue often seene, that when a Falcon is high and lustie, she will slyse it out well ynough by meane of hir strength.
And ye may perceyue when she hath the stone, by that she muteth with peyne by drops, which is a signe that she needeth to skowre that matter, whereof the stone dothe grow.
And when she muteth at twice, a third time after that, it is a token that the stone is throughly confirmed in hyr guttes panel.
Moreouer, when ye see that hir tuell is chased, but little droppes from hyr, and that the feathers of hir trayne are much filed with hir muting, and that she is euermore picking with hyr beake about hir tuell, be ye sure she hath ye stone in hir tuell, which we cal the stone Craye.
Againe when she muteth and maketh as though she would iouke vpo~ your fist, in hir eyes is more troubled tha~ of ordinarie: doubt not but that she hath the stone cray.
And bycause she cannot ridde it, she is in daunger, if she be not lookte too in time.
The remedie thereof by the iudgement of M. Amé Cassyan, is this: take a slyce of Larde (or a pellet of Sope, wet in salet oyle) of the bignesse of a goose quill, and an inche long, and put theron the powder of Aloes cicotrine: which done, cast your Hawke handsomly, and conuey it into hir tuell as ye woulde giue a man a suppositorie: and if the Larde be too tender and softe to handle, sticke it vpon a Hennes feather, so as the feather appeare not through the Larde (for so may yee do hir greate harme with the feather) and so conuey it vp into hyr tuell, drawyng away the feather gently, and leauing the Larde behind, and haue snayles in a readinesse to giue hir immediatly after ye haue applied the sayde deuise.
And for lacke of Snayles, giue hir the forementioned pyll of Lard, mingled with marrow and suger, and set hir in the Sunne, or by a fire, without feeding of hir till one houre after noone.
And if she indure well to be by the fire, or in the Sunne, let hir alone, for the heate is very good for hir.
After this, giue hir somewhat more than halfe a gorge of a yong pullet, or if ye can come by any Myce or Rats, nothing is better.
But let hir not stand in the ayre or in the wynde, except the weather be fayre and warme.
At night when she hath indewed well, giue hir foure or fiue cloues of Mace broken, and lapped vp in a little cotton, or in the skynne of a Henne: and do so three or foure dayes, sauing the suppositorie or pellet aforesayde, for it will serue twice well ynough.
Looke well to it, that she cast not vp the cloues of Mace, for they be singular good for hawkes in all respectes, specially for all humors that surcharge their heades, and generally for all Filanders and wormes.
And if you mynd to rid a Falcon cleane of the Cray, and of the sayde disease: giue hir meate steeped in Goates mylke, or in other mylke, and do so foure or fiue dayes together: for the sayde mylke is verie good against the Cray.
In the booke of the Prince, there is another receyt, for this disease of the Cray or stone.
That is to wit: Take the gall of a Pigge of three weekes old, and conuey it into your hawkes beake, so as she maye take it and swallowe it downe whole without breaking, and take heede that she cast vp none of it againe.
Afterwardes, giue hir a little piece of the Pigges fleshe, of the bignesse of a Beane, and let hir stande emptiepanneld vpon the same vntill night, setting hir in the Sunne or by the fire.
This medicine is verie good for all byrdes of praye that are encombred with the Craye or Stone.
Neuerthelesse, if a Gossehawke or a Sparrowhawke haue that disease (so it be not too sore) giue it hir nor more but once.
But as for other hawkes that are of stronger mettel, ye maye giue it them thrice.
And when euening is come, feede your hawke with a pullet, or with mutton, or with small birdes, and the nexte morning steepe hyr meate in Goates mylke, or womans mylke, feeding hir so three dayes together with small gorges, and she shall be sounde.
And if you will not or can not vse the sayde Receypt, ye may take a little oyle Olyf, and somewhat lesse Honnye, and wette your hawkes meate therewith, for it is good to helpe that disease.
Some put the sayde things into a Hennes gut tyde fast at both endes, bycause a hawke will take it the better: and naturally she likes not oyle with hir meate.
Take Larde, marow of beefe, Suger clarified and once boyled, and Saffron in pouder, or eache a like quantitie, prouided that the Lard be first stieped in vineger four and twentie houres, and the water shifted three or foure times, and set abroad in the open ayre.
Of the which things confected together, ye must make pylles of the bygnesse of a Beane, whereof you shall giue your hawke one or two, setting hir in the Sun or by the fire, and feeding hir with poultrie or with mutton, allowing hir but reasonable gorges, foure or fiue days together, giuing hir Maces as afore: for they can not but do the hawke great pleasure in euery condition and part.
Master Michelin teacheth another receipte for this disease, specially for Gossehawkes and Sparowhawkes, which haue tryed ofte.
Cut a Sheepes hart in small pieces, and when ye haue let it lye stieping all night in Asses mylke, Gotes mylke, or womans mylke, put a little boylde Suger into the milke, and gorge your hawke reasonably therwith three days together.
And assure your selfe, that this medicine is very excellent for the Cray, without danger for all manner of hawkes.
M. Martine sayth in auouchment of this matter, that when a hawke cannot well mute with hir ease, it betokeneth plainely sheweth that she hath the stone Cray.
For remedy wherof, take the heart of a Hog, and a quantitie of his sewet minced very small, and make them into pouder togither, giue it the hawke in hir meate three days successiuely.
Againe, haue seene some take the white of an egge, or the whole egge, with a little Saffron in pouder, well coyled and beaten together, which being bestowed vpon the hawkes meate, hath cured hir. Mallopin sets downe yet one other receit more.
Put the iuice of (water Cressyes) in a Hennes gut of one inche long, tyed at both ends, and force your hawk to receiue it.
Which done, set hir in the Sunne or by the fire, and feede hir not till noone, at which time giue hir but halfe a gorge of hote meate, bicause of the medicine, which hath set al hir body out of temper.
Let this he done two or three dayes, and if you find the medicine to haue scowred and take~ much at the first of your hawke, giue hir lesse and lesse, and so shall she recouer.
The booke of Princes setteth downe yet one other remedie for the same disease, that ye might put it in vre whiche soeuer liked you beste.
Take a penny weight of Persley seede, as much of Smallage seede, a dramme of boylde Suger, a penny weight of Stauesaker, of Wheaten branne one dram, and halfe the shell of an egge.
Put them altogether into a good large psnet full of water, and seethe it till it be consumed to the one halfe, and then streine it through a cloth.
Then take of Cassia Fistula one dramme, and of Turbith one penny weight, of Hermodactils two pennye weight, and of Aloes Cicotrine three penny weight.
Beate all these into fine pouder, put them into the water, wherein the other mixture was boyled, and make thereof a Clyster in the bladder of a Pygge.
Then take a great quyll of a Goose or of some other byrde, and thereof make the necke of your Clysterbagge fast tyed to the bagge, that nothing maye issue out of it, and so giue your hawke the Clyster, as you haue seene it giuen to men at theyr neede.
This done, set your hawke in the Sunne or by the fire, and keepe hir emptie till noone, at which time giue hir a pullets legge, and so she shall recouer no doubt.
For the disease called the Filanders which happen in the bodyes of Hawkes: and first of such as are in their gorge.
THe chiefe Falconers say, that all hawkes haue the Filanders at al times, are neuer wtout them, like as it is saide that no horse is without the Bottes.
There are foure kyndes of Filanders, and one other kynde of Filanders, of which will speake hereafter in their due places.
And with all these sortes of Filanders, some hawkes are more pestered than other some.
The cause of them is eyther their feeding on grosse and foule meates, which ingender increase those Fila~ders in them, or else for that inflying either ye field, or the riuer, they breake some smal veines within their bodies, at the encounter, by seazing too violently vpon their praye.
By reason whereof the bloud bursteth out into their bowels, and there dryeth and clottereth, whereof breede the sayd Filanders in great aboundance.
Afterwarde by reason of the stinch of the sayde bloud so clottered and bakte, being corrupted and putrified in the bulke bycause it is out of the proper vessels and vaynes where it ought to be, the Filanders runne about seeking the cleanest places of the bodie, to shunne the sayd noysyme stinche, and creepe vp either into the hawkes heart, or into hir gorge, so as she dyeth of it.
Againe, some men saye, that their hawkes dye of the diseases of the heade, or of the Craye, when in deede they dye of the Filanders or (which is worsse) of the Aignilles a kinde of Filanders for whiche we want an englishe terme.
wil speake first of those Filanders that craule vp to the hawkes gorges, and from thence to the holes in their palates whereat the hawkes do breathe, and by them into their braynes, wherby they be in danger of death.
Ye may perceiue this inconuenience in the gorge by this, that when you haue fedde your hawke, the Filanders feeling the sweetnesse and tast of the flesh, doe styrre and craule about in suche wise, as you shall see your hawke oftentimes gape.
By reason wherof it commeth to passe that nowe and then she casteth hir gorge.
Againe, ye may know by this, that your hawke will be strayning at them with hir talons.
Therefore cast hir gently, and looke into hir throate, and you shall see them crawling there.
To kill the sayde Filanders, master Amé Cassyan sayth thus: take a great Radysh roote, and make a hole in it, and fill it with water, and set it in embers verie hote, putting fresh embers to it continually by the space of halfe an houre or more, till it be throughly well boyled, and as your water diminisheth, fill it alwayes vp againe, howebeit that the Radishe yeeldeth water ynough of his owne nature.
Then put the Radishe into a dyshe, stampe it and presse out all the iuyce quite and cleane.
This done, put the quantitie of a Peaze of Saffron made into pouder into the sayde water, and washe your hawkes meate therewith when yee feede hir, and giue hir but halfe a gorge.
And if she will not feede on it, let hir be kept emptie, till she be verye greedie and eger: doe thus to hir three or foure dayes together, and you shall kyll the Filanders, and make your hawke sounde.
Of the Filanders that are in hawkes bowels, and in their reynes.
YE shall discerne that the Filanders are in hir bowelles and guttes, by hir heauie cheare and playnt in the nighte, for she will crye, and make a mournfull noyse.
Also ye may perceyue it by this, that when ye take hir on your fist in the morning, she will stretch hir selfe more strongly than she is wont to do of ordinarie, and somtimes she wil make as though she would iouke vppon your and she will be busie with hir beake about hir backe right ouer againste hir raynes.
When ye see these signes, assure your selfe that eyther the Filanders or the Aigailles doe trouble hir: and if she haue not helpe of them betimes, they will kill hir, for haue seene many dye of that disease.
Take Lentilles, of the reddest that you can finde and parche them at the fire, and make fine pouder of them, with the pouder of Wormeseede, lesse by one halfe than of the pouder of Lentils, and mingle and temper them well together, and make thereof a playster, dryuen (vppon cloth or leather.)
Then deplume your hawke in the place where hir griefe is, and lay the playster to hir panell, changing it euerie day, for foure or fiue dayes space together, and she shall be cured.
If ye like not that receipt, Master Michelin giueth you another, which is this.
Take the leaues of a Peach tree, of Rew, and of Wormeseede, and of those thre being brayed together, streyne out the iuyce, and afterwarde take then pouder of Wormewood, and put it into the iuyce, and lay it vpon your hawkes reynes playsterwise twice a day, euening and morning, for foure or fiue days together, it will kil the Filanders, and saue your hawke.
Take (saith he) a cloue of Garlyke pylled, and giue it your hawke in a hens skynne, and it will heale hir.
Of the Filanders or wormes that are in hawkes legges and thighes, whiche the Frenchmen call Vers.
THere is another manner of Filander called the Vers which commeth sometimes vpon hawkes that are lately taken, by setting them vpon a pearche vnhooded or vnseled, for they fall to beating of them selues with so great force, that they breake the veines of their legs.
And this hapneth specially rather to Hagard hawkes, than to soare hawkes.
By meanes whereof the bloude of those veynes so broken, poureth and distilleth along their legs and pannels, betweene the skinne and the fleshe, and there lying in lumpes, doth conuert to wormes, whereof the hawke dieth.
This disease may come also by hir bating ouermuch vpon the fiste, where through she bruseth hir selfe violently: and sometimes he that beareth hir furthereth it by his rashnesse impaciencie.
And ye may perceiue that ye Filanders wormes are in your hawkes legges or bowels, by this: They plume themselues oftentimes, yea, the pendant feathers of their thighes and of their panels, fal off voluntarily.
Master Mallopin sayth, that the remedie for this disease, is to washe your hawkes thighs bellie twice a day, for foure or fiue dayes together, with the foresaid medicine of the leaues of the Peachtree, of Rew, or wormeseede, and with the wormeseede it selfe.
For the disease called in french the (Aiguils) an euill worse than the Filanders, for which know no apt English terme, and therfore must borow the french terme of mine Author.
THere are found a kynd of Filanders which are called Aiguilles bycause they be sharpe like a needle, shorter and more perillous than are the great Filanders, for as much as in seeking the cleanest partes of the body, to shunne the stinch and filth, they pearce the bowels creepe vp to the hart, so that your hawke perisheth of them, if she be not regarded in time.
Ye shall perceiue this disease by hir shrinking and snyting vpo~ the lure, as also by hir grasping with hir foote more strongly in the mornings than she was wont to do, againe by the often picking beaking in hir braile feathers, neare hir tuell.
Take Stauesaker beaten into pouder, the herbe of Barbarie, otherwise called in greek Pestora, Aloes Citotrine, of each a like quantitie, coyled altogether into pouder, and giue your hawke the quantitie of a Beane thereof, lapped vp in some part of a Hennes skinne, or in cotton.
Which done, set hir in the Sunne or by the fire, and at noone allowe hir but halfe a gorge.
You maye giue hir of this pouder three or foure dayes, so she be not too lowe already: for if she be not somewhat highe in fleshe and in life, she will not be able to beare and brook it.
And if this medicine cure hir not, take this that foloweth, which is of master Mallopins deuice also.
Burne Harts horne well raked in the embers, when it is waxen cold, beate it into pouder.
Then take ye like quantitie of Lupins made into pouder, as ye had of ye harts horne, asmuch againe of the pouder of Wormseed, as of both ye other, halfe asmuch Aloes Cicotrine, as of the Harts horne, and half asmuch Tryacle as of Aloes.
Mingle al these togither with Honny by litle litle, force it to that thicknesse, yt ye may make balles of it to the bignesse of a nut, whereof ye shall giue your hawke euery day one, by the space of fiue or sixe days, allowing hir but half a gorge after it.
And if your hawke cast it again, let it be lapped in a litle cotto~ or in a hens skin, yt she feele not ye bitter tast of it.
M. Amé Cassian giueth yet another remedy, which is the medicine made heretofore for the Filanders, that is to wit, Rew Wormwood, of each alike, and asmuch of the Peachtree leaues, as of the~ both, with a litle pouder of Wormseede infused in the iuyce of the said herbs.
Then fill a Hennes gut of an inche long, therwith tied fast at both ends, and giue it to your hawke.
You maye vse any of all these at your owne discretion and pleasure.
When a hawke gapeth inordinatly vpon the fiste of hir keeper.
Hawke will nowe and then sall to gaping, eyther vpon hir keepers fist, or vpon the pearche, and specially when she is set in the Sunne being somewhat hote.
And this gaping maye be vnderstoode and construed two wayes.
The one is she doth it of hir owne nature, but that is not so ofte as the other which commeth by mischance, and that eyther of colde that she hath taken, or of some moyst humor that destilleth downe into hir gorge.
Some are of opinion that the hawke which vseth it often, is diseased with the Filanders, which creepe vp and downe in hir gorge before she be fed, or after she hath indewed, as haue declared in the chapter of Filanders of the gorge.
The remedie by Mayster Amé Cassians aduyce, is to take the pouder of Wormeseede and of Wormewoode, of eache alyke, and one quarter lesse of Aloes Cicotrine, and of these three pouders mingled together, to gyue your hawke the mountenance of a Beane in hir casting, lapped vp in a Hennes skyn, or in any such like deuice.
WHen a hawke hath any Apostume in hir bodye, ye shall knowe it by the stuffing of hir nares, and by hir inordinate panting, whiche accident commeth sometymes by rushing rashely into bushes, or by bating too muche vppon the pearche, and moreouer by ouer free encounter with hir praye Nowe when she is so brused and chafed, and taketh colde vpon it, Apostumes breede thereby, bycause the mischiefe is not knowne and looked vnto afore hande, Mallopin in his booke of the Prince gyueth this remedie.
Take the white of an egge well beaten, and the iuyce of Colewortes well broosed, as much of the one as of the other, and giue it your Hawke in the morning, in the small gut of a henne, and set hir by a fire, or in the Sunne, and at noone feed hir with mutton, or with a Pullet.
The next day take Rosemarie dryed, and beaten into fine powder, and bestowe it vpon hir meate reasonably.
For other three dayes giue hir Suger, and three dayes next after that, plie hir againe with hir sayde powder, letting hir stande warme day and night, and feeding hir with good meate: and the likelyhoode is great she shall be recouered.
THe inflamation of the Liuer happeneth sometymes through the negligence of such as haue the keeping of Hawkes.
For they feede them with grosse and naughtie fleshe, such as is stale and stinking, without making of it cleane, by meanes whereof proceedeth the sayde inflamation of the Liuer.
Also it happeneth for want of bathing when neede is, and for lacke of water, which they ought to haue, or with ouerfleeing of them, when they bee emptie panneld.
Ye shall perceyue this disease by theyr feete: for they will be chafed, and the colour of their chappes will be chaunged, and looke whitishe through the heate of their Liuer.
And if yee finde hir tongue scorched and scalded blacke, it is a signe of death.
To remedie this mischiefe, make the medicine of Snayles steeped in Asses milk, or Gotes milke mentioned in the Chapters of the diseases of the heade, and of the stone: and giue your Hawkes of it three or foure days in the mornings.
And if ye cannot get that medicine, ye may vse the other that is made of Lard, Marrow of beef, and of boyled Suger, with a little Saffron, foure or fiue dayes togither euery morning, as is sayde before.
For the scouring of hir will ridde and abate hir heate.
And all that while for seuen or eight dayes, feede hir with poultrie, or with mutton, steeped in milke: for milke is verie good for the heate of the Liuer.
And you must beware you feede hir not with Pigeon, nor with other grosse fleshe, for breeding hir to inordinate heate.
Master Amé Cassian sayth yet further, that to allay the sayd heate in Hawkes, it is very good to steepe or wet theyr meate in Endiue, or Nightshade water: and likewise in white whey newly and lately made.
And that this maner of feeding must be continued foure or fiue dayes, till the Hawke be well scoured.
And that if the hawke haue a desire to bowze the sayde whey, ye must let hir take hir fill.
Master Amé Cassian sayeth moreouer, that when your medicine hath scoured your hawke after the maner, and hir tongue is not aught in the better tune, ye must take oyle Olife washt in two or three waters, and bath hir tung throte therwith with a feather, three or foure times in the day, for foure or fiue dayes togither, and gently scrape hir tung and throte with a deuise of siluer, or of other mettal for that purpose.
And although shee neither can feede nor will, yet shee must not be giuen ouer, but haue meat gently conueyed into hir gorge by small morsels, and thrust downe lowe ynough with a fine sticke, that she may take it: for she cannot swallowe hir meate by reason of the swelling of hir tung, and therefore she must bee assisted in maner aforesayde.
Master Michelin sayth furthermore, that to comfort and strengthen the Liuer withall, ye must steepe Rubarb in a dishfull of colde water all night, and the next morning washe hir meate therewith, continuing so by the space of foure or fiue dayes togither.
Martin giueth yet one other medicine, which is this: Take a Pullets gut, thrice the length of your little finger, cutting it in three peeces (which you must tye fast at eyther end) fill them with Oyle of Almonds, or oyle Olife, and thrust them into hir throte so as she swallow them one after another: and within an houre after gorge hir reasonably with a yong Pullet.
And the next morning take the seedes of Rushes, and the scrapings of Iuorie, and the dung of Sparrowes, of eche two pennie weight, and make therof a powder, and season your Hawkes meat therwith, and it will pleasure hir.
And these two medicines are to be vsed when a hawke is not very fowle within, for if she be, then are the other former medicines better.
Of the Canker which breedeth of ouer great heate in the Liuer.
IF a Canker happen in the throte or tongue of a Hawke, by meanes of the heate of the Liuer: Make hir the foresayde medicine of Snayles, or that of Larde, as it is deuysed before, gyuing hir hir meate sowst in Mylke, or Oyle of sweete Almondes, or Oyle Olife: and let the Canker bee washt twice or thrice a day, tyll it wexe whyte and rype.
Then wyth your Instrument scrape it cleane awaye, that nothing of it remayne.
And if there happen to bee any deade fleshe in it, put powder of Alome, or the iuyce of Lymons in it, and plye it still with the sayde Milke or Oyles, till she bee throughly recured.
And to make newe flesh grow vp againe, put to it a little honie of Roses.
BYcause many menned speake of the disease of the Pantas dyuersely, and yet knowe not what it is: will shewe three maner of Pantases wherewith Hawkes are diseased.
The first in the gorge, the seconde commeth of colde, and the thirde is in the reynes and kidneys.
The first kinde of Pantas commeth of bating vpon the perche, or vpon the fyst of him that beareth them, by meanes whereof some little veynes of the Liuer breake, and the bloud poureth out vppon the Liuer, which dryeth and cloddeth into small flakes, and those rysing vp afterwarde when the Hawke bateth agayne, doe stoppe the passages and windepype, and thereof commeth the Pantas.
And sometyme when the Hawke bateth, those flakes doe so ascende into hir throte, and lie ouerthwart it, that shee presently falleth downe deade: insomuche that some holde opinion it is the Pantas that maketh Hawkes to dye sodenly.
For proofe whereof, open your hawke when shee is deade, and yee shall finde this maladie in hir throte.
Maister Amé Cassian gyueth no medicine to thys Pantas in the gorge, bycause it cannot be ministred to hir, neither by hir throte nor otherwise.
For the disease holdeth hir in the verie windepipe, whereby the breath passeth in and out.
Neuerthelesse his counsell is to cloze vp the Hawke in some conuenient Chamber, with Lattis windowes, so as shee may not get out, and to set hir two or three perches, that shee may flee from one to another, and haue the Sunne shine in vpon hir if it be possible, and she must haue alwayes water by hir.
And when yee feede hir, hir meate must be cut in small pellets, and haue neyther feather nor bone in it, least she streyne hirselfe in tyring, and she must haue but halfe a gorge at once, and but once in a day.
AN other Pantas commeth of colde when Hawkes take wet in fleeing the fielde, or the Riuer, and are not weathered afterwarde, nor set in a place where they may stande warme.
Againe this disease commeth by standing where smoke or dust may annoy them.
And ye shall knowe the Pantas, by your Hawkes panting, for that shee cannot drawe hir breath as shee should do.
Mallopin sayth that to remedie this disease, ye muste take the filings of yron, and meale of Lentils, of eche like quantitie, which you must temper togither with honie till it bee lyke paaste, that ye may make it in little balles as bigge as a peaze.
Whereof you shall giue your Hawke two or three euery morning, and after noone feede hir with good meate, but not with beefe: which dyet you shall allowe hir three or foure dayes.
And if she amende not, season hir meate with powder of Orpiment two or three dayes.
Master Michelin giueth this medicine following: Take Maydenheare, which groweth lightly at the heades of pondes and pittes, and therewithall the rootes of Persley, the rootes of Smallage.
Of all these take like portions, and boyle them in a good bigge pot that is newe.
Then streyne the water through a Colander, and put thereto a quantitie of clarified Suger, with a little marrow of Beefe, and stirre them all togither, and thereof giue your Hawke a portion in the morning, and as much at Euen, with a small tunnel, or otherwise with a spoone or other fitte deuice foure or fiue dayes togither, and let hir not feede till noone be past, then giue hir of Pullettes fleshe without bloud, dipped in Oyle of sweete Almondes, or Oyle Olife washt in two or three waters: and when ye haue so sowst hir meate, let it also bee seasoned with a little Saffron and Suger.
And foure or fiue dayes after, if neede be, giue hir on hir meate the powder of Orpiment without Oyle other three or foure dayes.
And afterward ye may returne againe to your oyle of Almondes, or oyle Olife, till your Hawke be throughly recured.
Of the Pantas that is in the reynes and kidneys.
IT happeneth sometymes that when a Hawke hath bene recouered of some great greefe by good keeping and intendance, afterwarde she waxeth euill againe, and falleth to panting, wherof breedeth this disease of the reynes and kidneys, in maner of a Canker, as bigge as a beane, which swelleth bigger and bigger, in such wise, that shee falleth to casting some part of hir meate.
This Pantas differeth muche from both the other: for it will leaue hir seuen or eight dayes, then vexe hir again more strongly.
And somtymes it will take hir but from Moneth to Moneth, so as shee shall beare it oute a whole yeare.
It is discerned by this, that when shee panteth, shee stirreth hir reynes more than hir Pinions, whereas in the other shee styrreth more hir Pinions, than hir reynes.
Againe to knowe it truely when it commeth and goeth euerie seuen or eight dayes, if your Hawke chaunce to die, rippe hir and you shall finde a knubbe of the bignesse of a small Beane full vpon the reynes and the small of hir backe, whereof that disease proceedeth.
Yee must take the rootes of Capers, of Fenell, of Smallage, and of Parsley, and boyle them togither in a newe Potte, to the consumption of a thirde parte.
Then take an olde Tyle, the older the better, and make powder thereof.
When you serue your Hawke, feede hir with fleshe stieped in the water of the sayde rootes, a quarter of an houre or thereaboutes aforehande.
In the morning when ye giue hir of that washt meate, giue hir none of the powder, and at night washe not hir meate with the sayde water, but besprinckle it with the powder, so competently as she maye receyue it, and giue hir not at any time aboue halfe a gorge: let this be done nine or tenne dayes, or more.
If yee see that your Hawke amende not, continue it still: for then was the disease verie much confirmed, and the Hawke had borne it out long, and it is hard to bee cured.
But if yee take the disease when it is newe and greene, plye hir diligently with this Medicine, and it will helpe hir.
SOmetimes it falleth out that Hawkes are morfounded by some mischaunce, and sometimes also by giuing them to great a gorge, specially when they be wette.
For then they cannot indewe nor put ouer theyr gorges, and so they surfeyte, bycause their meate conuerteth into slyme, and grosse humours which ouerthrowe their appetite, by meanes whereof they come oftentymes to theyr bane.
Yee shall knowe the disease by this, that if yee giue your Hawke a great gorge, specially ouer night, the next morning she will haue no lyst to hir breakefast, but becommeth colde, and so falleth into great disease.
Mallopin in his booke of the Prince, giueth this medicine for it.
When yee perceyue hir to be so morfounded, and to haue lost hir appetite, giue hir no meate that day, but set water before hir, and let hir bowze or bathe at hir pleasure.
When shee hath bathed and is weathered agayne, throwe hir a liue Pigeon, and let hir kill it, and take as much of the bloud of it as shee lysteth, but let hir not eate past one of the legges at that tyme.
Afterwarde set hir downe on some high thing, with water by hir, and beware of giuing hir any great gorge.
Then for foure or fiue dayes togyther giue hir fiue or sixe cloues of Maces, lapped vp in a hennes skinne, and that will recouer hir.
Of the disease that is called the priuie and hidden euill in a Hawke, for vvhich vve haue no speciall terme.
SOmetymes Hawkes perishe for want of knowledge of some secrete disease that happeneth to them, and therefore will tell you how you shall know it.
The Hawke that hath that disease is alwayes greedie to feede, insomuch that when ye haue giuen hir a great gorge in the morning, shee will haue indewed it out of hande, and if ye giue hir another at Noone, shee will put it ouer by and by, and if yee giue hir the thirde at night, shee will dispatch that quickly also, and the more shee feedeth, the more greedie and nippie shee is.
This disease commeth of this, that when your Hawke is verie poore and lowe in state, and you desirous to set hir vp quickly, thinking to bring hir in good plight with great gorges, you feed hir with Pigeons and other fleshe, which she cannot indew, by reason of hir pouertie weaknesse, for want of heate in the liuer: the heate whereof is the cause of all kindly digestio~ indewing.
Also you may know this disease by hir often muting which is waterish thin, besides she doth slise further tha~ she is wot to do, by reason of spedy induing hir meat.
Maister Mallopin in his booke of the Prince, sayeth that for remedie of this disease, yee muste stiepe a sheepes heart cutte in small peeces all one night in Asses milke or Goates milke, and the next day giue your hawke a quarter of it in the morning for hir beaching, as much at noone, and the rest at night, forcing hir to receyue as much of the milke as ye can, and continue it fiue or six dayes togither, till yee see hir mute kindely.
Then feede hir reasonably with good meate, stieped in Oyle of sweete Almondes, continuing it for three or foure dayes space twice a day.
And as ye find your Hawke to mend, so increase hir meales by little and little, till shee bee in as good plight as she was before, alwayes continuing the sayde Mylke: for some are of opinion that milke is good for all diseases of a Hawke.
Master Amé Cassian saith, that to remedie this disease, yee must take a Tortoys of the land, and not a water Tortoys, and stiepe the fleshe of it in womans milke, Asses milke, or Goates milke, and giue your Hawke a quantitie of it for a beaching three or foure tymes, and a little more at hir feeding tymes sixe or seuen dayes togither.
Afterwarde feede hir with sheepes heartes stieped in Womans milke, by little and little at once, till shee bee recouered: and let hir not stande in a dampishe or moyste place, but in warme places in the Winter, and in coole places in Sommer, and alwayes hooded.
WHen your Hawke cannot iumpe the length of hir lynes and Criance to your fist, or from your fist vp to the perch, nor bate with hir wings: Ye may well thinke that she hath the disease of the reynes.
Therefore maister Cassian willeth you to chop a Hares skinne haire and all in verie small and fine peeces, and to mingle it with Cattes fleshe, and to feede your Hawke with it seuen or eight dayes togither: and if shee indew it, shee shall recouer of hir disease.
TO knowe whither your Hawke haue the Ague: Marke whether hir feete bee more swollen than they were woont to bee or no: if they bee, then hath shee the Ague.
To remedie this mischiefe, Michelin sayeth, you muste mingle Arsenicke and Capons greace togyther well sprinckled with Vineger, whereof you must make a little Ball, whiche you muste cause your Hawke to take by casting hir, and vse it in such wise as she may keepe it, and it will ridde the Ague.
IF a Hawke voyde Wormes, by maister Martins aduice yee muste make this Medicine following.
Take of the fine fylings of yron and strewe it vpon your Hawkes meate, which (if you doe well) must bee Porke: and feede hir so three or foure dayes wyth that kynde of flesh so seasoned, and it will cure hir.
Of the Teynte in a Hawkes feather, and hovve many kindes of it there be.
HItherto ye haue read of the inwarde diseases of Hawkes: Nowe will tell you of the outwarde accidentes: and first will speake of the Teynte, whiche the Frenche Falconers call Taigne, the Italians, Zignuole and Tarmae, whereof there are three sortes.
The first is when theyr principalles or long feathers beginne to droppe off, by meanes whereof many Hawkes are marred and cast awaye, without knowledge howe to helpe it.
Maister Amé Cassian sayeth, that this commeth sometymes of the Lyuer, and of the excessiue heate of the bodye, by meanes whereof small pymples ryse vppon theyr wings, or on their traynes, whiche afterwarde cause theyr feathers to droppe off, and when they are gone, the holes where they stoode doe cloze agayne, wherethrough the Hawke doeth perishe, if shee bee not remedyed.
This disease is contagious, and one of them will take it of an other, and therefore yee muste not let the Hawke that is affected with it, stande neare a Hawke that is sounde, neyther must you touche or feede a sounde Hawke on the Gloue whereon a sicke Hawke hath beende fedde.
And yee shall knowe that shee hath that disease, by hir often picking with hir beake vppon hir principall feathers of hir wings and trayne, and by theyr dropping awaye.
Therefore cast your Hawke, and let hir bee well perused, and yee shall fynde the sayde disease.
For remedie whereof, Maister Martin, and Maister Cassian say, you must cast your Hawke, and when you haue sound the small pimple whence the feather dropt first, you muste get a little sticke of Firre, whiche is by nature gummie and fatte, make a little pegge of it, not sharpe at the foreende, nor thruste it in with violence, but softly as you may.
And if ye can get none of that Woodde, then take a grayne of Barlye, and cutte of the forepoynt of it, and annoynt it with a little Triacle, or Oyle Olife, and conuey it into the hole, so as it may sticke a little out, and the hole not cloze togyther, and stoppe agayne.
Then with a small Launce or Penknife you muste slitte the pimple, and let out the redde water which you shall finde there.
After this take Aloes Cicotrine in powder, and put it into the gall of an Oxe, coyled in a dishe, and with those two mingled togyther, annoynt the slitte rounde aboute: and beware that there come nothing in the hole where the feather grewe, for it mighte doe the Hawke great harme.
This done, take of the reddest Lentilles that you can come by, and lesse than halfe so muche of the fylings of yron, and mingle them togyther with Honie, and thereof make Pilles as bigge as a Peaze, and giue your Hawke two or three of them euerye Morning.
Then set hir by a fyre, or in the Sunne, and after Noone giue hir a reasonable good gorge of a Pullet, or of Mutton, and if yee lyst yee maye giue hir of those Pilles towardes the Euening also.
Let hir meate bee stieped in milke as is sayde heeretofore, fiue or sixe dayes togyther, and looke alwayes to the incysions that yee made, and shee shall bee recouered.
Annoynt the place wyth some good Bawlme where the feathers fell awaye, and the Teynte will dye out of hande, and freshe feathers supplie the place agayne.
And hee sayeth moreouer, that you muste take the powder of Petre of Alexandria whiche is solde at the Potecaryes, and mingle it with Vineger, and annoynt the diseased place with it three or foure tymes, and it will be whole.
The seconde kinde of Teynte whiche fretteth the principals of a Hawke to the verie Quill, commeth (as the cheefe Falconers affirme) of ill keeping, when they haue not their due intendance, beeing neyther bathed nor scoured, nor kept in wholesome places.
And therefore we are forbid to keepe a Hawke in a sluttishe corner.
Againe, sometymes both in the mew and out of the mewe it happeneth that by feeding them with filthie and lothsome fleshe, they become full of filth both within and without, whereof breedeth suche a sort of Wormes, as doe vtterlye frette asunder and marre their feathers.
The three chiefe Falconers say, that for this seconde Teynt which fretteth the feathers of a Hawke, in sort that they become like stickes, yee must take vine shredds, and make therof as strong Lie as ye can, and wash your Hawke once a day with it throughly: and when she is weathered againe, annoint all hir feathers with honie out of the combe.
Then make powder of Sanguis Draconis, and Roch Alom verie small, and powder the foresaid Quils therwith, and your hawke shalbe recured.
Or else take a Mole of that sort which breedeth in Medowes, and put hir in a new earthen pot well couered and stopped, and set it on the fire one whole day: which done, take hir out againe as she is, and make hir into powder very small.
And when ye haue bathed your Hawkes feathers throughly with the sayd Lee, by and by bestrow hir feathers with the powder of the Mole a certaine time togither, and it will pleasure hir.
The thirde kind of Teynt is knowne in Hawkes by the ryuing of their principal feathers throughout alongst the vpper side of the webbe of them.
And that happeneth commonly for want of cleane feeding, and due attendance.
To remedie this, Mallopin sayth, that ye must take a greene Reede, and cleaue it all alongst, and scrape oute the pithe of it, and wring oute of it as muche iuyce as yee can, wherewith you muste moysten the sayde ryuen feathers all alongest the ryftes of them, and they will close and shette againe as before.
And if anye feather happen to be dropt awaye, let a tente made of Fyrre or of a grayne of Barlye as is sayde heeretofore bee put into the hole of it, and vse it after the foresayde manner, and a newe feather will growe againe out of hande.
If this deuise to cause a feather to growe againe be not to your liking, you shall in this collection finde such as may content you.
Martin giueth another Medicine and aduice for the same, which is this: Take twopennie weight of Orpiment, and nine graynes of Pepper, and make it into powder, and cast it vpon hir meate, which must be reasonable warme.
Againe, take three slices of Bacon, of that which is nearest the skinne, and let them bee so smal as your hawke may swallow them with ease: sawce them with a little honie, and strew of the powder of the filings of yron vpon the honie, and giue your hawke thereof three dayes togither.
After which time take a yong Chicken, and before yee boyle it in wine, broose the breast of it, and open it with a sharpe knife or other instrument, that the bloud may follow.
Then feed hir with the sayd Pullets flesh warme, steeped in Goates milke, or other milke.
Practise this two or three dayes, and afterwarde therevpon giue hir good warme meate, and shee shall recouer.
Of the Hawke that indeweth not, ne putteth ouer as she should doe.
IT falleth out sometimes that a Hawke cannot well indew nor put ouer hir meate as she should doe, and that is onely bycause she is foule within, or hath taken some surfeyt, or else that when she was low and poore, hir keeper being desirous to set hir vp againe to hashly, gaue hir to great gorges, which she by reason of hir weaknesse was not able to put ouer and indewe, wherethrough shee surfetted and forwent hir appetite of feeding altogither.
For remedie hereof, Mallopin sayeth ye must feede hir with light meates, and little at once, as with yong Rattes and Mice, or with great Rattes, for there is more substaunce in them than in the other, whereof yee muste giue hir but halfe gorges, that shee maye the sooner indewe them, and put them ouer.
Or else feede hir wyth Chicken, or Mutton dipped in Goates milke, or otherwyse.
And for wante of those, take the yolke of an Egge, and giue hir a quarter of a gorge thereof, and when ye feede hir with the flesh of any liue byrde or fowle, steepe it well in the bloud of the same fowle, and it will doe hir much good.
So shall your Hawke mount of hir flesh apace: if besides that, you doe also scoure hir with pilles made of Larde, Marow of beefe, Suger, and Saffron three mornings togither, and two houres after giue hir a reasonable gorge.
When a Hawke indewes not hir meate, ne putteth it ouer as she ought to doe, but hath surfeyted and wanteth naturall heate: Take verie pure white wine, and steepe hir meate in it luke warme, giuing it hir by little little oft tymes in the day, alwayes chaunging hir meate, and see that it be light of digestion.
Doe thus to hir till she be in better tune againe, giuing hir fiue or sixe cloues of Maces in the Euening wrapped in a little cotton, or in some other such like deuice: for that will warme hir head, all hir other partes verie well, and let the Cotton bee dipped in odoriferous olde wine.
Of the Hawke that can neither cast vp hir meate, nor endew it as she ought.
ANother mischiefe is wont somtymes to light vpon Hawkes, namely that by taking ouergreat gorges, they can neyther indewe nor cast it againe, and also that many tymes a Hawke soareth away with hir pray, and feedeth so greedily vpon it by reason she was kept ouereager and sharp, that she can neither get it vp nor downe, and thervpon falleth in danger of death.
Wherfore all men ought to vse discretion in feeding their hawkes, that they ouergorge them not.
Master Cassian sayeth that for remedie thereof, ye must set cleane water in a vessell before your Hawke, and let hir bowze thereof at hir pleasure.
And if she list not: then take the quantitie of a Beane of Porke, of the fattest of it, and two parts lesse of powder of Pepper, with a little salte brayed verie small, and when ye haue mingled them all togither, make a little ball of it as bigge as a Beane, and put it in your Hawkes beake, so as she may receyue it.
Then set hir by the fire, or in the Sunne, and you shall see hir cast hir gorge.
But let not the Hawke be too poore, to whom you intende to allowe this pill, for if she bee too lowe, she will hardly beare it.
RUb the roofe of hir mouth with a litle Vineger and Pepper, and she will cast by and by.
And if ye list, ye may also conuey two or three droppes of the same into hir nares, and it will make hir cast hir gorge out of hande.
And if ye see that the Vineger and Pepper do vexe and distemper hir to muche after the casting of hir gorge, spirt a little fresh water with your mouth into hir pallat and nares.
Of the Havvke that casteth hir gorge ouer much, and cannot indew as shee shoulde doe.
MAny tymes it commeth to passe that when a Hawke hath fedde, she cannot keepe hir meate but falleth to casting, as soone as shee hath receyued it.
This commeth of feeding hir with grosse, foule, and vnholesome meate not washed: or else for that she is foule in the panell, and so cannot indew by reason of the great store of filth that is within hir.
Therefore ye must beware that ye cut not hir meate with a foule knife, or with a knife that hath cut Onions, Leeks, Chibbols, or such other like things.
To remedie this inconuenience, giue not your Hawke greate gorges.
And to bring hir well in tune againe, scoure hir with the forementioned pilles of Larde, Marrow, Suger, and Saffron, by the space of three dayes.
And aboue all things, let not the Hawke that hath cast hir gorge be fedde a good space after it, but let hir stande emptie in the Sunne with water before hir to bowse at hir pleasure, for that will doe hir muche good.
And when yee feede hir, giue hir at the fyrst time but a quarter of a gorge, and at the seconde somewhat more, if shee keepe the first: and hir meate must be some liue foule, and good of digestion, till she be brought againe to hir naturall plight.
But if shee keepe not all hir meate, giue hir yong Rattes, or liue Mice: and for want of those, giue hir small byrdes till she bee recouered.
If these foresayde things boote not, then by Mallopins aduice, take Coriander seede beaten in powder, and temper it with warme water, streyning it through a cloth, wash your Hawkes meate therewith foure or fiue dayes togither, and if yee haue no Coriander seede, take the iuyce of Coriander.
And if your Hawke mende not yet for all thys: Followe the counsell of Maister Michelins heere insuyng.
Boyle Baye leaues in whyte Wine till halfe the lyquor be wasted, and then let it coole with the leaues still in it.
Which done, force a Pigeon by deuice to bowse so much of the Wine that she may die of it.
Then immediately feede your Hawke with the same Pigeon, and let hir not eate more than a legge of it.
Of the Havvke that hath lost hir appetite and vvill not feed, to make hir eager vvithout bringing hir lovv.
Hawke doth sometyme lose hir appetite of feeding by some misfortune, as by taking to greate gorges towardes Euening, whiche she can not well indewe, bycause the nyghtes are colder than the dayes.
Also shee may lose hir appetyte by being foule in the pannell, and diuerse tymes by coldenesse, or by some other disease whiche can not bee perceyued out of hande.
For remedye whereof, Maister Mallopin sayeth, yee muste take Aloes Cicotrine, boylde Suger, and marrowe of Beefe, of eche alyke, sauing that there muste bee least of the Aloes, and when yee haue mingled them togyther, and made them in little Balles or Pilles as bigge as Beanes, giue of them to youre Hawke, and holde hir in the Sunne tyll shee haue caste vppe the slyme and fylthe that is wythin hir.
And if it happen to skoure downewarde, lette it not trouble you, for it will doe hir much good: and feede hir not till noone, at which time giue hir good meate, and serue hir so three dayes togyther.
For the same disease, Michelin sayth you must take common Pilles that are giuen to purge men withall, and giue one or two of them to your Hawke in the morning, keeping hir hooded by the fire, or in the Sunne, looking to hir that she cast them not, (if it may be) to the intent they may cause hir to scoure downward.
And the booke of the Prince sayth that it is good giuing of those Pilles to Hawkes in the beginning of September.
For if they haue the Filanders, or any other inward disease, it scoureth them, and riddeth them of all mischiefes that may ensewe.
Three or foure dayes after you haue giuen your Hawke these Pilles, if she haue yet no lust to feede, cast the filings of yron vpon hir meate three or foure dayes togither.
Master Amé Cassian sayth, that for the same disease, when you perceyue it, you must giue your Hawke a liue Stockedone, allowing hir leaue to seaze and tire vpon it, and to take the bloud of it at hir pleasure.
And for want of a Stockdone, small birdes are good, and so be Rattes and Mice, so she haue them aliue.
And if you will haue hir to indewe them quickely, giue hir but halfe gorges.
IT happeneth sometymes that Hawkes are brought so lowe, that a man shall haue much a doe to set them vp againe.
And that commeth through the fault of vnskilfull keepers, rather than any other thing.
Also Hawkes doe happen to growe poore by some disease that their keepers are not ware of.
Againe sometymes it happeneth that a Hawke soares awaye, and is lost foure or fiue dayes, and so becommes poore for want of pray.
Master Cassian sayth, that if ye will set hir vp againe, ye must feede hir a little at once and with good meate, such as Rattes and Mice are, for they they be lyght of digestion, or else with small birdes, which are good likewise, and of great nourishment.
Pultrie also is good, but it nourisheth not so muche of his owne nature, as Mutton doth.
Againe ye may set hir vp, (when she is low) in this maner folowing.
Take a spoonfull or twaine of honie, three or foure of fresh butter, boyle them togither in a new pot of water, the~ take Porke wel washed, stiepe it in that water, giuing your hawke a good reasonable gorge of it twice a daye, warming your sayde water when you intend to fede your hawke.
And if ye ca~ find any Snailes that breede in ru~ning waters, giue hir of them in the morning, and they will bothe skowre away the grosse slimie humors that are in hir panell, and also be a great helpe to set hir vp againe, (for they nourishe very well.)
And if ye mind to make your hawke eager, and sharpe set, without bating hir selfe, take the hart and liuer of a Pye, and when ye haue made it into powder, make your hawke to eate it, and it will sette hir sharpe and eager.
You are to consider of them all, and to vse the most probable at your election and pleasure.
Of a Hawke that hath no liste to flee, and is become vnlustie or slouthfull.
NOwe and then it happeneth, that a hawke hath no lyst too flee, eyther bicause she is in euill keeping, that is to witte, of suche as knowe not howe to gyue hir hir ryghtes: as bowzing, bathing, and suche other things, whereof sometymes shee hath greate neede: or bycause the hawke is too hyghe, and full of grease, wherethrough shee becommeth coye: or contrarywise, bycause shee is too lowe and poore: or else by reason of some mishappe or disease whiche shee hath, that is vnknowen..
Therefore Master Cassian sayeth, if a hawke be vnlustie to flee, shee muste be vewed and perused by some one of good skill, and haue suche remedies ministred to hir, as she hath neede of, as well for bathing, as for bowzing: For in any wise water muste bee sette before hir.
And if shee bee high and not well enseamed, hir meate must be throughly washed, that it may skowre hir the better.
Or else if ye lyste, ye may gyue hir the foresayde medicine of Larde, Marrowe, and Saffron.
And if yee perceyue your Hawke to be sicke, or diseased, ye may vse the remedies sette downe heretofore, according to the seuerall natures of the diseases, tyll your hawke be in good plyght againe, as she was before.
Of the Hawke that hath broken hir wing by some mischaunce.
IT happeneth somewhile, that a hawke breaketh hir wing by mischaunce, as by bating against the ground, or otherwise.
Master Mallopin sayeth, that when a Hawke hath hir wing broken after that manner, yee muste take Sanguis draconis, Bole Armoniacke, Gum Arabicke, white Franckincense, whiche is called Olibanum, Masticke, Aloes Cicotrine, of each of them a like quantitie, and a reasonable quantitie of fine meale flower.
Make a powder of all the sayde things, tempering it with the white of an egge, and make thereof a playster, and laye it to the hurte, when yee haue firste sette it right agayne.
Then crosse hir wings one ouer another, as thoughe they were not broken, and maile hir well and faste, so as she may not stirre them, and lette the meate that you giue hir, be cutte in small pellettes.
Remooue not the plaister for seuen or eight dayes, and when yee laye on another, in any wyse beware that that wyng bee not remooued: For if it bee neuer so little remooued or displaced, your laboure is loste, and your Hawke marred for euer.
Therefore keepe hir in that order by the space of .xiiij. or xv. dayes, setting hir vpon a very softe Cushion, and lette hir meate bee good, and newe killed, and giue hir meetely good gorges of it, for shee needes not to be kept lowe, to recouer hir health the better.
Of a Havvke that hath had some blovve or stripe vpon hir vving.
SOmetymes a Hawke hathe a strype on hir wing by some mishappe, so as shee cannot afterwarde holde it ryght, but it hangeth alwayes downe, and lolleth: Master Casian sayeth, that yee muste take Sage, Myntes, and Pelamountaine, and boyle them all togyther in a new earthen pot full of good wyne, and when they bee well sodden, take the potte, and set it vppon hotte imbers, as close stopped as maye bee.
Then make a rounde hole of the bygnesse of an Apple, in the clothe that your potte is stopped withall, for the steame to issew out at.
Whiche done, take your Hawke vpon your fiste, and holde out hir hurte wing handsomely a greate whyle ouer the hole, that it may take the fume whiche seameth vp out of the potte.
Afterwarde, lette hir be well dryed by keeping hir warme by the fire, for if she should catche sodaine colde vpon it, it would becomme woorse than it was before.
Vse hir thus twyce adaye, for three or foure dayes togyther, and shee shall bee recouered.
Of the Havvke that hath hir vving out of ioynte.
WHen a Hawkes wing is out of ioynte, yee muste take hir handsomely, and put it vp, so as ye may sette it in his ryght place agayne.
Whiche done, laye a playster to it, made of Sanguis draconis, Boli Armeni, Masticke, and flower tempered togyther with the white of an egge, and maile hir vp, letting it lye by the space of fiue or sixe dayes, and it wyll bee whole.
IF a Hawke chaunce to haue hir pinion broken by treading vpon hir, or by striking agaynst some thing, Master Mallopin sayeth, that there is no better remedie, than the foresayde Receyte, made for hir wing broken: and that if neede be, shee must be mayled, that it may the better ioyne togither againe, and the playster renewed euery fiue dayes.
Or else let the hurt be splented by and by, and bounde vp with conuenient deuises for the purpose, giuing hir hir meate cut in smal pellets, lette hir continue maled, that she trouble not hirselfe with tyring.
Of the Havvke that hath hir legge or thyghe broken.
TAke Firre or Frankincense, pill of the barke of it, and beate it into powder, and mingle it with the white of an egge: if ye can, put in also a little Sanguis draconis, make a plaster of it.
Then deplume your hawkes thygh, and lay the playster to the broken place, taking good heede that yee binde it not too straight, for feare of fluxe and repaire of accidents to ye place, for so ye may do hir greate harme.
And for want of Firre, or Franckincense, take the barke of an Oke: for Firre is not to bee had in many places.
Afterwarde renewe your playster euery fiue or sixe dayes, till your Hawke be throughly whole, alwayes cutting hir meate to hir, as aforesayde, and keeping hir hooded.
And if it bee broken beneath the thyghe, laye the same playster to it, taking good heede, that ye binde it not too harde: for in so dooyng yee maye make hir foote to wither away, and mortifie the member, whiche is a very greate negligence.
For hawkes are dayntie birdes, and dayntily to be dealte withall.
Of the Hawke that is wounded with a stripe, or some other misfortune.
IF a Hawke happe to bee wounded by an Eagle, or any other byrde of praye, by crabbing togyther, or by encounter in fleeing: or by a iobbe with the truncke of a Crane, Hearon, or other water fowle: or by taking some greater blowe agaynste a tree or Rocke, whereby shee is greately payned, and in daunger to bee marred, if there bee not skyll to helpe hir with speede.
By Master Amé Cassians aduise, take the iuyce of the herbe called Culuerfoote, otherwise named Herbe Roberte: and if yee finde your Hawkes strype to bee greate and blacke, and yet that it hath no greate gashe, you muste make incision, and slytte the skinne a little more by your discretion, that ye may the more easily conuey in the sayd iuyce.
That done, laye a leafe of the same herbe vpon the wounde, to couer it, spreading the feathers handsomely againe ouer it, and lette it not bee remooued .xxiiij. houres after.
And know yee, that the sayde herbe hath suche vertue, that what wounde soeuer you laye it on, it shall neuer swell nor ranckle.
For wante of the herbe it selfe, take of the powder of it, and put it into the wounde, keeping it alwayes cleane, by washing it with a lyttle white wine, as is aforesayde.
And if ye see that the iuyce or powder of that herbe doe no good, take the medicyne that Mallopin speaketh of.
Take Oyle of Roses, and Capons greace, of eache a lyke quantitie, with a lyttle lesse Oyle of Violets, and lesse of Turpentine by the one halfe, and confecte them all togyther.
Then take Masticke and Franckincense in powder, of eache alyke: and if yee can finde the sayde herbe called Culuerfoote, drye it, and beate it into powder also: and when you haue serced your powders, putte them into the sayde Capons greace, and styrre them togyther with a stycke, tyll they bee throughly incorporated, and so shall your Vnguent bee perfecte.
And the chiefe Falconers saye, you muste make handsome tentes of Cotton, bestowing on them this vnguente, and so applie them to ye wounded places of your hawke from time to time, tyll they be recured.
And if the Hawkes skinne be muche broken or torne, yee must sowe it vp handsomely, leauing a little hole in one side for an issew, which you must keepe open with a tent noynted with the foresayd vnguente, till it be throughly whole.
Master Michelin setteth downe another medicine, saying, that if a Hawke happen to haue a strype or a wounde, you muste plucke awaye the feathers rounde aboute the hurte place, and that if the wounde bee so deepe, as it can by no meanes bee stytched vp: ye muste put of the powder hereafter following, into it.
Take Sanguis draconis, white Franckincense, Aloes Cicotrine, and Masticke, and of those foure being all in like quantitie, make a fine powder, and laye it vpon the wounde, and afterwarde annoynt it rounde aboute with Oyle of Roses, or Oyle Olyue warme to comforte it.
And if the wounde bee not so large, but that it may well be stytched: sowe it togither agayne, leauing a little hole for an issewe.
Then make a playster with the whyte of an egge, and hauing firste annoynted it with the sayde Oyle, laye of the powder vppon the sore, and put a tente in it dypped in the sayde vnguente, to keepe the issewe, and laye your playster vpon it, dressing it after that manner styll, till your Hawke be sounde.
There is yet another medicine very good and auaylable, whiche is this.
Take the powder of fine Canell, whiche is nothing else but Cinnamon, and put it in the wounde, supping it afterward with good Oyle of Roses, or Oyle Oliue.
TAke halfe an ownce of Masticke, a quarter of an ownce of Bole Armoniacke, halfe an ownce of Roses, an ownce of Capons grease, an ownce of Oyle of Roses, an ownce of Oyle of Violets, and a quarter of an ownce of virgin waxe.
Of all these, let the things that may be molten, bee molten togither: and let those things that are to be beaten into powder, be beaten to fine powder.
And when ye haue streyned all your liquors into a newe pot, put your powders into them, stirring them about wt a sticke, till they be well incorporated togither, taking good heede that ye put not too much fire vnder your pot, and so shall your vnguent be perfect.
Whiche you may vse in handsome pleggets for your hawke, tenting hir wt smal tents dipped in the same vnguent, after the maner mentioned in the former receyte, till she be throughly recured.
And if your Hawke be hurte or broosed without any skinne broken, take the powder of Mummie, myngled with the bloud of a wood Culuer, or of a Pullet, and conuey it into hir throte, so as she may receyue it downe, and twoo or thre houres after, gyue hir a reasonable gorge of good meate.
If the broose bee apparant, annoynt it with good oyle of Roses, and if nede require, for the largenesse or sorenesse of hir woundes, let hir bee mailed, as is afore sayde, for hir more quiete, and more speedy recouerie.
IT happeneth diuers times, that hawkes haue a swelling in their feete, that commeth by chasing of their feete in fleeing their praye, in striking it, by taking cold vpon it, for want of rolling the perche with some warme clothe: or rise bicause they be full of grosse humors, and fowle within, whiche humors beeing remooued by their labour and trauell in fleeing, drop downe vpon their feete, and there swell, specially in Sacres more tha~ in any others.
For they be of their owne nature very heauie Hawkes, and haue grosse feete.
Againe, it happeneth sometimes that a Hawke pricketh hir selfe vpon a thorne by russhing into bedges bushes ouer ventrously, wherevpon followe suche swellings as are daungerous, and harde to bee cured.
Therefore Master Cassian sayeth, that when a hawke is in that taking, she muste be skowred three mornings togither with the pilles of Larde, Marowe, Suger, and Saffron, and sette in the Sunne, and fedde twoo dayes after with some good meate.
Then must ye take Bole Armoniacke, Sanguis draconis, lesse by one halfe, make it in powder, temper them wel togither with the white of an egge, Rose water, and annoynt hir feete with it three or four dayes twice aday, setting hir vpon some cloth to keepe hir feete warme.
And if this medicine do hir no good, take this that followeth.
Mallopin sayeth, that if a hawkes feete be but swolne, haue not any knubs in the ball of the foote, take a payre of Sizzers or coping yrons, cope the talons of hir swolne foote, till the bloud folow which done, take Capons grease, oyle of Roses, oyle of Violets, of eche alike, twice asmuch of Bole Armoniack.
Whe~ ye haue mingled the~ all wel togither, make therof an vnguent, anoynt your hawkes feete therwith twice aday til they be throghly whole, alwaies setting some soft warm thing vnder hir fete.
And if this do hir no good, then trie the receites aboue mentioned, till your hawke be throughly recured.
SOmetimes a hawke hath hir legges swollen, and sometime hir thighes, not hir legges: that co~meth either by ouerlaboring hir selfe in fleeing, or by ouermuch seazing hir praye, and by taking colde vpon it.
Also by like labour and bating, the humors beeing styrred within hir, droppe downe to hir thyghes and legges, and thereof commeth this swelling.
Wherefore firste let your hawke be skowred with ye pilles made of Larde, Marow, Suger, Saffron, then roste nyne or ten egges hard in their shells, when they be cold agane, take the yolkes of them, breake them with your hande in an yron possenet ouer ye fire.
The~ take an yron Ladle, and stirre them handsomly without ceassing, and when yee see them become blacke that ye would thinke they were mard and burnt, boyle them still, which done, gather them togither and presse out the Oyle of them, then heate them againe as before to presse out as much Oyle of them as is possible, and put it vp in a glasse.
And when ye mind to vse it for the sayd disease, ye muste take tenne droppes thereof, put thereto three droppes of vinegre, and three of Rose water, and mingle them well togither.
Thys medicine is singular good against al swellings of their thighs, legges, and feete, and moreouer it suppleth and mollifyeth their finewes.
But first ye must anoynt the swellings with a little Adiantum, and afterward with your Oyle prepared as aforesayd, till your Hawke be cured.
Of the svvelling in a Havvkes foote, vvhich vve tearme, the pin, or pin Goute.
DIuers times there rise vp knubbes vpo~ yt feete of Hawkes, as vpon the feete of Capons, which some call Galles, and some Goutes.
They come sometimes of the swelling of the legges and thighes, which haue spoken of before, or of other diseases that breede of the abundaunce of humors within the Hawke, which must first be scowred with the last mentioned pilles three or foure dayes togither.
And Master Amé Cassian sayth, that when a Hawke hath the sayd pinnes and gowtinesse in hir feete, ye must make round matches of paper as big as the agglet of a poynt, and seare or cauterise the pin rounde about.
And if the knubbe sticke farre out, yee maye slit it with a whot sharpe knife, and put a little slise of fatte Lard into the slit to keepe it open, and set your Hawke vpon a little heape of very fine salt.
And if there growe any dead fiesh in it, lay the powder of glasse, and two parts of Hermodactils vpon it, and when the Sore is skowred, anoynte it with Swines greace, and hony togither, always laying salt vnder hir feete to the end of your cure.
And to remedy the same, Mallopin in his Booke of the Prince sayth, that when a Hawke is gowty or hath the pin on hir feete, ye must take of Rew three ownces, of Barberies three ownces, of Colewort leaues three ownces, of Oyle of Violets a reasonable quantitie, of Turpentine two ownces, of Sheepes sewet as much shall serue, of the fatte of a yong Pullet one ownce and a halfe, of Virgin waxe one ownce, of Masticke one ownce, of white Frankincence one ownce, of Opopanax one ownce, and of Alome two ownces.
First strayne out the iuyce of the sayde Herbes brayed togither, then put thereto all youre other mixtures made into powder.
Which done, melt all your sewets togither in a new earthen potte, and put your iuyces and powders therevnto, stirring them continually with a sticke ouer a soft fire, and so cooling them by little and little, whereby your vnguent wyll become perfect, and you may keepe it two yeares good.
And whe~ ye occupie it, spread it plaisterwise vpon lether, or linnen cloth, laying it vpon the pin Goute, remouing it each other day till it be whole, for xv. dayes togither.
And if the pin open not of it selfe, slit it and open it with a little sharp launce of steele made whot, then clenze the filthie matter and quitture, and so shall your Hawke recouer assuredly.
Master Cassian setteth downe another good and wel tried receyte for the same, which is this: Take a quantitie of Turpentine, halfe as much white Sope, making the Sope into powder.
That done, make asshes of vineshreddes, and take therof somewhat lesse than of the powder of ye Sope.
Set these three mixtures togither vpon the coles in a new pot, and stirre them softly with a sticke till they be incorporate togither.
The~ make plaisters thereof, and bestowe them on the pinnegoute, so as they may not fall off, nor be remoued by the Hawke, shifting them euery two dayes till fifteene dayes be past, and that the disease growe to maturation.
Afterward you may slit the pinne, drawing out all the matter and quitture cleane, but let your launce be somewhat hote wherewith you slit it, and if the pin open of it selfe it is better.
After this, you must applie another plaister of Diaculum magnum, whiche you shall find at the Apoticaries: for it is a great drawer, and if it haue any dead flesh in it, lay a little Verdegrece to it, for that is a corrosiue, and a fretter.
Martin sayeth, that to soften the pinne on the Hawkes foote and to make it growe to a head, yee muste take the rootes of Flower deluce, which beares the blewe leafe, drie it and beate it into powder, and make thereof a Salue with honie of Roses, and lay it to the pinne till it be throughly whole.
Master Cassian sayth further, that if your Hawkes feete bee chafed and fall to swelling, take the fyling of yron beaten into powder, to the mountenaunce of a beane or twayne, and the quantitie of a beane of a gad of steele fyled into powder, and twice as much of the barke of an Oke as of the fyling of yron, of which barke of the Oke, you must take away the vttermost part, and of the rest make fine powder, serced through a cloth.
When yee haue mingled all these powders togither, boyle them in a new potte with a potle of good vineger, to the consumption of a third part.
Then let it settle, and put the cleerest of it alone by it selfe, and the groundes of it also by it selfe in a long narrow bagge, that the Hawke may rest both hir feete vpon it.
And with the water ye may vse to bath hir feete euery day three or foure times aday.
Likewise yee must wette and refresh the bagge with the same water, that the grounds may lie the closer vnder the feete of the Hawke, whych must stand vppon it night and day till she be recured.
And truely thys is good for all manner of griefes and swellinges of the feete.
Martin is of opinion that you must take halfe an ownce of Aloes and the white of an egge, with halfe an ownce and two penny weighte of Glewe, mingle them all togither, and put them in presse, so as all maye bee residence, and make thereof a playster, and laye it to youre Hawkes feete till there be some issue and vent, then anoynt them with soft Sope.
And when there hapneth any rupture, take Saltpeeter and Alome, of each two penny weight, making it into powder, bestowe it vpon the broken place to fret the dead flesh away, for this is a good corrosiue for that purpose.
THis inconuenience hapneth to Merlions in chiefe, aboue all other Hawkes, and to fewe or none else that ca~ reade of.
Master Cassian sayth it is a king of Formica which maketh them to eate their feete in that order.
For remedie heereof, make youre Hawke a Coller of Paper to conuey about hir necke, so as she may not touch hir feete.
Afterward take an Oxe gall, mingle it with a reasonable good qua~titie of Aloes, and anoynt youre Hawkes feete therewith twice or thrice aday, foure or fiue dayes, and it shall doe hir pleasure, and preserue hir from this euill.
If that do hir not good, then by Master Cassians aduice, take Swines dung, and putting it on a Tyle, set it to the fire or in an Ouen, bake it till ye may force it into powder.
Whiche done, wash your Hawkes feete with the purest and strongest vinegre that ye can find, afterwarde bestow hir feete in the same powder, doing so twice or thrice aday for xiiij. or xv. days till she be throughly recured.
The maner of the taking vp of Havvkes veynes vvhen an humor droppeth dovvne too fast on their feete.
WHen yee intende to stoppe the veynes that feede ill humors in your Hawkes feete, let hir be hand somly cast, then away with hir pendant feathers.
After that, force hir leg a little with your finger, and you shall see a good pretie bigge veyne vnder the knee.
Hauing found the vayne, take a needle and raise vp the skin a little, and make an issew at your discretion: but take good heede that ye touch not the veyne.
That done, take the Clee of a Bitttor, or of some other bird whatsoeuer, wherewith do lift vppe the veyne, and drawe youre silke threede vnder the veyne vppon the Clee, and knit it on the side towards the leg to the kneeward: for if ye cut it towardes the thigh aboue the knot, ye spoyle your Hawke.
Do no more to hir, but let it bleede as much as it will, remembring the nexte morning to anoynt it with Oyle, or Capons greace.
And bee ye sure that the taking vp of veynes is good and nedefull.
For afterward the humors powre not downe vppon their legges and feete.
thought good to set ye downe this maner of taking vp of vaynes, bycause haue vsed it my selfe, and recouered many Hawkes thereby.
For when a Hawke hath the veynes of eyther thigh once taken vp, the disease can no more returne, for want of the wonted supply of moyst humors, and crude matter that flowed vnto the place.
The maner of scowring, and vsing youre Hawkes when they are to be cast into the mewe.
WHen the time is come to cast Hawkes in the mewe, it is requisite and needefull to scowre them and to make them cleane.
For diuers times we see, that fowle feeding of Hawkes in lewring and fleeing time, ingendreth the Filanders and other diseases in them, whereof they perish for want of care and cure in due time.
Wherefore Master Michelin sayth that when ye intend to cast your Hawke into the mewe, ye must make three pittes of the bignes of a beane, of the foresayd mxture of Larde, Marowe, Suger, and Saffron, which you may giue hir three mornings togither, not feeding hir in two houres after, but suffring hir to gleame.
Then giue hir some good flesh and reasonable gorge, setting hir all the while at the fire, or in the Sunne.
And for other three mornings after that, you must giue hir the mountenance of a beane of Aloes Cicotrine when she hath cast, keeping hir likewise by the fire or in the Sunne, and she will cast the Aloes with grosse slime and filthy stuffe.
Likewise, Aloes being giuen towardes night enwrapped in hir casting, is very good against the Fila~ders.
This done, and performed, as haue tolde you, ye may cast hir into the mew.
Master Amé Cassian sayth that for the same purpose ye must conuey the quantitie of halfe a hazel nutte of Ierapigra into a hennes gutte, knitte fast at both ends, and force it into your Falcons throte, holding hir on the fist by the fire or in ye Sun, till she haue skowred, and so keepe hir emptie and voyde till noone, at what time shee muste be allowed of some good hote meate a reasonable gorge: the next morrow feede hir well and after those two dayes cast hir into the mew without any moe ceremonies or circumstance.
Artelowch aduiseth you, that the mewing of a Hawke naturally, with yong Rattes, Mice, Dogges flesh, Pigeons, Rabbets, and other holesome fowles, is farre better, than to vse any arte in the matter, or suche superstitious practises, as you may perhaps reade some, and heare of many.
Truely am of his opinion, and so doe perswade you, that will mewe youre Hawkes in good order: for haste in that case, maketh waste, as in all other things.
The best thing that you may do, when you meane to caste hir into the mew, is first, to skowre hir well, after that manner that haue shewed you in this booke, to cope hir well, and to set hir vp in flesh before you cast hir into the mew, to discharge hir of al disease as neare as you can, to rid hir of mites lice, being once in the mew, to set hir water sometimes, to feede hir with liquide and laxatiue meates now and then, and to omit none of those instructions, which haue collected for you out of the Italian Falconers: for they are very good obseruations, specially for soare Hawkes, and Nyasses.
But in the French man Artelowch, finde one necessarye note for a Haggart, which is this.
The Haggart (saith he) is not to be cast loose into the mew, but to be mewed on the fiste, for otherwise she woulde become too coye and strange, and if she fall to bating and beating hir selfe for heate, then must you hood hir vp, or bespowte hir with colde water, the nexte way to make hir leaue bating.
Thus must you continue hir on the fiste, till she begin to shed hir feathers, then shall it bee good to set hir downe, and tie hir to a stone, or pearch, as you do the rest.
And after she hath mewed, and commes to flee, then if you let hir stand on a blocke, or billet, cased and rolled with cloth, you shall do very well.
Goshawkes, Tiercels, Sparowhawkes, must be mewed as Falcons, saue that they wil not be borne on the fiste, but be at libertie in the mewe, and very clenly serued.
Before you draw your Hawke out of the mewe, fifteene or twenty dayes, you must begin to bate hir of hir diet, the sooner and better to enseame hir, by restraint of hir ful feeding, which she had before, for otherwise, there woulde followe surfet and repletion, than which there is no more daungerous euill.
It is no slender part of skill, so to vse a Hawke in the mew, as she may bee quitte of all mishappes, that befall hir in the mewe, if she bee not well attended and regarded, during the time she is in the mew.
The maner hovv to deale so vvith a Havvke in the mevv, as she may auoyde the mischaunces of the mevv, vvhich sundry times do happen, as vvell diseases, as other harmes.
IT hapneth diuers tymes that when Hawkes are in the mewe, some doe mewe well and some ill, so as some of their owne nature, and some by mishap, do fall to be diseased, or otherwise breake their feathers, and cast them not all the yeere long.
As touching this matter, Master Mallopin in hys booke of the Prince, sayth: that when youre Hawke meweth not well and kindly: go in May to a slaughter house where Sheepe are killed, and take the kernelles that are vnder theyr eares right against the end of the iawebone, of the bignesse of an Almond.
Choppe ten or twelue of those kernelles very small and giue them to your Hawke with hir meate, finding the meanes, by some way or other, that she may receyue them and put them ouer.
And when shee once beginnes to cast hir feathers giue hir no more of them.
WHen ye meene to further the mewing of your Hawke, take of the Snayles that haue shelles, stampe them shelles and all, strayning them through a cloth, and with the Oyle that comes thereof wash hir meate two or three tymes.
Also take of the Snayles that lie in running streames, gyue your Hawke of them in the morning: for that wil both scowre hir and nourish hir greatly, and setteth hir vp, and maketh hir to mewe apace.
Master Michelin, in his Booke of the King of Cypres, sayth thus: Cut an adder in two partes and seeth him in water, and with that water and wheate togither fede your Pullets, Pigeons, Turtles, and other birds which you intende to allow your Hawkes that are slacke to mewe, and soone after they shall mewe their feathers apace.
Master Cassian sayth, that when a Falcon will not mewe, ye must take of Backes, otherwise called Reremice, and drie them so at the fire or in an Ouen, as yee may make them into powder, which you must bestow vpon your Hawkes meate.
Also take little sucking whelpes, and feede your Hawke with the flesh of them, steeped in the milke or renet, whiche you shall find in the mawes of them: afterward shred the mawe it selfe in small peeces, and force hir to take it, and she shall mew very well, and timely.
Likewise all maner of liue birds make a Hawke to mew well, for it is their naturall feeding, and therfore best for them.
Martin sayth, that to mew your Hawke well, ye must sette water by hir once or twice a weeke, and also rost Frogges in the fire, making them into powder, and bestowing it vpon hir meate.
Likewise small fishes chopped, and giuen with hir meate do further a Hawkes mewing very much.
Thus do the french Authors write, leaue them to youre experience, that lyste to follow the french fashion.
The maner of dieting and keeping Hawkes in the mewe.
WHen ye intend to cast your Hawke into the mew, yee must see the mew very cleane, then furnish your hawke with all hir implements, setting hir two or three times in the Sunne, taking good heede that hir furniture of hir legges bee not so streight, and vneasye, as she be driuen to be euer tearing at it.
Also you must cast hir into the mew high, lustie, and in good plight, well skowred, and fed with good hote flesh.
Again ye must now and then giue hir small fishes, specially to Goshawkes, Sparowhawkes, and all other rou~dwinged hawkes, bycause those fishes be (as my Author tearmeth them,) laxatiue, and good to skowre, setting them water twice or thrice a week.
For now and then they will bowze, by meanes whereof they discharge their bodies of humors, and also their bathing in it maketh them the better penned and the firmer.
Yong Rattes, Mice, and Swallowes, are very good feeding for a Hawke, for they bee nourishing meates, and will keepe the Hawke in good plight.
Therefore let your Hawke be mewed in a place that is cleane, handsome, and well kepte, for she wil reioyce, and delight greatly in it.
Thus haue yee the manner of mewing your Hawke, after the opinion of the French.
WHen ye drawe your Hawkes out of the mewe, yee had neede to take heede that they bee not soo greasy: for sometimes when they be so, and set vppon the fiste vnhooded, they so take on, and heate themselues with bating, that they breake their greace within them, putting themselues in great daunger of death.
Wherefore my counsell is, that all mewed Hawkes should be well attended and fed with washt meate, foureteene or fifteene dayes before they bee drawen out of the mewe, to breede resolution of glitte, and grosse matter, whydx is in their panels, whereof they shall skowre the most parte by doing as is aforesaid, and so shall ye quit them of all danger.
Mallopin speaking heereof in his booke of the Prince, sayth, that if a Hawke be huge and greasy, when she is new drawe~, a man must not beare hir vnhooded.
For yee may well vnderstand, that if she feele the sunne, the aire, or the wind, she lightly falleth to bating and stirring, by meanes whereof she heateth hirselfe inordinately, and so runnes in daunger of deathe and spoyle by taking cold vpon it.
Wherevpon the Petifalconers and Nouices, which know not what it meaneth, saye that the Hawke perisheth by meane of hir mewing and thorough default.
And therefore when a Hawke is to be drawen out of the mewe, she must be well attended, and lookte too, that hir meate be washt, and regard had that she be not ouergorged.
And if happely she loze hir appetite and list to feede, take Aloes Cicotrine, and the iuyce of Barberies, and force hir to receyue it in the gut of a Hen.
Which done, hold hir vpo~ your fiste vntill she haue skowred, keeping hir emptie till noone: At which time giue hir some hote meate or bird, and the next day giue hir of a Hen, setting hir water to bathe: and assure youre selfe that this medicine is good against all wormes, and Filanders that may breede in the body of a Hawke.
Mallopin sayth that whe~ ye draw a Hawke out of the mew, ye must wash hir meate, feeding hir therwith by little little, and allow hir such flesh as is laxatiue, that shee may haue the lesse ioy to keepe it long, or stand vpon it, and to the end she be not proude or ouerhaught of hir drawing out of ye mew.
And therewithall shee must be dayly plyed and borne on the fiste.
Within few dayes after she is thus drawen, ye must skowre hir and ensayme hir with the foresayd medicine of Lard, Suger, Maree, and Saffron, with a very little Aloes: for if ye co~fect it with too much Aloes, ye shall bring hir ouerlowe.
Therfore giue hir of it euery day a pill, for three dayes togither: and therevpon set hir in the Sunne or by the fire, keeping hir emptie two or three houres after, then giue hir a reasonable gorge of a Pullet or of mutton.
Master Cassian sayth that some Falconers, after they haue ensaymed their hawkes in maner aforesaid, three or four days before they intend to flee, do giue them a pill of the bignesse of a beane, made in maner following.
They vse to take a little Larde, with the powder of Pepper, and asshes fifted and serced, of each alike much, and make therof a ball, conuey it into the hawkes beake, so as they inforce hir to take it down, if she wil not otherwise.
Which done, they hold hir hooded by ye fire or in ye Sunne, making hir to keepe the pill as long as they can, afterward do let hir cast it at hir pleasure.
By this meane yee shall set yt she wil cast grosse and flegmaticke humors, wherby hir panell and bowels will be discharged of much glit, and she become sound and cheereful, and ready to flee hir pray.
And an houre or twayne after this, they feede hir with a liue chicken: for ye must note, that the pill which she hath receyued, hath distempered hir very much.
Neuerthelesse must giue you warning, that you must not so deale with a poore and low hawke, as ye would with a hawke that is high and in pride.
In doing after this maner, your Hawke shall be lustie, and enioy hir all the yeare after.
For hardly shal yt hawke do hir parte in fleeing that yeare, whiche is not well skowred, carefully ensaymed.
VVhen Aloes is to be giuen to Hawkes that are fleeing.
MAny are of opinion that when Hawkes are fleeing, they must haue Aloes Cicotrine giuen them from mooneth to mooneth, conueying the quantitie of a beane thereof into their meate, or into a Hennes skinne, to take away the bitternesse thereof, that they may keepe it as long as may be, before they cast it, then setting them al the while by a fire or in the Sunne, til they haue cast the slimie and grosse humors with the Aloes.
And if ye minde to keepe your Hawke from the wormes and the Filanders, giue hir the mountenaunce of a peaze of Aloes euery eyght dayes in hir casting.
Againe, ye must remember, that whensoeuer you perceyue youre Hawke waxe anye thing cold, to giue hir fiue or sixe cloues of maces, and they will skowre hir head of all watrie humors: moreouer beeing giuen at euening in a little cotton as yee giue the Aloes, they be very good and auaylable against all maner of Filanders.
Hawke doth sometimes breake a talon by some mischance, and often by the rudenesse and churlishnesse of the Falconer in vnseazing hir roughly from hir pray, in somuch that hir talon taryeth behind in the thing that she seazed on, and somtimes is quite broken or sliued from the flesh, by reason whereof she is in daunger of spoyle, or at leastwise of lozing hir talon.
When a Hawkes talon is so sliued off, as ther remaineth nothing but the tender part that was within it: make a little pretie lether gloue of the bignesse of hir stretcher or clea, and fil it with Capons greace and drawe it on, tying it handsomly to hir leg with two pretie strings, renuing it euery other day till the poynt of hir stretcher be well hardned againe.
And if a Hawke happen to haue but a peece of hir talon broken off, so as some part of it remayneth still behind, let it be anoynted with the fatte of a Snake, and it will growe againe as the others.
And if the Hawke be hurt by violence, so as the talon is become looce from the flesh, and falles to bleeding: then first of all cast the powder of Sanguis draconis vppon it, and it will staunch the bloud out of hand: and if it swell or rancle after it, then dresse it anointe it with Capons greace or honie of Roses till it be throughly recured.
In these hurts of Hawkes talons, Martine giueth this cou~sell following.
Make little matches of paper and sere therwith the stretcher that hath lost his talon, and bind the cindre of the same paper with a little honnie to it, and let it so rest nyne dayes togither.
And if the talon be quite bereft, put on the foresayd gloue with Capons greace, till the pownce be growen againe, and lette the Hawke rest till shee bee throughly sound.
And if the Hawkes foote or leg chaunce to rancle, and growe to further inconuenience, confect the vnguent of Capons greace, Oyle of Roses, Oyle of Violets, Turpentine, powder of Frankinsence, and Mastik, and anoint the swelling therwith, and let hir rest till she be throughly recured.
Of the Hawke that layes an egge in the mewe, or out of the mewe.
SOmetimes Hawkes are with egge in the mewe, and efte without the mewe, whereby they fall sicke and are in greate daunger if there be not remedie had for it: whiche thing you shall easly perceiue by them in May and April, at which times they are wont to be with egge.
To remedie this inconuenience, let the Hawkes meate be washed in the vrine of a manchild of sixe or seauen yeares old, eight or nine dayes togither, and that will keepe hir from laying.
But if the egges be already full fashioned within hir, then to breake and dispatche them, yee muste (as Master Martin sayeth,) giue hir the yolkes of a couple of egges reere rosted with butter, twice or thrice a weeke: and that muste bee done during the mooneths of May and Aprill.
For besides that it will breake and wast away the egges within a Hawke, it is good also to set them vp when they be lowe in state, howbeit you must remember that whensoeuer yee minister this medicine, yee muste giue them fleshe withall, for it is of great nourishment.
Againe, Mallopin sayth that to breake egges in a Hawke, ye must take of the liquor that bleedeth or oozeth out of vynes in March, when they be cut, and with that liquor wash youre Hawkes meate nine or tenne dayes, and the egges will consume waste away by yt meanes, how greate soeuer they bee.
FIrst you must beware that you take them not before they are somewhat woxen: for if ye do so, and bring them into a cold and moist place, they will haue a disease in the backe, so as they shall not be able to stand on their feete, and moreouer they shall be in daunger of vtter spoyle.
Therefore they muste not be taken, till they be somewhat strong, and can stand well on their feete.
And you must set them vppon some pearche or bayle of wood, that they maye by that meanes the better keepe their feathers vnbroken, and eschue the dragging of theire traines vppon the ground, for so shall they bee the better sunned.
Michelin sayth further, that to keepe Eyesse Hawkes from that inconuenience, specially when they bee taken ouer little, they must be kept in a drie and cleane place, yee must strewe euery where vnder them the herbe, that in (Frenche is called Yeble which hath a seede like Elder.
This herbe is of nature whot, and good against the goute, and the disease of the reines which might befall them: Wherefore if ye will keepe Hawkes well that are new taken from out of the nest, if ye take them in the morning, yee must let them stand emptie till noone: and if ye take them in the euening, yee muste not feede them till the next morrowe.
And when yee feede them, giue them tender flesh, and after that, lette them not stand emptie any more too long for hindering their feathers, and tainting them.
IF ye will knowe whether your Hawkes haue lice, or mites, set hir in the warme Sunne out of the winde, and by and by ye shall easyly perceyue it: for they will crall out vpon hir feathers and swarme there.
For remedie hereof take a quantitie of Orpinent beaten into very fine powder, and hauing mingled it with halfe asmuch powder of Pepper, lette youre Hawke be cast handsomly, that shee breake not hir feathers, then powder first the one wing and so the other gently, and finally all the whole carkasse of hir: after which, set hir vppon your fiste againe, bespoute hir, and squirt a little water on hir with your mouth, and set hir by a fire, or in the Sunne, till she be throughly wetherd.
Afterward when ye intend to feede hir, wash hir beake to take away the sauor of the Orpiment, and beware that your Hawke be not poore, when you intende to vse Orpiment.
Hauing thus done, you shall see that all the mites and lice will discouer them selues vpon hir feathers and die, eyther the Orpime~t alone, or the Pepper alone are as good as both of them togither to spoyle the mites.
But here is the oddes, the Pepper maketh the mites to shewe themselues, and then the Orpiment murdreth them.
When yee vse the Pepper alone, put thereto a thirde part lesse of Asshes, to abate the force of the Pepper, and so shall your Hawke be ridde of those vermine.
And assure your self yt no hawke which hath ye mites (be she neuer so good) is able to do hir duetie play hir parte, by reason of ye anoya~ce which she feeleth in hir feathers by the~.
And if ye would rid hir of the mites without washing hir, the~ my Author bids you take a very old Mauis or Blacke bird, hauing take~ out al the greace that ye can find in hir, anoynt your Hawkes feete and the pearch whereon ye set hir therewith, for all the Vermine will repaire downe to it: and therfore shift hir out of hir place twice or thrice in the nighte, that she may be no more troubled therewith.
Of the Hawke that holdeth not hir wings vp so well as she should do, but lolleth them.
IF a Hawke that is newly taken, be set straightwayes vpon a pearch or vppon the fiste of one that hath no skill to vse hir, she ouerheates hir selfe with bating, and afterward catcheth suche colde vpon it, as shee cannot recouer or trusse hir wings close to hir againe, nor be able to flee well.
Mallopin sayth, that to remedie this mischiefe, you must take of ye best vineger that is to be gotten, with your mouth spirt it vpon, and betwixte hir feathers, till she be throughly wet, taking good heede that none of it come in hir nares, and afterward set hir by the fire or in the Sunne, seruing hir so two or three dayes togither.
And if she recouer, doe nothing else to hir, but if shee recouer not, let hir bathe, eyther of pleasure or of force, and shee wyll trusse vp hir wings to hir, by meane of striuing with hir selfe.
Then let hir be set very warme by a fire or in the Sunne: for if she should chill vppon it, shee woulde become worse than before.
MArtin sayth, yee shall discerne the Crampgout by your Hawkes holding of hir one foote vpon the other, and by hir often knibbing and sobbing of hir foote with hir beake.
For remedie whereof ye must cast hir handsomly and let hir bloud on the veyne that is betweene the foote and the legge, and afterward anoynt the veyne with Capons greace or with Oyle of Roses.
To keepe a Hawke from all manner of Goutes, the Frenche mans opinion is this.
BY Martins aduise, if yee doubte that your hawke shall haue the Goute, you must feare hir and cauterize hir, as hereafter followeth.
Take a small yron with a rounde button at the ende, as bygge as a Peaze, heate it redde hotte, and feare hir therewith, first aboue the eyes, then vpon the toppe of hir head, and thirdly vpon the balles of hir feete.
And this violent kind of dealing with hir, is the next and assuredst waye to do good in suche desperate diseases, if any helpe be to bee had.
But my Italian Author Sforzino, giueth ouer a hawke that is troubled with the Goute, and thinketh there is small credit to bee gotten by the cure, bicause of the impossibilitie.
IF your Hawke be bitten or stung of a venemous beaste, or woorme, make hir to receyue a little Tryacle, and powder of Pepper, and afterward feede hir with hotte meate two dayes: and beware that she touche no water for twentie daies after.
Or else burne a Frogge, and beate hir into powder, and put thereof vpon Cattes fleshe, and gyue it your Hawke.
These are straunge remedies and rare, and of the Frenche deuise.
Giue your iudgement of them, and by tryall you shall knowe what they will do.
finde them in my Authour, and therefore do sette them downe, and not for any experience haue had of them.
IF your hawke be hurt by any mischaunce, and the mouth of the wounde very small, ryppe it larger, and skowre it with white wyne, laying theron a playster of white Frankincense, and Masticke, and annoynte it rounde aboute with butter, Oyle of Roses or Oyle Olyue.
treatise and briefe discourse, of the Cure of Spanels, vvhen they be any vvaye ouerheatte: deuised and written by Master Francesco Sforzino Vicentino, the Italian, Gentleman Falconer.
[Figure: [Figure: depiction of men with dogs and bird] HOwe necessary a thing a Spanell is to Falconrie, and for those that vse that pastime, keping Hawkes for their pleasure recreatio~, deeme no man doubteth, as well to spring and retriue a fowle being flowen to the marke, as also diuers other wayes to assiste and ayde Falcons and Goshawkes.
Wherefore, seeing that hythertoo in my collection, haue spoken altogyther of Hawkes, bothe for the Ryuer and field, and in my conceyte, haue lefte fewe needefull poyntes for a good Falconer, vntouchte or treated of: nowe shall not do amisse, nor wander ouer wyde from my purpose, if saye somewhat of Spanells, without the which a Falconer, (specially vsing to flee the fielde) cannot be, without mayme of his pastime, and impayre of his gallant glee.
And againe, for that they are subiect to many diseases and plagues, (as we commonlye terme them) for dogges, and longer than they are without infection, we may expect from them no pleasure, assistance, or recreation: wyll onelye in this treatise describe you their harmes, with cures due to the same.
Among all whiche, place the Mangie firste, as the capitall enimie to the quiete and beautie of a brane Spanell, wherewith they poore dogges, are oftentymes greately plagued, bothe to the infection of their fellowes, and the no slender griefe of their masters.
The waye to cure and discharge a Spanell of the Mangie, is to annoynte him eyther at the fire, or in the Sunne, thryce euery other daye, with an vnguent made of Barrowe flicke one pownde, common Oyle three ownces, Brimstone well brayed foure ownces, salte well beaten and broosed, ashes well syfted and sierced, of eyther twoo ownces, boyling all these in a Kettle or potte of earth, mingling them well togyther, tyll the barrowe flicke bee incorporate and well compounded with the reste.
With this vnguente thus made and confected, annoynte and besmeare all the bodie of your Spanell, and euery other parte of him, shifting his litter and kennell often, the oftener the better.
And lastely, hauing thus done, washe him ouer and ouer with good strong lye, and it will mortifie and kill the Mangie.
But if perhappes (as commonly it falleth out) the Spanell loose hir heare, though it proceeded not of the force of this vnguent and strong medicine, yet it shalbe very good to bathe your Spanell, shredding his heare in this order, with the water of Lupines, or Hoppes, and to annoynte hym with stale barrowes flicke.
This medicine, ouer and besides that, it cureth and quitteth the Mangie, it also maketh the Spanells skinne beautifull fayre to looke to, and kylles the flies, the dogges disquieters and enimies, to his ease.
But when this foresayde remedie is not of force sufficient to rydde the mangie, but that it spreddes and getteth greater power and dominion ouer your Spanell: then doth it behooue you to deuise a farre stronger medicine, whiche is, to take of strong Uineger twoo quartes, or as muche as will suffise, co~mon Oyle sixe ownces, Brimstone three ownces, sutte of a chimnie or potte, a quantitie of sixe ownces, brayed salte and serced, twoo handfulls: boyle all these aforesayde in the Vineger, vsing the former order of annoynting your Spanell in the Sommer tyme.
If neither of these remedies aforesayde wil serue the turne, then for a laste refuge, you muste be dryuen to practise with a farre stronger, than eyther of both.
But in any wise, this medicine muste not bee ministred in the colde of Winter, for it will then put the Spanell in greate hazard of death.
Take quicke Syluer, as greate a quantitie as shall suffise, and mortifie it with stale barrowes flicke, or Larde, as if shoulde sette you downe this proportion: Of Quicke Syluer, twoo ownces, Barrowes grease ten ownces, myngle them well togyther, vntill they be incorporated: with this vnguent annoynte your Spanell in the Sunne, tying him afterwards for the space of an houre in the Sunne, to the ende the vngue~t may syncke in, and pierce the deeper.
Then washe him twice with blacke Sope, and obseruing this order of annoynting him euery other day twyce or thrice, assuredly you shall rydde him of all Manginesse, whatsoeuer it be.
But muste tell you this by the way, that this vnguente of Quicke Siluer, will cause hir heare to fail away.
Wherefore it shall be requisite, euery third or fourth day, to annoynt him with stale Bacon grease, for that will presently make his heare to growe and come againe.
If a Spanell be not very muche infected with the Mangie, then is it and easie matter to cure it in this sorte: To make a kinde of breade with wheaten branne, and the rootes, leaues, and fruite, or flouers of the herbe which we call Agrimonie, beating it well in a morter, and making it into a paste or dowe baking it in an ouen, and so made to giue your Spanells of the sayd breade, as muche as they lyst to eate, and none other breade at all for a time.
With foure or fiue of these loaues of breade, made in manner as tell you, haue cured my Spanels of the mangie, and some other of my friendes.
Though euery body for the most part, do know these common herbes, yet neuerthelesse will follow mine Author, and set it downe with the same description as he doth.
Agrimonie, is an herbe that growes in meadowes fields, neare vnto some roote of a tree, and vppon the mouth of sawe pittes, and other olde vncleane and vnoccupied places.
The leaues of it do spreade vpon the grounde, they are a shaftment in length, iagged on eache side, like vnto the leafe of Hempe, diuided into fiue or moepartes and braunches, indented rounde aboute.
It brings foorth one or twoo blackishe stalkes, vppon whiche there are certayne boughes, standing one distant from another, on whiche there are yellowe floures, and those floures, beeing through rype, doe yeelde certayne rounde berries as bygge as a Peaze or Fatche, whiche wyll cleaue and hang to a mans garmentes, if hee once touche them.
This description doth my Italian Authoure make of the herbe Agrymonie, whereof he woulde haue this bread made to cure the mangie Spanell.
leaue it ouer to thy vse and discretion, till thou neede it.
Of diuers accidentes that happen to dogges, and first of that ill, which is called Formica.
EVery man dothe knowe, that there is a kinde of vyle disease that lyghtes vppon Spanels eares, whiche dothe greatly vexe them, in the Sommer tyme especially with the flyes, and the scratting and tearing themselues with theyr owne feete.
We terme it in Englishe, a kinde of Mangie, but bothe the Latinist, and the Italian terme it Formica.
The Frenche man hee calleth it, Fourmyer, whiche in trouthe is in Englishe nothing else but an Ante, or Pysmere, applyed heere in this place to a dogges disease, for some likelyhoode and propertie betwixte the Pysmere and the mischiefe, whiche is accustomed to creepe and go further and further, with his infection, to the greate anoyance of the poore Spanell, euen as the Pysmere is euer busie, trauayling too and fro, and neuer vnoccupied.
The waye to rydde this vyle disease and mischiefe, is to bestowe vpon the infected place, a medicine made of Gumme Dragaganthe, foure ownces, infused in the strongest Vyneger that may bee gotten, by the space of eyght dayes: and afterwardes broosed on a Marble stone, as Paynters do their coloures, adding vnto it, Roche Alome and Galles, beaten to powder, of eyther twoo ownces.
Vsing these things as haue shewed you, you maye make a powder of marueylous force: for this purpose, laying it vppon the member where the Mangie lyes.
There droppeth downe an humor from their braynes, by meane of whiche their throates and neckes do swell vnreasonably.
For remedie of this, wyll aduise you to take nothing more, than to annoynte all the place withoute with Oyle of Camomil, then washing and embroching the dogges throate rounde about the griefe with Vineger not ouerstro~g, and with Salte.
If you do this, you shall recouer your Spanell, and dryue awaye this distillation of ill humors, that fall out of the Spanels heade, causing the greate swelling in the throate.
Of a kinde of woormes, breeding in the hurtes and mangie partes of a Spanell.
SOmetymes when a Spanell hath taken a hurt or wounde, there do ingender in the wounde certaine woormes, that do hinder the cure of the hurt, causing it to continue at one staye, or to growe woorse and woorse.
Wherefore it shall be very necessarie to endeuour to kill them, which you shal do assuredly, if you conuey into the wounde nothing but the gumme of Iuie, called in Latine, (Gumma Hederae) keeping it there for the space of one day or twoo, washing the wound with wine, and after that annoynting it with Bacon grease, Oyle of earthwoormes, and Rewe.
Moreouer, a iuyce made of the greene pilles and ryndes of Wallnuttes, or the powder of dryed Lupynes is very good.
Likewise powder of wylde Cucumbers, is excellent to kyll those woormes: and not that alone, but it will play the parte of a Corrosyue, fretting awaye the deade fleshe, and encreasing the good.
But when the woormes growe within the body of a Spanell, they muste bee killed in this manner, with an inwarde receyte.
Cause your Spanell, eyther by loue or force, to eate, when hee is fasting, the yolke of an egge, with twoo scruples of good Saffron beaten into powder, confected with the sayde egge, keeping him after it from meate, till night.
When a Spanel is hurte, as long as hee can come to licke the wounde with his tongue, he needes no other remedie.
But when he cannot possible licke it, then suche woundes as bee not venemous, you maye resolue with the powder of Matresilua, dryed in an Ouen, or in the Sunne.
And if it be the byte of a foxe, it shall suffise to annoynte it with Oyle, wherein earth wormes and Rewe haue bene boyled togither.
But if it were bytten by a madde dogge, it shall bee beste presently to thruste through the skinne of his heade and poll with a hotte yron, iuste betwixt the eares, so as the fire may touche bothe sides of the hole made: And after that, with your hande to plucke vp the skynne of the dogges shoulders and flanckes backewardes, thrusting it through with the hot yron in like manner.
The gyuing of this vent to the wounde, will greatly pleasure the Spanell, and is a ready way to cure him.
Besides the application of this canterie and fire, there is one other approued remedie, and that is, to cause your Spanell to lappe twice or thrice of the brothe of Germander, and eate the Germander it selfe boyled.
neede not to describe the herbe, it is so well knowen: but my Author settes oowne his proportion and floure.
It beares a iagged leafe, and hath a purple or blew floure, and in shape it is like a little Oke.
This herbe Germander, sodden and confected with salte Oyle, eyther simply broosed togither, or made into a paste, and giuen vnto a Spanell, will do him very much good in the cure of the byte of a madde dogge.
Nowe and then Spanels, by meane of too muche reste and grease, and some other accident besides, doe loose their sense of smelling, so as they ca~not spring or retriue a fowle after their accustomed maner.
In this case it shalbe very good, to skowre a Spanell in this manner.
Take Agaricke twoo drammes, Sal gemma one scruple, beate these into powder, and incorporate them with Oximel, making a pill as bigge as a nutte, conuey the pill into butter, and so gyue it the Spanell, eyther by loue or force, as he may swallowe it.
This will bring him to a quicke sente and sense agayne, as haue oftentymes approued.
To cut off the tip of a Spanels tayle or sterne.
IT is verie necessarie to cutte off a little of the Spanels tayle, when it is a whelpe for sundry occasions: for in so doing, you shall deliuer him, and be a meane that no kynde of woorme or other mischiefe shall greatly offende that parte of your Spanell: Whiche, if it be not cutte a little at the verie poynte and toppe, is subiect to many euils and inconueniences, and wyll be a cause that the dogge will not dare to prease ouerhastily into the couert after his game.
Besydes the benefite of it, the Dogge becommes more beautifull by cutting the toppe of his sterne: for then will it bushe out verie gallantly, as experience will teache you.
It shall be good when Spanell whelpes are one moneth olde or somewhat more, to worme them vnder the toung: for there haue they a string verie like vnto a worme, which must be pluckt away by some deuise or other.
If it bee a whelpe of a moneth olde, they take him and open his flew and iawes with a mannes hande: but if it be a bigger Spanell, then do they conuey a rounde sticke into his mouthe, to keepe it wyde open: which done, they plucke out the Dogges toung, and with a sharpe knyfe of purpose for it, they slitte the toung all alongst where the worme lyes, on bothe sydes, and so verie artificially with the poynt of the knife, they rayse vp the worme the better to pull it away.
But in this case there muste be care vsed, that the worme be not cut asunder, but had cleane awaye, without leauing any parte of it behynde.
Some men do vse (in the taking away of this woorme in a Spanels toung a needle or suche lyke instrument with a double twisted threede hanging to it, two shaftmentes in length, thrusting the needle quite vnderneath the worme iust in the middle of it, drawing the needle so farre vntill the double twisted threede be leuell with the middle of the worme, then drawing it harde with the hand, they pull it out (but by not drawyng the threede artificially, many tymes the worme breakes in two peeces, and then it is a verie harde matter to come by that parte that is slipte and left behinde.
Wherfore in myne opinion, the first is the better way to dispatche him cleane.
For when this worme is once quite drawne out, the Spanell will become farre the fairer, and waxe fatter.
Many tymes the want of worming doth keepe a Spanell poore, and out of flesh, so as he can not proue.
And (as auncient writers affirme) the worming doth discharge the Spanell of madnesse and frenesse (which can hardly credite or beleeue: the infection and biting of an other madde Dogge beeing so venemous, as it is able to worke great effecte in the Dogge, that is bitten.)
Thus muche thoughte good to write of Spanels, and their diseases and cures, for that they are superintendantes, and necessarie seruantes, both for the Hawke and the Falconer, without whome, the sporte woulde bee but colde, and the toyle farre more than it is to the man.
Wherfore it shall not be amisse for a good Falconer, always to breede and keepe of the beste kynde of Spanels that he may come by, and so to respect them, as they heate not at any tyme: Or if they doe by misfortune or negligence of your lackey boye, then to regarde their cure, which may be done in manner as haue heere sette downe: And withall to vse due correction to the boy.
For a good Spanell maketh a good Hawke, and a curst maister, a carefull footeman.
LO Reader here, the ende of this my booke, Though not the ende of my good will and loue, Bestowe thy paynes hereon a while to looke, As imployed my head for thy behoue: It shall suffice if thou do not reproue This slender worke, compilde for thy delight, VVhose friendly looke my labour shall requight.
count my toyle and trauayle but a game, deeme the dayes not long or spent amisse, If so may vnto thy fancie frame This booke of mine which all of Hawking is, Than which there can be founde no better blisse In my conceyte to such as loue the glee, And force the fieldes where brauest pleasures bee.
must confesse, my Hammers haue but hewde That royall Rocke, which others founde of yore, do but tread the pathe which others shewde Vnto their friendes, to make their skill the more: but translate a garment made before: VVhich if do with gallant shape to vewe, deeme as much as if made a newe.
For harde it is to stalke in others steppes, He thinkes himselfe a thrall that marcheth so: He iumpes in ioy that at his pleasure leapes, And is not forst in others feete to go: Nothing more leefe than libertie you knowe, VVhich no translatour hath vndertake, Vnlesse that he his Authours sense forsake.
VVhich vaunt dare, seldome here haue done, Zforcino knowes, and can controll me then, Italian borne, whose booke ouerronne, And Giorgies eke compilde with learned pen, Assuredly these two were skilfull men, And wist full well what Hawkes and hawking ment, And all things else that further this intent.
To Tardiffe eke the Frenchman, appeale, To Malopyn, and Mychelyn, cunning wightes, Let Artelowche be witnesse howe deale, In fielde affayres, or else in riuer flights, And Cassyan eke who well of hawking wrytes: All these wishe as Iudges in the case VVhere corrupt or alter any place.
Some men perhappes will wonder that wrote Of stately Hawkes, and byrdes of rare delight, And blazde it out but in so base a note, As scarce will please the gallant Courtiers sight, VVho weyes no golde that is not burnisht bright: His curious eare but hardly will dygest, Sweete Musickes sound, that is not of the best.
For mine excuse and for my simple pen, To answere thus, feare shall be faine, Sith charge of Hawkes committed is to men, That nobles serue for yearely hire, and gaine, (VVho are not fine but homely mates and plaine) My purpose was, to set them downe the trade, To man their Hawkes, and howe they might be made.
For Peeres (I knowe, and you must needes agree) Regarde no more but onely to beholde The fleeing Hawkes, their ioy is but to see The haughtie haggarde worth hir weight in golde, To slay the sowle at brooke with courage bolde, VVith Hawkes they neuer deale in other sort, Their seruants feede, and they enioy the sport.
VVhich if be so, the lowe and playnest stile Doth best agree the Falconers minde to fitte, To carpe it fine with those that haue no guile, ieast it were and signe of slender witte, The wryters ought the readers vaine to hitte.
This was the cause wrote my booke so plaine, tolde it earste, tell it nowe againe.
The modest minde knowe, will rest content, VVith this excuse, and brooke mine answere well, Of other some perhappes shall be shent.
VVhose sullen breasts vvith secrete enuie swell, VVho pleaseth all deserues to beare the bell.
But if the Courtier fancie this my booke, scorne the prowde disdaynfull Momus looke.
Falkners farewell, at pleasure do peruse These leaues and lines, eche picture and eche page.
Readers adue, haue no farther newes, can but wish you auncient Nestors age, Vnto whose doomes my wrytings here gage: To cure your Hawkes or make your cunning more, If ought be here, clappe my handes therefore.
My Muse, and I, haue done the best we can, To learne you howe your Hawkes to lewre and man.
GEntle Reader, if Argus with all his eyes shoulde pervse an impression, yet some thing mighte of him bee vnseene: so must of force confesse sundry faultes to haue escaped in printyng this booke of Falconrie, by whiche some places are made obscure, and sundrie termes quite abused, contrarye to the Authors meaning and myne: whiche is not my small griefe, neyther yet coulde muche helpe the same, the copie being obscurely penned and not legible in sundrie places, for that it was the translaters originall.
And therfore when haply they do occurre, or that thou lyght on them, blame not the booke or me, but runne ouer to the Errata, where thou shalte be satisfyed in euery pointe, as hereafter ensueth.

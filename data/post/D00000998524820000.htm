a position maintained by i.b
before the late earle of hvntindon viz
priests are executed not for religion but for treason
it is not to be denied that priests are executed for affirming the popes primacy and reconciling to the pretended church of rome which are points of their supposed religion but yet they are not executed for these or like points or partes as they be religious but as they be trayterous or dangerous to the state in ciuill consideration

for if priests were executed for these or like points as they be religious then the church would proceed against them in ecclesiasticall maner before the secular power execute ciuill punishment

as against anabaptistes and other in this queenes raigne hath bene performed
so that priests their case differeth from hackets only secundum magis minus the one being more dangerous in ciuill consideration then the other

secondly they should be executed as wel for affirming the popes primacy and reco~ciling as story for his misdemeanure though beyond seas
for such affirming the primacie and reconciling are as damnable in religious consideration on one side of the seas as on the other but not so dangerous to our state in ciuill consideration
thirdly they should be executed as well for other points of popery as giuing the glory of the creator to wit prayer and praise to creatures angels saints stockes and stones being no lesse damnable then such affirming the popes primacy and reconciling in religious consideration but not so dangerous to the state in ciuill consideration
as may appeare by a like case propounded

if anabaptistes denying magistracy and that christ tooke flesh of the virgen mary should swarme in england and if

magistrates should punish in a more ciuill manner of proceeding not the latter though no lesse damnable as it is religious but the former being more dangerous to the state in ciuill consideratio who would say that anabaptistes did suffer for religion and not for treason or felony

that affirming the popes primacy and reconciling may appeare directly to be dangerous to the state in ciuill consideration and therefore trayterous it is to be knowne and considered that pope pius quintus by his bull declaratory pronounced our gracious and christian queene an hereticke and excommunicated all such as yeeld obedience to her
if then the popes authority be perswaded as as a matter of conscience if by reconciliation her maiesties subiects become vowed members of such an head as is her capitall enemy we may be assured that so many as are so perswaded and reconciled are prepared to obey the pope and disobey the prince
is not then such affirming the popes primacy and reconciling dangerous to the state in ciuill consideration and therefore trayterous

in that say prepared it is yet further

to be knowne and considered that whereas the earles had ill successe in executing the said bull other deuises were frustrated and the hope of papists their present preuailing much failed parsons and campion english priests being to come into england to vrge the sayd bull and doubting that in the rigour thereof it would not be readily obeyed did craue and obtaine of pope gregory the thirteenth this exposition more plausible to papists but more dangerous to the state that the said bull may alway bind the queene and heretickes but catholikes that is papists in no sort things standing as they do but then onely when there may be publike execution thereof

philopater a louer of his country as he pretendeth by that fained name no englishman if ye will beleeue him yet descended of the english nation as he saith himselfe in a poysonfull and trayterous booke often printed in diuerse places beyond the seas such liking find such books with such subiects as papists be graunteth that priests are sent with authority from the pope

to pardon excommunicate reconcile and teach according to the bul expounded

that subiects are not to obey the queene in spirituall matters but in ciuill and that for the of things

what is implied in this last clause philopater himselfe discouereth when he saith

that it is agreed among diuerse lawyers and schoolemen that if a prince faile from the romane faith and endeuour to withdraw other subiects may and ought oppose themselues depose their princes if they haue force
which prouiso he inculcateth and vrgeth with this reason least religion should be indammaged and aduanced attempts not preuailing

the same philopater doth peremtorily pronounce as tyrannicall this question moued to priests fugitiues recusants and such like if the pope or other in his behalfe and cause of religion should inuade the land what part would you take the popes or the princes his reason of mislike is because a rich papist cannot answere freely thereunto without offence to god or caesar
as if god were offended if caesar defended against the pope

by which exposition of the bull doctrine of the priests and mislike of a question so necessary it doth clearely appeare

that the end of affirming the popes primacy and reconciling is to prepare her maiesties subiects to be ready vpon paine of excommunication to ioyne with such forces as shall be imploied against our queene and state in a pretended cause of religion
is not this dangerous to the state in ciuill consideration and therefore trayterous

let the affects and effects of such teachers and schollers be obserued and the truth of this assertion will be so euident as that nothing can be more manifest
to let passe their broad speeches when and where they dare their concealing and abetting traytours and trayterous designes as they may possibly without danger their reioycing at and spreading abroad newes importing successe to the pope though danger to the prince
to omit say these and many such arguments of their trayterous affection the shamefull practises of many bewray the popish preparation of most if opportunity once serue
many haue bene the conspiracies against her maiesties person to take away her life
but lord haue mercy vpon vs to perserue her
many haue bene the treasons

against the land to destroy it
but holy one of israel defend this thine inheritance
who haue bene the authors and actors of all these tragicall attempts but such teachers and schollers what were the rebels in the north and were they not prouoked to rebellion by nicholas morton priest sent from pope pius to vrge the execution of his bull what were the rebels in ireland and was not nicholas sanders a iudas that is a leader to the popes army that came in pretence to relieue the parry sommeruile went about to murther her maiesty
the one was encouraged in his diuellish enterprise by cardinal como in the name of the pope and shall we thinke that the other wanted the holy counsell of hall the priest arraigned babington and his complices conspired against prince and countrey
was not ballard priest a chiefe counsellour to them and did not bost priest keepe counsell at least as he lately if then teachers and scholers priests and papists concurre in seeking and following all oportunities to subuert our state can any other end be imagined of priests their perswading and reconciling but to prepare their schollers

to ioyne together against prince and countrey when force shall answere their affection

that the multitude of resolued papists be thus poysoned and prepared let this be your last consideration for this time and not the least at any time
that as the king of ashur purposing to besiege ierusalem

sent from lacish rabshaketh and others to weaken the hands of the people by disgracing their king hezechiah as one without religion in that he had taken away altars and defaced high places and by aduancing saneherib as one that preuailed against all gods
so these locusts which haue faces of men and haire of women

but the stings of scorpions in their tailes to wit priests who pretend a tender care of sauing soules in the beginning but intend a cruell destruction of life and land in the end are sent into this realme by their king the angell of the bottomlesse pit

out of the smoke thereof namely by the pope in his fume but without flame trust before inuasion intended to weaken the hands and withdraw the harts of the people from our gracious queene by disgracing her maiesty

as one without religion in that she hath taken away sacrificing altars and defaced religious houses and by aduancing their king as one that preuaileth against all gods all states all religions
the like practise of sending priests to prepare people against the comming in of spaniards is to be perceiued in scotland

what successe this deuise hath is also to be considered
the pope is certified by cardinall allen and the king of spaine by parsons the priests that there shall be found ready secretly within her maiesties dominions many thousands of able people that will be ready to assist such power as shall be set on land
of whose names they haue deliuered especially of such as dwell in port townes and on the sea coast with assurance that priests shall continue their reconciled people in their lewd constancy
so hath her maiesty published in her declaration anno
but philopater denieth it

how impudently and barely without any reason
but if ballard priest sent such a into spaine and throgmorton had gathered the names of popish noblemen and gentlemen to the same purpose it may

be in reason supposed that to priests intelligence is sent by priests what schollers they haue perswaded and prepared for treason and rebellion

to conclude
if the church proceed not against priests in ecclesiasticall maner before the secular power execute them

if priests suffer not for affirming the popes primacy and reconciling beyond seas

if priests be not executed for other points of popery no lesse damnable then these as they be religious

but if the pope by his bull hath vpon paine of excommunication discharged her maiesties subiects of their allegiance

if papists be dispensed with for obeying her maiesty til time serue to the contrary

if priests come of purpose to reconcile and teach according to the bull expounded

if it be a catholike doctrine that subiects hauing force ought to depose their prince maintaining religion contrary to the church of rome
in that case to ioyne with forreigne power

if maisters and schollers haue from time to time attempted to put the sayd bull in execution

if priests be sent before inuasion to prepare the people and
if thousands

be notified euen by priests prepared then it may be auouched that priests are not executed for affirming the popes primacy and reconciling as they be religious but as they be trayterous or dangerous to the state in ciuill consideration

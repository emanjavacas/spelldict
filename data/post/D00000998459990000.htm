THE PLEASANT HISTORY OF the two angry women of Abington.
With the humorous mirth of Dicke Coomes and Nicholas Prouerbes, tvvo Seruingmen.
As it was lately playde by the right Honorable the Earle of Nottingham, Lord high Admirall his seruants.
Imprinted at London for VVilliam Ferbrand, and are to be solde at his shop at the corner of Colman streete neere Loathbury.
GEntlemen, come to yee like one that lackes and would borrow, but was loath to aske least hee should be denied: would aske, but would aske obtaine: would knewe that manner of asking: to beg were base, and to cooche low and to carry an humble shew of entreatie, were too that fawnes on his maister to get a bone from his Trencher: out cannot abide it, to put on the shape and habit of this new worlds new found beggars, mistermed Souldiers, as thus: sweet Gentlemen, let a poore Scholler implore and exerate, that you would make him rich in the possession of amite of your fauours, to keep him a true man in wit, and to pay for his lodging among the Muses: so God him helpe he is driuen to a most low estate, tis not vnknowne what seruice of words hath been at, he lost his lims in a late conflict of floute, a braue repulse and a hot assault it was, he doth protest, as euer he saw since hee knewe what the report of a volley of testes were, he shall therefore desire you: plague vpon it, each Beadle disdained, would whip him from your companie.
Well Gentlemen, cannot tell howe to get your fauours better then by desert: then the worse lucke, or the worse wit or some what, for shall not now deserue it.
Welcome then, commit my selfe to my fortunes, your contents, contented to dye, your seuere iudgements shall iudge me to be stung to death with the Adders hisse.
The pleasant Comedy of the two angry Women of Abington.
Enter Master Goursey and his wife, and Master Barnes and his wife, with their two sonnes, and their two seruants.
GOod maister Barnes, this entertaine of yours, So of courtesie and rich delight, Makes me misdoubt my poore ability, In quittance of this friendly courtesie.
master Goursey, neighbour amitie, Is such aie well of high reckoned worth: As for the attaine of it, what would not it is so precious in my thoughts.
M. Gou. Kinde sir, neere dwelling amity indeed, Offers the hearts better view.
Then loue thats seated in a farther soyle, As prospectiues the neerer that they be, Yeeld better iudgement to the iudging eye, Thinges seene farre off, are lessened in the eye, When their true shape is seene being hard by.
True sir, tis so, and truely esteeme, Meere amity familiar neighbourhood, The cousen germaine vnto wedded loue.
sir, thers surely some aliance twixt them, For they haue both the from the heart, Within the hearts bloud Ocean still are found, Iewels of amity, and lemmes of loue.
master Goursey, haue in my time, Seene many shipwracks of true honesty, But incident such dangers euer are, To them that without compasse sayle so farre, Why what need men to swim when they may wade? But leaue this talke, enough of this is said, And Master Goursey, in good faith sir wellcome: And mistresse Goursey, am much in debt, Vnto your kindnes that would visit me.
master Barnes, you put me but in minde, Of that which should say: tis we that are Indebted to your kindnes for this cheere: Which debt that we may repay, pray lets haue, Sometimes your company, at our homely house.
That mistresse Goursey you shall surely haue, Heele be a bolde guest warrant ye, And boulder too with you then would haue him.
How doe ye meane he will be bolde with me?
Why he will trouble you at home forsooth, Often call in, and aske ye how ye doe: And sit and that with you all day till night, And all night too if he might haue his will.
wife indeed, thanke her for her kindnes, She hath made me much good cheere passing that way.
Passing well done of her, she is a kinde wench, thanke ye mistresse Goursey for my husband, And if it hap your husband come our way hunting, or such ordinary sportes, Ile doe as much for yours, as you for mine.
Gou Pray doe forsooth, Gods Lord what meanes the woman, She speakes it scornefully, faith care not, Things are well spoken, if they be well taken, What mistresse Barnes, is it not time to part? Mis. Bar.
M. Bar faith content, weele spend an hower so: Sirra fetch the Tables, Nic.
Sirra Franke, whilst they are playing heere, Weele to the greene to Bowles.
Fra. Phillip content, Coomes come hyther sirra, When our Fathers part, call vs vpon the greene, Phillip come, a rubber and so leaue, Phil, Come on.
Sbloud, doe not like the humour of these spend all their fathers good at But let them trowle the bowles vpon the greene: He trowle the bowles in the Buttery, by the leaue of God and maister Barnes: and his men be good fellows so it is, if they be not let them goe snick vp.
So set them downe, Mistresse Goursey, how doe you like this game? Mi.
Why then master Barnes, and if you please, Our wiues shall try the quarrell twixt vs two, And weele looke on? M. Bar.
Mis Ba. Nay sir, she will be sure you shall not see.
You of all men shall not marke her hand, She hath such close conueyance in her play.
Mis. Gou. Yea mistris Barnes, will ye not house your iests, But let them rome abroad so carelesly? Faith, if your iealious tongue vtter another, Ile crosse ye with a iest, and ye were my mother, Come shall we play? Mis Bar, I, what shall we play a game? Mis. Gou.
No, weell be ill huswiues once, You haue oft been ill husbands, lets alone.
would be loath to be so franke a gaister As mistresse Goursey is, and yet for once, Ile play a pound a game aswell as she.
Master Goursey, who sayes that gamings bad, When such good Angels walke twixt euery cast? M. Gou.
M. Bar It must be so where royals walke so fast.
Good faith, thinke ye play me foule an Ace, M. Bar.
But yet me thinkes the dice runnes much vneuen, That throw but dewes ase and you eleuen.
That turne you vp more at once, then me at twise.
But care not for them when your game is done, Mi.
Well mistresse, well, haue red Aesops sables, And know your morrals meaning well enough.
Loe you'l be angry, now heeres good stuffe, M. Gour.
Well, try it out, t'is all but in the hearing.
Nay thats not so, you beare one man too many.
M. Ba. me, but my wiues iestes grow too bitter, Plainer speeches for her were more better, Malice lyes inbowelled in her tongue, And new hatcht hate makes euery iest a wrong.
Why I, you neuer to misle a blot, Especially when it stands so faire to hit.
I, I, my man, my man, but had knowne, would haue had my man stood neerer home.
Why had ye kept your man in his right place, should not then haue hit him with an ase. Mis. Bar.
Mis. Gou. Thats euery day as good as Barneses wife.
And better too, then what needs all this trouble? single horse is worse then that beares double.
Wife go to, haue regard to that you say, Let not your words passe foorth the vierge of reason: But keep within the bounds of modesty, For ill report doth like a Bayliffe stand, To pound the straying, and the tongue, And makes it forseit into follies hands, Well wife, you know tis no honest part, To entertaine such guests with iests and wronges, What will the neighbring country vulgar say, When as they heare that you fell out at dinner? Forsooth they'l call it a pot straight, The best they'l name it, is a womans iangling, Go too, be rulde, be rulde.
Mi Gods Lord, be rulde, be rulde What, thinke ye haue such a babies wit, To hane a rods correction for my tongue? Schoole infancie, am of age to speake, And know when to speake, shall be child for such a? Mi.
What a? nay mistresse speake it out, scorne your stopt compares, compare not me To any but your equals, mistresse Barnes, M. Gou.
Wife, mistresse Goursey, shall winne your thoughts, To composition of some kinde effects? Wife, if you loue your credit leaue this And come shake hands, with mistresse Goursey heere, Mi.
Ba. Shall shake hands? let her go shake her heeles, She gets nor hands, nor friendship at my hands, And so while liue will take heed, What guests bid againe vnto my house.
Impatient woman, will you be so stiffe in this absurdnes? Mi.
am impatient now speake, But sir Ile tell you more an other time, Go too, will not take it as haue done.
Nay, she might stay, will not long be heere To trouble her: well maister Barnes, am sorry that it was our happes to day, To haue our pleasures parted with this fray, am sorrie too for all that is amisse, Especially that you are moou'de in this, But be not so, t's but a womans iarre, Their tongues are weapons, words their blowes of warre, T'was but a while we buffeted you saw, And each of vs was willing to withdraw, There was no harme nor bloudshed you did see: Tush, feare vs not, for we shall well agree: take my leaue sir, come kinde harted man, That speakes his wife so faire, now and than, know you would not for an hundreth pound, That should heare your voyces churlish sound, know you haue a farre more milder tune Then peace, be quiet wife, but haue done: Will ye go home? the doore directs the way, But if you will not, my dutie is to stay.
Ha, ha, why heres a right woman, is there not? They both haue din'de, yet see what stomacks they haue.
Well maister Barnes, we cannot do with all, Let vs be friends still.
maister Goursey, the mettell of our minds, Hauing the temper of true reason in them, Affoordes a better edge of argument, For the maintaine of our familiar loues, Then the soft leaden wit of women can, Wherefore with all the parts of neighbour loue, impart my selfe to maister Goursey.
And with exchange of loue do receiue it, Then here weel part partners of two curst wiues.
M. Ba Oh where shall we find a man so blest that is not, But come, your businesse and my home affaires, Makes me deliuer that vnfriendly worde mongst friends, farewell.
But harke ye maister Goursey, Looke ye perswade at home as will do, What man, we must not alwayes haue them soes.
God helpe, God helpe, Women are euen vntoward creatures still.
Come on Franke Goursey, you haue good lucke to winne the game.
Why tell me, ist not good, that neuer playd before vpon your greene.
Tis good, but that it cost me ten good crownes that makes it worse.
Let it not greeue thee man, come ore to vs, We will deuise some game to make you win Your money backe againe sweet Philip.
And that shall be ere long and if liue, But tell me Francis, what good Horses haue yee to hunt this Sommer? Fra.
No faith my wag string here Did founder one the last time that he rid, The best gray Nag that euer laid my leg ouer.
And was the same the best that ere you rid on? Fran.
One of your colour, nere remember him, one of that colour.
Set me a colour on your iest, or will: Boy.
Looke how you chafe, you would be angry more, if should tell it you.
Go to, Ile anger ye and if you do not.
Why sir, the horse that do meane, Hath a leg both straight and cleane.
But is the best that euer ye saw, pretierising knee, knee! It is as round as round may be, The full flanke makes the buttock round, This palfray standeth on no ground, When as my maister's on her backe, If that he once do say but, ticke, And if he pricke her, you shall see Her gallop amaine, she is so free, And if he giue her but a nod, She thinkes it is a riding rod: And if hee'l haue her softly go, Then she trips it like a Doe, She comes so easie with the raine, twine thred turnes her backe againe, And truly did nere see yet; horse play proudlier on the bit, My maister with good managing, Brought her first vnto the ring, He likewise taught herto coruet, To runne and suddainlie to set, Shee's cunning in the wilde goose race, Nay shee's apt to euery pace, And to prooue her colour good, flea enamourd of her blood, Digd for channels in her neck, And there made many a crimson speck, thinke theres none that vse to ride, But can her pleasant trot abide, She goes euen vpon the way, She will not stumble in a day, And when my
fie Franke fie, Nay, nay, your reason hath no iustice now, must needs say, perswade him first to speake, Then chide him for it: tell me prettie wag, Where stands his prawncer, in what Inne or stable? Or hath thy maister put her out to runne, Then in what field, what champion feeds this courser? This well paste bonnie steed that thou so praisest.
thinke that you sir haue bene askt by many, But yet neuer heard that yee tolde any, Phil.
Well boy, then will adde one more to many, aske thy maister where this Iennet feeds: Come Franke tell me, nay prethie tell me Franke, My good tell me, by this light will not steale her from thee: if do, Let me beheld a selone to thy loue.
What, wilt thou were a point but with one tag? Well Francis well, see you are a wag.
Com. Swounds where he these timber turners, these trowle the bowles, these greene men, these.
Because they throw away their soules at euery marke Fra.
Nay turne it this way, then the bowle goes true.
Nay boy Ivse to take the fairest of my play.
Yes faith, t'is our custome when your fathers men we meere.
By God thanke ye sir, thank ye sir, by God haue a quart of Wine for ye sir in any place of the world, there shal not a seruingman in Barkeshire fight better for ye then will do, if you haue any quarrell in hand, you shall haue the maidenhead of my new sword: paide a quarters wages sor't by Iesus.
Oh this meate failer Dicke, How well t'as made apparell of his wit, And brought it into fashion of an honor, Prethe Dicke Coomes but tell me how thou doost? Coo.
sir, you haue the most eloquenst ale in all world, our blunt soyle affoordes none such, Fra. Phillip leaue talking with this drunken foole, Say sirra where's my father? Coo. Marrie thanke ye my ve good cheere, Lord it is not so much worth, you see am bolde with ye, Indeed you are not so bolde as welcome, pray yee come oftner, Truly shall trouble ye, all these ceremonies are dispatcht between them, and they are gone.
And wherefore came not you to call me then? Coo.
You were at one sort of bowles, as was at another, Phi.
Fra, Why what a swearing keepes this drunken asse, Canst thou not say but sweare at euery word? Phi.
Let him alone, hee's a springall, he knowes not what belongs to an oath.
To crack my crowne, lay yea crowne of that, Lay it downe and ye dare: Nay sbloud, ile venter a quarters wages of that, Crack my crowne quoth a? Fra. Wirl ye not be quiet, will ye vrge me? Coo. Vrge yee with a pox, who vrges ye? You might haue said so much to a clowne, rone that had not been ore the sea to see fashions, haue tell ye true, and know what belongs to a man, Crack my crowne and ye can.
Hold haire braine holde, Dost thou not see hees drunke? Coo.
Nay let him come, Though he be my masters sonne, am my masters man, And a man is a man in any ground in England: Come, and he dare, a comes vpon his death, will budge an inche: no sbloud will not, Fran.
Heare me no heares Stand away, Ile trust none of you all, If haue my backe against a Cart wheele, would not care, if the deuill came.
Coo. Foole on your face, haue a wife, Fra. Shees a whore then.
Boy, No by God, Ile be witnes to none: Coo.
Comes, Comes, put vp, my friend and thou art friends Coo. Ile heare him say so first.
Franke prethie doe, be friends and tell him so, Fra. Goe to am.
Put vp sir, and ye be a man put vp. Coom.
Coomes Come, come, a couple of found yee, and so leaue yee. Exit.
Loe Franke dost thou not see hees drunke, That twits me with my disposition? Fra.
Goe to ye wag, tis well, If euer yee get a wife, faith Ile tell, Sirra at home we haue a Seruingman, Hees not humord bluntly as Coomes is, Yet his condition makes me often merrie, Ile tell thee sirra, hees a fine neate fellow, spruce slaue, warrant ye, heele haue His Cruell garters crosse about the knee, His woollen hose, as white as the driuen snowe, His shooes dry leather neat, and tyed with red bound with laces in his Hat, Bridelaces sir his hat, and all greene hat.
Greene for such a grasse greene wit, The goose that graseth on the greene quoth he, May eate on, when you shall buried be, All Prouerbes in his speech, hee's all.
Because he would speake truth, And prouerbes youle confesse, are olde saide sooth.
like this well, and one day Ile see him, But shall we part? Phil.
Not yet, Ile bring you somewhat on your way, And as we goe, betweene your boy and you, Ile know where that Praunser stands at leuery.
Wife in my minde, to day you were too blame Although my patience did not blame ye for it: Me thought the rules of loue and neighbourhood, Did not direct your thoughts, all indirect Were your proceedings, in the entertaine Of them that inuited to my house.
doe not chide but counsell wife, And in the mildest manner that may, You need not viewe me with a seruants eye, Whose vassailes sences tremble at the looke Of his displeased master, my wife, You are my selfe, when selfe sees fault in selfe.
Selfe is sinne obstinate, if selfe amend not, Indeede saw a fault in thee my selfe, And it hath set a foyle vpon thy fame, Not as the foile doth grace the Diamond.
What fault sir did you see in me to day? M. Bar.
doe not set the organ of thy voice, On such a grunting key of discontent: Doe not deforme the beauty of thy tongue, With such mishapen answeres, rough wrathfull words Are bastards got by rashnes in the thoughts, Faire demeanors, are Vertues nuptiall babes, The of the well instructed soule, let them call thee mother, then my wife, So seeme not barren of good curtesie.
Which is, that you would be good friendes with mistresse Mi.
Now by my soule held yee for more wise, Discreete, and of more temperature in sence, Then in a sullen humour to effect, That womans will borne common scholler phrase, Oft haue heard a timely married girle, That newly left to call her mother mam, Her father Dad, but yesterday come from, Thats my good girle, God send thee a good husband, And now being taught to speake the name of husband, Will when she would be wanton in her will, If her husband aske her why, say for will, Haue chid men for vnmanly choyse, That would not sit their yeares, haue seene thee Pupell such greene yong things, and with thy counsell, Tutor their wits, dart thou now infected, With this disease of imperfection, blush for thee ashamed at thy shame.
shame on her, that makes thee rate me so, M. Bar black mouth'drage, thy breath is And thou makst vertue shake at this high storme, Shees of good report, know thou knowst
She is not, nor know not, but know That thou dost loue her, thinkst her so, Thou bearst with her, because she beares with Thou mayst be ashamed to stand in her defence, She is a strumpet, and thou art no honest man To stand in her defence against thy wife, If catch her in my walke now by Ckes bones, Ile scratch out both her eyes.
Nay neuer say God for the matter, Thou art the cause, thou badst her to my house, Onely to bleare the eyes of Goursey, didst not? But wil· send him word warrant thee, And ere sleepe to, trust vpon it sir.
Methinks this is a mighty fault in her, could be angry with her: if be so, but put a Linke vnto a Torche, And so giue greater light to see her fault: Ile rather smother it in melancholly, Nay, wisedome bids me shunne that passion, Then will studie for a remedy, haue a daughter now heauen inuocate, She be not of like spirit as her mother, sheel be a plague vnto her husband, If that he be patient and discreet, For that hold the ease of all such trouble, Well, well, would my daughter had a husband, For would see how she could demeane her selfe, that estate, it may be ill enough, And so God shall help me, well remembred now, Franke Goursey is his fathers some and heyre, youth that in my heart haue good hope on, My sences say a match, my soule applaudes The motion: but his are great, Hee will looke high why will straine my selfe.
To make her dowry equall with his land, Good faith and twere a match twould be a meanes, To make their mothers friends: Ile call my daughter, To see how disposde to marriage: Mall, where are yee? Enter Mall.
saw her not forsooth, since you and she Went walking both together to the garden.
M. Ba. Dost thou heare me girle? must dispute with thee Mal.
Father the question then must not be For am very weake in argument.
Were it not good, then all men would not marry But now they doe. Mal.
It is both good and bad, how can this be? Mal.
Why it is good to them that marry well, To them that marry ill, no greater hell.
Wench am studying forthy good indeed, Mall My hopes dutie, wish your thoughts good speed M. Bar.
But tell me wench, hast thou a minde to marry: Mall.
This question is too hard for And Father, now ye pose my modestie, am a maide, and when ye aske me thus, like a maide must blush looke pale and wan, And then looke pale againe, for we change colour, As our thoughts change, with true fac'd passion, Of modest maidenhead, could adorne me, And to your question, make a sober cursie, And with clipt ciuility be silent, Or els say no forsooth, or forsooth, If said no forsooth, lyed forsooth, To lye vpon my selfe were deadly sinne, Therefore will speake truth and shame the diuell, Father, when first heard you name a husband, At that same very name, my spirits quickned, Dispae before had kild them, they were dead, Because it was my hap so long to tarry, was perswaded should neuer marry.
And sitting sowing thus vpon the ground, fell in traunce of meditation, But comming to my selfe, Lord said I, Shall it be so, must vnmarried dye? And being angry Father, farther said, Now by saint Anne, will not dye a maide, Good faith before came to this ripe groath, did accuse the labouring time of sloath, Me thought the yeere did run but slow about, For thought each yeare ten was without, Being foureteene, and toward the other yeare: Good Lord thought I, fifteene will nere be heere, For haue heard my mother say, that then Prittie maides, were fit for handsome men, Fifteene past, and seuenteene too, What, thought I, will not this husband do? Will no man marry me, haue men forsworne, Such beauty and such youth? shall youth be worne As rich mens gownes, more with age then vse? Why I'let restained fansie loose, And bad it gaze for pleasure: then loue swore me To doe what ere my mother did before me, Yet in good faith, was very loath, But now it lyes in you to saue my oath: If shall haue a husband, get him quickly, For that weares Corke shooes, may step awry.
Beleeue me wench, doe not apprehend thee, But for this pleasant answere do commend thee.
must confesse, loue doth thee mighty wrong, But will see thee haue thy right ere long, know a young man, whom holde most fit, To haue thee, both for liuing and for wit, will goe write about it presently.
Good father do, God me thinkes should Wife it as fine as any woman could: could carry a porte to he obayde, Carry a maistering eye vpon my maide, With minion do your businesse or Ile make yee, And to all house authoritie be take me.
God would were married, be my troth, But if be not, sweare Ile keepe my oath.
Your Father, and what said he too ye pray? Mall.
Nay by the masse ye lie Mother, how olde were you when you did marry.
Then the worse for me, hark Mother harke, The Priest forgets that ere he was a Clarke, When you were at my yeeres, Ile holde my life, Your minde was to change maidenhead for wife, Pardon me mother, am of your minde, And by my troth take it but by kinde.
Doe ye heare daughter, you shal stay my leasure Mall.
Do you heare mother, would you stay fro~ pleasure When ye haue minde to it? go to, there's no wrong Like this, to let maides lye alone so long Lying alone they muse but in their beds, How they might loose their long kept maiden heads, This is the cause there is so many scapes, For women that are wise, will lead Apes In hell, tel yee mother say true, Therefore come husband, maiden head adew.
Well lustie guts, meane to make ye stay, And set some rubbes in your mindes smothest way.
Ouer the meades halfe way to Milton mother, To beare my friend Franke Goursey company.
Ba. Wher's your blew coat, your sword buckler sir Get you such like habite for a seruingman, If you will waight vpon the brat of Goursey.
Mother, that you are moou'd this me wonder, When departed did leaue yee friends, What vndigested hath since betided? Mi.
And sties her with the conceit of it, am abusde my sonne by wife.
Mistresse flurt, you foule strumpet, Light aloue, short heeles, mistresse Goursey, Call her againe and thou were better no.
sir, haue patience, and see your father To rifle vp the treasure of my loue, And play the vpon such an harlot? This same will make me haue patience, will it not?
This same is womens most impatience, Yet mother haue often heard ye say, That you haue found my father temperate, And euer from such affections.
I, till my too much loue did glut his thoughts, And make him seek for cha~ge, Phi.
change your minde My father beares more cordiall loue to you.
B. Thou liest, thou liest, for he loues Gourseys wife, not me.
Now sweare mother you are much too blame, durst be sworne he loues you as his soule.
Wilt thou be pampered by affection? Will nature teach thee such vilde periurie? Wilt thou be sworne, forlorne, carelesse boy? And if thou swearst, say he loues me not.
He loues ye but too well sweare, Vnlesse ye knew much better how to vse him, Mi.
Doth he so sir? thou vnnaturall boy, Too well sayest thou, that word shall cost thee somwhat, O'monstrous, haue brought thee vp to this? Too well, vnkinde, wicked and degenerate, Hast thou the heart to say so of thy mother? Well, God will plague thee sort, warrant thee, Out on thee fie vpon thee wretch, Out of my sight, out of my sight say.
This ayre is pleasant, and doth please me well, And here will stay, Mi.
Thou setst thy sonne to scoffe and mocke at me, Ist not sufficient am wrongd of thee? But he must be an agent to abuse me? Must be subiect to my cradle too? God, God ame~d it.
Why how now Phillip, is this true my sonne? Phil.
Deare father she is much impatient: Nere let that hand assist me in my need, If more said, then that she thought amisse, To thinke that you were so licentious giuen, And thus much more, when she inferd it more, swore an oath you lou'd her but too well, In that as guiltie do hold my selfe, Now that come to more considerate triall, know my fault, should haue borne with Blame me for rashnesse, then not for want of dutie.
do absolue thee, and come hether Phillip, haue writ a letter vnto master Goursey, And will tell thee the contents thereof, But tell me first, thinkst thou Franke Gours? loues thee? Phil If that a man deuoted to a man, Loyall, in loues hallowed vowes, If that a man that is soule laboursome, To workehis owne thoughts to his friends delight, May purchase good opinion with his friend, Then may say· haue done this so well, That may thinke Franke Goursey loues me well.
M. Ba. Tis well, and am much deceiued in him, And if he be not sober, wise, and valliant.
hope my father takes me for thus wise, will not glew my selfe in loue to one, That hath not some desert of vertue in him, What ere you thinke of him, beleeue me Father, He will be answerable to your thoughts, In any quallity commendable.
Thou chearst my hopes in him, and in good faith, Thoust made my loue complete vnto thy friend, Phillip loue him, and loue him so, could affoorde him a good wife know.
How canst thou say so knowing not his minde? Phi All is one for that, will goe to him straight, Father if you would seeke this seauen yeares day, You could not finde a match for her, And he shall haue her, sweare he shall, He were as good be hang'd as once deny her, saith Ile to him M. Bar.
Hairebraine, hairebraine· stay, As yet we do not know his fathers minde, Why what will master my sonne, If we it without his knowledge? Go to, hees a wise and discreet Gentleman, And that respects from me all honest parts, Nor shall he faile his expectation, First doe meane to make him priuy to it, Phillip this letter is to that effect.
Father, for Gods sake send it quickly then, Ile call your man, what Hugh, wheres Hugh, there
Phillip if this would prooue a match, it were the only meanes that could be found, to make thy mother frends with Mist.
Gou. Phil How a match? Ile warrant ye a My sister's faire, Franke Goursie he is rich, His dowry too, will be sufficient, Franke's yong, and youth is apt to loue, And by my troth my sisters maiden head Standes like a game attennis, if the ball Hit into the hole or hazard, farewell all.
Why what doth this prouerbial with vs, why where's Hugh? M. Bar.
Father let me alone, doe it but to make my selfe some sport, This formall foole your man speakes naught but prouerbes, And speake men what they can to him, hee'l answere With some time, rotten sentence, or olde saying, Such spokes as the ancient of the parish vse, With neighbour tis an olde prouerbe and a true, Goose giblets are good meate, old sacke better then new, Then saies another, neighbour that is true, And when each man hath drunke his gallon round, penny pot, for thats the olde mans gallon, Then he licke his lips and stroke his beard, Thats glewed together with his slauering droppes, Of yey ale, and when he scarce can trim, His gouty fingers, thus hee'l phillip it, And with a rotten hem say hey my hearts, Merry go soy cocke and pye my heartes, But then their penny prouerbe comes, And that is this: they that will to the wine, Berlady mistresse shall lay theyr penny to This was one of this bastards, For on my lyfe he was neuer begot, Without the consent of some great
Well, now vnto my busines; Swounds will that mouth thats made of olde sed sawes, And nothing else, say nothing to vs now? Nich.
you must not leape ouer the stile before you come at it, haste makes waste, softe fire makes sweere mast, too fast for falling, there's no hast to hang true men.
Father we ha'te, ye see we ha'te, now will see if my memorie wil serue for some prouerbs too.
a painted cloath were as wel worth a as a theese woorth a halten well, after my heartie as was at the making hereof· so it is, that hope as you speed, so you're sure a swift horse will tire, but he that trottes easilie will indure, you haue most learnedly prouerbde it, commending the vertue of patience or forbearance, but yet you know forbearance is no quittance.
promise yee maistor Philip you haue spoken as true as steele.
And it seemeth vnto me, it seemes to me, that you maister Phillip mocke me, do you not know qui mocat mobitur, mocke age and see how it will prosper? Phil.
Why ye whoreson prouerb booke bound vp in folio, Haue yee no other sence to answer me, But euery worde a prouerbe, no other English? Well, Ile fulfill a prouerbe on thee straight.
Father that same is the cowards common prouerb:, But come, come sirra, tell me where Hugh is? Nich.
may and will, need not except list, you shall not commaund me, you glue me neither meate, drinke, nor wages, am your fathers man, and a man's a man, and a haue but a hose on his head, do not misuse me so, do not, for though he that is bound must obay, yet he that will not tarrie, may runne away so he may.
Peace Nicke, Ile see he shall vse thee well, Go to peace sirra, here Nicke take this lett Carrie it to him to whom it is directed.
Forsooth though none of the best yet meanly: M. Bar.
Forsooth as vse makes perfectnes, so seldome seene is soone forgotten.
Well said, but goe, it is to Master Goursey, Phil.
Now sir, what prouerbe haue ye to deliuer a letter? Nich.
What need you to care? who speakes to you? you may speake when you are spoken to, and keep your winde to coole your pottage: well, well, you are my maisters sonne you looke for his lande, but they that hope for dead mens shooes, may hap to go barefoote: take heed, as soone goes the yong sheep to the pot'as the olde.
pray God saue my Maysters life, for sildome comes the better.
No, you should say God send faire weather after me, Phil.
Alas poore foole, he vses all his wit, Phillip in faith this mirth hath cheered thought, And cussend it of his right play of passion, Goe after Nick, and when thou thinkst hees there, Go in and vrge to that which haue writ, Ile in these meddowes make a cerckling walke, And in my meditation coniure so, As that some send of thought anger, Shall by my spels of treason vanish quite Away, and let me beate fromthee to night.
To night, yes that you shall, but harke ye father, Looke that you my sister waking keepe, For Franke sweare shall kisse her ere sleepe.
Frank am very with walking ore the greene, Bu lersome Beere, sirra call the Butler.
Nay faith sir, we must haue some smith to giue the butler drench, or cut him in the forehead, for he hath got horses disease, namely the staggers, to night hees a good Huswife, he reeles al that he wrought to day, he were good Now to play at dice, for he castes excellent well.
cannot tell, but am sure hee hath more liquor in him Then a whole dicker of hydes, hees sockt throughly faith.
Well goe and call him, bid him bring me drinke.
My mother powres and will looke merrily, Neither vpon my father nor on me, He saies she fell out with mistresse Barnes to day, Then am sure they'l no: be quickly friends, Good Lord what kinde of creatures women are? Their loue is lightly wonne and lightly lost, And then their hate is deadly and extreame.
He that doth take a wyfe, betakes himselfe To all the cares and troubles of the world, Now her disquietnes doth grieue my father, Greeues me, and troubles all the house besides, What, shall haue so ne drinke? how now a horne? Belike the drunken slaue is fallen a sleepe, And now the boy doth wake him with his horne, How now sirra, wheres the butler? Ent. Boy.
Mary sir, where he was euen now a sleepe, but wakt him, and when he wakt, he thought he was in mayster Barnses buttery, for he stretcht himself thus: and said, Nicke, honest Nicke fill a fresh bowle of ale, stand to it Nicke and thou beest a man of Gods making, stand to it, and then winded my horne, and hees horne mad.
Boy hey, ho boy, and thou beest a man draw, heres a blessed mooneshine God be thanked, boy is not this goodly weather for barley? Boy.
Spoken like a right maulster Hodge, but doost thou thou art not drunke.
Hod. Drunke, a plague on it, when a man cannot carry his drinke well: sbloud Ile stand to it.
Drunke? hees a beast and he be drunke, theres no man that is a sober man will be drunk, hees a boy and he be drunke.
Thus tis when a man will not be ruled by his friendes, bad him keepe vnder the lee, but he kept downe the weather two bowes, tolde him hee would be taken with a plannet, but the wisest of vs all may fall.
Hod. Whope lend me thy hand Dicke, am falne into a Wel, lend me thy hand, shall be drowned else.
there is a rope on it, but where art thou Hodge? Hodge.
How loathsome is this beast mans shape to me? This mould of reason so vnreasonable, Sirra, why doost thou trip him downe seeing hees drunke? Boy.
How meane ye? Boy, Why they say, that when any thing hath a fall, it is cheape, and so of drunkards.
Go to helpe him vp, but harke who knockes? Bo.
Sir, heeres one of Maister Barnsies men with a letter to my olde maister.
By your leaue ho, how now young maister how ist? Fran.
Looke ye sirra, where your fellow lies, Hees in a fine taking, is he not? Coom.
Whope Hodge, were art thou man, where art thou? Hodge.
In a well man, nay then thou art deepe in vnderstanding, Fran.
Who I, go to young maister, do not like this humor in ye give every man his doe, and give him no more: say was in such a case, go to tis the greatest indigna tion that can be offered to a man: and but a mans more god her given, you were able to make him out his hear: bloud, what he ere or as some say, cut a feather: what thogh he be misled, band, or as it were tis no consequent to me: you know have drunke all the Ahouses in drie, and laideth: tappes on the tables when had done: Ile challenge all the true rob. pots to leape vp to the in a of beere, and if can not drink it down to my foote ere leaue, and then set the in of the house, and then turne a good turne on the toe on it, let me be counted no nay let me be bound to drinke nothing but small beere seuen yeares after, and had as
Peace sir, must with one, Nicholas think your name is, Nich.
Wel, how doth my maister? Nich. liue, and the best doth no better.
Tis right as Phillip saide, tis a fine soole, This letter is directed to my father.
Ile carrie it to him, Dicke Coomes make him drinke.
Well Nicholas, as thou art Nicholas, welcome, but as thou art Nicholas and a boone companion, ten times welcome, Nicholas giue me thy hand; shall we be and wee shall, say but we shall, and let the first word stand.
Indeed as long the man Anownce of debt will not pay a pound of care? Coom, Nay, a pound of care will not pay anownce of debt.
Well, tis a good horse neuer stumbles but who lies here? Coom.
Tis our Hodge, and he lies a sleepe, you made him drunk at your house to Ile pepper so of you fort.
Richard, know yoe put a man ouer the shooes, if you can, but hees a foole wil take more then wil do him good.
Sbloud ye shall take more then will doe yee good, Or Ile make ye clap vnder the table.
Nay, hope, as haue temperance to forbeare drinke so haue patience to endure company doth, for whe~ a ma~ doth to Rome come, he must do as there is done, Coomes.
Ha my resolued Nicke fill the poe Hostesse, swounes you whore, Harry Hooke's a rascall: helpe me but carry my fellow Hodge in, and weele crushe it ith.
By this thinke, the letter is deliuered, And twill be shortly time that step in, And wooe their fauours for my sisters fortune, And yet need not, she may doe as well, But yet not better, as the case doth stand, Betweene our mothers it may make the friends, Nay would sweare she would doe as well, Were she a stranger to But they are so acquainted, nere part, Why she will floute the deuill and make blush The boldest face of man, that euer man saw, He that hath best opinion wit, And hath his braine pan fraught with bitter Iestes, Or of his owne, or istolne, or how Let him: so high in his owne conceite, Her wit's a sunne, that melts him downe like butter, And makes him sit at table wise, Flat, flat, a word to say, Yet sheele not him but like a tyrant, Sheele persecute the poore man, And so be bang with dry and scoffes, When he is downe, most cowardly good faith, As haue the poore patient.
came a Farmers sonne a wooing to her, proper man, well landed too he was, man that for his wit need not to aske, What time a yeere twere good to sow his Oates, Nor yet his Barley, no nor when to reape, To plowe his Fallowes, or to his Trees, Well experienst thus each kinde of way, After a two monthes labour at the most, And yet twas well he held it out so long, He left his loue, she had so laste his lips, He could say nothing to her, but God be with yee, Why she, when men haue din'd and call for Will straight iestes bitter todisgest, And then some one will fall to argument, Who if he ouer master her with reason, Then sheele begin to him with mockes, Well doe doubt, Frances hath so much spleene, Theil nere agree, but will moderate.
By this time, tis time thinke to enter, This is the house, shall knocke? no will not Waite while one comes out to answere: Ile in, and let them be as bolde with vs. Exit.
M. Gour If that they like her shall be equall, To your sonnes wealth or possibility, It is a meanes to make our wines good friendes, And to continue to two, Tis so indeed, like this motion, And it hath my consent, because my wife, is sore infected and hart sick with hate: haue sought the of aduice, which onely tels me this same potion, to be most soueraigne for hir sicknes cure.
Heere comes my sonne, conferring with his friend, Fraunces, how do you like your friends discourse? know he is perswading to this motion.
Father, as matter that befits a friend, But yet not me, that am too young to marry.
Nay, if thy minde be forward with thy yeares, The time is lost thou trust me boy, This match is to thy birth, Her bloud and portion giue each other grace: These indented lines promise a sum, And do like the valew, if it hapthy liking to accord to my consent, It is a match: wilt thou goe see the maide? Fra. Nere trust me Father, the shape of marriage, Which doe see in others, seeme so seuere, dare not put my youngling liberty, Vnder the awe of that instruction, And yet graunt the limmits of free youth Going astray, are often restrainde by that: But mistresse wedlocke, to my scholler thoughts, Will be too curst feare, should she snip, My pleasure ayming minde, shall be sad, And sweare, when did marry was mad.
But boy, let my experience teach thee this, Yet in good faith, thou speakst not much amisse, When first thy mothers same to me did come, Thy grandsire thus, then came to me his sonne, And euen my words to thee, to me he said, And as to me thou saist, to him said, But in a greater huffe, and hotter bloud, tell ye, on youthes then stood, Saies he (good faith this was his very say) When was yong, was but reasons foole, And went to wedding, as to wisdomes schoole: It taught me much, and much did forget, But beaten much by it, got some wit, Though was shackled from an often scoute, Yet would wanton it when was out, Twas comfort, old acquaintance then to meete, Restrained liberty, is sweet, Thus said my Father to thy Father, sonne And thou maist doe this to, as haue done.
In faith good counsell Franke, what saist thou to it? Fra. Phillip, what should say? Phil.
Fra. Thats I, then I, should it fall out ill.
What backeward gone? Fra. Phillip, no whit that is on.
Tush, there is no good lucke in this delay, Come, come, late commers man are shent.
Fra. Heigh ho, feare shall repent, Well, which way Franke? Phi.
Fra. Canst thou tell? And takest vpon thee to be my guide to hell, But which way Father? M. Gou.
I, you know, You found the way to sorrow long agoe, Father God boye ye, you haue sent your sonne, To seeke on earth an earthly day of doome, Where shall be iudged, alacke the ruthe, To for the follies of my youth.
Well must goe, but by my troth my minde, Is not loue capable to that kinde, haue lookt vpon this mould of men, As haue done vpon a Lyons den, Praised haue the gallant beast saw, Yet wisht me no acquaintance with his pawe, And must now be grated with them, well, Yet may hap to prooue a Daniell, And if doe sure it would make me laugh, To be among wilde beastes and yet be safe, Is there a remedy to abate their rage, Yes many catch them, and put them in a cage, but how catch them, marry in your hand, Carrie me foorth a burning For with his sparkling shine, olde rumor saies, the swiftest runner fraies, This may doe, but if it prooue not so, Then man goes out to seeke his adiunct woe, Phillip away, and Father now adew, In quest of sorrow am sent by you.
Why is it not good to wooe by candle light.
But if we make not haste theile be a bed.
The better candles out, and curtans spred Exeunt M. Gour.
Yet he hath wit to wooe as well as any, Heere comes my wife, am glad my boy is gone.
Ereshe came hether, how now wife, how ist? What are ye yet in charity and loue with mistresse Barnes? Mi.
Gou, What mistris Barnes, why mistris Barnes pray M. Gou.
And what? And a iealous slandering spitefull queane she is, One that would blur my reputation, With her approbrious mallice if she could, She wrongs her husband, to abuse my fame, Tis knowne that haue liude in honest name, All my life time, and bin your right true wife, M. Gour.
entertaine no other thought my wife, And my opinion's sound of your behauiour.
And my behauiour is as sound as it, But her ill speeches seekes to rot my credit, And eate it with the worme of hate and mallice.
By patience, would ye haue me shame my selfe, And cussen my selfe to beare her iniuries: Not while her eyes be open will yeelde, word, a letter, a sillables valew, But equall and make euen her wrongs to me, To her againe.
Then in good faith wife ye are more to blame.
There is a dearth of manners in ye wife, Rudelie to snatch it from me, giue it me? Mi.
M, Gou. Giue me it then, and will read it to you? Mi.
Gou, No, no, it shall not need, am a scholler Good enough to read a letter sir, M. Gou Gods passion, if she knew but the contents, Sheele seeke to crosse this match, she shall not read it.
Gou. Tut, tell not me of your impatience, But since you talke sir of impatience, You shall not haue the letter by this light, Till haue read it, soule ile burne it first.
Go to, ye moue me wife, giue me the letter, Introth shall growe angry, if you doe not.
Well, can beare enough, but not too much, Come giue it me, twere best you be perswaded, By God ye make me sweare, now God forgiue me, Giue me say, and stand not long vpon it, Go to, am angry at the heart, my very heart, Mis. Gou. Hart me no hearts· you shall not haue it sir, No you shall not, nere looke so big, will nor be affraide at your great lookes, You shall not haue it, no you shall not haue it.
Shall not haue it, introth Ile try that, Minion Ile hau'te, shall not hau'te, am loath, Go too, take pausment, be aduisde, Infaith will, and stand not long vpon it, woman of your yeares, am ashamde, couple of so long continuance, Should thus, Gods foote, cry God hartely mercy, Go to, ye vex me, and Ile vexe ye for it, Before leaue ye, will make ye glad, To tender it on your knees, heare ye, will will, What worse and worse stomacke, ye faith, Shall be crost by you in my olde age? And where should haue greatest comfort to, of you nursle in the diuels name, Go to mistris, by Gods deere, If ye delaie.
Lord· Lord, why in what a fit, Are you in husband, so inrag'd, so moou'd, And for so slight a cause, to read a letter, Did this letter loue, conteine my death, Should you denie my sight of it, would not, Not see my sorrow, not eschew my danger, But willinglie yeeld me a patient, the doome that your displeasure gaue: Heere is the letter, not for that your incensment, Makes me make offer of it, but your health, Which anger doe feare hath crasd.
And viper like hath suckt away the bloud, That wont was to be cheerefull in this cheeke, How pale yee looke.
Pale, can yee blame me for it, tell you true, An easie matter could not thus haue moou'd me, Well this resignement, and so foorth, but woman This fortnight shall not forget yee for it.
Ha, ha, see that roughnes can doe somwhat, did not thinke good faith, could haue set, So sower a face vpon it, and to her, My bed embracer, my right bosome friend, would not that she should haue seene the letter As poore a man as am by my troth For twenty pound: well am glad haue it.
Ha, heres a doe about a thing of nothing, What stomack, ha, tis happy your come downe.
Well craftie Fox, Ile hunt ye by my troth, Deale ye so closely? well see his drift.
He would not let me see the letter, least That should crosse the match, and will crosse it.
Come hether Dicke, thou art a man And one whom haue much in my regarde, Coo.
Nay heers my hand, will do very much for thee If ere thou standst in need of me, Thou shal not lack, whilst thou hast a day to Money apparrell.
And sword and Bucklers too my gallant Dick, So thou wilt vse but this in my defence.
This, no faith haue no minde to this, breake my head if this breake not if we come to any tough play, nay mistres had a sword, the flower of smithfield for a sword a right Fox faith, with that a man had come ouer with a smooth and a sharpe stroke, it would haue cried twang, then when had doubled my point, traste my ground, and had carried my buckler before me like a garden and then come in with a crosse blowe, ouer the picke of his buckler two elles long, it would haue cryed twang, twang, mettle, mettle: but a dogge hath his day, tis gone, and there are few good ones made now, see by this dearth of good swords, that dearth of sword and Buckler fight, begins to grow out, am sorry for it, shall neuer see good manhood againe, if it be once gone, this poking fight of rapier and dagger will come vp then· then a man, a tall man, a good sword and buckler man, will be spitted like a Cat or a cunney, then a boy will be as good as a man, vnlesse the Lord shew mercie vnto vs, well, had as heue be hanged as liue to see that day, wel mistres, what shal do? what shal do? Mis Gour.
Why this braue Dicke, Thou knowest that Gourseys wife and am foes: Now man me to her house, And though it be darke Dicke, yet weele haue no light, Least that thy maister should preuent our iourney By seeing our depart: then when we come, And if that she and do fall to words, Set in thy foote and quarrell with her men, Draw, fight, strike, hurt, but do not kill the slaues, And make as though thou struckst at a man, And hit her and thou canst, a plague vpon her, She hath misusde me Dicke, wilt thou do this? Coom.
Yes mistresse will strike her men, but God forbid, That ere Dicke Coomes should be seene to strike a woman.
Mankinde, nay and she haue any part of a man, Ile strike her warrant.
Swones who would not be a man of valour to haue such words of a Gentlewoman, one of their wordes are more to me then twentie of these russet coates Cheesecake; and buttermakers: well, thanke God am none of these cowards, well and a man haue any vertue in him, see he shall be regarded.
Art thou resolued Dicke? wilt thou do this for me, and it thou wilt, here is an earnest penny, of that riche guerdon do meane to giue thee.
An angell mistresse let me see, stand you on my left hand, and let the angell lye on my buckler on my right hand, for feare of losing, now heere stand to be they say, euery man hath two spirits attending on him, eyther good or bad, now say a man hath no other spirits but eyther his wealth or his wife, now which is the better of them, why that is as they are vsed, for vse neither of them well, and they are both nought, but this is a miracle to me, that golde that is heauie hath the vpper, and a woman that is light dooth soonest fall, considering that light things aspire, and heauie things soonest go downe, but these considerations to sir Iohn, they become a blacke coate better then a blew, well mistresse had no minde to daye to quarrell, but a woman is made to be a mans seducer, you say quarrell.
There speakes an angell, is it good? Mis. Gou. I. Coom.
Then cannot doe amisse, the good angel goes with me.
Come on my harts, faith it is ill lucke, To hunt all day and not kill any thing, What sayest thou Lady, art thou weary yet? La.
And can you blame her to be foorth so long, And see no better sport? Ra. Good faith twas very hard.
No indeed nor them, Life is as deere in Deare as tis in men.
But thats bad play, When they are made to sport their liues away.
What out of breath? They runne but ill that runne themselues to death, Ra.
Then twere as good for them at first to stay, As to run long and run their liues away.
but the stoest of you all thats here, Would run from death, and nimbly scud for feare, Now by my troth pittie those poore elfes.
Well, they haue made vs but bad sport to day.
Yes thou louest to see liues dye. Ra. Lady no more, do not like this lucke, To hunt all day and yet not kill a Buck, Well, it is late, but yet sweare will Stay heere all night, but a Buck will kill.
All night, nay good sir Raph Smith do not so.
Ra. Content ye Ladie, Will, go fetch my bow, berrie of faire Roes saw to day, Downe by the groues, and there ile take my stand, And shoote at one, God send a luckie hand.
Will ye not then sir Raph go home with me? Ra.
Sirs man her home, Will bid the Huntmen couple, And bid them well reward their hounds to night.
Ladie farewell, Will hast ye with the Bow, Ile stay for thee heere by the groue below.
will, but twill be darke shall not see, How shal see ye then? Ra. Why hollo to me, and wil answer thee.
How willingly doost thou to go, To fetch thy maister that same killing bow.
Wil. Guiltie of death willing am in this, Because twas our ill haps to day to misse, To and not to kill is hunters sorrow, Come Ladie, weel haue venson ere tomorrow.
Come Franke now are we hard by the house, But how now, sad? Fran.
How man, how to woe her? why no matter how, am sure thou not be ashamed to woe, Thy cheekes not subiect to a childish blush, Thou hast a better warrant by thy wit, know thy oratorie can vnfold, Quicke inuention, plausible discourse, And set such painted beautie on thy tongue, As it shall rauish euery maiden sence, For Franke, thou art not like the russet youth tolde thee of, that went to woe a wench, And being full stuft vp with fallow wit, And meddow matter, askt the pretty maide, How they solde corne last market day with them.
Saying: indeed twas very deare wit them: And do ye heare, he had not need doe so, For she will Francis throwly trie your wit, Sirra sheel bow the mettall of your wits, And if they cracke she will not hold ye currant, Nay she will way your wits as men may angels, And if lacke a graine, she will not chanke with ye, cannot speake it but in passion, She is a wicked wench to make a iest, Aye me how full of floutes and mockes she is? Fran.
Some Aquavitae reason to recouer, This sicke soond not prethy Philip, Tush, tush, do not thinke her as thou saiest, Perhaps shees opinions darling Phillip: Wise in repute, the crowes bird my friend, Some iudgements slaue themselues to small desart, And wondernize the birth of common wit, When their wone straungenes do but make that strange, And their ill errors do but make that good, And why should men debase to make that good, Perhaps such admiration winnes her wit.
Well, am glad to heare this bold prepare, For this encounter, forward hardy Franke, Yonders the window, with the candle int, Belike shees putting on her night attire, told ye ranke twas late, well will call her, Mary softly that my mother may not heare: Mall, sister Mall.
Tis I, Mal. Tis I, who I? quoth the dogge, or what? christ crosse rowel? Phi.
Doue, one of those that drawe the Queene of loue? Mal.
How now? Whose that brother, whose that with ye? Phil.
Well climde Gentleman, pray sir tell me, do you carte the queene of loue? Fran.
Not cart her, but couch her in your eye, And a fit place for gentle loue to lye. Mal.
but me thinkes you speake without the booke, To place a sower wheele waggon in my looke, Where will you haue roome to haue the sit? Fran.
Nay, that were but small manners, and not fit, His dutie is before you bare to Hauing a lustie whipstocke in his hand.
The place is voide, will you prouide me one? Fra.
But are ye cunning in the Carmans lash? And can ye whistle well? Fran.
Nay, but harke ye brother? Whose white boy is that same? know ye his mother? Phil.
Why is his house of gold, is it not made of lyme andS stone like this? Phil.
Well, you will still be crosse, tell yee sister, This Gentleman by all your friends consent, Must be your husband.
Nay not all, some sing another note, My mother will say no, holde a groate.
But thought twas somewhat, he would be a carter, He hath beene whipping some blinde beare, And now he would the blinde boy heere with vs. Phil.
Well, do you you sister, mistresse would haue You that do long for somwhat know what.
My father tolde me, go too Ile tell all, If ye be crosse, do ye heare me? labourd yeares worke in this afternoone for ye, Come from your cloyster, votarie, chase Nun, Come downe and kisse Franke Gourseys mothers sonne.
Go to, stale maidenhead· come downe say, You seuenteene and vpward, come come downe, You'l stay till twentie else for yo 'r wedding gowne, Mal.
Nun, votarie, stale maidenhead, seuenteene and vpward, Here be names, what nothing else? Fran.
Mal. Fie not so big sir, by one part of foure.
Why then ye are a boate without an oare, Mal.
Why take your first man wench, and go no further.
Peace Francis, harke ye sister, this say, you know my mind, or answer or nay, Wit iudgement hath resolude his mind, And he what after he shall finde, If such discretion then shall gouerne you, Vow loue to him, heele do the like to you.
Vow loue? who would not loue such a comely feature? Nor high nor lowe, but of the middle stature, middle man thats the best syze indeed, like him well, Loue graunt vs well to speed.
And let me see a woman of that So slender and of such a middle smalnesse, So olde enough, and in each part so fit, So faire, so kinde, eudued with so much wit, Of so much wit as it is held a wonder, Twere pittie to keepe loue and her a sunder, Therefore go vp my ioy, call downe my blie, Bid her come seale the bargaine with a kisse.
Mal. Franke, Franke, come through dangers, death and harmes To make Loues patient with thy seale of armes.
Francis, indeed my sister dare say, Was not determined to say thee nay, For this same tother thing, calde Hangs by so small a haire or spiders thred, And worne so too with time, it must needs fall, And like a well lur'de hawke, she knows her call.
Mal. Whist brother whist, my mother heard me tread, And askt whose there? would not answer her, She calde a light, and vp shees gone to seeke me, There when she findes me not, sheel hether come, Therefore dispatch, let it be quickly done, Francis, my lease do let to thee, Date of my life and thine, what sayest thou to me? The entring, fine, or income thou must pay, Are kisses and euery day, And quarterly must receiue my rent, You know my minde.
gesse at thy intent, Thou shalt not misse a minute of thy time.
Why then sweet Francis am onely thine, Brother beare witnesse.
do do, Ph. God send you both good speed, Gods lord my mother Stend aside and closely too, least that you be espied, Mi Ba. Whose there? Phi.
You disobedient ruffen, carelesse wretch, That said your Father loude me too well, Ile thinke on't when thou thinkst haue forgotten it: Whose with thee else? how now minion you? With whom? with him? why what make you heere sir? And thus late too, what hath your mother sent ye To cut my throate, that heere you be in waite? Come from him mistris, and let go his hand, Will ye not sir? Fra.
Stay mistresse Barnes, or mother, what ye will, Shees my wife, and here she shall be still.
How sir your wife? wouldst thou my daugter haue Ile rather haue her married to her graue, Go to be gone, and quickly, or sweare, Ile haue my men beate ye for staying here, Phi.
Beate him mother· as am true man, They were better beate the diuell and his dam.
To do him good, And twere to wade hetherto vp in blood.

G. Francis, by faire meanes let me win thee from her, And will gild my blessing gentle sonne, With store of Angels, would not haue thee, Check thy good fortune, by this thy cusning choise, doe not thrall thy happie libertie, In such a bondage, if thou'lt be needs bound, Be then to better worth, this worthlesse choise Is not fit for thee.

Wel sir, so it is, would not wish ye to marry without my mistris consent.
Nay, theres nere a why, but there is a wherefore, haue known some haue done the like, they haue daunst a Galliard at Beggers bush for it.
At Beggers bush, here him no more maister, he doth be dawbe ye with his durty speach: doe ye heare sir, how farre stands Beggers bushe from your fathers house sir? how thou whorson refuge of a Taylor, that wert prentise to a tailor half an age, because if thou hadst serued ten ages thou wouldst proue but a botcher, thou leapst fro~ the shop to a Blew coate: doth it become thee to vse thy tearms so? wel, thou degree aboue a hackney, and ten degrees vnder a Page, sow vp your lubber lips, or tis not your sworde and Buckler, shall keep my Poniard from your brest.
Why then tis a fine world, when boies keep boies, and know not how to vse them.

Stay Franke, this pitch of Frensie will defile thee, Meddle not with it, thy vnreprooued vallour, Should be high minded: couch it not so low, Dost heare me? take occasion to slip hence, But secretly, let not thy mother see thee, At the backside there is a Cunny greene, Stay there for me, and Mall and will come to thee.
Enough, will: mother you doe me wrong, To be so peremptory in your commaund, And see that rascall to abuse me so.
Coom Rascall, take that and take all, do ye heare sir, doe not meane to pocket vp this wrong.

Yes could haue said to you sir, take heed is a good reed.
Why to me take heede? Ni, For happy is he whom other mens harms do make to beware.

Should not sir' should not hate a harlot, That robs me of my right, vide boy? Mi.

Well tis not time of night to hold out chat, With such a scold as thou art, therefore now, Thinke that hate thee as doe the deuill.
Well, will finde a time to be reueng'd: Mean time Ile keep my daughter from thy sonne, Where are you minion? how now are yee gone.
He is not heere· then they split away both together.
Ile assure ye no, my sister she went in, into the house, Mi.
But then sheele out againe at the backe doore, And meete with him, but will search about, All these same fields and paths neere to my house, They are not far am sure, if make haste, Exit.
God how went he hence? did not see him, It was when Barnes wife did scolde with me, plague on her, Dick why didst not thou looke to him? Coo.
What should looke for him? no, no, looke not for him while to morrow morning.
Come go with me to help to looke him out, Alas, haue nor light, nor Linke, nor Torche, Though it be darke, will take any paines, To crosse this match, prethy Dick away.
Coo. Mistris because brought ye out, Ile bring ye home but if should follow, so hee might haue the law on his side.
Exeunt M. Ba. Philip thy mothers gone to seeke thy sister.
And in a rage faith, but who comes heere? Phi.
What master Barnes did ye not see my wife? M. Bar.

Phil, To seeke your sonne, who slipt away from her, To meete with Mall my sister in a place Where appointed: and my mother too, Seeke for my sister, so they both are gone, My mother hath a Torch, mary your wife Goes darkling vp and downe, and Coomes before her.
thought that knaue was with her, but tis well, pray God they may come by nere a light, But both be led a darke daunce in the night.
Why is my fellow Dick in the dark with my Mistres.
pray God they be honest, for there may be much knauerie in the Dark, faith if were there, wold haue some knauery with them, good maister wil ye carry the torch your self, giue me leaue to play the blind man buffe with my mistris, Phil.
On that condition thou wilt do thy best, To keep thy Mistresse and thy fellow Dick, Both from my sister, and thy masters sonne, will intreate thy master let thee goe. Hod.
I, warrant ye, ile haue fine tricks to cousen them M, Gou.
About our cunny green they surely are, if thou canst find them.
Well, now will to Franke and to my sister, Stand you two harkning neere the cunny greene, But sure your light in you must not seene, Or els let Nicholas stand a farre off with it, And as his life keep it from mistris Goursey, Shall this be done? M. Bar.
Phillip it shall, Phi, God be with ye, ile gone.
Come on master Goursey, this fame is a meanes, To make our wiues friends, if they resist not.
Exeunt Enter Mall, Mal. Heere is the place where Philip bid me stay, Till Francis came, but wherefore did my bother, Appoint heere? why in the Cunny borough? He had some meaning in't warrant ye, Well heere ile set me downe vnder this tree, And thinke vpon the matter all alone, Good Lord what pritty things these Cunnies are, How finely they do feede till they be fat, And then what a sweet meate a Cunny is, And what smooth skins they haue, both black and gray, They say they run more in the night then day, What is the reason? marke, why in the light, They see more passengers then in the night, For harmfull men many a haye do set.
And laugh to see them tumble in the net, And they put ferrets in the holes, fie, fie, And they go vp and downe where connies lye, And they lye still, they haue so little wit, maruell the Warriner will suffer it, Nay, nay, they are so bad, that they themselues, Do giue consent to catch these prettie elfes, How if the Warriner should spie me heere? He would take me for a conny dare sweare, But when that Francis comes, what will he say? Looke boy there lyes a conney in my way: But soft, a light, whose that? sould my mother, Nay then all hid, faith she shall not see me, Ile play bo peepe with her behinde this tree.
maruell where this wench doth hide her selfe So closely? haue searcht in many a bush, Mal. Belike my mother tooke me for a Thrush, Mis. Bar.

all To saue a lye mother, say if you can.
theres the spight, What trick shall now haue to scape her light? Mi.
Whose there? what minion is it you? Beshrew her heart, what a fright she put me to, But am glad found her, though was afraide, Come on your wayes, you are a handsome maide, Why you foorth a doores so late at night? Why whether go ye? come stand still say.
M. Ba. Tis not the best way, stand by me tell yee. all.
Mal Faith mother then Ile trie how you can runne, Mis. Bar.
prethie speake, why Mal say? know thou art not farre, if thou wilt not speake, why mal, But now see shees in her mery vaine, To make me call and put me to more paine, Well, must bea with her, sheel beare with me, But will call, least that it be not so, What Mall? what Mall say, boy are we right? Haue we not mist the way this same darke night? Boy.
Masse it may be so as am true man, haue not seene a cunny since came, Yet at the we should meete, But harke, heare the trampling of some feete.
Where am quoth a, mary may be where any body will say am, eyther in France or at Rome, or at Ierusalem they may say am, for am not able to disproue them, because cannot tell where am.
what a blindfold walke haue we had Dicke, To seeke my sonne and yet cannot finde him? Coo.
Why tis so darke we shall not finde the way.
pray God ye may not mother till it be day.
Lead thou the way, and let me hold by thee, Bo. Dick what difference is there between a blind man, and he that cannot see? Fra.
Gou. Dicke looke about, It may be here we may finde them out.
see the glimpes of some body heere, And ye be a sprite Ile fraie the bug beare, There a goes mistresse.
How like a beauteous Lady maskt in blacke, Lookes that same large circumference of heauen, The skie that was so faire three houres agoe, Is in three houres become an Ethiope, And being angrie at her beauteous change, She will not haue one of those pearled starres, To blab her sable metamorphesis, Tis very darke, did appoint my sister, To meete me at the cunny berrie below, And Francis too, but neither can see, Belike my mother hapned on that place.
And fraide them from it, and they both are now Wandring about the fields, how shall finde them? It is so darke, scarse can see my hand, Why then Ile hollow for them, no not so, So will his voice betray him to our mothers, And if he answere, and bring them where he is.
What shall then do? it must not be so? Sbloud it must be so, how else pray? Shall stand gaping heere all night till day? And then nere the neere, so ho, so ho. Wil.
So ho, come, where are ye? where art thou? Phi How now Franke, where hast thou been? Wil. Franke, what Franke? sbloud is sir Raph mad, heeres the bow.

So ho, so ho, nay then sir Raph so whoore, For a whore she was sure, if you had her here So late, now you are sir Raphe Smith, Well do ye counterfeit and change your voyce, But yet know ye, but what should be that Francis? Belike that Francis cussend him of his wench, And he conceals himselfe to finde her Tis so vpon my life, well will go And helpe him ring his peale so ho, soho, Enter Franke.
plague on Coomes, a plague vpon the boy· plague too, not on my mother for an hundreth bound, Twas time to runne, and yet had not thought My mother could haue followed me so close, Her legges with age thought had foundered, She made me quite runne through a quickset hedge, Or she had taken me: well may say, haue runne through the briers for a wenche, And yet haue her not, the woorse lucke mine, Me thought heard one hollow here about, iudge it Philip, the slaue will laugh When as he heares how that my mother scarde me, Well, heere Ile stand vntill heare him hollow, And then Ile answere him, he is not farre.
Ra. my man is hollowing for me vp and downe, And yet cannot meet with him, so ho: Franke.

Whats this, so late a wenching doth he say? Indeed tis true, am thus late a wenching, But am forc'st to wench without a wench.
Why then you might haue tane your bow at first, And gone and kilde abucke, and not haue been So a drabbing, and be nere the neere.
Swounds what a pussell am in this night, But yet Ile put this fellow farther, Doost thou heare man? am not sir Smith.
As thou doost thinke am, but did meete him, Euen as thou saiest in pursuite of a wench.

Wil. Sbloud my wench, swounds were he ten sir Raphs.

They say men moyle and toile for a poore liuing, so moyle and toile, am liuing thanke God, in good time be it spoken, it had been better for me my mistresse angell had beene light, for then perhaps it had not lead me into this darknesse, well, the diuell neuer blesses a man better, when he purses vp angels by owlight, ranne through a hedge to take the boy but stuck in the ditch, and lost the boy: swounds a plague on that clod, that that ditch, or what the deuil so ere it were, for a man cannot see what it was, well, would not for the prize of my sword any body should see me in this taking for it would make me but cut off their legges for laughing at me, well, downe am, and downe meane to be, because am wearie, but to tumble downe thus, it was no part of my meaning, then since am downe, here ile rest me, and no man shall remooue me.

Coo. Sirra, thou Grashoper, that shalt skip from my sword as from a Sith, Ile cut thee out in collops egs, in sleekes, in beefe, and fry thee with the fire, shall strike from the pike of they Buckler.
No indeed, what so ere thinke, and thought is free.

Well, see the foole wil not leaue his bable for the Tower of London.
Coo. Sbloud how pursey am, well see exercise is all, must practise my weapons oftner, must haue a goale or two at before come to my right kind, giue me thy hand Nicholas, thou art a better man then took thee for, and yet thou art not so good a man as I. Ni.
You dwell neighbors Richard, that makes yee praise your selfe.
Ni. Yes Ile say so if should see you hangd.
Coo. Hangd ye Roge, nay then haue at yee, swounes the light is gone.
Ni. Lord, it is as darke as Pitch, Coo, Well heere Ile lye with my buckler thus, least striking vp and downe at the roge might hurt me, for cannot see to saue it, and Ile hold my peace, least my voyce should bring where am.
haue a cloake for the raine, a bad shift is better then none at all, Ile sit heere as if were as dead as a doore naile.
And yet it is our haps to meete with none.
maruell where your Hodge is, and my man? M. Gour.
Nor with the boye, nor Mall, nor Franke, nor Phillip: Nor yet with Coomes, and yet we nere stood still.
Well am very angry with my wife, And she shall finde am not pleasd with her, If we meete nere so soone, but tis my hap, She hath had as blind a iourney out as we, Pray God she haue, and worse if worse may be.
This is but short liu'de enuie Maister Coursey: But come, what say yee to my pollicie? M. Gou.
faith tis good, and we will practise it, But sir it must be handeled cunningly, Or all is mard, our wiues haue subtill heads, And they will soone perceiue a drift deuise.
Was euer man deluded thus like me, thinke some spirit leads me thus amisse: As haue ofte~ heard, that some haue bin thus in the nights.
But yet this mases me where ere come, Some askes me still for Franke or Phillip, And none of them can tell me where Will is.
Rap. Sownes now heere foure hollow at the least, One had a little voice, then thats the wench My man hath lost, well will answer all, so ho. Hodg.
No sir, honest Hodge: but pray yee sir did yee not meete with a boye with a Torche, he is runne away from me a plague on him.
Hey day, from Franke and Phillip to a Torche, And to a Boye, nay sownes then hap as twill.
Wil. Phillip, no faith, my names Will, ill will, for was neuer worse, was euen now with him, and might haue been still, but that fell into a ditch and lost him, and now am going vp and downe to seeke him.
Why would haue him go with me to my maisters.
Why sir Raphe Smith, and thether he promist me he would come, if he keepe his worde so tis. M. Ba.
Why he holloed for one Francis, and Francis hollod for him, hallod for my maister, and my maister for me, but we mist still meeting contrary, Phillip Francis with me my maister, and my maister with Philip and Franke.
Why he ment to kill a Buck, Ile say so to saue his honestie, but my Nan was his marke, when he sent me for his bow, and when came, hollod for him, but neuer saw such luck to misse him, it hath almost made me mad.
Well stay with vs, sir Raphe and he, Will come anon, harke do heere one hollo.
Is this broad waking in a winters night, am broad walking in a winters night: Broad indeed, because am abroad, But these broad fields me thinks are not so broad, That they may keepe me foorth of narrow ditches, Heers a hard warld for can hardly keep my selfe vpright in it, am maruellous dutifull, but so ho. Wil.
Nay, not hanging, but drowning, Wert thou in a pond or a ditche? Wil.
pestilence on it, ist you Phillip, no faith, was but durty a little, but heeres one or two askt for yee. Phil.
The dayes of ignorance are past and done, But am sure the nights of ignorance Are not yet past, for this is one of them, But wheres my sister? M. Bar.
VVhat neither he, nor I, nor she nor you, Nor I, nor she, nor you, and now, Can meet, could meet, or nere thinke shall meete, Cal ye this no tis Christmas sport of Hob ma~ blind All blind, all seek to catch, all misse: but who comes heere? Enter Franke and his Boye.
haue catcht yee sir, it was your dooing, That me haue this pritty daunce to night, Had not you my mother had not scard me, But will swinge ye for it.
Keepe the Kings peace, Fran How? art thou become a Constable? VVhy Phillip where hast thou bin all this while? Phi.
Why where you were not, but pray whers my sister? Fran.
Why man saw her not, but haue sought her as should seeke.
needle haue yee not? Why you man are the needle that she seekes To worke withall, well Francis do you heere, You must not answere so, that you haue sought her, But haue yee found her, faith and if you haue, God giue yee ioy of that ye found with her, Fra saw her not, how could finde her.
Why, could yee misse form Maister Barnses house vnto his Cunnyberry? Fran.
Father did, well wilt thou beleeue me, Thou dost not know how much this same doth greeue me Shall it be said thou mist so plaine away, When as so faire a wenche did for thee stay.
Sownes man, and if thou hadst bin blinde, The thou needst must finde: tell thee Francis had it bin my case, And had bin a woer in thy place, would haue laide my head vnto the ground, And sented out my wenches way like a Hound: would haue crept vpon my knees all night, And made the flint stones Linckes to giue me light, Nay man would.
Good Lord what you would doe, Well we shall see one day how you can woe.
Come, come, we see that we haue all bin crost.
Am alone? doth not my mother come? Her torch see not, which well might see, If any way she were comming toward me, VVhy then belike shees gone some other way, And may she go till bid her turne, Farre shall her way be then, and little faire, For she hath hindered me of my good turne, God send her wet and wearie ere the turne, had beene at Oxenford, and to morrow, Haue beene releast from all my maidens sorrow.
And tasted ioy, had not my mother bin, God beseech thee make it her worst sinne, How many maides this night lyes in their beds, And dreame that they haue lost their maidenheads, Such dreames, such slumbers had to enioyde, If waking mallice had not them destroide, starued man with double death doth dye, To haue the meate might saue him in his eye, And may not haue it so am tormented, To starue for ioy see yet am preuented, VVell Franke, although thou woedst and quickly wonne, Yet shall my loue to thee be neuer done, Ile run through hedge and ditch, through brakes briers To come to thee, sole Lord of my desires, Short woing is the best, an houre, not yeares, For long debating loue is full of feares, But heare one tread, wert my brother, Or Franke, or any man, but not my mother.
when will this same yeare of night haue end? Long lookt for daies sunne, when wilt thou ascend? Let not this theese friend misty vale of night, Incroach on day, and shadow thy faire light, Whilst thou com'st tardy from my Thetes bed, Blushing foorth golden haire and glorious red, stay not bright lanthorne of the day, To light my mist way feete to my right way? Mall.
It is a man, his big voice tels me so, Much am not acquainted with it tho, And yet mine eare sounds true distinguisher, Boyes that haue been more familiar, With it then now am, well, doe iudge, It is not enuies fellon not of grudge, Therefore Ile plead acquaintance, hyer his guiding, And buy of him some place of close abiding, Till that my mothers mallice be expired, And we may ioy in that is long desired, whoses there? Ra.
Are ye a maide? no question this is she, My man doth misse, faith since she lights on me, doe not meane till day to let her goe, For what she is my mans loue will know, Harke ye mayde, if mayde, are ye so light, That you can see to wander in the night.
Mal. Harke ye true man, if true, tell you no, cannot see at all which way goe. Ra. Fayre mayde ist so, say had ye nere a fall, Mal Fayre man not so, no had none at all.
No, no, such blocke till now came in my way.
Ra. Am that blocke sweet tripe, then fall and try.
The grounds too hard, a not I. Ra. Why how and you had met with such a stumpe? Mal.
Why if he had been your height meant to iumpe? Ra.
You'l nere strike rascall? Ra. Yes when ye art there.
No sir, it fits not maides to fight with men.
No faith, care not greatly if tell it, My name is Marie Ra.
Why sir Raph Smith doth wonder wench at this Why whats the cause thou art abroad so late? Mal.
What sir Raph Smith, nay then will disclose, All the hole cause to him, in him repose, My hopes, my loue, God him hope did send, Our loues and both our mothers hates to end, Gentle sir Raph if you my blush might see, You then would say am ashamed to be Found like a wandring stray by such a knight, So farre from home at such a time of night, But my excuse is good, loue first by fate Is crost, controuled, and sundered by fell hate, Franke Goursey is my loue, and he loues me, But both our mothers hate and disagree, Our fathers like the match, and wish it don, And so it had, had not our mothers come, To Oxford we concluded both to go, Going to they came, we parted so, My mother followed me, but ran fast, Thinking who went from hate had need make hast, Take me she cannot though she still persue, But now sweet knight, do repose on you.
Be you my Orator and plead my right, And get me one good day for this bad night.
Ra. Alas good heart, pitty thy hard hap, And Ile employ all that may for thee, Franke Goursey wench, doe commend thy choyse, Now remember met one Francis As did seeke my man, then that was he, And Philip too, like that was thy brother, why now find how did loose my self, And wander vp down, mistaking so, Giue me thy hand Mall, will neuer leaue.
Till haue made your mothers friends againe, And purchast to ye both your hearts delight, And for this same one bad, many a good night, Twill not be long ere that Aurora will.
Deckt in the glory a goldon sunne, Open the christall windowes of the East, To make the earth enamourde of thy face, When we shall haue cleare light to see our way, Come, night being done, expect a happy day.
Enter mistresse Barnes Mis. Ba what a race this peeuish girle hath led me? How fast ran and now how weary am, am so out of breath scarce can speake.
What shall doe? and cannot ouertake her, It is late and darke, and am far from home.
May there not theeues lye watching heere about, Intending mischiefe vnto them they meete, There may, and am much affrayde of them, Being alone without all company, doe repent me of my comming foorth, And yet do not, they had else been married, And that would not for ten times more labour.
But what a winter of colde feare stole, Freecing my heart least danger should betide me, What shal do to purchase company? heare some hollow here about the fields, Then here Ile set my Torch vpon this hill, Whose light shall conduct them to it, They that haue lost theyr way seeing a light, Will come to it, well, here ile lye vnseene, For it may be seene farre off in the night, And looke who comes, and chuse my company, Perhaps my daughter may first come to it.
Where am now? nay where was euer now, Nor now, nor then, nor where shall be, know I, thinke am going home may as well Be going from home, tis so very darke, cannot see how to direct a step, lost my pursuing of my sonne, My sonne escapt me too, now all alone, am enforst to wander vp and downe, Barnses wife's abroad pray God that she: May haue as good a daunce, nay ten times worse, Oh but feare she hath not, she hath light To see her way, that some bridge would breake That she might fall into some deep digd ditch, And eyther breake her bones or drowne her selfe, would these mischiefes could wish to her, Might light on her, but soft see a light, will go neere, tis comfortable, After this nights sad spirits dulling darknes, How now? What is it set to keep it selfe? Mis. Bar.
Sure none is heere to hinder me, And light me home.
Yet Barnses wife would chafe if that she knew, That had this good to get a light.
And so she doth, but praise you lucke at parting.
that it were her light good faith, that she, Might darkling walke about as well as I. Mi.
Ba. how this mads me, that she hath her wish, Mi.
But who should set it here maruel a Gods name?
One that will hau'te from you in the deuils name Mi.
Go. lle lay my life that it was Barnses sonne.
Gou, plague vpon her, how she made me start? Mistresse let goe the Mis. Bar.
Why how now woman, how vnlike to women, Are ye both now? come part, come part say.
M. Ba. Why what immodesty it this in you? Come part say, fie, fie.
Ba. Fie, fie, she shall not haue my torch, Giue me thy torch boy, will run a tilt, And burne out both her eyes in my encounter.
say ye shall not, wife go to, tame your thoughts, That are so mad with fury.
And sweet wife, Temper you rage with patience, do not be Subiect so much to such misgouernment.
Bar Shal not sir, when such a strumpet wrongs me? M. Go.
How, strumpet mistris Barnes, nay pray harke ye, oft indeed haue heard you call her so, And haue thought vpon it, why ye should Twither with name of strumpet, Do you know any hurt by her, that you terme her so? M. Ba.
No on my life, rage onely makes her say so, M. Go.
My wiues intemperance hath got that name, And mistresse Barnes, doubt and shrewdly doubt, And some great cause begets this doubt in me, Your husband and my wife doth wrong vs both.
How? thinke ye so, nay master Goursey then You run indebt to my opinion, Because you pay not such aduised wisedome, As thinke due vnto my good conciet.
Then arrest you in the name of loue, Not bale, but present answere to my plea, And in the Court of reason we will trie, If that good thoughts should beleeue ielousie, Phil.
Why looke you mother, this is long of you, For Gods sake father harke, why these effects Come still from womens malice, part pray, Comes, VVil. and Hodge come all and helpe vs part them, Father, but heare me speake one word no more: Franke.
Maister heare him speake, hees a good wise young stripling, for his yeeres tel ye, perhaps may speake wiser then an elder body, therefore heare him.
Master heare and make an end, you may kil one another in iest, and be hanged in earnest.
Come let vs heare him, then speake quickly Philip M. Ba. Thou shouldst haue done ere this, speak Phil.
Lord what haste you make to hurt your selues Good Phillip vse some good perswasions To make them friends.
Yes, Ile doe what can, Father and Master Goursey both attend, It is presumption in so young a man, To teach where he might learne or be derect, Where he hath had direction but in duety.
He may perswade as long as his perswase, Is backt with reason and a rightfull sute, Phisickes first rule is this, as haue learned, Kill the effect by cutting of the cause, The same effects of ruffin outrages, Comes by the cause of mallice in your wines, Had not they two bin foes, you had bin friends, And we had bin at home, and this same war, In peacefull sleep had nere bin dreamt vpon, Mother, and mistresse Goursey to make them friends, Is to be friends your selues, you are the cause, And these effects proceed you know from you, Your hates giue life vnto these killing But dye, and if that in you, Fathers yet stay, speake, stay a while, Francis perswade thy mother maister Goursey, If that my mother will resolue your mindes, That tis but meere suspect, not common proofe, And if my father sweares hees innocent, As durst pawne my soule with him he is, And if your vow truth and constancy, Will you be then perswaded? M. Gou. Phillip, if thy father will remit, The wounds gaue him, and if these conditions May be performde, bannish all my wrath.
And if thy mother will but cleere me Phillip, As am ready to protest am, Then master Goursey is my friend againe.
Harke mother, now you heare that your desires, May be accomplished, they both be friends If you'l performe these articles.
Why? it not, her spirit may he such, M. Go. why will it be?
Mother, why mother, why heare ye, Giue me your hand, it is no more but thus, Tis easie labour to shake hands with her.
little breath is spent in speaking of faire words, When wrath hath violent deliuered, M. Bar.
husband stay, Stay Maister Goursey, though your wife doth hate me, And beares vnto me mallice infinite.
And endlesse, yet will respect your safeties, would not haue you perish by our meanes, must confesse, that onely suspect, And no proofe els, hath fed my hate to her.
And husband protest by heauen and earth, That her suspect is causles and vniust, And that nere had such a vilde intent, Harme she imaginde, where as none was ment.
Yes Phillip this: That confirme him in my Innocence, By this large vniuerse.
By that sweare, ile credit none of you, vntill heere Friendship concluded straight betweene them two, If see that they willingly will doe, Then ile imagine all suspition ends, may be then assured they being friends.
VVhy this is well, the other will trie, Come Mistresse Goursey, do you first agree? Mi.
Nay then finde this goes forward still: Mother giue me your hand, giue me yours to, Be not so loath, some good thing must doe, But lay your Torches by, like not them, Come, come, deliuer them vnto your men, Giue me your hands, so now sir heere stand, Holding two angrie women in my hand, And must please them both, could please tone, But it is hard when there is two to one, Especially of women, but tis so, They shall be pleasd whether they will or no, Which will come first? what both giue back, ha, neither? Why then yond may helpe that come both together, So stand still, stand but a little while, And see how your angers will beguile, Well yet there is no hurt, why then let me, Ioyne these two hands, and see how theil agree, Peace, peace, they crie, looke how they friendly kisse, VVell all this while there is no harme in this, Are not these two twins? twins should be both alike, If tone speakes faire, the tother should not strike, Iesus these warriours will not offer blowes, VVhy then tis strange that you two should be foes, yes, youle say your weapons are your tongnes, Touch lip with lip and they are bound from wrongs, Go to, imbrace, and say if you be friends, That heere the angrie womens quarrels ends, Mi.
What saist thou Franke, doth not this fall out well? Fran.
Yes if my Mall were heere, then all were well.
Yonder they be Mall, stay, stand close and stur not Vntil call: God saue yee Gentlemen.
VVhat sir Raph Smith, you are a welcome man, VVe wondred when we heard you were abroad.
VVhy sir, how heard yee that was abroad? M. Bar.
It had bin better and he had said, a sure carde.
An Asse goes a foure legs, go of two crosse.
Go to, no more a doe, gentle sir Raphe, Your man is not in fault for missing you, For he mistooke by vs and we by him.
And by you, which now well perceiue, But tell me Gentlemen, what made yee all, Be from your beds this night, and why thus late Are your wiues walking heere about the fields? Tis strange to see such women of accoumpt, Heere, but some great occasion, M. Gour.
And iarre they did to day, and so they parted, We knowing womens mallice let alone, Will Canker like farther in their hearts, Did seeke a sodaine cure, and thus it was, match betweene his daughter and my sonne, No sooner motioned but twas agreed, And they no sooner saw but wooed and likte, They haue it sought to crose, and crosse it thus.
Rap. mistresse Barnes and mistresse Goursey both, The greatest sinne wherein your soules may sinne, thinke is this, in crossing of true loue, Let me perswade yee. Mi.
Sir we are perswaded, And and mistresse Goursey are both friends, And if my daughter were but found againe, Who now is missing, she had my consent, To be disposd off to her owne content.
do reioyce, that what thought to doe, Ere begin, finde already done, Why this will please your friends at Abington, Franke, if thou seekst that way, there thou shalt finde Her, whom holde the comfort of thy minde.
He shall not seeke me, will seeke him out, Since of my mothers graunt need not doubt.
Thy mother graunts my girle, and she doth pray To send vnto you both a day.
Nay mistresse Barnes, wish her better, that those ioyfull dayes may be turnd to ioyfull nights.
Coom Faith tis a pretty wench, and tis pitty but she should haue him.
And mistresse Mary, when yee go to bed, God send you good rest, and a peck of Fleas in your nest, euery one as big as Francis.
Well said wisdome, God send thee wise children, Nich And you more money.
Twill be a good while, ere you wish your skinfull of holes.
Franke, harke ye? brother, now your woings done, The next thing now you do, is for a sonne: prithe, for faith should be glad, To haue my selfe cald Nunckle and thou Dad, if that Francis play the man, My must be Grandam and you Mam, To if Francis, to it sister, God send yee ioy, Tis fine to sing dansey my owne sweet boye.
Well Gentlemen, good hap betide them both, Since twas my hap thus hap thus happily to meete, To be a witnesse of this sweete contract, doe reioyce, wherefore to haue this ioye Longer present with me, do request That all of you will be my promist guests, This long nights labour dooth desire some rest, Besides this wished end, therefore pray, Let me deteine but a dinner time, Tell me pray, shall obtaine so much.
Gentle sir Raphe, your courtesie is such, As may impose commaund vnto vs all, We will be thankfull bolde at your request, Phil.
pray sir Raph, what cheere shall we haue? S. Raph.
faith countrie fare, mutton and Veale, Perchance a Ducke or Goose.
Father and mother if you needs would know, He namde a Goose, which is my stomacks foe.
Come, come, she is with childe of some odiest, And now shees sicke till that she bring it foorth, Mal. Aiest quoth you? well brother if it be, feare twill prooue an earnest vnto me, Goose said ye sir? oh that same very name, Hath in it much variety of shame, Of all the birds that euer yet was seene, would not haue them graze vpon this greene, hope they will not, for this, crop is poore, And they may pasture vpon greater store.
But yet tis pittie that they let them passe, And like a Common bite the Muses grasse, Yet this feare if Franke and should kisse, Some creeking goose would chide vs with a hisse, meane not that goose sings it knowes not what.
Tis not that hisse when one saies hist come hither, Nor that same hisse that setteth dogges together, Nor that same hisse that by a fire doth stand, And hisseth T. or F. vpon the hand, But tis a hisse, and Ile vnlace my cote, For should sound sure if heard that note, And then greene Ginger for the greene goose cries, Serues not the turne, turn'd the white of eyes, The Rosasolis yet that makes me liue, Is fauours that these Gentlemen may giue, But if they be displeased, then pleasde am I, To yeeld my selfe a hissing death to dye, Yet hope heeres none consents to kill, But kindly take the fauour of good will.
If any thing be in the pen to blame, Then here stand to blush the writers shame.
Trust him, and he will prooue a right true debter.

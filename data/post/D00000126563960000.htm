the preface

what the design of this plain discourse is need not tell any one that reads and understands the title of it for by that he may see that my business therein is to make it plain to every one that can understand reason that it is a very foolish thing for one to persuade himself that there is no god
whether have done this or no is a question which am not concerned to answer any otherwise than by desiring him that asks it seriously to read and consider the whole discourse and when he hath done so

laying aside all prejudice and partiality to answer it to himself
if he will not be at this pains cannot help it but as heartily bless almighty god who hath enabled me to do it to my own full satisfaction so most humbly beseech his divine majesty that all who are not satisfied with what is here done may not fail to find all that satisfaction elsewhere which they do not meet with here

if any one shall slight this discourse as a thing wholly needless although he grant it to be convincing and to prove the thing which have undertaken to prove say in the first place that could heartily wish that it were indeed as needless as he thinks it to be
nothing should make me more glad than to be well assured that have lost my labour upon no other account but this that no man is in danger of losing his god through unbelief
but in the next place must say also that fear he is mistaken

for if this discourse be needless supposing withal that it be convincing it must be for one of these two reasons either first because all men do already believe that there is a god and therefore all discourses on this subject are needless
or secondly because there is enough already written by others to persuade men into this belief and therefore this discourse is needless

he that for the former of these two reasons thinks not only this but all discourses tending to persuade men to believe there is a god to be needless seems to me too little to consider how most men live in the world
it is a very sad and uncomfortable thing to be thought on but alas a thing every where too visible that very many persons both high and low behave themselves in all their ways so irreligiously and regardlesly of god and of his holy laws that one can hardly imagine how

they could did they on purpose themselves to do it give the world any clearer proof that they have not any sense of god than now they do
the abounding of all sorts of wickedness and prophaneness and the great indulgence people give every where to themselves in all manner of vice and vanity their deriding of serious piety mocking at a conscienciousstrictness and regularity of life and even glorying in their own sins which they know to be against the plainest laws of god and threatned by him with no less than eternal damnation seem to me a most evident sign that men do not really believe that there is a god
the transgression of the wicked saith the psalmist psal

saith within my heart that there is no fear of god before his eyes
and whence should it proceed that men fear not god but hence that either they are not throughly convinced that there is a god to be feared or they understand so little of

god or what god is that they know not for what he is to be feared and therefore as tis said psal

they contemn god

tis true indeed that there are not many among us who do openly deny that there is a god or who will not say that they believe there is one
but tis as true also that of many of these who make this profession we may use the words of st paul tit

they profess that they know god but in works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate
in rehearsing the articles of the christian faith every one of us saith for believe in god
but how many of us unsay it again in our unchristian and ungodly conversation our works do much trulier speak the sense of our hearts than our words are wont to do
shew me thy faith without thy works and

will shew thee my faith by my works
so st james challengeth him that would needs be thought to have a christian faith whilst he observed not the laws of god
we may well say the same to every one that professeth to believe there is a god and yet leads an ungodly life
if our hearts and tongues do well agree when we say we believe there is a god it seems one of the hardest things in the world to conceive how our lives should so much disagree with them both
if we did really believe what we say we believe one would think we should be more afraid than we are of living so unanswerably to our belief and more ashamed than we are of living so unagreeably to our profession

if a man would demonstrate to the world that he doth but dissemble and lye when he saith he believes that there is a god by what other way could he do this than by

living a wicked life and why then should we not be convinced of it that this profession of his is indeed a lye when he proves it to us as well as such a thing can be proved he lives and acts in all things as pleaseth his own humour and lust he behaves himself as one that owns no superior power to restrain him from doing wickedly be breaks all the laws of god and man as far as he hath a mind and strength enough to do it he seems impatient of living any longer than he may be his own master or have the liberty to serve the flesh he takes all liberty that he can get and doth as wickedly as he dare for fear of men he regards nothing besides his temporal safety but his own will and pleasure and after all this what clearer demonstration can he give us that he doth not believe there is a god whom he is bound to serve

and now if this be true am sure there is much need of discourses against atheism

wickedness of all sorts did never more abound nor triumph in the world than now it doth and therefore there never was more need of a reformation of mens lives and manners than now there is but in vain are all endeavours to that purpose so long as men do not believe that there is a god over them to whom they owe a duty and are accountable for their whole behaviour
till men be convinced of this tho they may possibly by force be kept from doing some sorts of evil they can never be reformed or persuaded to be good
but if they may once be throughly convinced of this it may also be hoped that they may be persuaded to account it both their duty and their interest to live a godly life and as st paul speaks col
to walk worthy of god unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work

but supposing such discourses needful yee will some say what need was there

of this sceing there are already so many both larger and learneder on the same subject in answer to this have no more to say but these things
first do very readily and with all due thankfulness both to god and the learned authors acknowledg that there be many both larger and learneder discourses on this subiect than this is
but secondly even for this very reason that they are so large and learned they are the less serviceable to that sort of people for whose use this is principally design'd
as men of strong reason and good learning can make good use of long and learned discourses and receive much benefit by them so men of weak understandings and of little or no learning stand in need of short and plain discourses such as they can from their necessary business get time to read and such as reading they are able to understand for their sake it is that publish this and therefore have used as great plainness

of expression in it as possibly could and yet am very sure of it no more than is needful to make them understand it
no man can deny but such people ought to live religiously as well as others and therefore ought to be well grounded in the first principles of religion
and they must be taught in such a way as they are able to learn is we design to teach them any thing and therefore in teaching them we must use both such arguments and such language as are not too hard for them or we lose our labour and they all the benefit they should reap by it

if this be not enough to excuse me at least for publishing this discourse and for writing it too with so much plainness as if be not deceiv'd have done will only add this that had rather be blamed for being impertinent by them who either need it not themselves or see not the need that others have of it than bear the

rebuke of my own conscience for not doing what am verily persuaded to be very needful in the best manner could do it tho not half so well as another might have done it

the folly of atheism

we find wicked men or such as have no religion by the holy ghost himself in scripture frequently called fools and how hard soever it may be to make such a fool understand or acknowledg his own name we are very sure he deserves it because the spirit of truth as the holy ghost is called ioh

hath given it him
the man of a wicked life if he have any thoughts at all of god must think either that there is a god or that there is none
if he thinks that there is a god he must needs be a fool for living wickedly and wilfully provoking god's wrath and indignation against himself which he knows himself unable either to withstand or indure
if

he thinks that thire is no god the holy ghost by the mouth of david hath told us twice over for our better assurance that he is a fool for that
the fool saith he hath said in his heart there is no god psal


and indeed the truth of what he hath told us is as clear to every one who hath reason and will use it to any good purpose as the light it self can be to him who hath and will make use of his sight

to make this plain to the meanest capacity is my present business and to this end in the first place desire that these three things may be consider'd in the words of the holy ghost which say contain so clear a truth


what is said there is no god
how tis said in his heart

who hath said it the fool hath said


that which is said is this there is no god doth he who saith this understand what he saith if he do not he is a fool for saying he knows not what
doth he know what the word signifies if he do not he saith he knows not what
god is he that made the world and all things therein the lord of heaven and earth who giveth to all life and breath and all things

in whom we live and move and have our being acts

this is that which all the world hath ever meant by this word the first of all beings who is of himself from all eternity without beginning which gave being to all things that ever were and in which as in the first fountain is all being and life and power and wisdom and goodness of whom and through whom and to whom are all things to whom be glory for ever amen
rom


this then is it which is said tho there be a world yet it had no maker
as much as to say tho there be a stately a useful a richly furnished and wisely contrived house yet it had no builder
tho there be many things yet was there no first cause of their being tho all things are disposed in a very wonderful wise order yet was there no wise orderer of them
we men who were not always came into this world no body knows how we are provided for here no body knows by whom we are dayly going hence no body knows whither we have no maker to whom we owe our being no owner whose we are no preserver whom we are to thank for any thing no lord or governour whom we are to obey to whom we must be accountable whose favour or

displeasure we need to regard we may do what we will with our selves and all we can to any other whether it be good or hurt
we may get whatever we can by any means for our selves and from others we may do what we will with it when we have got it
all religion is a vain thing and civil government is but a crafty contrivance of men
we are under no laws but such as we please to make to our selves
who is lord over us psal

this is it that is said in saying there is no god
and surely there does not appear any wisdom in all this


he that saith this saith it in his heart
he is not so ignorant of god as one who never heard of any such thing
if any one be so ignorant tis certain he's a fool and greatly to be pitied for his folly but in what part of the world he should be found know not
he that saith in his heart there is no god talks of him within himself and therfore hath heard of him
yet some who have heard of god are wholly careless and regardless of him and very indifferent whether he be or no their hearts are at rest within them and seem unconcern'd about this matter this is great folly and tis well if there be not many such fools of whom it may be said god is not in all their thoughts

psal

some there may be also who wish with all their hearts and could heartily desire that there were no god that so without all fear of him they might live as they list
all these are fools but he that saith in his heart there is no god seems to outgo all these he is come to a conclusion about it and makes himself confident of it
tis true indeed he seems not yet so as openly to say it with his tongue tho some men are grown so impudent as to boast of their folly and to call it wit to talk prophanely and some parts of the world are so with bruitishness as to suffer this yet most men if they be not more modest are however more cunning than to speak out all that they think
tho therefore they think there is no god yet are they sensible how much it concerns them that others should not be taught to think so too or so much as know that they think so
if they should bring others to think as they do they might soon be made to pay dearly for teaching them this lesson for then would all those others take to themselves the same liberty of doing what they list as they desire to have and the world would become a very unsafe place for them to live in
he therefore that saith there is no god is content to say it in his heart only and can be very well content too that

all but himself should think otherwise for his own safety yea lest all they who think there is a god should begin to stand upon their guard against him as an enemy to mankind as they have good reason to account him tho he be so foolish as to say in his heart there is no god yet is he so cunning as to say with his mouth among others believe in god


he that saith in his heart there is no god is the fool no wise man ever said it
the fear of the lord that is wisdom job

the knowledg of the holy is understanding prov

the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledg prov

and of wisdom and a good understanding have they that keep his commandments ps

but fools despise wisdom and instruction prov

and the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness prov

but what fool is he that saith this in the language of the holy ghost the fool is he that goes on in a course of sinning
of him and his fellows david gives us this account in those two psalms the and they are corrupt they have done abominable works there is none that doth good
the lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek god they are all gone aside they are altogether

become filthy there is none that doth good no not one
the fool then is the habitual sinner who being deeply in love with his sin cannot indure to think of parting with it
if there be a god he knows he must very dearly pay for sinning against him and therefore so long as he believes there is a god he cannot enjoy his sins in quietness
he has therefore no way left him but one to sin without a continual disturbance of mind from the checks of his own conscience and that is as much as he can to banish the belief and even all thoughts of god far from him
this then for the love of his sins he is resolved upon and tho it be very hard for him who hath his to open his eyes and not see the light yet he makes a shift so long to wink against the light till at last he quite loseth his sight so long he strives aagainst the belief of a god that at length no arguments can persuade him to believe
resisting the truth god justly punisheth him with his own desire and hides the truth from him for ever because they received not the love of the truth god saith st paul shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lye that they might be damn'd who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness thess


as they did not like to retain

god in their knowledg god gives them over to a reprobate mind rom

and tis most just with god thus to deal with such obstinate fools mean to hide himself for ever from them who have a long time done all that ever they could not to see him
hence the sinner grows more and more a fool and at last arrives at the fool's confidence to believe whatever he has a mind to he saith in his heart there is no god and he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool prov


now having seen these three things what is said how tis said and who hath said it we are to consider how well he deserves the name of fool for saying it that is for persuading himself to believe or for making himself confident that there is no god
and this his folly will undeniably appear very great to every one that takes notice but of three things which are all very visible


he is confident where he cannot have any even the least ground of assurance

he is confident where his confidence can do no good but will do much hurt

he is confident where all the reason in the world is against his confidence

if then there be such a thing in the world as a fool he that saith in his heart or is confident that there is no god must needs be a fool
for


he that is confident there is no god is confident where he cannot have any the least ground of assurance that is he is confident of that which he cannot pretend to know
and is not he a fool that pleaseth himself with such a groundless confidence as this and ventures his soul on that whereof he cannot say that he is in any measure sure no man was ever yet so vain as to undertake to prove that there is no god
some have been either so dull that they could not or so stubborn that they would not see or confess they saw reason enough to convince them that there is a god
and some have been so daring as to do their utmost endeavour to prove that it is not altogether necessary that there must be one or that tis possible there may be none
but either that tis impossible that there should be a god or that of a certainty there is no such thing none hath ever attempted to prove with what confidence so ever he talks of this matter
sum up all that all the atheists in the world have at any time been able to say against the being of a god it amounts to no more but this it may be there is a god and it may be there is not
which

is all one as to say they know not whether there be a god or no
so that even whilst the atheist most confidently denies that there is a god he is forced to confess that for any thing he knows to the contrary there is one
only he imagines there may be no god and as he imagines it to be so he would fain have it to be and therefore he is confident it is just as he imagins it may be and would gladly have it be
and would not any of us laugh at that man who talks with all confidence imaginable of a thing as if he were sure of it and yet when he is askt how he came to know it can give no wiser an answer than this fain would have it so and conceive it may possibly be so and am not yet satisfied it is not as think it may be and therefore am very confident tis just as say would we not say laugh at this as the answer of a fool

ii
it is folly enough for one to be confident without a reason or ground of assurance yet is it a much greater folly on no good ground to be confident where it is exceedingly dangerous to be confident and where the confidence doth certainly much hurt and can do no good
and yet such is his confidence who is confident there is no god

where there are two opinions whereof one knows not which is truest and there is danger in following the one and none in following the other it must needs be acknowledg'd to be a great folly to chuse to follow that opinion wherein there is danger rather than that wherein there is none
if then there be no danger at all in believing there is a god and a great deal of danger in thinking there is none he must needs be a fool that thinks there is no god
now these two things will quickly appear to be true


to believe there is a god even tho there were none doth much good and no hurt

to think there is no god tho it were true doth much hurt and no good


to believe there is a god even tho there were none doth much good and no hurt
it will easily be granted by the atheist himself that if there be a god as we certainly believe there is to believe it is not only our duty but our highest concern
if we have a maker preserver and governour it is very fit and necessary and can no way be hurtful but exceeding good and profitable for us to own him and by all means to endeavour to please him and to keep in his favour seeing that both we and all things are in his hand and power and so totally depend upon

him that we can neither be happy nor indeed be at all but by his blessing protection and providence for in him we live and move and have our being act


we are his people and the sheep of his pasture psal

but say that tho there were no god which yet cannot be to believe that there is one would do much good and no hurt at all

it would do much good because tis plain that this belief which nothing else cou'd do keeps the world in good order and makes men sociable governable and serviceable to one another
this belief of a god is that which keeps us from destroying our selves by lasciviousness intemperance and luxury and from devouring and ruining one another by malice envy pride covetousness and oppression
so that the world owes its happiness to this belief
in short then this belief helps us to live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world tit

and to die comfortably in hope of better things than this world affords when we go out of it
and this certainly is all very good
but now this belief of a god can do no hurt at all
for seeing it naturally inclines men to do good and restrains men from doing hurt it self can no way be hurtful
if it can let the atheist himself shew us what the hurt of it is even supposing there were no god

is this the hurt it doth us that it keeps us from using that liberty which were there no god and we believ'd it we might freelyuse indeed as know not if there were no god what should make it unlawful for any one to use all the liberty he could get so doubt as little but if men thought there were none they would use a great deal more liberty than they do but then tis only because they are fools and consider not their own good
a wise man who is govern'd not by passion but by reason as every man should be would use no more liberty of that kind which wicked men most covet than god now allows us were he sure that there were no god
for god allows us all things that are for the good of our selves and mankind and he forbids us nothing but what visibly tends to the hurt of our selves or others
it can be therefore no other liberty but that of doing hurt which the belief of a god restrains us from and to restrain us from doing hurt cannot be hurtful
a wise man say would not use this liberty tho he might
for he wisely considers that all men would have the same right as he to use that liberty and if they should do so as there could be no reason why they should not as well as he there could be no society no government no safe living by one another in the world

or in the next place is this the hurt which the belief of a god would do supposing there were none that in some cases we must suffer evils which we should not need to suffer were there no god we are poor it may be and yet for fear of god we dare not steal nor rob nor cheat to relieve our selves
we suffer wrong and for fear of god we not revenge our selves and such like
tis true indeed the belief of a god obligeth us to suffer rather than to do evil but it will be found to do us no hurt but good in this
which that we may discern we are to think upon these following things


remember that some of the evils we suffer are unavoidable by us whether there be a god or no
that is they are such as if there be a god none but he can prevent or remove and if there be no god it is not in our power to do either
now in such cases it is a man's wisdom to suffer them with as little trouble to himself as he can seeing he must bear them do what he can impatience fretting and rage do not lessen but double the suffering whatever it be
and then the belief of a god binds us in such cases to no more but to suffer patiently and in humble submission to his will and in hope that doing so all things work together for good to us rom

and that the light affliction which

is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory cor

seeing then such evils must be born all the hurt the belief of god doth us is to enable us to bear them more easily even as much as he that suffers in hope may suffer more cheerfully than he that has no hope


observe that some of these evils are such as we suffer through the wickedness of men
and here we should remember first that were there no belief or fear of god among men where we now suffer one such evil we should suffer a thousand
hope then the belief of a god doth us no hurt in this that it makes our sufferings fewer than otherwise they would be
secondly remember tis for want of this belief that men are so forward to hurt one another for god forbids it and if men believed to the purpose that there is a god forbidding all injuries on pain of damnation they would not dare to do wrong
who then will say that the belief of a god can be hurtful when tis only the want of it whence all such hurts arise well but it will be yet said that were it not for fear of god we might some way or other prevent or remove such evils as these
for a fuller answer to this


take notice that of this kind of evils some are very slight small and easily tolerable others are very grievous and not easily supportable
if the evils we suffer one from another be very small and easie to be born will not a wise man whether there be a god or no rather be content to bear them patiently even for the sake of his own ease and quiet much more for the peace and quiet of the neighbourhood than disturb both himself and his neighbours by beginning and continuing a quarrel about little things and that when the issue is doubtful and he cannot be sure he shall be a gainer in the end if one have a mind to end quarrels speedily and to live in and quietness which certainly is a thing very desireable to put up in patience and silence light and trivial wrongs is both the shortest and easiest the cheapest and most obliging way
and this is it that in such cases the belief of a god doth bind us to
if the evils we suffer from others be very grievous and not easily supportable the laws of god do not forbid us fairly and legally to right and relieve our selves much less do they command us to lay our selves open to such evils or not to guard our selves as well as we can against them or to suffer to pass unpunished
all that

god forbids in such cases is spiteful and unnecessary private revenge
now a wise man again whether there were a god or no would take this very course that god now commands and not that which he forbids
if he be in want or poverty he would use no illegal means of relief if he be wrong'd he would use no illegal ways of righting himself
why because he considers he thus makes himself his own judge and his own carver and so might every one do as well as he and at this rate there could be no civil society or government but all men would be let loose like so many wild beasts to prey upon and devour one another
what hurt then doth the belief of a god do us when it binds us to suffer no otherwise than any wise man would of himself do were he sure there is no god

is this the hurt it doth that it binds us to die rather than any way to dishonour god which we need not do were there no god it is true again that it binds us to this and if there were no god we should not be bound to it
well then saith the atheist can any one pretend that this is no hurt for a man to lose his life and all that's dear to him at once irrecoverably for the sake of god if yet there be no god to this say if there be any hurt at all in this yet is it much less than that which will necessarily

follow the denying of a god yea tho he were not
and this must be granted when these few things have been duly consider'd

first we must all die whether there be a god or no
cannot think that any one of those who doubt whether there be a god doubts too whether or no he shall die he is he thinks too sure of that
and further yet we none of us know either when or how we shall die
it may be tomorrow or before and it may be too in the most painful agony and torment
therefore secondly the worst that can be in our dying for god is this that we may so be made to die a little and we know not how little a while for ought we know not one hour or minute before the time when otherwise we should have died
or we may be made to die in torment and yet for ought we know in far less torment than otherwise we should have died and it may be at the same time
thirdly it cannot be any great hurt to lose a few days of an uncertain and troublesome lifo and such days as for ought we know would have brought so many evils along with them as would have made us wish a thousand times over that we had died sooner and had never seen so much as one of them

fourthly if all men were persuaded that there is no god the wickedness of men would soon make the world so uneasie a place to us that he would think himself the happiest man that could soonest find his way out of it

all this considered tis evident that even the faintest hope that any one could conceive of enjoying a blessed eternity with god must be enough to make him set light by the loss of a few days more of life in this world
he that cannot be sure that there is no god as no man can be and much more he that but thinks there is a god must needs be a fool if he had rather live a while to dishonour god and fall under his wrath than dye a little before his time if he thinks it pleasing to god and rewardable by him
for supposing it uncertain to him whether there be a god or no this were plainly to chuse a worse uncertain thing before a better
it were to chuse a few short days of life which he knows not whether he shall have or no or whether they will be worth having or no yea whether or no they will give him cause to repent that even he had one of them rather than a life of eternal blessedness with god which if there be a god he is sure to have or rather than to secure himself from an endless state of intolerable torments

which if be a god he is sure to fall into who lives to god's dishonour
and now where's the hurt of dying for god even tho there were none

is it this in the last place that such an one shall be disappointed in his hope is it not saith the atheist a very miserable thing to suffer and dye in hope of good things and after he has paid so dear for his hope find it defeated in a moment well but let me tell the atheist he will find it a much more miserable thing to have been confident all his life long that there is no god and then in a moment to find there is one to his everlasting sorrow
however in answer to what he here objects first it is certain that if there be a god his hope who died for god is not defeated and if there be no god then the defeating of his hope can be no misery or hurt to him
he that denies a god denies a future state after death and so according to him the whole man soul and body dies at once as beasts do and has no more sense of any thing after death than they have
now that can be no misery or hurt which cannot be felt and the frustration of his hope cannot be felt by him who has no sense of any thing
if the man that's once dead feels nothing whatever he has lost his loss is nothing at all to him
whilst such an one lived

his hope made his life pleasant and his sufferings tolerable it heightned his joys and it mitigated his sorrows it was his comfort both in life and death and now he is dead if there be a god he enjoys all he hoped for and is glad he took the rough way to heaven and thinks himself well paid for his pains and sufferings and if there be no god he is in as good a condition as all others are neither better nor worse and as they are not sensible of their past pleasures no more is he of his past sorrows
his belief whilst he lived did both himself and others much good and could never hurt either himself or others living or dead


to think there is no god even if there be none doth much hurt no good at all

if there be a god as we cannot doubt but there is the atheist will not deny that his opinion is the most pernicious and mischievous thing in the world
to deprive ones self for ever of his favour and to expose ones self to his unsupportable wrath who alone can save or destroy as he pleaseth to lose eternal joys and run into eternal torments and merely for the enjoyment of a few days of fruitless sin and vanity and for the humouring of a lump of flesh which

must within a few days corrupt and rot in dirt can a man possibly do himself greater hurt than this

and suppose the atheist were in the right what good could his opinion do him nay what hurt would it not do both him and all the world were it generally received whilst he is of this opinion he enjoys a few beastly pleasures and is delighted to live as beasts do and to think that he shall dye as they do too
excellent priviledge what is it else that he can make much of this opinion for but only that he thinks himself at liberty to do as he lists well but whilst he is so fond of a brutish and licentious life that he cannot endure to hear of god because of his love to it would desire to know of him first if this be no to him that he knows this voluptuous life shall so quickly be at an end and that in so short a time yea he knows not how soon all that he now thinks himself happy in shall be gone for ever next if it be no trouble to him to restrain himself from what he most loves for fear of bringing sicknesses pains and death upon himself or that he has at any time so brought these and other like evils upon himself whereby he is become unable to find any relish or pleasure in the things he loves and has nothing left him to ease his again what he has to

administer any comfort or refreshment to him if he fall into any kind of affliction or distress when he can tast nothing but bitterness in this life and yet hath not the least hopes of any other and lastly if it do not trouble him when ever he thinks of it that he cannot be sure that his opinion is true and that for ought he knows to the contrary there may be a god and he may the next moment cast him into hell for the life he now leads cannot but think but when the atheist is at any time awakened to the exercise of his reason and thinks of these things he cannot much boast of the good his opinion doth himself nay that he cannot deny but tis hurtful to him

and should it be once embraced generally by others what would become of him and all the world there would be nothing in a short time visible but disorder and confusion and all manner of mischief and misery were men once persuaded that there is no god no rewarder of the good no punisher of the wicked and that there is nothing either to be hoped for or feared but in this life only
had men none over them to keep them in awe but weak men like themselves what could be expected but that they should fall a tearing and eating up one another would not every one think it his concern and his

right too to make the best he could of this present life to himself as well as he if he thought there were nothing either better or worse to be expected than what this life· affords would not every one who is persuaded that this world is all that ever he must enjoy use his utmost cunning and endeavour without respect to any other person or any regard to right or wrong to pick and chuse and carve out for himself as great a share of it as he possibly could yea tho he must dig through the very bowels of all other men to come at the things he desired to have might not any one challenge as much right to every thing that lay within his reach as any other whatsoever and would not every one catch that could yea and kill too or do any thing else he could that he might catch if it be true that there is no god to whom all are bound to submit what law can any one think himself bound to obey but his own will and would not every one be as free as he could make himself and strive to have his own will rather than to be subject to another's would not every one endeavour to make himself master of as much and as many as he could and would not this striving for the mastery and scrambling who should get most bring all things to confusion could any thing but mere force and violence bring

or keep men under government and would men any longer bear so uneasie a yoke whenever they could find out any way to break or shake it off all the world thus would be turn'd into a field of war and blood and no man could think himself safe from his neighbour
he that is strongest or could make his party the strongest for a time could not promise himself that he should long continue so and not be undermined by the wiles of the weaker or by the treacheries or revolts of his own men
and they who are weakest must be sure whilst they are so to endure the insolencies and lye at the mercy of the stronger
no man could call either his goods or his life his own seeing there could be nothing to hinder any one that had strength and malice enough from invading them or endeavouring to advance himself upon the ruins of any one whom he found standing in his way to what he covets

all men may plainly see that religion were it generally practised throughout the world would soon make it happy and that the good order that is in the world is wholly owing to the sense men have of a god and that therefore there is so little good order in the world at this day because there is so little sincere religion or true sense of god in it
and if there were no sense of god in

it there would be no good order at all
tho it were true then that there is no god dare say the whole world would soon begin to wish it false yea and rather than all men should think there is none the atheist himself would wish it false too
all men would quickly find reason enough to curse the man that first discovered so mischievous a truth
but now seeing no man can possibly be assured that it is true what a fool is he that persuades himself it is to no other end but that he may be more free to do mischief and by doing so teach others to do the like thus putting himself and the rest of mankind into a posture of war and into the most deplorable condition imaginable mean into that of enjoying no quiet or safety in this world no comfort or satisfaction in going out of it and the danger of suffering more intolerable evils than any one can now conceive whenever death shall call him hence

iii
the third argument to prove him a fool who is confident there is no god is this he is confident where all the reason in the world is against his confidence
and to make this good lay this down as a certain principle it is a sufficient reason to believe that a thing is when it's being is discovered unto us all those ways whereby we can conceive

that such a thing can be discovered unto us if indeed it be and may be known
if then god hath made himself known unto us all those ways whereby we can conceive he can be made known if he be we have all the reason in the world to believe him to be and so all the reason in the world is against his confidence that denies god to be
he is a fool that desires or calls for more than this for that is all one as if he should say will not believe that there is a god till he be made known to me more ways than can be made known to me though there be one

now let any one say what evidence he would have to convince him that there is a god and will shew him that he hath it unless he would have such evidence as cannot be given tho there be a god
all things cannot be discover'd by every kind of evidence tho they really are and may be known
a voice or sound cannot be known by seeing yet we are sure it is because we hear it
a colour cannot be known by hearing but we are sure it is because we see it
sweet and bitter cannot be known by seeing or hearing yet we know them by tasting
he's a fool then that will not believe any of these to be unless he have such an evidence of it as cannot be given whilst

he hath that which can or who will not believe there is a colour because he cannot hear or smell it whilst he sees it or thinks there is no voice because he cannot see touch or tast it tho he hears it and so of the rest

what evidence then would a man have to assure him that there is a god god is by nature a spirit joh

and so invisible tim


whom no man hath seen nor can see vid tim


ioh

ioh

he's a fool then that will not believe that there is a god unless he see him and as much a fool is he that will not believe him to be unless he can hear him speak or feel him for god being a pure spirit without a body or bodily qualities hath neither a voice such as bodily things have whereby he may be heard with our ears nor other quality whereby he may be felt with our hands any more than he hath colour or shape to be seen with our eyes

we must if we will be reasonable be satisfied with such evidences of an invisible spirit as an invisible spirit can give us of its self and such evidences of himself god hath given unto us and by all such ways as we can think on has revealed himself unto us as one of infinite power wisdom and goodness our maker preserver and governor

and how can we conceive that he who is in himself invisible should make this manifest unto us but by some or all of these ways

by some such audible and visible significations and tokens of his being and will as we are capable of understanding
ii
by imprinting a sense of himself in our minds making us not only capable of perceiving but inclined to acknowledg him
iii
by doing such works as are the visible effects of such a being power wisdom and goodness

if there be a god some of these ways he may and otherwise we cannot conceive how he should be known unto men
and therefore if he have all these ways manifested himself unto us he is a fool that doth not own him


it must be granted very reasonable to expect that if there be a god who is our lord and governor he should give us such significations and tokens of his being and will as we may know him and how to behave our selves towards him
and

if it be such an evidence of him that the atheist would have for his satisfaction say he hath it in that which we call god's word in the holy scripture

if he say he would believe there is a god because of his word if he were sure that it is god's word ask what he means by saying so is it this that he would believe there is a god because of his word were he first sure that there is a god whose word it may be this is all one as to say that what he calls for as an evidence of a god can be no evidence for he cannot be persuaded tis his word till he be first sure that he is this is to play the fool downright he will not believe there is a god till god hath revealed himself by his word god reveals himself by his word and he will not believe it to be his word because he is not sure there is a god
if he say he means no more but this that what you shew him for the word of god is not such as may be thought worthy of god or has not enough in it to convince one that it is not a forgery of man if this be his meaning then ask him what is wanting to it to make it appear worthy of god and not to be a forgery of man if he cannot shew this and yet excepts against it he's a fool for either that evidence wherein

no defect can be discover'd must be a sufficient evidence or there can be no such thing as a sufficient evidence in the world

well then we say god hath revealed himself and his will by clear significations of both in his word
and this word we have now written in a book which we call the bible and the scripture
if this scripture or writing be true then is it the word of god for so much it affirmeth of it self
the truth of it therefore is the only thing we are to inquire into
and to make this enquiry as short as may be let it be considered that this book is made up of divers smaller books whereof some are called the books of the old testament others of them the books of the new one and we need do no more but inquire into the truth of the latter of these at present for if what is written in these be true then is that so too which is written in the former for these bear witness to the truth of those
our saviour in the new testament approves of the law of moses and of the prophets and of the psalms which make up the old testament luke

and of the same st paul saith all scripture is given by inspiration of god tim


and st peter that the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy

ghost pet


and the apostle to the hebrews saith that god who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son heb

if then the writings of the new testament be true the books of the old testament contain the word of god
and to satisfie our selves that they are true we need but to understand three things


that there were such men as are said to have written these books and that these are their writings

that they were sufficiently qualified for writing these books

that what they have written hath all the characters of divine truth


there were once such men as are said to have written these books and these books were written by them
if any one doubts whether there were once such men as st matthew mark luke iohn paul peter iames and iude or that the books which bear their names were written by them how would he have it proved these men died about sixteen hundred years ago and therefore he will not surely be so unreasonable as to say shew me the men or will not believe that

ever they were
but look what reason he hath to believe any thing that was before he was was born and now he seeth not the same he hath to believe that these men once were and that they wrote these books
histories make express mention of them one generation to another from their time to this hath preserved their memory and the books we have are their lasting monuments
we have the testimony of all christians of all ages since their time who have own'd these books as theirs who have commented on them and written in defence of the doctrine contained in them recorded their travels and the churches which they planted and these witnesses are no inconsiderable persons but the most learned of their times and such as made the most diligent search into the truth and were so well satisfied as to shed their blood in vindication of it and ventured their salvation upon it
neither is this all but we have the testimony of their enemies of those who persecuted them unto death and wrote against the truth which they deliver'd
now what can any one desire more than this to satisfy him that there were such men and that they wrote these books we have the books in our hands and all sorts of historians friends and enemies making mention of them and all christian

churches being the best most learned and most civilized part of the world acknowledging receiving and even unto death maintaining them
have we not the faith to believe that there were once such men as cyrus darius alexander or iulius caesar do not we believe that cicero demosthenes homer and virgil once were and that we have their books believe we not that we have had kings of this realm in former days and that we have now laws which they enacted nor yet that we had grandfathers and and inheritances derived from them and what better reasons can we have to believe any of these things than such as we have to believe that these men were and wrote these books truly he that will not believe that once a thing was when all the evidence of its having been is given him which can be given of any thing past must needs be a very unreasonable fool and not to be discours'd withal but laugh'd at
for at this rate nothing that ever was and is not now can be believed without better evidence of it than can be given if it was which is impossible


these men were sufficiently qualified for writing these books
for all that can be thought necessary to qualify them for writing

these books is first sufficient knowledg of the things whereof they wrote and secondly honesty to write no other things than what they certainly knew


we cannot in any reason suspect them to have wanted sufficient knowledg because they had all opportunities of well informing themselves
they write either of the life and deeds of jesus christ whereof they were or of his doctrine and preaching which they were of or else of the deeds and sufferings of themselves and their fellows whereof they were either actors and sufferers or spectators
that which they had seen and heard declared they unto us and that in writing as st iohn saith
ioh
they have delivered these things to us which from the beginning were and ministers of the word
and it seem'd good unto them having had perfect understanding of all things from the beginning to write unto others that they also might know the certainty of these things as we gather from st luke chap
now that there was such a person as jesus christ that he was born in the reign of augustus caesar and was crucified in the regn of tiberius caesar being sentenced to death by pontius pilate

and that he had such disciples and followers not only the testimony of christians but that of iews and heathens bitter enemies to christianity assures us
and what should hinder these men to have sufficient knowledg of what they write


we have no less reason to believe they were honest men who had no design to deceive the world
for first it is to be seen in their writings by all who read them that they professed and taught sincerity truth simplicity plain and upright dealing condemning all hypocrisie lying and guile as odious to god and damnable in men denouncing the heavy wrath and indignation of god against the practicers of these vices
and as they taught so they lived and for this they durst appeal to all who knew them
ye are witnesses saith st paul and god also how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved our selves among you thess
ii

we have renounced saith he again the hidden things of dishonestry not walking in craftiness not handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending our selves to every man's conscience in the sight of god cor iv

secondly for the truth of the chief matters of fact which they relate they were bold to appeal to the knowledg of great multitudes then living who might easily have disproved them had they told any falshood
they told them of the wonderful birth and life of jesus mentioning the very time of his birth the place the manner his manifestation to the shepherds to the of the east his persecution by herod with all the remarkable circumstances thereto belonging his doctrine and preaching his miracles some whereof thousands at once tasted of his death without ierusalem notorious to all his resurrection witnessed by his appearing to hundreds his visible ascension into heaven his sending the holy ghost on the day of pentecost to the astonishment of many who heard the apostles by him enabled to speak to every one in his own language and many more things of this kind concerning some of which st paul was not afraid to tell festus the governour in the presence of king agrippa the king knoweth of these things before whom also speak freely for am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this thing was not done in a corner acts xxvi
how easie now had it been for the iews to have proved these men lyars had they been so and

would they not have done it if they could

thirdly they were men but of a very mean education most of them and of no lening and cannot reasonably be thought able to contrive and invent what they write of their own heads and when they had done to defend it so bravely as they did for real truth
it must needs be supposed they were instructed well in their business and had a teacher wiser and more powerful too than themselves or indeed as it will appear than all the world besides
and this was well known to be jesus christ the eternal wisdom of god and his holy spirit of truth which he according to his promise sent upon them acts ii to guide them into all truth joh xvi
twas he alone who could as he had promised give them a mouth and wisdom which all their adversaries were not able to gainsay or resist luke xxi
indeed it appears whatever their education had been they were when they preached to the world and wrote men of good sense and understanding who could teach a religion which now for above sixteen hundred years hath prevail'd over the most learned part of mankind who could dispute with the learned grecians acts ix
and though the scribes and pharisees

the most learned iews though they of the synagogue of the libertines and cyrenians and alexandrians of cicilia and asia disputed with them acts vi
tho the philosophers of the gentiles the stoicks and epicureans encounter'd them acts xvii
yet were none of these able to resist the wisdom and the spirit whereby they spake acts vi

fourthly supposing them men of wit enough for such a contrivance yet can they not at the same time be thought such fools too as to contrive such things without any rational motive or inducement to it surely they must have some great things to propound unto themselves as the end for which they did this
they well foresaw that what they did would expose them to all the evils of this world
and therefore when they first undertook it they voluntarily left all they had in this world to follow christ
they were taught by him to deny themselves and to take up the cross matth
xvi
and told that they must be sent as sheep in the midst of wolves be deliver'd up to councils and scourg'd in the synagogues and hated of all men for his name's sake matth

that in this world they should have tribulation john xvi
and be persecuted joh xv
put out of the synagogues and

killed joh xvi
all this they knew and expected
they went forth to preach a doctrine which by the of the world would be accounted foolishness cor
and look'd on themselves as men set forth of god as it were appointed to death and made a spectacle to the world cor iv
they hungred and thirsted were naked and had no certain
being reviled they blessed being persecuted they suffer'd it being defamed they intreated they were made the filth of the world and the of all things cor iv
cor iv
they constantly and stoutly indured all that befell them rejoycing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of iesus acts
certain then it is that as they prosessed their exhortation was not of deceit nor of uncleanness nor in guile neither did they at any time use flattering words nor a cloak of covetousness as they call'd god to witness neither of men sought they glory thess
ii
no tis plain they could not propound to themselves any worldly advantage
well then either they did believe what they preach'd and wrote to be true or they did not
if not then did they for the sake of a known and unprofitable lye forsake all that seems good in this world even whilst they hoped for nothing in another

and then they must be no longer thought cunning and crafty men but the sillest fools that ever were and very
if they did believe themselves and chearfully endured all these things for persuading others to believe what more can we desire to shew us that they were honest and men

fifthly if it be said that tho they were men of good sense and competent understanding yet as honest men are easily deceiv'd so might they be by his cunning whom they follow'd and being seduced by him might in simplicity of mind endeavour to deceive others
this will appear a vain conceit when tis consider'd that he whom they follow'd was jesus a person well known whilst on earth for his life and conversation among men
he taught openly and what he taught notwithstanding his divine authority to command belief upon his bare word he did not bid them simply believe but try and examine
the iews to whom he preach'd had all along received the scriptures of the old testament as the word of god and for what he taught of himself he appeals to those scriptures
search the scriptures saith he for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me john
and this is not all

but he appeals for the truth of his doctrine to the works which he wrought before their eyes
the works saith he which my father hath given me to finish the same works that do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me john
if do not the works of my father believe me not but if do though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and in him john
he was then a man approved of god among them by miracles and wonders and signs which god did by him in the midst of them as they themselves also knew acts ii

and after all he himself suffered death for the confirmation of his doctrine and therefore could have no worldly end in deceiving his disciples
but what greater evidence could they or the world desire that he did not deceive them than this that as he taught them to understand his doctrine so he gave them power to do the same kind of works as he had done for the confirmation of it according to his promise iohn xiv
he that believeth in me the works that do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because go to my father
they saw then what he did and they felt in themselves what he had enabled them to do in his name
yea many others saw and felt in themselves the power

and vertue of those works which they did
these works were done in the streets and in the temple and in the synagogues at their solemn feasts and in their most full assemblies
so that the people hearing christ were astonish'd saying whence hath this man these things and what wisdom is this which is given unto him that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands mark vi
and the priests and rulers of the iews when they heard peter and iohn and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with iesus
and seeing a miracle done by them they confessed it saying that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in ierusalem and we cannot deny it acts iv

lastly seeing tis said these men might be deceived by jesus and so deceive others let it be farther consider'd what hopes either he or they could have that such a delusion should prevail
had they such hope or had they not if not would they suffer as they did and as they knew they must merely to promote and carry on a delusion which they had no hope would ever succeed will any one lose all he has endure all pains and miseries and a cruel death too only to

have the satisfaction of attempting what he thinks it in vain to attempt had they such hope and whence had they it could they hope that the mighty princes and the great scholars and of the world could be deluded by them could they hope that all or many would give so much credit to a few mean and unlearned men as for their sakes to change their opinions which they had suck'd in with their mother's milk wherein their ancestors had lived and died yea and cast away their gods too whom they had so long worship'd and by whom they thought themselves protected and made prosperous they could never dream of such a thing and tis plain that they built not their hope on their own credit or reputation if they had done so they would have set themselves out to the eye of the world in their best colours they would have carefully conceal'd and hid their own infirmities and every thing which might lessen their reputation among men
but they were very free in laying open to publick view their own blemishes and failings their ignorances and their sins
and certainly this is not the custome of deceivers or of men that would be believed on the stock of their own reputation
it is therefore plain that the hope they had of having their doctrine received

was wholly founded on the excellence of the doctrine it self and on the power of him from whom they had it
they doubted not therefore to leave it to shift for it self and to be tried by its own apparent goodness
they fear'd not but he who sent them to preach it would own it and give it acceptance where it pleased him it should be embraced and finally recompence them abundantly for all their sufferings

these things all consider'd no man can have reason to doubt of their honesty
and they being found both knowing and honest they wanted nothing to qualify them for writing these things
and therefore we can have no cause to distrust them telling us that they wrote the word of god
and now if after all this we find that these mens writings are such as have all the characters of divine truth what more can we desire


the matters revealed in them are truly worthy of god to reveal and necessary for man to know

the manner of their revelation is such that the hand of god doth visibly appear in it


the success which the doctrine of these writings hath had is such as none but god could give it

in sum they are such things as if there be a god we would judge it most fit for him to make known and such as are made known in such a manner as we would think it most proper for him to reveal them in and such as have had such success as we would think it well becoming him to give them

the matters contained in the holy scriptures are such things as are truly worthy of god if there be one to reveal and necessary for us men to know


the history of the creation of the world and of all things in it and of man especially of god's universal providence and government and of his special providence over those that serve him of his iudgments executed on the wicked and his special mercies to and deliverances wrought for the righteous this is certainly apt to beget in us the most high thoughts and esteem of god the greatest reverence and most humble adoration of the divine majesty the most free submission and chearful resignation to him and an entire dependance on

him as our maker owner preserver and governor on whose goodness and favour depends our life and happiness and whose displeasure and wrath must needs be our destruction
and can we think it unbecoming god to acquaint us with this or needless for us to know it


to have a true information of the special goodness of god to us men even from first to last of his making man at first in his own image with an immortal soul and a beautiful body and his providing all things needful for the good and welfare of both and his giving him the dominion over and the free use of most other creatures
how man fell from this good and honourable state into all manner of misery by disobeying god
how the world the good work of god became both so wicked and so full of troubles and sorrows
what wise and gracious methods god has used to preserve in all ages and in the midst of a world of wickedness an holy generation of people for himself and what wonderful means he hath of his infinite goodness through jesus christ provided for us whereby notwithstanding our natural corruption and guilt we may yet again be restored to his favour and our blessedness


to afford us such a sight of god's nature and attributes as we are capable of in this life his majesty immensity power wisdom and goodness and all things necessary to be understood of him in order to our duty towards him and happiness in him
to open unto us those unfathomable mysteries of the incomprehensible trinity in unity one undivided god in the three distinct persons of father son and holy ghost of the wonderful incarnation of the eternal son of god for the redemption of sinners of his passion resurrection ascension intercession and coming again to iudgment
of the miraculous sending of the holy ghost his inspiring of the apostles with gifts and graces befitting their office
these and the like are such things as men could never attain to the knowledge of but by divine revelation


to give us laws whereby we are to govern our selves and such laws as our own reason being made judge are most holy and iust and good all visibly tending to advance among us the honour and glory of god who gave them and promote the happiness of men to whom they are given binding us to nothing but to pay unto god such a homage and duty as we must confess we naturally

owe him and are by our nature fitted to pay him to do our selves and others all the good we can and no hurt at all and to do every one of us what lies in to make this world whilst we live in it a pleasant peaceable and comfortable place of habitation to us


to certifie us what shall become of us when by death we shall go out of this world what rewards there are for the good and what punishments for the wicked to shew us the twofold eternal future state of happiness and misery and that our present life is our time of trial and of discipline and as we behave our selves doth certainly bring us to one of these two
to assure us that our souls do never dye and that our bodies after corruption shall be rais'd again incorruptible and that we must in soul and body be brought to iudgment and by the laws under which we have lived be either finally condemned or acquitted

let any one say what things he can suppose if there be a god more worthy of him to reveal or more needful for us to know than such as these
could we be better instructed in the knowledge of either god or our selves could we be better directed how to honour god or to do good to our selves could we have had any greater

encouragements to goodness or any greater discouragements to live wickedly could we desire a fairer or more satisfactory account of things not otherwise knowable and yet fit to be known by us had we not been at an utter loss and in a lamentable confusion about these things had they not been thus revealed to us have any of the wisest men in the world been able to give us any rational account or but indifferent satisfaction about the original of the world or of us men or of what shall be after death what we may either fear or hope for in what a confounded state had we been and what very beasts must we have lived and died without some knowledge of these things and who could ever have made us know these things but god and can we then any longer think that these things are not most worthy of god to make known unto men


the manner of revelation is such that the hand of god doth visibly appear in it
god hath spoken unto us in his word in in as visible and audible and every way convincing a manner as we can conceive how if there be a god he should do
god as was said is in his nature invisible nor hath he a voice as bodies have to be heard by yet hath he been seen and heard speaking unto men so as an invisible and incorporal

being or spirit can be seen or heard and so as men may know it's he that speaks unto them
for his word was delivered


with many visible and audible significations and tokens of his presence

with prophecy foretelling things within the compass of his knowledge only
with miracles which are the proper works of divine power


the atheist would for his satisfaction see and hear god speak
if it will satisfie him that god hath been seen and heard speaking he hath been seen and heard both so as any one can conceive that he could be seen and heard that is in visible and audible significations and tokens of his divine presence
thus did god call upon and talk with adam and eve in the garden of eden both before and after they had sinned gen ii iii

thus he appeared and spake unto abraham as gen xv xvii xviii

thus did he appear and speak unto moses in a flame of fire in a bush exod
iii

and so he did to the israelites from the mount in fire and smoke the noise of a trumpet with thundrings and lightnings exod
xix
need not say how often and how many ways

god hath so manifested himself speaking unto men

but it may be the atheist will say if he himself could see or hear god speaking he would believe it to be his word which he heard
and truly if he be of this mind that he will believe nothing but what he himself sees and hears he is too great a fool to be reasoned into any thing and therefore not to be discours'd with at all
it has been already shew'd what reason we have to believe that these men speak truth who tell us all this of god
and if he will not believe upon the best evidence that can be given of a thing tho it was he cannot believe at all
however suppose he should himself see or hear what abraham and moses heard and saw or suppose he should see the church fill'd as the tabernacle and temple of old with a cloud or smoke or hear a voice from the altar as that from between the cherubims over the or suppose he should hear and see such a voice and glory as those at the baptism of christ luke iii

or at the conversion of st paul acts ix
or at the transfiguration of our blessed saviour on the mount· matt


or suppose he should hear god calling upon him as he did upon samuel by his name sam

would he not as that child did before eli

better instructed him think it the voice of some other or account of it but as a dream or a fancy if he say again he would be satisfied thus and otherwise he cannot then answer that it is not in the power of man to say any thing that may satisfie him and it is much to be fear'd that god will not give him any other satisfaction
for is it reasonable to expect that god should merely to humour every obstinate fool shew himself every day or as often as a wicked man pleaseth and just in such a manner as he would have him and for no other cause but because he is sullen and unreasonable and will not believe any thing that god hath formerly said or done to satisfie him why should god have such hard measure from him above all others will he not believe he hath his father's will and testament unless his father himself whenever he requires it come from the dead to tell him so and why must god who hath given him his will in writing sufficiently attested appear as he pleaseth to confirm it anew unto him


much of the word of god has been given unto us by way of prophecy foretelling things to come which are within the compass of his knowledge only and the prophecies in the scripture have been notoriously and undeniably fulfilled mean so many of

them as were to be fulfilled before the days wherein we now live and if these have been so fulfilled we can have no cause to doubt but all the rest will be so too when the time shall come
now things to come are acknowledg'd not to be within the compass of man's knowledge especially such as depend not necessarily on natural causes or are not wont to follow one another in the ordinary course and order of nature
we are all of us very sure that we know not what shall be on the morrow james iv
we cannot tell what a day no not what the next hour or minute may bring forth prov
xxvii

nay we know not certainly whether or no there shall be another day or who shall live to see it or in what condition it will find us
we are not only ignorant of such future things as are of least concernment to us which we have little desire to know or see no reason to enquire after but of the things which we most long to know and would account it a very great satisfaction to be assured of
we know not whether we shall be at ease or in pain sick or in health alive or dead the very next day or hour we know not whether we shall be rich or poor or have any meat to eat or be able to eat it if we have it so uncertain are all future things to us
yet we are sure there have been prophecies of things to come and

very true ones too men have foretold things many hundreds of years which came to pass in all circumstances of time place and manner as they had been foretold
some indeed have been bold enough to foretel things by human art and skill but have only befool'd thereby both themselves and all that trusted to them
if any of them have sometimes guess'd right twas either first by chance as he that guesseth a thousand times has ill luck if he guess not right once or twice tho he knows no more when he doth so than when he guesseth wrong
or he saves his credit by craft and cunning as most of the old oracles and our astrologers who utter their predictions in ambiguous expressions which are capable of a double sense and construction if things happen as you understood their words they have got credit without any reason for it and if things fall out otherwise than you understood them they can tell you you were mistaken in their meaning and they meant as it hath hapned
tis true also that when men will not hearken to the truth of god he may give them up to delusion and may suffer a deceiver to hit on a truth to make way for the belief of a lye as a very just punishment of an unreasonable infidelity
but they only whose knowledg of things future they

themselves confess'd to be of god and not acquired by human art and whose design it was to draw men off from idolatry and every evil thing to the worship and service of the true and living god have constantly and without failing foretold things truly and the event hath always verified their predictions
and who but god alone who governs and disposeth of all things according to his own eternal decree and council could make them so knowing in the holy scriptures we have many such prophecies as concerning the carrying of the iews captive into babylon by nebuchadnezzar their restoration to their own countrey by cyrus the succession of the four famous monarchies in daniel the coming of our lord jesus and his sufferings the final destruction of the temple and of the whole iewish nation and these things with many more there foretold have been undeniably fulfilled
and is not this a demonstration that these mens prophecies were god's own word let them bring forth their strong reasons saith god by his prophet and shew us what shall happen let them shew the former things what they be that we may consider them or declare us things for to come
shew us the things that are to come hereafter that we may know that ye are gods isa xli

tell ye and bring them near let them take counsel together
who hath told it from that time have not the lord and there is no god else besides me isa xlv
am god and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and will do all my pleasure isa xlvi


this word hath been deliver'd with miracles to confirm it which are the works of divine power only
we know that it is not in the power of man or of any thing else but of the great god of nature and lord of the world to alter any thing in the course of nature to do things which exceed the power of natural causes or to make things act quite contrary to their natures
when therefore we see such things done we must acknowledg a power above all natural power whereby they are done
yet is it as certain as history and observation can make it that such things have been done and by those very men from whom we have what we call the word of god

indeed all things in the world from the greatest to the least are truly wonderful to us as being far above not only our skill to imitate but also our reason throughly to understand yet we call not all things miracles

only such things as rarely happen and not according to the ordinary course of nature are accounted miracles
as when the fire refuseth to burn those that are cast into it when the water divides it self and stands up like two walls on each hand to let men pass through it on dry ground when the sun stands still in heaven and doubles the length of the day when men without any medicinal art or help by a touch or a word only either take away or restore sight hearing health and strength dispossess devils command winds and seas take life from the living and give life to the dead
these things above the power and contrary to the course of nature are miracles
and these with others many have been done
not indeed every day and ordinarily for then would they have been disregarded as common things and cease to be wonders
not secretly neither nor in some close corners only for then few could have witnessed and fewer would have believed them
neither yet were they done upon any slight or trivial occasion for then would they have been look'd on only as casualties and odd chances
but they were done rarely to encrease the wonder yet openly to gain belief and upon special and weighty occasions that the cause might be more noted
they who did them own'd

that it was god who extraordinarily enabled them and that not for their sakes but for his own glory and in confirmation of the truth of what he had sent them to teach
in a word all was to make god known unto men and to persuade men to seek their happiness in him
by such works did god bear witness to his own word
and every one but a fool will say blessed be the lord god of israel who only doth wondrous things psal

the success which the doctrine contain'd in the holy scripture hath had has been such as none but god alone could give it
if the men who wrote these books we speak of had not given great satisfaction to the world that they spake from god how came the doctrine which they taught to gain belief how came it so to take root and grow and spread as it hath undeniably done why have not its enemies the of this world after so much straining of their wits and using all their art and

policy to that end been yet able to convince men of its solly vanity or falshood why have not all the mighty powers on earth bending their whole force against it been able to suppress and stifle it whatever stratagems the devil or man could invent have been made use of to this purpose
iews and gentiles conspired together to crush it in the egg
the heathen raged and the people imagined a vain thing
the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers took counsel together against the lord and against his anointed saying let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us
as david prophesied of them psal
ii
the kings of the earth have persecuted this religion with fire and sword
the lusts of mens hearts rise up in open war against it continually
yet hath it taken root and flourish'd it has conquer'd and made the most wonderful change imaginable in mens hearts and lives
this success it has had not among a few simple ones easily deceived but among the most learned and understanding and judicious
and what can this be imputed to but to the light and power of divine truth indeed by its own light men may easily see all things in it which can be proper to commend it to all who think fit to be govern'd by reason as all but fools do

if it be said that idolatry is yet reigning over the greatest part of the world and the foolish religion of mahomet hath had very wonderful success and hath triumph'd over and quite extinguished christianity in many places so that the least part of the world is at this day christian and therefore the christian doctrine gains little credit by its success in the world
in answer to this we say these things

first whichsoever of these religions heathenism mahometism or christianity prevail most or be thought truest yet is it true still that all the world is of some religion and owns a god
and therefore this is noobjection against what we at first undertook to prove that there is a god only it may seem to weaken one of our arguments whereby we would prove this
but indeed it doth not weaken it at all

for secondly we are now only proving that our scripture is the word of god and this is but one of the many arguments we use to that end and the rest are convincive enough without it
so that should this argument fail us yet our whole argument whereby we would from our having the word of god prove that there is a god stands good
but nether doth our argument fail

us but proves what we would prove by it

for thirdly we say not that the christian doctrine is receiv'd by all men or by most men or by more than they who are of other religions
all we say is this it was in a very short time received in most parts of the then known world though for the sins of them who profess'd it god hath suffer'd it in many places to be rooted out again
nor doth this lessen its credit but rather confirms its truth
for this is the same which it self foretold and shews the care that god takes of it who as he will not suffer it to be quite lost so neither will he always afford it them who abuse it
thus was it foretold to the church of ephesus rev ii

will come unto thee quickly and remove thy candlestick out of its place except thou repent
and thus it happen'd to that and other churches
accordingly as our blessed jesus had told the iews matth
xxi
the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruit thereof
though therefore heathenism or mahometism fill more of the world than christianity yet hath the christian doctrine had the success which we speak of

fourthly though at this day it prevails not over most of the world yet it flourisheth

in the most civilized and learned parts of it
whereas idolatry and mahometism prevail only among the more rude illiterate barbarous and brutish sort of people

beside this fifthly it hath had the success we speak of by fair rational and indearing methods by gentle persuasions and convincing reasons by its own visible purity and goodness by the power of miracles without any use of force or violence but other religions prevail only upon the account of education and custom and an affectation of treading in the steps of forefathers or else by violence and compulsion fire and sword

again sixthly other religions are upheld by keeping men in ignorance and depriving them of the means of knowledge
and it is no wonder that the greatest part of the world is still in error when the light of truth is shut out from it
they can chuse no better who are suffer'd to know no better
but the christian religion seeks not for the advantage of mens blindness and being in the dark
twas sent to open mens eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god acts xxvi
it chargeth all it meets with to prove all things and hold fast that which is good thess

if it prevail among men tis by reason and light and knowledge
men chuse

other religions as do beauties by chance
and so the most deformed is all one with the most handsome
but christians chuse by sight and judgment

lastly other religions do favour and flatter men's corruptions and humor flesh and blood
but the christian religion proclaims open war against these crosseth mens corrupt inclinations contradicts their natural humors commands them to deny themselves and their own wills mortifies their darling lusts crucifies the flesh destroys selfishness commen is patience lays the cross in their way and injoins them to bear it in hope of things not yet seen and far off
that other religions prevail what wonder is it neither can it be any argument that they are of god
men can easily invent and are ready to embrace and will be very fond of and not easily change a religion that indulgeth their lusts
but that christianity commanding men to offer violence to themselves and to part freely with what they love best should be receiv'd by any considerable number of men is very wonderful indeed and shews it to be of god
the power of lust and corruption is enough to make men embrace other religions but the power of god only and of supernatural grace could prevail with men to accept of this

have now done with the first argument to prove it reasonable to believe that there is a god and have shewn that if the atheist would have god shew himself to be by some such visible and audible significations and tokens of his being as we are capable of perceiving him by he has all the reason that can be to believe that he hath done so
and have insisted the longer upon this point that in shewing the folly of the atheist might at once shew the folly of the antiscripturist and that he is as well a who denies the scripture to be the word of god as he that says there is no god

ii
if this kind of manifestation of himself which god hath given us in his word will not suffice how else would the atheist have him to manifest himself for his satisfaction will he be satisfied if it be shew'd him that god hath imprinted such a sense of his being in mens minds that they are not only capable of perceiving but generally inclined to acknowledge this truth am now to shew him that god hath done this and that mankind hath generally been very sensible that there is a god

indeed we have the testimony of and men to aure us of this and one would think this should be enough for when every

thing that hath reason bears witness of a thing he that yet disbelieves it must confess that he doth so against all the reason in the world and he that contradicts all reason must needs be a fool

as for the testimony of angels tis in vain to trouble the atheist with it for angels are invisible spirits and for the same reason that he denies there is a god he will also deny that there are any invisible spirits seeing these can no otherwise appear or manifest themselves unto men than we have already shew'd that god hath done
therefore it be as evident as it can be made that there are such spirits both good and bad and that they have frequently born witness of god yet seeing it is but the same kind of evidence with what we have spoken of already shall not at all insist upon it now but only on that which we have from the general consent of mankind

now this testimony of men for the being of a god is not to be slightly regarded it having all the advantage that humane testimony can have
it is not the testimony of some few men but of mankind generally
it is not the witness of all men in some one or two ages of the world or of some whole nations only but of all nations and of all and generations since there have been any

men whom we could hear of in the world

must it not be a very foolish thing in any man to make himself confident of a thing whereof first he can have no degree of assurance and secondly whereof the generality of men think themselves very sure there can hardly be a clearer evidence of one's being a fool than this that he takes himself to be wiser than all the world besides and that too in holding an opinion wherein he cannot pretend to any evidence at all to ground it upon
let us therefore here consider these things


there has not been at any time in any place any people discover'd upon the face of the whole earth that hath not own'd a god
the most barbarous wild and even brutish people without any kind of learning or common civility in their manners hardly distinguishable from the beasts of the field by any thing else but this have been found to have some sort of religious worship among them
though many of them have had no knowledge of the true and living god for want of instruction yet would they rather fall down and worship any thing either in heaven or upon earth yea the very devils themselvs than nothing at all
so deeply is this

truth that there is a god ingraven as it were in the very nature of mankind that nothing could ever yet eraze or wear it quite out
even that gross idolatry which reigns over so great a part of the world is enough to shame the atheist for thereby is it manifest that the world hath never counted any thing more absurd and foolish than to think that there is no god
men not knowing who is the true god were yet so fully convinced that there must be some god that they would worship any thing that they thought could do them either good or hurt rather than nothing at all

and as this was the belief of all in general so look by how much any nation was more civilized and cultivated by good literature much the more care there was taken about religion as among the egyptians greeks and romans
and such persons as had the best opportunities and greatest abilities for the search and discovery of truth were abundantly satisfied themselves and took pains to satisfy others in the reasonableness of this belief
and lastly they above others who with good reason were esteem the best of men mean such as endeavour'd to do the world most good who lived virtuously and justly and did what they could to make men the better and the happier for them were always

the most zealous and earnest promoters and maintainers of this belief
when therefore tis apparent that mankind generally and more the learnedst the wisest and the best of men have always believed this doth not the atheist shew himself a fool in contradicting all men having no better reason for his opinion than only his own imagination

if any shall object that it is upon record that there have been some atheists in the world and therefore tis not true that we have the universal consent of mankind
the answer to this objection is very easie

many of them who were call'd atheists were not so indeed but the most religious persons of their time
it was not because they denied that there is a god but because they denied those idols which the heathens worshipped to be gods indeed that those blinded idolaters called them atheists
and upon this account it was that the primitive christians of old were by those idolaters charg'd with atheism


suppose some few have denied that there is a god yet were they so few and inconsiderable in comparison of the rest who own'd a god that they ought not to be once named in opposition to a general consent

if say the generality of mankind have eyes and sight is it reasonable to say it is not true because an odd man here or there is born blind if say men are rational creatures will any think it a sufficient confutation of this that he can shew me now and then a natural fool with as little reason when say men generally own a god can any one object it is not true because he can name one or two odd men in so many millions that have been so blind and foolish as not to see and know what all others see and know


these few that have denied a god had not been taken so much notice of had they not been very few indeed and for their rarity it is that they were then wonder'd at and since are recorded in history
but as they were noted for the singularity of their opinion so were they hated for their wickedness branded as infamous and as enemies of mankind
the world was weary of them and as soon as any one began to be suspected to be of this opinion his citizens banish'd him out of their society as one unfit to live among mankind
which is an argument that it is so natural to men to own a god that he who do not so has ever been look'd on as a or mething that deserves not to be reckon'd among men


these very few how confident soever could never produce any considerable reasons for their opinion and to talk confidently without reason is but to rave like one in a high feaver and not worthy to be heeded
now the athiest hath so little to say for himself that he has not been able to make many believe that ever he believed himself in this point insomuch that it is at this day a great question disputed among learned men whether there can be such a thing as an atheist in iudgment
it can hardly be said in propriety of speech that a man believes what he can shew no reason for believing and therefore whilst the atheist can give no reason for what he saith saying there is no god we may say he doth not believe there is a god but it seems we cannot say he believes there is none
and the main reason of his unbelief for it is no more when well search'd into will be found no other but that very same upon which there are too many unbelievers now
the love of wickedness makes the thoughts of a god very uneasie to men and they are very unwilling to entertain a belief that will not suffer them to fulfil their lusts with peace of mind


lastly remember that as we have read and heard of some atheists so also have we read or heard this also of them that for

all the shifts they could make they could not so fully satisfie themselves as to quiet their own consciences
bluster indeed they would and make a noise in the as if they fear'd nothing business and company diverted them from talking much with themselves or entring upon serious thoughts but when night came and silence was made when they were alone and at leisure and had nothing to do but to think whenever their thoughts were fixt on this subject their fears also came along with them and they could not so easily as they desired get quit of that god whom they used so confidently to defie
indeed there are too many who take a too effectual course to prevent this trouble they are very careful to keep their heads day and night so full of the world and of their lusts and vanities that the thoughts of god can find no room and thus they constantly busie their minds till sleep arrests them
but take any thinking man that concerns himself at all about god and a future state who is willing sometimes to think what he is whence he came and whither he shall go when he dies and he shall never be able to satisfie himself so fully that there is no god but he will find himself sometimes afraid that there is and more especially when he thinks himself near dying or in

any great danger
the bloody emperor that would own no god but himself would when it thundred run under his bed to hide himself
and one that denied a god all his life long grew very sad upon his deathbed and being ask'd by them who heard his sighs if he believed there is a god and if it was that which made him sigh no saith he do not believe it only am thinking in what a sad condition shall presently be if there be one as know not but there is
and possibly we may have heard of one too well known of many of whom tis said that notwithstanding his many boasts and great confidence he durst never be alone in the dark or go to sleep without a candle lighted up by him

lay this together and then say if he be not a fool who contrary to the general sense and reason of mankind will needs be confident that there is no god is not he a fool who dares conclude that except himself and it may be two or three more just like himself whom the world of all others could best spare and whom it could heartily wish to be rid of all men in the world have been either knaves in making or fools in believing a lye


but this argument from the general sense of mankind is yet capable of a farther

improvement
for it is to be consider'd how and upon what account the whole world should in this one point come to be of the same belief

it is not an ordinary thing to find great multitudes of people all of one mind about matters of great and near concernment if they be not very obvious and plain either to sense or reason
men stand divided into contrary opinions about many things and especially about matters of religion and the several ways of religious worship and are as contrary to one another as light and darkness even in their choice of the gods whom they worship
how is it then that they all so unanimously consent in this first principle of religion that there is a god to be worshipped this is not a thing obvious to sense
it is not strange that all should agree that there is a sun in the heavens giving light to the world because they see it
but they see not god
how then are they all agreed in this too that there is a god unless this be as obvious to reason as the other is to sense and if it be so he that denies it must be a fool for denying what is obvious to the reason of mankind

can think of no more but two ways whereby men should be brought universally to consent in a thing of so weighty concernment

which is not obvious to their senses either first the being of a god is a thing so imprinted in nature that the reason of man cannot be awake and consider things but it must needs perceive it
or secondly men have been taught it at first and have successively taught it to one another from the beginning
and take which we will of these and it will be found a most reasonable thing to believe it

first if this be a truth imprinted in nature so that it cannot be worn out by time and become invisible but so soon as men arrive at the use of reason and make use of it as they ought they cannot but see it then whosoever saith that there is no god must needs be a fool
for he must needs be a fool who persuades or endeavours to persuade himself a thing is not which it is natural to him to discern and which he can no sooner open and use as he ought the eye of his soul to look after but he must needs see it
if then it be natural to men by the use of reason to discern the being of a god and if this be the reason why men generally notwithstanding all their other disagreements are agreed in this belief then is it both reasonable and natural for men to believe it and if any one believes it not it is

because he is not a perfect man but is defective in some faculty essential to mankind it must be either because he wants the use of reason or because he will not use it and whichsoever it be no man can deny him to be a fool for what is it else to be a fool but either to want the common use of reason or to make no good use of it

secondly if men have been at first taught this and so have taught it one another successively throughout all generations to this day and thus it hath been universally received as a truth by instruction and uninterrupted tradition throughout all ages and parts of the world this must also be accounted a very good reason to believe it true and that it could come originally from no other but god himself

yet here the atheist will needs imagine that he has gain'd a considerable advantage
some cunning men saith he for ends of their own which they would serve by it set abroach this opinion and most men seeing how useful it proved for the preservation of order and good government easily entertained it and rulers finding the advantage of it to themselves have done all they could to countenance it and have punished all that question'd it and thus tho

but a politick invention at first it hath prevail'd at length as a certain truth

now if we had no other reasons but mere tradition for the belief of a god confess what is here said might seem more plausible and yet when well consider'd not very credible
however it is no more but one of the fools on which he is content to venture his soul and all his happiness and think him no less a fool for that he imagines it may be thus but dare he say he knows it is thus indeed no but he is so afraid of all thoughts of a god that he is willing to have any thing thought true rather than that it should be thought that there is a god to whom he must give an account of himself
it is certain that the world generally has believed there is a god the atheist cannot deny that and we all know by experience that all men are not very apt in matters of so weighty concernment to be of one opinion where the thing is not very obvious to sense or reason
the atheist knows this too and yet rather than it shall be thought that it is so agreeable to reason that men cannot but generally consent in it without seeming enemies to reason the atheist will again set his fancy to imagine what else may be
and what has he now hit upon why it may be the whole

world has been always by somebody he knows not by whom into the belief of a god
it is an endless thing to answer dreams a ravings or a fool's fancies
however let it be considered


what is already said that the atheist cannot pretend to know what he saith to be true but saith only it may be so for ought he knows
and then for us to say it may not be so for ought he knows is answer enough to all he has said and to prove him a fool too for saying it for if it either may be or may not be so for ought he knows he's a fool for venturing his soul upon its being so
the world is now some hundreds above five thousand years old and no man in this long tract of time could ever yet discover this forgery here imagined no man could ever find out who it was that first set abroach this opinion or in what age or part of the world it first began or indeed where at any time it was not or that ever there was a time when it was not the universal opinion of mankind
it is as old as is the memory of man upon the earth for the very first man that has been heard of in the world was of this opinion
and whatever history gives us any account of men since the appearance of the

first man assures us withal that those men did own a god yea we find not only that it was ever the opinion of the parts of the world but also of those very parts of it which have had for many thousands of years as far as we can understand no manner of correspondence with the rest of mankind
so that if this opinion was propagated both to them and us by tradition then this tradition can hardly have any later date than that of the universal flood in the days of noah about four thousand years ago


think therefore if it be not much more likely that this belief was at first taught the world by god himself than by any such cunning man as the atheist dreams of
it began in the very first man that we have had any notice of it hath continued ever since through all generations of men that we have heard of in all parts of the world and is it not then most likely that it was taught the first man by god himself there is no difficulty in conceiving this and we have as good evidence as we can desire that it was so indeed
but we have no manner of evidence at all that it was an invention of some later man nor is it easily conceivable how it should be so
for


it is not easie to imagine how that man whoever the would have him to be should persuade all those who had always lived without any thoughts of a god so generally to believe him
he or a few more with him could not be of power enough to compel all men by force into this belief
force indeed may compel men to make a shew of believing what they believe not but to believe indeed what men can see no reason for believing no force in the world can compel men but that men should universally be compelled so much as to make a shew of believing what they believed not by the power of some one or a few men is a thing altogether incredible
if then as the atheist would have it any one or some few men did at first the world into this belief which it had not before and which considering the corruption of men we may be sure it had no mind to entertain he must needs do it by making the thing propounded to their belief appear to them very reasonable
for

first tho some silly and unconsidering people might easily be deceived by men of and subtilt yet we cannot suppose all men to have been so simple and inconsiderate
and tis well known that the most learned and wise have ever been of this belief

and therefore it must be reason that could persuade them to it

secondly tho the men of some one age had been so simple as to be imposed upon by a fallacy or deceit yet had no age after it the wit to find it out why could no witty atheist with all his stock of reason and learning which he is wont to brag on discover the fallacy and undeceive the world again certainly there have been in some ages of the world since this opinion first came in men of good sense and a competent understanding to know reason when they hear it why then has no atheist all this while by his better reasons convinced at least the more understanding part of mankind of this error which he supposeth them to have been led into thirdly men are generally so much in love with wickedness that first they must have been very weighty reasons that could persuade any considerable number to believe a god and secondly very weak reasons could they but find any at all may seem enough to persuade them there is no god

there is nothing in the world more unwelcome to a wicked man than any talk of a god
to be bid to believe that there is one by whose holy and strict laws he is to be ruled in all his thoughts words and deeds

one who is every where present with him observing his whole behaviour and keeping an exact register of all his sins one who will call him to an account and will punish him for all his wickedness this goes exceedingly against the hair tis this that fills his soul with fears and troubles his mind with sad thoughts and marrs his frothy mirth and spoils his sinful pleasures and afrights him from his wicked designs and will not let him quierly have his own will nor allow him to humour himself and make much of his flesh
this bridles his appetite restrains his lusts crosses his natural inclinations lays a bar in the way of his worldly interests cuts him short in his desired liberties and because of all this he would be glad in his heart that any one could assure him that there is no god
hence it appears that the atheist hath all the advantages on his side that he can desire to enable him to convince men of this error if it be one
by reason of their corruption men are very ready to hearken to him and desire nothing more than to hear him prove what he says yea they would reward him at any rate for his pains
it's a very easie thing to persuade men unto what they love and a weak argument is strong enough to make men believe what they would fain believe why then is the wicked man's

good friend the atheist so sparing of his reasons when he may so fairly hope to convince men by them the truth is by all this it plainly appears both that they are very strong reasons that prevail with men against their own corrupt inclinations to believe a god and that the atheist has no reason at all on his side seeing he is not able to convince men who fain would have it so that there is no god

fourthly what end had this imaginary man which the atheist talks of in putting this opinion of a god into mens heads it was saith he to make men more tame and to bring them under government and laws
and tis very true that men may easily be made sensible that without government and laws we should all be like so many wild beasts of prey tearing and devouring one another and that nothing can make men more governable than the belief of a god
but after all this what does that which the atheist saith amount to this we will readily grant him
that considering the general wickedness of mankind government and severe laws are very necessary things

that the belief of a god is that which above all other things will soonest bring men to submit to government


that if the belief of a god were an invention of man it were a very proper invention for the making men more governable

but now the thing which we would hear proved is that the belief of a god is but an invention of man for that end
government indeed will never be upheld in the world without this belief and therefore this belief is necessary to uphold government but will it now follow from hence that this belief is only a device of man to uphold government no certainly but this follows which the atheist has no mind to hear of that he who thinks there is no god is an enemy to government and ought not to have the protection of government nor to enjoy the privileges of a subject but ought to be banish'd from all societies of men as the greatest enemy to them in the world
and now seeing it is granted by the atheist that this belief is so necessary for the maintaining of civil government in the world will be bold hence to infer a conclusion quite contrary to his viz
that it is the more likely for that to be true and to come from god and not to be an invention of man
and the reasonableness of this inference will thus appear


government and laws are on purpose to tie men up to live by rule to restrain them within the bounds of iustice and sobriety to keep them from taking the liberty they would otherwise take and from having their own wills in every thing that they may have a longing mind unto
now that which could persuade men to be thus tied up and restrain'd must needs appear to them very reasonable in it self otherwise they would never be brought to thrust their necks into a yoke for the sake of something which they saw not good reason to believe
if the atheist say that though they saw no reason to believe that there is a god yet the benefit of good government and the desire of safety which they could not have without government was enough to make them content whether they believed it or no that it should pass for a truth
in saying this he confutes himself for if the desire of safety not to be had without government was it that persuaded them to admit this opinion of a god true or false and merely for the sake of government because without it they could not be safe then did their own safety sufficiently convince them of the necessity of government and was enough to persuade them to admit of it without the belief of a god
and so the atheist's

politician was only a politick and would seem wise in inventing a thing there was no need of for tis plain that the belief of a god was not necessary in order to government if the desire of safety was enough to persuade men to it
but this very pretence of the atheist that the opinion of a god was set on foot to uphold government is a confession that all other motives to subjection without this belief are insufficient and seeing this belief is the principal motive to admit of government men must needs see good reason for it for otherwise it could be no motive at all


if the belief of a god be the principal thing that holds men in subjection to civil government and within the bounds of iustice and sobriety then if it be not a true belief it must be granted that a lie is the very foundation of all vertue and goodness peace and order iustice and honesty fidelity and safety among men and it is for the great good of the whole world and so the duty of all men to believe a lie and that there is nothing so wicked because nothing can be so dangerous mischievous and pernicious to mankind as to believe the truth
it is a truth saith the atheist that there is no god
then is truth and the belief of it

the fountain of all evil and mischief disorder and confusion
tis a lie saith he again to say there is a god
then a lie and the belief of it is the fountain of all goodness and vertue and of all the happiness too in the world
can any one but a fool believe this and yet he must believe it that believes the atheist saying that the belief of a god is only an invention of man to keep the world in good order

this is enough to be said of our second argument to demonstrate the atheist folly taken from the general consent of mankind
and surely he can hardly be thought a himself who ventures to call that man wise whom the whole world as we have seen calls a fool

iii
come to the third argument grounded on the works of god and this may call the testimony of the whole creation of all things animate and inanimate
if there are such works as are the visible effects of an eternal being of infinite power wisdom and goodness there must needs be a god and he must be a fool that saith there is none
and here again we have a far more likely cause of the universal consent of mankind in this belief than that which the atheist imagined as possible only
by the effect the

cause is known
if we see things made we know they had a maker
men generally have seen such things in the world as they could not conceive to be the effects of any less power than gods and therefore they very rationally concluded that there is a god
and this is the argument which st paul hath taught us rom
that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shew'd it unto them
for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse
that is so much of god as may be known by the light of nature for with god is terrible majesty touching the almighty we cannot find him out job xxxvii

how little a portion is heard of him job xxvi
but so much as may be known of god without divine and supernatural revelation was manifest in or among the very heathen people for of them st paul there speaks
and how was it manifest in them thus god himself had shew'd it to them
and which way had he done so but by his works for though god is a being in his own nature invisible and his essential power and godhead cannot be seen in themselves yet are they and ever have been from the

creation of the world clearly seen in his works
how are they seen in his works by the eye of the soul or the understanding they are understood
and by what but by the things that are made all the visible creatures from the highest to the lowest are as so many books wherein all men have been able to read the eternal being and power of god
in short god hath left such legible characters of his infinite power and godhead imprinted on the world and all things therein and hath indued man with such a faculty of discerning them that whoso makes not this good use of his understanding to read and learn this from the creatures is without excuse and a wilfully blind fool
and this is it whatever the atheist is pleas'd to fancy to himself as fools are wont to be very fanciful that hath in all ages brought men universally to agree in this belief even as all men who see the clear day light are agreed that the sun is up although they see it not
and this will always be a sufficient proof of a god to every one that useth his reason to consider things and to him that doth not so there can be no rational proof of any thing

now the works of god are either the common works of creation and universal providence or the rarer works of special and

extraordinary providence and have ever been wont by both these to reason themselves into the belief of a god
we will at present consider but some few of them


observe the whole and entire frame and fabrick of the visible world
what less can we gather from it but that there is some infinite power and wisdom that contrived this vast building and set all things thus together in that beautiful curious and useful order wherein we behold them if one see but a house strongly and magnificently built wisely and usefully contrived gloriously and sumptuously adorn'd and furnish'd though he as yet see no man appear in it or about it will he be such a fool as to say it had no builder for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is god heb iii

if one see a watch or a clock and observe how artificially all the several parts of it are fashion'd and put together and farther how all the little wheels though divers of them have several motions of their own do all concur to one constant and regular motion of the hand or index though he neither saw it made nor know who made it will he be so foolish as to say it had no maker how much more a fool must he be who

daily beholds the admirable frame of heaven earth sea and air and all things therein and observes the glorious beauty and splendor the unexpressible variety the wonderful contrivance the vast compass and capacity the regular and constant courses motion and order of them all the ample provision made for every thing agreeable to its nature the mutual service and usefulness of one thing to another and innumerable other tokens of power wisdom and goodness visible and yet after all talks at this rate though know not which way these things should come to be as they are yet surely there needed neither power nor wisdom nor goodness to make contrive and order them thus
and though have a very fair and rational account given me in that which we call the scripture how they come to be thus yet will not believe it
it may be they were always thus of themselves or they happen'd to be thus by chance but surely they had no powerful maker or wise contriver
he that talk'd thus of a house or a watch you would think he were mad and shall not he that talks thus of the world and all things therein be a fool yet this is it and this is all that the atheist hath to say


let us come to some particulars and take but a slight view of some of those several sorts of things which we see and daily reap the

benefit of and see if we can find any one thing whereof any reasonable account can be given without the belief of a god

let us first lift up our eyes to the heavens above and observe how the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament sheweth his handy work psal xix
lift up your eyes on high and behold who hath created these things that bringeth out their host by number isa xl
even my hand have stretched out the heavens and all their host have commanded isa xlv
what a vast round do we there see encompassing this world of creatures of what a wonderful greatness are those bright globes of light which move within it the sun the moon and stars some whereof are certainly known to be many and many times bigger than this whole globe of earth and water whereon we live
how fitly are all those glorious and sparkling lights plac'd in the firmament for our advantage to afford us both light and warmth and nourishment here below how orderly and constantly do they move to shed abroad their influences the more equally upon all the earth and for the right proportioning of our seasons were they nearer us they would dazle and blind us instead of enlightning us scorch and burn up instead of warming and cherishing the earth
were they farther off the earth would be always

frozen and barren and we should die with hunger and cold
did they not move round the lower world their influences could not in any equal proportion be distributed to the several parts of the earth there would be no certain vicissitudes and orderly returns of night and day spring and summer autumn and winter
much of the world would be useless through too much cold and darkness or excess of heat
how regular even and constant are their motions always finish'd exactly in the same space of time and returning to the same points they have never in the least varied them for so many ages whether it be their yearly monthly or daily courses
nor is one year or one day in any year ever one minute either longer or shorter than another year or another day at the same time of another year
from such observations as these even the wise heathens such us cicero plutarch and the rest rationally concluded that there must needs be a god yea says cicero who would call him a man who when he sees the motions of heaven so certain the orders of the stars so setled and all things so connected among themselves should yet deny that there is reason in them or say this were done by chance when by no understanding we are able to conceive with how great wisdom these things are govern'd
yea what can be so plain and

clear saith he when we look up to heaven and view the celestial bodies as that there is some god of most excellent understanding whereby these things are ordered

let us now look down upon this great body of earth and water below and observe how it hangs like a little round ball in the midst of the thin air incompassing it round about notwithstanding its prodigious bulk and weight and all that huge load of things continually upon it
yet as the psalmist saith psal
lxxviii
god hath established it for ever
and psal
civ
he hath laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be moved for ever
see it incircled about with water as with a girdle the seas as it were continually roaring against it and threatning to overflow and swallow it up
and who but god can we think hath set a bound that they may not pass over that they turn not again to cover the earth psal
civ
he ruleth the raging of the sea when the waves thereof arise he stilleth them psal
lxxxix

he hath said hitherto shalt thou come but no farther and here shall thy proud waves be stay'd iob xxxviii

observe how both earth and water are stock'd and plentifully furnished with all sorts of things which are useful for the service of men
with stones metals and minerals of all sorts for building

fire and many other necessary uses with herbs and plants and fruits fishes fowls and cattel and all things needful for the labour and service of man for his food and rayment for his physick and delight and recreation and all in the greatest plenty and variety
how many thousand sorts of herbs shrubs trees and flowers find we on the earth how many learned volumes are filled with the vertues of them how admirably is every one of these form'd and contrived with roots whereby they are fasten'd in the earth and suck in proper nourishment from it with veins to convey that nourishment into all the many branches leaves and fruit with bark and rind to guard from the violence of both heat and cold with husks and shells to cherish the fruit and seed and leaves to defend the same unto perfect ripeness and with seed for a new propagation how doth the same kind of seed always produce the very same kind of plant and often with a most wonderful increase of its fruit especially in such of them as are most necessary as in corn for bread and fruits for food of all sorts how do the same kind of plants come up in the same season of the year of the same vertue of the same form and figure both in the branches leaves fruits and flowers what abundance of various

living creatures breed daily and feed in the earth and water and fly in the open air and how are they all fitted for their several elements fishes with fins to swim birds with wings to fly and other things with feet to walk how aptly are all things furnished with instruments of sense and motion nourishment generation and defence what one part about them or within them is superfluous or useless or could be well spared and how conveniently are they all set and placed and united together for their several uses the curious and wise contrivance of the meanest creature· the fine contexture of the little body of any small insect as of a fly or a spider hath been enough to exercise the greatest wits and to fill whole books with the wonders of them and yet one half of them is not discover'd
each animal great and small is indued with such powers and faculties as are necessary for its own sustenance and preservation whilst it lives and for the propagation of its kind after it hath a care of its and provides for them teaches them to shift for themselves and then leaves them to do so
every thing carefully shuns what's hurtful to it and picks and chuses what's proper for it
whence now comes all this from blind chance it may be some blind fool may think so but tis certain

he is a fool for thinking so
did stones and timber and all other materials ever jump by chance into a stately house did the in the printer boxes ever yet save both the writer and printer their labour and hit so together by chance as to make a learned book or a wise discourse could things in the world have been contrived wiselier or more fitly to all ends and purposes than they are and could things be wisely contrived without a wise contriver if chance which is indeed nothing at all could produce a thing once or twice which yet is impossible can any be so foolish as to think it could be the mother of constant order to say that all things are produced and preserved constantly in one regular course and order by chance is a contradiction that can fit the mouth of a fool only

observe we next how all things in the world do visibly serve and work together for some wise end and purpose and then consider what should guide and direct them all in working to that end tis easie for any one to see that most of the creatures are such as are exceeding useful and necessary and the world would be an inconvenient place without them and a very confused and dangerous place too if things in it did not act as they do
and tho it may be some few things we

may be able to name the necessity use and goodness whereof we cannot yet discern yet have we reason to impute this to our ignorance or it may be more to our negligence and sloth and inadvertency
it is certain there be many things which people are apt to think vain yea hurtful which yet industrious and learned men who study nature have found to be of special use and virtue
not a toad or a spider or any poisonous and venomous thing but the skilful know how to make good use of it and find that it could not well be wanting and we may well presume as much of other things the use whereof we are not yet acquainted with
they may serve to suck out and carry away some of those malignant humours and qualities which might infect the food we feed on or air we breathe in or to set off the worth the beauty and the usefulness of other things with the greater advantage that we may take the more notice of them and be more thankful for them or they may be if not immediately useful to us yet very needful to some or other of those many creatures which are immediately serviceable to us however they serve to exercise our industry and care and to let us see god's providence over us in keeping us from the hurt they might do us
but that which we should more especially observe

is that a very great many things which are without reason and understanding or so much as sense in themselves do yet work together for the good and preservation of one another and of the whole world in as good order as tho they had a rule to go by and understanding to be guided by it and sate in consultation how to do the best for the common good
so that what man doth in this kind by the help of reason they all do much more constantly and unerringly without it
the heavens very orderly and duly shed abroad their influence of light and heat to make the earth both fruitful and pleasant to direct sustain and cherish both man and beast upon it
in them hath god set a tabernacle for the sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race his going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof psal
xix
the earth yields its fruits of every sort in their due seasons and brings forth a proper sort of food for every thing that live upon it
he causeth the grass to grow for the cattle and herb for the service of man that he may bring forth food out of the earth and wine that maketh glad the heart of man and oil to make his face to shine and bread which strengthneth man's heart psal
civ


the waters contentedly keep their channels and bounds both that there may be a sufficient quantity of them together to make a fit habitation for all the living things which can live no where else and to leave dry land enough for other creatures to live upon
and because the creatures of the earth cannot subsist without a sufficiency of moisture therefore the waters go up by the mountains they go down by the valleys unto the place which god hath founded for them he sends the springs into the valleys which run among the hills they give drink to every beast of the field the wild asses quench their thirst psal
civ
and that all the earth may be refresh'd and have moisture enough to give juice to herbs and trees these waters not only send forth springs and rivers but abundance of vapours which in the air thicken into clouds and are dissolved again into seasonable showers scattered over the face of the earth
he bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds and the cloud is not rent under them job xxvi
he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth psalm cxxxv

he maketh small the drops of waters they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly job xxxvi

he makes the earth soft with showers his paths

drop fatness they drop upon the pastures of the wilderness psal
lxv
we cannot but observe several sorts of earth fitted for several sorts of plants and grain and several sorts of plants and grain suited to the natures and palates of several sorts of living creatures and several sorts of natures and palates in living creatures whereby it comes to pass that one sort delights in and is nourished with that which another sort takes no delight in and cannot be nourished with but perfectly hates and shuns as poisonous or hurtful to it
and hence it is that nothing is lost or is in vain but what one refuseth another chuseth and hence there is enough for all and there needs be no strife or contention about any thing for as there is enough for all so is there variety for each one
we see yet farther what provision is made in nature for the safety and defence of everything and how every thing naturally without teaching endeavours to preserve and defend it self one has horns another hoofs another has fangs or long teeth and none of these needs be taught how to use his natural weapons and such as have no such natural weapons have either reason to invent artificial ones as men or some other way of saving themselves as birds have wings to flye for it other things have swiftness of foot to run for it even

moles and worms have a wonderful faculty of speeding into the earth to hide themselves in the cedars the birds make their nests the firtrees are a house for the stork
the high hills are a refuge for the wild goats and the rocks for the conies psal
civ
young things no sooner fall from their dams but they seek for milk and find it without a guide
the little lamb runs to the pap immediately which the little infant cannot do
why the ewe wants wit to direct the lamb but the mother knows how to direct her child
birds chuse out the most secret places for their nests and make them with so much curiosity as man's art cannot imitate
the curious works of the little bee or is a very amazing thing to consider the industry and providence of the ant and the wonders that the spider works are matters of admiration to us
twould be endless to mention and indeed impossible for man to discover one half of the wonderful things in nature
and he that can yet imagine that all these things are by chance and that there is no superior power and wisdom that governs all things and directs them in their several operations must needs be more foolish than any beast

once again let us consider of what kind of ingredients this world and the things therein do consist or are compounded the

elements of it fire air earth and water are of contrary and mutually destructive natures their chief qualities are heat and cold moisture and dryness and what things can be more opposite to one another all things consist of these things and how come they to be be so evenly temper'd and blended in such a just proportion as to agree peaceably together in the same body again most things that we know in the world last but for a while plants trees beasts birds fishes and men after a short time dye and are no more but others of the same kind spring up and are brought forth to supply their room
and thus the world is in a continual change and is continued by a constant course of generation and corruption and one thing always ariseth from the corruption of another
the seed is sown and corrupts in the earth and loseth its form and thence springs up a manifold increase
now for any one to think with himself how this is brought to pass will be but for ever to bafflle and confound himself unless he have recourse to an infinite power and wisdom that orders all things
that which thou sowest is not quickned except it dye and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body which shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain
now what can follow hence but that

god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body cor xv
who but god could so evenly temper blend and balance contrary and natures into one so as the life and health strength and vigor of the body so compounded consists in the right temperament of these enemies who but god can raise one thing from the corruption of another make life spring out of death and constantly provide for a new generation of things from the ruines and rottenness of those that were before

lastly it is now time that we look a little upon and into our selves and see what cause we can find every one of himself to say unto god with the psalmist psal
cxxxix

will praise thee for am fearfully and wonderfully made marvellous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well

first should we only look upon our bodies which are no more but the corruptible cottages wherein our immortal souls are for a while to lodge tho we find they are made of flesh and blood and bones covered with skin as the bodies of some other creatures are yet very wonderful is the frame and contexture of these materials in them
how fitly is every part and member fashioned and placed

and connected to the rest to make it a proper instrument of life or sense strength or motion what one of those instruments of nourishment whereby our food is received chew'd swallow'd and digested the finest parts of it convey'd through the whole body for its necessary growth or repair and the grosser parts and dregs cast forth as useless what instrument of breathing what vein or artery for the carrying about of the blood and spirits what bone nerve sinew muscle ioint ligament or gristle for strength or action could we either well spare or wish better form'd or set for its use what one sense of seeing hearing tasting smelling and touching could we be content to want or how can we imagine that the instruments of any of these senses could have been wiselier framed and placed nay there is not a hair or nail about us but when considered is found to be of use for fence or beauty
whoso considers those two little seats and springs of life sense and motion the heart and the brain how wonderfully formd how strongly guarded how well supplied with a variety of instruments conveying to them and carrying from them as it is necessary for keeping themselves in right order and temper and for the life health strength and direction of the whole body whoso but well observes

the curious workmanship of the eye or ear the two intelligencers of the soul or thinks on the wonderful ways of seeing and hearing or he that considers the instruments of speech and the use as well as propriety of that excellent faculty to mankind cannot chuse but fall into the highest admiration of that infinite power wisdom and goodness to which he owes all these things

and yet what are all these to the wonders of our souls could we think it worth our while to come acquainted a little better with our selves and to this end sometimes to enter in as far as we can into the several mysteries within us and enquire after that soul or spirit which is served and waited on by all these bodily instruments and makes what use of them it thinks good we should be sure the more we know of our own souls the more also to know of god whose image they bear
some such thing every one of us feels within himself which is the life of his body and doth all by it whatsoever it doth
when the body lies dead it hath for a short time all its parts and instruments intire but they are altogether useless
it's life sense motion grace and beauty all is gone and nothing left but a cold heavy lump like to a frozen clod of clay
and why is it thus but that the soul is fled then what and how

admirable are the powers of that spirit in man which actuates his body directs and commands it and every member of it as it self pleaseth at whose will it moves or rests and by whose presence it liveth yea what is that without which we are no longer men tis the soul which sees and hears by these bodily instruments tis the soul that discerns and judges of all the numerous figures and colours magnitudes and proportions measures and distances motions sounds and voices harmonies and discords that distinguisheth between one thing and another chuseth and refuseth and orders all our doings
think well of it what is it within us that thinks and considers and reasons and discourseth about all things without words or noise what is it in us which whilst with these bodies we neither see nor hear nor taste nor smell nor feel can yet represent the several objects of all these senses to it self whenever it has a mind to it and hath as fresh and lively perceptions of them all in it self as if all these bodily senses were actually exercised by them what is the strange power of that within us which can make present to it self things long since past and things which are yet to come as well as those that now are yea and things which neither are nor ever have been as though they were what's that in us

which whilst we sit still is travelling over the world and taking a view of all times and can imagine thousands of worlds like unto this and frame new notions and lay plots within it self model governments martial armies and consider dispute and reason about such things as tho they were real what is that in us which is awake whilst our bodies are laid to sleep and sometimes runs over in our sleep all things that passed the day before discourses of them and contrives and designs for the future too alas we understand but a very little of our selves and far less than we might do if we would a little more study our selves we know not how we are nourished nor how we grow nor how we see and hear how we think or dream nor the strange operations of our imagination and fancy
but however we feel that there is something in us that doth such things we find that something in us doth remember and understand and dispute and consult and deliberate and resolve and forecast and chuse and refuse yea that often reflects upon our selves and accuses or excuses condemns or acquits us applauds or reproves us is vexed and grieved or pleased and delighted with our behaviour
we find that we are able in a numberless variety of vvords to make our thoughts known to others and by the same means to understand the thoughts

of others
we can mutually give and take advice and counsel teach comfort and reprove one another
we find something in us that can discern the use and benefit the hurt or danger of things about us and provide for or against them
and now when such things as these which every one may feel in himself are well thought on can we really remember what we our selves are and yet be such fools as to say or think there is no god if any man be doubtful whether there be a god or no he must needs be ignorant of himself
for certainly he that ever considers either his own nature or the many things which he every day sees must needs even naturally sometimes at least ask himself this question whence can imagine all these things to come what great power and vvisdom is it that doth in all things display it self let me consider it well


where all things visibly are in a most wise order there must needs be vvisdom and where all things do constantly continue in the same wise order of vvorking there must be power
and where such ample and excellent provision is made for the preservation of all things and for our welfare especially there must needs be goodness vvhere then is all this power and vvisdom and goodness lodg'd things are things act things are exceeding useful and good things have for some thousands

of years continued or succeeded one another in a constant order and usefulness one to another
have they then all this originally in and of themselves or is there some almighty most vvise and good being over them which at first made and put them into this order and still upholds them in it


where there appears nothing at all of understanding and reason it cannot be imagined what either power vvisdom or goodness there can be to make order and govern things and uphold them all in that regular and useful way of working wherein we see them
and tis undeniable that there are abundance of things which thus work very regularly and constantly wherein there doth not appear any thing at all of reason or understanding
only mankind of all the things that we are acquainted with hath reason
he therefore only can be thought capable of wisdom and vvisdom is absolutely necessary for the making and ordering of such a world of things
yet alas how far doth such a work as that exceed the wisdom of men and if it exceeds the wisdom of men how much more doth it exceed the power of all other things which want vvisdom for such a work there must be some vvisdom and power infinitely exceeding those of man or of any other thing that we are here acquainted

with
and therefore we must seek these in some superior being


either there must be something unmade and which made other things or some of these things which now are and are well known not to have always but to have had a beginning beg to be of themselves without a maker or were made by a maker which was also made and had a beginning
that nothing could begin to be of it self without a maker is very plain for before it began to be it was not and what was not could have no power and therefore could not begin to be of it self
whatever therefore had a beginning had it from another which could make it to be
and if that other had a beginning too the same may be said of it that it had it from another and so we must go on of necessity till we find something which had no beginning but was unmade and gave beginning to the first thing that ever begun to be
if then it was any of these visible things which was unmade and without in all reason we must think it to be that which appears the most noble and excellent which hath reason and wisdom and this as far as we can judge of things must be man for whose use and benefit all things visible seem to be made
if therefore man excelling all visible things in perfection of nature be not of himself without

beginning neither made any one thing in nature serving to his use how can we imagine this of any other visible thing it cannot be thought without the greatest folly imaginable that man was made by any of these visible things which are so much inferior to him in perfection of nature and which seem to be of no use at all if not made for him
but we men are very sure that we are so far from being able to make any of these things that with all our search and study we cannot understand the natures of them


and we are altogether as sure that we are not of our selves without beginning as we are that we made not one thing in nature
it is but a very little while since any of us now living came into this world and it will be but a very little while more before we must go out of it again
we knew not how we came hither when we came and we know as little how we shall go hence and we have but a little power over our selves whilst we stay here
there was a time not long since when we had not one of the powers and faculties which now we have and when we were nothing at all of that which we now perceive our selves to be
we are therefore as sure as that we are at all that we had both our being and all that is now in us from some other who must needs therefore be of far

greater power and wisdom than we are of
our parents were indeed the instruments of our being but it is as true that they were no more but instruments of it
for they and their parents before them and all parents that ever were could but say of themselves and their coming into the world the very same things that we now say of our selves
it was never in the power of any parents yet to make their children what they pleas'd no more than it is in the power of a pencil in the hand of a painter to chuse what kind of picture it shall make or indeed whether it shall make any picture at all
no parents could ever assure themselves that they should have children
neither knew they how they were form'd in the womb the fashioning and setting together of the parts and putting life into them being things infinitely exceeding their power and skill were therefore no part of their care
they knew not whether any thing should be conceived or being conceived should ever be brought forth or what it should be male or female perfect or imperfect· a man or a monster wise or foolish alive or dead no more than the husbandman that casts his corn into the furrows takes care how to form its roots or blade or knows how it grows or what it will prove at last
and now that we are and live we find our

selves in the power and at the desposal of another
we cannot bring to pass what we will we cannot accomplish our own designs and purposes as we would
we cannot preserve to our selves our present possessions
we cannot get what we would have nor rid our selves of what we would not have
we cannot make the sun to shine on us nor the wind to blow upon us nor the rain to fall where and when we would have it nor our corn and grass to grow nor our cattel to inceease nor our food when we have it to nourish us
we cannot keep our bodies from sickness lameness pains and decays or make that part of them straight which is crooked or beautiful which is deformed
we cannot keep out our fears nor quiet our thoughts nor prevent casualties nor prolong life nor keep away death and corruption
what then can we rationally think of our selves but that we are the work and in the power and under the government of one who is infinite in wisdom power and goodness who made preserves and disposeth of us and of all things as it pleaseth him
and who is that but god he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein isa xlii



it is certainly known how we men come into the world by generation successively one after another
one generation passeth away and another generation cometh but the earth abideth for ever eccl

is it now possible for any one to conceive that among all the generations of men that have been there was no first man or men at whom these generations of men first began if there was any first man as no man can conceive but there was had he a beginning or had he no beginning if he had a beginning whence had he it he could not give it himself as we have before seen
no other man could give it him for he was the first
did he then spring as a plant out of the earth too ridiculous a conceit to come into a rational man's head
how then should he have his beginning but from god will any say he had no beginning then he must say he was eternal and had eternally his being and all his powers in and of himself and if so how came he to die and be no more he who had eternally being and life in himself would he nay could he chuse not to be or to die and to leave behind him children of so little power and of so short a life and not so much as the least notice among them that they had such a father will any think it reasonable to say that there was no first man this only remains to be said by him who

would not have a god
but this is that which none but a fool can think reasonable men of sense and reason have ever accounted it most absurd to talk of an infinite succession of things one after another without beginning of a number of things wherein there is no first thing or which had no beginning
at this rate an infinite number of generations are long ago past and an infinite number is the greatest number if there can be such a thing
and yet there have been more generations since that infinite number of them was past and there may be more still and so there is something greater than infinite and a number greater than the greatest
no wise man did ever pretend to understand how such a thing could possibly be and so it must pass among the ravings of a doting fool
men who are wont to talk so as that they would be understood or can understand themselves will say that of that great number or those many generations of men which have been in the world there must necessarily have been some first man or men and that he or they that were first could never have been at all or had any power to propagate others without a maker
and the very same must we say of the whole world of things which are within our view
what use can we think the world serves for but for the use of those living

creatures which are in it and more especially of man for what use is a house but for that of the inhabitants and it were no less absurd to think that the heavens and the earth made men and other living creatures than it is to think that the house made the inhabitants that dwell in it
and then if the inhabitants know and confess that they made not the house as no body but a fool will think that the house made them so any but a fool will say some other made the house
as then every house is built by some man so he that built all things is god heb iii


thus all things both without us and within us do naturally lead us to the acknowledgment of a god if we will but make use of our reason and if we will not that's it which makes us fools
god hath not left himself without witness in that he doth good and giveth us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons filling our hearts with food and gladness acts xiv
and we may easily perceive if we will think of any thing that he is not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being for we are his as the heathen poets could tell us acts xvii
but if any one continue so foolish as not to confess this tis fit he should be sent to school to the beasts as iob xii ask the beasts

and they shall teach thee and the fowle of the air and they shall tell thee the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee who knoweth not all those that the hand of the lord hath wrought this in whose hand is the soul of every living thing and the breath of mankind


and yet besides the works of creation and of ordinary providence it cannot be denied but there are works of an extraordinary providence to be observed whereby god doth yet further discover himself unto us

tis certain that things do ordinarily keep one natural constant course and order and vary not from it
as god commanded and they were created so he hath established them for ever and ever he hath made a decree which shall not pass psal
cxlviii

they continue this day according to his ordinance psal
cxix
now as the constant orderly course of all things in nature shews that there is an infinite wisdom and power that put them into this order and fixed them in this course keeping and continuing them ordinarily in it so when sometimes and upon very remarkable occasions this ordinary course of nature is changed and things are done above the power and quite contrary to the course of nature and moreover when the wisest counsels and most hopeful endeavours and the most likely means such as rarely fail

and in all appearance and reason should succeed well are all on a sudden blasted and quite disappointed and not only so but produce the quite contrary to that for which they were design'd and all this by reason of some invisible power which no can discern or by such weak opposition as none could imagine likely to prevail what can we think less but that there is an providence of god who alway holds the rains in his own hands and doth whatsoever he will both in heaven and in earth

it is easie to observe that when wickedness is grown up to a very extraordinary heighth in a nation or kingdom though that nation abounds in policy and strength and in all things that seem to promise success and persuade to security yet all on a sudden when there seems least cause of fear by some extraordinary unlook'd for judgment it is brought to utter ruine and destruction
and on the other hand when a good and religious people are oppress'd by tyrants and assaulted by most potent enemies and hemm'd in on all sides with seemingly inevitable dangers so as they sink into despair and look for nothing but being swallow'd up of those who hate them all on a sudden when they could see no reason to hope for any such thing the threatning cloud flies over them and rains

down vengeance on their enemies and the sun shines forth on them brighter than ever
who can conclude less than that the hand of god is in all this now both histories and experience have furnished us with examples of such as these and he must be of a very obstinate humour that is not convinced by them
how easie especially is it to observe in the sacred history of the bible god's wonderful and extraordinary both iudgments and mercies both towards whole nations and also private persons and families enough there is of this kind to assure us that tis god that changeth the times and the seasons who removeth kings and setteth up kings dan

and now after all this hope it is abundantly manifest that the atheist being confident that there is no god makes himself confident in a matter wherein all the reason in the world is against him and against all the evidences that can be given of what he denies how true soever it be

it cannot therefore be thought needful any otherwise than thus to shew that he hath no reason at all for his confidence
for when all reason appears against one's opinion tis most certain there can be no reason for it
all that he can say for himself is but this that there appear to him some difficulties in the belief of a god which he cannot conquer
and doth he not meet with as many and as unconquerable difficulties in the denying of a god if he do not tis only because he hath no mind to see them for am sure all the wisest men have met with such
but if it be as the atheist pretends more difficult to believe that there is a god than to believe there is none or than barely not to believe there is how comes it to pass that the generality of mankind hath always believ'd it how is it that nothing seems more natural and easie to most men than to believe

it and nothing more hard and against nature than to conceive how it should be otherwise why hath no atheist by propounding and demonstrating these difficulties been able hitherto to dissuade any considerable number of men from believing this can the atheist give any rational account how this world could be as it is or how he himself came to be what he is if there be no god if he can why hath he not in so many ages of the world let men see that he can why have so few receiv'd any satisfaction from what he hath said to that purpose surely it must be because men find many more difficulties in believing that he speaks reason or in perceiving that he gives any reasonable account of things without a god than they in believing that there is a god
he hath sometimes one thing to say and sometimes another as his invention serves him
sometimes the world may have been eternally without any beginning and sometimes there may have been eternal matter which form'd it self he knows not how into that variety of things which we now see
sometimes there may have been eternally an infinite multitude of small atomes or motes dancing to and fro till at last they hit and jumble by chance into so many bodies as the world now contains
and with such like imaginations as these he

labours to confound men's thoughts and to divert them from listning to that rational and satisfactory account which the holy scripture hath given us of the original of all things
but as these atheistical wits have never been able to satisfie one another so as that they could come to agree in the same principles but have been at an irreconcileable difference and an endless dispute amongst themselves not so much about what certainly was as about what possibly might have been so neither have any of them been able to convince any considerable numbers of men no not of those who know nothing of the scripture to think that the world could have been any of those ways they dream of without a god
and why so but because men have ever thought it more difficult to be of any of their opinions than to believe that there is a god
if the atheist could but perswade men that he had reason on his side it would be very easie for him to draw them all over to his opinion for their lusts are all on his side already
but till lust have so totally prevail'd over men as quite to unman them and put out the eye of reason the atheist's folly is so visible that the eye of the natural man cannot but see it

it's very hard saith the atheist for a man to comprehend in his mind an infinite being such as god is said to be and

how should a man believe what he cannot comprehend by his understanding and indeed most true it is that what is eternal and infinite no humane understanding can fully and perfectly comprehend
to understand a thing fully and perfectly in all things belonging to it is to suppose it to have certain bounds or limits of essence and perfection which if it had it were not eternal and infinite
and true it is that god is a being of an unlimited and boundless nature and excellency and therefore cannot be fully or in all things understood by man
but this is so far from making it uneasy to believe that there is a god that we cannot when we consider things well but believe it
we therefore believe that there is a god because when we consider how many things there be in the world and how many and even unsearchable by us are the excellencies and perfections of every thing in its kind we cannot fee how these things could be without a being incomprehensible and infinitely excellent and perfect whence all being and perfection must be derived
tho therefore man who is of a finite and limited understanding cannot fully comprehend the eternity and infiniteness of god or throughly understand the infinite nature and perfection of god yet may he understand and believe that there is a being which is eternal

and infinite that is to say a god
and it is so easy to conceive that there is such a being that it is not possible to conceive how there should be none such
we are very sure that we our selves and other things have a being and yet we cannot fully comprehend or throughly understand the excellencies and perfections of our own nature or of the nature of any thing else how small and inconsiderable soever it be
it cannot therefore be hard for us to believe that there is something incomprehensible by us or which we cannot throughly in all things understand
and so easie is it for us to apprehend that there is some eternal being that we cannot conceive how there could be any thing at all without it
we cannot with any satisfaction to our selves suppose that once there was nothing at all
for were it so that once there had been nothing at all it must needs follow that there never could have been any thing at all if there once was nothing whence should any thing have come there was in nothing no power nor disposition to any thing nothing of which any thing should spring nothing to make or give a being to any thing nothing is nothing and nothing can do nothing but now there are many things
had they a beginning or had they none if they had no beginning we have found many eternal beings whilst

we think it hard to believe there should be one
if they had a beginning then as hath been said they had it of themselves or from some other
they had it not of themselves for before they began to be they were not and what is not can do nothing
they must have it therefore from some other and that other must be before them and must be eternal without beginning

the sum of all that hath been said is this the atheist being confident that there is no god is confident in a matter whereof he can have no reason to be confident and whereof he cannot pretend to have the least measure of assurance
he is confident without any reason or degree of assurance where his confidence is the most dangerous thing that can be to himself and the most mischievous thing that can be to the whole world
he chooseth to follow a groundless opinion wherein there is no safety to himself and whence there can arise no good but very much hurt to the world rather than a probable opinion at least which it is certainly safe for him to follow and which can do no hurt but much good to all mankind
in denying that there is a god he must grant that all the happiness of the world depends upon a lie and that the world would be undone by the knowledg

of the truth
he is confident where all the reason of the world is against his confidence
he is confident there is no god tho he have all the evidences of a god that can be given of him if there be one
god hath spoken unto men so as god can be supposed to speak unto them if be god hath appear'd and shew'd himself to men so as if there be a god any one can conceive that he should shew himself
the atheist finds the whole world of mankind consenting that there is a god and he finds the tokens of infinite power and wisdom and goodness in all the works of creation and providence both common and extraordinary he cannot give any rational account at all of any of these things without the belief of a god and finally he finds no such difficulties in believing there is a god but he finds many more and greater in conceiving how things should be as they are without a god
seeing as hath been shewn this is plainly the case let all men of common sense now judge whether he who makes himself confident that there is no god be not past all dispute a very fool

but now in vain have we all this while been considering the atheists folly if we our selves resolve to be as much or greater fools than he
and certainly if it be as it hath

been proved a very foolish thing to think that there is no god it cannot be less foolish to live without any regard of god as too many amongst us seem to do who behave themselves so in the world as if god had nothing to do with them or they with him or as tho it were all one to them whether there be a god or no
if there be a god and if none but fools deny this then are we to consider that these things do necessarily follow


every one that is wise doth take all possible care to confirm himself in so stedfast a belief of god that nothing may be able to make him doubt of it
take heed therefore brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god heb iii

the fear of the lord that is wisdom job xxviii

if there be a god it must needs be the greatest piece of wisdom that man is capable of to behave himself religiously towards god but this he can never do without firmly believing that there is a god this belief being the first and fundamental point in religion
he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him heb xi
therefore

in the first place let no one think himself excusable if he be not throughly convinced

that there is a god
for no man living that hath the right use of reason can be ignorant of this and be held guiltless
god hath so many ways manifested himself unto us that the blindest heathen cannot say that he hath not had means enough of knowing that he is
and if a heathen can have no excuse for his being ignorant of this who hath but at most one half of the means of knowledg which every the most unlearned christian hath how should any ignorant christian be excused tho it be therefore too common a thing to hear both men and women among us who both are of considerable age and also understanding and wise enough for the business of their worldly callings excusing their ignorance of god by their want of learning yet in truth they can have no excuse at all for this ignorance
it is their negligence and sloth and unwillingness to learn that keeps them ignorant and for these there can be no excuse
can any one live in a christian church and not have heard enough if he would have minded it tho he cannot read to convince him that there is a god whom he is bound to serve nay can any one live in the world and not see enough every where to teach him this first and fundamental truth he that cannot read god's word may yet if he live in a christian church hear it and

god himself speaking to him in it
and he that lives abroad in the world tho he cannot see god himself yet he may every where see his works and in them all the being the power the wisdom and the goodness of god
nay if he can but eat and drink he may know there is a god that feeds him for he knows very well that it is not in his own power nor of any other creature to provide his food for him or to enable him to receive good by his food
yet more no man how unlearned so ever he be can think seriously of himself and consider what he is or how he lives but he may easily discover a god that made him to be what he is and preserves him in being and life
how inexcusable then must every one be for not learning that which every thing teacheth him and which he cannot but learn when he doth but consider that he himself is something

in the next place let none of us think it a needless thing very often and seriously to consider that there is a god
if we do not much consider it it will be but a vain thing for us to know it
we should so lose the benefit of god's manifesting himself so fully and so variously to us
consideration must make our knowledg useful to us
if there be a god it is certain that we depend wholly

upon him and must needs owe a duty to him
yet tho we may know there is a god if we keep it not in mind and think but little of it our knowledg can have little influence on our life and behaviour but we shall demean our selves as carelesly and be every whit as secure and unconcern'd how we live as tho we had never heard or thought of any such thing as a god yea not to consider and have this much in our thoughts seems to be more inexcusable in us than not to know it at all
as he who knows his lord's will and doth it not deserves to be beaten with more stripes than he that doth not his will merely because he knows it not luke xii
so he that considereth not much that there is a god when he knows it seems more blameworthy than he who doth not know it and therefore cannot consider it
both are faulty and can have nothing at all to plead for themselves but he that knows and considers not seems to be more faulty and a great deal more may be pleaded against him
the one is ignorant of god when he might know him the other sets light by god when he knows him
the one not knowing god knows not how much he deserves his thoughts the other tho he knows him yet carries himself so towards him as if he thought him not worthy to be thought upon

he likes not to retain god in his knowledg as tis said of some rom

as then if there be a god tis altogether necessary that we should know and believe it that so we understand how much it concerns us not to live as we list having one over us to whom we must be accountable even for every idle word mat xii
so when we know this tis altogether as necessary we should much consider and think of it that we may walk worthy of god unto all pleasing col
and not wilfully or giddily run upon our own destruction by disregarding him
it will be a very terrible thing to the ignorant person at the last day to meet with a god of whom he never knew and then to reflect thus upon himself had been any thing but a fool might have known this god to my eternal comfort whom now find to my everlasting confusion and it will be more terrible at that day for the unconsidering person to find a god armed with vengeance against all that contemn'd him and then to reflect on his own folly saying what a was who knew there was a god and did not think him worth a few serious thoughts when by little serious consideration might have prevented this confounding sight and my own eternal destruction now come upon me through my heedlesness as we therefore desire that we may never

feel the wrath of god let us now entertain often and serious thoughts of him

to this purpose lastly let us be very constant in the use of all the means which god hath given us to confirm and establish us in this belief and lively sense of god and take heed as we love our souls how we give ear to any thing which may weaken this belief or make us doubt of the being of a god
we have all the reason in the world to be very careful of this because as we have seen if it be a truth that there is a god nothing can be more necessary either to prevent our misery or to promote our happiness than a firm belief of it and tho it were false as it cannot be yet would it do a great deal of good and no hurt at all
let us labour then to be well grounded and setled in this belief and to this end let us well weigh and consider all those many reasons which we have above taken notice of to perswade us to it
especially let us diligently attend to god's word and observe his works
the reason why many men either so weakly believe that there is a god or so little and slightly think of it is because either their lusts or their worldly business or else vanities hold their thoughts so continually imploy'd about them that they will not allow themselves time nor be at the pains to consider those notable

evidences which god hath given of himself
he that shuts his eyes and stops his ears when he should read or hear god speaking to him or when he should observe the wonderful works of creation and providence it is not strange if he never come to have a rational and firm belief of god
therefore if we would as it highly concerns us be unmovably rooted in this belief we must observe these rules


let us be sure to keep our reason and understanding which god has given us as we are men constantly awake
let the eye of the soul be kept open that it may be ready to see god whensoever and howsoever he shews himself
what's the most rational discourse to a sleeping man he neither hears it nor considers it and therefore is he no wiser for it
what's light and beauty to a man that always winks he sees them not and so knows no more of them than it they were not to be seen
this truth that there is a god is as visible to the understanding as colours are to the eye but neither are visible to one that is not awake
let us consider that the best things must certainly be the best worth our seeing and knowing and nothing can be better than god who is the fountain of all goodness
nothing is so carefully

to be regarded as that without the knowledg whereof we eternally perish and such is god
hath man understanding and reason for no use or is he to use them about every thing of least concernment and not about that which above all things in the world he is mostly concern'd to understand if there be a god we must all of us be either happy or miserable for ever accordingly as we regard and honour him or neglect and dishonour him and can there be any thing the knowledg whereof doth more concern us and yet is it thus with too many of us that whilst our understanding and reason are very intent upon other things and never grow weary of considering them and inquiring after them they are wholly asleep as to god and never imploy'd about him as if to think of him were not any part of our business
why should we be any longer such fools as to suffer the business and vanities of this world which passeth away and the lusts thereof or the pleasures of sin which are but for a moment so to bewitch us that we can never be awake to god seeing that about him we are most of all concern'd that our souls attain to the most rational and full satisfaction let our reason be busied about him above all things that so we may be able both to live and die like men


let us exercise our reason in considering those things especially which are most proper and apt to beget in us the most clear and lively sense of god
for as god hath appointed proper means and helps for the attaining to all those ends which he would have us to pursue so hath it pleased him to ordain certain means by the use whereof we may soonest and most perfectly come to the knowledg and belief of himself
such are his word and his works both of creation and providence· which are therefore to be very diligently studied and meditated upon
we must very frequently read and hear his word and when we read or hear it we must be very attentive to it and take heed how we do it in a regardless and formal manner or as a customary task only which we have set our selves to do as tho the reading or the hearing of it were our only or principal business
our work is to think and consider well of all that we read and hear that we may be perfectly inform'd and throughly convinced and heartily affected with the matters which are therein commended either to our belief or practice
in vain shall we either read or hear god's word if we do not labour to see and hear god himself speaking to us and discovering himself and his will unto us therein
to read in the bible so many chapters a

day or to hear so many sermons a week is an employment to as little purpose as the reading or hearing any common history if we make it not our end to come better acquainted with god and to be instructed in our duty of honouring and serving him
and thus is it also in our seeing and observing and making use of the many and wonderful works of god whilst we endeavour only to serve our selves of them and not to discern god in them we improve nothing in our knowledg of god by them
how many of us busie our selves daily abroad in the field or at home in the garden and what wonders of god's power and wisdom and goodness have we there constantly before our eyes and yet we profit no more in the knowledg of god by what we see than the beasts themselves
how many of us are very busie in studying and observing the courses of the stars and in searching in the secrets of nature and yet never have it once in their thoughts to learn any thing of god by all his wondrous works if we would strengthen our belief of god and make any proficiency in the knowledg of him we must design this and exercise our reason in every thing to that end and labour to tast and see how good and gracious how wise and powerful god shews himself in every thing we meet with
there

is not the most unlearned person in the world but if he will give diligent heed to what he hears of god though he connot read and to what he sees of god though he cannot see god himself he may find enough to confirm him in the belief of god and instruct him very far in the nature of god even past all doubting
especially


if in the next place he by serious prayer call upon god to open his eyes that they may see and his ears that they may hear and his heart that it may understand the things which he hath made necessary for him to believe and know
let us therefore in good earnest beg of god himself that he would shew and declare himself more clearly and convincingly to us in all the means of knowledg and understanding
no man can have a hearty desire to find god but he may assure himself that god upon his hearty request will shew himself unto him
if thou seek the lord thy god thou shalt find him if thou seek him with all thy heart and and with all thy soul deut
iv
god looketh down from heaven to see if there be any that understand and seek after god psal
xiv


but alas the wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek after god

god is not in all his thoughts psal

if men had rather be without a god than have one if men be unwilling and afraid to find god lest they should as certainly they must find in god a lord and master whom they are bound to serve and obey what wonder is it if god withdraw and hide himself from them that love him not why should he not depart out of sight when he is but an to them why should he not leave all those to the tyranny of their own lusts who desire not to have him reign over them what reason can be given why god should afford them any longer eyes to see withal who above all things cannot endure to see him or why should he not suffer satan to blind their minds that they may never again be able to see that light which they cannot love if we would know god let us shew by our earnest prayers that we long to know him

let us never have an ear open to any one whatsoever he be that calls in question the being of god or would bring us to doubt of it
but on the contrary let us resolutely stop our ears and refuse to hearken to the atheistical discourses of prophane and wicked persons of what rank note or esteem soever they may be in the world
let no

one perswade us to think it either unreasonable or unmannerly thus to behave our selves towards men of this temper
they may call us obstinate and sullen in refusing to hear reason and uncivil and clownish in turning away from our betters
but how eminent soever either for learning or honour any one may be who would entertain us with such discourses as tend to draw us off from believing a god it cannot be neither obstinacy nor incivility not so much as to take notice of what he saith

it cannot be thought unreasonable or an obstinate stubbornness not at all to hearken to any man's discourse which we are well assured can have no reason in it
and we are sure that whatever reason may be pretended as none brags more of his being a master of reason than the proud atheist yet no reason at all can be given us by any one for this opinion that there is no god or against our believing that there is one
and this is very plain because as hath been said no man can be in any degree sure that there is no god and the belief that there is one is at least probable and certainly doth much good and no hurt
what reason can there possibly be in a discourse perswading not to believe what can never be proved to be false what it's very

safe to believe and the belief whereof doth the greatest good imaginable or again what reason can that discourse have in it which tends to perswade us to believe what no man can shew to be true which it is so dangerous to believe that a man hazards his soul by it and the belief whereof will certainly make the wide world too uneasy a place to live in it cannot therefore be obstinacy or unreasonableness never to hearken to any discourse of which we know all this

neither can it be uncivil or unmannerly how great or eminent soever the person be that would entertain us with such discourses to turn away our ears from him
what incivility can it be to seem rude to him who is so rude to the whole world as in effect to call all men fools but himself yea how can one be uncivil to that man who declares himself the common enemy of mankind and of all civil society and government how can one be unmannerly to him whose discourse tends to no better end than to corrupt all good manners and to banish virtue from among men he that tells us there is no god by telling us so absolves and dischargeth us from all manner of duty honour or civil respect to himself as our better or superior
for if there be no god who made us to differ from one another who

made him our superior or us inferior to him god did not if he must be believed for he tells us there is none
and man could not without our consent for who gave any man that right over his fellows if he have got to be higher than any one else by might or cunning nothing can hinder any one to climb never he can as he has done or to trample him under foot instead of bowing the knee to him
whoever then tempts us to atheism is soon answer'd if we please
we need do no more but despise him
or if we will be at any farther trouble with him we need but ask him two or three questions and leave him to answer them to himself when he can


when he tells us there is no god and would have us believe it before we do so he cannot think it unreasonable we should ask him how he knows it if he can tell us this and will not he is too unkind to be thought a friendly counsellor and if he cannot we have little cause to be fond of such a teacher
is it reason to believe one upon his word that knows not that to be true which he teacheth is it wisdom to follow a guide who confesseth himself to be blind


when he persuades us to believe there

is no god it cannot but be very fit to ask again is it safe so to do or is it unsafe to do otherwise he cannot assure us tis safe to believe there is no god because he cannot make us know that there is none
and he must needs confess tis not unsafe to believe there is a god because it can do no hurt
is it reasonable then to leave the safe way we are already in that we may follow him into another wherein he cannot promise us any safety at all


if he would have us to believe there is no god tis not unreasonable to ask him why would he have us to believe it or what good will it do either him or us if it will do neither any good why should he persuade us or we be persuaded to an unprofitable thing there is danger in it and what reason is there to do what we know tis dangerous to do till we see what good may come of it


if he say tis fit to believe it merely because tis a truth we must needs ask again how doth he know tis a truth but yet tis in vain to ask him this because tis impossible for him to tell us how he knows it or to know it
and therefore we have yet no reason to believe it is a truth because he only

calls it so who doth not know that it is so
but suppose it were hope it may be fit to ask him again is he in good earnest and would he indeed have us to belive it for a truth if he be not willing we should believe it why doth he tempt us to believe it if he would indeed have us believe it would he not also have us behave our selves as men of that belief if not to what purpose are we to believe it if he would have us behave our selves as men that believe not a god then may we do what we will and can we may rob his house take his money defile his wife and cut his throat
if he deny this let us ask him what is it that can make it unlawful for us to do any of these things what should restrain men from doing any thing they can for their own advantage this is all that the atheist can gain by persuading men to be of his opinion that he lays himself at every man's mercy to deal as he will with him and cannot say that man sins that knocks him on the head for his good advice


if there be a god every one that is vvise will not only think himself highly concern'd to believe it but so to live and behave himself in the world as may be most pleasing and acceptable to god
to what purpose can it be tobelieve that there is a god or what good can this belief do us if it do not engage

us to live as men who are sensible that they have a god over them whom they are concern'd to please in all things certainly if there be a god who made us and all things he must needs be concern'd with us and we with him
and as we can expect no good thing but from him who is the author and disposer of all things so neither can we hope to receive any good thing from him if we do not our endeavour to please him
why should we thinkhe will bless us according to our desire if we be not careful to serve and honour him according to his will that therefore we may reap the good and benefit of this so necessary a belief we are to consider well what it is that we believe and what duty that belief must needs bind upon us
that which we believe is that there is a god and to be god is to be the first cause and author the maker preserver lord and governour of the whole world and all things therein the fountain of all power and wisdom and goodness and therefore the highest power the greatest wisdom and the chief good
now if god be all this then it is very easy for every one to see certain duties lying upon us as we are the creatures of god which naturally arise from what we believe even from this one point that there is a god


god being the first cause author and maker of all things he is the very fountain and original of all being and life power wisdom and goodness
all these are in him originally as in the inexhaustible spring and fountain and there can be nothing at all of any of these things in the world but what is derived from him neither can any of these be any longer in the world than it pleaseth him
all this must needs be very plain to every understanding
if then we will live as men who are sensible that there is a god by whom we live and without whom nothing can have either life or being

we must needs first have the highest and most honourable thoughts of god the greatest reverence and esteem for him that can possibly be in the heart of man
we are not to conceive of him as of one whose excellencies and vertues tho they exceed those of any other being whatsoever are yet contain'd within such or such bounds or limits or are at such a degree and no higher but we are to think of him as of one who in the perfectictions of the divine nature is infinitely above all the thoughts of men and angels of incomprehensible glory and majesty of boundless power wisdom and goodness such as is to be always admired and adored but never to be fully seen or understood
we are however

to labour every day to know more and more of him that the more we know the more we may admire and love and rejoyce and even be ravish'd with those unconceivable excellencies which to discern more clearly will be our eternal happiness in heaven
our hearts therefore should be always fill'd with and our mouths should sound forth the praises of god every one singing with the holy psalmist bless the lord my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name psal
ciii
bless the lord my soul
lord my god thou are very great thou art clothed with honour and majesty psal
civ
while live will praise the lord will sing praise unto my god while have any being psal
cxlvi

let every thing that hath breath praise the lord psal
cl
be thou exalted god above the heavens and thy glory above all the earth
psal
cviii

blessed be thy glorious name which is exalted above all blessing and praise neh ix

secondly it must needs be our duty to walk humbly before god and to abase our selves in his presence whose eyes are continually open upon us
we must always bear in mind that he is our god and maker and we are at best but the work of his hands and had never been any thing had he not been

pleas'd to give us a being
how wise how rich how great soever we now are or seem to the eyes of men we have it all even as far as our very being of god's free gift and he can whenever he pleaseth deprive us of all again
he made all things of nothing and therefore all things are nothing in comparison of him
what is the clay in the hand of the potter who can do with it what he will and how much less than that is man in the hand of god the potter can form the clay into a new shape or cast it away and trample on it but he neither gave it a being nor can take away it's being from it
but god gave us and all things our very being look therefore how much nothing is less than all things so much are the best of men less than god we being all originally nothing
say then with the psalmist
lord what is man that thou takest knowledg of him or the son of man that thou makest account of him man is like to vanity his days are as a shadow that passeth away psal
cxliv

behold even to the moon and it shineth not yea the stars are not pure in his sight
how much less man that is a worm and the son of man which is a worm job xxv
all nations before him are as nothing and they are counted to him less than nothing and vanity isa xl
verily every man at his best

state is altogether vanity psal
xxxix

and when ever god rebukes him he makes his beauty to consume away like a moth
surely men of low degree are vanity and men of high degree are a lie to be laid in the balance they are altogether lighter than vanity psalm lxii
and shall such a thing as man be proud can man seem any thing in his own eyes when he thinks upon god alas what cannot he do with us who with a word made all things of nothing what can we do either against him or without him without whom we cannot one moment continue in being


if god be the maker of us and of all things then is it past all dispute that both we and all things are his and that we cannot have the least right to our selves and therefore none to any thing else but what he is pleased to allow us
nothing could make him so absolute a right in and over us to use and dispose us at pleasure as this that he made us of nothing
we therefore and all things are absolutely his own and being so tis his indisputable right to order and dispose of every thing as it shall seem good to him to place us where he will give us what allowance he will assign us what condition he will and put us to what use and service it pleaseth him
know ye that the lord he is god

it is he that bath made us and not we our selves we are his people and the sheep of his pasture psal

therefore first it must needs be our duty most humbly to acknowledg god's absolute right in and to us and all things and in a due acknowledgment of the same to yield up our selves and all things most freely and without any grudging to be disposed of by him according to his own will and pleasure
we must leave it wholly to god to use his right as he pleaseth and to do what he will with his own knowing assuredly that whatsoever he doth with us or any other thing he doth but what he may do and can do us no wrong yea he always doth what's best and fittest to be done because he is of infinite wisdom and goodness
whatever therefore is come to pass or shall come to pass in the world whatever hath befallen or shall befal us it is our duty to submit to it and to set our hearts at rest about it remembring that god is always doing what best becomes him to do and permitting to be done what is most proper to be done
he doth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say unto him what doest thou dan
iv
what are we that we should concern our selves any farther with

god's doings whatever they be than to admire his wisdom in them the posture of soul wherein we should always be as best becoming us is that of a most humble and willing resignation of our selves and all our concerns unto his ordering every one saying after our most blessed jesus not as will but as thou wilt mat xxvi
and
thy will be done

secondly we are to account it our duty in all that we have or do so to behave our selves as becometh those who have nothing of their own neither are their own but must own both themselves and all they have to be his who made them
we must not therefore take to our selves any other liberty in any thing than what god gives us
we must not make so bold with his right as to do what we have a mind to do with our selves or any thing else but enquire first what he gives us leave to do
god is pleased to allow us as much liberty in all things as may do us good and hath freely bestow'd his good creatures upon us so far as they may be serviceable to us in our serving of him
but as we have them of his gift so hath he given them upon such terms and conditions as pleased him and upon no other terms we are to aceount them ours
together with them he has given us laws and rules to be careful

ly observed by us in the use of them
it were very absurd for us to think any thing so ours that we may use it to god's dishonour or to hurt our selves or others with what we have
our meat we have for nourishment not for gluttony our drink for refreshment not for drunkenness our cloaths for a decent and warm covering not for pride our wit our strength our wealth and all things to do good with but not to help or incourage us to hurt any one
all things we possess are our master's goods and we our selves are his servants
no man ought to say may do what will with mine own for nothing is so our own as that we are sole or absolute owners of it
as god is to be thank'd for the use and benefit of all so is he also to be consulted and obey'd in the use of all
for the earth is the lord and the fulness thereof the world and they that dwell therein
psalm xxiv

thirdly it must needs be our duty not to repine or murmur not to be fretful and impatient but to be content and satisfied whatever comes to pass

do evil doers and such as we think deserve worst at the hands of god flourish and prosper what's that to us god is but doing his pleasure with his own
have we

not all and more than is our due and hath not he whose own are all things a right to distribute them as he pleaseth hath god given others any thing that was ours and is it not of his free and undeserved gift that any thing is ours fret not thy self because of evil doers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity psal
xxxvii

rest in the lord and wait patiently for him fret not thy self because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man that bringeth wicked devices to pass
but wait on the lord and keep his way
what have we to do to murmur at god's disposing of his own

do we suffer evil things why should we not if it seem good unto god are we not his and may he not use his own as he will what ever the evils be or by whomsoever they are brought upon us we are to submit with patience
no instrument could hurt us if he did not permit it and may he not permit what he will to be done to his own are we rob'd or spoyl'd let us say the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord job
it is the lord let him do what seemeth him good sam
iii

whatever befals us let us say behold here am let him do to me as seemeth good unto him sam

was dumb and opened not

my mouth because thou didst it psalm xxxix


is our present condition scanty uneasy unpleasant unsuitable to our minds what are we that we should think to chuse for our selves this or that condition of life which we think best who are not our own neither can chuse whether we shall live or die is not our condition whatever it be better than we deserve and is it not of god's chusing for us and is it not fit he should place his own goods in his own house where and how he pleaseth have we not all that we have right to have when we have what it pleaseth god to give us and are we not in the condition we should be in when we are as it hath pleased god to dispose of us shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it what makest thou isa xlv
shall the thing formed say unto him that formed it why hast thou made me thus hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour rom ix
having food and raiment let us be therewith content tim
vi
yea this is our duty to learn in whatsoever state we are therewith to be content phil
iv


if there be a god who made both

us and all the world then is he our lord and the governour of all the world
as he alone by reason of his infinite power wisdom and goodness can be thought fit to rule the world so can he not have a more absolute soveraignty over it or right to govern it than that which is founded in propriety nor any propriety more sure and unquestionable than that which ariseth from creation or his making all things of nothing
therefore the lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens and his kingdom ruleth over all psal
ciii

it is then our duty to be subject to his laws and government in all things
to submit to his providence in ordering all the affairs of the world and to approve of all his wise dispensations whatever changes or alterations he makes in states or kingdoms
to obey all his laws and apply our selves diligently to the learning of them that we may frame our whole lives by them
it must needs concern us to be in the fear of the lord all the day long prov
xxiii

to stand in awe and not sin
psal
iv

again if god be our governour it must be our duty to trust to his government and rejoyce therein
for how can we be safer

or happier than to be under the government and protection of infinite power wisdom and goodness the lord reigneth let the earth rejoice let the multitude of the isles be glad thereof psal
xcvii

let us be careful for nothing phil
iv
neither take thought for the morrow mat vi
but trust in the lord and do good so shall we dwell in the land and verily we shall be fed psal
xxxvii

the lord will bless the righteous with favour will he compass him as with ashield isa


if there be a god who is the first cause of all things he must needs be the fountain of all blessedness and the chief good no good thing can be expected but from him alone and all our happiness must consist in his favour and love
and therefore the whole desire of our souls should be to continue in his favour and to have his love
nothing should be so much our study and endeavour even all the days of our life as how in all things to please him and to do such things only as we know to be most acceptable to him

next it must certainly be our duty to

love god above all things for tis most unnatural not to love that best which is best in it self and doth us most good
it is therefore our duty to love nothing more than god nothing so much as god nothing but in subordination or in relation to him
that is nothing but what god allows us to love and so as for the love of god we can any time be willing to part with it nothing but what may help us the better to love god and nothing that abates our love to god
we are to love god in all the things we love because nothing hath any loveliness but what is from god

and because god is the chief good we are to be content with god whatever else we want and whatever else we have never to be satisfied with it or to make account that we have any thing at all whilst we can find no good ground to hope that god is our god and that we are in his favour

and finally seeing god is the author of all goodness we are on all occasions most humbly to address our selves to him in prayer for a supply of all our wants of what sort soever and to return him our daily

praise and thanks for every good thing we enjoy

he that doth not thus behave himself towards god is no better for believing that there is a god neither whatever he may pretend shall he easily persuade any considering man that he believes any such thing

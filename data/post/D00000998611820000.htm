to the most vertvovs and therefore most accomplish'd lady the lady

madam

though other cards passe here and there vnder the name of nicholas benier'e and his protections good unlesse it be from the or monopoly
these cannot so a grand commission sits and every one's exciser of our wits wherefore these guardlesse fancies humbly fly into your hands for sweet security
all in one suite that you would deale them out and happily they then may go about
who will not say in ordinary kindnesse deliver'd by such hands they're cartes fines
they may perchance the happy fortune get of some new fashion where the ladies met and my good ladies dresse being lik'd and new all their good ladiships to like it drew
so may they draw when you doe once begin at least for your sake say give't me agen

to the ingenuous reader a directory to play
a iove principium
so these cards begin
perchance you'l aske what humour was in to be so pious when our luck being bad should have sworne and with the cards been mad it grieves me much to see the game so plaid sure there's foole play some cheating
i'm afraid
we dealt and clubs were trumpe and we had most and ace and king to boot and yet we lost

this drove me into serious thoughts and things

of higher notions of ace queenes and kings
and there found all well but you must have the truth
all these are worsted by the knave
to keep him right set a guard of ten ten goodly precepts and nine valiant men beside shew'd him what such tricks did wait in the first worlds correction except eight
shew him too to trust in starres is silly his grammar may as soon him save as lilly
but if he spent his sixe dayes as he shu'd himselfe would be as they and they were good
bid him his senses use
the members five his senses are by them hee'l live and thrive
then wroth said ransack the elements never more wicked knave nor worse intents they will get all
no mr peters wee will keep our threes faith hope and charity
and our two twoo's tam foole
no more tricks vent we keep the bible and the sacrament

to his deare friend the author
some men doe make no other use of play but only this to passe the time away
as if that which we all complaine's too short lingerd too long unlesse helpt on by sport
but thou deare friend hast so contriv'd thy pack· that we might neither time nor pastime lack
who passes here his time what e're they cost shall say in using these theres no time lost

the inspirer
to his deare friend the author upon his chartae scriptae
deare friend you make a dry dead stock to bring forth fruits an offering for the highest king heavens just tribute or an due from all alike but only paid by you

you digge up vice

and stay it in the root

beating downe sinne

before it spring or shoot

that vertue crown'd with glory may appeare

in diamonds

sparkling like the starry sphere where every one exceeding farre all art a jewell makes and beames of grace doth dart into the soul a charm for every sense as if inspir'd by some intelligence
thus you have pack'd the cards and dealt the game

and by your hearts

well playd all hearts you gaine

to his most loving friend the author
deare friend you chid me when said your pen reviv'd ben iohnson from his grave agen
tell me you criticks i'le be judg'd by you can there chartae scriptae due they all agree it and with mee allow as large a laurell to empale thy brow
they thinke tom randall if alive would be too weake a gamester to play with thee
since iustice why should your hate to your owne fame be such· if you'le not be commended leave to write so you'le want

an advertisement to the uertuous ladies
deale fairely ladies tis a pack of arrrant knaves what is't you lack

men dare not see themselves in print
hee is you something of the price and wit pay no excise
and if he but your favour winnes in the next pack you shall be queenes

on chartae scriptae
what more knaves yet nay then we're in our dumps for they're still followed by the smaller trumps
hang these we're so o're matcht an honest tenne cant stirre but straight hee's catcht but play not booty let no cards be seen and wee'le win yet see here th ace king and queen these are the leading ones if these ca'nt gett ev'n throw the rest wee'le sit by and bett

to his friend on his ingenious chartae scriptae
come my deare sister shall we have a game the cards are hallow'd now all but the name
here are religious kings and queens we may worke out salvation while we seeme to play
blest reformation see how grace gets in by th very meanes which did intice to sin
now may in godly sort the zealous mate deale with a brother yet communicate
they that forbad th'prophaner ace and duce should they see these they would command their vse
virtue thus conquers vice by an unknowne way and satan's beaten now at his owne play
what good may wee not hope for when we heare a sermon preach'd by nicholas benie're

incertus author to his anonymos friends
thank you friends for your conceits they're witty but let's remember myndus was a citty and had great gates whether it be command or play it is the word no more i'le stand

chartae scriptae
the ace vnity
eternall one who mad'st and knowst our hearts
how wonderfull art thou whose formost parts no eye can see and live the best of things doe homage unto thee even queenes and kings
and though the word now worser meaning have who was not borne thy vassall and thy knave all hearts are open unto thee· no shrowd to hide the low so base nor so proud to exalt the high thou lifrest up the low and down the proud do'st from their high hearts throw

the king of hearts
next to th ace on the earth the power of kings derivatively flowes as streames from springs pollute not then these chrystall waters no they must untouch'd to their owne fountain flow
so long as he pays duty to the ace he will defend his delegated place

and though at gleeke the knave in number be

more then the king yet the precedency is given to him in play and tom goes downe and do's his crosse homage to the crowne

the queene of hearts
alas what fortune's this here's not a packe the glorious card of all is gon we lacke the queene nor will we a small card suppose
we thanke the thistle that we want this rose
she's gon to play a better game from parts that forreigne are to get us
hearts then these at home then count it england's spring
when she and those hearts joine to ace and king

the king of diamonds
if ever king had such unvalued gemms flow'rs of his crowne then our great king had them
not aaron's brest plate brandish't such a ray nor darted so much lustre· as that day when that throughout these islands we could see of peace and plenty a monopoly
religion brought forth wealth but little after the honest dame was eaten by her daughter
two sparkling diamonds were this land's two eyes the through universities but now we bunke
his power at sea alone no prince can shew me such another stone
what pitty i'st such goodly pearles and fine should be cast out as now they are to swine

the queene of diamonds
great queen how thou hast cut thy way we have seen not now of diamonds but true diamond queene
thy greater pearles not like that unchast she who quaff'd them up dissolv'd with antony
to reinthrone thy injur'd lord thou sold't bart'ring for bullets diamonds· and uphold'st the crowne maugre thine enemies hate and scorne with high supporters feirce as th unicorne or lyon thus by gallant poverty thy selfe will the unvalued jewell be

the king of spades
this king resembles much prime monarchy
just such a king was adam as is he made by his sinne a sab'ring digging prince and so the greatest princes have beene since full of great cares and feares in throbbes of state in height bove others plac'd and so in hate laid open to reproaches censures scornes so that their crownes are truly crownes of thornes
by base misprision what they are not made so that they doe not call a spade a spade
vexing their sacred persons till they have no rest but by the spade and that i'th'grave

the queene of spades
upon the queene of spaines death
the mournfull court in heart meane not blacke for they mourne truly who their mourning lacke in elegiacke faces doth expresse for loyall spaine's great queene great heavinesse

more sorrow in a looke cannot be showne

have knowne lesse greife when mourning has beene on· who can forbeare a dolefull song to sing dead is the catholicke queene and christian king
if the popes title so small a power hath
god blesse pray we defender of the faith

the king of clubs
this is the worst of kings beware of him
king indeed but a meere popular pim voyc'd and cry'd up by impudence and noyse
guarded with store of apron men and boyes saylors and watermen and since the wives set to reforme their foremen venter lives more precious then their husbands to bring in religion and beate downe the man of sinne for which they exalt a levita in a tub· and he perswades to tumults the rude club
when swarmes of waspes and hornets buzze then fly
no honour in a crowd for majesty

the queene of clubs
to make a queene of clubs must extract the spirits of three ladies most exact the legislative preaching and prophetick these qualities well jumbled by a sedgewicke in close alembecke will a queene install most pure most vertuous and synodicall who shall go out and in before the people and preach high doctrine placed in the steeple these are the peoples joy their life their breath dearer then late most deare elizabeth

io the queene
a beast of vast commands

with many heads and tailes and many hands

the knave of hearts
am the worst of knaves others by art are wicked studyed me a knave at heart
where vile ingredients poyson all my will whatsoe're thinke or do is mischeife still
like to an indigestive stomack convert all good to bad here roguery originall is no vertue goodnesse love can such a monster save repre'hend reprove like a fierce mastiffe at your throat fly advice and counsell voyd cunningly
and by a mentall reservation make and breake oathes to damne a nation

the knave of diamonds
prince griffith
a precious knavel y'ould madams quarry enter while precious stones you craftily present her and rob her of a jewell above price
fowle ravisher only a prince in vice are these your close committees if you sit upon such plots we know what you commit
if that from brutus we derive our name like him let's bravely flay our nation's shame let not our chast lucretias suffer thus by an adulterous griffithins
make one order against him most just who pimp'd the sacred order for his lust

the knave of spades
this knave by stanch and forced gravity in a spade beard covers all pravity
you must not thinke his cato's face would cozen having the justice of the honest dozen good men and true yet this upright treader is closely link't unto the devils tedder so sanctified a cast of his white eye will usher nothing but a very lie
and while you imagine you a sure card have you'le finde this envious spade digging your grave

the knave of clubs
this is a foolish proud tumultuous chuffe whose mouth runs ore with filthy kitchin stuffe the scumme of private raylings which he vents now against kings and will gainst parliaments for this same knave likes nothing that hath power nor learning but whats infused in the houre
every thing's his greivance but beleives above all other things the poore lawne sleeves
he has a plaguy and malignant spight for his soules ste gainst any thing that's white
pound him to dust and his ingredients see he is compos'd of pride and villany

the tens
decem praecepta
these if they were kept have power enough to purge the world of all such knavish stuffe
in dreadfull thunderings upon sinas hill by divine pencill wrote the almighties will and high mandamus were these ten the jew had the first priviledge he heard and knew the legislative voyce whose majestie so dreadfull was it did the jewes to die
so they desired a speaker whose meeke soule in place of god might safely them controle yet he was mov'd from patience at the men and first of all broke all those blessed ten

the first provides that no atheist be against plurality and anarchie
am the lord thy god and alone not gods nor lords then are there no not none

the second shewes invisibility you may not picture what you cannot see god cometh as a winde
who can be found of cunningst painter that could paint a sound but know there is a decent use of images when t'any thou dost bow an idoll tis

that doth his nature keepe and this his name neither must common be what a shame is it to us that that name which the jewes durst not pronounce we frequently do use

without regard unto this precepts taile vengeance is his the sweares shall not faile

how faire and reasonable are thy demands lord of seaven dayes thou askest one
there stands an item to this precept shewes the ods six dayes we have our selves the seventh is gods
twill shame us if we yeild not on this day what on the other six you safely may you may not do now works then do wherein thy profit or thy pleasures are they're sinne do not the day to superstition force deny thy brother helpe and save thy horse
the workes forbad are workes of pride and hate to rest from works of love is reprobate

the greatest blessing that on earth can be is firme annexed unto loyalty
he that would nestor's age to's children give teach them to meane father and king long live


no man would hazard sure the curse of cain doe not thou kill nor wish the power of slaying
whose life thou would'st preserve through hate for shame in reputation murder not and name
yet thinke not hence there is no power to stay in spight of this the sword of justice may


stones cry the jewes for prov'd adultery
that is not all thou mayst not in thine eye nor in thy heart that private closet doe what may pollute thy selfe and neighbour too


thou shalt not steale from man nor god
the edge of this same precept will cut sacriledge


in publicke judgement nor mongst private freinds doe not by injury serve thine owne ends the bread that's got by anothers losse though sweet it is foule and marke it it is greet


here's little difference twixt my neighbour and my selfe both for the same priviledge stand
no longer let's be two my counterpart the very copy of my soule and heart
thy beast thy servants fortunes and thy wife are all as deare to me as my owne life

the nines
nine heroes

this number's not so sacred as the last but yet tis famous for the ages past laboured in this same number as a vie to manifest all humane gaslantry
we rake the christian heathen jewish state and by extraction make it sublimate in histories alembecke there were nine whose spirits as elixar did out shine the rest of men these were their dayes high noone amongst the lesser starres the exalted moone
wee'l mount em in their severall orbs and see how different their's from these dayes chivalry
god's cavalier joshua leads the valiant va
the conqueror of fruitfull canaan

the sunne and moone were in his muster roles and listed starres recruited his slaine soules
rivers retreated jordan was drove backe the blowing of hornes do jericho sacke thirty one kings all fell by him
no place was strong nor men no not the anakims race
yet one base lurking achans cursed sinne routed all israel have not we beene strangely dispirited and beat sometimes there is a cause brave cavaliers our crimes

david
what's fein'd st george and bevis to have done great david did indeed he ladies wonne by sling and sword when vast goliah lay after the beare and lyon the worse prey
what worthies were his captaines and if they such mighties were what was their king pray that gallant man after gods heart a king the peoples sinne provoking did a thing was folly to the lord
that sinne this day the people acts in a militia
be favourable lord and grant that we like him may feele but one curse not all three

judas mach
puissant judas strong in faith not men beat proud antiochus
his zeale even then unto jerusalem did brightest flame when that jerusalem was but a name
when heathen ignorance threw downe her courts and of their holy vestures made their sports may after ages charles give thee due praise who fightst as he the ruin'd church to raise

hector
hector did many valiant acts but he oppressed was by club and so are we
where homer's learned pen hath sweat and chast virgil hath sung for me to rime were wast

alexander
here's he for whom the world too little was he sweat in the streight compasse know the cause his large ambitious minde did know no bound as little roome serves him as me i'th ground

caesar
heres he that wept at alexanders tomb cause at his yeares he had not so much orecome
who did advance the aristocracy unto imperiall state though cruelly witnesse the dy of chang'd pharsalia's fields whose story lofty lucan fully yeilds
a man more famous for his pen or sword tis hard to judge nor can here afford
him when the fawning senate said they'd make happy and high basely his life they take

tres moderni arthur the prince renown'd for lady and his round table and his sturdy knights read now like to romances will be sound and what's his table now the whole world's round
shall not write of godfrey bulloignes duke nor yet shall charlemaine swell up this booke
no since my owne good charles is not the great unlesse it be in soule in cause more yet great in his wrongs great in his sufferings too
shame to write it countrymen to you
shall it be said and not recanted freinds have your great promises these homely ends

glorious and rich courage our lord was so

he made the world yet knew not whereto go

the nine muses
yet while by these this number's made divine let's not forget the muses they were nine
when those nine worthies shall augmented be by charles his nephews and his progeny and the swolne annals strout with thy brave deeds
which now the world in quaint mercurius reads
those nine well warm'd with a peculiar fire shall penne themselves thy warres and not inspire

eights
octo personae

when first drew this card it griev'd my heart for high offence this figure did impart
it call'd to mind that watry world when th earth was drown'd and of mankind a generall dearth
that high gigantick and rebellious race that fought against their god for highest place broke into drops like to a proud swolne wave and were intombed in a floating grave
high were the men the women heavenly faire and fruitfull too for continence was rare
wherefore god punisht their inconstant blood except eight persons with a constant flood

what ovid in his metamorphosis doth as a fable tell in truth is this and many wise men thinke that his was stolne out of the pentateuch of moses
and what you read of good deucalion and grandam pyrrah each one threw their stone

and they forthwith took kindly heat and life

is true in noah and his wife and sem and japheth and accursed cham and their three dames from whence all people came

the seminary of man was then the arke that too was of all beasts the moving parke the rabbins very pretty stories have of noah when he built that swimming cave
how that his neighbours wondred and did say good lord whither went my cock and hen to day anothers ramme and ewe his bull and cow her dogge and pretty bitch were here but now
and lamech loving doves but all were met and hundred couples more as if they had set some merry meeting at that huge new house which noah built there was the rendeavouze
a brace of lyons were met lovingly and tygers twaine and bears both he and she
and so of birds their paires in mighty joy as if they had all been flocking to a coy
thus while the amused world were wondring at the beasts procession not dreaming that a deluge would succeed they merry made and god ore whelm'd em ere they were afraid

sevens
septem planetae

if we may trust divining mr booker our new states wyzard and old starre looker
from the untoward conjunction of these starres ensue results of peace or bloudy warres

have not studied astronomie so farre

as to confute this sage albumazur yet remember when our archiflamen vpon prognosticks did the wight examine
and ask't him bonâ fide whether he by art could guesse certaine futuritie
he answer'd plainly no he could not tell but put things in to make th almanack sell

but that these lights have powerfull influence over inferiour corps is plaine to sence
as in all plants and waters and mans mind by unequall temperature is much inclin'd
yet the wise men whose number was not eight controle these seven and overlooke their fate
who under saturnes sullen raye are borne live melancholy and seeme to be forlorne
who under mars had their nativity to bloud and rage have a proclivity

the generous aspects of sol and jove vnto heroick actions people move
when these in an auspicious posture meet we shortly doe the birth of princes greet
so doe these rayes appeare i'th royall plant that we may judge who were predominant
for in thy early progresse like the sun about thy fathers kingdome thou hast run
while he triumphing like majestick jove shew'd thee the patterne of his state and love

this is the sparkling diamond of the sky the of heaven and bravery
which for th illustrious figure and quaint light is lady huisher to the day and night

her kind and pleasing influence doth raise

more then platonick heat and though her wayes are dark and secret and her fire's unseene for mercury a friend to th stealth hath been
yet mistrisse luna in her nightly round hath heard the cryes of this platonick wound

sixes
opus sex dicrum

if the same sixe be truly understood the reader will perceivd that all were good
for need must they be good whom the best best himselfe made and on the day took rest
gods working dayes were sixe one resting day so must ours be but not a rest to play
for when the great creator finish'd had and saw all good for nothing could be bad into himselfe he did reflect to see the power and goodnesse of the trinitie
imitate man and though sixe dayes thou spend vpon thy selfe in him let the end

the first daies worke
that there might be a first daies worke the light was first created seperate from night
night which was nothing but a want of day and gets a being when that's gone away
iust such is that in which this blinded land doth grope unwillingnesse to understand

naturall privations serve to produce

but voluntary darknesse's of no use

the second
the next daies labour was that canopy the vulgar usually doe call the skie· and is that glorious substance which is spread like a blue spangled mantle or'e our head
the seat of god mounted so exceeding high it is not to be reach'd untill we dy
the singer sweet doth it a curteine call draw it lord and entertaine us all

the third
for all that high precedency of birth the lowest is most courted this base earth
which when it first was made did freely give all that by which with sweat we now do live
twas meadow all and no inclosure then what god made common was inclos'd by men
to make a land like that tis my advice downe with inclosures they're no paradise
laying of ground to ground doe none of these the gathering of waters were the seas

the fourth
heaven in it selfe was glorious enough yet as a pallace with rich household stuffe thou deest lord thy dwelling place with lights of lesse and greater magnitude
our sights cannot behold their lustre even they dazle that rule the night who rules the day

is the great author of our heat and light

yet is not hot nor seen of any sight
let us lord on earth to thee consent to make thy houses full of ornament
and as to worship them's idolatry so in thy adorn'd churches let it be

the fifth
the watry regions had no people yet but wave with wave did play and nimph nimph met· when great leviathan no tyrant than was made of the ocean
and scaly officers in shoales did presse vnto his then not dreaded dreadfullnesse
vnder whose vast demensions safe did lye as in a trench the finny ministry
like lord like servants who did execute by signes his will for both as fish were mute
farre different were the vast aires feather'd peers where warbling birds sing to the playing spheres

the sixth
this was the great compleating day god's last and best of workes not hundled up in hast
wherein the species sensitive were made those wondrous beasts of which we'r now afraid whose mutuall kindenesse to each other prove them all created by the god of love
so sweet an innocence fil'd every thing serpents no poyson had and bees no sting
the lamb and wolfe together friendly lay no then nor doggs to part a fray
wolves in were and sheep indeed as quiet as in the picture they did feed

they were so far from injury that they

expected dayly whom they should obey
then sate the divine iunto the great three in consultation who that should be to whom the soveraignty of sea and land should be committed such a vast command was fit for none but who could represent himselfe he therefore his owne image lent and stampt an impresse of divinity· into a peice of clay such as you see and it upstarts a glorious creature wise and innocent and meek in his owne eyes the joy of angels and the divels hate the lord ot'h creatures high and fortunate
who all out of innate obedience came and knew from him their essence in their name this solitary monarch could not see amongst his servants fit society but from himselfe as from the noblest earth· and choice materialls woman had her birth
so all were the beasts to see the man he eve and they the trinity

fives
quinque sensus

seeing
the diamond sense the bodies faithfull guide

is meerly unto psyches selfe allied

soule of the senses this· whose chearfullnesse
even as in death for blindenesse is no lesse

without the sight is dampt
he that's borne blind

walkes in a sleep and only lives in mind
that such a one may live he first must dye the resurrection's his nativity

hearing
the soules intelligence and nimble scout iust like the scout doth truths and tales put out
for at these subtle doth not stand a sentinell who may the word demand before it passe but every word doth flye into the presence chamber instantly
the convoy of our faith sciences clewes the staple and the magazine of newes

touching
tactus has got so great an excellence that to want it is said to have no sense
never heard of any thing but one that was insensible and shee alone
but in a just recruite ought to abound with that fine sixth sense which great scaliger found
the bodies this no little harme but presently the touch doth give alarme·

tasting
our victualls garnish entertainments flourish without our palates we like embryons nourish as much delight the infant takes in his meat as when'ts unrelished
this is the sawse of sawse this salt doth season our appetites second
manciple to reason

smelling
could you a face in any wise suppose handsom without this goodly ridge the nose iust such a nonsense nose as that's a face is that which wants this rare olfactive grace
the loadstone of the brain the sense magnetick natures and groome prophetick

foures

quatuor elementa

fire

these are the subtle principles oth world

which where they're temper'd well or rashly hurld doe make their compounds plausible or loath'd all things in these though undiscern'd are cloth'd
in extasie at this the good king said i'me fearfully and wonderfully made
the art and wisedome of the deity which from confused chaos where did lye these blended elements in strange disguise gave them their place and due proprieties and did advance the active fire so high it's next unto the throne of majestie

aire
this into severall regions is decided for breath for swaggering winds and snowes provided
the magazine of heavens here artillerie which oft in dreadfull thundrings rend the skie

and gives proud tyrants check· which bravely awe

all under powers and guard the supreme lawe
this like a silken girdle doth surround the moving waters and the fixed ground
this is a proteus which in quaint attire condens'd is water rarified is fire

earth and water
these two are inmates to each other friends checqred together in kind mutuall blends
so necessary neighbours to us that all pleasures are as they are scituate
when our fond thoughts are wearied in the sports o'th earth we dally in the watry courts this glazen element unlesse the wind dimple her surface is most smooth and kind
her numerous subjects farre the earth's exceed and are the great supply of humane need
what wealth are in their bowells hid her jewells and t'others gold are all contentions fuell

quatuor anni tempora

it were unseasonable to passe these foure

in which our life is pass'd
nay count them o're
you'l find in every man even every season so man is but a yeare indued with reason
his is the spring when flowry cheeks and smiling looks a springall him bespeaks
the summer is his youth which harvest yeelds himselfe of corne a constant standing field's

he hath his fall too and autumnall change

and snow and winter on his white haires range
they differ thus the season never failes but oft in spring and youth death man assailes

threes
virtutes theologicae

faith
hand of the soule and eye what silly we

nor see

nor comprehend for majestie

by faiths attain'd· and what the heathen thought so strange and papists dangerously have taught without a miracle or ethnick jeere by faith we feed on god hee's christmasse cheere
and as of a good conscience he profest so we oth sacraments it is a feast
a feast where angels would kneele downe and eat where gods the entertainer and the meat
away these sinfull senses get you hence you let in vice
faith is the christian sense

hope
wer't not for thee what commonly we speake is very true our very heart would breake
mother of patience sweetner of all losse supply of want miseries
the anchor of this floating island where our hope doth live but strait begirt with feare

the penitents cordiall bezar stone of griefe

the parted's internuntius prisoners reliefe the only key of heaven which doth ope when faith and charity doe cease to hope

charity
the glew of earth and heaven whose new state is to be now conjoyn'd not separate
so great god's love unto his creature is that both are joyn'd in one hypostasis
love borne when name of duell was not known and with astraea and the rest hence flowne
wrapd up in
mantle which doth hide and not proclaim the faults that are espied
antipathy of hate keene malice's regret at very name of foule revenge shee'l sweat
the centry of my neighbours fame and house salvation's universall rendevouz

two's

duo testamenta

these are god's magna charta

the ancient law

which did the jewes now doth the christian awe
who for themselves are credited the ground of their owne truth and rule of what is found
not both like plausible the letter red in that and threatning death appropriated in certaine priviledges unto a few and hid in types scarce knowne unto the jew

the other's· letter faire and plaine that he

that runs may read and for all commers free
a testament of such extent which makes the world executor he that will partakes

duo sacramenta

these in their types were bloody

and did fright

the heathen world from their severer rite the jew did want his spectacles in part nor did the circumcision see oth heart
but doted on the outward formes and
became lesse iew and was but one in
he saw the infant bleed but understood no issue of his sinne but only bloud
and knew not when he us'd his cruell knife the wound in's flesh was gainst his sinfull life
so when with bitter herbs the paschall lambe was eaten by the sonnes of abraham they look't not throw the mystery nor saw in pharo's satans tyranny
and so for all their great deliverance are still asleepe in an aegyptian trance and feed on shadowes while the lambe indeed was slaine by them but they no whit will feed
no more let superstition them befoole nor thoughts of iordan or bethesda
poole
but give them grace good lord they may confide ith streame of bloud and water from thy side

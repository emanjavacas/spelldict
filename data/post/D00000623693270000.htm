the hvmble and ivst remonstrance

of the knights citizens and burgesses in parliament assembled in jreland
printed for hugh perry in the yeare

to the right honorable the lord deputie

shewing that in all ages past since the happy subjection of this kingdome to the imperiall crowne of england it was and is a principall study and princely care of his majestie and his most noble progenitors kings and queenes of england and ireland to the vast expence of treasure and blood that their loyall and dutifull people of this land of ireland being now for the most part derived from the brittish ancestor should be governed according to the municipiall and fundamentall lawes of england that the statute of magna charta or the great charter for the liberties of england and other laudable lawes and statutes were in severall parliaments here enacted and declared that by the meanes thereof and of the most prudent and benigne government

of his majestie and his royall progenitors this kingdome was untill of late in its growth to a flourishing estate whereby the said people were hearetofore enabled to answer their humble and naturall desires to comply with his majesties royall princely occasions by the free gift of
ster and like wise by another gift of
ster more during the governement of the lord viscount after by the gift of
their free cheareful gift of
entire subsidies in the
yeare of his majesties reign which to comply with his majesties then occasions signified to the then house of co~mons they did allow should amount in the collections unto
although as they confidently beleeve if the said subsidies had not beene levied in a moderate parliamentary way they would not have amounted to much more then halfe the said sum besides the foure entire subsidies granted in this present parliament
so it is may it please your lordship that by the occasion of the ensuing and other grievances and innovations though to his majesties no considerable profit this kingdome is reduced to that extreme universall poverty that the same is now lesse able to pay a subsidies then it was heretofore to satisfie all

the before recited great payments his majesties most faithfull people of the same doe conceive great feares that the grievances and the consequences thereof may hereafter be drawn into precedents to be perpetuated upon their posterity which in their great hopes and strong beliefe they are perswaded is contrary to his majesties royall and princely intention towards his said people some of which said grievances are as followeth


first the generall and apparent decay of trades occasioned by the new illegall raysing of the booke of rates and impositions as xij a piece custome for hides bought for

or
and many other heavie impositions upon native other commodities exported and imported by reason thereof of the extreame usage and sensures marchants are beggred and both and discouraged to trade and some of the honorable persons who gaine therby are often iudges and parties and that in conclusion his majesties profit thereby is not considerably advanced

ii
secondly the arbitrary decision of all civill causes and controversies by paper petitions before the lord lieutenant and

lord deputy infinite other judicators upon references from them derived in the nature of all actions determinable at the common law not limited unto certaine times seasons causes and things whatsoever and the consequence of such proceedings by receiving immoderate unlawful fees by secretaries clerkes pursivants serjeants at armes otherwise by which kind of proceedings his majesty loseth a considerable part of his revenue upon originall writs otherwise and the subject loseth the benefit of his writ of errour bill of reversall vouchers and other legall and just advantages and the ordinarie course courts of justice declined

iii
thirdly the proceedings in civill causes at the councell boord contrary to the law and great charter and not limitted to any certaine time or season

iv
fourthly that the subject is in all the materiall parts therof denied the benefit of the princely graces and more especially of the statute of limitations of the
ian granted by his majestie in the
yeare of this reigne upon great advice of the counsell of england and ireland and for great consideration then published

in all the courts of dublin and in all the courts of this kingdome in open assizes whereby all persons doe take notice that contrary to his majesties pious intention his subjects of this land have not enjoyed the benefit of his majesties princely promise therby made

fiftly the extrajudiciall avoyding of letters patents of estates of a very great part of his majesties subjects under the great seale the publique faith of the kingdome by private opinions delivered at counsell board without legall evictions of their estates contrary to the law and without precedent or example of any former age

vi sixtly the proclamation for the sole exemption and uttering of tobacco which is bought at very low rates and uttered at high and excessive rates by meanes whereof thousands of families within this kingdome and of his majesties subjects in severall islands other parts of the west indies as your petitioners are informed are destroyed and the most part of the coyne of this kingdome is ingrossed into particular hands insomuch that your petitioners doe conceive

that the profit arising ingrossed therby doth surmount his majesties revenues certaine and casuall within this kingdome and yet his mastjestie receiveth but very little profit by the same

vii
seventhly the unusuall and unlawfull increasing of monopolies to the advantage of few to the disprofit of his majestie and the impoverishment of his people
viii
eightly the extreame and cruell usage of certaine late commissioners and other towards the british farmers and inhabitants of the city and county of by meanes whereof the worthy plantation of that country is almost destroyed and the inhabitants are reduced to great poverty and many of them forced to forsake the country the same being the first and most usefull plantation in the large province of vlster to the great weakening of the kingdome in this time of danger the said plantation being the principall strength of those parts

ix ninthly the late erection of the court of high commission for causes ecclesiasticall in these necessitous times the

proceedings of the said court in many causes without legall warrant and yet so supported as prohibitions have not been obtained though legally sought for and the excessive fees exacted by the ministers thereof and the incroaching of the same upon the jurisdiction of other ecclesiasticall courts of this kingdome

tenthly the exorbitant and barbarous fees and pretended customes exacted by the clergie against the law some of which have been formerly represented to your lordship

xi eleventhly the petitioners doe most heartily bemone that his majesties services and profits are much more impaired then advanced by the grievances aforesaid
and the subsidies granted in the last parliament having much encreased his majesties revenue by the buying in of grants and otherwise and that all his majesties debts then due in this kingdome were satisfied out of the said subsidies and yet his majestie is of late as your petitioners have been informed in the house of commons become indebted in this kingdome in great summes and they doe therefore humbly beseech that

an exact account may be sent to his majestie how and in what manner his treasure issued

xii twelfthly the petitioners doe humbly conceive great and just feares at a proclamation published in this kingdome in anno dom
prohibiting men of quality or estate for to depart this kingdome into england without the lord deputies license whereby the subjects of this kingdome are hindered and interrupted from free accesse and addresse to his sacred majestie and privie counsell of england to declare their just grievances or to obtaine remedy for them in such sort as their ancestors have done in all ages since the reigne of king henry the second and great fees exacted for every of the said licenses

xiii
thirteenthly that of late his majesties late atturney generall hath exhibited informations against many ancient burroughs of this kingdome into his majesties court of exchequer to shew by what warrant the said burroughes who heretofore sent burgesses to the parliament should send the said burgesses to the parliament
and thereupon for want

of an answer the said priviledge of sending burgesses was seized by the said court which proceedings were altogether coram non judice and contrary to the lawes and priviledges of the house of parliament and if way should be given thereunto might tend to the subversion of parliaments and by consequence to the ruine destruction of the and that the house of commons hath hitherto in this present parliament bin deprived of the advice and counsell of many profitable and good members by meanes thereof

xiv fourteenthly that by the powerfulnesse of some ministers of state in this kingdome the parliament in its members and actions hath not his naturall freedome
xv fifteenthly that the fees taken in all the courts of justice in this kingdome both ecclesiasticall and civill and by other inferior officers and ministers are so immoderately high that it is an unspeakeable burthen to all his majesties subjects of this who are not able to subsist except the same be speedily remedied reduced to such a moderation as may stand with the condition of this realme

and lastly that the gentry merchants and other his majesties subjects of this kingdome are of late by the grievances and pressures aforesaid and other the like very neere to ruine and destruction
and farmers of customes customers waiters searchers clearkes of unwarrantable proceedings pursevants and gaolers and sundry others very much inriched whereby and by the slow redresse of the petitioners grievances his majesties most faithfull and dutifull people of this kingdome doe conceive great feares that their readinesse approved upon all occasions hath not beene of late rightly represented to his majesty

for remedy whereof the said petitioners doe humbly and of right beseech your lordship that the grievances and pressures may be speedily redressed
and if your lordship shall not thinke fit to afford us present reliefe therein that your lordship may admit a select committee of this house of persons uninteressed in the benefit arising the aforesaid grievances to be licensed by your lordship to repaire to

his sacred majesty in england for to pursue the same and to obtaine fitting remedies for their aforesaid and other just grievances and oppressions and upon all just and honorable occasions they will without respect of particular interest or profit to be raised thereby most humbly and readily in parliament extend their utmost endeavours to serve his majesty and comply with his royall and princely occasions and shall pray

THis prese~t boke is called the Mirrour of golde to the sinfull soule the whiche hath ben translated at parice oute of la+ten in to frensshe and after the translacion seen and corrected at length of many clarkis Doctours and maisters in diuinite and nowe of late tra~slated oute of frenche in to Englisshe by the right excellent princesse Margaret moder to oure souerain lorde kinge Henry the .vii. and Countesse of Richemond derby.
The wise man in his boke named Ecclesiastes consideringe the miserye and fraylete of the worlde saith that it is vanite of alle vanites And all thing{is} that ben in the worlde present ought to be called vanites therfore saith the holy doctour saint Gregory that there is noon mo+re acceptable sacrifice to god: then is gode zele that it is to say an hernest desire to the weale of soules For the whiche cause haue willed to make and accomplisshe this present trety gederinge assemblinge many diuerse auctoriteis of holy doctours of the churche to thentent that the pore synfull soule troubled by the fraude of enmye and oft ouercome: May by holy monicions and auctorites be ad+dressed to the light of iustice and trouth And so led by the meane of the holy gooste that the shepe that were perisshed may be reduced and led agayne to their grene paster.
And to the ende also that the po+re soule redressed and reuokinge his errour knowinge his synne and by inwarde sorowe of concricion conuertinge hym to god and therwith to do suche penaunce as he fynably may with all the saint{is} possede the lyfe eternall as saithe Crisostome sith it is so that from day to day vanyte of all vany+teis abuseth vs theym that in the delit{is} of this my scheuous world is co~uersant they ought in their ya+tis wallis habitacions their clothinge all pla+ces where moost ordinately they vse to be: that they shold write and make to paynte but principal+ly in their co~science this faire auctoritie vanitas va+nitatu~ et om~ia vanitas.
To thende that often of the daye and of the night.
they may haue if afore their Iene and fele it in their hert.
And for somoche that paynters and Images of foulysshe pleasures de+ceyueth theym that so deliteth? It is right confiena+ble and helthfull in euery company as well in drinkynge as other occupacions. often to synge and resite ths present wordis vanite of all vaneties and all thinge of this worlde is vanite.
Cer+tainly soo saithe crisostome all thingis passeth but oonly the seruice and loue of god And for to know the order and maner howe to procede in this lytell boke.
It is to knowe it shalbe deuided in .vii. chapi+tours after the vii. dayes of the weke.
To thentent that the synfull soule solyed and defowlyd by synne maye in euery chapitoure haue a newe mirrour wherin he maye be holde and consyder the face of his soule.

cursed mischeuous pore soule leste of all for getton cast out without any memory for thy miserable abused synnes is not so ordeyned that deth shall come? certainly ye shall dye and aswell a prince as other shal fall Saint Bernard spekinge of the co~dicion of man after the deth? saith that the+re is no thinge more stinkinge or horrible then Ca+rione of a dede man for he of whome in his lyf the enbrasementis and collingis were swete and plesaunte: In the deth it is horrible and detestable to beholde.
And for so moche he sayde after man? the wormes. after the wormes: stike horrour.
what proffettis then in this present worlde Riches delitis and honour.
The delitis deliueryth hym not from wormes ne the honours frome stinke: and of the seluesame saint Iohn~ crisostome howe moche hathe it prouffited to theym that in lechery and in vo+luptuoies of the body hathe continued to the laste daye of this present lyfe.
LEchery is enmy to all vertues and to alle goodnes and for that saithe Boice in his thirde boke of consolacion that he is happy that lyueth withoute lechery for lechery is a swete sykenes and bringith a man to dethe or euer he perceyue it as witnessith valerie in his .ix. boke the whiche valerie also in his .iiii. boke telleth howe Iosephus in his age demaundide of on yf he were not lecherous ¶And he answered praye the speke to me of so~me other thinge For as am aduised haue had a greate victorie that maye by age eschewe lechery For by lechery alle euyllis commythe and to that creature alle goode thinges be troubled Alas what was the cause of the distruccion of the people of Sichen? but for vio+lacion of digne the doughter of Iacob the whiche wolde goo to see to the daunc{is} and there rauisshed as it apperith in the booke of Ienesie in the .xxiii.
¶we rede also of many that is to saye moo then fifty thousande were slayne by cause of the lecherye comytted with the womon of leuite as it apperith in the .xx.

But the cursed son+nes of Adam leauith the true and helthfull studies demaundeth thing{is} passinge transitorye ther+fore if thou wyll in thyn hert by right deliberacion dreme co~sider the vilete of this lyf? fle pride fo+lowe mekenes? in knowyng that pride is the syn~e by the whiche the deuyil dyuideth knoweth his? fro~ other.
wherfor Iob saith i~ his .xlv. chapitur the deuyl is king ouer all the so~nys of pride saint gre+gory saith? that the true signe of euyll me~ is pride the signe of gode is meknes by theis .ii. signes be knowen the {ser}uau~t{is} of god the {ser}uau~t{is} of the deuil furthermore Isodor saith yt the proud soule is lef+te of god? made a habitacle of deuill{is} to the wich purpose saith the wise ma~ yt pride is to be hated of god ma~. so as it well ap{per}ith.

HE that doeth or comyttith synne is seruaunt to the deuyll the whiche from his begynnin+ge comytted synne: And soo as it is written in the first Canone of saint Iohn~ the first chapitour syn is a dede so heuy that the heuen wyll not suffer it nor in thende the erth shall not susteyn it but it shal discende in to hell with hym that co~mytted it And we ought to knowe also as saint Augustyne saith all thing{is} said or done by desire of concupiscence against the lawe of god is synne the whiche thyng all creatours that willyth or desireth their saluacion ought with all their diligence flee and withsta~+de and principally for .iii. thinges.
¶The firste is for somoche as synne is right displesaunt to god.
¶The secounde is aboue all thingis it is pleasure to the deuyll.
¶The thirde for somoche that synne is moste noyaunce to man.
pore synner and miserable man say vnto the that thou ought with souerayn diligence flee and withstande all synne by cause it is the thinge to god thy creature displea+sau~t Also that thou mayst consider thinke what god hathe done for hate and detestacion of synne.
For god our creatour for the displeasure of synne? distroyed and put to an ende nighe all his werkis That is to knowe alle the worlde by the flode of noe as it is written in the .vii. of genesie.
Also we ought to knowe that god hath nat wasted and di+stroyed as other kyng{is} and princis ded waste and distroye the landes of their enmyes for their dama+ge and defaultis: but god hathe distroyed and wa+sted his oonly propre lande for the displeasure of synne that was entred in to it in so greate aboundaunce that all his lande perisshed And furthermo+re god hath not synne in his displeasour oonly but also he hath displeasure with all that touches or is {per}ticipant with synne.
And so ought we to knowe that god is not as the men for they caste not theyr cuppes pott{is} pecis of syluer golde in to the see for the corrupt wyne that is within them but they cast out the stinkyng wyne kepith their vessels in suertie but god dothe not in this maner with syn~e for he casteth not only synne awaye: but with that he casteth puttith to {per}dicion the vesselles of sinne That is to knowe the reasonable creatours who+me he hath made to the semblaunce of his Image And with his precious blood bought agayn from dampnacion.
The whiche pore soules for synne he shall caste in to the great depe see of hell they so dye.
And therfore it is saide in the boke of sapience in the .ix. chapitour The synner his synne is most in the Dignacion of god For god hath not so gode a frende in heue~: ne in erth: but that he hateth to the deth if he fynde in hym one only mortall synne for saint peter had dyed in synne when he the thirde tyme denyed our lord not withstanding that he lo+ued ihu~ crist more bre~nyngly then any of the other apostels.
He had ben co~de~pned by the diuine Iusti+ce of almighty god Secu~dly it is well shewed vs ¶Howe almighty god hatyth synne when he for synnes of the worlde wolde make his oonly and pure Innoce~t son piteously to dye the whiche thin+ge witnessith Isaye in his boke the fyfty fourthe Chapitour sayng haue deliuered and geuen my only sonne to deth for synne of people for the sonne of god so as it is written i~ the same boke of Isaye? hath willed to deliuer his soule to deth to distroye synne.
Nowe consyder who is he then that for the hate of his enmye wolde make his oonly and propre son to dye. ¶Thirdely this same self thinge is shewed in that almighty god in the first begynnin+ge cast synne out of heuen And god seyng yet that syn~e continued in the erth: he of his mercyful good+nes and frewyll.
Discended frome heuen in to the worlde and put out synne And at the daye of Iugement he shall caste and close synne in to the pytte of hell. wherfore Michee saithe in the laste Chapitour he shall caste in to the depth of the see our synne For god in the greate daye of Iugement shalle caste in the depe see of helle the synners with their syn~es ¶Fourthly it is to shewe that god souerain+ly hathe synne in open detestacion by this similitude for the good moder hathe inwardly the thinge in hate by the whiche she shold put her son in bren+nynge fyre neuer take hym out.
For not withstandinge he hathe loued his children with so brennynge loue.
That for theym he had wyll to dye when the day of Iugement shall co~me he shall condempne theim in to euerlastinge fyre yf he fynde in theym one only mortall synne And thou pore synfull soule then for so moche that thou seest vnderstandeth howe moche almighty god hateth and hath abhomynacion of synne: if thou wyll please hym: thou oughtest before all thy workis flee and withstande alle synne And gyue hym in the noo place ne habitacyon.
For thou well knowest that the wife sholde be right vntrewe that wold ley in her bed a ma~ that shulde pursue the deth of her housbounde wherby many euyllis might co~me to hym.
Nowe is it soo then that synne is the thinge that our lorde Ihu~ ca+ste the true spowse of soules whiche he hath so mo+che willed to loue that by their contynuau~ce of syn many euillis hathe hapened them and fynably the dethe And therfore right dere frende thinke of thy saluacion flee synne and herken the monicion of Dauid the prophete the whiche saith i~ this maner my almyghty god pray the yeue me a fyrme pure and clene harte And that it listeth to renewe my inwarde {per}ties with thy holy and sacrid spirite.
¶Secoundely thou ought souerainly wyth all diligence flee synne principally deedly synne for that is the thinge that most pleaseth reioisith our goostely enmye the deuyll as thou maist know by thre signes ¶The firste is that the fende askethe noon other disporte or wynnynge but only the sou+les. wherfore it is written i~ the .xl. chapitour of genesie that the deuyll spake to god: saiyng to hym in this maner gyue me the soules of thy creatures all the remnaunt kepe to thy selfe.
And saint Grego+ry saith that the deuyll estemyth or Iug{is} no thinge doon that pleasithe hym: yf it hurte not the soule.
with the darte of deadly synne For he doth as the birde for his praye.
He sercheth nor askith noon other thinge for his refeccion but the harte In lyke+wise the deuyl asketh of man no thinge but the sou+le The secounde thinge is that the deuyl aboue all desireth and loues synne For his co~tynuall tempta+cion For in co~myttyng of synne he was neuer we+ry ne ouer traueled.
For he hath ben purchasynge synne by the space of .vi. M. yere more and neuer was wery nor fatigate but alwaye sercheth enquireth the new maner to make the creatur to co~mytte syn~e.
For as it is writte~ in the first chapitur of Iobe that when almighty god asked of the deuill from whens he co~me he answered that he had circuyed all therth The whiche is a signe he occu+pyed alway to moue synne neuer can take rest for this cause is the auctorite folowyng taken i~ the boke of Iobe i~ the .iii. chapitour saiyng in this ma+ner they yt deuoure me slepith not.
The thirde signe wherby it may be knowen that the fe~de is soue+rainly pleased wt syn~e For so moche he was neuer satisfied wt syn~e not withsta~ding yt he hath by sin+ne deuored infinite thousand{is} of men yet is he alwaies hu~gry as the ragious lion euer sechi~g how he may deuoure moo And as saint Peter saithe he is not only hungry of mete but with yt he thurstith for drynke wherof saith Iobe the flode is horrible and the deuyll merueleth not therof for he hathe trust that the flode of Iordane shall entre in to his throte that is to say in to hell and the flode that the deuell so swaloeth without meruelinge is the syn+nes co~mynge day and night in to the swallowinge of hell the whiche he desireth souerainly to deuour And more clerly to proue that the deuyll takith in syn~e his dilectacion we haue an example in the lyf of faders in the chapitour of deuylles. how one of theym a monge other was praysed and honored of his prynce of deuyll{is} was set i~ a chayre bifore all other in signe of victorie Bicause that he had led brought to the synne of fornicacion a mo~+ke the whiche by the space of .lxiii. yere before he myght not drawe to synne Nowe therfore synful soule wepe bitterly as longe as thou hast reioyced against the? thy enmies.
That is to knowe the fen+dis whom thou hast reioyced as many tymes as thou hast mortally synned And for the tyme to come? order the by pure confession worthy satisfac+cion? to make thy lorde god Ioye in the with all his aungellis. for as saith saint Luke in his xv. cha+pitour the aungell{is} of heue~ reioyces theym. when a synner is conuerted and dothe penau~ce Thrydely thou oughtest studiously to flee withstand syn+ne for it annoyeth the is more co~trary to the then any other thynge in somoche that by synne we beparted frome the loue of god be made his enmyes. as saith the prophete Isaye in his .xix chapitour Oure iniquities hath put deuision bitwene god vs And our synnes hath withdrawen his face fro+me vs that is to say frome our vision.
For there is noon in paradise so iuste nor so holy? if he co~mytted synne? but a noon he shulde fall in to he. and lese the loue of god to the whiche purpose saithe saint Augustyne he that co~mytteth faulte or synne agaynst his true and moste true frende? ought to be reputed greatly reprouable Nowe then it behoueth the to knowe and vnderstond that by a more stronge reason he that co~myteth faulte or synne against the souerayn debonayre all mighty god? ought well to be reputed and of al holden abhomynable.
Four thely it is to knowe that by synne the synner is Iu+ged to the Iebet of hell for so moche as the lawe of god is not farre different fro the lawe of man? Therfore in lyke maner al the brekers of the lawe of man? whiche dothe trespace againste the kingis Royall magestie? be worthy to deth and ought to be punysshed corporally.
So in sembliable wyse the pore and miserable synners: whiche haue offen+ded not oonly the temporall prince: but to the heue~ly kinge: ought well to be condempned to be han+ged in hell perpetually as it is written in the boke of Esdras the .xiiii. chapitour And in lyke wyse in decre of daryous in the whiche he saith thus it ou+ghte to be shewed that who so euer trangresseth breketh the lawe yeuen written as touchyng the synne of co~myssion: or ellis dispises it: as touchinge the synne of omyssion: they ought to take of the pro+pre wode that is to say of the gardeyn of their pro+pre conscience for in the consciens growyth a tree wheron the synner is hanged and his gode dedes be forfeated and ascribed For by cause he hathe offended and dispised the lawe of his prince.
¶Also in lyke wyse the punysshemente of synnes in wicked creatures: retourneth to the glory of the heuenly kinge as the rewarde of glorie is Ioyfull to hym: of theym that be gode.
So mayste thou se that the lawe of ma~ doth bodely the lawe of god doth spiritually that same almost is redde in the .vii. Chapitour of hester where it is said take a ma~ and hange hym on the Iebet by a man is vnderstande a synner whiche the heuenly kinge shall co~maunde to be hanged on the Iebet of hell if he fyn+de hym in mortall synne Fyftely synne dispoylethe man in this worlde from all goodnesse and grace And in the other worlde frome eternall Ioy so as it is written in the .xiiii. chapitour of {pro}uerbes synne maketh man pore and miserable for truely the synner ought well to be called pore whan he hath no thinge but hath lost him self by dedly synne and frome fredome is entred in to the seruytute of the deuyll yet ought the synner to be called more pore for he may no thinge wyne beynge in suche astate nor may do any workes meritorious or agreable to god finably may be called right pore for noon may yeue to hym any thi~g yt gode is for it shal pro+fite hym noo thinge to the helthe of soule for he hathe no lyfe but only in the body the soule is as ded. wherof Boice saith in his .iiii. boke of consolacion an euyll man is noon other wyse to be called but a dede man.
For man by synne is departed from the lyght of god derkely blyndide.
For as it is written in the sophologie in the firste chapitour They shall walke as blynde that haue synned agaynste god.
And as the psalmyste saith they haue not kno+wen ne sene the waye of their helth And therfore they walke in derkenes to this purpose saith saint Ierome The soule polluted by synne? is depryued and beaten downe to thende that he is not worthy or hathe power to beholde on highe And it is to be knowen that synne is as the rotennesse in an apple for as the putrifaccion taketh frome the apple the coloure and odoure? So dothe synne take frome man the odour of good renowne of Ioy? the colloure and beaute with the sauour of grace wherfore synne of good right? well may be called rotennesse of the whiche speketh Isaye in his .xv. chapitour saiynge he that doth synne ledeth a more foule life? then is the myere or any rotennes of therth.
And saint Augustyne saith recitith that it is a more swete odour to man to smell a nold styn+kinge roten dede dog: then is a synfull soule to god of this mater spekith saint augustine in a sermon the whiche he made and by hym was drawen.
what auayleth to the thy cofer full of wordly goodes yf thy conscience be voyde frome all good werkes dedis thou couetys to haue worldely goodes and thou wilt not be good thy self.
Arte thou not ashamed to haue thy house full of goodis: And thou replenisshed with so many euyllis.
Nowe answere me to this question what is it that thou woldeste haue euyle.
Firste thou woldest not haue a neuyle wyfe euill children nor euile seruau~t{is} nor yet euill gowne nor euyll hoseen.
And yet thou cursed her+ted in thy synne. woldest leade stylle a cursed lyfe.
Nowe pray the for thyne owne helthe: loue not more deerly thy hosen then thy self that is to say so as thou woldest not haue euile hose~ whiche is one of the semplest aparelmentis of thy body: wyll not thou to led an euile lyfe. for the good lyfe is oon of the fayrest apparell of the soule all the thingis that thou seest fayre and plesaunte: thou holdes theym and reputis theym as dere But and thou see well thy selfe: thou shall repute the as vile and stinking and thinke thou verily yf the gooddes wherwith thy house is fylled had power to speke they wolde crye against the saynge with an highe voyce thou woldest haue and possede vs after thy appetite wyll and we wolde haue a good true lorde. herken howe they crye against the in addressinge theyr desires to god.
true god creatour of the worl+de why hast thou yeue~ to this man so moche good and he is so euyle what maye it prouffite hym the greate goodes that he possesses.
whan he hath noo in hym the true loue of god. that alle hathe yeuen hym Sixtely it is to be noted that by synne man is be come a brute beest And therfore saithe Boice in his .iiii. boke of co~solacion man good Iuste and trewe: yf his wisdome and Iustice be lefte: he is no more man.
For as sone as he yeueth hym to synne: he is conuerted to a brute beest And the phe+losopher in his Ethiques saith That he is not oon+ly a beest but worse more detestable then a beest.
To the whiche accordith Dauid the prophete sayinge in this maner man duringe the tyme that he was in honour: and to god agreable: had no wyll to vnderstande his helthe but fell frome god wher+fore he is compared to brute bestis: and fowle and is made to theym semblable. for the .vii. and laste poynte it is to be noted that of synne is borne deuil+les seruitude. wherof writeth saint Iohn~ in his fir+ste Canonique in his thirde Chaptour: he that ma+keth or co~mytteth synne: is seruaunte to the deuill. wherfore all theis thingis considered: thou pore so+roufull and miserable synner haue mercy and pytie of thy soule. and haue noo wyll to put thy soule. in to synne: butte remembre howe by thy cursed synnes thou haste offended and wrathed thy lorde god.
¶And that thou haste reioyced thy greate enmye the deuylle. and doon damage to thyne neyboure.
¶Nowe thenne praye the pore synfull man knowe the noblenes of thy soule and howe greate and greuous hathe be the wou~des of her comytted by synne.
For the whiche of ne+cessite the sonne of god hathe suffered soo greuous passion.
For certaynly yf the woundes of thy soule had ben mortall: the sonne of god had neuer suffered deth for their remedy wyll not then to desoule and disprayse.
when thou seest knowest that his right highe mageste hathe had so moche pytye and compassion of his soule.
And saith it is soo that he hath shed tearis and weping{is} for the wasshe thou then thyne bed nightly with tearis of penau~ce co~+tricion.
He hathe shed his blode for the shede thou thy tearis for hym by contynuall penau~ce.
Behold not that that the flesshe wold but co~sider that whi+che the soule secheth demau~dith: For as saith sain+te Gregory for asmoche as the flesshe in this worl+de lyueth swetely in the delyt{is} pleasauntis therof whithin a shorte space of tyme after the lyfe corporall: the soule eternally shalbe tourmented. asmoche more as the flehe in this world shalbe chastised so moche more shall the soule haue Ioy and glory in the other worlde. ¶wherfore saithe saint Augustine lette vs leue and put behynde vs for the ho+noure of Ihesu criste: the thingis that be to be lefte that lettyth the helth of our soules to thende that for thing{is} transitorye: we lese not eternall and con+sider that if it were said to the take and vse at wyll the good{is} delit{is} of this worlde asmoche as shalle please the on that co~dicion: that after thy Iene shal+be taken frome the thou shalt all the remenau~t of thy lyf contyune in lang wishe hungre payne and myserie. certeinly am sure thou woldeste neuer thenne desyre suche temporall goodd{is}: Nowe con+sider and rise diligently thenne For all the course of the lyfe of man is not to compte one monethe or one daye or one houre of space or tyme: in regarde or comparison of the perpetuall curside paynes of hell that hath noon ende.
And to the whiche noon other paine is semblable nor hable to be co~pared.
Chapitour saithe that oure lorde wyllinge and admoneshinge the creature to doo penaunce: spekith in this maner He that takes not his crosse folowe me? is not worthy to haue me by this crosse we be taugh+te and geuen to vnderstond penau~ce the whi+che all synners ought to take and bere {per}seuerauntly yf he desyre in the beatitude eternalle to reigne with Ihesu criste For as saithe saint Ierome in a+pistole that he wrote to Susanne saynge thus penaunce is to the synner necessarie and ought to be so moche that it be sufficient for the cryme done against god or for the more meryte that the penaun+ce excede the synne And as saint Augustyne saythe who that wyll be saued it behoueth hym and is to hym necessarie: ofte to purge and wasshe his conciens with tearis frome al the filthes vnclennes where with he hathe poluted defilyde hym selfe frome the tyme of his baptisme: But perauenture thou that hast geuen and hadde all thy pleasure of the worlde: wyll say in this maner.
Thy sermond and the wordes that thou sayste to me in aduising me to do penaunce: me semeth verie harde For maye not dysprayse the worlde nother correcte ne chastyse my flesshe Alas poore synner herkyn the Doctrine not of me but of holy saint Ierome that saith in this maner.
It is inpossible that a ma~ may vse and Ioye the goodes of this present worlde he+re: in fyllynge his Belly and accompliss hynge his wyll and thought: And after this worlde thinkith to haue the delitis in the heuenly world for he can not haue his Ioye in this erthe here: and haue the greate glory in heuen.
The whiche sentence confermeth sancte Gregory saiyng thus: many there be that couite and desyre to flee frome the presente exile of this wolde in to the glory and Ioye of {per}adise: but yet wolde they not leue their worldly delitis the grace of our lorde Ihu~ calleth theim But the cursed concupiscence of this worlde reuoketh and with draweth theym ¶They wolde gladly dye as right wyse people doth: but they wold not lye as they do.
And therfore they shall euerlastingly perysshe and folowe theyr werkes in to holl{is} there to be in {per}durable dampnacion.
To this purpose speketh saint Barnarde to the synners that re+fuse penau~ce miserable syn~ers know co~syder in your hart{is} the lyfe strayte co~uersacio~ of glorious saint Iohn~ Baptiste whiche strayte lyfe conuer+sacion: is to all delicious synners not wyllynge to doo penaunce: the verie messenger of eternall deth Alas we pore miserable and vnresonable best{is} and wormes of therth: wherfore be we proude dispy+teous and displesau~t to do penaunce sith that we see that he that amonge al men was borne the mo+ste greate: hath wylled his holy body pure clene Innocent to chastice by penaunce And we desyre to clothe and anourne our synfull bodies with pre+cious clothinge And the good holy saint: had none other clothinge to his boody but the harde sharpe skynne of a Camyl we couete and desire to drinke delicious wynes: sainte Iohn~ the Baptiste that glorious frende of god dranke in the deserte noon other thinge but clene pure water beholde than miserable synner: Oughtest thou then flee doynge of penaunce folowe worldely pleasures: wys nay for certainly it is not the way to paradise and more to moue thyne herte to penaunce and to flee the delitis of this worlde: remembre the of the euil Riche man that was lord and maister of so great Riches and was dayly clothed with precious habitis of purpyll the whiche not withstandyng all the delitys that he hadde in this worlde: after his mortall lyf was passed: might not atteyne to haue in the necessyte of his brennynge heate one oonly drope of water for to refresshe and coole his tunge ¶Therfore remembre these thyng{is} dere frende do penaunce whyle thou hast tyme space trust not to moche of length of dayes For thoughe almi+ghty god haue {pro}miside {per}done and mercy to them that wyll do penaunce he hath not promisyd them certayne tyme to leue nor yet a daye houre ne mynute.
And if thou wylte knowe what is penaunce say vnto the it is wepyng teares of co~tricion for thy synnes passed with fyrme purpose neuer to co~+mytte them more For as saith saint Augustine the penaunce is vayne: whiche synne folowynge defi+lith.
And the wepyng no thinge profetith whenne they retourne agayne to syn~e.
Nor to aske {per}don of god: wyll to falle agayne to synne.
And for more declaracion thou ought to knowe note that ther be thre maners of penau~ce that is contricion with harte confession with mouthe and Satisfaccion with wark{is} For that thre maners we offend god that is to knowe.
The delectacion of thought by inprudence of wordes and by wark{is} of pride and for that that by the contrare it muste be curide: we muste make satisfaccion to god in thre other maners puttinge contricion againste the delectacion of synne confession againste inprude~ce of wordes Satisfaccion against the warkis of pride.
Nowe see thou firste what is contricion Contricion is a sorowe wilfully taken for syn~es co~mytted and done with full purpose to abstaine to make true confession dewe satisfaccio~ as saith saint Barnard the sorowe ought to be in iii. maners that is to say sharpe more sharpe and sharpest Right sharpe: for cause we haue offended oure souerayne lorde god creator of all thing{is}.
And more sharp: for we haue inpungued our celestiall fader that so swetly hath norisshed fedde vs And in that we so haue offen+ded him: we may be reputed wors then dogg{is} for the dogg{is} of their nature: louyth folowes them that norissheth fedith them.
Thirdly contricion ought to be moost harde and sharpe: For so moche that in co~mytting synne we offende god.
And crucifie tourment our redemer that hath bought vs with his propre blode: and delyuered vs from the bondes of synne hath deliuered vs frome the cru+elte of deuyll{is} and the paynes of hell wherfore we ought to haue sorowe and displeasu~ce of thre thingis.
¶That is to witte of syn~e co~mytted by good dedes lefte and tyme loste as spekith saint Augustyne saiynge contricion of harte is more worth: then all the pylgrimag{is} of the worlde in a clause made vpon the psalme Ad du~m cum tribularar.
It is saide god can not despyse ne withstande the repentaunce of a contrite harte: that with verie co~+tricion besechith his mercy And in lyke wyse saith saynt Iohn~ Crisistome Contricion is that oonly thinge that makith a soule to hate the fresshe habitis and maketh hym redy to loue sharpe clothinge of hear to loue tearis to hate and flee plesauntis and laughingis for there is noo thinge that so con+ioyneth and vnityth the soule to god: as the tearis of a penytente.
¶And to the contrarie saythe saint Augustyne we maye not yeue the deuyll mor+re sharpe sorowis: then to heale oure woundes of synne by confession and penaunce.
But alas howe be it that by penaunce and contricion we may gett so moche weale: And yet fewe folkis be that wolde do penaunce ¶wherfore thus oure lorde complaineth him spekinge by Ieremye there is no ma~ spekyth that good is: nor that wolde do penaunce for synne co~mytted and done.
The secounde that is to saye confession is laufull and sufficient occasion and declaracion of synners trespace byfore the preest: For this worde confession is as moche to saye as an hole shewinge or shewinge of alle to geder.
For he truely confessithe hym hoilly: that saithe all Confession also as saith Isodore in the boke of his ethimologies is that thinge by whiche the secreat sekenes of the soule vnder hope of pardone mercye is made open to the praysinge of god of the ver+tu of whiche saint Ambrose vpon the psalme beati inmaculati saith: the vengaunce of god seassith: yf mannys confession make hym selfe clene.
Confiteantur tibi populi deus saithe that god is not as Iuge But as an aduocate for them that by true confession condemneth and yeldith them selfe gilte: And pore leo saith that the synne abidith not to condempne man in iu+gement whiche by confession hathe bene purged.
And saint Augustyne in the boke of penaunce saith confession is the helthe of soule the mynyshere and consumer of synne restorer of vertues ¶And the withstander and ouercomer of the deuyll what more confession shett{is} the gates of hel And openith the gates of paradise And for theis forsaide causis right dere frende truste the cou~saile of Isaye.
Tell thyn iniquite so as thou maist be Iustified For the begynnynge of Iustice is co~fession of synne: wher+fore it behouith to confes the of all thy synnes holy of the whiche thou canste knowe any reme~brau~ce to one preest whiche hath power to assoyle the so that thou telle not {per}te of thy synnes to one preest: {per}te to an other.
For if thou shuldest co~fesse the after suche maner nother the oon preest ne the other my+ghte assoyle the for as saith saint Barnard he that deuidethe his confession to diuers co~fessours: hath no {per}done For it is detestable faynyng of hym that deuideth withholdeth his synne frome shewing the verray {pro}foundenes of his synne enteerly.
And they that makith suche co~fession receiueth exco~municacion for absolucion malidiccion for blessynge Sushe diuisions co~fessions is made by ypocrisie For they shewe their greate greuous synne to the prest{is} which they know not.
And to thyem that be of their familier knowlege: they shewe their most light synnes wherof saith saint Augustine as it is written in the decree He that deuideth his confessi+on is not to be praysed in noo condicion For he kepith counsaill frome the on that he sheweth to the other the whiche thinge he dooth by maner of ypocrisie to thentent to be praysed.
Nowe lette vs speke thenne of satisfaccion the whiche Saint Augustyne Diffynyth in this maner Satisfaccon is to withstande and leue the causis of synne: and not to fauoure his suggestions ne admonicions: saynt Gregorye saithe we make not satisfaccion by seassynge of synne: yf we leue not the voluptuous bylongeing therto.
And shewe wepinge and lamentacion vnfayned for oure synne to the whiche pur+pose saithe Crisostome suche as the offence afore ha+the been comysed: suche wyse ought agayne to folowe the reconsiliacion and satisfaccion.
And asmo+che to be inclyned to wepyngis and lamentacion as thou haste been inclyned to synne.
¶And to take as greate deuocion to penaunce: as thou haste hadde greate intente to commytte synne.
¶For thy greate and mighty synnes desyreth the greate lamentacions wherof saithe Eusebeus bysshoppe by lyghte contricion maye not be payde the deibte the whiche is due to the dethe eternall: For synne ne with lytell satisfaccion the fyre eternall that is made redde for the euyll may be quenched but many be soone wery in this mortall lyfe to doo penaunce and retourne frome the waye of satisfaccion lokynge bakwarde as dyde the wyfe of lothe: agaynste the whiche spekythe saynt Barnarde in a sermonde: and saithe he that perfectely felythe and perceuyth the peysaunt dedes of synne and the lesyon and sekenes of the soule: can not lyghtely fele perceyue the paynes of the body nor repute the laboures any thinge: by the whiche he may do a waye synnes passed withstand theym that be to co~me And as saint Augustine saith vpon the .xv. psalme many be that haue noo shame to co~mytte synne but they haue greate shame to doo penaunce vnbelefull creature and far oute of thy reason canste thou not haue shame and horrour of the great wou~des of synne: Seest thou not what foule stinke Rotennes is therin renne to the medicyne and do penaunce and saye my lord god my creature knowe myne Iniquite and soo clerly: that my synne is alwaye againste me to the oonly haue co~mytted synne whiche is oonly withouten synne Farthermore it is to be knowen that satisfaccion is in thre thinges that is to wytte in pray+er almes and in fasting.
To thende that the noum+bre of thre be opposite againste thre falce and deuely synnes prayer againste pryde Fastinge against concupiscence of the flesshe and almes against Co+uetous And for all thinge that is co~mytted againste god is ordened prayer And for the synne again+ste his neyghboure is ordeyned almes: and for the synne against hym selfe is ordeyned fastinge And for more declaracion of satisfaccion he fpekyth som+what of almes Almes is as moche to saye after the maner of spekinge: as co~maundemente of mercy.
And in this maner ought this worde to be written Elemosina by and some tyme they write Elimo+sina by then is it asmoche to saye as the co~maundemente of god For he hym selfe co~maunded it to be done with his owne propre mouthe: wherof saithe Ieremye yeue almes: and all thing{is} shalbe you pure clene Or thirdly Almes may be said af+ter sume the water of god for as water quencheth fyre of almes dede quencheth synne. wherfore it is to knowe that thre thing{is} principally ought to mo+ue vs to do and accomplisshe almes and werk{is} of mercy.
¶The fyrste is for mercy bieth agayn the gilte of synne for so moche as it is wirtten in the {pro}+uerbe in the .xvi. Chapitour by mercy vanite iniquitie is bought agayn And danyell resitith in his xiiii. chapitour speking of a woman that put in all the vessellis that she hadde a lytell quantite of oyle.
And a noon the oyle grewe i~ suche maner that she paide and pacified her creditours.
The vessellis of the woman betokeneth the poore people whiche we sholde call in to oure housis: For as saith Isaie in his .liii. chapitour lede and calle the poore to thy house and kepe theym: And with that thou haste: that is to saye distrybute parte of thy substau~ce to this pore vessels moche lyke to that saith Thobye yf thou haue lytell to yeue yet study to yeue and de+partith the pore wyllingly For then shall growe the oyle of mercye when by gracious meritis. the synfull soule hathe made satisfaccion to god for his synnes.
¶The secounde thinge that ought to meue vs to yeue almes is for it encreases and multiplyes the temporall goodes as saithe saint Gregory in his dialoge worldly substaunce be multiplied.
For so moche as they be destribute and yeuen to the poore. we haue example in the thirde booke of kinges in the xvi. chapitour of the widowe that fedde healy to whome almighty god multiplied booth brede and oyle wherby it is vnderderstande that more is to almous prouffitable to theym that fedeth the pore: then to the pore that receyueth it.
¶Thirdly wherfore we ought to doo almes and werkes of mercy is: for that that almous kepeth the almes yeuer of the houre of dethe and ledeth with clernes and Ioye his soule to the Realme of heuen.
And therfore saith saint Ambrose that mercy is the oonly helpe to theym that ben passed.
¶O what felyshyppe is it of almes to hym that dyeth leue not then so trewe and soo goode a seruaunte nor put suche an aduocate behinde thy bac+ke ne doo not as they that in their lyfe withholddeth their goodes by suche brennynge Couetous: that neuer with theyr propre handes departed almes to the pore For such be semblable to hym that for to see clerly his wayes berith his lyght behynde his backe but doo as is taught to the by Ecclesiasticus saye not to thy frende of thy soule that is to saye to Ihesu criste: or to the pore that shall aske the almes.
¶My frende goo and co~me agayne to morowe and thenne shall yeue the All be it that that thou mayste yeue hym. whanne he askyth it.
¶For it is to be knowen that the riche of whome the poore asketh almes: ought to consider thre thin+ges Firste who it is that asketh for god hym selfe loueth so moche the poore that all that is yeuen to theym in the honoure of hym: he repentis to hym selfe.
¶And for so moche as it is wrytten in the thirde Chapitour of saynt Mathewe alle that ye shall doo to any oon of the leest seruauntis: ye doo it to me god by the pore demaundeth almes of the Riche and the riche demaundeth of god the realme of heuen soo that the riche ought well to drede to refuse or deney his almous to the poore leest that almyghty god wyll deny his prayer and askynge of the Realme of heuen.
For it is written in the prouerbes in the .xxi. Chapitoure He that closeth his eers whanne he hereth the poore crye: the tyme shall co~me that he shalle crye and god shalle not here hym.
¶Secoundly the ryche shuld well consyder what thynge it is that god asketh when by his poore people he askethe almous Certaynly he asketh noo thynge of oures But god asketh his oonly owen wherfore he may welle be called vnkynde to god: whanne he denyeth to the poore his necessarye almous: whanne he hathe metys and drynkes with other goodes aboundauntely: the whiche thynges well consydered Dauid: where he saythe in paralipomynone in his .xxix.
¶Oo my god and my lorde alle thynge be thyne: and we haue noon other thyngis to yeue the but oonly that that we haue receyued and taken of thy hande.
¶For trewely oure lorde god asketh by the poore noo thynge: butte that is his: and apperteynethe to him: and not to haue yeuen butte oonly to leane it ¶And not oonly to yelde therfore the dowble or thirde parte: but as an vsuret wyll encreace it a hundreth tymes more· ¶O poore synner doo thenne after the saiynge of saint Augustyne yeue to god for vserie and thou shalte take an .C. tymes more and possede the lyfe eternall To moche thou arte vnkynde if thou wil not yeue to god.
For god to vsuri as thou woldest do to a Iew or a sarasyne.
And therfore consider all theis thyngis and derely praye the assemble to gether the pore and by theim make thy treasour in henen in doynge the werk{is} of mercy: and make not thy tresoures here in the Erth but the harte of a couetous man is as a pytte withoute a bothome.
The more it receyueth the more it wolde haue And yet it is neuer full And so saith Ecclesiasticus in the .vii. Chapitour.
The couetous man shall neuer be fulfylled with money for the herte alwaye folowith the treasour sorowe maye be saide to the+ym that in perlyous exile of this worlde makyth their treasoure and vppon that saith crisostome: as+semble thy substaunce in place and countrey: where shalbe thy dwellynge for he that makith his tre+soure but in the erth: shal noon haue in heue~ when he no thinge hath put there And beleue suerly that the thinge thou shall fynde there: is oonly the good thou haste yeuen to the poore.
The goodes be not a mannys whiche he may not guyde ne bere with hym Now vnderstand the fayre auctorite of saint Ambrose he saithe that noo thinge is of so great co~+mendacion towardes god as pity and charite the good doctor sayde haue beholde many bookes scriptures butte can not remember that haue founde of any man: that wyllingly hath excersised the workes of mercy and pytie and viliously dyed And pope leo saithe he yeueth and sendeth to god precious and encere fruytis: that neuer lectyth the pore departe frome hym dispurneid or sorowfull.
For the vertue of mercy is soo great that without that: alle the other maye not prouffite.
And howe be it that a man be true chaste sobyre garnisshed and adryched with many other vertues: yf he be not mercyful and piteous neuer shal he fynde mer+cy.
And this that haue sayde of vertues Almes and werkes of mercy conceruyng the pore people suffisyth And nowe we shall retourne to the purpose of the begynnynge of this Chapitour where it is sayde: he that takes not his crosse and co~myth after me: is not worthy to be with me. this crosse ought to be taken in the tyme of youthe and strenghte to the whiche purpose it is sayde in the secou~de chapitour of Ecclesiastice: remember the of thy ceator in the daies of thy youth For thenne it profityth a man moost: and moste pleasyth god In ly+ke wyse he saith son tary not to co~uerte the to god: and differre not frome daye to daye For his Ire shall co~me on the sodeinly.
And in the tyme of vengeaunce he shall distroye the But agaynst the helthefull counsayle of the wyse the deuill yeueth and promiseth to man enyl damnable hope of longe lyf saiyng thou arte yonge and shall lyue and thou mayste goo to confessyon and doo penaunce.
¶O thies poore synners howe they be deceyued that soo lyghtly beleueth in his deceytis: and in the false hoope of longe lyfe purposynge in their aige to currecte theym selfe and amende and thenne co~+meth soden deth and fynably rauyssheth and taketh them to dampnacion.
¶And for so moche as it is sayde in Ecclesiastico in the .xxix. chapitour That by the promission and hope of longe lyfe ma+ny be putte to perdicion.
Nowe is it then to note that suche deuilishe promise of longe lyfe and thinkynge to doo penaunce in age: is full euylle for it is agaynste right and reason And yet is it worse For it is also agaynste the synner hym selfe ¶And more euyll it is against the souerayne bou~+tie of god and that it is agaynste right and reason it apperith by thre ensamples the firste example is: that who that hadde .x. asses and shulde yeue the gretest burthen of charge to bere to the most feble: he shulde do agaynste reason and good Iustice.
¶And so wyll he that oonly wyll yeue to hym sel+fe in his aige the charge and burthen of the synnes that he hath co~mytted in his youth and strengthe for thenne he yeueth the burthen to the moost feble asse: that is to say to the debilitie of age For in age man hathe no strength ne vertue to bere labour or payne.
And they that so differre their penau~ce: deserueth malediccion of god as it is written in zaca+ria in the firste chapitour The man full of fraude is cursed that in his bestiall lyfe hathe doon many euyllis and makyth sacrifice to god of the worste and the moost poore amendemente.
¶And in lyke wyse is he cursed that in the delitis of this worlde passeth the tyme of his youthe and strength and differreth to make true sacrifice vnto almyghty god: tyll the tyme of feble and olde aige co~me vppon hym ¶And therfore sayth Isodore he that lyueth the conuenable tyme of penau~ce It shalbe to hym but as voyde thinge to co~me to the yate of god to praye.
¶The secounde example is that he that in hys strength and power is not hable to lyfte a ferdell in his youth: and whanne he commeth to feblenes of aige thenne wolde take vppon hym the charge: myght welbe reputed a verye foole.
¶So in lyke wyse is he that in his youthe whyles strength is in hym: woll not take vppon hym the dedes of penaunce whiche thenne maye be to him light.
And hopeth better to do them in his age whanne there shall be augmented in hym: greate debilite and feblenes he well maye be resembled to a fole. ¶wherof as it is sayde in the lyfe of faders that one went and kutte a fagotte of woode and thenne assayed to lyfte it and founde it to heuye.
¶And yet he wente to an other woode and putte in more and wolde haue lyfted it and founde it so moche more heuy to bere ¶In this manere doth the synners whan they take the char+ge of synnes and leueth to do penaunce from daye to day puttynge adioynynge synne vpon synne.
For as saith saynt Gregory the synnes that by penaunce is not purged taken away: of his nature desyrith and drawyth to hym other synnes.
¶The thyrde example is he that all his lyfe hathe hadde greate study and cure with worke men to prepayre and make an howse in the whiche he neuer hathe purpose ne hoope to inhabite ne dwelle ¶And the house whiche he desyreth to dwelle in wolde vtterly distroye to his power: It were a iuste cause to repute hym a defamed foole.
Nowe ought men then to knowe and vnderstande that so is it of the syn~er yt vnto the deth desireth to tour+ne hym to god and alwaye desireth and coueteth to lyue in the delytis and voluptuysnes of this sorowfull and myserable worlde: folowynge euyll companyes by the whiche he hathe greate occasions to commytte many deedly synnes by the mea+ne wherof: He all the tyme of his lyfe is makynge redy and prepayreth his house in helle where noo man shulde wyll to dwelle.
¶And therfore ought they to dred and doubte the sentence of sancte Paule who saithe he that gooth and dooth agaynste his consciens: he edifieth hym selfe an house and lodgynge in helle.
¶And for to shewe and proue that the promyse and hoope of longe lyfe is yet more euyll agaynste the synner.
¶It apperethe and is to vs clerly shewed by two examples.
¶wherof the firste is he that shulde desyre rather to be seke thenne hole and in seruitude rather then in lybertye: and to haue no thing leuer then to possesse his {per}te of al the good{is} of the world: he shuld be agaynste hym selfe In lyke condicion is the synner when he tarieth to do penau~ce For he loueth better to be in synne whiche is the spiritualle sekenes of soule.
De+sireth rather his dedly sykenes then his eternall ly+fe wherby it clerely apperith that of the obstinate syn~er it ought wel to be sayd that he is euyll again+ste hym selfe so that he loueth sekenes better thenne helthe and deth then lyfe seruitude then fredome euyll then gode As saithe saint Iohn~ in his canonique He that doth synne is in the seruitude of syn+ne And saint Augustyne saith that a man good iuste and trewe.
Not withstanding that he be in ser+uitude is in his bounte kepe alway free and in his fraunchies But the euyll synfull man not withsta~+dynge he reigne and be dred and honoured in this worlde he shall alwaye dwell in cursed seruitude and that worse thynge is to saye: as longe as he shall endure in the boundage of vices and synnes He shalbe in the boundage of euyll lordes and reu+lers.
The secounde example is this he that shulde owe a greate somme of money to a vsurer whiche shuld growe and be augmented from daye to day So that he shulde not be in power to paye it but wolde euer tary as longe as he might.
He shulde greatly doo agaynst hym selfe so to purpose asmoche more as the synfull man shall dwel in synne: so moche more shalle he be bounde to payne wherof it is written in the booke of apocalips in the .xvi. chapitour asmoche as the synner glorifieth hym in his delitis soo moche more he yeueth hym selfe to tourmente wepynge and payne.
¶Thyrdely the promyse of longe lyfe is ryght euylle and dau~gerous in so moche as it is agaynst the wyl of god as it the apperyth by .iii. examples the fyrste is yf it were that a yonge man were im+pungnynge and contrarye to his mayster: of the whiche he sholde haue alle his weall by the space of his lyfe.
¶And that he thenne lefte his propre lorde and mayster for to serue the Enmye of the same durynge the tyme of his strengthe and youthe.
¶And whanne he shulde comme at impotencie and be atteynted wyth aige and feblenes: thanne wolde retourne to his fyrste maister in offerynge hym his seruyce for the remmenaunte of his lyfe: suche a seruaunte myght well be reputed of euyll and vntrewe co~dicion and noo thynge to be thoughte agreable to the seruice of suche a man In this maner is it of the synner he offendeth god and seruyth his enmye the deuyll endurynge his strength and youthe and purposith to serue god in his feble aige.
¶The secounde example is yf there were any that hadde receyued of his lorde gerate gyftis and goodes wherby he myghte haue greate wyn+nynge and aduauntage: and yf he wolde dispende and waste theym for noughte: he myghte well be called a foole and vnkynde to his mayster the whyche thynge dooth the synner indirectely doynge agaynste the goodnes of god.
¶And in commyttynge synne dispendeth foleously and wastethe vnkyndely the goodes that hys creatoure hathe yeuen hym that is to knowe the soule the body the wytte by the whyche hys soule is enoblisshed the strenght and vertue of his body hys worldely goodis temporall the space of his lyfe and manye other fayre and greate yeftys and benyfictis that of god he hathe receyued saint Gregory spekynge of the soule: whiche god hathe gyuen vs as a precious tressoure to vse reasonably in doynge meritorious workes: by the whyche we maye gette the Realme of paradyse saythe in this manere Curses and sorowes be to me yf by my neclygence fayle to kepe the Treasoure and Iowell that the precious lambe vndefyled Cri+ste Ihesu hathe wylled full derely to bye agayne.
And for the tyme that god hathe geuen vs in this mortall lyfe as saith the saide saint Gregory: thou haste not in this worlde daye houre ne mynett ne space of tyme. wherof thou ne shalte yelde acco~mp+tis byfore god Howe in what operacions thou haste inployed thy tyme.
¶The thirde example is yf the seruauntis whiche haue the dispendinge of their lord{is} good{is} yeue to strangers and his Enmy+es the best brede and wynes and yeue and mynystre to his lorde the vitaylly that be corrupte rotten and stynkynge: He shulde doo vniustly and falsely agaynste the wyll of his master and ryght soo dooth the synner that alle the beste tyme of hys yeres that is to saye in his youthe geuyth hym self to the worlde and to the deuyll: whiche be the enmyes of Ihesu criste and purposeth to yeue to god the worste whiche is the olde ende of theyr lyfe: Alas dyde not thus whiche sayd my god my crea+toure my strength my beaute and my youthe: will oonly to thy seruice kepe and to this purpose it is sayde in ecclesiatic{is} geue not to god the rottennes and dregges of thyne aige butte presente vnto hym the free wyne pure and clene of thy florisshin+ge youthe Item saint Gregory spekythe of theym Also that deferre to doo penaunce and saythe the synner is to ferre straunge frome the faithe and lo+ue of god that for doynge of penaunce abideth the tyme of his age For he then hath not in his powre any tyme or houre of his lyfe wherfore and throughe the counsayle of Isodore euery power synner ought diligently with alle his myght whenne he maye retourne hym to god for who that doth not penaunce.
when he maye: when he wolde he shall not do it.
Doo then penaunce and tary not to thende that thou be not enclosed withoute heuen with the folisshe virginys.
[Figure: SAint Iohn~ in his firste canonique shewith vs that we ought not to lo+ue the worlde ne the thi~+gis that be in the worlde And saith in this ma+ner loue ye not the worl+de ne thyngis that be therin yf there be any that loueth the worlde the charite of god is not with hym.
Also the concupiscence of the world pas+seth and vanysshith awaye And saynt Augustyne treatinge vpon the same wordes demaundeth in this maner thou pore creatour whice woldest thou chese of thies two: wolde thou loue the worl+de and the temporall thing{is} passe the tyme with theim: or dispise the world and lyue eternaly with god yf thou loue the worlde: it wyll desceyue the for the world calleth and draweth swetely to him who that loueth and foloweth him but in their ne+de he fayleth theim maye not supporte ne socour them and certainly the world is as one excu~muni+cate for so as the exco~municate i~ the churche is not prayed for so oure lorde Ihu~ criste prayeth not for the worlde the whiche all tymes prayed for his {per}secutours and theym that crucified hym Alas to moche is he a fole that serueth suche a maister and hath such a lord that in thende chaseth kesteth out his seruaunte naked and pore and withoute hyre for so the worlde doth: we rede of the Saulden of Babilon the whiche beynge seke in the cytie of damasens of a mortall desease confessynge hym selfe of the shortn~es of his lyf and of nighnes of his deth piteously and in great lamentacions called to oon of his seruantis and sayde to hym in this manere Thou were wounte to bere in my batayllis the banner and the sygne of myne Armes by tryumphant victory Nowe a noon take and bere the sig+ne of my sorowfull deth that is to knowe this pore cloth and myserable shete and crye with an hy+ghe voyce by alle the Cytie thies wordes see the kynge of alle the orientall parties the whiche dyinge and fynysshynge his dayes bereth with hym noon of alle the richesses of this worlde but oonly this olde and poore clothe or shete And semblably we rede of a yonge prince kynge of loreyn beynge in infirmitie of sekenes consideryng his dayes we+re shorte and his deth nigh beholdynge his palac{is} houses and great edifiynges: cryed in castyng many sighes and pyteous teares.
my god my crea+tour Ihesus at this houre see and maye knowe that the worlde ought welle to be dispised.
¶Alas haue hadde in this worlde many sumptuous palacis: houses and lodges with greate Ri+ches and now knowe not whether to goo: nother eny creature that wylle take and receyue me this nyght in to his house Consider thies thynges poore and myserable synner and leue thy god and thy felicite that is to knowe this diceyuable worlde byfore that by hym: and of hym than be lefte in soo greate and myserable pouertye herken what Saynt Iamys saythe he that is frende of thys worlde: is Enmye of god.
¶And saynt Gregory saythe soo moche more as the man is nyghe the loue of the worlde: soo moche farther is he fro the loue of god for the whyche thynge manifestly oure Lorde Ihesu criste at the houre of his passyon wente oute of the Cytye of Iherusalem alle naked to be crusifyed and suffer dethe wyllynge to shewe that they oughte to flee the worlde his communitie yeuenge ensample that he that wolde folowe the fruyte and meryte of his passyon: ought to Issue out of the worl+de atte the leest by affeccyon in fleynge the worldly conuersacion and desyringe the spirituall.
¶And for so moche oure Lorde Ihesu criste spake to Ieremye sayenge flee and goo oute of Babilon to thende that euery parsone maye saue hys soule.
¶By babylon as sayth Saynt Iero~me is vnder+stonde the house of confusyon and that house repre+senteth the worlde where In all partyes reyneth confusyon as welle in the clarge as in the commu+ne people.
¶And in Relygyous as in seculars and in olde: as in yonge generally as well in men as in women in suche maner as saint Iohn~ sayth veritably and with good right All the worlde is euyll: and to all euyll it is obedient wherfore saynt Barnard counsayllynge to flee the worlde and vse a religious lyfe: saith on this wise flee oute frome the mid+des of Babilon that is to saye fro the worlde and saue your soules: fle to the Cite of resuge that to to the relygious lyfe: and there ye may for the euylles passed do penaunce and gette the Ioye Eternall. wherfore a basshe you not ne drede the hardenes or payne of doinge penaunce For the passions and affeccions of this presente worlde: be not worthy ne sufficient: for to perdon the euylles and synnes passed byfore ¶And therfore thinke of the rewarde that is promysed by doinge penau~ce in the house of god whiche is the heue~ly realme eternall And for more ample declaracion of this mater: it is to be noted that we ought to flee this fynfull miserable worlde for .iiii. causes Firste thou ough+test to consider that the wyse wyllyngly wold de+parte for the conseruynge and kepynge of their hel+the: placis corrupte with pestilence and principally yf they fele and perceyue sekenes of disposicion daungerous In this maner is the world for it is infecte with corrupte pestilence by thabboundaun+ce of synne And in so moche as synne is right contagious sekenes: Soo it is to be fled and left.
And also the company of wretched synnes For it is vnsure and vnholsome to them that be hole in all theyr membres: to folowe vse the company of them that be lepris and vnclene In lyke wyse it can not be thinge sure to man: that wyll be pure and clene: to folowe this synfulle worlde fulfylled with alle vices To the whiche purpose it is sayd in ecclesiastic{is} in the .xiii.
He that toucheth pitche in berynge therof: shall take so~me to wche of fowl+nes.
And he that is companyed with prowde: shal fynde some apparell or clothinge of pryde.
¶And to saye the trouth: It is a thynge Inpossible that he abide longe in good werkes that often frequen+teth with euyll parsones.
And for so moche saith the psalmyste with the hooly: thou shalte fynde the holy and with the euyll: thou shalt fynde the euyll and soo as euyll conuersacion is noysaunt and hur+tefull: right so is the good company good {pro}fytable for he that fyndethe good companye: fyndeth helthfull lyfe and haboundaunt in riches.
¶And for a true declaracion: beleue verayly that full seldome it is seen: butte a man beco~meth good or euyll: after the company where he is enterteyned ¶And as saith Saint Ierome the hartis of chyldren is as it were a cleane pure table: In the whiche noo thinge is paynted ¶wherfore it is a true lykenes: that the workes and co~dicions that they lerne in youth: be it goode or euyll: they wyll folowe in their aige ¶Thenne lette vs withdrawe frome this worlde: as frome an euyll neyghbour For in this worl+de is there not a worse neyghbour: nor that so moche maye annoy vs: as the affinite and affeccion of synnes wherwith this worlde is replenysshed.
¶Secoundly the wyse of their nature withdrawith departeh frome the plac{is} where they haue doubte to be trayed solde or delyuered to the handis of their Enmyes whiche the world doth from day to daye wherfore the wordes of Iudas that betrayed his maister: is propre to that purpose: whiche saide he that shalle kysse take and holde hym for he is that shulde delyuer you suche or resemblable wordes saithe the world to the deuyll For he that the worlde clippeth and kysseth and ly+ftith vppe in great honour: he betrayeth yeueth them into the handis of their greate Enmye the de+uyll. ¶wherfore thou oughtest well to note that in this worlde there is noo suertie ne trouth For as saithe saynt Ierome the moste greate and manifest signe of dampnacion: is to haue and folowe in this corporall lyfe the pleasures the sportis: and felicities therof and to be byloued of the worlde.
For he erreth and far goeth oute of the way of Iu+stice. that by riches and delitis enforsith hym to ple+ase the worlde.
¶Thyrdly the wyse withdrawith hym frome that place where he weneth there be {per}ell certainly soo is the worlde a place right {per}lious whiche is called a See as saithe the psalmyst the worlde is a great see spacious of the whi+che as saithe saint Barnarde the difficulte of passa+ge: and the multitude of passers proueth the daungier as in the see of marcell if there be .iiii. shyppes oon scarslye can passe withoute perell Soo is it of the See of this worlde of .iiii. soules one amonge them with payne co~meth to saluacion.
This worl+de is lyke the diluuie where fewe folk{is} be saued in respecte of them that perisshe.
It is as the fournes of Babilon enbraced with the fyre of hell wherfore aboue all thinge: man ought to drede and flee it For by the wynde of in a lytell worde: man is enbraced to the fyre of Ire And for the beholdyng of oon woman: is enbraced with the fyre of lechery and for the beholdynge of one precious Iuell: is en+braced with the fyre of couetous concupiscence.
¶Fourthly we see by experince that man gladly withdrawith and departith frome hym that desy+reth hym and principally frome his Capitall Enmye ¶And oure capitalle Emnyes the deuell prince of the worlde that nyght and daye manysseth oure deth frome whome withdrawe vs: when we forsake the whrld ¶And for so moche saith Ecclesiastic{is} in the .ix. chapitour holde the alway far frome a man that hathe power to slee the by the whiche man is vnderstande the deuyll that man is ouerco~me by as saithe saint Mathewe in his .xiiii. chapitour such thing{is} be doon by the euyll man vndersta~dyng the deuyl oure gostly Enmye.
For whiche cause aboue said: we ought to knowe vnderstonde that the souerayne remedy to ouercome the worlde is to flee and departe therwith And to this purpose we rede in the lyfe of faders yt saint Agryme beyng resu~dunt dwellyng i~ the palace of the Emperoure: made his Orison to god saynge lorde pray the addresse me in the way of helth in the whiche Orison makyng came to hym a voice: saiynge Agrym fle the world and the men therof: thou shalt be saued And a noon after the hooly man wente in to a deuoute Religion in the whiche place he prayed semblaby as he had don afore lorde addresse shewe to me the way of helth And agayne a voice answered hym agayne fle ouercome kepe silence rest the Thies be the rotes to fle synne by the fleynge: is ouercome the co~cupis+sence of the flesshe by kepynge silence: is ouercome pryde by rest seassinge the loue and desires of the world: couetise auaricie is ouercome.
Item Iso+dor she with vs i~ this maner to dispraise the world yf thou wilt lyue i~ rest: take away put from the all thing{is} that may noie: or take from the: thy gode purpose be co~me to the world as dede so ye worl+de to the nother care for the glory of the world mo+re then thou were deed dispraise i~ thy lyf: the thi~g{is} that thou maist not haue after thy deth of this ma+ter spekith saint Ierome in this wyse lyf of the worlde: not lyf but deth a lyfe false deceyuable a lyfe mixed and medled with disters lyfe shadowed with lyes nowe as a fresshe floure: a noon drye a lyfe fragile caduke lyf miserable: to the true lyfe contrary that the more he groweth: the more he mynyssheth the more he goeth forth: The nygher is the deth: lyfe full of snares.

¶I can not thinke butte they wolde condempne and haue in abhominacion: the temporall glory of the worlde seynge and considerynge the opynion of sainte Ierome that saithe: it is impossible that man in this worlde and in the other: shall appere glorious ¶For the secounde we ought to flee and leaue the glorye of the worlde: for it is right frayle and neuer assured ne conformed in stabilite But falce and defectiue as is che smoke or vapour and odour of the floure ¶The smoke is of that nature that the more it procedeth in higheth: so mo+che it mynyssheth of his puyssaunce and substaunce ¶In so moche that fynably in mountynge soo hyghe: it consumeth and vanisshith ¶The floure semblably whiche hathe greate odoure: and for a lytell shorte tyme in sauoure and colour noble and pleasaunte by a lytel wynde or haete of the sonne: it is deade dryed leasith bothe sauoure coloure odour So is the Ioy of this world as writeth Isaye in the .iiii.
Chapitour alle thinges that god hathe created in flesshe: is as the hey and alle the glorye of the flesshe is as the floures of the same: the hey be co~meth drye and leasyth his colour and floure soo is the glorye of the worlde vayne and infructuous lyght and transitory.
¶And soo be they that loueth the worlde as the hey sone drye and deed a noon as they become out of the erth ¶wherfore saith ecclesiastic{is} all tem+porall myghtis alle corporall lyfe is this daye duringe: and on the morowe ded and at an ende Be+holde where is nowe the glorye of kynge assurey: whiche behelde vnder his seignorie and dominacion: the nombre of .xxvi. prouinc{is} where is the glo+ry of kinge Alexaunder: that put all the erth vnder his subieccion and obeysaunce: so as it is written in the firste of machabeus where is nowe the glo+ry of all his empire or the realmes: that he put vnder his obeysau~ce where be the princ{is}: wriche had domynacion on the beest{is} of therth: be they not all passed: as well the pilgrymes as the hostes of alle sortes: what was their contynuau~ce: but shortely goon and sodenly departed in the space of one day ¶They haue in vanitye passed theyr dayes: and their yeres: in a shorte season and lyke wyse in vanitie they be departed vanyshed and noon is aby+ding for it is comon to all thing creat to dye deth is of suche condicion: that it beholdeth neyther honour: ne Riches but is so cruell that it spareth none his course: and lawe by alle the worlde is so comon: and egall: that it sparith no more the Emperour kynge or great astate: than it doth the moost caytefe or power creature for not withstandynge that the riche and mighty is norisshed in this worl+de with dilicious metis: folowinge his voluptuous pleasures: by the which his soule is defouled: i~ thende he shall bere no more with hym thenne the moste pore.
¶Thirdly the glory of the worlde is to be fleed for it is right falce and deceyuable and holdeth to noon his promise not withstandyn+ge that it maye not yeue any man one moment or space of tyme yet it promiseth man suertie of lyfe beholde who maye compare with kynge Alexander and with the glorye that he had in the worlde he lost neuer batayll: but often ouercome gret mul+titude of his Enmyes: he beseged neuer Cytie but he wan it there was no prouince but he subdued it to his domynacion yet not withstanding all his might at the hour that he had went to haue ruled and gouerned all the world in peace: by a lytell ve+nom he was constrayned to dye so departe and leue all that worldly glorye wherfore man doest thou folowe the Ioye of this worlde that in thende maye not socoure the of the whiche saith Petir blesense in a pistell the falce deceiuable glory of the the worlde: abuseth and deceyueth his louers For what so euer he promisith for the tyme to co~me: or what so euer he pretendeth for the tyme present: is thynge of nought soden passable as water Ryn+nynge Fourthly the glory of the world is to be dispised and fled for it is right cursed and of euyll re+tribucion it ledeth a man to no Ioy but to all payne confusion of the whiche thinge speketh Osey in the .iiii. chapitour saiynge the Ioye of the worl+de shalle tourne to blame and confusion: the puyssaunce in to debilitie the wysdome in to folye the loue and delectacion: in to tribulacion and payne for by Iuste mesure quantite for the gylt shall be in the ende payne equiuolant wherof saynt Ierome spekyth in this maner to theym that loueth the glory of the worlde: sorowe and mysery be to you that wyll haste to goo to the Ioye of heuen: by the waye of youre Richesse For it is a lyghter thynge for a Camell to passe the hole of a nedyll yee: then a riche man to entre to the Realme of heuen And for more greate probacion he saythe note not my wordes: but the wordes of Ihesu criste that saith the heuen and the erth shalle passe and take ende: but my wordes shall euer be true: ferme: stable Therfore wake and wepe ye miserable synners vnstablisshed with the wynde of inconstaunt fortune that confou~deth and dispiseth other ye be der+ked and blynded with good{is} of vanitie: and with digniteis: that ye haue frauddently and malyciou+sly: gotten in the worlde The terme of youre lyfe shalbe peraue~ture this night: kytt and broke~ your soule in hell without ende and withoute terme: in the intollerable and miserable tourment{is} for as ye haue not been with the good men continuall helpyng in labour ne suffered them to lyue by their la+bour but of your might hathe diffouled and extorted them: so shall ye not only be intourment wyth men: but perpetually with all the deuylles in hell and so moche more as ye haue hadde Ioye glad+nes: so moche more in hell shall be prepared youre greue and payne and more shall saye you our sa+uiour and redemer Ihu~ criste chase in this world xii. Appostell{is} of the whiche there was of noble ly+nage but only one whiche was saint Barthelmewe and one riche: that was Mathewe and al the other were pore fisshers leuynge in payne and tra+uell of their body.
¶Nowe sith it so is: that god is iuste and true: and all thingis procedinge of his mouth is pure trouth: veraily thinke with gret payne amonge alle the nobles and Riche of this worlde oon might be founde co~uenable and worthy to helthfull election but enough maye be founde: that be propre and conuenable to the seruice of dampnacion.
¶And for a lytell whyle beyng in hell they shall receyue their salarie And if by adue~ture: any derke or blynded frome the true lyghte: wolde haue meruayll and question of this wordes: shulde answere in this maner whether we beleue that for one deadly synne a ma~ shall be dam+nyed: yf he dye therin is to be answered so it is. ¶wherby it is to be concluded that thies thingis considered amonge an hundred thousande wyth peyne one vnneth maye be saued An other question is this what is the riche with all his delyt{is} and pleasures Truly noon other thinge: butte a vessell+ful of synne replete with pride lechery couetous pryncipally to the riche mighty noble: reignyth many tyme alle synne and malidiccions.

¶They take it to theym selfe: to their Ruen and dampnable confusion Butte alas they se the pore me~bres of Ihesu criste naked and dispurueyd: dyeng for hungre and thurste: therfore they forse not but alwaye put their Tresoure frome the poore that is to witte: the superfluyte and superaboundaunce of their Richesses in sumptuous edyfienge of greate palacis that maye be pleasure to the sight of mortall men to beholde: pre+payringe greate diuers: the Riche: to the riche: fur+nisshynge their disshes full of dyuersse meatis and fyllyng their belleis: and their caren bodyes: with the delytis of the worlde hauynge noo pytye mercy nor compassion: of the pore that they see dye for hungre.
¶O miserable creature what other thyngis is it thenne synne: suche a dampnable lyfe consyder thenne that as sone as the belly is fylled with haboundaunce of meatis: the falce dampnable lechery is presente atte the yate to drawe the to eternall dethe what woldes thou that sayde more of suche folkis that in the honour and riches of this world: thus passeth thyer dayes Certaynly alle the tunges of mortalle men: cane not saye nor determyn the enorme euylles and synnes they commytte For they be thynke theim not of god: ne of the deth but yf it be by aduenture in theyr slepe: slepynge or dremynge.

whiche be thousande thousandes and innumerable thousand{is} that hathe fruicion and Ioye: with one hole blessednes in suche co~dicion: that eueryche of them takyth delectacion as moche in the weale of

¶And furthermore they enioye theim in the vision of god the whiche aboue them selfe they shall loue For the whiche thinge it is to be considered that syth it is so that the blessed shall be fulfylled with suche filicite and Ioye: the poore myserable dampned synners: shalbe on the contra+rye parte tourmented with innumerable paynes For soo as mercy strength beautye lyghtnes fredome of wyll shalbe to the right wyse people.
So by the contrarye: shalbe to the synners stynkynge drede langoure sorowe and tourmentis with all maner of paynes for the perpetuall Ioye that the rightwyse shall haue shallbe to the synners intermynable payne and tourmente.
¶And for to speke of the sapience of the rightwyse It is to be vnderstand that theyr knowlege: shalbe to theyr augmentacion of Ioye honoure and exultacion.
And to the synners: theyr knowlege shall be: werynges confusion diminission and lamentacion And of the amitie with the whiche the rightwyse be to geder bounde: yf any porcion of Amitie be in the dampned.
It shall be to the Augmentacion of their tourmente For as moche more as oon hathe loued an other in vnlefull loue: The more shall be their sorowe tourmente and payne for they shall haue discorde with all cretures and alle shall discorde with theim For all difourmitie and calamitie: shalle folowe them shalbe yeuen to them suche malediction: that the thynge whiche they de+syre they shall not haue: and alle that they wolde not haue: they shall haue And so in steade of good thy shall obtayne perpetuall shame and inestimable dyspisinge by the whiche they shalbe withouten ende: closed and depryued frome all Ioye and filicite And as the frendes of god their souerayne creatour: shalbe fermely assured: neuer to lese the goodis and glory eternall: So the myserable and dampned senners shall euer be in desperacion for so moche: as they shall knowe euer to de{per}te frome the payne sorowe tourment {per}durable so as the good shalbe reco~pensed with Ioye: the euyll shall haue for their heritage: sorow inestimable like as saith the good doctor anselme all they that by concupiscens of the flesshe passeth theyr dayes in this worlde: haue with theym in co~pany all the deuill{is} of hell And saint Augustine saith to this purpose god shall make glad comforte enioy: all the felin+gis witt{is} of the blessed people by a spirituall dile+ctacion For he is thobiect of all wit{is} our lord shall also be a glasse vnto their sighte an harpe of swetnes to their hering hunny to their tastinge Bawme to their smellyng and a floure to their touchinge And for so moche god was made man: to then+de that man shulde holy be blessed in hym: soo that thinwarde vnderstanstynge be in the contemplacion of his humanitie breuely to speke after the saiynge of saint Augustyne saint Gregory in the glorye of heuen there is so greate beaute with Iu+stice so moche Ioye with eternall lyght: that yf it were laufull and possible to abyde and lyue there but oonly the space of one daye.
For that: the innumerable dayes of this lyfe full of worldly pleasures and aboundaunce of tem{per}all good{is}: ought of very right: to be dispised For it was not spoken of a lytell vntrewe effecte of dauid: saiynge on this wyse Oon daye to abide in thy dwellynge place good lorde: is moche better then a thousa~de in this miserable lyfe wherof speketh Saint Barnarde who in thys lyfe maye thynke or conceyue in his mynde: howe greate felicite and pleasure the blessyd saint{is} haue in heuen Firste to se almyghty god to lyue with almyghty god to be with almyghty god whiche doth operacion in all thynges and is aboue all thing{is} to haue god: whiche is alle good And where so euer is all goodnes: there is mooste Ioye and myrth there is also verey lybertie perfecte charitie and euerlastinge felawship and suertie to the same agreith saint Augustine: saiyng in this maner Ioye aboue all Ioyes: to see god: whyche made man whiche saued man whiche glorifi+ed man indued hym: with the vision of his most holy face whiche is the moost highe goodnes the Ioye of Angell{is} and of all saint{is} Saint Gregorye askith this question is not god of soo inestimable fayrenes: that the Angell{is} whiche be seuen tymes brighter then the sonne doth desire to loke vppon his moost holy face: and to hym minister besily in great company Also saint Augusten of the Ioyes of heuen spekith on this maner In heue~ is no maner of malice there is noo maner of mysery of the flesshe there is nother wyll: nother power to syn~e or do a mysse but all Ioye and gladnes all creatu+res saued: shall haue in possession those same Ioyes felawshipped with aungell{is} ¶O pore soule nowe thou haste harde howe great the Ioyes of rightwyse people howe great gladnes howe gre+at clerenes and howe greate myrth: is the heue~+ly Cytye blessed myrth howe mery felicitye is it: to see the saynt{is} and to haue god euerlastyng+ly yf we shulde dayly suffre payne tourmentrye though it were as greate as the paynes of hell: so that it might haue an ende to thentent that at the laste we myght see almghty god in his glory and to be fellawshipped with his sayntis: were it not worthy and proffitable that we shuld suffer theim And in conclusion to be parte takers of euerlastyn+ge Ioyes truly wherfore good soule let vs desyre of almghty god that grace: to flee frome the company of them that desireth inordinat pleasures of worldly thing{is}.
And soo vtterly puttynge awaye the grugeyng{is} of vnlaufull thought{is}: frome the secrete place of our hart{is}: and desyringe inwardely the loue of the heuenly company: we maye tourne vnto the celestiall Cytie wherof we be written decreed to the Cytezens parte takers lyke vnto saintis: and the householde seruauntis of god and right inheritours of criste after this present lyf to come be with hym in eruerlastyng Ioye peradue~ture some wyll aske this question howe this might be done: by what manere of meanes To this it is answered on this wise Euery thinge to be done is in the free wyll of hym that shall doo it So it is in our free wyll: whether we wyll desyre to haue the kyngdome of heuen or not yf thou wyll aske what is the price of the kyngdom of heuen truly noon other but thy self gyue thy self to it by good wark{is} in this worlde without doubte thou shalte haue it Criste gaue hym selfe to suffre passion to thentent that thou shuldest be parte taker of the kyngdome of heuen geue thy self to him and thou shalt haue his kyngdome.

The open payne of theym that be repreued of god dooth not frustrate nother hurte the blesse of theym that be saued For why: there shalbe noo compassion of misery and the Ioy of those blessed soules maye in noo wyse be made lesse ¶And all though: those blessed soules be merciful of their na+ture: neuerthelesse they be soo Ioyned to gether in so greate rightwysnes: that in no wyse they may be mooued to be dampned soules with any compassyon or pytye And more ouer it is added: that then the misery of theyr childer of theyr fader and moder and of their wyues: shall not make the bles+syd soules to be sorye the dampned spretys byfore the daye of Iugemente shall see the blessed creatures not in that maner wyse to knowe their Ioye what it is: but only they shall knowe theym to be in a Ioye vnhable to be tolde And by that syght: they shall sore be crucified greatly Inuyinge: the greate felecitie of blessyd soules by the sight of the godhede of the whiche sight: the dampned spretis shalbe depriued and their payne shalbe in no wyse minisshed but in created bycause they shall haue in mynde the Ioye of the blessed creatures whiche Ioye they dyd see in the Iugemente or byfore the Iugemente and that shall be to theym greate tourmentry and payne And moreouer they shalbe scorged: in that they shall see theim selfe: to be repu+ted and taken as vnworthy: to see to Ioye whyche the holy saint{is} doth see contynually question maye be asked whether the dampned soules may se and knowe what is done in this wolde to this Saynt Gregory treatinge vpon this text of Iobe the .ix. chapitour.
¶They doo vnderstande whether their children be noble or vnnoble: say the oon this manere they that be alyue in this worlde knowe not where the soules be of theym that be deade so lyke wyse: they that be deade knowe not the disposicion of theym: whiche be lefte on therth For the lyfe of the soule is farre frome the lyfe of the flesshe Neuerthelesse it is to be knowen: that they whiche haue the inwarde knoleyge of the cle+renesse of god: maye in noo wyse be ignorante of outwarde effectis or dedis ¶And for this cause it is to be thought that the good people in heuen: doth see what is done amongis erthely creatures in the worlde ¶And not the dampned people per chaunce thou wyll saye the Ioye of the soules that be saued: is a greate waye forther frome the soules that be dampned: then the acetis and dedes of the worlde wherfore they myght see soner the dedis of the worlde: then the Ioyes of blessid soules It is answered oon this wyse that those thingis whiche be done in the worlde: maye not greue or vexe the dampned soules noo thynge so moche yf they might se them: as the beholdynge of the Ioye that the blessed soules be in.
¶Therfor they be not shewed to theym visebly Theyse be the suffraunce of god suche thing{is} that maye incresse moost their sorowe but noo thynge that shulde be to theyr Ioye or comforte So~me {per}+auenture wolde aske thys questyon whether the dampned soules in helle: wolde that euery creature shulde be dampned as they be.
To this maye be answered that lyke as perfyght charite is conuenient and accordynge euer to be with the holy soules: So amonges the dampned soules: shall euer be {per}fyght hate enuie then thus The holy blessed soules shall euer Ioye in all good dedes: on the contrary: the dampned shalbe sory for euery good dede The consideringe of the Ioye felicite of saint{is}: is to theim great affeccion Therfore they wold all good peple shuld be da~pned The enuy of them shalbe so great: that beinge in eternall payne they shall Inuye the Ioye of theyr naybours that be saued and of them with whom they haue ben conuersaunte in this worlde questyon myght be moued whether the dampned soules wolde ha+ue their naybours acquayntau~ce dampned with theym aswell as alle other: It maye be answered thus that they be not so enuyous to their acquayn+taunce or naibours: with whome they haue commytted and vsyd sensuall pleasures and delyghtis in the worlde: as they be to all other wyllynge to haue them dampned as they be for this cause.
If their companyons shulde be dampned as they be: theyr tribulacion shulde be encreased accidentally in so moche as they that be dampned: were parte takers with their acquayntaunce of theyr pleasures and vicious concupiscence of their pleasures and vicious concupiscence in the worlde: they must of equitie be parte takers of their payne And so shuld they not only suffre sorowe for theyr owne gilt: but also for the gylte of their fellowes and acquayntaunce An example is put of the dam+pned riche man whiche beynge in payne eternall desyred that his brethern a lyfe: might haue know+leige what payne he endured to thentent they my+ghte haue grace: to saue theym selfe for if they shul+de be dampned with hym: whiche was the cause of their misdoynge in this worlde: his payne shulde be increased For he shuld suffre with theim {per}te of their payne And though by the multitude of the dampned soules the payne of iche oon of theim sin+gularie is increased: yet their enuie and hatered is so greate: that they couyt more to suffre tribulacion and tourmentrie with a great multitude: then with one alone For it is a comon saiynge wretches be glade and desirous to haue fellawshyp in payne Aquestion might be mooued whether they that be dede: namely that be dampned: may know or haue any remembraunce of those thyngys that they had knowlege of: in the world.
To this may be saide that in the dampned soules shalbe a consy+deracion of thing{is} whiche they dyd knowe before And that knowlege or considerasion: shalbe as amateriall cause of their sorowe And no thinge of loue nor co~forte They shall also co~sider the synnes that they haue co~mytted wherfore they be dampned they shall haue in remembraunce the good dedes: whiche they might haue done: and wolde not And for both: they shall suffre payne Farthermore in hell shalbe two diuerse paynes oon is called pena Da~ni whiche is the wantinge of the syghte of god: the other is called pena sensus: whiche crist touchith in a gospell of mathewe the .vii. Chaptour: saiyng euery tree that bearith no good feuyte: shalbe cutte downe and caste in to the fyre Of the paine whiche is called pena sensus: spekith saint Gregory vppon the gospell of mathewe the .viii.
Ehapitour The dampned soule shalbe caste oute into the outwarde derkenesse.
This sayd pena sensus hath many diuersiteis of kyndes as thinke innumerable su~me of them be shewed and spoken of in this wyse In hell shalbe colde vnhable to be ouercomyn Fyre neuer to be quenched wormes that be mmortall intollerable stynke der+kenes palpable Scorges of deuyllis the horryble sight of deuell{is} the confusion of synnes and dispay+re of all goodnes The dampned soules shalbe full of euery sorowe and heuynes They shall also haue contynuall wepynge in their Iyes gnastynge in their teeth stynke in their nose thirles wailyng and criyngis in their voices ferefulnes in their ea+res Bandes vpon their handes and feet And a co~+tynuall fyre and heate: in all their membres wher+of a certayne doctour spekith on this maner hell is a deadly diche or pytte: heaptd full of all paynes wretchednes And as it is written in the .xiii. chapitour of ysaye euery dampned soule shalbe feared of other Their facis and countenaunce shalbe flamynge as fyre It is written in the .ii. chapitour of Baruch yt their facis shalbe blacke of the smoke and accordynge to the same: it is spoken in the .ii. chapitour of Iohell All the facis of synners shalbe tourned as blacke as a potte Also the sharpnes of the paynes of hell maye be consideryd by the wepynge and gnastyng of teeth by the desire of deth By the eatinge of their tunges and by the blasphe+mynge of their maker with many other that be there to co~me: As it is open in many placis of scrip+ture wherof it is written in the appocalippes the xix. chapitour on this wyse For the greate and intollerable sorowe: they dyd eate their owne tung{is} and blasphemed god of heuen: for theyr woundes and tribulacions The sharnes of their payne shal+be so great: that they shall dispise lyfe whiche is na+turally desyred of euery creature: desireth deeth that euery creature naturally doth flee ¶As it is written in the appocalippis the .ix. chapitour In thoo fearefull dayes and atte that fearefull tyme: men shall seke deth: whiche they shalle not fynde they shalle desire to dye: and deeth shall flee frome them saint Crisostome saith on this maner what shall we doo there what shall we answere where no thynge is but gnastynge of teeth howlynge And wepynge noo helpe to be goten to late to do penau~ce On euery syde in euery {per}te vexed incessauntly with paynes intollerable And neuer to ha+ue any parte of solace.
¶There shall no creature appere byfore oure Iyen: but only the mynesters and tourmentours of hell to minester paynes in euery syde and that worste is of all: there shalbe no comfore of the ayre nother of sight good lorde what feare shall be to theym that shall suffre theis paynes what breakyng of bowell{is} what crushin+ge of membres what howe many dyuerse cruci+fiyngis shalbe in euery sensible parte of body and soule: truly no creature maye expresse by any mea+ne Saint Crisostome spekynge of the losse of the sight of gode whiche is called pena da~ni saith these wordes perauenture su~me and many folke doo thinke no payne to greate of theis forsaid paynes: yf they might escape the daunger of hell but call moche more greuous paynes than hell: to be remo+uyd excluded and cast oute: from the grace of god frome alle goodnes prepared and made redy for good and holy people And moost of all: the priuacion and lakke of the sight of god to be hated of cri+ste and to her of hym this ferefull worde: knowe you not For sothe it is better a thousande tymes: to suffer lightnynge thenne to see that blessed lorde full of mekenes and pyty againste vs as our aduersarye And to suffer the Iyen of all tranquillite and reste to beholde vs. ¶O meke sonne of god: we beseche the lette vs not suffre theys paynes nother haue in experience: the intollerable and horrible tourmentrie woo shall to vs that thynke not nother haue any remembraunce of theis foresayde paynes ¶For we doo nowe as men that by necligence: and thinkith theym selfe sure: takyn+ge noo hede of bodye nor soule But gooth wythoute lette: in to the sayde paynes of helle perauenture su~me man wyll saye that it semethe god to be vnrightwyse for man is punysshed eternally for one deadly synne done in one houre Saynt Gregorye askith the sayde question: and geuyth solucion to it on this manere Almyghty god whiche is a streyghte Iuge: dooth not consider the wordes of men oonly: but also he payseth the hertys.
And so it is: that yf the wykked people myght lyue in this worlde euer: they wolde perseuerantly contynue in their wyckydnes and neuer amende them selfe For truly they that neuer wylle leaue synne: shewyth and desyryth alwaye to lyue in synne.
¶Therfore it longyth to the greate rightwysnes of god: to punysshe them by eternall payne: whiche in this lyf wold neuer be out of synne ¶And that noone ende of payne be geuen to the synfull creature: that whilis he lyued in this worl+de: wolde haue noone ende of synne.
¶And other reason why that oon deadly synne byndith a man to eternalle payne maye be taken: consyderynge hym to whome the offence is done whyche is the god of all goodnes and myght.
¶Therfore the offence done: is worthy eternall payne For as aristotill saith i~ the .vii. of his ethic In howe moche the {per}sone is greater indignitie to whome the offence or trespace is done: so moche more it ought to be punysshed and Crisostome ac+cordinge to the same saith An Iniure or wronge done to a persone: is to be considered as the persone is lytell offence done to a great persone indig+nite: is great And great cryme co~mytted to a symple bodye: is compted but as a lytell faulte my dere and welbeloued frende: knowynge and oft remembrynge in thyne harte theis paynes byfore rehersed besely take hede see: for the helth of thyn owne soule And euer beholde inwardly the grea+te paynes of hell to be beleued Consider in thy self what thing{is} be profitable and holsome to thy soule whether it is better to wayle to be sorye and of+ten to aske mercy for thy syn~es in this world: than to wepe in euerlastynge fyre without remedye or profite thou shall deserue i~ short tyme of this worl+de: yf thou wyll by penaunce and sorowe for thy synnes: forgeuenes euerlastyng comforte.
Ther+fore be sory for thy syn~es here in this lytell tyme: to thentente thou may hereafter be deliued forme the sorowe euerlastynge Meke thy selfe in this worl+de: that peraduenture thou be not made meke in the paynes of hell and be caste in to the fyre vnhable to be quenched Blessyd is that creature that in this worlde hatyth and makyth hym selfe redy to be fou~de hable at the daye of Iugement: with the people that be worthy to be saued And wretched is that creature whiche by his synne hathe made hym selfe vnhable to haue the glorye of oure lorde At the houre of the daye of Iugemente by the power of god: the clowdes shall take vppe to heuen: body and soule of theym that be saued And the deuellis shalle take bodye and soule of the dampned creatures: Castynge them in to the fornase the of brennynge fyre of hell.

the answer of his excellency the earle of to a declaration of the lord fairefax

when received notice lately of a declaration dated the eight of this moneth made by the lord fairefax intitling himselfe untruely and contrary to his own conscience lord generall for all the northerne forces for king and parliament could not choose but wonder either at the strength of his imagination to fancy such a government to himselfe in his majesties dominions without his royall assent especially knowing himselfe to be proclaimed a rebell for such trayterous courses or rather at his deep subtilty under the pleasant bait of his majesties pretended

authority to hide the cursed hooke of perjury and rebellion and by the sight of this counterfeit flagge to seduce his majesties good subjects contrary to their oaths of allegiance and late protestation from their bounden obedience to detestable faction and treason or howsoever presumptuously to profane his royall name to the raising and fomenting an unnaturall warre in the bowels of his owne kingdome directly against his sacred person crown and dignity
without a commission under his majesties broad seale he may be as he is indeed an usurper and latruder into power for which he and all his adherents are obnoxious to his majesty and the law in the high crime of rebellion but cannot justly nor with any colour of reason stile himselfe generall to the king and parliament
the very counterfeiting of this power without the true owner leave and against his expresse command doth evidently shew that he knows he can have no military power without his majesty much lesse against his majesty
as it is the hearty desire and prayer of all true englishmen that they may speedily see a blessed conjunction of king and parliament so we

cannot but take notice that they who joyne them together in their titles and pretenses are they and onely they that divide them and sever them in their actions and retard our hopes of an happy union partly by thrusting us into reall mischiefs for fear of fictitious and imaginary dangers and partly by opposing a sound and satisfying accommodation
but perhaps it will be said though he make bold with the king yet he derives a good authority from the parliament
when the two houses are legally assembled in a place free from tumults whither all the members may repaire with safety and vote freely without prejudice feare or faction then they are venerable assemblies but at the best neither have nor ever had without his majesties concurrence a power to raise arms or create generalls or order the militia of the kingdom
england did never see such an example such a president never heard of such a challenge of military supremacy made by the two houses without the king either in cases ordinary or extraordinary before the beginning of these pernicious distractions
all the orders of this kingdome assembled in parliament upon mature

deliberation in a case extraordinary sitting the parliament have disclaimed this power and plainly acknowledged that it is an essentiall and inseparable flower of the crown that it belongs solely to his majesty to defend force of armour at all times when it shall please him and to punish them that shall doe contrary and that the prelates earles barons commonalty are bound to aide him as their soveraigne lord at all seasons when need shall be

where the very title is so apparently untrue supposititious what truth can be expected in the body of the writing the first subject of his declaration are the prisoners taken at seacroft
surely he had great reason to have expressed himselfe more forward for the redemption of those poore seduced persons then hitherto he hath done who without any authority on his part or obligation on their part did hazard both their bodyes and soules meerly to do him service
he pleads for them that

they had quarter promised them that contrary to the rules of christianity charity the laws of this land and the law of arms they have been deteined in durance
it is true they had

quarter given them not out of any favour to their rebellious courses but out of pitty to their persons and their misled seduced simplicity in hope that when their eyes were opened they would returne to their former loyalty but never heard that they had any quarter promised or that there was any treaty held or any covenants proposed or condiscended unto but a free and absolute submission of themselves
so the sole and single ground of this invective declamation hath no more truth in it then the title
we are now told of christian charity but where was the consideration of this christian charity when the accord made at rothwell with his own consent was perfidiously broken the observation whereof had saved the effusion of so much christian blood and prevented so many murthers robberies imprisonments of his majesties loyall subjects onely for keeping their faith and allegiance unstained and their oathes inviolated
these men desire to be objects of christian charity not subjects they would have this grace looke towards them but not from them or otherwise they would be ashamed to ruine so many thousands of their neighbours

and fellow subjects and yet talke of christian charity as if it were a topicall argument not a theologicall virtue
his next stalking horse is the law of the land
would gladly know where that law is written which allowes any liberty or privilege to a subject who is taken in actuall rebellion against his lawfull soveraigne
if he and his adherents have no favour but what the laws of this land do afford them they must expect releife in another world upon their repentance
neither will the law of arms help him
it is a confessed truth that there is no law of arms but onely between such as have a power of arms lawfully invested in them
the law of nations doth except a subject from pleading the law of arms against his prince or against any authority derived from his prince
but he saith further

they have been deteined in such durance and under such tyranny as there is about an of them dead and about of them made so sick and weake as they are not likely to recover and to the rest of them all necessary refreshments are denyed with intention to reduce them also to the like wretched state and so in time to destroy them all
this

and the like expressions conteined in this paper being so publickly cast upon the officers of this army under my command must of necessity reflect upon my selfe which hath increased my desire to understand the certainty of these particulars which being known may be a good caution to his lordship hereafter to take heed how he builds his groundlesse confidence which he cals assurance upon such weake and partiall informations
the wounded souldiers were dressed and cured by our surgeons at our charges the sick prisoners were visited by the queenes phisitians and medicines given them at our charges these were no signes of any intention to destroy them they have wanted neither sermons nor other divine offices the wifes and sisters of such as have been sick have had free liberty from time to time to attend them the publick collections of such as favour them and the private benevolence of particular friends either in the citty or country have been duely converted to their best advantage and except the inconveniences which accompany a long and throng imprisonment they have wanted nothing which moderate men could

desire
but an are dead and more are sick
let it be admitted can the most carefull governers keep sicknesse out of their camps if it were but out of a provident circumspection for the safety of the citty and ourselves we had reason to use all our best indeavours to keep contagious diseases from among them
this aspersion is rather cast upon almighty god then any way concernes us unlesse he could shew in particular wherein the officers have failed in doing their duties
to prevent all occasion of infection they have been dvided as much as possibly could be diverse of the officers and some others are lodged in the citty some in davy hall some in merchants hall places of good receit some in private houses and sundry of them are admitted to walke up and downe the citty with a keeper
the common prisoners in the castle have the liberty of the castle where they walke all day long at their pleasure and at night lye in the great hall free both from wind and raine
now to censure mens intentions upon probable surmises is rashnesse to doe it against such apparent light is farre from those

rules of christian charity which he pretends
if the death of these prisoners must be imputed to any man to whom rather then to the lord fairfax himselfe who drew them into their rebellious courses who hath neglected them in their distresse and now when he hath meanes to redeem them seems to urge the sicknesse of some of them rather as an argument of discourtesy towards us then of reliefe unto them as if he measured his favours not according to their passed service but his present use
the ground of this heavy accusation followes

which doth more evidently appeare in that have often offered exchange of prisoners taken at wakefield and other places for redemption of those taken at and elsewhere first the evidence is not sufficient to prove his assertion he that shall bind the hands of a phrenetique man or restrein persons who are wilfully bent to hurt themselves or others is not presently guilty of an intention to destroy them since it argues much more probably a desire to save them
secondly an exchange of man for man by the poll is not alwayes an equall exchange according to a true geometricall proportion

if the one have a more considerable estate then the other yet such exchanges as these we have either been necessitated to make with his lordship or to have none at all
thirdly a great part of this mortallity was past before wakefield was so accidentally and unfortunately lost so as his lordships offer came late and unseasonably even by his own confession
but leaving all these advantages the very truth is this the lord fairefax did once condiscend to a treaty before the surprise of wakefield about the redemption of the prisoners but whether it was serious or onely feined and fraudulent to cast a mist before our eyes untill he got his ends on wakefield let all the world judge by the true relation of it
the persons appointed to treat for us were stanhop and nevill and for them lambert and one robinson the place named for the treaty was kippax the time
but the very evening before the meeting no sooner he sent on purpose to forbid it taking some sleight exception to the place and desiring that temple newsom might be named for it and more to the persons alleging that lambert and

robinson were souldiers but stanhop and nevill were none and by consequence knew not how to estimate souldiers according to their true worth desiring that two souldiers might be named in their roomes
which exception is so grossely and palpably frivolous in every mans judgment that knows both parties that it argues strongly that the treaty was nouihed not heartily or bona fide but craftily for private advantage for the very night following they set forward toward wakefield and surprised it on whitsunday early in the morning
but both before and since the said treaty it hath been my desire to have the prisoners exchanged or redeemed
to which purpose must be his remembrancer sundry propositions have been made unto him both before this mortallity fell among them and since as to deliver three hundred of them for three men sir john goodricke sir thomas danby and major hiliard but it was refused
after this sir thomas glemham offered the lord fairfax to release man for man to bring the sick prisoners in carts or on horseback and to deliver them two miles from tadcaster in the midde way between yorke and

leeds attended onely with one troope of horse if the lord fairfax would do the like the troopes not to come within a quarter of a mile each of other but officers to be appointed on either side to receive the prisoners and the lord fairefax and sir thomas glemham to ingage their words respectively each to other that no interruption should be given to either party going or returning but this offer also was rejected as the former unlesse they might be delivered at kippax the place formerly refused by himselfe
and lastly after generall goring was taken prisoner there was a proposition made to deliver the whole upon very favourable terms so as the delivery of generall goring might be treated of and concluded at the same time but that was sleighted also
by all which it is as clear as the sun that the prisoners have had as faire accommodation from us as we could possibly afford or their condition could expect· and that they may thanke the lord fairfax and none but the lord fairfax and his counsellers for their long durance that the subdolous arts the nice exceptions the frivolous pretenses and the menacing lines of

him or his counsellers have been and still are the sole and proper cause under gods just judgement of their deaths who either have been or shall be swept away in this mortallity which is fallen among them yet he is not affraid to impute it to the lord goring and others
so it followes in his declaration

which is refused and opposed by the lord goringe and other persons in that army
speake upon good assurance the lord goring never interposed in this matter untill his sonnes sicknesse and then he was a furtherer and promoter of these prisoners liberty untill the lord fairefax by his threatning and unseasonable expressions in a letter yet extant that such as took and deteined those prisoners did run an hazard of their lifes and fortunes had awakened him to a just consideration of his majesties honour and advantage
and since his sons inprisonment he hath been an earnest mover for a faire treaty
if he seeke to include his sonne therein if he judge it unequall that all the prisoners be restored to their liberty and he onely who tooke them prisoners remaine in strict custody who can blame him the lord fairfax confesseth in one of

his letters that when an offer was made to him for the exchange of these prisoners he did on purpose delay it for foure or five dayes to trye if in the meane time he could procure the releasing of some of his superiour officers
the case is the very same and his officers had no such neare relation to him as such a sonne to such a father
but if the lord gorings desires be pertinaciously opposed he is confident in the goodnesse of almighty god and the successe of his royall master that deliverance shall arise shortly to his sonne by another meanes
so from the seacroft prisoners he proceeds to captain fairfax

and for as much also as captain fairfax and other commanders of rotheram and those parts having by treaty their liberty promised before they yeelded up the place are not withstanding made prisoners contrary to right and the law of arms
have shewed before that neither he nor any of his pretended captains in this warr can challenge any interest in the law of arms yet neverthelesse whatsoever was promised to any of them either by my selfe or by any person by me trusted shal be really and effectually performed so soon as it shall be made

to appear that it was promised
there was a treaty indeed and almost a conclusion but broken off by themselves and afterward the town delivered up by the commissioners or deputies named and trusted by the town to negotiate for them who were all desirous to return to their loyalty and obedience notwithstanding the reluctation of captaine fairfax aud the other captaines
am bound to make good all those covenants which themselves deserted praesta mihi omnia eadem idem sum
this being the case they might all have been deteined without breach of promise
yet captain fairfax was permitted to to go to the lord fairfax upon his own word to return and hath been used with as much freedome and courtesie as he can desire the others were stayed not for the businesse of rotheram but for the contribution towards the charge of the warre which themselves had helped to raise as was expresly concluded in the treaty of rotheram if it had succeeded and that with so much courtesy and respect that the principall of them westby is fairly slipped away
and to let the world see how unwilling am to come near the brinke of

or within the suspition of it have given order for captain fairfax his liberty
he proceeds

captain reynolds captaine fulthorpe dalton and lilburne being all men of quality are all thrown into dungeons and there kept in most miserable aud inhumane durance
thus he busieth himselfe to hunt after pretenses what are these fower to him two of them being bishopricke men the other two serving under another command unlesse he be the generall superintendent of the north as he would be the generall of the northern forces
but let us examine it
all thrown into dungeons and there kept in most miserable and inhumane durance very high expressions and all this to be published to the world by the lord fairfax in a declaration under his hand and scarce one word of it to be true sub modo as it is related he that was the penner of this passage needs not paint a cypresse tree to move his spectators to pitty
surely the lord fairfax will never more give credit to those informers who suggested this unto him
captein fulthorpe and lilburne have the best chamber in the castle to themselves
captein

reynolds and dalton are in the sommer hall with another gentleman one constable a prisoner for debt and they three have that long roome to themselves where sometimes above thrice three debters have been kept
the two former have the freedome of the castle the two latter are indeed restreined and upon just grounds dalton for preaching openly sedition and rebellion to the prisoners and reynolds for seconding him in it

his last charge is about doctor bastwick and captaine ludlow
and also that doctor bastwick and captain ludlow are made close prisoners and all conveniences for their health denyed to them insomnch as all the gentlemen aforesaid are like to perish through those unusuall tortures and durances which they suffer in their imprisonment at york
tortures and unusuall tortures who inflicteth them when upon whom falshood alwayes loves to goe masked in generalities
neither are those two prisoners any thing to him at all except his christian charity which is so cold to his neighbours do glow toward strangers
when doctor bastwick captain ludlow were first committed to the

castle of york they had all the liberty which that place could afford and much better accommodation then they deserved beleeve as good as the best doctors in the kingdom who are now in the custody of the other party doe find
and in this state they might have continued if a malignant heart an envious eye and an inveterate rancour against soveraignty had not incited them to broach pestilent principles to make their chamber a schoole of errour a poysoned fountain to infect the minds of his majesties subjects with schismaticall and seditious opinions
and yet for all this they were not so restrained but that they had two hues allowed each day to walk abroad within the precinct's of the castle for their health and recreation untill their letters were intercepted forty miles from yorke of prodigious treason against the person of his sacred majesty and by them acknowledged to sir thomas glemhan to be their own hands and mainteined that they would seale the same with their bloods
then as it was high time they were confined to their lodging an easie punishment for such an exorbitant crime
who will suffer a scabb'd sheep to mingle with his flock

we use to shut up the doores of persons infected with the plague without any breach of the liberty of the subject
if a papist doe but attempt to seduce any of his majesties subjects it is death by our law
and it is true that being in this condition of late they both fell sick not of a consumption out of griefe or for want of necessary sustenance but of an hot feaver whereof ludlow is dead and bastwicke is upon his recovery god give him grace to amend his manners
but that corollary which follows that all conveniences for their health are denied them was forged in the same shop with the rest of the declaration
for they have had both their medicines and apothecaries to attend them what and whom they desired and their divine to give them ghostly counsaile and comfort and all other expediences which they did request
if that truth which they cry for in religion be of the same stampe with their morall truths god deliver all good christians from it

in the close of his paper he intimates the like hard measure to our prisoners taken at wakefield who as he saith have hitherto been used with all humanity and civility
hope that to

crowd them together into filthy and worse then augean stables is no part of this civility
hope that to choke them with the fumes of their own ordure and to bury them alive in subterraneous cellars is no part of this humanity where they cannot behold the light of heaven but through a little grate of two spans breadth and this onely because they remember their duties oaths obligations to his majesty better then themselves
but delight not in recriminations

by this we may conjecture in part what is the true scope of this declaration to cast an aspersion upon his majesties officers to lead the friends of the sick prisoners into a fooles paradise in expectation of some miraculous deliverance to remove from himselfe the blame and envy of their long durance as if he desired an exchange but we stopped it and lastly to excuse the hard and unhumane usage of our prisoners in his army
but to unmaske him do heereby declare to all the world that ever have been and still am ready to entertein a faire treaty about the prisoners
and now at last his lordship may doe well to keep an audit with his own conscience and understanding

to take notice of that deluge of mischiefes and miseries which he hath brought upon this county and made his native country a field or stage of blood as if the liberty of the subject did consist in a liberty or rather licentiousnesse for them to doe what they list and to compell all others that are not of their faction to suffer what they list
he may doe well to consider that these men whom he imprisons are free men born and fellow subjects with himselfe and with them from whom he pretends to derive his authority that god and their king will expect a severe account of it that the empty name spurious title of generall of the northern forces for king and parliament contrary to the light of reason contrary to the plain law of the land much more irregular and exorbitant then the most pernicious presidents of the worst times which ever england groaned under will be no satisfactory plea for so many lifes and so many soules as have perished and are like to perish in this unnaturall rebellion that when his guilt is elevated to the highest the catastraphe without timely prevention will be the utter ruine of him and his adherents
and his

seduced followers may doe well also to open their eyes and consider at how dear a rate hitherto they have purchased nothing but repentance with the ruine of so many estates the effusion of so much blood the perill of so many soules taken away in actuall rebellion without knowing either what they desire or what they fear without one text of scripture or one particle of law to warrant their actions being meerly led by the perswasions of the lord fairfax and their seditious preachers so much as in them is to overthrow what they desire to build up the protestant religion the law of the land the liberty of the subject that a timely submission is their only remedy that if they still continue their desperate courses his majesty and his servants are guiltlesse and they may blame themselves for all those mischiefes which fall upon their own heads

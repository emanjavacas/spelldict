the learned in antiquities have diversly written about the time of the foundation of the universitie of cambridge som affirming it was founded by cantaber a prince of spain brother to partholinus king of ireland sonne in law to gurguntius king of great britain many yeares before the incarnation of our saviour christ of whose name according to the spaish language it was first called cantabriga after of his sonne grantinus who is said to have walled it about grantbriga and grantbrige
others say that cassivilanus prince of the troynobantes king octavius arthur king of great bitain and ethelbert king of kent were each of them founders or restorers of the same
but the chiefest conclude and agree that sigebert king of the east angles was the principall founder thereof about the yeares and who assigned dives hostles and houses for students to inhabite in giving them large priviledges and charters whereof some are yet extant procuring also great immunities from pope honorius the first which sergius the first confirmed
since which time by reason of mny incursions and continuall warres between the britains romanes saxons the kings of this heptarchie danes and normans the light and glorie of this academie was not onely of old much eclipsed but even since the conquest in the barons warre also obscured and defaced and it is most certain as the destructions were many so the restaurations thereof shortly ensued by one prince or other so that at length recovering it self it is most worthily reputed one of the famous universities in the world
muh honour this place hath received by the soones and nephews of kings in being earls thereof viz william brother to ranulph earl of chester john earl of henault uncle to philip le beau king of france whose daughter isabel was wife to king edwar the second and mother to king edward the third william marquesse of juliars edmund of langley duke of york edward duke of york richard earl of cambridge richard duke of york james marquesse hamleton earl of arren baron hamleton of chattelrault and at this present james marquesse hamleton earl of arren master of the horse to his majestie
and howsoever the hostles halls innes schools and religious houses whereof the universitie before and sice the conquest did consist which now are wholly defaced or in part converted into some of the present colledges were for their number and number of students in them much above all that are now extant many of them being formerly known by these nmes frater de poenitentia jesu christi johannis zacharii botolphi divi gerhardi edvardi edmundi augustini divi thonae beatae mariae clementis hovingi diversorium divi gregorii margaretae katharinae hospitium phiswici tegularii hospitium harlstoni diversorium trinitatis domus dei ruddi hospitium michaelis domus aulae regae pauli diversorium burdeni hospitium with many others yet at this present it consists of sixtee goodly colledges and halls erected and maintained with the lands and revenews of their severall founders one of the chappels thereof founded by holy king henry the sixth and the colledge of the holy and undivided trinitie founded by king henry the eighth no universitie in the world can in all points parallell
these are the nurseries of gods true religion and seminaries of good literature which by the speciall favour and gracious protection of our most deare soveraigne lord charle by the grace of god of great britain france and ireland king do enjoy all peace and happinesse

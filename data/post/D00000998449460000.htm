the persian cyrus xenophens penne achilles homers found king alexanders valure great did curtius stile resound their worthie fame those worthie wittes to skies aloft do send those worthie wits cake by their fame themselues to fame commend

though skilfull muses notes come short to sound this princes prayse her princely giftes her iustice mylde her peacefull lasting dayes yet kyffins muse in stately stile hath shot so neare the same that by resounding worthie praise himself deserueth fame

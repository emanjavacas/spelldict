flovvers of lodowick of granado
the first part
in which is handled the conuersion of a sinner

the argument
sinners by the meanes of feare are vnto god who if they consider the scriptures could not but considering the perrill wherein liue
for which cause forsaking their old manner of life they change it into a better they should be deliuered fro the of the punishments of sinne which god threatneth to inflict them

chap

almighty god is wont to vse no one more effectuall remedy to restraine the lust of men reuoake their harts from misdeeds then by before theyr eyes what paines punishments are appoynted for for euils doe more effectually

affect vs then good things
experience doth truly teach vs th wee are not so much mooued wi honour as with ignominy not much by benefites as by iniuries that wee reioyce not so much health as wee grieue at for the good of the one is mo easily and better known by the of the other for no man knoweth what it is to be whole he yt hath had effectuall experien what it is to be sick so that a the more it is felt and the more vhemently it affecteth vs by so the more discouereth it his natu vnto vs
for that cause in the time our forefathers god was more wont to vse the co~mination of pnishment against sinne then any remedy which the wryting of the prophets most manifestly vnto vs which are fraught terrors and replenished with mnaces wherby god foretelleth th he will punish sin

so before he ouerthrew that mo famous citty and kingdome of by the forces of king of babilon hee

to haue sayd to the prophet remie take the volume of the in which it is not written in at write all that haue said against and israell from the day that vnto thee to this day
and ou shalt read it before the people perhaps they hearing all these that thinke to doe vnto them urne euery one from their wicd way and will be mercifull to theyr sinne and iniquitie and will staine from those punishments which had prepared for them
the prophet presently addeth that his secretary had described all the comminations of god and red before all the people princes who sayth each one was amazed vnto his neighbour and as it astonished beholding one through excesse feare conceid by the wordes of the prophet ooke trembled in their whole dies

this is the meanes my brother god not onely at that time to excite the harts of men all them from the way of iniqui but at diuers other times also·

then vvhich meanes there may nothing be founde out more effectuall or powerfull
for so many so great be those thinges which sacred writ the word of god the perfection of our fayth and report of the of vertue and the turpitude contempt of vices that if woulde diligentlie reade and attetiuely marke and ponder them there is no doubt but the pe vvherein they dailie liue would oten afflict theyr mindes with and they themselues should tremble thereat

for this cause one of the remdies which the prophet wished bee applyed to this incurable eu was thus which sayth the peop are vvithout counsayle pruden woulde to god they vnderstood or the vvhich are to come
for if trulie did as they ought to doe were impossible for them so long time to perseuer in theyr vvick wayes

but out alas they wander so blinlie in the affayres of this world

so much bewitched or rather ried in the loue of the same that this man hunteth after hee is intangled with priuate fayres that man is intent on oer mens defects others gape after fices dignities and promotions other commodities of this life of them wholy swallowed vp in nall and earthly affayres haue no neyther finde eyther eyes or nde to examine or looke into emselues that but euen for a lit time they may allow themselues to consider on this matter
therefore in times past these men spake the prophet ephraim is made as a doue seced not hauing a hart for these robate and lost men whereas haue a hart to loue to thinke rethink on those things which long vnto thys lyfe will haue no nd to remember or meditate on ose things which belong vnto the to come
which notwithstang are such and so admirable that man do but attentiuely wey the of them and vvith an vndernding voyde of all perturbation

of the minde examine the same shall haue sufficient cause of amazednes and reason to indu him to the correction of his

beeing moued therefore in espciall by this reason thought should doe a worke worthy the lbour if proposed some fewe those thinges before their eyes th wil either read or write to the imitation of ieremy that vderstanding not onely the which god hath prepared for loose and wicked sort but also good which he hath decreed to bstowe on the godly and iust th might forsake the way of iniquit that god might receiue them guing them pardon of al their sinne and deliuering them from all the punishments which in the book of holy scripture hee threatneth· inflict vpon them

the argument
christian must thinke that hee is a man and a christian and therfore to death bound to yeeld a reason of his life past in another world
for which cause he shall doe aduisedly if he wey without intermission the horrible and intollerable griefes which are wont to encomber the sinner at the howre of death and the feares and amazements that presently ouerwhelme him vppon the entrance of the lyfe to come
at which time neyther the goods of the body nor the goods of nor any fauour of this world may appease the iust and incensed wrath of god against sinners

chap

that therefore wee may begin from matters most apparant and which daily we behold with our eyes goe to my brother remember ou art a christian and a man because thou art a christian be asred thou shalt yeelde account of

thy lyfe when thou art dead
fayth which wee hold and profes excludeth all doubt and that it is experience offering herselfe dai to our eyes trulie teacheth vs that no man is free from this chlice but all must drinke whether he be pope whether ki eyther any other

the day shall once come whe in at morning thou shalt liue night thou shalt be dead
the shall one day bee but whether shall happen to day or to it is altogether vncertaine in whi thou thy selfe which nowe these thinges which wee reckon whole and strong measuring life by the length of thy desires the dayes by the multitude of affaires shalt see thy selfe lying thy bedde full of greefe and sicnesse expecting euery moment stroake and terrible sentence death against all from which thou canst appeale to any other iudge

but especially it is to be howe vncertaine that howre for euen then it is wont to fall

when it is least expected and en a man wholy secure thinkes of it but rather intending the sinesses and occupations of this complots in his hart howe to nd his longer hoped life in more icitie and worldlie pleasures
for ich it is often sayde in the lie scripture that it shall come in night like a theefe who euen is vvont to breake in vvhen soundest are most secu thinke of nothing lesse then imminent theft perrill which the suddaine happeneth vnto

before death himselfe commeth a sicknesse dooth vsher which is to be considered of all his accidents greefes trous abhorrings angers sirrups dections suffumigations pylls garrismes and sundry other medies
the long nights likewise ich at this time are most vncomtable wearisome and full of teusnes all which dispose and prere the way to death

for euen as the captaine that ill conquer a fort first maketh

a breach with his greater then assaileth inuadeth and posesseth the same so before death· grieuous infirmitie beginnes charge which so weakeneth dcayeth the naturall strength of bodie that it vouchsafeth man nther daily nor nightly rest but shketh all the principall members his body without intermission the soule is vnable to her fort any longer or conserue in the same for which shee leaueth her habitation in body and hauing escaped flye and departeth to another place

but when the infirmitie hath pruailed so much as eyther the man himselfe or the phisition bginnes to doubt despaire of good god what what anguishes what agonies at that time excruciate teare hart then the course or his life is called to then all the images of leauing the representations of those which hee heere loued his wife children his friendes his paren· his riches his honours his titles

and all other thinges which wont to bee extinct together life represent themselues vnto

after these the last accidents are co~nexed with death himlfe doe which are far grear then the precedent
the browe bent and the skin is distent wheron a cold sweat breaketh foorth balls of the eyes waxe dimme de and through the intollerable hemencie of paine are rowled certainly the eares waxe deafe nose sharpe the nostrills are replete with excrement the face waxeth blew the mouth is contracted the tongue is doubled and can no more performe his office tast the lyppes waxe pale the reinforcing it selfe from the nter of the breast growes difficit and short the hands wax cold nayles blacke the pulse feeble faint but of speedy motion we intermitteth now antlie creeth the feete die and loose theyr turall heate
what neede many the whole flesh is turned corruption and all the members

and sences are troubled through th hastie separation
in this must a man departing out of world satisfie for the labours of others by whom hee into this world suffering in his decease those griefes which his suffered when shee bare him· and thus most signal is the propotion of mans egresse and ingre into the worlde for both of are full of dolors but that his causeth others griefes his sue his owne

whilst a man floteth and is tosed in these perplexities suddainl the agony of death is at hand end of life the horror of the graue the infelicity of the body which shortly be wormes meate are represented to the memory but of the soule which as yet in the body but after an or two must be seperated from then shalt thou thinke the iudgement of god to be present then before thee shalt thou see all thy sinns which shall accuse thee before the tribunall of diuine iustice then the length but too late shalt

knowledge how loathsome those were which thou so easely then with many due ecrations shalt thou curse the day thou sinnedst and crie woe those pleasures and delectations by their allurements inuited to sinne
thou canst not in at houre sufficiently admire at thy fe and thine owne leuity who for so vaine and of so little as are those which with inornate loue thou wert wont to lust ter hast cast thy selfe into the perl of enduring such intollerable dours of which in that fatall houre ou shalt haue no smal experiment· or pleasures passing away and the dgement of them approaching at which by it selfe was before lite now ceaseth to be shall seeme be nothing but that which in it fe is great and presently instant ou shalt think it greater then it is thou shalt manifestly know at length with all his circumstans
when therefore thou shalt see things so vaine and light nay raer filthy that thou art nowe of so many goods and rowling

thine eyes hither and thou shalt see thy selfe with so many mischiefes and triblations for liue thou canst longer neither is there place for neyther shall there be a time
the number of thy dayes sumd vp they cannot helpe the whom with inordinate loue hast affected
much lesse the idol which thou adorest why doe
it yea what so euer thou louedst and such thinges as greatest estimation with thee eu these shall most of all torment the
tell me pray thee when thou fidest thy selfe forsaken in this perr what minde what heart wilt haue whether wilt thou goe wh wilt thou doe whom wilt thou vppon it is impossible for thee returne to life and to leaue it is it is not graunted to in life vvhat therefore wi doe in that day saith our lord by the prophet the sunne shall sette and will darken the earth in the day of light wil her festiualls into mournings· and all her songs into plaints and

ll put her as the lament of the st begotten and her last as the bitr day
horrible wordes hard ntence shaking and amazing all whatsoeuer
in that day saith the sunne shall set at in that houre sinners shall haue multitude of their misdeedes set their sight and beholding the iustice breaking their threed life a sonder some of them shall stroken with so much feare and rour that they shall be destitute all hope and confidence because ey shall thinke themselues to be and holy excluded from mercy of god

put the case they be as yet in the sted that is let them be yet the race of life which is as yet time of repentance yet will ey perswade themselues that there no time or place for them repent but that all meanes of are cut off and excluded
is the most powerfull of the minde which faineth it selfe each little thing to bee great and is alwaies afraid of things as if they were present

if a little feare of any thing can this what cannot that true feare doe which is conceaued of so and capitall perrils they are as aliue placed in the midst of the friends notwithstanding begin th to feele the paines and punishmen of the damned
they seeme at time to be both aliue and dead surprized with the griefes of present thinges which they are leaue they beginne to feele tho succeeding euills vvhich they fered
they deeme them blessed th are left in this worlde and of enuie growe their reasons of new griefe

the sun therefore setteth to at noone day when as to what so euer they turne their eyes shal see the entrance to heauen way shut against them neyth shall the radiation of any light appeare vnto them
for if they respect the mercy of god they shall themselues vnwoorthy to the mercy of god if they flie to the diuine iustice they shall suspect that by it there are due and seuere punishmentes prepared for them

at hetherto their day was but now day of our lord is at hand yea ey shal think that it is already benning

if they call to remembraunce eyr life it them vtterly if they regarde time present they see themues a dying if the time shortly come they see the iudge placed his iudgement seate and themues exspected to be iudged
now uironed with so many causes of are what shall they doe whether all they wend the prophet goeth forward
and will make the earth darke in the of light that is those thinges at are woont sweetely to delight nowe shall most of all torture and wound thy minde with tollerable goades of griefe

trulie it is a pleasant thing for a in his life time and in state health to see his children to ioy his friendes to order his to haue many ritches and possesse with delight vvhat the mind can desire
but then that pleasure is conuerted into

griefe for all these thinges shal teare and tire the conscience with terrible and shall be the cruell of these calamities
it is naturall euen as the possession and of a thing which we loue doth ioyce vs euen so the absence therof should breede our sorrow and spleasure
the son of the dying father doe flie his prsence and the louing wife hid her selfe from the face of her decesing husband in his pangs least presence should augme~t his but although the soule that is psently to be seperated from the bo is to depart into an vnknowne rgion and the way is at hand bo long and perrilous yet immeasuble griefe permitteth not to obse the termes of humanity and ciuili neither giueth him leaue that entreth his iourney to bid his once farewell before his if thou hast at any time good reder made tryall heereof thou doo soothly vnderstand that doe eue way speake the truth
if thou neuer been entangled in this perril

beleeue them that haue experience heereof for they saile the sea as the shew the perrils thereof

therefore such and so great be that forgoe this dolefull sepeion what and how mighty thint thou shal they be that shall folw if the euen and vigill be such shall the festiuall and solemne it selfe be tell mee pray thee what wilt thinke of that houre when deting out of this life thou shalt that diuine iudgement alone ked poore without any defender thy cause and thine onely conence thy companion and that trinall shall be so exceedingly sere and strickt where the case of or of temporall death shall not handled but of eternall
and if yeelding thy account thou shalt found to be much indebted alas horrible shall the anxieties and rows of thy soule be how consed shalt thou be and full of penitence how voide of all unsell and destitute of all solace

trulie the perturbation amongst

the princes of iuda was very whe as the victorious sword of casar king of egypt did thorow all the streetes of when as thorowe the present and punishment they acknowleged theyr crymes olde errours
but there is no coparison betwixt that confusion this whereof we now intreate in that houre what shal sinners whether shal they turne who shall defend them teares the are of no force there all repentan is vnprofitable in that houre nether shall prayers be heard nor promises preuaile or any suret be accepted
when as the last of life is past there is no mo time of repent
and if the forsaid finde no place much lesse rches nobility and honours of world shall helpe for the wise saith riches shall not helpe in day of reuenge but iustice sh deliuer from death

but when the vnhappie soule see her selfe enuironed with so manie calamities what shall shee doe what shall shee say in what

rdes shall shee lament her lamenle case then those which in times the prophet vsed when he said
paynes of death haue compas mee rounde about and the ods of iniquitie haue troubled ee the dolours of hell haue enoned me and the snares of death entrapped mee
vvoe is me etch that am what circle is this which my sinnes haue enclosed howe suddainly and when suspected doth this houre engle mee howe presseth it mee when least thought of vvhat auayle mee myne hours nowe what helpe me my gnities what all my friendes profitte will my seruauntes vve bring mee vvhat fruite all receaue of all those ritches goods which was woont to ssesse for nowe a small fielde seauen foote long must suffice and must be content with the roome of a sepulcher and base winding sheete

but that which is worst of all the which with so many sweats haue grated from others

shall remaine heere behind oth men shall enioy them and consu them in pleasures onely the sin which haue committed in them shall accompany me th
may sustaine condigne punishme for them
what shall doe with my pleasures and delights when they are past away and them remaines but the dreggs in bottome which are the scruples remorce of conscience which thornes prick and teare my miserble hart and shall crucifie the sa with perpetuall torments dul not to be indured my slouth negligence worthy a thousand mseries how could it be that forgefull of this time haue not my selfe to auoid these present how often was warned this day yet haue shutte vp mi eares to all counsailes wretch th

in

such like lamentable expostulas shall sinners deplore their vnpy fortunes these shall be their ditations these their considerati these their confessions

why trauaile in vaine who wise who so eloquent that sufficiently expresse or describe and rigour of that iudgnt wee reade of a certaine deed· that after his death appeared his friend greeuouslie afflicted oppressed with great dolours a dreadfull and lamentable ce exclaiming thus
no man beeth no man beleeueth no man
his friend amazed with demaunded of him what hee by that lamentation to who re aunswered thus no man beueth howe strictly god iudgeth how seuerely he punisheth
in firmation of which matter ke it not vnprofitable to report place an example of wonder admiration which iohn clima reporteth to haue happened in time to a certaine monke

for saith will not omit also to relate history of a certaine solitarie

votary which dwelt in coreb when hee had liued negligently long time without any care at all his soule at length ceazed by a sines was brought to the last and when the soule had wholy fsaken the body after an houres he was restored againe to life vpon hee besought euery one that wee should from immediatly depart from him closing vp the dore of his cell stones he remained there enclo for twelue yeeres space speaking no man nor tasting any other but bread and water
there sitt hee onely amazedly meditated that which he had seene during seperation from the body and fixed were his thoughts vppon same as that he neuer changed countenance but alwayes remning in that amazement he silen poured foorth a streame of feru teares
and when hee grew vnto his death breaking open dore of his cell wee entred in him and when wee humbly sought him to giue vs one word ghostly instruction at last we on

orted this fro him pardon mee man that hath truly the memo of death may euer commit sin wee were strooken with wonrfull admiration beholding him first had beene so negligent to so suddainly changed and by a st blessed transformation to be de another man
hetherto clichus who was an of this who that which sawe in his writings
so that no although it may seeme increle to som ought to doubt here especially sith hee is both a true a faithfull witnes

nowe in this storie there are thinges which deseruedly vvee ght to feare considering the lyfe ich this holy man led and much the vision which hee sawe ence sprung that his manner of which euer after during his ole life he obserued
these there sufficiently approoue that to be which is spoken by the remember thy end thou not sinne for euer

least therere my brother thou shouldest into the like calamities beseech

thee with great attention of to discusse examine often rep these things aforesaid alwaies euery where present the to thy mmory
but amongst all the rest graue co~sideration attentiue mmory these three things in especi
the first whereof is that thou cosider the greatnes of the punish which thou shalt feele in the ho of death for the multitude of sinnes wherwith thou hast offend the diuine bounty
secondly thou diligently wey with what sire thou shalt then wish that hadst so ordered thy life that in houre thou might'st haue god ppitious vnto thee
thirdly that remember how great austere pnitence thou wouldst then willing if time might be grted thee

the argument
day of iudgement an exact acunt shal be required at a handes of all his thoughts and done in this life
the sinner the iust iudgement of god shall cast downe headlong into perpeall affliction plaints darknes the infernall prison
there whilst is with most ardent torres and punishments full of rage burning with wrath against he shal curse excruiate him lfe calling to memory all those which he hath done and those things which he hath neglected doe
for which cause who soeuer not fall into these desasters let repent whilst he hath time

after death followeth euery mans perticuler iudgement

after that ye vniuersal of al men whe as that which the apostle teacheth shalbe fuld
we must all of vs be manife before the tribunall of christ

that euery one may receiue accoding to that which he hath done his body either good or bad

many thinges are to be in this iudgement but the of them is diligently to wey what things the account shal be exacted from vs
will search our lord ierusale by candle light· and will visite vppon the men th are intent on their dreggs

the maner of speaking in holy scripture is to signifie that the thinges of lea consequence shal be both discust examined in that day euen as in slight things are wont to light a candle and search euery corner the house
for there is not any one vaine cogitation of thine or moment of time euilly and vnfruitfully let slip by thee wherof a reason shal not be required at thy hands

who woulde not tremble and shake euery lym of him when heareth the words of our lord verely verely say vnto you of euery idle worde that men haue spoken they shall giue a reason in the day of iudgement well if an account must be made of those words

offend no man what shal be for dishonest words cogitations for handes full of for adulterous euils final for all the time of our life loosely in the works of iniquity this bee true as it is most true tongue what eloquence may so much of the rigor and of this iudgement which all not be lesser then the truth of thing it selfe or what is it may wayes bee equalled with the me

howe shall the wretched man and heere amazed and astonished in the circle ofso many and the presence of so great a the account shal be at his handes of the least which such or such a day he ake fondly and without fruite who would not be amazed at this vvho durst say these inges except christ himselfe had them before who affirme he had affirmed what king there euer found that with his seruants for so light a altitude of christian religion

how great is the puritie which thou teachest how strict is the account which thou exactest with howe seuere iudgement doost thou discusse and examine all thinges how great shal the shame be wherwith wretched sinners shall in place be stained when as all theyr iniquities which when they lyued they hid vnder the couerts and walls of theyr houses what soeuer also dishonest filthy thing they haue committed fro theyr tender yeeres to the terme of their life all the angles of their harts euer is most secrete shall be manifested in this court before eyes of the whole world
who there shal haue a conscience so cleere who when these thinges shall beginne to be done shall not presently change his colour and tremble in all his members

for if a man doe so much blush when hee reuealeth his defects in priuate to some friende of his so that some one in the very confession waxeth dumbe and concealeth his crime what shame shal that be sinners shall be affected

in the sight of almighty god and of all ages past present and to come so great shall that shame be that the wicked as the prophet witnesseth shall cry out

saying to the mountaines couer vs to hils fall vpon vs

but these thinges are tollerable but what shall become of them when as the sharpe arrowes of that finall sentence from gods mouth

shall be shotte into theyr harts goe you cursed into euerlasting which is prepared for the deuill and his angels

alas with what sorrowes shall be discrutiate when they heare this sentence when as wee can scarcely heare a little droppe of his wordes sayth iob who can beholde the thunder of his greatnes

this voyce shal be so dreadfull and of such vertue that the earth in the twinckling of an eye shall bee opened and in a moment they shall descend to hell as the sayd iob saith who now enioy the timbrel harp

and reioyce at the sound of the organ vvho nowe leade theyr dayes in pleasure

this case describeth blessed saint iohn in his apocalips in these wordes after this saw another angel descending from heauen hauing great power the earth was lightned by his glory and he cryed out in his strength saying great babilon is fallen is fallen and is made the habitation of deuils and the prison of all vncleane spirits the habitation of each vncleane odible bird
a little after the same euangelist addeth saying the strong angel tooke vp a stone as if it were a great milstone and cast it into the sea and said with this force shal the great citty babilon be cast down· henceforward it shall no more bee found

after this manner shal the wicked fall into this headlong hell and into that darksom prison ful of al confusion which is vnderstood of babilon in this place
but what tunge can expresse the multitude of punishments which they shall there suffer there shal their bodies burne in liuing vnquenchable flames there their soules without intermission shalbe gnawed vpon by the worme

of conscience which shal giue them no truce there shall be perpetuall weeping of eyes and gnashing of teeth that shal neuer end which the sacred scriptures do so often threaten repeat
in this place of desperation those miserable damned enraged with a certaine cruel madnes shal co~uert their anger against god tyrannize against themselues eating their owne flesh renting theyr bowels with furious grones

aring one anothers flesh with their nailes and incessantly blaspheming the iudge that condemned them vnto the punishments
there each of the shall curse his vnfortunate chaunce vnhappy natiuity repeating without intermission that doleful plaint and those desolate and lamentable songs of iob curst bee the day in which was borne and the night in which it is said

hee is conceiued a man let that day bee turned into darknes let not god require vpon it neither let it be illustrate with light
let darknes obscure it the shadow of death let a mist ouercloude it let it be wrapped in bitternes
let a dark storme possesse yt night

let it not be accounted amongst the dayes of the yeere nor numbred in the months
let that night be and vnworthy praise let them curse the same who curse the day who are ready to waken the leuiathan

let the starres bee with the mist thereof let the expect light and not see it neither the beginning of the rising morne because it shut not vp the doore of the wombe that bare me neither tooke away the euils from mine eyes
why died not in the wombe or from the same why perrished not presently why was receiued into the lap why sucked at the teates

this shal be the musick these the songs such the mattins which those vnhappy soules shall sing without end
vnlucky tongues which speake nothing but blasphemies vnfortunate eyes that see but calamities and miseries
miserable eares that heare nothing but plaints and gnashing of teeth vnlucky bodies which haue no other refreshings but burning flames
of what minde shall they be there

who whilst they liued here deluded the howres in trifles and spent all their time in pleasures and delights how long a chaine of misery haue these so short delights forged foolish and incensate what will the allurements of the flesh profit you nowe which then you cherrished whereas now you are deuoted to eternall plaints what is become of your ritches vvhere are your where your delights where are your reioycings the
yeeres of plentie are past and the
yeeres of dearth are come which haue deuoured all their aboundance
there is no memory left of them nor appearance your glory is foredone your felicities drowned in the sea of sorrow your thirst is grown to that drith that there is not one of water granted by which the immesurable heate of thy throate which infinitlie tormenteth thee may bee

your felicities which you inioyed in this world will not onelie not profit you but euen they will bee the causes to you of greater torme~t
for the shall be fulfilled that which

is written in the booke of iob
let mercy forget him wormes are his sweetnesse

let him not bee in remembrance but cut downe like an vnfruitfull blocke
but then the sweetnesse of the delight of euils is turned into the worme of greefe when as the remembrance of pleasures according to the exposition of saint gregory shall beget a greater bitternes of greefes bethinking themselues the what they haue beene and in what place they nowe be that for that which is so soone vanished they nowe suffer that which shall endure for euer

then at length but too late shall they acknowledge the fallacies of the deuill placed in the midst of errours shal begin but in vaine to speake the wordes of the wiseman saying vve haue wandered from the way of truth

and the light of iustice hath not shined vpon vs the sunne of vnderstanding is not risen vnto vs wee are wearied in the way of iniquity perdition haue walked difficult wayes but the way of our lord haue we not knowne

what hath our pride profited vs or the boast of our riches what hath furthered vs all those things are past away as a shadow or as it were a messenger running before or like a shippe that hath passed a troublesome water whereof when it is past is no tract to be found neither the way of the keele thereof in the floods
such like wordes haue the sinners spoken in hell because the vngodly mans hope is like the light feather which is lifted vppe by the wind and like the light froth of the sea which is dispersed by the sunne and as it were smoake scattered by the wind· and like the memory of a one dayes guest passing by
these shall be the complaints these the lamentations this the perpetuall penance which the damned shal there performe world without end where it shall profit them nothing because the time was wherein they should shew fruites worthy of repentance

come therfore whilst then is time of repent come you that haue eares to heare and receaue that wholsom counsaile of our lorde which he in

time past gaue by the mouth of
prophet saying giue glory your lorde god

before it darke and before your feete stumble against the darksome hills
shall exspect the and he sha put the same in the shadow of death and in darknes

watch say the time let vs followe his counsaile· who before he was our iudge be our aduocate
no one knowe more exactly what will hinder profit in that day then he who himselfe be iudge of all causes he briefly teacheth vs what is needfull for vs to doe that in that day wee may be secure
take heed to your selues saith he by saint luke

th your harts be not loaden with gluttony and drunkennes and the of this life and that this day doe not sodainly come vpon you for like a net or snare shal it surprize all those that sit vppon the face of the earth
watch therefore at all times praying that you may be worthy to flie all these things which are to come and stand before the sonne of man

deerely beloued let vs consider

all these things and at length let vs waken from our heauy sleepe before darke night of death shall whelme vs before that day shall enfold vs of which the prophet speaketh behold the day is at hand

and who may thinke the day of his comming and who shal stand to behold him he he may exspect the day of our lorde who hath heere bound the hands of the iudge

and hath iudged himselfe in this world

the author purposely entreateth of the latter iudgement in his sirst booke of prayer and meditation and in his exercises in thursday nights meditation likewise in the guide of sinners cap

the argument

they who haue loued god with all their harts shall receaue their remuneration in heauen namely the glory of eternall beatitude which in respect of the accidents in some it shall be greater in some other lesser yet is the essentiall reward one and common to all the elect

for there shall be perfect charity and god shall be all in all
for that cause it shall be the common exercise of all to loue and praise god without end or intermission

chap

bvt in that we haue already aboundantly discoursed of the condemnation and sentence which attendeth impious and sinfull men it consequently foloweth that we speake also of the beatitude and reward of good men
now this blessednes that desired and holy kingdome of heauen

and that happy life which god from the beginning of the created world prepared for those who loue and follow him
there is no tongue eyther humaine or angelicall that can worthily expresse what that reward shall be or what that life will be
but that thou mayst haue some tast and receaue some knowledge of the same will by the way report that which saint augustine wrote of it

in certaine of his meditations
thou life

that god hath prepared for those loue him liuing life blessed amiable life cleane life chast holy life life ignorant of death deuoyd of sorrow life without blot without greefe without anxietie without corruption without without varietie and lyfe full of all elegancie and dignitie where there is no to impugne where there is no of sinne where there is loue and no feare where day is eternall and one spirit of
where god is beheld face to and with this foode of life the minde is satiate and satisfied without defect

it dooth mee good to intende to cleerenes thy beauties delight my greedy hart the more power haue to consider with my selfe the more doe languish with the loue of thee with the vehement desire of thee and am greatly delighted with thy sweete memory
thou most happy life thou truly blessed kingdome wanting death void of end to which no times succeede by where as the continuall day

without night cannot haue time where as the conquering souldiour accompanying those quires of angels singeth vnto god without ceasing a song of the songs of sion hauing his noble heade inuironed with a crowne

would to god the pardon of my finnes were graunted mee and that presently laying aside this burthen of my flesh might enter into the true rest of thy ioyes and that possessing the most beautifull admirable walls of thy citty might receiue the crowne of life from the handes of our lorde that might accompany these holy quires that with those blessed spirits might asist the glory of the creator that face to face might behold christ that might alwayes looke vppon that high ineffable and vncircumscribed light

happy is that soule which deliuered fro this earthly body may freely ascend to heauen that secure and peaceable neither feareth the deuil nor death
happy eternally happie my soule if after this corporall

death it may be counted worthy to behold thy glory thy maiesty thy beautie thy gates walls streetes thy many mansions thy noble cittizens and thy most mightie kingdome in thy comlines

for thy vvalls are of precious stone and thy gates of the purest margarites thy streetes are of burnisht golde wherein without intermission alleluia is sunge thy mansions are many founded on squared stones builded with saphires couered with golden tile into which no man entreth except he be cleane wherein no one inhabiteth that is defiled

mother ierusalem thou art made faire and sweet in thy delights there is no such thing in thee as we suffer heere and behold in this miserable life
they differ very far from those thinges which are daily present before our eyes in this life full of calamitie
there is no darknes in thee neither night or any change of time
the light of the candle shyneth not in thee or the bright moone or the beamy starres but god of gods the light of lights the

sunne of iustice alwaies illuminateth thee
the white and immaculate lambe is thy cleere delightfull light
the king of kings is in the midst of thee his children round about him
there the quires of angels there the societie of the supernall cittizens there the sweete solemnitie of all those that returne from this wofull pilgrimage vnto thy ioyes
there the prouident company of the prophets there the twelue number of the apostles there the victorious host of innumerable martyrs there the sacred couent of the saints confessors there the true and perfect monks there the holy women that haue ouercome the pleasures of the world and the infirmities of theyr sexe
there the young men maidens that flying the snares of thys world with sacred manners haue past theyr time in all vertues there are the sheepe and lambes which haue already escaped the snares and pleasures of thys life all reioyce in theyr peculier mansions
the glory of euery one is different yet is the ioy of them all common

full and perfect charitie raigneth there because god is there all in all whom they beholde without ende and seeing him alwaies burne in his loue loue laude him
they praise and loue all theyr labour is the prayse of god end without defect without labor
happie were and truly happy for euerlasting if after the resolution of thys body of mine shall deserue to hear those canticles of celestiall melody which are sung in praise of the eternall king by those cittizens of the celestiall country troopes of blessed spirits
fortunate were and incredibly blessed if likewise might deserue to sing them and assist my king my god my guide and see him in his glory euen as hee hath dayned to promise saying father will that those who thou hast giuen me be with me that they may beholde my beauty and maiestie which had with thee before the beginning of the world

tell me pray thee brother what a day shal that be which shal knock at thy gate the course of this thy pilgrimage beeing ended that if

thou hast liued in the feare of god may from death transferre thee to immortality wherein others were wont to feare thou shalt beginne to lyft vp thy heade because thy is at hand

come out pray thee a little while sayth ierosme writing to eustochia the virgine fro the prison and depaint before thine eyes the rich reward of thy present labor which neyther eye hath seene nor eare heard neyther hath the hart of man conceiued the like
vvhat day shall that be when as the virgine mary shall meete thee attended by all the troopes of virgins who on the otherside of the the host of pharao being drowned who bearing a tymbrel shal sing to those that aunswere let vs sing to our lord for he hath gloriously honored vs he hath cast down the horse and the ryder into the sea
the shal the spouse himselfe meete her and say arise hast my loue my doue my delight and come now is the winter past the showre gone and cleared the flowers haue appeared in our land
then shall the angels

kewise reioyce say who is this at ascendeth fro the desert flowg with delights leaning vppon her
what shal the ioy be thy soule shall be affecd in that howre when before the rone of the blessed trinitie it shal led by the hands of the angels of the angell which was thee for thy guide by god thou liuedst to whom as a ythfull pledge thou wert vvhen as hee

together with associates shall publish thy good and those afflictions which thou hast sustained for the of god
luke writeth in his that when that holy tabitha was dead· all the poore stood about weeping and showing him the garments which tabitha made for the
by which peter being moued he hu~bly our lord for her and by prayer recald the deuout woman life
what ioy therefore vvhat shall thy soule feele whe blessed spirits shall stande thee and the thrones in the

sight of the diuine maiestie sh report all thy good deeds as it were out of a catalogue reci all thy thy thy fastings thy innocencie in lyfe sufferance in iniury patience in tribulation in delights temperance with all other thy vertues and good works which thou didst in thy what ioy shall be accomplished in thee at that time for all the good things in which thou ha busied thy selfe in this life time howe manifestly shalt thou then know the reward dignitie excellence of vertues there the obedient shal declare his victories there vertue shal receiue her reward

and good shall be affected with
besides how great shall be thy delight when as thy ship vnshaken arriued in a safe harbour thou sha behold with thine eyes thy long perrilous nauigations when as shalt see the tempests which a little· before thou wert tossed in the narrownesse of the wayes which hast ouercome and the incursi of pyrats theeues to which wert exposed and nowe hast safelie

escaped
there shalt thou sing the song of the prophet
had not our lord holpen me

my soule had welnie dwelt in hell especially after thou shalt see so many sinnes committed in the world so innumerable soules daily damned in hell yet amongst such a multitude of damned that god would that thou shouldst bee of the number of the elected and of those to whom that most blessed reward was allotted

vvhat reioycing shall there be to see the solemnities and tryumphes which are daily celebrated vpon the arriuall of new brothers who hauing ouercome the world atchiued the course of their pilgrimage and that happily arriue at length with the rest that they may be crowned what ioy shall it be to beholde how the rooms are supplied and the empty are filled with new enhabitants that the celestiall citty is builded that the walls of ierusalem are restored with what alacrity reioycing doe all that quire with mutual embraces receaue those who comming out of this worlde loaden with the spoiles

they haue extorted from the enemy of hasten to meete thee for hether vpon a triumphing horse shal the conquering woman enter who beeing as fraile as the vvorld hath ouercome the allurements of her flesh
hether tender virgins and innocent maydes who haue suffred martyrdome for christes sake and are honoured with a double tryumph of the world the flesh shal make hast hauing their heads crowned vvith purple roses intermixed with the purest and whitest lillies
hether daily come young men tryumphing in theyr first flower of youth with chyldren of vnripened age who haue theyr tender yeeres with discretion and other their vertues to receaue the reward of their purity
there shall they finde theyr friendes there shall they acknowledge theyr maisters there shall they salute their parents there their parents likewise shal embrace their sonnes wish their peace congratulate their present glory entertaine them with mutuall and charitable kisses
how sweet shal the fruite of vertue be then the

we loathed in this world as bitter sweet is the shadow in burning

sweete is coole spring to the wearied sweet is sleepe rest to the seruant but more sweet shall peace be to the saints this wearisome warre
after dangers a lasting securitie wearinesse a lasting rest of tribulations
then shall the war be ended then shall it no more needfull for a man to walke armed at all assayes

the chyldren of israell ascended into the lande of promise

as soone as they had entred the they layde theyr vveapons aside they forgot theyr feare and rumor of warre euery one dwelt without any suspition vnder his vine and vnder his and there was peace in all parts round about

there might the eyes wearied with watchings take theyr rest
heere securely might the vvatching prophet that stoode vppon his garde and had fixed steppes vppon the munition discend and forsake his station

heere was it lawfull for the blessed father ierosme to sursease his watchings and strokes with which he wearied his breast during his praiers day and night whilst with earnest endeuour and vndaunted mind he resisted the importunat temptations of sathan
heere shall the blessed soules feele no more the dreadfull armes of the bloody enemy heere shall be no place for the subtilty of that winding serpent hether pierceth not the eye of that venomous cockatrice neyther is the hisse of that auncient serpent heard but the gentle breath of the holy spirit this region and the glorie of god illuminateth this place this is the region of peace and security placed aboue al the elements whether neither foggs nor immeasurable tempests attaine
glorious things are spoken of thee thou cittie of god blessed are all those sayth toby who loue thee and who reioyce in thy peace
my soule blesse our lord because hee hath deliuered his citty of ierusalem
shal be blessed if there remaine some reliques of my seed to see the beauty

of ierusalem
the gates of ierusalem are builded of saphires smaragdes and all the circuites thereof are of precious stone of white and pure stone are all the streetes thereof and thorough the wayes thereof alleluiah shall be sung
pleasant country sweet glory blessed society what wil they doe so happy that they may enioy thee as elect
it seemeth to be a presumption if any man desire thee yet without thy desire no man can liue you sons of adam you blind and miserable posterity fearefull and lost sheepe if this be your pasture whether wend you what doe you why refuse you so great good for so little labour heare what saint augustine saith my soule saith he if wee should euery day suffer torments if endure hell it selfe for a long time that we might see christ in his glorie and accompany his saints were it not a thing woorthy to suffer all what so euer intollerable that wee might be made pertakers of so much good so much glory let therefore the deuills assault and prepare their temptations let fasts mortifie

the body let garments punish the flesh let labours grieue watchings dry let this man exclaime against mee let this and that man molest mee let colde make mee crooked my conscience murmure heate burne the stomack swell the countenaunce waxe pale let me be wholie infeebled let my life fayle in greefe and my yeeres in gronings let rottennes enter my bones abound vnderneath mee that may rest in the day of tribulation ascend in a to our people

for what shall be the glory of the iust howe great shal be the ioy of the saints when each one of theyr faces shall shine like the sun hetherto augustine

goe to nowe thou foolish louer of this seeke titles honors build proude houses and high pallaces extend the bounds of thine heritage gouerne if thou canst kingdoms and the whole world all they are not to be vvith the least of those thinges which the seruaunt of god dooth expect
for he is to receaue those things which the world cannot giue and shal reioyce

in those blessings which are for euer durable
thou with all thy riches together with the rich glutton shalt be buried in hell but he with lazarus shal be carried by the angels into abrahams bosome

of this matter see the
booke of prayer and meditation in saterday at nights meditation and in the first booke of the guide of a sinner chap
where you shall find many excellent things

the argument

in the infernal paines there is nothing founde that may comfort a man for euen as the lot of the good is vniuersall good which comprehendeth in it selfe all kindes of good so also is the lot of the wicked vniuersall which includeth in it all kindes of euill
for which cause euery one sence of the wicked shal be tortured with their peculier torments aunswerable to the quality of tbeir sinne committed without any dimunition or hope of pardon of terme or of time
for the paines

of hell shal be eternall intollerable infinite continuall

chap

truly the least of those blessings which hetherto vvee haue rehersed might suffice to ingender in our mindes the loue of vertue by which we may attaine so many goods
but if to this so immesurable of glory the horror of infnall punishments which are prepared for the wicked bee annexed who is he so and with vnbridled minde rebellious that forsaking vices will not vvillinglie embrace vertues for the impious and peruerse man cannot comfort himselfe with this voice be it am euill and sinfull what of that shal not enter the celestiall glory neyther shall reioyce with god in this consisteth all my punishment
for the rest care not because shal haue neither other punishment nor other glory
thou art deceiued my brother the matter is far otherwise for it is fatall and altogether necessary that one of these thinges

happen vnto thee eyther that thou raigne alwayes with god or that thou burne alwayes with the deuill in sempiternall fire
betweene these two extreames there is no meane
these in the figure of those two baskets which our lord shewed to ieremy the prophet before the gate of the temple are fitly shadowed
for the one of the was replenished with very good figges

such as those are of the first time and the other basket had very badde figges in it which coulde not be eaten because they were euill
our lord by thys spectacle would demonstrate to the prophet two kindes of men the one to whom he would extend his mercie the other whom according to his iustice hee would punish
the lot of those first men shal be excellent good neither can there be giuen better but of the other most euill then which worser may not be found

but that this may bee the better vnderstoode it is to be noted

that all the euils of this present life are onely single and therefore when we suffer one sence onely or one

member suffereth or if more at all suffer not as for example it appeareth in diuers infirmities of mans body for one hath his eye affected another is vexed with the the third is troubled with a weake stomacke the fourth is afflicted with the passion of the heart and by other diseases but none of them all is tormented in all his members at once but in some onely
notwithstanding wee daily see how great the greefe is how much the paine that one onely of these euils breedeth and how vnquiet nights hee leadeth that is only vexed with one of these paines although it were but the aking of one tooth

but let vs suppose there is a man who is tormented with such an euill that hee hath not one member neyther one interior or exterior sence free from most greeuous but that at one the same time hee suffereth most bitter dolors of head teeth stomack hart to speak all things in a that in all the knockles and ioynts of his body is pained with intollerable

greefes and that the same man being in so great passions euery member hauing his peculier dolors shold lie in his bedde stretched out what martirdome pray you what torments might be co~pared or equalled by these what may bee imagined more miserable then this man what more effectually might moue thee to a sympathy and harty and if thou shouldest elswhere a dogge in such manner afflicted striuing with death wouldst thou not be moued at least wise tho of thy selfe to such affliction my brother if these thinges may any wayes be co~pared together is that which the damned shal suffer in hel nor for one night but without end in all eternity
for euen as they with all members and sences offended god and offered them all as weapons of iniustice to serue sin so in sort god hath appointed that they all shal be punished seuerally by a peculier torment
there therefore vnchast and lasciuious eyes shal be afflicted with the sight of horrible deuils
the eares by

confused gnashing and groaning which shall resounde in this place the sent by intollerable stench exhaling out of this vncleane filthy and pestilent place the taste with raging hunger and burning thirst the touch and all members of the body shal bee tortured with colde and vnspeakable fire the imagination shall suffer by the apprehension of present euils but the memory by the remembrance of past the vnderstanding by the consideration of goods lost and mischiefes by which wretched as they are they are now ceazed

this multitude and diuersity of paine the holy scripture expresseth where it is said that in hell shal be hunger thirst complaint gnashings of teeth doleful swords spyrits created to do vengance worms serpents scorpions wormwood water mixt with gall spirits of tempests such like by which is signified the multitude of the terrible horrible punishments which are ordained for the damned in this lake
furthermore in this place there shalbe dark+nes as well interior as exterior aswel

the soule as in the body vvhich shall be thicker and darker the those of egypt

of which the scripture that they might be felt with handes
there shall be fire not such as ours is which burneth but for a time after a little while wanting is suddainly extinguished but it shalbe such a fire as is agreeable with the place which shall infinitely afflict neuer cease burning
if therefore all these things be true howe can it be that all they that belieue confesse no lesse can liue in such vnspeakable carelesnesse and slothfulnes what may the trouble be what labor so infinite that a man would not willingly sustaine· that he might at escape the least of these forenamed torments why therefore to auoyd this great and eternall euill doe we refuse a little that pleasant labor such as is the following of vertue

truly this one thing were sufficient to him that seriously co~sidered fixed his whole mind thought hereof to driue him into a swound and drawe him into melancholie
and if in so great torments there

were at the least some hope of releefe or decreement the damned might haue some consolation none of these thinges are granted the
for the gates shalbe shut by which either consolatio or the weakest hope may happily enter
in all the calamities of this world there is alwayes some refuge found out whereby those suffer at sometimes receiue some consolation nowe reason now time now friends· now others that haue suffered the like mishaps nowe at some hope of end yeeldeth the patient some abbridgment of his dolor but only in this kinde of torments the gates are wholy shut all the entrances of consolation are intercepted so that there is no meanes whereby those wretches may expect any refreshment or help neither fro heauen nor from earth nor from things present neither thinges to come neither fro any other thing
but whether soeuer they turne theyr eyes they shall see the arrowes shot them and suppose that all creatures haue conspired against them yea they

be cruell hangmen to themselues
this is the this is the greefe perplexity maketh those reprobate and men to lament and say by prophet
the paynes of death compassed mee round about

the of hell haue founde me out
for on what side soeuer they theyr eyes they shal find new causes greefe but no

the euangelist mathewe sayth that those virgins which were in a

entered into the bridegroomes house and that suddainlie the doore was shut
perpetuall vp· sempiternall pryson which shall neuer bee opened
as if it were saide the gate of pardon is shutte vp the gate of indulgence the gate of mercy the gate of consolation the gate of intercession the gate of hope the gate of grace and to conclude the gate of all goodnesse is shutte
sixe dayes and no more in times past

did the chyldren of israell gather manna but in the seuenth that is in the saboth there was none to be found

for which cause he ought to fast th day who before had not taken ca for the prouision thereof

for the cold saith the the sluggard would not plowe

hee shall therefore beg in sommer and it shall not be giuen vnto him
and in another place he that gathereth in the haruest

is a wise sonne but he that snorteth in the sommer is the sonne of confusion
but what more greater confusion may there bee founde then was that of the rich glutton who might haue obtained the aboundance of heauen by the crommes that fell from his table who vnwilling to giue a thing of so vile price came at last to such pouerty that in his extreame necessity he besought and shall alwaies seek and begging aske a drop of water and it shall neuer be giuen him
alwayes howling shal he cry out father abraham haue mercy vppon mee and send lazarus that he may dippe the typ of his finger in water to coole my tongue because am tormented in this flame

what lesse or more abiect thing might he aske hee durst not aske a

ssell or potte of water and that is more to be admired at hee not that hee shoulde dip his ole hand in water but onely the of his finger that with it alone might touch his tongue bewe the same but hee coulde not treat euen that little thing

it appeareth howe the gate of all consolation is utte and howe vniuersall this indiction and excommunication is so slight a petition could not admitted
for that cause wheer so euer they turne theyr eyes what part soeuer they extende eyr hands they shall find comfort no place no not a little

for euen as hee that falling into sea incompassed by the waues ding no place where he may fixe foote doth often but in vaine etch his hands on eyther side beuse he apprehendeth nothing but licquid and floating element deludeth him also these vnhappy wretches in at place when as they shall lye owned in these seas of infinite miries agonizing and fighting alwaies

with death shall neither fin remedy nor refreshment whereuppon they may ground themselues· this shall bee the greatest of all other paynes wherewith the damned shall be tormented in this place
for if this paine had a determinate time wherein it should take end although it were a thousand or rather a thousand thousand yeres euen by this it would breede some consolation for nothing is gre that hath an end but it shall no end
and therefore their punishment shall coequall the diuturnit of almightie gods eternitie and so long shall theyr miseries punishments continue as gods glory shal last and as long as god liueth so long shall they die and as god shall cease to be that hee is then they also shall no mo suffer that which they suffer

deadlie lyfe death knowe not by what to call thee whether life or death
if thou bee life why doo thou kill if death how doost alwayes endure will thee neyther of these names for

of them meane death or life ere is some good to bee founde in lyfe there is rest and in death end which two bring no little to such as bee in but thou hast neyther rest

vvhat therefore art thou thou both euill of lyfe and the of death
for of death thou torments vvithout end and om lyfe thou takest continuance any rest
god hath lyfe death of the goods were in them and what soeuer hee hath powred it into to the increase of paines and wherwith the most damned wretches shall be in hell
bitter potion dregges of the cuppe of our lorde

of which all the sinners of the earth shall drinke

for this cause my brother turne thine eyes and thy minde thys continuance or rather and like an vndefiled ruminate thys article of eternitie
but that thou mayst the do it with a more commodious

methode consider diligently the paines and afflictions of some sicke man he is tormented for one night especiallie if greefe bee great and the infirmi vehement
thou shalt see how often hee turnes and returnes himselfe in his bedde howe many anxieties hee hath what torment what agonies hee suffereth howe long the night seemeth vnto him how often hee telleth the clocke and how insupportable fitts hee suffereth euery howre
but all these the desire of the morning temperates vvhich notwithstanding very little or nothing at all can mittigate the least of his dolors

if those thinges wee haue spoken seeme to be and of manie are accounted so hainous what shal they be that attend on sinners in that eternall night which shall neyther haue day nor hope of succeeding morrow profound obscuritie eternall night night cursed by the mouth of god and all saints in which light shall be wanting without euer arising in which the light of the morning shal neuer spring

now therefore contemplate what nde of torment it shall be to liue waies in such a night not lying in bed as the sick man doth but a fornace boyling with horrible whose shoulders can suaine this burning flame matr worthy to be trembled at what so indurate and adamantiue at melteth not with the thought these punishments vvhich of sayth god by the prophet dwell with deuouring fire or of you shall dwell with scorchings if thou put but typ of thy finger into the fire fferest it to be there during the of one pater noster it will to be an intollerable torment great then shall the torment to bee perpetually scorched in whole body and minde in the of that liuing fire in compason of which our fire is but a one is there eyther science or in this world haue en a sound iudgement doe they what this speech or doe they happily beleeue these are poeticall fictions do

they thinke that these thinges doe concerne them or rather suppose they that they are spoken by others or produced to delude the time no brother no for nothing may be saide of this matter which fayth it selfe dooth not more manifestly testifie

but although those things which hetherto haue beene sayde are sufficient to ingender great dread and feare in vs yet shall they bee farre more effectuall if wee well and aduisedly consider the perpetuitie of these punishments
for if in them there were any terme or eyther release might be had at least wise after many thousand or many hundred thousande yeeres these wretches should finde out one certaine period of theyr plagues but why talke of eternitie which admitteth no other terme then that eternitie which god hath vvhich space is of such perpetuity that as a certaine famous doctor testifieth if any one of those damned shoulde but euery yeere but shed one materiall teare there shoulde more aboundance of water

from his eyes then all thys world were able to containe in concauitie what thinges may spoken or thought more terrie

and if all the torments vvhich in hell were but the prickes of all pynnes yet for their eternitie they suffice to moue a man vndertake with a ioyfull mind all tribulations crosses and miserie is in this world to flie these euerlasting agues
if that eternitie did dwell and abide in thy mind profitable shoulde it bee vnto

it is reported of a certaine man udious of worldly vanities who sometimes into the of that eternitie astonished a thing diuturnal that shal haue end after this manner with himselfe
there cannot man bee founde in this world of iudgement that woulde the emperie of the vvhole vnder that condition that for or fortie yeeres space hee might lye at his pleasure in a soft

bedde decked with roses and flowers which if it be so what folie what frenzie what madnes that of men to desire to embr for a thing of small moment a bning bedde in which they shall scorched eternally

this onely consideration was profitable to that man so great fruite in him that presentlie forsaking vice he addicted himselfe to vertues and in short time profited in them that he became holy man and a prelate of
church
what will these louers the worlde say that for the buzzing of one gnat passe whole nights out sleepe when they shall see selues layd along in this bed of buning fire and scorched on euery with liuing flames and that not a small time as for one month or yeeres space but for euer and euer

such sort of people the proph
esay speaketh to in these vvordes· vvhich of you can dwell with deuouring fire

which of you euerlasting scorchings shoulders shall be so

can beare so great a burthen long a time insensate people men blinded by the auncient who by his subtilties the whole earth
what you is more estranged from then that men should take re for things of smal consequence pertaine to this life and in a ing of so much moment are so considerate and careleslie

if wee see not these thinges what shall wee see what shall wee if wee feare not these things or what shall wee if wee not these thinges and if be thus howe can we but vertues with all alacritie how or difficult so euer they be that least wise wee may flie these

when therefore the torments eefes of which wee intreat are infinite meanes much more the any affliction orpaine thys lyfe and in continuance of without comparison more and it is also farrelesse that god requireth at our hands

what madnes is that of ours not to endure so small labours so molestations by which wee may estewe eternall torments who is hee that seeth not at that this is the greatest errour of this world yea and intollerable madnesse but the fruite thereof shalbe that the man that will not deliuer him selfe heere by small labours of a penitent lyfe from so many mischiefes shal there suffer eternal torments without any fruite or profit

the figure heereof wee haue in the fornace which king nabuchodonozer caused to bee kindled babylon whose flame was extended aboue the fornace nine fortie cubites but for the defect of one cubite it attayned not to the number of fifty which signifieth the yeere of iubile that wee may vnderstand that those eternal flame of babilon that is hell although measure they burne and cruelly torment the vnhappy damned yet shall they neuer come to that that they attaine the grace of the true iubile

chap

although vertue bee by it selfe and without it nothing may be laudable neither may there bee any thing more amiable and that more allureth men to good lyfe then the same yet so are the manners of this world corupted that the most part of men striue

who shall other in the race of iniquitie the desire of sin increaseth and shamefastnes dail decreaseth and so is publiquely set to sale that it preuaileth in all mens harts whereas innocence is not rare but nothing all
for which cause that which men ought to doe willingly for the loue of honestie and vertue to that now by manie reasons and arguments promises and threatnings they are partly without intermission to bee inuited partly to bee compelled that leauing vices they may followe vertues and renouncing the world with more cleannesse of life they may wholy and onely incline to the seruice of god

neyther is vertue so weake neyther this matter so poore naked that it wanteth diuers effectual arguments to incite and perswade the performance heereof
for we consider things past things present or things to come all of these eyther allure or compell vs to vertue and the seruice of god
of the future wee haue already spoken wheron if a man wil seriously think

like a cleane beast chewe the hee shal finde sharpe poynted goades infixed thereby in his mind
to things present and past pertaine blessings of god of which some wee haue already receiued wee receiue daily all which both by theyr goodnes compell vs obey god except wee will be ingrate inuite vs by their profit that the streames of benefits might flow more bountifully which otherwise would be dryed vp
for as bernard testifieth is a burning winde drying vp the fountaines of pietie the dewe of mercy and the floods of grace
yea and whe a certaine old souldiour beeing called in question was in danger to loose his cause hee publiquely came to augustus caesar praying him to stand by him in his cause caesar gaue him presently a selected aduocate out of his company and commended the clyent vnto him
hereat the souldier cried out but caesar when thou wert in danger in thy actian warre not for a deputy but fought for thee in person therwith discouered his scarrs
caesar was heereat

ashamed and vndertooke his cau fearing least he should not onely be thought proud but also vngrateful· such impressions and motiues haue the memory of benefites receaued· if so great a caesar were so much mooued by a common souldiers wounds receiued in his behalfe that he rewarded one curtesie with another why shoulde not say not the scarres but the death also of so great a maiesty wherby we are redeemed preuaile with vs most abiect wretched men and this one is so great a benefit as why should speake of the others which are infinite whether therefore wee respect honestie and profit whether their contraries heereby we are inuited thereby inforced to followe vertue and to addict our selues to the seruice of god

but the diuine benefits although they are infinite yet may they be reduced vnto fiue kindes namelie creation conseruation redemption iustification and predestination of which fiue kindes of benefites we wil orderly intreat
for this co~sideration is profitable for diuers

causes especially for three which are thus rehearsed by our authour

if we may belieue aristotle goodnes is amiable by it selfe

for euerie one is diligently fixed on the loue of himselfe
as therefore men by naturall inclination are louers of themselues and of theyr owne profit so when they manifestly perceiue that all that which they haue is of the meare liberality and voluntarie gift of god himselfe and their eternall benefactor they are suddainly inclined to the loue of him from whom they know theyr graces are receiued
hence it is that amongst all considerations which are auailable towards the attainement of the loue of god thys is most effectuall which setteth before our eyes the benefits
for euery benefite receiued by vs is as it were a fornace or burning fire kindling by his cleere flames the loue of almighty god in vs
and consequently to meditate on many benefits is to kindle many fires by whose ardent heate our harts are more and more inflamed with the loue of god

for this consideration is profitable to the ende that a man desirous to serue god may be the more excited to his seruice and become more forward when he shall consider the great obligation whereby he is by so many benefits which he receaued from god for if a a larke and other birds and beasts doe for this cause no otherwise then if they were beasts endued with reason aunswer and obay them in all those thinges which they are commaunded to doe how more requisite is it that they doe the like who haue receaued farre more benefits and haue greater iudgement to acknowledge the same
for when a man with great attention reckoneth vp with himselfe of the one part the multitude of the benefites which he hath receaued from god and on the other part calleth to remembrance the multitude of sinnes by which hee requiteth the diuine bounty howe can hee but blush howe can hee but setting the white by the blacke knowe which is the better that is not vnderstand the greatnesse of his malice compared

with the greatnes of gods goodnes which bounty hath not so manie yeares intermitted to doe good him that hath neuer ceased to perseuer in wickednes

the argument
by reason of the benefits of our creation we are bound to serue god in body and soule for according to the law a man oweth all that which he hath receaued to him from whom hee hath receaued it
god created the body and the soule hee created vs men and to an excellent end
besides he not onely created vs but doth daily perfect vs for euerie thing that· hath his beginning must his perfection fro thence whence began and hence groweth the

chap

the first of the benefits is creation of which since it is notorious to all men will only enforce this that a man for this onely cause is bound wholy to serue honour god who created him
for according to the

law a man is debter for all that which he hath receaued when therfore by this benefit he hath receiued his being that is his body with all his sences his soule with all her powers· it foloweth that he ought to imploy all these things in the seruice of his maker except he will be accounted a theefe vngratefull man him by who he hath bin blessed by so many benefits
for if a man shd build a house shold it not serue him that builded if any one plant a vinyard who shal gather the grape· shal it not be he yt planted the vine· and if the father haue a son to who shall he rather do seruice then to his father who begot him
for this it is that the law saith that it cann be imagined how much the father hath ouer his son which far extendeth it selfe that the father being in necessity may lawfully ll his son for in respect of that that he gaue his son that beeing which hee hath the father likewise hath gotten that power ouer him that it is lawfull for him to do with his son what him
if therfore so great be the dominion the authority so authentique

which the father hath ouer his son what prerogatiue shall his be from who the being of al parents are deriued· as well in heauen as in earth and if they as seneca saith who a good turne ought to imitate a fertill field yt yeeldeth much more it receaued how can we answer god after this manner of gratuity when as we cannot yeeld him more then we haue receaued fro him although we gaue it him also and if which giueth not more the he receaued obserueth not this law

what shal we say of him that giueth lesse then yt which was bestowed on him and if as aristotle testifieth we can not yeeld recompence to the gods our parents how shal we the blessings of god which hath bestowed more vpo vs then all the fathers wc are in the world and if it be a hainous offence for a son to be disobedie~t to his father what impiety shal it be to rebel against god who vnder so many bounties is our father yea in comparison of who no man amongst men deserueth the name of a father this is yt which iust+ly he expostulateth by his prophet

if therefore be your father saith he where is mine honour

and if be your lorde where is my feare· against the same ingratitude another prophet inueieth in these words
wicked and peruerse generation wilt thou requite thy lorde god thus thou foolish and insensate people what is he not thy father possessed thee and created thee

these are they that lift not vppe their eyes to heauen neither behold themselues being forgetfull of them
for if they did behold them they would seuerally aske of themselues and endeuour to know what is their first originall what first beginning that is of whom they were made and to what ende they were created

for by the knowledge thereof they should at last attaine the knowledge of that which in deede they ought to doe
and because men doe it not they liue as if begotten of themselues

after which manner liued that accursed king of egipt whom god threatned by his prophet saying behold come to thee pharao king of egipt

thou great dragon that

liest in the midst of thy floods and sayst it is my flood made it for
after this manner speake they who forgetting their creator as that created by themselues doe not acknowledge their maker
did angustine who by knowledge of his beginning the of his creator· saying in of his priuate and to my selfe and ened into my selfe

and to my what art thou and my self a reasonable man· and began to discusse that was and sayd whence comes this so named creature my lord god whence but from thee thou madest me not my selfe
who art thou euen he by whom liue he by whom all thinges liue
who art thou thou lorde my god true onely omnipotent and eternall· that alwaies liuest and nothing dieth in thee tell me thine humble seruant my god tell thou mercifull to me a miscreant tell pray thee for thy mercy sake whence is this liuing creature but of thee shall any man be the maker of his

selfe is life and being drawne from any other but thy selfe art not thou the chiefe good from whence all being is for whatsoeuer is is from thee because without thee there is nothing
art thou not the fountaine of life from whom floweth all life for what so euer lyueth liueth by thee because without thee nothing lyueth
thou therefore lord madest all things shall then aske who made mee thou lord madest me without whom nothing is made
thou art my maker thy workmanship
giue thee thankes lord my god by whom liue and by whom all thinges liue
giue thee thankes my creatour because thy handes made mee and fashioned me
giue thee thankes my light because thou hast illuminated mee and haue found thee and my selfe

vvhen therefore thou layest in this confusion darknesse and profundity of nullity as it be sayde it pleased the diuine bounty and without any merrit of thine of his meere grace to shewe in thee his vertue and omnipotencie and

by his mighty hand to take thee out of obscurities and that depth of confusion to bring thee not being to a beeing and create thee that thou mightest be a
yet would hee not as saint augustine that thou shouldst be made like a stone like a birde or like a serpent but according to the similitude of a man which is the noblest of all the creatures of the worlde
hee gaue thee that beeing which nowe thou art hee composed and thy body with a certaine singuler harmony and adorned all the parts therefore as well the members as the sences with so admirable perfection and prouidence that one of them if it be well looked into are the arguments of great and greater benefits
this is that benefitte which blessed iob acknovvledged vvith an humble heart when hee sayde thy hands made mee lord and fashioned me in euery part
remember pray thee that thou madest mee as of durt and shalt reduce mee into ashes with skinne and flesh

hast thou cloathed me with bones and nerues thou compactedst me· life and mercy thou gauest me and visitation hath kept my spirit but what shall say of the nobility of thy soule and the excellencie of the end for which it was created and of the image and capacity that it hath the image thereof is the image of god himselfe
for there is not any thing to be found vppon the earth more like to god and by which wee grow more easely and manifestly into the knowledge of god then is mans soule
for which cause those auncient philosophers but especially anaxagoras

found out no other name that becam god more then that they called him mind which is naught else then if they should haue said a reasonable soule

and that for the great similitude which they founde betweene god and the soule
it groweth that the essence or substance of the soule can be comprehended by no vnderstanding for in that it is so like the substance which since in this life cannot be vnderstoode no otherwise may the

other be vnderstoode or comprehended

besides the end to which so noble a creature was made is euery way correspondent to the nobility thereof for it is most certaine that the soule was created that it might be pertaker of incomprehensible glorie and diuine felicity that it might dwell in the house of god enioy the same goods with god and reioyce with the same ioy hee doth and be cloathed with the same garment of immortality and raigne with him for euer
and from hence draweth the soule that admirable capacity which she hath which is so great that all creatures and the riches of this world gathered in one are not sufficient to fill the bosome of the capacity thereof yea so farre are they from filling it as is a graine of millet in respect of the engine of the whole world

me therefore my brother what shall we returne our lord for great a benefit what may recompence our good god for much goodnes if wee are much indebted to our carnall parents

because in some respects they were coactours in the accomplishment and compacting of this our body how much more stand wee bound to our eternall father who with them formed our bodies and without them our soules our soule say which by many degrees is more noble and excellent then our body and our body should be nothing but a very stinking dunghill what else are the parents but certaine instruments by whose weake helpe god buildeth this body
if therefore thou owest so much to the meanes how much shalt thou owe to the that made it and if thou acknowledgest thy selfe to be indebted to him that onely in one part of the work shewed himselfe industrious how much shalt thou be indebted to him that consumated the whole worke
if the sword be in such honour with thee whereby the citty was ouercome in what esteeme shall the king himselfe bee that ouercame it

for it is to be vnderstoode that thinges which are borne according

to our common manner of speaking are not straight bred in all perfection
for they haue manie thinges perfect yet are there manie thinges defectiue in them which after are perfected
but that perfection must hee adde who the worke so that to the cause that gaue the beginning of it pertayneth also to giue the complement of the thing being

hence it is that all effects in their kinde are conuerted to theyr causes and from them receaue theyr last perfections
the plantes labour in what they may to seeke the sunne and that they may fixe theyr rootes in the earth which brought them the fishes also issue not from the water which them the chicken excluded from his egge presently clicketh her selfe vnder the winges of a henne and follovveth her shee goes
the lyke dooth the lambe which is no sooner eaned but that presently it hastneth to the dugge of the ewe and if a thousand sheepe were of the

same fleece and colour yet doo he know his proper dam and with her goeth alwayes as if hee sayde
from hence haue receaued what haue hence will fetch that which want
that almost in all naturall things is of force and amongst the artificiall also it would grow in vse if they had either sence or motion
if a paynter in finishing a picture should leaue the eyes imperfect and if the saide picture haue vnderstanding or were admonished of that which was wanting in it what thinkest thou it would doe whether would it goe sure it is it would not repaire to the pallace of the king or to any other prince for they cannot satisfie his desire but would returne to the house of the first and there would request him to make it perfect and consumate the worke which he had

tell me reasonable man cause there is thou shouldst not doe that which vnreasonable creatures doe for thou art not as yet perfect many thinges are defectiue in thee thou wantest many thinges as yet

before thou be compleat perfect
the first patterne as they say is but the beauty as yet and the elegancie of the worke is wanting which the continuall appetite of nature it selfe doth most openly approoue which alwaies as it were feeling her necessity doth continuallie sigh and carefully seeke that which wanteth

god would preuent thee with famine that beeing enforced by this necessity he might make thee enter by the right gate and build thy selfe him therefore that made thee
hee would not there presently absolue thee from condition or make thee perfect and for that cause hee would not suddainly enritch thee
and this would he thus doe not because he was a niggard but because he was bountifull knowing that it was good for thee to be such a one not that thou shouldst be poore but humble not that thou shouldst alwaies want but that thou shouldst alwaies haue respect vnto him
if thou art blind poore and in many things why hast not recourse to thy father that

created thee and to the painter that shadowed thee that he might perfect that which is see how ready in this king dauid was

thy hands saith hee made mee and created me giue me vnderstanding that may learne thy commaundements

as if he said thy hands lord made all that good which is in me but this thy worke and patterne is not euery wayes absolute the eyes of my minde amongst the rest are not yet perfect haue not yet the light by meanes wherof may discerne what want and what is necessarie for me
but of whom shall require that which want but of him that gaue that which haue that to whom the beginnings are due the ends also may be deuoted
giue mee therefore lord that light illuminate the eyes of this blinde borne that with them may acknowledge thee and so that may be perfected which thou begannest in mee

if therfore it pertaine to our lord to giue this last perfection to the

vnderstanding it pertaineth also vnto him to the same to the will and other powers of the soule that by this meanes the forme may be finished by the same that began it

the argument
as wee are not created without god so wee not without him for hee that created vs likewise conserueth vs our whole life therefore dependeth on him
hee giueth all good thinges to vs and driueth all mischiefes from vs for that cause all creatures visible and inuisible are created to attend vs wee ought therefore in like sort to serue god for this benefite as for the precedent which except we doe wee are woorse then beastes themselues who acknowledge their benefactours

chap

there are many mothers to be found who thinke they haue sufficiently discharged theyr duty if they bring

forth their children with paine so that vnwilling to take vppon them the troubles of suckling and nursing them themselues they seeke out nurse to whose charge they may commit the fruite of their wombes
god dealeth not in like sort by vs but he vndertaketh in himselfe all the trouble so that hee is both the mother which beare vs the nurse that suckleth vs with the milke and beneuolence of his prouidence
euen as he by his prophet saying and like the foster father of ephraim

beare them in mine armes
hee therefore that conserueth vs is the maker of vs all and as without him nothing is made so without protection all thinges should necessarily perish and come to nothing as it appeareth by the psalmes
and
euen as the whole motion of the clocke dependeth on the wheeles which by th motion turneth all the whole work· so that when one wheele seaseth a the rest of the clocke is at a stand and out of frame so the whole masse of this great engine of the world hangeth onely by the waight

of the diuine prouidence so as if that cease all the whole compact of this world ceaseth also

but if thou wilt diligently consider howe many benefits shalt thou finde included in this one for euen as many moments and poynts of time as thy life hath had hath and shall haue so many parts are there of this benefit for that in no one of these shouldst thou either liue or be if god had turned his eyes fro thee
all creatures what soeuer they be in this world are the parts of this benefite because wee see all of them haue their beeing and ayme to this end that they should serue and bee accommodate to our vse for after this manner the heauen is thine and the earth the sunne the moone the starres the sea fishes byrdes beasts trees plants and to speake in a word all thinges what soeuer are created are deuoted to thy seruice vvhich in his psalmes the kingly prophet wondereth at

neither content that he had created all visible creatures to our vse his further will was also through his immesurable mercy that all invisible

creatures such as are those noble intelligences which are alwayes standing before the presence of god and behold his diuine face should serue for our vses
for all the angels as paule testifieth are administring spirits sent to take charge ouer those who shall possesse the heritage of saluation
all the world is imployed in thy seruice to the end that thou likewise shouldst be busied in the seruice of god who woulde not that any thing should be created eyther aboue or vnder the heauens that should not serue for thy profit that thou likewise mightst wholy serue vnder his empery

vvhat soeuer is founde vnder heauen·

eyther is for the vse of man or to the vse of that thing which serueth man
for although man to speak properly doe not eate flies which flie in the ayre yet feedeth he on other birds which are sustained by those flies althogh he eate not the weeds of the field yet nourisheth he himselfe by those diuers kinds of beasts which are pastured by those herbes
turne returne thine eyes

into all the clymes corners of the world and thou shalt see howe spacious the bounds are of thy riches how opulent thine inheritance is
all that which walketh on the earth swymmeth in the seas flyeth in the ayre shineth in the heauens is thine
but all these are the benefits of god and the workes of his prouidence and mirrors of his beauty the testimonies of his mercy the sparks of his charitie and the exemplifications of his liberalitie
see how many cryers preachers god sendeth vnto thee that thou mayst know him
all that are in heauen and in earth saith augustine tell me that must loue thee my god and cease not to cry out the like to all men that no man may be excused

yf thou hast eares to vnderstand the voyces of creatures thou shalt manifestly perceaue howe all of them doe together teach thee to loue god
for all they in silence doe protest that they were made for thy benefit that thou for thy selfe for them shouldst serue their and thine own lord
the heauen saith giue thee light by day by night

thorow the ministery of moone starres preuent least thou shouldst walke in darknes and sundry influences sende downe that diuers things may grow and increase least thou shouldst die with famine
the ayre sayth apply my selfe that thou maist breathe into me coole thee temperate thine internall heate least it consume thee haue diuers kindes of byrds in me that by their variety and pulchritude should delight thine eyes by theyr songs thine eares and by their taste thy palate

the water saith serue thee with my raines and showres according to the fixed seasons of the yeere with my floods and fountaines also that thou mayst coole thee bring foorth and nourish diuers kinde of fishes that they may bee meate for thee
water thy seede thy gardens and fruitfull trees that thou mightst by all them be nourished
yeelde thee passage through the midst of the sea that thou mayst traffique through the whole world and that thou mightest annexe to thy riches the riches of another world or hemisphere

what thinkest thou the earth will say which is the common mother of all as it were the shop or tauerne of all things naturall
she truly and that not without cause shall say sustaine thee an vnprofitable burthen beare thee like a mother in mine armes prouide thee of necessaries sustaine thee with the fruites of my wombe haue communion or participation with all other elements with all the heauens and from euery one of the influences doe cull out choose benefites to fructifie for thee finally like a good mother neyther in lyfe nor in death forsake thee for in life suffer thee to trample me thy feete sustaine thee giue thee in death a place of rest hide thee in my bowels
what need many wordes the whole vvorlde with a loude voyce cryeth behold how my lord and creator intirelie loueth thee who hath created mee for thy loue would that should serue thee thou likewise shouldst serue him that gaue mee to thee and created thee for himselfe

these are man the voices of all

creatures consider now that there is none so absurd deafnes as to these voyces and to be vngratefull for so many and great benefits
if thou hast receaued a good turn pay thy due in thanksgiuing that thou haue no cause to bee plagued with the scourge of ingratitude for euery creature as a certaine doctor hath wel noted speakes to a man in three wordes take restore and beware that is take a benefite restore that thou owest beware except thou restore the punishme~t
is it possible for thee christian that without intermission receiuest these benefits that sometimes thou sholdst not lift vp thine eyes to heauen that thou maist see who hee is who giueth thee so many good things tell if thou shouldst happen being wearied in thy iourney to rest at the foote of some tower greatly afflicted wt hunger thirst· that there were one in the tower should send thee meate drinke as much as thou wouldst require couldst thou containe thy selfe but that thou wouldst lift vp thine eyes somtimes that thou mightst see who

hee was that had so well deserued at thy handes thinke truly that thou couldst not
what els doth god his highest heauen but without intermission poure down his benefits vpon thee
shew me any thing smal or great that is not giuen fro aboue by the speciall prouidence of god why therefore somtimes liftest thou not vp thy eyes to heauen that thou maist acknowledge loue so liberall a lord continual benefactor what other thing is intended by this carelesnes but that men shewe that they haue laide aside the nature of men are degenerated into vnreasonable creatures for in this we resemble hogs feeding vnder an oake who whilst their keeper ascendeth the tree and with his whip or staffe beateth downe the acornes are so much busied in eating grunting beating one another fro the mast as that they mark not who gaue them the meat neither know they how to loop vp that they may see fro whose handes that benefite descended
vngratful sons of adam who besides the light of reason hauing theyr shapes erect and faces formed to

behold the heauens yet wil not lift vp their eyes and mindes that they may see acknowledge theyr benefactor and giue him thankes for his goodnes

the lawe of gratuitie is so generall and so well liking vnto god that in the very beasts themselues he would this inclination should be imprinted as we may manifestly behold in sundry examples
vvhat is more fierce then the lyon

yet appian writeth that androdus the a senators seruaunt and a fugitiue was many yeeres nourished by a lyon whose wounded foote hee had cured
the same man beeing long after that apprehended and brought to rome and condemned to the beastes and opposed to the sayd lyon which by good hap was likewise taken and brought to rome was acknowledged and saued by him both the slaue and the lyon receaued theyr liberty and alwayes after liued together in great amitie
the lyke also plinie writeth to haue hapned to helpus the samian by a lion

of the gratuity of horses the said pliny

reporteth that some there haue beene that lamented theyr maisters death

and that shedde teares for theyr want

when king nicomedes was slaine his horse starued himselfe to death
some reuenged the death of theyr maisters with striking and byting
these thinges are of small moment if we compare them with the fidelitie friendship and gratitude of doggs of which plinie reporteth admirable things

if therefore beasts in who there is no reason but onely a sparckle of a certaine naturall instinct by which they acknowledge a benefite are so grateful and in all things that in the lyeth helpe obey and serue theyr benefactors howe can it be that a man that is blessed with such a light to acknowledge receiued benefites should be so carelesse so slightly should forget him from whom so many benefits are deriued if it be such a haynous offence not to loue this lord god what shall it bee to offend him and to violate his commaundements can it bee possible man that thou shouldest haue

hands to offend those handes which haue beene so liberall towards thee that euen for thy sake they haue at the last been fastned to the crosse

when that lasciuious and shamelesse woman allured the holy prosphet ioseph to adultery and sollicited him to bee vnfaithfull to his lord and maister the chast young man defended after thys manner behold my maister hath deliuered all things into my hands not knowing what hee hath in his house neyther is there any thing which is not at my commaund beside thy selfe who art his wife how therefore can doe this wickednes and sinne against my maister as if he should say if my lord bee so good and liberall towards me if he hath committed all that is his to my trust if hee hath dignified mee with such honor how can who am tied vnto him by so many offices of kindnes haue my hands ready to offend so good a maister in vvhich place it is to be noted that hee was not content to say it beco~meth me not to offende thee or must not doe it but he sayd how may do

this euill and so foorth signifying that the greatnes of the benefites ought not only to restraine the wil but also the power and take away the force likewise to offende our lord god in any thing

that man had credited all that he had in iosephs hand and god hath committed that which hee hath to thee
compare nowe those thinges that god hath with those things which that man had and see howe farre greater more excellent they be then those which the other possessed redoubled are those which thou receauest from god if thou compare them with that which ioseph receaued from that man
tell mee pray thee what faculties what riches hath god which hee hath not communicated with thee heauen earth moone starres seas floods fowles fishes trees liuing creatures to conclude all that that is found vnder heauen is in thy hands
what not only those things which are vnder heauen are in thy power but also those things that are aboue the heauens namely the glory of them and eternall goodnes

all thinges are yours sayth the apostle whether it be paule or apollo or cephas or the worlde or life or death or thinges present or things to come for all thinges are yours that is ordained for your saluation

but what if say that thou hast not onely those things which are aboue the heauens but that the very lord also of all heauens is endowed to thee after a thousand manners hee is giuen thee as a father as a tutor as a sauiour as a maister he is thy phisition he is the reward of thy redemption he is thy example thy helpe thy remedy and thy keeper
to conclude the father hath vs his sonne the sonne hath deserued for vs the holy ghost whom the father the sonne sendeth from whom all good gyfts proceede

vvhen therefore it is more then truth that god hath deliuered all that he hath into thy hands how can it bee that thou shouldst haue handes to prouoake him vvhat thinkest thou it may bee suffered that thou shouldst be ingrate to such

a gracious father and a benefactor so liberall truly this seemeth to be a most haynous offence but if to this ingratitude thou annex contempt of thy benefactour and iniurie or contempt howe inexpiable a crime wil that be held if that yong man of whom spake before thought himselfe so bound that he had no power to offende him· that had committed all the substance of his house into his bands how shalt thou finde any force in thy selfe to offend him who gaue thee heauen earth and himselfe

the argument
the benefit of predestination is the first and greatest of all benefits and which is meerely giuen gratis without any precedent merrit
the greatnes therefore of this benefit and all those things which pertaine therevnto greatly prouoke a man to serue god and to be dutifull vnto him

chap

amongst the diuine benefites also predestination or election is to be nu~bred which as it is the first so also it is

the most excellentest and altogether necessary for our saluation
but this benefite is onely theyrs whom god hath chosen from the beginning to take possession of the eternall beatitude and the heauenly kingdome
for which benefite the apostle as well for himselfe as for all the elect giueth him thanks in these wordes blessed bee god and the father of our lord iesus christ

who hath predestinated vs in the adoption of his sonnes through iesus christ
the kingly prophet co~mendeth that benefit likewise when he saith
blessed is he who thou hast chosen

lord and hast taken to inhabite in thy courts
deseruedly therefore may this benefite be called the benefit of benefits and the grace of graces· it is the grace of graces because it is giuen before all merrite of gods onely infinite goodnes and liberalitie who setting a part iniuries nay rather giuing to euery one helpe to saluation· imparteth more aboundantly to some the greatnes of his mercy like an absolute liberall lorde of his riches and it is the benefit of benefits not only because

it is greater then the rest but for that it is the cause and foundation of all other benefits also
for when as a man is chosen to glorie by meanes of this benefite god presently imparteth to him other benefites also which are required towards the attaynment of this glorie euen as he testifieth by his prophet saying in perpetuall charitie haue loued thee therefore in mercie haue drawne thee vnto mee

that is thou oughtest not to bee ignorant that called thee to my grace that by the same thou mightest attayne my glory
but the apostle speaketh of this benefit more plainely when hee sayth because those whom hee those likewise hee predestinated to bee made conformable to the image of his sonne that hee might bee the first begotten among many bretheren
those therefore whom he hath predestinated those also hee hath called and whom hee hath called them also hath hee iustified and those whom hee hath iustified them also hath he glorified

the reason thereof is that our lord disposing all things sweetly orderly after he hath vouchsafed to choose any one to his glory for that grace he conferreth diuers others for he giueth all those things which are pertinent toward the attainment of that first grace
euen as the father that bringeth vp his sonne eyther to make him a priest or a doctor causeth him from his infancie to be exercised in ecclesiastical affaires or brought vp in diuiner studdies directeth all the course of his life to that intended and purposed end so likewise that father after hee hath chosen any man to the communion of his glory hee directeth him by his fatherly care to the way of iustice which bringeth him to that glory and in the same doth faithfully conduct his elected till he attaine the desired end
for this so great and excellent benefite they ought to yeelde our lord thankes who acknowledge any notable fruit of this benefite in themselues
for let vs grant that this secrete is hidden from mortall eyes yet whereas certaine signes of iustification are

known there also the signes of predestination or election may be had
for as amongst the signes of iustification amendement of life is not the least so amongst the signes of election the greatest is perseuerance in good life

which beeing thus wey pray thee with thy selfe man vnder howe great an assurance our lorde holdeth thee bound vnto him for this immesurable benefite namely to bee registred in that booke of which our redeemer sayde to his apostles doe not reioyce in thys that spirits are subiected vnto you but reioyce because your names are written in the booke of life
howe immesurable therefore is this benefite to be beloued and from eternitie elected from which god was god to rest in his most sweet bosome euen from the yeeres of eternitie to be accounted the adoptiue sonne of god then as his naturall sonne was begotten in the brightnes of his saints who were present in his diuine vnderstanding attentiuely therfore consider all the circumstances of this election and

thou shalt finde euery one of them to be singuler benefites yea that great ones also and such as tye thee vnder newe couenaunts
consider first of all his dignitie who choase thee who is god himselfe blessed and infinitely rich who neither needeth thine nor any other mans riches
wey howe vnwoorthy hee is who is chosen if you consider quality and nature for is a miserable and mortall creature subiect to all infirmities miseries and pouertie of this life guiltie of the punishments of hell aswell for others as his owne sin also

thirdly apprehend howe excellent the election is after that thou art chosen to so hie an end then which there can be no greater that is that thou mightest be made the sonne of god the heyre of his kingdome and pertaker of his glorie
fourthly attend howe free th election is when as it is as haue said aboue all thy of gods onely free will and goodnesse and as the apostle sayth by the glorie and prayse of gods liberalitie and his especiall grace· now a benefite

the more free it is by so much the more holdeth it a man obliged

fiftly the antiquity of this election is to bee considered for it began not with the constitution of the world but is more ancient then the world it selfe
yea it is of the same age that god himselfe is who as he is from all eternity so from eternity loued he his elect whom he beholdeth with his fatherly and truly benigne eyes remembring himselfe alwayes to what an excellent good he hath and predestinated them

sixtly the rarenes of the reward is to bee considered since that amongst so many nations of barbarous people and amidst so great a multitude of damned men our lorde would vouchsafe to call thee to so blessed a lot that thou shouldest bee of the number of those which were chosen to euerlasting life and that therefore he seperated thee from the masse of corruption of mankinde co~demned for sinnes and hath changed thee from the leuen of corruption into the breade of angels

in this consideration a few things shall be found which may be written and many things which may be weyed in minde that the elected may be gratefull to our lorde god for the perticularitie of this benefit which is so much the greater by how much the number of the elect is lesser and of those which are to be damned greater the number of whom as salomon affirmeth is infinite

but if none of these things moue thee yet at let the greatnes of the expence which our most liberall lorde had determined to make by reason of this benefite moue thee
such as is the lyfe of his onely begotten sonne and his blood shedde in the behalfe of thys benefit who had decreed from eternitie to send him into this world that hee might be the executor of this diuine determination
vvhich since it is so what time shalbe more conuenient and profitable to consider so great mercie of god vvhat tongue shall more plainlie expresse the same what hart vvith greater affection feele and more

intire sweetnes taste the same

finally with what seruices may the same bee recompenced vvith what loue may a man aunswere this diuine loue who will bee so vngratefull as to refuse now at length to loue him of whom from eternitie hee hath beene beloued who woulde change this friende for anie other what soeuer wherefore since that in holie scriptures a friend of so many yeres is so much praysed and had in estimation who woulde change the possession and grace of so great a friende for all the friendes of the worlde and if prescription or possession of time with memorie giueth him both right and authority who hath neyther what will thys eternall possession doe by which our lorde is possessed that by the title of this friendship wee may be reputed for his
by these it appeareth that there are no blessings to be founde in this world wh deserue to be exchanged with these neither are there so great euils which are not to bee endured for the loue of these benefites

who pray you is he could be so dull inconsiderate that beeing taught by diuine reuelation that a certain poore begger seeking his liuing from doore to dore were after this maner predestinat by god wold not kisse the earth wheron he troad would not giue him place woulde not hu~bling himselfe on his knees with all humility wish him al good gratify him in this maner most happy most blessed art thou one of that happy number of the elect shalt thou reioyce amongst the blessed troopes of angells shalt thou sing that celestial musique possesse that perpetual kingdom sha thou beholde that shining face of christ happy is day in which thou wert borne but much more happy that in which thou shalt die to the worlde for then shalt beginne to liue the life euerlasting
happy the breade which thou eatest blessed the earth which thou treadest vpon for it beareth an incomperable treasure blessed the which thou sufferest the necessity yt thee
for they open thee the way which

thee to eternall life what cloude of calamities and tribulations shal there be so thick which shal not vanish vnder so great a hope

these such like are the wordes we would vse speake to any man who wee certainly knew to be predestinated
for if a certaine that is like to bee heire of a great kingdome passeth by any all the inhabitants make hast to behold him they admire that blessed fortune according to the opinion of the world that thys you~g man hath befaln him because he is born the heire of a kingdome
howe much more therefore ought menne to admire this blessed lot namely that a man should be born without any of his merrit chosen not to bee a temporall king in this world but to raigne in heauen with god himselfe· for euer euer
by these things therefore my brother thou maist easily co~ceaue the great bond whereby al the elect are tied for this benefit to their lord elector fro which let no man suppose himselfe excluded if he will do his duty and not hinder himselfe

yea it shall be needfull as sa
peter warneth in all his workes to make sure his vocation election for we are assured that he that doth this shall be saued and we knowe also that gods grace fauour doth neuer leaue any man neyther will heereafter leaue any one destitute

the argument
the benefite of redemption exceedeth all eloquence and were rather to be adored then expressed rather men had neede of some certaine knowledge thereof
man by sinne was made like vnto the deuill god might haue left him in damnation like the deuill but hee would not hee turned his wrath into mercie hee sent not an angell but he himselfe comming after an vnspeakeable manner redeemed him
hee was admirable in his comming for that man is much indebted vnto god yet much more for the meanes of his redemption which comprehendeth the whole passion of christ
christ died not for one but for all this increaseth the debt

chap

it is recorded amongst ancient writers

of a famous painter that depainting the funeralls of a certaine kinges daughter shaddowed about the circuite of the heirse many of her kinsmen standing with sad and afflicted

lookes next them her mother more pensiue then the rest but when he came to delineate the father he couered his face with an artificial kind of shadow thereby art was deficient in this place by which new inuention hee expessed the greatnes of the dolor
after the same manner all our vnderstanding art eloquence are defectiue in declaring this vnspeakable benefite of our redemption
for which cause perhaps wee might haue done farre better if wee had worshipped the same with silence that in some maner by this deuice wee might expresse the greatnes thereof
the benefit of our creation is vnspeakable but of our redemption more admirable for god created all things with the onely beck of his will for mans redemption hee trauailed thirty and three yeeres he shed blood neyther had he either member or any sence which was not excruciate with a perticuler greefe
it seemeth therefore that an iniurie should be done to so glorious a mistery if any man shoulde imagine that he could expresse the same with

humane tongue what therefore doe shall speake or holde my peace must not be and cannot speake
howe may it bee that should conceale so immesurable mercy and howe may expresse a mistery so sublime adorable it is ingratitude to conceale it and to speake thereof it seemeth rashnes presumption
for which cause thee my god that whilst am to speak according to my rude vnderstanding of this thy immesurable glory thy holie spirit may moue and moderate my tongue like the penne of a ready writer
after that man was created setled in the paradise of in high dignity and yea by so much was bou~d to god by straight bonds by how much he had receaued more greater benefites at his hands he becam vndutiful rebellious· of those things from which he ought to haue take greater cause of loue towards his creator of the same he tooke greatest occasions to betray him
for that cause was hee thrust out of paradise thrust in exile yea allotted to infernal paines

to the end that hee that had made companion with the deuill in sinne should be also associate with him in punishment
helizeus the prophet said to his seruaunt giezi thou hast taken siluer rayments from naaman

therefore naamans leprosie shall cleaue vnto thee and thy seede for euer
such was the iudgement of god against man who whe he had affected the goods and riches of lucifer namelie his pride and ambition it was iust and requisite that he should be infected with the leprosie of the same lucifer which was the punishment of his pride
behold therefore man made like vnto the deuill

nowe the diuine iustice might haue left man by al right in this miserable estate euen as he left the deuil without any contradiction expostulation yet would hee not doe so but rather did the contrary chaning his wrath into mercy by how much the more iniury he had receiued by so much the more grace would he shew his loue to mankind
and whereas also he might haue repaired this ruine by an angell

archangel he would com himselfe
but how in what form cam he howe redeemed hee vs what humaine tongue wil expresse this vnto vs whe as he might haue com in maiesty glory he would not but he came in great humility pouertie
christ established such friendship betwixt god vs that not only god forgaue man all his sin receiued him into his fauour made him one and the same with him by a straight co~nexion of loue but that which exceedeth all greatnes he made such a similitude correspondence betwixt himselfe mans nature that amongst all thinges created there might no such co~formity be found as are the deitie and humanitie for they are not one the same only in loue grace but also in person

who durst euer but haue hoped that that so wide wound shold haue been closed after this manner who might euer haue imagined yt these two things· betwixt which there was so much difference of nature offence should so closely bee vnited not in one house not at one table not in one grace but in one and the

same person what two things may be thought more contrary the god and a sinner and what is more neerly annexed or more commixt then god and man there is nothg more high then god saith bnard is nothing more abiect of which man is foed notwithstanding god descended vppon the earth with such humilitie ascended with so much sublimitie fro the earth to god that what soeuer god did the same the earth is sayd to haue done whatsoeuer the earth suffered that likewise god suffered
who wold haue said to a man when hee was naked assertained that he had incurd the displeasure of our lord when hee sought retyring places in paradise wherin he might hide himselfe· who say woulde then haue said to him that the time should one day com wherein this so vild substance shold be vnited with god in one and the same person this vnion is so neere and faithfull that at such time as humanity was to be dissolued which was at the howre of his passion was rather strengthned then weakened

truly death might seperate the soule from the body which was the vnion of nature but neither could he separate god from the soule or draw him from the body for such was the vnion of the diuine person that what is apprehended once with so firme an vnion it neuer will forsake and all these god would so doe that by this benefite he might inflame vs with more loue towards him and by this example more straightly oblige vs vnto him

now therfore if thou art so much indebted to thy redeemer for that in his own proper person he would come to redeeme thee how much owest thou for the means it selfe by which hee redeemed thee vvhich meanes most assuredly was mixed with mighty griefes tribulations
truly it is a great benefite if anie king shoulde forgiue a thiefe that punishment which he ought to suffer for his offence
but that the king himselfe shoulde suffer himselfe to be tyed to the post and receiue the stroakes vppon his owne shoulders that shold be an vnspeakable a bounty beyond co~parison

ah my lord for the loue of mee thou wert borne in a stable ld in a harde manger for mee thou circumcized the eight day for me flying into egipt thou wert banished seauen whole yeares and for me thou sustainedst diuers persecuons and wert prouoked by diuers mockings and infinite iniuries
for my sake thou fastedst watchedst ranst hether and thether sweatedst weptst and enduredst all miseries in thine owne experience which my sinnes had deserued· when as yet thou wert without all sinne and deceite was not to be founde in thy lippes yea when thou hadst not offended but wert offended thou for my sake wert captiue and nowe presented before this nowe before that iudges trybunall seate before them wert thou falsly accused beaten with buffetings spet vpon mocked whipt crowned with thornes prouoked with blasphemies and lastly crucified

lift vp the eyes of thy minde to the crosse of his passion and see the stroakes behold the wounds· the dolours which the lord of maiestie

suffered there because euery one of the wounds each stripe and agonie are seuerall benefits and they most mighty ones behold that innocent body wholy besprinkled with blood full of wounds stripes altogether torne brused and broaken beholde the blood flowing from euery side
see that most holie head through too much waight bending and reposing on his shoulders see that diuine face which the angels desire to looke vppon how defiled it is watered with riuers of purple blood and one the one side faire gracious on the other foule and bespotted
behold the browe of that faire young man which was wont to delight the eyes of all those that beheld him howe now it hath lost the flower of all his fauour
behold the nazarean purer then milk

crimsonner then olde iuorie fairer then the saphire
his face is more blacke then coales so that his owne friends know him not looke vppon his pale mouth his blew lipps his tongue almost dumb how hee moueth them to obtaine remission and indulgence euen for those that

him
finally fixe thine eyes vpon all parts of his body and thou shalt not see any one of them free from stripes and dolours
from the sole of the foote to the crowne of the head there is nothing whole in him euery where thou behold wounds· stroakes and blewnesse
that most faire browe and eyes clearer then the sunne are now obscured blind and dead at the instant conflict of death
his eares which were wont to heare the heauenly now the slaunders reproaches and blasphemies of sinners his well formed armes and so long as that they can encompasse the whole world are now of ioynt distended vpo the
those hands which created the heauens and neuer did man iniurie are pierced with rough nailes and affixed to the crosse his feete which walked not in the wayes of are mortally wounded and transfixed
and aboue all this beholde on what bed hee lyeth and where that celestiall spouse sleepeth how narrow it is how hard it is not yeelding him a place

to rest or recline his head vpon
golden head how doe see thee for the loue of me so faint and wearied most holy body conceaued by the holy ghost how doe see thee for my sake so cruelly wounded and so hainously handled sweet and amiable breast what meaneth this so deepe wound why is this window opened what meaneth this aboundant issue of blood wretch that am how doe beholde thee pierced for my loue with so huge a speare rough vngentle crosse stretcht forth relax thy bowels that that rigour may relent which his natiuity gaue hard nailes doe not crucifie those his hands and feete come rather to mee and wound my heart for am hee who haue sinned hee hath not offended
good iesu what hast thou to doe with th se dolours· what alliance is there twixt thee this bitter death these this crosse

sayeth the prophet hys is another mans

his labour pertayneth vnto him
for what thing is more and from lyfe then death

from glory then punishment from exceeding sanctity and innocence then the image and similitude of a sinner truly that title of our lord and that figure is very farre estranged from thee

very iacob thou obtaynedst thy fathers blessing in another mans coate and a forraigne habite for assuming to thy selfe the similitude of a sinner thou hast gotten the victory ouer sinne

but if man it shall seeme vnto thee that thou art not indebted so much to god by reason that he died not for thee onely but for all the sinnes of the worlde beware least thou be not deceaued for so dyed he for all that hee died likewise for euery one in perticuler
for all those for whom he suffered are so subiect to his infinite wisedome and as if present obiect to his eyes as if all of them were comprehended in one
and vvith that his immeasurable charity he embraceth all in generall and euery one in special and so hath he shedde his blood for all as if for one
to conclude so great was his charity that as some saints say if one only amongst all men had been

guilty he would for him also haue ffered all that which he endured for the whole world
consider therfore and wey in thy minde howe much thou owest to this lord who did so much for thee and had done farre more if greater necessitie had required it
haynous ingratitude hardnes of mans hart truly thou art most flinty if thou art not affected with so many benefits if for so many dowers thou doost not bestowe thy selfe vpon him
there is not any thing found in this worlde hard which is not mollified by some cunning
mettalls melt with fire and by the same iron is made the hardnes of the adamant is broaken vvith goates blood but thou hart of man art harder then any stone harder then iron harder then adamant when as neither the infernal fire can break thy hardnes neither the cunning of the most mercifull father mollifie thee neither the blood of that immaculate lambe can make thee tractable

saint ambrose writeth of a certaine dog that barking and howling

a whole night long lamented his maister who was slaine by one of enemies
in the morning many men assembled about the course and amongst the rest he also arriued who had slaine the man
the dog beholding the murtherer him and vpon him began to bite him and by this meanes the offence of the was manifested
what wilt thou therefore say man if a dogge be so faithfull for a bitte of bread and so intirely loue his maister doth ingratitude so much please in the lawe of gratuitie thou wilt suffer thy selfe to be conquered by a dogge

and if this brute beast were incensed with so much ire against him that his maister why art not thou likewise incensed against those thy lord sauiour who are they forsooth thy sinnes were the causes of the death of the lorde
these cruell executioners had had so much force or power against christ except thy sinnes had armed them
vvhy art thou not therefore angry why whettest thou

thy furie those that slewe lorde vvhy is not thy loue encreased towardes him when as thou seest thy lorde slaine before ovvne eyes nay more for thy sake vvhy art thou not angry with thy sinnes which put him to death especially because thou knowest that there was no other en of all his savings deedes and nts then that hee might kindle in our hearts a wrath and hatred agnst sinne

he because he might slay and that hee might restraine power both of our handes and feete· hasting after iniquities hee would that his handes should bee fastned to the crosse
vvith what darest thou liue so that all christes labours and sweats shal be spent in vaine for thee whilst thou wilt remayne in that seruitude from which he deliuered thee by the shedding of hys precious bloode
it cannot bee but thou shouldst tremble at the very naming of sin when as thou seest that god suffered most terrible torments to the ende that hee might destroy

and abollish the same what could hee doe more to men headlong running after wickednes then that god himselfe should be sent to encounter them hanging on a crosse who will be so rash that he dare offende god when before him hee seeth both paradice open and hell with gaping mouth yea and which is farre greater then both to behold god hanging on a crosse· hee that is not mooued with this spectacle know not truly by what other thing he will be moued

all this chapter is taken partly out of the first booke of the guide of a sinner chap partly out of the first of prayer and meditation the chap
of the
tractate on which places he purposely handleth our redemption
thou shalt finde many things also touching this matter in the life of christ and in the booke of the catechisme

the argument

without the benefite of iustification all other benefits had nothing at all profited vs nay rather they had done

vs harme
now iustification is the worke of the holy ghost without which no man can be saued
iustification therefore is a great bond of our duty especially because it concludeth in it selfe so many and so great goods which are rehearsed in this chapter
moreouer iustification is a greater benefitte then creation
and howe a man may gather by certaine coniectures that he is iustified

chap

nothing at all had the rehearsed benefites profited vs if the blessings of vocation and iustification and sanctification had not followed
for that may ouerpasse the other with silence had beene in vaine and to our great mischiefe what vse had there beene of that onely and noble benefit of our redemption if iustification had not been annexed for euen as the plaister is of no vse if it be not applied to the wound or place affected had there beene no profit of this celestiall medicine except by

the meanes of this benefitte it had applied
this office principally pertayneth to the holy ghost to whom mans also attributed
now a man is iustified when by the vertue of this diuine spirit the chaines and of sinne being broken and rent a sunder he escapeth the dominion and tiranny of the deuill he is raised againe from death to life of a sinner he is made iust and of the sonne of malediction hee is made the sonne of god which can no wayes be done without the peculier helpe and succour of god the which our lorde testifieth in expresse wordes no man can come vnto mee

except my father drawe him
signifying heereby that neither free will nor the forces of humaine nature can of themselues deliuer a man from sinne and bring him vnto grace except the of the deuine power be assistant
euen as a stone of his nature falleth alwayes downwardes neyther can tend vpwardes without externall ayde so also a manne through the corruption of his sinne alwayes tendeth downward that is

falleth in loue and desireth earthlie things
but if he be to be erected lifted vpwards· that is raysed to loue and supernaturall desire hee had neede of the right hand of the omnipotent and diuine helpe

many benfites are contayned in this one
vvhen as therefore the consideration of thys benefite vehemently inciteth a man to gratitude desire of vertue will heere by the way expresse the great profites which this one onely good is wont to bring with it

first by it a man is reconciled to almightie god and is restored to his loue and friendship
for the first and greatest of all euills which begetteth mortall sinne in the soule is· it maketh a man enemie to god who whereas he is infinite goodnesse aboue all things hateth and detesteth sin

therefore sayth the prophet dauid

thou hatest all those that work thou shalt destroy them that speake lyes
this is the fountaine originall of all euills
fro this so perilous euill we are deliuered by means of iustification

by which we are reconciled to god and of his enemies made his friends and that not in the common degree of friendship but in the highest degree that may be found which is of the father towardes his sonne
this friendship saint iohn euangelist deseruedly co~mendeth when he saith
behold what charity god hath shewed you

that you are both benamed and be the sonnes of god· not content to haue said that wee are named he addeth also that wee be that the pufilanimity and little trust of men might manifestly know the beneficence liberality of god
and if in this world it be esteemed a thing of great moment if any man should be honoured by his superiours as by bishops kings princes or such like potentates pray you what shall it be to be well thought of by the highest prince the supreame father and the greatest lord in comparison of whom all the principalities dignities of this world are as if they were not

another benefit the other followeth that iustification deliuereth a man from the condemnation

of eternall punishment of which he was guilty for his sinnes
which how great a benefit it is he a sort knoweth that hath diligently the fift chapter placed before in which we haue rehearsed certayne sortes of punishments
from all those punishments god hath deliuered them whom he hath iustified all which after they are reconciled and receaued into his fauour are freed fro that wrath and paine of diuine reuenge

behold another benefit more spirituall which is the reformation and innouation of the inwarde manne which by sinne was defiled and disordered
for sinne doth not onely depriue the soule of god but spoileth it of all supernaturall fortitude and all the ritches and gifts of the holy ghost by which it was adorned decked and enritched and as soone as it is depriued from the graces of these goods it is wounded maimed and spoiled also of the naturall goods
for whereas a man is a reasonable creature and sinne is a worke made against nature and it is naturall that euery contrary destroy

his opposit it followeth that by how much more our sinns are multiplied· by so much the powers of the soule are destroyed troubled not in themselues but in theyr toward workings
after this manner doe sinnes make the soule miserable infirme slowe and instable to all goodnes but ready and prompt to all euill they make her weake to resist temptations and slowe to walke the way of the commaundements of our lord
they also depriue her of true liberty and of the spirit and make her captiue to the world the deuill the flesh and her owne appetites and after this manner shee liueth in harder captiuitie then that of babylon or egypt
besides all the spirituall sences of the minde are made slow so that they neither heare the voyces and diuine inspirations neither see the great that are prepared for them neither smell the sweet odor of vertue nor the woorthy examples of the saints nor taste how sweet our lord is nor feele his scourges nor acknowledge his benefites by which he prouoketh the to loue

and besides all this they take away the peace ioy of conscience extinguish the feruor of the spirit and leaue a man defiled lothsome deformed abhominable in the sight of god and all his saints
this benefite deliuereth vs from all these euils
for the abiss of diuine mercy is not content to haue pardoned our sinnes and to haue receiued man into his fauour except hee also expell all those euills which sinnes bring with them reforming renewing our inward man
after thys manner he healeth our woundes hee washeth our vncleannes he breaketh the bonds of sinners destroyeth the yoake of euill desires deliuereth vs fro the seruitude of the deuil mittigateth the fury of our peruerse affections restoreth vnto vs the tru liberty pulchritude of the soule giueth vs peace ioy of good conscience quickneth our interior sences· maketh them prompt to doe all goodnes slow to all wickednes
he maketh them strong to resist temptations of the deuill endoweth them with good works
to conclude so absolutely renueth hee

and repaireth he our interiour man with all his powers as the apostle feareth not to call such kind of men iustified renewed or rather creatures
this renouation is so great that when it is giuen by baptisme it is called regeneration and when it is restored by repentance it is called resurrection not onely because the soule is raised from the death of sinne to the life of grace but because in a certaine manner it imitateth the beauty of the future resurrection
and that is so true that no tongue of man is sufficient to expresse the beauty of the iustified soule but only that spirit knoweth this that beautifieth the same and maketh it his temple lodgeth himselfe in it

wherefore if thou compare all the ritches of this world all his honours all his naturall graces and all his acquired vertues with the beautie and ritches of the soule that is iustified all of them shall seeme most obscure vild in comparison thereof
for as great difference as there is betwixt heauen and earth betweene the spirit and the bodie

betweene eternity and time so great also is founde betwixt the life of grace the lyfe of nature between the beauty of the soule and of the body betwixt the interior and exterior riches betweene spirituall and naturall fortitude
for all these are circumscribed by certaine termes are temporall and seeme only faire to the out ward eye to which the generall concourse of god is sufficient but to those other a perticuler supernaturall concourse is required neyther can they be called temporall where as they bring to eternity neither any wayes termed finite they deserue god in whose eyes they are so precious and of such value that by theyr beautie they prouoke god himselfe to loue
but whereas god might worke all these thinges by his onely presence he would not doe it but it pleased him to adorne the soule with infused vertues and with the
dowers of the holie spirit with which not the very essence of the soule it selfe but also all the powers thereof are inuested and adorned with these diuine habits

besides all these diuine benefites that eternall and infinite goodnesse of god annexeth an other namely the presence of the holy ghost or rather of the whole blessed trinitie which entreth into the iustified soule and commeth to inhabite in the same that it may teach her how to vse in due sort so great riches

like to a good father who not content to haue giuen his riches to his sonne giueth him a tutor also who knoweth howe to administer them well
so that euen as in the soule of a sinner vipers dragons and serpents inhabite who are the multitude of malignant spirits who haue taken vp their lodging in such a soule

as our sauiour in mathew affirmeth so contrariwise into the iustified soule the holy ghost with the whole sacred trinitie doe enter and casting out all monsters and infernall beasts

consecrateth the same for a temple for himselfe and placeth his seate there
as our lorde himselfe expresly testifieth in the gospell written by saint iohn

saying if any man loue mee hee wil obserue my sayings and my father

shall loue him and we will com vnto him make our mansion with him

by vertue of these wordes all the doctors as well ecclesiasticall as scholasticall doe confesse that the holy ghost himselfe truly and after a certaine speciall manner dooth dwell in the iustified soule distinguishing betwixt the holy ghost his gyfts saying moreouer that not onely these gifts of the holy ghost giuen but yt the holy ghost also giueth himselfe who entring into this soule maketh her his temple and habitation fixing his seate in same
hee therefore purgeth same sanctifieth decketh her with his vertues that shee may be a sufficient mansion wherein hee may inhabite

the aboue named benefites suffice not except another and that admirable be ioyned vnto the that all the iustified are made the lyuing members of our sauiour who were first but dead members for they dyd not receaue the from theyr lord head christ

hence doe orher and they very great prerogatiues and excellencies arise
for hence commeth it that gods onelie sonne loueth them as his owne members and hath no lesse care of them then of himselfe hee is no lesse solicitous for them then for his owne members without intermission hee powreth into them his vertues as the heade into his members
finally the eternl father beholdeth them with eyes no otherwise then the liuing members of his onely begotten sonne vnited with him concorporate by the participation of his spirit and therefore their acons are gratefull and pleasing as were the actions of the liuing members of his sonne who worketh them all goodnes
from the dignitie it proceedeth that when as these iustified require fauor at god handes they demaund it with grt confidence for they knowe th they aske the same not for themselues onely but also for the of god himselfe who in them and with them is continually honoured

neyther doe the diuine benefites heere take theyr end for to all the graces thys is annexed at the last to which all the other are disposed namely the right and possession of eternall lyfe which is giuen to the iustified
for euen as that our most mightie lorde in whom at once infinite iustice and mercies doe shine· adiudgeth all sinners which doe not repent them to eternall punishments so assumeth hee all truly penitent to eternall life

these the are the which that onely benefite of iustification comprehendeth in it selfe which iustification

saint augustine esteemeth more then creation for god created heauen earth by his onelie word but that hee might truly sanctifie man he his blood and suffered so many· and so diuers tortures for him
if therefore wee are indebted to this god such and so many wayes for our creation howe much more owe wee him for our sanctification which benefite by how much more greater labors and afflictions it is attained by so much the more it obligeth vs

but although a man doe not yet euidently know whether he be truly iustified yet euery one may haue great co~iectures of his iustification amongst the which this is not the least namely the ame~dment of life when as hee that was wont to perpetrate a thousand sinns in one day now committeth not one
hee that is such a one let him remember with what iust cause he is bound to serue such a sanctifier who redeemed him deliuered him from so many euils stored him with so many blessings as are hetherto
and if any man yet be entangled in the vngracious race of his life knowe not by what meanes god may more mooue him to forsake that condition then if he set before his eyes all the lls incommodities and perrils which sinnes bring with them which a little before haue beene numbred vp by vs also in shewing him the treasure of great benefites which spring from this incomparable blessing

the argument
the graces gifts of the and those wonderfull effects which they worke in vs are such and so many that whether a man will or no except hee will be altogether ingratefull hee ought in leauing his loose behauiour to intend the seruice of god
no lesse are the benefites of baptisme and most great bounties of the sacrament of the eucharist all which inuite vs to the amendment of our liues

chap

those things which we haue hetherto spoken comprehende not as yet all those kinds of benefits which the holy ghost worketh in the soule of a man that is iustified neyther is gods liberalitie concluded in those termes
for it suffiseth not the diuine spirit to haue led man in by the gate of iustice but after that man hath entred hee is likewise assisted by the same spirit and is led by the hand into all his wayes till

the waues of this stormy sea beeing hee attaine safe and secure to the hauen of saluation
for after that by the means of the foresaid benefite the holy ghost hath entred into the iustified soule hee sitteth not there idle it him not to grace the soule with his presence but with his vertue also hee sanctifieth the same working in her and with her whatsoeuer is conuenient for her saluation

hee sitteth there like the father of a familie in his house gouerning the same hee sitteth there like a maister in a schoole administring it like a gardner in his garden trimming it like a king in his kingdom ruling it like the sun in the world illuminating it finally like the soule in the body giuing him lyfe sence motion not as the forme in his matter but as the father of his familie in his houshold

what therefore is more blessed and more to bee desired then for a man to haue in such a guest such a guyde such a companion such a gouernour finallie such a tutor and helper who beeing

all in all worketh also all things in the soule in which it abideth
but especially like fire hee illuminateth our vnderstanding inflameth our will and exalteth vs from the earth vnto the heauens

hee like a doue maketh vs simple milde peaceable and friendes to all men
hee like a clowd cooleth vs and defendeth from the burning lust of the flesh and tempereth the madnes and fury of our passions
finally· hee like a hement winde mooueth and inclineth our will to all goodnes the same and drawing it away from all euill inclinations vntill last the iustified attaine that perfection that all the vices are hatefull vnto them they first loued and the vertues beloued which they hated
as dauid manifestly co~fesseth the same to haue chaunced vnto himselfe for hee sayth in a certaine place

that hee hated and abhorred iniquitie and in another place· that delighted in the way of of our lord

euen as in all
the reason was because the holie ghost had

illed into soule the wowood of earthly things and the honey of the diuine commaundements in which thou seest manifestly that all our blessings are to be ascribed to this holy spirit so that if wee decline from euill he is the cause if we doe good wee doe it by his meanes if we perseuer in goodnes by him wee and if reward be giuen for good by him it is giuen

heere also no small and matter offred vs to of the benefites of the sacraments which are but as it were the instruments of our iustification but especially of baptisme and the

for baptisme we are clensed from originall sinne deliuered from the power of the deuil made the of god and of his kingdom
in baptisme my brother christ espoused thy soule vnto himselfe and it with so high an order of which are grace vertue the gift of the ly ghost and others ornaments such as isaac rebecca

when hee tooke her to

wife
what therfore hast thou doe that thou shouldst deserue to receiue the least of these things how many thousand say not of men but of nations are excluded from these blessings by the iust iudgement of god what had become of thee if thou hadst beene borne amongst these nations yf thou hadst not attayned the true knowledge of god but hadst adored blocks stones howe much art thou indebted to thy lord god that amidst so great infinite a number of reprobates he would that thou shouldst be reckoned among the number of his elect bee borne amongst his chosed flocke bee nourished with the milke of the apostles and be made drunke with christes blood but if after the grace of this vocation· thou hast lost thine innocence of baptisme by thy recumbencie in sin behold it pleased our lord god to cal thee again the second third or more often times what therefore shalt thou owe vnto him how many benefits doth thys one comprehend it was a benefite that he expected thee so long a tyme that

gaue then so long a time of repentance that hee suffered thee lying so long sweltered in thy sinnes mercifull· bountifull not cutting down the fruitlesse tree which possessed the earth and receaued the dewe of diuine influence in vaine·

it was another benefite that suffring thee in such erronious hee cast thee not headlong into the depth of hell in which perchance diuers are tormented for lesse crimes then thou hast committed

another is that hee instilled into thee so many holy inspirations so many good purposes yea incessantly beating at the doore of thy hart euen in the midst of thy misdeeds and continually calling thee who did nought else but offende him who called thee

another is that at length intending to impose an ende to thy rebellious and stifnecked obstinacie hee called thee with so high and powerfull a clamour that he recald thee from death to lyfe
and no otherwise then a second larus issuedst from the darksome sepulcher of thy innumerable

no more hande and foote and deliuered from the of the deuill

all nad· the greatest benefite is thys hee not pardoned thee and offences which were past but gaue thee grace helping preseruing thee least thou fall into the same againe moreouer ye ornaments stoole shooes and ring which the father gaue the prodigall sonne vppon his returne when he tooke him into his fauour decked with which thou walkest like the sonne of god despising all the deceits of the deuill pomps of the world pertaking the sweetnes of diuine things which béfore times seemed vnfauorie vnto thee
what what a blessing esteemest thou it that these benefits are denied to so many men and are bestowed on thee with so much fauour that god when thou wert no lesse sinful then they were nor lesse the vocation leauing in darknes and the state of damnation say tooke thee graced thee with the lot of saluation

grace with what reward with wh offices with what seruices thou recompénce him of what minde wilt thou be then when thou shalt heereafter by the vertue of this vocation enioy perpetuall gladnes in heauen with god and see other thy companyons acquaintance thorow defect of the same vocation and the like grace cast into eternall torments and crucified in hell

but of the grace of graces and of that sacrament of al sacraments by which god woulde dwell amongst men and giue himselfe for daily foode vnto them and remedy also can no wayes holde my tongue
once was there offered vppon the crosse a sacrifice and bloody host for our saluation but in thys sacrament hee is daily applyed vnto vs for the remission of our sinnes
when soeuer you doe thys sayth hee doe it in remembrance of me
monument of saluation singuler sacrament gratefull mysterie bread of lyfe sweet nourishment royall banquet hauing in thee manna the sauour of all sweetnes
who may enhaunce thee with answerable

tytles who may worthily eate thee who may honor thee with due reuerence and according to thy merrits my hart faileth whe thinke on thee my tongue foultreth when speak of thee neyther can report thy myracles according as desire
if that bountifull lorde had bestowed thys benefite on onely innocents and those that are vntouched and chast of lyfe as yet the gyft had beene inestimable but nowe what shall say when as to the end hee might impart himselfe vnto them hee disdayneth not to passe by the handes of many most vngodly ministers whose soules are the dwelling houses of sathan and bodies the vessels of corruption whose lyfe is consumed in vices and the sudds of sin moreouer that he might visit his and co~fort his friends hee hath not refused to be handled with their deed and impure hands to be taken with theyr sacriligious mouth and to be buried in theyr filthy bellies
the of was once sold but in thys more then a thousand yea almost daily it is sold

once onely in thys worlde it mocked and contemned but nowe incessantly by these impure men it is contemned
onely once hung it betweene two theeues vppon the crosse but now in this sacrament hee is daily crucified
howe might wee woorthily honour thys lorde who by so many wayes and meanes prouided for our saluation what shal wee render vnto him for this so admirable a nourishment

if seruaunts doe theyr maisters seruice because they are nourished by them if souldiours presse thorowe sworde and fire that by thys meanes they may auoyde the perrill of death what ought we not to do for this lorde that giueth vs thys celestiall food if god in the olde lawe required so many thanksgiuings for manna which he rayned from heauen for the isralites and which was a corruptible meat wh will require at our hands for this diuine foode which not onely is in it selfe but maketh all those that woorthily receaue the same if the of god himselfe gaue thanks

his father for a fewe barly loues as it appeareth in the gospell howe great ought we men to yeelde him for thys supernaturall bread thys liuing breade thys diuine bread if we are bounde to giue god thanks for the nutriment whereby our bodyes are sustained howe much owe wee him for that our is conserued for wee prayse not a horse because hee is a horse but because hee is good nor the wine because it is wine but because it is good neyther a man because he is a man but because he is a good man

if thou therefore in so many sorts art bounde vnto him who created thee a man how much more neerly art thou bounde in loue dutie vnto him because hee made thee a good man if thou art tyed vnto him so much for the dowries of thy body howe much owest thou for the gyfts of thy minde if so much for the gyfts of nature howe much for the gifts of grace to co~clude if so many things are due vnto him because he made thee the sonne of adam howe much pray thee art

thou vnto him from the sonne of vnhappy adam hath thee into the soe of god for better is the day in which we are borne to eternitie eusebius emisen sayth then in which wee are borne to indure the perrils of thys lyfe
behold brother behold a newe bond behold a new chayne by which no lesse then by the precedent thy hart is tyed and bound to desire vertue serue lord god

the argument
notwithstanding the most grieuous diuers commination of the diuine iustice the great rewards which are promised to those that are studious of vertue the greater part of men followeth wickednesse
the cause of this mischiefe is the generall error of men which perswadeth the that all the rewards of vertue doe appertaine to the world to come that vertue heere dious difficult and without hauing in this world reward or sollace whereas it hath many worthy priuiledges which the godly enioy this world but very many miseries contrary calamities the wicked are exagitated

chap

not without cause might a man ask this question why amongst christians that belieue all these thinges and confesse which hetherto hath beene spoken there are found so many who neglecting vertues follow vices that euill hath not one only roote but many diuers
but amongst others and they not the

least is this a certaine generall error in which the men of this world liue beleeuing that all that which god promiseth to the louers of vertue is reserued for the future life and that in this present world none of these are to bee exspected
for which cause whereas man dooth highly affect reward and is chiefely drawne by profit and is not moued but by things present yea and such things as are obiect to the exteriour sences when he seeth nothing present hee setteth light by that which is to come
so seemeth it that the iewes did in the time of the prophets
for when ezechiell by the commaundement of god proposed vnto them great promises or denounced vnto them dire they hist and after a contemptible sort disdained all things saying the vision that this man seeth is of a long date

and he prophecieth of times far hence
so likewise mockking the prophet esay· they contemned his words

and said commaund and recommaund· send and send againe exspect and reexspect exspect and reexspect a little there·

a little there
this is one of the chiefest reasons which calleth peruerse men from the obseruance of the commaundements of god perswading the~selues that in this world there is no reward prefixed for vertue but that all things are reserued for the world to come
this considered that great wise man when he said

truly because the sentence is not speedily pronounced against the wicked without any feare the of men perpetrate wickednes
and another wise man addeth· that amongst all things that are done vnder the sunne the worst is and that which giueth greatest occasion to the wicked of committing sin that euils fall vpon the iust as if had done the works of the wicked and the wicked somtimes liue so as if they had done the deedes of the iust or because all things are equall to the iust the impious the good and the euill the cleane and the vncleane to him that offereth sacrifice and him that it as the good man· so also the sinner as the so likewise that speaketh truth


he sayth
and the harts of the son of men are filled with malice and contempt in theyr lyfe and hereafter they shall lead vnto hell

but that which salomon heere speaketh the euill wicked themselues confesse in the prophecie of malachy saying· vaine is hee that serueth god

and what hath it profited that we haue kept his precepts and that wee haue walked circumspectly before the lord of hostes· we therfore call the arrogant blessed because they are builded vp doing impiety tempting god yet are saued
these things say the wicked and these are they that them in their impietie
for as ambrose sayth they thinke it to be a hard matter to buy hope by their perrill· that is to obtayne the future blessings by the hazarde of the present and to giue that which is in theyr possession for such thinges as seeme as yet to bee very farre from them

to roote out that pestilent error· knowe not truly from beginning may be more commodiously taken then fro those wo

and teares of our sauior with which in times past bewept that miserable citty of ierusalem saying for if thou also hadst knowne

and that in thys thy day those thinges that belong to thy peace but nowe are they hidden from thine eyes christ knewe on the one side that with himselfe all the graces and celestiall treasures descended vppon of ierusalem and on the other side he saw the blind and miserable people ignorant thereof to know it and therefore that vtter ouerthrow attended them
for thys cause deploreth hee them
the like cause haue wee to bewaile the louers of thys world whilst here wee see the pulchritude of vertue the wonderfull graces great that attend thereon
there farre these thinges are and hidden from the eyes of men drowned in earthly thoughts also in what sort vertue changeth place and dispersed thorow the world findeth no place serely to dwell in

if god would open the eyes of men that they might see the

ritches· peace liberty· light tranquillity delights fauours and goods which follow vertue euen as slaues euen in this life howe much would they esteeme her with how great desire would they aspire thervnto with howe great study with how many would they seek her but nowe all these thinges are hidden from their eyes and they behold nothing but the externall semblance of vertue not tasting the interiour sweetnes thereof and therefore think they that there is nothing in the same that is not hard difficult ane vnsauorie deeming this currant not in this present but the future life yet if there be any good therein· thy suppose the same to appertaine to another world not this

but thou whatsoeuer thou art th so thinkest why considerest th not the assistance that god ha prepared for vs to ouercome th difficulty of which sort are the vertues infused the giftes of the ghost the sacraments of the ne law with many other graces and uine helps which are vnto vs as

oares and sailes to the shippe and wings to the birds
thou oughtst to haue remembred that god not onely promised his the goods of glory but also of grace those for the future life this for the present according to that of the prophet our lord will giue grace and glorie which are like two cofers furnished with all blessings the one for this life the other for the future
if the and the deuill for the seruices which their followers doe vnto them bestow so many kindes of fauours pleasures and delights at leastwise in appearance howe is it possible that god should be so niggard to his friends and faithfull ministers that hee should leaue them hungry and thirsty in the midst of their labours tribulations heare what god aunswereth to the lamentations of the wicked by the mouth of his prophet
conuert and see what there is betwixt the iust and vniust

and betweene him that god· and him that serueth him not so that god is not contented with the prerogatiue which the iust shall haue ouer the vniust in the future

life but in the present he saith conuert and see as if he said
wi not that you should exspect the future world that you might knowe the glory of the good and the excellencie of blessednes but turne now and see also in this life the difference which is betweene good and euill the ritches of the one and the pouerty of the other the ioy of the one and the sadnes of the other the peace of the one and the of the other the light in which the one liueth and the darknesse in which the other walketh and truly shall you know that the condition of the iust is more blessed then you suppose

but if the way of vertue seemeth barren and horrid to thee what is that the diuine wisedome sayth of of her selfe with mee are and glory great wealth and iustice will walke in the wayes of iustice in the midst of the pathes of iudgement that may enritch those that loue mee and that may fill the treasures
what ritches what are they except of his heauenl wisedome which exceede all the

ches of this worlde which are stowed on them who walke in wayes of iustice which is the vertue whereof we now speak
if heere there be not found rites more excellent and wealthie those which the worlde proseth why did the apostle giue thankes for the corinthians that in all things they were ritch

terming them absolut ritch signifying that others are to be called ritch but the ritch this world

out of the first book chap
the guide of a sinner

the argument

at that common errour of men of which mention was made in the precedent chapter may be taken away and that it may be also prooued that vertue hath her rewards in this worlde there are twelue rehearsed which the vertuous enioy in this world and as many contrary euils follow the wicked
of these the sixe first expressed in this chapter the singuler prouidence of god

towards the iust the grace of holy spirit ght and knowledge the consolations of holy ghost· the peace of conscien and hope of mercy

chap
howe foulely doe they that thinke there is no warde proposed for in this life it appeareth the chapter going befo
to confound therefore that so perilous besides those things are already spoken these two priuiledges which followe sha very profitable in which wee entreate of the twelue fruites which accompany this life that by them the this worlde may knowe that are farre more excellent benef to be founde in then suppose

the first and principall of priuiledges out of which as it a springing all the rest flow is the prouidence and fath diligence which god vseth those who serue him
for altho

be in him a generall of all creatures yet hath hee a singuler care of those whom himselfe hath chosen for his ne holding them in the place his owne children giuing them a a filiall minde likewise and hee like sort bearing towardes them hart of a most louing father and refore hath he a care and aunswerable to this loue
no obserueth his friends with like and diligence as god doth his are alwayes conuersant in his and to whom he is assistant in their tribulations
dauid confesth this in his psalmes when hee th

but mee hast thou fauoured my innocence sake and thou confirmed mee alwayes in thy ght that is thou hast neuer thine eyes from mee for the care which thou hast of
and in another place the eies our lord are vpon the iust and eares are opened vnto their prais
and many are the tribulations the iust and our lord shall them out of all their troubles
our lord keepeth all their bones

so that none of them shall be remued
in the new testament he that he hath not onely care of the bones but of euery one of the haires
if that seeme much thee heare no lesse then that hee saide by his prophet

hee toucheth you toucheth no then the apple of mine eye

neith content that hee onely hath care vs but hath commaunded likew his angels to guide vs that they direct vs in all our wayes
for care god is called in holy scrtures a father rather then a mther a pastor and a spouse prouidence yeeldeth a great of reioyce to the righteous as it apeareth by many places of the scrture

contrariwise the wicked liue neglected and forsaken by god are in this worlde like a patrimo without an heyre like a without a maister like a ship out a pilot like a flocke witho
sheepheard exposed to the throat of the woolfe
this manner god threatneth by the mouth of the prophet

will not feed you that that dieth let it die and that which is cut off

let it be cut off and let the rest deuoure euery one of them the flesh of his neighbour
but this is most dangerous for whereas the world is a stormy sea and as it were a full of thieues horrible beasts whereas there are so many incommodities and misfortunes of mans life whereas our enemies with who we are to fight are so many and so strong when as there are so many hidden snares so many traps laid to conclude so many so great difficulties euery wayes scattered sowed in our wayes and a man is a creature so fraile naked blind vnarmed feareful and void of counsaile the shadow and assistance of god faile what can he poore weake one doe amongst so many strong a dwarfe amidst so many gyants blinde amidst so many snares and vnweaponed amongst many armed and strong enemies

god permitteth also that such should fall from one sinne into he suffereth them according to

the desires of their owne harts that the causes of their damnation may be multiplied
neyther is this the end of his euill

for it sufficeth not god that he auerteth his eyes from the vniust and sinfull and that hee permitteth them to fall into diuers errors and sorts of tribulation but hee also sendeth them and armeth creatures against them so that those eyes that were first opened for their profit now watch for their perdition as god saith by the prophet will fixe mine eyes vppon them in euill

and not in good neither is there place wherein a man may hide himselfe from these eyes as god testifieth at large in the same chapter
and how perilous it is to haue god incensed against vs many examples doe teach vs

to this prouidence it appertayneth to prouide men of all those necessary meanes to the attainment of the finall end which is beatitude helping them in all their necessities and creating in their soules dispositions vertues and infused habites which are all required to that ende
of this number the first is the grace

of the holy spirit next after that prouidence the beginning of all other priuiledges and celestiall gifts
now this grace is the participation of the diuine nature that is of goodnes purity and nobility of god himselfe by whose helpe and meanes a man casteth away from himselfe all vilenes abiectnes inciuilitie which hee receaued from adam and is made pertaker of the diuine nobilitie putting off himselfe and putting on iesus christ
grace is the spirituall ornament of the soule made by the handes of the holy ghost which maketh the soule so faire and gracious in gods eyes that hee receaueth the same for his daughter and his spouse
of this ornament esay boasteth

reioycing saith he will reioyce in our lord
the principall effect of grace is to make the soule so gratefull and faire in gods eyes that hee chooseth the same for his daughter his spouse his temple his house in which he delighteth himselfe with the sonnes of men
another effect thereof is not onely to adorne the soule but also to strengthen it by the meanes of

those vertues which proceede from the same which are like sampsons haires in which not onely his beauty but his strength
grace therfore armeth the whole man and maketh him so strong as thomas saith that the least grace is sufficient to bind and ouercome all deuils and all sinnes
it maketh also all actions yea euen those that are indifferent gratefull vnto god
it maketh vs the sonnes of god by adoption and heires of the celestial kingdome worthy also to be registred in the booke of life
and to speake many things in a few words grace is that which maketh a man apt to all goodnes that smootheth the way to heauen that lightneth and maketh our lords yoake easie vnto vs that healeth our infirme nature our will comforteth our memory strengthneth our wit moderateth the part least it with offences confirmeth the irefull least it be slack and sluggish to doe well
finally it maketh god dwell in our soules that dwelling in the same he might gouerne defend and direct the same

towards heauen
god therefore in our soules like a king in his kingdome a generall in his army a master in his schoole and a shepheard in his flocke that hee may there exercise and execute all spirituall offices· and all prouidence
goe too therefore if this so goodly a margarite from which so many benefites doe flowe be a perpetuall companion of vertue who would not willingly imitate that prudent merchaunt in the gospell who solde all that hee hadde that hee might get this one and onely treasure this grace doe they all want that are entangled and perseuer in sinne

the thirde priuiledge is a certaine speciall light and supernaturall wisedome which god bestoweth on those who are iust and which is deriued from grace for the office therof is to heale our weak nature
euen as therefore hee healeth our will weakened by sinne so also ought it to cure our vnderstanding wholy obscured by the same sinne that the vnderstanding may know what to doe and the will may

haue power to doe that which hee now knoweth needfull to be done
therefore the prophet

our lord is against and my against my weakenes
to this appertaine the foure gifts of the holy spirit· as are the gift of wisedome is giuen for the knowledge of diuine things
the gift of science which is giuen that wee may vnderstand inferiour thinges the gift of vnderstanding by which we attaine the knowledge of the misteries of god and the gift of by meanes whereof wee conceaue the actions of this life and in them how to gouerne what so euer shall encounter vs
but this knowledge is not so much speculatiue as actiue not so much contemplatiue as practiue neither is it giuen vs that we should vnderstand but that wee should worke not that wee should be subtill ingenious in disputing but that wee should be studious in enduring
and therefore it remayneth not only in the vnderstanding sciences which are acquired in schooles but by the vertue thereof

it mooueth the will enclining the same to follow vertue
of this science christ speaketh in the gospell

the holy ghost which my father sendeth in my name

he shall teach you in all truth and it is written in the prophets they shall bee all taught of god
they that pertake this celestiall gift are not puffed vp with vaine glory in prosperity nor amated in aduersity
for by the benefit of this light they see of how small moment it is which the world can giue or take away if it be compared with those thinges which are in gods power
the testifieth this when he saith a man setled in his wisedome

abideth as the sunne the foole is changed like the moone

this is that wisedome which the children of light enioy but on the contrary side the wicked liue in those horrible darks of egipt which may be felt with the handes
of which thing the figure was where it is said that in the land of goshen where the children of israell dwelt there was light and in egipt for three dayes space so thick darknes

that it might be felt which represented that obscure night in which liue as they themselues confesse in esay

we haue exspected the light and behold darknes· the cleare day and beholde we haue walked in obscurity we haue felt for the wall like blind men and as it were without eyes wee haue groped about· wee haue stumbled at as it were in darknes and in misty· as it were the dead
for what greater blindnes can it be then to sell the right of first birth that is the heritage of the celestiall kingdome for a little pleasure of this worlde then not to feare hell not to aspire to heauen not to hate sinne not to remember the latter iudgement to set light by the promises and threatnings of our lord not to reme~ber death which euery moment is imminent not to prepare himselfe to yeeld an account not to thinke that it is a momentarie thing which delighteth and an eternall which dooth excruciate they knewe not sayth the prophet neyther vnderstand

they walk darknes and from darknes into

darknes shall they goe

the fourth priuiledge is the ioy of the holy ghost of that knowledge whereof wee spake before wee sayd that it not onely relyed on the vnderstanding but that it discended also to the will where it poureth foorth her rayes and spreadeth her light so that the soule reioyceth· and after an vnspeakeable kind of manner comforteth her selfe in our lorde
so that euen the materiall light produceth of it selfe that heate which wee feele so that spyrituall light createth in the soule of the iust man a spirituall ioy of which we speak according to that of prophet the light is risen to the iust and reioycing to the vpright in hart

many confesse that as in vices there are all kinds of euill so in vertues there are al sorts of goodnes only pleasure excepted which diuers deny to be in the same
and wheras the hart of man desireth nothing more then pleasures men had rather haue imperfect pleasure then that which wanteth pleasure with all the perfections thereof
but vnhappy man if vertue haue not ioy

and delight in her what is that which dauid saith how great a multitude of thy sweetnes haft thou hoorded vp for those that feare thee

in which words the prophet· not onely expresseth the greatnes of the sweetnes which is reserued for the godly but also giueth a reason why the wicked do not know the same namely because our lord hideth the same from theyr eyes
this the godly especially pertake in theyr prayers neyther is thys ioy onely peculier to them that are perfect but the younger souldiers also of christ and such as are newly entred into his seruice haue their sweet+nes and find theyr ioyes in the way of our lorde as that sollemne day testifieth

appoynted by the father for his prodigall sonne

the wicked are not pertakers of this ioy for euen as he that hath his pallate corrupted with euill humors tasteth not the sweetnes of the meat for that which is bitter he deemeth sweet and that which is sweete bitter so they that haue theyr soule corrupted with and disordered humors of vices and affections and

so accustomed to the of egipt haue no feeling of the sweetnes of vertue but thinke vice sweet and vertue bitter

the fift priuiledge is the peace of conscience for a iust man feeleth no pricks or stinges of conscience but reioyceth in the sweete flowers and fruites of vertue which the holy ghost hath planted in his soule as it were a paradise on earth and a well cultiued garden in which hee himselfe taketh delight
of this tranquilitie augustine speaketh after this manner
thou that seekest this true rest which after this life is promised to christians euen here maist thou tast the sweete thereof

amidst the most bitter molestations of this life if thou louest his precepts that promised the same vnto thee
for thou shalt quickly perceiue that ye fruites of are sweeter then those of iniquity and thou shalt more truly and contentedly enioy the goods of the conscience amidst troubles then of the euill amongst delights
hetherto augustine

and truly euen as honny is not only sweet of it selfe but also sweetneth

that which was before bier so a good conscience is so iocond merry that it maketh all the troubles and tribulations of this worlde seeme delightfull
so great is the fruite and sweetnes of a good conscience as ambrose in his booke of is not afraid to say that the beatitude of the iust in this life consisteth in the same
his wordes are these
the brightnes of honesty is so great

that peace of conscience and security of innocence doe make a blessed life
the same vnderstood the ethniques amongst whom cicero saith thus a life led in honesty and vprightnes bringeth so much consolation that sicknes eyther toucheth not or griefe of mind lightly attayneth those who haue so liued
bias demaunded what in this life wanted feare aunswered a good conscience
and seneca in a certaine epistle saith it is neuer without ioy and that proceedeth from a good conscience
by which it appeareth howe fitly the phylosophers sentence accordeth with that of salomon

all the dayes of the poore are euill that is miserable

a secure minde is like a perpetuall banquet
contrariwise the wicked liue in perpetuall feare and suspition
for euen as the conscience is the maister of the godly so is it the torture and heads man of the wicked which afflicteth and inwardly tormenteth and without intermission accuseth sinners of their wickednes committed and mixeth wormewood amongst all theyr delights
for the turpitude of sinne iniuries done vnto other men infamy incertayntie of life feare of death dread to yeeld account and horrour of hel like thornes do teare the of a sinner that when hee is alone he can neuer take comfort
so that it is well sayd by isodore

the guilty soule is neuer secure for an euill mind is alwayes afflicted with the stings of his owne conscience then which punishment what is more greeuous ambrose what more greeuous punishment the wound of the inward conscience

is not this more to be esteemed then death then losse then banishment then weakenes then greefe is which is so vnfainedlie

true

that the ethniques also had knowledge thereof as many the worthy writings of seneca cicero and others doe testifie

the sixt priuiledge is the confidence and hope of vertue in which the iust liue of which also the apostle speaketh
reioycing in hope patient in tribulation
this is one of the principall treasures of christian life this is the possession and patrimony of the sonnes of god this is the secure hauen and very remedy of all the miseries of this life
for this cause the prophet dauid sayde thus

remember lord thy promises in which thou gauest mee hope this comforted mee in my humility
the effects of this hope are many excellent
for it strengtheneth a man in the way of vertue by the hope of rewarde or recompence for the more sure hee is of the pledge of this reward the more willingly he runneth through what soeuer tribulations of this world as with one voyce all the fathers doe confesse
euery worke saith saint ierosme is wont to become light when as the recompence thereof is

thought vpon and the hope of the rewarde becommeth the solace of the labour

the obtayning thereof doth not in the end onely strengthen vs but it helpeth also in the midst thereof yea in all necessity and worldly misery
by this a man is succoured in all tribulation defended in perills by he receaueth comfort in his calamities help in his infirmities sufficient in all his necessities
by this we obtaine the grace and mercy of our lorde which assisteth vs in euerie thing
of this there are diuers testimonies in scriptures especially in the psalmes

hope is as it were a secure hauen to which the iust doe direct their course anie tempest of this world dooth assaile them and like a strong shield wherein all our enemies darts are receaued without any wound
it is as it were a gadge or prouant hidden to in time of famine all the poore repaire and take bread
it is that tabernacle and that shaddowe which our lord promiseth by esay that it should be to his elect a shelter in the heate of the day and

a couert from the storme and raine that is from all aduersity and prosperity of this worlde
it is a medicine and common remedy for all our euils
for it is most certaine that what soeuer we iustly faithfully and prudently hope from god we shall receaue the same so that it be necessary for our saluation and pertaine therevnto
therefore cyprian caleth the mercy of god an inexhaunst fountaine of goodnes

and hope or a vessell of confidence wherein those benefites are contayned and hee sayth that according to the quantity of the vessell the proportion of the remedy shall bee likewise correspondent
for in regard of the fountaine the water of mercy shall neuer faile
euery place sayth our lorde to the chyldren of israell which the step of your foote shall tread vpon will giue you
so all the mercy vpo which a man shall settle his foote shall be his

the wicked also haue a certaine hope yet not a liuing but a deade hope for sinne taketh away the lyfe thereof therfore their hope worketh not in them the effects which

we haue aboue rehearsed
of thys hope it is written the hope of the wicked is like the downe that is tossed vp like the light foame which is scattered by the storme like the which is dispersed by the winde
by which you may perceiue howe vaine the hope of the wicked is
and not onely is this hope vaine but hurtfull deceitfull and dangerous also as god warneth by the prophet wo vnto you you sonnes forsakers that is you that haue forsaken your father saith our lord that you might doe counsaile but not of me hoping for helpe in the strength of pharao and hauing trust in the shadow of egypt
and pharaos strength shall be confusion vnto you that which followeth and in the chapter which foloweth woe to you that descende into egipt for help hoping in your horses

you see heere that the hope of the wicked is flesh of the good spirit the one of them to bee nought els then man the other to be god so that what difference there is between god man the same is there founde betweene hope and hope

what difference there is betweene both the hopes the prophet ieremie aptly describeth chapter
cursed saith hee is the man that trusteth in man and after hee hath expounded this malediction he opposeth the blessing of the righteous
blessed saith he is the man that trusteth in our lord

of these sixe priuiledges and their contraries hath he entreated lib part of the guide of a sinner chapters

the argument
the riches of vertue are not circumscribed within these priuiledges only but they haue also other six annexed vnto them no lesse valuable the the former as are
that it maketh the man in whom it abideth possessor of the true liberty of spirit and free from all
that it filleth the hart with incredible peace
that god heareth the prayers of good men that the diuine assistance is alwayes neere them in all their tribulations
that all good things are bestowed on the godly which are any wayes necessary in this life that the death of the righteous is pleasant blessed peaceable to which goods so many euils are opposed which make the life of dissolute men and vnhappy

chap

the seauenth priuiledge of vertue is the true liberty of the minde of which the apostle speaketh where the spirit of our lord is there

is liberty
thys liberty our lorde promised the iewes when he sayd if you shall continue in my sayings

you shall truly be my disciples and you shall knowe the truth and the truth shall deliuer you that is shall giue you true liberty
they answered we are the seed of abraham and we haue not as yet serued any man how sayst thou then yee shall be free iesus answered said vnto them verily verily say vnto you euery one that doth sin is the slaue of sin now the seruant remaineth not in the house for euer but the sonne remaineth for euer
if therfore the son hath deliuered you you shal be truly free

in which words there is a double liberty insinuated a false and a true
the false is theyrs who haue theyr body free but their soule captiue subiect to the tyrannie of their own passions and sinnes such as was that of alexander the great who beeing king of the whole worlde was a slaue to his owne appetites and vices

the true is of those which haue theyr mindes voyde of all tyrants

although they haue theyr bodie sometimes free somtimes thrale and captiue
such as was that of the apostle saint paule who although he were captiue and held in bonds yet in spirit he flew thorow the heauens and by the doctrine of his epistles at liberty the whole world
this true liberty is of those that follow vertue but the false is of those that lye drowned in vice and sin

of this liberty of the good thraldome of the wicked there is a most excellent and copious treatise in the first booke of the guide of a sinner part
chap to which place we refer the reader

the eyght priuiledge is the peace of the interior man which the studious in doe enioy
now it to be noted that there three sorts of peace
the one with our neighbour

of which dauid speaketh when he sayth was peaceable with those that hated peace when spake vnto them they mee without a cause
another peace is with god of

which the apostle sayth being iustified therefore by fayth let vs haue peace with god

the thyrd is that which a man hath with himselfe

nowe that say thus let no man admire for it appeareth that in one and the same man there are two men and they contrary the one against the other as are the interior and exterior or the spirit and flesh the appetite and reason
vvhich contrarietie not onely combatteth the minde with cruell assaults but troubleth the whole man also with his passions ardent desires and raging hunger
the godly therefore hauing grace the gouernour of a their sences appetites and all their wil resigned into the hands of god are not by any encounter so perturbed as that they loose theyr interior peace
this peace is promised by our lord to the louers of vertue by the kingly prophet when he sayth great is the peace of those that loue thy lawe

and no blame or scandale may befall the
and in esay would to god thou hadst kept my commaundements

thy peace had been

like a riuer theyr iustice like the waues of the sea
but what peace this is may rather be vnderstood by the practize then speculation for the iust man knoweth howe much his hart differeth now when he serueth god from that which he bare about him when he was co~uersant in the world for then in all perrill of tribulation hee was suddainlie afrayde he trembled in hart and bodie he feared but after hee left the world and translated his hart to the loue of celestiall things and planted all his hope in god he all things what soeuer chance with a quiet hart subiected to gods will
all the perturbations of his minde as if dead are at rest neyther is hee prouoked by any affections the inferior part of the minde is obedient the superior gouerneth that in great peace exelent order

but the wicked and sinners are alwayes in warre contention and perturbation for while on the one side they are depriued of grace which is as it were a bytte restrayning theyr passions and mortifying them on the other side so vnbrideled

and disordered by their appetites and dissolute affections as they scarce know what it is to any vice
they liue in infinite of diuers thinges some of honours some of dignities som of riches some of marriage other likewise are mooued with other pleasures concupisences
for the appetite is as it were a fire which neuer cryes enough or as a deuouring beast that is neuer satisfied as it were a horseleach

which hath two young ones saying bring bring

this is the vnsatiable appetite of our hart whose two daughters are necessitie and cupiditie whereof the one is as it a tru thirst the other as it were a false neither dooth the one afflict lesse the the other although the one bee true necessity the other false hence it is yt neither rich nor pore if they bee wicked haue any true peace or quiet for these mens harts are solicited by desire the other with continuall necessity saying bring bring
what peace therefore can a man haue being sollicited by these

two and importuned for which are not in his power what quiet can the mother haue which hath rounde about her many hungry children crying thorowe neede and asking breade and not hauing to satisfie them

the ninth priuiledge of vertue is because god heareth the prayers of the iust this is a most famous co~fort vnto them and helpe also in all necessity and misery of this world which is so great that amongst all liuing creatures there is none more miserable the man is who is exposed to a thousand infirmities chaunces necessities and dolors· as well of the mind as of ye body
that which is past hee greeueth at that which is present afflicteth him that which is to come terrifieth him and that he may sustaine himselfe with a litle morsel of bread he must often labor all his life time

this one thing did so much afflict those wise men in time past with so much tediousnes that among them there is one to be founde that was not afrayd to say that hee doubted

whether nature were our mother or rather our which hath subiected vs to so many miseries
which beeing so what remedy pray you hath hee left who punished so greeuously tel me what remedy hath a man weak and lame that sayling by sea with one misfortune looseth al his riches know what thou wilt say if thou sayst hee hath not to liue neither that by reason of infirmitie he can labour for his liuing it must needes be that hee must beg neyther hath a man other remedie left him then like a poore begger to cry at the gate of our lord
but thou wilt perchance aske me whether this remedy be vniuersal for euery necessity of our life to thys since it wholy dependeth on gods wil can aunswere nought els but that god chose vnto himselfe to this end witnesses secretaries such as are the apostles and prophets amongst whom one sayth there is not another so great a nation

that haue theyr gods so fauourable to them as our lorde god is assistant to all our obsecrations
when therfore

we do pray although we see no man that answereth vs yet speak we not vnto the walls but god himselfe is present with vs who heareth and helpeth vs when we pray hauing co~passion of our necessities and preparing the remedy
what therefore more greater comfort may it be to him that praieth then to haue assurance of so certain a presence
and if this be sufficient to comfort the that pray how much shall those thinges confirme them which christ himselfe speaketh saying aske you shall haue

seeke you shall finde knocke and it shall be opened vnto you
what more precious certain figne may we haue the that is who will call these words into question who will not be refreshed with thys sollace in all his prayers whom wil not so royall satisfie

contrariwise of the prayers of the wicked it is said
when you shal lift vp your hands

wil turne mine eyes from you and when you shall multiply your prayers will not heare you

and in the booke of iob for what hope hath the hypocrite if he greedily take other mens goods if

god deliuer not his soule shal god heare his cry when trouble shal fall vpon him a thousand more of such like authorities might be collected from the sacred scriptures by which may bee gathered that the godly are handled and heard like chyldren but the vngodly reuerted like enemies

the tenth priuiledge of vertue is that god helpeth the righteous in whatsoeuer theyr tribulations for to the louers of vertue there is a strength and fortitude giuen that with ioy they may sustaine theyr tribulations which shall neuer fayle them in this life
for we know that there is not a sea so stormie in thys world neyther an euripus so instable as our life is
for in it there is not founde any felicity so secure which is not subiect to a thousand kinde of casualties lying in to indanger vs euery moment
and it is a thing woorthy of consideration to see with howe great difference the good and euill sort doe passe ouer thys mutable worlde
for the vertuous doe assuredly knowe that they haue god for

theyr father and that it is hee that enioyneth them to taste thys cuppe like a certaine medicine prescribed by a most expert and cunning phisition
and that tribulation is as it were a refining or polishing which the more sharper it is so much the more pure and brighter dooth it make the soule and away all corruption and therefore they cast downe theyr heades and are humbled like young children in the time of tribulation

but if at any time the labour increase the help of the diuine grace is presently at hand that neuer forsaketh the iust in time of tribulation
for god himselfe as his holy worde witnesseth is neuer more neere the faythfull then in the time of theyr tribulation although it seemeth quite contrary

reade and the sacred scriptures and thou shalt finde that there is scarcely any thing that is so often repeated promised in them as that which we heare speak of
is it not of god that he is our helper in necessities and tribulations is it not hee that inuiteth

vs that in time of tribulation wee should call vppon him call vppon mee sayth hee in the time of tribulation

and will deliuer thee and thou shalt honour me

dooth not the prophet hauing experience heereof testifie the same when did inuocate sayth hee the lorde of my iustice hearde mee

in tribulation thou hast comforted mee
hence it is that wee reade that the saints beeing verie often circumuented with many perills and temptations remained immoouable and vnconstant in mind and of a pleasant merry looke gesture for they knewe they had present with them that faythfull custodie which neuer had forsaken them which is euen then most of all present when dangers are grown to theyr vttermost

of thys those three holy young men had a feeling when king nabuchodonozer commaunded them to bee cast into the burning fornace in babylon
to thys is annexed the help fauour of all vertues which at that tyme concurre toward the strengthening of the afflicted mind

for euen as when the hart is vexed all the blood from euery part in the body hath recourse to succour it least it fayle so when the soule is with griefe and anguish all the vertues do presently concurre and help her now thys way straight another way fayth is at hand bringing with her a cleere knowledge of the good euill that followeth after thys lyfe hope likewise commeth which maketh a man patient in tribulation in expectation of reward
charitie draweth nie with the loue whereof a man beeing inflamed he desireth to suffer all kindes of affliction
obedience and the conformitie of our will with gods wil approche from whose handes a man receaueth with gladnes and without grudging whatsoeuer is giuen
these and other such like are the cause that the godly in theyr tribulations are patient and magnanimious yea that willingly they seeke out affliction saying with bernard giue mee lord tribulation that thou mayst bee alwayes with mee

contrariwise the wicked in that they haue neither charity nor fortitude nor hope because tribulations finde them vnarmed and vnprepared and for that they want the light· by meanes whereof they may see that which the godly beholde by a liuely faith neyther by experience haue proued that wonderfull goodnes and fatherly prouidence of god hee respecteth his seruants when tribulations are at hand they are cruell to themselues and inhumane they neglect the glory of our lorde blaspheme his name scandale his prouidence from his iustice curse his mercy and open theyr sacrilidgious mouthes agaynst heauen and his maiestie hence it falleth out that calamities at last doe raigne into their houses their miseries are doubled which god inflicteth vpon them for their so many blasphemies
for this reward doth hee deserue that spetteth in gods face and will kick against the prick

the eleuenth priuiledge is that god doth also impart to those that followe vertue temporall and necessarie

benefits for the sustentation of their life which is approoued by that of salomon
the length of dayes is in his right hand that is

his and in his left hand ritches and glory
so that vertue hath two kindes of good to inuite a man· on the right hand eternall on the left temporall
doe not thinke that god leaueth his seruaunts so as they die for hunger neyther that hee is so improuident and negligent that whereas hee giueth foode in due season to ants and wormes he will leaue men that day and night serue in his house consumed with hunger and made leane vvith want
by this rewarde the psalmist dooth vs to vertue saying feare our lorde all yee his saints because there is no necessitie that can happen to those that feare him the ritch haue wanted and haue beene hungry

but they that seeke after our lorde shall want no good thing
if thou seekest more testimonies reade the sixth of mathew and the eight and twentieth of deuteronony
but if perhaps any one shall say that those promises in deuteronomy

are rather made to the iewes then the christians for to these are greater the temporall promises made namely the goods of grace glory let him know that euen as god in that

carnall lawe denied not the iewes that were iust spirituall thinges so neither in the spirituall law wil he temporall blessings from those that are good christians
for this is the law of the couenant and promise which god made twixt man and himselfe that man shoulde obserue his commaundements and god likewise should procure for him those things that were necessary take care of him neither will god euer violate this couenaunt
for if man bee a faithfull seruaunt vnto god god also will be a faithfull lord and patron vnto man
this is that one thing that god said was necessarie

namely to knowe to loue and to serue god for this one thing being obserued the rest are in safety
pietie saith paule is profitable to all thinges

hauing the promises of life present and to come
see pray you howe manifestly paule heere

promiseth to piety not onely the goods of eternall life but temporall also

but if any man will knowe howe great the aduersity and pouerty of the vngodly is let him reade the chapter of deutronomy and he shal there finde those things which shall both breed admiration in him and strike feare into his hart neyther are these comminations vaine or inuented to terrifie men but are rather true prophecies whose trueth very often the after euent hath approued
the siege of samaria vnder king achab the destruction of the citty of ierusalem vnder titus doe both testifie that nothing in that chapter of deutronomy is spoken in vaine
neyther let any man thinke that these thinges are onely spoken to the iewes for they pertayne vnto all men that haue the knowledge of gods law and those likewise that transgresse the same as god testifieth by the
haue not saith he caused the people of israel to ascend from the land of egipt the palestines from capadocia the sirians fro cirene behold

the eyes of our lord are vppon the kingdome which is full of wickednes and will grinde them from the face of the earth
the diuers slaughters and ruines of kingdomes empires inferred in times past in the christian world

by the hunes gothes and vandales testifie no lesse

the twelfth and last priuiledge of vertue is the pleasing and glorious death of the saints
for what is more glorious then the death of the iust precious sayth the psalmist is the death of the saints

in the sight of our lord
and ecclesiasticus

in extreamity all thinges shal be well to those that feare god and in the day of his death hee shall be blessed

vvhat greater hope and confidence may bee wished for then that of blessed saint martine who vppon the instant of death espying the enemie of mankinde cruell beast sayeth hee why standest thou nigh mee cruell as thou art thou shalt finde nothing in me for the bosome of abraham shall receaue me in peace
so the iust feare

not death nay rather they reioyce in theyr departure prayse god and in as much as in them lyeth giue thanks for their end for by the benefit of death they are deliuered from all theyr labours and begin to tast the first fruites of theyr felicitie

of these sayeth saint augustine

hee that desireth to be dissolued and to be with christ dyeth not patiently but lyueth patiently and dyeth delightfully
the iust man therefore hath no cause to lament or feare death nay rather it is to be sayd of him that the swanne hee dyeth singing gyuing glory to god that him

but the death of sinners is most wretched sayth the prophet for it is euill in the loosing of the worlde

woorse in the seperation from the flesh and woorst of all in the double contrition of the woorme and fire layeth saint bernard
this is the last and not the least euill as vvell of the boddie as of the soule
for it is harde to leaue the worlde harder to forsake the body

hardest to be tormented in hell fire
these and other such like infinite euills doe torment sinners in the houre of their death which make theyr end troublesome disquiet and cruell

of all these thinges the author entreateth very largely lib guide of a sinner chap truly most worthy the reading and obseruation

the conclusion of all those thinges which hetherto haue beene spoken of the priuiledges of vertues

chap

thou hast heard therfore my brother which and of what kind those twelue priuiledges be which are graunted to vertue in this life which are as it were twelue excellent and woorthy fruites of that tree which iohn saw in the apocalips which was so planted by a flood bearing twelue fruites euery moneth yeelding his seuerall fruite
for what other thing may this tree be next

the sonne of god then vertue it selfe which yeeldeth the fruite of holines and life and what other fruites thereof are there then those which wee haue reckoned vp in all this part for what fruite is more pleasant to the sight then the fatherly prouidence whereby god preserueth his the deuine grace the light of wisedome the consolation of the holy spirit the ioy of a good conscience a good euent of hope the true liberty of the soule the interiour peace of the hart to be heard in our prayers to be helpt in tribulations to be prouided for in our necessities finally to be assisted and to receaue ghostly consolation in death euery one of these priuiledges is truly so great in it selfe that if it were plainely knowne it should suffice man to loue and embrace vertue and amende his life and it should also bring to passe that a man should truly vnderstand how wel it is said by our sauior whoso+euer forsaketh the worlde for gods sake

shall receaue a hundreth fold in this lyfe and possesse lyfe eternall

beholde therefore my brother what a benefit it is that heeretofore haue declared vnto thee see whervnto inuite thee consider if any man will say thou art deceaued if for the loue thereof thou shalt leaue the worlde and all that is therein
one onely inconuenient hath this good if it may be termed an inconuenient by reason it is vnsauorie to the reprobate namely because it is vnknowne vnto him
for this cause sayth our sauiour the kingdome of heauen is like vnto a treasure that is hidden for this good is a very treasure in deede but hidden not to those that possesse it but to others
the prophet very well acknowledged the price of this treasure who said my secret to my selfe

my secret to my selfe little cared he whether other men knew his treasure or no
for this good is not as other goods are which are not goods vnlesse they be knowne by others for which cause they are not goods of themselues but only in the opinion of the world therfore it is necessary that they be known of him that by that meanes they may

be called goods
but this good maketh his possessour good blessed and no lesse warmeth his hart when only knoweth it himselfe then if all the world knew it
but my tong is not the key of this secret deske much lesse of all those things which hetherto haue been spoken for what so euer may be spoken by humane tongue is much lesse abiect then the truth of the thing it selfe
the key is the diuine light and the experience vse of vertues
this will that thou ask at gods hands thou shalt find this treasure yea god him selfe in who thou shalt find al things thou shalt see with how great reason the prophet said blessed is the people whose god is our lord

for what can he want that is in possession of this good it is written in the book of the kings that helcanah the father of samuel said vnto his wife that bewailed her selfe because shee was barren had no children anna why weepest thou

and why doost thou not eate and wherfore is thy hart troubled am not better vnto thee then ten sonnes well then if a good husband which is to day to+morrow

is not is better to his wife then ten sonnes what thinkest thou of god what shall hee be to soule that possesseth him what you meane whether looke you· whatintend you why leaue you the fountaine of paradise and drinke you of the troubled cesternes of worlde why followe you not the good counsaile which the giueth saying tast and see howe sweet our lord is

why doe we not often passe this ford why doe not once tast this banquet trust the wordes of our lord and begin and hee afterward will deliuer you out of all doubt
in times past that serpent into which moses rod was transformed seemed a farre off terrible and fearefull but being and handled by the hand it returned into his former state
not without reason sayth salomon
it naught

it is naught saith euery but when he is gone he glorieth· the like happeneth daily to men that are conuersant in this affaire
for not knowing in the beginning the value of this merchandize because they are not spirituall

haue any feeling of that which lyeth out being they thinke it to be deere and of no value but when they begin to tast how sweet our lord is they presently glory of their reward because there is no price worthy of so great a benefit
consider how that merchaunt in the gospell ioyfully sould all that which he had that he might buy the field in which he had found the treasure wherefore therfore doth not a christian contende hearing this name to know what it is truly it is a thing to be wondred at if some should assure thee that in thy house and in such a place a treasure were hidden thou wouldest not cease to digge and seeke and prooue if that were true which hee saide
but god himselfe that there an incomperable treasure hidden in thy mind wilt thou neuer be perswaded to seeke it out how quickly shouldst thou find this if thou didst onely know how neere our lorde is to all those that call vpon him howe manie men were there in this world who

weying their sinnes and perseuering in prayer haue obtayned the of their sinnes in lesse then weekes space haue opened earth and to speake more aptl haue found a new heauen and a new earth and began to feele in the kingdome of god how great is that which our lord doth· who sayth at what time so euer a sinner shall repent him of his sinnes will no more remember them· how great is this that this most father dooth who vppon short and scarce ended prayer or prodigall sonne could not containe himselfe any longer but hee embraced him and him with great ioy into his house· returne therefore my brother to this gracious and bountifull lift vppe thy heart in time conuenient faile not incessantly to at the gates of his mercy and assredly beleeue· that if thou perseuer with humility hee will at aunswere thee and shewe thee the secret treasure of his loue which when thou thou shalt say with the spouse in the cancles

if a man shall giue all the substance of his house for loue

hee esteeme it as nothing

the argument
it greatly deceaueth a christian man to perseuer in his sinnes and to excuse himselfe and say that hee will in short space amend his life for it blindeth his soule and it deepely in euill custome so that he accustometh himselfe more and more in sinne and causeth vice to take so deepe roote in man that but very hardly it may afterwards be rooted out

chap

notwithstanding all these which defende the cause of vertue enough the peruerser sort haue as yet certayne arguments whereby they labour to defend their slothfulnes
hee seeketh occasion that will forsake his friend but hee that doeth this is at all times of reprehension

for there are some who will aunsvvere in one onelie vvorde

saying that heereafter they will amend their liues but that now they cannot that they exspect some time some other oportunity to performe the same thinking now it is hard and that some few heereafter it will bee more easie· this errour truly is very great and greater then which may not any one be founde out for if a man perseuer in his euill life and heape sinne vpon sinne· how can he afterward more easily leaue them he shall be accustomed in his sinne and the habites of his minde are more depraued for in that future time which hee proposeth to himselfe if hee proceedeth in his wickednes that euill custome will be more confirmed and nature more weakned
the deuills power sh be greater in thee and thou shal be farther seperated from god and therefore grow more blinder mo addicted to sinne and as it were buried in the same
if therefore the difficulties of this cause be such who is hee of so corrupt judgement amongst vs that beleeueth his conuersion wil hereafter be more easie

causes of the difficulties euery ves encreasing for whereas dai sinnes are heaped on sinnes it is to bee doubted but that the the soule is bound multiplied the chaines it is tyed made stronger
the derstanding in time to come shall be more obscured through the vse of sinne the will shall be weakened to good works the appetite shall be more prone to all euill and the will be so weakned as that the may not be subdued thereby
which since it is so how can it be that thou shouldst beleeue that in time the affaire of thy will be more easie to thee and if thou say that thou canst not the foord in the when as the water is yet at the ebb in the euening when as the is full and the flood like a sea how canst thou get ouer it
if it seeme hard vnto to roote out this new plant of offences what wilt thou doe when it hath taken deepe roote and more strongly to the earth euer it did before put the case

that thou art nowe to fight with a hundreth sinnes and heereafter thou art to battell with a thousand nowe with the depraued custome of one or two yeeres then perchaunce with the imperfections of tenne yeeres· who therfore told that in to come thou mayst more beare thy burthen which at this present thou canst not sustaine as neuerthelesse both thy sinnes daily multiplied thy euil encrease doost thou not that these are the cauilations of debters who because they not repay the money they had borowed defer the payment from to day

but what amongst diuers thinges shall say of peruerse and the violence of his which detayneth a man confmed in his wickednes it is an ordnarie thing that he that driueth in naile first before he striketh it his hammer he firmely fixeth it the second time more firmely the third most strongly so in our euill workes that wee doe as were with a great mallet wee mo

deeply infixe sinne in our soules and ere cleaueth it so vnmooueablie that nothing may be founde that may drawe out or expell the same
hence it is that wee often see their to growe childish who haue consumed all theyr whole lyfe in wickednes and offence to ouerow with the dissolutions of their age althogh those yeeres repugne and nature it abhorres the same
and when as now nature her selfe is already wearied decayed· yet doth that custome which is as yet in force wander round about for impossible pleasures so much may the impatient tiranny of euill custome
hence it is said in the book of iob his bones shal be with the surfets of his youth

and with him shall sleepe in the dust so that these vices haue no terme nor any ende besides that which is common to all other things namely death the last limit of euery thing
hence is that of aristotle as in stroake of an aspis there is no except the parts that are poysoned be cut off so certayne sinns may only be healed by death

by death therefore these vices are ended although if we will confesse· the wee cannot truly say that they are ended by death for they endure alwayes for which cause iob also saith and with him shall they sleepe in the dust
the reason heereof is because that by the continuance of the olde custome which now is conuerted into another nature appetite of vices is nowe already rooted in the verie bones and marrow of the soule in no other sort then a consumption which is fixed in the bowels of a man excluding all cure and admitting no medicine
the same doth our sauiour shew in the resussitation of being foure dayes dead· in which he vnto whom all thinges were easie shewed a certaine for he was troubled in spirit· and declared that they had neede much calling vppon who are hardned in the custome of sinning to the ende they shoulde awake
other dead men hee reuiued with less words and signes that our lorde might signifie how great a it is for god to raise againe from

death a man buried foure dayes stinking that is to conuert a sinner buried in the custome of his sinne
but the first of these foure dayes as witnesseth saint augustine is the delight of tickling in the hart the second consent the third the deed and he that attaineth this fourth day as lazarus did is not raised againe but by our sauiours loude voyce and lamentable teares
all these things euidently declare the great which the deferring of repentance and conuersion bringeth with it and that by how much longer the repentance is deferred by so much it is made more difficult
consequently also by these it may be gathered how apparant their errour is· who say that the time will heereafter be more easie for their amendment

the argument
penitence is not to be deferred till the end of our liues for then is fauour hardly obtayned at gods hands and death is most dangerous for he that hath liued euilly dyeth worse since according to the workes the rewards are also

chap

others are so blind and bewitched that they are content with the misdeeds of the time past but they perseuer in the same to the end of their lyues and reserue their repentance till the houre of theyr deathes
time to be feared terme perrilous and doost thou persvvade thy selfe for so small a price to purchase the kingdome of heauen and that thou canst so easily attaine the seate of the angells seest thou not yt whatsoeuer is done in that houre is more of necessitie then of will is done rather by compulsion then liberty and proceedeth rather from feare then loue

and although of loue yet not of the loue of god but of whose property is to feare detriment and to flie incommodity seest thou not that it is contrarie to the lawe of iustice that hee that hath enthralled him selfe all the course of his life to the seruice of the deuill in the end should come vnto god and require rewarde at his handes
remembrest thou not those fiue foolish virgines of whom christ speaketh in the gospell which then began to prepare theyr account when it was to be iustified what other euent is to be exspected by thee if after thou art admonished by this example thou perseuer in this thy negligence and carelesnes god trulie can when hee will inspire true repentance into thee but howe often dooth hee it in that houre

and howe fewe are they that at that time truly repent

search saint augustine saint ambrose saint ierosme and all the doctors of the church you shall see how doubtfully and dangerously they speake of this matter
thou

also vnderstande howe great thy madnes is that without care presumest to saile so perilous a sea of which so exspert nauigators haue spoken so doubtfully and with so much feare
it is an art to die well which ought to bee learned in the whole lyfe for in the houre of death such and so great they be that make vs die that there scarce remayneth any time to teach vs to die well

it is a generall rule that such as the life of a man is such also is his death therefore whose life is euill his death also shall be euill except god alter the same by some speciall priuiledge
this is not mine but the apostles opinion who saith that the end of the wicked shall be aunswerable to theyr actions for in common speech neither is there a good ende to be exspected of workes neyther an euill of good
turne ouer all the search the diuine pages and thou shalt find nothing repeated so often as that as a man hath sowed so shal he reape that the wicked in the end of their lyues shall gather their fruites that

god shall giue to euery one accorng to his workes that the end of one shall be conformable to life which hee liued and that iustice of the iust shall be vppon head· and the curse vppon the ad of the reprobate and a thound such like sentences are euerie where found in the scriptures
if all the whole scripture might be foorth that that which issueth might be seene truly would appeare so often repeated then this sentence if all thy works are wicked what other prognostique can we giue from this astrolobe if such be the ende were the midst and what the life it selfe what other thing is there to bee exspected that thou shouldst gather in another lyfe but corruption that in this lyfe hast naught else but corruption for neyther sayth our sauiour doe we gather figgs of thornes

nor grapes from bryars
and if the house of a sinner be cast downe to death

and his to hell as sayth salomon what can let but that the end be such that the tree or wall

fall on that side towardes which bended and threatned ruine he whose life whose workes thoughts are wholy enclined to hell· which hee deserueth whether last shal he goe where is his place where is his mantion but in hell whether all that is his doe whether at length shall hee goe to enhabite that heere walketh in interiour darknes but to the exteriour obscurity why dost thou vainely perswade thy selfe that hee in the end of his pilgrimage shall come to heauen that readily walketh and hath alwayes vvandered tovvardes hell

this matter is largely handled lib
of the guide of a sinner chap
whence these things are taken

the argument
no man ought to abuse gods mercie nor vnder the hope thereof perseuer in sinne for if the same mercie doe so patiently suffer so many insidells in this worlde and euill christians in the church it will also suffer those that sinne bee damned

chap

and if thou say that the mercy of god is great and that it comforteth thee so much that perseuering in thy peruerse and wicked lyfe thou trustest that thou shalt be pray thee what sin may be more haynous thou sayst that the mercie of god is immeasurable for he would lyke an offender be crucified for sinners confesse it vely to be great for it suffereth thee to breake out into this cursed blasphemie such as is this that thou wilt that his bounty should fauour

thy iniquity thou shouldst take his crosse which hee apprehended as a meane that the kingdome of sinne might be destroyed thou takest it as a meane whereby sinne may be protected and defended and where thou owest him a thousand liues if thou hadst so many because hee sacrificed vp his life for thee there catchest thou an occasion also to deny him that life which thou hast nay rather that which thou receauedst from him
our sauiour more greeueth at this then the death it selfe which he suffered for thee for hee that lamenteth not in his death complaineth greeuously of thy sins by the prophet saying vpon my backe haue sinners built

they haue prolonged their iniquity
tell me pray thee who taught thee so to argue that by reason that god is good thou shouldst conclude that it is lawfull for thee to follow sinne and iniquity· the holy ghost seemeth to after another maner that by reon that god is good hee gatherh him to be worthy to honoured and aboue
and because

god is good it is reason also that man should be goode and hope in him who when hee is a most grieuous sinner is ready to receiue him into grace if with all his hart he conuert himselfe vnto him
because god is good and so good truly it is a double sinne to offende so great a goodnes
therefore by how much the more thou amplifiest the goodnes of god by so much the more doost thou make hainous thy sinne which thou committest against him
nowe is it requisite that so greeuous a sinne should bee punished for such is the nature and office of the diuine iustice which as thou thinkest is not opposite but a sister and reuenger of the diuine bounty that it cannot leaue so enormous an iniury vnpunished

therfore in thy sinne thinke not that thou hast any interest in the mercy of god but rather that his iustice attendeth thee innumerable others
heare pray you what the diuine mercy winketh at and suffereth
thou canst not deny me that of a hundred parts of thys worlde there is but one of them

christian and of ninety nine others there is not one of them to bee saued
for it is without all question that euen as without the arke of noe in the time of the no man was saued neyther out of the house of rahab in the citty of iericho so no man can be saued that is founde out of the house of god which is his church

but beholde that part which is made famous by the name of the christians and see in what estate the christian affaires doe stande in thys most corrupt world and thou wilt confesse that in this misticall body that from the sole of the foote vnto the crowne of ye head there is scarcly any member to be found that is sound
choose any one that best liketh thee of those famous citties in which the steps of pure sincere religion and doctrine are yet extant run afterward thorow all the lesser citties villages and castles in which there is scarce any of religion left and thou shalt finde the people of whom that of ieremy may truly bee affirmed walke about the wayes of ierusalem and

behold and consider and seeke thorowe the streetes thereof whether you finde a man dooing iudgment and seeking fayth that is a truly iust man and will bee mercifull vnto him
walke likewise not onely the tauerns and publique places for they for the most part are dedicated to lyes trifles and deceits looke into the houses of thy neighbours as ieremie did thou shalt know that there is no man that speaketh good

neyther shalt thou heare ought else but murmures lyes cursings othes blasphemies
there is no man that repenteth himselfe of his sinne saying what haue done

to conclude thou shalt in effect finde that the harts and tongues of men are imployed in no other thinges then earthly and priuate commodities neyther shalt thou heare god any otherwise named but in othes and blasphemies in which they abuse gods name which memory of his name god co~playneth of by the same prophet saying they remember me but not as they ought swering vntruly by my name

so that by the exterior signes it is scarely knowne whether this people be christian or gentile except it be after the maner that we know bells· which are seene a farre of but are knowne by their sounde so mayst thou knowe them by theyr othes and blasphemies which are meerely heard the rest can neyther be knowne nor iudged

but pray you howe may such be numbred amongst the rancke of those of who esay speaketh whosoeuer shall see them shall knowe them because these are the seede which god blessed
and if the lyfe of christians ought to bee such that they that behold them a far shoulde iudge them to be the sonns of god in what place ought they to be reckoned who rather seeme to bee scoffers deprauers deceauers and contemners of god then true christians

all these things are more amply discoursed by mee that thou mayst vnderstand that if notwithstanding the mercy of god which thou god permitteth so many infidells· and so many euill christians

to be in his church and so many of the infidels and euill christians to perrish that hee permitteth not thee also to perrish with them whose lyfe thou doost imitate
dyd the heauens perhaps reioyce vppon thy byrth or doe the iudgements of god and the lawes of the gospel then cease that the worlde may be one to thee and other to another man if therefore notwithstanding mercy hell so dilated so many thousand soules are daily swallowed vp by the same shal thy soule onely be excluded therfrom if thou perseuer in thy sinnes

what if wee referre hether also those terrible examples of diuine iustice which are found in scripture namely the fall of angels the ruine of adam and those thinges which succeeded the same to wit payne and misery if we induce the whole earth drowned by the deluge those fiue citties consumed by fire and brimstone dathan abiron swallowed vp by the earth aliue if nadab and abihu and out of the new testament wee adde the suddaine death of ananias and saphira to the

precedent what wilt thou thinke what wilt thou say what canst thou expect from the diuine mercy perseuering in thy sin but least thou shouldst say that god was seuere cruell in times past but now merciful and peaceable consider that with this affability clemency also hee suffereth al yt which thou hast heard neither shalt thou bee exempted or free from these but that thy punishment also shall attende thee albeit thou art called a christian if so be thou art found a sinner
shall god therfore loose his glory because hee condemneth thee hast thou pray thee any thing singuler in thee for which cause god should forbeare thee aboue any others with all thy good euil manners or hast thou som immunity which others haue not by reason of which hee should not condemne thee with the rest if thou be no lesse euil then they are consider pray thee the sonnes of dauid to them for the many singuler vertues of their father many priuiledges were promised yet neuerthelesse god woulde not leaue their sinnes vnpunished for which

cause some of the had an euil end
where is therefore thy vaine hope why doost thou vainly trust considering their that thou pertaking theyr sinnes shalt not be damned thou art deceiued my brother thou art deceiued if thou thinkest that is to hope in god
this is not hope but presumption
for it is hope to trust that god will forgiue all thy sinnes and receaue thee into fauour if thou art penitent and forsake thy euill wayes although thou art wicked and abhominable but it is presumption that thou shalt be saued and blessed in perseuerance of thy sinnes
thinke thou that it is no small fault for it is numbred amongst those that are committed against the holy ghost
for hee that presumeth after thys manner staineth the diuine bounty with no small iniury and ignominy which in especiall are attributed to the holy spirit
but these sinnes as witnesseth our sauiour are neyther forgiuen in thys world nor in the world to come

the argument
the excusation that the loue of the world is cause of sinne is false and inuented by a carnall christian who hath not tasted spiritual good and therefore neglecteth and contemneth the same which are good indeede and embraceth those that are false fraile and temporall which he knoweth not himselfe
for if he knew them hee should trulie perceiue how light are how vnworthy to be esteemed
contrariwise how profitable the spirituall are and how much to be beloued

chap

bvt perchance thou wilt say that the loue of thys world the thinges that are therein haue captiuated thy hart· and led thee from the way of iustice
thys is the excuse of a man that hath not tasted spirituall benefites therefore these carnal goods are so much esteemed by him
the clowne thinketh that there is nothing more precious then his cottage

because hee hath neuer seene the proude and stately buildings of great citties
the infant issuing out of his mothers wombe mourneth and weepeth because hee knoweth not that the world is far more better that hee entreth into then the prison from whence he issueth
the men of former times highly esteemed their cottages made of turffe and couered with straw before they saw more substantiall buildings
to all these may carnall men bee compared who neuer saw or had experience of the spirituall goods neyther tasted the sweetnes dignity nobility and beauty of the same and therefore they more esteeme these false and fraile benefites which indeede are nothing lesse then the spirituall which are onely thought worthy the name of benefites
for if they had knowne them it could not be but that they should despise those that are according to that of the prophet and thou shalt destroy thy siluer grauen plates and thy garment made of gold thou shalt disperse the like the menstruous cloth of a woman go out

thou say thereto
euen as therefore men haue cast away their false gods after they acknowledged the true god they also shall cast away and despise the false goods of this world euen presently as soone as they shal taste the true and celestiall goods
for as soone as a man hath tasted the sweetnes of spiritual things saith saint bernard he despiseth the flesh that is all the goods and pleasures of this world and thys is the principall reason of this error which so much blindeth the men of thys world

besides this errour there is another namely that men not onelie knowe not spirituall thinges but are also vtterly ignorant of temporall
for it is impossible that they should loue those temporall goods pleasures in such sort if they had the true knowledge of the spirituall
tell mee pray thee what is the world with all that which is in it if wee diligently pry into the same and obserue the fallacies thereof together with his weapons and manner of proceeding what other thing say is it but a den of dolors

and troubles a schoole of a market place of deceit a laboth of errours a prison of darknes way with theeues a full of mud and a sea which is mooued with stormes and tempests

what els is the world but a sterill land a fielde planted with thornes and bryers a woode full of brambles a flowring garden but producing no fruite vvhat is the world but a flood of teares a fountaine of cares a sweet venome a tragedy a delightfull frenzie

vvhat goods pray you are founde in the whole worlde which are not false and what euills that are not assured rest hath labour his securitie is without foundation his feare hath no cause his labours are without fruite his teares without purpose and purpose without successe his hope is vaine his fayned and his griefe true
repeating therefore all those thinges which are before spoken if by so manie reasons examples and experiences it be manifestly

that there is neither rest nor the felicitie which we seeke to be found but in god onely and not in the world why seek we it besides god and not rather him in it thys it is that blessed saint augustine admonisheth when he sayth run ouer the sea the earth and all thinges search the whole world thou shalt euery way repent thy selfe except god be thy refuge

the authour disputeth of thys matter most copiously in the guide of a sinner lib
chap

the argument
that the way of our lord is no more hard and difficult but made plaine and easie by christ and his benefites namely his passion resurrection and ascention as also indeuouring in the same wee are assisted by the holy ghost

chap

there are some that excuse themselues saying that the way of our lord is straite difficult because in the same there are diuers difficult precepts and such as are contrarie to humane affection and appetite
this is one of the most principall excuses which sluggish and slothfull men infer in this affayre
but they that say so although they be christians and liue in the law of grace notwithstanding they knowe not mistery neither haue they learned the first letter of this lawe
wretch that thou art thou that sayst art a christian tell mee why christ into the world why he his blood why instituted

hee his sacraments why sent the holy ghost what meaneth the voyce of the gospell what the worde of grace what includeth that most sacred name of if thou knowest it not aske of the euangelist and hee will tell thee thou shalt call his name iesvs· for hee shall redeeme his people fro theyr sinnes

what other thing is included in thys name of sauiour and deliuerer what other thing is it to bee saued and deliuered from sinnes then to obtayne remission of sinnes past and obtaine grace to estewe the same in time to come for vvhat other cause came our sauiour into the world but to helpe thee and to further thy saluation why would hee die vppon the crosse but hee might kill thy sinne why ri from death except to rayse thee and make thee walke in newnes of life why shedde he his most precious blood except to make a medicine or plaister to cure and heale wounds

for what other cause instituted hee the sacraments of the church

but for the remedy of thy sinnes what other fruit is there of his most bitter psion and comming into thys but that he might plaine and prepare the way which before was horred full of thornes straite and tedious

thys is that which the prophet esay that in the dayes of the messias

euery valley should be exalted and euery mountaine and hill humbled and all the euill indirect and tedious pathes should bee made plaine
finally why besides all these thinges sent hee the holie ghost from heauen but that thy flesh should be conuerted into spyt and why sent he him in the semblance of fire but that like fire hee should enflame illuminate transforme thee into himselfe should lyft it vp from whence at first it had descended whereto serueth grace with infused vertues which are begotten thereof but to lighten and make the yoake of our lord to make vertue easie that men might reioyce in tribulations they might hope in that may ouercom in temptations

this is the beginning this the middle and this the end of the gospell
it is needful also that we know that euen as one man a sinner namely adam made all men earthly and sinners so also that another man celestiall iust to wit christ came to make all men that will receiue him celestiall and iust
what other thing haue the written what other are the promises deliuered vnto vs by the prophets· what other things preached the this is the summe of christian thys is the word which our lorde vppon the earth
thys is that and abbreuiation which esay sayde hee heard of our lord which so many ritches of vertues and iustice did consequenthe follow

imagine thy selfe my brother that first thou commest as a young scholler to christian religion demaundest of a certaine wise diuine what it is that this new religion prescribeth hee will aunswere thee that nothing else it requireth at thy handes but that thou bee a good

man and that thou mayst endeuor in this study with fruit that the same religion giueth thee assistance for commaunding that a carnall man should be made a spiritual it giueth the holy spirit and by the benefite thereof he is made spirituall
truly it is to bee lamented that so manie yeeres thou hast borne the name of christ warfared vnder christ yet art ignorant of the difference which is betweene a christian and a iewe betweene the law of the letter and the lawe of grace
thys difference heerein consisteth for since thou knowest it not will teach it thee that the law of the letter commandeth a man to be good and yeeldeth not strength to performe that which is commaunded but the law of grace both commaundeth this and giueth grace and helpe to thee to be good and that thou mayst forsake thy sinnes
that commanded thee to fight but gaue thee no wepons whereby thou shouldst ouercome it commaunded thee to cende heauen but shewed no ladder commaunded men be spirituall but gaue them not

the holy ghost but now all other thinges are farre otherwise that former lawe being repealed and other succeeded farre from the other and that by the merrit and bloode of the onely sonne of god wherefore doost thou as if that olde lawe were not yet taken away nor christ had come into this worlde play the iewe as yet and trustest to thine ovvne strength supposing by thine owne fortitude that the lawe may be and thou iustified in that sort

not grace but charity also make this law light and easie for this is one of the chiefest effects of diuine charity

for which cause augustine saith that the of louers are no wayes but delightsome vnto them as are those of hunters and fishers for in that which is saith he eyther there is no labour or the labour is beloued
for this is the cause why saint paule saith with so much constancie

that nothing may seperate him from the loue of christ

and if we diligently consider likewise what christ and all the saints haue suffered it shall not be troublesome vnto vs to persecution for iustice and what so euer difficulty encombereth vs in the way of our lorde will seeme light vnto vs by all which it may bee gathered how the scriptures are to be reco~ciled the one with the other whereof some say that the way of our lorde is difficult other say it is easie
so dauid for the wordes of thy lipps kept hard wayes

and in another place

haue delighted in the way of thy testimonies as in all ritches for this way hath two in it difficulty and sweetenes one by reason of nature the other by grace so that what is difficult by reason of the one in respect of the other is made delicious and sweete
both of them our lorde spketh of when hee saith

that his yoake is sweet and his burthen light for he saith yoke he signifieth which is in the way of the lord but when he saith sweet he insinuateth facility which is by meanes of grace which is giuen

but if you shall aske mee howe it may be a yoake and sweet when as the nature of a yoake is to bee heauie to this aunswere that the reason hereof is this because our lord lightneth the same as he promiseth by his prophet and will be vnto them as hee that lightneth theyr yoake vpon theyr shoulders

what wonder is it therefore if the yoake bee light which our lorde sustaineth lifteth vp and as it were he himselfe beareth

if the bush burned and was not consumed because our lord was in it what wonder is it that the burthen shoulde be light if in the same the sayd lord be that helpeth vs to beare it will yee that showe yee as well the one as the other in one and the same person heare what the holy apostle sayth

wee suffer tribulation in all things yet wee not troubled we are approued but not forsaken we suffer persecution but are not left destitute we are hu~bled but not confounded wee are cast downe but we perrish not
behold heere on the one side there is labour trauell on the other comfort

and sweetnes which our lorde yeeldeth to them
truly the prophet esay insinuateth the same also when hee saith they that trust in the lorde

shall change their fortitude and shall assume winges as it were an eagle shall runne and not be trauailed shall walke and not be weary
doost thou see heere the yoke lightned by grace seest thou the fortitude of the flesh changed into the fortitude of the spirit or that may speake better the fortitude of man into the fortitude of god seest thou howe the holy prophet concealeth not eyther the trouble or the quiet thou hast not therefore my brother any cause for which thou shouldst abhor this way· although it be wearisome and difficult when so many so mighty the meanes be that make it plaine and easie

the argument
a man ought not to deferre his repentance and amendment of life from day to day but presently turne vnto our lord and repent for all his sinnes whereby hee hath offended the deuine maiestie and his neighbour

chap

well therefore my brother if on the one side there be so many and so effectuall reasons which call vs to the amendment of our lyues and on the other side we haue no iust excuse that may induce vs from reformation of our wayes
tell me pray thee how long doost thou deferre thy repentance· at the length wilt thou begin a manner of life looke into pray thy life and search all those yeeres which thou hast liued the age in which thou now liuest and thou vnderstand it is now time nay rather that the me is past in which for thy offences

thou wert to repent turne to god
remember thou art a christian regenerated by the water of baptisme that thou hast god for thy father the church for thy mother the milk of the gospell a dainty that thou art nourished by the apostolicall euangelicall doctrine that which is more worthy with the bread of angels that is with the most sacred sacrament of christes bodie and blood and by all these nothing at all bettered but to haue liued no lesse dissolutely then if thou hadst beene an ethnique without hauing any knowledge of god
for tell me what kinde of sinne is it which thou hast not committed what forbidden tree is there whose fruite thou hast not affected what fielde which thy lust hath not what euer hath beene offered to thy sight that thou hast not desired what appetite hast thou euer resisted vnder the remembrance of god and christian profession what els more couldst thou haue done if thou hadst not had faith if thou expectedst no other life after this if that strickt iudgement of god were not to be

feared what is thy life but a continuall web of sin a dunghill of vices a way beset with thornes and a rebellion against god with who hast thou hetherto liued but with thine owne appetites with the flesh with ambition with world these were thy gods these thy idols which thou seruedst who thou calledst vpon
tell me what respect hadst thou of gods law obedience towards him euen no more didst thou feare him then he had bin a wooden god
for it is most certaine that there are many christians that with the same facility they would sinne if they beleeued god were not doe also now sin notwithding they beleeue yt there is a god they offend no lesse offending one then they would do if they beleeued none and what greater iniury may be done to ye diuine maiesty finally beleeuing all those things which christian religion proposeth to be beleeued thou hast so liued as any other wold haue liued who thought all our faith to be but an olde wiues tale and very ridiculous toyes

and if the multitude of thy sinnes

that are past terrifie thee not the facility thou co~mittedst them stir thee not at what doth not his maiesty and highnes moue thee against whom thou hast sinned lift vp thine eyes behold the immensity and greatnes of that lord who the powers of heauen adore before whose maiesty lies prostrate whatsoeuer the circuit of the world containeth in whose presence whatsoeuer is created is naught else but a light strawe and see how vnwoorthy it is that thou so abiect a worme as thou art darest so often offend and prouoke the eyes of so great a maiestie vnto anger

consider the fearefull greatnes of his iustice and the memorable punishments which fro the beginning hetherto hee hath exercised in the world with whom he hath persecuted sinnes not onely in perticuler persons but in whole kingdomes citties prouinces also yea in the whole world neither in the world only but in the heauens not only in strangers sinners but also against his most innocent sonne who would satisfie for all that which we ought

nowe if that be done in a greene wood and for other mens sins what shall be done in a dry and for our owne sinns what therefore more fondly more imprudently may be done then that a vile miserable man durst delude god who hath so powerful hands that if he extend them and touch him with them with a verie little touch hee can thrust him headlong into the depth of hell

mark besides this the patience of this lord who so long time exspecteth thee as long as thou hast offended him and if thou after so many ritches long suffering of patience hee hath hetherto exspected thee perseuer in abusing his mercy prouoking his wrath
he will shake his sword

and bende his bow in which he hath prepared the vessels of death and he will shoote his arrowes against thee

wey the profundity and bottomlesse pit of his iudgements of which wee reade and daily see admirable miracles and examples
let vs behold salomon after his so admirable wisedome after his edition of three thousand parables after the most

profound misteries he wrote in the canticles lying prostrate before idolls and reprooued by god
let vs behold one of those seauen deacons of the primatiue church fulfilled with the light power of the holy ghost made not only an heretique but an arch heretique and an author and father of heresies
we see daily many stars of the heauen fall to the earth with a miserable ruine to wallow in the durt to eate the huskes of the hoggs who a little before sitting at gods table were nourished with the bread of angells
and if the iust for some hidden pride negligence ingratitude were in that man nere cast out of gods fauour hauing many yeres serued him what must thou exspect who hast done naught else in thy life but offend god instantly

let vs see therfore now thou that hast liued thus is it not that at length thou giue ouer to heape sin on sinne or conioine with debts is it not needfull that now thou begin to god disburthen thy soule doth not reason

require that thou hold thy selfe content that the remainder of that thou hast bestowed on the worlde the flesh and the deuill bee giuen to him that gaue thee all things is it not rightfull that after so long a time so many iniuries done vnto god thou at last feare the diuine iustice which by howe much the more greater patience it tollerateth thy sinnes by so much the more greeuous torments and greater iustice dooth he chastise sinners is it not woorthily to be feared that so long a time thou hast continued in sinne so long liued in the disfauour of god to haue so mighty an aduersary who of a gracious father is made a iudge and an enemy is it not to be feared least that the violence of euill custome be turned into another nature and arise a necessity of sinne and somewhat more is it not to bee suspected least thou fall by little and little into greater offences and that thou be deliuered into a reprobate sence into which when a man is falne hee hath not then any reason of any thing how great soeuer it be

iacob the patriarch sayde to his father in lawe laban fourteene yeeres haue serued thee all thy possession was in my hands haue hetherto administred all thy domesticall affaires it is requisite therfore that at last prouide for mine owne house
and thou if thou hast serued the worlde so many yeeres were it not conuenient that now at length thou shouldest beginne to prouide for thy soule and somewhat more circumspectly then heeretofore regard the happinesse of the life to com there is not any thing more short and fraile then mans life
and if thou so carefully studiest for things necessary in this so fraile lyfe why doost thou not also imploy some labour in those things which shall perpetually endure

the argument
it is necessary that a man co~sider him selfe and remember that hee is a christian and firmely assent to all thinges which our fayth setteth downe whereto eyther loue or feare ought to mooue him
what thing so euer is created inuiteth vs to the loue seruice of god
let a man therefore seeke wisedome and hee shall heare all the words of christ who was crucified for his saluation

chap

all these beeing thus pray thee now my brother and intreate thee by the blood of christ to call thy selfe to account and remember that thou art a christian and beleeue all those things which our fayth preacheth vnto thee
thys fayth sayth that thou hast an appointed iudge before whose eyes all thy steps and moments of thy life are present bee assured that the time will one day come wherein he will call thee to account for euery act yea to the least idle word this fayth teacheth a man that when he dieth he doth

not altogether perrish but that after this temporall lyfe there remaineth an eternall that our soules die not our bodies but that our bodies buried in the earth our soules out another region a newe worlde where they shall haue a lot and societie aunswerable to theyr life and manners in this world
thys fayth auoweth the reward of vertue and the punishment of sinne to bee high mighty that if the world were full of bookes all creatures were writers first should the wryters be wearied and first should all bookes be replenished before eyther matter wanted to discourse of them both or sufficient might be written· what they containe in them to theyr greatnes
that certifieth that so great are our debts which we owe vnto god and the benefites we receaue his handes that if a man shoulde so many yeres as there are sands the ocean shoares they shoulde of small continuance if they all of them consumed in the seruice of god
finally the fayth testifieth vnto thee that

vertue is a thing so precious that all the treasures of this world al that which mans hart can either desire or is not any wayes to bee compared therewith

if therefore such and so manie things inuite thee to vertue howe commeth it to passe that there are found so rare and few louers followers of the same if men be moued by profit what greater profit then eternall life if by feare of punishment· what torture more terrible then that of hell if by reason of the debt obligation or benefits what greater debt then that wherein wee are bound vnto god as well by reason of him that is himselfe in himselfe as for those things we haue receiued of him
if feare of danger moue vs what greater perrill then death whose houre is so vncertaine and reason so strict if peace libertie tranquilitie of spirit and sweetnesse of life be desired of the whole world it is manifest that all these are more aboundantly found in the life which is led according to the prescript of vertue then that which past ouer according to a mans

and humane passion for a man is created reasonable not a brute beast and without reason
but if all these seeme to haue but small moment to perswade vertue shall it not suffice to see god descend from heauen vpon the earth and made man and whereas in sixe dayes hee had created the whole world he consumed thirty yeeres and lost his life in reforming and redeeming man
god dieth that sinne may die and we will that that liue in our harts to depriue thee of life for which the very sonne of god suffered death and what shall say more there are many reasons in this one for say not that christ is to be behelde hanging on the crosse but whether so euer we turne our eyes wee shall finde that all thinges exclaime and call vs to this goodnes for there is not a creature in this world if it be well considered that doth not inuite vs to the loue seruice of our lord
so that as many creatures as there are in this world so many preachers are they books reasons and voyces which excite and inuite vs to that office
how is it therefore possible

that so many voyces so many promises so many threatnings suffice not to worke the same in vs vvhat could god doe more then he did and promise more liberally then he promised and threaten seuerely then hee threatned that hee might draw vs to him and driue vs from sinnes and is the arrogance of men as yet so great or to speake more aptly are men in such sort inchanted· that hauing faith they feare not to rest all their life time in sins to goe to bed in sinne to rise and awake from sleepe in sinne and that with such security and without any scruple as that neither for the same sleepe flieth from their eyes neyther their appetite to eate perisheth in no other sort then if all they beleeue were dreames or that the euangelists did write were lies

tell me thou traytour tell mee thou titius that art to burne in perpetuall flames of hell what couldst thou doe although that that thou beleeuest were lies for see thee for feare of temporall iustice refraine thy appetites in sort but for the feare of god see

thee not abstaine from any thing to which thy voluptuousnes draweth thee neyther estewest thou the reuenge neither doest thou that which he commaundeth neither art thou ashamed to doe all that which thou desirest if thou hast power to performe it
tell me thou blind man tell me thou foole in such security what doth the worme of thy conscience where is thy faith where is thy braine where thy iudgment where thy reason which as thou art a man is onely remaining vnto thee
how canst thou but feare so great assured and true perrils and if a man should sette meate before another though a lyer shold they were infected with venom durst thou either prooue or tast the although they were most delicate sweet and not beleeue the lyer told thee this and if the
apostles euangelists yea

and god himselfe should affirme say thee death is in that pot is in this meate wretched death is in this little pleasure the deuil presenteth thee with can it be but that thou shoul

be afraid to take death with thine owne hands and drink thine owne perdition what doth that faith doe in thy hart what the iudgement what the reason that thou hast where is thy light when as none of these can stay the streame of thy sinnes wretch franticke sencelesse strooken with astonishment by the enemy condemned to perpetuall darknes interiour exteriour for from this to these is a short cut blind to see thine owne misery ignorant to vnderstand thine owne harmes and harder then adamant that feelest not the mallet of the diuine worde a thousand times miserable worthy whom all men should bemoane not in other teares the he shed for thy perdition who said if thou likewise hadst known

yea euen in this thy day things that belonged to thy what to thy tranquility what to riches which god hath prepared thee but now they are hidden thine eyes
wretched day of natiuity but more wretched the of thy death which shall be the of thy perdition
alas

farre more better had it beene that thou hadst neuer beene borne then perpetually to be damned howe far better had it beene if thou hadst not beene baptized nor professour of the faith for because thou hast abused them thy damnation shall be the greater
for if the light of reason suffice to make the philosophers inexcusable

because whe they knew god they glorified him not neither thanked him as god as saith the apostle how lesse excusable are they who hauing receaued the light of faith and the water of baptisme so often times come to his supper to receaue god himselfe and daily heare his diuine doctrine if they doe no more then those philosophers what other thing is to be concluded of all these which are hetherto said then that there is not any either vnderstanding wisedome or counsaile in the world then that forsaking the occupations and impediments of this life we folow the only and certaine path that leadeth vs to true peace and eternall life
to this reason equity and the law inuite vs to this heauen earth hell life death

iustice and gods mercy to this especially the holy ghost exhorteth vs by the mouth of ecclesiasticus saying

my sonne receaue learning fro thy youth and thou shalt find wisedom in thine olde age
euen as he that ploweth and hee that soweth come vnto her sustaine or expect the fruits therof with patience for in the work thereof thou shalt labor but a little and quickly shalt thou eate of the generations thereof heare my sonne take the counsaile of vnderstanding despise not my precepts
thrust thy feete into her fetters and into her chaines thy neck subiect thy shoulders beare the same thou shalt not be wearie of her bonds
search her out and she wil appeare vnto thee being made continent leaue her not for in the later times shalt thou find rest in the same and it shall turne thee vnto ioy
and her fetters shal be vnto thee a protection of strength and foundations of vertue and the garments thereof a stoole of glory for the ornament of life is in her and her bonds a healthfull thraldome
hetherto ecclesiasticus by which

words in some sort is vnderstoode howe great the beauty howe great the delights how much the liberty how many the ritches of true wisedom is which is vertue it selfe and the knowledge of god of which we now speake
and if all these are not sufficient to conquer thy hurt lift vp thine eyes on high doe not thou regard the waters of this world which perish and vanish away but behold the lord that hangeth on the crosse dying and satisfying for thy sinns he hangeth there in that forme yu seest exspecting thee with his feete fastned with rough nailes his armes opened to receaue thee his head bowed that like to a prodigall sonne he may giue thee the kisse of new peace
and from the crosse hee calleth thee if perhaps thou heare him with so many voyces hee crieth vnto thee as he hath wounds in his body

imagine this most blessed sauior speaking to thy hart saying returne returne thou sunamite

returne returne will receaue thee
know thou hast committed fornication with many louers

yet returne

to me and will forgiue thee returne to mee because am thy father thy god thy creator thy sauiour thy true friend thy only benefactor thy absolute felicity and thy last end
in me shalt thou finde rest peace saluation truth wisedom and all goodnes in me shalt thou find the fountaine of liuing water which extingsheth all thirst maketh a man attaine euerlasting life
in me shalt thou be as a tree planted by the water side that yeeldeth his fruite in due season and his leafe shall not fall all that thou doest shall prosper

incline thine eare therefore my brother and heare for if his prayers be execrable that heareth not the cry of the poore much lesse shal he be heard that is deaffe heere and heareth not these prayers and lamentations
the end of the first part

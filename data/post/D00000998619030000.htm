which chap of magna charta is expresse by name confirmed in the petition of right made in the third yeare of the present king charles which absolutely abolisheth all lawes made in derogation of the said just law which petition of right and every clawse therein contained is expresly confirmed by this

present parliament as appeares by the statute that abolished the star chamber and the statute that abolished ship money
and that learned man of the law sir edward cooke in his exposition of magna charta which booke is published to the publique view of the kingdome as law by two speciall orders of the present house of commons as in the last pag thereof you may read who in his exposition of the
chap of magna charta
part institutes fol
saith that by peers is meant equalls and in fol
he saith the generall division of persons by the law of england is either one that is noble and in respect of his nobility of the lords house of parliament or one of the commons of the realm and in respect thereof of the house of commons in parliament and as there be divers degrees of nobility as dukes marquesses earles viscounts and barons and yet all of them are comprehended within the word pares so of the commons of the realme there be knights esquires citizens yea men and burgesses of severall degrees and yet all of them of the commons of the realm and as every of the nobles is one a peer to another though he be of a severall degree so is it of the commons and as it hath been said of men so doth it hold of noble women either by birth or by marriage but see hereof chap
and in his exposition of chap
pag
ibim he saith no man shall be disseised that is put out of seison or dispossessed of his that is lands or or of his liberties or free customes that is of such franchises and freedomes and as belong to him by his free unlesse it be by the lawfull judgement that is verdict of his equals that is men of his owne condition or by the law of the land that is to speake once for all by the due course and processe of law

no man shall be in any sort distroyed to destroy id est what was first built and made wholly to overthrow and pull downe unlesse it be by the verdict of his equalls or according to the law of the land
and so saith hee is the sentence neither will we passe up him to be understood but by the judgement of his peers that is equalls or according to the law of the land see him fol

but the roule is

so that by what hath been said it cleerly evidently and undeniably appeares by the law of the land and the lords owne confession that they are not the peers or iudges of commoners in any criminall cases whatsoever and we offer at our utmost peril before any legall power in england to maintaine it by the knowne and declared law of the land which the lords themselves have solemnly covinanted and sworne to maintaine that the lords by the law of england have not in the least any iurisdiction at all over any of the commons of england in any criminall cases whatsoever
but if the studious and industrious reader please to read that notable and late printed booke called regall tyranny discovered he shall find that the author of that booke in his
and
pages layes downe many strong and solid arguments to prove that the house of lords have not justly neither judicative noe legislative power at all in them and in his

pages he declares from very sound and good authority that before william the conquerour and invader subdued the rights and priviledges of parliaments that the king and the commons held and kept parliaments without temporall lords bishops or abbots the

two last of which viz
bishops and abbots he proves had as true and good right to sit in parliament as any of the present lords now sitting at westminster either now have or ever had yea and out of the

pages of that notable and very usefull to be knowne book called the manner of holding parliaments in england before and since the conquest declares plainly that in times by past there was neither bishops earle nor baron and yet even then the kings of england kept parliaments with their commons only and though since by innovation bishops earles and barons have been by the kings prerogative charters which of what legall or binding authority they are you may fully read in the lords and commons declaration this present parliament summoned to sit in parliament yet not withstanding the king may hold a parliament with the commonalty or commons of the kingdome without earles and barons and saith mr will

which booke is commanded to be printed by speciall authority of the present house of commons out of mr iohn vowells manner of holding parliaments which is recorded in holingh cron of ireland fol

doe declare first that none of the parties to that agreement had any authority by any act of theirs to bind that country to any such nutrality as is mentioned in that agreement it being a peculiar and proper power and priveledge of parliament where the whole body of the kingdome is represented to bind all or any part
and we say the body of the kingdome is represented only in the house of commons the lords not being in the least chosen or represent any body at all yea and the house of commons calls their single order for the receiving of may

an order of the house of parliament yea and by severall single orders have acted in the greatest affaires of the commonwealth

and yet notwithstanding all this the lords like a company of men for they have often solemnly sworne to maintaine the law have by force and violence indeavoured to their power and contrary to law to assume to themselves a judicative power over us who are commons of england in criminal cases and for refusing to stoop therunto have barbarously for many moneths tirannized over us with imprisonments
and we according to that duty we owe to our native country and to our selves and ours for the preservation of our selves and the good and just declared lawes and libertise of england and from keeping our selves and our posterities from vassalage and bondage did thereupon according to law and justice appeale to the honourable house of commons as you may truly and largely read in divers and sundry bookes published by us and our friends as the supreame and legall power and judicature in england whom we did thinke and judge had been chosen of purpose by the free men of england to maintaine the fundamentall good lawes and liberties thereof but to their everlasting shame and the amazement of all that chose and betrusted them we are forced to speake it we have not yet found any reall intentions in them to performe unto us the trust in that particular reposed in them by the whole kingdome neither have we any grounded cause to say in truth any otherwise of them but that they are more studious and in deviding hundred thousands of pounds of the common wealths money amongst themselves then in in actuall doing to us in whom all and every the commons of england are concerned for what by the wills of the lords is done to us to day may by

expresly tell us that all interests of publique trust is only for the publique good and not for private advantages nor to the prejudice of any mans particular interest much lesse of the publique and in the same page they further say that all interests of trust is limitted to such ends or uses and may not be imployed to any other especially they that have any interests only to the use of others as they confesse all interests of trust are cannot imploy them to there owne or any other use then that for which they are intrusted yea and page

part book decl pag they tell the king that the whole kingdome it selfe is intrusted unto him for the good and safety and best advantage thereof and as this trust is for the use of the kingdome so ought it to be managed by the advice of the houses of parliament whom the kingdome hath intrusted for that purpose it being their duty to see it be discharged according to the and true intent thereof and as much as in them lyes by all possible meanes to prevent the contrary

and therefore negatively in the second place we are sure that the house of commons by their owne declarations were never intentionally chosen and sent to westminster to devide amongst themselves the great offices and places of the kingdome and under pretence of them to make themselves rich and mighty men with sucking and deviding among themselves the vitall and heart blood of the common wealth viz its treasure now lying not in a swound but even a gasping for life and being but let us see whether this and other of their late doings be according to their former protestations imprecations and just declarations which if they be not woe to them for saith the spirit of god eccle

but we wish withall our soules they had intended what they here declared when they declared it which is too much evident to every rationall mans eyes that sees and knowes their practises that they did not or that if they did that they have broken and falcified their words and

woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for yee make cleane the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excesse
yee also appeare outwardly righteous unto men but within yee a full of hypocrisie and iniquity

and in their declaration of july
concerning the destractions of the kingdome pag speaking of the businesse of hull they say the war being thus by his majestie begun the lords and commons in parliament hold themselves bound in conscience to raise forces for the preservation of themselves the peace of the kingdome and protection of the subjects in their persons and estates according to law the defence and security of parliament and of all those who have been imployed by them in any publique service for these ends and through gods blessing to disappoint the designes and expectations of those who have drawne his majestie to these courses and counsells in favour of the papists at home the rebbels in ireland the forraign enemies of our religion and peace

in the opposing of all which they desire the concurrence of the well disposed subjects of this kingdome and shall manifest by their courses and indeavours that they are carried by no respects but of the publique good which they will alwayes preferre owne lives and fortunes
that we might not too justly say they are already falne from their words

and in their most notable declaration of august
pag
being in great distresse they cry out in these words and we doe here require all those that have any sence of piety honour or compassion to helpe a distressed state especially such as have taken the protestation and are bound in the same duty with us unto their god their king and country to come in to our aid and assistance this being the true cause for which we have raised an army under the command of the earle of essex with whom in this quarrell we will live and dye

and in their answer to his majesties message of the
of no
they have words god who sees our innocency and that we have no aims but at his glory and the publique good golden language but without reall performance are but an execrable abomination in the sight of god and all rationall men

but when these declarations and promises were solemnly made the authors of them tooke it extream ill at the hands of the king when he told them they dissembled and meerly themselves and their own honour and greatnesse which he doth to the purpose in severall of his declarations but especially in his declaration of the
august
pag
where speaking of the earnest desire he had to ease and satisfie his subjects he saith that whilst we were busie in providing for the publique they were contriving particular advantages of offices and places for themselves and made use under hand of the former grievances of the subiect in things concerning religion and law and in the next pag speaking of their zeale against the
he declares their designe was but of their goodly revenue to erect stipends to their owne clergy and to raise estates to repare their owne broken fortunes
and in the same remonstrance pag
he declares that after feares and jealousies were begun they would suffer no meanes to compose it but inflamed the people because he saith they knew they should not only be disappointed of the places honours and imployments they had promised themselves but be exposed to the justice of the law and the just hatred of all good men

all which they in their antient and primitive declarations disdaine as most dishonourable to be fixed upon them or supposed ever intentively to be acted by them especially so visibly that any should be able to see it and therefore in their remonstrance bo dee
par pa
they labour to perswade the people not to destroy themselves by taking their lives liberties and estates out of their hands whom they have chosen and betrusted therewith and resigne them up to some evill counsellours about his majestie who they say are the men that would perswade the people that both houses of parliament containing all the peers and representing all the commons of england would destroy the laws of the land and liberties of the people wherein besides the trust of the whole they themselves in their owne particulars have so great an interest of honour and estate that we hope it will gaine little credit with any that have the least use of reason that such as have so great a share in the misery should take so much paines in the procuring thereof and spend so much time and run so many hazzards to make themselves slaves and to destroy the property of their estates
but we lay in the bitternesse of our soules
that their actions and dealings with us and many other free men of england had not given too just and grounded cause to judge that the forementioned charge of the kings was righteous just and true upon them and which if their owne consciences were not seared with hot irons and so past feeling would tell them with horror that he spoake the truth

and in the forementioned most notable declaration pag
one of the principall things they complaine of against the king and his evill counsellers

that they endeavour to possesse the people that the parliament will take away the law and introduce an arbitrary government a thing say they which every honest morall man abhors much more the wisedome justice and piety of the two houses of parliament

and in truth such a charge as no rationall man can beleeve it it being impossible so many severall persons as the houses of parliament consists of

about
and in either house all of equall power shall all of them or at least the major part agree in acts of will and tyranny which make up an arbitrary government

and most improbable that the nobility and chiefe gentry of this kingdome should conspire to take away the law by which they injoy their estates are protected from any act of violence and power and differenced from the meaner sort of people with whom otherwise they should be but fellow servants

and when they come to answer the kings maine charge laid to them in his declaration in answer to theirs of the
of may
they say book decl pag

as for that concerning our inclination to be slaves it is affirmed that his majestie said nothing which might imply any such inclination in us but sure what ever be our inclination slavery would be our condition if wee should goe about to overthrow the lawes of the land

and the propriety of every mans estate and the liberty of his person

for therein we must needs be as much patients as agents

and must every one in his turn suffer our selves whatsoever we should impose upon others we have ever refused to doe or suffer our selves and that in a high proportion
but there is a strong and vehement presumption that we affect to be tyrants and what is that because we will admit no rule to governe by but our own wills

but we wish the charge might not too truly be laid upon you
for our parts we aver we feele the insupportable weight of it upon both our shoulders

and therefore to conclude this we desire to informe you that in severall of their declarations they declare and professe they will maintaine what they have sworne in their protestation the which if you please to read you shall find there amongst other things that they have sworne solemnly to maintaine the lawfull rights and liberties of the subject and every person what ever that shall lawfully indeavour the preservation thereofe and therefor book decl
part pag
they solemnly imprecate the iudgements of god to fall upon them if they performe not their

vowes

promises and dutyes and say woe to us if we doe it not at least doe our utmost indeavours in it for the discharge of our duties and the saving of our soules and leave the successe to god almighty

now what the liberty of the subject is they themselves in their declarations excellent well discribe and declare that it is the liberty of every subject to injoy the benefit of the law and not arbitrarily and illegally to be committed to prison but only by due course and processe of law nor to have their lives liberties nor estates taken from them but by due course and processe of law according to magna charta and the petition of right who condemnes as unjust all interrogatorie proceeding in in a mans owne case nor to be denied habias corpusses nor baile in all cases whatsoever that by law are baileable and to injoy speedy tryalls without having the just course of the law abstructed against them

they decleare it is the liberty and priviledge of the people to petition unto them for the ease and redresse of their grievances and oppressions and that they are bound in duty to receive their petitions their owne words are these we acknowledge that we have received petitions for the removall of things established by law and we must say and all that know what belongeth to the course and practise of will say that we ought so to doe that our predicessors and his majesties ancestors haue constantly done it there being no other place wherein lawes that by experience may be found grievous and burthensome can be altered or appealed and their being no other due and legall way wherein they which are agrieved by them can seeke redresse yea in other of their declarations they declare that is the liberty of the people in multitudes to come to the parliament to deliver their petitions and there day by day to waite for answers to them part

and there is not a little harmony betwixt these their declarations and the antient and just law of the land as appeares by the statute of

one of the principall ends of calling of parliaments is for the redresse of the mischiefes and grievances that dayly happen and therefore saith he ibim the parliament ought not to be ended while any petition dependeth undiscussed or at least to which a determinate answer is not made but truly we are afraid that if this last rule should be observed this present parliament must sit tell the day of judgement for we foe our particulars may truely say it is the furthest thing in their thoughts duly to redresse the grievances of the people for care they take none for any thing we can see but how to accomplish their owne pecuniary ends and to study wayes how to increase mischiefe and grievances and to involve the generallity of the people in an everlasting case of confusion by making their wills and lusts a law their envy and malice a law their coveteousnesse and ambition a law for we for our parts are necessitated to declare with anxiety of spirit that we can obtaine no justice nor right at their hands though we have long since appealed to them for it yet can we not obtain so much justice from them as to get our reports made in the house from their owne committee they themselves appointed to examine our businesse neither can we so much as get our businesse publiquely debaited in the house because as it seemes they have no time to spare to spend to redresse the commons grand grievances from their weighty imployments in unjustly sharing vast sums of the common wealths money among themselves although we have not ceased to use all the legall meanes that both our own braine and all the friends and interests we had about london could furnish us with and when they failed us god himselfe raised us up divers friends in the country of our fellow commons who made oppressions their owne and of their selves before we know any thing were about framing a petition in our behalfe which as soone as wee knew it we could not chuse but tooke upon it as to us in the nature of a resurrection from the dead who we have too iust cause to thinke were buried alive and swallowed up quick in the canaball breasts and mans of the man eating and devouring house of lords and therefore as paul in the like case said in the tim

the lord mercy unto the house of onesiphorus for he oft refreshed me and was not ashamed

of my chaine

even so say we in the inlargednesse of our soules the lord give mercy to the honest and saint like inhabitants of buckinghamshire and harford shire for they have greatly and extraordinarily refreshed us and were not ashamed of our chaines and bonds for the libertys of their country and when they were in london sought us out very diligently and found us and not only so but the greatest part of ten thousand of them as we understand subscribed a petition for us to the house of commons to desire them according to their duty to deliver us out of the devouring paus of the tyrannicall house of lords and to free us from their arbitrary and illegall power and divers hundreds of them at their owne costs and charges through much underhand opposition came to the cities of london and westminster about or upon the

but not finding speedy and free accesse to the house of commons with their petition according to their just expectation their owne primative practice and publiquely declared duty in which regard they left behind them
of themselves as commissioners for all the rest to improve their utmost interests to get the petition to be delivered and read in the house and gave unto them instructions in writing to explaine some things in the petition in case they were called into the house and then to give a perfect account unto them what was done about their petition but their commissioners waited with all deligence upon the house till the or
of feb
and improved as we credibly understand all their interests in all or the most of their own knights and burgesses but could not by all the meanes they could use get their petition read in the house the reason of which we are not able to render unlesse it be that the peoples chosen trustees of the house of commons are resolved to betray their trust and to sacrifice the lives liberties and proprieties of all the commons of england to the mercilesse tyranny and barbarous cruelty of the house of lords oh commons of england awake awake and looke seriously and carefully about you before you be made absolute vassells and slaves unto the lusts and wills of those that you have preserved alive with your blood and treasures from whom yee deserve better then you find or are likely to injoy

the lord grant unto the foresaid men of and harfordshire that they may find mercy of the lord in the day of their account

and the lord god grant that their spirits may not faint flag nor be weary but that they may reneue their strength double and trible their petition and never give over till they have made them and their posterity free from the bondage of the lords and shakt of all arbitrary power whatever
and the lord god of heaven raise up the spirit of all their fellow commons in all the countys of england to second them and joyne with them in that legall just and righteous worke they have begun and to glue their hearts and soules together as jonathan and davids was that they may never part nor be devided till they have accomplished their just enterprise and the good lord require all their kindnesses and labour of love manifested unto us poor afflicted and distressed prisoners seven fold into their owne bosoms

but now in regard our friends nor their commissioners cannot get their petition to be delivered in which regard they have all left the city and parliament as dispairing in obtaining their just end at the present and are gone down into the country truly to acquaint the rest of their friends how they have been dealt with we judge it our duty that we are so much bound to our selves and the whole kingdome though we must truly confesse that we have no such commission from the petitioners not their commissioners as to publish a true copy of their petition and instructions which thus followeth

now therefore our most humble request unto your honours is that you would according to your duties and the great trust reposed in you take into your consideration the slavish condition that we the free people of england are yet subject unto by reason of those arbitrary practises that are still continued acted and perpetrated upon us by some prerogative men of this kingdome whom we humbly conceive have no power over our bodies or estates they being not elected thereunto by the of england and therefore may not commit our bodies to prison contrary to the fundamentall lawes of this kingdome as we suppose hath been done to some of this kingdome without producing any legall authority that your petitioners can heare of for what they did
wherefore your petitioners most humble desire is that you would according to the respective appeals of the said free subjects unto this supream house be pleased to take their cause into the legall judgement and speedie determination of this house as the whole matter thereof shall be reported unto you by the honourable committee for consideration of the commons liberties who have their whole manner of the proceedings against them together with their respective defences ready to represent unto your honours and to grant unto them your indubitable justice according to their late petitionary and still constant desires whereby they may receive the sentence of this house either for their present justification or condemnation that they may not be ruined and undone by an arbitrary and injustifiable imprisonment
and if that through the urgent affaires of the kingdome your occasions will not afford you so much time as to consider and expedite their businesse at present our humble request is that you would by an order from this house forthwith set them free out of prison they giving legall security for their future forth comming untill such time as your honours shall be pleased to hand out to them full and effectuall justice
and that you would be pleased in case the principall informers and actors be found guilty to grant them full and ample reparations according to the law of the land
and further that you would take care for the time to come to free us and our children from the feare and prejudice of the like and prerogative proceedings according to your late promise in your most just declaration of the
of aprill

but considering that by natures principall we are bound to the utmost of our power to preserve our selves and to leave no wayes and meanes unattempted that tends thereunto we cannot yet sit still but goe on and the rather because our iudges to whom we have appealed to for justice tell us in their declaration of the

which wee demonstrate thus they are all as they call themselves subjects and therefore though their priviledges be great as they are parliament men yet they are or at least ought to be by their owne confession subject to the severitie of the law in cases of treason felony and breach of the peace

which is also averred by that able and learned lawyer sir edward cooke in his
part institutes chap of the high court of parliament fol
which booke is published by their owne speciall order but we read not in any of their declarations that they themselves aver any such thing of the king
and therefore if by themselves their arguments be esteemed just and sound against him for not doing his duty who is much more fortified by law then themselves then much more when they cease to doe their duty and in practise destroy the lawes and liberties of the kingdome and subject the free men thereof to an arbitrary and tyrannicall power which we aver they have done us will their owne arguments serve and bee sound and good against themselves

therefore we desire to declare unto you that when they apprehended themselves in danger they sent unto his majestie the

and desire him that they may have a guard in which message they have these words
they have therefore their recourse unto your maiestie most humbly beseeching you that if it may with your good if they provide for their owne safety which the very law of nature

and reason doth allow unto them it is their humble desire that they may have a guard out of the city of london commanded by the earle of essex lord chamberlaine of your maiesties of whose fidelity to your maiestie and the common wealth they have had large experience

and in their petition to his maiestie about the militia
march
book decl part pag after they have told his majestie what danger they are in for want of setling the militia they use these very words
wherefore they are inforced in all humility to protest that if your maiestie shall persist in that denyall the dangers and distempers of the kingdome are such as will indure no longer delay
but unlesse you shall be graciously pleased to assure them by messengers that you will speedily apply your royall to the satisfaction of their former desires they shall be inforced for the safety of your maiesty and your kingdomes to dispose of the militia by the authority of both houses in such manner as hath been propounded to your maiestie and they resolve to doe it accordingly

and a little below they beseech his maiestie to be informed by them that by the lawes of the kingdome the power of raising ordering and disposing of the militia within any city towne or other place cannot be granted to any corporation by charter or otherwise without the authority and consent of

parliament and that those parts of the kingdome which have put themselves into a posture of defence against the common danger have therein done nothing but according to the declaration and direction of both houses and what is iustifiable by the lawes of the kingdome

and in their declaration of the
may
pag
they say wee must maintain the ground of our feares to be of that moment that we cannot discharge the trust and duty which lyes upon us unlesse we doe apply our selves to the use of those meanes to which the law hath inabled us in cases of this nature viz to settle the militia without and against his consent for the necessary defence of the kingdome and as his maiesty doth gratiously declare the law shall be the measure of his power so doe we most heartily professe that we shall alwayes make it the rule of our obedience
but say wee that you had not now forfeited all your credit by notoriously violating your never intended to be kept promises

and in their petition to the king about the businesse of hull pag

they say we shall be ready to settle the militia in such way as shall be honourable and safe for your maiestie most agreeable to the duty of parliament and effectuall for the good of the kingdome that the strength thereof be not imployed against it selfe
and we say we wish it may not to the setting up of a tyranny of another nature but worse then the former we groaned under
but we go on to their answer of the kings positions which answer is annexed to their great declaration of the
no
where in the third answer pag
they say that we did and doe say that a parliament may dispose of any thing wherein the king or any subiect hath a right in such way as that the kingdome may not be in danger thereby and that if the king being humbly sought unto by his parliament shall refuse to ioyne with them in such cases the representative body of the kingdome is not to sit still

and see the kingdome perish before their eyes and of this danger they are judges
here may be an excellent argument drawne from the greater to the lesse which will undeniably hold good against the arbitrary and illegall practises of the parliament which wee in our particulars groane under

now all these things considered we hope it iustly cannot be taken ill at our hands by the parliament nor by any rationall or understanding man in the kingdome though never so much deuoted unto implicite and blind presbyterian synodian obedience if we for our preservation shall tread in the parliament steps by appealing to the people against them as they did against the king especially considering they deale worse with us then ever he dealt with them for hee did not actually imprison their bodies and thereby rob them of their liberties trades lively hoods and subsistance and allow them nothing to live upon and expose their whole families to the eye of reason to an unavoydable famishing and perishing condition all and every of which contrary to the law of the land justice reason and conscience they have actually with a great deale of barbarous cruelty done to us
but before we doe solemnly seriously and actuall appeale to the people as of necessity if by them we cannot inioy iustice and right and the benefit of the knowne and unrepealed lawes of the land which is all we crave or desire we both must and will cost it hanging or burning or what ever it will we desire from their owne words to make our way plaine before hand and the more to leave them without excuse before god and all our fellow commons of england
seeing skin for skin and all that a man hath will he give for his life iob
and therefore in the first place we must professe in their owne words in their declaration to the states of holland pag that we have no other designe in the world but not to be destroyed and save our selves lawes liberties and freedomes and let not them say if we should formally appeale to the people that we malitiously indevour to dissolve the whole frame and constitution of the civill pollicy and government of this kingdome into the originall law of nature by arraigning and condemning before the people the high court of parliament from whence legally there can be no appeale we doe truly confesse and owne the honourable house of commons whose iust interest wee honour with all our hearts to be to us the legall supreame power in the kingdome from whom we conceive in law we have no higher appeale but if the house of commons will not doe us justice and right and so discharge their trust and duty but suffer the lords contrary to the law of the land which they have sworne to maintain to murther and destroy us our wives and children and by consequence the liberty of all the commons of england we cannot nor dare not for fear of being traitors and fellons to our selves sit still and willingly suffer our selves contrary to the good and just lawes and constitutions of the kingdome to be destroyed by the lords who in law have no more power to commit our bodies to prison being commoners then wee have to commit theirs
therefore it is not we but they themselves that dissolve the legall frame and constitution of the civill policy and government of the kingdome by suffering will and lust but not law to rule and governe us and so reduce us into the originall law of nature for every man to preserve and defend himselfe the best he can and therefore since it must be so for so it is we in their owne words pag
say in gods name let the people iudge every man within his owne breast whether they or we are most guilty of the foresaid charge

but we come to their owne words in their appealing to the people and craving their aid and assistance to helpe to preserve them against those that they say contrary to law would have destroyed them and we shall begin in the first place with the protestation which they made and tooke the
of may
and by an order of the
may
give their approbation to the taking it by any commoner of england in the preamble of which they spend much time to demonstrate that there have been and still is a strong indeavour by a malignant party to subvert the fundamentall lawes of england
and to introduce the exercise of an arbitrary and tyrannicall government and therefore they sweare and protest they will maintaine the lawfull rights and liberties of the subject and every person that maketh this protestation in what soever he shall doe in the lawfull persuance of the same and to my power and as far as lawfully may will oppose and by all good wayes and meanes indeavour to bring to condigne punishment all such whether lords or members of the house of commons without exception as shall either by force practise counsells plots conspiracies doe any thing to the contrary and by their vote of the iune
they say that what person soever will not take this protestation is unfit to beare office in the church or

now let us see what use they make of this protestation against the king and we shall find in the
part book decl pag

the vote of the house of commons in these words resolved upon the question

that this house doth declare that if any person whatsoever shall arrest or imprison the persons of the lords and gentlemen or any of them or any other of the members of either house of parliament that shall be imployed in the service of both houses of parliament or shall offer violence to them or any of them for doing any thing in pursuance of the commands or instructions of both houses shall be held disturbers of the proceedings of parliament and publique enemies of the state
and that all persons

are bound by their protestation to endeavour to bring them to condigne punishment
an order of the selfe same effect you may read pag
made by them
appill

and in their declaration of the
may pag
speaking of the kings proclaming sir iohn hotham a traytor without due processe of law they declare it not only a breach of the priviledge of parliament but a subvertion of the subjects common right yea and such a breach of the priviledge of parliament as that the very being thereof depends upon it and therefore say they we no wayes doubt but every one that hath taken the protestation will according to his solemn vow and oath defend it with his life and fortunes

and in their declaratioe of the
may
pag
speaking of the many difficulties that they are forced to incounter with in the discharge of their duty to the kingdome they say yet wee doubt not but we shall overcome all this at last if the people suffer not themselves to be deluded with false and specious shewes and so drawne to betray us to their owne undoing who have ever been willing to hazzard the undoing of our selves that they might not be betrayed by our neglect of the trust reposed in us

and in their smart declaration of the beginning of august pag
replying unto his majesties answers to their propositions they say

and having received so sharp a return such expressions of bitternesse a justification and a vowed protection of delinquents from the hand of iustice demands of so apparent danger such manifestations

of an intention to destroy us and with us the whole kingdome and this most cleerly evidenced by their subsiquent actions even since these propositions have been made unto us from his majestie severall countries compelling the trained bands by force to come in and joyne with them or disarming them and putting their armes into the hands of leud and desperate persons thereby turning the armes of the kingdome against it selfe it be not fit for us not only not to yeeld to what is required but also to make further provision for the preservation of our selves and of those who have sent us hither and intrusted us with all they have estates liberty and life and that which is the life of their lives their

religion and even for the safety of the kings person now invironed by those who carrie him upon his owne ruine and the destruction of all his people at least to give them warning that all this is in danger that if the king may force this parliament they may bid fare well to all parliaments from ever receiving good by them and if parliaments be lost they are lost their lawes are lost as well as those lately made as in former times all which will be cut in sunder with the same sword now drawne for the distruction of this parliament
then if they will not come to helpe the parliament and save themselves though both they and we must perish yet have we discharged our consciences and delivered our soules and will looke for a reward in heaven should we be so ill requited upon earth by those of whom we have so well deserved which we cannot feare having found upon all occasions such reall demonstrations of their love and affection and of their right understanding and apprehension of our and their common danger

and in their large declaration of the
novem

pag
speaking of his majesties charge in his declaration where he compaires them to the anabaptists mentioned in mr hookers book they say if ever god shall discover the foule authors of so false a calumny we doubt not but the kingdome that is the universallity of the people will be very sensible of it and esteeme that they can never doe themselves right

but by bringing to condigne punishment such persons as could find in their hearts to lay so vile an aspertion upon the parliament a name that alwayes hath and we hope alwayes shall bee of so great honour and reverence within this kingdome

and in the same declaration pag
answering his majesties charge fixed upon them of designing the ruine not only of his majesties person but of monarchy it selfe
and we appeale to all the world say they whether worse words then these can be given us and whether we may not justly expect the worst actions that the malice and power of the malignant party about his majesty can produce and whether it be not high time for us to stand upon our defence which nature teacheth

every man to provide for and this kingdome unlesse it be very unnaturall and unmindfull of it selfe cannot but afford to them whom it hath intrusted and by whom it is represented

now from all the forementioned authorities and arguments

of the parliaments owne declarations we draw these conclusions which naturally flow from them first that all majesteriall power in england whatever are but offices of trust and bound up with this limitation to be executed for the good of the trusters

secondly that it is posible that all or any of the severall majesteriall trustees may forfit their or its trust
thirdly that in case of the majesterycall trust the trusters the people are disobleged from their obedience and subjection and may lawfully doe the best they can for their owne preservation but if what hath beene said be not fully cleare out of all doubt to prove the foresaid deducions
we wil only ad two more proofs at present of there owne authoryties which will put them all out of dispute the first is out a late sheet of paper newly printed according to order of parliaments intitled king iames his opinion and iudgement concerning a real king and a tirant extracted out of his owne speech to the lords and commons in parliament at


a king saith king iames in a setled kingdome binds himselfe to a double oath to the observation of the fundamentall lawes of his kingdome tacitly as by being a king and so bound to perfect as well the people as the law of his kingdome and expresly by his oath at his coronation
so as every just king in a setled kingdom is bound to observe that paction or covenant made to his people by his lawes in framing his government agreeable thereunto according to that paction made with noah after the deluge gen
therefore a king governing in a setled kingdome leaves to be a king and degenerates into a tyrant as soone as he leaves of to rule according to his lawes therefore all kings that are not tyrants or perjured will be glad to bound themselves within the limits of their laws and they that perswade them the contrary are vipers pests both against them the common wealth thus far king iames out of which the author of that sheet drawes nine inferences or conclusions the fift of which is in these words
that a king governing in a setled kingdome as the kingdome of england is leaves to be a king so soone as he leaves of and failes to rule according to his lawes
and so leaving of to be a king the government on his part is infringed so as the people are no longer his subiects to obey him in his lawlesse government then be is their king governing them to his laws to the same effect is his sixt conclusion and in the last end of the seventh he hath these words
that if kings cease to be kings setting up an absolute tyranny over the people to govern them no longer by the lawes as free borne liege people but lawlesly as vassells and slaves then on the other side the people leaving to be subjects doe owe them no more obedience as being none of their kings but as usurping tyrants
for as a king turning tyrant practising tyranny under the name of prerogative hath broken the bonds of the kingdome so the subjects owe him no more duty of liege people except they will avow themselves his slaves and so betrayers of their own and the publique liberties which ought to be more precious unto them then their and ds again a so degenerating into a tyrant is by the verdict of iames departed a perjured man perjured men as they are odious to god so they bring an execration upon a land za
and if so then say we wo woe woe unto poore england by reason of the perjuries of the dissembling lords and commons at westminster that have laid aside the law and troden under their feet the liberties of england
and the unreverend dissembly of divines that rob iesus christ of his honour and glory by jusling him out of his regalliry and kingship given unto him by his father and yet take oathes themselves and force other men to doe so too to maintaine the lawe and liberties of the kingdome and to set up and ecclesiasticall church government according to the word of

god and yet set up nothing but a spirituall and temporall tyranny and with a high hand indeavour the destruction of every man that indeavours to keep them close to their violated oaths and covenants therefore whatsoever the author of the forementioned discourse avers of a king when he seekes to governe according to his lawes the same doe we aver of a parliament and that when they cease to execute the end of their trust which is as themselves say to provide for the peoples weales but not for their woes and doe meerly indeavour to make themselves tyrants over the people to governe them not by the established lawes but by their lusts and wills they doe thereby make the people their vassels and slaves as much as in them lyes and thereby disobleidge the people to obey stoop or submit to any of their commands but in the eye of god and all rationall men may as justly resist and withstand them and by force of armes defend themselves against them as a company of forsworne men that have forfeited their majesteriall trusts and are degenerated into the habits of tyrants as they withstood and by force of armes defended themselves against the king for the further proofe of which in the second place read their owne words
par dec pag
which thus followes

for it cannot be supposed that the parliament would ever by law intrust the king with the militia against themselves or the common wealth that intrusts them to provide for their weale not for their woe
so that when there is certain appearance or grounded suspition that the letter of the law shall be improved against the equity of it that is the publique good whether of the body reall or representative then the commander going against its equity gives liberty to the commanded to refuse obedience to the letter for the law taken a stract from its originall reason and end is made a shell without a kernell a shadow without a substance and a body without a soule
it is the execution of lawes according to their equity and reason which as may say is the spirit that gives life to authority the letter kills nor this equity be expressed in the law being so naturally implyed and supposed in all lawes that are not meerly imperiall from that anologie which all bodies politick hold with the naturall whence all government and governours borrow a proportionable respect and therefore when the militia of an army is committed to the generall it is not with an expresse condition that he shall not turne the mouthes of his cannons against his own soldiers for that is so naturally and necessarily implyed that it is needlesse to be expressed in so much as if he did attempt or command such a thing against the nature of his trust and place it did ipso facto estate the army in a right of disobedience except we thinke that obedience binds men to cut their owne throat or at least their companions

we shall at present leave the application to them whom it most concernes and wait as patiently as we can to see the operation of it which if it be not according to our expectation we shall be necessicated to put some stronger pills into the next and so at present conclude and rest

from our prerogative captivity for the lawes and the publique liberties of all the commons of england against the tyranny and usurpation of the house of peers in the prisons of the tower of london and newgate this last of februa

the publisher to the reader
curteous reader having here some spare roome judge it convenient to fill it up with a notable petition delivered to the house of commons the
of march
by young men whose zeale and forwardnesse for their countrys good may be a shame to all the old men in the city the petition it selfe thus followeth

to the high and honourable the knights citizens and burgesses in the supreame court of parliament assembled
the petition of divers young men and apprentices of the city of london humbly

sheweth

that out of the grounded confidence we have of the readinesse of this honourable house to heare and repaire the grievances of all those for whose well fare you were chosen and betrusted to take care and provide and being incouraged unto the same by severall good ordinances and declaration of your own to that purpose

we whose names are hereunto annexed although the meanest members of this great yet having by birth a right of subsistance here conceive our selves in our proportion to have as reall an interest in the kingdomes inioyments as those who in respect of place or other accidents are above us as also many of us having under the direction of your honourable grave counsell and guidance freely adventured our lives for the preservation of our native rights and the just priviledges of our deare country against the publique violaters of the same upon these and other serious grounds we are bold at this time to make our humble addresses to this honourable and supream court of iudicature the only refuge under god we have to fly to and in the first place we cannot but with all thankefullnesse take notice of the unwearied paines together with many great and almost intolerable difficulties by you undergone in the faithfull discharge of your trust in bringing about the establishment of a well grounded peace
the perfection of which in relation to the common enemie seems now by the blessing of god to bee brought neare to a wished period yet the consummation of this work being as it were the crowne of all our labours we humble conceive it may deservedly challenge from you a more then ordinary respect which we doubt not but that your grave wisedoms are very sencible of yet noble senators let it seem no presumption if we your poor petitioners in al humility make known the grounds of some feares and jealousies to us apparent in this particular
and those are amongst other great grievances chiefly derived from the present sense we have of the too much prevalency of that party who have dealt in the late wars declared themselves disaffected to the peace and of the kingdom who now seem to be in hopes of obtaining that by policie which they have not been able to doe by force
cunningly contriving to aggravate and encrease differences between the party and striving to bring an odium upon all good men under the distinction of severall tearmes of obloquie and disgrace by such subtle endeavours labouring to avert the edge of justice from themselves who come deservedly under the stroake of it and turne it upon those who are most innocent
strongly endeavouring and have already affected it in part to justle all honest faithfull well affected men out of places of trust office and authority and to put in newters ambodexters or persons apparently disaffected by all these meanes together with the advantage of the kingdomes present unsetlednesse they seem to be in a more then probable expectation of getting the reines once more into their owne hands to the evident indangering of the speedy ruine and to the great griefe of your poore petitioners and all others who cordially desire the peace and safety of this destracted kingdome
and further we

are bold to make known as more particularly relating to the condition of your petitioners that whereas we at our being made free of the city are injoyned by oath to maintaine the libertyes and priviledges of the same city which notwithstanding we are in a great measure disabled to doe by the intercession of divers illegall and undue customes and monopolies partly about the election and removall of our magistrates crept into the dimunition of the antient liberties of this famous city

whose just we are confident your honours have been and are very tender of

wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that this honourable house taking into consideration the premises would be pleased by your mature prudence and care to endeavour as much as possibly you can to take away all occasions of breaches between the well affected party
and that such as have in these late times of trouble by adventuring their lives or otherwise approved themselves faithfull to their countrys common good may without respect to differences no wayes prejudiciall to the common wealth impartially enjoy their priviledges and be equally capable with others of the freedome to officiate in place of trust which they are or shall be chosen unto
and on the contrary that all those who haue dis franchised themselves by traterously adhering to the enemy may be disabled from bearing office or voting in the election of offices in the
and we further crave with submission to your honours grave approvements that in regard of the kingdomes present unsetlednesse it may not be left destitute of a trusty and sufficient guard to secure it from intestine broyles and forraigne
and as for your petitioners more particular grievances as they are members of this city we humbly pray that you would be pleased by your authority so to provide that we as we are or shall be capable of it may be inabled to injoy the benefit of all ancient charters and grants made and confirmed by severall acts of parliament for the enlargement of our freedomes and priviledges

and that whatsoever hath been illegally intended may be taken away and made voide
and lastly as some have desired we likewise pray that if so small a thing may be worthy the intention of this grave and honourable assembly you would be pleased to appoint some times of lawfull recreation for servants as your wisedomes shall thinke fit

and your petitioners as they have many of them already according to their duty freely adventured their liues and whatsoever was deare to them for the common safety of their countr so they still professe their readinesse to give their best assistance to the suppressing all arbitrary and tyrannicall power and to the upholding the fundamentall rights and libertyes of english men and the just priviledges of this honourable house against all that shall set themselves in opposition of the same

and be ever bound to pray postscript starts here whatsoever is contained in the petition the subscribers will be ready to make good by particular instances when they shall be lawfully called to the same

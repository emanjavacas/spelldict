Wherein is plainly proued by the order of time and place, that Peter was neuer at Rome.
Furthermore, that neither Peter nor the Pope is the head of Christes Church.
Also an interpretation vpon the second Epistle of S. Paul to the Thessalonians, the second Chapter.
¶To the right honorable Sir Henry Sidney, Knight of the honorable order of the Garter, Lord President of the Marches of VVales, and Lord deputie of Ireland.
HE dishonesteth himself, and so much as lyeth in hym diffameth his maister, vvho hath bin prentise seuen yeares, and at the ende of those seuen yeares, neyther vnderstandeth his arte, neyther can shewe any reason therof, neyther is able to profite himselfe or others.
Are not we al bound, yea do we not al promise in our baptisme, and are commaunded of God, to shew out the glories and vertues of him, that hath brought vs out of darkenes into light? But it is to be feared that a nomber of vs that professe Christ, (thoughe wee haue bin prentice to him seuen yeares, perhappes seuen, seuen, and seuen, neither haue so much knowledge as to instruct our selues, neither to defend our maister Christ against the Turke, Iewe, heretique, and antichrist.
VVill the Turke admit any man to his religion, that neither can, nor will defend Mahomet? VVill the Iewe receiue any that is not furnished with the Scriptures falsely interpreted against Christ? VVill Heretiques accept any man that is ignorant in their erronius opinions? VVill Antichrist allowe any man which will not maintaine his Idolatry and VVe professe Christ in woords, and outward shewes, notwithstanding we are not able too defend him in the middest of his enemyes.
Ignorance is the root of errour: the contempt of the study of Gods word, is the high way to perdition.
VVho can please him whose will he knoweth not? VVho can proceede in his Princes affaires, that knoweth not his comission? How can he execute his commission, if he neyther reade it, nor vnderstand it? Is he a Gramarian that cannot speake congrue Latine? Logician that cannot reason probably? naturall Philosopher that knoweth not the generation and causes of Raine, VVinde, Snowe, and such Meteorologicall things? Is there any Surgen that hath not read Iohannes de Vigo or Alexander benedictus? Or Phisitian that is ignorant in Hippocrates, or Galen, or Celsus? and shall ignorance who is condemned of all artificers commend a Christian? therfore the least of all the members of Christ, hearing dayly Antichrist and his artificers (I meane the Pope and the Papistes) so cunning in the Cannon lawe, and Popish doctours, that there is nothing in them that they do not both exactely vnderstand, and also vtter, to the maintenance of their head the Pope, thought it necessary somewhat to say and too refel theyr errours.
Emong the which this is not the least that the Papistes go about, to proue the Pope to be head of the Church, which vnreasonable errour, being plainely in these twoo little treatises confuted, haue thought good to dedicate the same vnto your Honour, whose desire (as am throughly perswaded) is too see the vtter confusion of Antichrist, and the perfect establishement of Christes Religion.
And therfore the bolder to set those things forth vnder your Lord shippes protection, which may please Christ, displease Antichrist, be acceptable to all Christians, greuous to all Antechristians, pleasant to all professoures of Christ, bitter to al his aduersaries.
And as truste a plaine ouerthrowe of the Romishe Church.
THough Poets pen hath fables feignd Of monsters maruelous: Who diffring far from common kind were thought prodigious.
As Briarchus who had hands an hundreth as they tell, And spitte forth fire from fiftie mouthes like flashing flames of hell: Though Ephialtes with Othus of natures fierce and fell, Did striue with stregth of stretcht out arme in Ioue his Throne to dwell.
Who heaped hilles on mountains high on Pindus back, And placed Pelion on them the Starry skie to sack.
Though these two impes of ougly shape whose father Neptune was, Growing nine inches euery month, in bignesse mounts did passe.
Though Poliphemus were as huge and ougly as the rest, Who for his strength and sturdines might match him with the best.
And though Chimera a monster were, of thrée conioynd in one: The first a Lion, next a Goate, and third a fierce dragon.
Though Minotaurus were as hugh and monstrous in effect, Whose sundry shape with nature fell his Parents did detect.
Though Cerberus that chorlish Cur and thrée hell headded hound, monster rare, with other more which are in writers found: Though these say, vnséemely shapes foule fashioned, out of frame, Dame nature made thus monsterous as wée haue learned by fame.
Yit can shewe more monsterousnes comprised here in one, Who for his huge prodigiousenesse may match them all alone.
But this is neyther God nor man as he himself doth tell, He is a meane betwene them both yet rules both Heauen and Hell.
In Purgatory puttes to paine in earth he beares great swaie, The Heauenly Angels at his call are ready to obey.
Hée can forgiue mens sinnes on earth and scite hell houndes by poste, And he can lose from lothesome lakes damnd soules and griesly ghostes.
He is a God the Papistes do affirme with wonders mo, Whose bestely body being blasd, iudge you if he be so.
His head a harmefull helmet is of poisen pestilent, His eyes are like to flames of fire that are from Vulcane sent.
His eares they trust al tryfling tales and credit blasing brute.
And such againe as will not heare the iust and humble sute.
His nose doth snuf foorth hellish fumes his tung is stinge of Death, His face of mischéef mirrour is and poisoned is his breath.
His téeth do gnawe the blessed bones of such as are elect, His mouth doth bable blasphemie and Gods word doth reiect.
His throte an open sepulchre doth swallow euery houre, The silly shéepo and woolfes doth spare the lambes for to deuour.
Hys brest a chest and cofer is of al iniquitie, His armes are strong Princes to strike if they not Christ deny.
His filthy fingers nimble are, to scratch for nedlesse gaine Which wilbe sure to snatch a share though other take the paine.
His legges are swift to shed the blood of Innocentes giltlesse, His féete are ready Emperours neckes to tread down and oppresse.
His body is Pandoras boxe which plageth younge and olde, And he prodigeous Antichrist whose déedes of Iohn are told.
Which beast although that he be strong yet standes on slppery ground, Foq him this booke doth flatly foile and vtterly confound.
FIrst proue by Scripture that Peter could not be at Rome vntill the
Secondly proue by the order of time and place that he could not be at Rome vntill the second yeare of Domitian which was after the passion of Christ
yeares which should haue bin after the destruction of Hierusalem which was after Christ
In the second discourse proue that neither Peter nor the Pope, is the head of the Church, confuting such obiections as they alledge to the contrary, wherein yee shall finde their arguments refelled, their Cannon law confuted, the Popes errours in Doctrine detected, their sillogismes answered, and finally certain antitheses betweene Christ and the Pope prouing him Antichrist, with an interpretation vppon the place of Paule.
THE FIRST DISCOVRS, wherein is proued that Peter was neuer at Rome.
PETER before Christes passion and deathe did not depart out of Iewrie, but was eyther with Christe, or with other of the Apostles, or elles labored in his vocation, for he was a fisher+man, as is proued by the Gospell of S. Mathew, Cap.
THE first yeare after the death and resurrection of Christ he was with the rest of the Apostles on the mounte Olyuet, beholding the Ascension of Christe, and then returned to Hierusalem, lokinge for the descending of the Holy Ghost, and there with the rest did chose Mathias in the place of Iudas, and made an eloquent oration, Acte.
And he taryed at Hierusalem, and cured a lame man, and in the Temple made an excellent Oration.
Then was he with the rest of the Apostles layde in prison, and the next daye let out, and examyned by what power they had cured the lame man, vntoo whom Peter answered effectually, neyther went hee out of Iudea that first yeare after Christes Ascension, as apereth manifestlie.
From Hierusalem the Apostles sent Peter and Iohn to Samaria, where Philippe the Deacon had layde the foundacion of Christes Religion, and had conuerted the Samaritaines.
Peter and Iohn obteyned by prayer, that they might receyue the Holy Ghost.
Peter and Iohn after they had preached in Samaria, returned to Hierusalem, and there hée remayned vntill the seconde yeare after Christes Ascension: in the which yeare Paule was conuerted to the fayth, as hée went to Damascus where he preached immediatly.
And in Arabia where hée preached thrée yeares, and then returned to Hierusalem, where Peter was with the reste of the Apostles: Reade diligently the first chapter to the Galathians, Uers.
vers. of the first chapter to the Galathians, yée shall vnderstande, that after Paule had spent thrée yeares in preachinge in Arabia and at Damascus which is a Cittie of Syria neare vnto Arabia hée went (being let downe by the wall in a basket) from Damascus to Hierusalem, where hée dyd fynde Peter and Iames with other Disciples.
Neyther was Peter at any tyme hithertoo out of Iurie.
In Iurie hée went about and came to Lydda, a Towne of Iurie, where hée cured Aeneas who had ben sicke of the pallesy eight yeares: and at porte Iaphe in Iurie hée Tabitha to lyfe.
From porte Iaphe Peter was sent for to Cornelius, who was a Centurian at Cesarea a Cittie of Iurie also.
Peter, when hée had instructed and baptized Cornelius and his howseholde, returned to Hierusalem, where the circumcysed reproued him for vttering the Gospell to the Gentyles, who hée pacifyeth and persuadeth by his  Oration.
This was the sixte yeare after Christes passion, and the fifte yeare after Paules conuersion.
All that time that Paule was out of Hierusalem in a Cittie of Lycia from whence Barnabas fetched him to Antioche a Cittie of Syria was Peter at Hierusalem, and from thence went to the same citie of Antioche where Paule reproued him, because that hée withdrewe himselfe from the Gentyles, with whome hee did eate, before that Iames came in with certeyne that were circumcised, whom Peter feared to offend.
And this was seue~ yeares from the conuersion of Paule.
And the eight, from Christes passion, which is not onely proued by order of tyme, but also it is noted Galat.
All that tyme that Paule and Barnabas were with the Gentyles, Peter remayned at Hierusalem till their returne, sauinge that hée conueyed himself at that Easter whe~ Herode Agrippa was there, for Herod Agrippa came fro~ Cesarea to Hierusale~ the feast of Easter, what time he beheaded Iames, layd Peter in prison as is euide~t in ye
And this was the twelueth yeare from Christ his passion, and the eleuenth from the conuersion of Paule.
Peter fearing the tyrannie of Herode Agrippa, after that the Aungell had delyuered him out of prison, conueyed himselfe out of the waye, and as the texte sayeth, into an other place, vntill Herode Agrippa should departe from Hierusalem, which was immediatly after Easter, purposing in his mind to make warre with the Tyrians, Sydonians or as Luke vttereth more effectually tynomachem
And as God would, the sayde Herode Agrippa, a great defendour of the Iewes Lawes and Ordinances, and a persecutour of Christians, dyed miserably the
yeare after Christes passion, which was the thirde yeare of the Emperour Claudius: for Agrippa the same yeare of Claudius was strieke~ with ye Angel, eate~ with woormes, dyed miserably.
Thus may you sée euide~tly Peter went notout of Iurie vntill ye iiij. yeare of Claudius nor the neyther vntil the death of Claudius as shall proue a litle after.
Now you maye sée, Peter was at Hierusalem in Iurie the first, ij. iij. yeare of Claudius as is euidently proued by Luke in the Actes of the Apostles.
Nowe let vs consider what place this was, that Luke sayeth that Peter himselfe too, lesse that they should saye, that hée conueyed himselfe to Rome.
Surely, hée hidde him selfe secretely in some place of Iudea vntill that Herode Agrippa should returne to Cesarea where he purposed to haue prepared an armie ageinst the Tyrians and Sydonians.
Wherefore Herode Agrippa returned after Easter to Cesarea where he died miserably.
After the death of Herode, Peter was out of daunger, for Iudea was ruled by the Lieuetenantes of the Romaynes, as Festus, Lysias, and Felix, which did rather presse the Iewes, than the Christians, as the historie of Iosephus declareth, wherefore those seuen yeares that Paule and Bernabas departed from Antioche of Syria vnto the Gentyles, Peter was in Iudea yea hée was at Hierusalem the
of Paule his conuersion, as is manifest,  for there maketh Peter an Oration to the brethren, and this was the sixte yeare of Claudius as is proued by the historie of the Actes written by S. Luke.
What authoritie haue the Papistes, which affirme and sweare, that Peter went to Rome the second yeare of Claudius? But let vs procéede in the historie: of their errours in this matter, will discourse a little after.
Peter was appointed at that same tyme a teacher of the Iewes, and Paule of the Gentyles.
For, sayeth Paule, Barnabas and I, were charged to preache to the Gentyles, and Peter, Iames and Iohn, to the Iewes.
Were not the Romaynes Gentyles? Was not Paule and Barnabas charged with them? Notwithstanding, after that Peter and Iohn had sufficiently instructed the Iewes, they also taught the Gentyles.
Wherefore vnto the sixt yeare of Claudius which was the
from Paules conuersion, Peter neuer departed out of Iury sauing only to Antioche of Syria as haue noted before.
Nowe will declare the reste of Peters peregrination, partly by suche testimonies as cannot bée refelled, partely by probable argumentes, necessarie coniectures, and sufficient reasons: As Peter did write to the dispersed Brethren in Pontus, Galatia, Bithinia, Capadocia and Asia so did hée preache in them all.
Nicephorus writeth, that Peter preached in Palestina, Syria, Phenice, Pontus Galatia, Capadocia, Bithinia and to bée bréefe, in all the quarters of Asia and Europe.
of the Actes, hée went out of Iury into Pontus Galatia, Capadocia, Asia and Bithinia: Them hée instructed, them hée visited, them hée furnished with the Gospell, them hée exhorted to faith, to good woorkes, to obedience, to temperancie, to doo their deuties, with them hée taried and was conuersant so longe, vntill that they had layde a foundacion, buylded substantially vpon it.
What a long tyme hée taryed in Pontus and what Cities and Townes hée did instructe, and brought from superstition to Religion, from idolatrie to the Truthe, from errour too the right waye, from crueltie too lenitie, and from all iniquitie, to all patience, iustice, and humanitie: Hée maye easely coniecture who readeth and knoweth the descriptions of Countries.
What a number of goodly Cities farre distant one from an other were in Pontus? howe many in Bithinia? In them stoode Chalcedon, Nicomedia, Apamia, Heraclea, and the great cittie Nicea where that famous councell was holden, called The of Nice.
What shall speake of Asia? in it standeth Troia, Assum, Autandros, Addramitium, Ephesus where Dianas Temple was had in suche honour: Arogilium· Milet, Guidus, Troas with many other mencioned in the Actes of the Apostles: Who dooth not knowe but that Galatia is as great as any of the others.
Unto this S. Paule did write in his epistle to the Galathians, in this Countrie stoode Antioche of Pisidia where Paule made an eloquent Oration.
Some parte of Galatia differeth in longitude from other some of it twoo or thrée degrees, in latitude fiue or sixe.
And Ephesus which standeth in Ionia a Region of litle Asia differeth from Antioche of Pisidia which is in Galatia in longitude seuen degrées, in latitude twoo.
And there is no lesse distance in the Cities of Capadocia: Wherefore to passe ouer and through them, leauing any monumentes and foundacions of Religion, hée must néedes haue taried there a long tyme.
Consider the long iorney, the vntowardnesse of the people: the hard harted paynime Priests, olde rooted superstitions, their Forefathers customes, and yée shall and maye bée easely persuaded, that hée must néedes continewe in these Countries, a very longe tyme.
Thus writeth Mantuan: The Cities of Assyria Peter conuerted to the fayth.
And after this did passe the sea Capadoces, Bithine, Pontus, Galace, and lesser Asia, Preaching the Gospell gracious.
Let it bée that hée was not aboue seuen or eight yeares in all these countries, notwithstanding wée must bringe the historie to the
of the conuersion of S. Paule: and this was the
Wherefore, by this description, and order of tyme and place· neyther could hée bée at Rome the second yeare of Claudius neyther in his time.
And if Peter should haue ben put to death at Rome the
of Nero as the papistes affirme, then could not hée haue ben Pope at Rome yeares and monethes, but onely
But now will procéede and declare that hée could not bée at Rome none of these yeares of Nero whiche when haue what can the Romishe Catholiques, or the Romish church haue wherewith to proue their Romishe Peter.
After Peter had watered the drye barren countries of Capadocia, and Asia with the streames of the Gospell, hée departed from thence into there to doo the like· for hée was at Alexandria as Nicephorus reporteth, there ordeyned S. Marke bishop, or rather an and Teacher to the
And this agreeth with Dorotheus in the lyfe of S. Marke, who off riueth that hée was cast downe vpon the grounde by the and trailed by a rope put about his necke from a streat of Alexandria called the hogge heard, vnto the places called aggelon of Aungelles or messengers.
When Peter had visited this Alexandria in Egypt whose longitude is
and had planted the Gospell, hée went to Babylon a citie in Egypt also, where the longitude is
and latitude from whence hée wrote his first Epistle by Syluanus· declaring that the same doctrine and grace, which they in, and hée preached vnto them, was true, infallible, and immortall.
True ageynst the enemie, infallible to their expectation, immortall in contineuance, comfortable for the Soule, necessary to saluation.
And this Babylon is meaned to that famous Citie of Egypt nowe called in the Hebrewe tounge Crum where the Sultane lieth: the circuite about is
From this Peter wrote this firste Epistle, whiche is manifest by the
verse of the fifth chapter, where hee sayeth, that the Churche of Babylon dyd salute them, and his sonne Marke, who as Dorothe writeth, was burned at· Alexandria in Egypt Now muste yée that iourney, from Pontus, Cappadocia, Asia, Bithinia and Galatia to Alexandria and Babylon in Egypt was very long, for they differ in latitude
degrées, and therefore the tyme must bée prescribed in suche sorte, as hée might not only taste of Nilus (as the prouerbe is) but also the ignoraunte, instructe the simple, persuade the stubbeo, good doctrine and manners, deteste and banishe superstition and Idolatrie· (as you may reade euery where) they woorshipped Cattes, Crocodilles, Dogges, and such other beastes, and were giuen ouer to Magicke, and all other iniquities· This required a longe tyme, an whole body, a carefull singuler diligence, will, and a continewall
knowe some call thys Babylon, Rome, by an Allegorie: and other some, Babylon of Chalde, but their proofe is easely reproued, their vncertaine, their opinion wauering, and their iudgement without reason or authoritie.
For all others write of Markes béeing at Egypt, and at Alexandria, and there to haue preached that some Gospell, which hée hath committed to writing.
And for the familiaritie that was betwéene Peter and Marke, Peter calleth him his sonne.
And in déed, hée was his Sisters sonne adelphidous But what néedeth vs any more proofe of Peters being in Egypt, when as Peters woordes proue it.
If Marke suffered his the eight yeare of Nero his raigne, as Hierome writeth in Catalogo.
And notwithstanding was at Rome the second or third yeare of the sayd Nero, as is manifeste.
For that yeare Paule wrote the Epistle too the Collossians from Rome.
Than of necessitie Peter must haue ben in Egypt before the eight yeare of Nero his raigne, because that Peter béeing in Egypt sayeth, that Marke dooth salute the dispersed· Brethren of Asia
If before the eight yeare, Ergo hée must néedes haue ben in Egypt some parte of Nero if some parte, then was not hée at Rome all the tyme of Nero, if hée was not at Rome vnto the
yeares before: than quaileth the opinion of the papistes, that saye, that hée was Pope at Rome twentie fiue yeares
For Peter must néedes haue bene in Egypt before the death of Marke, for if Marke had ben dead, Peter would not haue said that Marke had saluted the dispersed brethren.
But that this matter maye bée playnly perceyued, and the inconstancie of Romishe Registers detected, their fraude espyed, and their errours Consider, that Peter was the third yeare of cast in prison by Herode the ninth yeare after Christes passion, and the eight yeare of Paules conuersion, wherfore Peter fearing the tyrannie of Herode, as sayd before, conueyed himself out of the presence of Herode.
And all the whyle that Paule and Barnabas preached to the Gentiles, Peter remayned in Iudea, which was about seuen yeres.
And thus are wee comme to the sixthe yere of Claudius, the sixtenth afer Christes passion, and the fiftenth of Paules conuersion.
After this Councell (how long can not certenlye coniecture) hée tooke his iourney into Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Bithynia Asia where hée taried seuen or eyght yeares and more, as haue specified before.
Others apointe but fyue yeares, put to seuen yeares, in which they saye hée was at Antioche.
By this order of tyme wée haue brought it too passe euen according too the prescription of the Papistes, and after suche an infallible supputation, that it can not bée denyed, vnto the sixth yere of Nero, which was the .xxx. yere after Christes passion, and .xxix. after the conuersion of sainct Paul.
In so much that hée could neyther bee .xxv. yeres at Rome, neyther seuen moonthes, neyther seuen dayes, neyther one yeare of Nero.
If any man can refelle any parte of this discourse, wée will geue him thankes, partelie for that hée shall delyuer vs out of errour, and also for that hée shall set foorthe the truthe.
If Peter lyued after the death of Nero as this Historye declareth, howe coulde hée bée put too deathe by Nero haue proued before, that hée was at Babylon in Egypte, which is distant from Rome ten or eleuen degrées in latitude, and in longitude .xxx. which must néedes bée a longe and tedious iourney.
It apereth that Peter was at Corinthe also: for it is written, that some holde of Paule, some of Apollo, and other some of Cephas which was Peter.
If the Corinthians had neuer séene Peter, neuer herd of him, neuer had ben conuersaunte with him, why woold they haue holden of him? It may bée that hée went to Corinth when hée was in lesser Asia, which differeth not from Corinth aboue six or seuen degrées in latitude, and as much in a manner in longitude.
If hée suffred not deathe at Roome, where died hée? It appereth that hée died at Hierusalem bycause that hée was appointed a teacher of the Iewes.
For Christe saieth, that sent too the Hierosolymitanes Prophets, wyse men, and learned men, and hée prophicied, that somme of them they shoulde kill and crucefye: by these hee meaneth the Apostles and other teachers.
Which of all the Apostles was crucefied at Hierusalem? But somme must needes bée crucefyed there, or els Christes woordes should seeme not too bée true.
Wherfore Lyra with the interlyned Glose vppon this place affirme, that Peter wes crucefyed at Hierusalem by the Iewes.
Thus mutch as concerning the historie, lyfe, peregrination, and death of Peter.
Those presumptuous and legend lyes, with Festiuall fables, whiche they aduouch, are dissonant, contrary, and varyable among them selues.
Somme saye as Eusebius, that Peter came too Roome the secound yere of Claudius somme the thirde, somme the fourth, as Damasus: when as all this tyme hée was noot out of Iury.
Where is truthe if concorde bee absent? Consider their discorde: Eusebius sayeth, that Peter raigned at Roome .xxv. yeares, Hierom. xxvii.
Damasus affirmeth that hee came too Roome in the tyme of Nero which was the fourtenth yeare of his Raigne, and notwithstanding was at Roome whole .xxv. yeres, twoo monethes, and seuen dayes.
Howe is it possible that Peter came too Roome in the tyme of Nero and suffred in the last yere of Nero and yet taried there xxv. yeres, and all in the tyme of Nero who reigned but .xiiii. yeres.
Can you make .xxv. of xiiii. or xiiii. too bee .xxv? Buechingerus sayeth, that Peter was at Roome .xxv. yeres, seuen monethes, and eight dayes.
Somme saye, that Peter suffered at Roome the .xxxiii. yeare after the death of Christe, somme the .xxxviii. yeare.
Nicephorus sayeth, that Peter was the first Bishop of Roome, Clement in the first booke Recognit. sayeth, that Barnabas was the first that was at Roome, and the firste that planted any Churche there: Hierom sayeth, that Peter was Bishope in the East fiue yeares, Beda seuen yeares.
Nicephorus sayeth, that Peter went from Antioche too Roome, and from Roome too Antioche, and agein from Antioche too Roome, where hee suffered.
Quo nodo mutantem Prothea vultus? Omnia transformat sese in miracula rerum.
Ireneus and Dorotheus saye, that Marke was alyue after the deathe of Peter and Paule: other saye, that hee suffered the eight yeare of Nero
As they doo disagree in Peter, so doo they in the rest of the first Popes.
And thinke yee not that they disagrace Peter, in making him of an Apostle a Bishope, of a Disciple of Christ a Pope of Rome But too our purpose, somme saye that Peter made Linus, Cletus and Anacletus Bishoppes of Rome
Somme saye, that they were his fellowes cohelpers: their foundacions are weake, they leane too a broken staffe.
Somme saye, that Clement succeded Peter with Linus and Cletus as cohelpers: which as the sayd Scotus writeth in Anacletus lyfe, denieth that they were eyther Bishops or Popes.
There is no mention of Cletus in any good Author, neyther can it bée proued sufficiently, whether euer there were any suche, or no.
Somme saye, that hée was Pope twelue yeares, other somme, seuen.
The olde writers place Anacletus immediatlye after Clement eyther despising Cletus or els forgetting him, or els being ignorant of any such, omit him.
cease too nomber all the discordes, for Roome it self woolde scarse holde them all.
Nowe, as wée haue proued by the truthe of the history, that Peter was neyther at Roome. xxv. yeres, neyther dyed there: So let vs proue the same by probable argumentes, that they maye perceiue their Churche too bée buylded vppon the sande.
If Peter had ben at Roome, Luke woolde haue specified it, who describeth the Apostles Actes diligently and exquisitely.
It is euident both by Suetonius Tranquillus and others, and also by S. Luke, that Claudius the Emperour did charge all the Iewes as they loued their lyues, too departe out of Roome: if Peter had bin there than, which was the tenth yeare of Claudius and the .xx. after Christes passion, and the .xix. of Paules conuersion, without doubte somme mention woolde haue ben made of his tarying there or of his departure.
Paule saluteth Aquila Priscilla by name, who were at Roome before the commaundment of the Emperour, why did hée not aswell salute Peter, with whome hée taryed .xv. dayes at Hierusalem? If Peter had ben there, had herd the proclamation of Claudius which hée must néeds haue heard, if hée had ben there, hée woulde haue shaken the dust of his féete, following the precept of Christ.
And neyther could hée haue taried at Roome, neyther hée woolde: hée could not bycause of Tyranny, woolde not because the citie was not woorthie of such a message as hée brought with him.
How can they now saye, that hée taried there .xxv. yeres vii. monethes, vii. dayes? But why did they not make Paule the first Pope, séeinge that hée was not only appointed too bée a teacher too the Gentiles, but also Luke affirmeth, that hée was at Roome: and Eusebius maketh him the first Bishop of Rome? They woold rather haue made Paule an Heretique, if they had could, because that hée inueyeth so much ageinst the Antechrist of Roome.
There was one brought before a Iustice of the West countrie for religio~, who aunswereth, béeing demaunded of a matter of religion, that Paule sayeth so: Paule? sayeth hée, if Paule were here hée should go the same waye that thou shalt go, ye were both worthie to bée burned, wolde cary a fagotte to burne you both.
Paule béeing at Rome in the tyme of Nero wrote to the Colossians, saying that Epaphras, Luke, Demas saluted them.
Was Peter inferiour to them? was hée not worthie to bée named? were his salutacions to bée despysed? wherfore if hée had ben at Roome, hée woolde haue made mention of Peter, béeing head of the Apostles.
And to Timothe hée writeth, that Demas was reuolted, Crescens was gone into Fraunce, Titus into Dalmatia desiring him to bring Marke with him, bycause only Luke was with him.
If Luke was there only, surely Peter was not there.
And Paule writing to Philemo~ sayeth, that Epaphras his felowe prysoner, Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, his cohelpers, saluted him.
If Peter had ben there béeing an earnest professor of Christ, should not hée haue be~ apprehended as sone as Epaphras? should not hée haue ben as good a helper as Demas? as as Luke? was hée not woorthie of naming? Hithertoo haue obserued as appereth by the texte, too proue euery thing by order of tyme and place, and also by other circumstances: now thinke it good also to recite the order that Hierom other old writers obserue in this matter, who gather their historie out of Luke and Paule, as wée do: which order though it be not so probable to somme, notwithstanding it maketh better for our purpose.
For after the order which haue described hitherto, Peter was at Hierusalem the sixt yeare of Claudius the Emperoure, the .xvi. yeare of Christes passion, the .xv. yeare of the conuersion of sainct Paule.
But Hierom and others will haue the Councell, which was holden at Hierusalem in the .xv. of the Actes, to haue be~ the .xvii. yeare of Paules conuersion, and in the eightenth yeare from Christes passion, in the eight yeare of Claudius
And they are persuaded by the first chapter to the Galatians vers. xviii. by the second chapter vers. j. where Paule expressely maketh mention of .iij. yeares spent at Damascus and in Arabia, and after those .iii. yeares too haue comme too Hierusalem too the Councell, the .viii. yeare of Claudius
With what countenance than can the Roomish catholiques saye, that hée went to Rome the second yeare of the Emperour Claudius If wée interprete the places of the first and second chapter too the Galatians as Charles Molyneus, an Aduocate of the highe Senate Parliament of Paris, dothe, than must wée saye, that Paule continued at Damascus, in Arabia, and his retourne to Damascus, full fyue yeares: than .xiiii. yeare after both Paule Peter too haue ben at the Councell.
Than must wée that Peter was at Hierusalem the .x. or .xi. yeare of Claudius which was the .xix. or .xx. yeare after Christes passion.
And in the .xvii. or .xix. yeare of Paules conuersion, which was ye .xi. yeare of Claudius Peter departed to Antioche where hée was the~ reprehended of Paule.
Then both by Molyneus supputation, and by the other, which wée haue recited before, Peter coulde not comme too Roome the second yeare of Claudius
And therfore whatsoeuer the Papistes buylde of Peter *, it is soone shaken downe, as grounded vpon the sandes.
If Peter continued full seue~ yeares at Antioche in Syria as the Papistes affirme, then coulde not hée haue ben at Roome vntill the .iiii. yeare of ye Emperour Nero which was .xxvii. yeares after Christes passion.
By this discourse hée could not haue ben Pope at Roome .xxv. yeares, as the Papistes dreame, vnlesse that hé had lyued after Nero after Galba after Otho after Vitellius, Vespasianus and Titus vnto the tyme of Domitianus as manifestly appereth by their Reignes.
For Nero reigned .x. yeares, after the .iiii. yeares which haue specified: Galba .vii. monethes, Otho .iii. monethes, Vitellius .viii. monethes, which was a yeare a half, Vespasianus .x. yeares, Titus .ii. yeares.
So that these .xxv. yeares, that Peter should haue ben resident at Rome should haue too the .ii. yeare of the Emperour Domitianus
So that Peter should not haue dyed in the tyme of Nero as the Papistes reporte, who affirme with one voyce, that Peter was crucefied at Rome with his héeles vpward his head downward, the .xxxvii. yeare after Christes passion, the .xiiii. yeare of Nero whe~ as wée haue proued by their own reportes, Chronicles, Histories, Authors, that hée lyued .xv. yeares longer, euen too the seconde yeare of the Emperour Domitian which was after the passian of Christ lii. or liii. yeares.
Hithertoo wée haue proued by the and by argument, and also by authoritie, that Peter was neuer at Roome.
They obiect, that the olde Authors saee, that hée was there: answer, that those olde Authors haue no staffe too stick too, no scripture, no sufficient authoritie, not one woorde, neyther out of the olde Testament, nor of the newe.
Let vs confute Egesippus out of whom they haue all their fables, whereby they woold proue Peter to haue bin at Roome.
First this fabulous and lying Egesippus is not hée that Eusebius maketh mention of Lib. fourth.
For hée gathered his books out of the Ghospell Hebraeos Syros hée wrote commentaries, wherin hée wrote the doctrine actes of the preaching of the Apostles in an homely simple stile inmanner of an history, and did contend erfectually against Heretiques: this fabulous Egesippus wrote in Greke.
Secondly, this Author wryteth an highe stile, affecteth an other kynd of phrase: the other is an homely stile, as Hiero~ noteth.
This suborned Egesippus wryteth fyue bookes of the destruction of Hierusalem out of Iosephus the other the actes of the church, fro~ the passion of Christ to his own tyme, which was after Christes natiuity about
Thirdly, the trew Egesippus wrote the actes of the preaching and doctrine of the Apostles, out of the Ghospell secundum Hebraeos Syros this suborned Egesippus gathered his bookes out of Iosephus neyther doth Hierom nor Eusebius make mention of them.
Fourthly, this Eusebius that wée haue, maketh mention of Constantinople, vnto the which the citie of Rome was equall in dignitie.
This was done in the tyme of the Emperoures Gratian and Theodosius in the yeare of Christ, as Pantaleon noteth,
and this Councell spoken of in the latter Egesypus, was about the yere of Christ
so that now it is manifest, that this latter Egesippus was
yeare and aboue after the former, and therefore such a one as serued to set out fables for the mayntenance of the Pope his superstition: reade more in Cornelius Gualterus, vpon Egesippus, and in Vilierius.
If a man doo well consider those fables, that Egesippus writeth lib.
how that Peter and Simon Magus dyd contende whyther of them should renine Nero his Cosen that was dead, and how that, if Peter could not doo it, hée should dye for it: and if Simon could not, that Peter could doo it, then Simon should suffer death.
And howe that Peter met Christ at the gates of Rome, and asked of Christ, Domine quo vadis? And how that Christ answered, come ageyne to bée crucified: and that Peter returned and was crucified with his héeles vpward.
It may bée easely co~sidered that hée was one of the Popes friends, &c. Ireneus in the first chapter of his third booke writeth, that Matthewe wrote his Gospell what tyme as Peter and Paule preached the gospell at Rome, founded the hurch there.
If Peter was at Rome at that tyme when Mathewe wrote his Gospell, then dyd not hée come to Rome in the second, third, or fourth yeare of Claudius as the Catholiques reporte.
For as yit Caligula was aliue, and in the third yeare of his Empyre and reigne, Matthewe wrote his Gospell.
Neyther was Paule at Rome in the tyme of Caligula in whose third yeare Matthew wrote his Gospell, euen eight yeare after Christes ascension, and
Howe could Paule preache at Rome the eyght yeare after Christes when as hée came not to Rome vntill the
yeare after Christes ascension? Could hée preache at Rome before that hée was there? It was the seconde yeare of Nero, that Paule came to Rome, as shall appeare most manifestly to them that will conferre the
of the Actes of the Apostles, with the order of tyme, with the yeares of the Emperours, and with Eusebius in Chronice, and Hierome in the lyues of Ecclesiasticall writers.
yeare of Caligula, which was the eight yeare after Christes Ascension, to bée the second yeare of Nero, whiche was the
Nowe, if Peter came not to Rome tyll Paule was there, or if hée were there with Paule at any tyme, then could not Peter bée there tyll the seconde yeare of Nero, so that hée was neyther at Rome in the tyme of Caligula who reygned thrée yeare: nor in the tyme of Claudius, who reygned
So that by this order, and playne demonstration, Ireneus woordes are neyther of force, neyther woorthy to bée read, much lesse, to bée credited.
Hierome writeth, that Peter came to Rome the second yeare of Claudius, which is no trewer then this that the same Hierome sayeth that Peter was the prince of the Apostles.
Was hée the Prince of the Apostles, when Paule withstoode and reproued to his face? Galat.
whom Christ called Satan? who calleth himselfe but an Elder with the reste?
Could Peter come to Rome the second yeare of Claudius, when as Hierome himselfe in the same place sayeth, that first hée went to Antioche where hée was Bishop, and from thence hée went and preached to the dispersed Brethren in Ponto Gallatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithinia, and then went to Rome the seconde yeare of Claudius and continewed there
If he came to Rome after that hée had bene at Antioche, and in these other countries, as Hierome reporteth, then came not hée to Rome the seconde yeare of Claudius, as the same Hierome contrudeth.
For this yeare was the sixt yeare of Nero, which was after the second yeare of Claudius,
yeare, as proue in this booke, and as it foloweth necessarely by the computation of yeares, and order of the historiographers.
As concerning Eusebius, hée was an Arrian, and gathered his historie out of those bookes that were condemned in codice Sancta Romana dist.
And when hée was an Arrian, hée wrote this historie Tripart. lib.
that Peter came not to Rome tyll the last yeare of Claudius, read Molineus Rhenanus, you shal find many mo reasons wherby ye may co~fute Eusebius.
If ther bée any other authours in this errour, they may be as easely reiected as these.
And if we are forbidde~ to ad any thing, or take any thing away: if ye old authors may cause Peter to be at Rome without authoritie, we may affirme yt he was not at Rome with authoritie: if they of their own heades hold that Peter was at Rome, we may by euident demo~strations, assured arguments, infallible reasons, proue that hée was not at Rome.
If they say and not proue, and wée booth saye and proue, whether is of more Authoritie? They saye that hée was at Rome
yeares, and came eyther in the tyme of Claudius, or Nero: wée proue that all that tyme hée was eyther in Iurie, Antioche, Asia, or Egypte.
They saye that Eusebius, an Arian or counterfeyt Damasus sayeth so: wée saye that Christian Luke, and true Paule prooue the contrarie.
They write contraries: wée concordances, they obsurdities: wée sensible argumentes, they alleadge fables, and wée truths: They say that Peter was at Rome both quicke dead, wée denie both.
They saye yt Peter, when hée died, willed Cleme~t then (being at Rome) to write to Iames of his death.
But Iames was dead by their owne authorities, before Peter suffered, seuen yeares, for Iames was cast downe of the pynacle of the temple at Hierusalem the
yeare after Christes passion, and Peter (as they reported) suffered
yeare after christes passion: could Clement, being alyue, write to Iames being dead? who should carry the letters? If hée went to purgatorie, who knewe where purgatorie was, for than it was not inuented? If hée were in Heauen, thither ascendeth none with letters.
Perhaps Clement should sende the letters and laye them vpon Iames graue, that he might rise on the night and reade them, as in the councell of Nyce they say that Chasantus and Musonius two Bishops of the councell of Nice, dyd subscribe to those matters that were concluded in the councel, desired bythe rest, who layd the actes vpon their graues, requiring them to subscribe for a better assertion, the next morning they resorted to their graues, found both their handes subscribed.
They write that Eusebius reporteth that Peter was of his brethren fellowes, to departe out of Rome, least Nero should persecute him to death.
Peter went out at their request, when he came to the gate he met Christ and saide thus: God saue you Syr, whether goe you? you were best to returne, here is to hotte béeing for you and mée.
Then sayd Chryste, doost thou not know mée Peter? Peter, Peter, returne, hither am come to suffer ageyne.
Naye sayeth Peter, God forbidde, will goe: and so Peter returned, and suffered at Rome
This doctrine taught Doctor Smith, heard him in Whitengton colledge in London, in Quéene Maries dayes.
Hée moued manye affections, and tolde the tale on this wyse: Maysters, sayeth hée, you are in a great errour, as concerning the blessed Sacrament, and all your trust was in Cranmer, Rydley, Latymer.
As for Latymer, hée sayd in open disputation in Oxforde, that hée had no learninge in that matter, but out of Cranmers booke.
As for Cranmer, hée sayde that his learninge came from Rydley.
And as for Rydley, disputed with him my selfe now at Oxeford the other day, and proued my Argument thus: Ille, cui Christus obuiauit Romae, fuit Romae: At Christus obuiauit Petro Romae: Ergo, Petrus fuit Romae.
Hée whom Christ met at Rome, was at Rome: But Christ met Peter at Rome: Ergo, Peter was at Rome.
By this Argument proue twoo thinges, and singuler mysteries of our fayth.
First, that Peter was at Rome, ageynst them that clatter that Peter was neuer at Rome.
Secondly, that if Peter met Christ bodely, as Abdias reporteth, and whiche am sure is true, or else suche an auncient, and holy Father would neuer haue written it.
Then consequently hée maye bée aswell bodely in the blessed Sacrament, as hée was met bodely.
To this Rydley stoode lyke a block, and féelinge hym selfe conuicted, aunswered nothing.
Dyd not handle hym well? Then denyed hée the minor, which proued thus: Christ met Peter goeing out of Rome and sayed, good morrowe Peter, whether goest thou? Peter aunswered, good morrowe good man, whether goest thou? Then sayde Chryste, goe to Rome too suffer, what? sayeth Peter, trowe, onlesse take my markes amisse, you are Ihesus Christe, good Lorde, howe doo you? am glad haue met you here.
Then sayd hée to Peter, goe backe and suffer, or else must et pro te me
When Rydley had heard this my profe, and Abdias authoritie, a Doctoure auncient and irrefragable, hée aunswered neuer a woorde.
And thus cenfuted Rydley in the audience of a thousand, that hée hadde not one woorde to saye: yet you that Christ was neuer in earth since the Ascension bodely: beléeue with mée, that hée is vnder fourme of bread and wyne.
Let this argumente of myne confounde you as it did Ridley your chief champion.
Thus mucth Doctoure Smith, and more in Whitengton colledge churche in London, standing in the streat called towre Ryall, a little aboue the thrée Cranes in the Uynetrée.
If, saye the papistes, wée holde not and defende ageynst these heretiques, that Peter was at Rome than our churches estimation is doone, our prerogatiue perisheth: our preeminence no better then others: our glorie diminished: our holinesse empayred: our authorities annihilated: our honors negnected: our dissimulation detected: our customes colde: our perdones peruerted: our Iubilees iested at: our Religion rayled vppon, and all our pompe fall to nothing.
Christ willeth him that would presume aboue the rest, to bée inferiour to the rest.
Chrysostome sayeth, that hée that in earth séeketh supremacie, shall finde in heauen confusion, neyther shalbée nombred amonge the seruauntes of God.
Hierome sayeth, that wheresoeuer a man be Bishop, whether at Rome, Engubie, Constantinople, Rhegij, Alexandria, Thebes or Guarmaria the office is all one, the merite all one, and degrée all one.
Who soeuer sayeth Gregorie calleth himselfe the vniuersall priest, or desireth to bée called so, is a foreronner of Antichrist, reade Gregorie Epistola
THE SECOND DISCOVRS, wherein is proued that neyther Peter, nor the Pope, is the head of Christes Church.
AS wée hitherto proued in the former Oration, or discourse, that Peter was not at Rome.
So let vs in this seconde Treatise conclude, that neyther hée neyther the Pope, neyther any of his Successoures is the heade of the Churche, neyther the Church or Seate of Rome to bée preferred before others.
As out of the head and brayne, which is the seate of the senses whereof ryseth all knowledge (as the Philosophers and Phisitians write) and also as of synowes wherewith the partes of the body are knit and coupled togither, procéedeth the lyfe vitall and all mouinge.
Euen so from our head Christ, the fountaynes of grace are deryued, and flowe to water our soules, the synowes and sensible doctrine to instruct the mynde, and the spirit of regeneration to renewe the whole man.
As the heade and brayne minister too the whole body féeling and moouing: so is Christ the head of distributing to euery man seuerall gyftes of the Spirit.
Hée that is the head of the church (which is the body of Christ) must néedes gyue lyfe, spirite, moouing, senses, féeling, vnderstanding, grace, and all gyftes of the holy ghost, but the Pope can gyue none of these.
Therefore the Pope is not the heade of the church.
Hée that can not forgyue synnes, is not the heade of the Churche.
The Pope cannot forgyue synnes, Ergo hée is not the heade of the church· Solus Deus condonat peccata Onely GOD forgyueth sinne: The Pope is not God, Ergo hée forgyueth no sinne.
As the man is the head of the Wooman, so is Christ the heade of the church.
This Church are all the faythfull of all ages: the faithfull before the floode: the faythfull after the floode: The Faythefull before Christ, the faythfull after Christ.
If a wooman should haue twoo Husbandes to her head, were shée an honest woman? were shée not an Adultres? were shée not to bée diuorced? Ergo, if the Romishe haue twoo heades, Chryste and the Pope: Shée is a Strumpette, an Harlotre, a Curtesane, and the Churche of Satan.
Moreouer, Christe is zeleous ouer his congregation, hée will haue no fellowes, hée is sufficient alone, hée néedeth not the Popes ayde.
The Popes head may be dronke, Christes is alwayes sobre: his franitique, Christes perfect: his phantasticall, Christes substanciall: his feble, Christes stronge: his mortall, Christes immortall.
Hée that maketh him self the head of the Church, hée must make him self her husband: but what an husband is the Pope? Surely an adulterer, if hée presume too take an other mans wyfe.
Is not the Church Christes wyfe? Tha~ is shée not the Popes, because that shée can not haue two husbands at once.
If hée bée an adulterous head, ergo hée is Antechrist.
Howe coulde Peter bée Pope at Roome, when as it was not lawfull, nor permitted to teache, but priuatlie in houses? Where was his authoritie? where were bothe his swoordes, Temporall Spirituall? Neyther had hée the Temporall to represse Nero his tyrannie, neyther the Spirituall to rule the Clergie.
Was not Paule as good as Peter? Did hée not resist him to his face? Was Paule inferiour to any of the Apostles? Howe chaunceth it, that Peter could not rule them, that put him to deathe? where was the mightie power of M. Pope? Is hée the head of the Church, whom Christ calleth Sathan? Is not that Satanas church, which Satan ruleth? But Peter is called Satan, Ergo that church which Peter ruleth, is the church of Satan.
But saye the Papistes: Our Churche is founded vpon Peter.
Then is the foundation vitious, the buylding odyous, the pillers, which are the colledge of Cardinalles, very rotten and corrupt, and the pallace of Prelates pestilent, and all that they do beastlie, sensuall, carnall of Antechrist.
For Christ sayeth to Peter: Awaye Satan, hence Dyuell: for so signifyeth the Hebrewe woorde: thou offendest mée, thou sauorest of earthly thinges, and not of heauenly.
If the head be Dyuelish, what are the members? what is the body? The Romishe churche is the body, is this churche without spotte or wrincle? is this of God? is this the piller of truthe? is this the Kingdome of God? Naye, it is as Petrarche writeth, the sinke of sinne, and pudle of Godes yre: denne of Wolfes, Lyons, Foxes, Dragons, and Tigres.
Peter sauored of earthly thinges, and sought earthly thinges, and so doo the Popes.
Did not Peter moue Christ, that they might make in the mount where Christ was gloriously transformed, thrée tentes? hée sauored of none other thing, then of earth.
And did Pope Leo any other thinge, when hée answered Peter Bembus a learned Cardinall, alledging a sentence out of the Ghospell to him, that it was knowen well ynough in all ages, how much that fable of Christ did profit the Popes and their successours and adherentes? And that ye shall vnderstand that the Church is neyther founded vppon Peter, nor of any other man, sainct Paule sayeth, that Christ is only the foundacion.
And Christ, when the Apostles did stryue for superioritie preeminencie, sayd to them, reprouing their ambition, that hée that presumed to be highest, should be lowest, and a minister too the rest.
Which woordes declare, that Christ woulde haue no superioritie amonge his Apostles.
Did not Peter deny Christ thrée tymes? Is hée woorthie too bée the head and steward of his family, that denyeth his Master? that sweareth that hée neuer knewe him? Such are Peters Successors, for they sweare that they neuer knew such a beggerly body as Christ was.
Christ a begger and had nothing, wee haue the whole worlde.
And it is prophecied by Dauid of vs: Omnes subiecisti sub pedibus eius, oues boues pecora campi.
To the Pope God hathe layd all thinges vnder his feete, sheepe, oxen, and all cattell.
Peter did fyght and cut of Malcus eare, the Popes cut of the Emperours heades, fyght with them, subdue them, and treade vppon them.
Theire foundation is the sword, fyre, fagotte, tyrannie, and all iniquitie.
This sword Christ bad Peter put vp, they drawe it, and shaketh it ouer all Nations.
Where proue they that Peter was the cheifest of the Apostles? where proue they, him too bée the best, or such a one as all the other shoulde obey? was hee the Uicegerat of Christ? can he doo all that Christ can doo? who was reproued of Paule, the least and lowest of all the Apostles? where was his swoord than? where was his courageous stomacke? Did not little Paule dryue great Peter awaye? Wherfore yee see that the Pope founding his authoritie, ambition, vayne glory, Supremacie, dignitie, and superioritie, vppon Peter, must needes fall, it must needes bee grounded vppon errours and iniquitie.
That which hath twoo heades is monstruous, but if Christ bée head, (as hée is the only head) and the Pope also, than is it a monstruous body.
But more monstruous is that body, that hath thrée or foure heades: for at once there were thrée or foure Popes together, euery one called him self head.
Which of them was the head? let them answer, if they can: if they can not, let the head fall with the body.
If Rome make the Pope holy, if the seate where the Pope is, can not erre, if his church bée catholique and vniuersall, how chaunced it that at one time in the yeare of Christ
Clement was Pope at Auenion in Fraunce, Pope Vrbane at Roome, Benedict the .xiii. succeded Clement at Auenion in Fraunce, Gregorie the .xii. was the Pope at Rome, Iohn Pope at Bononia and all deposed in the Councell of Constance
One of these reuiled an other, blasphemed an other, cursed, excommunicated, calling one an other Antechrist, Traytor, Murtherer, Sonnes of Beliall, Seruantes of Satan, Heretiques, Scismatiques, and Cruell Tyrauntes.
If the presence of Peter make the place too bée the best, and of most authoritie, why was not Hierusalem the chief Cittie, the highe See, and the Metropolitane of the whole worlde? For there Peter preached first, and conuerted many thousandes.
And ye can reade of one that hée conuerted at Roome, when hée was neuer there, as the former discours proueth.
Where gaue Christ, and at what tyme, the authoritie and prerogatiue of and Hée gaue it before his death, and in Iurye: than by good reason that tyme should bée better than this, Iury holyer than Roome: for many hundreth yeares after was Roome established.
Now, bycause neyther tyme nor place is estemed among Christians, but fayth in Iesu Christ: there is the Church, where Christians woorshippe him in veritie.
Then Rome is not too bée preferred before the whole world, neyther a Cittie before Citties, a Towne before a small parte of Europe before Asia, Africa and America.
Besides this, why is not Antioche, Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Bithynia, Asia, Egypte and Babylon too bee preferred, seeing that there hée preached, there hée planted, there hée grafted, there hee did sowe, there hée watered, there hée taught and instructed, and brought the people from errour to truthe, from Superstition to Religion, from Tyrannie to Clemencie, from Fraude too Synceritie, from Dissimulacion and Hypocrisye too Ueritie, from Auarice too Frankenesse, from Wickednesse too Uertue, from Earthly thinges too Heauenly thinges, from the admiration of worldly pompe too the contemplation of heauenly thinges, from Hell too Heauen, from misery too felicitie, and from earthly possession too the inheritaunce of Iacob, too the bosome of Abraham, too the possession of Isaac, too the let of Danyell, and too the Paradise of the blessed thief.
NOWE, haste too the confutacion of their Argumentes, whereby they go about too proue that Peter and the Pope is the head of the Church.
But first will declare a true history, from tyme too tyme, and that breifly, what they were that were afore the Pope, and howe the Churche of Rome came too such a prerogatiue and dignitie.
Christ him self disputed and reasoned with the Doctoures, opposing, aunswering, and them: So did Iohn the Baptiste, so did the Apostles, so did Stephan, so Aquila, Apollo, and all other that had any of theise giftes, which are repeted in sainct Paule.
And this order of euery man too vtter his gifte, continued vntoo the tyme of Theodoret, and vntoo the tyme of Gregorie the ninth Pope of that name, as appereth by his lawe: for hée made lawes, that no Laye man should preache of whatsoeuer degrée hée were, Noble man, Gentle man, and other.
An Elder and a Bishoppe were both one at the beginning, Act.
which two verses conferred will shewe you that there is no difference betweene an Elder and a Bishoppe.
The which Paule proueth, and Hierom and Theodoret vpon the same chapter.
Paule in that place calleth Bishoppes Elders such, as taughte the people and instructed them: and Deacons such as prouided for the poore, lyke too our Church Wardens.
Afterward they began too alter this order: for Eusebius libro
affirmeth, that the Church was a virgin immaculate vntill the death of Iohn the Euangeliste, and than errours to haue creeped in, who dyed from the birth of Christ .xxv. yeares.
And about yeares after his death, or before the Church began to haue one as cheef, whom they called, a President, or one as an of the people: and here sayeth Beza, the Deuill began to practise his peruersitie, and laye the foundacion of his Tyrannye.
Euery Citie and Towne had a Bishoppe that taught them: but emong them there was no Supremacie.
The Emperoures afterward which had certeyne principall Cities in euery Shyre one or more, whereto all the countrie about resorted to the Law, and to decide other matters, gaue greater authoritie to the Bisshoppes of the Moother cities (for so they were called) then too the Bishoppes of other Uillages in the countrie.
And as they called the mother cities Metrapoleis, or matrikous kathedras· or meizonas, poleis: so dyd they call the Bishop or Minister thereof or Pastor, protonton, protenonta, proestota, or patriarchin, or Metropolitin· As they call the great Cities, Moother Cities, Moother Seates, The first seates, or greater Cities: so did they call the priest therof, or mynister, or Byshop, or pastour, the first, the chiefe, the president, a Patriarche, or Metropolitane.
Wée reade in the councell of Nyce, that Alexandria was chiefe ouer Egypt, Lybia and Pentapolis, and Antioche was chiefe ouer the countries about, as Rome was in Italie
Where was there any superioritie more at Rome then at Alexandria, or at Antioche? In the second councell holden at Constantinople, it was decréed, that the Bishop of Alexandria should gouerne the Cast countries, that Antioche might haue that dignitie that was appointed in Nycene councell, the Bishop of Thrace his countrie: the Bishop of Pontus his, the Bisshop of Rome Italie, and so of all the rest.
Socrates in his historie repeteth seuerall Metropolitanes, which are called Patriarches: for they were booth of one Authoritie.
As Nectarius ouer Megapolis, meaning Constantinople and Thrace, Helladius ouer Pontus, Basile ouer Cesarea of Cappadocia: Otrius ouer Miletene in Armenia: Amphilochius in Asia at Iconiam: Optimus at Antioche of Pisidia: Timothe to Alexandria of Egypt: Pelagius to Laodicia: Diodorus to Tharsus: Meletius to Antioche: The Bishoppe of Hierusalem, to Hierusalem.
They (say the false framed Epistles ascribed to Clemens and Anacletus were chiefe citties Metro+poles: where were Archiflamines and Protoflamines, and therfore Pontianus in Atheneus calleth vinum omnium malorum Metropolin, and so say these forged Archiflamines were turned into Archibishoppes.
Because that the first Emperours were at Rome, therefore it was called ta presbeia tis timis, that is, the chief honour was gyuen to Rome: It was the first: and Constantinople was the second Of this equalitie or Superioritie, or inferioritie read the Councell holden at Chalcedon in the yeare of Christe
And Vielerius, where it was concluded that Constantinople was of the same authoritie with Rome, though it be the second after, and Alexandria the third, and Hierusalem the fourthe.
Ihon Bishope of Constantinople, ambitiously desired to be Supreme head oikoumenikon pasis tis oikoumenis, the Uniuersall Bishoppe of the whole world that was habitable.
And therefore Gregorie the firste Bishop at Rome of that name, called the same Iohn, the forerunner of Antichriste, Epist. lib.
Halfe a score yeare after, or little more, Boniface the Thirde of that name was made Bishop at Rome, and the firste that was ordeined or named Pope, or Summus Pontifex, the Highe Bishop, and this dyd the Emperoure Phocas to haue ayde of the Pope, which killed the Emperour Mauritius.
his wyfe, his brother, and his sonne, with many other, and made himselfe Emperour.
After him euery Pope encreased his authoritie with priuiledges, statutes, decrées, and preceptes, tyll that they grewe to such dignitie, that they created Emperoures, who were wont to create them, they deposed them, they fought with them, they trode on their neckes, they rebelled ageynst the~, they cursed them with booke, bell, and candell lighted, they pardoned them all that would fight ageinst the Emperour.
They alledge Scripture for their purpose, as the deuill dyd to Christ.
They obiect this place of the Gospell written by Saint Matthew: Thou art Peter, and vpon this Peter will buyld my Church.
Peter, saye they, is the foundacion of the Church, of him it dependeth, in him it resteth, and hée is the head thereof.
Let vs aunswere this Obiection with the true Interpretation, and Exposition of Chrystes mynde.
Thou art Peter, &c. Thy name, sayeth Christ, is Symon, but hencefoorth it shalbe Peter, a Rocke, or stone, or rather one depending of the rocke, as promised in the first of Iohn, ver.
that thou shouldest bée called Cephas, a stone, but alter it into Peter, bycause thy name shalbe deryued of mée.
For am Petra, and thou Peter: Chryst, and thou a christian: a Rocke, and thou rockye, or buylded vpon the rocke.
The Allusion and affinetie of the Gréeke woord proueth this sense, sy ei petros, &c. Thou arte Peter, bicause thou beléeuest in Petra, that is in mée the Rocke: vpon the which will buylde my congregation, whom will to bée called Peters, as thou arte, deriuing their name of mée the rocke: bycause who soeuer shal beléeue in mée as thou doest, will gyue him ye same name that thou hast.
Wherefore who so confesseth mée as thou doest, shalbe called Peter of mée Petra: that is, a christian of my name Christ.
of Mathew affirmeth, that Peter had his name of Petra, which is Christ.
All are Peters which beléeue in this Rocke: will buylde my famelie and congregation vpon it: wherfore al my famelie and people are Peters.
Peter in this place is put for all christians: and is a generall woorde signifying all beléeuers and confessoures of Christe.
Therefore Hierome vppon the sixte of Amose, termeth all christes Apostles Peters.
And ye Christ founded not his church vpo~ Peter (as our Romish catholiques co~tend) but vpon this rocke, which was Peters confession, yée shal vnderstand by the text it self.
What was his co~fession? that Iesus christ was the sonne of God.
Than this fayth of peters is the foundacio~ of the church cleauing to Christ: which foundacion Paul defineth to be Christ,
This church congregation, bycause it confessed the same Christ, that Peter did, is very well termed described by Paule, to be the establishme~t and piller of truth: and by good reason, considering it is defined to bée Christes body, out of whose head is deriued whatsoeuer nourisheth the body.
Who soeuer hath this fayth, and is a member of Christes body, is a Peter.
As Christ is called a stone, so are his people and seruauntes named lyuely stones by participacion: as they are the light of the world, and salte of the earth: bycause the light and salte that they haue, is deriued and procéedeth from him, as of Petra, Peters, of Chryst, christians.
That this is the true meaning of this place, it is euident hy the
where the same doctrine is applied to all Christians, whan hée sayeth: If thy brother trespasse ageynst thée, tell him his faulte betwéene thée and him: If he heare thée, thou hast wonne thy brother.
What is it too winne a mans brother, but to loose him from his sinne, wherwith hée was bound? By the which, if hée will not bée corrected, lette him bée as an Heathen and a Publicane.
And thus hée is bound, bycause hée wil not repent.
For, sayeth Christ, (speaking to all christians) what soeuer yée binde or loose vpon earth, shalbée bound and loosed in heauen.
Adam and Eue in Paradise were the true church, who when they heard the promise, how that the séede of the wooman, Iesus Christ, should burst the Serpentes head, beléeued it: vpon which beléefe Christ buylded his congregation: and this is the Rocke.
They did binde themselues in eating of the frute, in not obeinge the co~maundement, in offending the lawe.
They loused themselues in confessing their faulte, obeying chrystes voyce, lamentinge their facte, and beléeuing in him, who should bée borne of the séede of a wooman: their faith confession of their offence with amendment of lyfe, were the keyes of heauen.
By them they repossessed their felicitie, which was lost, and reentred into heauen.
Christ graunted to twoo or thrée gathered togyther in his name, their requestes, and hée to bée among them.
If this power and prerogatiue bée equall and particularly gyuen to euery christian, and generally to all: than is it not onely proper to the Pope.
If all the congregation may binde and loose, then is the Popes authoritie nothing, and hée himselfe to be excluded as a reprobate, abhorred as a dissembler, defaced as an hipocrite, reiected as Psichicus in Tertullian was, (who bragged as the Pope dooth, that he had authoritie to forgyue sinnes) deposed as an vsurper, and condemned as an Antichrist· The congregation is buylded vpon the rock.
Who is the Rocke? Christ, not the Pope: faith in Iesu Christe, not execrable pardones: hope in the Lorde, not in man.
If the Churche and Congregation bée a buyldyng, as Paule declareth, and an hasbandrie, and vyneyarde as the prophetes testifie: and if Christ bée the buylder, as is manifest, and the Husbandma~: than hath the Pope no authoritie.
That euery man is Peter that confesseth Christ with the same fayth that Peter dyd.
Heare Origen his interpretation discoursing vpo~ this place, who was within
If wée affirme and confesse sayeth Origene that Christ is the sonne of the immortall God, as Peter did, then are wée Peters, and shall obteyne the same felicitie that hée hath obteyned, because our confession and his is all one.
If wée confesse Christ to bée the sonne of God, the father reuealing it too vs, it shalbée sayd to eche one of vs: Thou art Peter, and vpon thée will buylde my congregation.
Euery man is Petra a Rocke, and lyuely stone, that is a follower of Christe, of whom they dranke, which dronke of the spirituall Rocke following them.
Upon euery such rocke is the congregation of God buylded.
If a man ymagine the whole congregation and church to bée buylded vpon Peter only, what will yée saye of Iames and Iohn, the thun+dering children, and other of the Apostles? In déed it was spoken to Peter, thou art Peter, and vppon this rocke will buylde my Congregation: Notwithstanding it is spoken in lyke manner to all the Apostles, and to all perfect and faythfull men: because they are all Peters and Rockes, and vppon all them and the prophetes is Christes church buylded: And the Gates of Hell shall not preuayle ageynst any of them.
These gates of hell, are vyces, sinnes, and other corruption of mans nature, which shall neyther reigne in their mortall bodyes, neyther preuayle.
Doest thou think that the keyes of the Kingdome were onely gyuen to Peter, and to other, neyther any other should receyue the~? If these wordes were not common to all men, as they are (I will gyue vntoo thée the Keyes of the kingdome of Heauen) how can all those sayings and thinges which are applyed to Peter before bée commune to all men? For Christ thus spake in commune to them all: whom doo you saye that am? And Peter answered in the name of them all: Doth hée not vtter the same in playner woordes, In the
saying to all the Apostles, brething vpon them: Receyue the holy ghost: whose sinnes yée forgiue, they shalbée forgyuen, and whose yée retayne, shalbée reteyned.
All they that are imitators of Christ, are likewyse called Peters, and rockes, as Christ and his faythefull, of whom spirituall men drinke spirituall drinke.
Of Christe all his are called Christes or christians, according to the Prophet, who sayeth, hée would saue his Christes.
As Christe is called rightuousnes, and wysdome· so are wée called rightuous, because Christ is our rightuousnes and wisdome.
yeare after Christ, writing ageynst Phisicus the highe Bishop of Bisshoppes, who tooke vppon him to forgiue sinne, adulterie fornication, and other vices, sayeth thus: Shewe mée examples of the Prophetes, and of the Apostles, and will acknowledge thy holynesse, diuinitie, and godhead.
If thou canst doo so, will graunt thou canst forgiue sinne: If thy office bée onely to teache and mynister, then is it not to forgiue sinne? How hast thou this authoritie? thou presumest of this place.
But Peter was commaunded to forgyue his brother so oft as hée offendeth: which sentence perteyneth to all men.
The church is not the nomber and rable of Bishoppes.
This authoritie is of the Lord, and not of his seruaunts: of God, not of any priest.
Who dare attribute to man that which is proper to God? who can loose an other man from death, saue onely the sonne of God? Hée in his passion delyuered the théefe from death.
Wherefore, if thou followest him in forgyuing sinnes, and canst saye, thou hast not offended: praye thée suffer for mée.
If thou bee a sinner, how can thy oyle serue both for thée and mée, for thy lyght and myne? It is in Mat.
that Christ had power to forgiue sinnes, and know mens hartes, but thou canst doo neyther.
If thou presumest, proue by scriptures, or by miracles, as Christe did.
Augustine writeth thus vpon this place: Uppon this Rocke, which thou confessed, Peter: vpon this rocke which thou acknowledgest: saying, thou art Christ the sonne of the immortall God.
Upon this Rocke will buylde my Congregation: that is vppon my selfe the sonne of the immortall GOD: vppon mée will buylde it, and not vppon
Men béeing disposed to buylde vpon men, sayd, holde of Apollo, an other of Paule, an other of Cephas, which is Peter.
The same Augustine vpon the .xxi. of Iohn, sayeth, this congregation can not fall, bycause it is founded vpon the Rocke, of the which Rocke, or Petra Peter hath his name: for Petra which is the Rocke, hath not his name of Peter, but Peter of Petra the Rocke.
As Christ hath not his name of a Christian, but a Christian of Christ.
Christ is the end of my fayth, sayeth Ambrose vpon the ninth of Luke, the end of my fayth is the Sonne of God.
Wherfore beléeue as Peter did, that thou maist bée blessed.
The grace of Christ is great, which hath communicate almost all his names with his Disciples.
Christ is the light of the world, the lyuely bread, and the Rocke, and yet his Disciples are the light of world.
Neyther did Christ deny his Disciple the strenght and sowndnes of this word, bycause hée had the constancy of his fayth of Petra
The Rocke is the fayth in Iesu, and fayth is the foundation of the church.
If thou beest a Rocke, thou shalt bée in the church, bycause the church is buylded vpon the Rocke.
And after this sense doo all the Gréekes and Latines interprete this place.
Hell gates shall not preuayl against this fayth, this rocke, and against such as confesse Christ, with as good a fayth as Peter did.
The Metaphor is taken of the Gates, wherein the Iewes Gentiles exercised their Iudgementes, as appereth in Moses and Iob.
And bycause wicked Iudges did there gyue false sentences, absolued the offenders, and condemned the innocentes, therfore false Iudgement, and Tyrannicall Iudges, and iniurious Magistrats, are called Hell gates, that is, the Gates of death, the Iudgement seates of death.
Such a strong rocke, such a valiant membre of Christ, and such a lyuely stone of Christes congregation, was Ieremy, whom God sayd, hée woold make a strong defenced Towne, an yron Piller, a Walle of stéele, against the hole land, against the Preistes, Kinges, people, and the mighty Princes of Iuda, and such Tyrauntes Ieremy intreateth of in the end of his fystenth chapter.
If euery good man bée a lyuely stone, as Peter him self writeth, and all the congregation, a Spirituall howse, and the howse of God, the piller and ground of truthe, and lykewyse Christes own body, and the fulnesse of him that filleth all thinges: Than is not the Pope, Cardinalles, and Clergie, the church and pillers, in whom dwelleth no vertue.
Neyther Peter had any other keys than Adam, Seth, Noe, Melchisedeck, Abraam, Iob, Moses, and all the faythfull had from the beginning.
The keys of the Kingdome of heauen, are the opening and interpretacion of the Scripture.
What keye (sayeth Tertullian in the .iiii. booke against Mar.) had the Doctours of the Lawe, saue interpretation? Tertullian inuehing ageinst the Eustix, affirmeth the keys to bée gyuen generally to all, the which euery man whan hée departeth hence, carieth with him.
Wherfore, who so euer confesseth his sinnes, repenteth, and beléeueth in Christ, hath these keyes, wherwith hée openeth the locke, and entereth intoo heauenly felicitie.
sayeth: Too binde, is too perseuer in errour, too procede in vyce: too louse, too repente him of his sinne, beléeue that here in earth his sinnes shall bée forgiuen him.
Hée that giueth authoritie too the Church, is supreme head.
But the Pope giueth authoritie to the church, ergo hée is supreme head.
Wée proue it (say they) by S. Augustine, who sayeth: wold not beléeue the Scriptures, if the catholique church should not moue mée.
answer: This church that Augustine speaketh of, is not the church of Rome: and therfore the Pope giueth no authoritie to the church.
If Augustine had meaned the church of Rome, then their argume~t myght haue semed to haue had a good ground.
But Augustine meaned the church of Christ, as the Crede it self expoundeth it.
What is the Catholique Church? The Crede answereth and interpreteth in these words: communion, societie, or companie of all Saincts and Godly men.
Nowe, if Rome bée all the world and a communion of Saincts only, then is it the only Church: but it is neyther all the world, neyther a communion of Saincts, therfore it is not the Church.
Are shamefull synners Saincts? horrible offenders Holy? Augustine meaned by the Catholique Church, Christ and his Disciples, and the consent of all them, which sawe Christ, which heard him and his Disciples: and therfore is it called in the common Crede of Nice, the Apostolique church.
If Augustine did imagine that the Scriptures should take authoritie of the church, it had bin an absurditie: considering that there is no congregation so perfect, no company so holy, no men so pure, which do not dayly desire God too forgyue them their offences, as they forgyue them that offend against them.
If wée saye, wée sinne not, wée are lyers, and there is no truth in vs.
Let vs proue both by Reason, which is the Lawe of Nature, infixed in man Naturally, and by Scripture, that the Church doth take her authoritie of the Woord, and not the Woord of the Church.
If Cleantes and other Philosophers, as Tullie testifieth, affirme partly by the Naturall motions of their myndes, no doubt moued by inspiration, that there is a GOD: partly by the presciencie and foreknowledge of the thinges to comme, partly by the commodities which proceede of the temperature of the ayer, the plenty abundance of all thinges necessary for mans vse: partly by tempestes, thunder, inundacions, hayle, lightening, earthquakes, stormes, wonders, miracles, blasing starres, eclipses of Sonne and Moone, of the reuolution of the heauens, of the constant and certein course of the fixed Starres and Planettes.
Than must wée confirme with Dauid and Paule, that Gods power, nature, and diuinitie, is knowen by visible thinges subiected to our senses.
If Dauid and Paule proue by the naturall courses of the heauens that there is a God, neyther any people to bée so ignorant, any so rude, any country so Barbarous, which haue not heard their voyces: for Dauid sayeth: Their sound are gone through all the world.
Or as it is in the Hebrew: Their rule course is knowe~ through all the world.
By a figure the sound voyce is attributed in the
Psal. to the heauens, bycause they declare vntoo vs with their constant course mouing, and other meruelous dispositions, constellations, and influences, that there is a God.
And by this meanes Paule proueth the Gentyles to bée without excuse, bycause they might haue knowen God by his creatures, and dyd knowe, but dyd not glorifye him as God.
By these it is euident, that the heauens and Gods woounderous workes are not the causes why there is a God, but God is the cause of them, and they are as witnesses, and testimonies, that there must néedes bée a God.
And bycause al the Scriptures teache nothing else but God to bée the maker, defender, and gouerner of all, wée are assured that they are the true scriptures, bycause they agrée with this lawe of Nature, wyth this Heauenly description, and celestiall disposition, wherby there is vnderstand to bée a God.
If Dauid and Paule prooue the diuinitie, power, and prouidence of God by his creatures, so must wée allowe the scriptures by the same meanes, bycause they differ not from the discourse.
Wherefore the church taketh no authoritie of it selfe, but of God: nor the scriptures any power of men, whiche are full of erroures.
Wée knowe, Moses, Danyels, Salomons, Iobs woorkes, and the rest of the scriptures to bée of force, bycause they agrée with the rule of nature.
If a Lawyer aunswere by the Lawe, hée dooth his dutie: but if hée aunswere of his own brayne, it is nought, neyther will any man beléeue him.
Hée is a wicked Iudge that attributeth more to hys owne witte and will, than to the lawe.
This doth the Pope, contrarie to all the auncient Doctours, and vertuous writers, who affirme no man to bée beléeued, onlesse hée alleadge the scriptures.
If an Ambassadour goe from one Prince to an other, and be commaunded neyther to adde to his commission, nor diminishe, hée is a traytour if hée doo.
How much more the Pope, who by his false embassage, dooth not onely adde and diminishe where hee lusteth, but also chaungeth, peruerteth, correcteth, depraueth, and abolissheth the Scriptures, setting vppe hys owne constitutions and braynelesse Decréees.
The Prince to whome this Embassadour is sent, cannot tell whether his commission is true or no, but by conferring of the other Princes letters, out of the which he must haue the truthe: So must wée runne to the scriptures, and trye by them whether the Pope and other impure spirits doo well in vsurping such authoritie.
The Church may bée a witnesse, that these are the Scriptures, as the heauenly bodyes, that there is a God: are the scriptures any better, although they bée as testimonialles? The church may bée witnesse, the faythefull people may testifie that these are the scriptures, and yet the scriptures perfect, constant, and certayne of them selues.
willeth Cresconius to omitte the authoritie of Cyprian and alledge the scripture, the which, if hée could hée would gyue place.
Ageynst Maximinus hée willeth him to let the councelles alone, and bring scripture, that thereby truth myght be tryed.
The Pope is called in the first chapter of the Gospell of Iohn, ver.
Cephas, and Cepha in the Gréeke toung is Caput, a head, Ergo the Pope is head of the church.
Your ignorance is intollerable: you despise the tunges, yée will rather cleaue to your olde errours, and gloses, then to séeke for the truthe.
You forsake the fountaynes, and digge and drinke of pudles and kennelles: You wrest and turne the scriptures from the meaning of Christe, too satisfie your own opinions.
Your reading in the Texte Cephas which is a Syrian woorde, thought that it had ben Cephale a gréeke woorde.
For, saye you, Cephas is an head in gréeke, and commeth of Cephale and therefore you saye that Peter, who was called Cephas, is the head of the church, when as Cepha, the Syrian word, which signifyeth a stone, being turned into Gréeke, soundeth Cephas.
Thus yée turned whyte into blacke: ée choppe, ye chaunge, ye turne, ye peruerte and depraue all for lacke of knowledge.
For Christ sayeth, that wheras Peter was called before Symon, his name should be chaunged and called Cephas which is a stone, as Iohn himselfe interpreteth it.
Bycause that not onely Peter, but also all they that beléeue in Christ, are lyuely stones.
As out of a stone commeth fyre, so dooth burning charitie out of godly men.
As a stone or Rocke is stronge, stedfast and firme, so is euery Peter, meane euery Christian, ageynst whose fayth no Tyrannie, no Hell gates, no persecution, no affliction, can preuayle.
What doo saye, doo they not preueyle? yea, they preuayle ageynst the bodye, the Soule they cannot kyll.
Is not hée the chief and head that is firste named? Is not a King named afore his subiectes? The husbande before the wyfe? Peter was first named.
aunswere, Is Priscilla better then hir husbande, bycause that shée is first named in the text, and Aquila after her.
But that cannot bée, for S. Paule sayth that the man is the woomans head.
This woord Protos, as Theophilacte interpreteth, hath hys respect onely to his brother Andrewe, who was called before, and Peter after, for they twoo were protokleti
And notwithstanding that Peter is named first in some places, yit is Andrewe named before him, as in the first of Iohn, ver.
Philip, sayeth Iohn, was of the same Citie that Andrewe Peter were of.
In ye which text Peter was not named the first but only with the rest.
For as the Moone taketh light of the Sunne, so dooth the Emperour of the Pope.
And the Pope maye treade vppon the Emperoures necke, as Pope Alexander dyd vppon the necke of Fredericke, the seconde Emperour of that name.
And that was prophecied longe before by Dauid, a friend of ours, in these woordes: Super Aspidem Basyliscum ambulabis, conculcabis Draconem Leonem: Thou shalt walke vppon the Adder and Basyliske, and shalt tread vppon the Dragon and Lyon.
Where is your Truthe, where is your Obedience? Was it not spoken of Christe, and so generally to all good men, ageynst whome the force of the Deuill should not preuayle? Doo you so intreat your Kinge and Prince? Howe dare you bée so bolde, as to call your Emperoure Aspis, Basylick, Lyon and Dragon? much lesse ought you to tread vppon them, too putte them too deathe, and too depose them.
They haue authoritie by Gods woord too rule ouer you, too haue you in subiection, and not you them.
You alledge Scripture as though the Dyuell did too Christ: and the next verse, too that which the Dyuell alledged: as though the Dyuell and the Pope were saying Matynes toogether.
Well say what ye will, our holy Father may do what hée list.
What, if hee should sell the whole world, perhaps ye will say that it were Symonie: but will sweare vppon a booke, that it were no Symonie, though hée solde the whole world, bycause that hée selleth but his owne: for so our olde freind Dauid prophecied vppon him: Omnia subiecisti sub pedibus eius, oues boues pecora campi.
Thou hast put all thinges vnder his féete, all shéepe and oxen, yea all the beastes of the field.
Surely Dauid speaketh of man, too whom God hath giuen all thinges for his vse commoditie: and Allegorically too Christ, whom hée hath made Lorde and King ouer all.
Did not Pope Agatho write in an Epistle to the Emperours in the fourth Action of the Synode at Constantinople, that the church of Roome did neuer erre, neyther was possible that it should erre? Is not this ynough? Is it not a goodly saying? Is it not woorthy too bée embraced? what a goulden sentence is this? Where can you read the lyke? assure you it is not possible too bée answered.
answer, that am able too proue that euery Pope hath erred, if synne bée errour.
Moreouer, the most iust man sinneth seuen tymes, and hée that sayeth, that hée hath no sinne, is a lyer, there is no truth in him.
Panormitane an Archebishoppe did affirme and reason in a Councell at Basile, in the .xxxix.
Session, that the Pope ought too bée aboue all Bishoppes.
answer, that the sayd Panormitane made an Oration too that effect, and made the Pope Lorde ouer the Church: notwithstanding the Bishoppe of Argens, Iohn Segouius, and Fraunces de Funx, Diuines, confuted that errour in the said Councell, proued Pope Eugenius the fourth of that name to bée a relapse, and an heretique: bycause yt hée tooke vpon him too dissolue, transporte, prorogue that Councell.
Can hée bée Lorde ouer the Church, that should bée a minister, and as hée wryteth him self, Seruus seruorum Peter willeth no man, no Bishoppe, too rule ouer the Chuch, but too bée ruled by the Church.
haue prayed for thée, Peter, that thy fayth should not fayl thée.
Hée can not erre, whom Christ prayeth for: but Christ prayed for Peter, ergo Peter could not erre.
deny the proposition, which you call the Maior, for Christ prayeth for all men, as well as for Peter, and also for them that persecute him: ergo by your argument, all men should bée head of the Church, yea euen they that persecute Christ, as the Pope doth.
Augustine wryteth, that Peter figureth all Christians, the vniuersall Church: ergo when Christ prayed for Peter, yt hée should not erre, hée prayed also for all Christians, and for the vniuersall church, that it should not erre.
And that this is Christes meaning, ye shall vnderstand by the often fall of Peter after this prayer of Christ: for hée denyed Christ thrise, was also reproued of Paule after this prayer.
Peter, féede my shéepe: these woords giue too Peter a superioritie.
answer, that Christ did commaund Iames and Iohn with the rest of the Apostles to doo the lyke Did they not féede the shéepe of Christ also? Did not Iames preache at Hierusalem, and Iohn at Ephesus Moreouer, Paule exhorteth the elders of Ephesus too féede the flock and church of God committed too their charge: wherfore too féede Christes shéepe, is as well proper too all men that haue the gift, as too Peter.
As Christ came too doo the will of his Father, so must you doo the will of your mother the churche of Rome.
answer, that you call the church of Rome the Pope his Cardinalles, but Christ calleth his church generall, and not speciall, a communion of Saincts, and not a rable of Bishoppes, as Tertullian writeth, Catholique and not Priuate.
For Christ sayeth, there be two or thrée gathered together in his name, there is hée among them, yea though they bée Laye men, as Tertullian noteth.
Is the Pope the churches sonne? or is hée her father? If her sonne, what a sonne is hée, that vsurpeth and preferreth him self before his mother? Therfore sayeth Augustine God will not acknowledge him self to be his father, that will not confesse the church to be his mother.
answer, that when the Pope is cut of by death, where is your head? is it not dead? where is the body? is it not dead? But the body that is the Church, lyueth alwayes, eyther Militant, or Triumphant, or rather both: Ergo wée must looke for an other head, that can not dye, euen Christ aboue.
a girdell hauing seuen keyes and seuen seales, in token of his seuenfolde power, according to the seuenfolde grace of the holy Ghost, of binbing, loosing, shutting, opening, sealing, resigning, and iudging.
answer, that it is blasphemy to compare the Pope with the holy Ghost.
Is not hée Antichrist, that attributeth to him self all the giftes of the holy Ghost? The .xiij.
answer to this obiection on this wyse: Wée reade that Christ called the first councell, willing the Apostles not too departe out of Hierusalem but to looke for the promise of the Father.
In the election of the seuent deacons (which was the second councel) Peter did not call the councell, but
Where it apereth that Iames was the chéefe and not Peter.
Was the Pope called to any of these councels? Nay surely, they neuer knew him.
And many yéeres after Christ all the councels, til the Pope began to rule, were gathered togither by the Emperours, Kies, princes, and other magistrates.
Omnino definimus, declaramus, pronu~ciamus, omnem creaturam subesse Romano pontifici de necessitate salutis.
We define, declare, and pronounce that euery creature must be vnder the Pope of necessitie, or els it cannot be saued.
answer that saluation commeth nether from the East nor the west, neither from Rome, neither from priest, prelate, nor Pope, but from God only.
Your welth and riches giue you aucthoritie, you are rich in reuenues, but poore in heauenly treasures.
Blessed bee the poore in sprite, you are arrogant and presumptuous since that venym, meane riches, entred into the church, as the Lord Cobham sayde, whom the Archebishop of Caunterburie, Thomas Arundell asked what hée meaned by that venyme.
For than cryed an Aungell in the ayre, as your owne Cronicles make mention, wo, wo, wo: Nowe, euen this daye is venyme powred into the church.
Chryst was méeke and mercifull: the Pope is proude, and a Tyraunt.
Christ is poore and forgaue: the Pope is riche and a malicious murtherer.
Rome is the nest of Antichrist, and out of that filthie nest, come out vncleane birdes, Prelates, Priestes, Monkes, Cardinalles, which are the body of Antichrist: and the pilde Fryers the Tayle, which couer his most filthie parte.
For they preache lyes, and therfore are the tayle behinde.
Ieremie prophecieth of the church of Rome saying, beholde haue set thée ouer all Nations and Kingdomes, to pluck vp, and to breake downe, and buylde, and to plant.
aunswere, that God commaunded Ieremie to pull vp the wéedes of superstition, and to pull downe all the monumentes of Idolatrie.
But the Pope draweth this godly sentence to the defence of his vsurped power, peruerting the mynde of the holy ghost, and deprauing the Text of Ieremie: and by this Text hée vsurpeth that hée may pull down the Gospell, and set vp his decréees: roote out the truthe, plante heresie or superstition, as it is written of him in another place: Diruit, aedificat, mutat quadrata rotundis.
Iohannes de turre cremata a holy Cardinall, writeth thus: Papa est Rex Regum, Dominus dominantium, verus Dominus totius orbis, iure, licet non facto.
The Pope is King of Kings, Lord of Lordes, and the true Lord of the whole world, by right, though not in déede.
And that Constantinus when hee gaue him Rome restored to him but his owne, for the Pope, as S. Iohn writeth of Christ, in propria venit, sui eum receperunt: Hée came into hys owne, and his owne receyued him.
aunswere, Is not hée Antichrist that peruerteth the Scriptures, and that eyther addeth or taketh awaye: but hée taketh awaye Non and attributeth the Texte to him selfe, whiche vtterly peruerteth the Text.
What a presumptuous Prelate is hée that calleth himselfe King of Kinges, and Lord of Lordes? If yée reade the letter sent to Cardinal Poole by Bishop of London, and Tunstall Bishop of Durham, and the booke of Obedience, written by Stephan Gardner Bishoppe of Wynchester, which all were ranck Papistes: ye shall vnderstand that they proue that the Pope is not the heade of the Church.
The sayd Poole dyd saye that Zuinglius opinion in the Sacrament was most probable, which hée could bée content to followe, if the Church of Rome had not decréeed the contrarie.
None hath power ageynst the Pope, no more then the Axe ageynst the Hewer.
aunswere, that hée maye well bée compared to a Hewer, which by his Axes and cruell tyrauntes hewe downe the good tymber, and if hée could, would cut off the Emperours and Princes neckes.
You heretiques obiect, that the Canon Lawe sayeth, that Balaam when hée was reproued of his Asse figureth the Pope and Prelates, and the Asse their subiectes.
Ergo, saye you heretiques, the Pope may bée reproued of his subiectes, but that is no example to bée followed.
For it pleaseth not our holy father to bée Balaam or his Asse.
aunswere, that if yée admitte other partes of the Canon Lawe, why will yée not admitte this? Dooth Balaam signifye Prelates? Surely your own Lawe subuerteth it selfe.
For whether was Balaam or his Asse wyser? If his Asse, as shée was in déed, then are the Popes subiectes wyser.
The Pope may not bée accused of any cryme, niether of murther, neither adultery, neyther symonie, or such lyke.
aunswere, Is not murther contrarie to the sixte commaundement? Is not adulterie ageynst the seuenth? And theft ageinst the eight? And Symonie an offence ageynst the holy ghost? And other vyces ageynst holesome doctrine? Besydes this, neyther murther nor adulterie shall enter into the kingdome of God.
Hée that disobeyeth mée, is as much to bée cursed, as hée that denieth the Omnipotencie of God.
aunswere, that this is the voyce of Antichrist, and therfore not woorthie to bée aunswered.
It maye séeme well verifyed of mée that was spoken of Christ, Psalm.
Omnia subiecisti sub pedibus eius, oues, boues, vniuersa pecora campi, volucres coeli, pisces maris: Thou hast subdewed all things vnder his féete: Shéepe, Oxen, and all cattell of the field, the birdes of heauen, and the fishes of the sea.
aunswere, Is not hée the child of perdition, that chalengeth that which was proper to Christe, and compareth him selfe wyth God?
They saye hée is all in all, and can doo all that God can doo, Claue non errante.
Doo you not vnderstande by Oxen the Iewes, and Heretiques: by cattell, Paganes: by shéepe Emperours, Princes, and Prelates: by birdes, the Aungelles and Potentates of heauen, ouer whom hée hath power, and whom hée doth excell in foure pointes, in Iurisdiction, in administration of the Sacramentes, in knowledge, and in reward.
By the fishes of the sea, are meaned the soules of purgatorie, as Gregorie ye Pope dyd deliuer the Emperour Traiane out of hell.
The Popes law sayeth, that if any of his Clergie should bée found embracing a woman, it must bée expounded and presupposed, that hée doth it to blesse hir.
aunswere, that wée may not onely absteyne from dooing of euill, but also from all suspicion of euill.
The Pope in his supremacie, is Abell, in gouernement the Arche of Noe, in Patriarchdome Abraham, in order Melchisedech, in dignitie Aaron, in authoritie Moses, in seate Iudiciall Samuell, in zeale Helias, in méeknesse Dauid, in power Peter, in vnction Christ.
aunswere, the Pope cannot bée Abel, for the Pope persecuteth, and Abell was persecuted.
The Arche figureth the Mystical body of Christ: but the Pope presumeth to bée the head, Ergo, hée is not the Arche.
Abraham gaue Tithes, the Pope receyueth: ergo hée is not Abraham: Melchisedech hée is not, for none is after the order of Melchisedech, but Christ onely: As Paule proueth euidently.
Moreouer, Melchisedech is without father or mother, beginninge or ending, the Pope is not.
Aaron ruled not ouer Kings, the Pope ruleth ouer the whole world: Ergo hée is not Aaron.
Moses ruled ouer Iurie the Pope ouer Asia, Africa, Europe, America heauen, Angels, hell damned soules, and the poore wretches of purgatorie, Ergo, &c. Samuell graunted his authoritie to a securall Prince, euen to Saul, the pope denieth it, ergo he is not Samuell.
Helias killed the priests of Baall: the Pope promoteth suche like: ergo hée is not Helias.
Dauid forgaue his enemies, the pope reuengeth: ergo he. &c.
The Emperour Nero persecuted Peter, as they write, but the Pope persecuteth Emperours: ergo, &c. Christ was anoynted of the holy ghost: the Pope of men, ergo he is not Christ.
The sound of our holy father and of his successours is gone through the world, his pardones, his legates, his belles, his bulles, his commissions, his grace, his power, his prerogatiue, his athoritie, is in euery corner of the earth.
answere that this place of Dauid proueth that the merueylous workes of God, as the Starres, the Moone, the Sun and the descryption of the heauenly bodies, declare that ther is a God, and bycause that Dauid expresseth the matter more effectually in his naturall toung, thus he sayeth.
Hashamaim, mesapperim Cheuod el, oumaguas hiadeue, magid harachiang, tom leiom iabbiang omer, velaiel lelaiela iecaue daguath.

Hitherto haue repeted confuted (althogh they nede no confutation, they were so falsely alleged) some obiections although not al which they collect out of the Scriptures, or out of other probable authors.
Now will note certein such absurdities, as they bring out of their lawes, decrées, decretals, out of such as haue for lucre, promotio~, for flatterie bestowed their time in vttering absurdities, and such absurdities, as do more effectually ouerthrowe deface their dooings, then any of our answers or confutations can.
These thought good to signifie, least that any man should thinke that the tyme is euyll bestowed in writing them, worse in reading: and worst of all, in printing.
Ye shall therefore vnderstand, that there is nothing so abhominable, nothing so absurde, so vnreasonable and contrarie to all sense, whiche they dare not bothe speake, write, printe, aduouche, and also defend.
As for example: What say they, though Iulius the second Pope dyd throwe Peters keyes into Tyber, and swore an horribe othe, that séeing they would profite nothing, hée would trye what Paules swoord could doo.
And what, though Iulius the thirde blasphemed for his hoggos fleshe, saying: putano de Dio, dispetto de Dio, bring mée my hogges fleshe.
And likewyse for his Peacock, when one asked, why hys holynesse was so mooued, hée aunswered: If God caste Adam out of Paradise for eating of an Aple, what would you haue mée too doo for my Peacock? Is not my peacock better then an Aple? And thus they aunswer such blasphemies: that, in that the Pope was a man, hée offended, but in that hée was Christes Uicegerent, hée could not sinne: For, saye they, though hee were a desperate man, yet the seate and place, maketh him holye.
Now come to their Obiections which they alleage out of their Canons and Doctours.
HE is, saye they, the head of the Church that ruleth the whole world.
But the Pope ruleth the whole world· Ergo hée is the head of the Church.
They proue it by Thomas, the irrefragable Doctour, in these woordes: The Pope (sayeth hée) is chiefe Bishoppe.
For as a King ruleth his realme, so doth hée the whole world: and Bishoppes, for his helpe and ease, are ioyned in euery citie, as Iudges, Thom. secund. secund.
What an argument is this of Thomas of Aquine? Is it a good comparison to compare a subiect with a King? or rather preferre him before the kinge of the Romanes? Where was his authoritie, when Nero persecuted (as they saye) Peter? Was not Linus (as they reporte) the second Pope at Rome, in the yeare of Christ Where was his vniuersall power? where was his might, when hée was put to death of Saturninus the Consul of Rome who was inferiour to Vespasian being Emperour at that tyme? Did not Domitian kill Anacletus? an.
Did not Trayane fasten an anker aboue Clementes necke and cause him to be cast into the sea? anno.
Did not Aurelianus the Liuetenant the like to Alexander an.
And was not Pius killed in the tyme of Antonius verus? an.
And in the time of Seuerus apprehended, beaten with clubbes, cast in prison, throwen out of a window headlonge, and his body cast into a pitte? an.
And Vrbanus at the same tyme banished, and at length killed? an.
And Pontianus at the same tyme was banished into Sardinia, tormented, afflicted, and suffered death? ano.
And Autherius in the tyme of the Emperour Maximinus an.
Sixtus the second of that name was likewyse martyred, An.
praye you, how ruled they all the world, as Thomas sayeth, the Popes doo? where was their auctoritie aboue all Kinges, Princes, Emperours, and Monarches? If of God, or of Peter, or of them selues, why did they not resist? why were they put too death? If they had none, as none they had in deede, than of whom had the Popes following their power tyrannie, to kill innocentes, to depose Emperours, to disgrade Bishoppes, to rule in hell, heauen, earth, and purgatorie, to absolue poena culpa to do what they lust, to oppresse, banish, and murther? The second Obiection.
Well say what you will, the Pope is meruelous, for hée hath his name of merueling.
And hée is to be wondered at, bycause hée is Peters vycegerent in the earth, for hee hath his name of Papae an Interiection of merueling.
And without doubt, hée occupieth not the place of a pure man, but of the true God.
answer: You say that hée hath his name of Papae an Interiection of merueiling, in deede the Reuelation and Paule sayeth, that Antechrist, when hée shall come, which is the Pope, shall woorke meruailes, and do false myracles by Necromancie and iniquitie.
Hath he not a great preeminence, when as no man neyther may, nor dare, aske him in any matter why he doth so.
Neyther is the Pope Peters vicegerent, but hee occupieth the roome that Peter occupied.
Gloss. in Clement. vna. de iure iur. in verb. vicar.
Doo you not knowe that the Popes name is chaunged in hys Creation, Consecration, and enstalling, that by the chaunging of the name the man may likewise bee chaunged.
For where hée was a pure man before, now is hée become the Uicegerent of the true God: as in example: Who was a cruell tyraunt before, is nowe chaunged and called Clemens.
Hée that was hurtfull, is now Innocent Hée that was a maleface, Boniface: and so foorth of the rest.
Hath not the Pope both the swoordes? Is not hée an heretique that breaketh the constitution of the Pope, or that holdeth, that the Pope is not able to make a constitution? hée is a paynim that wil not obey the Pope.
The Pope may depose the Emperoure without a Councell, yea with a cause or without a cause: Stat pro ratione voluntas.
These Obiections are thus to bée aunswered, that, as none of these are conteyned in the scriptures, no more are they to bée credited than fables of Homer or Ouide.
In chaunging their names, they detect their hypocrisie: who will beléeue that the chaunginge of a mans name will make an euill man, a good man: of a dishonest, an honest? Besydes this, is not the Pope a man still, though hée bée anoynted consecrated, enstalled, and entromyzed? Is not an Axe, an Axe, though hée haue a Childes coat vppon his backe? ought hée to rule the Empernur? Is not hée bounde too gyue too Caesar that which is Caesars? Notwithstanding one cursed Iames de Terano Chamberlayne to Vrbane the sixt Pope of that name in the yeare of Christ
interpreteth this place of Luke, of the Emperours before Christes passion, but after that Chryste was ascendeth into heauen as victor and conquerour, hée writeth thus: When shalbée lifted vp from the ground, will drawe all too my selfe, that is (sayeth the sayd Iames will take away all Empire, Kingdomes, Iurisdictions, and Dominions of the worlde from the Emperours and Kinges, and gyue them too the Pope, who when hée hath subdued them, and brought them in subiection, hée may vse the Royaltie, riches, gorgeous apparell, and all other thinges, as subiect too him.
This cursed Iames, as Molineus termeth him, is too bée condemned of treason for forging a false coyn.
For where it is in Iohn, that Christ by his death should ouercom death, hell, and all the world, hée applieth it to the Pope, of whom Iohn did not once dreame, onlesse hée prophecied of him amongs other Antechristes in his Epistles, whom hée there
And as for the place of Luke, it is to be vnderstanded of Ciuill and temporall Magistrates, and not of Spirituall and Mysticall of Iniquities, and so vnderstandeth Chrysostom, Origen, and Theodoret vpo~ the .xiij. chapter of S. Paule to the Romanes, prouing that all Bishopes such as wée call Spirituall men, must needes bée vnder the Iurisdiction of Ciuill Magistrates, obey them, and paye them Tribute.
Besides this, this Iames proueth, as Augustinus de Ancona did .lxxx. yeares before him, that the Pope had not only authoritie ouer all Kinges and Emperours that were Christend, but also ouer Turkes Paymins, bycause that Christ gaue his full authoritie too the Pope when hée ascended, that Iuditiary power (for these are his termes) ouer euery creature, because that hée left the Pope both the keyes, Temporall and Spirituall.
Hée is the head of the Church that hath twoo keyes, the one too open Heauen gates to his friendes, the other to shutte out his ennemies.
And hée hath thrée Crownes, bycause that hée is a Kinge, a Cesar, and a Bishoppe: or rather, bycause bée hath authoritie in Heauen, Hell, and Purgatorie: or els, as Gregorius Doctor Hispanus did preache in Cambredge, hée sayd, that the Pope was coun+ted in Spayne, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, that was signified by his thrée crownes.
Moreouer, in euery yeare of Iubile hée hath a golden hamer, wherwith hée knocketh at the gates of Paradise.
Is this no preeminence? is not hée the head yt hath this authoritie? graunte that the flattering Glosers of the Canon lawe wryte such thinges, but they are too foolish too bée credited, too false and absurd too bée approued, too ridiculous too bée aduouched, and to detestable to bée admitted.
Hée that hath both the temporall and spirituall swoorde, must néedes bée the head of the church: but the Pope hath bothe, Ergo, hée is the head of the church.
denie the Minor, wée proue it thus: Doo you not reade, that Boniface the eight Pope of that name, came out in a solemne feast daye in the apparel of a Bishop, as gloriously as euer was Aaron with the spirituall swoord, to frame the Spiritualtie withall.
And on an other feast day hée came out in the apparel of the Emperour with great pompe and glorie, with a naked swoord, shaking it, and saying: This is my swoord to correct the Temporall withall: yea euen Kinges, Princes, and the Emperour.
aunswere, that this hée dooth by this rule: Sic volo, sic iubio, stat pro ratione voluntas.
Is not hée the head of the church that is aboue Kings, Cesars, and Councelles, and aboue the whole world? Innocent.
And though all the worlde should gyue sentence ageynst the Pope, notwithstanding his sentence must stand, bycause that hée maye dispense with all thinges: Iud. Glossat. de Capell.
The Pope is aboue all Councelles and Statutes, de elect.
If his authorities bée aboue councels, then councelles bée vayne, and néede not, when as wée may goe to the head and spring, who is aboue eyther councelles or Lawes.
For you say, that all the lawes are in the chest of the Popes brest.
But wée credit not these sayinges, bycause they are made by Popes without authoritie, eyther of Gods woorde, or of olde Doctors.
Wherefore this is that Antichrist, that is described in the Reuelation, cap.
Hée that hath the same authoritie that Peter had, is the heade of the church.
But the Pope hath the same authoritie that Peter had.
denie the Maior, for Peter was not the head of the church, nor any better then the other of the Apostles.
Moreouer, Peter was a meere man, and a meere man was not the head of a spirituall church.
Is not hée aboue all that can dispence with the law of nature, with Moses, with the olde Testament, with the new Testame~t, with Christ, Peter, Paule, and the rest of the Apostles.
For of Antichrist, Paule writeth so in the second epistle to the Thessalonians, the second chapter.
But you say, the Pope doth so: Ergo, the Pope is Antichrist.
There may no man Iudge of the the Popes dooinges, neyther the Clergie, neyther Kinges, neyther Emperours· Shal the Iudge of all bée iudged of any? Is it not knowen through all the world, that the church of Rome doth iudge all the worlde, and it may bée iudged of none? who dare dispute of the Popes dooinges? who doubteth of the Popes holynesse, who is in such authoritie? If hée lacke goods déedes, or any other thing, it is ynough for him to trust in the predecessours of that place.
These blasphemies answereth Paule in the second to the Thessalonians, second chapter, ver.
where hée writeth, that this Antichrist maketh hym selfe God.
Remundus rufus a noble defendor of the holy Sea of Rome, reasoneth thus, the Pope is the cheife because he is the first in tyme, reuerence and power.
In time, for Peter was at Rome the fyrste Pope: in reuerence for who is too be reuerenced more then he? in power, what Bishop, what Prelate, what Monarche is to be compared to him? answere to the firste, that Peter was neuer at Rome, and therefore was neither firste Pope nor last at Rome: moreouer Paule was at Rome before him, by ye testimoni of their owne wryters.
And Peter was no bishop, ergo no bishop of Rome: Peter was an Apostle and no bishop.
bishop kept in a certain place: an Apostle went aboue euery where.
As for his reuerence, what reuerence should the Pope haue aboue others? if he wilbe first hée must be last, as Christ writeth.
As concerning his power, what is it? Who gaue it to him? He is or ought to be a seruaunt, no lorde: a minister, no maister, a member of the body and not the head.
What if Rome were vtterly destroyed by the Turke (as it may be) and the Popes name, glory, dignitie, and memory, cleane extinguished, where should the Romish church be? where should bée all hir decrées? should not all bée vtterly abolished? shall not Christ destroy him with the sprite of his mouth? The .xv. Obiection.
Do you not remember what Nicolaus the first Pope of that name did wryte? He sayed and also determined, that no christian magistrats should haue any power aboue the Pope, bicause that hée is called god, as Antonius writeth. tit.
If no magistrate haue iurisdiction ouer him, if no man, may appeach him, if he be god, is he not worthy to be the head of the Church? graunt that he taketh vpon him all these tytles, and so the deuel would haue done, who moued Christ to sitte downe and worship him, and hée would gyue to him the whole world.
Wherfore hée is the Abomination of desolation, the childe of perdition, Behemoth, Bel, Beliall, a Dogge, a Dragon, a Traytour, the Deuell, a Théefe, an Idoll, a Wolfe, a Serpent, Leuiathan.
The place, nor the Pope cannot erre but onely in that, that hée is man, but in that, that hée is Christes Uicegerent, hée cannot erre: how saye you by this? cracke mée this nutte.
And although that Peter Bembus calleth Alexander the sixte a murtherer: and likewise Iulius the third: yet wée protest, that, if Bembus had ben learned in our Canons, and Gloses, hée would not haue written so.
maruayle what men meane to speake so ageynst our holy Father, séeing hée can make of nothing, something, of iniurie, iustice, potest facere de nihilo aliquid, de iniusticia iusticiam, mutare quadrata rotundis.
The Pope calleth himselfe to witnesse, bycause there is none greater by whom hée may sweare.
Though Paule writeth, and willeth that a Bishoppe should bée without faulte: notwithstanding the Pope may dispence with him: though he be an vnthrift, a Ruffyan, a lyer, a théef, a coniurer, a periured man, suche like.
Iesu good Lord, what, and howe mightie a Prelate is our holy father the Pope: hath not hée authoritie ouer the Aungelles in heauen, and also ouer the damned soules in hell, as Petrus Costus reporteth? aunswere, that all these sayings are full of iniquitie, and rather to bée punished by the Magistrate with the swoorde, then answered with the pen.
Sext. decret. that the Pope maketh the place holy, and therefore Rome is without spotte or wrincle.
answer, if he be an euil man, he depraueth the place, and that the Pope is euill, his frutes do declare.
What if the Pope, sayeth Busgradus carie all the worlde too hell with him, or beléeue that there is no life to come, (as some did) or be an homocide, or a Sodomite, or as blasphemous as Iulius the thirde, or as euell as the deuill, or if he blaspheme the virgin Mary as a ruffian, as the said Iulius did, we must beleue that wée must be saued by him, or elles wée must be dampned without redemtion: for whatsoeuer he dothe wée must beleue it as an article of our faith, for who may or dare aske him why he dothe so.
What shall wée answere to these blasphemies, they are not worthy to bée repeted, to horrible to be mentioned, to absurde to be confuted, to vile to enter into any mans eares.
How answer you this authentical sentence, of the glose of the Prologe of the Clementines, that the Pope is neither god, nor man sed Neuter inter vtrun{que}? If he be neither god nor man, but neuter betwene them both, than is he a monster, or if he bée neither god, nor man, he is surely the deuel, or else some Antechrist.
Is not he the head of the Church that is better then the virgin Mary, but the Pope is better then the virgin Mary: Ergo hée is the head of the Church.
What if should denye the Maior, ye could not proue it: but will deny the Maior: hée that can make him that is better then the virgin Marye, is better then the virgin Marye: But the Pope can make a priest, which is better then the virgin Mary: Ergo the Pope is better then the Uirgin Marye.
priest is better then the virgin Mary in this poynt, that she bare Christ but once, but the priest euery daye.
could answer this by the like absurditie of yours after this sorte.
You say that a priest can make god: But hée that can make god, is better then god: Ergo the priest is better then god.
But the Pope can make a priest, if the priest who is an inferiour can make god, what can the Pope make who is superiour to a priest? Surely a thing aboue god: doth not the Pope in making of god, exalt him selfe aboue god.
Therfore he is that man of sinne and child of perdition that is spoken of in the second to the Thessalonians. cap.
Hée is the head of the church that can gyue the names of dignitie, and tytles to all Princes, Kinges, and Monarches, and may crowne them: But the Pope can doo this.
proue it thus: What King hath not his tytle gyuen of the Pope? name one if you can.
To bée brief, hée gaue this tytle to the Frenche King to bée Christianissimus most Christian King, and to the King of England to bée Defensor fidei, Defendour of the fayth.
graunt hée did this, but hée chalendged this authoritie falsely, and then hée did as the scripture prophecied, that hée should doo, Exalte himselfe aboue all power.
Hée that curseth, when, and whom hée will, is the head of the church.
But the Pope can both curse and blesse when, and whom hée will.
proue it thus: Was not England cursed by the Pope, and our holy father Iulie the thixde of that name dyd of his meere mercie, gyue one droppe of Christes bloode (reserued at Rome to perdon England withall: or rather of his holynesse and absolute power perdoned Englande.
daye of October? non obstantibus constitutionibus, ordinationibus Apostolicis· caeterisque contrarijs quibuscunque: Notwithstanding the constitutiones and ordinances of the Apostles, or any other whatsoeuer they bée to the contrarie.
Are you not ashamed to take the honour from God, and gyue it to a man? From the Creator, and gyue it to the creature? you saye, that though the Apostles, or any other (in whiche woordes, both God and Christ are conteyned) dyd ordeyne and decrée the contrarie, that the Popes blessing muste preuayle, his iudgement stande, and hée to bée all in all.
Pelagius many yeares agone, ordeyned that the church of Rome had not her authoritie of men or of Synodes, but of christ.
And Gregorie the seuenth, Nicolas the third, were more playne: For they concluded that the Pope was the Supreme head without all controuersie.
aunswere, that by these it is manifest, that it was
yeares after Christ, before that any mencion was made of any supremacie for these twoo first forged supremacie: that which was first, is most probable: but at the first there was no supremacie: Ergo there should bée none.
Hée is the head of the church, that giueth authoritie and licence to all the other Apostles to preache, to bée priestes, and to minister the seuen Sacramentes: But Peter gyueth all these.
Peter Palude is the authour of this argument, a man of great woorship.
Hée is the head of the church, whom the Chayre doothe blesse, although hée were Iudas, or a murtherer.
But the chayre blesseth the Pope: ergo the Pope, if hée were Iudas, or a murtherer, is the head of the church.
Hée that is God, is the head of the church: But the Pope is God, ergo the pope is the head of the church.
The second proposition is proued by the authoritie in the margine.
Hée that is head of Angelles, and Archaungelles, is the head of the church: But the Pope is the head of Aungelles and Archaungelles: Ergo the Pope is the head of the church.
Hée that is aboue the scripture, is the head of the church: But the Pope is aboue the scriptures: ergo the Pope is the head of the church.
Hée is the head of the church, that is the light of the world, which illuminateth euery man, that commeth into the world: But the Pope is that light, which illuminateth euery man, that commeth into the world: Ergo the Pope is the head of the Church? The xxx. Obiection.
He that hath aucthoritie to breake lawes is of more force then he that came not to breake lawes: but the Pope came to breake the lawes and Christ came to fulfyll the lawes and not to breake them: Ergo the Pope is the head of the Church.
If there were nothing to proue the Pope to be head of the churche sauing his apparell and ornamentes, yet surely they might perswade any man too beleue, to maintaine, and to glorifie, our holie father the Pope, dothe not Buechingerus and Inocentius Libro.
special ornamentes: his hose, his shoes, or sandalles, his succynctory or girdell, his Tunicle, his Dalmatica or longe sleued Gowne, his Metre, his Gloues, his Ring, and Staffe.
In these consisteth the speciall power of the Pope, euen to geue orders, to blesse Maides, to consecrate Bishopes, to laye on handes, to make grese or Chrisma, to consecrate clothes and vessales, to call Sinodes, to dedicate Temples, and to depose them that are disgraded, and do many other merytorious workes.
What shall speake of his two horned mitre? of the hemmes of his garment? of his crosse and staffe? of his chimer? and other vestements.
His shoes pardoned venyall sinnes, his staffe hathe many vertues, the crooked horne, fetcheth in them that go astray, the ende knocketh the obstinate, refourmeth the disobedient.
Of his kniues and twoedged Swerds? of his goulden hamer haue spoken before.
answer that theise more comend the Pope and set forth his prayse, then his vertues do: He glorieth in his apparell, Paule in Christ his crosse, he in outward things, Paule in inward, he in pompe, Paule in pouertie, he in vayne glory of the world, Paule in the ioyes of Heauen.
Is not all this apparell corruptible? will it not consume? will not his crowne in tyme weare away and decay? But the immortall crowne which Peter speaketh of, will neuer.
You are not ashamed to put your trust in worldly things, but in scriptures you put no trust, them you cannot abyde: Dooth not Iames Hocstrate in his booke intytuled, Of praying to saints, pronounce him to bée an heretique, that flieth to the scriptures, and that custome ought to bée followed before the scriptures, bycause a common errour maketh a lawe.
We haue hitherto proued our holy father to be the head of the Militant Church here in earth, (though the Lutherians say, that hée is head of the Malignant Church ).
Now will wée proue that hée is the head of the Triumphant Church which is in Heauen.
HE is the head of the Triumphant Church that Canonizeth Sainctes, and hath authoritie ouer Aungels, that maketh of the triumphant church whom he listeth: But the Pope dothe this, Ergo he is the head.
denie the Minor, wée proue it, Let vs sée if you find any day in the yeare dedicated to any Saincte, which the Pope did not dedicate, and consecrate.
Hée made the Apostles dayes: the foure Ladye dayes, made Corpus Christi a Sainct, S. Peters cheynes, S. Graue or S. Sepulchre, S. seuen Sléepers, s. Sonday, s. Grimbold, S. Chrisogon. s. Gorgon, s. Rooke, s. Dunstone, s. Thomas Becket, whom King Henry dyd vnsainte, and disgrade: holy Iohn Shorne, holy King Henry: many a Prelate, Bishop and Pope, and in fine, al his benefactours, for whom he commaundeth euery Priest to pray for in his Canon of the blessed masse, which we trust he will make a Sainct, one day, for surely she is our good Mistres, she prospereth Prelats, exalteth Hermits, aydeth Hunters, purgeth Pigs, helpeth Hogs, causeth raine, and faire weather, deliuereth out of Purgatorie, and directeth generall councelles.
Finally she were as worthy to be a Sainct as any of them all.
aunswere, that the Pope taketh vpon him to doo and saye so.
But thinke you that hée can doo so? Surely hée hath made some saincts that are deuilles, and some that there were neuer none such.
What manner of Sainct is sainct Sondaye? or Rymon, or s. Gyners, or s. Redygons, or s. Apellinare for tootheache: Ualentine for Louers: Loe for Smithes, Crispine, Martine and Chrispinian for Shoemakers, Nicolas, and Cletus for Clarkes, and yit many write ther was neuer none such as Cletus: George for warriers, Andrew for Scotlande, Denis for Fraunce, Iames or Iaques, for Spayn, about Louane Urbane, whom they Crowne and cary about with great pompe to Tauernes, if thei haue plentie of frutes: if no, they spitte vpon him: they reuyle him, throw him into the kennelles.
They painte with Iohn and Bernard the deuill, with George like to ye Egyptians a Crocodile, with Rooke a dogge, with Antony a sowe.
The Hollanders vse Paulyne, as Louanians Urbane, although that there bée no parte in mannes body so honest, vnto the which ye Pope hath not appointed a sainct: and none so vncomely, which hath not his saincte.
Neyther any absurditie that you can name, but they haue a sainct for it: yet say they, the Pope cannot erre, although it is euident that he Canonizeth (as they saye) these Sainctes, booth contrarie to Scriptures, Councelles, and Doctoures.
It is in sainct Paule, that, if God onely iustifyeth, who can condempne? can the Pope? Thus reason, Hée that cannot iustifye a man, hée cannot Canonize.
That the Pope dooth not iustifye, all those places proue, which proue Christ too bée our onely Heade, Redéemer, Iustifyer, and Glorifyer.
To Canonize is to glorifie, to giue felicitie, to make a Sainct of a man, and to introduce him into eternall ioye, and this dooth only Christ.
Ergo not the Pope which Paule proueth by this climax, this gradation, this induction, and sorites.
Whom God hath predestinate, them hée hath called, whom hée hathe called, them hée hath iustified, and whom he hath iustified, them hée hath glorified.
But the Pope can predestinate no man, Ergo neyther iustifye them, then neyther Glorifie them, and per consequens, not Canonize them.
Wée maye woorshippe neyther the Uirgine Marie, neyther the Apostles, neyther any Saincte, neyther make holy dayes, or Temples for them, muche lesse Canonize them, which comprehendeth all these.
Haeresie and Theodorete vpon the second Chapter too the Collossians.
Hée that cannot erre, can Canonize Sainctes: But the Pope cannot erre, Ergo, the Pope can canonize sainctes.

do not bring these Arguments collected out of the popish lawes and wryters, for that they néede any confutacion, but that men may learne with what stuffe and Trumperie they confirme their errours.
No man sinneth that is borne of God: The Pope is borne of God: Ergo the Pope sinneth not The fiist proposition is proued out of the firste of Iohn verse
Euery one that is holy is borne of God: Phe Pope is not only holy, but also most holy.
The second is proued by the Popes bulles which are more to bée credited then the Gospell, for the Pope may interpret the Gospell how he will, but no man may Interprete the Popes Bulles.
wyll proue by a Sillogisme in Barbara, the second proposition.
Euery creature reasonable and mortall is a man: Euery Pope is a reasonable and mortall creature.
The first proposition is proued by the deffinition of a man.
The second proposition is proued by Athanasius Creede where he sayeth that Christ consisteth of a reasonable soule, and a humane flesh.
He that can make God, is better then God: The Pope can make God: Ergo the Pope is better then God.
The Maior is proued by this principle of Lodgike: The cause efficient is better then the effect.
The second proposition is proued by this Silogisme: That which a priest can do, the Pope can do: The priest can make God: Ergo the Pope can make God.
The Maior of this Argument is proued by the same principle of Lodgike that the other former Argument was.
The second proposition is proued by this Argument: He that can make the Sacrament of the Alter can make God: The Priest can make the Sacrament of the Aulter.
The second proposition is proued by daily massing by the words and déedes of many a priest, who will not stick to saye that they haue made him an hundreth tymes and no lesse.
That consequentlie it followeth by these Arguments of the Papists, that the Pope is better then God, and also elder then either God or the world.
He that can remitte sinnes is God: The Pope can remitte sinnes: Ergo the Pope is God.
He that can giue the holy Ghost can remitte sinnes: The Pope can giue the holy Ghost: Ergo the Pope can remitte sinnes.
in the which place it is said, that God giueth the holy Ghost, and as God can giue the holy Ghost so can he remitte sinnes by these words.
The Minor is proued by his orders giuen too priests, where hée sayeth.
He that cannot giue the holy Ghost is not God: The Pope cannot giue the holy Ghost: Ergo the Pope is not God.
No sinner can giue the holy Ghost: The Pope is a sinner.
He that is not of God cannot giue the holy Ghost: No sinner is of God: Ergo no sinner can giue the holy ghost.
Hée that is not of God is of the Deuill.
hée that is of the Deuill, cannot giue the holy ghost.
Ergo hée that is not of God cannot giue the holy ghost.
Hée that can forgiue sinnes is God: The Pope can forgiue sinnes.
The first Proposition is proued by this text of Luke: chapter
Hée can forgiue sinnes whose shoes can forgiue sinnes: The Popes shoes can forgiue sinnes: Ergo hée can forgiue sinnes.
proue the minor by the Cannon Law, wher it is written, that his shoes are of suche authoritie, that if an excomunicated persone kisse them, his sinnes are forgeuen him.
Hée that cannot forgiue sinnes is not God: The Pope cannot forgiue sinnes: Ergo the Pope is not God.
The first Proposition is proued by the former text of Luke chap.
The second Proposition will proue by this Argument Who is conceiued in sinne, and borne in sinne: Cannot forgiue sinne: The Pope is conceiued in sinne, and borne in sinne: Ergo the Pope cannot forgiue sinne.
Hée which can abolish Christes doctrine, and establish his owne is better then Christe: The Pope can abolish Christ Doctrine establish his owne: Ergo the Pope is better then Christe.
The Minor is proued by theise places of the Cannon law.
Hée whose doctrine doth so far passe Christes doctrine, as the kernell the shell, the Sonne, the Moone, and lighte darknes, may abolishe Christs and establishe his owne: But the Popes doctrine doth so far passe Christs as the kernell the shell, the Sonne the Moone, and light darknes: Ergo the Pope may abolishe Christes doctrine.
and by Antilogia and by Chancer in the Romant of the Rose.
Hée that doth abolishe Christes doctrine and establishe his owne, is Antechriste: But the pope abolisheth Christs doctrin establisheth his own Ergo the Pope is Antechrist: therfore not better the~ Christ.
The second proposition is proued by their owne writinges and preachinges, for Friers which are the Popes taile in the yeare of our Lord
preached openly, and made also a booke called Euangelium aeternum or Euangelium spiritus sancti wherin they endeuored to proue that Christ was not God, neither his Gospell Euerlasting: but should only continew
yeares and then theires should take place, wherin was comprehended all superstition, Idolatrie, as praing to saints, Purgatorie, masses, pilgramages &c. Guilielmi de.
and by Antilogia and Chancer in the Romant of the Rose.
Hée that is docter of both the lawes meane ciuill and common is better then hée that is docter of neither: But the Pope is doctor of both, and Christ of neither.
The first proposition is proued by the degrées of bothe his doctorshippes.
The second is proued by the aucthoritie of Baldus in Codice.
Who sayeth that he is doctor of both Lawes in authoritie though not in knowledge.
Some man that is doctor of neither Law is better then the Pope that is doctor of both Lawes: But Christ was some man and doctor of neither Law.
Ergo Christ doctor of neither Lawe, is better than the Pope that is doctor of both Lawes.
He that is lesser then Christe in knowledge, is not so good as Christ.
But the Pope though doctor of both Lawes is lesser then Christ in knowledge.
He that knoweth not all things is lesser then Christe in knowledge.
He that is Iudge both of quick and dead, is either God or as good as God: The Pope is Iudge both of quicke and dead: Ergo the Pope is either God or as good as God.
The assumption is proued in Bernerd Lutzenburge a Fryer of great learning in the Scriptures, and in Extra. qui filij sunt legittimi.
He that is to bée iudged in the laste day, is not the Iudge of the quick and dead: But the Pope is to be iudged in the last day: Ergo he is not the iudge of the quick and dead.
He that can prohibite matrimonie is aboue Christ: The Pope can prohibite matrimonie.
Symperaga, is euident of thother, the Sillogisme is in Darij.
He that prohibiteth Matrimonie is an Infidele and hath the spirite of errour.
The Pope prohibiteth Matrimonie: Ergo the Pope is an Infidele and hath the Spirit of errour, therfore Antechrist.
The Sumption or assumption the Pope affirmeth in his Cannon Law as haue alledged before, and the conclusion is manifest, and the Silogisme is in Darij
That which other men are the Pope is not: Other men are synners: Ergo the Pope is none.
That which other men are the Pope is not: Other men are Christians: Ergo the Pope is none.
THEODORET calleth this departing Antechrist, who shall seduce the world and drawe men from the trueth: Who is the man of sinne which vsurpeth all the aucthoritie of the diuel, and the operation of whom is the childe of perdition bicause hée destroyeth himselfe and others.
He shall sitte in the Temple of God, which is mens myndes, and shall sitte the highest in all assembles, councells, and places, and shew himselfe as a God, and shall call him the God.
Moasim a strong, stoute, and mightie God, some vnderstand this departing too bée when the Romaine Empyre béegan too decaye, in the tyme of the Emperour Heraclius when the Turkes and Saracenes departed from the Romaine Empyre vnto Mahuemite and folowed the superstition, vaneties, and subtyle sect of the great Turke.
Augustinus confesseth his ignoraunce in the vnderstanding of this place, Notwithstanding saieth hée, some meane by Antechrist, the whole bodye of sinne, the whole malygnant Churche, with theyr Captayne Antechrist and so sitte in the Church, as though he were the onely Church, and now ye know, what withholdeth and what is the cause of his delaye, and why that this pestilent membre of Satan doth not apeare, euen the Romain Gmpire letteth, for tyll it béegin to deminishe, he shall not vtter himselfe by the misterie of iniquitie, some vnderstande Nero some Heresies, by him that witholdeth, some vnderstand the Romaine Empire, as Ambrose and others as sayd before: some the grace of God, and the might of his spirit, some gods appointment and decrée, who assigned Antechrists tyme, but Theodoret vnderstandeth it of the Gospell, which must be preached ouer all the world, Christs Religion published euery where, adolatrie vanquished, false doctrine detected, superstition abolished, and then shall Antechrist appeare.
Christ shall subdue this Tyraunt with the rodde and teath of his mouth: Esai.
euen by his woorde and by godly men expert in his Lawe.
The body of sinne is Antechrist, false prophets, and false Christs.
Antechrists kingdome co~sisteth in ambition, domination, arrogancie, false doctrine, fables, visions, reuelations, pardones, and such other abhominations.
The abhomination of desolotion is knowen, by notes of Antechrist, false doctrine, in this host, and that host, and in euery Alter with his naturall bodye: He is knowen by Tyrannye, by all manner of myscheife, he is the man of sinne, for he doth not only sinne himselfe, but also causeth other to sinne.
For the Pope sayeth that if he sel the whole world, he selleth but his owne, or if he cary innumerable sorte of soules to hell with him, there may no man aske him why he doth so.
He is the childe of perdition, and man of sinne, bicause that he is a man in déede, and in mans nature, and taketh vppon him the operation of the deuill: for God elected Christ who in his humain nature should redeme vs, and bring vs to saluation, euen so doth the deuel choose a very man, who should supplant, seduce, peruert, and destroy, calling himselfe Christ and God, and aduouching the~ to be false gods, whome before he reuerenced as true gods.
The Temple of GOD he calleth Christs Church, and congregation, where he will vsurpe the highest seate and place, boasting himselfe for God.
Antechrist shall neither be deuell, nor féende, but a very man, in whome shall dwell whoie Satan bodely.
He sitteth in the Church of God, as God, he shall persecute the godly, chaunge the Lawes of God, and eealt himselfe aboue GOD, and compell all men, all Lawes, all Regions to be subiect to his authoritie.
He shal feigne chastetie, and contynencie, to deceiue men withall.
Gregorye the fyrst of that name, calleth him the forerunner of Antechrist, who taketh vppon him to be an vniuersall priest, bicause in pride and presumption hée preferreth him selfe before others, but this doth the Pope.
Gregorie calleth him Antechrist who sendeth out his preachers to teache that the Sabboth day or Sunday ought not to bée laboured vppon, and to folowe the Iewes in obseruing the rites of the law, and so cause the Sabboth to bée reuerenced: But the Pope doth this: Ergo the Pope is Antechriste.
After that Iohn in his Reuelation had described the firste beaste, whiche was the Romaine Empire, to bée a defacer of Christe, and a persecuter of the Christians: hée inferreth the second beast too come out of the earth, souoring of earthly things: and hauing two hornes as the Lambe of Christ had: the one horne is the worldly kingdome of the Pope, which consisteth in vsurping.
For he called himselfe a king, and not only a king, but also created kings Emperours and deposed them.
For he hath authoritie in heauen and earth, and therfore hath two keys, the one for Heauen gates, the other for hell gates.
Two swordes, the one to subdue the Emperours withall, the other to rule the Clergie.
He and his giue the holy Ghost, and grace, and therefore in auriculer confession, in his pardones, in making of priests.
He speaketh like a Dragon, euen like the deuell, who seduced Adam and made him offend against all the commaundements.
He doth graunt miracles, hée maketh fire too discend from Heauen.
By fyer is vnderstanded the holy Ghost, and the Pope promiseth to giue the holy ghost in giuing of orders, saying, Receiue ye the holy ghost.
Moreouer there is no sinne so horrible, no offence so greuous, which he will not forgiue for money.
By Fyer, may be vnderstand his thundering boult of Cursing and Excommunication, whereby he did strike the Monarches, Princes, and Kings of the earth.
He that will not worshippe the Image of the beast which is the dominion, prerogatiue, and authoritie of the Pope, shalbée murthered by him and his proctors.
The Image of the beast is his aucthoritie, ceremonies, candells, Sacramentes, Hosts, Wafecakes, Housling, Priests, Friers, Nonnes, Monkes, Hermetes, Religious men, Purgatorie, Pardones, Penitentiaries, Curtesanes, Masses, Dirges, Abbotts, Beades, Beaderos, Crosses, Coniurings, holy Bread, holy Water, holy Salte, Palmes, holy Blood of Hayles, prayers for the dead, Limbus patrum, Limbus puerorum praying to Saincts, Superstition, Idolatrie, Images, Idolles, Pilgremages, Rosaries, Ladies Psalters, and Regine coelorum, Aue Maria stella Bulles, Extreame vnction.
will so plainly declare the nature of Antichrist and in such sorte that you shall vnderstande that the Pope muste néedes bée Antichrist.
There were onely six Monarchies from the deluge to the ende of the Worlde.
The first the Assirians the second, the Babylonians or the Chaldes: the thyrd, the Medes or Persians: the fourth the Grecians or Macedonians: the fift, the Romains and Germans: the sixt, is the Pope and the Emperour, which were diuided out of the whole Romayne Empyre, before it was diminished.
Daniel doth not touch the Empire of the Assirians for it was past before his tyme, and this Image was séene at Babilone
What néeded any Prophecie of a thinge that is past.
Neither is there any Prophesie of a thing that is past, but of a thinge too come.
And therefore sayeth Daniel: God shall shevv to the King things to come.
The head of this Image signifyeth the Monarchy of the Chaldes and Babylonians: The siluer breast and armes the Medes or Persians The Belly and Thighes of brasse the Gresians or Macedonians The Legges of Yron were the Romans who subdued al the world: The foote of Yron signifieth the Pope, who breketh the power of the Emperour as yron doth ye clay, for the Pope had all Europe at his commaundement, hée crouned Emperoures, and hee deposed them, he warred against them and subdued them: hée possessed Italy and thrust the Emperour into Germany.
Let vs declare how the Pope, who is signified by the féete of yron, did sub+due the Emperour, who was named by the foote of claye.
Gegory the fyrst Pope of that name in the yeare of Christ
wryteth that it had bin offered diuers tymes that the Pope of Rome myght haue called the vniuersall Byshop, but none of them would take it vpon them, or vse that word and title.
Notwithstanding the same Gregory inuehing against Iohn the Patriarcht of Constantinople who would haue bene called the vniuersall Bishopp, signifieth to the Emperour, Mauritius and to his wife Augusta that Rome should chalenge that honor and Superioritie and that it was iniquitie to depriue the successour of Peter of that honor, considering that it was sayd to Peter, thou art Peter, Et super hanc petram aedificabo Ecclesiam meam
Wherin Gregorie offended duble, first in misunderstanding, or rather peruerting ye place and wordes of Christ, meaning by ye rocke Peter: when as Christ is the rocke, and Peter but a member deriued from the rocke, as of Christ Christians: secondly that hée gaue occasion to his successoures to chalenge and aspire to that superioritie and dignitie.
killed the good Emperour Mauritius with his wife, and children, and at the request of Boniface made the seate of Rome the cheife seate of all churches, and that the Pope of Rome should bée preferred before all others.
And although that Phocas a most damnable Emperour, who killed his Master and Emperoure Mauritius gaue this preminence to the pope of Rome, notwithsta~ding he could not be elected without the assent of the Emperour of Constantinople the Exarch of Italy of the people of Rome.
Emperor of that name, graunted to Benedictus the second Pope of that name, in the yeare of Christ
that the Pope might be elected without the assent of the Emperour of Constantinople or the Exarch of Itly only by the Clergie, and people: And in the yeare of Christ
in a counsell at Mantua where Berengarius was compelled to recant his opinion of the Sacrament, it was decréed that the Pope should bée only elected of the Cardinalles without assent of any others, now began the Popes to do all, to rule all, compell all Emperoures, Kinges, and Princes, to their orders, and to bée subiect to them.
who had caused al maner of Images to be pulled downe, and burned, and them that would not do it, to suffer death.
This Gregory resisted: this excommunicated Leo this caused the Images to be more worshipped then euer they were.
caused the King of Fraunce called Chilpericus to be made a Monke, and placed one Pipin by the meanes of the nobles of Fraunce, and made him king, who enriched the Pope.
Thus Zacherias the Pope, with his successor Stephen the second Pope of that name, dyd pardon and absolue Pipinus with the rest of the nobilitie of Fraunce of their othe obedie~ce which they ought to ye king Chilpericus lately deposed.
This Stephen did first ordain that he his successors shold be born of mens shoulders.
Carolus magnus succeded his sonne Pipinus in the yeare of Christ
was created crouned Emperour by Leo the third Pope of that name.
Ludouicus succeded his Father Carolus in the empire of the west, enriched the pope Paschalis his successors exceadingly.
For he with his grandfather Pipinus his father Carolus gaue to the Popes aboue
Ylands, Countries, Cities, shires, Towns, dominions prouinces, which are repeted in Campanus others.
Otho magnus the Emperour of the Germains in the yere of Christ
gaue all these that his predecessors had giuen to the pope for his soules health, for his sonnes soule, for his forefathers souls.
After this time the pope toke vpon him al world+ly dominion power, also of heaue~, hell, purgatory.
The pope may iudge all, none the Pope: Neither may any man dispute of his doings
What if the Pope shold corrupt many by his example? Pope Boniface answereth this dist.
If the Pope shall cary innumerable people by companies with him into hell, there to be plagued for euer, no man may reproue him: bycause that hée that iudgeth all, may be iudged of no man.
After Pipinus Carolus the first Emperour of thatname, the Pope ruled al, crowned Emperours, deposed them at his pleasure.
(which Iohn was killed taken in adultrie) gaue this othe to Otho the first Emperour of the Germains, Dest.
To the my Lord Iohn Pope, King Otho do promise thée and swere by the Father, and the and the holy Ghost, and the trée of the liuely crosse, and by the reliquesof saints, that if shal come to Rome wil exalt the Romish church hir gouerner
Clericus In the time of Otho the third Emperour of the Germains, it was decréed by perlement that none of the stock line of the Romans, should euer bée Emperour, but on+ly some of the Germains.
And therfore Gregory a Saxon the first Pope of that name, graunted that the Emperour should be elected by electors, which were the Duke of Saxony, County Palatine, Marchio Brandeburgensis: the bishop of Mense, Colonie Treuers the King of Boemia, as Arbiter, in the yere of Christe
Here may you sée how that out of the Romain Empire, ye Garmains Empire the Popes are deriued The Pope had the whole in effect the Emperours were but at the Popes plesure.
For the Pope had the marow the Emperour the bones, the Pope the corn, the Emperour the chaff: the Pope was the Sun, the Emperor the Moone, who taketh his light might of the Pope.
The Pope had Italy, Sardinia, Sicilia, Naples in a maner al.
Wher it is in Daniel that they shalbe ioyned togither by mans séede, it is meaned that they shalbée as it were both one, but they shal not be otherwise ioyned the~ yron can be with clay.
By mans séede is meant that vnfaithful knot of amity which was, is betwéen the Emperour the Pope, which was oftentimes, but mere dissimulatio~.
For wée sée that the Emperors were compelled for feare to obay the Pope, as in treading of the Henries and Fredericks with Ludouique others.
Innocentius take truce with Frederike the ij. euer brake their promis.
This was Humanum semen and the Popes Empire, as said before, which rose out of the Romain empire, began then to be reuiled made manifest when he toke vppon him to make Emperours depose them at his pleasure.
Notwithstanding he wrought secretly before in al the Popes in a maner.
And that the Pope is Antechrist Paul proueth, bycause he sitteth in the Temple of God, taketh vpon him to serch mens consiencis for ye purpose he made auriculer co~fession, to know euery mans thought.
And therfore Boniface brought out two swods, on a solemne feast day in the yere of Christ
wherby it is manifest that ye pope is head both of ye spiritual te~poral sword, dominion.
The temple wherin this knaue ye pope sitteth reigneth, is ye hole me~ber of the~ yt beare ye name of christia~s though they be ye church of Anti. who~ he gouerneth, ruleth for to sit in this place, is to rule.
Wherefore here you sée that the Pope doth inuade the kingdome of Christe, as Christe prophecied.
They sayeth hée, meaning the Popes, shall come in my name, and saye, am Christ.
How can Paul call the Church of Christ, the church of Antichrist? How can the Temple of God be called the Temple of Antichrist: If the Pope had called this Temple, the Temple of Antichrist: all men would haue abhorred him.
But Paule calleth it, as the Pope doth, the Temple of God, declaring that the Pope would call his Sinogoge and malignant church by a glorius name, to delude ye people, as he calleth his doctrine Eua~geliu~ Sempiternum et Euangelius speritus sancti.
And the Sadduces cal the~ selues rightuous men, notwithsta~ding they were most vnrightuous.
And the Popes so altre theyr names to deceue the people, for if he were Impius they called him Pius: If nocent, Innocentius: If a malefactor, Boniface: If vnmercifull, Clement: and thus they called vice vertue, and twined blacke into whyte.
In like maner now the Ievves call themselues the people of God, who are not his people.
The Pope vsurpeth that name, as he doth in calling himselfe Christes vice gerate, and that his priestes in confession sit in gods sceate.
It may be obiected that Mahumet is Antechrist, whose story and lyfe haue noted vpon Daniel.
answer that he sitteth in that Temple that calleth it the Temple of God, but denieth Christe, neither doth hée secretly or openly call Christ his God, but onely a prophet: Neither commeth he out of the Romain Empire, but rose onely of himselfe: neither sitteth he at Rome.
But the Pope seacretly calleth himselfe, in that he presumeth to forgiue sinne, ergo the Pope.
No man can forgiue sinne but God only: the Pope presumeth to forguiue sinne, ergo the Pope is he that sitteth in the Temple of God, boasting himselfe, and triumphe aboue all that is God, The Turke began in Arabia: the Pope at Rome
The Pope is a false Christ, that is such one as that bosteth himselfe to haue the same authoritie that Christ had when he was in earth, that faineth himselfe to do all that Christe can do, and more, as to make of iniury, iustice, of nothing, something, to restore a defamed man to his name agayne, and such other thinges like vntoo these.
Neither is euery euill Christian Antechrist, but hée onely is Antichrist that fayneth himself to do all that christ can doo, to bée his vicegerent in earth, to sit in his place.
As of late ther was one that fayned himself king Edward said that he was so, who was a false knaue.
Neither is the Turk that Antichrist that vsurpeth all that is God: but worshipped of the Turkes as a Sainte: as of late men did worship the Uirgin Mary and other Saintes.
Neycan the Iewes or Turkes be false christes or Antichristes when they doo not feigne them selues to worship Christ as the sonne of God, he that refuseth Christ, cannot, nor wil not receiue a feinned Christ.
Neither is he Antichrist, or a false christ that is an enimy of christ.
But he that vsurpeth the power of christ, that maketh himselfe equal with christ, or aboue him in some points, and notwithstanding would seme to be a christian in words, though he deny him in déedes.
Is not hée a false christ, a faigned christ, a pseudo christ, that would séeme to defend christ outwardly, and yit peruerteth all his lawes, detracteth them to serue his fantasy, abrogateth which hée likech not, and maketh new of his own, and dispenseth with the law of nature, with Peter, Paul, Christ and his gospell? The Pope holdeth some part of euery Heretique that hath bin since the world began.
WIth satan the subtile serpent he perswadeth Eue to eat of the fruit forbidden.
mean he compelleth his church to eat the raw flesh and carnall body, bones and soule of Christ in the sacrament, which is forbidden: to receiue his pardons, bulles, decrées and constitucions.
With the Adamians they denied and condemed mariages in priests, this did Leo the
Iohn Til. With the Adamites they vse women and curtesans in common, which is declared by their stuehouses, which are lawfull for all men.
For the diuines of Louane defend them as good, lawfull, and necessary.
For priesthode is polluted with matrimony, but not with harlots.
It is lesser euill to go on whorehunting, then to marry.
vt habetur in c. si concubina de sent. excom. et grat.
d. dicentes, homini Christiano qui non habet vxorem, loco vxoris liceat habere co~cubinam
christian man that hath not a wife, it is lawful for him to haue a concubine.
Neither, say they do priests and Monkes abiure or forsweare incontinencie, but mariage.
Sixtus the fourth pope of that name builded stuehouses of both the kindes in the yere of Christ
Paul the third pope of that name had registred fiue and forty thousand whores that payed euery moneth a pension or tribute to the pope, which did rise yerely to fortie thousand ducates.
Si pudor in villas, si non patiantur easdem Et villae vomicas, vrbs est iam tota lupanar.
With the Ophites, who sayd that the serpent, which supplan+ted Eue, inuented the knowledge of good and euill.
With Iudas that betrayed Christ, whom their adherents worship bicause that Iudas did wel in betraying Christ, or els we could not haue bin saued: no more say the papists we could be saued without the crosse, and therfore we wor+ship it and make it a saint, and dedicate a day to it, and worship it with the adoration of latria, lutz. cortes. in lib.
Th. aqui. With the Pharisies, who seperated themselues in apparell, and religion from others.
And they obserued the Sabboth day supersticiously, as the papists do S. Sonday.
They gaue leaue to a man to put away his wife for any cause, and the Pope likewise for money will dispense, and allegeth at the least twelue causes, and Iohannes de turre creuata many mo.
They gaue to the temple rather then too their parents, and so do the Papists.
The Saduces denied the immortalitie of the soule, and so did Pope Leo the tenth of that name, and the life to come.
The Saduces sayd that it was in our owne wil to do wel or euil: the papists that it cannot bée proued by scripture that a man néedeth the grace of God to do good.
The Esses, Manaches, Abelonians, and Agapetes, refuse ma+riage, and to bée saued by their owne woorks, so do the Popes.
so were the most part of the Popes to their Emperours.
Simon Magus was a coniurer, and a nicromancer: so was Siluester the second.
&c. Simon sold the holy ghost: these the holy ghost, Christ, Heauen, Hell, Purgatory.
Templa, sacerdotis, altara, sacra, coronae, Ignis, thura, preces, Coelum est venale deus{que}.
The Ebionites deny that Christ was before the virgin Ma+rie, the Papists do the like, for they say that there were none saued, no not Adam, as did the Tatians, but that all went to hell till Christ came and haried hell.
Thomas, Iohn de tur. &c. The Nicolaites would haue mens wiues, and adultery and fornication to be a thing indifferent: so do the popes, who say that single fornication is no sinne, and licet habere feminam semel in mense ad expurgandas renes, si non caste tamen caute and too bée diuinum opus, Ioh. a casa cardinal.
The Gnostiques had images of Homer, of Plato, of Aristotle, of Pythagoras and such others, of Paul, and Marcellina, and placed these images besides Christs image, and worshipped them: and do not the papists worship the images of Christ, Mary Iohn, cense them, kisse them, reuerence them, offer to them, knéele to them, say the Lordes prayer, enioyned by their ghostly fathers, which haue séene and done.
With the Tatians they say that matrimonie is as euill as whoredom.
Marcus and Psichicus a folower of Ualentinus, tooke vpon him to forgiue sinnes, to giue grace and the holy ghost: and dooth not the Pope the same? The Montanistes and Pristilians gaue libertie for men to forsake their wiues: and so do the Popes.
They say with that chastitie filleth heauen, and mariage hell.
They hold with the Audeans and Anthropomorphites, that God is of like shape with men: and doo not the Papists paint the father an old man with a long white beard, and the holy ghost like a Doue. The Donatistes said that the Church was no where but in Afrike, the Papists at Rome, and onely there where the Pope ruleth.
They defend frée will with the Donatists, Pelagians, and Anabaptists.
With the Collyridians they woorship the virgin Mary, they offer to hir, they call hir the quéene of heauen.
They say with Montanus, Apelles, and Cataphriges, that Christ ascended without a body: for they say that he is inclosed in a litle round cake inuisibly, and with Montanus they appoint fasting dayes.
Seuerus sayd that a woman was the woork of the diuell, and the vpper part of man of God, but from the nauell down of satan: and therefore they that mary to fulfill the workes of the deuil.
aduouched the lyke saying, that they that were maried could not please God.
Marcellus the Bishop of Ancira affirmed that the kingdome of Christ should haue an ende.
that Christes Gospell should then haue an end, and the Popes should take place called sempiternum Euangelium and Christes they compared to the shell, theirs to the kernel, theirs to the sun, Christs to the moone, theirs to light, Christs to darknes.
With the Donatistes and circumcellions they burn bookes, yea they burne sacred Bibles and persecute the readers thereof with fier and sweard.
The Pope like Gensericus, Honorius and Transmundus being Arians and Kings of the Vandales persecuted the Christians.
The Church of Christe neuer persecuteth but is persecuted, the Popes church persecuteth, and was neuer persecuted, Ergo it is not the church of Christ.
Hillary With Seuerus bishop of Antioch he curseth al his aduersares.
With Anastasius the Emperour hée worshippeth a Quaternitie the father, the sonne, and the holy ghost, and Christes bodie in the Sacrament.
Iohn of Constantinople desiring to bée called the vniuersall Bishop is condemned for an heretique, what then shall we cal the Pope who will not only to be called the vniuersall Bishop, but also will be the head of the milittant and triumphant church, to haue rule in heauen ouer the Aungels and archaungels, in hel ouer the damned soules, and ouer the sely soules in purgatory.
Many of of ye Popes were murtherers, ruffians, desperates, coniurers, necromancers, warriers, perricides, blasphemers, Atheistes, Antichristes, &c. Fredericus Imperator Innocentio Papae.

my lord

the severall concurrent attempts which were made of late upon the setled doctrine and discipline of our church begot jealous conceits in mee that either our religion had been hitherto erroneous or was likely to prove unsure for the future
some blame me thought was due either to former times that they had not beene wise in receding from rome so far as they had done or to the present for not being sincere in returning

so fast back againe
to excuse both secure in points of so great concernment and tendernesse of conscience would not permit and to be rash in my censure without search and diligent study seemed unjust and unchristian wherefore that might purchase to my selfe being thus perplexed just and fayre satisfaction and exricate my selfe out of the mischieves of stupidity and temerity both did seriously addict my selfe notwithstanding the dissuasions of my owne particular profession interest and want of debate ventilate and examine the novelties of the time
and verily as to my selfe my indeavours were not long successesse for did at last perceive that there was more danger in our innovators then depth in our innovations and as to some others not injudicious found them concurring with mee in opinion and incouraging mee withall to make my observations more publick
my lord know none more desirous to diffuse good then your honour nor scarce any better meane whereby to diffuse it to others then your wherefore beseech this as an addition to former favours that may honoured name whereby to make more acceptable to all good men thesepoore indeavours of

the altar dispvte or discovrse concerning the severall innovations of the altar
of altars

a great faction of has of late yeares by many severall innovations attempted to alter our religion and to new reforme that reformation of it which was begunne by edw
and further matured by queene eliz
the pretence was that our ancestors in the reformation did depart too farre from popery out of favour to puritanicall calvin and so the designe was to have brought in popery againe but with a muzzle upon it at first as sir ben
ruddlard sayes which muzzell would soone have falne off

or beene taken off as is generally conceived amongst other innovations much care was had of altars many bookes were printed and set forth by authority in favour of them but no man was suffered to say do or write any thing in answer or prejudice thereof
the times are now a little more propitious and that audaciates me beyond my learning or profession to enterprise at this time something for the better clearing of the truth in this case concerning altars
if faile not for want of learning and judgement shall not for want of ingenuity and modesty and wish that our altar had not beene so scurrilous and bitter as they have beene for it seemes to me that the venemous raylings and distempers of men within sacred orders when they are treating of matters of religion cast a great disgrace upon the age we are borne in the countrey we are bred in the religion we are baptized in
in this foure things come into question

concerning the reality of altars
concerning the propriety of the names
concerning the altar posture
concerning the sanctity of the altar or its due adoration

chap
concerning the reality of altars

as for the maintaining of reall and proper altars doctor heylin layes these grounds
hee sayes that the passion of our saviour as it was

prefigured to the jewes in the legall sacrifice a parte ante so by christs institution it is to be commemorated by us christians in the holy supper a parte post
a sacrifice it was in figure a sacrifice in fact and so by consequence a sacrifice in the commemoration or upon the post fact
he sayes further that if a sacrifice be there must also be both priest and altar
yet he assignes these differences that the former sacrifices were bloody as this is not that the former priests were from aaron ours from melehisedeck that the former altars were for mosaicall ours for evangelicall sacrifices

to shew the weaknesse of these grounds we answer that the word sacrifice taken in a generall sense for any sacred office or divine service performed does not inferre any propriety of either priest or altar and if we take sacrifice in that serise as the patriarchs jewes or heathens did or as papists now doe we grant priests and altars are necessarily implied thereby but such a sacrifice we deny our communion to be
tis true the passion of our saviour was prefigured in sacrifices a parte ante but very darkly and if cain abel noah or aaron did sacrifice to foresignifie the death of christ yet their maine or their meere end was not to make any such type or figure

sacrifices were from the beginning as well before aaron as after but the knowledg of our saviors death was obscure under aaron but much more before the most knowing times under the law did not expect such a suffering dying redeemer as god had ordained much lesse did those more cloudy times before the law
the rock in the wildernes the manna and divers other things were typicall yet no sacrifices and sacrifices may as well be not typicall and euen

those sacrifices which are typicall are not typicall qua sacrifices more then types are sacrifices qua types
by the very light of nature all nations did agree in all ages in presenting their god both with free in testimony of his goodnesse and with expiatory sacrifices in testimony of their owne finfulnesse
howsoever all such oblations whether expiatory or gratulatory were equally sacrifices though not equally typicall for all expiatory sacrifices were not bloody onely nor all gratulatory unbloody

we read of cain and abel before the institution of aarons order that the one presented to god his homage in part of his flocke the other in part of his graine the one did sacrifice upon an altar as well as the other and that sacrifice which was unbloody was typicall and expiatory as well as that which was bloody and that which was bloody might be graulatory as well as that which was unbloody or at least nothing appeares to the contrary

we read also of noah that he had a distinct notice of cleane and uncleane creatures and did sacrifice accordingly so that the religion and priesthood before the law was not so farre different from that under the law though pompe and ceremonies and some other accidentall parts were wanting as from ours under the gospel or at least in matters of sacrifice it was little or not at all different
all sacrifices also under the mosaicall law were not bloody for incense was offered to god as well as flesh and there was an altar for odours as well as for blood and all sacrifices whatsoever received their value and acceptation from the passion of christ as that did purifie them not as they did typifie that

for it seemes else that other divine services should not be so valuable and acceptable as sacrifices not those sacrifices which were lesse typicall as those which were more and that no sacrifices at all had beene admitted of by god from such men as did not understand their typicall nature as few did either before or under the law
besides it does not appeare that the passion of christ was a proper reall sacrifice in fact and therefore it was necessary that it should be prefigured yet no necessity is that it should be prefigured by sacrifice a parte ante or commemorated by sacrifice a parte post
the death of our saviour was rather a pious passion then a divine action or service done to god and though our saviour did not resist or shunne such a martyrdome wickedly inforced by other yet he was not so active in it as to imbrue his owne hands in his owne blood
so that if our saviours passion was a sacrifice it was but a figurative improper mentall sacrifice in as much as the meritorious sanctity thereof did not consist in the act done but in the innocence patience and excellence of the party suffering
we cannot more properly call the death of christ a sacrifice then we may the crosse the altar or god the priest and we cannot properly say that god did sacrifice to himselfe upon an altar of that forme and matter
it is a very lame inference therefore that sacrifice must now be to commemorate christs passion past because it was prefigured by sacrifice being yet to come and because it was it selfe a proper sacrifice in the act doctor heylin sayes once that christ did not deprive us of all manner of sacrifices but onely those which had beene before which might if continued have beene a strong presumption of his not comming in the flesh

this seemes a weake reason for if our saviours passion were a proper sacrifice it was a bloody one and if there be the same reason of representing it past as there was future by sacrifice then bloody sacrifices are no lesse proper now to represent it then they were before and if so why were former sacrifices abolished at all surely the best reason why jewish sacrifices were abolished is because those services were but shadowes of that body which in our sacrament is really presented and exhibited
if we doe acknowledge that the body of our saviour is otherwise present in our sacrament then it was in the jewish types we must acknowledge that the shadowes of that body are the lesse needfull for gianting that jewish sacrifices and ours differ not in nature but in circumstance as their signifie a thing future ours past doe not see but that our sacrament is as meere a shadow as their sacrifice was and that beasts now slaine might as well commemorate our saviours death past as they did prefigure it to come
the doctor sayes that the jewish sacrifices were bloody ours not that the jewish priests were from aaron ours from melchisedeck and these he puts as substantiall differences tomake our sacrament no jewish sacrifice
but these differences are not sufficient for his purpose because we know that all jewish sacrifices were not bloody nor does the order of melchisedeck hinder from bloody sacrifices for if melchisedeck did sacrifice as it is most probable that he did it is as probable that his sacrifices were not all unbloody

so then his other difference also is as fond when he sayes that our altars are for evangelicall not mosaicall offerings in as much as betwixt evangelicall and mosaicall offerings he has not yet proved

any other difference but nominall or circumstantiall onely of the like reason and weight are the rest of the doctors inferences for as he has proved yet no true proper sacrifice so much lesse has hee proved any necessity of either priest or altar in a sense
we may grant sacrifice yet deny both priest and altar for we read that the passeover was called the lords sacrifice yet we know it was not killed only by priests nor eaten upon an altar though it was the most honourable of jewish sacrifices and most neerely relating to the passion of christ
so also the passion it selfe of christ if it was a proper sacrifice yet it was offered up upon a woodden crosse not a stone altar and the sacrificer thereof was not a priest wherefore we see plainely that all the doctors allegations hitherto are frivolous and altogether insufficient

we come now from the old to the new testament and here doctor pocklington and master meade lay hold of these words of our saviour
leave thy gift at the altar and ge and reconcile thy selfe to thy brother
these words were spoken by our saviour whilst the altar was in use and before the communion was instituted and may more properly be interpreted of such an altar as men did repaire to with gifts and offerings then to our tables where we come rather to receive then give yet our divines now cite them to patronise the word altar
it would little advance the reality of altars that they had beene so named once by our saviour but here so much as the name used is not cleerely proved
doctor heylin for his next evidence cites cor
doe this in remembrance of me
as often as yee eate this bread and drinke this cup yee shew forth the lords death till be come
here is sayes doctor

heylin a sacrifice whose nature is commemorative here is in this sacrifice an hoe facite for priests different from the hoc edite bibite of and so here is proofe both for sacrifice and priest by this proofe it seemes that the life of the sacrament consists in this that it is a sacrifice and that the life of the sacrifice consists in this that the priest consecrates it not that the people of god celebrate it but take this as a strange glosse of the doctors not agreeable to common understanding or naturall to the text or savouring of protestantisme and so leave it as not worth an answer
he cites further
heb habemus altare and so he concludes that saint paul furnishes us both with priest sacrifice and altar if saint paul did here by altar meane the table here is some authority for the name not thing but this is it selfe controverted for first it is plaine that the word altar is taken for the epulum not the thing upon which it was offered for of this altar it is said that they may not eat which serve at the tabernacle
secondly the papists do not alwayes here by altar interpret our communion table and therefore sayes bellarmine non urgeo hune loeum quia non desunt ex catholicis qui interpretantur de cruce vel de christo ipso
but sayes the doctor am not the first of the church of england that so interpret it for bishop andrews has it thus the altar in the old testament is called mensa domini by malachy and of the holy table the apostle in
heb sayes habemus altare
the lev
minister here rightly answers that the apostle here cals the table altar no otherwise then as malachy cals the altar table and that must needs be improperly for the jewish altar was not a proper table more then the table whereon the stood was an altar

it is certaine and plaine that the syriack word luke
and the hebrew in saint matthew is table and not altar
and saint paul heb
useth the word mensa and the word undefined span alphabet is frequent and not denyed to be proper but the word undefined span alphabet is seldome used for the table and not properly at all if we doe grant it at all used for table as is questioned
and therefore bellar gives a reason why the apostles all their time used no other word then table especially not altar to which opinion the bishop of durham agrees though not to the reason of it
and we know also that the romish pictures present christ and his disciples in their churches communicating alwayes at a table not at an altar

we come now to the practise of the antients and they as doctor heylin sayes without scruple or opposition used the words priest sacrifice and altar not tying themselves only to those words but not shunning the use of them but the truth is the greek fathers used the word table more frequently the latin lesse but both greek and latins used the word table more frequently then altar
but upon the reformation begunne by luther both words beganne to be examined and then the protestants not allowing the sacrament to be a sacrifice rejected altar as improper but the papists though they pretend not to disallow the word table yet in their reformed canon of the masse they used not at all the word table and yet still in the roman pontificall we finde the word table used
howsoever the dispute being not about the meere use but sense of the word altar we come now to other arguments

all metaphors sayes doctor heylin allude to something which has reall existence in nature and

therefore the fathers in the word altar did allude to something existent
answer metaphors must have some basis to support them but that basis may be any thing past or incorporeall christ may bee called the brazen serpent the sting of conscience may be called ixions wheele yet there is no such thing now as the one nor ever was as the other but sayes doctor pocklington those altars which bore carpets corporals could not be meer notionall metaphoricall altars but such were those of the antients ergo
answer the same thing might be a notionall altar yet a materiall table and as it was a materiall table it might support carpets
that cursed tree whereon our saviour suffered was a metaphoricall altar yet it did not truly beare our saviour as an altar but as a crosse but sayes the same doctor againe these altars were such as were frequented for oblations sakes to which none came without sacrifices of wealth as well as of prayse
answer for presents and almes tables are as proper as altars and such being but metaphoricall sacrifices prove the table to be the rather a metaphoricall altar but sayes doctor heylin some sacrifices are meerely spirituall and to such no materiall altar is requisite for such the heart is a sufficient altar and every man is a sufficient priest but the sacrament is a sacrifice not onely spirituall and mysticall but also externall and visible and to such a sacrifice a visible priest and materiall altar is requisite
this is answered already in the paschall lam for that was a sacrifice visible and externall yet it required no materiall altar and so it may be said of our saviours crucified body besides we may make a difference with saint august
betweene the sacrament it selfe and that

which is visible in the sacrament and so deny any visible altar to be necessary and for further instance man is said to offer up his soule and body to god as a reasonable sacrifice and the body being materiall does not require any materiall grosse altar but sayes heylin if the sacrament be but an improper metaphoricall sacrifice then no more a materiall table then a materiall altar is requisite
answer though in that exception of a sacrifice it be metaphoricall yet as a communion it is a reall action and requires a reall table whence to communicate
so the passion of our savior it was a tropical sacrifice but a proper execution and therfore though our saviour was sacrificed without a proper altar yet he was not executed but upon a proper crosse but sayes the same doctor if the sacrament be an improper immateriall sacrifice it may not onely be celebrated without a table but without a church also any place may serve for such a sacrifice the pulpit the pewe the belfrie the chancell may bee as proper altars as the holy table and what a prophane doctrine is this we doe say that any place may be as properly called an altar but not that any place may be as fitly and honourably imployed to communicate in
our saviour did communicate in a common roome upon a common table for necessities sake and so we in case of necessity dare not despise such communicating but we use not this example to prove a parity of all places the doctor knowes this is but a slanderous consequent issuing out of his malice not out of our tenet for if the honour of the sacrament doe not wholly consist in being a sacrifice or the honour of sacrifice in the externall worke done there is no more necessity of altar then table or that either altar or table

should be held so essentially honourable to the sacrament and this may be held by him which holds not all places equall and indifferent for divine services
wherefore as for saint cyprians rule eucharistia in altari consecratur which doctor pocklington affirmes to be undenyable we say it must stand with our saviours example who did administer the eucharist upon a reall table but upon an imaginary altar and so we are not opposed to it but sayes doctor heylin further materiall altars are very antient in the church which if they were not erected for our sacrifices certainely they were for popish and this will prove popery to be very antient answer the doctor has not proved formall stone altars so antient but if he had he has not proved antiquity free from all error and superstition but we can easily prove the contrary but doctor heylin proceeds thus he which teaches that in the primitive church there was neither priest sacrifice nor altar properly so called brings in confusion and ruine into the church takes away all externall worship inables every man to the priestly function and robs the church of all due reverence
this is a strange inference that cannot sufficiently honour the sacrament but under the name of sacrifice nor ministers but under the name of priests nor the but under the name of altar
heylins supposition herein of me must bee more weighty then my own certain knowledge of my self
doctor pocklington also concurres herein for hee which denyes altars sayes hee may as well deny churches and he which denyes churches may as well deny the throne of bishops in the quire neere the altar and he which denyes thrones denyes the truth of christian religion by a strange

dismembred deformed kinde of argumentation he makes altars as necessary to be beleeved as thrones of bishops and thrones as the succession of bishops and the succession of bishops as the rocke and foundation of all religion
cartwright ames and those of geneva and all other countreys which cannot derive their lineall succession of bishops from the apostles are puritanes and heretiques though they scarce differ from us in any other point of consequence yet in this they are in worse condition then the papists
the anchor of our salvation is that my lord of canterbury is lineally descended from saint peter for no inthronization of bishops no personall succession and no personall succession no derivation of faith can be from god to
were not this written against puritans or by such as have an authority to prove quidlibet ex quolibet it would deserve laughter and not an answer but now we must be more serious
the allegation is that there is the same evidence for altars as thrones aud therefore since it is most impious to deny thrones it is the like to deny altars
wish thrones had beene better proved for if thrones doe prove altars yet men of such ordinary faiths as mine may something scruple thrones themselves
saint aug sayes that thrones were remaining at rome and jerusalem till his dayes from the very apostles times
saint augustin might see thrones standing in both places but when they were first raised or by whom or for whom or for what reason he could not understand but by relation and what that relation might be he has not exprest neither doe thinke that his maine hope of salvation was chained to that relation neither can chaine mine to the same for my part am so farre from making

thrones or altars my soules anchorage that beleeve neither to be apostolicall and till the doctor can better convince me of them could wish hee would call in his anathemaes or rather epigrams against such atheists as am but sayes doctor pocklington further no altar no priest no priest no rubrick but we say in answer first that the relation betweene priest and altar is not inseparable as has beene proved
secondly that the word priest derived from undefined span alphabet implyes not reall sacrifice
thirdly if we did reject the word priest utterly as lesse proper then minister and lesse fit to be used as sir francis bacon maintaines and as we doe not affect to use it yet we reject not the thing with the name the same ministry the same sacred order we retaine and honour and hold it as revenerd as either jew or papist doe their sacrificing
but what consequence is this no priest no ordination no ordination no rubrick no rubrick no law
he which opposes the word priest onely does not oppose the thing and he which opposes not the thing opposes not the rubrick and he which opposes not the rubrick opposes not the parl establishing it it is sufficient that we oppose neither the thing priest nor the word except onely in its popish sense as it intimates reall sacrifice to us

come now to such proofes as cleere antiquity from meaning of reall proper altars
and first wee read the word altar sometines in the workes of antient authors but that is no proofe that altar was the common terme or word so used in common speech of that there is no proofe or colour at all it is ordinary to use metaphors in studied discourses and as unusuall to use them in our ordinary language

that the word table was first in common use at the beginning is very credible that it is now wholly disused amongst papists is evident therefore when we see the change but cannot perceive the certaine time or motion of that change as it happens in the shadow upon the we may well suppose that the mystery of inquity has had its secret operation upon it as upon divers other things
we finde secondly in the most antient times that it was a common objection made against christians by jewes pagans and renegado christians that they had neither churches altars nor images
and to this common objection we finde that the greatest apologetick and most learned divines of those dayes did all unanimously yeeld that they had no materiall proper altars nor no other but metaphoricall onely
clesus objected to origen that the christians did avoid to raise undefined span alphabet
caecilius askes octavius cur nullas aras habent templa nulla nulla nota simulacra arnobius sayes to his adversaries nos accusatis quod nec templa habeamus nec imagines nec aras
and julian who had beene a christian and knew their worship well enough and lived after the erection of churches yet sayes to cyrill offerre in altars sacrificare cavetis twas strange if any christian altars then were that neither heathens nor apostate christians should know thereof and yet the more sange that this being objected against christians and not being true that christians would not justifie themselves against so manifest an untruth
origen answers that the christians altar was his understanding and that prayers were his undefined span alphabet
octavius answers that the church sacrifice was bonus animus sincera mens pura conscientia
arnobius

confesses sacrifices but not corporeall agreeing with the former that they were mentall only
and cyrill gives not a deny all to julian
is it not to be wondred at that so many men of severall places and times should all so farre prevaricate and make such fond answers if they could have advantaged their owne cause or satisfied their adversaries by affirming proper altars and such reall sacrifices as our doctors now affirme how easie had it beene and how true how necessary was it to have made this direct answer persecution suffers not christians to build such sumptuous churches and altars as you doe but we have altars as proper and would build temples as stately as you doe if we had power and liberty we deny not al sacrifices as you erroneously object we deny not true visible externall sacrifices we deny only jewish bloody and meerly corporeall sacrifices so that the force of that objectio is against our hard condition not against our worship or religion
but mr mede sayes that these apologeticall divines denyed altars under the heathen name undefined span alphabet not denying the church word undefined span alphabet whereby he accounts them meere cheaters and triflers not regarding whom they treated withall or the current sense of the words according to common acception but desiring to obscure truth and deinde their opponents this is to bee slighted as a toy
pocklington takes pains to prove churches out of the scripture antiquity sayes that those churches had altars to which none came without oblations and that with those oblations captives widowes orphans were relieved
he also insists upon the great names of thrones and syndos but his proofes are most of them indefinite both to time place and thing
we say that before constantine few churches

were especially so formally built with thrones and other divisions as he seemes to intimate and in respect of the vast surface of the earth scarce visible or considerable especially to severall men living in severall places and at severall times such as the apologeticks were
and yet the word church is taken sometimes for any place where god was publikely worshipt and sometimes for the congregation it selfe of the faithfull named by such a towne city or country and in this sense and no other the church of rome is said to maintaine in it
bishop
priests
deacons

acolythites exorcists readers porters
widowes
poore
it is not meant that any locall materiall church in rome during the times of persecution was so rich capacious or stately for this would evince more then a meere toleration of christianity and yet we read not of so much
hospinian for the ace betwixt christ and constantine more reasonably collects that those altars which were then were neither fixed nor of stone which sufficiently cleeres that they were woodden unfixed tables not stone and fixed altars for if christians during heathenisme had liberty to build and meete in such formall churches and had such synods thrones libraries schooles gazophylacies as the doctor labours to prove they could not want power or opportunity to adorne or inrich altars or to fix them and fashion them as they pleased
and thus the ages before constantine might be defective in discipline by reason of persecution and we may suspect the ages after for their superstition
constantine was too pompous in discipline and soone inclined to arianisme and long deferred his owne baptisme in his times the foundations

of popish usurpation beganne to be laid
then it was said hodie venenum infusum est ecclesiae then it was said that there were as many religions as opinions and opinions as men
ascribe not to antiquity such infallibility as some do and yet many things might fit those times which fit not ours and many things may be misreported misunderstood and mistaken by us in these times wch perhaps were not in such repute of old as we now beleeve
our third reason against materiall and proper altars is grounded upon the fathers
eusebius often cals that of christians an unbloody and reasonable sacrifice the word unbloody is used in opposition to corporeall and sensitive things the word reasonable to reall or vegetative things for if we conceive that reasonable and unbloody distinguish from jewish sacrifices we must understand notionall or mentall sacrifices because the jewish were not all bloody
the same eusebius also sayes that we are appointed to offer daily to god the commemoration of christs sacrifice undefined span alphabet
a kings deputy is entertained as a king and its an honour to him but kings are not entertained as deputies that's derogatory so if this were a sacrifice it were an undervaluing lessening word to say it were a meere commemoration or instead of a sacrifice
in another place also he cals it undefined span alphabet that which is the representation of a proper sacrifice is not it selfe a proper sacrifice these things differ in predicament
and to put all out of doubt chrysostome by way of correction for more proprieties sake having call'd it a sacrifice addes this word undefined span alphabet to shew that it is in propriety but undefined span alphabet
it may be called a sacrifice figuratively but in truth it is rather the remembrance of a sacrifice
our fourth

reason is taken from the acts of our ancestors in the reformation who did expresse great dislike of altars and did remove and abollsh the same as popish innovations
we will therefore against doctor heylin make these two things cleere

first that the reformers were very adverse to altars
secondly that they were so upon just grounds

constantines times though not so pure as the former yet were farre more pure then those which succeeded for antichrists entrance is obscure he seemes likes melchisedeck without pedegree as to some of his mysteries of tyranny he beganne to worke presently after the the infancie of the church but as to his solemne inthronization at rome he is much younger then constantine
tantae mo'is erat romanam condere gentem
it appeares by saint ambrose his insulting over theodosius that the hierarchy was advanced in good times and that by the blinde zeale of some men otherwise very good
altars had gotten great adoration before st ambrose but that adoration was not wholly abused till the installment of antichrist and then the sacrament was soone turned into a present propitiatory sacrifice and the forme of a table being utterly rejected a stone altar was received into its place and an immolating priest ordained
priest altar sacrifice are now growne the common termes and onely proper words and though the instant creeping in of this factious change be not knowne yet the change is now apparent it is now is plaine that these words are growne common as it is that they were not so from the beginning
and for this cause our english martyrs were necessitated to use these words conversing with papists at that time

when no other words were current and this is no proofe for the propriety thereof
frith lambert mention their examination touching the sacrament of the altar and so must now repeate the same name and so must any man in the same case but what this mention or repetition proves not our approbation thereof
so that the parliament
ed
use the name both in the act and in the writ granted thereby but what neither was the tide of language yet turned nor the reformation in any degree perfected and so in the first liturgy the word altar for the same reason is usually mentioned but in the second liturgy we see the better judgement and more setled practise of the state by the utter rejection of the very names of sacrifice and altar
but the doctor replyes that the second liturgy was introduced upon no other just consideration but onely to please the fond pragmaticall puritanicall humor of john calvin
king edw
comming to the crowne
found the enterprise of altering religion very difficult and dangerous and not suddenly to be expedited
young he was and destitute of a competent number of trusty potent and learned ministers and his father had altered nothing but in discipline onely and his taske now was to extirpate a sensuall religion of great antiquity and yet within sixe months he sets out his injunctions wherein he prescribes divers things tending to a reformation
some few months after in parliament the sacrament is commanded to be administrrd sub utraque specie and a writ therefore awarded in both which act and writ the vulgar common name is not yet disused
in
images are ejected and a new celebration of the sacrament ordered the first liturgy is now composed

and bucer sent for and as yet the word altar is not quite relinquisht
in
the king having thus farre adventured to countenance protestantisme he now adventures to strike at the heart of popery by pulling downe the masse but this hee does by proclamation not daring to put it to votes in parliament
upon this a great rebellion is raised in the west the french king also bidding defiance at the same instant and now bucer first arrives
in
great troubles hapned about the protector but the west being calmed and the french threatnings diverted bishop ridly is commanded to take downe altars in his diocese and in pauls church it selfe the altar was removed by the kings letters also to ridly it appeares that altars had beene displaced in many other parts before and the act is allowed by the king to be good and godly though our doctors now terme it an horrible outrage and by this it seemes that bucer and calvin were not the first instigators thereof
in
we read of bucers death and the arraignment commitment and execution of the protector and now hooper in his sermon before the king preaches against the remainder of altars yet standing as occasions of superstition
in
a parliament establishes the second liturgy in stead of the first and finally and generally demolishes altars not using so much as the name of sacrifice or altar
and by such limits and degrees did the kings power increase and the reformation ripen but amongst these publike affaires we may take notice also that some other considerable passages did intervene
bucer about autumne
received advertisements from calvin not to be mediis consilii authorem vel approbatorem and to be instant with the protector for the taking away of

superstitious ceremonies
the like counsell also calvin had sent to the protector to goe on in abrogating all superstitions without regard of correspondence abroad or peace at home such cautions being onely requisite in civill not divine affaires for in these the word of god is the strict rule and nothing is more distastfull to god then to alter or mitigate divine precepts according to worldly wisdome
his advise also was further that the protector would hasten the compounding of ceremony differences and to support hooper a man zealous against altars and ceremonies and one that had interest in the duke of northumberland
in his letters also to farellus
it appeares that calvin had written to the king and that his letters had beene gratiously accepted both by the king and his councell and that the had wished him to write more frequently and that the also had received letters from him and that the state had received the like advertisements from bullinger also
these pious indeavours of calvin seconded by bullinger so honourably entertained by the king and his prelates and counsellours of state nay and by the whole parliament doctor heylin traduces as the busie offices of his tampering practising and unhappy medling and thus through calvins sides our heavenly inspired ancestors are wounded and through their sides our religion
tis true the first liturgy had a morall though not a mathematicall perfection in it and so it was attestated by fox
but this concludes not that therfore it was altered only to please calvin for though in the first liturgy nothing was introduced but what was good and godly as might be well justified yet that was more good and godly which was afterward

introduced in the second the one might bee as nehemiahs temple the other as solomons both beautifull yet one more beautifull he that rightly considers the acts of edw
and his short raigne will wonder to see so much not so little done in such a space of time especially since his peeres was so factious his people so ignorant and his clergy so popish
had not divines also beene so averse at home to reformation the consultation of forrain doctors was necessary especially of such as had beene actors and spectators abroad in the like alterations but such doctors were now pretious in the world the harvest was farre too great for the labourers and the age also too queasie to endure their rigor
it is no wonder therefore if bucer came not till two yeares after the beginning of the reformation and if calvin beza and bullinger came not at all
tantae molis erat romanam extinguere gentem
doctor heylin supposes calvin pragmaticall because he was not sent for into england though he proffered himselfe unsent for and was so forward to ingage himselfe by his avisoes but this is ill supposed for calvin was knowne to be a rigorous man against ceremonies and the pompe of prelates and this made him terrible here in england
hooper is a sure instance of this for being a learned pious bishop his meere consent with calvin cast him out of his bishopricke and scarce could he ever obtaine his reinvestment though the king countenanced him though northumberland supported him though the greatest of forraine divines intreated for him
so tender a point even in those dayes was it to touch upon ceremonies the darling of episcopacie and so jealous were the holiest of our prelates in a case of such concernment to hierarchy
certainly

hooper and calvin had the same opposites and friends and therefore though the king and councell did not send for calvin bullinger because the popish and episcopall faction hated them yet they kindldy embraced their counsels and as farre as might be put them into execution
the meere popish faction could not have deterred or retarded the king and his councell we see greater matters carried against that side some other more potent enemies both hooper and calvin had even in those zealous times but in other ceremonies whatsoever difference might be doe not see but that in the amoving and condemning of altars all sides did fully agree and that ridly and cranmer were as forward as either hooper or calvin
it is manifest also that queene eliz in her restitution of religion was as ill affected to them as her brother had beene in his first reformation abolishing both the name forme and use of them and adhering wholly to the second liturgy and imitating in all things her brothers paterne
and it is as manifest that in all the raigne of king james under any visitor whatsoever there was no question ever moved concerning the name nature paterne or adoration of any altar till these later yeares made them a ground of schisme
we may more probably guesse that edw the sixth and the best of his clegry would have followed calvin further if they had had power and further time to perfect their designes then that they followed him too farre being deceived by his pritanicall faction
but doctor heylin blames calvin for being an enemy to middle counsels in performing gods strict commands not to regard humane policie in such divine affaires the doctor cals going on without fear or wit
we know how far saul departed

from gods command for politick respects when he would offer sacrifice before samuel came and when he would reserve some of the amalekitish spoyle for sacrifice yet this was not meere temporall wisedome sacrifice was his end and the service of god in both yet we know strict obedience had beene better accepted then such uncommanded sacrifice besides though saul was strictly commanded to destroy the amalekites yet he was not commanded to destroy the amalekites without all preparation consultation or opportunity gods command did binde him from all mitigation in the execution of it but not from all policie in effecting it
so king edw the sixth received a command from god to expell popery in this case for want of power the king might awaite time and opportunity wherby to compasse his end as he did but being master of opportunity he might not by any dispensation depart from that end or faile of executing his commission to the utmost
when calvin dissuaded from middle counsels he took notice withall of the ceasing both of forreine and civill warres as appeares by his letters so that we may well suppose his counsell was chiefely touching the end not the meanes for the end is strictly defined by god in divine affaires but the meanes are commonly left to humane advise
let the doctor carp at calvin and at our ancestors for crediting so medling a fellow let him disdaine that elijah or baptist spirit wherewith god had so plenteously anoynted him but this is no warrant for us to doe the like
we may better imagine that calvin was one of the blessedst instruments whom god fitted and qualified for the most blessed imployment which was ever effected the redemption
wee

may in calvin and luther two testaments of god rose againe after they ha beene slaine in babell and after that their had laine unburied in the streets for so long a time and that by their sacred testimony the sunne it selfe was relieved from a totall obseruation and a greater and more grosse darknesse was chased away from the face of religion then that which the aegyptins groped with their hands
but sayes doctor heylin in germany altars are still retained and there the reformation was complete and so complete reformation and altars may well subsist together
answer altars doe remaine in germany but it seemes in the first place luther was no favourer of them for he reproves it in carolostadiue that he did by force shew downe altars when by dispute hee ought to have expelled them
secondly it appeares by the same story that altar were in many places very offensive
thirdly the lutherans use and repute their altars as meere tables and we admit that the formall relation of an altar is not the externall forme as its wood or stone round or square but its imployment for sacrifice we allow occpadius to say that for peace sake we abhorre not from the title of sacrifice so no deceit be carried under it
but we say if not for peace and such as is from deceit wee doe abhorre the word sacrifice much more the thing
we allow with zanchy also quod neque christus neque apostoli prohibuern
altaria aut mondarunt quod liguris mensis utantur we allow both external forms in themselves indifferent made absit superstitio nay calvin himselfe that man of rigor did leave a stone altar standing at lasauna
but if altars be not necessary causes yet as they are possible occasions of superstition with

our ancestors we reject them
the fathers did use the words altar sacrifice harmlesly as to themselves but not as to others who have mistaken their meaning therein but this very mistake is avoyded by our ancestors
the germans herein imitatethe fathers being not so scrupulous in a meere occasion of abuse doe not say that they doe ill but say they doe not so well as we who avoid all misinterpretation both in our selves and others besides that which is not necessary to them by law is so to us for we are bound to beleeve that such a king and such a councell as ours were in the reformation being instituted also by such forraine doctors would not have abolisht altars contrary to the disposition of those diffrents times but upon very good and godly considerations
and certainely if the forme and name of altar we so considerable held to our sanctified illuminated then the reality thereof was of deeper consequence and much more to be provided against
and therefore it is sufficient to alledge that in our liturgy in force there is no mention of altars or sacrifices and that sacrifice which is mentioned in the sacrament is onely of spirituall praise and that wherein other hoste but our soules and bodies are offered unto god
and so in our bookes of homilies publy authorized we are warried not to make a sacrifice but a memory of the holy communion and in the booke of articles it in maintained he popish lande is a blasphe figment and perious imposture and we are not supplyed with any other in thereof and yet if our communion be at all a sacrifice so properly called how can it differ from the popish lande so lastly in the and inlarged

by king james
the two sacraments are there named and called one of baptisme the other of the lords supper there is no mention made of altar as if the communion might fitly still be called the sacrifice or sacrament of the altar as the name in popish times

concerning the propriety of the name
thus we see there is no altar but tropicall and the name cannot be proper where the thing is improper and yet we further say that as the name altar is lesse proper so it is also lesse antient then table and in both these respects lesse convenient to be used
for antiquity pocklington affirmes that noah built an altar and noah being a christian his altar was a christian altar and hence it results that the altar amongst christians is farre antienter then table

to this we reply that if noah was not a jew because not descended of judah nor of the mosaicall religion because he was many hundreds of yeares antienter then moses by the same reason he was not a christian being ancestor to christ himselfe
and as for his religion it does not appeare that hee had therein any nearer relation to christ then moses especially in sacrifices for as moses had his bloody sacrifices so had noah and as moses in his bloody sacrifices did observe a distinction of cleane and uncleane creatures so did noah
wherefore it noah be no jew it followes not he was a christian and if a christian it follows not his altar was a christian

altar and if a christian altar it followes not that it is that christian altar which we call the communion table
and surely saint ambrose is ill applyed as to this purpose to prove that the christian is antienter then the jew as if that because altars came in with noah therefore tables came not in till under the ceremoniall law or as if it concerned us to strive about the generall indefinite words of altar or table in this dispute of the communion table
our dispute is about that table or other utensill whereupon our saviour did eate both the old passover and his new one and this saint matthew and saint luke call a table using the same word as is used for that utensill whereon dives his meate was served in and the papists deny not the proprlety of this word nor the use of the thing onely doctor pocklington affirmes our saviour to have supped upon the pavement not that he can thereby averre his altar but that he may impugne our table
if the sacrament be a true sacrifice it followes not that sacrifice ever implyes any altar but we have disproved it to be a sacrifice we prove it to be undefined span alphabet rather a commemoration of a sacrifice nay even that sacrifice which it does commemorate was not simply it was but secundum quid a sacrifice
wee say our saviours passion as to its vertue was the most odoriferous sacrifice that ever was but as to its manner of oblation it might be as figurative a sacrifice as the crosse was an altar or as the crucifiers were priests and if christ did by way of proper sacrifice offer himselfe for us on the crosse yet its no necessary result that he so offers himselfe to us in the sacrament for the sacrament if it be any it is but a commemorative sacrifice at the most but sayes pocklington he that admits commemorative sacrifice

admite sacrifice
ergo
answer when we allow a sacrifice one of propitiation ather of commemration one reall the other representative of the reall onely we intend the to be proper the other improper the one truly socalled the other as it represents the true
so we difference a painted from a livingman and a from a true king for nelict is the picture a nor the actor a king but improperly but sayes mede admitting no true sacrifice yet the table is a true altar for table and altar both have the same genus altar and table differ as church and house altar is a holy table as church is a holy house so the difference is specified onely
answer

first all sacrifice is not offered as some things are offered neither edible nor potable a incense and by this it seems that the relative forlity of an altar is not meerely to support sacred repasts as it should if it were onely a sacred table
secondly this crosses the typicall intention of sacrifice for in this sense christ was no proper sacrifice nor his crosse as altar
thirdly in the jewish temple there was both a sacred altar
a sacred table and as they had severall names so they were different in forme and sitted severall uses although both their uses were sacred
fourthly if we admit table to be called altar in respect of the sacred food there presed not thereon sacrificed this opposes not our opinion but it regard that holy table expresses as much as altar in master mede sense but the word altar does not alwayes epresse so much as holy table in our sense as the vulgar now use it for this reason it is not so fitly used in common speech

fifthly altar is more and uncertaine

then the holy table for as sacrifice is appliable to all diuine services of heathens jewes and papists so altar is as generall but our service here being more eminent and excellent deserves a name as peculiar
a king is a man and more hee is truly a man yet his distinct name of king is more fit to be be used for the title of king includes the name of man but the name of man does not include the title of king
the doctors being so egar for the names of sacrifice and altar ought to have proved those name the most honourable but of this they have made no proofe at all for even amongst the jewes obedience humiliation and internall prostration of the soule was of more acceptation in the sight of god then the flesh of buls or the fat of a thousand rams
the passeover also which was both sacrament and sacrifice yet was farre more reverent as a sacrament then as a sacrifice and they which did keepe that with the inward preparation of an humbled spirit without legall purity were more accepted as appeares by hezekiahs passeover then meere legall preparation could make any
besides the table to our sacrament is not as the altar was to the jewish sacrifice for the jewish altar did sanctifie the sacrifice but our table borrowes its sanctity from the sacrament
we therefore honour the table as a sacred utensill but wee attract no honour from it we hold it a diminution to name the sacrament by the altar when we may more honourably name it by the body and blood of our saviour
for our princes sake we bowe to his chair but we denominate not the prince by his chaire or bowe to the prince for the chaires sake neither doe we disgrace the word table or altar when we denominate not the sacrament by them

but contrary to the papists we rather name the sacrament by the body of christ then by them as we stile kings rather by nations then castles or villages though they be equally lords of both
the jewes had sacraments more honourable in nature then meere sacrifices and our sacraments are farre more pretious then the jewish and therefore the wrods sacrifice and altar must needs be lessening words to our sacrament
and were they not lessening words yet for other reasons wee see our ancestors have disused them and chosen rather to nominate the sacrament by the body of christ then to descend to a community of name therein with jewes pagans and papists
and we may conceive that if our ancestors had no respect to future abuse in abolishing the words sacrifice and altar yet they might have to former for altars as they are jewish are to be deserted as paganish detested as popish abhorred
the brazen serpent might have remained as free from abuse after hezekiahs dayes as it had done before and yet though the sinne night have beene reformed the thing reserved that good king out of indignation as wel as prevention takes it away and defaces it
we may read further of this exod

for the same reason the greek fathers would not use the word undefined span alphabet but undefined span alphabet nor the latins aru but altare because they would avoid community with heathens though there was no sinne in the bare words
and this kinde of detestation is commended as pious by sir francis bacon even against words in themselves offencelesse where better choyce may be had and where great abuse has beene offered
to conclude then if words may bee prophaned and made unchristian meerely by comming into the mouths of pagans

surely much more impurity and offence is likely to stick upon the things themselves but in things abused by papists wherein we ought to to elongue our selves from them thinke we ought not to look upon them as the primitive christians did the jewes but as the jewes did heathens
for the jewish religion had beene true and was rather altered then abolisht and that in accidents rather then in substance and so we must not hold of the popish schisme
and it may be conceived that our ancestors in the reformation did shun correspondence and conformity with papists in some things and words otherwise indifferent not onely for conscience sake but also out of policie for my opinion is that our approaching towards popery in some of their rites and traditions does the more obdurate papists and make our cause seeme a weake and warping cause
but this is a sic videtur onely iobtrude it upon no man it may be the good worke which the piety of these warping times seemes so willing to incline to is more visible to doctor heylin then it is to me

concerning the altar posture

as for the posture of the altar or table it is not of it selfe of much consequence but our innovators are now very strict in urging it upon us and that onely for innovations sake
doctor pocklington in favour of this posture takes great paines to prove that christianity for the first two hundred yeeres was not so oppressed and persecuted but

that churches and altars might have beene but those heathen emperours did not extirpate religigion this is no proofe that they did protect it and if they were some way indulgent to the persons of christians this is no proofe that they were not adverse to the religion of christians we will rather admit with platina that the christians had no churches for
yeares but onely sac abdita plerunque subterranea and though under pius the first some meane churches were yet under dioclesian they were demolisht againe and therfore it is most portable as he sayes that during those times of uncertainty and calamity altars were unfixt and probable or according to strabo placed ad diversas plagas propter aliquam locorum opportunitatem and
biel mentions a woodden altar at which the popes did officiate and it was removed from place to place vbicnque romans episcopus latuerit
these descriptions agree rather with a table then an altar and rather with our thereof then theirs but it is a wonder since the doctors would faine prove such toleration of religion that churches and altars might have beene before constantine that they make no proofe at all that any were but even since constantines time altar posture is but poorely maintained
doctor heylin for his first proofe alleadges that the primitive christians prayed towards the east and that the reason thereof was because the table was plac at the east end of the church
and sayes he if the table was placed then doubtlesse in the most eminent part of the east that no man might have place beyond it for any man standing beyond the table must either not pray towards the east or not towards the table
be it granted that the

antient christians had a custome to pray undefined span alphabet and that because our sauiour hung upon the crosse with his face as both may be questioned yet this we receive onely from writers which lived west from judea where our saviour was crucified and this justifies it not in the westerne parts of christendome and if it does yet what followes does the reason of this maintaine the altar posture
so is it therefore a sinne to take the wall of the altar when we pray or if thi be a sinne can it be no wayes avoided but by the altar posture amongst the jewes the west was most honourable and yet the arke was not so fixed to the west wall of the oracle that the cherubins might not stand betweene and therefore honour is not alwayes rigorously and superstitiously to be applyed besides if our saviours posture on the crosse be the rule of our posture in our devions this rule extrud not to all christians but onely to such as lie west from judea for those which lie east by the same rule if they will not turne their backs to our saviour ought to turne their faces to the west but why should any certaine postures bee held so necessary when all nations cannot agree in the same for the same reason whatsoever was formerly by some imagin'd we know that the east is named so from the rising of the sunne and wee know the sunne has neither rising not setting but comparative and so america is as properly east as china for if america lie west to us yet it lies east to china which lies east to us
the doctor tels as not certainely whether the antients prayed because their churches were so built or whether they built so because they praye so but both wayes he makes use of it for his owne posture although

we may both wayes as probably thus reto to the contrary
if the christians prayed eastward onely because their churches were so built then they held that posture of praying in it selfe indifferent and if they built so because they prayed so then they held the posture for building so to be indifferent and sure the proofe is very weake that the primitives did put any vertue in all places of the world either in building or in praying eastward since it is most apparent that private dwellings and pagan temples and jewish synagogues were at first converted into churches and some new erections were not contrived in this eastern posture
for his second proofe the doctor sayes that antiently according to bishop juell the quire or chancell was drawne with curtaines and this would be very unsightly he sayes if the table should stand in the middle farre from the wall· the doctor here makes no difference betweene a cathedrall and parochiall church for in parchials a curtaine may hang at the chancell dore without incumbance and in cathedrals it may be drawne in the middest of the quire without any inconvenience though the table stand not neere the wall
in our cathedrals the quires are now so spatious that a third part of them may bee assigned to the undefined span alphabet or altar place and yet all the congregation may stand in the other division nay if in saint pauls london the altar wall were againe removed as it was in ridleys time the altar would be seene standing in the very middle of the quire
for his third proofe the doctor cites the altar in the church of antioch which not standing to the east is storied to have differed in posture from all other churches
if it be granted that all churches in the

west parts from antioch nay all of the whole world had altars standing towards the east this proves not that they touched the east wall and stood side wayes
the doctors fourth proofe is from the divisions in churches for first occurred hee sayes the seates of the presbyters and then above them the episcopall throne and above all the undefined span alphabet
this is spoken onely of cathedrals and in cathedrals we see the same division still yet see withall that betwixt the bishops throne and the altar wall there is a great distance so that the altar is not necessarily driven close to the wall
the doctors last and maine proofe is from the custome of papists who since they retaine the old fashion of their buildings are not likely to innovate in the fashion of their altars
this proofe is no stranger for altar posture then for the multitude of altars altars and altars and for a thousand other superstitions and yet we answer more over that it was not so easie for the papists to alter in the fashion of churches as altars and therefore this is a very argument
have now answered doctor heylin and might proceed to confute him also but that is done to my hand by a lin
minister in a booke called the holy table name and thing and hither shall referre all that are unsatisfied in this point
shall note only of that learned author that he puts his examples of the chiefest metropolies of europe and asia and in rome it selfe his first instance is in the catacombe the most antient and reverent church there wherein saint paul and peter first were buried and where none might officiate but the pope yet even this church was not canonicall in this easterne altar posture
his next instance is in saint peters there

the holy mother church of the world for there that most reverent altar which stood over the translated bnes of peter and stood some distance from the wall
many other instances are given not fit to be repeated and yet of all instances none can be more convincing the those of his foure tables so pretious and richly adorned and inscribed round about which were dedicated at constantinople rome and dennis
if altars were onely in use why was such incredible cost powed out upon tables if the altar posture was onely in use why were those tables round about on side inscribed when the inscription had beene in part obliterated come now to this later age and to our owne nation
in the time of edw· we finde that altars were taken downe that hooker preached against them that ridley tooke away the altar wall in pauls to destroy the posture of them that bucer complained in cor tantum sacra representari
and when at first things were not fully setled when the old posture was rejected and not any new one instead therof constantly we find huggaid deriding that incertainty and wee find
king edwards second liturgy ending that doubt by appointing the north side of the table for the place whereat to officiate in the time of queene eliz we finde an injunction to place the table where the altar stood saving when the communion is to be administred and other things referred to the appointment of visitors
and in the third of queene eliz· the visitors set forth their order that the steps in the chancell shall be decently and that there the communion table shall stand out of the time of receiving and we know no reason wy they which indured not the forme of an altar

should indure the posture or why they which liked not that posture in time of receiving should like it at other times or why they should call that the north side which our doctors now will needs understand the north end of the table
lastly sanctorum be interpres praeoeptorum we must beleeve that the altar posture had not beene so generally used in all parochials in the whole kingdome ever since the reformation and no care thereof taken by authority if it had beene irregular
but the doctor sayes that the altar posture is retained in the kings chappell and in cathedrals and that they ought to give law and not to receive it from parochials
for answer we say that chappels and cathedrals have their own peculiar statutes may differ sometimes from themselves therein and from parochials but parochials are all governed by the publike canons besides we see there is a great difference in the very fabrick between cathedrals chappels and parochials and therefore in parochials the table is removed in time of administration because the chancel was not held so fit for the audience and accesse of the people but in cathedrals and chappels no such removall is necessary
chappels cathedrals also otherwise as in pompe and in the intelligence of the congregation and in this respect also ceremonis may be perhaps the more plausible in them then they are in parochials
the doctor lastly cites saint gregories case and sayes that their altar posture was adjudged by the kings owne decision
but conceive otherwise for these reasons

first because that church of saint gregorie stood under the very wall of pauls and owed a filiall subjection thereunto

secondly because that church had no chancell

to officiate in but was built chappell wise the east eud thereof being sufficiently visible to all the congregation

thirdly because the king did not intimate in his order that he intended to make that case a precedent to other parochials and we know no reason why that pleasure should be concealed which desires to be obeyed
fourthly because many other visitors both wise and godly have not taken it as an law in their jurisdictions
fifthly the king did onely settle the table being removed and prevent further removals but hee did not place it to the east wall himselfe and we know the law would not have all things done which it hinders from being undone
for these reasons it may be conjectured that the kings aime was at uniformity onely but not in all things nor at all times where the like reason is not
and since bilson sayes that the very word altar sonts superstition and the parliament adjudges that the forme of a table shall more move from superstition and there can be no reason why the posture of the altar should not fall under the same consideration we conceive the kings meaning to have beene mistaken

chap
iv
concerning the sanctity of the altar or its due adoration

the honour and sanctity of the altar and that adoration which is due thereunto is now to be

insisted upon
the name nature and posture of altar has beene all this while so stifly vindicated and maintained in behalfe of the table that a divine worship might be asserted and challenged as due to it but now behold on a sudden when the name of altar will not serve the name of arke must supply that office
in the twinckling of eye the scene is changed by our doctors and that which was an altar before is now become an arke and that which stood before in the sanctuary is now removed into the propitiatory and there shrowdes it self under the wings of cherubins
the surest argument now is that as our churches are to be accounted holy and reverenced as the temple was amongst the jewes so in our churches the holy table not altar stands responsible to the arke of the covenant and the
doctor micklethwaite sayes that god may be worshipped in such places where his presence is truly specified as it was in the mount in the temple and if under the law it was no idolatry to worship towards the places and monuments of gods extraordinary presence it is none in the gospel
and thus it is lawfull he sayes to lift up our hands and eyes towards heaven and so vocally implore god because in the act of such worship we use heaven but as a meere circumstance not as an object no not relative or mediate and we direct our posture only and not at all the act of our worship towards it
hence he infers that the like respect may be used to our table or altar which the jewes used to the arke or temple because ours answer to theirs being according to antiquity solium christi and oculus ecclesiae
so wee see his maine ground is that a reverentiall posture being due to any sacred place where gods presence

is specially manifested as in the church this pois best directed to that place of the church which is most sacred and of most eminent relation to god and that place is the altar or table
god is in all places present and yet the monuments and specifications of his presence are not alike cleare and glorious in all places his presence in heaven is not as it is in the jewish temple nor in the jewish temple as in ours nor in our churches as in common places gods presence is sometimes in some places extraordinary yet even his very extraordinary preence is not alwayes to be alike honoured in all places and at all times
heaven it selfe is not to be made the object but onely the circumstance of devotion and that not of the act but only of the posture of our worship and yet heaven is indeed the true throne of god and can therefore the lifting up of our hands to god in heaven justifie the falling downe before an altar had the doctor first proved that the table was solium christi and the chancell oculus ecclesiae and that there was the same adoration now due to the altar as was once to the arke and that gods presence is so now specified in our churches as it was in solomons temple or as it is in heaven he had maintained enough for the meere posture of adoration
but since this maine undefined span alphabet is still unproved it will bee better worth my while to passe from hence to doctor· lawrence his sermon upon exod

where hee is more full expresse and direct in the point then any other of the doctors
there was sayes doctor lawrence a holinesse acknowledged amongst the jewes in places in persons and in things and that according to degrees some holy some more holy some most holy according to the dispensation

of gods residence and grace as that did more or lesse shine upon them
not onely the tabernacle the mount the temple but even the staming bush shewes this for at a nearer distance moses might not be at all nor at a farther without unloosing his shooes
hence the doctor indeavours to conclude that if gods presence and grace was the cause of this holinesse amongst the jewes then the same reason of holinesse remaines still amongst us christians since no man can deny that god is still as present and gratious amongst christians as eve he was amongst the jewes
and in this hee does not depart from the same principles which doctor miklethwaite took before for granted and which at first view carry a very specious colour of reason with them
to this therefore make a fourefold answer

first it is true god is now as present and as gratious in his presence as ever he was amongst the jewes but he is not so visibly nor so majestically present to us as to the jewes
there is some kinde of opposition betwixt majesty and love and therefore as the poet affirmes no bene conveniunt nec in una sede morantur to us god descends in more love to the jewes in more majesty and wee hold that a severall entertainment is due accordingly
majesty requires more externall prostration and feare love expects more internall joy and confidence
even in these dayes when we come to the church of god we ought to make our addresse with all possible humility and zeale but if god should in the church appeare in fire or any fearfull similitude to us as he did formerly certainely we ought to cleae to the dust and to inwrap our selves externally in the more confusion and yet god is

not the more truly or gratiously present because of that apparition

secondly when god did ocularly appeare amongst the jewes hee did not at all times and in all places and of all men require the same adoration so that we may suppose that the manner of adoration given was not meerely because god did appeare but brcause god would have his apparition so entertained
moses here did worship but god commanded the manner of his worship and in many other interviewes in scripture wherin god did grace both patriarchs and prophets wee doe not read of any consecration of place or any such distinct adoration as this of moses either commanded by god or performed by man
certainely elijah when god passed by him and gave him the beatificall sight of his fell prostrate upon the ground to humble and debase himselfe before that gratious presence but that he performed any homage or gratefull service to the place it selfe we doe not reade
besides in this case of the blazing bush there was a command and that but temporall and we doe not reade that any holinesse did remain in the bush after the command
so also the holinesse of the mount of the tabernacle of the temple as it was created by the command of god so that command had its limits of time by which we may observe in my opinion that the honour was rather politicall then physicall as may so say without speciall command had not bin due in such a manner or degree
but sayes lawrence after an apparition in luz jacob anoynted a pillar built an altar changed the name of the place from luz to bethel
jacob did so and did religiously in doing so but yet if we suppose jacob

had no especiall command to doe so it is not consequent that jacob had finned if he had not done so
besides jacob did erect those monuments of honour not onely in celebration of that ground whereon he was reposed when he beheld the angels ascending and descending but also of that radiant gate of heaven which opened it self to him to inebriate his soule with such celestiall beautifull spectacles
and lastly jacob did chuse that place whereon to worship god but this does not imply that jacob did performe any reverence at all or honour to the place it selfe and so if he had done the like in another place upon another occasion he had done well

thirdly the jewish honour and reverence in regard of the manner of it was chiefely negative and except in cases of divine worship and civill worship we read of no other
the arke was so holy that it might not be approacht or toucht but with such and such conditions so the bush which gods presence inflamed it was too holy for too neere accesse a the ground about it too pretious to be trod upon with uncleane shooes but who ever read of any bowing or kneeling or positive adoration attributed to the arke or bush or temple or any other thing under the jewish discipline doctor lawrence indeed does produce a third kind of worship betwixt divine and civill which he cals reverentiall or religious but he does not fully prove what kind of conditions it had whether it was positive or negative internall or externall or how farre it did extend or how farre it was due to relative instruments for gods sake wherefore if the doctor means this negative kind of worship which consists in distance and forbearance for reverentiall it is

most evident that this kinde of worship was never in use since christs time as to the rigor of it nor cannot be now introduced without great absurdity and superstition

fourthly the honour and worship of god not to be weighed in humane ballances and not greater or lesse according to that proportion which we call arithmetical or geometricall
moses being in the bosome of god far above the sight of the people is not to be supposed to honour or worship god lesse by his familiarity then the meanest of the peopl wch lay groveling trembling at the feete of god and durst not approach the very outmost and lowest borders of the mountaine
some resemblance wee have of this in princes courts for it is not presumption in some favorites to be covered in the kings presence or to approach the though it be almost capitall in others and yet where princes are so familiarly honoured they may be sincerely honoured without all saucinesse and such familiarity may stand as compatible with internall humility as the most debafing subjection in men
so if god doe admit moses into familiarity into such familiarity as abates of externall prostration and distance and feare yet it is not consequent that moses is hereby transported beyond the limits of internall awe and zeale and humiliation
and if it was so amongst the jewes themselves in those rigorous times shall it not be so now amongst christians when christs iron scepter is turned to a golden in his hand in the jewish worship there was feare but not without joy in the christian worship there is joy but not without some feare for as feare was more predominant in them so joy is in us
why is our saviours raigne

over us now called in the scripture the kingdome of heaven certainely in comparison of that discipline which the jewes lived under for in comparison of the jewish which is more earthly our worship now is like that of the triumphant saints in heaven where joy is predominant and not feare wherefore it is not rightly objected by doctor lawrence when he expostulates thus
shall god loose part of his honour from us by sending his sonne to us must there be lesse linesse in the church where christ is in truth sacrificed by himselfe then where he was sacrificed in a type or shadow by aaron in the temple answer no god loses no honour the church loses no holinesse although the rigorous worship of the jewes which consisted in distance and terror and forbearance be mitigated by the milde sweete and peacefull raign of our saviour over us we worship with more joy and confidence then moses did moses then the jewes the saints in heaven then us yet neither moses nor we nor the glorified saints diminish but adde rather to the glory of god and if any men now thinke that the most servile worship is not honourable to god even when they are most with feare and lie lowest upon the dust the saints in heaven may upbraidingly say unto them or rather triumphantly sing rent your hearts and not your garments curvae in terras animae at lestiinanes
but will lawrence say is not this the doctrine of the seditious corahs of this age does not this doctrine make all persons alike holy and all places and so confound all order in religion our saviour tels us in the gospel that the temple is holier then the gold and the altar then the gift and by expulsing those exchangers and hucksters beyond the utmost

borders of the sanctuary both after his baptisme and before his passion when those legall sacrifices were before ejected thence where the christian church was best represented their lasting devotion being performed here their expiring types within showes that this distinction should last
the doctors first proofe was so it was amongst the jewes therefore so it ought to be now in this place the doctor proceeds to show further that by our saviours owne doctrine nd precedent the jewish distinction of holinesse in the church ought still to remaine
to the jewish platforme of worship it was in part answered before that our saviour had made an alteration thereof inducing in its stead a more ingenuous confident manner of worship but now this of the doctors seemes to crosse that opinion
by this argument the doctor would seeme to prove that our saviour was so far from violating the jewish distinctions that he did zealously preserve them and vindicate them from the violations of other men and that also after the ejection of legall sacrifices
answer it is confest that our saviour did purge the temple from the prophanation of those which bought and sold therein as in a common place but herein many things are considerable which the doctor passes over with silence

first these buyers and sellers did not onely exercise a common trade in that sanctified place but it should seem their trading was full of fraud and unjustice for our saviour sayes plainely that they made the house of prayer a very den of theeves

secondly it is not manifest whether legall sacrifices were now de jure ejected or no and so whether this prophanation be to be considered as a trespasse committed against the law of moses or as a violation

of a christian oratory
baptisme was now in force by johns institution but circumcision was not disanulled by any act of our saviour nor disused by his apostles for we finde the contrary even after christs ascension
besides we finde not that our saviour till his passion did repeate or oppose any mosaicall rites whatsoever but wee finde apparently that he did observe strictly many of them
he observed the sabbath he did eate the passeover he did refraine the lists of the inner courts and till his expiration he did not teare the vaile of the oracle in sunder so that we see no reason why the temple till then might not remaine wholly jewish

thirdly consider this act of prophanation either way and it is no wonder that our saviour should reforme it for even in christian oratories at this day no such thing ought to be indured
he which denies any externall positive adoration or genuflexion due to the church it selfe or any division of it or utensill in it does not deny internall and such negative reverence as this viz that it should be free preserved inviolable from common servile exercises and offices and much more from impious abuses
this unjust aspersion the doctors every where labour to cast upon us but as they want proofe to confirme it so hope they will want auditors to beleeve it
but if wee suppose this as a hrist an abuse the temple being now de jure christian why did not our saviour comming with such unresistible authority purge the inner court and oracle also from jewish ceremonious services and destinate them to prayer and preaching as well as the outer court why did he not enter and draw the vaile and dissolve that partition as after he did

if the jewish devotions had beene now fully consummated who had beene more fit to enter into the holiest then he and his disciples or what incense could have beene more sacred in that place then his prayers certainely if his time had beene come he might have as well expelled the priests and levites usurping against him as he did the chapmen of doves and oxen and certainely he did not want boldnesse for wee know with what freedome hee spoke at other times to the greatest of them
so then this is a very weake argument to prove that our saviour did still preserve in force that terrible kinde of holinesse in the church of god which makes some parts thereof inaccessible to and others to priests according to the jewish patterne
but on the contrary what is more apparent then this truth that our saviour hath rent in sunder that vaile of partition which these doctors would faine hang up againe that they might usurpe a greater dignity to themselves and their owne order then the gospel of christ doth allow them as to the approaching of the throne of grace and that with boldnesse wee say wee are all royall priests now and we are not to disclaime that prerogative because the doctor seemes to jeere at it
it is true that the nation of the jewes was also stiled a priestly kingdome to the lord and it was so in comparison of all other nations which then lived but whereas it is said now that we are a royall it is said in comparison of the jewes themselves
aaron might once a yeere approach the oracle but with feare and trembling presenting incense in one hand and blood in the other but we may now approach that throne which is more honourable then the oracle and that with boldnesse and at all times

whatsoever
neverthelesse doe not say that the raigne of our soveraigne doth take away the holinesse of persons or places or things but it changeth that holinesse which was in them and maketh the manner thereof different
that holinesse which was then in the high priest is now dispersed into all the people of god for if we are all pri as aaron was certainely we are all priests of a higher order then aarons was
therefore the sinne of corah cannot justly be charged upon us under the gospel as the doctor would have it if we claime accesse into the holiest for aarons order is now dissolved and so are the conditions of aarons order
neither et the doctor suppose that make no difference now betwixt the person of a priest and of a as to all purposes for all equality does not overthrow all order and decencie
vzziah had a person as sacred as the priest yet vzzia might not officiate as the priest did vzziah had his offices distinct and so had the priest and these offices might not be confounded ontrary to decencie although the sanctity of persons might be communicable without disorder
so now it were disorder and the confusion of corah for a secular man to usurpe the function of a minister but it is not the same to challenge an equall prerogative in the spirituall empire of our saviour
in the like manner we say of places the sanctity of them is altered not destroyed we say god is now more extensively and universally present by his grace then hee was amongst the jewes
in judea as to his terrestriall habitation he did confine himselfe within the wals of one temple but now that of malachy is verified where the lord aith from the rising of the sunne unto the going downe of the same my name shall

be great among the gentiles and in every place icense shall be offered unto my name and a pure offering
besides as god now inhabits amongst us more universally so also more amiably or else no nor priests but with such and such restraints might make any addresse at all into the church or ccell which the papists themselves doe not maintaine
to the jewes god was more dreadfull as to servants to us he is more milde as to sonnes
the law was delivered with terror and so kept for it was made mortall to approach either the moune where the law was delivered or to touch the arke where it was kept but when our saviour came into the world to publish his gospel he tooke not on the habit of a lord but of a servant and as his entrance so his life and death was and as his soveraignty was acquired so it seemes to be maintained ever since
in the like manner wee say also that there is a change of things
many externall rites and customes of reverence which consisted in the rigorous observations of times and in the lotions of their bodies and purity of garments and cleannesse of diet are vanished and yet some equity of these still remaines according to the rules of order and decencie but no further
though these rites were honourable to god and conducing to decencie and the pompe of religion yet the strictnesse thereof is now relinquished according to the heb

for there they are called carnall ordinances imposed on the jewes only untill the time of reformation
wherefore let the doctor conider if all the jewish rites which were requisite to the externall honour of religion bee not as properly vindicated and maintained by these arguments as the distinct sanctity of places in the church and

yet these no papist will defend
neverthelesse doe not speake against all pompe in religion onely say that simplicity seemes more sutable with these times of christianity wherein wee worship such a saviour as we doe
and on the other side it is most apparent that our pompe addes nothing to god for aaron in all his beauty solomon in all his majesty did retribute no more honour to god then abraham or isaack in their naked simplicity
but it hath beene rather observed that when the church had woodden chalices it had golden priests but god send us golden priests and golden chalices both
after our saviours death saint stephen and saint paul were accused amongst the jewes for speaking against these mosaicall distinctions in the temple and here doctor lawrence sayes if the accusation were true it was just
will aske the doctor this question was the temple at that time de jure jewish or christian was moses or christ to take place in it if he say christ as he must then why should he thinke saint stephen and saint paul more unworthy to enter into the most honourable parts of the temple then any of the jewish priests it ought not to be presumed that these blessed followers of christ did generally vilifie the honour of gods house but their crime was that they did preach against the mosaicall strictnesse of the limits and divisions of the temple shewing that all places therein were approachable by the adors of christ
there can be no other charge probable and if the doctor say that in this they were justly accused he is as wrongfull a judge over them as any of the jewes whatsoever could be

now we come to fathers and antiquity
the primitive christians sayes doctor lawrence distinguished

their oratories into an rium sanctum and sanctum sanctorum and accordingly put more holinesse in one then in the other having an altar here answerable to an arke there and in signe of perpetuity poynted their churches east looking towards the temple
in this conceit doctor larence goes not alone onely the other doctors because the changing of the scene from the sanctum to the sanctum sanctorum from the altar to the arke upon the sudden would be too remarkable are more sparing of language
but what an argument is this because the primitive christians did build their churches with some kinds of divisions resembling the jewish temple and because they did esteeme one place more holy then another therefore they did esteeme the very jewish holinesse and distinctions in all things equally in force
it should seeme the altar was advanced to an higher dignity and removed out of the sanctum to possesse the place of the arke and the mercie seate because this alteration suits with the doctors purpose· but in all other things the jewish honour and holinesse remaines unchanged in our churches
the building of our churches east also looking towards the jewish temple shewes the perpetuity of holinesse and although this be but a particular reason not to be extended to any churches but such as stand west from judaea yet for the doctors benefit it must be taken for universall
neither must we make any use of this doctors argument to any other purpose although it be as apply able to the heathen temples as to ours or the jewish for they had the same divisions also whereof some were more holy and unaccessible then others
but it is apparent that the jewish sanctity in its strictnesse cannot

be attributed to our quire by our doctors owne tenet for he himselfe grants it accessible to priests and all within orders and we on the other side in an equitable sense allow it more reverence then other parts of the church therefore what kinde of honour is it which the doctor challenges both different from the jewish and ours also if the primitive church stood wholly to the jewish patterne then they may be produced against the doctor as well as against us if not how are they produced against us in this point more then against the doctor himselfe that antiquity did observe a difference betweene common and consecrated ground and also betweene one consecrated place and another and in the fashion of their buildings hold some complyance with jewes and gentiles both so farre as the rules of decencie and charity did require certainly it was piously and prudently done
that which we say is onely this

first we doe not perceive that antiquity did strictly adhere to the jewish discipline

secondly if antiquity in honouring of sacred places were more rigorous then we are now we doe imagine that in part it was erroneous and in part that it had some reasons unknowne to us at this time and so vanished now that they ought not to prescribe to us
all rude prophanation of holy ground wee doe dislike as antiquity did because it is opposite to the rules of decencie and order and if any man teach that the house of god is contemptible or that there ought to be a community of places or persons we wish the anathema of gangra to seize upon him
howsoever we dare not in all things follow antiquity
if antiquity did thinke the church too holy for justice to approach

when malefactors sought shelter there from the due execution of law we dare not follow antiquity therein if antiquity did thinke the quire so holy that the person of an anoynted emperour might have no place therein we dare not in this follow antiquity if antiquity did thinke the chancell ground too holy for any bones to repose in or the too unholy for a priests interment we dare not justifie this usage if antiquity did thinke fit to translate the bones peter paul augustine aidan from one consecrated place to another for more holinesse sake as if it were profitable to the ashes of the saints so to be translated we dare not applaud this invention if antiquity did place such holinesse in the altar as if it had medicinall force in it to cure bodily diseases and for that reason did fall downe before it as to a common physitian wee cannot so farre abuse our beliefe if antiquity did exclude divers stations of christians from divers partitions and limits in the body of the church wee dare not now in these dayes practise this observation
we doe not hold the judgement of antiquity to be in all things infallible neither in these circumstances dare we strictly addict our selves to their imitation the papists themselves being scarce devoted to all these observations at this day
but if we approve antiquity in all these things yet how does it appeare that it did sanctifie the altar in stead of the arke and or the chancell in the same manner as the jewish oracle was and if it did how could our priests prove hence such worship as they now challenge due to the altar if we consider the arke and the oracle and compare them with our table and quire we shall finde that the paralell of honour

cannot hold for many reasons for

first those times were not as ours are the sweete pacification of christ had not then made god so indulgent to mankind as now he is so that he would be glorified then with more terror than now he is
god in those dayes did not admit of so much familiarity in his servants as now he does yet to shew that some familiarity might be without sawcinesse which the doctor seemes unwillingly to grant to some men he offered himselfe in the milde semblance of a familiar friend even in those times
this the examples of abraham isaac jacob moses sufficiently verifie
was moses sawcy or joshua when he ascended up into the mount within the cloud and brightnesse of god or was the congregation more reverent and obsequious when they durst not so much as lift up their eye after moses because of the terror of god certainely no for god was more sanctified by the bold addresse of moses then by the awfull distance of the people and therefore whilest their faces were blacke with feare his face was arayed in divine splendor and majesty
neither was it the holinesse of moses his person but the gratious indulgence of god that made this difference betwixt him and the people and so wee say now of these dayes mutatis mutandis

secondly the table is of it selfe much different from the arke and mercy seate
the arke was terrible by reason of the law of god which was therein inclosed that mortall law from whose condemnation no man living could escape of himselfe but the table presents us with the very marrow of the gospell wherein is life and health and forgivenesse of sinnes
also the arke was canopyed

with the mercy seate that dreadfull thro of god where god did keepe a strange residence vocally ruling his people and administring justice after a terrible manner but the table is an fill wherein god is not so presentiall at all times nor at any time meerely by the meanes of that it selfe but by the meanes of the sacrament at some times supported by it
also the sanctum sanctorum it selfe was such a place as was wonderfully terrible by reason of gods residence in it after the losse of the arke and the mercy seate and soe doe not repute our chancells whose chiefest honour is borrowed from the holy table and for these reasons we know the arke was not to be touched even by a priest and that upon a godly consideration but upon such penalty as vzzah indured nd with this condition our table cannot uite and we know that the oracle also was not to be approached but once a yeare and that by the high priest only with this condition also our quires cannot agree for if these conditions were admitted the table might not be touched or remooved or altered for any reason whatsoever or any other place designed for the administration of the communion or any other time appointed but once every yeare

lastly neither the gospell written nor the prctise of antiquity doe informe us that ever the altar and chancell were so honoured by christians as the arke and oracle were by the jewes we see no probability that ever the table was accounted any thing but a holy utensill till doctor helyn disyned ned that for why should the chalice and patin be utensils and not the table they being more necrely imployed about the body and blood of our saviour then the table if the table be not as

meere an instrument and utensill as the chalice is then the doctor must derive its honour from some other thing than the sacrament and designe it for some higher use proper to it selfe as the arke and was but this the doctor cannot doe and if he should attempt it even so he would crosse his owne assertions
the arke with the could not properly be said an utensill in the jewish service because they were ordained by god for no humane office but rather for a receptacle of the divinity as a place where god would set the soles of his feete
but the table is therefore placed in the church that it may be employed in the communion and if the communion had not beene instituted no such thing had beene necessary at all
neither is it of any absolute necessity in the communion for in case of persecution it is held that for want of a table wee may celebrate the eucharist upon the ground it selfe
besides among the jewes the altar and the altar instruments were of the same metall in the same manner beautified and with the same solemnity consecrated and therefore why our chalice and patin should not much rather be of the same honour and sanctity as the table cannot discerne
for it is most certaine that our table is more properly a relative instrument in our sacrament from whence it receives all its honour then the jewish altar was which lent honor to mosaical sacrifices rather than borrow any

but sayes doctor lawrence we finde a kinde of worship in cyrill a direct worship in eusebius emissenus theodoret augustine and chrysostome
we have undefined span alphabet in ignatius and adgeniculation in tertullian
answer

first we our selves doe grant a reverentiall honour

due to all holy relative instruments for go sake and therefore from all those fathers which speake generally and meane no other but undefined span alphabet as ignatius does we doe not at all dissent

secondly where particular adgeniculation is required or bodily prostration so it be in the time of receiving and tender'd for the sacraments sake and not to the very table wee doe practise and allow it
and so wee agree with saint chrysostom that we ought to approach the table undefined span alphabet and cum prius adoraverimus with saint austine
thirdly at any time as well when the sacrament is not upon the table as when it is we doe not alwayes censure of such a decent bowing before the table or towards the table as the jewes did performe towards the mount or tabernacle so the table it selfe be not the object or held the onely occasion of our worship
fourthly we say the table may be called holy venerable and divine in a qualified sense by reason of its relation as the garments of aaron and the utensils of the temple were but this infers no duty of worship
fifthly we say that antiquity might erre by way of superstition towards the table and this we beleeve the rather because in some places they did ascribe inherent physicall vertue to it and at some times such rigor of holinesse that princes and emperours might not be permitted to abide in the same division of the church where it stood if tertullian say that bodily worship is due to the altar yet he prove it not out of scripture we answer out of saine augustine non credimus quod non legimus

sixthly it is not proved by any one humane authority or more that altar worship was in use in

all parts of christendome at one time or in any one part at all times much lesse is any thing brought out of scripture to this purpose

seventhly in the same manner and by the same authority we finde presbyteris advolvi due as well as aris adgeniculari and in antiquity also it was part of penance presbyteris aris advolvi
and we know moreover that not onely excessive honours but also all the revenues and treasure of churchmen was first raised and advanced by this art
it is not to be wondred therefore if ambitious and covetous prelates did so much magnifie and extoll that which did so much magnifie and extoll them
well may the pope still in all consecrations hallow the altar with most pompe and ceremony well may he anoynt that which was the first cause of anoynting him well may he sacrifice to that net which has made all princes sacrifice to him well may he claime divinity and sanctity for that which has promoted him to fit in the temple of god as god nay above all that is called god
when the hornes of antichrist first began to shoote forth when the man of sinne and the sonne of perdition first began to be revealed it had beene very unadvisedly ordered if psalmes of degrees had not beene sung at the ascending of those staires whereby the priest did mount to as much or more exaltation himselfe as he did procure to the holy altar
but this is a tender point and if speake any thing in disparagement of antiquity especially the great bishops of old times shall be as a man to truth or religion and all which shall say will be soone rejected and easily refuted

therefore to avoyd unjust imputations will confine my selfe to the meere point in question and

digresse no further then the doctors arguments me and therein also my chiefe indeavour shall be to doe reason to princes not to detract at all from priests
two things shall observe

first that this tenet of the altar and altar doth naturally issue forth conclusions that are very dangerous and prejudiciall to princes
secondly that the doctors have too farre cotenanced and maintained the same in their late treatises concerning the altar contrary to thse many pretenses of zeale and devotion which they every where make to the name of royalty
by the doctors grounds meere relation to sacred things is of vigor and honour sufficient to transfer reverece and dignity upon the instruments relatively used for sayes doctor lawrence god is not worshipped if relative instruments be not worshipped for his sake
this being granted it followes that most honour is to be transferred upon that instrument which is most nobly relative and so in the sacrament the priest being undefined span alphabet and the table or patin being but insensible utensils the priest is to be accounted more holy and honourable then either the table or patin
if so then what becomes of princes for they are as much inferiour to the altars in sanctity as altars are to priests
they are not holy enough to approach the rayle of the altar or to stay in the chancell therefore how shall they demeane themselves towards priests who are farre more honourable and venerable in their offices then the altars are in their imployments

besides if the altar be honourable for the sacraments sake and the sacrament onely or chiefely as it is a sacrifice then how honourable is he that

makes this a sacrifice for the sacrament is not a sacrifice by vertue of our hoc edite but only by vertue of the priests hoc facite so sayes doctor heylin very plainly
how many kings ha's this doctrine formerly dethroned what warres and calamities has it imbrued the whole world withall when it first brought christians downe to the clergies feete how many heresies did it broach withall how many myriads of soules did it at the same instant sinke into the lake of hell

but will the doctors say if popish priests have made ill use of this doctrine what is that to us who honour and adore soveraignty above all other men wish the doctors were as they pretend to bee wish they were not undefined span alphabet as they taxe their opposites unjustly wish they did no more profit by this doctrine then their adversaries doe or else wish they did not more advance this doctrine then those which they call the seditious corahs of the time
but if the doctors are so well wishing to temporall rulers how is it that they all alleadge the example of ambrose and theodosius so often without any kinde of detestation or dislike nay seeming rather to justifie and applaud it and how is it that they speake so pleasingly of numerianus numerianus sonne to carus the emperour comming into the church at antioch and desiring to behold their mysteries quasi per transennam peeping it is likely through the rayles or lattice dores of the quire he was presently rebuked by babylas for that attempt but this heinous prophanation was committed but by the sonne of an emperour and so babylas might be the more bold in his rebuke therefore let us rather see how theodosius was used at millaine
theodosius a penitent emperour having

beene long prohibited the church and at last ceived againe and permitted to communicate yet he was thought unworthy after his offring made have any abode granted him within the bounds of the quire
it was not sufficient that he was an perour and a christian emperour and a
christian emperour it was not sufficient that
constantinople and his easterne dominions his was within the quire but at the proud check of a bishop of millaine sent by one of the deacons he must depart that sacred place
this story the doctors do all severally produce either once or if it were not dishonourable to all princes to have it mentioned at all or rather impious or ungtious in all priests to suffer the mention thereof passe uncensured from their lipps
here is a cleare authority cited againe and againe with the weight of saint ambrose his name to abet it that by the rules of approved antiquity the persons of princes were not worthy to approach that part of the church where the altar was placed and where the priest and deacons did officiate
and if saint ambrose would so extrude an annoynted emperour at milline what would the pope himselfe have done at rome if such a pious bishop would be so insolent and distoyall what would the bishop of all bishops have done the doctors do not openly declare themselves in favour of this act of saint ambrose because thinke it needs not for their opinion in sufficiently evident of itselfe and if they did not discover their consent by silence yet their scope in this whole busines would make it manifest
for by what law did saint ambrose confine the emperour to the body of the church it was not by the law of god nor of the emperour for it should seeme the emperour

had a contrary law in his easterne dominions it must needs be by this altar law and this only
if the levites table be so much dignified and hallowed meerly by bearing the body of our saviour then certainly the priest which conecrates the same and is more nobly and intelligently active in the celebration of the sacrament must needs acquire much more dignity and holinesse and if so then priests must needs be more excellent then princes then whom the table is more excellent
this must needs bee that which did convince theodosius and this if it be yeelded to will still convince and confound and degrade all christian princes whatsoever for this is one of the most powerfull intoxications that the inchantresse of rome mingles for the princes of the earth
the foundations of the popish hierarchy are not yet quite razed in many mens minds
the scripture is cleere that as priests are dedicated to god and admitted to a nearenesse in holy affaires to serve and officiate at gods atar and doe thereby gaine a sanctity above meere so also that princes are sacred in a higher degree in that they are anoynted by god to feede governe and protect both priests and and to represent god himselfe in his power and majesty and to have nearest accesse in things of the highest and holyest nature
aarn though the first and greatest of his order receives his solemne consecration from the hands of him which weilds the scepter and when the law is to bee delivered the is to bee admitted into the presence of god and higher to bee promoted in the dreadfull majesticall cloud then any of the house of levi nay his next subordinate attendant obtaines a higher station in the smoaking

mountaine then any of the priests
also when the tabernacle and the arke is to be framed and when the temple is to be erected the modells are prescribed and committed to the charge of the prince and when all is finished the princes blessing and prayer presents the same as dedicated and separated to gods service
and in all the offices of religion the priests serve in the outward action but the lawgiver superintends over the priests in that service and when any great difficulty requires god is to bee consulted and approached at the command of the supreme ruler so that the good or ill state of religion depends chiefly upon the good or ill government of gods immediate lievetenant
and thus aaron is but as a mouth to moses in some things but moses is as a god to aaron in all things and though moses may not officiate at the altar meerly out of contempt to aaron and his function or out of enmity to all order and relation yet he may move uncontrolled in his own superiour first moving sphere
it is a poore shift of our doctors to pretend that moses was within sacerdotall orders and to cite the
psalme where it is sayd moses and aaron among the priests for moses had not ecclesiasticall power because he was of ecclesiasticall order but he may therefore ee reckoned amongst men of ecclesiasticall order because he had more then ecclesiasticall power
what moses had in the government of the church over themselves the same david had and solomon had and all the successors of david and solomon ought to have
till the world was inslaved to under the pretence of church policie the care of temporall and spirituall affaires was not divided neither was the one which is the

basest given to the magistrate and the most excellent attributed to the priest as if the prince was the body and the priest the soule of the state
miserable were wee sayes doctor pockington he meanes in poynt of religion if my lord of canterbury could not derive his lineal succession from saint peter but thinke if this bee all our stay wee are now most miserable for our religion is the same as theirs is in geneva and theirs in scotland and theirs in the netherlands and in the north parts of germany where no bishops are and if they are miserable wee cannot be happy
had wee beene hereticks if in the reformation none of the romish clergy had had hand in our reformation if cranmer latimer ridly hooper had not turned protestants had we been utterly deprived of the true and effectuall power of ordination and imposition of hands could not god by the sacred hands of edward the sixt have derived his grace unto the protestant clergy unlesse some from the romish party had come over to doe those offices of consecration was the hand of moses joshuah more gratious and effectuall in the offices of ordination under the law then a protestant princes is under the gospell what is the reason of it that the gospell should bee introduced to the detriment and prejudice of temporall authority or else shall we thinke that aaron was as the soule in spirituall rule whilst the jewish law was in force and that moses had but a corporeall subordinate lesse excellent power under him but will follow this chase no further now because the times are lately changed and believe the doctors will easily yeeld to retreate of their owne accord
praesbyteris aris advolvi was the old penance as well

for princes as people now wee will bee content if they will leave out presbyteris and shew devotion aris onely
my lord of canterbury and doctor pocklington thinke it a good argument for altaworship that
yeares agoe the founders of the garter did performe their ceremonies with adoration before the altar and that the successors of that order have continued the same adoration ever since
this is scarce worth an answer for the times when this custome began were blinde and superstitious and the meere practice of a few noble men was never yet thought a canon in matters of ecclesiasticall discipline
but come now from precedents to give answer to our doctors reasons
a difference of places sayes lawrence requires a difference of respect that honour may be sutable to merit as justice requires
answer wee dispute not against degrees of internall reverence whereby wee hold churches more honourable then barnes our exceptions are against the jewish rigor of bodily adoration or such externall expressions of worship as favour of too much terror and consternation but the doctor further presses thus
it is but as justice requires that that place should have the preeminence from which vertue is derived to the rest for the word is not operative but by the merit of that sacrifice nor the streames of regeneration pure unlesse first bathed in his bloud
might deny that any one place in the church deriveth vertue to an other but will not stand upon avills for the doctors meaning is no more then this that the word is not operative but by the merit of that sacrifice therefore that place where the word is preached is not so honourable as that where christ is sacrificed
to make comparisons

of honour betwixt the ordinances of god is not so safe and commendable but grant the sacrament to be more operative then the word for so the doctor should have argued is not the word therfore operative at all but by the sacrament how does this conclude may not baptisme and the preaching make us partakers of christs bloud and merits except wee actually receive the eucharist is the vertue of christs bloud only annexed to the sacrament and if so is the vertue of the sacrament affixed to the altar place and if so must that place bee infallibly in the upper end of the chancell doth the church of england so oblige it selfe to that place in all cases that it will not have the communion celebrated in any other part of the church and if so is all the honour of the sacrament in the consecration and nothing in the distribution is not the place where the people receive of some sanctity as well as that place where the priest blesses it and grant all yet what doe all these paradoxes conclude for any particular kinde of worship or what wee are to worship whether the table or or both or whether these as relatives only to the sacrament for the sacraments sake or equally as the sacrament it selfe but let the doctor goe on why should any slave be more vile in the hight of his lord then wee before god nor is this grace greater then is ascribed by ecclesiasticall writers to the parts which our saviour conversed in to his spitle to his garments wee doe acknowledge a greater duty and distance and humility to bee used towards god then any slave can render to his lord wee dey no kinde of honour to god internall or externall only wee dare not present to him but according

to his owne command
but for relative instruments which we are to hold sacred for gods sake such as the ground whereon our saviour trod or his garment or his spitle or the altar wee are uncertaine how to reverence them according to our doctors opinion
the jewish manner of distance according to strictnesse is not to be maintained by the doctor himselfe and wee know no other kinde of worship used by the jewes neither when the arke was solemnly moved or removed doe wee read of any other reverence applied
and therefore to what purpose the doctor does urge the jewish example against us wee doe not see and if he will moderate his honour according to the equitable tenor of christs gospell wee shall willingly be informed by him
in two things the doctor leaves us unsatisfied and very uncertaine of his meaning first he does not cleerly and constantly nominate any distinct forme of reverence which he would have us use secondly he does not certainly and fully instruct us in the grounds and reasons of that reverence
first he sayes adoration in the law which was a very strict time against superstition was never without prostration and to this purpose he cites examples wherein men did civilly so fall downe before men and religiously before god but he gives us no instance at all wherin any such prostrate manner of worship was given to any third middle holy relative instrument betwixt god and man
wee say that bodily adoration may be given to man because it is but a meere civill act and for civill reasons and the mind is not subject to be misled thereby into superstition because the nature of man whom wee worship and the manner of adoration wherewith wee worship and

the civill reasons for which wee worship are so perfectly knowne to us
also wee worship god with bodily worship prostrating together our soules before him acknowledging that the highest kinde of divine worship is not competent for his majesty and herein also there is no feare of superstition because wee cannot erre in the excesse and therefore the doctor cannot either from divine or civill worship conclude any thing for his middle kinde of religious honour because in these relative instruments wee are to divide our soules and bodies not ascribing so much as to god nor so little as to man neither have wee any precept or precedent for this third kinde of worship in scripture but rather the contrary where do wee read in scripture that the iewes did bodily worship the arke or the altar or the tabernacle or temple or the footsteps or garments or spitle or sweate of our saviour as our doctor instances or how can he prove that any orthodoxe doctors in the primitive times did worship the gospells or crosse of our saviour is it sufficient for the doctor to say as things have beene in esteeme so religious persons have ever esteemed them how does this tautologie confute us but sayes the doctor the constant obeysance of israel in the wildernesse was towards the mount tabernacle fire cloude arke
and ezekiel saith at the gate they shall worship god for the gate of the temple was over against the and so towards the temple they did worship as well when they were farre distant in other lands as neere it
and so saint paul saith the converted gentile falling downe shall worship
answer here the doctor strives to prove religious worship by divine as if they were both the

same and not to bee distinguished
is there not a plaine difference betweene falling downe before the gates or towards the gates of the temple and to the gates or to the temple it selfe nay there is a difference in falling downe before or towards the house of god in mens mindes and it is most evident that even to the jewes did not fall downe before the house of god as the papists doe before their images
the papists say they fall not downe to but before the picture worshiping that which is represented not the thing representing but if so if they have the same reason to worship god represented in the image as the iewes had really and gratiously presentiall in the temple then why might they not fall downe towards their pictures being a hundred leagues distant as well as holding them in their hands for so the iewes did it was proper in daniel to set open his casements towards sion and to worship god in that posture and hereby hee made it evident that hee did not worship by reason of any motive arising from the meere building it selfe but meerly for the presence of god himselfe there residing
how fond would it ee if papists now should doe the like to their deities or if wee should doe the like to our altars except we did believe god to bee as presentiall in them as the jewes did in their this quite dashes the conceite of all memorative instruments for they which worship pictures or altars as being memorative only must needs confesse that they worship them otherwise then as daniel did the for he being absent was rather memorative of that for gods sake which there inhabited then that was memorative of god to him
besides if wee did believe that the glory and face of

god as the scripture sayes did as majestically dwell in our table as it did betweene the jewish cherubins yet the jewish example will not guide us to the adoration of the table only
solomon in his consecration names and blesses the whole house and prayes god to be favourable to all supplicants extending their hands to the whole house and so supplicants alwayes did extend their hands to the whole house
know one part of the church is more honourable then another but the whole is sufficiently memorative and so not the table more then any other part and if must distinctly worship according to the distinct degrees of holinesse how shall proportion my severall bowings in so many severall places at my first entrance into the house of god fall downe and worship that blessed name of god which sanctifies that place must needs ascend by degrees unto the table afterwards there to worship in a higher degree expecting there a greater blessing or a perfecter memory of my saviour doe not thinke that the jewish levites and priests did thus performe so many distinct worships much lesse could the people by that discipline
but in the second place let the doctor give us some certayne knowledge of the grounds and reasons of our worship and then wee shall guesse at the manner thereof the better
in this poynt the doctor in my opinion is very much staggerd and gives very uncertaine resolutions sometimes he saith that wee worship not the altar but god towards the altar and he that so worships a house for the owners sake worships not the house but the owner
sometimes hee saith that wee doe worship the altar it selfe but as damascen saith not undefined span alphabet not equally with god himselfe

and his reason why wee may doe this is because the altar is for god not an idol or against god
sometimes he saith that wee adore god in the place without separation of god from the place as wee adore whole christ the whole supposition in grosse the humanity as well as the divinity without abstraction of one from the other
generally the doctors ground is that wee are to worship the table as an holy relative instrument for wee cannot worship god except wee worship relative instruments for his sake but herein wee are left as uncertaine also as ever for all holy instruments are not holy alike nor to be reverenced alike and therefore in what ranke wee are to place the table or with what height to adore it is not described
to all these assertions something briefly must bee sayd in the first place therefore if no worship at all be given to the altar but to god towards the altar which is our owne acknowledgment then why is the altar so supereminently worshipt before any other relative instrument whatsoever at my entrance at the church dore may so worship god as well as at the altar and so when the font appeares to mee after my first entrance thus may as lowly as heartily adore god by reason of his gratious presence in his whole house or his particular relation to the font as at the altar and if it be said that god is not so highly present in any other part of the church or in all or in any other relative instrument which is a hard saying as in the table at all times yet this doth not infirme my inference for even before the font the same god being present by the same meanes of consecration my devotion may be as intense and as acceptable as before the altar
in the second place if it be confessed

that the altar it selfe is worshipt though not as god himselfe and that this is justifiable because the altar is no idol but a holy instrument and not against god but for god
answer first this is more then the jewes ever did or then any precept in scripture can warrant
secondly this is no more then the papists alleadge for their idolatry
thirdly this is contrary to reason for if god bee there extraordinarily present what neede wee honour any thing else but that extraordinary presence it selfe or how can wee without indignity indeed in civill worship when the king is absent we doe our reverence to his chayre but when the king sits there in person what man is so infatuated and voyd of discretion as to doe any honour to the chayre and for the absence of god that cannot be pleaded
but the doctor sayes in the third place that in this wee worship god and the place together without abstraction as wee doe both natures of our saviour
this answer in my opinion of all others is the worst and am perswaded there is scarce any jesuite that would not bee ashamed to say the like
in our saviour the godhead dwelt bodily undefined span alphabet and even the dead body of our saviour lying breathlesse in the grave divided from his humane soule was not separated wholly from the hypostaticall union of the godhead and shall this stupendious union be a resemblance of gods union with the table or tableplace am perswaded that seraphins did attend the buried carkasse of our saviour and adore it even resting in the tombe and this by reason of its union with the godhead but shall the doctors imagination create the like inseparable relation betwixt god and the table god deliver mee from

such audacious thoughts
but grant this and then where is the doctors religious middle worship betwixt civill and divine how can he maintaine this and yet maintaine with damascen too undefined span alphabet
in conclusion then the doctors shete anchor is the old maxime that all relative instruments are to bee worshipt for gods sake and since a worship saith he is due ex confesso then this worship is most proper
answer this rule of relation must needs be a very uncertaine fallible rule as to the manner of our worship and the degree thereof because wee can neither distinguish of the relations themselves as god values them neither can wee limit and proportion our respects accordingly
in the law nay before the law circumcision was a very venerable sacrament and gratious league betwixt god and man and yet in the act of circumcising there were no other knives used but such as were common and so after accounted and valued
so also the passeover amongst the jewes it was an ordinance more solemne and reverend then circumcision and yet in this great celebrity the jewes used no other then common tables and dishes wherewithall to eate their paschall lambe the type of jesus christ
moreover even now under the gospell in our baptizations of infants our ministers use consecrated water and sometimes common basons without any scruple or offence and yet wee cannot deny but that there is great honour due to that sacred ordinance as to the laver of regeneration it selfe
neither do these doctors that fight so violently pro aris seme at all to regard what honour wee ascribe to any other kind of sacred utensil whatsoever nay think if the patin or chalice should bee unconsecrated

wherein the body and bloud of our saviour is offered they would thinke it little to bee regarded
the honour and sanctity of the lords day is of late much lessened as if there were not the same relation in times as in places and feare that this swelling of in the church may grow as fatall to religion as the swelling of the spleene does many times to the body
but desire these doctors to consider that god ha's expressed himselfe to bee a jealous god in such cases as these more then in any other sinnes whatsoever nay in other offences hee proclaymes himselfe to be long suffering and patient but in the sole fruition of his worship and adoration he professes himselfe jealous over us and apt to take offence against us
does he not declare himselfe to the israelites as if he did purposely forbeare to appeare to them in any outward apprehensible forme and similitude that they might not adore the same pray what can be more worthy to bee adored in the whole world then such a representation what relative instrument can bee so holy as the ocular dispensation or sensible displaying of gods most inscrutable essence in what figure soever it was opened to the eye or eare yet god wee see was not delighted to be so worshipped by the meanes of any such externall instrument but he did rather avoyde and refuse such bodily worship and did deny gratious apparitions that they might not remaine in the mindes of men as instruments of devotion and if god did not affect to bee adored in any heavenly resemblance of his owne apprehended by any humane sense all such apprehension being utterly unworthy of this infinite majesty why should wee imagine that it can be pleasing now to him to be adored in a

or wooden table but all our doe not make this their ground of worship that the altar is the same now as the arke was formerly or that the table is solium christi wherein christ is supposed to sit majestically and gloriously for this will be very hard to bee proved and thinke the papists are scarce so grosse
ironsides ground is not that god doth reside in the table as in the but that he is there strangely and efficaciously commemorated wee worship not saith he the table nor any thing set upon the table but christ as the messias slaine for the table is only a memorative instrument unto which the assistance of grace is never fayling either to beget in our mindes thoughts of christs death or to extract from us a worship of him if wee bee not wanting to our selves
he cites cajetan thomas aquinas and gerson to prove that the learnedst of papists hold no more
so then doctor lawrence is confuted out of the papists themselves if he worship the table for gods sake relatively or together with christ without abstraction this is idolatrous
the ground of this opinion is that consecratio non tantum est opus sed efficax
god is in a speciall manner present in consecrated things and places to assist us and stirre up devotion in us if wee resist not his assistance so that though they have no reall quality of holinesse or vertue in them yet by their very consecration they gaine a certaine fitnesse to stirre up holy thoughts
but in the first place if the meere act of consecration be so peremptorily vigorous ex opere operatio yet this concludes nothing for adoration
the words of the evangelists relating the passion of our saviour and the sermons of good divines have more then an aptnesse of commemoration

in them yet wee worship not either the gospells or the preachers thereof
it a meere memorative aptnesse bee maintained and that to bee all the ground of our worship then why shall not all things of the like nature procure from us the same adoration if looke upon a crosse or picture or upon the sunne or moone and by that memorative aptnesse which is in them finde thoughts of reverence and piety begotten in mee why shall not according to the doctors advice embrace all occasions and furtherances of devotion and so fall downe before them and if more then a memorative aptnesse bee maintained and some higher vertue transfused into an altar meerly by its consecration then into other things wee desire further proofe thereof
secondly if consecration bee admitted to bee so infallibly vigorous as to imply gods holy presence yet this claymes worship not only to the altar but also to the font and to all other consecrated things places and times and this involves us in many doubts
for if must worship at the altar more then at the font or more then at the first view of the whole fabrick yet how much oftner how much more must worship at the altar then in other places the consecration of the whole building has vertue to beget pious thoughts in mee when first approach it and finde in mee a holy commemoration must now stay my worship till come to the altar there to expect yet a more vertuous commemoration or must bow at my entrance with lesse reverence and then bow more lowly at the altar afterwards what must be the severall measures of my worship thirdly this worship by way of motive is not agreable to that of the jewes for daniel in his worship remembers

that house wherein god was dreadfully strangely present and so directs his posture dingly but the house of god is no motive instment to him to remember god and therefore relative object or occasion of his devotion if
papists had the same grounds for their adora as daniel had they would worship their altars
images at as great a distance as daniel did the jish temple being a captive at babylon
but now as the occasion so the nature of their worship is farre different from the jewish and by their downe before present objects only it plainly appeares that they make those present things only the occasions of their posture but even the objects of their adoration it selfe wish therefore our doctors would not mingle so far with as they doe or if they will yet they would speak so upbraidingly of those which feare to the like
will not say they are in the gall oh bitternesse but their invectives witnesse too that the gall of bitternesse is in them
against satan though all evill might beene said said none but satan having nothing justly to object against michael yet forbare evill
wish the doctors hereafter would rather tate michael then satan

[Figure: [leaf motif]A declaration made by the Archbishop of Collen, vpon the deede of his mariage, sent to the States of his Archbishoprike.
VVith the letter of Pope Gregorie the against the celebration of the same mariage, and the Bishops aunswer therevnto.
¶To the right reuerend Father in God Iohn, Bishoppe of London, Thomas Delone, wisheth increase of grace, and continuall happinesse, both of body and soule.
IT is not vnknowne to the learned, nor of the wise forgotten, (right reuerend Father) in what miserable seruitude, intollerable tormentes, heauines of heart, and griefe of conscience, the godlie hath from time to time continued vnder the tyranny of superstitious Popes and Prelates of Rome, whose intollerable pride is of the Lord detested, and of all christian people abhorred, through whose hipocrisie the world hath been so long deceaued many thousand soules drawne fro~ the truth, to the abhominable seruice of idolatry, forsaking the lawes and co~mau~dements of God, to followe the vanities traditions of men.
Neuerthelesse, they are not ashamed most impudently to challenge to themselues the name and title of Catholiques and the seruants of Christ, yet treadeth his word vnder feete, despising his holy ordinances and institutions, and as it were in despite of his glory, follow the works of their owne imaginations.
But after the world had of long time beene blinded, by the notable dissimulation of this deceauing church· the Lord of his mercy and loue, sending the light of his holy worde, for the reliefe of his afflicted flocke plainly discouered their hipocrisie, and their filthines to all flesh.
Wherby it is come to passe that many worthy personages, lately liuing in darknes and ignorance, is now turned to the trueth, with most earnest repentance of their former life.
And among the rest, through the great mercy and grace of God, this worthy Prince, bishop of Collen, Ghebbard, whose hart being opened, and his eyes cleared, hath most effectually showne the fruites of his vnfained repentance, and hauing made declaration therof throughout his dominions and iurisdictions, hath abolished the abhominable masse, and in steed thereof planted the euerlasting glorious Gospel of Christ, to the great comfort of many grieued and wounded co~sciences.
Which when the Pope perceiued, knew with great flattery and adulation, he sought to withdraw him fro~ this most godly christian enterprise, charging him with the othe he made to the church Apostolique, with his duty towards God, which he both by scripture, but specially by their owne lawes, counsell, decrees, doth manifestly defend, by the fame approue, that he hath done nothing against his othe or duty in any respect: and the rather dooth he reproue them by their owne aucthoritie, for as much as the same is the greatest confutation that maye be against them.
And because the same was done by a worthy person of noble race and parentage, and a bishop by office calling, thought none more meete for the patron of such a specialty, the~ your Lordship, vnto whome owe all duty reuerence, who for the good will borne to your Lordshippe, hath dedicated vnto you this simple translation, faithfully iustlie done according to the coppy.
Trusting you will accept the same according to the worthines therof, and be a defence against all that shall seeme to mislike of the matter: and in so doing, you shall binde me for euer at your co~maund· vnto whome wish continuall prosperity in this present life, in the world to come ioyes euerlasting.
¶A Christian declaration touching the Religion which the right reuerend Prince, the Lord Ghebbard, chosen, and confirmed Archbishop of Collen, Elector of the Empire, and Chancelor for the Prouince of Italie, Duke of Westphalie and Enghern, and proclaimed throughout his dominions, the
WE Ghebbard, by the grace of God elected, and confirmed Archbishop of Collen, Chancellor for the prouince of Italie, Elector of the Empire, Duke of Westphalie, Enghern, &c. to ye Estates, Earles, Gentlemen, Citizens, subiects, of our Archbishoprike ingenerall, and to euerie one particular, and to all other vnder our obedience.
Know you by this present, all aboue named, and euerie of you, as we neuer had nothing more in minde, since it pleased God to call vs to the estate office of this our Archbishoppe, by a lawfull election (which yet we also haue) then the safegard and defence of this Archbishop sea and electorshippe, committed vnto vs by God, and likewise of Germanie, one part of vs, principally in that which co~cerneth the glorie of God: and hauing had most humble supplications requests, made vnto vs by some of the Estates and Nobles of our dominions, ioyned with earnest sute of the most noblest Estates of this great and mightie Empire, to haue the Gospell publiquely preached, and the Sacramentes administred in all places of our dominions: as it is ordained and appointed by the word of God.
Following the articles, and confession of Auspourg, and the christian exposition thereof, according to the will of God, which is that Iesus Christ his sonne, should of vs be hearkened vnto, and his commaundementes obserued and kept: that all Princes and Magistrates of this world; might open their gates to the king of glory, that thereby we may learne to knowe our duety in the charge to vs committed, knowing there is no excuse for vs, at the last day, when Christ shall come in iudgement: what time we must render account of the charge and office wherein he hath placed vs.
For if by vs the way of saluation should be stopt toward our subiectes, being nothing ignorant thereof, God which is a iust and seuere Iudge, vnto whose will and commaundement we are all bound to obey (& that without dissimulation) would not sée it vnreuenged.
We for these causes, vnderstanding the humble peticio~s of our sayd States and subiectes, are determined no longer to deferre the graunt of their iust and rightfull request, hauing had the aduise of our Lords and counsayle, and after great deliberation we haue permitted, to our aforesayd subiects, vnder the dominion of our Archbishop sea, of what state or condition soeuer, not only the libertie of their conscience (alwayes agréeing to the word of GOD) but also assuraunce by this our present ordinaunce, and by vertue therof, that they shall not be grieued, molested, or troubled in their personnes, dignities, honors, or goods, by any gouernors, Iustices, or other inferiour magistrates, whatsoeuer.
For the profession of their faith, co~science, rule of Religio~, being according to Gods word the confessio~ of Auspurg.
Graunting fréely to al prelats, Earles, Lords, Cities, towns, wt all other our commons subiects vnder our Archbishop sea, Electorship, ful libertie to vse publique preaching in all parts of our dominion, to exercise the administratio~ of the holy Sacraments, as it is ordained by the writings of the Apostles Prophets, folowing ye Christian exposition of Auspurg, notwithsta~ding all impeachments of our Lieutenants and Magistrates, or other persons whatsoeuer: assuring for the same (as it is the duty and office of a christian Prince) of all and euerie vnder our dominion and iurisdiction, to defende and maintaine them through the helpe and grace of GOD, being certainly perswaded, that his almightie power hath béene the onely direction of this our christian enterprise, and that he will defend his glory and holy worde, against all the gates of hell.
Moreouer we protest before the maiestie of almightie God, which is the searcher of the hearts and raines, that we haue not taken in hand this godlie and christian enterprise, moued by ambition or desire of honour, or any other thing to our particuler profit and commoditie: but for the glorie of Christe Iesus our onely sauiour and redéemer, and the aduancement of his holy word, and for the eternall felicitie and saluation of our subiectes, which he hath giuen vs in charge.
Neither haue we done it to rayse discord and discention in the common wealth, but rather to set and establish one christian order, in the Churches and Schooles of this cou~trey, as it is thought conuenient, by the counsayle and aduise of the principall of our Estates: minding to take delyberation and aduise vpon the reformation of the Churches and Schooles of our sayd Archbishop sea, Electorship, at the first assembling of our States Lordes, as soone as oportunitie shall serue.
Admonishing the while all those vnder the óbedience of our fore+sayd Elector, which shall be moued to imbrace and follow the religio~ established at Auspourg, and the expositions of the same, agéeing to the worde of God, behauing themselues in all modesty, as it becommeth all such as are led by true christian zeale.
Forbidding them expresly, that they shall doo no wrong nor iniury to any in déede, or in wordes, to the ende that euerie one of them maye liue quietly and peaceably one with an other.
And for the perticular safegarde of our person, if it come to passe by the will of God, that we should ioyne our selues in mariage, to the end that none might take occasion to blame vs, as doing the same against our duety, séeking thereby some perticular profite or commodity, or that our inte~t were, to leaue to our heires some aduantage, to the preiudice of our sayd Archbishop sea, or Electorship, and to gratifie the same against all reason or henestie.
We protest by this our publique writing, and before the eternall euerliuing God, that the same was neuer our purpose or intent: that is to say, to drawe vnto our heires, our sayd Archbishop sea, or to bring them to any right of the same succession, or for any other perticular profite to their commoditie.
And for this cause we will haue it openly declared, by the publication, of this our present ordinaunce, that whosoeuer shall hereafter come, the election ought to remaine at libertie, vnto the consent of ye rest of our most noble Electors (as heretofore it hath béene) and after our decease, to be resigned without force.
And for this cause, all and euerie of our subiectes and other personnes vnder the obedience of our Archbishop and Electorship, shall vnderstand, that they are not held, or bou~d to owe any obedience, or in any respect to reuerence, any man whatsoeuer (as their true and rightfull Lord) tyll such tune, as by the consent and councell of our Electors, the Prince which shall succéed, be lawfullie and righfullie chosen.
And that they shall not acknowledge, or take for their Prince, any that shall enterprise to take it in ha~d, without the ordinarie and lawfull election of our aforesayde Electors, and the expresse declaration of him which shall succéede, by their aucthoritie: as it hath béene obserued by long and auncient custome (notwithstanding any disposition heretofore made by vs, or any other preposed) against this our present ordinaunce: but without regard therof, we vtterly at this present, and for the time to come, declare them of no effect.
Abrogated and abolished them in the straitest manner and forme that maye be, being ready at all times to conferre, and take more deliberation vpon the same, with our aforesayde Electors and States of our prouince, making them such confirmation and assuraunce of this our present promise, in such maner that no daunger, nor feare, or other damageable enterprise maye come or happen, for any such matter by vs, or by our heires.
Therefore, we charge and commaund, all and euerie of our Lordes, gouernors, magistrates, Iudges, Treasurers, Receauers, Consulles, Citizens, commons, and all in generall, diligently, and straitly, to obserue this our present commaund, that euerie one may be maintained according therevnto.
And that they may neither hurt, or doo iniurie to any, nor they of any, be iniuried or molested, for whosoeuer shall herein be found faultie, shall incurre our indignation and displeasure, and shall not escape most grieuous punishment: for this is the truth of our last charge and commaundement.
In witnesse whereof, we haue published, and imprinted, and sealed with our seale, this our present declaration, causing it to be caried into all partes and places of our dominions, vnto such, as shall make it known to all.
¶Pope Gregorie the to our right reuerend and beloued brother, Ghebbard Archbishop of Collen, Prince, and Elector of the Empire.
RIght reuerend beloued brother, the great woorthy personage, procéeding from the Noble house of Truchces, your auncient honorable progenitors, as well in auncient time, as of fresher memorie, hath left vs sufficient witnes of the worthines thereof, and nobilitie of their blood: whose affection and constancie, hath alwaies béene manifestlie declared towardes the catholique faith, but principallie, by Cardinall Augustus, which held the first seate hereof, vnder whose discipline you haue béene most religiouslie and holilie brought vp, as it was co~uenient for ye holie Church of Rome, in such manner as there was no small hope conceaued of you, trusting that you will shew your selfe a person worthy so noble a race, by the like instruction: from whence hath growne the fatherly good will, which hitherto we haue borne vnto you: which we haue not onely since that time entertained, but also in like manner augmented, by the meanes of the good report of honorable personages: which promised vnto vs all things with you most excelle~t iust.
After it came to passe, that you were elected by the charter of Collen· to the dignitie Archbishop sea of this church, and although that election was disturbed by sundrie manifold difficulties, in such sort that it was not onlie stronglie withstoode, but in a maner vanquished made vaine.
Neuerthelesse, we vsed such benignitie towards you, that all impeachmentes reiected, we approued and allowed the iudgement and election, made by the same charter for you.
Increasing the force and vertue of our Apostolique co~firmation: by reason whereof we are persuaded, that there is none which ought to beare greater reuerence to the holie seate of Rome, nor that ought to be a greater obseruer of the ecclesiasticall discipline, then you, hoping that we should haue had great helpe, through your constancie fidelitie.
But it doth greatly displease vs, and merueilously grieue vs, that our hope therein is not onely weakned and made lesse, but also vtterly lost.
And further, we vnderstand from day to day, by the letters of many, and the report of diuerse, such thinges of you, so vnworthy the dignitie degrée wherein you are, that without great shame, we are not able to expresse it.
And although verilie we haue oftentimes refused to beléeue such vnworthy reportes, yet the daylie clamor hath constrained vs greatlie to doubte thereof, being afraid of your fall, which now we wil no lo~ger dissemble, wherfore we doo admonishe you, that you would haue a regard and a foresight to your honour and saluation (while it is time) and if possible you haue gone any further, then reason required, spéedilie withdraw your selfe, that those things which heretofore hath béen declared of you, may be proued false (which is our onlie desire) that you will openly manifest your mind ful intent, inwardlie co~ceiued in your hart: to ye end, that your good name, princelie parentage, the ecclesiasticall order, be not by your means for euer stained, wt ignominius reproch, by ye aduersaries of our honor.
Againe, consider your duty towards God, which hath raised you to the dignitie and degrée of the sea Apostolique, which you should cherish with singuler affection and fauour, and for the same it is that you ought to spend your blood in all christian profession: For by how much the more you are of hie calling, and honourable estate, by so much the more is your fault greater, then any others, when you fall from any parte of your duety.
And by so much the more, wil your fault be greater, as you were of honour and dignitie, in the church of God, and in great aucthoritie with the Princes of the Empire.
Consider then what troubles and dau~gers procéedeth from such new remoouings of thinges, and how héedfull the prudent and godlie man ought to be, from hazarding so lightly his honour, state, dignitie, and his soule, whereof there hath béen so many straunge and wonderfull examples in our time, which may make vs to be better aduised in our dealings, but if we haue possible suffered somewhat to much in former time, attribute the same to our affection towards you, and to the desire we haue had of your honor and dignitie.
Neither doo we any thing doubt, but that this our fatherly kindnes, shall be receaued of you with that effect which it ought to be, for many good reasons and iust causes: and that you will not forgette to shew due reuerence towardes this holy seate, that we maye acknowledge you, for our déere and beloued sonne, as heretofore we haue done, which wil be an occasion to vs greatly to reioyce: and because we haue not thought it sufficient to send our letters onely, we haue sent our reuerend Brother, the Archbishop of Treues, to take his iourney towardes you, to conferre more at large, of these our affaires, who shall more cléerelye discouer vnto you our will, counsayle, and intent, to whome we are assured that you will giue both faith and credite.
Giuen at Rome, at saint Peters in the yéere of our Lord
Ghebbard Archbishop of Collon, Prince, and Elector of the Empire, sendeth greeting.
Haue vnderstood by your letter, your fatherlie affection, and worthinesse of such a Prelate, but in this principally, that you will not lightlie giue place, to vntrue tales, neither faith to the euill reports spread abroad of my actions and déeds.
For if it were sufficient to accuse, who should be in these corrupted dayes excused, wherein the most godliest men, are assailed with enuie and what is he that can defend himselfe against the conspiracies of euil willers, acknowledge you as a good father, exhorting me to perseuere in the faith, integrete good discipline, and obedience vnto the Chatholique, Apostolique, and true beléeuing Church.
Giuing me aduertisement of the great and manifold daungers, falling on those, which are desirous of nouelties, which folowing their disordinate lustes and affections, are drawne from the company of the Apostolique church.
Wherefore my duty is to accept of your charitable holie admonitions, knowing that which is said by Salomon, that he which refuseth discipline, hath no regarde of his owne soule: but he that harkeneth to correction, shall obtaine knowledge.
must néedes confesse, that haue béene ouer slacke and negligent in thinges appertaining to the saluatio~ of my soule, the rest of my conscience, and the duetie owe to the glorie of God, and the dignitie of the Church.
But your letters hath serued me as a spurre, pricking me forward, greatly prouoking me, yt all dissimulation laid aside, all superstition by me reiected, am minded openly to declare (euen as you haue admonished me) yt which haue conceaued in my heart, considering the faith owe vnto GOD, that hath called me to this his degrée, that which owe to the church Apostolique to my countrey, the publique wealth thereof, and also to my selfe, knowing the saying of that great and holie man Augustine to be true, and worthy to be had in memory, that there is none that doth more harme to the flocke of Christ then such as cou~terfetteth the lambe in the roome and office of the ministerie, the same is cited
For as much then am come to the age, wherein am able without the aduice of others to gouern my selfe, and by the onely will of our Lord Iesus Christe, which hath vouchsaued to call me to the great charge of an Archbishop: and as it is a thing proper to the nature of a christian man, to inquire and followe after the trueth, am setled in the furtheraunce of this good worke, without musing at all, on any custome or humaine authority: finding by the holie scriptures, and amo~g the ecclesiasticall histories, yt this which we haue commaunded to be done, beco~meth him which is the child of God: and which is also required in the office himself hath already established, yt is to say, Iesus Christ, which is ye only way, the trueth, and the life, in whose name, as also with the Father and the holie Ghost we are baptised: to whome appertaineth ye catholique church, hauing redéemed ye same by his precious blood.
Upon this foundation is the church sustained, being also beautified and inriched with most excellent tytles, which he hath giuen by S. Paule in the first to Timothy, the third chapter: calling her the house of ye liuing God, the fortitude strength of the trueth.
Then the Romane church which was in the time of S. Paule, and certaine yéeres after, was of great renoume and estimation, for the faith they had in Iesus Christ, and at that time taught through the whole world: the which faith was her onelie ornament, insomuch that the Priests Elders of the same Romane Church, plainly co~fessed, writing to S. Ciprian in his
booke, in these words, That letting the honor praise decay, which S. Paule gaue to the Romanes, was a great grieuous crime, and yt it had béene lesse shame, neuer to haue had those prayses spoke of, or preached abroade, then after the publishing thereof, to lose the honour of such high commendations.
Therfore as often as it comes in question, to speake of the pure, true, Apostolique, and vniuersall church: reason requireth, and all wise men giueth counsaile, that we ought to discerne betwéene that, which is grou~ded vpon the head corner stone, Christ, vpon the holy Gospell (the honour and name wherof shal endure euerlastingly:) and that which is ye bastard church, going against the trueth· worshippeth God in vaine, following after the commau~dements traditions of men.
And therfore ye golde~ rule of Tertullian, hath euer pleased al good and vertuous men, saying, that the first hath béen alwayes the truth, that which came afterward corrupted, and that is it which hindeth mee to the othe which haue made, which othe dooth co~maund, that must acknowledge the sayde Apostolique church, which holdes the ancient beléefe of the Romane church, agréeing to the beléefe of Nice, and of Constantinople, which dooth acknowledge and beléeue one baptisme for remission of sinnes, by ye blood of our Lord Iesus Christ: which is our onely purgatorie that cleanseth vs of all our sinnes, which receaueth no other traditions then this only, that are appointed by the Apostles, leauing deliuering faithfully, that which they receiued from our Lord Iesus Christ.
After whose example am bounde by my othe, to take the holy scriptures, interpreting and vndersta~ding the same, not after the sence or interpretation of any Bishop or Councell, whatsoeuer, but after the vnderstanding and exposition of the true, Apostolique, and holy mother Church, that (I say) which hath followed the steps of the holy Apostles.
Whervnto the auncient Fathers hath from time to time consented, so that without any blemish to the othe which haue made, am addressed after this rule, bound to this fou~dation, neither will receyue or beléeue any thing, which is not brought from the same, wheresoeuer it was writte~, whether at Rome, or at Trent, being reasonable to prefer these auncie~t things with new, the truth with falsehood, the traditio~s of the Apostles, with ye co~mau~dements of men.
For our lawes as it dooth euidently appeare in the
distinctio~ of ye third canon: doth not alowe these auncient and most renoumed Councelles the like aucthority, as they do to the holie Scriptures Apostles, which sayth thus: The holy church of Rome, after the writinges of the old and new Testament, which we receiue for certaine rules, doth not forbid but that we may receiue the Councell of Nice, of Constantinople, Ephesus, and of Chalcedonae.
Thus haue hytherto shewed, what was the band and foundation of yt othe which lent, vpo~ the which protest, that (by the grace of God) will not starte nor turne, from the true faith in Iesus Christe, nor seperate my selfe from the holy and Apostolique church, to the which do owe all reuerence, as wil doo all my life: in remembrance of that which did vowe in baptisme to God, and promised to the Church.
For the rest, it is out of doubt betwéene all good and learned men, that whatsoeuer we haue promised or sworne, if it be wrong contrarie to our first faith, receyued in baptisme, that it bindeth vs not at all, this (I saye) is to be seene by the rule of the right cannon Lawe, that is to say, that an oth taken against good and godlie workes, bindeth not: and following the right cannon, the othes that are made against good déeds, drawes vs vnto sinne.
Wherevpon the Maister of Sentences hath wiselie sayd, in the
Distinction after Saint Hierome, that an othe hath three proper companiens, veritie, iudgement, and iustice, and if any of these lacke, it is not a true othe, but a false othe: But Gratia~ giueth these aduertiseme~ts vpo~ the déede of an oth, Euil promises (saith he) breakes faith, chaunge therfore the the ordinaunce of euill and dishonest thinges, and do not that, which thou hast vnwiselie promised, for that promise is against God, which is accomplished with wickednesse.
In the seuenth cannon of our lawe, we haue a rule giuen, which we ought straitlie to obserue, not onely for the regard of othes, but in all the actions of our life (that is to say) that if by the sutteltie of our craftie enimie, we are falling into any faulte, we must séeke to escape it, by that meanes which we sée is least hurtfull and daungerous: thus you sée, that the olde and auncient Fathers hath generally concluded, that all vndiscrete and vnlawfull othes, ought not to be obserued and kept: and that it is more tollerable for to breake an othe, then to perseuere in the sinne of fornication.
The same is also learned by the aucthority of S. Augustine that if faith be not obserued, to the intent to returne to the right waye, it cannot be called ye violating of faith, for as much that the same is not true faith, which is requisite to commit sinne.
It is easie to shew by many learned men, and also by the holie scriptures, and by the auncient Doctors, that partly the slacknes and slouthfulnes: and partly by the couetousnes and malice of many Popes, sundrie things hath crept in ye Romane church, as Platinus (though otherwise greatly affectionated to ye Roman seat) certifieth that those things do not agree to the Apostolique catholique church, but they are notably iniurious against Iesus Christ, which is established for to be the redéemer of peace, by the faith in his blood, also most idolatrous, which whosoeuer should followe of a trueth, should sinne greeuouslie against God: and yet as Arnobius sayeth in his seuenth booke against the Gentiles, that· we ought to forgiue liberally and fréely, though it were against the Church, and against our owne conscience.
For these thinges then, am not drawne through any cause by you, (as many other great woorthy personages hath taken occasio~, to withdraw themselues) not from the catholique church, but fro~ the corruption abuses, which turneth vpside downe the foundation thereof.
wil not for this time enter into long disputation, but would rather come to the crime, wherein fell my selfe by you most accused.
sée, sée, or at the least, féele a certaine smell, that cannot be lesse then a sinnefull thing, the peine whereof, craueth the losse of my life, or of my charge and dignitie: for the which am accused among you, which maketh me most odious, maketh the world to thinke, that reiect all discipline, all duety, and all honour, but the shame thereof (falselie accusing me) maketh your selues almoste to blush.
Which is, because am purposed to marie, which S. Paule neuerthelesse affirmeth, to be honourable amo~g all men: and which is also sette in the Romane church, among the number of the Sacramentes.
But whensoeuer am minded to accomplishe this thing, what shall doo, or enterprise against the examples of the holy Apostles, and their rules and decrees? What doo against the aduise of Clement, Alexandrian? or against our owne Lawes, in the
Chapters, where mention is made of the wiues of Priests, and Deacons, being aboundantly contained in the
cannon, as it was decreed by the Councell of Gangar, that, If any reiect a maried Priest, being of opinion that he ought not to offer, because he is maried, and for that cause will not come to his seruice, let him be accurst.
Moreouer, those words spoken with great grauitie by Paphuntius, in the Councell of Nice, are co~mended in the second parte of their decrée, which did not feare to call mariage the second degree of chastitie.
Wherefore is it then that the aucthoritie of Siricius or Pelagious, should be of greater waight among vs, then that of the Apostles? Of generall Counselles? Of auncient Fathers before mentioned? Or of GOD himselfe? Which plainly pronounced, that it was not good for man to be alone.
What follie, or what madnesse praye you is it then, to endure rather adulterers, fornicators, and Sodomiticall liuers, in the ministerie and church of Christ, then those which hath true lawfull wiues, following the co~maundements of God? From what spring, or from whose mouth came the same doctrine, which forbiddeth and condemneth mariage? It appeareth by the eleuenth chapter of Daniel, vers.
Aeneus Silueus, in his discription of Germany, witnesseth that the holy bishoppe Vldricus, strongly withstoode the lawes of Celebat, against the Popes of his time, writing an Epistle vnto Pope Nicholas, wherin he greatly co~plained that the chiefest Prelates, and Priests (namelie of Italy,) were so much giuen to lust and lecherie, that they would not abstaine from deflowring, maid, wife, or any other, nor spare theyr owne kindred, but commit sinne against nature, with ye masquelin sort, also with very brute beasts: and there he declareth an historie worthy the noting, that Pope Gregorie the first, being he, that did first forbid ecclesiastical persons to marie, sending afterwarde, certaine fishers to fishe in a mote, hard adioyning to a Nunrie, they founde more then six thousand childrens heads that had béene throwne therein, which when Gregorie sawe, and perceyued the wicked fruit of his Celebat, sorowing to heare the same, he brake that decree, alledging the sentence of S. Paul, that, It is better to marie then to burne: Adding also, that it is farre better to suffer mariage, then to be the cause of murder.
The Abbot Vspergus also in his Chronicle, maketh mention of an epistle in the most renoumed cou~cell of the ecclesiasticall states at Bresse Nore, made against Heldebrand, wherin among other things, was a co~plaint made, yt he deuorsed spyrituall persons from theyr wiues, vnder this detestable Pope, the Churches were in great daunger, also he declared yt they were not bound in any promise to the Pope, for it is a greater thing to make a vow to obey God, and the catholique church, then to submitte our selues to the will and pleasure of any Pope, whatsoeuer.
For these reasons, that knoweth my duetie towarde Iesus Christe, and his Church, am determined to take the lawfull way and remedy, permitted to all manner of men (without exception) against euill and disordinate lustes, as it becommeth a true bishop, and a man of noble race to doo: to the ende, that may keepe my soule chaste, and arme the same against all allurements of the flesh.
Therefore am determined to enter into mariage, not being mooued by any light or disobedient minde: but after long tryall made of my selfe, haue knowne that it is not good for me to liue vnmaried.
Which gifte is not permitted to all, nor for euer, (that is to say, to make so long a triall of themselues:) am resolued, following the lawes of the church aboue mentioned, to leaue that vndiscrete vow of the Celebat, which is not in my power to performe, estéeming that this is lawful for me, for the auoiding of a greater euill, and for the better obseruing accomplishing the vowe of chastitie, which made vnto Iesus Christ: and in so dooing haue framed my selfe according to the commau~dement of God, submitting to his prouidence, and staying to his protection, not caring what euill men may iudge, nor for ye threatnings, daungers, or any other thing whatsoeuer, hauing in memorie that which Theodorus hath written in his fourth booke, the tenth chapter, of the auncient Christians.
Whiche dyd knowe no greater griefe then the renouncing of pietie: and although the tyrants went about raging and running vpon them, as stormes, or tempestes, yet could they not be shaken or put backe from pietie and godlines.
Therefore, in all extremities, haue recourse to the iudgement of those which hath right intelligence and knowledge.
Unto whome doo appeale and submit my selfe, after the example of Iustinus Martyr, in his Apolligie for the Christia~s.
In this submission most rightfull and iust, that by those which religiously feareth God the trueth alone is reuerenced, and to the same, all and euerie thing must be agréeing.
Nowe addresse my selfe to you Pope Gregorie, to the ende may obtaine of you this my purpose, (being most chaste and according to the discipline of the true and auncient Catholique Church) some protection and defence.
Therefore doo earnestlie pray and beseech you, that of the same affection which it hath pleased you to admonish me, that you will take my part in my most iust enterprise, remembring that those which smothlie flatters you, (a sort of bribe takers, which dooth but lightlie and softlie touch the moste daungerous woundes) bee not those that dooth most honour, and reuerence vnto you and the Church: but well are they, which Plutarch speakes of, in his Trentes of the difference betweene the flatterer and the friend: which boldlie and lyberallie speaketh, admonishing, and rebuking, not according to theyr owne appetie and desire.
What am then that should speake or brall against the Popes? if they take all that they say out of the word, lawes and commaundementes of God, and out of the writings of the Apostles and Prophetes, vppon which doctrine, the Church and the Popes, ought to be founded and builded; by GOD which hath the sufferaintie ouer Kinges and Popes.
Oh that it were the good will and pleasure of him, that might see the daye, that you would not take the care to oppresse me, and all other men, louers and followers of the doctrine and life of the Apostles: but rather that you should earnestlie vndertake to cast farre away from you, so many vanities, so many idolatries, simonies, and sacrileges, and cut off these effeminates, fornicators, and adulterers, drunkardes, and idle personnes, which our owne lawes dooth excommunicate, to the ende that the Romane church, might recouer her auncient dignitie, and that peare and tranquilitie might come againe, among all Christians.
that many grieued and wounded consciences might finde rest and consolation.
Nowe as it is commonlie sayde, that of a poore gardener, or a simple man, something may be heard of reasonable sence: so hope that you will not take this my small admonition, otherwise, then with a fatherlie, religious, and equitable hart: which is made vnto you by one of your Brothers in Iesus Christ, and an Almayn, which could neuer dissemble, wherevppon, praye God to kéepe you in his protection.

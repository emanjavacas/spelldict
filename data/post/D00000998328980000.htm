the occasion of the ensuing discourse and dispute with george vvhitehead
meeting with george fox accidentally octob

and falling into disecurse with him amongst other things told him he would prove him and the quakers deceivers and such as people ought not to hear or follow but to account accursed asked him if he would give it under his hand said yes hidding him appoint time and place he did so appointing the thursday next following or that present day in the afternoon being tuesday refused it saying he was to go that day out of town but asked if he would do it the next time they came to town which might be about a fourtnight after in case they gave him notice of their coming two or three dayes before having before engaged to a friend in lincolnshire to go a journey to see him and appointed him to meet him mile off his home octob

told he could not nor would engage that both because he might be not well then and because if well he might be out of town having engaged a journey about such time as he spoke of
but at any time when he should be in town and well when it might stand with his conveniencie before a competent number of people where he might be heard he should be ready to do it
to which purpose also the said posted up some papers the same day to warn people of them charging them to the same effect as above and adding that he should be ready to make it good when there to lawfully called the of the said moneth notice was given to that george fox was to come to town the next day and expected that should make good his charge replied that he could not do so nor was engaged to it being fore ingaged a journey in which he had appointed his friend to meet him octob

and that that journey he had signified before to and thereupon positively had denied to engage himself to make good his said charge at their next coming and that he had publikely given notice of his being to go that journey in the congregation the lords day before as was notoriously known
they threatned then to post him up if he stayed not as going away from it neverthelesse to perform his to his friend went his journey and they though he reminded in a letter he left for him of what had past between them as coming to town viz and not only aspersed the said as refusing to stand to his charge against them but also incivilly and unreasonably in his absence posted him as failing in his promise and going away on purpose their impudency in which remonstrated to the people in papers posted up in answer to theirs at his return
about jan
came to lin and about the
or
day provoked by a letter full of high vaunting language like goliah or one of the sons of anak boasting of the nature he was in and what they could and should do to make good his charge against them which after some overtures of time and place at length agreed upon to be done in the chancel of on jan
the charge proved and managed against him was thus
being come together into the chancel of and places being by either of us and our friends taken after some appeal to the lord and desire of his presence for making out his truth and giving testimony to it and stopping the mouth of iniquity the said entred upon his charge or proof of it to this purpose
people am come hither to make good a charge formerly laid by me against the people call'd quakers viz to prove them to be deceivers and such as people ought not to hear or to follow but to account them accursed
hope you will judge it but reasonable that have liberty without interruption to produce what have to say by way of proof of it which shall desire to observe this method in

shall shew that there are some people that we ought not to follow but account accursed and who or what manner of people they be
and then
shall in the strength and name of the lord for come not in my own strength or name to do it prove that the people called quakers and amongst them this george whitehead are such people
for the first shall desire you to minde gal
for if we or an angel from heaven preach another gospel or preach unto you other then that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed
to which we may joyne cor
if any man love not the lord jesus christ let him be anathema maranatha cursed the lord cometh or at the coming of the lord
and in john
if any man come to you and bring not this doctrine confesse not or magnifie not christ come in the flesh receive him not to house neither bid him god speed
but shall observe some things from the first mentioned scripture viz gal

if we or an angel from heaven
where note that we are not to receive any man upon his pretence of being an apostle or one sent of god
such as pretend to be so sent and to have seen or spoken with christ or to be immediately sent of god may be of those that we are to account accursed for the apostle says if we and again if paul preach another doctrine yea and so in rev
we read of some that sayd they were apostles and were not but were found lyars
againe it is not enough that men come as angells from heaven to induce us to receive them it is no angell like appearance either in their excellent speech speaking like angells vanting that they are in the spirit and power of god nor any angell like carriage in appearing humility holynesse sinlesnesse that should presently make us conclude such and such men are of god even such also may be persons to be accounted accursed by us
for even satan himself is transformed into an angell of light and no marvaile if his messengers or emissaries transforme themselves into ministers of righteousnesse as the apostle sayes
cor
these things then be not the certain characters to know men to be listened to and received by but according to their conformity to the apostles doctrine
if any pretending never such immediate authority from god or have never such an angell like speech and carriage yet agree not to or speak not the language and doctrine delivered by the apostles for the obedience of faith to and among all nations we are not to listen to or follow him but account him accursed such be the persons to be so accounted by us
should nextly then inquire into the doctrine or gospel preached by the apostles and so bring these men to the trial of that touchstone but shall not enlarge upon that because would be brief and give him time to answer for himself
only shall pitch upon two heads of trials

touching the manner of the coming of the true prophets and apostles in the way of their doctrine and
the matter delivered by them therein
for the manner of their coming shall note


that the true apostles and prophets of god and christ alwayes to come with abusements of themselves in the presence of god and with exalting and lifting up god and christ they use to own themselves sinners to have sin and to be weak bruitish in themselvs

as of themselves and the like never any of them have used to vaunt themselves or speak of themselves or one another as sinless but always abase themselves and glorisie the lord thee therefore that come otherwise preaching themselves sinless and perfect and much more that vilisie and reproach others for confesting sin these have nor the badges of the true prophets and apostles by this we may discover this people called quakers

that the holy men of god the prophets and apostles use to own themselves to have sin in them the scripture witness
the patriarchs and first fathers though we read not of any sins of some of them yet in this they are manifest to have owned themselves to have been sinners and to have sin in them that they use to worship god by secrifice in which was a remembrance of sin hebr
but
the prophets are more express in their acknowledgments as david psal
who can know his errors cleanse thou me from my secret sins and keep me that presumptuous sins prevail not over me he had secret sins them it seems to be cleansed from and again in psal
said hear me least otherwise they mine enemies should rejoyce over me when my foot slippeth it seems he was sensible of slips sometimes then they magnifie themselves against me then they rejoyce and insult see this is a character of false prophets and enemies to the true prophets so to do
yea he further adds for am ready to halt and my sorrow is continually before me for will declare my iniquity will be sorry for my sin see david was sensible of his readiness to halt and bewails it and he had iniquity and sin he confested but mine enemies adds he are lively and they are strong
the enemies to the true prophets they it seems boasted themselves and vapoured in their strength and pretended holiness as if they had no sin to confess as poor david had and david for it as these people and this whitehead have lately reproached us for joyning our selves with the nation in confessing sin and that they the quakers are ordered of god as a judgment to us namely this nation whereof we are part for our neglect of christ the salvation of god and abuse of his truth how do they infult over us for this are they not herein made manifest to be like davids enemies false prophets that magnified themselves against him and were lively and strong while he confest his sin
again in psal
david says enter not into judgment with thy servant lord for no man living shall be justified in thy fight mark no man living implying clearly that there is no man so just and holy and without sin in himself while he is alive in the world or living or before his decease that he may be any otherwise justified in the fight of god then by his not entring into judgement with him that is then by his forgiving his sin and accepting him in christ doth not that then clearly and perfectly imply no man perfectly freed from sin in himself in this life solomon also says in kings
there is no man that sinneth not and eccles

there is not a just man on earth that doth good and sinneth not he did not then magnifie himself as sinless agur also a good man see how he himself and gives glory to god in the beginning of his prophesie prov
sarely says he am more brutish than man and have not the understanding of a man neither learned wisdome nor have the knowledge of the holy who hath ascended every word of god is pure he is a shield to them that trust in him he was far from witnessing perfection in himself and glorying thereof to others no he abases himself and only gives glory to god
isaiah also when was a prophets for he began to prophesie in the days of uzziah isai
when he saw the glory of god and christ and the seraphins hiding their faces and feet with their wings in his presence as not pure enough for gods sight and heard them cry one to another not of another holy holy holy is the lord god of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory cries out wo is me for am undone because am a man of unclean lips and live in the midst of a people of unclean lips
and though the lord then took away his iniquity and purged his sin as if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness joh
yet we find him again afterward confessing his sin and joyning himself with the people in confessing their iniquities and so he was none of them people reproved by him that use to say to others stand by thy self am more holy then thou as isai
as in isai
we grope for the wall like the blind and we grope as if we had no eyes the deceivers of our times had they heard him say so its probable would have replyed thou art a blind guide indeed art thou fir to be a prophet and shepherd and dost thou call blind watchmen and thou thy self sayest thou gropest like the blind and gropest as if thou hadst no eyes he after adds for our transgressions are multiplied before thee and our sins testifie against us

for our transgressions are with us and as for our iniquities we know them in transgressing and lying against the lord and departing away from our god speaking oppression and revolt and again in isa
we are all as an uncleanthing and all our righteousnesse are as filthy rags and we do all fade as a lease and our iniquities like the wind have taken us a way
so we might shew you in jer
and daniel he confessed rebellions and sins against god
dan

and says vers
he confessed his sin and the sin of his people istael
but would be breif

come we to the apostles or the times of and since christ come in the flesh
john the baptist acknowledged sin in him for he sayes have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me matth

he thought not himself it seems so clean then that he needed no further washing by christ
so the apostles
paul sayes sin dwelt in him rom
and in tim

when he was an apostle he confest himself a sinner saying jesus christ came into the world to save sinners of whom am mark am the chief or a chief one
james also sayes in many things we offend all jam
and john if we walk in the light as he is in the light then have we ship one with another
and what then have we no sin then in us nay he sayes not so but the contrary the blood of christ cleanseth us from all sin cleanseth in the present time he sayes not it hath before cleansed us from all so as now there is no further need for it to cleanse us for we have none to be cleansed from
but to the contrary if we say we have sin we deceive our selves and the truth is not in us
and in chap
he says these things write to you that ye sin not it seems then the apostles so and confesting sin in them was not a pleading for sin as these men upon that account traduce and reproach us but he writ those things as a warning of men to take heed of sinning for it tends to make men the more watchful to know that there is such an enemy in their bosom that is so dangerous to them
wheras the contrary perswasion layes men open to follow after what ever is in their hearts as not being sin
but sayes he if any man sin we we that beleive have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins marke for our sins it seemes then they thought and judged that they had sins and so need to live upon christ by faith as their propitiation and to abide alwayes in him wherin they fined they sayd not there is no sin in us nor we have no sin in us for christ to be our propitiation for
true it is he sayes in john

as he is so are we in this world
but we are not to straine the scriptures beyond their scope however that cannot be the meaning of the apostle that is directly contraty to his other sayings he cannot mean in it we are without sin as he is because that is contraty to his own saying that if we say we have no sin we deceive our selves nor will it reach to all things for then we might say as christ is without a visible personal body in the world subject to aches and pains and mortallity so are we too and thats evidently false but he speaks in respect of judgment we have such use and respect in the world as christ hath
hereabout genge whitehead began to grow impatient and to set himself to interrupt and to answer but and others present and amongst them mr the church warden told him that was not fuire i.h being called and come thither to make good his charge should have liberty to proceed and i.h told him he had not yet done with the first branch of it
so after a little he gave way for him to proceed
and he proceeded to this purpose
you see this proved that the true apostles and prophets use to confesse sin in themselves and none of them to glory in their perfection and sinlesnesse only the false prophets were otherwise carried to lift up themselves as strong and lively and the pharisees they use to boast god thank thee am not as other men are not like the publican in themselves chat they were righteous and despising others as being sinners and whether this be not the way too of these men the quakers for his impatience will not me to observe the method propounded appeal to all that have heard them or read their books do not they glory of their sinlesnesse and righteousnesse and despise others say they are sinners yea have they not reproached even this among the rest hath reproached us for owning our selves as part of the nation guilty of sin with them


again the true apostles and teachers use to prove their doctrine and preaching by the scriptures and not to abuse the scriptures with grosse and senselesse glosses
now these men do abuse the scriptures with deceitful glosses
will instance one or two alledged kings
there is no man that sinneth not to prove that the true prophets owned all men to be

sinners in
now mark what a glosse these people and this by name upon it viz
that among that sin there is none that sinneth not making the wisest of men speak a tautolog and speech to god that there is none that sins that sins not
and then they adde to that sorry shift that that was under the old covenant under the new covenant is otherwise as if they would say under the old covenant there was no man of them that sinned that sinned not but now its otherwise some among those that sin sin not
again to eccles

there is not a just man upon earth that not
they say mark the word there there in the changeable state is not a just man pulling the word there from is when as knows that it is but one word in the latine viz
est and to there and is ought not to be parted there is not in that place of place and then too they must say job was not such a just man for he was in the changable state waiting all his appointed time till his change should come
nor paul and the other believers for they looked for the saviour from heaven to change their vile body phil

hereabout again grew impatient and would have been interrupting and answering but he was told it was not fair not to let proceed seeing it was his work or part to prove his charge against them and the bid him either be fair and hear out the proof of the charge or else he should not be there
to whom replyed would he have him out of the and indeed conceive he would have willingly had that to glory in rather than to hear himself proved a deceiver and such as people ought to count accursed but being perswaded to acquiess or be quiet a little he answered there had been much said and his memory could not bear so much as might be spoken or to that purpose
to whom replyed it seems thou art not yet perfect if thy memory be so weak yet after a little struggling he gave way again and proceeded to this effect
should come near to the matter of their doctrine but he being impatient must but briefly mention the heads of what would charg them with therein shall only say then that they that subvert the faith delivered by the apostles and undermine the hope of the gospel they preach other doctrines than the apostles did and are such as ought to be accounted accured by men now that these men the quakers and particularly doth so thus demonstrate

they subvert the faith in denying christ to have body in heaven glorified in which he suffered and rose again and so they deny the truth of that in act

that he should even again in like manner as they had seen him go up they therein subvert the faith of his in heaven for us
they subvert the faith in saying as edw borroughs in the declaration of their faith that the knowledg of christ that is to eternal salvation is the knowledg of him after the spirit as he was before the world was which is in effect not to confess but make nothing of his coming in the flesh
again they subvert the hope of the gospel in denying the resurrection of the bodies of and in saying that that coming of christ in which he shall descend with a shout with the of the archangel and trump of god and when the dead in christ shall be raised and the living believers be changed is over and past the apostles and believers of that age and remained to it for what then have we to expect and hope
but those things we speak to we can come to them afterward because he is impatient
let us hear what thou canst say for thy self

then himself to answer
first pull'd out the papers that i.h had written one of which he said that through the strength of god he would prove them deceivers such as people ought not to hear but to account them accursed and another in which warned people beware of them as of those whom he by good proof knew to and such as people ought not to follow but to account accursed

and that having known the truth go after them did therein able sin which he was ready lawfully called to it which

the people and stood to maintain them against him having read them he sold the people that had not made good his charge against them for though said true in saying that the prophets and apostles witnessed sin in them and confessed sin yet that did not prove that the quakers preached another doctrine than they did for though the prophets and apostles did so as had proved yet said they witnessed also another state afterward when were free from sin and that had not proved that they sin in them so long as they lived
which how false that was appears in what id on psal

it is true added george that david had sometimes sinnes and confessed sinnes but david witnessed another state when he had no sin for in psal
he sayes bless ye my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name now it david had sin in now could all that was within him bless gods holy name can sin bless gods name that is so contrary to god and his name therefore seeing all within david could bless gods name it follows there was no sin in him and so in psal
david sayes blessed are the undefiled in the way they also do no iniquity now every sin defiles

and therefore they have no sin in them that are undefiled in the way and in another place david sayes lord thou hast heard me and granted me all my desires
but we could not get him to name in what place he read that saying though we called to him for it but went on taxing us for interrupting him and gave this gloss now he desired the lord to cleanse him from his secret sinnes and god having granted him all his desires he was cleansed from them all
then he went to that of solomon eccles

and reading two or three verses before he gave this gloss upon it that of men in the changable state there is not a just man that doth good and hereabout t.m and he had two or three words objected that there was no mention of any changable state but of fearers of the lord but he went on and as take it bid joseph whiteworth that sate by him and wrote write that tho moore said

there is no changable state and added that solomon said that the righteousness of the

perfect shall direct his way and so went on to isaiah and gave the like put off to him as that isaiah indeed confess'd sin but witnessed another state when god had wrote all his works in him and daniel witnessed the bringing in an everlasting righteousness
and christ bid be ye perfect as your heavenly father is perfect and paul sayes so many as are perfect let us be thus minded
and james sayes let patience have her perfect work that ye may be intire wanting in no good thing
and to that of saying in many things we sin all he said so he sayes with the tongue we bless god and therewith curse we men not that he did so though he put in himself and so as if he was none of the all that offended
and that john sayes if we say we have no sin or have not sinned but he sayes not if we say we are not all sinners we deceive our selves that he joyned himself with the little

children to whom he writ that they might not sin and that they might have sin and with reference to them he sayes if we say we have no sin we deceive our selves but they witnessed another state when they say whosoever is born of god sinneth not because the seed of god abideth in him neither can he sin because he is born of god
and in john
we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself that the wicked one toncheth him not and again he that doth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous and therefore he concluded that had not made good his charge had not proved that they preached other doctrine than was preached by the apostles

to this replyed that he had mistaken his argument which was to this purpose that the true prophets and apostles came confessing sin and not reproaching any for so doing but they did not so own sin but reproach them that confest them
they urged that said the prophets and apostles came always confessing sin whereas the expression was always abasing themselves and exalting the lord and that they use to acknowledge themselves sinners and

to have sin and never to say of themselves that they were without sin or had no sin but waving other things asked whether they that he proved to have owned themselves sinners and to have confessed their sin as he also had granted were prophets and apostles when they so did to that answered that they did then minister
what did they minister before they were prophets and apostles had they not commission from god then to minister and so were they not then prophets and apostles when they spake and wrote such things as were alledged
to this somewhat unwillingly as he seemed granted that they were then prophets and apostles
what state was that then in which they witnessed no sin in them if they were prophets and apostles when they confessed sin

when they were born of god then they witnessed no sin in them or that they were freed from fin for he that is born of god sinneth not were not the apostles then born of god when they were apostles and wrote these things as paul that it was no more be that did it but sin that dwelt in him
paul had a time when he was not born of god when he groaned and travelled and waited for the adoption the redemption of the body for while sin was above him and he groaned and was burthened with it he was not yet born of god but when he was set free from it then he was born
what was not paul of god when he says we also that have the first fruits of the spirit even we our selves groan within our selves waiting for the adoption the redemption of the body
paul when he travelled and was for deliverance and waiting for the redemption of the body was not as yet born or god but afterward he witnessed a being redeemed from sin and then he was born as ye know in natural things a woman when she is in travel to be delivered the child is not yet born
people pray did ye ever hear of a woman in travel before that woman was born was there ever such a thing here all the people fell a laughing at nay thou beliest me did not say so that a woman travels with child before she be born
nay did not say thou saidst so but thy similitude must be so if thou speakest to purpose for it was paul that thou saidst groaned and travelled to be delivered and it is the woman in travel that groans and travels not the child to be born but george shall read thee a scripture and prove that paul was then born of god it is john
whosoever beleeveth that jesus is the christ is born of god
paul did believe jesus to be the christ when he was an apostle and writ to the romans and said they waited for the redemption of the body did not paul when an apostle and so the rest of them believe jesus to be the christ which wilt thou deny
here george was pittifully put to it and all the people generally see his confusion that he was in a share so that he durst deny neither of those propositions but he then flew to another shift that paul condescended in his writing to those of low degree and that were not yet born of god and became a jew to the jew and to them that were under the law as under the law
tell me which proposition thou wilt deny is not whosoever believes jesus to be the christ born of god or did not paul when he owned himself to have sin in him believe that jesus was the christ and here was pittifully shackled and nonplust and would fain have been out of the argument having nothing to say for himself still but that

the apostle condescended to the estate of some he wrote to as if the believing romans or saints at rome that he wrote to were not born of god or did not then believe that is the christ or as if the apostle would make himself an unbeliever with unbelievers

then it seems paul wrote a lie as touching himself that he waited for the redemption of the body and travelled as thou sayest in pain when it was selfe of did not so but had already attained the redemption of his body
did he say faly of himself he condescended to the state of others he became a jew to the jew as before


did he say falsly then with respect to himself did not paul believe that jesus was the christ when he was an apostle and confessed sin in himself was not he born of god
here he being still baffled and not answering any thing to the purpose divers called to him

to answer to the business or else to own himself a deceiver or to that purpose
answer then whether paul was born then of god or believed jesus to be christ or to that purpose
you are two to one

we speak both but one thing we ask the same thing
came not here to satisfie unreasonable men paul spake at a jew to the

then he spake there false it seems of himself wilt thou say so he bng about it said to him ah george where is thy vaunting language now as if thou couldst tread down all before thee and thy setting up thy self above god thou beest me did set up my self above god see people how or to that purpose
didst thou not set up thy self above god when thou didst reproach me by my as if he would or could not carry me forth against thee he said if thy god will cry thee forth by way of reproach
also was informed that at godney they said they would make us ashamed of our god now if god be the true god as he is what but a setting up themselves above god was this let all judg
canst thou deny that paul was born of god when an apostle or that he believed that jesus was the christ paul spake to the state of others when he said wretched man that am and groaned and waited for the redemption of the body
did paul then witness or experiment the redemption of his body from corruption before he dyed yea he did witness it
witness it but had he it was his body redeemed from corruption before he dyed yea he had the redemption of his body before he dyed

is not the body sown in corruption when it dyes it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption
yea but is not sin corruption how is it redeemed from corruption before it dye when it is sown in corruption when it dyes corruption is sin pauls body was redeemed from the law of sin and death

but is all corruption sin there is a corruption of mortality came in by sin

all corruption is sin or came in by sin and take away the cause and the effect ceases
now we shall prove that he was made free from sin
answer plainly and prove it from the scripture that the redemption of the body that paul waited for he had it before he dyed for you bring nothing for it but your corrupt logick in which one as weak as my self might discover its
did use any logick where there is freed me from the cause the effect ceases· now that paul had freedome from sin the cause of corruption before he dyed is that you about to prove and so to get from the question
yea that is logicall but will not alwayes hold the effect may last when the cause is goue as a house may stand when he that built it is dead but is not that corruption which is in death in which the body corrupteth and did not paul wait for the redemption of his body from that yea that death that came in by sin
but what death was that that cameth by sin he said he asked the question before asked what follovvs though do not remember that he did what death came not in by sin what death came in by sin
asked thee vvhat death came not in by it ask thee a question and thou ansvverest me by asking me ansvver my question first asked thee

did not hear that thouaskedst that question first but thou saidst that death that came in by sin and asked thee what death came not in by sin nay asked thee first what death came in by sin and thou refusest to ansvver my question is this fair

he sought occasion to vvinde out from the business in hand by starting

another question if he did first ask it or whensoever he started it replyed remember not that thou didst ask me that first but however tis not my business now to answer thy questions that may lead us from the matter in hand my business is now to prove my charge against thee if thou wilt own that that is done will answer thee thy question
g.w pulling out a book writ by j.h and t.m about their former dispute with him and s.f would fain have diverted to it and said he would prove j.h had there bely'd him
j.h thou hast answered that book in print the people may see what thou sayst against us there and we shall give it an answer god willing ere long· what have we to do with hearing thee read in that book now g.w
will prove here that j.h hath here contradicted himself or to that purpose and would fain have been reading
j.h
if thou wilt grant have proved my charg we will hear thee read but if not let me do what come about
answer me and prove that paul had the redemption of his body there spoken of before he dyed
g.w urging yet to read the people told him that was to go from his business and bid him answer to what he was charged with or say the charg was proved
j.h did paul prove the redemption of his body before his decease for which he waited as he sayes rom g.w yea he did before his decease
j.h prove that
g.w
in rom
he sayes the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death
and in another place can do nothing against the truth but for it
j.h what be these to the purpose paul said he was made from the law of sin and death before he said he waited for the adoption the redemption of the body for he sayes that in rom
and yet speaks of waiting for the redemption of his body after that in ver
therefore what he sayes about his being free from the law of sin and death could not be the redemption of body that he there mentions for why should he wait for that yet if he before had it did he wait for what he had already here g.w was wholly driven from that proof so as we heard no more of it and to help himself betook him to the other
g.w
but he sayes in the other place he could do nothing against the truth but for the truth
j.h could he then do something against the truth when he said he waited for the redemption of the body the which also t.m asked
g.w yea that which waited for the redemption could for he cryed out oh wretched man that am and he was led captive by the law of sin and death
t.m
where sayes he that he was led captive by it he sayes he found a law in his members leading him captive to the law of sin and death but where sayes he that he was led g.w
he sayes with his flesh he served the law of sin so then he was led by it and could do against the truth doth not fin do against the truth j.h
but paul sayes not that his flesh or members waited for the adoption the redemption of his body but that he himself waited for it and though his flesh served the law of sin yet that was not he that did it but fin that in him
t.m
while he waited for the adoption the redemption of the body though fin acted in him yet he did not walk after it but was led by the spirit and so could do nothing against the truth or to that purpose
g.w george still pleaded that his members the creature that waited for the redemption could do against the truth till it was deliver'd from the bondage to corruption and then it had the redemption of the body for which he waited
t.m paul while he waited for the redemption of the body was led by the spirit of and such as are the sons of god and they that are born of god cannot sin or do any thing against the truth or to that purpose
g.w still insisted upon the creature waiting to be deliver'd that it night that pauls which were yet in bondage to corruption might act against the truth not receiving the awer given that was not he that did it but sin that dwelt in him so

him that such as are led by the spirit and are sons of god at such and so in paul sayes it of himself do any thing against the truth but for it at is not find in his heart to yeild up to sin inticing or striving in his members to do any thing against it

besides paul sayes in the same chapter vers
that he was perswaded nothing could seperate them from the love of god in christ jesus and therefore he could then do nothing against the truth but for it
but this that g.w pleaded clearly argued their gross

corruption in not believing the redemption of the body from death and grave and that made him put it upon a redemption of pauls members only from sin from which yet that he was perfectly freed as its inherency in him before death he was not able to prove
j.h calling oftentimes to be heard by g.vv what he had said and had to say and going on in a discourse to no purpose about the creature being in a travail and waiting for redemption and applying that to pauls body or members to be redeem'd from sin and acting then he truth j.h said came here to prove you deceivers and to make good my charge and

heard have to say
thereupon j.lee without our approbation called out to him and said
g.vv why caust thou not bee patient now and hear what is said to thee as well as thou other day with mr g.w here g.vv could hear that and take occasion to spend a little time in commending as he call'd him as better and more moderate than we
j.h
we are not desirous of thy commendations or think them any great praise to us if them came here to make good my charge against yon and you run on to other things and not hear what say to you
that which thou talkest of the creatures groaning and waiting deliverance is a distinct thing from what we have in hand and pertains not to pauls waiting for the deliverance in his body or members thou talkst of read the text and here j.h read the
the earnest exspectation of the creatures waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god
the creature that waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god is distinguished from the sons of god to be manifested and is not the sons of god themselves and so in vers
the creature itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of god see the same distinction again
and again when he had said the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together untill now he adds and not only they but we our selves also who have received the first fruits the spirit
see an evident distinction between the creature and that travailed in pain about which thou a stir and paul and the believers that waited for the redemption of the body from mortality and corruption they were the sons of god to be manifested and being sons of god born of god could then do nothing against the truth but for it in such sense as he that is born of god sinneth not nor can sin and yet they had the redemption of the body as a father thing to wait for and therefore that saying that he could do nothing against the truth but for it proves not that he could do not that he had in this life the redemption he here speaks of
prove that paul had this redemption of his body before he dyed or else own the charge proved
the people calling upon him to make good that or else own the charge made good he replyed
g.w
if should own that he hath made good his charge against me should prove j.h to contradict himself for he saies in his paper that people should not hear us and yet you and he would have me answer that you might hear me what have to say he read the paper
g.w jangling with some of the people about that frivolous put off
j.h called to be heard and answered thus j.h
did explain the meaning of that word when writ the paper and gave it out and desired might by hearing be understood to listen to and receive your doctrine as appeal to esq if he be here
g.w
then people you may see his deceit that he one thing and means another that is not here vvritten for here it is hear
j.h
gave my meaning to the vvord expresly vvhen gave my paper to g.f and ed shitter nor did publish the paper
g.w
many have seen it
j.h
gave it to none but ed sheoter or fox and gave my sense to them vvith it if they shevved it many that vvas their act
t.m
the next vvords explain the meaning because it follovvs but to account them accursed
it is not so to hear as to receive them
people
this is a mere cavil let him ansvver to the business in hand or yeild the
g.w
do you think vvill grant or ovvn that people should count us j.h
do not think you vvill nor did undertake to make you ovvn it
but to prove you so
its enough the people see it they are to judg vvhether make good my charge
t.m either speak something to purpose or acknovvledg thy mouth stopp'd as it hath often been by the force of the truth
g.w
he vvould have me acknovvledg my mouth stopt and yet speak to them and ansvver them
t.m
a man may have his mouth stopt though he speak vvhen he speaks to no purpose
a mans mouth his stop'd when he cannot resist the wisdome and povver by vvhich the truth is spoken as act
could not resist though yet they are said act
to have resisted
and it appears thy is stopt because thou runst avvay from the charge to other things
j.h well george hither to have made good my charg that you come not as the true prophets and apostles thou hast not been able to prove that any of them preach'd themselves free from sin so as to be without sin
thou didst speak of david confessing another state and brought psal
all that is within me bless his holy name and from thence wouldst infer that david had no sin in him then for how could sin bless gods name but david himself implyes the contrary for vers·
he sayes who forgiveth all thine iniquity it seems he had some then
g.w
they were for given
t.m
it is forgiveth in the present time can there be forgiveness of sin if there be no sin he signifies a dayly forgiving or to such purpose
g.w david saith psal
there are some underfiled in the way who do no iniquity
j.h doth david say there are some undefiled he sayes they are blessed that are so but that there are some so at least in such a sense as to have no sin in them he sayes not am sure he sayes not so of himself that he had no sin in him but implyes the contrary in vers
when he sayes that my wayes were so directed that might keep thy statutes as implying they were not yet so and again then shall not be ashamed when shall have respect to all thy commandements he doth not say he had then such respect to them all
g.w doth not david say there are some undefiled when he sayes blessed are the undefiled in the way and doth not every sin defile therefore he witnesled some had a sinless state or to that purpose
j.h
he sayes undefiled in the way christ is the way we grant some undefiled and compleat in christ but not so as to be sinless in themselves is not undefiled perfect g.w yea undefiled is perfect
a man may be perfect in a scripture sense and yet have sin
asa heart was perfect with the lord all his dayes and yet he sinned
g.w
when was that written of him j.h surely after his death how else should they say what he was all his dayes g.w nay it might be written before and so all his dayes till that was written his heart was perfect for afterward he relyed not on the lord but sought to the physicians his heart was not perfect then
j.h how could the hystory of his life and death be written but after his death it is not said all those dayes or till such a time but his heart was perfect all his dayes a part of his dayes is all his dayes
his heart was perfect in that he walked not between god and baal or
g.w
he might be perfect all his dayes till then that was written but if the righteous man turn his and miquity his righteousness shall not be mentioned
j.h heart was perfect all his dayes his righteousness is mentioned it is not said turned being
g.w
he was but one
j.h
one that had sin in him or sinned might be yet called then why not twenty or an hundred
he would sain have been reading in h's book but he told him it was besides the
wh were busie in our discourse came giles rose a poor deluded man that was one of the st turned in the town of lin but upon some account or other doth not throughly but is at them and as it hath been said objected sometimes against them some between some of their speakers and a woman of them he had made an interpon two dayes before of another dispute between g.vv and another in the town the people him begin at a distance like a of distracted man to call out and seeing him coming made some commotion some of them crying to have him carryed away that he might not any distce interruption of the dispute but that he proceed and others ging him in and setting him in the midst of us who began first to one party and then to to play the part of a prophet in his conception against us for and for the of love taxing vv and his party for drawing away wives from them children from their parents servants from their masters
to whome george spake a word or two his way as deceit
t.m see the thy ministry george the people laught thy principles are to lead to
g.w
he is none of fruit of my ministry
a
your principles or ministry led a brother of mine am sure into destraction
yes am a witnesse of that so· he fell to my knowledge out of quaking fits within a very little space into destraction and within a fortnight died

it was before came to this towne

but not before yonr principles and doctrine came after some time of interruption by the aforesaid giles when a little quiet was obtained
fell on againe

have made good my charge against you george as not coming as the true apostles and prophets use to do
shall a little speak to the other part in one argument because see time goes a way
tis this they that and destroy the hope of the gospel preached by the apostles they are preachers of another gospel or doctrine then the apostles preached and are to be accounted accursed and not received or followed
this charge you quakers with and you by name
in that you say the coming of christ at which the dead in christ are to be raised is already past and over
they that so do subvert the hope of the gospel
mind it people
they that say the coming of christ wherin the dead in christ are to be raised is past and over they subvert or the hope of the gosple for if christ be come in his glory and the saints raised that were dead and the living changed and all together caught up in the aire to meete the lord what have we then to hope or look for
denying this
read their words out of their book against him and their words are thus as for that coming of christ spoken of in thess

which these men would blindly put a sat off to a coming of christ in a body of flesh and bones the apostle says wee that live and remaine tell the coming of the lord
so that coming of christ the saints that were a live remained unto it
judge good people is christ yet come are the dead bodies of the saints raised and the living changed and all caught up together in the aire to meete him
if those men be not such as we are to avoid and account accursed who be thou readest out of a book and yet will not give should read out of thy book
here is not the same reason
he to prove you deceivers and such as are to be accounted accursed or to that purpose and therfore may produce testimonies out of your books against you but you are not to prove against him but to defend your self
h· what host thou to say to this argument
g.w
meant is not of that resurrection of the dead thou speakest of or to that purpose
thou speakest of that coming of christ mentioned in that scripture and that scripture speaks of christ descending from heaven to raise the dead in him
shall read it to you thess· would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them that sleept
its evident he speaks of those that sleepe in the bodyly death as its sayd of that when he had said those words he fell a sleepe he would not have beleivers mourne as those without hope them
for if we beleive sayth he that jesus died and rose again even so then also that sleepe in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive that is those of us of our body or society accounting beleivers of all ages but as one body and to the coming of the lord shall not revent that are a sleepe
for the lord himself shall from heaven with a shout and with the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first and we which a live and remaine shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meete the lord in the and so shall we ever be with the lord
what more plaine that he speaks of the of christ to raise the dead those that sleepe the grave and to change living beleivers now appeal to you all whither those things were done in the time of those before they dyed and if so what have we to for

there is a twofold sleeping spoken there is a sleeping or to that purpose such as is spoken of in the next chapter
let us not as do others but let us watch and be for they that sleepe sleepe in the and there a sleeping such as is said to fall a in at death
now the there of the first
nay he speak of the sleeped death the dead in christ shall rise first

is it not sayd the howe is coming and no that the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and that hear shall live
john
had not the apostles and heard that voice of son of god raising them from death in sin before the apostle wrote this or they that yet to looke for that in john speaks of men dead in sin and this of the dead in christ

is it not sayd of those they turned from dumb idolls to serve the living god and to wayte for his son from could they waite for a thing so far off was it not the revelation of christ to their soules or to purpose was his answer
had not those of christ to their soules as to the knowledge of him before they turned from their dumb idols to serve the living god
nay they had not the revelation of christ then before they turned from dumb idols but they waited for it
what was it turned them to god then was not that a frutie of the gosple coming to them and doth nor the gospel reveale christ
yea there is a measure of the knowledg of christ which if they be obedient they shall have more as they that obtained like precious faith with the apostles that had the sure word of prophesy as a light shining in a dark place did well to take heed to it tell the day dawned and the day starr arose in the heart when that dawned and arose that was the coming of the day of the lord to such purpose was his answer but with more circumstances
had not the beleivers and cheifly the apostles beare that further measure of light and revelation of christ when they thus wrote or what is that to the purpose of this coming spoken in the text is that with the voice of the and the trump of god and the dead in christ all raised then and those a sleepe changed that is to one now and to another then and those that are in a living frame may prevent those that are in a sleepy posture such as the apostle warns us not to be in
therfore thats nothing to the purpose
the thessalonians had something of that spiritual revelation of christ as the cse of their turning to serve the living god

there george into a long circuling the same over and over againe the of which so as could perceive was

dent measures of the revelation of the knowledge of christ and that they that the least should have more to the perfect day
hears nothing but the same things over and over
but did the apostles receive the full revelation of christ in the time of their live
you ask whither all the glory they should have before death
or whither they should have no more glory after death
nay we ask about glorious coming of christ in which the dead shall be raised had they that before they dyed is there no other coming of christ in glory for them and us to see then what they had or see while they lived
here he wrangled a little about the question and answered nothing to purpose but that they had greater measure before they died but as if they might have more glory after
its evident that the apostle paul did not remaine to that coming of the lord there spoken of that shall prove
how do you prove it
because he diad and is dead wheras had he remained to that coming of the lord he should only have bin changed and caught up into the aire
appeale to all the people whither my charge be not herein made good against thee
nay it is not
thou nor must not be judges in our own causes let the people judge
nay that of god in the people must be judge

appeale to that of god in them all whither the coming of christ there spoken of be over and past while the apostles lived are the dead in christ raised the living changed all together caught up into the aire to meete the lord would needs read something out of j.h book being not able to make good his saying which charged as contrary to the apostles doctrine about the coming of christ
and began to read something of john horn granting and bewayling the too much of that of the prophet isaiah
was too true of to many ministers of england as that his are blind they are dumb doggs which he going about to turne upon replyeds nay george thou dost not finde us dumb doggs we are made able blessed be god to worry thee thou seest and put thee to the worst


he is in the nature of a dog it seemes then wheras christ sent not out his apostles dogs

but as lambs amongst wolves

but the lamb of god is a lyon too george and maks israel a lyon too as in gen
as a lyon amongst the beasts of the forrest as mica and its in his strength and power that we are inabled to teare and worry thee for all thy great brags

and some others of his friends laughing at the quakers and at to see some of his confusion in some passage
thou art in ishmaels nature or we may see ishmael in you or to such purpose
nay tis isaac nature isaac had his name of laughter and it is said the righteous shall see them and laugh them to scorne and we rejoice to see the lord strengthen us to baffle you and to make manifest your folly art thou righteous then
why not compleatly righteous in christ though in my self acknowledg sin
see how he contradicts himself be compleat in christ and yet have sin in him
though that be out of our way and from the businesse in hand yet shall prove that those two will stand together
the apostle says coloss

in him yee are compleat and yet in the same epistle to the same people he says chap
mortifie these therfore your members that be upon earth fornication uncleannesse
if these were not in them how could they be called their members upon earth and why should they be bid to mortifie them if they had no life in them too
the apostle sayes of those that were compleat in christ in whome also yee are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands the putting off the the body of the sins of the flesh
he doth so and yet bids them chap
put of all those things still anger wrath malice
they had put them off as to their purpose and bent of heart and yet had need to put them off in their dayly practic and conversation

the apostles writing to the churches writ to diverse states
some of them were compleat in christ and others were not but had their members to mortifie
the apostle makes no such distinction he says not some of you are compleat in christ but says it without limitation to some in him yee are compleat and so he gives the other counsell to all of them yea he gives it upon supposition of their being raised with christ and are not those that risen with christ compleat in christ col
what do you think that the apostle writ one chapter to one part of the people and another chapter to another after this returning to the businesse of christs coming to raise the dead being past before the apostles dyed and nothing further being answered to it but that paul spake of a spiritual coming to mens spirits we slid upon that of kings

known how that there is no man that sinneth not
wilt thou affirme that of all men living now
nay first wilt thou grant it of all men living let us agree first of what was then and then come to the times now
say no man that was in that state sinned

the word are there is no man that sinneth not
there is no mention of any state in some in which all sinned distinct from some other state in which some men firmed not

it is said if they sin for there is no man that sinneth not

it is absolutely said the reason why israel might be supposed to sin that theres no man that sinneth not
it is not said if they sin then thereis no man that sins not but for theres no man that sinneth not
theres no man in that state
theres no limitation to any state but there is no man that sinneth not
ah george dost thou go up and down to men to look to the light and dost thou despute and plead against the light in thee dost thou not see the scripture is against thee

there is no man in that sinneth not

is there any man in that is not a man if he be a man he sinneth for there is no man that sinneth not

all in that state sin
but thou say there is no man now that sinneth not


is no into living not or hath not sin in him now jesus christ excepted
then there is a sinneth not
then its not true of all men
jesus christ is god with us and so more then a man
christ is included in the sinned against
if they sin against thee
he is that one and only man that good because he is god and therfore he must needs be excepted
to was the discourse between and
we have here given the substance and scope if not also the very the answers and the very words and forme so much as could be remembred
after which the with other friends seeing much spent with speaking so long and so much and fearing he might therin desired him to give the people some short exhortation and conclude
accordingly minded the people of what had hin proved against them and warned the people to take heed of and with them they became an too and should be given up of god to beleive delusions to their own destruction
and so desired them to withdraw and they begining to depart he also being and much spent withdrew and the whole company dispersed to their several wayes seeming generall well satisfied against the quakers the no small trouble of the quakers as might be conceived from their coming diverse of them in the lords day after with to the congregation to have made some disturbance upon the people or to indeavoure to have been drawing a way some of them
but god mercifully prevented them of their purpose
only they sat and heard diverse of their corrupt further disproved from that in
sam

there is holy as the lord
and amongst other things to in speaking to the holinesse of gods name to shew grosse jesuitical glosse upon psal there was no sin in david because then all within him could not god
shewing that not only david of or owned that he had sin for god to forgive but also that the words in the hebrew and signifies only all my inwards or inward parts of which sin can be none though it bee in a man yet its none of the inwards of a man no part of the man
but with such deceitfull inference and arguments they delude simple people that fall down and worship them as holy men and prophets and either not able or not willing to examine and try what is said by them and indeed that is one thing that them such as men ought to reware of as very dangerous persons to that they are so with what sophestry and deceit they abuse the over people so they may but them and draw them after them all people avoid and take of them
beware of false prophur that

clothing but inwardly are
by such like frates as corrupting from the faith of hope in christ and their deceitfull wayes yee may know them
postscript
our lord jesus teaching his disciples to pray to god as their father and in the first place to breath and desire the hallowing sying of gods name the coming of his and that this will might be done in earth as it is in yet them for of their doth he not and plainly that are the hildren of and so born of god and th have their hearts through his grace set the curing of his kingdom and the of his have sins and against for give
if it be replyed yea while children and but desiving things they says the little children to whom john writes that they should not sin might they in

is name is hallowed the kin me come and the will done in in heaven they have
then to that say
are the little that know the father and call god father christs teaching born of god and is born of god is as or in any thing to how the

children to be excepted and if they though have sins and to pray in scriptive have we that others god and so any of them may not in sense too have and
we that any are so perfectly born to have his name so hall reed to and in them me to come and will as they may be no more perfectly or is it teaches that to pray till his everywhere hallowed his kingdom and will perfectly done every where even in as in heaven which is not in this
but for daily bread or as the may be necessary for bread of them and that before of their doth he men have need of bread for their life and subsistence here they have need to pray for if then the quakers so called they have sin in them them and we may then it may be think there is ground to beleeve them that name of god so come and his will so done in them that they have passes note is of god
vvhosoever is perfectly born of god as the spirits if just men made perfect that is de cased they cannot nor the men when their spirits and bodies shall in the but none are so born of god here

so far as ary man is born of god he sins not or commits not sin can

believeth with his heart that jesus is the christ doth not nor can together with the exercise of that saith walk in way of sin and so willingly do iniquity and sin nor shall miss of his end
note vvhereas with of his party coming on the lords into the congregation after sermon offered to speak to which he was i.h as conceiving he might have somthing to say in defence of himself which the said was willing to have answered him in had it been but was suffered by some that had power in that place
and whereas the said since informed that said to the that he the said george had nothing to say to the said but only a vvord from the lord to the people some of his party rail and revise at the people for not suffering him to speak it or hearing of it casting that as a reproach upon the ministry j.h doth declare that he judges it well done of those to suffer the said to utter his pretended word from the lord that as well the hear it not should willingly have permitted him to speak to the people any unless he had first acknowledged that he had been formerly and hitherto in a deceit and of it
for been but two days before proved a deceiver and such a one as people had he been permitted to speak in such a way of doctrine to the people he might well have said that we went contrary to our principles in suffering him to speak and the people to hear him so little a time had charged to be such a one as ought not to be heard and should people beleeve that god will send any vvord by a man a deceiver and they should count accursed unless to convince him of and so to him a knowledg the evil of his former way being thereof convinced we shall do evil therefore if hereafter we any of us him to speak and much more if we hear and listen to him or any of them in such way of doctrine
be still all people and wait upon god mind his gospel and believe and it be saved but as for this people the quakers unless they see and turn from their evil gods hand will be against them though they he proud at moab their lies shall not be so they shall not prosper their rottenness and shall be dryed up and perish their corruption and folly is seen and made manifest in good and shall be more for the king christ shall rejoyce and god and every one that confesseth him shall but mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped psal
every word of god is and shall be performed its season let them alone neither abuse them with incivilities nor listen to their corrupt sayings

blinde leaders of the blinde and both they that lead and they that are led by them shall fall into the mar
depart pray you from the tents or societies of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs nothing to do with their sayings and witnessings least ye be consumed in all their sins numb

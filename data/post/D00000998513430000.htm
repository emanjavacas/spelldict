TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE LORD Robert Deuorax, Earle of Essex and Ewe, Vicount of Hereford and Bowrchier, Lord Ferrers of Chartley, Burchaier and Louaine, maister of the Queenes Maiesties horse, and knight of the most honourable order of the Garter H. wisheth all heauenly happinesse, and increase of honourable vertue.
THe state and condition of true nobilititie, subiect still to fatall destinies, or rather to the deuine direction of the most highest is such (right honourable) that whether you regard the vertue, from which it originallie sprong: or respect the honour by which it continually holdeth, you shall neuer find it vnfauoured of the better, nor vnspighted of the baser sorte: By which two spurres of praise, and dispraise, as it were pricked foreward, it runneth in a speedie and voluntarie course, the right, and perfect race to earthly felicitie, the rich, and present possession, whereof is a plaine, and easie passage, to that heauenly paradise, to which your father to the great griefe of all good men, though to his great, and vnspeakeable ioy, is lately gone: who leauing behind him, the same steps for you to tread in, that he traced, the same pathes for you to wander in that he walked in before you, least at his death, so liuely a pattern for you to imitate, as neither our present age can affoord you any more vertues, nor any age past: many more valiant? Sith then of these two points, the very sound and solide substance of true nobilitie) you haue in your own house, so rare a president of fresh memorie, proceed right honorable (as you haue well begun) so by this line to leuell all your actions, as in becomming such a sonne, of such a father, you may proue more wise, then by inioying his lands, possessions seem fortunate.
The way that he walkt in, lay as far wide of vice, as vertue her selfe, in flesh and bloud cold pace it out, by which he grewe so deare to her sacred Maiestie, so acceptable to his peeres, so regarded of the multitude, that it were hard to gesse whether he were more fauoured, more beloued, or more honored.
This vvay though in some apparance it lie ope~ to the vvide vvorld, and so by that meanes, common to you vvith many, yet by a special prerogatiue, it is peculier but to a fevv, among whom, your honour so hold it by inheritance, that not to challenge your right therein, vvere but to disclaime your dissent, and to assume the possession, is but to accept of your ovvne title: vvhich in the opinion of such as knovve you vvell, you may lavvfully auerre: vvhereunto vvill forbeare longer to exhort you, as vvell for that your forvvardnesse already, stirred vp by a naturall inclination, preuentes all forraine perswasions: as for that knovv you to be furnished vvith men ofsuch vvorth, vvhom in all honorable affabilitie it pleaseth you to conuerse vvith, as that herein, an abler mans councell then mine ovvne, may seeme either superfluous, or friuolous.
Your late expedition into Portingall (hovvsoeuer the euent sorted out) yeelded to the indifferent censure of euerie man, a moste pregnant proofe of a martiall mind: at vvhat time the skilful and expert captain, took as good occasion to wonder at your singuler vallor: as the sick, maymed, and poore simple souldier to co~mend your liberal bou~ty: both which are so deeply impressed in their harts that saw, felt them, as nothing but death shall enforce a forgetfulnesse.
And now right honorable acknowledging my slender report herein, to be too base, beare a record, for matter of so great consequence, and carrying no minde (for sundry dutifull respects) to register anie part of the voiage: leaue to speake more thereof: In all lowly humilitie, moste humbly beseeching you, to auouch the patrionage of this my simple, and plaine translation, wherein haue endeuoured to deliuer into Englishe, that vvhich sometime Iosephus Quercetanus the author, left both in lattin, and in fresh, to the great benefite of his countrey men: and all other that take notice thereof, the subiect being a most learned, profitable discourse, of the cure of vvoundes, gotten by gunshot, a matter in this tumultious and troublesome time in knovvledge acceptable: and for necessitie commendable, in vvhich patronage, you shall not onely ioyne partner vvith a mightie Prince, Frances late brother to the french king, but also, by countenancing the booke, continue the good opinion, that soldiers generally haue conceiued of you, vvhereof presume you make no small accompt.
And so vvishing to your honor, all maner of happinesse, euen to the fulnesse of your ovvne content, humbly take my leaue.
IT is credibly recorded that one and the selfe same Citie of Ments in Germany, about one and the selfe same time found out and deliuered to posteritie two inuentions of rare and woonderfull importance, the Print and the Gunne: the former not so gratefull for the exceeding good, which thereby to euery man doth or may ensue: as the latter, for the excessiue hurt threatned to all men is vngratious, and yet both at this day in such request, as it were hard to say whether Mars his knights more value the one, then Mineruas schollers account of the other, so that as both haue for beginning their authors and founders, so for continuance they both want not their fautors and maintainers: neither is or can the priuiledge of the one be any way preiudice to the other, but either stands or falles in estimation, as sundrie men to either are seuerally conceited.
Leauing therefore the print to the learned, who when and where they list, can deliuer you in good and sweete termes the vse, necessitie, and commendation thereof: haue chosen with mine Author to speake a little of the other, or rather of the cure of such deadly wounds, as by the furious breath of so dangerous a deuise are procured to vs, and that not in smooth and curious phrase, or picked eloquence, the roughnesse of the matter vtterly reiecting, any such soft handling, but in blunt and rude wordes, such as best sute and sort with the subiect it selfe.
And here it is no part of my meaning with any curiositie to enquire whether the vnhappie inuention of this churlish engine be fetcht from the Fryar, or from the diuell, or from a ioynt councell of them both, helde by consent in Vulcans fyery shoppe, leaue that charge and the search thereof to my masters the Germaines, or to any man else, yt seekes out of so boisterous an inuention.
To challenge any ciuil commendation, it shall suffise me, in an English toonge to tel you a Frenchmans tale, a tale, or rather a discourse as auailable to redresse the iniuries inferd by shot (where the stripe is not mortall) as the gun almost was to inforce the harmes: wherein although diuers authors haue diuersly written, euery one according to the model of his learning and experience, as of the french Laurentius Iubertus and Botellus: of the Italians Alfonsus Ferrius and Iohannes Vigo, of the English Thomas Gale and William Clovves, and sundry of other countries, as euery man hath founde leisure and affion to trauell in a matter so needfull: some laying open the nature of the wounds, as well in concusion as dilaceration, some deliuering the malignant and venomous qualitie, proceeding from the mixture of the powder: others leauing both these, bestow their whole endeuour in the discouery of such medicines, as to themselues or to such of whom they borowed their light, might any way seeme fittest.
Among all which our Quercetanus, as it werem a middle course betweene both lightly goeth ouer the causes, and settles himselfe wholly vpon the cure: in which as his method is exquisite, so are his medicines singular: the same for the most part agreeing in substance with those of Antiquitie, but differing much in preparation, for the which many condemne him, as straying from the old beaten and knowne way, but these men forget that artes which whilome were in their nonage, haue grown in processe to a more ripe and perfite middle age, and if they be not in time prouided for, may easily decline (as most things els do) and fall into a dotage, of such force and waight is and euer yet hath bene the due consideration of time and circumstance, let vs shew our selues thankfull to such, as pittying the imperfections of others, seekes to furnish vs with better supplies.
And as Quercetanus with his owne countrimen, and all that vnderstand the Latine tongue, hath herein deserued wonderfull commendation: so let me (gentle reader) that haue laid him as open to thee, as he is to any other, find thy friendly acceptacion, and so much the rather because whatsoeuer haue offended in the rudenesse of my translation, in the diligent preparing of the medicines, heere promise to amende.
Many things not without great charge and painefull labour, haue already performed, to these and diuers other hard cures not impertinent, and if there be any thing else to make, that to this Spagiricall art doth any way belong, the learned, or practitioned shall finde me ready vpon reasonable consideration to performe all, and whatsoeuer my poore tallent can afford.
Sonet vpon the treatise of gunshot, of the Lord of Morence and Liserable, a Phisition and excellent Philosopher.
That Monk or Frier accurst may be, that bent his wat so wickedly, By salt peter and other stuffe, through shot of Gun most cruelly.
To murther men at vnawares, by sodaine stroke of bullet shot, So as no force can now preuaile, strength of men is quite forgot.
For where these engines come in place, mens bodies there are rent and torne, And many the~ loose leg or arme, bodies maimd are left forlorne.
But monsieur du Chesne we wel may blesse, whose godly care and happie skill, Hath found a mean to ease this grief, how the rage of shot to stil.
Yea he the meane hath well set downe, to heale all Gunshot with good speede, Which was a worthy deed of his, comfort yeelds to such as need.
Novv the hell and diuels all might him take, Monke or Frier vvhat might he be: That povvder and Gunshot did first make, to torment men of euery degree.
Was not the force of svvord and fire, and other engines vsde of olde: Enough to fill vvarres bloodie desire, but that nevv Esculape vnfolde.
This thundering torture nevv and strangc, to spoile by chance and not by might.
Wovvorth that vvight that causde this change, and altred so our kind of fight.
But monsieur du Chesne he may be said, the helpe and succour of our age: Who hath by medicines right assaid, and easde of Gunshot all the rage.
To Monsiour du Chesne, Baron and Lord of Morence and Lyserable.

Quo nunc, Naturae patriae cui iura coronam, Decernunt quernam, Zoile iure negas? L. Tex, M. TREATISE MADE BY THAT FAmous Phisitian Iosephus Quercetanus, and intituled his Sclopetarie: wherein is contained the perfect curation of such wounds, which comes by shot of gun or by any other engine of warre.
Sundrie disputations of the essence of woundes by shot, and of the venome and blasting ioyned therewith.
IT may be, it will seeme superfluous to some, that haue thought it conuenient to set out this Treatise of curing woundes by gunshot, of the which diuers, and especially that excellent phisition Laurentius Iubertus hath lately so diligently and fully written, that there is not let passe anie thing, that pertaineth to the essence or nature of such wounds.
The which being found out and knowne, presently the chiefest and truest way of curing is shewed, and that same did that learned man Iubertus moste excellently and orderly set out in his booke: but yt causes, why was not withdrawn by the authoritie of this man, from my pretended purpose, chieflie was the burden of inconueniences of these woundes which we intend to treate of, next a naturall desire (from my birth) placed in me of the immortall God, to bring (as much as in me some helpe to mankinde, and especiallie to mine owne countrimen, for whose sakes haue also published this litle booke in the French toong, wherein doubt not but that shall bring to light some excellent remedies neither knowne to those which wrote before me, neither yet to the common people: the vse of which haue learned both of excellent Phisitions and chyrurgions, partly when trauelled in sundry dominions of Europe, and partly by the familiar companie which had with most skilfull Phisitions abroad in the campes.
And first will set downe my opinion concerning the essence and nature of such woundes: the which question (by the consent of all that haue written thereof) is the mincipallest.
Batallus, Iubertus and Paraeus haue deliuered to vs that the hurts by gunshot are accompained with two inconueniences, that is, they consist of solution of continuitie, and brusing, with rending oftentimes of the muscles, vessels, and flesh, to the which manie accidentes come, the which diuers, must needs haue diuers intentions of curation.
These are the two sortes of inconueniences, of the which by disputation they haue agreed on, woundes by gunshot to consist, and therefore they haue set downe two kindes of remedies, one wherewith the partes so torne and wanne are holpen, that is the flesh, sinewes, lygamentes, tendons, ioyntes and bones, and that by meanes of the bruse, the which may come to passe without anie manifest wound at all, and of the Erccians is called Ecchymoosis, yet not without daunger, but oftentimes subiect to great accidentes, and manie times hath great effusion of bloud betweene the muscles, which when it is shed out of the vaines, presently putrifieth; also great aches, which are accompanied with great fiuxe of humours, diuers swellinges, inflamations, and at the last Gangrena and mortification of the part affected.
The other sort which comes with a manifest wound is more daily seene, and the deeper and greater it is, so much it is thought the more dangerous, because the shot (whether of lead or brasse) the more vehementer it goeth in, so much the more it bruseth the parts in which it entreth, by the which cause the bloud is congealed which falleth in the hollownes of the wounde, and filleth the orofice of the veines and hollownes of the other partes, then being destitute of his natur all heate (the which being quenched and mortified by the resolution of the spirits, by reaso~ of the paine tearing of so many parts, it goeth againe to the spring heade, that is to the heart, by reason of the feare which is take~ with the deadly hurt) it becomes of a wannish leady colour, like to that which the common sort calleth Asure, the which is easily rotted, and easily doth rot the parts adioyning, and especially the Spermatical: the which according to the opinion of our auncesters, is easily turned to quitture: and that the easier and speedier this fleshe being brused and dead, may be separated from the quicke and liuely flesh, the Chyrurgions doe commonly vse remedia mollientia· the vse of which, it bee vsed in common bruses, yet in these hurts it may not be followed without graue waightie considerations, and especially without consideration had of the body, time, and part, for in so much as these woundes doe easily admit great store of putrifaction, so that manie times wormes are ingendred with intollerable putrifaction, it is not to be doubted, but that by the vse of suche medicines, which by nature moue putrifaction, the griefe is increased and augmented, through euil vapors, wherewith the principall partes, that is to say, the heart, the braine and liuer are molested, whereof come crampes and phrensies with continuall feuers, and so commonly death followeth: But this happeneth for the moste parte in bodies filled with euill iuice, whose flesh, when it is agreeued through putrifaction of the bloud, it is no maruell if the wound be verie dangerous and verie hard, or not at all to be cured.
In this case the disposition of the aire and heauens, is to bee considered, and also the qualitie and state of the member hurted.
Who also doubteth but that through the entra~ce of the South winde into the hollownesse of these wounds, whereby naturall heate is weakened, there is great occasion to increase the putrifaction and generation of wormes, which is seen by dayly experience: that may ouerpasse the authoritie of Hipocrates lib. Apho.
and in his booke de Epid. which also he signifieth in another place, where he teacheth that drith is more healthier then moisture, and so all corruption to come of ouermuch moysture, as it were of his proper matter.
And to this purpose also it shall greatly auaile vs to haue a perfect knowledge of the temperamentes of partes, for wounds in the head, bottome of the stomacke and other moyst partes, and therefore more apt to putrifaction, although they be bruised, doe require of vs the vse of suppurantia, but yet not without great iudgement and heede taking, for because in this case great hurt doth often come through the vnskilfulnesse and rashnesse of the Phisition: neyther at anie time shall the Phisition be excused, although he see the wound verie muche stinking (which is alwaies an euill signe) or berayed with stincking matter and wormes, (which may come to passe in one day by reasons afore alledged) yet say he may not vse medicines called commonly Digestiues, although he reason, that it is a brused wound, therefore must come to suppuration, because these incommodities drawing on, we must presently haue recourse to such medicines as resist putrifaction, that the moste dangerous accidentes may be preuented, which are threatned by that which is said before, that is to say Gangrena, Sphacelus and mortification of the whole members.
Such medicines are the salts both mettaline and meane minerall drawne out especially of copper, iron, mercurie, vitriol, sulphur, arsnick, and orpiment, as we shall declare in such place where we shall intreate of curation, for these saltes hauing the office of an exterior Baulme, doo by their heate and subtlenesse, cut and make thinne, thicke humours, which doo choake naturall heate, and doo by their saltnesse and sharpnesse, withstand putrifaction: they doe defend the wound from Gangrena and mortification, and doo prepare the way (being mixed with meet medicines, as hereafter shall be declared) to an easie and short curing, and that without paine.
Farre better medicines surely, then simple precipitate commonly prepared, or Egiptiacum, that specially which hath arsnicke and sublymate in it, or such like, whose common and dayly vse can scarslie allowe, by reason of the great paine which they bring to the patient, of whome we ought to haue a great and speciall regard: the which incommodities may easily be auoyded, by a true and apt spagiricall preparation, which will be a great solace and comforte to the sound patient.
Hitherto concerning the first remedies, which are appointed to the first intention, that is, to the restoring of members brused torne, in which it to be a wise warie phisition, in altering the medicines, and applie them as occasion do serue to sundrie affections and sodaine mutations, that so it be foreseene in all the whole sickenesse, as Galen also hath taught.
The second kinde of medicines, which serue to a more generall intention, pertaine to consolidate togither partes disioyned, the which is chiefely performed by the diligence of the radicall and naturall Baulme, which is present in euerie part, as the principall doer, and chiefest workemaster, being maintained with fit and conuenient nourishment, which balme hath great power and strength in vniting and knitting togither of partes disioyned: and this Baulme, as the cause principall and efficient, must be defended by the Phisition, who must that the strength and efficacie therof, by no meanes be hindred: must keepe from it al outward causes which are noysome and hurtfull thereunto, and also all such as haue power to hinder the consolidation thereof: which he may do both by orderly kinde of dyet, by applications of meete medicines.
These reasons (as may conclude in few words) do signifie to vs two sorts of griefes which wounds by gunshot are accompanied with, that is to say, solution of continuitie, with brusing and rending of the soft, meane, and sound parts of mans bodie: and indeede, it oftentimes so falleth out.
And these two intentions curatiue (as may say) were sufficient for vs, were it not that can easily prooue, as well by reason as experience, and also by the fauour of most brauemen which haue written before me, that these wounds are commonly accompanied with venome and blasting, the which two being adioyned, do require of vs other intentions curatiue.
Notwithstanding we haue not spoken this to the intent to defend those, which haue thought this venome to come of the powder, partly through his essence, and partly by the transmutation thereof: of which opinion was Iohn de Vigo, otherwise an excellent and learned Chirurgion, and nowe lately renewed by one Alphonsus Ferrius an Italian Phisitio~, whose disputation is learnedly confuted by Botallus, Phisition to the king, and also in Chirurgerie most excellent.
For the composition of the pouder especially declares, that the nature thereof can bee by no meanes venemous, in that it consisteth of brimstone, coale, all which simples are without venome, and also so holsome, that they haue great vertue in expelling of strong diseases: and amongst these, brimstone (vpon which Alphonsus especially groundeth his disputation) is most excelle~t for diseases of the Lungs, so be it, it be right and orderly prepared, as we haue taught in our booke, of the Spagirical preparation of medicines: and that same may be learned out of the writinges of Galen, Theophrast, Plinie, Dioscorides, and also by the dayly vse and experience of our France, and other nations.
For the Phisitions dispairing the curing of any notable disease, doo send their patients to the whot Bathes, which are in Bearnia, Germany, Subaudia and Italy, the which waters running through the mettaline vaines of the earth, they do retaine some of the spirit of Sulphur, some of Alome, some of Nyter, some of Vitrioll and such like: yet notwithstanding they are not wont to be deadly, but holsome, and especially those, which tast of Sulphur and Nyter, the which are very profitable against the palsie, Sciatica, stone, long griefes of the stomake, and such other Tartarous diseases, whose cause is resolued and purged by vrine by the diureticall and percing power, which proceedeth of the spirits of these mettals: which dayly experience doth teach by the incredible curation of most desperate diseases.
And thus much of brimstone, which by no meanes is to be thought ve ems, no more then is Peter: which notwithstanding.
doe not thinke that it is all one with the Niter of other ancients, as supposeth, for that must be had out of Macedonie Egypt, where in old time great flore was to be found.
In Macedonie by reason of nature of the ground and Nitrous lake named Clitis, and in Egypt through the water of Nylus: which flowing his did rest in places, and in space of time it is imbibed with the saltnesse of the ground, and by little and little, through the heate of the sunne, was so hardened, that being not preuented, it would consume to the hardnesse of stones: And such was the Nyter of Alexandria, which was the basest of all, and farthest dissenting from the markes of the best, because the chiefest is wont to be porous or hollow, for so it is described by Plinie and Dioscorides: and so, that we may returne to our which is vnlike to Niter, except paraduenture it hath a certaine agreance of qualities therewith, as all saltes haue a certaine agreeance among themselues, notwithstanding we may truely and aduisedly that hath no poyson or venome in it, by reason of the because the is made, either of fatnesse falling from the old wals or cellers, caues and (whereof it seemeth to take this name or else it is made of the fat and rotten flores, stables, and old Churchyards: that it is no more venomous, then is the salt, which we dayly and commonly vse, is easily prooued, in that many men do vse to eate it of common salt: and so (because we dge there is no man that will withstand the of most excellent Phisitions) we may conclude, that through his composition is not venomous, for either of Willow, or other drie wood, (which is the third ingredience thereof) is without al veme, as is proued dayly by the gyrrles which are pale faced, and are sicke with the disease called Pica, much lesse then are the lyquors with which it is imbived, which is wine and Aquavitae.
Thus much of the nature of powder, which if we weigh his composition, is not venemous because none of his simples or ingrediences are venemous: neither can it bee venomous by any meanes by chaunging it into a firie qualitie.
For reason it selfe teacheth that fire both Actu and Potentia doth resist venome.
And this is the venis error in which Alphonsus Fer. is fallen, when hee sought for venome in powder, in which is none at all, as by the particilar examination of the parts and sunples we haue declared: and of this matter, may also the Germaine souldiers be a good for they so soone as cuer they perceiue themselues wounded by shot· by and by, they put no small portion of the powder in a cuppe of and as a holsome medicine drinke it vp.
Now some man wil say, pray you from whence then do you thinke this venome in the doth proceed, it seemeth then, that the cause is in the bullet, when it striketh woundeth the person, and that also being commonly of leade, cannot be venomous, in so much as lead doth greatly agree with our nature, and is verie holsome thereunto: for it greatly to the consolidation and drying of sores, whether it be in his forme and shape, as whe~ places of leade are applied to depresse the swelling lippes of sores, or else the ashes thereof mortified and dissolued are mixed with emplaisters, as it is, being brought to Ceruse and minium, (in which case the authoritie of all the auncient Phisitions is of great force) and in the vse thereof, there appeareth no one signe of venome.
And let passe to declare, how that some doo carrie the bullets long time after they are stroken in their bodies, without any hurt at all: And therefore that we may aunswere to this necessarie question, plainly confesse that lead being plainly and simplie in his owne nature considered, cannot bring any venome to the wound, except it be outwardly poisoned, which thing is not hard to be done, euery man knoweth: neither thinke doth any man doubt, but that leade (although in his substance it is more heauie and then other mettals) is rare and spongious, as all the Philosophers doo confesse, in that it consisteth of an impure cumbustible sulphur, and of great store of grosse, vncleane, and drossie Mercurie (which is the cause that it will be so soone melted: and of his raritie and softnes) and therefore it is most easily imbibed with any quour: the which if it may be done to Iron, whose substance is farre more thicker, faster, and harder, for it hath lesse store of Mercure: let no man doubt but that lead by reasons before aleaged) will farre more easier receiue that venomous qualitie, whereof you may finde the witnesses of many authors, for who is but that the haue often made mention of poisoned weapons, the which the Greekes named [undefined span alphabet], as in the ninth of Uirgils Eneados.

writeth, that among the Ethiopians there groweth a venemous roote, with which they are woont to annoint their arrowes: the same doth Plinie write of the Scithians lib.
and Paulus Aegineta in his sixt booke and fourescore and
chapter, writeth the same to be vsed with the Dacis and Dalmatians: and also Dioscorides affirmeth the same generallie (in his sixt booke and
Neither shall it anie thing preuaile, if they alleadge, that lead being purged from his grosenesse in melting, after will not receiue into it selfe anie contrarie qualitie: for nature teacheth, and experience proueth that all mettals are purged by the fire, and are clensed therewith from their drossie earth, or vncleane susphure, and so thereby their substance becommeth farre more purer, and by this same meanes are mettals prepared, as copper, tinne, and iron it selfe, which through heate of the fire being melted, the filth and feces are purged and settle to the bottome, and that which remayneth cleane pure is called steele as Arist. testifieth.
And although it be proper to these vnperfect mettals in melting to cleanse them selues of their drosse and grosse substance (as it is sayd before) neuerthelesse they may imbibe into themselues a contrarie: for who doubteth but that steele (which is inferior to none in hardnesse) is oftentimes tempered with annost a contrarie qualitie or substance: who would iudge vineger, soote, salt, the water of earthwormes and mouseare, mixed with the iuice of radishrootes, to be of an Iron substance, for Iron being often quenched in that iuice becommeth so hard, that scarsely any man, hauing not made proofe thereof, would credite it: and on the contrarie part, it is made soft by often quenching thereof in the iuice of Hemlocke, sope, and holthocke, the which also commeth to passe in tinne and leade, which being often melted and quenched in the iuice of ye sea Onion, the one loseth his crackling, the other is purged of his blacknesse and tendernesse, which could not come to passe, except they did retaine some part of the spirit and vertue wherewith they are tempered.
It is manifest therefore, that the mettals, although they be purged by the fire, may receiue easily ye substance nature of other things: and meere folly it were to thinke but that a farre more easier mixture may be made of mettaline spirits, being as it were of one kinde, for we see Copper to bee dyed and waxe yeallowe with the spirit of Calemine and Tutiae, and againe to be white with the spirits of Arsnick, Auripigment and such other, whereby it may iustly be concluded, if that mettals and especially lead (whereof shot is commonly made) doth receiue a spirituall substance naturally of things which are of the owne kinde, of the which is made diuers mercuriall stincking and deadly waters, by adding to it the iuice of Libards bane· of the sea Onion, of the Ewe tree, of the herbe Crowfoote, and also of the poison of venemous beastes, the which by the contrarietie of their natures to ours, doe destroy the substance of our bodies: and by such venemous mixtures, say, the shot is so poisoned, that by the onely passing through, it leaueth behind it plaine and manifest tokens of his poison, and that not without great daunger, if not with speedie remedie it be redressed.
For we see also by dayly experience, such venemous compositions, that if onely the heade of an Arrow be tempered therewith, and wounding a person, with drawing of blood, and the Arrow sticke not, but presently passeth away, yet is the poison so subtile and venemous that by little little creeping from the smaller vaines to the greater, and so to the principall parts, the wounded man presently dieth. the which haue declared, partly because it was my chance often to see the like, (and not onely but also other worthy Phisitions, whose names for breuitie let passe) partly that might bring to light these wonderfull and prodigious effectes, which are wont to happen in this case: and that they might not be thought impossible, because they are knowne of a fewe, as more at large meane to declare in that booke de Antidotis, which haue in hand, and doo meane (God willing) shortly to publish, wherein will reueale both true and meete remedies against such poisons: and therefore let no man doubt but that the wound may be poisoned, through the venime of the shot, whether it be of leade or of any other mettall, although some will say the contrarie, because it was neuer their chance to be conuersant with worthy and skilfull men, neither haue obserued the sundrie and myraculous effectes of nature (vnknowne doubt) to antiquitie.
But that we may returne againe to our purpose, we conclude that the shot may be poisoned, not by powring of it in a hole made of purpose, as some would haue it, but by often dipping and quenching them in mercuriall waters and deadly iuices, through ye which their substance may be altered spoiled, and so they doo venime and infect the wound with their euill disposition, although they stay not in the wounde, but presently passe through: of such force is the subtiltie of them, as by experience often made in beasts, hath ben often prooued, the which we meane to confirme with probable reasons in that booke de Antidotis, of which we spake off a little before.
But yet we graunt that the shot passing so swiftly through the body, cannot so sodenly infect with his poison: yet often it commeth to passe that the bullet lieth long in the wound vnknowne to the Chyrurgion: and so thinke there is no man that doubteth, but that in such space it hath time enough to infect with his venime the hurted part, for the more subtiller and spirituall the poison is (as we haue declared before) so much swifter quicker are the effects thereof, by spreading abroade his maligne vapours, through the vaines, arteries and sinewes, whereby it doth infect the spirits naturall, vitall, and animall: choaking them with a certaine disagreeance and contrarietie, ioyning themselues with them, whereby the life of man is extinguished, the which doth consist of a liuely and meete action of the saide three spirits.
And these poisons, the more subtiler and finer they be, so much the more daungerous they are, the which is plainly to be seene by the biting of Vipers and other wastes.
But if any man will frowardly contend (as see some will) that the strength of the fire will take away all the poison of the bullet, will answere them with the same argument which they themselues are wont to vse: for say they, these wounds are not any thing burnt at all, in that the shot (by reason of his hardnesse) is neuer so hot, but that it may be handled with bare hands: and likewise say, that then the fire cannot haue such power that it is able to abolish the poison which is spred through the substance of the bullet, specially when the venime is so mixed with all parts of the shot, that it hath infected with his venime all the substance thereof.
Neither am mooued in that Aristotle lib. de Coelo cap.
writeth, that by the impulsion of the aire, the dartes or arrowes waxe so hot that the leade thereof melteth, the which by the thing it selfe and dayly experience is knowne to be false, and especially in gun bullets, which are sent out by fire, and are carried away farre more swifter then any arrowe: but if this might be graunted to Aristotle, yet the witnesse of auncient writers (of whom mention before is made) doth plainly proue that the poison therby, cannot by any means be extinguished: much lesse the~ can it be ouercome with a far lesser heate.
Nay, say, that not onely, that the venime cannot be taken away with so smal heate, but also affirme, that if the bullet it self should be molten, yet very hardly thereby the poison would be purified, for so greatly deeply is it spred mingled wt the whole substa~ce therof, that for the most part there is not one part left vnaltered.
Likewise the spirite of Arsnicke, Calaminae or Tuthiae, being mingled with gray or yellowish Copper, dooth not at the first melting vanish away, yet we count not those like to them which wee spake off before, such as be deadly, being only outwardly farre from the principall parts applied, through their hid and secret qualitie, as the effectes thereof doth most plainly declace, By this we trust, it is manifestly prooued that shot may be poysoned, which verie quickly will worke hys effectes, especially if it stay in the wound: as oftentimes we haue seene, that poyson being heated with a small fire and scarsly made warme, would very hardly be quenched or taken away.
By which reasons it may be concluded yt shot may be venemous, but not thorow the pouder (which we haue proued to be quite voyd of venom) but by dipping and seasoning the shot in poyson, which oftentimes we haue seene, wherefore it behoueth a wise and expert not to be selfe minded, for as this thing happeneth not dayly, yet manie times it commeth to passe, and yet not oftentimes, when a sudden battell is fought when eyther through ignorance, or want of poyson it is not practised, but it is rather wrought in defence of Cities, being besieged, or of set purpose, when anie is minded to murther another, to which most wicked deuise (in these our vnhappie dayes) Princes and noble men are more in danger, then common souldiers, in this place we will ouerpasse the signes and tokens, whereby it may be knowen whether the shot be or no, hauing a more fitter place therefore, in the chapter of the true and orderly curation thereof.
This place requireth that we reason of the varietie which is found in such woundes, that is, of the burning, which sometimes is, and sometimes is not, and to say my minde therein, cannot allow their opinion (moued thereunto by the authoritie of diuers learned men) which write that the cause of the burning and blasting comes through the shot, which they by reason of his swift mouing and motion of the ayre, (through which it swiftly passeth) waxeth so hote, that it hath the strength of a cauterise which they labour to proue, by the effect following, that is, by the escharre, great inflamation and blacknesse, and other such accidentes, which are woont to accompanie burning.
Of this will not with manie wordes contend, insomuch that the nature of the shot being wisely waied (which is commonly of lead, and therefore can hardly abide such force of heate without melting) their error with small is conuinced, and so muche the easier, beeing alreadie confuted by manie learned reasons of Laurentius Loubertus, a most excellent phisition, and famous in our countrey, whose wise and learned iudgement (I doubt not) wil also verifie with me, that this blasting of the wound, is not through the heate of the shot, which comes farre of, out of an Iron peece, But it may be when one is wounded by shot standing hard by, asdayly we see doe happen, that they stand so nigh the peece, that with the wound, their garmentes verie beard are also scorched, which happeneth onely through the burning of the powder, which firie and burning with the shot flieth out of the mouth of the gunne: which if anie man saith it cannot flee farre, will answere hym by the contrarie that it may verie well flie so farre, that if anie man touch his bodie he may plainely feele it, before it be quite extinguished: And againe if anie more captious will demaund, whether that the harnesse and apparell be not sufficient to defend the fleshe from burning by the powder, doubt not but the harnesse hath much more force in defending thereof, then hath a doublet made of a beastes skinne or such other kinde of apparell, the which with the verie shirt oftentimes wee haue seene by shot burned, neyther then is it to be doubted, but that the aire beeing on fire, following and driuing the pellet into the wounded person, but thereby the flesh may also be burned: But what will they say then, when the gunne is discharged euen close at the bodie, and the wound happeneth in an vncloathed and naked place, doth euerie souldier weare gauntlets and helmets: yea oftentimes it happeneth the gunne to be discharged at the verie face, necke, handes and open mouth, as they which are dayly conuersant in the warres can beare me witnesse farre better then those which dispute of the matter in their closets (and according to the prouerb) without hazard of gunshot.
Surely denie not, but when one is wounded so nigh the Ordinance, but that the wound may be burned and blasted, in which case, they are greatly deceaued, which thinke that such woundes are alwaies without blasting, and doe iudge the heate to come onely of the pellet, and therby do make rules so general, that they may haue many exceptions, which easily may be gathered by that which we before haue spoken, intreating of the venome and blasting happening to these woundes, Thus much haue thought it good to declare vnto you concerning the nature essence of wounds by shot, and of the sundrie accidentes which may happen thereunto: the which for the most part, are woont to be, solution of continuitie with brusing and rending of the partes, which requireth two intentions curatiue, that is consolidation, and restoring of the brused and torne partes, but if it be accompanied with burning (as it may be) then must we repaire to the third intention, that is to the extinguishing of the fire, and drawing out of the heate, yea and last of all to the fourth, that is to some wholesome remedie named of the Greekes Alexipharmacon, as often as we shall thinke that there is some venom in the wound, hauing speciall regard to the moste dangerous discommodities, and to finde out so manie curatiue, and conseruatiue, and preseruatiue intentions, as sundrie woundes ioyned with sundrie accidentes shall require.
Of the differences, tokens and sundrie signes of woundes by Gunshot.
THose which more heedily consider those partes which by shot are wounded, and doe wisely weye their office, necessarie substance, situation, sence and figure, and likewise the essence or maner of the hurt, and the proper differences thereof, may presently see and iudge, as well by reason as experience, what and howe manie intentions are necessarie to the curation therof, and so may prouide indications much able to sundrie accidentes and present griefes, and thereby to preuent things which are as yet to come, as Galen teacheth, lib. Met.
To which purpose it greatly auayleth a perfect knowledge of proper differences, and a consideration of the greatnesse or smalenesse, deepenesse or hollownesse of the wound: the which differences are taken (as of the cause efficient) of the manifold figures, substances, shapes, and kinde of mettall of the shot, for some of them are long, some plaine, some great, some litle, some verie slender, which causeth that the wound is of sundrie sortes· some strike awaie the member, other pearce through, tearing and rending the sinewy parts, and bursting the bones, or sometime by onely brusing and not pearcing the flesh, according to the sundrie vnlike kinde of shot, or to the nighnesse or farre distance thereof, or according to the state of the bodie being hurted, that is eyther naked or couered, yea sometimes so safe it is defended with so sure a corslet (and as we may say) so te~pered that it cannot be pearred, neyther the bodie by anie meanes be wounded: And if it bee wounded it is verie little and without danger, in that the violence of the shot is weakened by the hardnesse and strongnesse of the armour, and especiallie being the shot of no great ordinance, but of some small peece, and all these differences (without doubt) may be referred to one kinde, that is, to the solution of continuitie, which sometime is seene and somtimes is hidden, that is manifest, which is perceiued by handling and sight, and when a plaine wound appeareth with wannesse of the fleshe (as it were an Escare) ioyned with great dolor, and specially when the sinewes are hurt which doth plainly shew vnto vs, beside the signes of a wound (which doth not a litle auaile to this purpose) that the same is made by gunshot.
hidden or secret wound is, without anie manifest breaking of the skinne, which the Grecians call [undefined span alphabet] and is knowen by shedding of the bloud betweene the flesh and the skinne, and doe stayne the hurted part with a violet and wannie colour.
These are the common signes of such woundes, wherein a consideration is had of onely brusing and solution of continuitie, but insomuch as we haue taught in the former chapter, that such woundes may sometimes be accompanied with venom and contrarie to the opinion of some, it behoueth the Chirurgion to imploy all his studie and labour in this case, to iudge and discerne euerie affection by the tokens and signes proper thereunto, because such affections (as we said before) be often ioyned to such woundes, and let him seeke out a proper remedie for ech of them, and diligently consider, which of them is most dangerous, for that (as Galen teacheth) is not onely first, but also chiefest to be cured: that insomuch, as sometimes wee are compelled by reason thereof not onely to let passe the other accidentes, but also to make new, that thereby we may remedie that which is most dangerous.
And this is the very cause, why the knowledge of these wounds poisoned by shot are so necessarie (as in the Chapter before we haue taught) least that the sodaine death which many times comes thereby, be imputed to the corruption of the aire and other first qualities: when commonly the fault lieth in the wilfulnesse and vnskilfulnesse of the Phisition, perswading themselues that these wounds by no meanes may be venemous, therby they refuse the true kinde of healing: And some no doubt, will attribute it to the aboundance of blood, and to the euill iuice of the bodies called by ye Greeks Cachochimia, the which two verily doe acknowledge, with Galen confesse, haue great force in hindering of al wounds, and the chiefest causes of euill accidences, notwestanding if the signes, which signifieth venom, hath in the~ any thing co~mon, with these yt happen to gunshot, where only co~tusion is ioyned yet may they easily be discerned, whether they be great or litle or waightie fearefull accidents and extraordinarie, which oftentimes come to passe.
Therefore if the flesh be more wanner then it is wont to be in common wounds by shotte, and as it were deade, with an euill colour of all the whole member, with intolorable and extraordinarie aches, and also with inflamation and pricking and shooting paines, especially about the wound, with vnlustinesse and heauinesse of all the whole bodie, and many times burning feuers, with sounding and alienation of the minde: all these doo testifie that there is some venemous qualitie ioyned with the wound, especially when there can no manifest cause be found out by ye Phisition, whereof all these euill accidents should proceede, which sometimes haue seene to happen in simple wounds, yea without the tearing of any sinewes.
But more certainer signes of this matter may be if any tokens appeare outwardly, which may bee learned at the mouth of the patient, and by relation of his familiar friendes and companions: considering also the manner, the place, and the person being wounded.
But the surest signe of all is learned by the bullet, if it may be found, for if you cut him in two parts, you shall see him darke and mixed with a purple and violet colour, vnlike to the colour of other shot being cut, which is wont to haue a yealow colour.
Then maist thou surely affirme that the shot was poisoned, whereby the very substance thereof was altered, as plaincly is seene by his inward colour, which is greatly altered, wanne and darke (as we said before.)
Proofe thereof also may be made in the fire, which was said (not rashly) to haue great force in purging of all poison.
Because such things which are strong poison in deede, doe consist of a spirituall and ayriall substance, and therefore by force of fire doe easily vanish into the aire, yet not with a smal heate such as is felt in going out of ye shot, as Ambrosius Pareus thought, which rather in processe of time woulde fixe it and make it not volatle, and so consequently vnhurtfull.
But by a most strong heate of fire, such as they vse in subliming, for in that force of fire, ye mercurie is eleuated and vanished away: so likewise is the Arsnicke orpigment, and such other spirits, and for that cause they cannot be purged, except they be pressed in the cold necke of the subliming vessels: and so the suspected bullet being melted and kept in great heate a sufficient time, then a darke and stinking smoke ariseth, couering the mettall (of which smoke or fume you must heware) which after the melting is found not onely vnpurged, but also appeareth blacke, wanne, and darke, which commeth through the venemous fume, spreding it selfe about the mettall, and this is an infallible signe that the shott was poysoned, whereby the wound may be venomed (as said before) and that according to the time, as it remaineth in the wound.
These be the signes whereby a poysoned wound is knowne, which are the more dangerous to be iudged, the more they doe weaken the strength of the patient: Likewise, blistering, bladdering, pricking paine, drinesse, contraction, and hardnesse of the skinne, doth manifestly shewe that the wound is also burnt with powder, the which may be learned more surely by relation of the wounded person, which can commonly declare whether he ware wounded, nigh or farre off, which also may be gathered by the burning of the vesture: and it behoueth the Phisition to take heede diligently of all these thinges, because they are of great waight and may bring great hurt to the wound, and hinder greatly the curation thereof: and through aboundance of fiures and other grieuous accidents, which commonly insue, vnlesse timely with wholesome medicines they be preuented, as Galen commandeth in
where he teacheth the maner of curing of an vlcer (ioyned or coupled with another griefe) not as the curation of a simple vlcer: but first that affection must be remoued, and then the vlcer to be cured.
Furthermore a sounder iudgement in this case may be giuen by a heedie consideration of the saying of Galen written in his method where he teacheth that diseases may be dangerous, for three causes: first by reason of the worthinesse of the part affected, secondarily through the vehemencie and strength of the griefe, lastly by the malignitie and euill qualitie of the disease: Therefore if the spirituall parts, or if the braine, and especially the substance thereof be wounded it is deadly: Likewise the lunges, the midriffe, the stomacke, the splene, and kidnie being wounded, doth co~monly bring death, for they also by reason of their offices are reckoned among the principall partes: of no lesse ieopardie are the wounds of the guts, especially in the smaller, where there is no fleshe: also in the bladder, which cannot be aglutinated, because they are vnbloudie parts: and likewise woundes wherein the head or stomacke is pearced through, are counted verie dangerous, and the more greater and deeper ye wounds be with tearing of the sinewes and brusing of the bones, so much the more dangerous they are: and especiallie those which happen in the head with fracture of Cranion, and also suche as be nigh the ioyntes, through great and vehement accidentes insuing hereon, but woundes ioyned with venome, although in shew they be but small, yet are they moste dangerous, because by the contrarie substance excessiue qualitie thereof, not onely the naturall disposition, but also the verie substance of the bodie, is altered and changed, and especially when the wound is with breaking of the skinne, which by thicknesse thereof doth defend the flesh (which otherwise it woulde, so that the poyson be not subtill) that the contagiousnesse thereof doth not infect the bloud, spirites and humors, and consequently the principall partes, whereby death commonly insueth.
Moreouer all these woundes are to be counted the more dangerous, in case they be accompanied with euill accidentes and great passions, and also the passion filled with euill humours: and so much the more if at that time anie common sicknesse doth raigne in the campe caused by the aire, whose qualitie although it be simple: and not subiect to putrifaction, yet oftentimes it bringeth great alteration to the qualities, being infected with noysome and stincking fumes, which oftentimes comes to passe in great hostes, and chiefly in that part which is molested with composts, and dead carcases of beastes and men: from whence arise the noysome stincking fumes, whereby the souldiers are afflicted: also vnstablenesse of the weather comming with tempestes, doth greatly hurt these woundes, and oftentimes put the partie in great hazard, and chiefly when a drie winter goeth before with northen blastes, and a wet spring insueth with southerly windes, through which many grosse humours are ingendred, which with that vnstablenesse of weather, are stirred and corrupted: and the euilenesse of the aire ioyning therewith, bringeth forth pestilent and burning feuers, with inflamacions, Gangrena and mortification, yea and at the last, death it selfe, as Hipoc. witnesseth in the third Aphorisme in lib. Epid.
Neyther may we ouerpasse the loose and vnorderly kinde of dyet vsed not onely among the common souldiers, but also with the Captaines, rulers, legates and protectors.
Which oftentimes are inforced to take such foode as comes to hand, eyther hote or cold, raw or sodde, good or bad, yea sometimes, pulse, fruites and berries: and to drinke stincking waters, new, sower and dead wines.
Contrarie to the vsage and nature of diuers, through which they are infected.
And through such vnorderly kind of dyer, hurtfull common diseases are to arise in the campes, verie dangerous to the wounded, and that thereby the bloud is annoyed, and the humours infected: and so the euilenesse of the wound is increased, and sundrie accidentes doe insue.
And on the contrarie part, suche woundes are to be iudged lesse dangerous and more cur able, which are accompanied with fewe passions, and are farre from the spirituall and partes, and are without venome, tearing of the sinewes, and fracture of the bones.
And whensoeuer the Phisition doth iudge the wound to be mortall, yet would not haue the patient straite to be forsaken as a dead man, but to applie the best medioines, for manie times nature holpen by Arte doth worke miracles, whereby the Emperickes (to the great infamie of Phisicke) doth oftentimes purchase great fame and glorie.
For being bold on the strength of nature, they take in hand desperate cures forsaken, as dead men by the Phisitians, and get thereby to themselues great credite, and to the Phisitions no lesse shame, as by hearesay a two yeares past happened to a noble Prouinciall named Unissius being in the kinges armie against was by shot pearced through and forsaken of the Phisitions, who iudged the substance of his liuer to be perished, and yet was cured by some of his noble friendes, with medicines of no great price, The which rare euent may be a notable of the strange effecies of nature, which oftentimes deceiueth the iudgement of moste learned Phisitions: whome would wish neuer to be destitute of singular remedies against desperate and haynoos griefes, as Cornelius Celsus teacheth that in extreame and desperate cases, it is better to applie some remedie, then vtterly to giue it ouer.
THe curation of such wounds, doth consist of two generall intentions, and one particular, the two generall are an orderly kind of dyet, and an expulsion of humors, the other by an apt application of inedicines.
And that we may keepe an orderly and methodicall kinde of teaching, first of all wee will intreate of the order of dyet, which is conuenient for such wounded persons, the on whereof is knowne to bring great commoditie to the sicke and wounded.
And such a kinde of dyet is to be prescribed to the hurted, as is woont to be ordained in other diseases, that is, a mesurable obseruation of the sixe things not naturall, but a more particular consideration is taken, by the season of the yeare, by the nature, strength, and disposition of the partie: and by his accustomable vse in eating and drinking, as Hipoc. doth plentifully declare in lib. de vict. ratione in morbis acutis.
For one kinde of diet is meete for chronicall and dayly griefes, and another for sharpe and vehement sickenesses: and that also variable according to the beginning, state, and decreasing of the disease.
And let no man doubt but that also the disposition of the Region, and nature of the season of the yeare, may alter the dyet, in that some regions are hotte and some colde, and some seasons some moist and rainy, and among all, the nature and temperament of the wounded is diligently to be obserued, in so much, as the bodies being full of euill iuices, the larger their dyet is, the more hurtfull it is to them.
The strength also of the partie is to be wayed, and according to that we must not onely prescribe a dyet, but also thereunto apply the ministration of all our medicines.
As concerning custome, there is none but hath great respect thereof, in that suddaine alterations are so much the more daungerous, as they shall digresse from the dayly custome and vse of ye sick, as Hipoc. teacheth in lib. de vict. ration.
in morbis acutis: and reason it selfe sheweth, for if any man should prescribe a generall straite order of dyet to all alike, which by shot are wounded, (without any consideration of the thing aforesaide, as commonly they doo) neglecting que their dayly dyet, when some there bee, which make three or foure meales a day, yea almost euery houre: there bee, which in their sicknesse may not (without great hinderance) forbeare wine, to whome if wee should commaunde a straite dyet, it would straight fal out as Hippoc. in the foresaid place co~cludeth: where writing of those which make three or four meales a day, if they lost but one, they are weakened: and contrariwise such as are wont to keepe a slender dyet, if they eate and drinke more then ordinarie, or out of season, are incontinent agreeued: and therefore according to the minde of that worthy man, we must indeuour our selues, to prescribe such a dyet to our patient, as he was most accustomed to in his health: and let it be holden, that nature is chiefly comforced with such thinges as he is dayly and by familiar custome vsed vnto, and are farre more holesome, better, and healthier (although it seemeth to our intentions) then such as for the patients health are deuised strange and vnwonted, because by their sudden mutation, they contrarie nature: and indeede this is the cause why the learned Phisitions of Germany doo iudge, that the vsed and dayly dyet is to be retained, and doo permit their wounded persons to drinke wine, which otherwise would thinke themselues vndone, in that the vse of waters is so daungerous to them.
The which haue seene vsed, not onely in France, but also (and that with better successe) in Germany, where the wine for the most part is more waterish and thinner, then in France.
The which haue not spoken: as though would haue no other kinde of dyet prescribed to the wounded, then such as they were accustomed to in their health: neither am so throughly to it, but that thereby might admonish the that they prescribe not so straite a dyet as they are wont commonly to doo, and that they should keepe a measure both in qualitie quantitie of meate and drinke, as the state of the disease shall require: for in the state of the sicknesse (for auoyding of inflamations and aches) a slender dyet is to bee kept, as is taught by Hipoc lib. de vict. rat. in morb. acut.
Moreouer, the dyet is to be prescribed as the time of the yeare requireth, for the stomackes of some are whot, others cold, so be apt to digest, and are to be considered according to the te~perame~t of the patient, for (as Galen teacheth) some things are allowed to Phlegmatike, which must be retained from the sanguine Cholerike: as we said before, co~sideration must be had of the age, strength, and disposition: and in the very beginning of the sicknes so straite a dyet is not to be kept, but by and litle it must be deminished vntil the end of the state of ye disease, but so as ye strength of the patient may suffer it, which thing must be warely obserued, And so these things rightly considered, we must come to the administration of the things not naturall, and so satisfie our intent.
After this it behooueth to choose a drie and temperate aire: for such is required of all wounds, because by exiccation they are conglutinated: but and if any man obiect, that it lieth not in our power, to bring a drie aire to the sicke, when as there is not any thing to bee founde, more moister (as Aristotle teacheth in the seconde chapter of his Meteors) in so much it exceedeth the water in moisture, which in sight seemeth moister, in that it moistneth things dipped therem, which the aire cannot doo by reason of the subtilnesse therof.
This may easily be answered, that such aire may be chosen, and by art corrected, and so made meeter to our purpose intent: for it is not vnknowne, but that some places and houses are whotter, dryer, moister, and colder then others be, for those which be nigher the North are colde, and such as are Sowtherly are whot, euen as the sunne is nearer or farther from them.
Also the situation of the country is to be considered, for some are hilly, some marrish, others adioyning nigh to lakes, standing pooles and riuers: by the varietie whereof, the qualitie of the aire is changed and altered.
Who is ignorant but that the nature of the men of Asia is farre differing from those of Europe, the which Hipoc. lib.
De aere Locis etaquis) doth attribute to the change varietie of times, which causeth the nature of countries to be more rougher and harder.
and that is the cause that countrie and men be of an vnlike nature and disposition to those which are bredde in cities and vallies farre from the
What shal we say now of the situation of the cittie of Ferraria, or Florence, of the which in the first, all wounds in the head are deadly, in the other al the hurts of the legges are vncurable, for which cause Hippocrates, treating of this matter, saith that the nature of the south wind is altered, by reason of the countries, by which it is carried, which are some hotter, some colder then some: for hee writeth that first it comes from cold and Isie countries (whereof winds are ingendred, as Aristot. in the second of his Meteors sheweth, and that they are of the same nature at the first, as the Northwinds are, which are frostie and colde: as those which inhabite, these countries doo feele:) And after being carried by the South, and beames of the sunne waxeth so hot, that through the heate thereof, it looseth his coldnesse, and burneth the herbes, and makes the inhabiters thereof to be dry, and so passing ouer the seas, and imbibbing the moisture thereof, it looseth the great drynesse it had receiued, and becomes moiste, as is seene and perceiued in all Italy, and also in that part of Fraunce, which is named Occitania.
And this is the reason why wee iudge the to bee hurtfull to woundes: because that this moisture is ioyned with heate, which is the mother of putrifaction, as wee haue before prooued.
The like may bee saide of the which in sundrie regions is verie wholsome: and withstandeth putrifaction: and againe in some very unwholsome: insomuch that the pestilence or anie other disease raigning) is thereby increased.
the cause whereof (as we sayd before) is to be attributed to the varietie of countries: and situation of Cities, being in low and marrish places, wherebyth proper nature of the windes may be altered: and so the bodies of men are corrupted and filled with all humours.
These thinges waied, and the season of the yeare considered, (which are diuers, and vnlike by reasons before alleadged) and sundrie mutations, which dayly happen and alter the qualitie of the aire, as Hippocrates hath taught, libro de locis aquis) we must choose fit and profitable aire, where the wounded person may remayne.
But insomuch that, that is hard and vnpossible to be done, because the wounded, by bitternesse of the griefe can neyther ride nor goe, but commonly are compelled to stay in the place, where they are wounded, or at the least the next adioyning thereunto, yet specially that place where the campe hath long stayed, is aboue all to be shunned, because the ayre thereby is infected: and also moyst and marrish places are to be auoyded, for thence doe noysome and thicke vapors ascend.
And contrariwise such aire is to be chosen, that is farre distant from moist and wet groundes, for such is pute cleare wholesome.
And let the windows next the north be open rather then those next the South: but and if that shall seeme colde, it may be amended by heate of fire made in the chamber, and also sometime corrected with odiferous thinges, as Masticke, Roses, Jumper Berries, such like.
And in the sommer you shal vse lauing of the house with Oxicrato, and strew the chamber with rushes and greene herbes and leaues of the wythie, or vine tree, and after this order may the aire be applied and corrected to the health of the patient, as the part hurted shall require.
For woundes and hurtes of the head or co~missures thereof cannot suffer so cold an ayre (by reason of the nipping thereof) as woundes in other places may.
And as concerning his diet, it is no doubt, but it must be ordered according to the maner of the hurt (as Hippocrates hath taught, and as the nature of the patient is able to abide, auoyding sodaine changes, for such (as we said before) are verie dangerous, let his meate be such as breedeth good iuice, and the quantitie thereof the lesse, especially vntill the state of the disease be past: in which time a more slenderer dyet must be kept then afterward: and let the bread be well leauened, and throughly baked.
And let him vse the fleshe of small birdes, as thrushes or such like, eating therewith the iuice of an Oringe or Lemon or Greenesauce made of Sorrell, to get him a stomacke: Also which is made of bread, and a chicken first boyled with buglose, sorrel, lettice such kind of hearbs: and this broath he may vse in ye morning to mollifie his belly: raisons of the sun, and prunes in this case be very wholsome: so are likewise Damascenes, Grapes condit, Barly picked and sodden, Almond milke and Oten milke: all these are very wholsome, and chiefely in the beginning, for then the wounded commonly refuse all meates sauing broathes, and such as are liquide.
But after the state of the wounde hee may vse Partriges, Chickens, young Capons, and Mutten minced with his owne iuice, and the iuice of an Oringe: and all other meates are wholsome, which are sweete, delicate, of good iuice and light of digestion.
The poorer sort may eate broath made of Mutten and Veale, and of a Chicken if they be able, boiled with raisins and prunes, or such like, as their ability will extende: and let them forbeare grosse meats of euill iuice and hard of digestion, and all water fowles, and beasts: and especially pigge flesh, and salt meates, and others that be sharpe: and all kinde of spices, let them drink Prisan, Hipoc. water, and such as are sanguine or cholericke may vse onely water filtred and boiled: let others (especially such as before were not vsed to drinke wine delaide with water) haue thinne Claret delayd with water, and that in the beginning, if so be there be no feuer or inflamation: and as concerning labour or rest, let this Italian prouerbe followed, La gamba al'letto, la man al pecto, with the aduise of Hipoc. lib. de vlcer. which saith, that rest is verie meete for all wounded persons, and labour hurtfull: and therefore the Phisitions doo very foolishly in in commanding exercise of bodie to them that haue neede of suche rest and quietnesse, that oftentimes they cannot moue themselues for paine: but in steede of exercise they may vse frication, on the whole partes and contrarie side: and then they shall doe the office of medicine hauing vertue of keeping backe, and shall turne aside the fluxes of humours comming to the affected member, and also drie vp superfluous moistures ingendred by rest, as Hipocrates hath taught lib. de Diaeta.
And as for sleepe, let it be granted when nature seemeth to require it, for sleepe (in all diseases) is verie necessarie to concoction, and doth reuiue ye strength lost and by bleeding, paine, and other passions, yet heede must be taken, that if the wound be inwardly, and venomous: the sleepe be not to large, least thereby plentie of humours flowe to the affected part: for the bloud with sleeping, is alwaies drawen into the bodie.
Moreouer all vexations of the minde are verie hurtfull, and especially anger, which troubleth the stomacke, and causeth the humors to be more thinner and subtiller, whereby more aboundance of fluxis comes to the affected part, and manie other euill passions and accidentes.
haue willingly passed ouer repletion, and emptinesse, in that meane to intreate of them, by themselues, and so without repetition to declare my minde.
Of the second intention, that is of purging and euacuation of humors by bloodletting and purgation.
NOt rashly and without great cause, did Galen in his Method call to remembrance, and highly commend this noble saying of Hipp.
Medicum opportere non modo naturae imitatorem esse, verum etiam eoru mque cum sua sponte eueniunt, conferunt.
For it is office of the Phisition to supplie the wants of nature, and to preuent such hurtfull accidentes, as may happen thereunto, and that by indications taken of the waightinesse of the griefe, the which find to be two, that is bloudletting and purgation, both of the which are very necessarie to the curing of wounds by shot: which for three causes may iustly be reckoned among most dangerous: and therefore it is verie necessarie to drawe bloud in the curation of these woundes, that in the verie beginning, that so thereby the fluxe of humours in the wounded part, be stayd, and impostumation kept backe: neither must we stay for the digestion of the wound, and deferre it till the beginning and state thereof be past, as Auicen thought, whose opinion is not onely against all reason, but also contrarie to the authoritie of Hipocrates, who teacheth, that if any thing is to be moued, it must be done in the verie beginning, Moreouer this bloudletting must be done in ye contrarie or opposit part then especially, when it is not doubted that the shot was venomous: which if it should be, then is reuulsion forbidden, for the venome is to be drawen out by scarification of the wound it selfe, or a little belowe and partes about it, taking heede that it creepe not farre (as his nature is) to the noble and principall partes, as more at large we will declare when we intreate of the curation thereof.
The fittest time for letting of bloud is the morning, except we be forced otherwise eyther by ouermuch fluxe of bloud or anie other accident, and before we doe it, it shall not be amisse to minister a glister to lose the belly: and also in letting of bloud we must not onely weigh the greatnesse of the wound, but also the fulnesse of the whole body, and according thereunto limit the quantitie of bloud, eyther more or lesse: neither must wee forget to consider the age of the patient, the time of the yeare, the nature of the place, diuers other things, which must be committed to ye iudgement of the skilfull Phisition, which may wisely weigh yt which is written by Galen lib.
Purgations are no lesse necessarie in the curing of these woundes then is bloudletting, for two causes, the one the greatnesse of the griefe, the other the aboundance of ill iuice: which may be gathered by these words of Galen, writte~ lib.
Purgatio non in sola cacochymia conuenienter suscipitur, sed (sicut missio sanguinis) vel propter ipsius abundantiam, vel propter morbi magnitudinem: ita purgatio, propter abundantiam alteruis cuiusdam succi, propter vim morbi adhibetur.
Neyther are they blamelesse, which contemne this way of curing, as though it were little nothing pertaining to cure woundes by shot, when as both reason and experience shew the contrarie to those, which (following Hipocrates and Galen as captaines) haue set downe a methodicall and orderly curation of such woundes: for purgation (saith Hipocrates) is profitable for diuers vlcers, Preterea vulner ibus capitis, item ventris, tum inferioris, tum superioris. atque etiam articulorum, And he addeth also, quae exeduntur, quae serpunt, quae diuturna sunt: etiam quaecunque sunt, per aluum purganda esse.
The which remedie must by and by, and at the verie beginning be vsed, yea immediatly after the letting of bloud, partly that we may auoyd the humors following to the afflicted part, by the contrarie way which the Grecians call [undefined span alphabet]: as if the wound be in the ouer part, we must purge by the lower part, and if in the lower part, wee must purge by vomite) and partly, that thereby wee drawe away the humors imimpacted and sticking to the wounded part and sides thereof, by deriuation, as both Hipocrates and Galen hath taught, But if anie will alleadge, by the authoritie of ancient Phisitions, that purgation is not necessarie to healthfull bodies, and suche as abound not with excrementes, as commonly the bodies of souldiers be, (otherwise they were not able to sustayne such great labour, and that they verie greeuously abide purgations, and therewith are brought into swoundinges, and whirlinges of the braines (the which discommodities are to be kept from nature) for when the purgation findeth not his proper to worke vpon, it setteth vppon the bloud and flesh, and so expelleth that which is necessarie and good: yet for all this, except such be purged, they commonly fall in great hazard, and worse passions, as feuers, mmamations, great aches, and such like, which commonly follow these wounds: and therefore the euacuation of good humours is necessarie, that wee may preuent that which is to come: and by this meanes wee shall not onely bring the wounded part in good temperature, but also the whole body in better state.
Now then, insomuch as purgations are necessarie in these great and dangerous woundes, it behoueth it to be done with great diligence heede taking: first we must consider the state, custome, and age of the patient, also the nature of the time and qualitie of the countrey: and so in other cases we must searche out the humour moste abounding, and the place affected, whereby we may learne, what humour is to be purged, and how and what way most easily it will be expelled, then aboue all let vs choose such purgations, as most easily safely may be ministred, for can scarse allowe the vse of violent ones which were in vse in Galens and Hipocrates time, because in operation they are verie hote, and thereby doe easily breede feuers, and disturbe the bloud, and so bring the wound to inflamation impostumation, of which sortes are Coloquintida and Elleborus, especially vnprepared, But we may safely vse Cassia, Manna, Rubarbe, Sene, Polipodie, Agaricke, but chiefly their extracts, the which more safer, with as much profite may be vsed in these greene woundes, as the other may in dayly and vehement vlcers: and because the bellies of some by taking a medicine are not loosed by reason of the varietie of natures (for some are hardily purged, with others a small purgation worketh, and there be, which by onely smelling thereunto, are greatly purged) we must therefore take heede that wee giue not a strong purgation to our patient, except first we haue had proofe of his nature, But and if the ordure be hard and baked in the guttes, and so the purgation be hindered, it were necessarie first to loose it, with some gentle medicine giuen by the mouth, as a bole mad of an {ounce}. of with Suger and Aniseede, or else made soluble by ministring some gentle glister: of which sorte is this following.
Take of mallowes, violets, herb Mercurie, betes, of each a handful: of the greater colde seedes and of Anise an {ounce}. i. of Barly, flowers of Chamomill, of Borage, and Nenuphare or water Lily Ana. p. i.
Let a decoction be made, and to one pinte thereof, adde of Cassia extract with the leaues of Sene, and dia Prun, simp. or trifera persica ana {dram}. vi. honie and oyle of Violets Ana {ounce}. ii. misce pro enemate.
The day following, let him take some medicine, as shal be most meetest, as his body doth abound either with flcame or and anie other humour: for more easier doth it worke, and better is the purgation when the right humour is purged.
Take the roote of Irios, Eupatory, Pimpinel and Acorus, ana. {dram} iii. the roote of Mechoacan, Oke Ferne new, the pith of Cartamy seedes, ana. {ounce} ss. Aniseede, Raisins and Licorise, ana {dram} ii. Veronica, Betony, and Scabios ana. m. i· of the flowers, of ech p. i. the leaues of Sene {dram}. ii. let them be boyled and strained, and infuse thereunto of the troches, of Agaricke {dram} ii. and after the expression, put thereto {ounce}i. of sirupe of Roses solutiue, and for those that be strong, adde to it {dram}i. ss. or {dram}ii. of Diaphenicon: and for the cholericke vse this following.
Take succorie, endiue, sorrell, lettice, purslane, fluelin, ana m. i. raisines {dram}ii. Iuiubarum, sweete prunes, ana paria iiii. the seedes of melons, dodder, citrons, purslane, and anise, ana {dram}i. ss. of the cordiall flowers, of ech one little handful, yeallow sanders {dram}. ss. let a decoction be made, and to a dose thereof, adde {dram}iii. of chosen rubarbe, and and {dram}ii. of Citren Myrabolans, with {scruple} i. of synamom, and to that being expressed, add of the sirupe of Cicorie, with rubarbe and sirupe of roses solutiue, of ech one ounce, and thereof make a potion: and for the stronger sort add to {dram}ii. of the Elec of the iuice of roses of or els {dram}ii. of the Elect. de citro sol. {dram}ii.
But if the complexion of the patient bee melancholy, and that humor aboundeth, this potion following is profitable.
Take Radicum eupatorii Mesues, siue gratiolae, and turmentil, of ech {ounce} ss. Polipodie, Asarabacca, Tamarindes, ana {dram} iii. aniseed raiso~s, ana {dram}ii. fluellin, scabious, burrage, buglos, fumitere, ceterach, politrici ana m. ss. sinamon {dram} ss.

In so much as oftentimes, not one but all humors abounde mixed, and spred throughout all the body, that happeneth oftentunes, in that case, minister this potion following, especially if there be any suspicion of venime.
Take the rootes of Turmentill, of Angelica, of Gentlan, of ech {dram} iii. of Acorus, of Pimpinell, of ech {dram} ii. of Polipody of the Oke, of the pith of of ech {ounce} ss. of Endiue, of Succorie, of Agrimony, Cetrach, Hops· Fumiterre, of ech half a handful, of Licorise and Raisons, of ech {dram} i. ss.
Of Damasin Primes, iiii. of the seeds of Endiue, of Sorell, of Citri and of Purslaine, of ech one dram: of Aniseed one dram a halfe: of ye Cordiall flowers, of the flowers of broome and Tameriske one little handfull, of Sene leaues {dram} iii. them for a dose, and infuse in the decoction thereof being strained, of ii. {dram}. and {scruple}iiii. of Agaricke, with one scruple of Spicknard another of Ginger, and in the expression thereof dissolue one ounce of the syrope of Roses solutiue, and make thereof a potion, and let it be ministred, yea twise, and it bee neede.
Many other sorts of Purgations may be made, which are to be referred to the iudgement of the learned Phisition, as also the reiteration of them (yea in the state of the sicknesse) if strength do serue and occasion require: but if the patient abhorreth this kinde of medicines, then let him vse the extractions of simple purgers, as of rubarb, agarike, or sene: of the which by orderly co~position, al humors may be purged, as we haue taught lib. de med· vegetab. spag. prepar. where also you shal finde the right and orderly preparation and dose of them.
V. Of the third generall intention curatiue, which is done by Chyrurgerie: and first of the manner of the first dressing.
VVE said in the beginning, that in wounds by shot, two Indications curatiue were to be considered, that is suppuration, and generation of new flesh, (which are sufficient, if we onely regard the contusion and brusing thereof, and not the venemous qualitie and burning, which may be ioyned the which two intentions, that we may orderly do, and so obtaine our pretendid purpose, there are eleuen indications to be considered of vs, which they call Subalterne, of the which one of them commandeth the shot to bee taken out, or small peeces of the coate of maile, or points of weapons sticking fast, and also peeces of their apparell, scales of bones, sharpe and pricking, clots, or any such other thing which may happen in the wounde, which must be taken out, (if it may be) without paine: and if any thing bee deepe in, it must bee wrought with your fingers or pincers, or toothed tenacles, made after the fashion of a Crowes bill, as you may see them pictured in sundery sorts, in the booke of Ambrosius Pareus, a most skilfull Chyrurgion.
And the shot must be taken out the same way it went in: placing the wounded person (as Hippocrates commandeth) in the same sort as he was in when he receiued the wounde, or at the least so placed and laide in his bedde, that so nigh as may be, he resemble the same.
And the shot is commonly taken out by that way, as vy force it was driuen in: because it hath made and prepared it selfe a way to come forth thereby: the which passage (if neede require) must be inlarged with a lancet or incision knife, that the bullet may follow the easier, and the lesse inflamation arise, if so be it be found by a searcer sticking in the flesh, and hath not pearced any great vaine, or sinewy place.
In which case we must vse a new incision, with more profite, if the flesh in the contrary part be verie thinne, and by feeling the shot is perceiued, and no manifest let, but incision may be made in the contrary side.
And of this the Chyrurgion ought alwayes to haue a speciall care (as saith Celsus, writing of drawing out things infixed in wounds) least that a sinew, great vaine, or artery bee hurted thereby: which if it be like to insue, or the shot be so hidde that it cannot be founde, it is better to let it stay till such time as nature it selfe shall expell it.
For what shall it preuaile, when the wound is great of it selfe, to make a newe, and in vaine to molest the patient with double paines: in so much as in diuers the shot hath beene so secret, that many yeares after ye wound hath bene healed, it hath fallen out of his owne accord, with a small impostume.
Moreouer this thing may be done by applying of drawing medicines, whose vse is dayly, especially if it be suspected the shot to be venemous, for in such case it must be had out with speede: wherefore (least the venime stricke vpward, and draw to the principall parts) we must presently vse the strongest drawers, as in other cases those not so forceable, of the which we shall haue occasion to speake, when we intreate of venemous woundes.
This first intention being done, that is, all things (as much as in vs lieth) taken out of the wound, next we will speake of such medicines as first are to be applied to the same: in which case we finde the iudgement of the Phisitions and Chyrurgions much to varie, some woulde haue a burning whot iron, or causticke, or any other eating medicine to be applied to euery wounde indifferently: others the oyle Oliue, or oyle of Elders to be powred on exceeding whot: some commende Treacle, others Turpentine, and some woulde haue the oile of whelpes, to be applied verie warme: but the common sort vse to take their matches, stupes, or tow, and dippe it in vineger, the white of an egge, and some astringent medicine, and therewith fill the whole wound: and binde and roole therein the parts about it: and that dressing they will not to bee remooued for the space of a whole day, as they say, for feare of bleeding.
But how euill this co~mon vse is, the skilfull may iudge: for these emplasticall medicines are of a thick and earthy substance, and astringent power, which suddainly are dried vp, and do the sore member too much, and cause great whereby comes great fluxes of humors, and inflamations, and other grieuous accidents, because they doo shut vp the pores and passages of the skinne, and do thicke~ and ingrosse the humors: euen as Lard, Rosine, Pitch, Waxe, Butter, and the substance of all things meltable, doth congeale with colde, and in feeling is harder: euen so are the humors thickened, and become hard to be discussed by the sinister application of these colde medicines: for the pores of the skinne being shut vp, the spirits by by are choked, by the staying of exhalation of euill humors, whereof many times comes Gangrena and mortification of the whole member.
But if meere necessitie, and want of other medicines, doth inforce the Chyrurgion to vse these common remedies to stop the great fluxe of blood (which in these wounds is seldome seene) yet (if they may) let them bee picked out or chaunged, or els often made moist with Oxirhodino warmed: neither is it to be forgotten that many now adayes, do vse to the cure of such wounds (not only at the first dressing, but vntill they be fully healed) onely running water warmed, and some put therevnto vinegar and oyle, and dippe therein their matches and towe, which so well falleth out, that diuers thinke that it is done by magicall incantations: the which thing by daily experience is prooued: neither is it against reason: for Celsus writeth that simple cold water is profitable for woundes: and in another place he saith, it is good how euer it be applied: yea warmed, for it easeth paine, expelleth inflamations, and putteth backe fluxes, the which accidents (by the consent of all men) in the very beginning are to be resisted.
Furthermore by the aduice of Hippoc. all contused wounds are to be cured by present supuration the which is done (as experience and all auncient writers haue taught) by fomentation of warme water.
If so bee then, water doth repel and driue backe the viole~tnes of such grieuous and great accidents which commonly come to wounds, why should then any man mauell, if the nature (wherein is contained the efficient cause and naturall balme which doth eonglutmate both broken bones, and wounded flesh) doth so incarnate wounds, and socicatrise them, (so be it that art giue attendance to nature, and dooth minister and serue thereunto, in taking heede that the wounde bee not by outwarde causes, and that the curatiue vertue of the Balme bee not let, but may doo his office) and in clensing the wound throughly from and all other thinges which may hinder the consolidation thereof.
And also must greatly commend their indeuour, which will, oyle and vinegar to be added thereunto, for with that remedie was that Uinsius cured, of whome we spake before, being wounded greeuously at the siege of Rochell: and not onely he, but diuers others: for these thinges being mixed, doe resist all kinde of accidentes, as paine, inflamation, fluxes, and also putrifaction: which last especially is to be preuented (because these kindes of woundes are verie much subiect thereunto) least Gangrena and Sphacelus follow after.
And it is manifest yt vineger withstandeth corruption, in that it preserueth thinges coit therein, from venoming and moulding: likewise oyle being powred vppon wine or anie other liquor, preserueth them from sowring, or dying, in that it keepeth away the ayre, and excludeth all fumes, which may cause putrifaction.
And so much the more allow the vse thereof, in that whether it be inwardly ministred or outwardly applyed, it suppresseth the power of venome, which may sometimes be ioyned with these woundes, as we haue taught, and that is the cause that allowe the iudgement of those which cause hote oyle presently to be applied, for it is verie wholesome, partly because, by relaxation it dissolueth the inward venome of euill humours, and partly in that it defendeth the hollownesse of the wound from the violence of the aire: which thing aboue the rest is to be heeded.
That the wound be not long open, but so soone as may be, it be couered, and that the aire is altogether subiect to putrifaction, it is manifest to those, whiche set anie kinde of pippins, and stoppe the same verie close with lut um sapientiae, as they tearme it, that no aire breake in, and bury it in a so these fruits being kept from the aire cannot rot or putrifie, but are taken out againe as freshe and sound as they were when they were put in, the which things haue spoken by the way to proue, that manie were cured by medicines and not by enchantmentes.
as the common people iudge, although that some vse them not with reason, it is agreeable to reason: yet would not haue anie man thinke that haue written this to defend the of the which sticke not to crie cunning on the verie bodie and life of man, and as the prouerbe saith, by breaking of a pot, to proue the potters craft, but iudge rather such to be rooted out, for through their ignorance rashnesse it comes to passe, yt Phisick (which otherwise is highly to be praysed) is conde~ned despised.
But that we digresse not far fro~ our purpose, to my iudgment it seemeth profitable, to poure into such made by shot, by by, the compound oyle of the Misselto of the Apple tree, or the oyle of the flowers of Mulleyn or of Hypericon, or of eggs, the making of which you shall finde in our Antidotare of gunshot, and such the Chyrurgion ought to haue in a readinesse: For they greatly preuaile, to mollifie and asswage paine, and are verie profitable to cure kindes of woundes, But when these are not at hand, you may vse the oyle of Elders (which is highly commended of Ioubertus an expert Phisition) or oyle of Lynseed, or of Eggs, or of wormes, or Lyles, or or of Turpentine, and in case anie man be destitue of all those, let him take warme butter or Turpentine, and annoynt the clothes or lynt with the oyntment following.
Take of Goates suet, of Colophonie of ech {ounce}. iii. of the marrow of the legges of Oxen and oesepi humidi of eche {ounce}. ii. ss. of freshe butter {ounce}. ii. of the iuice of Selondme and centuary, of ech {ounce}. i. of the oyle of Ware and of Misselto, of eche as much as suffiseth to make an oyntment, take of this oyntment {ounce}. iii. of Mercurie Precipitat sweetned, and prepared after our maner, and of Crocus Veneris right prepared, of ech {dram}. iii. and mixe them together, and annoynt therewith the Plegettes and Tents, if the vse of them be necessarie.
The powders ought to be prepared in a redinesse, the which the richer sorte may carie about them in a boxe, and if the foresayd oyntment be not at hand, you may verie well mixe them with freshe butter, and make thereof a broad plaister, that may couer the sides also of the wound, and the lint is to be wet with simple Oxirhodino, made with vineger, and the oyle of Roses and of Miselto, and the partes farre of, must bee defended with this oyntment following.
Take Bole Armoniack, sanguis Draconis, red corrall and {ounce} ss. croci martis {dram} ii. baccharum myrthi {dram} i. ss. oyle of Roses Omphacine {ounce}. iiii. vineger of Roses {ounce}. ii. waxe {ounce}. i. ss. so make thereof a lynament.
In the meane while this one thing is chiefly to be obserued in rowling of suche woundes, that the rowle be not so lose, that the medicines sagg from the wound, neyther it bee so hard, that it be grieuous, and so draw fluxes of humours, and sometime impostumation and at the last Gangrena and Canker, as Celsus (sometime) hath seene happen, we therefore must giue our indeuors, that in auoyding the discommodities of the one, we may reape the commodities of the other, and in the meane space let the linnen cloth be oft made moyst with Oxyrhodino, and the dressing renewed after xii. houres, except through the cutting of some great vaine or arterie we feare bleeding a fresh, The which if it chance to happen aboue measure, it must presently be seene to and staied, which may well be brought to passe by the applying and taking of these medicines following, but yet would not haue it staied, vntill such time as a reasonable quantitie of bloud is issued.
Take Crocus Martis finely reuerberated, Crocus Veneris, of eche {ounce}. ii. let them be tempered with the oyle of Uisci pomorum, and make thereof an oyntment, it is to be wondered at, to see ye strength of this medicine in stopping bloud, and doth moreouer reduce the wound to a better state, digest the superfluous humors, strengthneth the member and greatly withstandeth putrifaction.

Aboue all there cannot be found a worthier remedie, both to stop bloud, and case all paines, and suppresse fluxes of humours, then Laudanum Opiaticum· if you minister a pill thereof as bigge as a Pepper come, the vse wherof: (especially in these kind of wounds) cannot to highly be commended, that haue more plenteously intreated of in my answer to treatise of Aubertus vindonis do ortu causis Metal.
After these thinges being first done, then apply medicins, which quickly may suppurate, and being come to maturation, let it be mundified, with exiccation, that naturall fleshe may growe, that is, it be neither ouer hard, or soft, or proud, and the scales of the bones, if there be anie, may come out from the sound bone.
Moreouer we hasten the suppuration of these wounds, least the venome closed within· and filthy saines, doe some greater hurt for being throughly ripened, feuers, paines and almost al other passions will decay.
For this intention, the common sorte are woont to vse, at the second dressing, digestiues as they tearme them, made of the yeolke of an egge, oyle of Roses and Turpentine, which (as may say the trueth) cannot allow in that they soone putrifie and cause the wound to smell, whiche thing is alwaies ill, Others vse hydreleon warmed with butter, and other thinges which haue nature to suppurate, and some boyle the flower of wheate with a litle safron: some againe there be which greatly commend Tetrapharmacon made of pitche, rosin, waxe, and suit: and Cor. Celsus esteemeth this aboue all others, Also Macedonioum is made with the forenamed simples and frankencense, and much commended of some, Other greatly allowe Basilicon, for it is a great suppuratiue, and also readie at the Pothicaries, and some commend Dialthea, which they call Resumtiuum.
Others Emplas. dia Chilo, simplex, and de mucilaginibus, which they temper with oyle of lylies.
And with all these and other like medicines, they out of hand, doe suppur at the bruised flesh, following the preceptes of
For he writeth, that it is expedient that the brused flesh, be supurated, and by such meanes is the wound lesse subiect to impostumation and anguish, and this is the iudgement of Hippoerates, and all other antient Phisitions, and my selfe cannot, but highly commend the vse of the supuratiues, for they doe defend the nature and strength of naturall heate, and do temperate the rage of rotten humours, and verie quickly doe bring the corrupted bloud to matter, and thereby doe bring the wound in a farre better estate, But yet this one thing must be taken heede to, that the vnorderly vse of them cause not the wound to rot, which is remedied by putting to euerie ounce of the suppuratiue, one dram of precipitate prepared after our order, yea and more to, if the wound shall smell, and so shall the medicine pearce farther, and worke his without danger, and by this onely meanes, you shall haue white matter, and the affected member shalbe from and putrifaction, whereunto (in kinde of woundes) they are much subiect, and this haue oftentimes proued, by sure experience.
Neyther haue thought it amisse (in the behalfe of the vnpractised chyrurgions) to set downe some ensamples for this intention, would therefore that the tents, Plegetes, and whatsoeuer is put in the hollownesse of the wound, be dipped in this oyntment following, which is easie to be made.

Take of that ointment {ounce} ii. of our Precipitate {dram} ii. mixe them, and so shalt thou haue a most excellent remedie, which being vsed in emplasters without Precipitate, is to bee annointed and put into the wound.
Take venice turpentine and white hony, of ech halfe a pounde, the yelkes of twelue eggs, and mixe them very well, and boile them to the thicknesse of a pultise.
This ointment (which the Paracelsians call Galcinatum magnum) you may safely vse in sreede of a digestiue: for being so prepared, it resisteth putrifaction, and is very good to bring such wounds to suppuration.
But in so much as it is the office of naturall heate to maturate, and not of medicines, we must therefore by all meanes possible, increase such heate as is likest thereunto, which is to be increased and nourished by wraping the member in bombase, lana succida, and linnen clothes, or else with some Cataplasme, by all which meanes (as Celsus writeth) daungerous wounds are cured: and such things must be dipped in Hydraelion made of oyle of and wherunto you may put a little vineger, but not too much in that it hindereth suppuration, or else vse this fomentation following, which my selfe do often vse.

This medicine neuer failed me, for it driueth away inflamation, greatly easeth paine, and strenthning the substance of the member, it very quickly moueth good matter: and of the foresaide substance pounded, and driuen through a seeue, is made a cataplasme by putting thereunto the meale of Lineseed Fenugreke ana {ounce} ii. humidae, and marrow of cales ana {ounce} i. ss. the yelkes of foure eggs, of saffro~ sixe graines, oile of Viscipomorum and rosarum as much as sufficeth: let it be applied to the wound and parts nigh vnto it, but round about it somewhat farther off: let this ointment following be vsed to withstand the flux of humors.

And such medicines so long you must vse (as we saide before) dressing it twise a day, vntill the wound come to good matter, and then must you vse clensing medicines, wherwith you may always our Precipitate in greater dose, which brauely clenseth wou~ds from matter, and also resisteth corruption.

Take massae emp. Diachalciteos {ounce} vi. olei visci pomorum q. ss. and make thereof a and apply it to the wound.
But insomuch as for the most part, such wounds are so deepe, that neither ointmen nor tents can reach them, it were very good to vse this iniection following, which serueth for common souldiers.
Take Peruincle, Petum, Persicarie, Betonie, of ech one handfull, flowers of saint Iohns wort, and Uerbasci ana. i. the roots of both Astrologies, of ech {ounce}. ss. Francomsence, Mirrhe, Sarcacoll and Ireos, of ech {dram} ii. boile them in white wine, and wash the wound therewith at euery dressing, but beware you leaue not ought thereof in the wound, for it sufficeth if the wound be washed therewith.
Take Fluelline, Peruincle, Betony, Agrimony, and greater Cumphery, of ech m. i. the rootes of round Astrology and Ireos, of ech {ounce} i. boile them in the fleme of Vitriole.
Take of this decoction strained halfe a pint, and dissolue therein the chymicall Oiles of Myrrh and masticke ana {dram} iii. Oile of Turpentine one dram, mixe them and vse them as aforesaid.
The wounde being throughly clensed, it must be incarnated, which is soone done by making lesse and lesse the tentes dayly, for by that meanes onely is the wounde filled with flesh without any medicine, by the strength of and then after is easily cicatrised, so be it we augment the quantitie of our Precipitate in the ointments, or else vse the medicine following.
Take lyme of eggshels well ralcyned {ounce} ss. Boraxe, and burnt Alome, of ech {dram} i. crocus Martis {ounce} i. make thereof a powder, which is excellent to cicatrise.
Moreouer, if the wound cannot be brought to suppuration by the foresaid medicines, but beginneth to growe to Gangrena and mortification of the member, which may be seene by the wanne, yelow, leady, and blacke collour of the same: then you must applie such medicines as haue vertue to withstand such corruption and mortification, whose discriptions you shall find in the Chap. of Gangrena, and also we must withstand all euill accidentes if any come: as pain, impostumation, and such like, as hereafter be declared.
Nowe it resteth to intreat of such wounds by shot, as are accompanied with venome and burning.
HAuing set downe the curation of those woundes, in which the solution of co~tinuity wt brusing, and tearing of the parts, was onely to be waide.
It remaineth nowe to intreate of venome and burning, which two, we haue prooued to happen oftentimes to such wounds.
For venome therefore which must haue recourse to a third intention, that is to some holesome medicine (named of the greekes Alexipharmacon) whereby, out of hande it may bee drawne out of the wound, and the strength thereof delayed, least by little and little creeping in, it commeth to tbe principall parts, and so altereth their substance and hindereth their operation: and this is to be done with medicines, partly apylied outwardly to ye wound and heart, and partly inwardly by the mouth ministred.
For if the flesh about the wound be more wanner then it is wont to be in common wounds, and as it were deade, with palenesse of the whole member, with pricking of the sides, and extraordinarie inflamations and paine, with debilitie of the whole bodie, alienation of the mind, and burning feuers.
And these accidents come without any manifest cause, it plainely declareth the wound to be venomed: and then (all other intentions said aside·) presently wee must prouide to withstand that, for euen as the skilful shipmaister seeing a terrible tempest arising, with blustering windes, doth presently euen against both streame and winde (considering his safegard) with sayle and oare, seeke to finde some safe porte and place to stay in: Euen so the Phisitian harnised with reason, vse, and experience, ought out of hand to applie some healthull medicine to this present incommoditie, to boate downe presently (if it may be) the malice thereof, and that before it taketh roote and hold in the wound, and doth possesse the principall partes and heart, to which place it maketh great speede, and in this case present incision often fayleth, and that which is done too late neuer helpeth.
Therfore if we iudge by the foresaid signes and such like that the wound is poysoned, we must straight haue recourse to some present remedie, but first a sound iudgement taken, with perfect prognostication (as Celsus willeth) giuen to the friendes of the patient, whether he be eyther past helpe, or in great danger, or like to recouer, least that arte being ouercome with the euill, it be attributed to our ignorance and deceite, to the great discredite of the arte, after this, a conuenient order of dyet prescribed, which resisteth venome, wee must straight haue respect whether the griefe doth require eyther bloudletting or purgation, which are to be done speedily: with good aduisement, whether the euacuation must bee done first and foremost, or else with sweate, vomite, laske, and phlebotomy, that the euill humors may be purged· before they be spred in the vaynes, and taken holde in the arteries, or els the pores (by sweate) being opened, these euill and noysome vapors, wherewith the heart is oppressed, may come forth and vanish, which is to be done, especially if the poyson first be spred through the body, and the patient filled with ill humors, and then also Paulus counselleth, that euacuation be made by phlebotomye as is to be seene in his
After this minister such thinges as defend and comfort the heart, as Treacle and Methridate, in wine, or decoction of the roots of Angelica, Turmentill, Gentian, Bistort, Citron seedes, Sorrell, hear be baulme, fluelline and pympinell, with the sirope of lemons, or any other infusion: and that, as the nature of the partie requireth, and shal seeme good to the expert Phisition, and in that case it behoueh him to be wise and warie, and not misse.
Moreouer haue thought it good to set downe a receite easie to be made, for their sakes, which are to come, which being ministred, expelleth all venome, as by dayly proofe it hath bene tried: and take it for a singuler secret, although it be familiar.
most excellent medicine agaynst poyson, and by oft ttiall proued.
Take the rotes asclepiadis {ounce} i. the rotes of Ualerian and Turmentill of eche {ounce} ss. polipodie rotes {ounce} ii. garden Augelica {ounce} iiii. wild Angelica and holihock roots ana {ounce} ii. nettels {ounce} i. rotes of Thimelea {ounce} i· ss. roots of scabious and lesser valerian ana {ounce} ss. let all the roots be gathered betweene the

houres. after seeth them for the space of an houre and a halfe, and powring out the vineger, let them be dried and made in a powder, and put thereto twelue berries of herbe Paris, and sixe and thirtie leaues of the same and make of them a powder, whose dost is {dram} i. in white wine.
Take Methridate and treacle of each {dram} ss, pearles prepared, and red corall and {scruple} i. bole armenye {dram} ss. sirope of lemons {ounce} i. buglosse and Scabions water as much as suffiseth, and make thereof a potion, and let it be renewed once or twise if neede require.

It is verie good also to vse tomentations to the region of the heart made of pearles, saunders, corrall, camphere, and other cordials.
Med. iudgeth two intentions curatiue to be required in those venomous woundes, the one to draw forth the poyson, the other to alter the paine comming thereof, The first intention is performed, with thinges heating and drawing, as boxing, frications, cauterizatio~s made with hot iron or medicines: The other is done by such medicines, which did, or can alter the qualitie by a contrarie qualitie, as to vse refrigeratiues, if great heat the patie it, calefartiues, if cold be felt in the wound, or in all the body, And in the meane spaee the antient Phisitions councelled to put in the wound, salt, onyons, rue, mustardseede, wallnuts, dittany, brimstone, nuttes, and such like medicines hauing great force to drawe, They vsed allbindinges and sacrifications with lancet whereby the more quantitie of corrupted bloud might issue, of which thinges Paul.
Aetius, Actuarius, and Cornelius Celsus, excellent Phisitions and worthie of eternall commendations, haue worthily written.
Notwithstanding because they had neyther ye knowledge of wounds made by gunshot, neyther of any excellent medicine, neyther yet perhaps of the poyson, wherewith the shot may be poisoned, haue thought it meete to bring to light most profitable medicines, they not comon, to cure suche wounds as are ye vse of which the thankfull posteritie cannot sufficiently commend, Therefore at the very first dressing, (if by the aforesayd signes, it is manifest the wound to be poysoned) draw out if you may all thinges infixed and scarifie the lippes of the wound, and set boxing glasses thereto, and annoynt the tentes to be put in the wound with this vnguent following.
Take Ung. Macedonici {ounce} ii. oyle of Mirrh and Turpentine, ana {dram} ii. our precipitate {dram} i. ss. butter of Arsnicke fixed and as the manner is {ounce} ss. oyle of Antimonie {dram} ii. a little waxe, and make thereof an oyntment.
There cannot a more better medicine be found to drawe out and clense anie poyson in woundes, wherefore the Chyrurgions ought alwaies to haue it made in a readinesse, whose force when they haue proued in these woundes, and all maligne vlcers, as Carcinomata Gangrena, and other desperate sores, so much the more will they commend it, for it worketh without anie paine.
Take olei mercur, corporalis {dram} i. ss. olei sulphuris therebi. {dram} iii. arsenici dulcificati {dram} ii, and with a little fresh butter, make thereof an vnguent, and applie it to the wound, as it is said, with tentes and plegettes, for it cureth all venomous woundes, and Gangrena, Caner, eating and naughtie and about the compasse of the wound let this plaster be applyed.
Take Ammoniaci, bdellii, dissolued in vineger of Roses, ana. {ounce} ii. Galbani {ounce} ss. mumiae thuris, Mastick ana {dram} iii. Camphere {dram} ii. white red corall, Magnes prepared, asphalti, amber, ana {ounce} ss. rad. aristolochiae, serpentariae. et arundinis. ana. {dram} ii. ss wax,

Take gummi corticis med. tiliae drawne as heereafter shall be taught {ounce} ii. magnetis praep. {ounce} i. succini flaui praep. {ounce} ss. opoponaxe purged with the iuice of Serpentariaz iii.
Turpentine and waxe, as much as suffiseth to make an emplaster.
The tong of a foxe cut off in a conuenient time, and prepared and dried as it ought, draweth out the shot, yea from the inward partes, without paine if first it be moystened in red wine, wherein serpentarie and aristolochia hath bene boyled, and so applyed to the wound, also this defensiue following layd round about the member, is of great force.
Take of the flowers of Mullen, hipericon, and roses ana p. ii. the leaues of rue and henvane ana m. i. Camphire, {ounce} ss. boyle them in vineger, and make thereof a Cataplasme, that asswageth paine and keepeth the part from impostumation.
These medicines to be changed twise a day, and must be vsed, vntill all grieuous passions shall seeme to be gone: and then the wound must be vsed as if it were bursed: and that may be done with prolonging of tune, that the venomous matter may ruime out and not creepe inward, And when such time is come that we iudge the venome to be drawn out quite, you may incarnate and cicatrize the wound as we haue said before, but if the wound be so infected with poyson, that it seemeth to bring great danger of death, and is deadly indeede, and nothing amendeth by applying of medicines, it shall not be amisse (the danger before declared) to cut of the member, if it be such as may be cut off: let this suffise concerning venomous woundes.
Now going about to intreat of burning, which oftentimes happeneth to woundes by shot, cannot sufficiently discommend the iudgement of those which will that colde thinges and such as haue great poer to keepe backe, are in this case straight to be applied, for such keepe in and driue backe, and not draw out the fire, and doth driue it more into the parts, and increase the griefe: and especially vineger, which they commonly vse, for with his astringent vertue, it stoppeth the pores, and keepeth backe the fiuxe of blood, as Aetius writeth.
For rather brine or dooth presently draw on the burning and fire of such wounds, and doo aswage the great paine, and keepe backe blisters, if the burned part be presently couered with a fine cloth wette in salt water.
But Oribasius and Paulus haue thought good that burnings were to bee cured with clensing medicines, and therefore they haue commended terram Chiam, Cimoliam, and Creticam, and all other light earth being tempered with vineger, being not sharpe.
The late writers commend an vnguent made of lime seuen times washed and tempered with oile of Roses, and applied to the griefe.
Other haue recourse to Walwort boiled in wine and made as a Cataplasine, and to all such medicines which by heate may draw out the burning from the slesh: and by this reason the fire it selfe, if the part burned bee holden thereunto, becomes aremedie to cure his owne hurts, for in opening the pores, it draweth out hte fire and ceaseth paine: but wehaue oftentimes to our great profite, vsed these medicines following.
Anvnguent for common souldiers, to quench the burning, and keepe backe blisters.
Take oile of elders and of nuts ana. {ounce} ii. oile of egges {ounce}. ss. harts tallow, and marrow of a bull ana {ounce} i. two Onions rosted, a little Waxe, make of these an vnguent and lay it to the part affected.
Take of oile of lard, and oile of butter ana {ounce} ss. the iuice of the berries and leaues of Iuie {ounce} ii. the iuice of the middle rinde of Elders {ounce} i. oyle of elders, {ounce} iiii. salt peter, zii. boile them altogither till the water be consumed, and with a little waxe make thereof alinament, which is of great force to take away burnings.
Also this water following is most excellent for the same purpose.
Take of the fieame of vitriol and allome ana lb. ss. the flowers of tapsus barbatus, leaues of blacke Iuie ana m. i. frogges, and crafishes ana numerox. distil them in a leaden limbeck, with somewhat a strong fice, and wash the burned place with this water, fiue or sixe times a day.
Likewise the water of sperma ranarum, mixed with the fieame of vitrioll is very good, but there cannot be found a more excellent remedy to quench the burning heate of pouder the~ this lynament following, for it putteth away all inflamations, and and the rich may vse it.
Take salis saturni saccharini {ounce} i. oyle of yolkes of egges {ounce} ii. prepared {ounce} iiii. mixe them and make alynament, wherewith annoint the bin ned place, thrise or foure times a day: and lay this defensiue following to the parts about it, to withstand the fluxe of homors and inflamation.
Take of the iuice of henbane, housleeke, and water lilies, of ech {ounce} ii. water of the sperm of frogges and flowers of Mullein ana {ounce} i. Wharge, or his salt, which is better {ounce} ii. of visci pomorum and ana {ounce} ii. ss. vineger of Roses {ounce} i. te~per them long in a leaden morter with a pestill of the same, and make it in forme of Nutriti, and vse it for a defensiue.
These are the locall medicines which are necessary for such burned woundes: but in so much as these inconueniences are wont to happen to bodies being sicke and filled with euill iuice, and weake of strength, which are subiect to all mishaps, as to great paine and inflamation, whereof feuers may grow, and so death follow.
(For so old patched and rotten shippes doo soonest giue vp in a tempest.)
In which case wee must haue a care that a good order of diet bee kept, and also if neede require, purgation and all which things are to be committed to the iudgement of the skilfull and wise Phisition, who may prudently presage what will be the ende of the griefe, not to neglect that which is great, neither to make that great which is little, least it should seeme that he hath done more then neede: and this thing (according to Celsus minde) must alwayes be looked to, least that griefe which is of it selfe being small, be made great by the of the Phisition.
perticular curation of these wounds and also of the accidents happening thereunto.
THe curation of such wounds is commonly iudged more difficult, if so bee it bee ioyned with fracture of the bones, and that not without great cause, especially if the greater bone, as of the leggs and armes, bee so broken that the marrowe goeth out, which cannot be without great perishing of the sinewes, vaines, Arteries, the which bring life, feeling and mouing to euery part, and that being kept back, the member must needs perish, commonly death ensueth.
Whereunto the Phisition or Chyrurgion ought so much the more to looke by, how much the more the number greatnes of accidents shall increase, that he may let nothing passe which doth pertain to the perfite therof.
And it is better to attempt that with excelle~t medicines, the~ by vtter desparation by a heauy sorrowfull meanes cut off the member, and especially in the beginning, when as yet Sphacelus, is not growen: and that haue not spoken this without a cause, the workes and myracles of nature may teach vs, the which she oftentimes brings to passe (being furthered with meete medicines) and deceiueth the iudgement, yea of the learned, the which with these eyes haue oftentimes seene to haue happened in the tentes, at this last warres and among all the rest, a certaine noble man named Brosseus, whose arme was so torne by a great shot, that it missed but litle of breaking of head, which is fastened on the bones, named Omoplat, which was the onely cause why the Chyrurgions did not cut it off: but they meant shortly to doo it for feare of Sphacelus: but it fell out that the pacient recouered, whom they iudged past helpe, in that the wound was accompanied with such euill and sundry accidents, yea and his arme saued, that he is able to doe any thing with it.
haue thought it good to set out this ensample to the younger Chyrurgions, that thereby they may indeuour themselues by all meanes rather to preserue the hurted member, then to beginne their curation by taking it off, which ought not to be done, before it is plainly perceiued the member to be come to mortification, and then let it be done by due warning and prediction: some wil obiect, that in the beginning the strength of the to be of more force, also to ser better the taking off, the which by the greatnesse of the griefe dacayeth: and therefore it is to be done by and by, which is as it were to set that present before his eyes, which is not yet, and is also vncertaine whether it will bee or no.
Moreouer it is better first to die that kinde of curation which is of credite and profite, then to attempt a taking heed of other hanious griefes not yet come: neither may we thinke that nature is so weake, but she is able to performe that which seemeth impossible, being holpen in time, oftentimes deceiue our expectation and iudgement: as in the ensample before we haue declared.
But in case the member must needs be taken away, it is better to be done by a generall consent of the learned, then by the rash iudgement of the vnskilfull, which oftentimes will boldly enterprise the same.
The cause why (intreating of these woundes, which happen without breaking and brusing of the bones) take my beginning of these which happen to the head, as the most waightiest and dangerous: by reason of the worthinesse of the braine inclosed therein.
And also because there can no bands rowlers they say to be very necessary in all fractures) bee applied thereunto, which bands were inuented to repell, to aswage impostumation, to auoide quitture, and to take away all hurtfull things sticking in the wound without which meanes, thinketh Meth. vi. cap. vi. no bone broken may bee vnited: whereby it comes to passe, that Cranion being fractured, it is necessarie to open the scull, which commonly we call trapaning, that thereby we may clense and make a passage for the matter, which otherwise might corrupt the and so the braine it selfe.
And that we may intreate orderly hereof, and our meaning the better vnderstood, let vs imagine to be set before vs, some one wounded in the heade by shot: and the first thing to bee considered shalbe this, whether the wound bee manifest or secret, shewing it selfe onely by brusing, which may come to passe, if so be the helmet be so strong, that the shot is not able to pearce him, but onely bendeth it, and so bruseth Cranion and breaketh it without opening of the skinne.
This happening, the wound must be launced crossewise, and to the incision, let some assringent medicine be applied with lint or towe, made of sang drac. mastic. and bole Armeny mixed with the white of an egge, and so in the day following, the wound will be greater, and so may yee iudge better of the fracture, which doth happen after sundry sorces, for some whiles one part, and otherwhiles both partes of the table are perished, sometimes the fissure is to be seene, and then with the Grecians it is named [undefined span alphabet] otherwhiles it is verie narrowe and not to be seene. which the Latines call Pilosa, the Gretians [undefined span alphabet] the which againe doe pearse both partes of the table, or one which is not so dangerous: Therefore, the fracture being manifest, the wound being sufficientie delated eyther by shot or incisiion, so soone as may let it be taken in hand: first of all let all things bee taken out which are contused and torne, and whatsoeuer oppresseth the panicles, but if there bee any great fragment, which oftentimes chanceth, you may not too pursue it, as Galen in his sixt Meth. med. ca.
It shalbe sufficient if the bone bee so much opened that the matter may auoid thereby.
These are to be considered when the incision or fracture is manifest: but as concerning such woundes, as haue onely a simple fissure, such require a skilfull and expert Chyrurgion to discerne them: for oftentimes it is not to be perceiued by sight nor handling.
The ancient in this case, (that is when the fracture is pilosa or Capillaris) did vse a certaine blacke medicine, which leauing behinde it a blacke scarre in the bone, did shewe the fracture to bee there.
To this purpose may bee vsed inke wherewith wee write, tempered with masticke, or else coles with mell Rosate, or else (which is better) tartar calcinid till it be blacke, which also of his owne accorde easily resolueth: but the later writers doo iudge of the fracture, by applying of astringent medicines, for in what place, and where it is soonest dryed (which comes of hot vapours percing through the fracture,) there it is shewed to be, which being found out, we must presently search by proper signes and tokens, whether the fissure dooth passe both the tables, or else but one: for if it be but in the vppermost table only, it sufficeth to scarifie the bone where the fracture is with a razore (which the greekes call [undefined span alphabet]) or any other fit instrument, as farre as the fracture extendeth, that the bone be made equall, and after proceede to the residue of the curation, applying medicines meete for wounds contused, of which we haue already intreated in the first booke.
Moreouer you must take great heede in all wounds of the head that they take no moisture, as Hipoc. witnesseth de vuln cap.
But contrariwise, let such things as dry and comfort the head be applied either drie or in powder, or mixed with mell rosate.
Such as comfort the head are these: the roots of both Aristolochies, franke~sence, myrrh, ireos, panax, farina, orobi, and other such like: also mercurie precipitate is very good, mixed with mel rosat, ruineth the superfluitie of bones: but if the rising perce through, then must it bee trapined before the third day, or by some other meanes an issue made, (as Hippocrates saith) which must be so ample, that inflamation be staide, and a passage for the matter made, so that throughly it may be taken away and clensed, which must be done circumspectly, and with fit and meete instruments, which are liuely set out by Ambrosius Pareus in the Chapter of woundes of the heade.
And this handie worke being ended, wee must diligently marke when the broken bone doth waxe lose, for then it is to be taken out, so be it sticketh not fast to the panicle, which if it doth, it must not bee medled with, least thereby you hurt the panicle or hinder it by letting in of the aire: but you must stay till such time as the bone fall away of his owne accord, but if the bone be quite separated from the skinne, which oftentimes happeneth in such wounds, through the great force of the shotte: and there is also inflamations, and other davngerous accidents which commonly accompany these wounds.
Then it must presently be opened, yea before it doe rot, if so the Chyrurgion be come in time, which ought to bee both diligent and skilfull, and hath a perfite knowledge of all such places as may be trapaned, in that ye seams of Crainon, are not to be medled with, but if the wound chance to happen there, then it must be trapaned on both sides, not touching the seames, and it must be done in that part which shall seeme most conuenient, to auoide the corruption.
Moreouer you must beware that you trapan not the brows or lower parts of the braine, least thereby (the way being made open) the braine by reason of his heauinesse issue out, neither yet about the temples, because of the muscle, and vitall instruments which are there: which thing Galen hath obserued li.
meth. with these wordes: Cogitaui preterea accidere posse, vt si a latere magnum fierit in ossibus foramen, promineret fortassis hac parte cerebrum.
Est porro in lateribus non vno in neruorum, horumque non leuis momenti quidem exortus.
His admonitus abstinui ab eximendo osse, quod in latere capitis esset.
But in vppermost part of the braine, he saith there commeth not out any nerue: whereby we may learne that in that place, we may trapan with lesse daunger.
The wound being inlarged, the Chyrurgions doo commonly apply santalum as they terine it, which is a peece of red cut according to the bignesse of the orofice, which some apply warme, dipped onely in oile of Roses: but other mixed therewith mel rosarum and some vse onely hony of roses, doubting least that through the moistnesse of the oile, the panicle would corrupt.
Others thrust in tentes and linte to fill therby the hollownes of the whole wound: and some vse their degestiues as they terme them, of which we haue spoken off before, some againe prefer Maced. and Basilicon, and some there bee which vse a cerote made of the emplaster of betony dissolued with oile of Roses in forme of an vnguent.
But according to the minde of Hippoc. so soone as the panicle of the head is vncouered by taking away Cranion: it ought straight to be clensed and dryed, least through the prolonging of time it swel corrupt.
Now after feare of impostumation aboue is past, they applie such things as mundifie incarnate, that thereby the wound at last may come to cicatrization, which is brought to passe (as we said before) by such medicines as drie and comfort the head.
Moreouer it shal not be amisse, to set downe some descriptions of such medicines which are profitable in wounds of ye heade with fracture of Cranion, and first we will set downe such as must at the first dressing bee applied to the panicles detected where Cranion is taken away.
Take Mel rosat {ounce} ii. oile of yolkes of egges {ounce} i. mixe them, and dippe therein a peece of silke, or lint, and lay it warme to the place, but take this following if you desire to haue an easie and speedie medicine.
Take mel rosat {ounce} ii. olei rosat {ounce} i. turpentine washed {ounce} ss. mixe them and dippe the tents or silke therein.
But at the third or fourth dressing you must not vse oile of roses or of egges, but mel rosat, mixed with a iust quantity of oile of Hipericon, and whe~ the seuenth or eight day is past, vse these medicines following.
Take Mellis rosat. {ounce} ii. turpentine {dram} i. aqua vitae, gut. x. them togither and warme them, and dippe therein your santalum or fine lint, and apply it hot to the place, let a chafingdish of what coles be by, least the cold aire hinder it by percing in.
Another for the same purpose, to be vsed of the rich.
Take mel rosat {ounce} ii. oile of myrrhe, made according to our description {dram} ss. oile of turpe~tine distilled with aqua vitae by Balueo. {dram} i. mixe and vse them as aforesaid, so there be no impostumation, for this medicine is excellent to preserue the panicle from putrifaction and also profitable in all fractures of Cranion.
You may also vse in the beginning vnguentum Magistrale, descrived by vs before, which you may apply about the bone, and fill also the hollownes of the wounde with lint dipped therein, and so couer it al with a plaister of the same, also Calcinatum mag. Paracelsu is very good for the same purpose, and in the meane while, to clense the wound vse this following.
Take myrrh, sacacol, Ireos, ana {dram} ii. mumia {dram} i. ss. both astrologies ana {dram} i. farina orobi {dram} ii. ss. mel rosat. and turpentine washed in the water of betony, ana q. ss.
Take vngent de peto of our description {ounce} iii. oile of myrrh {dram} iii. oile of amber distilled by discention, and corrected as shalbe taught {dram} ii. the powder of the rootes of astristolochie {dram} i. mixe them, vse it as aforesaid.
But after that the panycle shall seeme to be couered, then you may vse medicines which drie more.
And so you may adde to one ounce of the foresaid ointment one {dram}. of our precipitate dulcorated, for thereby not onely the scales of the bones fall more easier away, but also hiposarcosis or proud flesh is kept backe, and this medicine may be vsed vntil it be perfitly whole and cicatrised, foreseen alwayes that it be couered with Empl. de betoni, or gratia dei, or diadictaum not described of Galen, or this following.
Take the iuice of Peeuincle, Sclandine and Comfory, ana. {ounce} i. Mummye, Myrrhe, Srarcocolle, Ireos, ana {dram} i. the roots of round astristolochie {ounce} ss. powder of yellow amber {dram} ii. ss. Turpe~tine hony ana {ounce}. iii. Croci marti {ounce} iii, wax, q. s. to make a playster.
And to asswage inflamation, it is verie good a day or two, in the beginning, to annoynt the partes about the wound with the oyle of roses, and to applie rowles and bowlsters, as fit and easie as may be, and as much as is possible to shunne the colde ayre: for there is nothing more hurtfull to such woundes.
Let a slender dyet bee prescribed, wherein he must abstaine from wine, all such kind of meates, as send fumes and vapors to the head: you must not forget also to purge, aswell by phlebotomy, as also if neede require by seege, And alwaies haue in memorie the sentence of Hippocrates, which saith, that no wound of the head, is to be lightly regarded, yea if the skinne be but onely rased because of the great accidentes and passions which commonly happen thereunto, and therefore you must prognosticate, with great heede taken, thereby to auoyd all rebukes, whereunto commonly those which exercise Phisicke are subiect.
Therefore the woundes which happen in the seames of Cranion are very dangerous, and the more if they bee in the forepart of the head and temples, or in the sides thereof, but not so ill, if in the hinder part, as Hippocrates doth witnesse, and the more the bones are broken, so much it is more dangerous, and especially if they hurt dura or pia matter, for wounds by shot are made by such violence, that they not onely burst that they hit, but also the ioyning thereunto, and so pull together the partes farther distant that oftentimes it benu~meth the partie bring hym in case as he were dead, which is alwaies a very euill all which signes are diligently to be noted that thereby you may know the better to minister medicins, and to giue a more certain warning to the friends of the patient, those which haue receiued deadly woundes, eyther dye by and by or els liue a verie little while, euen as the wound shall be greater or possesse a dangerous place, and sometimes, those which are lesse hurt (yea deadly) if a feuer take them, die in the
These are signes of death nigh at hand, wannesse of collour of the wound, the matter is little and stincking, the bone is blacke, pustels appeare on the toong, rednesse of the eyes, and other some, which may be gathered out of the booke of Hippoc. de vul. cap. and· also frensinesse and crampes comes a little before death.
Of wounds in the face with a fracture of the bones.
TO all other bones of the head being broken, as that whiche is called Basilare, or both the iaw bones, they commonly vse not any other remedy, but a conuentent binding vp of the wound, wt applying of suche medicines as are vsed to broken and bruised bones.
Therefore euen at the first dressing all thinges must be taken out, which are therein, whether it be shotte or any peece of bone lose, which may easily be taken out, otherwise stay till such tyme as nature expell it of her owne accord, eyther by that place where the shot went in, or where it came foorth, the whiche may be furthered by the Chyrurgion by remedies described of vs, in the former booke.
But if it chance that the orifice of the wound bee not large inough to take out thinges therein infixed, as broken bones: Let it page duplicate] page duplicate] be inlarged with sponges prepared, and if need require with an in+strument: Moreouer thinke it good to make mention of the deformities which are woont to remaine after such wounds, whereof greatheede is to be taken, and especially of suche as happen in the face, for it disfigureth greatly the man, is muche seene in that the face is neuer couered.
If a wound therefore be taken so nigh that the beard and skinne are burnt: you must haue recourse to such medicines which helpe burning, whereof mention is made before: but aboue all the rest, this following is of great force, for it keepeth backe blisters, and causeth heare to growe, as learned of a man of no small calling, who affirmed to haue proued it oftentimes.
An excellent medicine, easie to be made, which is called in Greeke [undefined span alphabet], Take the iuice of Leekes rosted in the embers and strayned, wherewith annoynt three or foure times a daie the place burned and bald.
Take of the iuice of Leeks, rosted onions, ana {ounce} ii. aqud. sperranarum {ounce} i. olei visc. pomo. populei, white waxe, ana q. s. to make a linament, wherewith twise a day annoynt the burned part, and if it happen that any cornes of the powder sticke in the skinne, as oftentimes it doth, first as nigh as may be, they must bee picked out with the poynt of a great nèedle, or anie other fit instrument, and then applie this lynament following.
Cast butter being melted, into the water of sperma ranar. or els in aqua gamarorum prepared according to our order, and doe that ten or more times, vntill the butter be as white as milke, of that so prepared: take {ounce} iii. and mixe it with {ounce} i. of oyle of the yeolkes of egges made after our discription, and make thereof a lynament, and annoynt the place, where the powder sticketh, it is a singular remedie for that purpose, and also to take away the burning.
Another most excellent for the same purpose to be vsed of the riche.
Take olei lithar {ounce} ss. aqua ex gammaris extractae {dram} ii. saturni {dram} i. water of water lilies, {dram} ii. of the foresaid butter q. s. and thereof make a lynament, and after the burning, let the face be annoynted three or foure times a day with this following.
Take vnguentum citr. {ounce} ii. spermat. ceti, {dram} i. oyle of Roses, and of Lilies ana {ounce} ss. mixe them.
Take vnguent. pomatae. {ounce} ii. Mucilag. sem psyllij extracted with Rosewater {ounce} i. caphurae {scruple} i. oyle of sweere Almonds {ounce} ss. mixe them, and to take away the cicatrizes, and red scarres, vse this medicine following.

But if it chance, through taking of a bone out, the lips of the wound do wrinckle wexe hard, wherby cicatrization is hindered, then you may repayre to that, which meane singularly to intreate of, and let this suffiee concerning woundes of the head, which are ioyned with fractures.
Of woundes in which the bones of the armes, and legges are broken.
Such woundes wherewith the bones are broken, and doth often happen to the armes, thighes, partly because they are of such greatnesse, that they oftentimes meete the shot, and partly because these partes are commonly vnharnessed, whensoeuer therefore any patient shalbe brought to vs wounded in such sorte, we must straight wayes search and seeke with our fingers or instrumentes, how the bone is broken, and especially then, when the wound is in the shoulder or hipbone, because that a fracture in these places, is very dangerous, for through extention, it hurteth the muskles and sinewes, which bringeth great inflamations, with grieuous paynes and crampes, and other dangerous accidentes, through which death oftentimes insueth, without present remedie be ministred, of which there be two kindes, the one miserable and pitifull, yet necessarie to preserue the rest of the whole bodie, which is, taking off of the member wounded, in that it is so hurt and mainied that it is past al hope of recouery.
But yet in vsing of this extreme remedy in this desperate case, the iudgement of euery common Chyrurgion is not to be followed, which take vpon them that most honest name, so soone as they haue learned the way to make to cut off, to part a sunder, and as may sayto play the butcher, and haue no other remedy but a saw, and certain cautarizes, wherwith they get boldnesse, which they call hardinesse, which count to be most pernitious and daungerous, except it bee ioyned with wisedome and skill, for because haue often seene great inconueniences, and somewhiles miserable death to haue followed such butchelie boldnesse, notwithstanding the greatnesse of the griefe beyng diligently wayed, and certainly found out, that by no other meanes it is to be cured: then by good reason, let such be called, which are both prudent and wise, and haue had by experience triall in the like case, and then let the member bee taken of, if it may be, when as yet, there is no inflamation or anie other euill accident, that thereby the rest of the whole bodie may be saued.
But first let the Chyrurgion declare such as are requisite to be told of: neither is it to be doubted that auie lesse diligence is required, then danger appeareth, especially when the bones of ye shoulders or hip be burst, which neuer without great tearing of the muskles, and of the vaines, and other partes, where hence commeth commonly sodaine inflamations, Gangrena, and at the last, mortification, for if there are to be found of the antient Phisitians, which would in no case meddle with ye onely rupture of these bones, yea some willed the wounded member to be cut off, when the bones but hanged out of flesh, what would they say now pray you if they saw these horrible ruptures, which happen co~monly through violence of this deadly and diuelish tormentes, the whiche dayly is so increased, by the wicked and naughtie deuises of some, that almost there cannot any medicines be found to cure it, nor any harnesse sufficient to defend it, but as concerning this heauie and sorrowful remedie, which is ye disine~bring the member, we shal haue a fitter place to intreate of it, in the chapter of Gangrena and Sphacelus.
For nowe we will goe to the other remedie, which is more profitable and better, and is done by manuell operation as they tearme it, and must be assayed by all meanes, as wee haue sayd in the beginning of this chapter.
To which purpose the Chyrurgions, set downe two intentions, whereof the one respecteth the rupture, and willeth as nigh as may bee, that all the broken bones be reduced to their naturall seates, which being done, she commandeth the whole ioynt to be rowled and pressed with linnen clothes, wetted first in some conuenient liquor to keepe backe all accidentes, the which some allowe at the first dressing, that the vnetion may be the surer, and woulde not haue it quite vndone, till fortie dayes be expired, but to lose it, and binde it harder, in the meane space, as neede shall require, except it be through intollerable itching, inflamation, paine, or such like: and to remedie suche, they prescribe an orderly dyet, or bloudletting, or operation, or suche locall medicines, as shalbe thought meete.
The other intention respecteth the wound, and forbiddeth that it be hid and rowled so fast, as is vsed in fractures, in that it requireth to be dressed oft, that the filth and excrementes whiche nature expelleth may haue issue, and for that cause some vse straightwayes setones (as they tearme them) if it may easily bee put in the wound, which they annoint first with meete medicines: And some vse onely tentes, and if neede require, they also amplifie and inlarge the orifice thereof, and likewise the lower partes, whereby all filth and baggage may issue out the better, and so the parts are broughtin a better case, easier to be cured, Likewise they dayly diminish their tents, making them shorter shorter, whereby ye wound may heale the better and incarnate the faster, to which purpose they vse medicines meete for wounds by shot, of which we made relation in the former treatise.
Moreouer to finish this last intention, they haue a great regard to charge the patient to vse meates that are iuicy and good, and such as conglutinate, till such time as Callus is growne, and chiefly because the nature of those woundes is suche, that they seeme to tarie for the consolidation of the bones.
This maner of curing is vsed nowe adayes of diuers Chyrurgions, when ye bones are fractured, whose iudgement could not but highly commend (because they haue of their sides, the opinion of moste excellent men, which haue and doe vse the same maner of curiyng) were it not that the thing it selfe, and also experience did plainely teache me, and as it were set before my eyes, the innumerable inconueniences, which happen through these splintes, and hard binding, for they oftentimes bring accidentes, as paine, inflamation, and Gangrena, whereunto these kindes of woundes are greatly subiect, also they hinder the exhallations of these humours, which in these woundes abound, and oftentimes choke naturall heate, and do hinder the knowledge of manie greeuous accidentes, and letts, that remedie therefore cannot be ministred as it ought, except it be, when it is too late when they are compelled to loose these round and crosse bandes: which is done then perhaps, when these commodities haue so taken hold, that they cannot wel be remedied, as they might if in time they had bene looked to: wherefore these vulgar and common ligatures, meet only for fractures, by my iudgement, is no wayes to be vsed in woundes ioyned with fractures, and especially in those which happen by shot, and ioyned with fractures, as may be gathered by reasons before alledged, in whiche case it behoueth the Chyrurgion to be carefull, least he do any thing wilfullie and rashly which after, too late he may repent.
Nowe in my iudgement thinke it best, that the bones by and by before inflamation be ingendred, be brought in their seate and naturall forme, with as little paine as may be to the patient, and then to vse such medicines, as are profitable to both inte~ctions that is, for the wound fracture, and because haue seene the verie same order vsed of most learned and skilfull Phisitions, being of mine acquaintance, aswel in Germany as in diuers other places.
thought it not good to passe ouer this order, whiche they are woont to holde and followe in curing wounds with fracture, especially because iudge it is most meet for woundes by shotte, in that they discommend this common and hard ligaturs or binding, for no other cause, but for the paine, inflamations, and Gangrena, whiche commonly comes thereby, whereunto those woundes by aboue all other (as we sayd before) are most subiect, therefore so soone as the bones bee brought in their due places, and the member rightly placed as it ought, and the wound dressed, spred this Cerote following on a linnen cloth first wet with oxyrhodino, and lay it about the wound, for it is very good for all fractures.
Take Rosen, waxe, ana· lb. i. pul cort tilia {ounce} iii. succi geranij, {ounce} iiii. boyle them to the thicknesse of a cerote and vse it.
Take the gumme of the rotes of Comphery and vsci pomar. and popul ana {ounce} iiii. suc geranij {ounce} vi. lapid. sabulos.

In the meane while in the would it selfe, about it, vse fit medicines and defensiues, of which wee haue spoken before.
Moreouer you must see that the wounded part be rightly placed, if need be, rowled in a plate of lead, bowed to the fashion of a leg or an arme, or els wt sodden lether fastened together with buckles, whereby the bones, which were broken, may the surer be holden together, which ought not, (as litle as may be) be shaken and mooued, vntill hee is cured, and the bandes loosed, and vse also vulnerary potions meete to that purpose, by which onely haue seene fractures cured, the bones beeing rightly placed, and that haue seene to be especially obserued in Germany.
remember also learned at Reystadium not farre from Rayns, that the inhabiters there doe vse a certaine stone named by his vertue Beinbruch, they giue one dram thereof in red wine in the morning, wherein periuincle was infused all night, continue so iiii. or v. dayes, by this meanes they take away paine and dangerous accidentes, and heale the fracture in foure or fiue daies, to the great admiration of all men, whereof my selfe am witnesse, and also Matheolus maketh mention thereof in hys commentaries: Also they are woont to vse the same stone made in forme of a cataplasme, with Geranio brused, and oyle oliue, or oile of Roses, which commeth to so good effect, that the bones doo conglutinate without any paine or inflamation, which were almost incredible: were not, that besides my selfe, there were innumerable witnesses which haue seene it with their eyes.
Wherefore iudge that this kinde of medicine is most excellent in these kinde of wounds ioyned with fracture, for the greatest part of the worke is past, when the bones bee so soone and easie conglutinated without any inconuenience, in that the fracture doth nothing hinder vs, but that we may cure the wound: as if it were onely contused.
Moreouer it openeth to vs a compendious and briefe curation, and most fittest to ease the sicke.
But in so much as the stone is not to bee had in all places (that it were well if the pothecaries had it alwayes to sell) you may vse a vulnerarie potion in steed therof to cure wounds wt fracture described in our antidotary, which you shall finde in cap· de potionibus vul. and in the meane space, vse my catagmatico, which is excellent for the same purpose: and if there be no feare of inflamation, you may put to it the gumme or iuice of Aristolochiae, adders tongue, boraxe, and crocus martis to harden Callus, to strengthen the member: but if the peeces of the bones be so small that they may fall off, then vse this
Take the iuice of Aristolochiae, serpentary, ireos, periwinele, of ech {ounce} iii. white wine {ounce} vi. aqua vitae {ounce} iii. myrrhe sarcacolla, mastick, ireos guaiaci ana {ounce}i. aleos hep. m. mummiae ana {ounce}. ss. cloues {dram} i. circulate the~ in B. iiii. dayes, then seeth the~ to ye consumtion of the third part, then straine it, reserue it, that you may vse it with a siringe when occasion shal require.
This iniection besides that, is most excellent for the bones: it also clenseth the wounde, and by little and little doth incarnate, and may be vsed to cure it throughly: but if it happen the bone to be corrupted, and beginneth to putrifie, which oftentimes comes to passe through the comming in of the aire, then the which, is nothing worse to a fracture, in which case you may vse this remedie following: and although there is no mention thereof before, yet is it very profitable.
Take the oile of myrrhe distilled per dissensum and purified with the spirite of wine {ounce} ss. oile of cloues {dram} it oile of sulphur· distilled with colcater {dram} i. ss. mixe them togither, and when you will vse it, touch the corrupted bone twise or thrise, with a little cotten bound to the ende of an instrument, and wetted in the foresaid liquor, and then will the putrified bone heale, and all that is rotten scale away.
Take oile of tartar distilled by a retorte, oile of guaici ana {ounce} ss. oile of sulphur and of vitrioll ana {dram} i. mixe them and vse it as aforesaid.
Take Balsalmo merc. {ounce} ss. oile of Antimonie {ounce} iii. salt of saturne {dram} ii. mixe them togither.
There cannot be deuised or found out a better remedie, and more fitter for this purpose: for it also cureth naughtie and ligne vlcers, and to the lippes of the wounde, and about it, apply that emplaister which is most fittest to draw out the cotten bones, and very good to cure the wound throughly.
Of wounds by shot which perce the other part of the bodie without fracture of the bones.
FUrthermore if the shot haue perced the breast, sides or lower parts of the belly: it must be considered whether the wound extendeth to the hollownes thereof: and if it do, whether any principall part be hurt, that you may giue a perfite prognostication, as we haue taught in the chapter de sig. Iudic.
For if it perceth not the body, it requireth not any other kinde of handling or healing then that generally described of vs before: but if it happen otherwise then there are some things to be obserued properly and particularly, for if case the brest be perced, and the bullet not gone through, we must assay to take it out, and not onely that, but also whatsoeuer is therein else: and we must wisely waigh whether any blood he fallen in the hollownesse thereof, which if it be, it must warily be taken in turning and placing the bodie of the sicke, in such wise as shall seeme best.
And all other kinde of remedies for this purpose, must be vsed by enlarging the wound, and leauing it open vntill time require, that the blood may come forth the better, and by this meanes diuers incommodities are withstoode, which commonly comes through the retention of bloode in these partes, whereunto these wounds are greatly subiect.
Also in this case vulner arie potions are of great force, in that they dissolue conieled blood, and keepe it from coagulations, and minister them to the sicke first euery morning, and also in the euening, as you haue learned in the last chapter of our Antidot. de potio vul.
The rest of the curation you may performe by such wayes and remedies as are vsed in other wounds by shot.
But yet this one thing is singularly and particularly to be obserued, that such medicines be altered, and their formes chaunged into iniections, as neede shall require: for otherwise they cannot reach the bottome thereof to worke their force, which iniections may be made of these medicines which are prescribed of vs in the former treatise: and they must be cast in by a spoute, which haue proued to errest all other instrumentes, in that it sucketh vp againe that which he cast in, which is required in the vse of the remedies.
After this you shall fasten some tent with a threed, and put it in the hollownes of the wound, of such length as shall seeme meetest to alwayes the mouth of the wounde open, that the inward parts being purged and clensed, may by litle and litle incarnat, before the orofice be quite growne togither, least otherwise the filth within might be stopped.
Moreouer whiles the sicke is a healing, he must eschew the cold aire: for nothing is more hurtfull to such wounds, and if both sides be perced, you must put tents in both holes, and by so much the more keepe them open the longer that the matter way the easier haue issue.
But if that Callus happen to growe, as sometimes it doth, apply such remedies as hereafter shalbe declared.
As concerning his diet, let him keepe such as is prescribed in other wounds, that is cold, dry, and scle~der, but let him abstaine from astringent and sharpe meates, and that from the beginning, because they moue the cough, and bring shortnesse of breath, which thing commonly doth greatly hurt the seely sicke patient: contrariwise such things as comfort the brest, are very good, as figges, raisons picked, barly and other like, and bloodletting also is very good, and euacuation by glister, and otherwise if the body be filled with ill iuice: The like in all points is to be obserued in wounds of the belly, thecuration of which is not vnlike to the cure of other wounds by shot, which we haue set downe already, although these vulner ary potions are more in vse, in that in the partes they more perfitly worke, and shew their strength.
And such potious must bee mixed as intentions shall require, and more strengthners must be vsed, if any nutritiue part be hurt, as the liuer and splene, which also is good to foment outwardly: and sometimes such wounds are cured by giuing fit glisters, when they shall touch the lower parts: but if the perce the body, and hurt the backe bone, then you must vse these remedies which wee haue prescribed in wounds of the heade: and the like iudgement is to bee giuen, if the marrow of the backe come forth, as was before touching the braine.
But because it oftentimes happeneth, that the shotte is drawne from the vpper parts lower, and so sticketh in some member, and commeth not out, in which case the filth and matter cannot haue issue out, then it must be wayed, where the shot may without daunger be taken out by the lower way, which the easier may bee done if you may feele it with your fingers, for yt wayes it may far better be taken out, as we said before, where we intreated of taking out things infixed: but if that cannot be, then must we vse compressions and hard bindings, that there by the corruption may come forth the for by pressing of it toward the oree it issueth the better, also iniections are good for these ewy woundes, because other medicines cannot reach the bottome of them, but you must giue indeuour, that you leaue none thereof in the wound, but draw it vp againe with your spout which cast it in.
In these kinds of wounds, tents made of sponges are very good, because they draw corruption and sucke it in, and dry the wound.
But because oftentimes the lippes of the wound ware hard, which letteth perfite consolidation, you shall therefore vse the remedies following, for they are most fitin this case and for all fistulaes, neither shall you need to vse hot irons, the which extreme remedy the common Chyrurgeons are wont to apply.
Take oile of hony drawne by heate of fire {ounce}ii. oile of saturne and mercury sublimate ana {dram}i. olei petr. and of ana {dram}i. ss. let them be ioyned togither with turpentine and with tentes or plegets, and apply to the wound.
Take Antimoni {ounce} iii. of mercuyie sublimate {ounce}i. ss. mellis {ounce} vi. mixe all togither and distill them in a according to art with a small fire, there will issue an oile most to cure al callous and mallgne fistulaes, cankers, and also Gangrena.
The order to correct such accidents as happen to these wounds.
ALllearned Phisitions do grant, that those greenous accidents which doe greatly diminish ouerthrow the strength of ye bodie, are first to be cured, letting passe (for a while) the proper curation of the wound, and the curation of these accidentes is, not as an accident, but as the cause of pulling downe strength, or any other grieuous affection.
Therefore great paine, intempery, impostumation, Gangrena, seuers, cramp~es and Sphacelus, because they are weightie and daungerous accidents, and do often happen to the wounds, must out of bee remedied in that they ken strength, and bring perillous diseases, in this case therefore, method must be altered, least by the violence of these accidents, the patient be killed, else through the crueltie thereof he be sore vexed, and let the curation beginne, where the siche is in most danger, for thither the Phisition ought to direct his comming, for no wound can perfectly be cured, except first suche accidentes be driuen away, Therefore haue thought it good to discourse of them all with a fit method and order, and with few wordes to prescribe to eche hys proper remedie.
We asswage paine with onodinis, or els with paregoricis medicamentis, which are temperate agreeable to our bodies, and hold in the first degree, and of a thinne substance, and this we doe with fometation and lynaaments.
Fomentations are made with the decoction of the root of hollihocke, sheepes heades, mallowes, of the flowers of Mullein, camomill mellilote of the seedes of linen fenigrecke and milke.
Lynaments are made of ye Macilage seminum psillij, fenigreck, and of hollihock of butter, capons grease, and bawsons grease, of oesypo and oyle of visci pomorum.
Also Narcotica asswage paine, by henumming the feeling of the member and making at first, that it cannot feele the raging of the paine, we vse such when through great paine, the strength is wasted, and feare of swounding draweth on, and when the payne comes of great Take the rotes of the henbane, and waters lilies, ana lb. s. digest them in the sonne with vineger of roses, and oyle of Nenuphar, for a fewdayes: then straine it, and therewith foment the place agreeued, warme, and after annoynt with this lineament.
Take the iuice of the leaues of henbane and senegrene ana {ounce} ii. olei visci pomorum nenuphar ana {ounce} i. ss. freshe butter {ounce} ii. mixe them, and make thereof a lineament, and let the wise Phisition alwaies marke this, that he be very carefull to asswage paine, for it alwaies prognosticateth some ill: and let this suffise, for that we haue prescribed manie medicines before this intention.
If a whote distemperature do molest the wounded part, which is easily knowne by paine and blistering thereof, then annoint it with vnguent nutrito, or Caphurato albo with populion: this following is of great force.
Take the iuice of plantaine, night shade, houseleeke ana {ounce} i. bolearmeny {ounce} ss. litharge washed with plantine water and tuttie prepared ana {ounce} i. oleiros. omphac. and of nenuphar ana {ounce} ii. vineger of roses and a little waxe, and make an vnguent.
But if it haue a colde distemperature which is knowne by the fastnesse, then is it remedied by fomenting therof with wherein was sodden dill, lyneseed, and the flowers of Camomel.
We speake nothing of Haemorrhagia, because we haue made sufficient mention thereof before.
You must presently beware that a feuer come not, but keepe him backe by a cold and slender diet: by blood letting and by purging such humors as offend.
But if it cha~ce that it increaseth (as haue oft seene) and breed to an ague, then the humors must be digested with some conuenient decoction, and then purged againe, wherunto the Phisition must take diligent heede, and by ali meanes helpe the sicke, least by the sharpnesse of the griefe, death doth follow.
The Phisitions affirme that conuulsions may come by three occasions: the first is emptinesse, which proceedeth through ouermuch purging, or immoderate bleeding, which is daungerous, as Hippoc. witnesseth Aphon.
The seconde is repletion or fulnesse, which happeneth through vnnatural tumors rising about the wounde and suddenly vanishing away: and through ouermuch cold which contracteth the sinewes, and staieth them backe and filleth them, the which also Hippoc. hath noted Afforisme
It happeneth also, the braine being affected per consensum, by reason of great paine, when either a synew is pricked, or else when sharpe and venemous humors do alter and corrupt nature: whereof comes paines, as Hippoc. witnesseth, through which by the vehemencie of the sence, cramps arise.
Conuulsion comming through emptinesse is thus cured: First let a diet be prescribed which is moist, let the sicke take supings of almond milke, ptisan, or any conuenient broth, and prepare him a bath wherein hath bene boiled moist things and such as haue vertue to asswage paine, such are the heades and feete of wethers: also the rootes of holihocks, mallowes, violets, and the leaues of mistelto of the apple tree, and let the sicke stande therein, if so his wounde will suffer him, or els foment the affected part therewith.
After this annoint it with oleo visci pomorum violarum, or with some ointment made of the aforesaid things.
And because this conclusion proceeding through emptinesse, being once consumed is incurable, as Galen saith in lib.
Wee must haue therefore recourse to some excellent remedie, that is the tincture of gold, or of ye natural Balme, for if there be any hope left, it consisteth in these two.
But if the conuulsion come through fulnesse, it is cured by a slender diet, and in the beginning somewhat hot and drie: yet wine is to be eschewed, for it increaseth fluxes, and the synewes, and vse to drink in the steed therof Hydromel maluacicum or smamon water, and after make euacuation partly vniuersally, as by Phlebotomy and purgation: and partly by the part agreeued, which is done with vnguentis Aregonis and Martiati with oile of castorie, of a foxe, of baies and such like, wherwith (the bodie being purged) annoint plentifully the necke and all the backe bone, and also the wounded member, but yet those which follow seeme to me more profitable.
Take harts tallow, bawsons greace and beares greace ana {ounce}i. olei laurini {ounce}i. ss. olei vnlpini, castorei, terebinth. iuniper. lumbr. ana {ounce}. ss. vnguenti Agrip.
Dialth. ana {ounce} ii. turpentine washed in water of lillies {ounce} i. Euphorbii {scruple} i. and with a litle waxe make therof an ointment, or else thus.

Take aquarum lilii conuallii iuniperi ana {ounce} i. oile of amber {scruple}. ss. make thereof a mixture: or els this.
Take the water of and the water of Florum tiliae ana {ounce} i. oile of iuniper drawne by Balneo, gut, iiii. oile of Amber {scruple}. ss. of the spirit of vitrioll gutij, mixe them.
But if the conuuision shall come per conuulsio sympathiam by reason of great pain, let the paine be aswaged with such medicines as are declared in ye chapter de dolore.
And if it happe~ through the sharpnes of the poison and venemous shot, which oftentimes happeneth to these wounds, the~ you may vse these remedies which we haue set downe in the Chapter de venenatis vul.
And if it happen through pricking or cutting of a nerue, which haue seene oftentimes to happen, not through the stroke of the shot taken (which rather bruseth the sinewes, then cutteth or pricketh them) but by the vns kilfulnesse of the Chyrurgion, in going about to take out the shot, or vse any incision, do oftentimes prick the nerues ouerthawrt, whereby conuulsion comes: especially if they chance to touch any of those which go to the muscles.
In this case now, (that this dangerous accident may be withdrawne) such medicines must be which by the subtlenesse of their substance, may perce to the very bottome of the hurted nerue, and also digest aud aswage paine, as Galen lib. Artis med. doth teach.
And contrariwise such must be eschewed as are raw and colde, and such as stoppe and hinder perspiration.
Likewise Galen forbiddeth the vse of hot water, as a thing very hurtful to ye wounded sinews, because they consist of cold, moist co~iealed substance, the which being so, must needs putrifie and resolue by the applying of such thinges as are hot and moilt.
And therefore hot water is hurtfull to them, although otherwise it greatly aswageth impostumation, whereof admonish those which indifferently without any regarde, vse this remedy in these wounds by shot: for Galen writeth, in li.
meth. med. that rather oleum iasminum, especially sabinum veterum, are moste profitable for wounds of the sinews.
He aloweth also turpentine rosine, likewise Sulphur viuum, in the same book is greatly commended of him in wounds of the nerues, in that it is of a subtill substance, then it must needs follow that these oiles drawne chymically out of turpentine, rosine, waxe, Sulphur, and sabine to be of a greater force, because by distillation they are made much more subtiller: and thereby they doo drie more strongly.
Meth. med. is to be obserued in puncturs of the nerues, for words are these.
Nerui vulnerati curatio medicamenta postulat, quae tepidum calorem, valenter (sine molestia tamen) desiccare possint.
Tum quae ex substantiae suae natura, vim habeant, tenuim partium sint.
And by way this one thing is to bee noted, that these bodies which are strong, require stronger medicines, and such as are weake, weaker: by which reason this following may be vsed.
Take olei sulph. terebenth, olei sabinae therebenth. ana {dram} ii· oile of eggs {ounce} ss. mixe them, and apply them warme to the griefe.
Take oile of butter, and of rosine ana {dram}ii. olei cuphorbii distillati and oile of iuniper berries ana {dram} ss. oile of turpentine {dram}i. ss. oile of yelkes of egges {ounce} i. mixe them: but if the griefe cease not by the application of the foresaid medicines, then the nerue is whole to be cut a sunder: whereof as Galen saith, comes no daunger, sauing onely the member shall euer after be maimed.
The Palsie, or resolution of the sinewes (which oftentimes happeneth to such wounds) must be cured by an apt and fit application of inward and outward medicines: as fomentations, cataplasmes, lynaments, and such like.
Some higher commendeth oleum iasminum: olea saluiae, castorei, de lateribus, vulpinum and such like.
Take aquarum lilii conuallii florum lauendulae ana {ounce} iiii. boile these perfitely with halfe a pound of sugar, and taking it from fire, put therto olei succini flaui per descens distil. rectified {scruple} i. s. oile of sinamon and essence of sage ana {scruple} ss make lozings thereof, and let the sicke vse thereof.
Take oyle of Hipericon lb. i. turpentine lb. ss· oyle. of bayes {ounce} oyle of spike {ounce} i. Iuniper berries lb. ss. eastorie {ounce} i. euphorbii {ounce}. ii.

Brocks grease {ounce}iii. digest all for a moneth in horse doong, and then distill them according to and annoynt the member hauing the and crampe, for it is a most excellent remedie.
Syncope or sownning is a dangerous accident, and signifieth death to be not farre off, and is verie incident to these kinde of wounds, caused eyther through great fluxe of bloud, or els through vehement paine and griefe.
The curation thereof is not to be neglected, but the spirites and strength must be restored, by giuing some nourishment, made of iellie, expressions, distilled liquors, wine and spices.
The ancients haue commended cordial powders, ex margaritis splend. ras. ebor. ex folijs auri frag. pretio sorum. lap. which must be ministred in wine, or sirop of

spagir. praepar. where also you shall find the order to prepare them.
We haue written of sundrie accidentes and inconueniences happening to these woundes, but yet there is none so pitifull and dangerous, as is Gangrena, which is a token of corruption drawing on, which comes according to the opinion of Paul, eyther because the inflamation was not defended, are brought to suppuratition, or else (as others iudge) when the aboundance of humours, with some euill, and maligne qualitie, doe choake and extinguish the naturall heate of the member, which happeneth in great inflamations, and obstructions through the vse of Emplasters, which hindereth perspiration, as before we haue noted: and whensoeuer a thinne and virulent quitture issueth, it is a manifest signe thereof, whereunto except present helpe be ministred, it is to be doubted, least the part corrupted and dead, will infect the partes adioyning next vnto it, and so to fall into mortification, the whiche they call sphacelus or sideratio, the which is knowne, if the member be wan or blacke: and doth appeare swolne, softe, and like death, and that without anie beating of the arteries, and without paine feeling, yea that a man may thrust in the knife, and neuer feele this mortified and dead member, must presently be cut off, so farre as it extendeth, and as for Gangrena, it must be cured all other thinges layd aside, the which is done by drawing out the corrupted bloud, fro~ the member by lancing, applying of such medicines, as bring to putrifaction, as foresayd Paule hath taught the common Chyrurgions so soone as they haue scarified and launced the member, wash it straight with salt water, or salt and vineger. others vse Egiptiacum, which is alwayes to be had at the Apothecaries, and if the griefe mend not thereby, then they take stronger, as causticks, and suche as bring eschar, suche are trochisci Andronis and Arsnicke, and if great neede be, they seare the dead flesh from the quicke with a hote iron.
Also these medicines following are very good for Gangrena, But first let the corrupted bleud be drawne out, then washed with this lotion.
Take soot ounce iiii. honie, ss ii. of vineger lb, boyle them to halfe, or this.
Take the iuice of radish selandine ana ou~ce. ii. oyle of honie {ounce} ss. the sower fleame of alome {ounce} iiii. salt Peter {dram} ii. salte of soote, {dram} ss. them for a lotion.
Or els take the fleame of vitrioll and alome ana {ounce} iiii. vineger {ounce} ii. powder of ye root of aristolochie ounce i. ss. salte of Tarter ounce i. Myrrhe ounce ss. camphere ounce ss. boyle the~ all togither, tillhalfe be wasted, make a lotion which must be oft vsed.
Take Tartar calcined white {ounce} ii. ashes of Aristoloc. rootes, or of Uine twigs ana {ounce} i. ss. salt niter, Camphere ana {ounce}. ss. phleme of vitrioll and alome ana lb. i. boyle them to halfe and make there of a lie, and vse it as aforesayd, the member being first scarified, and then lay thereon this Cerote following.
Take waxe, ana {ounce} iii. liquor of Myrrhe {ounce} ii. colophonie ounc i. ss. oyle of and eggs ana ounce ss. make a cerote according to arte, or els thus.
Take honie {ounce} ii. Crocus martis, Crocus vener. ana {ounce} ss. powder of Myrrhe Aristoloch. rotundae ana {dram}. ii. Camphere {dram} i. s. sower fleame of vitrioll {ounce} iiii. boyle them to the thickenesse of an vnguent, and put thereto mercur.
Precipitati ounce ss. and annoyntthe tentes or plegettes therewith, or els thus.
Precipitati. {ounce} ss. oyle of myrhe {dram} iii. mixe them with honnie first, washed with the iuice of Selandine.
There cannot be found a better remedie then this for the cure of Gangrena, so be it, that first you take away from the Arsnicke, all is venome, and blacke, naughtie and stincking furkes, which is done by fixing thereof, as shalbe tght in our spagiricall Antidotary.
For other wise cannot allowe the iudgement of those which will yt Arsnick crude and vnprepared to be vsed in Gangrena because it is a medicine corosiue, and putrifactiue, through the euil and venomous qualitie that it hath, it destroyeth the substance of the flesh, and bringes it to a rotten and stincking deadlinesse, whiche is farre worse then Gangrena it selfe, wherefore by their leaue the vse thereof is verie dangerous, except first (as wee sayde before) it be rightly prepared.
And shall not be amisse, in the meane while to lay thereon a Cataplasme made with the flower of Lupins orobus lentils, and beanes, which may be boyled with oximell or the lye aforesayd.
But and if all these medicines doe nothing preuayle, but by the foresayd signes, you perceiue that Gangrena will grow to sphacelus, then must you presently (if it may be) cut of the member, so much that nothing that is corrupted remaynes: which some doe, without anie paine at all, with a threed made de Alumine plumae and dippid in the oyle of Mercurie sublymate, called of some, aqua infernalis.
Others take it off wt a sawe, then seare it with a hote iron, and so by the aduise of Galen, they stop quickly the fluxe of bloud, driue awaie putrifaction and strengthen the member.
After that the putrifaction is taken away, and the fluxe of bloud stayed, they vse such medicines as take away the scarre, as vnguent macedonicum, butter, and such like: and after yt, such cure is conuentent as to other vlcers: but in the meane while, you may not forget to prescribe an orderly kind of diet, such a one as is both slender and cooling, as or any medicines, which clarifie bloud if need shall require, neyther forbid such medicines as defend the heart, (the fountame of life) from all filthie and euillfumes comming from the sicke member to the same.
THE SPAGERICKE ANTIDOTARIE OF the preparation and making of medicines against Gunshot.
IT is an olde and true saying of the Poet.
That there is nothing more imperious then an ignorant man, which thinketh nothing well done, but what hee doth himselfe, which thing, as it may be seene in many other arts, yet most specially in this, which is called Spagericke arte.
For we see euery where certame men, knowe not what they be, puffed vp with a certaine barbarous and foolishe pride, which with great scorne inuey against those medicines which are drawne out of the mettaline mines: Which notwithstanding, it is apparant were in vse and had in great estimation with the chiefe antient Phisitions, as we haue declared in that booke which we haue set forth of the spagiricke preparation of medicines.
And what pray you is the cause of this anger, or rather madnesse: but that (as they themselues confesse) they knowe not the preparation of them.
happie artes, if onely artificers might iudge them, (as Fabius is reported sometime to haue said.)
Then are they vnhappy of whome the ignorant and vnlearned feare not so rashly to giue iudgement, which neuer yet vnderstoode from whence, or why, this is called the Spagiricke arte whiche learned men of two Greeke wordes haue so named, because by that arte, a certaine subtill and spirituall nature is drawne, gathered and pressed out, wherein the force and effect of the medicine doth chiefly confist.
The great and incomparable commoditie whereof as it appeareth in many other diseases, so shall it chiefly be knowne in curing woundes by Gunshot.
As trust (God willing) it shall much more happily be tryed and found out by the preparations of medicines animall, vegetable, and minerall, and by other essences drawne out of mercurie, Sulphur.
Uitrioll, arsenicke, Iron, Copper, Lead, and Litarge, and also out of Antimony and such other mineralles, as also out of ye grose and fattie bodies of simple mettals: of whome it is farre off, that the force should be so great, although the antient Phisitions haue vsed them to cure woundes, and vlcers, (as their writinges doe testifie) as the force of their spirites, which may be called, as it were their soules.
But (peraduenture some of those backebiters wil say) why are not we content with those medicines which the learned antiquitie hath deliuered vnto vs, and that Hypocrates and Galen the antient pillers of our arte and others haue set forth in theyr monumentes: Why doe we seeke new wayes neuer heard of before, specially vnknowne to the Apothecaryes: But some of vs will answere, that the only remedie of Mercurie precipitate, is the onelie remedie (to passe ouer other) which verie lately they haue begun to vse, in curing of woundes by Gunshot and other maligne were sufficient to aunswere this their question, yea and to reproue their follie ioyned with intoller able pride.
But if authoritie be asked for, thinke Gesner, Guinter, Andernacke, Seuerine (to passe ouer a great many other) wil be for vs as great authoritie wt the learned: as these slanderers.
Specially because the learning of these famous men is so confirmed by their learned writinges and monumentes, that those toonges might count it a greater honoue vnto them to confesse themselues their schollers.
It were easie for me to bring forth many other argumentes, if did not see the follie of these backbiters to be so great, wherof truely am ashamed, specially when behold some of their books lately set forth, wherein, contrarie to the purpose of the treatise, strange thinges are infarced, that (as the olde prouerbe saith) the oyntment seemeth to consist in nothing: as though they pertained to the purposed intreating of curing the gout, certain inuectiue digressions know not what, of the beginning of thinges, of the originall of mettals Philosophers stone (which of them is called Morosophocus) or did in any other poynt seeme to agree with it.
How farre vnlike was the purpose of many old men, the which if they were ignorant of any thing, which they vnderstood, was knowne of other, euen in farre distant countries, they spared no labour to goe see them.
Plato inflamed with desire to learne those thinges, which he knew not, went into Egypt, and after to Tarentum to Architas, and ouer all Italie to heare the other Pythagoricall Philosophers, Appollonius Tyanius trauailed through the kingdome of Persia, and passed ouer the mountaine Caucasus, and visited the Albanes, Scythians, Massagetes, and all the rich kingdomes of India.
Afterwardes was caried vnto the Brachmanes, and heard Iarchus in his chaire of gold disputing of the hidden causes of thinges, and of the hidden misteries of nature.
From thence by the Elanutes, Babylonians, Chaldees, Meedes, Assirians, Arabians, and Palestines, he returned to Alexandria, and from thence went into Ethiopia to heare the Gymnosophistes, and to learne their secret and hidden artes.
This vertue is truely to be followed, and not the sluggishnesse of those slothfull followers, which hauing searse once moued their foote from their countrie fires, yet will disalowe this Spagericke arte, and thinke further labour to be taken in searching of the trueth, when notwithstanding the arte doth make open vnto vs the marueilous and hidden secretes of nature: Neither in my iudgement are they vnworthely contemned of those which with their manifold and trauels haue sought out those secretes of nature.
But pray you, what foolishnes is this, to forbid vs to vse any other medicins then those which were known in old time: As though Rhabarbe, then which no medicine is more in vse at this day, the~ were known to the olde Phisitions.
Further to what purpose is it that they obiect vnto vs ye sulphurie metaline, venomous stinckes (as they call them) by whose smell and drawne breath (for these are their contumelious words) they be almost strangled that come into the dennes of those Cyclops? But is it vnknowne vnto those slaunderers and sicophantes, that the olde Phisitions made verie many medicines of most filthie thinges, as of the filth of eares, sweate of the body, of womens menstrewes (and that which is horrible to be spoken) of the doong of man, and other beastes, spittle, vrine, flyes, mise, the ashes of an Owles head, the of Goates and Asses, ye worms of a rottentree, and the of Mules, as may be gathered out of the writinges of Galen, Aetij, Aegineta, Diose.
Serap: to passe the metalines which it is euident they did also vse. Truely, when consider with my selfe the pride of these fooles which disdaine this mettaline part of Phisicke (which after their maner contumeliously they call Chymericam, and therefore can neyther helpe their owne nor many other diseases.
call to minde a storie peraduenture knowne vnto the~ of Heraclito Ephesio, which being sick of a dropsie, dispising the helpe of Phisitions, annoynting himselfe ouer with Cowdoong, set himselfe in the sunne to drie, and falling a sleepe was torne in peeces of dogges: but these are more then sufficiently answered vnto these scoles and slanderers.
Nowe will declare what is my purpose and scope in this treatise: verily to prescribe plainely hereafter, not those thinges which are alreadie common, or (as it is commonly sayde) knowne to blinde men and barbers, least might seeme to imitate those which write rhapsodias and heapes, but the methode and way of preparing medicines by Spagericke arte, that pertaine vnto Gunshot, which knowe are yet vnknowne vnto many Phisitions and Chyrurgions.
And this can truely confesse that am induced for two causes to doe it.
First to prouoke those that are better learned, if they haue any better medicines, to vtter them, as also that might specially help my countrie and mankinde: vnto the which (the more is the griefe) there is too much neede of those kinde of medicines in these moste lamentable and cruell times, wherein it hath so long bene bloudied with domesticall and Ciuell warres: but to encounter with their slaunders which crie out that these kinde of medicines doe not onele require long and preparation, but also that they are so deare that euerie one cannot easily vse them.
haue thought good therefore first to set downe common medicines, and then to come to those which doe farre more esteeme, as indeede they are farre more excellent then the other, as by their preparatio~ you may know.
Albeit also haue determined to haue consideration of the poore and common souldier, and to set downe them apart that shall helpe the rich.
THerefore the Chyrurgions are to bee admonished that when they go into the warres that they take with them these things readie prepared, which are to be had at most Pothecaries.

There be made other remedies for the foresaid intents, the making whereof we haue described in their proper places, which commit to the iudgement of the skilfull Chyrurgion to vse wisely, as the disease and partie affected doth require.
Now there to speake of drinkes for wounds, before we teach the preparation of medicines.
THese potions for woundes although they driue not out the humors downwards, yet they very much to clense wounds, because they clense superfiuous humors, and the blood from al filth, and by a certaine maruellous quallitie wherewith they excell, they knit the broken bones, help the sinows that are hurt by wounds, and helping nature, they at last fill the wounds with flesh, and close them vp without vsing any other remedie: when as saw in Germany the maruellous, and almost incredible effect which came by ye vse of these potions, eue~ in curing of desperate vlcers, thought it not meete to passe ouer the mention of them, and that so much the rather, because knew the vse of them in time past was allowed, but now through the negligence of Phisitions to be almost grown of vse.
Also haue experienced those potions to be taken not onely as medicines, but also as no irisments, and to helpe all the passions and incommodities whereunto wounds are subiect.
You shall much better draw out the strength of those simples sort, if you put them into a tunne of white must and digest them there two monethes, or if you cut the greene herbs very small, and wring out the iuice of them into a Pelicane, or blind Lunbeck, and circulate them
This last way is most conuenient for them that are forbidden the vse of wine, specially they be wounded in the heade.
The distilled wa of them be also good if they be taken dayly by themselues morning and euening with and manner conuenient: Or if white wie be delayed with them (if it be granted to the wounded) heere followeth the compositions of the vulnerarie potions.

Nucis vomica i. dram and a halfe, beate them grosely, and put them into a glasse vessell, powring thereto of white wine i. measure and a them in a heate ii.
The dose is one full in the morning and as much at night.
The force of this potion is so great, that it cannot be sufficiently commended.

Take of the mice of Veruen, Betonie, Veronica ana {ounce} ii. Sinamon wateri pound, macerate them.
Take of Bole Armeniae halfe an ounce of both the Comferies ana m. i. Galingale {dram} temper them with wine as aforesaid reserue them to vse.
descriptions of potions may be made of the aforesaid simples, which leaue to the iudgeme~t of the expert Phisition notwithstanding, this one thing will adde, that the vse of them hath many oportunities to cure wounds by gun shot, as also the Canker, and all maligne, desperate, and eating of all which the Phisition shall take very great profite, if he prepare the potions with the essence of the vulnerarie simples spagerically extract, as we haue taught in an other.
FOr as much as now remaineth to declare the Spagericke preparation of those simples which pertaine to the cure of wounds by gunshot, wee will vse the same method wee haue before vsed, whereby this our treatise may be the plainer.
Distill vineger in Balneo M. and there will come forth a sweete liquor, then power on the vineger againe to distill, this do so long vntill it be no more sweete but sower, as when you powred it on first and so rise in the Limbecke.
Then distill all in a strong fire by a Retort, and there will come forth a hot oyle, the commodities whereof can scarsly be declared.
After the same maner if you will you may distill all the salt of Tartar by a Limbeck: whereof you shall make a most excellent and wholesome oyle.
Vineger being distilled by a Limbeck, the pheces remaine in the bottome of the vessell which first dryed, afterward with a violent fire if thee be driue~ out by a Retort, there wil come forth a very red and sharpe oyle, Then if you doe againe dissolue the dead head or pheces in warme water, filter, and coagulate it, the salt of vineger will rest in the bottome, the which is verie profitable for all eating vlcers.
Soote brought into fine powder, dissolued in distilled vineger in Balneo, and separating all the menstrue, that which remayneth in the bottome dissolue and coagulate againe so long till it come to a white salt, which in a moyst place will diss into oyle, very apt to cure the Gangrena and all maligne vlcers.
Bole Arinoniack made into fine powder dissolue it in the sowre fleame of Alum, then separate the fleame by Balneum and poure on other.
Doe this three times, and then the Bole will be turned into a very fatte oyle whiche with a very softe fire is dryed and brought into powder, moste apte to staunch bloud wheresoeuer it breake out.
Take of Cloues beaten in powder one pound, simple water, or Aqua Vite which is better, vi. pound, infuse them to digest in Balneo or doong dayes, then put them in a Limbecke with his Refrigatorie, distill it according to arte, and separate the oyle from the water by a funnell, and keepe it for your vse.
After the same maner shall you drawe the oyles of Sage, Iuniper, Amber, Turpentine, Myrrh, Frankensens, Sarcocolla, Maflicke and Euphorbium.
We haue written another better way to draw oyles out of the foresaid thinges in the Spagericke prepararation of medicines.
Wheate being put into a Retort with the spirite of wine, digest it viii. dayes, then distill it with a violent fire, that which is distilled poure againe vpon the dead head, digest it againe distil it againe, if you reiterate this three times, there will come forth a most excellent oyle for the Gangrena and Carcinomata.
Take of the flowers of Hipericon finall cut ii. pound, oyle of Turpentine i. pound, yeolkes of egges,

Monethes, then presse it and circulate it, and with a soft fire boyle it, vntil the liquors be consumed, there can not be found a more excellent medicine to asswage aches paines.
The iuice of the leaues and rootes of hearbes you shall purifie vntill it be cleare: powring it to so much Aqua Vite and digest it in Balneo in a glasse xv. dayes, then separated the water by distillation, and there remaineth in the bottome the slyme or mustage of the hearbes.
Steepe the leaues and rootes of hearbes in common water filtred or that which is better, in white wine eyght dayes, then let them boyle three dayes with a soft fire vnder them.
Then wring them out and purifie it, then boyle them with a soft fire, vntill they come to the thickenesse of honie which we call the slyme or muslage.
By this rule you shall drawe out of both Comferyes Cynoglosso, Centaurie, Vinca peruinca, Aristolochie, the roote of henbane and the midle bark of Tillia their muslage very profitable for the aforesaid medicines.
Out of the flowers of red Poppie or their iuice· you shall drawe a water by a Limbecke very profitable to coole.
First the vrine is to be fiitred, then coagulated, after with distilled vineger dissolued, and againe coagulated this must be reiterated, three or foure times.
Melt waxe at the fire and boyle it with wine till it be consumed: doe it so long vntill it
Take one pound of waxe thus prepared, Alum calcined halfe a pound, Sage leaues M. i. put all into a with his receiuer and distill it with a meane fire.
First, there will come forth a grose oyle, thicke, hard, white, which must be distilled againeos afore, and three times reuerated, and so you shall make an excellent oyle of ware for all griefes of the sinewes.
In like maner is the oyle of Rosen and pitch made.
Out of honnie you shall first an excellent water by Balneum, afterward you shall put vnto the dead head Or pheces that are left sand or flint stones calcined that the matter boyle not vp, which you shal driue out by a of glasse giuing fire by degrees and so you shall distill a yellowish eare oyle with a grose impure oyle.
Let all digest againe foure or fiue dayes, after distill it againe by a Limbeck in sand, and there will come out a pure red oyle swimming vpon the water.
This water is sowre almost vineger distilled, and is verie good against the Gangrena: but the oyle which burneth like Aqua Vite hath maruellous qualities specially if it be circulated certaine dayes with the spirite of wine: for the spirite being after separated, there remaineth a sweete oyle of pleasant fauour, good for wouns by Gunshot and eating vlcers.
Out of the Pheces which remaines is drawne a salt, first being calcined with a fire dissoluing it with his proper menstrua or common water distilled filtring and coagulating it three times.
This salt you shall mingle with his proper burning oyle according to arte, and you shall ape greater commoditie thereof, then is lawfull to bee spoken.
Take of honnie not separated from his waxe ii. pound, Tartar made into powder i. pound, let them putrifie together in doong xv. dayes, and distill it by a and there will first come a cleare water, then a yellowish, Put th againe vpon the dead head, and putrifie it againe other fifteene dayes, after distill it againe, and this doe three times, and you shall haue an excellent oyle of home.

So shall you make oyle of Lard and of all greases.
yolkes of Egges first sodden hard, put them into a Cucurbite, and make a fire by degrees, first there will come out a water, after a yellowish oyle swimming vppon the water, last a thicke oyle.
The water is good for all spots in the face: the oyle to appease all griefes or aches.
Boyle Creuises in water of Orpine in a double vessel wel stopped one whole day.
After distall it, powring the water three times vpon the Feces, then let it be kept it is very good for inflammations, burninges and the Carcynomata.
The sperme or seede of frogges, is gathered in the moneth of March, and is distilled by a glasse limbecke: and thereof is drawne a water verie commodious for inflamations and burninges.
Eggeshels or the shelles of snailes are reuerberated in a sharpe fire iii. dayes vntill they be brought into a verie white Calce.
But if they be sprinckled with vineger whilest they are calcined, the Calce will be the lighter and apter to worke his force.
Mercurie first washed and prepared, according to Gebers prescription, dissolue with the double waite of common strong water, then distill it foure times and poure it so often againe vpon the Feces, and so it is brought into a very red powder, out of the which beeing reuerberate at the fire are drawne away the spirites of the strong water, whiche otherwise would moue great paine.
But it were better if it were washed with the fleame of Allum vineger distilled, and the water of Egges, for by that meane, the sharpnesse is taken away.
But it is better to prepare Mercurie with often sublimations, and to fixe it beeing quickened againe and purged from his filthie earth and superfluous humiditie with the water which we haue described in the booke by me published of the Spagericke preparation.
But if all men doe not vnderstand that description for the dark wordes of Arte, it shall not be incommodious to fixe the Mercurie with common strong water three times powred on and drawne away, and to bring it into a red powder, and that with a sufficient violent fire, that all the sharpenesse and venome of the may be drawne away, which shall much the better be done if this water following be mingled with it, and by often distillation separated.
Take of distilled vineger ii. pound a halfe of the fleame of Allum i. pound and a halfe, Calxe of Eggeshels vi. ounces, distill all till it be drie.
Take of this water iii. pound, of Mercurie precipitate as afore i. pound, mingle all well according to Arte, distill it by a Limbeck powring the water againe vnto the Feces three times.
Last of all driue all out vntill it be drie, and there will remaine a powder in the bottome which grinde vpon a marble and put it into a Limbecke, powring on the water aforesaid, which you shall three times distill from the Feces as afore.
Lastly the Mercurie precipitate must be circulated with the alcole of wine
The~ distill away the spirite of wine that the matter may drie, then poure on newe againe and circulate it and distill, as afore, and that doe foure or fiue tunes, and then you haue attayned the perfect preparation of Mercurie, whose qualities cannot be sufficiently commended in the curing of sundrie diseases, specially of the Poxe, whether it be taken by mouth or applyed to the place grieued.
Make Amalgama with foure ounces of Mercurie crude, and one ounce of the best time.
Spread this vpon a plate of Iron, and set it in a moyst place, and all will dissolue into oyle, it is also made with Mercurie alone, and a plate of Time.
Mercurie as the maner is three times sublimed with salte and vitrioll, at the last is mingled with the like portion of salt Armoniacke, and againe sublimed three or foure times, all that sublimate is dissolued into oyle, out of which the spirit of the salt Armoniacke is to be drawne away, circulating all with the essence of wine and distilling it so long the oyle haue lost his heate and sharpnesse and the Armoniacke be separated.
It is also reduced by it selfe into an oyle with a verie soft heate of an Athanor by long distance of time.
Sublime Mercurie so often with the simple Calce of· egges well prepared vntill it be vtterly extinct.
To this mixture poure vineger alcolerated, that it may couer it foure fingers, distill the liquor from the Feces foure or fiue times vntill the Mercurie be come into a very red powder, whiche you shall circulate with the alcoole of wine in a Pellican eight dayes, seperate the alcoole by a Limbecke, and there will remaine in the bottome the moste pretious and sweete Balme of Mercurie.
It healeth all desperate vlcers and also carunculam in and greatly helpeth these woundes by Gunshot.
All other preparations of Mercurie and the maner of vsing it you shall gather out of the booke which we lately set forth.
Vpon the filinges of Iron often washed with salt water, poure sharpe vineger that it may couer it foure fingers, set it vpon warme ashes eight dayes euery day moouing the matter and separating the vineger which will be coloured and powring on againe newe, and that so long till the vineger be no more coloured, which being vapoured away take the powder that remayneth in the bottome, and subblime it with like portion of Armoniacke: the same subblimate you shall ret urne againe so often vppon his Feces and subblime it again vntil there appeare the colour of a Rubin: then cast all into scalding water, that the salt may dissolue them by and by put to cold water, and the Balme of Mars will rest in the bottome like the Calx of gold.
Poure away the water and put to freshe againe that the Balme may be made sweete.
Of this with the spirit of wine alcolizat by circulations, you shall make a red oyle most excellent for all inward Hemerodes or issues of bloud, and to strengthen the bowels if one drop be mixed with conserue of Roses or Comferie or giueu with wine.
The filinges of Iron first well washed, you shall calcine with the flower of Sulphure or dissolue with strong water, then poure on very sharpe vineger, and set it on a warme place certain dayes, then reuerberate it with an open fire, as Arte commaundeth, one whole day gathering alwaies the flowres which remaine aboue, vntill all be conuerted into a very red and light powder.
After the same maner, you shall make the Balme, oyle and Crocus of Copper, out of the which, with the sowre fleame of vitrioll, circulating all artificially, you shall draw a blewshing vitrioll whose qualities we haue described in another place.
Out of Saturne calcined is drawne a sweetish salt in Balneo with distilled vineger powring it so often vppon the Feces vntill it draw no more.
The menstrew euaporated, the salt remayneth in the bottome which by often dissolutions and coagulations is made Christaline: and afterward easily dissolued into oyle being set in a moyst place.
But if you circulate this Christaline salt in a Pellin with the alcoole of wine
dayes, and after take away the menstrew by distillation, and put to new wine, and circulate it to a fit dose of christaline salte of Tartar, you shall make a Balme sweeter then sugar, which wil marueilously preuaile against all maligne vlcers and diseases of the eyes.
Decoct Antimonie made in powder with a capitall lye prepared of Tartar calcined, and Sope ashes and quicklime, the space of one houre, then let it coole, pouring vpon it a little Vineger, and there will appeare a certaine rednesse swimming vpon: which you shall gather: then againe let it boyle for one houre or two: againe let it coole and gather that which swimmeth vp. Doe this so often vntill there appeare no more rednesse.
For it is the sulphure of Antimonie whiche dried at a softe fire, you shall keepe to good vses.
Mingle Antimonie with sugar and alum, and put all into a Retort of glasse: make a soft fire for foure or fiue houres, afterward increase it, and there will come out an oyle red like bloud: It is also done with Mercurie sublimate: but great heede is to be taken least anie error be committed in the degree of fire.
Boyle sulphure prepared with oyle of Lynseede with a verie soft fire, and it will be like bloud congealed.
Let the matter coole, put it into a Retort and giue it fire, and there will distill out of a verie red oyle of sulphure.
It is also done, if you mingle bran with your sulphure and distill it.
Take of sulphure Viue P. i. with which mingle with a soft fire, so much pure vitrioll molten that it may be one body.
Distill this by a discensorie, and there will descend a red oyle· into the receiuer.
If one pound of the flower of sulphure be mixed with two or three pound of oyle of Turpentine in a drye heate, the flowres will dissolue into a red oyle.
Then the menstrew rightly and artificially separated, circulate the Rubin of sulphure with the Alcoll of wine eight dayes, and you shall haue oyle of sulphure that hath the qualities of the naturall Balme.
The sowre oyle of sulphure, is made of sulphure by setting it on fire, and hanging ouer it a Bell or a large glasse head, to keepe the vapours which are conuerted into that sowre oyle.
Put vitrioll beaten into powder into a Cucurbite giuing it a fire of the second degree, and there will issue a sowre water which is called the fleame of vitrioll.
Take the Feces which remaine in the bottome of the vessell which is called Colcothar, stampe that, and if you mingle flintes with all with a violent fire, there will come out a red oile.
It is also made with the simple Colcothar driuen out with a violent fire three dayes space, and will come forth a verie hot oile, which is made sweete by circulation with the of wine Tartarizated.
But if the Colcothar be dissolued in warme water, and the rednesse in it separated, and the water euaporated, the Colcothar will remaine sweetish: that which remaineth, the rednesse being taken away is called Creta Vitrioli.
But if Vitrioll be drawne by the ninth a Limbeck powring on alwayes the liquor vpon the dead head, and after circulating all by the space of eight dayes.
You shall haue the spirit of Vitrioll verie profitable for many things.
The fleame of Allum is made like the fleame of Vitrioll.
But Allum is prepared if the fleame be fiue times powred vpon the Feces, out of which it was drawne and distilled: last of all driue out all the fleame vntill it be drie. Make brine of salt, into which cast hot burning stones, that they may be imbybbed, those stones so imbybbed, put into a Retort, giuing fire by degrees, there will come forth a very hot oyle of salt.
said before, that there was great force in Butyro Arsenici fixo, to cure all venemous and maligne vlcers, it is made in this manner.
Mingle Christaline Arsenick first subblimed with onely Colcothar (which doth keepe backe his poison) with like waight of salt of Tartar and salt Peter, put al into two glasses, and fixe it, giuing fire the space of xxiiii. houres, first very gentle, then of the highest degree.
You shall finde the matter very white fixed, resembling the colour of Peerles, which dissolue in warme water that you may draw the Alcoly from it.
And the powder which remaineth unbybbe with oile of Tartar, or of Talcum, which is better, drie it at the fire, and do this thrise.
Againe dissolue the matter in warme water that you may take away his salt, and there will remaine a very white pouder and fixed, which will dissolue in a moist place into a fate oile, which is anodinum like butter.
Out of Talcum rightly and artificially calcined, is drawne the spirite with distilled vinegar.
This is dissolued into a precious oyle being set in a moist place.
Take of the iuice of Aristolochia Rotundae, and Sanin, ana {ounce}iiii.
Serpentariae ii. ounces, spirit of wine one pound, circulate them first the space of xxiiii. houres, then distill them, of this water take one pound of elect Magnes made into pouder iiii. ounces, circulate them togither, and distill away the water from the Feces, reiterate this three times, and by this meanes you shall obtaine the preparation of Magnes.
But because (as we haue said) ye noblest parts are to be strengthned, and the heart the principall organ of life, must alway be defended, these preparations following are to be vsed.
Take of Theriacae of Alexandriae ii. ounces and a halfe, the best Myrrhe i. ounce and a halfe, Saffron ii. drams, the spirite of wine vi. ounces, mingle all these, and in ashes with a very soft fire distill it, circulate that which is distilled in Balned eight dayes, and then distill it againe.
This water hath a excellent qualitie against the plague and al venemous things, and doth maruellously strengthen the heart.
We haue shewed the extraction of the Tincture of golde, Corals, naturall Balme, and the essence of Perle in the booke which wrote of preparation: now resteth for vs to speake of the golde of life, which all shall know to be the most excellent and extreame medicine in cuting all diseases, which do but consider the singular excellencie of gold in the cure of the leprosie.
Aurum vitae is made many wayes, for being calcined after the Spagerick manner it is made light and spungcous, which cannot be reduced again, from which with distilled vinegar it is drawn the salt in Balneo, whose qualities by circulations with the spirit of wine are so increased, that they seeme to be incredible for the curing of innumerable diseases.
Calcine gold made into thinne plates so oft with salt preparate (by a Philosophicall calcination) vntill it be made vnpalpable, the salt by dissolutions being seperated from the Alcoole of gold, then calcine it againe with very white sugred salt, and to this mixture powre of the spirite of wine alcolyzat with his proper salt.
According to the precepts of arte that it may couer it ouer onely foure fingers, then set on fire that the alcooll may burne: and this you shall do oftentimes, then powre on new alcooll of wine, and circulate all rightly and decently the space of foure dayes.
Then separate the menstrew with compotent distillation, and powre on new againe, circulating and distilling as you did before, so often vntill all the substance of golde bee carried out of the Limbecke: The menstrewe being separated as it ought, the golde of life will remaine in the bottome, the most excellent and best of all secretes.

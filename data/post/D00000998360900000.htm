THE SEDVCTION of Arthington by Hacket especiallie, with some tokens of his vnfained repentance and Submission.
Written by the said Henrie Arthington, the third person, in that wofull Tragedie.
The face of the Lorde is against them that do euill, to cut off their remembrance from the earth.
But when the Righteous crie, the Lord heareth them, and deliuereth them out of all their troubles.
Malice shall slaie the wicked, and they that hate the righteous shal perish.
But the Lord redeemeth the soules of his seruants, and none that truste in him shall perish.

Heervnto is added certaine meditations in Meter, which the sayd Henrie Arthington penned in prison, since his inlargement.
To the Right Honourable, the Lords and the rest of her Maiesties most Honourable priuie Councell, increase of all graces and blessings needfull. etc..
IT may be deemed an intollerable pride in a poor prisoner (my verie good Lordes, etc.:) to presume to write vnto your Honours after this manner, during the time of my restrainte, (Namelie being (as am) a man without credit, hauing not as yet her Maiesties pardon: but if my case be dulie considered (as nothing doubt but it is with your Honours) howe that my trespasse being great, mine offence publike, and my fact preiudiciall to the whole common wealth: there is none (saue such as are deuoid of reason) but will allow it to be my bounden dutie, to pen and publish my vnfeined repentance, so soone as my libertie woulde permit: There hath not as yet three weekes ouerpassed, since the same by your Honours was granted vnto mee (for the free vse of the prison onelie) during the which time haue added my indeuor,
uor (the Lorde bearing witnesse, with a single heart) to set downe the storie of my fearefull fall, that all others (if possible) might by my example be warned betimes to foresee and preuent the practises of satan, who seeketh by all meanes to bring men to destruction, as by this discourse shall more plainly appeare, which being now finished (by Gods good direction) could not bethinke me vnto whome more fitly to dedicate the same, then vnto your H. and that for two respectes: The former: that next to her Maiestie, hauing more deeply trespassed against your H. then any other men, should labour to be reconciled into your fauours, before others.
The latter, that hauing found more fauour at your H. hands, then euer did anie, (my case well considered) both reason, conscience, and duty requireth, that your H. should receiue the first fruites or testimonie of my true repentance, because in hope thereof you extended your fauor, eue to spare his life, that iudged himselfe most worthie of death, and still doe from the bottome of my heart, for so deepely dishonouring my fauiour Christ Iesus, and so greatly abusing her Maiestie, your H. and all Christian people: But as Dauid saith in the
and he forgaue the iniquitie of my sinnes: Euen so hath it falne out with my vnworthie self, still liue in hope to receiue more mercie, that the same God will moue the heart of my souereigne, to
grant her gratious free pardon also, to so wofull a wretch as sueth for the same continually, vpon the bowed knees of my heart and soule, expecting dayly to heare good newes thereof: That both and all my friendes may haue the greater cause to pray for her Maiestie, and all your H. That her highnesse may long reign, and your H. rule ouer vs, with much increase of glorie to God, of renown to her Maiestie, of honor to your persons, of comfort to the true subiect, and either of conuersion or confusion to all traitors, which the Almightie grant: that his gospell may florish, and this Iland abound, with all wished peace, prosperitie and comfort, to the good example of all other kingdomes: So be it in Christ.
To the vvell disposed Reader, The peace of a good Conscience.
CHri&stian Reader, am to giue thee to vnderstand, that the Epistle before, and the booke following, were both perused and allowed by authoritie: and after sent mee agayne to examine, that might see and testifie what vpright dealing found therein.
In verie trueth, finde nothing in substance added to the originall, but certaine wordes and sentences changed for the better.
The rest (I protest) is mine owne doinges, as was directed by the spirite of God: concerning the which worke, doe onely craue thus much: that thou wilt take some time to peruse the same, And if God perswade thy hart, that haue delt faithfully in displaying hys mercies and mine owne vnworthines; that thou wilt not forget to sound out his praises, and further to intreate hys almightie Maiestie, euen still to preserue hys vnworthiest seruaunt, that my life and deathe may redound to hys glorie so much as is possible, by giuing foorth testimonies of vnseyned repentance, dayly more and more.
spare and prolong my life, concluding with this worthie sentence of saint Paule, (which may with comfort and a good conscience iustifie, so long as liue) viz.
That Christ Iesus came into this world to saue sinners, of whome, (I am chiefe) beseeching his goodnesse, that (as my fearefull fall, may be a warning to all people, to beware and auoyd the practises of Satan So my true repentance may giue a good example for euerie one to imitate.
And so commend thy desires and indeuours vnto his moste gratious direction and blessing, who is able and willing to helpe all suche as call vppon his name in spirite, and in trueth, Amen.
Thy poore welwiller, vnworthy the name of thy brother in Christ.
BE it knowne to al Christian people, of what condition or callinge soeuer, that (Henry Arthington prisoner) for my dangerous offence committed in proclaiming Hacket to bee Christ Iesus, etc..
Haue longe desired and from my heart requested, to shewe some testimonies of my vnfeined repentance, either by word or writinge, but could not be admitted till of late, that the libertie of the prisonne was granted vnto mee: Heare now therfore with patience my humble confession in manner following.
As it cannot be denied, which Peter the Apostle, hath recorded that Satan the old wie of Mankind seeketh
cotinually like a roring Lion whom he may deuoure: So it must needs be granted of all, which the Apostle Paule noteth, That to the end he may the more easille deceiue, Satan transformeth himselfe
the woma~ in Paradise, so did he abuse Saule the King, in the likenesse of
Samuel the Prophet of God, and so did hee of late most pitifullie misvse Coppinger and mee, in the likenesse of the holiest manne liuing in the world, closelie represented before our eies, in the person of that wicked Sorcerer William Hacket the instrument of Satan, or rather himselfe a diuell incarnate, raised vp to seeke the dishonor of Christ Iesus, and both our destructions so much as he could: As by the true report of his storie ensuing shall more manifestlye appeare.
In the discourse whereof, though muste of necessitie blaze abroad mine owne infamie to all posterities, yet hadde rather doo the same to detect Satans practises, that others might be admonished in time to take heede, then that anie manner of personne should through my silence (in concealing that knowledge which haue gained by my wofull experience) fall into that pit of endlesse peridition, by Satans temptations; out of the which (by Gods Almightie prouidence) am escaped.
It is not vnknowne throughout all England, there were two false Prophets set on worke in London, to proclaime that Christ Iesus was come to iudge the world with his fan in his handes, Hacket that curssed condemned wretche, was that supposed Christ Iesus the Iudge, Edmunde Coppinger the one prophet, and the other, The one of mercie, the other of iudgements falslie so tearmed: Three vnlikelie instruments to effect
so great matters as were pretended, viz: either to bring all men vnto repentance, or else to iudge and condemne the obstinate.
How my brother false prophet and I, behaued our selues in Cheapside,
etc.. running bothe into one Cart, to proclaime our curssed newe Iudge, etc.: Because the maner therof was commonlie known, and that suppose the Chronicler of this land, hath long before this time discoursed more at large vpon our whole proceedings, meane not to trouble thee gentle Reader with new repetitions, but onely to dilate of the greatnesse of our sins, with the manner how my selfe was drawne into this action, wherein hope to supplie more fullie, whatsoeuer the Chronicler hath lefte vntouched, for wante of true notice.
First therefore, will indeuour to the vttermoste of my skill, co describe the greatnesse of Hackets rebellion against the Lord Iesus.
Secondly, what meanes he vsed to bewitch my poor selfe to be one of those false prophets.
Thirdlie, to consider howe deepelie, have trespassed in proclaiming the villaine, to bee Christ Iesus the Iudge, and other wise also.
Fourthlie, to obserue notwithstanding, the exceeding greatnesse of Gods Almightie prouidence, in my preseruation.
Fiftlie, To set downe thesubstance of that Christian to passion, which haue found at the hands of hir excellent Maiesty, most honorable
Sixtly, To moue all manner people to bee thankfull vnto God on my behalfe, and further to assist me with their praiers, that my preseruation may tende to his glorie, and the good of his Church.
Seuenthlie, To admonish all people (by my wofull example to take heede and beware of Satans temptations.
To come to the first point, concerning Hackets wilfull rebellion against the Lord Iesus: can deem it no lesse (in my poore iudgement) Then to be a deep sinne against the
which may bee the more plainelie discerned, both by comparing it with the sinne against the (according to the Scripture) And with the like fact committed by Iudas, in betraieng Christ Iesus the Lord of life himselfe.
The sinne of the Holy ghost as it is defined by Peter and Paule the Apostles of Christ;
Is wilfull sinning against the knowne truth, and a mans owne conscience, making a mocke thereof Which may be the more aggrauated, By spitefull reproching the said knowne truth, in contempt of Christ Iesus the Author thereof.
Oh then how groslie and greeuouslie maye it be feared that Hacket did commit this great sinne against the Holy ghost, not onely in Wilfull proceeding againste the knowne truth and his owne conscience, but in obstinate rebelling against the very person and office of Christ
Iesus, (peculiar onely to the euerlasting Sonne of God in heauen) by causing and compelling vs poore soules (for so wee were inforced by a Deuilish spirit within vs) amongst other things to proclaime him) Christ Iesus, the Iudge of the world.
Which purpose he had in heart before, as apeareth by giuing vs in charge to proclaim him, etc..
Whose sinne is heereby the more inlarged, by the hardnesse of his heart, that coulde not in mans iudgement repent at his latter end, nor so much as vtter one Word to that ende: for if such as refuse the knowledge of God, and hare to be guided by his holy counsels, shal not find mercy at their latter ends
(though they beg hard for the same with teares) as the Scripture dooth record: then, how feareful is his case, That at his last end was so farre off from asking pardon (being moued therevnto vpon the ladder) that euan then he fell to banning and cursing, vttering these or such like speaches.
If ther be a God in Heauen, hee will either ridde mee out of these villaines handes, or else will pull him out of his throne, within one moneth destroy this Cittie with fire and Brimstone.
moste abhominable and blasphemous wretch, who durst haue once vttered such horrible speeches, but he that had soulde his soule to Satan.
Behold yet more testimonie of the greatnesse of his sinne (I feare) against the Holy ghost, which exceeded Iudas in three respects.
First, Hacket rebelliouslie tooke vppon him, the titles, person, and office of Christ Iesus, but Iudas durst neuer presume so high.
Secondly, Hacket exalted himselfe aboue the Lord lesus, for wheras Christ Iesus, had onlie but one Prophet to go before his face, Iohn Baptist by name) Hacket had two, but Iudas none at all.
Thirdlie, Hacket did neither repent, nor yet confesse his sinnes before his death, but Iudas did both
Wherefore it appeareth most euidentlie, that in these respects before mentioned, Hacket was a greater sinner then Iudas, yea the greatest sinner that euer was heard of since the worlde begun, who no doubt if he hadde beene in Iudas roome, (and his power answereable to his desire) woulde himselfe haue killed the Lord of glorie, as might appeare by his afore noted most horrible speeches vpon the ladder.
Wherfore as his end was the most fearefull and desperate that euer was red of, so (if indeed he repented not) it may greatlie bee feared his torments are most greeuous, of any that euer were condemned, (euen by the most powerfull and vpright doome, of that eternall and Almightie Iudge, whose office he sought to vsurpe in this world.)
And heere an end of him, though his paines happilie bee endlesse, for his pride and presumption against the Lord Iesus, after the example of his Lucifer, whoe was banished heauen, and made prince
Touching Coppingers death and temptations, (by report of himselfe) hee had chambered in bed with Hacket, wherby gather that (by gods permission) the Sorcerer did more deepelie inchant him, to be a meanes to take away his life.
As for his death maister Yoong told me, that before his end he detested Hacket and asked pardon of the almightie, whoe no doubt receiued him to mercie, for so hath he promised, that at what time soeuer a sinner repenteth from the bottome of his heart, he will put al
And so an ende of his story also, not minding to speake any further of either, then as shall necessarilie fall out, within the compasse of mine own Pageant.
To come to speake of mine owne storie, how was drawn to become a Stager in this fearfull Tragedie: it is holden of diuers both godlie learned,
that albeit Satan haue many waiees to abuse all people: yet hath he two chiefe and esspeciall means to seduce the simple; the one, if men feare him, the other if they trust him.
Touching the former (albeit haue beene a verie grieuous sinner manifold waies) yet since came to the knoweledge of the truthe, That Christ Iesus only hath conquered Satan, death, hell and damnation;
and that by faith in him, hee hath made vs also more then conquerours, did neuer feare the mallice of vile Satan, no not euen then when was his
In the latter point therefore was ouertaken, viz. in crediting Hacket the instrumente of Satan to be so honest a man, whervnto was drawne by six likely reasons.
First, by the good reporte that was giuen of him.
Fiftlie, In feeling my selfe possest with a burning heat within.
Sixtlie, By maister Coppingers report of his vision from heauen, that wee were both Prophets, and Hacket greater.
And firste, concerning the report that was made of Hacket to be so honest,
(whoe nowe know, was a more wicked wretch, then either Simon or Elimas those notable forcerers, mentioned in the Acts.)
About Easter terme laste, the said maister Coppinger sent for mee to come vnto him at a friends house in London, where (by his meanes) must needes be acquainted with this goodly guest, which was the first time that euer knew him, where he kept the Table talke against Papists and Seminaries, how dangerous they were to the Queene and State: vpon which occasion one personne in companye saide he was welcome, bicause the party tooke
him to be an honest man, If be not honester then you take me (quoth Hacket The Lord confound me.
Which speech noted, and deemed most dangerous, but hauing no time then to admonish him thereof, soone after dinner departed, and did see my companion no more till Trinitie Tearme following, being that vacation time in Yorkeshire, about mine owne particular occasions, (as hundreths can witnesse if need required) during the which space (as was informed afterwards) master Coppinger and Hacket had begun their Tragedie, and did write certaine letters to great estates, to detect pretended Traitors against hir Maiestie: The copies whereof were afterwards found in Hackets Chamber, the same day we rose and were carried thinke to hir Maiesties Councell.
After my businesse doone in the Countrey, returned againe to London, about the middest of Trinitie Tearme: to dispatch certaine causes of mine owne and my friendes, and for obtayning the great Seale of England for the foundation of a Free Schoole at Wakefield, according to hir Maiesties grant.
So soone as was knowne to bee in the Cittie, maister Coppinger comes vnto my Chamber, and begins to tell me (after salutations) that he was in my abse~ce become well acquainted with the holiest man that euer was borne, Christ Iesus excepted) hee durst boldly auouch it before whome soeuer.
confident protestations) gaue small regard at the first, (because had him not long before, to be farre ouer reached with his owne affections in matters of loue, building to much vpon vncertainties, and in some other pointes, (needlesse heer to be stood vpon) but continued willing to ioyne with him still in our old exercise, vizd: to keepe a priuate fast vpon euery Lords day, for some speciall causes best known to our selues, choosing that day commonly, the better to be furthered by publike exercises; keepping M. Gardiners, and M. Coopers Lectures for the most part, to visit mistresse in the meane space, who hath beene longe and greeuouslie afflicted.
Vpon the Lordes day (about one fortnight before our arising) when the afternoone exercise was finished, maister Coppinger would needs draw me to Hackets chamber, whither immediatlie he resorted (as himselfe saide) from M. Edgertons Lecture: and foorthwith begun to pray, vsing as good words as any other Christian yet denouncing the Former cursse against himselfe,
if he sought not the honour of Iesus Christ simplie.
The varlet (as since coniecture) meaning himselfe, and in charitie iudging the best, that he meant indeed the Lord Iesus in heauen.
After praiers ended with some renuing of our first acquaintance at Easter Tearme before, we parted companie for that time, beeing then returned vnto mine owne chamber, and meditating
about the curssing of himselfe if he sought not singlie the honour of Christ Iesus: did resolue, that he must either be a wicked man wilfullie to condemne himselfe, if his hearte were not vpright, or else he was a verie rare man, and tendered the honour of Christ Iesus highlie: and (as in Charitie could not but hope the best) So maister Coppingers wordes beganne to settle with me,
Thus did make the first way for the wretched Caytise to assault me, who knowing my good opinion of him by maister Coppinger, the next time that he had intercourse between vs, Hacket ceased not to moue him to drawe mee the second time into his companie: and that was by making me acquainted with, their proceedinges in my absence; for about two or three daies after, comes maister; Coppinger vnto my chamber, and brings with him a packet of writings, which must needes be made priuie vnto, but refused at the first, and said would not enter into their secrets, yet after that maister Coppinger told me, they were only copies of certaine letters which they two had written and sent alreadye to some of great account about the Court, for the detection of supposed Traitours, vnto the Queene and State: Then thought there could be no danger at all in pervsing of them: wherin when see them so bolde, as to name the personnes suspected, and to auouche theyr accusasions vpon the hazzard perrill of their
owne liues, deemed neither of them so mad, or deuoide of grace, or carelesse of their owne estate, (maister Coppinger being sworne to her Maiesties seruice) so hotly to prosecute so dangerous a sute, which must either turne to their owne, or their betters destruction: but that they could iustifie what they had written: and so gaue the rather credit vnto them,
which was the second meanes for Satan to assault me.
After this time was the more willing to frequent Hackets companie (as a manne whome thought true hearted to hir Maiestie) who then discoursed vnto me at large, what troubles and afflictions he had indured at the handes of Papists for the Gospels sake: all to make mee beleeue he was single minded that way,
sought the honour of Iesus, no man more: which was the easlier perswaded to grant, by his holye exercises and conuersation (which were all Saint like,
whilst was with him) complaining much of the iniquitie of the time: that Religion was prophaned of all sortes of people, by a generall infection of sinne in all places, which could not but procure some plague vpon the lande, without speedie repentance, wherevnto condiscended, and further to credite him, which was the third way for him to seduce me.
Shortlie after, maister Coppinger comes again vnto my chamber, and brings other writinges penned by himselfe from Hackets own mouth, which was the discourse of those supposed intollerable
torments, which the villaine persuaded him he hadde indured for the triall of the Gospell to be the true religion, against Poperie and all other sectes and Heresies: And for the preseruation of our Deere Soueraigne,
and al other Princes professing the Gospell; M. Coppinger assuring me, that for the outward torments they would be iustified, by an hundred good witnesses, if need required: vizd, That Hacket should be tied the first time twentie daies vpon a bed, his armes and legs to the foure corners, and beate with a cudgell: The seconde time, bounde twentie daies with Iron chaines, and cast into a vpon his backe, and swinged dailie with birchen roddes: and the thirde time, bound other twentie daies vpon a bed againe, in his owne dung and vrine (with reuerence be it spoken) and whipped dailye with a dogge whippe: during all which times (as the storie imported) The Pope, the King of Spaine all other Princes,
that were enimies to the gospell, (vppon a certaine cursse that Hacket hadde made God to confounde him, if it were not the true Religion had raised vp all sortes of witches, inchanters, Sorcerers and Coniurers in all kingdomes, to practise vpon his bodie and soule by all kinde of tormentes, either to make him renounce the Gospell, or else to destroy him: vpon condition that if he indured constant with his life, they would all yeeld vnto the Gospell, (as the true religion only) and make him chief
kinge ouer all Europe, all other kings to holde their crownes of him.
Nowe the report of Hackets outwarde torments appearing so strange, and the storye so certaine (by maister Coppingers testimonie) as he said from a prencher of the Gospell, etc.; was not only induced to credite the same, but to resolue further, that the effects for Hacket to become the King of Europe, and to reforme religion were likelie to follow: for considered that neither could such great torments bee indured,
either of soule or bodie as was mentioned without special assistance from God or Satan, (little suspecting he was a satanist neyther yet ouerpassing the same with life, but needs he must be deare vnto God, and preserued to some good vse in the church: for nothing doubted of the trouth of the story, because besides M. Cappinger report, there was diuers great witnesses named therein: By all which meanes aforsaid, gaue the villaine interest to infuse his curssed filthie spirit into me in manner following,
The last Lordes day before our arising, wee all concluded to keepe a priuate mayster Coppinger and frequenting our olde exercises, and left Hacket at mistris Honiwoods in the mean space, who said the wicked spirit Satan, was fled into hir only for a refuge, but she shoulde be dispossest of him shortlle: where the villain praied, that the same wicked spirit might be giuen vnto him, maister Coppinger and thinking
he did so in good will to the woman, as one pitieng her wofull estate,
and able to cast him out at his pleasure: hauing indured so muche before.
Then wee all returned to Hackets chamber, where we finished our said exercise by praier in course: when the ssme came to my poore turn considering the supposed intended treasons (as you haue hearde before) did to the vttermost of my abilitie, intreat for her Maiesties safe preseruation; (as the secret searcher of all harts knoweth) and so did maister Coppinger, which the Traitor perceyuing, the next time himselfe did pray for her Maiestie,
and that with great affection as seemed to vs: after all doone, he imbraced me in his armes, protesting that he tendered the safetie of her Maiestie euerye waie, (as much as either M. Coppinger or did:) at the which instant thinke was filled with Satans spirit, for before we departed, felt my selfe verie hot within, which verelie then thought had beene an extraordinarie motion of the (as Christs Disciples hadde going to Emaus;
which the Lord had sent downe as a blessing of his loue vpon our exercise, so departed a very glad man,
The nexte night following as laie in my bed, found my selfe moued to pen a curssed Prophesie against the citty of London, Curssed cal it, both in respect of the autor (the spirit of Satan in mee:) and in regard of the matter, for
And because was not therevnto called by the Lord (though my intention to bring all people to repentance were neuer so holy) for the minde and knowledge with a lawfull calling,
But before durst presume to goe about so waightie a businesse; needs must goe to Hackets chamber to haue his direction in the matter, who persuaded me easilie, that was mooued therevnto,
by the very spirite of the Lorde Iesus: (The villaine doubt meaning himselfe) And therevpon kneeling in his shirt vppon the bed, praieng for the blessing of Gods holy spirit to direct and prosper my trauell and labors, and after gaue me very good councell, not to relie vpon mine owne knowledge, but to depend for direction from aboue, for the Lorde Iesus whose cause it was,
would not faile to affist mee therein and minister sufficient matter vnto me (especially against all hypocrits) who~ he auouched the greatest sinners in all England and the moste dangerous enimies both to religion and to the state.
Then returned vnto my chamber, where (as the Lord knoweth) prosecuted that work with watered plantes,
that sinfull wretche, should denounce so heauie and fearfull judgements, against that great citty which loued so dearly, euen for the exercises of the word therin, fearing (or rather expecting the euent, with
out speedie repentance) which did finssh and had twise written it ouer, before the wednesday at night following.
Wherein remember that euen then (with a good conscience) set down my selfe, to be the greatest sinner, etc.: Oh how true hath it since falne out.
During the which aforesaid space, vizd: betweene the Monday and the Thursday: maister Coppinger had penned the story of Hackets torments in a more ample maner, the which the villaine was verye desirous should accompanie prophesie, (which wee meant out of hand to haue put into print) that must needs sit vp all Thursday at night to write it fairer againste the morning,
which perfourmed without any wearinesse or desire to sleep, hauing waked almost the whole night before.
In the morning which was the same Fridaie we arose maister Coppinger and met at Hackets Chamber about eight of the clock, the beastly Epicure lieng then in his bed, where M. Coppinger (after a solemne sort) began to declare what manner men we were, viz: That it was shewed him by vision from Heauen, that himselfe was indued with the spirit of the Father; to bee the greatest and laste prophet of Mercie,
that euer was or shoulde bee in the worlde: and that was the laste and greatest Prophet of Iudgementes, that euer was or should be: both of vs indued not onely with Propheticall, but also with Angellicall spirites, and shoulde separate betweene the sheep and the Goates before the
Lord Iesus at the last day: as for Hacket hee was greater then either of vs, and that we were appointed to attend vpon his perso~, in this world, wherevppon gathered and then fullie beleeued that he should indeed be the king of all Europe as his storie imported but not once dreaming, neither as yet heard any speeches that he durst take vppon him the title and office of the Lord Iesus: which nowe followeth in order to speake of.
After he had thus brought vs out of order to abuse vs at his pleasure: M. Coppinger hauing ended his speeches of our callinges, we both kneeled downe at the beds feet to praye: where M. Coppinger began, and standing somewhat vpon his vnworthines and great vnfitnes for so high an office: The villaine Hacket start out of his bed, and interrupted M. Coppinger, (himself praieng at the beds side in his shirt only) that the honor of Christ Iesus might bee aduanced,
meaning himselfe, (but we the Lorde in Heauen) Then he skipt into bed againe, M. Coppinger still going on with his owne vnworthinesse, etc.: which the beast perceiuing, hee came the second time out of the bed, prayeng as before in effect, and that wee might haue regard to honor Christ Iesus: meaning still himselfe, (but we the Lord in Heauen) and after slipt into bed againe, mayster Coppinger still going on with his praier, which my selfe the next time interrupted, for seeing Hacket twise before to arise and pray so earnestlie for the honour of Iesus,
was inforced through the spirit of Satan within me, to bid my new fellow Prophet arise, and annoint the King with the
Wherevpon M. Coppinger arose immediatly, kissing both his hands three times,
fel downe flat vpon his face three times also, and kiste the chamber boords vnder his feet, and after (with lowe obeisance) put foorth his arme towardes Hackets beddes head, whoe foorth with clasped hands with him, and said you shall not need to annoint me with the for was annointed by the himselfe when was in Heauen (as his storie imported.)
Then answered Coppinger what is your Maiesties pleasure to be doone.
You are both the Lords prophetes said the villaine, Goe your way therefore in his name into the Cittie, and proclaime that Christ Iesus is come to iudge the world with his fan in his handes,
and if the people aske where hee is, you may tell them am he, and where am, and if they will not beleeue you, bid them come kil me if they can: your Maiesties pleasure shall bee done quoth Coppin and down the staires he goeth, who~ Arthington followed in such hast, that assure you left my gloues behind me (so smal time had to think of the matter.)
But before got downe the staires, my fellowe false prophet had proclaimed news from Heauen, that Ch. Iesus was come to iudge the worlde, etc., At what time was co~pelled in spite of my hart, to tune the same note: we both going beyond our co~mission; hee crieng repent, and mercy; and repent,
or Iudgement is at hande: which the Lord knoweth wroong many salt teares out of my poore eies, for feare of the euent vpon the whole Cittie.
After we had thus plaid our pagent in Cheap, and had so monstrouslie abused the Lorde Iesus in Heauen, by proclaiming an vsurper of his office in earth,
giuinge further exceeding great offence, against hir Excellent Maiestie, hir Honourable Councell, and all Christian people, we were all shortlie after clapt faste in close prisons seuerally: there to bethink our selues what answer to make when we should bee called to giue an accou~t of our proceedings: since which time did neuer see either of my companions, but the Wednesday after, at Sherife Brooks house as suppose, where coulde not for my life reframe, but kneele downe to Hacket (before some of the Councell) And bid God saue the king of Europe: thinking still in my minde hee had beene so indeed: neither could bee discharged either of his wicked spirite,
or to take him for the speciall adopted sonne of GOD, Christ Iesus in earth, to represent the personne of, Christ Iesus in Heauen, so longe as the breath was in the villaines breast: but as Iohn the Baptist was the of Christes firste comming, to bring repentance vnto Saluation: so deemed Hacket to be the forerunner of Christs second comming, to prepare his Iudgementes against all such persons as would not repent.
If any should demande, why did not discouer Hackets intended villainous practises against the Queene and state: (seeing hee was knowne to be a Sorcerer,
Truly (as meane to be saued at the last daye) both those matters were vnknowne to me so long as he liued,
(and to maister Coppinger also as thinke) Neither was euer anye further acquainted, with any sightes, visions or speeches towching these matters, then as before in substance is declared: but as heard by maister Yoong, since his death, etc.: Therefore as on the one side, should deepelie offend the Maiestie of God, if shoulde conceale any danger intended against hir Maiestie,
So should displease the Lord on the other side, by speaking more then truth of any, yea if it were of the Deuill himselfe Protesting thus much in the presence of God, that if were priuie to one euill worde (other then haue reuealed) spoken againste her Maiestie, by my selfe or the dearest friende that haue, if should not discouer it to hir Highnes Councell, and put them or my selfe in hir Maiesties mercy: should thinke my selfe vnworthie of any mercy, either at God or hir Maiesties hands.
What fauour the Lord hath made me finde of hir Highnesse, and her Honourable Councell, since did reueale the worst againste my
selfe, shall appeare more plainelie (GOD willing) heereafter, when come to speake there of in particulers.
In the meane time, howe demeaned my selfe, from the day of our arising, till the verie houre of Hackets execution, diuers of good credit that heard my poore praiers,
can truly witnesse, howe continuallie besought the Almightie, that he woulde bring shame and destruction vppon vs all three or any of vs, If we did Wilfullie seeke,
either the dishonour of Christ Iesus in heauen, or the hurt of his annointed Queene Elizabeth in Earth, which the Villaine perceiuing, and that he could not inforce me to praye for Gods vengeance to fall vppon the Cittie, when hee knewe himselfe condemned to die.
Then he sought to bee reuenged vppon my person: by accusing mee to maister Yoong,
to be the chiefe Conspirator, and so to bring me into like daunger: but the Lord that knewe my heart (though were greatlie misled) hee did preserue mee from all extremyties.
The night before hee was to be executed, hee sette his wicked Spirite so on worke within me, to pray for vengeance to consume the Cittie, that for one howre at the least about Mydnight, prayed so lowd, that awaked moste of the Prisoners in the house, But as Balaam being hired to cursse God people, did notwithstanding
rather to praye for them and against their enimies, which am sure, did sooner helpe to set the villaine into hel, then hurt the Citty of London, for thus praied all the said space, Lorde, when thou wilt, save thine elect, confound thine enimies.
And truely the spirite carried my minde throughout all the world, yea into Gods secret predestination and reprobation, to saue his Elect and confounde his enimies: in the which praier continued so long, till the Master of the priso~ came vp to threate~ me harder restraint, if wold not cease from disquieting the houshold.
The next daye vpon which Hacket was executed, was compelled to bee more instant in praier then before: but still kepte within one compasse,
that if any of vs did Wilfullie intende dishonour to Christ Iesus, or hurt to Queene Elizabeth, shame and confusion might couer their faces.
About the height of the day, my nexte neighbor prisoners hauing intelligece that Hacket was hangd, they gaue me notice therof thorow the dore, what a desperate end he made.
Then said he was no man sure, but a Deuill incarnate, appearing to me as an angel of light.
And suddenlie felt my selfe quite dispossest of that hot spirit; and of all those grosse and palpable errors which held so confidently in his life time, thinking indeed had not oftended: Euen so good was God to his poore and sinful seruant, that knowing me to bee so subtlelye seduced by the mallice of Satan, as to abuse my
vnderstanding knowledge, and memorie, volens, to sin so fearefully, that now humbling my selfe truely before his presence, and expostulating with his mercifull Maiestie, whether was Reprobate, or no: presentlie the Holy ghost did assure my hart That was no reprobate: But that my case in effect, was muche like S. Paules, both wishing to doo God good seruice, yet when wee thought our selues best occupied, then did we most dishonor his nam: Neither would not the Lord once suffer Satan to assault my conscience either with the feare of desperation, or once to doubt of my saluation, Oh how truelie might say with Dauid, did confesse my sinnes vnto the Lord,
Thus hauing briefty touched the most horrible Rebellion of Hacket against the Lord Iesuts, with the manner of his deluding mee, to proclaime him as before: conclude thus much of this first point, that if we either consider the purpose of the man, the maner of his proceeding, or the sequell of his ending, wee can behold no better in Hacket then fearefull signes, so farre as mortall man can discerne.
how they flatter and bolster themselues in their sins, vpon a vaine and foolish perswasion, that Hacket (so vile a wreteh) might be saued, because forsooth it is reported, that albest he could not, or would not ask God mercy: yet before he died
he held vp his handes; for the verie paines and panges of death will inforce a man to cast vp his hands when he cannot otherwise help himselfe: pray God blesse me and all good men, from such a bad end or maner of ending, that hauing his tongue, and requested to pray, doth refuse praier and fall to cursing: hope (by Gods grace so long as liue) that his example shall be Lots wise vnto mee, to be admonished howe to trust any man in matters of Religion, (further then he hath warrant from the word) what visions or reuelations soeuer he pretend,
which rule heeretofore, if had well ovserued, (as my heart still intended) had not committed so great an offence in the Church of god.
To the greater dishonour of Christ Iesus, the griefe of the godly, and reioycing to the aduersarie, and to the imminent danger of mine owne soule, and bodie, whereof it followeth to discourse in perticulers.
First, concerning the greatnesse of mine own offence, in proclaiming Hacket to be Christ Iesus the Iudge of the world, as cannot denie it (in respect of the publique scandall giuen) to be so little, as the rebellion of Korah,
Dathan, and Abiram, who notwithstanding were all three swallowed vp into hell; Nor yet as the presumption of Nadab and Abihu, in offering strange sacrifice vnto the Lord, whereby themselues were as strangely consumed with fire from heauen; Neither yet as the wilfull murdering of Abell,
perpetuall curse of Kaine, and all his posteritie: Nor yet as the trecherie of that Traitor Achitophell, against his Soueraigne, who afterwards desperately hanged himselfe: Neither yet as the hot persecution by Saule against poore christians,
who for the same was stricken stark blind: All which offences, though they were great, and their examples fearefull: yet (in respect of their outward facts committed) the same extended no further,
then either against the commandementes of God in his required worship, or the good of his saints.
But mine offence touched directly the person of Christ Iesus, the eternall sonne of the Almightie God, which must needs be so much the greater, As the person of Christ, is aboue a mortal man, or God himselfe aboue his co~mandements; So that of necessitie must either co~pare it with the sin of Iudas, or the fall of Peter: because they were both co~mitted directly against the very person of Christ Iesus, the Lord of life, and the king of all glorie.
But as may not grant at any hand, that my sin was as great as the fact of Iudas: No more can estimate it to be so small, as the sinne of Peter, both which shall appeare the more plainly by these comparisons following.
First, concerning Iudas fact; It proceeded especially of a couetous desire to enrich hymselfe,
as the scripture beareth witnesse: both in asking the high priest etc..
what they would giue him to betray the Lord Iesus,
Truly, should accuse my self wrongfully, if should grant there was any such matter sought or intended on my behalf: or any talk amo~g vs, to any such purpose.
Secondly, Iudas transgressed wilfully against the forewarning admonishion, and threatning of the Lord Iesus, saying,
wo be to that man by whom the son of man is betraied: telling Iudas when he asked, that it was himselfe.
The Lord knoweth had no such forewarning that Hack. meant to proclaim himself Christ Iesus the Iudge, til the very instant as before is declared whe~ had no power nor grace to resist, bei~g sore bewitched and possest with his diuelish spirit, to be led like a dru~kard which way he would.
Thirdly, Iudas the traitor, sinned presumptuously, against his own knowledge conscie~ce, for he knew Christ Iesus to be the sauior, so had himself profest and preached
but highly pleased God in that which did vntil the sorcerer Hacket was ha~ged.
Fourthly, there is no mention made in the scripture, that Iudas wept for his offe~ces, or once asked the Lord pardon: on the other side, it is not vnknown both vnto God and many of hys seruants, that haue often wept since, euen for offending so good a God, still asking, seeking and knocking for pardon, and not without comfort thanke my lord Iesus.
confessed his sins: and yet was damned, Therefore not all that repent are saued.
answer, that is most true, for his repenta~ce was onlye carnall,
after brought desperation with it, and inforced him afterwardes to hang vp himselfe
As for his confession, it was only to man (and not vnto God) neyther did he euer aske God or man forgiuenesse.
But thanke God in Christ, my sorrow was such, (as the Apostle speaketh should be in true Christians) which brought foorth
repentance vnto saluation: for that my greefe especiallie arose from these causes; (not for fear of torme~ts) but for displeasing the almightie Godhead: for greeuing his spirite, for offending his little ones,
With full assurance notwithstanding, that my sauiour Iesus would forgiue me all my sinnes, and grant the grace heereafter to serve him better, for the which daily pray; Therefore know, my sin was not so heauie or great, as the fact of Iudas, if they be ballanced with the weights of Gods sanctuarie: That my sinne cannot be so light,
(but farre more heauie then Peters denial) wil easily grant.
First, for that as the scripture reporteth) Peter did but thrise denie his maister Christ.
at the least threescore times: Peter only denied his maister before a few secretly: but proclaimed the vsurper Christ.
openly, before the face of all maner people, and that in the greatest Citie of England, about the varie height of the day.
Peter no doubt of frailty denied his maister, onely for the preseruation of his life, which otherwise might haue bene in danger.
But there was no such danger to be feared of me, if had renounced Hacket to be Christ Iesus.
Peter immediatly repented of his sinnes at the verie crowing of a poore cocke:
But could not be brought to knowe that had sinned,
(much lesse to repent) for twelue daies together: viz. so long as Hacket liued after our arising: Till by his death was discharged of his diuelish spirit.
Therefore my sin cannot but be greater then Peters fall, who though he cursed himselfe twise or thrise, yet did farre exceede him therein also.
Thus albeit Peters fall was verie great in denying his maister, yet you see mine to be manie waies greater.
It may be then demanded, how great my sin was, seeing
auouch it to be aboue peters; And yet not so great as the treason of Iudas, which was the sinne against the holy Ghost,
and might euidently appeare by his bowelles gushing out, when hee
To resolue this question, thus much protest vpon my very conscience,
that as before haue noted the sinne of Hacket to be the greatest that euer was committed by any reprobate: So take mine to be absolutely the greatest that euer was done by any of the elect;
And as note Hackets rebellion, to be a sinne in the highest degree feare against the So doe estimate my sinne in proclaiming hym, to be in the highest degree against the lord Iesus, as hee was man.
By this accompt may some say, you make your fact, greater then the sinne of Iudas, which he committed onely against the Lord Iesus.
though he sinned directly against the verie person of the Lord Iesus: yet he sinned against the also: In that hee knewe Christ to be the sauiour of the worlde, and yet did wilfully betraie hym to death, as before is noted: wherein hys sinne did farre exceede mine, as haue plainly prooued by manie reasons, hee sinning of knowledge, of ignorance: he of wilfulnesse: of weakenesse: he against admonition and threatning, hauing no suche forewarning at all.
Therefore to ballance my sinne to be equall with his, (who did persecute his treason, flat against his conscience, which did not) is directly vnlawfull.
likewise agaynst my knowledge, hauing read the forewarning of the Lord Iesus: To take heede of all suche wicked persons, as should falsely take vppon them
confesse the same to be true indeed, but yet so,
as this is true also, that at the verie instant when Hacket bid maister Coppinger and mee to proclaime him Christ Iesus: he had quite expelled the former sentence out of our mindes.
could not bee dispossessed of that diuelish opinion so long as this erronious spirite was within me, that is to say, during hys life.
Thus doe with all reuerence and humilitie defend my selfe not to haue sinned against the and yet as willingly doe confesse,
that my sinne is the greatest, that euer was committed by anie of the redeemed: Protesting from the verie bottome of my heart, that if shoulde lie in Cheynes all the dayes of my life,
in the deepest Dungeon about all LONDON, and should continue there so long as liue; (or rather so long as the worlde indureth, if it coulde be possible) yet were that punishment too small a pennance, for so grosly abusing my Sauiour Christ Iesus, and so an ende of this poynt, touching the greathesse of my sinne, and what punishment haue deserued in this world (besides eternall tormentes, in the worlde to
come) If God should but deale with me in hys iustice, as am fully assured he will not; But freely extend his mercies still vnto me, whereof now followeth brieftly to discourse:
To speake as shoulde of Gods mercies towardes me, Truely (as David saith) they be so many and great euery way,
that am not able either to number them, or rightly to consider of those which know; But will adde my best indeuour to expresse my present feeling in both.
And first to speake of Gods prouidence ouer me, during Hackets life: Secondly, to speak of his like fauour towards me after his death.
Concerning the former point, touching the mightie and mercifull prouidence of the almightie,
in safe preseruing mee from intended destruction, and at manie dangers, during Hackets life time: If either consider the greatnesse
of my sinne: or the want of grace: then to acknowledge the same; or the hard euent
that fell on maister Coppinger: or the malice of Satan
that sought my destruction: or compare the greatnesse of Gods mercies towards me.
with his former fauor extended to others: Then shal all men perceiue the more plainly, the goodnes of God in my preseruation.
To begin with the first point, touching the greatnesse of mine offence, haue alreadie noted it before, (according to my conscience) to be the greatest sinne that euer was committed
The want of grace that appeared in me, was manifest to all men, In that was so farre off, from shewing anie signes of true repentance, (during all the tyme that Hacket liued) that coulde not be brought to see mine offence, in that perticuler action.
Concerning the hard euent that befell maister Coppinger, with the losse of his life (thorough that wicked Inchanters meanes especiallie) spare to speake further, considering the same is touched before.
That Satan sought my wofull destruction, not onely of soule but of bodie also, aswell in this world, as in the worlde to come, can be denied of none, that rightly consider what my sinnes deserued, both by the lawes of God and her Maiestie, which by his meanes was plunged into.
What fauours heretofore the Lord hath extended vnto greeuous sinners, is plentifully recorded in the booke of God: As in healing the man that had bin
yeeres bedridden: In casting seuen Deuils out of Mary Magdalen, and in curing all maner diseases: But to none of them all hath the Lord shewed so great compassion, as hee hath done to me: and that will proue by two plain reasons, that cannot be refelled.
The former is, in preseruing me so strangely pages missing]
(because he hath preserued so monstrous a sinner: but that it might appeare to all posterities, that God hath no delight at all, in the deathe of poore sinners that are ouerreached with Satans practses: But rather that they shoulde conuert
Thus was it his good pleasure to preserue mee safely from all daungers of soule and bodie,
that hys great name of mercie might bee magnified for euer, which still wishe, and with all my heart long for: that all his creatures in heauen and in earthe, may duely and truely found out his praises for his mercies, to mee, and all other his seruantes world without end.
What mercies the Lord hath extended vnto mee since the death of Hacket appeareth in these payntes.
First, in dispossessing me of his hote diuelish spirite, and of those hellishe opinions before touched, euen the verie same houre that hee was executed.
Secondly, in restoring mee to my former loundnesse in the knowledge of the truth, without the helpe of any man mortall.
Thirdly, in: giuing mee a sight of my sinnes, with grace to iudge and condemne my selfe for them:(Namely, for rebelling agaynst my sauiour Iesus).
Fourthly, in keeping mee notwithstanding from all open shame, and consigne punishment
not once to holde vp my hand at the bar for all my transgressions.
Fifthly, in assuring me of his futher fauour and protection against the malice of Satan and all Satanistes, which heereafter seecke my destruction.
Sixthly, in preseruing my health and soundnesse of bodie from all sicknesse etc. being about
Seuenthly, in supplying my wantes, and relieuing my necessities in outward things sufficiently, when knewe no way how to helpe my selfe.
Eigthly, and lastly, which is more then all the rest, in that God hath forgiuen me all my sinnes, and reserueth me for saluation in Christ, Whereof am assured by these tokens following.
First, by the exprience of Gods almightie prouidence, in still Preseruing me from all imminent dangers of soule and bodie,
when was the vassall of Satan, bewitched to dishonour my soueraigne lord Iesus, and wanted grace to acknowledge my sinnes.
Secondly, in that God hath sent his sprit into my heart to crie Abba Father, and to saele vp the assurace of my saluation in Christ.
Thirdly, for that God doth still increase my faith, and strengthen my hope, in the onelie mercies and merits of Christ Iesus, for the whole worke of my saluation.
by thy fruites of Gods spirite proceeding from the same.
As first, the aknowledging of my sinnes, with a broken heart, (not for feare of Gods iudgements, but for offending his blessed maiestie,
who hath be he so good to me euery way.
Secondly, in begging pardon dayly for my sins, with assured confidened to obtein mercie.
Thirdly, in hating and detesting all my former sinnes, with daily request to serue God better.
meekenesse, constancie and comfort, whereby know they worke for my best.
this world and loue to Gods kingdome, with a pittifull
which God hath wrought in mee by his holie spirite together with hir chastisements.
Sixthly, the continuall comfort of my conscience, euer since God gaue
me that grace to condemne my selfe: whereby am sure to preuent his iudgements,
Seuenthly, my continuall desire to do good to all, (but chiefly no those of the houshold of faith:)
and that my life and death may witnesse the same to the glorie of God in Iesus Christ.
that God may be glorified in al our repentaunce, by louing and liuing together like brethren, according to the rule of Gods holie words, wishing no worse vnto my verie ennemies, then to mine owne soule.
By these, and sundrie other sauors which the Lord hath shewed me since my restraint: namely, in commaunding his angels
to pitch their tentes about me: to protect and preserue mee from all extremeties, and in sending his holy spirite and word,
do gather thus muche: That as am moste bounden vnto the Almightie, for my safe preseruation all my life hitherto: and for giuing me these tokens of his further fauour towards me, wherby do certainlie know my selfe, to be surelie resrued for saluation in Christ,
So as neither thinges present, nor things to come, Principalities nor powers life nor death, Satan nor Hell gates, shall be euer able to separate my soule either from the loue of my God in Christ Iesus, or from praising his Maiestie, with his elect in glorie, when this mortalitie hath put on immortalitie,
So in the meane time shall desire and with all my heart and soule, doe hungerland thirst: that the honour, and Kingdome of my deare Lord Iesus,
in the highest degree in the purest maner: and in the largest measure that possible may be, both in this world, and in the world to come, so be it.
Concerning the great fauors, (which poor man) hauc found of my Soueraigne, and at the Migistrates handes (especially of her moste honorable Councell, whome did so much abuse in my specehcs, when Wanted grace to guide my selse better) and for proclaiming Hacket to be the king of Europe etc..
Alas what can saie for my exeuse, (though was seduced by hys wicked spirite, and moste blasphemous storie) but confesse freelie (as do from my heart) that deserued a moste shamefull death.
See then the goodnesse of my mercifull God, in mouing the heartes of Christian Magistrates, to pitie my bodie, (as he did my soule) father then to suffer anie further tormentes to fall vppon eyther, (saue a gentle restraint to my good for the time) wherein obserue the prouidence of GOD, (through their honors great wisdome, and graue councell) in keeping me close prisoner so long, to redound moste to his honour and glorie.
For if they shoulde haue admitted the godly and Wise to haue conference with mee, whilest was possest with the spirite of Satan, might so possibly haue done them hurt: Sure am, they coulde haue me verie small good, vntill was parted as it Were with my familier,
Or, if they had sent me the blessed booke of God, during the said time (as did continuallie craue the same) surely should haue wrested the Scripture for the stronger maintenance of my errors: and so haue increased my sinnes the more.
Or if they had suffered some godlye men to haue accesse vnto me, when Hacket was executed, euen then to comfort my sorrowfull soule, when deemed my selfe forsaken of all,
Assuredlie, the glory of God should not thereby so brightly haue shined foorth: as in restoring me to my former comfort in Christ, by the speciall working of his owne holie spirit, without the helpe of anye mortall creature, that all the glory of my restauration, might redound wholie vnto himselfe.
But to speake of some particular sauours, which haue alreadie receiued of their Honors, Thus much doo most humblie confesse.
That whereas deserued continuall restrainte, theyr Honors are pleased should haue the libertie of the prison.
That all my friends may come and see me: and where deserued a most shamefull death, they haue consented (as am informed) that might sue for hir Maiesties pardon.
then, howe great cause haue and all my friends to speake good and reuerentlye of her Maiestie and Honorable Councell, for so great
fauors extended vnto mee, the which, because some wicked wretches it may be, will carpe at, (as wishing rather to haue seene my death) albeit their Honours haue sufficient reasonne to warrant their proceedings in that behalfe: yet with their fauors humbly pray pardon,
that may set downe some speciall reasons for their Honors iust defence their, to stop the mouths of all gainsaiers.
First, That euer since the Northern rebellion and before, haue professed the true Religion (according to the Gospell) And not onlie to fauour, but also to defend the Gospell of Christ, by all meanes possible.
It is not vnknown vnto hir Highnes Councell established in the North partes, that haue beene a detector of Seminaries, olde massing Priests and Iesuits, with such like deuoted enymies vnto hir Maiestie, and haue beene in commission for such purposes.
Thirdlie, when as penned that curssed prophesie against London, etc.: set downe hir Maiestie, to be exempted from those plagues thretned, (by the very speciall prouidence of God) which himselfe beste knoweth, reioyced mee greatlie, as fearing some fearefull iudgementes indeed, to befall vpon that Cittie.
Fourthlie, In that haue not onely vsed to pray dailie for her Maiesties preseruation (as before is partlie noted) but euen then when as was the massenger of Satan, protested (& the
Lord knoweth it proceeded from my hart) that if had ten mens liues within me, they should all die in defence of Queene Elizabeth,
againste all hir enimies: in tender regard whereof, do humblie sue and not without comfort for her Maiesties pardon: wishing to my selfe no fauour at all, if haue not desired More hard conditions vnto mine owne soule (for her Maiesties safetie) then all before spoken of, howsoeuer my toong was inchanted for the time to roue at randon as before is noted.
Thus hauing plainelie and truelie set down diuers speciall great fauors extended vnto me, both from God Almightie, her Maiestie, and their Honours, euen since the time of my horrible fact committed in Cheape, etc..
do humblie intreate and exhort all people, to thinke and speak reuerently of the Lords proceedings with me, who no doubt hath preserued me to a holie purpose, (euen to make his loue appeere in my want: his power in my weakenesse, and his strength in my deliuerance, aboue the malice and force of Satan to manifest his mercies vnto al posterities to be the thinge hee chieflie preferreth
and most delighteth in:) that al the whole world might found out his praises, for extending so woonderfull great compassions, to so vnworthie, most wicked, and wretched a sinner: for with reuerence bee it spoken in the eares of al men, greater mercie to a mortall creature, was neuer heard or read off, since the
from the Sodomits destruction: neither the preseruation of Shadrach, Mesach, and Abednego, in the hot fierie furance: neyther the safekeeping of Daniell in the den
out of prisonne: Though all these and many such extraordinarie examples, of the Lords mightie prouidence in protecting of his seruants, are recorded in the Scripture, for his glorie
and our instruction: yet againe and againe with all reuerence bee it spoken to the wonderfull workes of God: not one of these examples before recited, nor anye other recorded within the booke of God, (the most holie historie of our Sauiour Christ Iesus only excepted) doth more commend the mercie, goodnesse, and power of God, as the same hath appeared in my preseruation: for neyther were anye of them so great a sinner,
as haue bin, neither were their deliuerances so strange as mine: they beeing onlie preserued from bodilie dangers, but I, most mightilie protected from imminent danger of eternall destruction both of bodie and soule.
And that when wanted grace to acknowledge my sins, as before is mentioned, which dooth so much more inlarge the Lordes exceeding mercies and compassion ouer me.
And albeit the Scripture recordeth, that our Sauiour Christ cast out of one man, a Legion of Diuels,
(which importeth sixe thousand at the least, as the annotations in those places noteth) yet, (in my conscience) was not that so great mercie, as God hath shewed me: as may be gathered by these reasons.
First, It is said that the partie, was most miserablie tormented with them: Insomuche,
as the Diuels kept him still amongest the mountaines and
graues, naked and bare, and yet was so ragious, that no man could binde himfaste with irons, still beating himselfe with stones, etc..
But the Lord would not suffer me to be so tormented, no nor to be once tempted of Satan, to hurt my selfe anie waie.
Secondlie, if he had a great fauour shewed him, to haue so maine deuils cast out of his bodie, which did so torment him.
Howe much more I, to be altogither preserued from the same, hauing so deepelie trespassed, as before.
There is no record nor likelihood, that the sinne of that man was so great as mine.
Therefore, in sparing mee altogither from such torments, (who rather deserued them doble vpon me) the same must of necessitie proue the Lords mercie, to be far more extended vpon me, then towards this poore man, notwithstanding the casting out of so manie Deuils.
And now (my Lord God) how much is thy Seruant beholding to thy Maiestie, surely cannot tell, nor no man liuing, for as thy mercie is infinite in it selfe, so is thy rewarde bestowed vpon me, far aboue the reach of mortall mans conceit.
Shall saie with Paule, that albeit was a blasphemer, a persecutor (or a Rebel against Christ yet because did it
ignorantlie, Therefore thou (Lord) hadst compassion vpon mee: or shall with our firste Parentes Adam and Eue,
excuse my facte and laie the whole default vpon others as they did: No, that should doo either) for though my conscience cleare me to be innocent in will, from anie intention to dishonor Christ Iesus or abuse my Soueraigne, yet
am not to be iustified thereby: neither will excuse, but accuse my selfe so log as liue, to be worthie of all torments of bodie and soule, both in his world and in the world to come: that the whole glorie of my preseruation may be still ascribed to the Lordes onlie mercie, that the same may bee magnified for euer and euer, Amen.
what reward shall giue vnto the almighty for his so manifest and great fauours extended vnto me: truelie must needes acknowledge,
(and wish all people to doo the like with me) that there was neuer anye mortall creature so much beholding to his Creator, as humblye confes my self to be; the most sinfull wretch of
anie man liuing, and yet haue founde more fauour at the hands of my God, then anye mortall man that euer yet liued, as none can denie, that rightlie consider of the Lords proceedings and prouidence ouer me.
For is it not a miracle moste strange to behold, that the one of my Companions beeing stricke~ stark mad as was informed, ending his life in a pitifull maner: the other arrained, condemned and executed for high treason against hir Maiestie, etc.: and dieng moste desperatelie like a damned Reprobate: that notwithstanding (being the third person in that wofull pageant) should be safelie preserued from all dangers, not once to be brought before the bar of iustice.
goodnesse of the Lord to his, vnworthie seruant, and saie with Dauid, This is the onlie worke of the Lord,
and it is maruellous in our eies: yea let all the celestiall creatures in Heauen,
and all sortes of people liuing on the earth, extoll the Lords mercies and sound out his praises world without end, Amen.
But consider yet more deepelie of the lords mercie towardes me, by a temporall comparison: If that wofull wretch would thinke himselfe happie, that hauinge rebelled againste his Souereigne, should notwithstanding receiue his pardon, be admitted not only into the kings speciall fauour, but also to beholde his countenance dailie so long as he liued.
then (poore soule) how much am bon~d and beholding dailie, to the eternall goodnes of my Sauiour Iesus, the king of all glorie: that hauing double trespassed, both againste mine owne Souereigne,
In the highest degree that euer did anie nowe liuing vpon the earth, yet for all this, is not onelie pleased to moue my said Souereigne to spare my life hitherto, and to put me in hope of further fauour: But as a blessed example giuer to all Superiours, To delight in mercie, more then in iustice dooth (for his owne names sake) not only remit and release all my sinnes, but further assureth me of his eternall fauour, to enioy his presence for euermore, which dooth as far surmount all earthlie Princes fauours, as Christ excelleth all temporall Princes, and the ioyes of Heauen, all the vaine pleasures of this mortall life.
of Gods wisedome and mercies, how vnserchable are his iudgements, etc.. to him be all glorie for euer, Amen.
And if we compare the dealings of the Lord with the vsuall proceedings of worldlie Pry nces, we shall further behold Gods great fauour towards me, to exceed all the fauours of mortall Magistrates: whoe commonlye vppon the knowledge of the Treason by what meanes soeuer,
doo after proceed to condemne the partie: and hardlie pardon any (as there is no reason) without some tokens of outwarde repentance.
See and marke well then, The incomparable greatnesse of the Lords kindnesse towards me: who was not onelie pleased to receiue mee to mercie,
But euen then most of all did he shewe me greatest fauour, in safe preseruing me from all extremities of soule and bodie, when Hacket my companion was condemned for Treason, and wanted grace to acknowledge the same.
But the Lord had respect to the innocencie of my hart: for (albeit in regard of the outward offence giuen) deserued no fauour of God nor of man: yet protest before his holy Maiestie.
That when was busiest in seruing of Satan, did thinke then moste of all to please the lord Iesus.
And when pronounced the heauiest iudgementes againste the Cittie of London, then did most of all bemone their mysery.
either from wilfull dishonouring Christ Iesus in Heauen; or to hurt the least of his Seruants in earth.
Oh how truelie then may saie with S. Paule, Though with my members serued Satan,
yet in my minde serued Christ Iesus, hauing my whole intention to please him.
It was not them, that pronounced Hacket to be Christ Iesus, the iudge of the world, but
the spirit of Satan, (which that wicked wretch had infused into me, as you haue heard before) for touching the inwarde man, the Lorde and my
conscience will still beare mee recorde, that had no minde to dishonour Christ Iesus, or to hurt anie creature: therfore had the Lord compassion vppon me (not for mine innocenoie) but for his owne names sake.
Therein his prouidence dooth greatlie appeare in my preseruation for Wednesday this yeare, being the ioyefull daie of hir Maiesties happie prosperous raigne ouer vs: wherby the Lord hath extended his blessings (aswell apperteining to our soules as bodies) more bountifullie ouer this poore Hand (his name bee euerlastinglie praised therefore) then euer was shewed to anie other Nation since Christ was incarnate, Euen vpon the wednesday did the Lord destroy that Sorcerer Hacket, and cast his Deuilish spirit out of my bodie.
The same day also euen the verie daie of hir Highnesse comming to the Crowne, was my brother and wife admitted by their Honors to haue accesse vnto me: and vpon Ashwednesday the laste (so called) did their Honors further grant vnto me the libertie of the Prison.
The same day twelue months past, hauing put vpp to hir Maiestie an humble petition for a at Wakefield, which through M. Doc.

means which the Lord did blesse in managing my cause: It woulde amplifie the greatnesse of Gods fauour towards me.
that am verie deepelie bounden to the Lord: but neither they nor can tell howe muche, or sound the bottom of his compassions towards me (except we could describe the torments of hell, from which by Christes power am safelie deliuered) or rightlie consider of the ioyes of heauen (which no mortall hart is able to
conceiue) whereof, through the onelye merites of Christ Iesus, am most assured to be made partaker, bicause his holie spirite
is within me blesse his holie name: my soule againe magnifie the Lord, and forget not his benefites, extended vnto thee, but talke and meditate
of his louinge kindnesse all the daie long, yea let his praises bee euer in thy mouth, and prouoke all others to magnifie the Lord for deliuering thee from the
the booke being drawn vp for hir highnesse to signe, know (O Lord God) that the blessing thereof must proceed from
thee: if thou wilt be pleased the grant shall passe, thy holie name be blessed: and if that thou wilte not have the same to passe, Thy Name
be euer blessed: If hir Maiestie will freely signe the same, the Lord preserue hir Maiestie: and if hir Maiestie will not signe the same, yet (the Lord my God) still preserue her Maiestie, whither shee be pleased to take or spare my life, do freelie offer it to her Maiesties pleasure, protesting vnfeinedlie in the presence of God (as haue doone alreadie vnto all their Honours: That if it shall please hir Maiestie to spare my life, will become an enimie to Satan and his kingdome,
and oppose my selfe against all Heretikes, Scismatikes, Sectaries and Enimies to God and her Maiestie, euen to the vttermost of my power, so long as liue.
And whatsoeuer shall be wanting, to expresse my loue to God, his Church, my Soueraigne and Countrie, during my life, do humblie desire my death may fulfill: that more glorie euery way may redou~d to the Lord in my preseruation.
To this ende onlie, doo further craue the dailie assistance of all Gods seruauntes, to bee thankfull vnto God for my preseruation, and to pray in like sort,
For howesoeuer confesse my selfe vnworthie any fauor, yet is God most worthie of all honour and glorie, yea euen for his almightie strange protecting me.
And those that in this worlde will approue themselues to belong to his kingdome,
sonne, who humbly desireth that his wofull fall may teache others wisedome, to stand so strongly against all the mightie assaultes of Satan, that if it be possible
they may not fall, or being cast downe of weakenesse, etc..
They may be againe raised vp by the Lord, that himselfe alone may haue the whol praise of their preseruation.
And because satan, is by name, nature, and continuall practise, the mortall ennemie to all mankinde, bearing malice chiefly against those persons,
(to bring them to destruction) who liue moste vprightly, and seeke the honour of God vnfeinedly: as may appeare by his first assaulting our Parents in Paradise: by his false accusing
the iust man Iob: and by his tempting of our
sauiour Christ, (who onely was able and ouercame his forces, that he might deliuer vs in all distresse:) so as wee (being comforted
and supported) might be able and readie (after his good example) to comfort others in their extremities, so much as we may.
Therefore according to my small abilitie, hauing more experience of mine owne weakenesse, and the malice of satan, then anie other mortall creature, (as by reading of this storie may plainly appeare,) will indeuour to discouer some practises vsed by satan to abuse the simple, either by fowle or faire meanes, as they say.
And first, concerning the grosse maner of temptations, satan hath two waies to assault all
to professed false religion contrarie to Gods word: The other is to prophane true religion, with a corrupt life, if he get a man once into either of these holdes, hee will hardly be cast out.
As for example, the profession of Poperie, is a false Religion,
contrarie to the worde: because it geth the honour of mans saluation in part, or in the whole, eyther to mans owne merites in this life,
As their doctrine of the workes of supererrogation, their feined purgatory doth approue, (being both derogatorie to the pretious merites and mercies of Christ,
The former is falsly called the treasurie of the Church, which teacheth that men may liue so holily in this worlde, as they may deserue a higher place in heauen for themselves and their friendes.
The Apostles concluding with the Prophets, that all like a
being oght of our Sauiour to pray, (Lord forgiue vs our isinnes) which should be in if the doctrine of mens merites were
hee may fulfill the same, suffering in purgatorie when this life is ended: Add then the doctrine of
Christes only sacrifice to cleanse vs from all sin, should be in vaine.
If the deuill make men drunke once with these poysoned cuppes, (which the Pope perswadeth them to bee well spiced,) And yet with his pardons can wipe away all: then doth, the man possesse these mens house how holy soever they seeme in their liues but they will cauill crookedly against this the plaine text; and turne the holie scripture like a Shipmans hose, whereof meane not to stand in this place.
If satan cannot preuaile in this point but that true religion gettes the vpper hand and all menne flee from their owne merites, and appeale onely to the mercies of Christ, As before is noted: yet if hee can perswade mee to presume to much of mercie, an they may still prosecute their beastly, affections, to delight in drunkennesse,
whoredome, pride, oppresson, vsurie, extortion, or in anie other grosse sinne whatsoever, vnder pretence that God is euer mercifull, and will forgiue all men, so flat contrarie to his holy word, which denounceth the sentence of God
geaunce, to all suche prophane and gracelesse persons (who are also possessed with the spirite of satan,
professe what religion soeuer they please) of both which kind of sinners, mean to speake more herenster God willing.
satans maner of tempting the better sorte, who (by Gods speciall fauor) are freed and discharged from all those grosse corruptions of religion and life, and desire vnfeinedly so to serue the Lord as they may best please him: and that by mine owne poore woefull example.
id planting my affections of loue and hatred, as the Lord required: for satan seeing me to loue the preaching ministerie, and to stand with them in their iust defence, against all such persons as sought their iniurie: And further, howe laboured to get some notorious offenders punished: Hee did so procure my discredite with the worst, that they had almost cost me my life.
but that my credite still increased with the best, who did ouermatch his malice against me.
Then he fought quite to spoile my estate, for euer to disable me from doing anie good, in the Church or commonwealth: and that was by abusing my affection of compassion, in seeking to releeue a poore distressed gentleman beyond my abilitie, which hath brought no small discredite to the Gospell, and that greeueth my soule most of all.
that the ground of my affection was laid in Gods feare, to seeke to restore a decaied meber of the church and yet that should so farre
pitty his estate, as in labouring to vpholde it, should ouerthrow mine owne, and so make my selfe to bee worse
then an infidell (so directlie contrarie to the holie Scripture) was more then ought to perfourme to all Christians, (namelie hauing my selfe, etc..
But in drawing great summes out of other mens pursses,
to maintain a port and needlesse expences, more then wee both were able to beare, or to see repaid in any time, building our vaine hope vpon a good dispatch of his Court suites, wthout anye warrant from God at all.
Heerein say did Satan groslie tempt me, to enter so great bondes, for the repaiment of rounde summes, without any certeintie how to performe the same: or as yet can tell, which hath often times, and as yet daielie woundeth, my sore broken heart, for discrediting thereby my holie profession.
euen by offring the sale of that liuinge haue (to leaue almost nothing for my wife and my selfe) the Lorde best knoweth, and others can witnesse of credit and worship, yea some of great honour if need required.
But coulde not preuaile (saue to my great losse) my liuing standing onlie, by means of a Patent for terme of my life.
to beare with me for the principals to take it as maie paie it, by processe of time: And if God spare me life, will see it discharged all in time, thogh the partie
tie himselfe for whom was bound, should to performe the same.
How was serued at his hands (hauing consented to part with all we had, to discharge our conscience with al our creditors) when he see had gone so farre as could, spare to speake for diuers respectes, wishing rather our repentance, might inlaie our credit with GOD and man (as dailie desire of the Lorde in my praiers) then by continuing still in our sinnes, to hinder the blessing of the Almightie vppon our indeuours, seeking by lawefull meanes our repaire euerie wale.
Concerning that point which hath been often obiected against me,
For leauing mine owne charge, and accompanying the partie to further his causes, cannot see (with submission bee it spoken) that haue therin trespassed otherwise then of frailtie, as a man maie do in his best indeuors.
(as the Scripture dooth approue) then hope it will not proue vnlawfull, for one child of God to do for another in cases of necessitie, (not hindering therby the duties of his calling in the Church or or rather hauing no speciall charge all, but such as may spare a man to performe such duties.
nie such like person, that hath a publike charge in the Church or
to leaue his publike calling, and be take himselfe priuatlie to follow the causes of one priuate person, is simplie vnlawfull.
But for a man that hath onelie a charge of a wife and familie (prouiding wel for them) or to come to my selfe,
hauing no further charge, then a company of wilde deare to attend vpon, the which (by vertue of my patent) maie lawefullie be discharged by others (and better then by my selfe, my infirmities considered) see no reason to the contrarie, (except all loue duties should surcease, etc..)
But that to do more good to the church and by seeking the repaire of a decaied profitable member of the same, may well bee spared for a time from my charge, to manage his cause, or to helpe him with my bondes (if had kept within my compasse therin) namelie considering these reasons following.
When Satan my old enimie, coulde by no meanes preuaile, neither to discredite nor disable me vtterly, but that (by Gods prouidence) was like in short time to passe through al dangers: then did he seeke to abuse my simplicitie by the affection of trust or credit in an other respect,
and so to plunge me at once ouer head eares, into the pit of woeful perdition, to destroie my soule and bodie for euer, if he coulde possible: and that was by making Hacket his instrument, pages missing]
all men could see no other likelihoode but present destruction of soule and bodie was like to fall vpon me, (my selfe preparing continually for death,
whensoeuer shoulde be thereunto called, which expected from day to day) Behold the great goodnesse of Almightie God towards me, in mouing their to take compassion of me, not once to suffer me to come in place of iudgement, but further to consent that my life should be spared.
then howe truely may say, with the Prophet Dauid, The Lord is my shepheard: therefore can lacke nothing, for though walke within the shade
of death: yet shall feare nothing for with his rod and shepheardes staffe, am still comforted, yea he will still preserue me from euerie euill worke intended against mee, and reserue me safely to inherite his kingdom:
Nowe haue you heard inbriefe discoursed, the substaunce of satans seducing mee, touching that moste horrible action committed, of proclaiming Christ Iesus in Cheapeside, etc..
With the maner of his deluding my affections from time to time, wishing and admonishing that my wofull fall, may teach all others in time to beware, and by all good wisedome to preuent satans practises for can tell them (by tried experience) that when they themselues do least suspect him, in may be hee seeketh most of all to intrap them: The Apostle saith truely, Resist Satan, and he will flee from you: But all the cunning
lieth howe to knowe when hee doth tempt vs, with what weapons wee should resist him, at what time to put the same in practise: whereof (God willing) you shall heare more hereafter, as time and opportunitie will permit: In the mean space let all maner people knowe thus muche, that seeing satan hath sought so instantly my death and destruction, protest my self his deuoted enemie, (by the grace of God) to oppose my selfe against him and his kingdome, so much as in me lieth, euen so long as liue: desiring further, that it may not be forgotten what Christ hath done for me, that all sorts of people may sound out his praises worlde without end.
And nowe my poore soule, conclude and say with Dauid, Whom haue in heauen but thee
VVhen myne heart faileth, and my strength also: euen then art thou my strength my portion for euer.
To this Almightie God desire, that all his creatures in heauen and in earth, may ascribe all honour, and glorie for euer, Amen.
humblie craue that as my fall, Hath much offended each degree, So my restore, may comfort all That loue the Lord vnfrinedlie.
And to that end wish this booke, In all mens hands accordinglie, That who soeuer on it looke, May praise the Lord eternallie.

Alas what glory shouldst thou gayne in damning me to hell.

for thy saluation to be borne: That so he might in thy nature, his fauour lost agayne procure.
So that when sinne did styll abounde, and Satan sought thee to confounde, Gods iustice yeelding to the same, to throw thee downe to endles shame: Beholde the great exceeding loue, of Iesus Christ that did him mooue, Thy sauegarde man to vndertake,
and so to suffer for thy sake, The paynes of hell, and to fulfill in euery poynt his fathers wyll. If thou belong to God aboue, then dost thou feele his greatest loue.
His holy spirite assures thine hart, that in Christes sufferinges thou hast part: steadfast fayth in Christ his death, this spirite in thee sealed hath, constant hope by him alone, for to obtayne saluation.
None other Sauiour dost thou craue, but onely Christ thy soule to saue. Thus must we all Gods people deare, confesse the loue he doth vs beare, In chosing vs before the rest and louing vs his chyldren best, In whom he reigneth by his worde,
and keepes vs from the enimies sworde: Whose prouidence styll doth well supply, for to relieue our miserie.
Then let this great loue of the Lord, mooue all our hartes to learne his worde: To worshyp first his Maiestie, with hart and soule most constantly.
And next our heighbour in lyke sort, to loue, maynteyne, and styll comfort.
And why lst we lyue with hart and mynde, to prayse Gods loue to vs so kynde.
So long as heauen and earth doth last, and when this worlde is gon and past.
Let all Gods workes founde out his prayse, most chearefully now and alwayes: Not onely those that are mortall, but those much more Caelestiall.
let vs all with one censent, prayse this our God omnipotent. for working our saluation, through sayth in Iesus Christ alone.

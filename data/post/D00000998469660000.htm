¶to the right honourable sir thomas bromley knight lord chaunceler of england and of her maiesties moste honorable priuie counsell george vvhetstones wisheth long continuaunce of honour health and happines ·.·

right honourable so blessed hath beene the estate of this little realme since the hower of her sacred maiesties moste prosperous raigne as it hath beene a question whether the people of forraigne nations doo bemone their owne callamities or enuie our felicitie moste and as the godly wise inserte the miseries of other people to the vengeaunce of god executed vppon their owne bowels through the tyranie of their kings together with the ambytion and enuie of their principall maiestrates so doo they also acknowledge that our especiall happines proceedeth from the deuine blessing of the hiest who in the heate of percicution gratiouslie sent vs a moste gratious princes led by a spirit onely composed of pietie bountie and pittie and further strengthened her highnesse with a senate and other needefull maiestrates· so graue and pollitique as establish wholesome lawes for the publique benefit of her maiesties subiects and withall with lynxes eyes

so prie into forraine practises that by their wisdomes in the beginning they returne the weapons prouided for our mischeefes into the practisers owne entrailes so that more for feare then loue beeing through the world for our prosperitie enuied we haue free passage in forraigne nations and finde the seale of peace vppon the gates of our owne citties· which duly considered that english subiect may iustlie be proclaimed enimie to grace humanitie that rendreth not hartie thankes vnto god dutifull obedience vnto her maiestie and reuerent loue and affection vnto the maiestrates for this peace plentie and protection and seeing forraigne writers that haue their colledges enuironed with armes finde meanes to present the world with the tirannies of their maiestrates oppressions of the people and ruines of their citties
english historiographers which haue quiet recorse vnto the muses are bound to eternise the memories of the good maiestrates disseased who were the instruments of our blessings that the dead may haue their right and the liuing incouragement to vertue
right honorable bound by these considerations to discharge the office of a poore writer in monuments extant haue regestred the liues of manie woorthie personages disceased and at this present mooued with the passion of a common sorrow to showe the reuere~t zeale bare vnto iustice haue made a weake remembraunce of a fewe of the pretious vertues which gouerned the good lord dyer late cheefe iustice of the common pleas which humblie laie before your lordships searching iudgement no better garnished then diamonds set in brasse assuring my self that your

a remembraunce of the pretious vertues of the right honorable and reuerend iudge sir iames dier knight lorde cheefe iustice of the common pleas

lidgate bawldwin and many writers moe the heauie faules of naughty me haue showne

vvhen their good deedes

to tell they all are slowe

vvhose vertuous liues deserueth to be blowne with such shrill tru~ps as made mausolus knowne the cause think through rutheme~s harmes they raise and doo enuy to sound the worthies praise

but so or no the wrong dooth much increase which my weake muse hath laboured lo~g to right vvho liuing in a chosen place of peace

where vertue raignes conquers enuies might

who not with lau~ce but lawrel bough doth fight her cheefetaines then of writers iustly claime that death not time their memoties may maime

among the moe that worste may paye this debte vppon the good haue bestow'd my zeale not like their woorth but able wittes to whet for to expose their vertues euery deale who stayes were of our happy common weale
that their good rules such as succeede may guide and liue by fame as they had neuer dy'de

to bothe effects who liuing did no wronge the breathles course of good iames dier knight

of common pleas

the lord cheefe iustice long

in scarlet robes laye in open sight to shewe that death ore honout hath no might
whose deeds doo shine as diamonds in the darke and liues though dead if to his fame you harke

like him that long against the sonne dooth gase to prie into his vertues dimme my eyes vvhose monuments shine as a pharoes blase

in iudgement iust

in counsell graue and wise

clearer of doubts in law like clowds which rise
a liue refuge of those whom wronge did paine a dyer such as dy'de without a staine

but to discribe this woorthy iudge at large

let it suffice to showe from whence he came

the purple grape a thorne dooth neuer charge nor rascall rase oft breedes a childe a fame his birth was good his acts doo blaze the same
in woorship borne in honour he did ende

ray sde by desart

and not by sate or freend

in tender yeares he was to learning set and vessels long their seasoned liquors taste as time grew on he did to oxford get

and so fro thence he was in strand inne

but him with fame the middle temple graste
the deapth of lawe he searcht with painefull toyle not cunning quirks the simple man to spoyle

his was quicke his iudgement was as found his clyents such as weare with wrong opprest

his conscience good

him first with credit cround

who with much care his clyents wrongs tedrest
by vertue thus he clymde abooue the rest and feard no fall sithe men it was his guide vvhen teaching heads slip pride

from roome to roome he stept by true degrees and mounts at length to soueraigne iustice place

vvhere long he sat

cheefe iudge of co~mon pleas

and to say truthe he sare with iustice grace vvhose sacred will was written in his face setled to heare but very slowe to speake till either part at large his minde did breake

and when he spake he was in speeche reposde

his eyes did searche

the simple sutors harte

to put by bribes his handes were euer closde his prosesse iust he tooke the pooremans part
he rulde by lawe and lystned not to arte
these foes to truthe looue hate and ptiuate gaine which most corrupt his conscience could not staine

the freendles wight which did offe~d through need

he euer more

with mercy did respect

the prowder cheete that did his trespasse feede through trust to freends with scourge of law he for by the fault not freends he did direct
checkt thus he with grace the poore mans loue did draw and by sharpe meanes did keep the prowd in awe

as good things are

by cuill men ofte abusde

euen so the lawe to wrong sometime is wrest the lawe pronounst no trauell herefusde to ease their greefes whom that he fou~d opprest

and fewe so bad as disobay de his heast

this he good iudge in circute as he rode as cause requyrde still as a chauncelor stoode

fit men he did

in office euer place

and ofte put by his freends and neerest kin affirming though the gifte were in his grace the common weale cheefe intrest had therein and therefore meete the worthy should it win vvords like himself who fauoured publique good before then gaine that were spronge of his blood

vvhere he was borne all sorts his bountie knew he still stay de strifes in places as he goeth at vvestminster his death poore sutors tewe who for the poore was iudge and pleader bothe the riche mans cause he fauord but in trothe
where as he dwelt the county sounds this mone the good lord dier now is gone

and not alone but all the realme besyde his fatall losse haue cause for to lament vvho father was of lawe which right dooth guide and as his childe the same to iustice bent

vvhich to his will the iudge vniust dooth rent

but he good man did washe his hands fro wronge and sildome sought to laye his foe alonge

he neuer raylde nor rag'le atfaulty men but in good woords gaue sentence of their paine vvhere grace he spi'de he gaue such counsell the as many euill to goodnes he did gaine from selfe reuenge he euer did refraine
and yet seuere when it with iustice stoode a tullie right all for his contryes good

he did not prie into his neighbours state vnlesse it were for to sustaine his right his godly minde flew no ambitious gate but in the meane did euermore delight
whe climing heads oft reache beyond their might he iustly did discharge his charge assynde and neuer wrought to crosse his soueraignaminde

lords letters sent to winke at some abuse he aunswerd thus am to iustice sworne must offend or your desire refuse which woords to deeds he euer more did tourne yet in such sorte as reau'd conceight of scotne thus say lde the best from iustice him to drawe vvhen most men make the mighties will a lawe

the lawyer lewde as many naughty are

and yet the law

to cloke their wrongs do straine

he thus would check this string my frend doth iar you of the lawe would make a backsword faine for others eg'de for your offences plaine
you can by lawe vnpunisht steale a farme but mend or hell will sure your catcas warme

you not sustaine

but doo the lawe oppresse

and so a foe vnto the common weale
lawe frends the good dooth the leawd suppresse you would make the good her vengeau~ce feele your neighbor vse as he with you should deale
gods lawe sayth so with which ours ought agree vvhich learne for ignoraunce no plea wilbe

the like aduise he dayly did bestowe vppon all sorts as their vocations were the spender he the paines of want would showe the greedy man how that his catke and care fastned on goods for other men to share
shrowd mes complaints he in this check did blame the blinde for floth may ill vpbraide the lame

the labouring man that liues by sweate of blowe if him he found in wrangeling to delight he thus would charme good neighbor ply the plow

lawe tireth such

as haue freends coine and might let honest men
be men of thy right
thus he good iudge the poore ma~s wealth did prise before their gaine which by the lawe dooth

one all degrees in counsell or in meede he thus performde the office of a freende the fatherles and vviddowes he did feede

sustainde their rights

their iniuries did end

a cato right that did his substaunce spend on such as lackt affirming how that these his chuldren vvere vvile kinsefolke and alyes

for publique good whe care had cloide his minde the onely ioye for to repose his sprights
was musique sweet which showd him wel inclind

for he that dooth in musique much delight

a conscience hath disposed to most right
the reason is her sound within out eare
a symphathye of heauen we thinko we heare

and therefore calde the image of the soule forth of the hart which care greefe dooth wrest the swan in songs her passing bell dooth knowle the nightingale· with thornes against her brest dooth wake to singe when other birdes doo rest
as showen before for to deceiue their paine vvhose torme~ts else would make the crie amaine

this vvas his life to vvorke his countries vveale he did his health vvith care and studdie vvound vvhen as his minde diseased he did feele this vvas his ease sweete harmonie did sounde thus all vvas good vvhereto himselfe he bound

but some the best

vvith enuie vvill assaulte

and carping saye none liues without a fault

graunt it true but theires more greater are the bee sometimes the huswiues ha~d doth stinge but with his combe the householde better fare so good men do themselues with trespas wringe and with good deedes a number profit bring
now see if these through sorrow purchase grace offend like those that would their fames deface

no enuie no thy barke stayes on a shelfe

the vertuous are

with such a mirror armde

as doo returne thy darts vpon thy selfe their bodies ofte graunt by thee are harmd but their good deedes are fro thy venim charm'd vvherefore in spight of enuie time and death this iudges fame my muse shall keepe in breath

not like his worth whose life before is tould the more out losse his death doth now draw neere yet when he was infirmed weake and olde in iustice seate his iudgement still was cleare yea to his end he traueld sutes to heare
yeares could no whit his memorie asswadge vvhen many wise are childish in their age

vvell time in time what worldly is will weare and more will waste the world it selfe to naught the cannons force the lofty towers teare the strongest man how proude so be his thought in trackt of time vnto his graue is brought
euen so this iudge when as his time was come could by no plea defer his fatall doome

vvhen sicknesse came the messenger of death he patiently his sommons did obay see heere the end of all that draweth breath night clowdes quod he the sun brightest day
the huge high oke a blast dooth ouerwaye
so prince not peere to saue them from the graue noe charter haue more then wretched stand

a heauy tale vnto the worldly wight that hath health wealth and in his bowels peace but folish man and foe to thy delight thy sorrow leaue thou liu'ste by this discease
as buryed corne consumes ere it increase
for flesh and blood no lasting life can giue but beeing dead the soule dooth euer liue

if mén with zeale this difference foresawe

a chaunge in life

hope would foorth with bee

fiat per me could neuer stand for lawe the cleargies workes should with their wordes agree the iudge would iudge as he would iudged be this sentence would the murdrers hart affright the sheathe shall wou~d who with the sword doth smight

and to be short all sorte of men would learne to liue to die and die to liue againe for what auay les a world of rule to yearne to lose the soule and leaue the same in fyne bothe lands and goods men must of force resigne and onely keepe their actions good and bad them to condemne or else with joyes to clad

more would saye if greefe to ease gaue place
but all in vaine weakenes commaunds my wyll the tyred iade dooth trip at euery pace when pampred horse doo praunce against the hill so fewe woords the sicke mans hart dooth kyll
vvhen healthfull men with long discourses play but what is breefe may best be borne away

these woords and more of more deuine regarde he soundly spake when as his hart was ill his seruaunts paines he largely did rewarde

to orphants poore

whose father he was still

bothe lands and goods he did bequeathe by will· and other gifts of charitie did giue vvhich scape my pen but make his same to liue

lords claime quod he a heriot of the dead a homage dew and men their rights must haue
bound to my prince by seruice looue and dread tys iust paye a heriot for my graue vvherefore will her maiestie shall haue

my diamonde

and my chaine of honnor eke

so showde his zeale at death was not to seeke

his worldly wyll in order thus dispos'de his care was past he found his conscience cleare vvho yet aliue through hope in heauen repos'de and neither hell the diuell nor death did feare thus like a taper light his life did were
and in the end at stawghton he did die vvhere longe helyu'de and little liu'de awrye

the heue his soule the tomb thus shrowds his corse the world his fame while world doth last wil keep vnto the wyse his deeds remay ne in force vvho for his death their harts in sorrow steepe but wronged men haue cause on cause to weepe vvherefore of right for euery eye to see vvheteas he lyes this moneing rau'de would be

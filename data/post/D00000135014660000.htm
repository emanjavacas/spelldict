to which is added the author's vindication from the calumnies and mistakes cast on him on the account of his geographical dictionary

printed for robert clavell at the peacock in st paul


the preface
the only reason of the publishing these discourses at this time is the confuting a common report spread and believed amongst them that know me not that am a jacobite or a person disafected to the present government
and this for want of a better foundation is grounded upon some passages for the most part unknown to me pretended to be found in the second edition of my geographical dictionary and to answer them there needs no more than to tell the true story of that book

my geographical dictionary was finished and first published in march
and immediately began to make collection for the inlarging and correcting of it at the request of the publisher about michaelmass of the same year our last great revolution began and their now majesties whom god long preserve were declared king and queen of england the of february following which was very near a whole year after the writing and publishing of the first edition of that book so that what ever arguments are fetched from the first edition

are nothing to the purpose except my accusers can fancy was endow'd with the spirit of prophesie

that summer published the history of the desertion and the doctrin of passive obedience or no way concern'd in the present controversie between the williamites and the jacobites
and altho my name was not set to either of them yet it soon got vent that was the author of them and the treated me accordingly but can easily suppose the gentlemen who first raised this report never heard any of these things but if they yet question the truth of them they may have recourse to mr chiswell who printed both those books
during this year and the next was intent upon the enlarging my geographical dictionary and another greater work which hope will shortly see the light and having been extremely ill used both by the and some of the swearers too for some passages in the last mentioned book became very averse to the medling any further in that controversie which perceived was for the most part mannaged with more heat than discretion on both sides

about michaelmass
was forced to leave the town and go down into suffolk my native country to take care of a part of my estate which could not lett
here another set of thoughts and

business took possession of me and had neither leisure nor any inclination to trouble the world any further upon that which was the subject of the two last books till at last the insolence with which some men treated the reverend dean of st pauls drew from me three sheets of paper which were printed but need not be mentioned here he that prints this was the publisher of them and if they can from thence either prove me a jacobite he will furnish them with those papers and shall acknowledge they are good artists

whilest was thus imployed met with the first notice of the second edition of my geographical dictionary in the country where then lived in the gazette of may
which strangely surprized and incensed me having not heard one syllable of any such thing intended till met with my name in the gazette
and thereupon sent up to london to have a disclaimer of the said impression printed in the gazette too for my justification which presume mr jones has not forgot but this being denyed came up to london and endeavoured all the ways that were possible to give notice to the world that this second edition was published with out my knowledge or consent but the bookseller that did me this injury had so all ways of that nature that could have nothing done till he himself to stop my mouth published a

second advertisment in the gazette of june the with these words added to the former title the second edition corrected and enlarged by another hand whereas in the first was tacitly insinuated to be the person that had imposed upon the world and in some of the titles of the book was expressly said to be so
tho in truth it was never corrected at all and there was so little added that the book was printed in half a sheet of paper less than was in the former edition yet am informed there were some few things added and upon them chiefly this calumny is built as the boyne which river was not in my first edition to be sure there is nothing of his now majesties passing it
and am also informed there is great exception taken to some things that were in the first edition and ought to have been corrected in this as they certainly had been if had not been thus used

being nothing satisfied with the advertisment put into the gazette in a letter prefixt to the second edition of mr lawrence euchard compendium of geography dated the of september
again disclaimed this second edition of my geographical dictionary
and after all this thought had given the world abundant satisfaction that was no way concerned in it nor responsible for any thing therein added or omitted

there is now at this very time a third impression of my geographical dictionary in folio in the press for him that printed the first and that too is corrected and enlarged by another hand and much at the rate with out doubt the second edition was
however am sure it is done without my knowledge and consent and so without any one of the many corrections and additions had in about five years prepared for it
it is not improbable so soon as ever it is printed and published shall again from it be proved a jacobite or any thing some men have a mind to prove me and therefore do hereby again disown it

during the time lived in the country applied my self to the service of my country in the office of a justice of the peace and for want of better men it was too often my lot to give the charges in that part of the county where lived and what there spoke on these occasions is known to too many to be any otherwise represented than as it was spoken so that can not possibly give a better testimony of my loyalty to their majesties than these charges which as to the two first were delivered at a time when had not the least prospect of ever being any otherwise imployed by them

the first intimation had of this was in the latter end of august which was wholly without my

seeking as is well known to a person of great honour from whom received the first account of it

shall now refer it wholly to my readers to judg between me and my accusers whether it be reasonable to believe me a jacobite upon the account of a book which was written printed and published very near a whole year before the present government was established to which some things are owned to be added since it went out of my hand by another person in which there are many passages which designed to have struck out or altered and to which intended to have added very much which have been since forced to put into the grand dictionary and to believe this against the testimony of all those pieces have printed since that time in defence of their majesties title and government and then be their judgment what it will am their

a charge delivered at the of the peace holden at ipswich in the county of suffolk the xth day of october in the year

gulielmi mariae angliae

gentlemen

there was perhaps never any nation in the world that had better laws than that of which we have the happiness as english men born to be members but then may as confidently aver that never any nation was more guilty of the breach of their laws nor more averse to the execution of them on those that had broke them than we generally are here in england
by which it comes to pass that our laws seem not to be what indeed they are and we by our negligence and stupid carelesness lose the benefit of those laws on the one hand and on the other encourage offenders to multiply their iniquities till they become intolerable burthens to the earth and are cut off by the hand of justice in the end who might easily have been reformed in the beginning if they that are entrusted with the execution of our laws had been careful and endustrious in doing their duties

quid leges vanae sine moribus to what end serve those laws that have no influence on the lives and manners of men why truly know nothing they are good for but to reproach the men that break and the men that should but will not execute them
had been born amongst the lawless cafrers in africa or the northern indians in america a brutish nation that have neither laws nor government should have been only responsible for the breaches of the law of nature but when neither the laws of god nor the laws of the land nor the laws of nature will hold me in or put a curb upon my unruly lusts and passions it is a reproach to me and to the humane nature which is made to look more brutish and ungovernable than that of the savage beasts and have no excuse to plead before god or man for my justification

well but tho there is little to be said for the breakers of our laws there is less to be said in excuse of those that should but will not execute them
are you weary of your good laws why then let them be all at once repeal'd knock off these fetters turn the malefactors loose into the nation without fear or danger of the laws and then consider what will follow
shall any man be safe one moment in the possession of life or limb or house or lands or goods will not every man's wife and daughters be exposed to the violence of outrageous men too and in this wretched state what will our country be better than an acheldama a field of blood and violence once saw the rabble a few days in a lawless rage and it frighted me more than any thing ever saw in my life
ireland and scotland have seen and felt this calamity for a longer

time and to a higher degree but what has followed but desolation in the one and bitter and loud complaint in the other if men would but think it were impossible they should value any thing above the laws which are the only security they have for all the comforts of this life nay for life it self

nor do pretend men would willingly be rid of their laws or do not understand the value of them
the rebellion in and the revolution in are sufficient instances how stoutly can and will appear for their laws when they see or do but imagine they are in danger to be deprived of them
every man that suffereth any thing contrary to law or is deprived without law makes loud complaints and the actors are sure to incur the publick hatred of the nation· and to be detested to the pit of hell both living and dead which are clear proofs the value and goodness of our laws are very well and very commonly understood
what then is the cause they are no better executed why gentlemen there are various causes but can only hint at them and must leave it to you and others to remove them


the first of these is partiality both as to laws and as to offenders
every man excepts one man and that sin he has then an occasion for
punish thieves and murderers as much as you please but what harm do the drunkard the common swearer well punish them too saith another but let conscience be free what all consciences no punish the papist and the atheist
for what for not keeping his church not serving of god
why oh man thou art guilty of the same thing
ay but do it

out of conscience and so may the first of these as truly say and the latter as confidently and none but god that knows the heart can confute them
well but when we have got over this bar all is not safe yet for all offenders are not to be punished neither this man is my friend that my kinsman a third is rich and will revenge it a fourth poor and the parish must suffer for it
why who shall be punished then the friendless the helpless the hated one of a thousand or so
thus laws are made cobwebs to catch flies and pass hornets the stronger the more dangerous rovers

ii
another cause is lasiness
the execution of laws is a laborious and painful task expertus loquor speak what know and have felt
it is easie to pass by and wink at the offences of men but let a man once rouze up himself and resolve to do his duty and he shall quickly find it is much easier to declaim against vice than to punish it
but surely this is no reason why we should not do it because the trouble that will follow for want of justice is infinitely greater than the trouble of doing it if we will not have the one we must submit to the other

iii
a third hinderance is cowardize
he that doth his duty must expect great opposition and much ill usage and some revenge
and why should expose my head and family to all this why let such an one do it
ay doubtless even the man that has no being mr for he only is above the revenges and molestations of all his neighbours
this is the reason why moses so often and so earnestly exhorts all that were concerned in

the execution of justice to be stout and courageous and not fear the face or power of any man because the judgment was the lords and he would assert and defend his own minister and ordinance against all that should design their disquiet or wrong

now gentlemen if could but cure your partiality your lasiness and your cowardize would then promise my self a good effect
but must beg your pardon here for but supposing you can be guilty of any of these things men of your character and estates can never be suspected never justly
why gentlemen would not defame you nay nor so much as suspect you if time and many years experience had not taught me to despair of having what can say regarded
would not suspect even where cannot but be certain but must suspect whether will or no and you may forgive it me because it is in your powers to satisfie me and the world you do not deserve to be suspected and if upon the return of your verdict find cause for it will publickly recant what now say and at the same time return you my thanks for confuting my jealousie
the gaining this point is all aim at to excite and awaken your drowsie sleeping attentions and even anger you into your duty if nothing else will do
but when all is done would not willingly offend you and if have gained my point am sure have not

the statute of the

saith very truly

there is nothing within this realm that conserves the subjects in more quietness rest peace and good concord

than due administration of laws for where this is not impunity will soon produce sufficient matter to disquiet any nation
but the work of righteousness shall ever be peace

you shall diligently enquire of and truly present

all treasons and traiterous conspiracies against our most gracious sovereigns king william and queen mary by whom when and where the same were perpetrated or attempted entred into or disclosed
it is true this court cannot try any treason because not in our commission but yet we can and ought to enquire of it and you to present it that the records may be after removed into those courts who can try the same

the compassing the death of the king or queen or prince and declaring the same by any open deed
such as are a design to depose or imprison them
for death hath ever followed upon these actions and of necessity ever must
there is said charles the first but a small distance between the prisons and the graves of princes and his death soon after verified the observation
such are the misfortunes of our times that loyalty it self is now suborned and made accessary to the disquieting and endangering two of the best princes that ever set upon the english throne and men think and say they do not owe them the same allegiance they did their predecessors because they are so de facto and not de jure
a bold and a false assertion but which will not justifie the conclusion if it were true
the allegiance is the same be the foundation of it what it will for our laws know but one allegiance and have the same punishment for all traytors

the other overt acts are the providing weapons to effect it sending letters to second it assembling people to take the king or queen into their power writing letters to a foreign prince to incite him to an invasion for speaking is not an overt act within the statute but if it be set down in writing any way it is then an overt act

the joining with the king's enemies within the realm or without and the levying war against them is another branch of treason within the act of the

the rest of the treasons there mentioned can scarce be supposed to fall within your cognizance and therefore may be omitted for brevity

the second charge delivered at the of the peace opened on friday the of april at ipswich and held by adjournment to the of the same it being a general fast that day
delivered again on friday the of july in the same year at ipswich with some few alterations

gentlemen

it has ever been my custom in obedience to the usage introduced by our wise and industrious ancestors to open the charge was to give you with something of a preface or short introduction necessary as to the times fit for me to speak and for you to hear tho the bare repeating the articles were much more easie to me but value nothing in this world so much as the service of god and the safety and welfare of my country which are the main things have ever aimed at and for the promoting of which shall never think any labour or hazard too great

deplorable is the state of mankind whilst we live in this mortal life and miserable world neither

god nor man prosperity nor adversity peace nor war plenty nor want can universally please all and which is most of all to be admired at men in all ages have been most insolent most discontented when heaven has most smiled upon them when deliverance prosperity peace and plenty have been given them and their wishes prevented no sort of men have met with harder usage no times with more murmurers than those that have been imployed by god to deliver his people from the most pitiful state and condition of which in the old testament moses and jeptha and gideon and samuel and david are clear and undeniable instances if had time to open their story

this carriage of the jewish nation from first to last both towards god and towards their deliverers was so constantly the same that the psalmist in his short epitome of their story sets it down as a never failing rule when he slew them they sought him and turn'd them early and enquired after god
but then

no sooner were they delivered but it immediately appeared they did but flatter him with their mouth and dissembled with him in their tongues
and as they thus foolishly treated god so they did his instrument too
for which of the prophets saith st stephen have not your fathers persecuted acts

or which of the princes judges generals met with better treatment but of this shall say the less because the history of the bible is in all your hands upon the least hint your thoughts will suggest all that can say upon this subject

to lead you then to another scene which shall verifie the same rule will remark to you that within the space of and three years the devil stirred up against the primitive church nine dreadful and bloody persecutions and was in every one of them sufficiently baffl'd and disappointed so that it became a rule sanguis martyrum semon ecclesiae
for they every day became more numerous than before so that by the time have mentioned his oracles were universally silenced his temples deserted and desolate his altars cold and neglected and the images that had heretofore been adored as the repositories and thrones of the diety were only regarded as the works of excellent statuaries but destitute of life or motion so that now he saw clearly his kingdom was ruined his dominion subverted and all his arts detected and destroyed this put him upon the last effort his to ruin the church and the manumised world

to this end he represents to galerius one of the caesars under dioclesian and maximianus the then emperors that the old rites and venerable customs and religion of their ancestors profess'd and used by them were wholly neglected and at the point of being for ever disused and slighted that all those noble piles that had in so many ages been erected and endow'd to the honour of the gods beautifying the empire the celebrating the memory of augustus and the rest of the emperors the vast numbers of priests flamens pontifices and know not what other orders of jugling knaves too like our popes cardinals monks and jesuits of latter times

were all undermined by an obscure person who was crucified in judea in the days of tiberius caesar and that if they sat still but a little longer the whole world and the emperors themselves must in a short time submit to a crucified man and vale their scepters to a cross

dioclesian was an old prince and not easily moved to undertake what he was not certain he should effect because nine others before him had miscarried
but galerius was young and puffed up with the pride of a victory over the persians and he imbraced the suggestion with warmth and zeal and he recommended the project with passion and backed it with and lying defamations
he told the old prince that it was not possible the christians could be loyal to him because they hated and defamed his gods and ridiculed his religion they despised his sacrifices and undervalued his statues images saints and hero's and he might cherish them as much as he pleased but none did truly love the emperor but those that joined with him in his religion

when the number of the christians was objected and the paucity of the pagans he told the prince their religion had by good fortune and the folly of its author delivered them up bound hand and foot for said he they are by it tied not to resist nor have they ever yet dared to resist how much soever they have been oppressed so that if they were ten to one more than they are your majesty may promise your self an easie safe and infallible victory over them
he ordered also the royal house at

nicomedia to be fired and falsly pretended the christians about his court fired his house to consume his majesty and his religion in the same funeral pile
hereupon in the beginning of the year of christ three hundred and three in march there was published by dioclesian and maximian an edict that all christians should be compelled throughout the world to sacrifice to the gods that all their books and monuments should be burnt their churches pull'd down their bishops and inferior clergy be cut off and all means used that was possible to extirpate this new sect of men the enemies of the gods and of the empire from off the face of the earth upon which ensued the most universal persecution that ever had been for it extended from the in the west to the river tygris in the east and from the rhine and the danube in the north to the mountains of atlas in the south no city nation or province no sex or age no quality or estate was exempted and it lasted ten years without any intermission under dioclesian and maximianus galerius and severus maxentius and licinus till in the latter end of the year three hundred and thirteen constantine the great having conquered maxentius and cut off maximianus and galerius being by the hand of god cut off by a dreadful and loathsome disease an edict was published at milan by constantine and licinius in favour of the christians who were not only permitted the free exercise of their religion but had the favour of the prince and the security of the laws turned on their side

how did the christians now behave themselves in this great and sudden change from an abyss of misery to the heighth of temporal felicity why assure you though dioclesian was then living and an abdicated prince there was not one jacobite in that age not one christian that scrupled to swear allegiance to constantine and licinius that branch of the doctrine of which gives the clergy a right to determine the rights of princes was then not known not mentioned and when licinius too returned to his paganism and fell a persecuting he was soon after abdicated and deposed too not by the bishops or pope but by constantine too and he found never a jacobite to pout and murmur and plot for him neither

why these men had suffered enough of all conscience to satisfie them that though they might not draw their swords against their pagan persecuting princes yet god had not tied up his own hands too but he might raise up a prince of orange that was no subject to galerius severus maxentius or licinius but equal and no more than equal to the best of them in authority though inferior at first to any of them in extent of dominions and he by the favour of god upon his arms might lawfully pull those tyrants from their thrones and divest them of that power which being given them by god for the good of men they had abused to the ruin of his church the destruction of true piety the encouragement of perjury idolatry and all manner of wickedness and as much as in them lay to the desolation of the world

in our revolution which produced this monster of ingratitude to god and our deliverers in ireland where the storm fell heavier and lasted longer the very vexation taught men more wit and they of that nation that have not been since in england will scarce believe we have any jacobites at least no swearing jacobites
but of this hereafter

what return did the primitive christians make to so stupendious a deliverance why they sent vollies of praises and hymns to heaven and watered the earth with floods of tears proceeding from raptures of joy and gratitude and the new built churches were filled with the praises of god and prayers for their constantine and few sermons ended without a bitter invective against those enemies of god and his church who had so long and so furiously endeavoured to destroy them and their religion

this joy was very short for the christians were no sooner delivered from the heavy pressure of the pagan persecutions but they presently fell into schisms heresies and divisions amongst them which were almost as troublesome and much more infamous and destructive to the church than the worst of the pagan persecutions
donatus in africa and arius a discontented priest of alexandria in aegypt were the authors of these new troubles
and now those bishops and holy men who had sustained the pagan fury of the persecutions with a patience and union that made them revered by the pagan world as men of a divine spirit being fired each against the other by their domestick animosities and

divisions treated each other with so much passion and so little respect that both parties became ridiculous to the unconverted pagans and the theaters and other places of publick conversation were filled with the brangles and arguments of disagreeing christians and the scoffs sarcasms and bitter reflections of the pagan wits
donatus began his schism a little before the peace of the church and arius his heresie in three hundred and fifteen but two years after it
the first of these could never be ended but with the utter ruin of the african church by the goths and vandals moors and arabians and the latter was not brought into any order till the reign of theodosius the great very near one hundred years after

speak not this to excite your wonder or your passions but to allay them the church of england has within half a century of years suffered two bitter sharp persecutions one from the dissenters and the other from the roman catholicks and she has stood against them both and maintained her union but no sooner was she almost miraculously delivered from the latter but like the primitive church she became divided by the enemy of mankind within her self
the term of church of england men will no longer serve us but jacobite and williamite swearers and must be brought in too those that had lived together from their infancy with the greatest love and peace and charity that was possible are become strangers nay enemies to each other and treat one the other with contempt slander and defame one the other to the great divertisement and the entertainment of the

papists atheists and dissenters and to the endangering the ruin of the best church in the whole world and not contented with this they that are but an handful of men have set up separate places of divine worship to pray for a king and queen that have no name for in all things else they agree with us
and the pretence of all this is scruple of conscience
the thing in question is whether king james the second's right to the crown of england determin'd or not the three estates of england have resolved it is and all the princes of europe except the french king have confirmed and allowed the sentence as just and reasonable and now a few of our clergy nobility and gentry take upon them to maintain the contrary and pretend they dare not submit to this definitive sentence of the three estates thus confirmed by the princes abroad but in the mean time they presume to divide the church upon a civil question they traduce and defame their brethren as apostates traytors and perjured men they wish well to the enemies both of the reformation and of the english nation and they persecute outrageously those that differ from them as far as they have means

now all this were perhaps to be born with some tolerable patience as to the but we have another sort that have taken the oaths to their majesties and yet are more implacable enemies to the rest and to the government than those that have not taken them their business is in all companies to extoll the power of france to raise scruples against their majesties title to the crown and to insinuate that the favour shewn to the dissenters

tho promised by the in the last king's reign more than once tends more to the ruin of the church than all the arts frauds violences and attempts of the papists their talent is however rather banter and abominable healths than argument and reason and they are the most detestable sort of men that ever arose in any nation and ought to be heeded the most watchfully and prosecuted the most sharply of all other because they defame the church they pretend to and make all the rest of her members suspected to be such as themselves that is the worst of men in one word perjured hypocrites

as to the only defire they would give us but one example in all the history of the church from our saviour's time to this of men that have done what they have done that is broke the peace of the church upon a meer secular civil question determined by the only authority upon earth that pretends to have any right to determine it

as to those that have taken the oaths and are still unsatisfied desire them they would consider the lenity of this government towards all those that have adhered to its enemies and are by consequence the enemies of the present government for they will not own themselves to be subjects and there is no medium between a subject and an enemy in this case
if they themselves had been to have set down how they would have been treated they could scare have asked more mercy at least they ought not
now gratitude to a generous enemy would if any

thing could have obliged them to a civil and quiet demeanor towards their superiors who could with so much ease and so much applause have long since crushed this small party to attoms
and doubtless the smallness of the party is one reason of the lenity
the government is so well established that it can as securely despise the peevish efforts of this party as a nurse doth the rage of an infant that cannot speak but yet can fight and scratch

in the next place would have them consider that the have in print acknowledged that it is their apparent interest to submit to their majesties if they could satisfie themselves
now they that have sworn cannot pretend their scruples are too strong for they have apparently mastered them and their interest that is the welfare of their church and country is certainly on that side their private interest is so too and where the temptation lies that engageth them against all these cannot conjecture except it be an envy against the dissenters and some others they hate and an concernment for some of the who indeed deserve our pity and esteem but not to that degree as to ruin our religion our country and our private families out of complement to them
nor would they think one jot the better of us if we were such fools as to do it

am sorry that our deliverers should meet with so ill a return from any of us but as the number in relation to the whole is not great so there has nothing hapned that is new others have suffered the

same ill treatment and ingratitude before them
the splendor of illustrious and great actions dazels the eyes of envious men and raiseth an hatred against those whose virtues or successes are above the common standard and the enemy of mankind who pleased himself with the scenes of misery he had prepared for the world is enraged to see his projects defeated and he exasperates all he finds disposed to it
the many parties that get or lose in such revolutions grow insolent too or discontented and exasperate each other by their jars and they that have the least hand in them fall under the hatred and obloquie of both
these are the true causes of this thing

the third charge delivered at the of the peace holden at ipswich for the county of suffolk the day of october when was leaving that county to settle at london as licenser to the press

gentlemen

we are here assembled by virtue of their majesties commission of the peace to hold a general for this part of the county in which we live and it is become once more my duty to give in charge to you the things you are to enquire of and to present to a duty both on my and your part of great consequence in relation to our country and our selves and therefore to be spoken and heard with great attention and care
am now by the order of my superiors to leave you and to act in another sphere in the service of the best king and queen that has for many years perhaps ever reigned in these kingdoms
a happiness we had as little reason to expect as merit to deserve so great a blessing

charles the first and charles the second were excellent princes but had queens of another religion so that the court and kingdom stood divided between the husband and wife hopes and fears but these are both of our own that is of the best religion in the world and so heartily addicted to our interest and desirous of our welfare that they have counted nothing too dear to promote our welfare and repose hence it is that his majesty has so often passed the seas and exposed his sacred person to the greatest danger that we might live at home in peace and the queen has with equal generosity assumed and laid by the reigns of government when ever it was for our good to do so neither ambition nor the love of ease have had any the least influence upon her noble soul but she has reigned when the king was absent and remitted the government into his hands when he was present and both for our good with a perfect unconcern'dness of which there is hardly another instance to be found on the records of time in any nation under heaven

well then they deserve our utmost love loyalty and devotion the utmost we can do for them or they receive from us the reward of these royal and princely virtues are above the power of subjects god only can reward this excellent pair equal to their merits and the best that we can do is to recommend them to his care and goodness in whose prosperity our own is most apparently involved

as to my self since am to leave you so shortly think am bound with samuel the prophet to assure you my dear country men that have not willingly

wronged any of you great or small in much or little
if have through humane frailty offended any man beg his pardon and assure him and all the world it was against my will and the strongest resolution could take not to have done it but as long as we are men we shall be subject to humane infirmities which we may the more easily remit because we and they are equally infirm

the saviour of the world when he was leaving his beloved friends exhorted them to love peace and union as the greatest good they were capable of in this world yea in heaven for take away these and divide the inhabitants if it were possible of the the celestial regions into factions and parties and let these mutually hate and oppress one the other bely and slander one the other as we do here below and fear the joys of heaven would abate
my dear country men what evil angel has sown these tares in our field and thus animated us against each other to that degree that nothing can again unite us common dangers in the reign that is past seemed to have buried all our former heats and we then walked in the house of god as friends but with our danger our union fled which shews it was forced

within my memory have heard it affirmed that all our divisions proceeded from our penal laws in matters of religion and that liberty of conscience would most certainly put an end to them
why we have that in the utmost degree and yet we are more unquiet than we were before
one party must first revenge the things they have suffered on those that

have inflicted them tho according to law
another must needs secure the blessing by outing them of the power to take it away who heretofore did not love it
a third thinks dominion is founded in grace and that the godly ought to rule as well as inherit the earth and till these and a thousand other whimsies are obtained we must have no peace

in the mean time all forget the enemy is at the door with victorious forces ready to conquer all if we remain thus stupidly brutishly divided nay his emissaries are within our walls and blow the coals of our dissentions in hopes to ruin us by our follies since they cannot by their arms
let us hearken then to the council of god almighty fiat justitia erit pax let us do justice and we shall have peace
give every man his due and peace will follow but if we oppress one the other the apostle tells us we shall perish
is liberty of conscience so valuable a good as was once pretended then let our superiors see it by our peaceable and modest demeanour under it for fear they repent
is the being under princes of our own religion a blessing then let us express our gratitude for it to god in an humble peaceable devotion and to them by striving to make their reigns over us happy and easie

but if we thus foolishly go on whom can we thank or blame but our selves if we return to our former state of danger and distress my kingdom is not of this world said he whom we own as our master
and the kingdom he has promised to his

is that is not here neither
and revenge are but lately adopted into the number of christian virtues and will hardly recommend their votaries to the father of spirits
mark them that cause divisions and shun them for they are the enemies of the church the enemies of the world and the enemies of god
but how shall know which side is in the wrong why that which that it would not willingly suffer without and against law is certainly in the wrong let it be what party it will or can be and pretend what reason it will for it
try all by this rule and you may safely choose which to cleave to and which to shun

this is that distributive justice which is the mother of peace and without which there is no peace nor ever was nor ever will be
do men wrong and then exhort them to be quiet under it and you will surely lose your labour and appear ridiculous and foolish
trust not in oppression and wrong for force and number are things that foldeth last long
we have seen them baffled twice within half an hundred years yea within my memory
my dear country men let us make up our differences and let every man study to be quiet and to do his own business in love preferring the common good before his own or that of his party that we may with united hearts and hands repel the common
enemy and promote the peace of england and the service and glory of king william and queen mary out most gracious sovereigns
amen

Booke of Secrets, shewing diuers waies to make and prepare all sorts of Inke and colours.
IT is first to bee vnderstood that if you wil make a great quantitie of Inke together, you must encrease the waight, and measure, according to the proportion you meane to make, as for example, if you will make ten quarts of Inke, then take foure quarts of water, and sixe quarts of vineger and wine, that is, three of each sort, which together with the water make ten quarts, and so must you doe with other quantities, either more or lesse.
The like must you doe in the waight of your other stuffe that belongeth therevnto, as for a pint of water, sixe ounces of gaule, foure ounces of victriall, and foure ounces of gum, and if you take foure quarts of water (which is eight pints) if you giue to euery pint his proportion, then multiplying eight by sixe they make fortie eight, so many ounces of gaule must you put to ten quarts, mixed as afore said with wine, vineger, water, and of victrial and gum, of each ounces, according to the first proportion, and so must you obserue your quantities, of waight and measure in each proportion, as you are minded to encrease
Take halfe a pint of water, a pint wanting a quarter of wine, and as much vineger, which being mixed together make a quart a quarter of a pint more, then take six ounces of gauls beaten into small pouder, and sifted through a siue, put this pouder into a pot by it selfe, and poure halfe the water, wine, and vineger into it, take likewise foure ounces of victriall, and beat it into pouder, and put it also in a pot by it selfe, whereinto put a quarter of the wine, water, vineger that remaineth, and to the other quarter, put foure ounces of gum Arabike beaten to pouder, that done, couer the three pots close, and let them stand three or foure daies together, stirring them euery day three or foure times, on the first day set the pot with gaules on the fire, and when it begins to seeth, stir it about till it be throughly warme, then straine it through a cloath into another pot, and mixe it with the other two pots, stirring them well together, and being couered, then let it stand three daies, till thou meanest to vse it, on the fourth day, when it is setled, poure it out, and it wil be good inke.
If there remaine any dregs behind, poure some raine water (that hath stand long in a tubor vessell into it, for the older the water is, the better it is, and keepe that vntill you make more inke, so it is better the~ clean water.
Make it in all points like to the inke aforesaid, only take a pint of water, of vineger and wine a pint more, that is, of each halfe a pint.

Take the beaten gauls, and put them in the water doe the like with the victriall in a pot by it self let those two waters stand, and when you haue cause to vse inke, poure out of each pot a like quantitie, and it will be blacke, then put into it a little beaten gum, it will bee good inke.
Take a quart of strong wine, put it into a new pot, and set it on a soft fire till it be hote, but let it not seeth, then put into it foure ounces of gauls, two ounces and a halfe of gum Arabike, and two ounces of victriall, al beaten into smal pouder, and sifted through a siue, stirre it with a wooden sticke, and it will be good inke.

Certaine Instructions for ordering of Wines: Shewing how to make Wine, that it may continue good and faint not, Neither become sower, nor loose colour.
And how you may remedie faint Wine, take away the hoarinesse, with other instructions for the preseruation of the same.
Of the preparation for the Vintage, or gathering in of the grapes, where Wine is made.
WHen the time of the Vintage approcheth, you must prepare and make ready the vessels in the places where the wines are vsed to be boiled, the chests, baskets, presses, and other instruments that are fit for euery kind of worke belonging therevnto, according to the maner and diuersities of the places, the vessels ought likewise to bee washed and made cleane, and looke for old rushes that haue beene long gathered, because they are better, indure longer then the new that are in a manner but halfe growne.
Of the time when the vintage or gathering of grapes should be.
Some gather grapes before the berries bee ripe, and thereby make their wine smal, weake,
and not durable, others gather them late, and thereby doe not onely hurt their vines, (their strength and vertue being already come forth) but make their wine of lesse force, not indure so long as otherwise it would, so that for a generall rule to be obserued, the time to gather grapes is to be knowne, by the sight and tast of the same, for if the kernell of the grape bee not green, but rather blacke, or of another colour, then the grape wherein it groweth doth commonly bring forth, it is a signe that it is ripe, there are some that crush the grape betweene their fingers, and if the kernell come forth clean without any meat sticking vpon it, they say the grape is ripe, and that it should be gathered, but if the kernell come forth with the meat vpon it, they say it is not ripe: some cut a branch out of the stocke of a vine, that is thicke, and when a day or two is past, they looke if the place where the bra~ch grew be in like maner as it was whe~ the branch was taken away, and if the other branches that were about that place be not any thing more growne, they make ready to gather their grapes, but if the place where the branch grew be lesse then it was, they stay gathering their grapes till such time the grapes waxe riper.
Grapes ought to bee gathered when the Moone is in Cancer, Leo, Libra, Scorpion, Capricornus, or Aquarius, but the Moon going out of those signes, they must make hast to gather their grapes.
They should bee gathered after three or foure of the clocke, when the dew is all consumed, and dried vp, that the aire is hote
and cleare, the wine will be the stronger, and indure the longer: the grapes that shine and are not fat, that are not withered, nor rotten in anie part, make the wine stronger, and continueth better, and the contrarie worke the contrarie effect.
Grapes that are ouer ripe make the Wine the sweeter, but lesse in strength, and continueth not so long as those that are first gathered.
The grapes that are ouer soure, make the Wine so much the souerer: but those that are indifferent, make the wine strong, co~tinue better.
Grapes gathered in the increasing of the Moone make the wine to continue lesse time, but those gathered in the decreasing, make it better: if the black grapes be boiled in the bottome of the vessel, the wine will be the redder: if the ripe bee lowest, it maketh the wine the riper: if the soure, it maketh the wine soure, if they be boiled with hony it will be sweet: if with sage, it will tast thereof: and for a generall rule, the wine receiueth the tast of the thing that is put into it, boiling moderately together for certaine daies.
If the grapes that are gathered lie certaine daies in heapes together, the wine will be the riper: if the Must boileth in the tun without grapes, it will be good and continue long, but it will bee longer before it waxeth cleare then that which boileth with grapes.
How grapes should be gathered and dressed to make wine.
doe part and chuse out the leaues, and if they find any branches or berries that are bitter, putrified or drie, they cast them away: it is requisit likewise that such as tread the grapes, do take out the leaues, if those that put them in out of the baskets, do chance to forget themselues, the leaues brused with the wine, make it the sourer, and sooner to corrupt and become faultie: of the grapes that are soure, putrified and drie, there proceedeth great domage vnto the wine.
How to purge wine, that is made of soure grapes.
It is good to seperate all the soure grapes, likewise such as are corrupt, and keepe them by themselues from the better sort, and the Must that is made of such grapes, is cured in this manner: seeth raine water till it consumeth half away, and of this sodden water put thereof into the wine, as much as you esteem to be the tenth part of the Must, and then boile it againe with the wine, till the tenth part consumeth in the boiling.
To cure the wine that is faulty by reason of raine water fallen vpon it.
If the grapes growing yet vpon the vine, or after they be gathered, be moist and wetter then they should be, by reason of the water and raine fallen vpo~ them, if you perceiue the Must be too weake, (which is knowne by tasting therof) after
it is put into the vessell, presently after the first boiling, you may poure it out into other vesseis, because that all the slune and thicknes by reason of the weight thereof sinketh to the bottome: some boile it vpon the fire til it consumeth the twentie part, putting into it the hundreth part of Gesso.
It is good to wash the vessels with pure salt water, and make them cleane with a spunge, perfume them with insence before the Must be put into them, but fill them not too full, nor yet too little but doe it with a meane, boiling the Must till it rise vp vnto the top, but not run ouer, then with your hands or else with glasses, (when the must is in the vessels) take away the froth or any other skum that riseth vpo~ it, cast it far off from the fat, for if it it lieth neere, it ingendreth hoarines and causeth a filthy smell, which two thinges make the wine to turne, wherefore it is conuenient that in such places there be asweet smell.
Before the grapes are stamped, put the Must that commeth from them, (the same day it is made) in a vessell by it selfe, which shall be well clensed both within and without, fill the vessell halfe full, and stop it well with Gesso, because the Must may continue sweet a long time, but if
you put the vessell (being stopped with copper) into a wel, it wil continue much longer, because that not being able to boile, it will alwaies bee Must.
How to know if there be water in the wine or Must, and how to seperate the one from the other.
Put into the Must either peares, or mulberies, and if there be water in the wine or must, they will sinke vnto the bottome, and if there be none, they will swim on the top: others put the wine into a new earthen pot, not washed, let it continue therein for the space of two daies that the water may distil out of the pot, and nothing remaine but the wine: others annointing a spunge with oile, stop the mouth of the vessell therewith, and then turne it cleane ouer, and if there be water in the wine, it will soake into the spunge.
Water is taken from wine in this maner, put alum into the wine vessell, then stop the mouth of the vessell with a spunge dipped in oile, then turn it in such sort, that there may nothing but water issue forth.
When you shall draw or rack wine, and open the vessels.
You must racke wine when the wind is in the North, but neuer when it is in the South, the weakest in the spring time, the strongest in the summer, but those wines that grow in drie
places, shall bee racked after the sunne is in the equinoxiall hiuernall.
When wine is racked the Moone being in the full, it maketh it sharp: when wine is taken from his lees it maketh it more subtill and weake: it is necessarie to racke wine when the Moone increaseth, and is vnder the earth, and to obserue the rising of the stars, because the lees (when the stars rise) doth moue stir vp, especially when roses bud forth, and vines begin to spring, when the vessell is opeued, it is good to spend the wine that is on the top of the vessell, and that which is in the bottome, and to keep that which is in the middle thereof, because it is of more strength, and continueth longest, for the wine that is neer vnto the mouth of the vessell, as being neerest vnto the aire, is weaker, because it casteth foorth a vapor from it, that which is in the bottome, or in the lees, doth soone decay.
It is requisite when the wine is drawne into other vessels, not to let it run at the mouth of the vessels, but somewhat lower, that it stop not at the mouth, but haue some aire in the running out, least you feare it will become soure, which if you doubt, let it not take any aire, but make the vent of greene willowes, the barke or outward peele scraped cleane away: if you open the fat by day, you must beware that the heat of the sun touch not the wine, and if you open it by night, you must keepe the light of the Moone from it, and when the fats are emptie, you must wash them presently with salt water, and ashes, or drie them with clay yearth, if the wine be weake,
but if it be very strong, it is sufficient to close it vp on all sides, because the smell and strength of the wine preserueth the vessels.
Some tast wines when the wind bloweth in the North, but it is better to tast when it bloweth in the East, because the Eastwind moueth the wine more, and sheweth what it is.
It is not good to tast wine being fasting, because it spoileth the tast, neither is it good to tast it after much meat or drink.
Further, he that tasteth Wine, must not haue eaten any bitter or salt meat, nor haue eaten much, but a little meat, that it be disgested.
Some seeking to deceiue those that buy wine, take a new vessell, which they dip into old wine that is good, and hath a good smell, and then put that wine into it that they meane to sell, which set downe to giue you instructions that you be not deceiued.
How to know wines that will indure and continue long.
Herein you must haue care oftentimes to smell vnto your wines, least there bee any alteration in the lees, ingendring hoarines or white mouldines that groweth vnder the buts, or diners other like things, because that such things are signes that the wine decaieth, but if no such things appear, it is to be iudged that the wine will continue long.
and being cold, they tast it, and as they find that in the tast, so they esteeme the rest of the wine will fall out in goodnes, but it is requisite to tast the wine in the middle of the but.
It happeneth vnto wine by meanes of the corrupt waterishnes that is in the vines, or in the vessels, that it infecteth and spoileth by diuers meanes, wrought in it by the strange heat thereof, as you shall perceiue, for if there fal into it a little lees, or a little wine that hath lees in it, and bee put into the vessell without opening it, it will conuert into hoarines, and infect the wine: besides this, all other wine that is put into it, is thereby infected.
And if any of that wine be put into a good butt, or be mingled with other Wine, it doth infect it, and conuerteth it into the same corrupt nature: further, wine that is perfect good strong, especiallie that which is sweet aboue measure.
When the weather is hote, the vessel not being ful, and not close aboue, the heat and moistnes thereof issueth forth, the coldnes and drinesse therof remaining, whereby it turneth to be soure.
All wines doe oftentimes change in the rising of Charles waine, and in the Solstitio estinall, and in the dog daies, which commonly are called Cumma, and generally when the wind is Westwardly, and in heat, or frost, or in great
tempests, or by ouermuch wind, or by earthquakes, or thunders, or at the springing of roses and of vines.
Salt burned, and put into wine, doth keep it from changing, and that it boileth not vp more then it should, nor that it riseth with any great scum: put sweet almonds into black grapes, and letting them stand, they conserue the Wine.
Grapes being gathered, the kernels take~ forth and mixed with sand, and put into the Must, or wine being sodden, maketh it fat, and indure long.
Gesso when it is first put into the Wine maketh it bitter, but in time, the bitternesse goeth away, and the Gesso worketh this effect, that the wine indureth a long time, suffereth it not to change: the quantitie that must bee put in, if the wine bee small and of a humide tast, or troubled with tempests, is the hundreth part of Gesso.
But if it bee strong by reason of the strength, the halfe of an hundreth part of gesso will serue.
Wines that change being taken from their infected lees, and put vnto the lees of good wine, they will indure long.
Some men put into Wine the fruit of the Ledar tree, well brused to pouder, and therewith doe mingle gaules likewise brused to pouder.
Some beating the ashes of a vine being burnt, with fennel seed, mixing them together, doe put them into wine.
Others put the wine that changeth into other vessels, remoue it into another house, for if it be hurt by reason of heat, they remoue it into a fresher place, and if it spoile by reason of the
humiditie and coldnes of the place, where it is, they put it in some other place that is drier and hote Clay put into wine after it hath boiled, doth purge it, drawing downe with it the infection thereof into the lees, but if it be stamped it maketh the wine of good sauor, and sweet, because the birds that eat of it in winter time, are preserued thereby and liue, for it comforteth the wine and maketh it continue long.
little yuie both white and black put into wine, maketh it continue, the like doth sodden wine, mixing a third part thereof in the must.
The root of the pine tree, keepeth wine from changing.
An excellent infection to preserue wine, which is called Panaccia.
Take two ounces of Aloes, two ounces of insence, two ounces of amomo, bind all these fast in a linnen cloath, put them into the vessel after the wine is therein, and that it hath purged, and of this mixture, put into each vessell a measure called a cluchiero, full, then shake it out of the cloath, leaue the pouder in the wine, and three daies after do it again with roots of canes To keepe wine from changing.
Let it boile two or three daies in the grapes, draw it out in the month of Februarie, and of this boile the third part them together, then into twelue corses of wine put a common poringer ful of salt.
Or doe it in this sort, and it will be excellent and pleasant to drinke what wine soeuer it bee: scum the grapes, and all the Wine that is not boiled with the
grapes boile it on the fire, and scum it, and so put it in the vessell.
Temper wine that is turned or changed, with a good quantitie of hony, throwing it into the vessell wherein the wine is.
Then stir it in the butt with a sticke, at the bung, letting it remaine so, and the wine will cleare it selfe, by reason the honny maketh the dregs that are in the wine to descend into the bottome: it is good to put into the vessell where the wine is changed, (at the time when grapes are gathering) diuers berries of grapes, which shall lie therein in steed of the mother, because those grapes, after a certaine time, will turne the wine that is changed, to his right goodnes and sauor.
And before you doe any thing vnto wine that is changed, you must draw it foorth and take it from the infected lees.
Also put the wine into vessels out of the which wine hath ben newly taken forth, that it may clarefie therein, and let it remaine therein as long as it is needfull, but if there be any quantitie of wine, it must not bee done all at one time, but a little at once, that the wine doe not extinguish the heat of the grapes and hinder not the boiling thereof, wherein it clarefieth, and how little a time the Must continueth in the grapes, so much the stronger it worketh.
Wine is clarefied made good when you beat twentie graines of pepper and twentie pestachie, putting thereto a little wine, then
put afterward thereto sixe cesternes of Wine, hauing first stirred euery thing together, then letting them rest quietly, that they may worke, a foggie wine is presently cleare, if in a sexter of wine you put seuen kernels of a pine aple, stirring them often, and then letting them stand, by little and little the Wine will clarefie, that you may draw it and vse it.
Some clarefie it with white of egs, and with salt, but take white stones out of a riuer and bake them in an ouen till they begin to cracke, then beat them into pouder, take likewise white salt beaten into small pouder, and in a vessell of ten messers put six ounces of pouder of stones, foure of salt, and stirring them together, put the wine into the vessell, and if for euery measure you put therein two or three egs it will be good.
This may be done likewise with the same stones not baked, being beaten to small pouder, and without salt, and it shall bee good to put therevnto a little hony, because hony that is red, restoreth the colour of white wine that hath lost the colour, and hony is clammy, and heauy, and a preseruer of all liquors.
But if the wine bee ouer much troubled and thicke, put thereto a little more of each of the thinges aforesaid, because those things, by reason of the waight, do keepe downe the lees, and driue the thickenesse to the bottome that it can not so easily rise vp vnto the top and it giueth likewise no euill sauour to the wine.
But if the wine be so much troubled, that being as it were rank and in a maner fatty like oile, the naturall heat thereof being in a maner
wholy extinguished, then there is no remedie to be had, no more the~ for a dead man.
It will clarefy also in this maner, if you put into a vessel of forty measures, twentie egs, which you must beat wel in a basen or boule with a clean spoon, the~ put into them a poringer ful of Tartarum, mingle them together, adding thereto a little wine, then put it into the vessell, which done, stir them well at the bung with a clouen woodden stick, thrust it oftentimes downe into the lees, then put it againe into the vessel, and when it is clear take out al the thick matter on the sides of the vessell: but you must vnderstand, that into white wine you must only put white of egs, but into claret or red both whites yolks, and into Wine that is much troubled, you must put in more quantitie: further in place of Tartarum, you may put salt, and lastly there is put into the vessel a little clear water.
Wine is clarefied, and holpen of the il sauor changing, if in a vessel of three measures, you put halfe a pound of cleare roch alum, as much sucket of roses, with eight pounds of hony.
In this maner, seeth the honny very wel, skum it, when it is cold, put the Alum into it, being beaten into small pouder, and the sucket dissolued, which mingle all in a measure of wine, then put them into the vessell, stir them wel with a clouen stick, the vessell being open, let it stand so till the next day, the second or third day it will be cleare: but if the wine bee much troubled spoiled, put so much the more of the thinges aforesaid: neuertheles you must vnderstand that before you do it, you must draw
the Wine out into another vessell, and take it from the infected lees.
If wine be hoary or haue any other euil sauor, take a white grapes sprigs with the roots, and set it in the ground vnder the butt, in such sort that the roots may be right against the mouth vpon the butt, put the branches in the wine a handfull deepe, at the bung aboue the butt, let it stand there three daies, and till it looseth the euill sauor.
Some take a white grape branch put the head of it into the vessell in place of the bung, and set it on the ground, setting it fast that it stirreth not, and so the hoarines daily issueth forth by the branch, by which meanes the euil sauor deminisheth.
For the same, take Medlers that are bitter, being hanged on three or more pack thrids, put them in at the bung that they may descend into the wine, letting them remaine therein fifteene daies or a month, they remedie the wine the vessel of the hoarines.
It is said likewise it is done, if euery morning and euening there bee hanged in the wine a bundle of sage, that toucheth not the wine, and being taken out againe, wash it in water, stopping the bung well.
Take likewise a handfull of the hearbe called Nierella or Morella, and being bound with a little string, in the morning put it into the vessell at the bung, that it descend not into the wine aboue two fingers deep, and the cord being made fast vpon the vessell, stop the vessell hard, and let it hang
therein the space of one day, and at night take it out, putting other fresh hearbs therein, letting them remaine therein till the next day in the morning, which you must do for three or foure daies one after the other.
Those vessels that are hoarie are cured in this maner, put a quantitie of sleacked lime, into a butt of twelue baskets, and put into the same butt being stopped, either boiled water or wine, let it bee so well stopped that no aire issue forth.
Let it stand a little space, then roule it vp and downe diuers times: that done, open it, and let the liquor that is in it issue forth, wash the butt againe with cold water.
Or otherwise, put gineper (being sodden in a chaldron of wine, and that is seething hote) into the vessels, do as said before, and it will bee better, if both the remedies be vsed one after the other, that is, the second after the first.
In the same maner the fats are remedied, but because they cannot bee stopped in such sort as the buts may be, they are couered with clothes, so that they cannot send foorth any aire: the buts are preserued from mouldinesse, if when they are to be emptied, they stand open vntill there bee but a smal quantitie of wine in them, and that they bee very well dried, and after that well washed with salt water, or wine, or else not emptieng foorth that little quantitie of Wine that is in them, the butt being wel stopped, that the smell or sent may not issue forth.

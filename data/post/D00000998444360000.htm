THAT NOBLE PHIlosopher Plato (right VVorshipfull) had not attempted so often the seas from Athens to Sicilia had it not beene for his friende Dion neyther hadde learned Apollonius sustayned the heate of Ripheus nor the cold of Caucasus to trauell from Rome vnto India had it not beene for his companion Hiarchus
Suche is the force of affection, the attempt of friendeshippe, and the secret search of nature, that vvere it possible that the same (sayth Cicero might ascende the skies to vevve the glorie of the Sunne, the state of the Starres, and to beholde the beauty of the heauens, vnsvveete vvere the admiration thereof, vnlesse it might bee imparted to friendes.
Such is the violence of hidden loue, after long lurcking in the intrailes of the heart, that by force seeketh meanes by some outvvard shevv of seruice to reueale the fostered flames therof to his professed friende: by vvhose continuall mocions and restlesse rage vvas more alured by good vvill than by vvit or learning persvvaded to manifest the fruite thereof vnto your VVorshippe, as to the onely Mecaenas chosen Patron of this my enterprise, vvhich though more bolde than vvise, more rash than learned, yet hope more vvilling than able of your vvorship adiudged, vvhich like a Greeke Demetrius or a Romane Scipio by some secret sleight of vertue mooued in me most ardent loue, incredible desire and singuler affection to accomplish some charge, as a publicke pleadge of my true and faythfull heart.
So for the clemencie of countenaunce, the facility of speach, the excellencie of nature, vvhich in some are more apparaunt than in others, doe euen as the Adamant dravve vp the heauie and lumpishe yron, enflame the barren and luntish braineman to a farre further charge, than other learning maye suffice good vvill therein· Most vvilling to auoyde the gulfe of Charibdis hee slideth in Scilla and seeking to shunne Semphlagades he sincketh in Syrtes
Hovvbeit, good vvill the vvorthiest revvarde, the chiefest treasure and the greatest gift that the seruaunt can yeelde vnto his maister, the subiect vnto his Prince, or one man vnto another, vvhich as Demosthenes sayth, ought as keis of treasures, bulvvarkes of Cities, defence of countries, and staye of states, bee vvaied and esteemed.
Suche did Phocion onely accept in Athens vvhen hee refused the offered treasures of the great Alexander
Such did Epaminondas require in Thebes vvhen he renounced the princelie giftes of Artaxerxes
Suche did Fabritius craue in Rome vvhen he denied the vvelthye revvardes of King Pirrhus And suche trust your vvorshippe doe vvaye of your vvell vviller, though of others better are tendered: for more holesome it is (sayth Plini for some to drinke small vvine out of Samos earthen vessell, than strong poyson out of the golden cuppe of Nero: better it is to drinke colde vvater out of faythfull Sinaetes hand, than svveete Nectar out of the infected cuppe of Cirses and farre more sure is the good vvill of the faythfull, than the tendered treasure of the flatterer, vvhich like a Melitian dogge fauning on euery man, altering himselfe vnto all kinde of coulers vvith the Camaelien, and shifting himselfe vnto sundrie shapes vvith Protheus vvill hault vvith Clisophus before Phillippe dissemble vvith Aristodemus beefore Antigonus vvith Aristippus before Dionisius: and in deceyue Caesar vvith Curio

But in examining the state of Princes, vvaying their pilgrimages in this toyling Labyrinthus, vve see their fortune as variable, as they themselues are mutable.
VVee reade that some from base birth vvere aduaunced vnto emperiall dignitie, as Gordius from the Plough became King in Phrigia and Giges from a Shepheard vvas made King in Lidia So vve read that some from regall seates vvere exiled their kingdom, as Torquinius Superbus from Rome, and Dionisius from Sicilia
It is not straunge to the learned, that Tullius Hostilius from keeping of Cattell became a King in Rome, and that famous Zerxes the great King of Persea vvas vanquished by that simple manne Artabanus
VVhat vvoonder is it if Cirus vvas nourished by a Bytche to be a King in Persea sith Prutias from a king in Bithinia beecame a begger in Asia
If Romulus from an abiect brought vp by a vvoolfe vvas buried so princely in Rome, vvhat meruayle is it that Pompeius being so renovvmed, shoulde be buried in the sandes of Egypt If Alexander the great, Iulius Caesar, Hanibal, Iugurth vvith infinite moe vvere suppressed and deiected from their high thrones vnto miserie and penurie? It is not straunge that Agathocles the potter, Iustinius the svvinehearde, yea, Archilaus borne of a shoulde be aduaunced vnto regall seate.
That sage Greke therfore Pittach{us} in the temples of Mittilena depainted a brode ladder vvhere some did ascend and some discend, to notifie the state of fortune.

Hovv happy is he that sayleth by Scilla vvithout daunger, that passeth by Ciclops dennes vvithout perill, that goeth vnto Lotophagos and not hindered, that drinketh vvith Cirses and not infected, that heareth the Cirenes and not allured: In fine, that entereth vnto hell and not conuicted: yea tvvise happye is that contented man, vvho hauing nothing, possesseth all thinges, and hauing all thinges, possesseth nothing.
By this onely Biton the siely argiue vvas preferred before Cirus king of Persea by Solon By this Aglaus the poore Arcadian vvas aduaunced before Cressus King of Lidia by Apollo
And by this onely vvas Gangeticus vvoont to say that hauing but bread and vvater, he vvoulde not chaunge life vvith Iupiter for had that renovvmed Pirrhus beene contented vvith the kingdome of Epire he had neuer beene slaine by a simple vvoman at Argos
Had Siphax beene satisfied vvith all the dominion of Numidia he had neuer died a captiue in Rome
And had that great conquerour Alexander beene sufficed vvith one vvorld, he had neuer vvept vvhen he heard that there vvere diuers vvorlds.

Desire vnto fame made Iuli{us} Caesar to enuy the marshall monumentes of Alexander in Gades made Alexander vveepe at the fame of Achilles in Phrigia, made Achilles crie out at the renovvme of These{us} in Greece, and made These{us} starke mad at the enterprises of Hercules in al places.
And vvhy vvas Antigon{us} disdained? for his politick vvisdome: so that Plini saith most true, that there is no light vvithout shadovve, nor no vertue vvithout enuy.
VVhich if your vvorship sometime bestovv your selfe to reade some booke or other, you shall in reading diuers bookes, knovv and perceaue the causes thereof, for as the Bee gathereth of some hearbe Gumme, of another the refuse of VVaxe, of an other Honye: so in reading diuers bookes, diuers profites, of Rethoricke, the vvaye of persvvation of Logicke, the sleight of reason, of histories, the orders of countreys, of Philosophy, the secretes of nature, and of diuinitie the path of life: vvherefore Alphonsus the great King of Aragon being a long time sicke in Capua, geuing him selfe to reade Titus Liuius of the marshall feates of Romans and Q. Curti{us} of the noble actes of Alexander the great, hauing thereby recouered his health, vvas vvoont to say that he neuer hearde better Musicke then he hearde in Liuie nor neuer had better Phisick then he had in Curtius.
August{us} Caesar therfore vvould neuer be vvithout Virgil in hande, nor Alexander the great vvithout Homer vnder his Pillovv.
Happy vvas Pompeius vvhen hee had Cicero in his bosome, and glad vvas Scipio vvhen he had Enneus in his sight: yea Dionisius the tiraunt vvoulde honour Plato and Antigonus the cruell, geue place to Zeno
So as Alphonsus saide, there is no svveeter Musicke then in reading, there is no better Phisicke then in reading, and there is no sounder counsell then in reading.
There is mirth, there is sadnesse, there is vvisedome and knovvledge, there is persvvasion, and there is vvarning: vvhich if your vvorship do folovve but Appelles sayinges vnto his schollers, that no day shoulde passe vvithout the reading of one line, or to imitate Hortensius sometime of the day either to reade, aske, or to learne something.

Thus doing your vvorship shall encrease in knovvledge, multiply your freendes, aduaunce your fame, and enioy felicitie of life.
VNvvise much vvere beeing base and barren, if thought to escape that which Homer that sweete and sugred Mecaenas of Greece might in no wise auoyde.
Simple were to seeke to auoyde that which the wisest and the learnedst Socrates and Architas coulde not shunne: therefore euen as the Rhodians and the Lacedemonians in the games of Olimpia were taunted of Diogenes the one for their brauerie, the other for their raggednesse: so these Cinikes sortes finde faulte with the good aswell as the badde.
Lucullus a noble Romane demaunded of the Philosopher Seneca what best he might doe to please Nero the Emperour, and not to offende the common people, had in aunswere, to doe much seruice vnto Princes, and to vse little taulke, and to shewe humanitie vnto the commons: Knowing well gentle Reader, how ready the most part are to accuse the learned, and hovv fewe are willing to excuse the ignorant, am contented rather to be reprehended for my good will in penning this pilgrimage of Princes, than to be commended by that vvhich may prooue my ydle lyfe by silence.
Being mindefull of the youth of Egypt how they shoulde make account vnto their magistrates of paine and trauell, most willing to accomplish some,thing that might discharge the same, tooke this laboure in hande, in that, that coulde to the vttermost to benifite my countrie, to pleasure my friendes, and to shewe my selfe more willing than able in performing the same: and though in my rashenesse presume to write of the liues of Princes, yet trust in gathering the fragments broken sentences, as a beginning vnto others that are better stored, it vvill be of the vvise and learned considered, though of others defamed and taunted.
For there is no booke sayth Plini so simple, but it profiteth some body, for in bookes sayde Chilo the Philosopher are the fame of vvorthie men eternized, and the veritie of thinges etere vnknovvne wvritten, vvhich tvvo thinges neyther time can consume, nor fortune destroy, and for this cause were the bones of Homer sought and contended for of seuen Cities in Greece to be buried and kept as a monument of so great a vvriter, and for this vvas Euripides dying in Macedonia sent for by embassadors of Athens to bee hadde in memorie as a prayse vnto Athens by his buriall For the Greekes supposed the greatest honour of all to haue educated such men as vvere studious and carefull for their countrie.
For greater is the attempt of any simple booke writer to hazarde himselfe to present perill to encounter with diuers men with a pen in his hande, then that that valiaunt Perithus with Cerberus or Theseus vvith Minotaurus yea, or Hercules with Antheús iollie champions vvith swordes drawne: for that they fought vvith one a peece, and that before their faces, the simple writer with thousandes, and they behinde his backe slaunder him.
Architas the Philosopher, whome the Tarentines made a general in their warres sixe seueral times, he saye vvas in no such daungers in his vvarres, as hee was resisted for his rules and lawes in Tarentum.
Plato vvas not in such perill at the besieging of Tanagra and Corinth amongst all his enimies, as he vvas enuied in Greece by Zenophon and Aristotle his ovvne schollers by his Philosophie.
Neyther vvas Socrates in such hazarde of life being in armes in Delphos as he vvas in Athens by vvriting of bookes put to death by the Greekes.
Zeno the poore Philosopher coulde resist the violence of the great king Antigonus Demosthenes could vvithstand the force of Philip and yet neyther of them coulde auoyde the snares of those that defamed their labour, enuied their diligence in vvriting and making of bookes.
Simple men must not therefore be discomfited to vvrite bicause the vvise and learned vvere herein euill spoken: For the Gimnosophistes in India, the Prophetes in Egypt, the Sages in Persea the Ephori in Lacedemonia the Chaldeans in Babilon and the Philosophers in Greece are novv more famous and renovvmed being deade, then they being a liue vvere enuied and slaundered, their vvritinges and bookes more read novve, than alovved or knovvne then, they rtrauell novve is commended, though their liues then vvere despised.
And therefore vvish all learned vvere as vvilling to vvrite, as the most part of ignoraunt are studious and carefull to finde faultes.
VVherfore crauing the good vvill of the learned reader as a bovvlster and defence to my simple trauell, ende, vvishing that both the Printers faultes and mine might lesse mooue occasions of offence.

FOrtune, the Treasurer of the worlde, that ruleth realmes, ouercommeth kingdomes, oppresseth kinges, exalteth Tyrauntes, and doth to whom she will giue lyfe, and to whom she hateth appoint death.
What honour she gaue to some, what honour she tooke from others.
How she exalted base me~, how she oppressed proude Princes Histories do recorde.
All the Kings that euer raigned in Rome, almost from base birth and slender progenie, were aduaunced by fortune to sit in royall Rome, and enioy princely Scepters.
Romulus the first King and builder of Rome, borne of Rhea a Uestall Uirgine, and daughter vnto Amulius left as a pray vnto beastes, forsaken of all Rome, hated of his owne grandfather, that he founde more friendship in a shée Woolfe then hée had at his grandfather Amulius: more kindnesse of the Woolfe for his nourishment, then loue of his mother, though he was borne of her.
Notwithstanding, contrary to the expectation of Amulius not thought of in Rome, by fortunes fauour, he was by the Woolfe preserued, and by a poore shéepe brought vp to be a King of Rome.
The like happened vnto Cyrus at thrée dayes olde, when hée was commaunded by his grandfather king Astiages to be drowned and deliuered vnto Harpagus chiefe officer about Astiages by King Astiages owne hande to be killed and destroyed: yet by fortune, a Bitche (being likewise left as Romulus was) fed him, and mylkt him, gaue him life whe~ his parentes appointed death for him, brought vp by a Bitche (beyng a banished infant) to be the firste and most renowmed King that euer raigned in Persia
Euen so of Paris King Priamus sonne, called likewise Alexander the like commaunded he shoulde in all haste being borne, bée killed: which being preserued by fortune, was brought vp by a beare, to be a famous Phrigian Prince.
Thus Cirus by fortune found friendship more in a bitch the~ in his own mother: Romulus more loue in a Woolfe then in all Rome: Alexander more kindnesse in a Beare then in his father Priamus
To speake of Telephus the sonne of Hercules fostered by a Hart.
To speake of Camilla and Semyramis the one brought vp by a Mare, the other by birdes of the ayre, to be such famous Quéenes, as the one ruled the Volskans the other ye Babylonians
How fortune appointed litle Antes to féede King Midas and Bées to féede Plato the wealth of the one, the eloquence of the other did certifie the same: but to declare first the extolling and aduauncement of simple and base men vnto princely seates.
Torquinus Priscus a straunger borne in Corinth the sonne of one named Demaratus a banished marcha~t from his country, became a famous King in Rome: yea so famous say, that he enlarged the confines of Italy, amplified the wealth and state of Rome, augmented the number of the Senatours, encreased the order of Knighthood, and left Rome so happy at his death, that the Citizens thereof would twise haue trauailde as farre as Corinth to spéede of so noble a Prince.
Tullius Seruius a poore straunger, likewise aduaunced vnto the same place by fortune: and Tullius Hostilius a shéepheard, and from féeding of beastes, extolled to be likewise King of Rome.
Thus fortune to shewe her might, exalteth the poore, and oppresseth the proude.
Thus from banished straungers, from simple shéepheardes, appointed she famous Princes and noble Kinges: fortune elected Senatours, appointed Consuls, made Tribunes Censors.
Fortune as Seneca saith, from lowe birth, and base condicions, made Princes: Fortune had them from the Plough to sitte in seate of Kinges: Fortune tooke Gordius from his Plough to be a King in Phrygia: Fortune tooke Agathocles from his fathers Shop being a Potter, and made him King in Sycilia: she brought Darius from the Stable of Cyrus to be a King in Persia: she brought Giges from a shéepehearde to be the welthiest king that euer raigned in Lydia: She spared no place, without respect to any man.
Iustinus a swineheard, from féeding of his swine, became a mightie Emperour of Constantinople.
And Carpenters likewise may bragge of Telephanes which fortune aduaunced to the kingdome of Lydia
Shall not husbandmen extoll fortune, which made Valentianus Emperour in Rome? Howe much fortune fauoured learning, howe she brought the greatest Princes in the worlde to honour simple men, and caused the cruell tyrauntes to estéeme and reuerence the same.
That king Dionisius the wicked tyraunt of Sycilia when he heard that diuine and noble Philosopher Plato was comming vnto Sycilia made certen of his Nobles to go méete him on the Sea, in a Ship so brauely appointed, so gorgeously dressed with sayles of purple silke to bring him a lande, where Dionisius him selfe taryed his comming in his golden Chariot, with foure white Horses trapped ouer with gold, tooke him vnto his owne Chariot princly, talked vnto him reuerently, vsed him honourably, so entertained him, that if Iupiter had descended from Skie, greater honour coulde hée not get in Créete, then Plato a poore philosopher Aristons sonne of Athence got in Sicilia
Aristotle borne in Stagira a poore Phisitions sonne named Nichomacus merited suche fame by fortune, that not onely Philip King of Macedonia thanked God that his sonne Alexander was borne in his time, vnder whose tuition Alexander fiue yeres learned Philosophie, but also Alexander the great conquerer of the worlde honoured and saluted him as his Maister, vnto whom he sayde that he was no lesse bounde for his learning vnto Alexander and vertuous education, then he was vnto king Philip his father for his birth, he shewed the same being in India, a countrey farre from Gréece, and in the middest of his great warres vnto his maister, writing the state of India, the successe of his iourneys, the prodigious and monstrous sightes that Alexander sawe vnto Aristotle
That mightie Artaxerxes king of Persia hearing of the fame of that learned Hippocrates did sende vnto the chiefe gouernour of Hellespont earnest letters for Hippocrates promising in writing great honours, equalitie to the chiefe rulers of Persea fellowe and friende to myghtie Artaxerxes
Thus fortune was not onely honoured as a goddesse in Antium but also worshipped in all the worlde: thus euery man toyleth for fortune, goeth a pilgrimage for fortune.
remember of a worthy Historie of one Rhodope a faire and a gorgeous strumpet in Egypt which fortune so fauoured for her beautie, that she being a washing her selfe in a well, an Eagle fled with one of her shoes vnto the famous City of Memphis where then the king of Egypt kept his Courte, named Psamnetichus before whom the Eagle let the shoe fall.
The king dismaide at the beautie of the shoe, amazed of the working thereof, musing muche howe nature myght frame so fine a foote, made open proclamation throughout all Egypt to séeke suche a woman whose foote serued that shoe, and being found, to bring her to the king: and being brought to the king, she was maryed vnto the king.
Thus from a co~mon woman, fortune appointed an Eagle to make her a Quéene in Egypt
If fortune fauoured suche that was naught of life, slaunderous of report, ignominious and infamous in all Egypt to be a Quéene in that kingdome where she was a queane, who should make much of suche a dame, in whom neither constancie was euer founde, or trueth euer tryed.
iudge that man most fortunate, that is of all least fortunate: and sith fortune is deceitfull to her owne friendes, she can not be true vnto her foes: therefore, very learnedly did wise Bion aunswere being demaunded, what was most daungerous in the worlde, to be most fortunate.
Phocion that learned Athenian was woont to say, that better it were to lie carelesse vpon the grounde, safe and sounde, then to lie carefully vnder cloth of states in daunger and perill.
certen wise prince, before he should be crowned king, tooke the Crowne firste as Valerius saieth in his hande, saying after looking musing a while: Crowne, more noble than happy, whose peryll to enioye (if men knew) no man woulde take thée vp from the grounde, though thou diddest offer thy selfe.
What felicitie happened vnto Alexander the great, which fortune so aduaunced to be a King of kinges, a conquerour of conquerours: yea, to be worshipped as a god, and to be called the sonne of Iupiter whose fame compassed the whole earth, in so muche that Thalestris Quéene of the Amazons came from Sythia vnto Hircania with thrée hundred thousand women to lye with Alexander thirtie dayes, to be with childe by him: and yet in Babylon that fortune that so exalted him, did likewise oppresse him, being in his chief fame but thirtie two yeres, poysoned by his kinsmen and friendes, left and forsaken of all men, that he was thirtie dayes vnburied, as a begger, not as a king: as a beast, not like Iupiters sonne.
The lyke fortune serued Iulius Caesar whiche after thundring clang of the lyke fame, was in his owne Citie of Rome, and in the Senate house amiddest his Councellours slayne and murthered so tyrannouslye with Bodkins and Daggers of his most trustie friendes Brutus and Cassius that he had twentie and thrée woundes in his body.
Thus was the misfortunate end of so fortunate a beginning.
How did fortune deale with famous Zerxes whose huge armies dryed vp riuers, whose infinite numbers of Nauayes couered ouer the Ocean Seas, whose power and force all Gréece trembled at: fortune that promised al Gréece vnto him at a becke, she saye, gaue him ouer to the handes of Pericles his enimie, to bée vanquished, vnto the force of Artabanus to bée slaine.
litle better she vsed Mithridates King of Pontus after many victories in diuers countreyes, noble tryumphes sundry times, which fortie yeres and moe she mainteyned against the inuincible Romanes, to the great detriment and losse of Rome: and at length to his great discomfort, after he had lost wife, children, and all his friendes, lefte him in his olde age a pray vnto Pompeius
This is the friendship of fortune, to plague to punish those which oftentimes she sheweth her selfe most curteous vnto.
Therfore was Plato woont to thank God that he was borne a man, not a beast: in Gréece, not in Barbary, thanked fortune, that he was a scholler vnto Socrates which wayes despised fortune and her force: for fortune neuer doth a good déede, but she requiteth ye same with an euill turne.
Pyrrhus that valiant king of Epyres whom so famously fortune guided, that he was counted by Hanibal the seconde souldier and Prince for his magnanitie and courage vnto Alexander the great, whose ende by fortune was such, that a siely simple argiue woman kilde hym with a litle Tilestone.
Hanibal whose name was so terrible vnto Rome, by fortune .xvj. yeres, was by the same driuen to exile, a banished abiect from his cou~trey, and wéery of his life, ended his dayes with poyson in Bithinia Alcibiades which fortune so fauoured one way, that hée excelled all men in personage and birth, in wisdome and honour, in strength and wealth, and in all kinde of vertues, surmounting all Gréece: againe, was brought to suche banishment and penurie, to suche infamie and reproche, that hée was compassed and taken of his enimies, burned in his bed with his whore called Timandra.
Cambises and Nero whose cruell and vnhappy dayes, both Rome and Persia long time felt: their fawning fortune, after much tyranny bloodshed of others, was such, that beyng wéery in murtheryng others, they siue them selues, that was the ende of their fortune.
Polycrates who euer sayled with prosperous windes of fortune, that hée was taken and named fortunate Polycrates at length so serued of fortune (as other Princes were) he was hanged by one Orontes an officer of king Darius in open sight of Samos where he a long time florished, and in the ende hanged on a high hyll named Mycalensis mount.
These euyls happen by fortune, yet wée sée them not: she gripes vs with her handes, yet we féele not: she treadeth vs downe vnder her féete, and yet we wyll not know it.
Happy is he that accompanieth not with fortune, though diuers thinke them selues happy that be fortunate, as Giges Cressus two Kinges of Lydia so wealthy, that they iudged no man as happye as they were: and yet was Aglaus the poorest in all Arcadie Byton the simplest of all Gréece: the one by the sentence of Solon the other by the oracle of Apollo iudged farre more happy then they.
The very tyraunt Dionisius being banished from his kingdome of Corinth woulde often say in his miserie, that happy twise were they that neuer knew fortune, whose fawning face in the beginning, doth purchase cruell death in
Wherfore, a certaine Lacedemonian saide, Diagoras who being in the games of Olimpia in Gréece, hauing his children, his childrens children crowned with Garlandes of fame, for their vertuous actes and qualities that time, that it were great happe vnto him to dye presently at such a sight of his childrens fortune: and being asked the cause, he sayde that fortune neuer pleased that man so much with fame, but she woulde in time displease the same as muche with infamie, and moste true it was spoken vnto one of the thirtie tyrauntes, which being in banquet with diuers nobles gentles when the house fell, and slue them all: yet he, this tyraunt escaped, braggyng much of his fortune that he so saued him selfe: a simple man sayde vnto him, Neuer boast of fortune at any tyme, for that she spareth thée nowe, she wyll the next time more sharply plague thée, which so came to passe, that his fleshe was made a foode vnto his horses, and his bloodde drincke appointed for them, that in sparyng his death then, when the house fell, hée was afterwarde requited as you hearde.
If fortune, whose waueryng steppes are neuer certayne, were as little trusted of the most part, as shée is most deceitfull and false vnto all men, then Cicero woulde not haue spoken that they that seke fortune, are blinder then fortune, shée neuer aduaunced any to dignitie, but shée suppressed the same againe vnto misery, as Tarquinius the prowde, a King that fortune made famous diuers wayes, of princely progenye, of passing parsonage, of incredible beautie, and of all noble qualities, to whome shée presented Lucrecia, wyfe, as the onelye snare to catche him, and to take him, by whome he was depriued from hys gouernement, left his kingdome and banished out of Rome, to raunge countries in miserie and payne, after long felicitie and pleasure: euen so Dionisius king of Siracusa after many princely pleasures, renowned fame, great glory, yet in the ende, banished his countrie, and driuen to kéepe schoole in Italie.
In the lyke sort, shée deceyued that noble and valiaunt Scipio, Affricanus whose prowesse and magnanimitie augmented muche the fame of Romanes, by conquering of Affrike and Carthage and notwithstanding, driuen to exilement and miserye, where he dyed after many triumphes and victories like a poore begger.
And bicause fame followeth fortune, and proceedeth from fortune, as the smoke commeth from the fire: for as fortune is variable, so is fame diuers.
If we séeke histories, we finde the fame of poore men for theyr pouertie, aswell as the riche, for all their riches: poore Codrus and ragged Irus are as famous in respect béeing beggers, with Poetes· as Mydas or Cressus two famous and welthie Kinges of India are mencioned of Plutarch
Doth not Aristophanes make as much me~tion of Cleonimus the Coward, as Homer doth make of Achylles the stoute, Poliphemus and Enceladus two huge monstrous Giaunts: are not so famous in Virgill for their bignesse, as Conopas or Molon two little dwarfes of two foote length, are renowmed in Plini for their smalnesse.
Iuuenall and Claudian report no lesse of the little Pigmeis, than Ouid or Maro of the huge Ciclopes
If fame procéede of poore men for pouertie, of dwarfes for their smalenesse, of cowardes for their cowardenesse, as muche as it doeth flowe of riche men, for their wealth, of Giauntes for theyr bignesse, and of stoute men for their courage: What is it but a pilgrimage, we liue and trauayle here, for fortune and fame runne togither as diuers as they are vncertaine.
Plini that famous Histographer, writeth of one named Messala which was so forgetfull and weake of memory, that he forgat his owne name, and yet as famous for his obliuiosnesse, as Hortensius was renowmed for that he coulde pronounce out of hande with his tongue that which he wrote with his penne.
Seneca the philosopher commendeth one called Caluisius that hée likewise was so obliuious, that he could not often name those daylye friendes that hée vsed companye withall.
What greater fame coulde Cyneas haue for all his memorie when hee was sent from King Pirrhus as Embassadour vnto Rome, where the seconde day, in the Senate house before all the people of Rome, he named all the Senatours by name.
What greater renowme coulde King Cirus haue for his noble memory, for naming euery souldier of his by name, beyng in ye Campe? What fame hath King Mithradates for his diuers and sundry languages, whiche without an interpretour coulde speake vnto .xxij. nations, being his souldiers, but onely that they are recorded in bookes, where likewise Caluisius, Messala and suche obliuious men that forget their owne names, are put in writing.
Doth not Homer the Trunpettour of fame, write of Melitides an Idiote, that woulde after the destruction of Troy, and after King Priamus all his were slaine, yet he then would come to succour ye Troyans.
Homer say doth not forget Melitides no more then he doth Agamemnon
What shoulde speake of siely and simple Herostratis whiche for burnyng of the Temple of Diana is euerlastingly remembred, and myllyons more of the lyke, whiche are mentioned of auncient writers.
What is fame then, but a memorie of thinges past.
Of magnanimitie of Princes, and fortitude of minde, vvhere and vvhen it vvas most esteemd.
EUen as Iustice without temperaunce is often counted iniurie, so magnanimitie without respect vnto prudence is tirannye.
This vertue procéedeth from a valiaunt and a sober minde, ioyning both the body and minde togither, that wisedome and pollicye of the one, the strength and courage of the other, bée alwayes redye to defende the cause of his countrey, the quarell of his Prince, and societie of fréendship: vnto this therefore, vnto his Prince, countrey, and fréendes, any good man is borne, preferryng common commodities before priuate wealthe.
Hercules being yet a young man, musing muche what he myght best do, thus studiyng and pondering to what he shoulde applye his noble minde, appeared vnto hym two taule goodly women, the one as Zenophon doth describe, very gorgeous and braue, ringes of golde on her fingers, a chaine of golde about her necke, her heares set and frisled with Pearles, and Diamondes hangyng at her eares: the other in sober and comely apparell of modest behauiour, of shamefaste countenaunce, stoode before him.
The first saide, Hercules if thou wilt serue me, thou shalt haue golde and siluer enough, thou shalt féede daintily, thou shalt liue princely, thou shalt enioye pleasures, possesse mirth, In fine, thou shalt haue all things at thy wyll to liue with ease and rest.
The other sayde with comely countenaunce, if thou wilt serue me Hercules thou shalt be a victor of conquerers, thou shalt subdue kingdomes, and ouerthrowe kinges: thou shalt be vnto fame, renowmed in all the worlde, and shalt deserue praise of men and women: Whiche when Hercules sawe and hearde the offers of these two launcing Ladyes, vnderstandyng the idle seruice of the firste, and the exercise of the seconde, tooke her as his maistrisse, to whome hée wyllyng became her man.
Whereby, according vnto promise made, enioyed fully the fame and praise by due desertes.
That magnanimitie had Hercules that ouercame Lions, Dragons, Beares, and such monstrous huge wilde beastes, that dyd destroy kingdomes and countreys.
That fortitude of minde had Hercules that conquered Giauntes, and subdued Tyraunts, enlarged liberties, set frée captiues and prisoners: and briefly, that magnanimitie was in Hercules that hée neuer offended iuste men, hée neuer hurted innocent men, hée preserued diuers kinges and countreys, he neuer spoyled good countrey, nor subdued a iust king: therefore, wholy addicted to merite fame, In destroying the Serpent Hydra the Priapus the Lion, the wild Bore and terrible Bull.
In conqueryng Gereon, Cerberus and Diomedes cruell Tyrauntes: In takyng the gylted Hart, in vanquishing the Centaures and the rauenyng Birdes named Stymphalides was there any tyranny or cruel attempts in this his .xij. enterprices? Well, let Hercules passe, who was as they say, more ayded of the gods then helped of man.
With these princely actes renowmed feates of Hercules was noble Thesius much enamored, insomuch he aemulated the vertuous life of Hercules that he tamed wylde beastes, slue monsters, ouercame cruell tyraunt of Thebes went downe as the Poet saith vnto hell, to imitate Hercules feates, to resemble Hercules magnanimitie, to augment Theseus fame, creating alters, appointyng sacrifice in memorie of Hercules hoping that others woulde doe vnto Theseus as Theseus dyd vnto Hercules
Next vnto Theseus for antiquitie of time, that valiaunte and renowmed Gréeke Achilles the onely stay and comfort of his countrey, the verye hope of all Gréece, whose magnanimitie, valiaunt courage, worthy actes, and famous life is at large set foorth in Homers Iliades which Homer, Alexander the great, by the reading of the manhood of Achilles being yet in his fathers dayes brought vp in schoole, with that learned Philosopher Aristotle so estéemed, that hée neuer went to bed, but that he had Homer vnder his pillowe, and there fell in loue with the prowesse of Achilles honoured his life, and magnified his death: in so much hée went vnto Ilion in Phrygia where that famous Citie of Troy sometime stoode, to sée the graue of Achilles where, when hée came and sawe the worthye monumentes, his marshall chiualrie, his famous feates and renowmed lyfe depaynted aboute the Temple, enuironed and compassed about his sumptuous tombe, he brake out in gushing teares, beholding the tombe, saying: happie Achilles to happen on suche a Homer that so well coulde aduaunce thy fame.
And thus Alexander being mooued by Homer to imitate Achilles wayed nothing else but magnanimitie and courage of minde, as Curtius and Diodorus Siculus can well testifie, whose lyfe though it was but short, was a mirrour vnto all the world, that being but twentie yeares when he began to enuie the actes feates of Achilles that in twelue yeres more, which were his whole time of life, he became King ouer Kings, a conquerour ouer conquerours, that he was named an other Hercules for his prosperous successe in his enterprises: insomuch, that Iulius Caesar the first and most valiaunt Emperor that euer was in Rome, at his great co~quests, entering into the Temple of Hercules in Gades reading the lyfe of Alexander printed rounde about the Temple, hys worthie fame depainted, his noble déedes set foorth, hys victories and conquestes in euery place described, suche monumentes and myrrours in memorye of his noble life, that Caesar fell vnto the like teares for Alexander as Alexander did for Achilles
Thus one in loue with the other for magnanimitie sake, eche one desirous of others fame, as Caesar thought him selfe happie if he might bee counted Alexander, Alexander iudged himselfe renowmed, if he might be named Achilles, Achilles sought no greater fame then Theseus, Theseus euer desired the name of Hercules
Therefore Agesilaus King of the Lacedemonians wondering muche at the singuler magnanimitie and force of Epaminondas Prince sometime of Thebes who with one little City coulde subdue all Gréece.
This Epaminondas hauing warres with the Lacedemonians people no lesse renowmed by warre, then iustlye feared by Epaminondas after great victories and triumphes had by this Prince, was after this sort preuented by Agesilaus in the wars of Mantinia that al the people of Sparta were counceled eyther to kill Epaminondas or to be kilde by Epaminondas whereby the whole force and power of Lacedemonia were fully bent by commaundement, gyuen by Agesilaus their King, to fall vpon Epaminondas where that valiaunt and noble Prince by to much pollicy was wounded to death, to the spoyle and murther of all the people of Thebes and yet a liue caried vnto his tent, demaunded of his souldiours the state of the fielde, whether Thebes or Sparta was conquered, being certified that the Lacedemonians fledde, and that he had the victorye, he foorthwith charged the ende of the speare to be taken out of his side and wounde, saying, Nowe your Prince Epaminondas beginneth to liue, for that he dyeth a Conquerour: wée reade not skant of Epaminondas mate, which being compared vnto Agamemnon for his magnanimitie, was angrie therewith, saying, Agamemnon with all Gréece with him, was .x. yeres about one towne, the Citie of Troye, Epaminondas with little Thebes in one yeare conquered all Gréece.
This order was amongst the Lacedemonians before they shoulde go vnto warres, they were by lawe charged to make solemne sacrifice vnto the Muses, and being demaunded why they so did, sith Mars hath no societie with the Muses: Eudamidas then their King aunswered, for that we might attaine aswell of the Muses, how to vse victorie gently, as of Mars to become victors manfully.
These Lacedemonians were so valiant that hauing banished their King Cleonimus for his passing pride and great violence, making Areus to raigne as a King.
This Areus being in Créete ayding the people of Corcyra in warres with the most part of the Citizens of Sparta this Cleonimus their exiled King, consulted with Pirrhus King of Epyre perswading then or neuer to conquere Sparta considering Areus was in Créete, that Sparta was not populus to defende any strength, came both and pitcht thir fielde in open face of Sparta assuring themselues both to be at supper in Cleonimus house.
The Citizens perceyuing the great army of Pirrhus thought good by night to sende their women vnto Créete to Areus making themselues ready to die manfully in resisting the hoast of the enimie: and being thus in the Senate agréeing, that the womankinde shoulde passe awaye that night, least theyr nation at that time shoulde be quite destroyed by Pirrhus then rushed a great number of women in harnesse, of the which Archidamia made an Oration to the menne of Sparta much blaming their entent, and quite confounded their purpose, saying, Thinke you (O Citizens of Sparta that your wiues and daughters woulde liue if they might, after the death of their husbandes, and destruction of Sparta beholde howe readye we are, howe willing the women of Sparta will die and liue with theyr husbandes, Pirrhus shall well féele it and knowe this daye.
No maruayle that the broode of these women shoulde be valiaunt and stoute: If Demosthenes, who so muche, was estéemed in Athens had sayde in Sparta that which he wrote in Athens that they which sometime ranne awaye shoulde fight againe: he shoulde haue the like rewarde that Archilogus had for that he wrote in his booke, that it was sometime better to caste the buckler away, than to die, he was banished the confines of Lacedemonia
At what time the Citie of Sagunto was destroyed, against promise of the people of Carthage
The renowmed Romanes though league was broken and peace defied: yet the Senators did sende Ambassadours, Eabius Maximus with two Tables written, the one contaynnig peace, the other warres, which was sent to Carthage eyther to choose peace or warres: the election was theirs, though the Romans were iniuried, and though they could best defende their owne, yet woulde the noble Romans suffer often offences.
Hardie then were the Romans when Scaeuola went alone armed vnto the tentes of Porsenna King of Hetruria either to kill Porsenna or to be kilde by Porsenna greater fortitude of minde coulde be in no man, more valiaunt in heart no man séene than in Cocles who onely resisted the whole armie of of King Porsenna vntill the Citizens of Rome came to take vp the draw bridge, and then leapt in all his harnesse from his enimies, vnto the middest of the riuer Tiber: though hee was sore in diuers places wounded, yet neyther his fall hurted him, neyther his harnesse preste him, neyther water drowned him, neyther thousands of his enimies coulde kill hym, but swimmed through the riuer Tiber vnto Rome, to the great admiration of king Porsenna and excéeding ioye of Rome: so that one poore Romane, gaue the repulse to the whole armie of a king.
Ualiaunt was Rome, and Romans feared, when Popilius was sent Ambassadour to Antiochus the great King of Syria when Antiochus eyther for pryde or pompe of his person, or contempt of Popilius refused to aunswere the Romane Embassadour, was then presently enforced to aunswere the state of Rome, and demaunded of the Embassadour before he might goe out of a litle rounde circle which Popilius made wih his ryding Rodde.
Then faithfull was Rome, when Pomponius a Romane Knight and souldier vnder Lucullus general in the fielde against Mithridates King of Pontus, by whome Pomponius being taken as a prisoner sore wounded and mangled.
The King demaunded, if hée woulde helpe him to life, woulde he be true to Mithridates to whome the poore wounded Romane aunswered, Pomponius wyll be vnto Mithridates as Mithridates wyll be vnto Lucullus so true and faithfull were Romanes, as they were stout and valiaunt, in so much that Scypio being thréescore yeres almost, and being sought of a young souldier to bye a braue Buckler and a fine Target, sayd that a true Romane must not trust vnto the lefte hande, where the Buckler is, or to hyde him selfe vnder a Target: but muste truste vnto his ryght hande, and shewe him selfe in fielde in open sight.
This magnanimitie hadde the people of Sithia at what time Darius King of Persia was marching with his armie towarde Scithia they hauing vnderstanding therof, like people of great magnanimitie, sent certaine Ambassadors to méete Darius to signifie his welcome vnto Scithia by presents sent by the Ambassadors: when therefore the Ambassadours mette with King Darius they began to tell their message, and opening a priuie place, a wallet where theyr presentes were, they tooke out a mouse, saying, Unlesse you créepe like this mouse, to some countrey, or swymme like this frogge, or flie lyke this birde, these arrowes shall pierce your hartes: the presents were a Mouse, a Frogge, a Sparrow, and fiue arrowes, gyuing to vnderstande by the Mouse, earth: by the Frogge, water: by the Sparrow, flight: by the arrowes, death: rare presentes sent vnto a King, simple giftes; small charges, but it contayned valiauntnesse, fortitude, and contempt of Darius rather to moue him to warres, than to entreate of peace.
Though Scythia was bare, yet was shée stoute: though rude and barbarous, yet valiant and manful· It is not in the nature of the place, or in the number of the persons that magnanimitie but in the valiant hart, and noble minde: wherefore Leonides King of Sparta was wont to say vnto his souldiours, that he had rather haue one Lion to leade a whole bande of Déers, than to haue a whole bande of Lyons ruled and led by one Déere, applying his meaning vnto King Zerxes who hauing ten hundred thousand shippes on seas sayling towarde Gréece, so many as all Gréece coulde scant receyue, so many that diuers riuers and flowdes were dryed vp by his huge armie, a proofe sayth Iustine more of his welth then of his magnanimitie.
Leonides knowing well the maner of Zerxes that he was séene first fled, and laste in fielde: whose glorious pompe and shew of men, was not so famous, and terrible, at his comming to Gréece, as his departure from Gréece was shamefull and ignominious, began to perswade the Lacedemonians béeing but foure thousande in number, willinglye to liue, and to die for the renowne of Sparta in Thermopyla: exhorting them to dine as merilye with Leonides their Capitayne, as though they shoulde suppe with Pluto: but perswasions vnto these that were perswaded, were superfluous: spurres vnto those that might not be stopt with bridles, were néedelesse, as in Thermopila well séene and prooued to the noble fame of Leonides and great shame of Zerxes
It is not in multitude of men that magnanimitie of menne consisteth, but in wise and valiaunt heartes, for witte and will ioyned togither (sayth Salust make manne valiaunt: wherefore Agamemnon that most renowmed Emperour of all Gréece appointed at the siege of Troye woulde often saye, that he had rather haue sometime ten wise Naestors then tenne strong Achilles tenne Vlisles then tenne Aiax: wisdome in warre much, Plutarch reciteth foure famous and renowmed princes, and eyther of these foure had but one eye, to the aduansing more of theyr passing port, the first was Philippe King of Macedonia and Father vnto Alexander the great, whose wisdome in warres, whose pollicie in feates, whose liberalitie vnto his souldiours, whose clemencie, and humanitie to his enimies: in fine whose successe in his affayres were such, that his sonne Alexander after doubted whether the valiauntnesse of hys father, woulde leaue anye place to Alexander vnconquered.
The second was Antigonus King in the same selfe place, succéeding after Phillippe whose warres with Mithridates King of Pontus and Pirrhus King of Epire fully set foorth in Plutarch doe yéelde due honour and renowne for his force and magnanimitie: The thirde Hanniball Prince of Carthage the whole staye of all Libia for sixtéene yeares, the whippe and scurge of Rome and Italye, whose name was so terrible for his and hardenesse, that both Antiochus king of Siria and Prusia king of Bithinia rather for feare, than for loue being then but a banished man receyued vnto honour.
The fourth Sertorius a Roman Prince borne in Sabina whose thundering clang of fame was nothing inferior to ye proudest.
These were not so famous by their prowesse and chiualry one way, as they were notorious and spoken of, for that either of them hadde but one eye.
These renowmed Princes and singuler souldiers, excelled all men in wisedome and prowisse, as prooued is in Plutrarch by their liues.
Phillip for temperaunce of lyfe, Antigonus for fayth and constancie, vnto his friende, Hanniball for truth and pacience for his countrie, Sertorius for his clemencie and gentlenesse towardes his enimies, which for theyr passing courage, inuinsible stoutnesse, and worthy enterprises, happened to be depriued of their eyes as Philip lost his eye at the siege of the Citie of Methon, Antigonus at Perinthia, Hanibal in Hetruria, Sertorius in Pontus
Whe~ the people of Thasius had erected alters, appointed sacrifices for to honour Agesilaus in their Temples, for his fame of fortitude, they send Embassadors to certifie the king therof, which say yt as Apollo was in Delphos honored as a god, so Agesilaus was in Thasius but the King as he was valiaunt, so he was wise, much detesting assentations and flatterie of people, demaunded of the Embassadours, and required them if that their countrey coulde make gods, to make some firste of their owne countrey, saying: Agesilaus had rather be king in Sparta then to be a god in Thasius
renowned Sparta famous Greece While hidden hatred was exempted, while ciuill warres were not knowen, while Athence sought no supremacie ouer Sparta while Sparta sought no maisterie ouer Thebes then all the power of Persea the force of Macedonia might not staine one lyttle towne in Greece but the insolencie of princes, the desire of fame, the felicitie of renowme, the honour of glorie was such, as Alexander the great aunswered King Darius Embassadours, who comming from Persea vnto Macedonia to entreate of peace, tendering vnto Alexander the daughter of Darius in maryage, with all the countrey of Mesopotamia and twelue thousande talentes yerely beside, with such princely promising of the kingdome of Persea after Darius dayes, as there wanted no princely liberalitie in Darius offeryng, nor princely stoutnes in Alexanders answere, saying vnto ye Embassadors, Tell your master Darius king of Persea that as two Sunnes may not be in ye firmament, so two Alexanders maye not rule the earth.
Such valiant mindes coulde be subiect in no wise, neither Darius vnto Alexander nor Alexander vnto Darius
Such stoutnesse raigned in Princes, to mainteyne states, that as Archestratus the Athenian was woont to say, that in the Citie of Athence two Alcibiades myghte not rule: so Ethocles the Lacedemonian dyd lykewise speake, that two Lisanders might not agrée in Sparta
So contrarye and diuers were Princes, so high and loftie of courage, so valiaunt of heart, so noble of minde, that though fortune coulde not so often fawne and fauour the states of Princes, but that she which is most vncertaine, coulde vndoe in a day, that which was gotten in a yere: yet in no wise could fortune take valiaunt mindes from men, nor spoyle magnanimitie of Princes, nor diminishe courage of olde men, as that worthy and most auncient souldier Mithridates King of Pontus after he had plagued the Romanes with fortie yeres long warres, during the which time, he shewed him selfe no lesse hardie and stoute in resistyng the strong force of Romanes, and valiaunt and couragious in attemptyng the fortitude of Romanes.
And though by fortune forsaken in his latter dayes, and spoyled of all health, fréendes, children, countreys, kingdomes, and all worldly wealth: yet to spite fortune his mortall foe, went to Celta thinking with them to passe ouer vnto Italy to let the Romanes vnderstande, that though fréendes countreys by fortune were spoyled: yet neither fortune with her spite, nor all ye Romanes with their force could subdue King Mithridates valiaunt heart.
In this ioyed Princes only, then not to be conquered.
In this onely triumphed they, because they might not bée vanquished.
In this gloried they most, in that they were frée from subiectio~.
Cercylidas being one of the wise men named Ephori in Sparta hearyng the thundring threatnings of King Pirrhus Embassadours, the slaughter and murther King Pirrhus entended vpon men, women, children: the cruell destruction and last confusions of the Lacedemonians aunswered no lesse stoutly then wisely the Embassadours of the King, saying: If Pirrhus your Maister be a god, we haue not offended him, therefore we doubt him not: but if Pirrhus be but a man, tel your Maister that the Lacedemonians be me~ likewise, therfore we nothing feare him at all.
This valiaunt Pirrhus thought so wel of him selfe, felt him so ready iudged al men inferiour in enterprices vnto him, that being at the victorie of that noble Cittie Tarentum where he sawe such feates attempted, such actes done, such stoutnesse shewed by the Romanes, that he being dismayde at the manhoode and boldenesse of Romanes, thought if magnanimitie were lost, the moulde thereof shoulde be founde in a Romanes heart: insomuch, that long looking vewing of Romanes, he cryed out and sayd: howe soone woulde Pirrhus conquere all the worlde, if eyther he were King in Rome, or Romane souldiours subiect vnto Pirrhus
Of these Romanes was Haniball wont to saye to King Antiochus of Siria being enforced to forsake Carthage that Rome might not suffer equalitie, either Prince ouer all, or subiect vnto all.
Rome was compared vnto Hidra of Lerna that hauing so many heades when one was cut off, an other sprang vp: insomuch that all the world might not destroye Rome, being iniured, or ouercommed of the enimies as fortune often permitted, they were not to be entreated before the like fortune happened vnto them, as happened against them, as Licinius Emperour hauing lost diuers of his souldiours vnto Perseus king of Macedonia which aftewarde was subdued by that valiaunt Romane Pompeius the great, this Perseus hauing taken diuers of Licinius souldiours, did sende certaine Orators to speake for peace, which eloquently perswaded with Licinius to consent thereto: after long talke, learned councell, pithy perswasions by the Orators, it was aunswered, as briefely, plainelie, and simplye by Licinius that the best waye for king Perseus to craue peace at the Romanes, was first to restore the prisoners of King Perseus which were Romaines home againe, and then to sende his Ambassadors to the Emperour Licinius otherwise the whole countrie of Macedonia shoulde féele the force and magnanimitie of the Romanes.
To speake of the conquest and victories of Iulius Caesar of the audacitie of Metellus of the fortune of Silla of the sharpe dealing of Marcellus being thereby the spurre of Rome called, of Fabius likewise named the Tergat of Rome, of diuers more valiaunt Romanes, it were infinite the reading thereof, but meane not to molest the reader, and yet one little historie to proue the renowmed Romanes most worthie of this valiaunt vertue magnanimitie, writte~ in Claudian of one Camillus a noble Romane, who hauing a long time layde siege at Philiscus and coulde not preuayle.
The Shoolemayster of the Cittie hauing his Scholers vnder pretence of walking oute of the towne, came and offred his schollers vnto Camillus saying: by this meanes you maye doe what you will vnto Philiscus for here be theyr children, whome know to redéeme, they wyll yéelde vp the towne.
Camillus hauing regarde to the fame of Rome, and loathing much to shewe villanye, rewarded the Schoolemayster after this sort, hée did set him naked before his schollers, fast bounde with his handes on his backe, and euery one of the schollers with a rodde in his hand, saying vnto the boyes: bring him home to your parentes, and tell your friendes of his falshoode, and the poore boyes hauing a good time to requite olde beatings, were as gladde as he was sorrowfull, laying on loade, girckt him with so manye stripes, as loytering Treuauntes maye best be boulde to number, vntill they came vnto the Citie, where they toulde their parents the cause thereof, which wayde the clemeccie and humanitie of Camillus to be such, that they gladlye and· willingly yéelded themselues and theyr Citie vnto the handes of Camillus knowing well that he that woulde vse them so being hys enimies, and foes, coulde not vse them yll, by yéelding all vnto his courtesie, who might haue had all by tiranny.
Nowe sith this vertue was often séene in diuers Quéenes, Ladies, Gentlewomen and others, may not omitte the pilgrimage of their liues.
We reade of two Quéenes of the Amahones a countrye of Scythia, Penthesilaea the first, and Hippolite the second, the one so valiaunt against the Gréekes, at the destruction of the noble Citie of Troy that in open fielde she feared not to encounter face to face with that valiaunt Gréeke Achilles the other so hardye, that shée shrinkt not at the force and stoutnesse of that renowmed Champion Theseus which being conuicted by Theseus for hir singuler stoutnesse and courage maried hir, whiche certainelye had happened vnto Penthesilia had shée not béene conuicted by Achilles
Camilla likewise Quéene of the Volskans beside hir princely profession of sacred virginitie which she vowed vnto Diana was so famous for hir magnanimitie, that when Turnus and Aeneas were in wars for the mariage of Lauinia King Latinus daughter, she came bellona lyke vnto the fielde, resisting the violence and puissaunce of Troyans with the Rutiles as an ayde vnto Turnus
That noble Zenobia the famous Quéene of the Palmireians a Princes of rare learning, of excelent vertues, of most valiaunt enterprises, after that hir husbande named Odenatus had died, tooke the empire of Syria and attempted the magnanimitie of Romanes, that a long time shée withstoode in warres that noble and renowmed Emperour Aurelian by whome the Emperour was woont to saye when it was obiected vnto him, that it was no commendacions for a prince to subdue a woman: that it is more valiaunt to conquer a woman being so stout as Zenobia than to vanquishe a King being so fearefull as Zerxes
The auncient Gréekes, as Herodotus doth witnesse were much amazed at the magnanimitie of Artimesia Quéene of Caria after that the king hir husbande died, did shewe such fortitude against the inhabitauntes of Rhodes that being but a woman she subdued their stoutenesse, shée burned their Nauies, wasted theyr wealth, vanquished and destroyed the whole Ile, entered into the Citie of Rhodes caused hyr ymage to be made and set vp for a monument of hir chiualrie and pertuall memorie of hir victorie: renowmed Ladies, worthye women that with feaminine feates, merited manlye fame.
Howe famous Teuca Quéene of the Illiryans gouerned hir subiectes after the death of hir husbande king Argon which being warred on diuers times by the Romanes, infringed theyr force, broke theyr bonds, discomfited their armies to hir perpetuall fame commendacion: shée gouerned the people of Illeria no lesse wisely, then she defended the puissaunt force of the Romanes stoutly, shée liued (as histories report) as soberly and chastly without the company of man, as shée gouerned hir countrie wisly and stoutelye without the councell of man: it were sufficient to repeate the auncient histories of two women, to prooue fullye an euerlasting prayse and commendacion vnto all women: the one written by Herotus in his first booke of Queene Tomyris of Scythia the other mencioned by Valerius and Iustine of Cleopatra quéene sometime of Aegipt
The first, after that Cirus had trespassed muche in hir kingdome of Scithia killing, destroying, and burning, without regarde to princely clemencie or respect vnto a womans gouernement: yet vnsufficed though hée slue the Quéenes owne sonne named Margapites thirsted more and more for bloude, that then the valiaunt Quéene being muche moued to reuenge Margapites death, waying the gréedie rage of Cirus came Lion lyke to fielde, eyther to loose hyr owne life, or else to reuenge hir sonnes death, prest vnto Cirus more lyke at that time to a grimme Gorgon, than to a sillie Scythian slue him in the fielde, haled him vp and downe the field, cutte of his heade, and bathed it in a great Tunne full of bloudde, appoynted for that purpose, saying: Nowe Cirus drinke thy belly full of that which thou couldest neuer haue ynough: this valiaunt Tomyris reuenged tyranny, requited the death of one Scythian Margapites with the death of two hundred thousand Persians
The other Quéene Cleopatra after that Iulius Caesar was murthered by Brutus and Cassius and that Marcus Antonius being by Augustus warred on for his periurie, shewed vnto his Uncle Caesar: shée, saie, Cleopatra hauing the most part of Arabia and Siria confederated with hir friende and louer Antonius against Augustus being then the seconde Emperour of Rome, that shee ayded him a long time, vntill that she perceyued that Augustus preuayled, and that Antonius was vanquished: then least shée shoulde be conquered by Augustus shée conquered hir selfe, yéelding rather hyr bodye a praye vnto Serpentes, than a subiect vnto Augustus.
Hanniball could no more but to poyson himselfe rather then to yéelde to Scipio
Well let Semiramis with hir valiaunt force and stoutnesse, be commended at Babilon where shée raigned fortie yeares a wydowe, after King Ninus hir husbandes death.
Let noble and famous Atalanta with hir Bowes and Speares and feates of armes be praysed in Archadia Let Hipsicratea that followed hir husbande Kinge Mithridates vnto warres as a Lackie vnknowne, be extolled in Pontus
Let Helerna, Ianus daughter, with all hir fortitude be spoken of in Latine: And let Delbora be famous amongst the Isralites
These women were no lesse famous for theyr pilgrimage, then the worthye Conquerours and Champions of the world, they were in no point inferiour vnto men, in diuers poyntes farre excelling Princes and Kinges: eyther the worlde then was very weake or slender, or else women then were valiant and stoute.
And to omitte perticulerly to touch women, will open and declare the nature of Countries, the women of Lacena woulde togither with their husbandes go vnto the fielde: yea, they went souldiour lyke vnto Missenios to fight in fielde.
The women of Cimbria woulde kill those that first fledde the fielde, though they were nigh friends or kinsemen vnto them.
The women of Saca had this custome, eyther at their mariage to be conquered by theyr husbandes the first daye, or else to be conquerours ouer their husbandes all the dayes of theyr life: theyr combat sayth was for victorie, and not for lyfe.
The women of Persea woulde méete theyr housbandes and sonnes flying the fielde, lifting vp theyr clothes, shewyng their priuities, saying: Whither flée you, Cowardes, will you againe enter into your mothers wombes, will you créepe into your wiues bellies, as they did in the warres betwixt Cirus and his Grandfather Astyages
The women of Sparta woulde go vnto the fielde to sée in what place theyr Husbandes and friendes were wounded, if it were before, they woulde with gladnesse and ioye shewe the same vnto euerye man, and burie the bodie solemnely: if their woundes were behinde, they woulde be so ashamed of the same, that they left them vnburied in the fielde.
The women of Scithia called Amazones, liued as conquerours ouer men, and not conquered by men, vntill Alexander the great destroyed them and theyr countrey, which before were so valiaunt, that they wayed not to encounter with Hercules in the fielde, and after with Theseus in open battayle, they blusht not to méete the valiant Gréekes at the destruction of Troye
Magnanimitie which was then for defence of countries, is nowe tyrannye to destroye pages missing] that at their banquettes and drinkinges they had their Garlandes on their heades: for as the worlde grewe in wealth, so it grewe in sumptuousnesse: for the triumph of Romulus was farre inferiour vnto the gorgeous triumph of Camillus and yet Romulus was a king, Camillus was but an officer.
In time Rome waxed so wealthy Camillus say was caried in a chariot al gilded wrought ouer with golde, hauing all white horses trimly deckt, a crowne of pure golde on his head, all the Senatours and Consuls of Rome going a foote before him vnto the Capitoll of the Citie, and thence vnto the temple of Iupiter where to honour the triumph further, they slue a white Bul as sacrifice vnto Iupiter and thence to bring him triumphantly through the Citie of Rome, vnto his owne house: euen so in Greece and in Carthage in time grewe vnto suche pompe sumptuous triumphes, that there was as much studie to inuent braue shewes, and solempne sightes in triumph, as there was care and diligence to haue moued the enimies.
When Hanniball gouerned proude Carthage when Laeonidas bare sway in warrelike Sparta then Greece and Lybia were acquainted with solempne and braue triumphes.
In Caesars time it was in Rome and thus alwayes from the begynnyng of the worlde, triumphes folowed victories.
And here meane a litle to entreate of the triumphes of the Romanes, whiche farre diuers wayes surmounted the rest, whose fame was spred ouer all the worlde: And yet imitatyng in all things the Gréekes, insomuch that Rome alwayes had Athence as a nource or a paterne to frame their lawes: for when their Kings were banished aswell in Athence as in Rome, yet they ruled triumphed more by Oratours in Athence by Consuls in Rome then by Kings.
Therefore as Plini saith, they exercised suche feates of armes, they practised suche pollicies of warres, they vsed suche solempnitie in triumphes, that Rome then was noted to be the lampe and lanterne of Mars
They had saye diuers garlandes made onelye for the triumph of warres: Plini compteth seuen sortes of garlandes which the Romanes hadde: the first made of pure golde, appoynted onely for the triumphes of Princes: the seconde of Laurell, which of all was most auncient in Gréece, in Italie appoynted for the triumphes of Pallas souldiours: the thirde of all kinde of swéete flowers made, appoynted to him that restored Cities vnto theyr liberties againe: the fourth made of Oaken leaues, to him that defended Citizens from death: These two garlandes were of great honour in Rome, and specially in Gréece, the one Cicero ware in Rome, for his inuectiues against the conspiracies of wicked Catelin the other Fabius Maximus did weare for that he saued Rome from the seconde warres of Carthage where Haniball was Capitaine.
The sift Garlande was appoynted for him that assaulted the walles of the enimies first, and entered the towne: the sixt, for him that first attempted the tentes of the enimies: the seauenth bestowed vpon him that boorded first the Name of the enimie.
These thrée last Garlandes mencioned for the skaling of walles, the boording of shippes, and attempting the tentes, were made all of Golde, and giuen by the Princes or Senators to the aforesayde souldiours.
There was likewise in Rome concerning the triumphes, that none might triumph vnlesse he had bene before some officer in Rome, as Dictator, Pretor, Consuls or suche like: and if any (without they were sent by the Senators) had wonne any victories, though there conquest were neuer so great, and their victorie neuer so famous, as Pub Scipio for all his victories in Spaine, and Marcus Marcellus for all that he tooke captiue Siracuse bycause they were not sent nor appoynted by the Senators, they might in no wise by lawe made, clayme triumphes thereby.
Then Rome florished, then Rome was defended from diuers offered iniuries, saued from enimies.
Iulius Caesar ouer all Europe and Affrike, then Rome was feared of all the worlde, and nowe Rome is dispised.
Then Rome might say, Roma vincit: nowe Rome may say, Roma victa
That victorie that was not manfullye gotten, and wonne by force of armes in the fielde, was rather counted among the Romanes, tyrannie, then victorie: for when Lucius Pius in a banquet that he made, had filled the people of Sarmatia full of Wine, and made them so drunken that all the nobles and captaynes of Sarmatia yéelded them selues as subiectes vnto the Empire of Rome, for the whiche Lucius Pius at his returne home to Rome, required accordyng to the custome, to haue a triumphe done vnto hym for the victorie of Sarmatia whiche when the Senatours had fully hearde of the victorie, howe and after what sort Lucius Pius subdued the Sarmatians he was openly beheaded by decrée of all the Senate, and a slau~derous Epitaph set vpon his graue, to manifest the deceit he vsed in stéede of magnanimitie, to deceyue them by Wine, which he ought to subdue by force.
The Romanes were not in those dayes contented that any of their Captaynes shoulde vse vicious dealyng, or shewe any fraude or guile in warres vnto their enimies: but at last as warres grewe common in all countreyes, so deceit and craft was thereby augmented, and triumph exiled: then the Assyrians warred on the Perseans: the Perseans on the Argineans: the Argineans on ye Athenians: the Athenians on the Lacedemonians: the Lacedemonians on the Sydonians: the Sydonians on the Rhodians: and the Rhodians on the Scithians with all kinde of pollicie, right or wrong, forced they not so that victorie might be gotten: so that triumph then, is turned vnto captiuitie nowe: magnanimitie then, vnto craft and deceit nowe: In fine, victorie then, vnto tyranny nowe.
And so with Caesar ende, Ex bonis principijs mala orivnter.
Such is the state of life, the pilgrimage of man, that dayly worse and worse it waxeth to the ende: for in the beginning, renowme and honour was the cause that all men attempted daungers and great peryls: and nowe in the ende, gaine and profite mooueth warres: Then was their desire to ouercome Lions, Beares, Elephantes, Tygers, Panthers, Rinocherons, with such wylde and sauage beasts, that might honour their victorie.
Of the first finding out of Lawes and orders, and of all inuention of thinges generall, and of time.
AFter in sundrye places, diuers men haue found means to sette thinges which at the beginning were rude and barbarous in Ciuill orders, as amongst the Athenians, Draco: amongst the Aegiptians, Mercurie: amongst the Argiues, Phoroneus: In Arcadia, Apollo: In Tire, Charandes: in Italie, Pithagoras: other things no lesse necessarie for the maners ciuilitie of men, then for the life and foode of men were founde.
And for that time is the beginning and the ende of all thinges terestriall, thinke it well for the purpose to declare howe then at all places time was counted: for with Aegiptians at the first, they counted their yeres by the Moone, attributing vnto euery yere thirtie dayes, as both Herodotus and Macrobius doe agrée.
The Arcadians as Plutarch in the life of Numa doth write, had thrée monethes in euery yere appoynted.
The people of Caria finished and ended their yere euery sixt moneth.
The Gréekes did number thrée hundred fiftie and foure daies in their yeares, which want of our yeres a eleuen dayes, and sixe houres.
The Romanes at the beginning in the time of Romulus whiche was their firste king, hadde their yere in ten monethes compted: counting theyr first moneth March, and giuing that name vnto it, after his fathers name Mars
April was named of Aphros in gréeke, which is Fome, whence Venus was borne.
Iune of the youth called Iuniores these foure was of Romulus named.
The fift moneth was then called of Romulus Quintill which Iulius Caesar in his time, named Iulij: and August, Augustus Caesar did name: and so orderly by number Sextill September, October, Nouember, and December, vntill Numa Pompilius who succéeded Romulus who added Ianuarij, and Februarij, and so named them according to the name of Ianus which was the first king of the Latenes: and Februus which was supposed to be the inuentor of Lustrum
For as the Gréekes did count all thinges by their Olimpiades: so did the Romanes number their time by that Lustru~
Then was the vse of the Clockes vnsought, and vnknowne: insomuch, Authors herein doe much varye and seeme to be ignoraunt of the inuentors herof.
First, some thinke that Hermes in Aegipt founde out by a beast sacrificed vnto Serapis some againe vnto Anaximines in Lacedemon founde out by a shade: some vnto Scipio surnamed Nasica in Rome by water, the clockes were founde: but howe vncertayne it is, by whome, and by what meanes Clockes first were founde, writers do witnesse the same.
Some againe do count their dayes which is foure and twentie houres, from Sunne rising, vnto Sunne rising: as the Babilonians vse: some from Sunne setting, vnto Sunne setting as the Athenians: some from midnight vnto midnight, as the Egyptians some againe from middaye vnto noone againe, as the Vmbrians doe.
Nowe after lawes were inuented, and orders made, and time deuided, men as yet rude and rawe, leading their liues beastly, and brutishly, for want of ciuilitie, hauing neither houses, townes or Cities, to enhabite, but some in caues of the grounde had their chiefe mantions, some of gréene bowes and braunches of trées had their best garmentes made, some couering themselues with shadowes of woddes: some againe in dennes lyke wilde beastes, vntill nature first by reason inuented awaye and a meane vnto further ciuilitie.
Then howses were made, and Cities builded, hie towers raysed, strong walles inuented: as Cicrops made Athens: Phoroneus builded Argos: Diospolin in Egypt which Thrason made.
Likewise by Nemroth the first Towre after the deluge of Noah was made.
Then Temples were builded, as Pythias in Prerenna made a temple vnto Minerua: Romulus in Rome builded a temple vnto Iupiter and thus diuers men in sundrie countries haue bene the doers and trauellers of things· By this meanes came Pallas vnto great fame, for that she was supposed to be the first that inuented science, amongst the Grecians: in Athens for this purpose was Ceres in Sicilia renowmed, for yt shée was thought to be the first that sowed corne, and taught husbandrye: for this onely were Typhis and Iason so worthyly commended, that they amongst the Gréekes were the first that sayled the seas.
Then was money founde in mount Pangaeum quoyned of Aegineta which as Plini sayth had béene better vnknowne then founde.
Then money being founde, warres ensued by Ninus which was the first that euer warred after the deluge.
Then Idolatrie sprung vp by Melissus King of Creete Images and pictures were first made by Epimitheus
Tribute was appoynted first by Darius Fighting on horsebacke by the Centaures was first practized.
Immediatly thinges were founde apt and necessarie vnto warres after that Mars first inue~ted the way therevnto.
Then the Lacedemonians people of great antiquitie, founde first the Helmet, a sworde, and a speare.
The Scithians founde first the vse of bowes and arrowes.
The Thrasians most auncient in this, for that Mars as they supposed was borne with them, being honored as the God of warres, founde and sought diuers thinges necessarie for the warres.
Happy was that man that might then inuent some thing or other to profite his countrey: insomuch the wit of man sought so deepe, studied so painefully, that from a rude lumpish Chaos, the worlde waxed beautifull, men waxed Ciuile, and all things became ripe and perfect by the industry of man.
After that the worlde grewe vnto such ripenesse that liberall sciences were founde and vsed in all places, as things necessary vnto man, and that there was nothing vnsought as might induce profite: both hearbes, stones, trées, and all thinges within the compasse of the earth were searched to what ende they were, and vsed accordingly vnto some purpose: yea assoone as Vulcanus or Prometheus founde out the profite of the fire.
Anacharsis the Scythian founde first belowes to blowe the same: assoone as Ceres taught the way to tyll and plowe, straight did Argeus inuent the dounging of the same.
Assoone as euer Vrania founde firste Astrologie, the people of Chaldea straight practised the same.
As soone as Errato had the vse of Geometrie, the people of Egypt straight exercised the~ same.
To be breefe, after that Clio founde first Histories, Melpomen Tragidies, Thalia co~medies, Polyhimnia Rethoricke, Callipe poaetrie: yea, Palles herselfe whom al ye Gréekes supposed to be first founder of sciences artes.
Simonides straight inuented the arte of memorie as the register and sure recorder of knowledge to kéepe the same.
When the vertue of hearbes were founde of Mercury of Cheron and of others.
Then Hyppocrates and Auicena practised Phisicke therewith, though the most part do attribute vnto Apollo the first exercise in Phisicke and vnto his sonne Asculapius the practise of Chirurgery.
Nothing escaped mans industry, in so muche that Aristeus king of Arcadia first founde the vse of Honye, and the nature of Bées.
Nature left nothing vnsought for her owne profite, as Plautus saith, she is alwayes desirous to inuent and to know new things.
Crassus made the siluer Garlande first to be worne in Rome.
Epeus for that he inuented the brasen Horse in Troy for the Gréekes, is famous.
Perillus for that he made the brasen Bull in Agrigentu~ vnto the Emperour Phalaris is renowmed, though the one was made to satisfie tyranny, and the other to accomplishe treason: yet suche was the desire that men had to fame, that alwayes they studied and coniectured what best might aduaunce them therevnto, which was and might be a perpetuall memorie of their attempted trauayle.
What thing it was to sée in auncient time the inuention and pollicie of men in all countreys, what orders, what lawes were in all places, to obserue that by wyt, which afterwardes they destroyed by warres, before Antigonus shaued and spoyled Macedonia before Ninus empouerished all Asia before Alexander destroyed the whole worlde.
What was inuented in Rome before Iulius Caesar and Pompeius altered it, before those wicked members Silla and Marius spoyled it: before that rebell Catelin disturbed it: before Marcus Antonius and Augustus quite destroyed it: so that pollicie of men in obseruing lawes and orders, their wisedome in framing them, their magnanimitie in defending them, were topsey turuey throwen downe afterwardes by cruell tyrauntes and wicked princes: as Caligula, Nero, Tiberius, Heliogabolus with others: so that time findeth all things, and endeth all things: time maketh, and time destroyeth.
Thought it best to place other straunge and woonderfull buildinges, which were made by mennes handes, togither with the merueylous workes of nature: and bycause some amongst the rest, are so famous, that for the renowne thereof, they are named in number the seuen woonders of the worlde.
The first was called Pyramides which the Kinges of Egypt made by the citie of Memphis, a miracle so made that twenty and two yeres, sixtie thousande were occupied and trauayled in the same: either as Plini to embusie the vulgar people lest they shoulde be ydle, or else to shewe and bragge their superfluous wealth in making so huge a worke.
The seconde were the walles of Babylon, which Quéene Semiramis vnto her perpetuall memory hath made as a monument amongst the Perseans In making of these walles, she kept three hundred thousand men at worke, vntill these Walles were made of two hundred Cubites height, and fiftie Cubites broade, hauing a hundred gates, wrought all of brasse rounde about, to come and go vnto the Citie, and from the Citie: And vpon the Walles were made thrée hundred Towres: She brought Euphrates one of the foure floods of Paradice to passe through the middest of Babylon.
The thirde in order was the sumptuous tombe of Mausolus King of Caria which Quéene Artimesia his wife made so gorgeous, that it was twentye and fiue Cubites long of height, in compasse foure hundred and eleuen foote, and wrought rounde about with sixe and thirtie pillers and brode beames: hence all the monumentes and braue buildings of Emperours and kings tooke their patterne, for it was so curiouslye wrought, that vpon the East side, that famous workeman Scopas shewed his skill: vpon the Weast side that renowmed Leocares wrought his cunning: vppon the North side Briax a man of great name applyed his part: and vpon the South side Timotheus did what he coulde to winne fame.
These foure famous workmen had more fame by making the tombe of Mausolus then for all the workes that euer they made before.
These two noble Quéenes cannot be blotted out of memorie all the while that the names of Babilon are readde of in bookes, or the Tombe of Mausolus spoken of with tongues.
Nowe to passe further to speake of that monstrous monument, and huge myracle which excelleth all the worlde for worke, meane the great Temple of Diana amongst the Ephesians which all Asia were occupied withall two hundred and twentie yeres, almost with all powers of the world at the building thereof.
This Temple was made nigh the seas for feare of earthquakes: it was foure hundred twentie and fiue foote long, two hundred and twentie foote in breadth, it had a hundred twentie and seuen pillers, which for the wealth thereof, euery one after another was made by a king.
The chéefe maister of this worke, was Ctesiphon whose fame thereby was spread ouer all the worlde.
The fift was the hie Towre, which King Ptholome made in the Ile of Pharos to ease the saylers vpon the Seas.
This Sostratus made so high that in the night time there hanged a Candle for a light a marke vnto poore Maryners, which coulde be séene for ye height of the towre almost euery where.
The other two last of the seue~ woonders, were two Images, the one for Iupiter made by Phydias of Iuory in Olimpia The other made for Phebus in Rhodes by Cha. Lindius whose hugenesse was such, that it was thréescore and ten Cubites high: so great was this Cofussus, that when it fell downe by an earthquake, it séemed a woonder to the beholders: euery finger that he had was more then a man of this age.
These seuen huge and monstrous workes were called the seuen woonders of the worlde, whiche Plini and Plutarch speaketh of in diuers places.
Some suppose that Cirus regall Pallaice which that cunning workman Memnon made, might bée iustly numbred with these worthy and famous workes.
But to procéede to other sumptuous buildinges, though not counted of the seue~ woonders, yet allowed amongst the best for the stately work of the same, of no inferiour fame: as Labirinthus made by Dedalus in Créete, of such difficulte worke, that he that came in, coulde not without guide come out againe.
Thrée others were made lyke vnto them, the one in Egypt which Smilus made: the other in Lemnos which Rholus wrought, and the thirde in Italy which Theodorus made.
Labirinthes were so curiously wrought, that Porsenna king of Hetruria toke hence example to make him a monument after death, to bury him selfe.
Againe, after these there were other woonderfull workes made by the Kinges of Egypt, called Obelisci, famous and renowmed buildings, that when Cambyses, King of Persea at the siege of the citie of Sienna sawe but one of them, he was in such an admiration that he thought them inuincible.
King Ptholomeo made another of fourescore Cubites in Alexandria and diuers others which for their fame were then counted as marueylous as any of the seuen woonders.
But let vs speake of sundry buildings, aswell of Cities and Townes, as also of Temples, Houses, and Pallaices, whose fame thereby long flourished: as Romulus by building of Rome.
Cadmus by building of Thebes a Citie of Beotia in Gréece.
And Ogdous by the buildyng of the famous Citie of Memphis in Egypt.
Neither may escape any, sith tooke vpon me to recite all, whose renowmes and names by these their workes do yet liue.
must not escape Alexander the great, which in his businesse and great warres, made a Citie of his name, named Alexandria
must not forget King Darius which likewise builded vp Susa a citie in Persea
These two Kings, though they destroyed thousandes of cities, yet they builded some cities.
Neither may omit Caesar Augustus which made a famous Citie in memorie of the great victory ouer Antonius and Cleopatra and named it Nicopolis that is in english: the city of victory.
King Ninus an auncient King, made the Citie of Niniue within two hundred yeres after the flood of Noah.
Then the worlde waxed populus, and Kings began to builde euerye where for the furtheraunce of ciuilitie and encrease of pollicie and wit, which the worlde in the beginnyng was very rawe: for as the worlde grewe vnto ciuile order and perseueraunce of things: so with all, Cities and Townes were builded, Castles fortified, and hye walles raysed for a Bulwarke and a defence vnto the same: so by litle and litle the world was full of Cities.
And so briefely to recite them ouer, the noble and famous Citie of Troy in Phrygia was made by Dardanus.
Arpos a Towne in Apuleia was built by Diomides and so Telegonus builded Tusce in Italy, being the sonne of Vlixes a Gréeke.
Capis likewise made the Citie Capua which Hanniball layde long siege at: but lest might be to long in rehearsing the builders of famous Cities, hauing iust occasions to respect the time, wyll ende with Cities and Townes, alwayes consydered that women ought not to be forgotten, as Semiramis Quéene of Persea whiche builded vp the Citie of Babylon.
Queene Dido which made the warlyke citie of Carthage King Acrisius daughter.
Danaes which builded in Italy a great Towne called Arde
Diuers Quéenes, and noble women, are for the lyke no lesse famous then men were.
Now pausing a while, we will repeate those that encreased the co~mon wealthes, and beautified with other kinde of buildinges.
Amongst other myracles, and woonderous workes, Mount was made of Zerxes Nauigable, euen vnto the sea, eleuen yeres hée kept thirtie thousande men to bryng his minde to passe.
Caesar made in one day two famous Bridges: the one ouer the riuer called Rheum and the other ouer the riuer called Ara in one day, which was almost vncredible.

Thus thought good to write in the of Painting, and Poetrie, which for the secrete friendeship and for the affinitie one with another, much more might be spoken, meane not those fonde foolishe and fantasticall fables, fostered by women and olde men sitting at the fire, where often the ydle brae is occupied: but those wise and prudent fables of Poets which containe wisedome in sence, though they séeme light in wordes, which durst not be opened playne in those daies, for the tyranny of Princes which then woulde not haue theyr faultes toucht in anye, but that learnedly with fables poeticall: As the fable of Sphinx of Cirses of Tantalus of Acteon and of others.
PYrrhus King of the Epire and defender long of the Tarentines was woont to say of Cineas his Oratour, that hée wanne more victories thorowe the eloquence of Cyneas, then he through the force and puissaunce of all his Epirotes besides, for through eloquence woulde Cyneas make the stout enemies to yéelde: and by eloquence woulde Cyneas mooue the cowardly souldiers to victorie.

Great was the force of eloquence in Marcus Antonius which with his sugred and swéete perswasions turned the furious rage and tyranny of the souldiers of Marius and Cinnanus beyng sent of these two cruell Captaynes to kyll him, vnto such lenitie and mercie, that hauing their swordes naked drawen, redie to accomplishe promise with Marius hauing hearde Antonius his eloquence, as men conuicted with wordes, coulde neuer kéepe promise with Marius though they had great rewardes appointed: nor coulde of them selues, though enimies they were vnto Antonius finde in their heart to kyll hym.
Pericles wanne such renowme in Athence by his eloquence, which sometime was scholler vnto Anaxagoras that he had the gouernment and rule of Athence commited vnto him, as vnto one the people reposed more credite or trust in Pericles wordes, then they had in the force and strength of Athence beside: Insomuch that when he woulde speake any thing vnto the people, such mellifluous wordes and sugred sentences procéeded foorth of his mouth, that they were amazed or astonied to heare him willyng alwayes, neuer wéery of his counsel.

What is it but man is able through comely gesture, and apt pronunciation bring to passe? What coulde escape Cicero in Rome? What might haue auoyded Demosthenes in Athence? whose knowen eloquence, whose learned perswasions, whose swéete and sugred wordes, coulde aswel mooue enimitie in Athence towarde King Philip, as it coulde kindle loue in Rome towarde Pompeius
Such is the excellencie of eloquence, that it mooueth aswell men to the sight, for the gesture, countenaunce, and pronunciation, as it doth enforce men to heare for the maiestie and swéetnesse of wordes.
For Hortensius was not so eloquent in wordes, but he was as comely in gesture, and so in either of them that when he spake before the people, Senatours, and Citizens of Rome, they were no lesse enamored with his sight, then they were allured and entised with his wordes: for he laboured no lesse outwardly to please pages missing] night became very darcke, all the souldiours of Paulus yea, Paulus himselfe being their Generall and Captain, were dismayde and quite discomfited, thinking it had bene some prodigious showe to prognosticate mishappe to come, and readie to yéelde in heart and courage, vntyll Sulpitius began to perswade the rude Souldiours with reason, opening the causes vnto the souldiours, and declaring the effectes of the superiour bodies so eloquently, that then being readie to yéelde for feare, they were readie to fight valiauntly by eloquence of Sulpitius and where through feare of that sodaine sight and chaunge of the Moone, they were readye to yéelde as Captiues to King Perseus they were stirred mooued by the eloquence of Sulpitius to become conquerours and victours ouer King Perseus in the same selfe night.

Of those that had their pictures and Images for a shovv of their deserued fame erected.
THE greatest honour that both Gréekes Gentiles vse towarde those that deserued well in the co~mon wealth, was to aduaunce them by pictures painted, images gorgeously grauen: thinkyng thereby either to enflame them further to do good, or else to discourage them againe in doing euyll, by banishing and neglecting their pictures: which whe~ Fauorinus the Philosopher hearde that the Citie of Athence had reiected his picture, because Adrian the Emperour was angry with him, sayde: am right glad therof, for better sayd he had it béene for Socrates to haue had his brasen picture broken and throwen away for some shewe of displeasure by the Athenians, then to be depriued of his lyfe for nothing by the Athenians for the surest state of all is not to be knowen.
Agesilaus therefore, King of the Lacedemonians vnderstanding that the inhabitants of euery countrey in all Gréece, had decréed to put vp the picture of Agesilaus for a memorial of his vertuous and noble actes, to be as monumentes of his life after death.
Returnyng then from Egipt vnto Gréece, beyng verye sicke a little before hée dyed, wrote letters vnto Gréece, that they shoulde make no pictures, no Images, no painted shewes, no grauen worke of his person, ne yet of his life, saying: If haue done well in life, the vertue thereof is a sufficient monument when am dead.

Marke howe puissaunt princes of the worlde, and mighty Kesars were subiectes vnto fortune.
And sée agayne the learned sage Philosophers, which as sayde before, had their names aduaunced, their persons estéemed, their pictures erected, yet not able to auoyde the furious frets of fortune: as Pythagoras borne in Samos, dead in Metapontus.
Terence borne in Carthage brouhht vp in Rome, and ended his life in Arcadia
These Princes and noble men, had notwithstanding in diuers places their fame spread, their name aduaunced, and their pictures euery where erected.
Gorgias Leontinus was the first amongst the Gréekes for his wisedome and eloquence that had his picture set vp in Delphos in the Temple of Apollo
His scholler Isocrates had for his wit and passyng eloquence in Olimpia his picture erected.
Demetrius, Theophastrus scholler, after he had tenne yeres with all diligence and industry gouerned the state of Athence hauyng thrée hundred and thréescore pictures in Gréece, erected and set vp for his fame and renowme in administration of the common wealth: yet were they all broken and taken downe of enuie afterwarde, which when Demetrius hearde of the inconstancie and enuie of the people in shewyng their malice therein, he sayde: Though they exile my pictures, yet can they not banish the vertuous cause of the pictures.

Mutius Scaeuola had his picture in Rome, for that he deliuered the Citie of Rome from Porsenna King of Ethruscan for the like Cocles was not forgotten of the Romanes.
It were vnto small purpose to speake of Lucullus of M. Attillius and Octauius whose fame and renowme made their pictures to be monumentes thereof? What shoulde embusie my selfe with infinite names of men, sith wome~ well deserued the same? as Tanaquil, Torquinius wife.
Cloaelia a Uirgin of Rome: yea, as Quintilian saith, Phryne for her beauty wanted not to be commended by pictures, so common were they for all men, that referre those that wyll reade further of this, vnto Plini where he may at large satisfie him selfe in that poynt.
shoulde be ouer much charged to recite the places, persons and time, that pictures were only erected to aduaunce their fame, and to stirre them further in such procéedinges as were the cause of these their pictures.
Therefore as before is spoken, they shall finde in Plini store of them.
Of those that defended diuers from deathes, from Serpentes, Dragons, Lions, and of cunning Archers.
EUen as by these valiant and noble conquerours, not only Townes, Cities, and countries, were defended, Serpentes, Dragons, Lions, and other monstrous and wilde beastes were slayne: but also diuers and sundrie captiues and Prisoners: were deliuered from deathes vnto life.
Howe manye did famous Hercules that ofspring of the Gods, saue from the gulfe of Auentin where that Cacus both daye and night murthered the passers by?

He againe slue Sphinx a terrible beast in Ethiopia which with his sight destroied men: How he ouercame Gereon, Cerberus and Diomedes and diuers other enterprises, it is before rehersed.
Perseus after that Neptune had defloured Medusa in the temple of Pallas the Goddes being displeased therewith, turned euery héere of her head vnto snakes, whose sight was so venemous, that whatsoeuer he was that behelde hir, died presently.

Againe such were the happe of young maydes, as Balsaria when Carphurrinus Crassus was taken Captiue of the Messalines and shoulde be offred for a sacrifice vnto Saturne shée deliuered Crassus from death and made him conquerour; where before he was conquered: vnto hir euerlasting fame.

Plutarch writeth of these two maydes, that theyr fames hereby may not be forgotte~.
To speak here of them that deliuered men from death, from captiuitie, from perpetuall prison, it were necessarie, howbeit short histories are swéete, and fewe wordes are pleasaunt: therefor will not speake of Lucullus which being in warres with Mithridates King of Pontus deliuered Cotta from thousandes about him.
will not write of Lucilius a Romane souldiour, which when he sawe that Brutus at Phillippos was compassed rounde about with enimies, he himselfe ranne with fewe souldiours with him amongst the enimies, bicause Brutus in the meane while, might saue himselfe.
Neyther will make muche mention of Quintius Concinnatus being then Dictator in Rome, which deliuered Quintus Minutius from the handes of the Sabins and Vulscans but according vnto promise, will touche partlye those that deserued fame an otherwaye, for fame is not bound vnto one kinde of qualitie or chaunces, but vnto diuers and sundrie vertues.
Therefore to ioyne with these renowmed conquerers and defenders of countries, most excellent and expert Archers, which likewise haue done noble actes, worthye feates and merueylous thinges, as Ilerdes was such an Archer, that he woulde kill the flying birdes in the ayre.
And likewise Catenes coulde doe the like, appoynt the flying fowles to dye, this doth Curtius in his sixt booke affirme.

Acastus wonne immortall renowne for killing of the wilde huge Boare, that spoyled Calidonia with his dart.
Toco a fine souldiour, and an excellent Archer, is muche commended for that he coulde doe with his bowe.
Princes in times past were taught to doe feates with archerye, for Hercules himselfe was taught of Euritus the science of shooting, that he coulde kill any flying foule, or swift beast, as sometime he killed the birdes called Harpeis and slue the swift Centaure Nessus
We reade in the firste of Herodotus that Commodus the sonne of Marcus surnamed Aurelius Emperour sometime of Rome, begotten of the Empresse Faustina was so skilfull in shoting, that what soeuer he sawe with his eyes, the same woulde he kill with his bowe, insomuch, that vpon a time Herodotus doth witnesse, that he slue a hundred wilde beastes with a hundred shot, missing nothing at any time: euen so the Emperor Domitianus was so expert in his bowe, that he coulde shoote (when any heald vp his hande, betwixt his fingers a great way of.

AS Horace that auncient Poete affirmeth, that the worthyest and greatest vertue is to auoide vice: so is it iudge the greatest commendacion vnto anye man to embrace diligence to eschewe ydlenesse, for suche is the vertue of mans minde, that rare giftes, and excellent talents, which God and nature bestowed on man, that to sée the excellencie and vertue thereof with externall sight, if coulde be séene, it woulde sayth that deuine and noble Philosopher Plato enflame great desire, vncredible vnto vertue, and woulde on the contrarie, kindle such a hatred vnto vice, that the sight thereof would feare any beholder thereon.
When yet sayth Cicero the world was rawe, and nothing ripe, no lawes made, no Citties builded, no order set, no common welth framed, but all thinges confusedly on a heape, without deuicions and limittes, most like to Poetical Chaos before the elementes were water from earth· and the fire from the ayre: then say, we liued brutishlye and beastly, without ciuilitie and maner, without learning and knowledge: but when reason began to rule, when Ladye prudence began to practise with pollicie, when witte began to search and to séeke by diligence and trauayle the nature of thinges: diuers men in sundrie countries sought meanes by diligence to profite their countries, as Moyses first founde by diligence lettters amongst the Hebrues, Menno first founde letters amongst the Egyptians.
Rhadamanthus amonst the Assirians: Nicostrata amongst the Romans: Phaenices amongst the Grecians that by diligence and studie of men, from time to time, raw things waxed rype: straunge thinges became familiar: and harde and difficult things, waxed facill and easie.
Then Solon made lawes in Athens, Licurgus in Lacedemonia, Zaleucus in Locresia, Ninus in Creete and so orderly all the whole worlde was bewtified with lawes, exornated with witte and learning.
Then say lawes began to order thinges, and reason began to rule, that learning and knowledge was sought farre and néere, witte exercized, pollicie practized, and vertue so honoured, that well might Tullie saye, Philosophie the searcher of all good vertues, and the expeller of all vices.
Then was that common wealth noted happie, that enioyed such a prince to rule, as a Philosopher that woulde extoll vertue, and suppresse vice: rewarde the good, and punishe the euill: estéeme the wise and learned, and neglect the foolish and ignoraunt.
will omitte to speak of mightie and famous Princes, whose care, diligence, studie and industrie were such, whose numbers were so infinite, that might well séeme to tedious to molest the reader therewith.
will recyte the diligence and trauayle of poore men, which by theyr studie and labor became lampes, and lantornes of the worlde.
And to begin with Plato and Socrates two base men of birth, whose diligence in life time, made them most famous now being deade: the one the sonne of a poore Citizen of Athens named Ariston the other the sonne of a poore Marbler surnamed Sophroniscus
Might not poore Perictione the mother of Plato be glad of such a sonne, that the greatest tyraunt in the worlde, that prowde prince Dionisius woulde honour and reuerence Plato for hys and knowledge, and take him into his Chariote as a Prince, and not as a poore Philosopher? Might not that poore Midwife named Phanaerata reioyce to haue suche a sonne as Socrates, who being prooued of all men best learned, counted of all men most auncient, taken of all men most modest, and grauest: and iudged by the Oracle of Apollo to be wisest in all the worlde.
Howe happie was Elbia How famous was Creithes that noursed two such sonnes, as Cicero and Homer the one the lampe and lanterne of Rome, the other the sugred and sweete Mecenace of al Gréece.
Thus diligence trauell brought them to fame, that being poore men, were honoured of riche men: being base men, were exalted of Princes.
happie countries of suche women: Oh happie women of such children: wise happie children of suche learning and knowledge.
The poore smith which was Demosthenes Father, and the sillie Potter which was Virgils Father, are more renowmed by theyr children this daye being deade, then knowne by their owne wealth being aliue.
Thus muche happened vnto the sillie Smith, and vnto the poore potter, theyr names shall neuer die, while eyther Demosthenes is read, or Virgill hearde.
What might be spoken of that poore Phisition Nichomachus son, meane that famous and learned Philosopher Aristotle which King Phillippe of Macedonia so estéemed, that he counted him selfe happie to haue his sonne Alexander the greate, borne in Aristotles time, whose diligence and studie were such, that he had the garde and tuition of that renowmed conquerour Alexander fiue yeres togither, which was honored of Alexander and so estéemed of King Phillip that Athens being destroyed by Alexander was restored by Aristotle
Suche was the diligence of men, their care and industries, that their large volumes and infinite bookes, are witnesse of their well occupied mindes.
Howe became Plutarchus maister vnto Traian the Emperour? Howe was Seneca appoynted the Tutor and Schoolmaister of the Emperor Nero Howe came Zeno vnto suche fauour with King Antigonus? by diligence, and not by ydlenesse: by trauayle, and not by slouthfulnesse: by learning, and not by ignoraunce.
Why did that great and famous Romane Scipio surnamed Affricanus estéeme so much the poore Poet Aennaeus aliue, that being dead, he caused his picture to be set before his eyes, as pledge of his great loue and earnest good will? Forsooth, for paine and trauaile that Aennaeus tooke with Scipio
Why did Augustus Caesar that wise and godlye Emperour, make so much of Maros bookes? but bicause he was in his time ye lampe of Rome, he honored no lesse his bookes after he was deade, than Octauian embraced him aliue.
The great King Artaxerxes thought him selfe halfe deade, without the company of Hippocrates: Pomponius Atti. thought him happy, when either Cicero was in his or some of his bookes in his bosome.
Alexander neuer went to bedde, without Homer vnder his pillowe.
Who will not prayse the diligence of poore Cleanthes the Philosopher? Who will not commende the trauaile of Plautus ye Historiographer: the one with a Baker, the other with a Bruer, brought vp with suche care, and paine in the daye time, that they might studie in the night time.
Suche was their pouertie and necessitie, that they were vrged to trauayle in the night time: such was their desire and affection vnto learning, that they were willing to studie in the daye time.
Who will not extoll Euclides to take such paine, and to encur suche daunger, to go in the night time in the apparell of a woman, because he might not be knowne, to heare Socrates reade Philosophie? Oh paineful men, oh worthye members of their countrie, that so sought by diligence, that so trauayled by studie and industrye: and in fine so founde by witte and reason the redresse of thinges, to disperse that defused Chaos which time then sayde Cicero had skant opened the doore therevnto.
Then after priuate paine and speciail studie of sundrie men in seuerall countries, it came to that perfection, that from one man in one place, diuers grewe learned and by diligence and trauayle: that from Romulus the first builder and King of the Romanes, Rome in short time had wise and discréete Councelles to gouerne the Citie.
From Solon the first law setter (after Dracog amongst the Athenians by and by, learned and eloquent Oraratours flowed in Athens
From Licurgus amongst the Lacedemonians straight grewe modest and graue Senators called Ephori.
And thus from one in the beginning diuers procéeded foorth in the ende: as the Prophets amongst the Egyptians: the Gimnosophistes amongst the Indians: the Chaldeans amongst the Babilonians: the Sages called Magi amongst the Perseans And so of others in other countries.
And thus by diligence, first commended were all men by pilgrimage, and labour of life, and well recorded in memorie, for the payne and studie that eche famous man in life did for his countrey, his Prince, and his friendes, that hauing finished his pilgrimage of lyfe, meriteth such fame, as shall be to his perpetuall memorie after death.
Of the first inuentours of artes, and of the vse of Soothsaying.
THE worlde beyng raw and not ripe, ignoraunt and not learned, rude and barbarous, without all ciuile pollicie: Nature of it selfe mooued first men to mende maners, instructed ye ignorau~t to seeke and search things vnknowe~, which nature wrought in diuers men in sundry countreys a desire to knowledge, whereby men practized therwith, to the aduauncement and commendation of their Countreys: imitatyng as Cicero saith, nature as a good guide, and a Captaine to finde out which was not knowen.
And because nature was alwayes desirous to be acquainted with arte, as a thing to exornate and beautifie her selfe with knowledge, she first inuented letters as the foundation and the grounde; whence all learnyng do procéede.
After first letters were inuented amongst the Hebrues by Philo brought vnto Gréece by Cadmus practised first in Egypt by Mennon from Egypt vnto Phrygia brought by one named Hercules an Egyptian borne.
Againe, amongst the Hetruscans letters were first inue~ted and written by Demaratus a Corinthian
Amongst the Romaines, as both Plutarchus and Solinus do affirme, the Pilagians brought letters, and first founde the vse thereof.
And some aucthours of great credite, affirme that Nicostrata the mother of Euander the Arcadia~ inuented letters first in Rome.
So Radamanthus in Syria and so others in diuers places of the worlde were studious and carefull to search a way by reason to practise the by wyt, to dispearce that lumpish Chaos which yet for want of knowledge had no perfect forme.
And now letters beyng inuented, came Grammer worthyly to claime the seconde seate of fame.
Whose begynnyng and enteraunce was celebrated by Epicurus vnto Rome, brought by one Crates beyng sent as Embassador from king Attalus vnto the Senators, at the tyme of the seconde wars of Carthage
This beyng the Well, whence flow all other sciences, for from the facultie of writyng and the arte of speakyng, do the rest procéede.
Cicero commendeth one named Antonius Enipho whose schole and reading Cicero long frequented.
The force of Grammer chéefely consisteth in histories and poetry: for poetry is so commended, that both Moyses that mighty ruler of the Hebrues, and Dauid that wise prince of Israel, the one in reducyng his people from Egypt, the red Sea opening a way and geuyng place vnto Moyses to passe through, made exemetron verses in good meters, to thanke God for his good successe and fortune: the other with diuers Hymnes in Meter, and swéete songes to asswage the iust anger of God for his offences.
In poetry excelled Homer and Hesiodus for antiquity, the one in settyng foorth the fame of Mars meane warres: the other in commendyng the payne and diligence of Ceres whch is husbandry, though Linus, Orpheus, Marcellus and others were of great antiquitie, yet not of so great a fame.
Histories and the profite thereof beyng had, as Plini writeth by Cadmus Milesius the firste history whiche was written of any Philosopher, was by Zenophon: but the excellent and worthy fame of historiographers in Gréece afterwarde were iustly noted in Thucidides Herodotus amongst the Romanes in Liui and Salust
Thus from a rude begynnyng, became famous and learned writers.
As for Rethoricke, it was first inuented by Mercury as Horace saith: but as Aristotle and Quintilian do thinke, it was Empedocles then from time to time: from age to age, it came vnto that perfection at length, that Rethoricke was as necessary to be learned euerywhere, as it was profitably to be vsed any where.
The prince of this facultie in Gréece, was Demosthenes who with eloquence long guided Athens, Isocrates, Aeschines and others florished in great fame by this arte in Gréece.
In Rome was Cicero and Salust the fountayne and welspring of all sugred eloquence.
For the beginnyng of Musicke, diuers opinions and sundry assertions are made, where first Musicke was founde.
The most do agrée and iudge, that Orpheus and Liuius some againe thinke that Amphion found Musicke: but how, where, and when it was first founde, it is vncertayne.
But vnto what perfection at length Musicke came, we reade plaine that the Gréekes thought that man not well learned, vnlesse he had some skill in Musicke.
The golden study of Philosophy which as Cicero saith searcheth wisedome, hateth follye, the onely séeker of vertues, and the scurge of vices.
Some suppose that Philosophy was first from the barbarous people brought vnto Gréece, for amongst the auncient Egyptians, Philosophy was first studied and opened by Vulcanus
Amongst the Perseans it was founde by them that were called Magi
Amongst the Babylonians and Assyrians by the Chaldeans which as Laertius doth witnes, were called all wise men.
This arte was sought with great industry, and much honoured in all the world, for that it conteyned all sciences and faculties in it selfe, aswell the life and maners of men, as also the obscure and difficulte nature of all things, with the subtil search of the same in reasoning thereof.
Great contention of Astrologers, which was he that first found the orders and mocions of the heauens: some attributyng the first inuention thereof vnto Prometheus some vnto Belus some vnto Atlas as Plini in his seuenth booke affirmeth.
Wherfore the Poets faine that Atlas doth sustain the skies with his shoulders: some vnto Mercurius some vnto Actinus
The Assyrians boast no lesse of their knowledge in this art.
The course of the Moone was first founde by Endimion
Thus first nature sought such meanes as might set foorth her priuy desire by séeking and trauaylyng for knowledge.
And because Phisicke is not so little to be estéemed, but it ought here well to be mentioned, consideryng the common profite therof, and how painfully was the same studied and trauayled of others in time past.
In the first Apollo was most honoured, in the last Asculapius was chiefly commended, which the Gréekes supposed first that healed woundes.
Afterwarde Hippocrates borne in the Isle of Cous made a lawe, that whosoeuer recouered health, shoulde write his name in the Temple of Asculapius whereby it séemeth that Asculapius was one of the first Phisitions.
The first Phisition that euer came to Rome, came from Peloponesus named Archagathus when L. Aemilius and Marcus Liuius were Consuls in Rome: which when hée came firste to practise there Phisicke, hée was called for the rare sight thereof, first a Butcher, at last a murtherer.
To repeate seueral hearbes, by sundry men found out for this arte, it were ouer long.
Passing ouer briefly, touchyng nothyng but the first dealers and searchers of artes, so come vnto Magick, which was founde as Plini saith of Zoroastes first King of the Bactrians eight hundred yeres before Ilion was made.
This saith Plini myght haue béen better vnsought then founde, for that we sée euery man desirous to be acquainted with deuils, and to bée taught of Simon the secrete counsels of deuyls: in so much that women go vnto schoole with Cirses or Calipso to learne some sorcery withall.
The Egyptians had great felicitie in this arte, insomuch that Pharao commaunded the priestes to shew some feates before him, deridyng Moses and his doynges.
In presence of Moses, they conuerted a rod vnto a Dragon, which when Moses sawe, to suppresse vaine incantations and humaine knowledge, with deuine shewes and examples, and to shewe how much the one excell the other, hée threw his rodde vnto the grounde, and it was translated vnto a Snake, and deuoured the Dragon that the Egyptians enchanted.
Salamon the wise, which at the beginnyng God so aduaunced fauoured, that made and inuented wayes to expell deuyls.
Eleazalus as Iosephus doth write, vsed these ceremonies in expelling and coniuryng of deuils away from any man, to put a ryng in his nosthrilles, hauyng a certaine hearbe, or a roote appointed and named of Salamon within the ring, which roote with his smell driued out deuils, coniuring them not to returne at any time to that man more.
This arte in short time grewe to that credite, and at this time in diuers places is in such honour, that a coniurer is more estéemed then a Preacher.
There are such braunches in this arte, that do well merite praise, for there are diuers kindes of these Magicks, whereby they bragge and boast that they are able to do any thing, and that they know hereby all things.
The first part or rather kinde of Magick is called Nigromancie, which is a kinde of coniuryng of the dead bodies to tell things, as at the warres in Pharsalia betwixt Caesar and Pompeius it was by the ghoste of a dead man vnto Sextus the whole chaunce and euert of that warres, and howe his father Pompeius shoulde loose his head.
The seconde kinde of Magick is called Pyromancy, which is a certen diuination by fire, as Tanaquil, Torquini{us} Priscus wife, when she saw the flames playing about Seruius Tullius head, she affirmed thereby that he shoulde be king in Rome.
The thirde is Aeromancy, which vseth to prognosticate things by the ayre, as by flying fowles, and tempest of weather, as when it rayned Iron in Lucania it did praesage sayde they, the death of Marcus Crassus amongst the Parthians or as Liui writeth, when it rained stones in Picen at the seconde warres of Carthage it was to shewe the slaughter and murther that Hanibal shoulde do in Italy.
is Hydromancy, to iudge things to come by sight of water, as Varro doth report of a boy that sawe ye picture or image of Mercury in the water, pronouncyng and recityng all the warres of Mithridates King of Pont{us} that shoulde folowe in verses.
There are two other kindes of Magick, the one named Giomancy, to declare and expounde thinges by the openyng, gapyng, and moouyng of earth: the other Chiromancy, to iudge by lines of handes cauled Paulmestry.
These are they that Cicero maketh mention of in his first booke of diuinations, where he saith, Cum non sibi sapiunt semitam alijs tamen monstrant viam: they wyll teach others that way that they know not them selues.
They wyll teach others howe to haue money and substaunce, and yet they are them selues poore beggers alwayes in the house of Codrus hangyng at the sléeue of Irus
There is againe a kinde of Soothsaying whiche was first practized in the lande of Hetruria where a certen husbandman plowed.
In the fielde called Tarquimen a certen man appeared in which sprang vp from the grounde which then was plowed, named Tages in face and countenaunce much lyke a young childe: but in wisedome and discretion, farre surmountyng any sage Philosopher.
Plini saith that one Delphos first enuented Soothsaying, and Amphiraus enuented first Soothsaying by fire.
Polidorus describeth another sort of Soothsayers, which were woont to coniecture and foreshowe by beastes slaine to bée sacrificed, whether the heart, the lyuer, or such lyke did perish, as Caesar which when he sacrificed an Oxe vnto Iupiter which had no hart, wherby ye Soothsayers prognosticated the infelicity mishap of Caesar
Afterwarde, likewise king Zerxes in his wars against the Gréekes, a Mare being a stoute warlike beast, brought forth a Hare, a timorous and fearefull thing, whereby they declared the ouerthrowe of Zerxes and his huge armie, the flight and cowardnesse thereof.
Againe there is a kinde of southsaying by lightning, thunders, and tempestes.
The follye of men were such, that they thought nothing to be in the world, but had hidden knowledge concerning
They woulde take nothing in hande, without some Oracles of Iupiter or Apollo
They reposed more trust in flying fowles, in theyr chirping notes, concerning anye attemptes which they tooke in hand, then in their owne force and strength.
They had more confidence in beastes of the fielde: they trusted say more in elementarie sightes.
In fine there was nothing almost, but they had more respect eyther vnto the colour, the voyce, the proportion, and such like toyes, than they had in them selues, as before mencioned in the worshipping of their Goddes, and institution of Religion.
These foolishe toyes, were first obserued amongst ye Chaldeans: from Chaldea vnto Greece from Greece vnto Hetruria from Hetruria vnto Rome from Rome vnto all Europe they were scattered.
Wherefore Moyses that wise Hebrue, and the singuler instrument of God for his people, commaunded that no man shoulde consult with these wicked and abhominable faculties, saying vnto his people, You shall not beléeue southsayers, neyther shall you trust vnto dreames.
The Iewes were so aduced to obserue these augurations, that they woulde not vnto warre at any time, without some warnings and coniectures had by some birde or beast: insomuch, that one Mossolanus a Iewe borne, a wiseman noted in his countrie, and making his voyage vnto warres, as Iosephus in his first booke of Antiquitie doth write, was commaunded and all his hoste to staye, vntill a certaine southsayer woulde go to consult and knowe the successe of the warres: which then they hadde in hande, with a birde harde by the armie, which when this wiseman Mossolanus perceyued howe they were enclined and wholy bent to be instructed by diuination, he tooke his bowe and an arrowe, and slue this birde, whereat the souldiours were so amazed, and the southsayers so angrie, that had not Massolanus perswaded with the people wisely, he had bene lyke, though he was theyr Capitaine, to haue bene by his owne souldiours slaine: which after long tumult made, and great anger threatened, Mosolanus spake after this sort vnto his souldiours: Do you thinke that birdes, beastes, and such like dumbe things, can forshew thinges by you which know nothing of them selues: for beholde, the birde which you trusted most vnto, and likewise your southsayers coulde not sée nor knowe to auoyde my purpose when slue him.
Do you trust that thing for your liues, which is ignoraunt of his owne death? blindenesse of people, which yet remaineth in this age.
And hauing briefly past the inuentors of Sciences, in sundrie countries men were much giuen to finde other necessaries for to liue by, studious to make thinges profitable for theyr countries, carefull to augement the state and life of man vnto such perfections, that the Cyclopians were the first workers of Iron worke: The Lacedemonians the first inuentors of harnesse, speares, swordes and bucklers for warres: people thereby most renowmed.
The Phrigians made first the Chariotes and wagons: The, Lydians vsed first to dresse woolles: And so the people of Caria practised first Bowes arrowes: And the Phenitians the Crossebowe.
Then other perticuler matters were likewise sought out by diuers speciall men, in speciall countries for the vse of man, as Oyle and honye, by Aristeus: Keyes by Theodorus the Samian: Ships to sayle, by Iason: Ericthonius Siluer: Cadmus Goulde.
Thus then euery where eche man in his pilgrimage did some worthie of memorie.
Thrason renowmed for his loftie walles and hye towers: Danaus for his welles, and digging water: Cinira for finding out Copper, brasse, leade, and suche other mettell: Ceres for sowing of Corne: And Baccus for planting the Uine, that the worlde in time waxed not so populus one waye, but it grewe skilfull in thinges, and plentifull of lawes, for the redresse and safegarde of man.
PAtience is such a vertue (saith Cato the wise) in all aduersities, the best medicine to a sickeman, or the surest plaister to any sore, is pacience: it comforteth the heauie, it reioyceth the sadde, it contenteth the poore, it healeth the sicke, it easeth the painefull, it hurteth no man, it helpeth all men: therefore sayde the wiseman Byon that the greatest harme can happen vnto man, is not to be able to sustaine, and absteine.
For this was Tiberius Caesar much commended of Suetonius that hée suffred in frée Cities townes, frée tongues.
Philippe King of Macedonia when certaine Embassadours of Athens came to him, he requiring them if he might stande in any stéede to Athens to certefie him of the same: to whome Demochares one of the Ambassadours aunswered, that the greatest pleasure that he coulde do to Athens was to hange himselfe.
The King most pacient in such skoffes and tauntes, sayde: The reprochefull sclaunder of the Athenians doe make King Phillippe better able to reuenge theyr malice by warres, then to mooue him to aunswere theyr backebiting in wordes.
Prince not onely pacient in hearing, but also wise in aunswering.
As sometime the Emperour Alexander Seuerus in Rome, when it was signified vnto him (after Antonius was dead) that the barbarous nations were ready to enter the Citie of Rome, and that he was muche rebuked of the people, and blamed of the Senators, for the slender care he had vnto the Citie: hée (as Herodianus affirmeth) aunswered, that it belongeth to Princes, to reuenge the good, and not to aunswere the euill: for wisemen will speake euill of no man in the beginning, least they shoulde be iudged fooles in the ende, where into all thinges are directed, and whereby all thinges are prooued.
So pacient was Anaxagoras when it was toulde him that his sonne was deade, to aunswere merily, knowe my sonne was mortall.

But Harpal{us} was of passing patience, being bydden of Astiages King of Persea to supper, where he had two sonnes of his readye drest, and laye in a siluer dishe before him on the table, to be eaten of their owne father.
The king, nay the tyraunt, marked the countenaunce of Harpalus perceyuing him not to be mooued much at the matter, asked him howe hée liked his supper, he without alteration of colour, chaunge of countenaunce, framed himselfe to aunswere the King merily, commending much the supper, as one that knewe that patience was the onely remedy in tirannie.
second Iobe in pacience, he passed Iobe for Iobe knewe how his God did suffer Satan to punish him for loue he had to Iobe but Harpalus perceyued that this tyraunt did this to him of tyrannye and euill will, farre from christianitie, for in this vale of misery, wée count him wise, and certayne we may call him most wise, that can in prosperitie be gentle, and in aduersitie be pacient.
Both these examples were séene in one man in one daye at Rome.
Paulus Aemilius hauing his two sonnes, the hope of Rome, and comfort of the father, the one deade foure dayes before the triumphs of Macedonia the other, thrée daies after ye triumph, returning from Macedonia with that noble victory, with such triumphes vnto Rome that no man coulde finde in his heart to tell this noble Romane of the heauinesse in Rome, and of the death of his childre~, a ruthfull thing it was to ioyne to such great ioyes, victories, and triumphes, such wofull chaunce, sadnesse and mourning, but fortune accompanieth the one with the other: This noble Romane perceyuing the people of Rome to be so sadde, and he so merrye, they so heauy with sobbes and sighes, hée so glad of his triumphes and victories, demaunded the cause, but being at length knowne, he then comforted them, that shoulde comfort him, saying: thanke the Goddes more to gyue me victories ouer my enimies, to the glorye and fame of Rome, then accuse fortune to spoyle me of my children, which by nature were borne to dye: though much it be to my gréefe, yet wish the gods to tender ye like to the father, as they did to the sonne, so that the like conquest and glorie happen to Rome.
Some men are pacient in thinges, as in a corporall paine: some in tormentes: another is pacient of iniuries done, commende them both, but to be pacie~t in al kind of afflictions aduersitie, heauen earth commendeth him.
That is a kinde of pacience, which Plini applyed to Anarchus saying: Of all men, one man Anarchus Augustus most patient in tormentes.
So were the Egyptians people of great patience, they had rather die in tormentes with patience, than to betraye any man.
The Gimnosophistes of India were so patient, that from Sunne rising vntill night, vpon the hote sande, without meate and drinke (sayth Plini from one seate to another, to beholde the heauens, the Sunne, the Moone. &c.
The Lacedemonians most pacient in trauayle, payne, winde, weather, and warres.

Bicause pacience is better knowne by reading of diuers Princes anger and wrath, will them to reade the chapter of anger, where they shall sée what hurt was done, what wickednesse was committed by impaciencie, which might haue béene redressed and saued by patience: wherefore auoyding prolixitie, it shall be spoken in the one, what wanteth in the other.
pages missing] reade sayde he, that seueritie waxed vnto tyranny, and tyranny in a Prince worketh his destruction: and that lenitie is the most soundest state in a Prince, who séeth not the experience thereof.
Certenly Nero, Caligula and Heliogabolus were neuer so cruell as these thrée noble Emperours Augustus, and Seuerus were gentle and méeke.

What a noble vertue is humanity in a Prince? what excellency in a noble man? what an ornament in a gentleman? what commendation in all men: insomuch that the Snakes of Syria the Serpents of Terinthia the Scorpions in Arcadia want no due deserued praise of Plini for their gentlenesse, and sparyng of their natiue soyle, though they waxe cruell in others.
What humanity was in Scipio hauyng taken captiue Hasdrubal King Masinissa his nigh kinsman, to restore him whom againe without ra~some?

The onelye remedie, the sure waye to winne good will at the subiectes, is alwayes for Princes to be curteous and gentle.
Such pittie was founde in that gentle Emperour Aurelian when hée woulde haue entered vnto the Citie called Tiaena the gates being shut against him, he did send his Herauldes to signifie, vnlesse the gates should be opened, he would not leaue one dogge aliue within the Cittie.
The Citie more stoute then wise, refused to open theyr gates, vntill with force of warres, the walles were battered downe, and the Citie in the hande of the Emperour to doe what it lyked him.
The souldiours gréedie of the spoyle, were by the gentle and mercifull Emperour, charged not to meddle with any within the Citie vntill they had licence.
The Emperour being charged by the souldiers of promise, to kill and to spoyle all, and not to leaue a dogge aliue: Kept promise being a Prince, destroyed all the dogges of the Cittie, and restored againe the Citie vnto the inhabitauntes thereof.
This noble Aurelian had rather his souldiours shoulde want, than that they shoulde not shewe mercie, according vnto his custome to the comfortlesse.
Zerxes the great King of Persea with lenitie and gentlenesse towardes his brother Arimenes with whome before he was a great enimie, made his foe his friende, brought his enimie before, to be his naturall brother then.
Porus a famous Prince of India being conquered by Alexander the great, fearing that pittie might not haue place in the heart of such a great conquerour, sought nothing else of Alexander (which willed him to aske any thing, and he shoulde haue it) but clemencie, this vertue long wayted vpon Alexander vntill pride the roote of al mischiefe corrupted his gentle heart, vntill he was by the Medes and Perseans perswaded to be the sonne of Iupiter
So gentle before, that King Darius did wishe eyther to conquer Alexander bicause he might shewe curtesie vnto Alexander: or else to be conquered by Alexander.
Aeneas Siluius was woont to saye, the saying of Sigismonde the Emperour, that happie are those Princes that foster vp clemencie in Court, and prudent is those Princes that vseth humanitie in their cities.
It was no small proofe of humanitie in the Senatours of Rome, at the buriall of Siphax King of Numidia which being taken by the Romanes, and kept in Tiberius house according to marshall lawe, and before he was raunsomed by the Numedians dyed at Rome, where suche solemnitie, honour, pompe was shewed at his funerall: such giftes giuen, such liberalitie vsed, as if Siphax had died amongst his owne subiects, hée might haue wanted to haue such glorious buriall in Numantia being their king, as he had in Rome being their Prisoner.
That is worthy humanity, that is shewed vnto me~ in aduersity: and that is méere clemencie that is done vnto those banished straungers, as the Romaines sometime did vnto Prusias king of Bithinia who being driuen to exile by hys sonne Nicomedes came vnto Rome, where humanitie and clemencie were fostered, and nourished in the Senate, being mette at Capua (a Citie sometime by Hannibal conquered) of Scipio and Cornelius and brought vnto Rome, not like a banished man, but lyke a noble Prince, with such triumphes and honour done vnto him, with such passing curtesie, and liberality of Senators, that though he was banished Bithinia his kingdome, and by Nicomedes his owne sonne, yet was he receyued vnto Rome of straungers, and that to the fame of Rome.
Thereby the Romanes grewe to that admiration with all people, that for their lenitie, and surmounting curtesie, they were of all men beloued: and for their valiauntnesse and magnanimity, they likewise were of all the worlde feared.
For as vnto Siphax and Prusias woonderfull clemencie and humanity were by the Romanes tendered: so vnto Ptholome King of Egypt, being of his owne brother banished, and by the Romanes receyued, and restored againe vnto his kingdome, the like was shewed.
Rome then was called the hauen of succour, the Anker of trust, the keye of curtesie, where all succourlesse Princes, and noble Cappitaines fledde.
Rome florished then, while pittie and mercy continued, Rome prospered: while humanitie and clemencie were fostered, Rome excelled all men in gentlenesse and pittie.
When Marcellus and Matellus the one Capitaine of Siracusa the other in Celuberia The noble Capitaine Marcellus was so pittifull, that after his souldiours had conquered Siracusa, with great slaughter and murther of men, women, and children: he mounted vp into a high Tower of the Castle, and there with wéeping and lamenting the ruefull sight of Siracusa more like to one conquered, than a conquerer: to a Prisoner, than a Prince: that anye that sawe him the~, might rather iudge Marcellus a Siracusan captiue, than a Romane Capitaine.
Happie was Siracusa (sith fortune was no better) to happen on such a gentle conquerour, which was so glad for his owne victorie, as he was sorrowfull for the fall of Siracusa
That renowmed Romane Maetellus, besieging the great City Centobrica, in the countrie of Celtiberia: whe~ he perceyued theyr broken, theyr walles ready to and victorie nigh at hande, hée began to be mooued with pittie, and mercie possest chiefe place in his heart, that when the women of the Citie brought their children on theyr armes to craue mercy at Maetellus hand, he auoyded the calamitie and misery that was redy to fall on Centobrica, spared the Citie, remooued his campe, being with pittie and mercie of the ruthfull women, and innocent children quite conquered.
Thus gentle Maetellus where he might haue bene a Conquerour ouer men, he suffered himselfe to be conquered by little infantes.
Rome, happie were those golden dayes, wherin through clemencie and gentlenesse, thou wast as much loued and honored, as thou hast béene by valyaunt Capitaines trembled and feared at.
Pompeius the greate, when Tigranes King of Armenia, being by him conquered, had knéeled before Pompeius face, yéelding his crowne and scepter at Pompeius his foote, and himselfe vnto his gentlenesse as a captiue: Tooke him in his armes, embraced him, put his Crowne on his heade, and restored him to the kingdome of Armenia againe.
The like courtesie vsed he towarde Mithridates King of Pontus being deade, for his royall buriall, though the knewe well the great hatred that Mithridates had fortie yeares against the Romanes, yet in stéede of iust reuengement, Pompeius vsed princely clemencie.
The gentlenesse that was then vsed in Rome, yea betwixt foes, was such, that Iulius Ceasar that valiaunt Emperour and Conquerour, was as willing to reuenge the death of his great enimy Pompeius, vpon Photina and Bassus, who slue Pompeius and sent his heade vnto Caesar as L. Paulus was courteous and fauorable to his most mortall foe Persen.
Hanniball, though he was counted the most and greatest enemye that euer Rome felt, yet mooued with that clemencie, that he won more commendations for the buriall of P. Aemilius, Gracchus, Marcellus these noble Romanes, then he wan fame by ouercoming thrée thousande Romanes in fielde.
The chiefe fame that Hanibal was worthy of, was for humanity and gentlenesse, as proued by these two noble Romanes before mentioned, which Hanibal caused their carkasses diligently to bée sought for in the feelde, and solempnely to bée buryed with honour and renowme though they were his enimies: and as Hanibal was much commended in Rome, and of the Romanes, onely for humanity: so was he feared much in Rome for his prowisse and valiaunt déedes of armes.
Polycrates, that tiraunt of Samos, was chéefely commended for his gentlenesse and curtesie shewed towardes women which were the wiues and mothers of the dead souldiers, in restoring them vnto libertie, in geuing them wealth to liue, great charge that no man shoulde do them any wrong.
Augustus the Emperour, when hée behelde in the Citie Alexandria, the sworde wherewith Marcus Antonius slewe him selfe, coulde not refraine teares to shewe his humanitye, in opening his clemency of nature vnto his enemie, commaunded he should be honourably buryed with his deare fréende Cleopatra in one graue.
Cicero in his first booke of Tusculan commendeth much the clemency of Cleobulus and Biton in shewing such loue and obedience to their mother, which being in her Chariot, redy to go to the solempne feast of the goddesse Iuno, the horses sodainly dyed: hauing no other remedy, lest their mother should go a foote, yoked themselues to drawe the Chariot tenne miles, to their immortall praise and commendations.
remember of a history in Patritius of one Simonides, which for that hée was mooued with pittie to bury a dead corps, left in the way where no man woulde put him vnto the earth, as hée was passing with his felowes ouer Seas, that night before they should saile in the morning, appeared vnto Simonides the selfe same man which he had buried vpon the way, warning him that day not to go to Sea: which when hée shoulde take shipping, he remembring his dreame, tolde it vnto his felowes, desiring them to stay that day: but his company laughing him to scorne, leauing Simonides on the shoores, sayled vnto the Seas, where in sight of Simonides, the Shippe and all his felowes were lost.
The lyke pitie séene in Simon the son of that valiaunt Greeke Miltiades who being elected Generall ouer the Athenians, against the great and force of puissaunt Zerxes, in the warres of Marathon which was nothing inferiour vnto his renowmed father in prowesse, but farre passed him in clemencye and curtesie.
young man for his lenitie pitie, ioyned with valiauntnesse, appoynted by the people of Athens to encou~ter with Zerxes whom his father Miltiades often plaged: he then at the first time of his magnanimity tried, enforced Zerxes after spoyle of souldiours and victorie of fielde, to flye vnto Persea: So pitifull that hée payde a great some of money, to haue his father buried.
Milciades, which after many conquestes and fawning fortune in victories, died in prison, whose death and buriall, prooued no lesse loue and faythfulnesse towardes his father in Simon, then it shewed euidentlye the pittie and mercy he had in redéeming his fathers corpes to be buried.
Wherefore that pittifull Emperour Alexander Seuerus, being demaunded what is that, which is chiefe felicitie in this worlde, sayde, to foster friendes with benifites and gentlenesse: and to reconcile foes with pitty and rewardes.
Alphonsus, at what time certen dogges barked at him, tooke a toaste out of his cuppe, and cast it to the Dogge, then saying: gentlenesse and clemencye shall make foes friendes.
knowe not what greater humanitie coulde be in Vaspasianus the emperour, after that Vitellus had kilde his brother Sabinus and had long persecuted Vaspasians sonne: yet he being subdued, spared not to shew gentlenes to Vitellius his daughter, with a great some of money towarde hir mariage.
Aegesilaus King of the Lacedemonians, after he had the victorie of Corinth, was not so glad of his conquest, as he lamented the deathes of so many Athenians and Corinthians sayde as Plutarch doth witnesse, wéeping: Gréece, thou spillest more men with ciuil by discorde, than woulde defende thy state against all the worlde with courage.
To vse victorie gently, is more famous, than to conquer cruellye.
As that Emperour Adrian was woont to saye, that Princes ought rather with Pittie to saye: this can doe, then with tirannye to saye: this will doe. Augustus that most pittifull Prince, after he had conquered that famous Cittie Alexandria, which the great conquerour Alexander had made, and named it according to his owne name, béeing mooued with pittie, stirred with mercy, in sight of the Citizens, which hoped to haue nothing but death, sayde: for the beautie of your Citie, and memorie of Alexander, for the loue haue vnto Prius your Philosopher, and for the pittie beare vnto you all, spare vnto you, your Cittie, and graunt you life.
swéete sounding wordes, from a pittifull Prince, not muche vnlike his predicessor Iulius Caesar, his owne mothers brother, who after vanquishing of Pompeius, at Pharsalia, sent letters vnto Rome, of loue professed, of suche friendshippe promised, that though Pompeius was the onely ioye of Rome, the long delight of Romanes, the defender and meintainer of theyr name, and fame: yet being conuicted, they receyued Caesar as an other Pompeius, for that he vsed humanitie, and shewed gentlenesse, euen vnto his enimies, for noble heartes ought to co~temne cruelty, princes mindes ought to abhor tirannye.
simple sparow, which to auoyd ye griping pawes of a hungry Sparhaucke, that woulde haue prayed vppon him, fledde vnto Artaxerxes bosome being in campe, where after long panting aswell for feare, as for wearinesse in Artaxerxes bosome, he sayd: It is as litle masterie vnto a Prince, or commendation to a valiant Capitaine to destroye that which of it selfe doth yéelde, as it is a fame vnto Artaxerxes, to kyll this poore Sparow, that fled for succour: saying againe, beholding the Sparrowe: As will not betraye thée (thou little Sparrowe, for that thou hast fledde for helpe vnto Artaxerxes, so will neuer deceyue anye man that will haue confidence in me.
If this pittie of Artaxerxes was shewed vnto a Sparrowe, how much ought Princes to shewe the same vnto men? Antigonus though he was a great enimie vnto Pirrhus, as Princes bée during the time of warre, being slayne of a silye woman in Argos, and hys heade brought by Alcyoneus vnto his father King Antigonus thinking to please his father much to bring King Pirrhus head, which long had molested Antigonus aliue: but the king perceauing the cruell tiranny of his sonne, to delite in dead mens heades, tooke the staffe whereon his sonne Alcioneus caried the head, in stéede of thankes which hée looked for at his fathers handes, hée was well and worthily rewarded with stripes, tooke Pirrhus head very honourably, deckt and couered it, and after long looking theron, hée co~maunded his son Helenus to cary it vnto the kingdome of Epire, where Pirrhus in life time was King, there to bée buried according vnto the custome of ye Epirotes by king Alexa~der his own brother.
The like history is writte~ in Herodot{us} of King Darius which yéelded thankes vnto those that brought Histeus head, as Antigonus did vnto his sonne Alcioneus saying: do as litle ioy to sée Histeus head, being dead, as do lament much such tiranny and cruelnesse to bée in you, who neuer sawe King Darius so cruell to any man aliue, as you are cruell vnto Histeus being dead.
As Darius was gentle of him selfe, so hée greatly estéemed those that were gentle: insomuch hée being at the point of death, euen at that time when hée was so weake that hée knew not Polistratus that gaue a litle water to refreshe his heart, sayde: Whosoeuer thou bée knowe thée not: and for that am not able to thanke thée, Alexander shall and wyll requite thy gentlenesse: and the gods shall thanke Alexander for his clemency and humanity towarde my mother, my wife and children, and with that hée stretched foorth his hande, and sayde: Haue mée recommended vnto Alexander, and bryng him this my right hande, and tell him that Bessus kylled Darius, whom thou didst sée dying.
Which when it was tolde by Polystratus vnto Alexander hée much lamented his death, caused his body to bée brought with great honour, and precious clothes: and with all solempnitie that might bée made vnto his mother named Sisigambis
Thus worketh clemency and humanity, that those two famous Princes, Alexander and Darius, two mortall enemies alwayes: and yet not forgetting eche others courtesie, at deathes doore either of them in loue with the other: For their humanitie one to another, Darius at his death, repeating Alexanders gentlenesse towardes him, and Alexander requiting Darius gentlenesse being dead.
The greatest fame or commendation that may happen vnto any man, is to bée counted gentle and curteous, therein are diuers vertues knitted and ioyned in fréendship, as pitie, mercy, wisedome, and affability, with others: so that the property of those men are alwayes, though they can hurt, yet neuer to hinder.
It is proper to an euill man to offende: so is the nature of the good and gentle, to forgiue.
Pisistratus shewed both wisedome and curtesie vnto certaine dronkardes, who hauing in theyr drinke vsed wanton spéech vnto his wife, and being sober the next morning, came to Pisistratus to aske him forgiuenesse for theyr lewde talke vnto his wife: hée gently sayde, learne to be more sober another time.
knowe my wife was not out of hir house yesterdaye, excusing his wife wisely, and pardoning them gently.
Howe gently dyd Alexander Seuerus vse Camillus though he rebelled against him, and by sleight thought to be Emperour of Rome, and for that being condemned to die by the Senate, yet he was pardoned by Alexander
Howe courteous was Fabius Maximus to forgiue Marsius one of his chiefe Capitaines, his treasons and snares that he vsed against his mayster Fabius with the enimies.
Such gentlenesse did Zerxes the great, shewe vnto certaine Gréekes, who were as espialles to vew the hoste and power of King Zerxes sent from Athens and being taken and brought before the king, he not only gently dismissed them without any punishment, but shewed them courteously all his hoste and force of souldiours.
The greatest victorie is lightly alwayes gotten by gentlenesse, as Alphonsus King of Aragon by gentlenesse wonne Careta: Marcellus wonne Siracusa: Metellus, Seluberia as you haue hearde before mencioned.
Plutarch resiteth a passing historie of great curtesie and humanity in king Belenus towarde his sonne Antigonus who being maried to a fayre woman, fell in loue with his fathers wife (for his mother was deade) and his father maried the daughter of Demetri{us} King of Macedonia named Estrabonica a younge woman of excellent beautie: for this therefore the Kings sonne languished in loue, that he was lyke to die, vnknowne vnto his father: which when his knewe of, hée caused his owne wife to be maried vnto his sonne Antigonus rare clemencie and great gentlenesse for a manne to giue his wife to please his friends: Pittie accompanieth this excellent vertue clemencie, that we reade in holy scriptures, that diuers good men ceassed not to bewayle and wéepe euer the state of their enimies.
néede not here to recite Pericles the Athenian who willed that the deade souldiours shoulde be buried in the warres of Peloponesus nor of Hanibals curtesie in the warres of Carthage for the buriall of Romane enimies.
But Moyses, that man of God brought with him from Egypt, the boanes of Ioseph.
Tobias and Machabeus mercifull men commended likewise solemne buriall for the deade souldiours.
And Iehu King of Israell, caused his enimie Iezabelem to be honorably buried, but as white is better discerned by the blacke, than by any colour else, so shall humanitie and gentlenesse most appéere excellent in reading the title of tyranny, where by conferring both togither, the excellencie of the one is manifest, the terrour of the other is odious.
The gentlenesse and pittie that our Sauiour Iesus Christ shewed vnto Marie Magdelen, the lewde woman, vnto the prodigall childe, vnto Peter that denied him, vnto the Théefe that hanged with him, vnto Daniell in the denne, to Susanna in the fire, to Ionas in the water, was nothing else, but examples left for our learning· to be gentle one vnto another, euen as Iesus Christ was vnto vs all, thus ending as Cicero sayde of Caesar that Caesar extolling Pompeius being deade, and setting vp his pictures, did extoll his owne name: so that the clemencie that menne vse to shewe vnto others, doth aduance their owne fame.
Of sober and temperate Princes, and where temperaunce and sobrietie vvere most vsed.
SO much was this noble vertue of temperaunce estéemed with auntient people, that they thought the greatest plesure the happiest life was to abstaine from desired meate and drinke.
So muche was this sobrietie of life commended of learned Philosophers, that Anacharsis that famous Scithian was woont to write about the painted pictures of Princes, this little lesson, Rule lust: Temper tongue: And bridle the bellie.
Whereby the Philosopher diligentlye perswaded Princes to be temperate of life, to be sober in talke, and to abstaine from filthy féeding.
For, to subdue appetites, to vanquishe luste, to suppresse pleasure is a worthie conquest.
He is a worthie Uictour, a famous conquerour, a puissaunt Prince, that can ouercome his owne affections: for euen as Fishes are taken with hookes, so men, sayth Plato are alured with pleasure.
It is the greatest vertue that can be in man sayth the Poet, to abstaine from pleasure.
To auoyde these baytes, these swéete pleasures, wise Princes haue lothed banquetting and drinking: in so much that Iulius Caesar that famous Emperour of Rome, for his singuler sobrietye and passing temperaunce, the verye lampe and lantorne of Europe, for his abstinence the onely mirrour of Italy who by ouercomming of himselfe, ouercame all Europe.
Of this Emperour woulde Cato of Vtica say, though he was a mortall enemie vnto Caesar for that Caesar vsed the companie of Cato sister that one sober Caesar should subdue Rome: his abstinence was such (sayth Plim that most rare or neuer woulde this Emperour drinke wine.
Agesilaus king of the Lacedemonians passing through the countrey of Thasius, being met with the nobles, and saluted the people with diuers dainties, and rare banquets, to welcome the king vnto the countrie: notwithstanding, he touched not their daineties, fedde onely with breade and drinke, to satisfie the expectations of the Thasians
And being earnestly requested, and humblye sought, and in maner enforced (least he shoulde séeme vngratefull, not to eate their meates) he commaunded his footemen and slaues, Helotes, to féede if they woulde on suche· chéere, saying, that princes might not so pamper the~ selues with damtie chéere and wines, but with abstinence and temperancie: The one is incident (sayde he) vnto vice, and shame, the other a nource vnto vertue and fame: for in eating and drinking, lyeth hidden that sucking Serpent named forgetfulnesse.
To auoyde therefore gluttonie and dronkennesse, which are often tendered vnto Princes.
Constantius that most temperate Emperour, kept him alwayes so hungrie, that he woulde take of a poore woman, a crust of breade to satisfie hunger.
It was Licurgus lawe in Sparta and Zaleucus rule in Locresia, to abstaine from fine meate, and swéete wine, as from an enimie vnto Princes: for wisemen were woont to say, that meate is onely good to expell hunger, and drinke to breake thirst.
King Cirus in warres, béeing demaunded of his hoste, what he would haue prouided against dinner: breade sayde Cirus, for drinke wée shall not want, meaning as Amianus sayth, water.
This vertue of abstinence was so honoured then, that Princes which were giuen to wine, were odious vn the worlde.
great shame it were in Thebes, in Leonidas time, to make banquetes, for when Epaminondas, that passing Prince of temperaunce, was willed of a rich Citizen being his friende, to come to a supper: where he founde such superfluous chéere, such excesse of meate and drinke, that he sayde (being much offended with his friende) that he thought he was willed to come to eate like a man, and not to féede lyke a beast.
This Prince knew the inconuenience of féeding, and againe knewe the commoditie of abstinence.
number of excellent vertues do follow abstinence, as continencie, chastitie, sobrietie, and wisedome.
heape of vices waite on pampering Princes, as glotonye, lecherie, dronkennesse, and suche others.
Such was the temperaunce of great King Porus of India that breade and water was his accustomed chéere.
Suche was the abstinence of Massinissa King of Numidia béeing foure score yeares olde, that he fed hungerly alwayes, and not daintily at anytime.
Suche was the temperaunce of that noble Pericles, and of that Gréeke Tymon, that Aelianus in his booke of diuers histories, commendeth the abstinence of the one, and Cicero in his booke of friendeshippe, extolleth the temperaunce of the other: and so ioyntly these two noble Gréekes did auoyde alwaye banqueting and belly chéere, forsooke and fledde the companye of drinkers, as thinges more noysome than profitable: more daungerous then helthie: more filthily than friendly.
Demetrius king sometime of Macedonia, and sonne vnto Antigonus being much giuen to féeding and pampering of him selfe, grewe to that lust and lecherie, that being not sufficed with diuers stately strumpetes, and curious Curtezaunce, as with that renowmed Lamia, famous Crisidies, diamonde Dama, and such other daintie dames, fell to lust of a young Gentleman of Gréece, of amorous countenaunce, of passing beautie, and of such a princely porte, with séemly shamefastenesse endued, that then comming from Athens vnto Macedonia, to serue as a souldiour vnto king Demetrius, sought diuers meanes to accomplishe his inordinate lust by eating and drinking with this young Democles and with diuers attemptes to haue his purpose, folowed him priuily where Democles went a bathing vnto a close chamber, where Demetrius hid himselfe vntill the young man was naked, and then on a sodaine enterprised his lust: which when Democles sawe the King, and perceyued his wicked entent, to auoyde the shamefull acte and filthy luste of the king, and to maintaine temperaunce of life, and euerlasting fame of abstinence, he lept naked into a great séething vessel, of whote boyling water, and finished his noble lyfe, with famous death.
renowmed Democles! vile and shamefull Demetrius! thy death is famous, his life is infamous: thy temperaunce and vertue commended, his lust and wickednesse, iustly of all men condemned.
The like historie doth Plutarch write of Trebonius, a young souldiour, of a younger Capitaine named Lucius, and Nephew vnto that noble Romaine Caius Marius
This Lucius hauing a charge ouer certaine souldiours appoynted of his Uncle Marius then Generall, hauing a long while deuised meanes to bring hys purpose to passe, in accomplishing his luste with Trebonius happened on such a season, that he found Trebonius by him selfe alone, and offering violence vnto him, Trebonius vnderstanding his Capitaines desire, made as though he shoulde spéede, came imbracing him, and thrust him to the heart with Lucius owne dagger, and so slue his Capitaine to auoyde infamie: which when it came to Marius his eare, that his nephew was slaine by Trebonius, the cause thereof being demaunded by Marius, being orderly declared by Trebonius, where as it was thought he shoulde be hanged, drawne, and quartered, and suffer most ignominious death, he was rewarded with a crowne of Golde vpon his heade, written about with this sentence.
Had Demetrius King of Macedonia embraced sobrietye of féeding, Democles had not bene so famous by abstinence as Demetrius might haue bene renowmed with temperaunce.
Had that Romane Lucius loued continencie, as Trebonius honored chastitie, Trebonius had not had of Marius his Uncle Luci{us} the prayse, the garlande of commendacions, and he so vilde and shamefull a death.
Certainely, when the people of Athens fed with figges: the Arcadians with Acornes or with Walnuts: the Argiues with Pearsley: the Terinthians with Peares: the Scithians with herbes, the inhabitauntes of Carmenia and Meotica with poore fare: yea, before corne was sowne, the whole worlde fedde with fruites, which our olde mother the earth naturally brought foorth.
Then kingdomes and nations were ruled by lawe of Nature, to embrace temperauncie, to honor abstinencie, and to obserue chastitie: which since grewe to that aboundancie and excesse, that the lawe of God, which was first, the lawe of nature which was the seconde, and the lawe of Princes which was the last, coulde not kéepe men from excesse of meate, which onely was the cause of the sinking of Sodom and Gomorrhe the often plague of Israelites, the iust confusion of gluttons and drunkardes.
When the Gymnosophistes of India, fedde only with Apples, when the Priestes of Egypt abstayned from fleshe and wine, fedde with breade and Oyle, when the sages of Persea fed with fruites and hearbes: Then temperance beare rule, then sobrietie gouerned, then abstinence was honoured, then Egypt florished through temperaunce, and now spoyled with gluttonye.
Then India prospered through continencie and sobrietie, and now vanquished by dronkennesse and Then Persea was famous, and conquered kingdomes by abstinence, and now conuicted and conquered by aboundancie and excesse.
Where is learned Athens famous Sparta, sttately Thebes while temperaunce dyd rule, feared of all Kinges, and after by meanes of excesse, hated and destroyed of all Princes.
All the while that the Lacedemonians obserued the lawe of Licurgus in abstayning from braue banquettes and excesse of chéere: yea, when they might not passe vnto Asia for feare they shoulde be alured and entised with the sight of the iunkets of Asia then saith Cicero were the people of Sparta so temperate, that the men did neuer sitte with women, nor the women with the menne.
When the Milesians had made a lawe, as Theophratus doth witnesse, that neyther theyr wiues, theyr daughters, nor theyr maydes might taste wine, neyther durst any man by the same lawe prayse any wine in presence of women: for wine causeth heate, heate, mooueth lust, lust causeth murther.
Wherefore wise men write that it is daungerous to prayse thrée thinges in presence of people.
man to prayse the beautie of his wife, for feare of fornicatours, for so did king Candales of Lidia prayse his wife vnto his friende Giges that he was murthered therby, and the Quéene his wife afterward maried vnto Giges
To bragge of his riches and substaunce, for so did Sichaeus shewe his substaunce vnto Pigmalion King of Tire maried the kinges sister named Eliza and yet slaine by the selfe same Pilgmalion king of Tire, and his owne brother in lawe: Euen so to commend swéete wine in presence of people, breéedeth a desire vnto lust, and lust vnto death.
The famous Romanes for a long while kept a straite order to obserue temperaunce, that the Ladies and matrones of the Citie of Rome, might in no wise be suffered to drinke wine, for abstinence is the onely keye of temperauncy: so straight was this lawe lookt vnto, that Eg. Maecenus slue his owne wife, as Plini recordeth, for that she loued wine, and was by the lawe of Romulus made for that purpose, saued from death.
In the same place of Plini it is read, that a certaine matrone of Rome was iudged to die, for that shée had a priuie keye vnto a Celler of wine.
So nie did they obserue this temperaunce, that Cato the Censor appoynted by lawe certaine men to kisse the women of Rome, to knowe whether they smelled of wine by their breath.

This abstinence was fostred as a nourse vnto chastitie, and temperaunce, then Princes lothed vice, and loued vertue: then they abhorred gluttonie and dronkenesse, and honored abstinence and sobrietie.
The learned and sage Philosophers, and men of passing abstinence and sobrietie, being no lesse studious than carefull of temperaunce, despised banquettes, refused feastes, lothed and defied belly chéere, that being allured of Princes, entised of noble men, sought of all men, forsooke and fledde from the same, saying: we eate to liue, we liue not to eate.
worthy and golden sentence to be obserued, Rather hadde Diogines féete and licke dishes at Athens than to féede daintilye at Alexanders table.
Rather had that learned Gréeke, noble Zeno drinke water, and féede poorely as an example vnto his Schollers vnto temperaunce, to come by abstinence, than to pamper his belly at Antigonus Princely table, to shewe them the waye vnto glu and dronkennesse.
Rather had Plato forsake Dionisius table, than to abstaine from his woonted philosophicall chéere.

Anacharsis a Scithian Philosopher, being demaunded of his estate howe hée fedde, how he did lie, and how he was clothed, aunswered: féede on hunger, lye on the grounde, and am clothed like a Scithian.
The famous Athenia~ Aristides at what time King Dionisius made suite for his daughter to mariage, though he was a puissaunt Prince, a mightie king, yet for his gluttonny and prodigall drinking, for his tirranny and excesse, Aristides who abhorred such vices in Princes, soberly and temperately answered: that he had rather kill his daughter with hys owne hande, then to giue his daughter in mariage vnto Dionisius
So odious vnto good Princes was that excesse of eating and prodigall drinking, and so highlye estéemed was abstinence and temperaunce, that in Athens a long while in the temple of Ceres that of all the lawes of Triptolemus thrée onely commaundementes as Zenocrates sayth, were highly obserued.

most goulden worlde, when neyther wine nor banquets were knowne: then chastitie was honored in the temple of Vaesta then temperaunce frequented the Capitoll of Iupiter then luste knew no way to the pallace of Caesars then abstinence walked in the market place, then all Rome was chast.
Then Rome triumphed, when kinges were depriued for lecherie towarde Lucretia Then Rome merited fame, when the princely office of Decem viri were banished for the rape of Virginia
When Scipio Affricanus had ouercommed the famous citie of Carthage and Numantia he was not so valiant by his great renowmed conquest, as he was famous by abstinence: for when he triumphed as a valiaunt victor, a certaine noble younge Uirgin, that for hir passing beauty and great admiration of person, was presented vnto Scipio as a rare gift, whose beautie and excellencie though Scipio a long time was amazed thereat, yet had such respect to abstinence, as a thing belonging vnto a prince, specially vnto a conquerour, that ouercame kingdomes, and countries, not to be subdued by luste, trusted not his souldiours to guide and garde this Uirgin, but with his presence, brought hir home to hir father vnto Campania saying: were it not that am a conquerour, hadde not béene able to bring thy daughter home.
greater conquest surely it was of Scipio to ouercome himselfe, tha~ to subdue Numantia or Carthage That lesson worthy of a prince he learned of Alexander the great, who thought it a shame vnto a conquerour of men, to bée conquered by women: and though in diuers aucthours and places, this prince is noted a glutton and drunkard, yet of woonderful abstincence towardes women, which is rare founde in a drunken Prince: For when Alexander came vnto Illyria vnto the Temple of Iupiter where he saw a passing faire woman, of comely beauty: vewing styll the comely state of her person, and féeding him selfe a long season with the sight thereof, his counsellour and great fréende Ephaestion perceyuyng that Alexander was taken in the Briers of beautie, saide: It is not méete that Alexander should want any thing that hée wisheth for, to whom Alexander aunswered: neither is it an honour vnto Alexander that ouercame al men, to be ouercome by one woman.
The modestie and continencie of Princes haue béene such, that they refused the company of their owne wiues, and went to wildernesse solitarily to liue, to auoyde the occasion of lust, and to embrace the cause of temperauncie, as Amoebeas and Dionysius surnamed Histrio beyng marryed both to faire women.
Clitomachus was of such modesty, that hée might not abide in place, whether hée were at supper or else where filthy talke was ministred, but he woulde auoyde the place and the person as Plini saith where any inciuility was: and true it is, yll language corrupt good maners.
reade in Valerius a worthy Romane historye of one Spurina a young gentleman of the Citie of Rome, whose amorous countenaunce, woonderfull beautie, and passing state of person, surmounted all the Ladies of Rome, but not so beautifull outwarde, as hée was modest and temperate inwarde: and lest hée shoulde séeme with his outwarde beautie to enflame the Romane Ladyes and Uirgines of the Cittie to lust, hée so deformed his body, and mangled his face with his owne hande, that from the fearest creature that was in Rome, hée became the most deformed man in all the worlde, in so much all Rome knewe him not.
Spurina is more famous by his modestie therein, then hée is nowe renowmed for his beautie: the one passeth like a flowre in short time, the other without prescription of time hath immortall fame.
Men haue béene in the worlde that subdued lust, ouercame them selues: yea, and though attempted with great allurementes, yet temperaunce saued and preserued them, that Valerius saith that Phrine a passing fayre woman, came vnto Zenocrates the Philosophers bedde, and being all night in bedde with him coulde not winne the Philosopher with all hyr trickes to venery, that the next daye being demaunded where she laye all night, with an ymage of a man shée said, or with a mans picture.
The like of Socrates though he were maried to two wiues, doth Zenophon report, that on a certaine time Socrates being in taulke with a renowmed and famous Courtezaune named Theodora a woman of great bragges, and boasting much what shée coulde do vnto princes before Socrates saying that shée coulde make any to come from Socrates vnto hir, and that Socrates coulde not make anye of hir men to come vnto him.
It is no meruaile sayde Socrates to drawe men to vice is most easie: and to drawe them vnto vertue is most hearde.

The chast life of Lucrecia and noble temperancy of Sophronia two noble Matrones of Rome, the rauished to requite the tyrannie of the Emperour Torquinius by whome she was deflowred, after that shée made hir husbande priuie that his bedde was defiled by Torquin slue hir selfe with hir owne knife: the other in lyke sort bycause she coulde not resist the violence of Decius to make Decius more odious, his déede more shamefull, ended hir life as Lucrecia did.
Euen so Medullina being oppressed by hir father in the darcke, got his ring from his finger to knowe him in the morning, who had so villaine lyke deowred hir virginitie in the night: which when she knewe by the ring, that it was hir owne father, she spared not to reuenge hir temperauncie with the death of hir father: and for that shée little estéemed hir owne life, hir honestye being stained, with that knife that shée slue hir father, shée also kylled her selfe, as a witnesse of her owne trueth, and proofe of hir honest lyfe.
This hath made Rome famous, how well was temperauncie regarded in Rome when Virginius slue his daughter Virginia for that she was deflowred of Appius Claudius so greatly was it estéemed, so highly honoured, and so straitly lookt vnto, that Sempronius slue Gallius that Ceruius gelded Pontus the Romane, both being taken in adulterie.
Howe happie and renowmed was Rome when Sulpicia Patercul{us} daughter, and wife to Fuluius flaccus the lampe of Rome, and lanterne of the worlde, preferred for his temperauncie, by the verdite of Sibilla to excell all Asia and Europe
The like temperauncie prooued by Cibeles the mother of all the Gods to be in Claudia that heauen and earth extolled the name of Rome, was not then temperance honoured, when Uirgines and young women bought temperauncie with death? some killing themselues, some burning, some drowning, and thus by death their liues were knowne.
Hippo, a woman of Gréece, sayth Valerius, that trauailing vnto Rhodes on the seas, perceyuing the Mariners to be gréedie and readie to spoyle hir honestie, vnderstanding that they went about to defile hir temperate and chast minde, to auoyde their purpose and filthie lust, leapt from boorde vnto the surging seas, whose terror she lesse feared to die, then shée was willing to liue, as a woman stayned and corrupted· what way findeth not modesty of life to requite shame? Howe escapeth dishonestye and lust of ill life from the snares and baites of temperaunce? Timoclea, a woman of Thebes being violated by a certaine Prince of Thracia against hir will, requited this prince, and eased hir molested minde after this sort sayth Sabellicus she went in an euening vnto this Thracian Prince, and tolde him priuily, if hée woulde followe Timoclea shée shoulde bring him where such store of substaunce such wealth is hidde~, as would make him the richest Prince in all Asia to whome he gréedily consented, went willing and gladly, thinking to spéede of one thing, he found an other thing, and being brought vnto a déepe well, she sayde: In this well sayde Timocla, is infinite treasure, which when he stoupt to looke vnto the bottome of the Well, shée threw him in headlong, and a mightie huge stoane she roulde after him.
Atalanta the mirrour of all Ladies, a seconde Diana refusing the companie of men, liuing in wildernesse, abstayning from wordlye pleasure, and ending hir life in pure virginnitie in the desartes of Arcadia
Sith may better beginne, and soner ende, with aledging kingdomes and countries for a proofe of temperaunce, folly it were in so large a scope, in so ample a matter, to deale with perticuler histories· therefore to beginne with women, of Teutonica where temperauncie so much estéemed was, so well thought on, that hearing theyr husbandes to be slaine and taken Captiues by a valyaunt Romane, then Capitane for Rome, named Marius they came knéeling before him, be sought him courteously and humblye sith theyr husbandes were slaine, as women willing to leade a lyfe, that they might go and serue the Vestall Uirgins in Rome, to auoyde the gréedinesse of Marius souldiers and there to ende the rest of their liues in seruice of Vesta but being denied of Marius cleane contrarie vnto a Romane hearte, and to a noble Gentleman: the next night folowing, the women of Teutonica hanged themselues, least they might be a praye vnto the Romane souldiours, to bée defiled by vnchaste dealing.
The like did the fiftie Uirgins of Sparta going a pilgrimage to Messena and being set for their Uirginities certaine hookes and baites of purpose by the Gentlemen of Messena and nowe ready as they were appointed euery one of them being then maydes, to be made women that night, they all preuented it with death, rather to lose life honestly, then to liue shamefullye, knowing what a reproche and infamie it woulde be vnto Sparta and to all the countrie of Lacedemonia if that they estéemed life more than honestie: killed themselues béeing Uirgins to honour their countrie, and to defame Messena
Hence procéeded terrible and long warres betwixt the Lacedemonias and Messenians to the last confusion, and vtter destruction of the countrie of Messaena: and this warres continued tenne long yeares, that of pleasure so shorte, the Messaenians, felt so gréeuous paine.
Wée reade of a passing good history of Alexander and king Amintas sonne, brother to king Philip of Macedonia, which when he perceyued the Embassadours Persea to waxe wanton with his sisters, and desirous to doe villannie vnto the King his father, promised the Embassadours that they shoulde accomplish their luste and pleasure with fayrer Uirgins then those were, which the Persean Embassadours would meddle with· they being gladde of the promise, expecting the time, their comming, being then in their beds redy for them, Alexander to note such vilanye, and to open the same vnto others, caused certaine young men to array themselues like women, and suche a night to go vnto the Perseans as though they shoulde séeme to be women, and to bring eyther of them a knife priuilye: who being in bedde, they were commaunded by Alexander to kill the Embassadours, and his company.
Megapirus, when hée that his Embassadours were slaine in Macedonia, waxed madde a long time, and readye to rayse warres, vntil he had vnderstanding of the cause order of their deathes: for Alexanders temperauncie therin he maried Amintas daughter Alexanders sister: this is the sacrifice that the Priestes of Isis did vse to abstaine from fleshe and wine: this is the temperaunce that Numa Pompilius shewed most often in Rome, from women and wine to abstaine.
This abstinence vsed Sara the daughter of Raguel to doe hir feates: this vsed Iudith, to haue Holofernus heade off: And this vsed Quéene Esther to king Ahasuerus
Worthy examples we reade of Kinges sometime, that being most thirsty, refused to drinke, as Alexander the great, before he fell amongst the Perseans to dronkennes, was so temperate that hauing a cuppe of water brought vnto him in hys extréeme thirst, woulde not drinke the same in the sight of his souldiours, least the sight thereof should augment the thirst of his souldiours, being most thirstie already.
Cato Iunior, leading a great host of souldiours ouer the whot sandes of Lybia, hauing no drinke nor water nigh them, waxed so thirstie, that when one of his souldiers brought him in his headpéece a draught of water by chaunce, hée woulde not drinke him selfe and leaue his souldiours thirstie, but threw the water downe vpon the grounde, bicause he might impart their thyrst with abstinence, which was such ease vnto the souldiours, to sée his temperaunce one waye, and his humanitie another way, that they felt theyr thirst much thereby aswaged.
King Dauid being besieged by the Palastines was desirous to drinke of the water called Bethlehem some stout souldiours of his named Eleazarus, Iesebes, Semera, ventured life for the kinges sake through the enimies, which when the water came, Dauid dranke it not, as one that coulde abstaine from that he liked best: but bicause it was brought with greate perill, he offered that water as a sacrifice vnto God, for the thrée souldiours that ventured their liues for it.
great vertue to abstaine from that which a man liketh best: and great temperaunce there is in abstaining, Romulus being bidden to supper to a Citizen of Rome, dranke no Wine all supper time, but two or thrée droppes after supper, vnto whome the hoast spake merely.
Romulus sayde he, if all men woulde drinke no more than you, Wine woulde be nothing estéemed: to whome Romulus aunswered soberly, and sayde: Wine woulde bée more precious déere if euery man woulde drinke as did, for dranke as much as woulde: and if all woulde doe so, Wine woulde be skant.
Noting his temperauncie in a little, and the gluttony of the most part in drinking.
Hanniball, Scipio, Mithridates, Fabriti{us}, Semproni{us}, Papiri{us} had no lesse praise for their temperancie in abstayning from offred pleasure, than fame for their victories and triumphes.
Of Taciturnitie and Silence, and of the vertue and commoditie thereof.
SOcrates a famous Philosopher, and Maister vnto that noble and deuine Plato, was woont to charge his scollers to honour and to embrace these thrée excellent vertues: Silence of tongue, shamefastenesse of countenaunce, and wisedome of heart, places appoynted most fit for such noble vertues.
The wisdome of a foole lyeth in his tongue, which is the key of hys councell: and the tongue of the wise lieth hidden in his heart, for of the abundancie of the heart the tongue will speake: so that silence in tongue is a proofe of wisdome in heart.

Euen so the learned Athenians obserued silence in such estimation, that though Athens was counted the well of wisdome, the flower of Philosophie where all the world came to learne to speake: yet learned they silence in suche sorte, as that worthye Gréeke Themistocles at that time he was banished Athens and enforced to goe into Persea where he was much esteemed, and honorably receyued: and being intreated of the King to shewe the state of his countrie, Themistocles besought the king to graunt him one yere to learne the Persean tongue, and then the king shoulde be certefied in all poyntes that he woulde demaunde of Themistocles
famous Gréeke, though banished from Athens yet obserued hée the lawe of Athens forgot not silence, which was so honoured in Gréece, though hée was in Persea a place sayth Curtius where silence was so magnified, that sharpe punishment was prouided for tongue taulking.
The people of Sparta were noted as men giuen most vnto silence, hating so superfluous wordes, that when the Embassadours of the Abderites as Plutarch maketh mention, had made a long and a tedious oration before King Agis of Sparta, and after much time spent, and many wordes in vaine bestowed (as tongue talkers doe) taking their leaue from Agis willing to haue an answere to theyr King of Abderites: salute your king (sayth Agis from me, and tell him, as long as you spake, so long helde Agis his peace, letting them to vnderstande of theyr much folly in babling.

That Tayler is not expert that maketh Hercules hose to a childes legge, nor that Shoomaker can be good sayth Agisilaus, that frameth Titorus shooe to that little Molons foote: neyther may he be counted wise that speaketh muche to none effect.

Most harde and most difficult, is that silence vnto a young man, that one Messius pined and tormented himselfe thrée yeares as Plini sayth for silence sake.
But Simonides sayd sometime to a still man amongst a number of wisemen: If thou be a foole sayde he, thou doest the part of a wiseman to holde thy peace: but if thou be wise, thou art a foole that thou doest not speake to wise men, and so ende: silence to follye is great wisdome, and silence to wisedome is méere folly.

That noble and renowmed philosopher Zeno at what time he had prepared a banquet in Athens to receyue the Embassadours of Antigonus King of Macedonia where certaine learned Philosophers, and eloquent Orators were present: after many large and subtill disputations, and great ostentation of Rethoricke betwixt them had at supper, Zeno being demaunded of the Embassadours why hée kept silence all that while, aunswered: that to kéepe silence is greater knowledge than to speake, for silence sayde Zeno is most difficult to obtaine, and most harde to kéepe, and therefore most rare founde.
Gentleman in that company then named Agatho hearing Zeno so commending silence, being no lesse desirous to leare silence, then being learned to kéepe it, prepared a great stone, and healde it in the roufe of his mouth thrée yere to auoide ydle wordes superfluous talke, and to learne sober silence, and vertuous taciturnitie.
Alexander the great, when his mother Olimpias did send letters from Macedonia vnto India where then he was at warres, wherein were written muche concerning the state of Macedonia, and great complaynts made on Antipater with diuers more secret councelles sealed, he reading these newes, his friende Hephaestion who knewe all the secretes of Alexander looking and reading the letters with the King vnto the ende, then Alexander toke his signet from his finger after perusing of these letters, ioyned it close vnto Ephaestions mouth, saying: Sith in friendeship you fayle not, in silence breake not.
showe of silence in Alexander honored, but of Princes which honoured silence, Iulius Caesar most estéemed the same: he may iustly chalenge for sobrietie in drinking, and modestie in taulking, the garlande of prayse: Who after long warres with Pompeius the great, sometime his especiall friende, yea, and marièd to Iulia Caesars daughter, being conuicted in Pharsalia and enforced to flee vnto Egypt, his treasures, substaunce, and welth, being brought vnto Caesar in a great cheast, where diuers sealed letters and great councelles Caesar founde, which he neuer opened for silence sake, tooke them all to+gither and threwe them into the fire, for that all men might learne how much hée estéemed silence: this done vnto Pompeius at Pharsalia and the lyke vnto Scipio at Thescus he sayde vnto his souldiours, that it behooued a Prince to finde out friendes, rather than out foes.
The noble Emperour knew well by reading of Pompeius letters he might be mooued to diuers iniuries, by opening of Scipios secrettes, he might accuse diuers wrongfully: therefore he had rather purchase by silence friendes, than by breaking of counsell mooue enmitie.
Howe sure and safe is the rewarde of silence, hystories of Gréeke and Latine can well report.

Therfore Phocion that wise Gréeke, which sugred Demosthenes called the rasor of Athens was alwayes afrayde as Plutarchus sayth, least anye sodaine sillable or foolishe worde might escape his tongue imprudentlye: So that silence gayneth lyfe, and wordes causeth death, as Linus the auncient Musition, at what time with Hercules he founde fault, for that he was Linus scholler and taught him on instrumentes, for wordes speaking of Linus vnto Hercules he was slaine of his owne mayster, so that silence vnto Princes is most
noble silence, rare vertue, most worthy Iuell, thou hurtest no man, thou betrayest no bodye, thou deceyuest no friende.
Phillippides a noble man of Athens which for his singularitie of learning, and dexteritie of witte, King Lisimachus made most account of, most desirous to please him, most readie to aduaunce hym vnto honour, willed him to aske what he would, and he should haue it: Philippides most humbly knéeling vpon his knées, be sought Lisimachus the king in any wise not to open his secretes and councell vnto him: The king demaunded the cause thereof of Philippides bycause sayd hée, know not whether am able to kéepe councell or no.
Howe much it repugneth the nature of man to kéepe silence, Cicero in his booke of Offices doth manifest the same: for were it possible sayth hée, vnto man to ascende vp the skies, to sée the order of the bodies superiours, and to vewe the beawtie of the heauens: vnswéete were the admiration thereof, vnlesse he myght shewe it vnto others.
And againe he sayth: There is no such case vnto men, as to haue a friende to whome a man may speak as vnto himselfe, letting to vnderstand the griefe of silence, and that nature loueth nothing which is solitarie.
It may séeme that silence one waye is not so benificiall, as it is another way most gréeuous, as prooued by the historie of Secundus the Philosopher, who hauing companye with his owne mother in the night time, eyther of them most ignoraunt of the other, his mother in proces of time hauing knowledge therof, for very griefe and sorrowe slue hir selfe.
The Philosopher likewise hauing vnderstanding of his mothers death, knowing the cause thereof, knewe not what to doe for that he was ashamed of the filthie act one waye, and most sorrowfull for the sodaine death of his mother another waye: to dye, to hange, to burne, to drowne, him selfe he though it to short a torment for so heynous a fact, knowing his mother being a woman, stayed not nor feared not to kill hir selfe to ease hir sorrowfull heart: but he being a Philosopher, stoode him vppon to finde out the painefullest torment in all the worlde, to plague him iustly for his grieuous offence: he vowed vnto God neuer to speake one worde during lyfe, such plague or torment hée thought was most odious and painefull vnto nature, and thus by silence to consume life.
Sith silence is such a burning disease, so heauy in the heart of man, so harde to kéepe in, so daungerous to vtter out, how worthy of commendacions, how merite they the fame prayse, that can rule theyr tongues and kéepe silence? Therfore a noble Senator in Rome sometime, brought his eldest sonne named Papirius vnto the Senate house, to heare the councell pleading, the sage Senators determining lawes, charging him what euer hée shoulde heare in the house amongst the wise Senators, to kéepe it in silence: for the order was in Rome, that the young men should saye nothing vnlesse he were a Consull, a Tribune, a Censor, or such lyke office, whereby hée might speake.
This young Papirius on a time being sore set on of his mother, and charged him of her blessing to tell the cause and businesse that the Senators had so often to come togither: Thus the younge man being threatened, waying his fathers charge to auoyde wordes one way, and his mothers displeasure to kéepe silence another waye, sayde: Sith you are so importunate Mother, to knowe the secret of the Senate, you must kéepe councell, for am charged therewith.

Howe frayle and weake is youth? How many Cities are perished by young councell? Howe much hurt from time to time haue young men deuised, practised, and brought to passe?

saye a hundred and seuen yeres, was altogither adicted to his bookes, to his studie.
So of Zeno, Pithagoras, and Democritus might be spoken, men of no lesse wit, trauaile, and exercise, than of time and age: For as Cicero sayth, the gouernement and rule of common wealthes, consisteth not in strength of bodye, but in the vertue of the minde, wayghtie and graue matters, are not gouerned with lightnesse of the bodie, with swiftnesse of the foote, with externall qualities, but with authoritie, councell, and knowledge: for in the one saith he there is rashnesse and wilfulnesse, in the other grauitie, and prudence.

What may be spoken of Fabritius, Curius, and Coruncanus, aged men of great agilitie, of famous memorie, in their last dayes? Howe might Appius Claudius be forgotten, who being both olde and blinde, resisted the Senatours to compounde with king Pirrhus for peace, though they and all the Consulles of Rome, herevnto were much enclined? If shoulde passe from Rome, a place where age was much estéemed vnto Athens, amongst the sage Philosophers? if from Athens to Lacedemonia, where age altogither bare swaye and rule? if from thence, vnto the Aethiopians, and indians, where all their lines are ruled and gouerned by olde men? if from thence, vnto any part of the worlde, shoulde trauile, might be long occupied in reciting the honour and estimation of age.

This thought for better credite and greater proofe of olde age, to drawe out of the olde testame~t, that other prophane autorities might be beléeued: as Tithonius whom the Poetes faine that he was so oulde that he desired to become a Grashopper: But bicause age hath no pleasure in the worlde, frequenteth no banquets, abhorreth lust, loueth no wantonnes, which sayth Plato is the only bayte that deceyue young men: so much the happier age is, that age doth loath that in tyme, which young men neyther with knowledge, with wit, nor yet with councell can auoyde.

Maxim{us} that hée bare one lesson from Tarentu~ vnto the youth of Rome, where Architas the Tarentine saide, that nature bestowed nothing vpon man so hurtfull vnto him selfe, so dangerous vnto his countrie, as luste or pleasure: For when C. Fabritius was sent as an Embassador from Rome vnto Pirrh{us} king of Epire being then the Gouerner of the citie Tarentum, a certaine man named Cineas, a Thessalia~ borne, being in disputation with Fabritius about pleasure, saying that he heard a Philosopher of Athens affirming that all which we doe is to be referred vnto pleasure, which when M. Curius, and Titus Coruncanus hearde, they desired Cineas to perswade the King Pirrhus, in that to yéelde vnto pleasure, and make the Samnits beléeue that pleasure ought to be estéemed, whereby they knew (if that King Pirrhus or the Samnites, being then great enimies vnto the Romanes) were adicted vnto lust or pleasure, that then soone they myght be subdued and destroyed.
For that nothing hindereth magnanimitie, or resisteth vertuous enterprises, so much as pleasure, as in the treatise of pleasure it shall at large more appeare.
Why then how happie is olde age, to dispise and contemne that which youth by no meanes can auoyde, yea, to loath and abhor that which is most hurtfull vnto it selfe: For Cecellius contemned Caesar, with all his force, saying vnto the Emperour, that two thinges made him nothing to estéeme the power of the Emperour: Age and witte.
Castritius wayed nothing at al the threatning of C. Carbo being then Consull at Rome, which though hée sayd, hée had many friendes at commaundement, yet Castritius aunswered and sayde: that he had likewise many yeres which his friendes, might not feare.

The Pygmeians being sore troubled and molested with Cranes, doe ride on Rammes and Goates backes, with their bowes and arrowes, a whole bande, in the spring time towardes the sea banckes to breake their Egges, to destroy their neastes, and to fight with the cranes, euery thirde moneth they take this iourney in hand, else woulde the Cranes destroye them, for that they are little dwarfes, of a long· Their houses are made of dirt feathers, most like vnto birds neasts, so that they are somewhat more and bigger.
knowe not vnto what purpose doe recite these countries, sith the more write, the more haue to write.
What shoulde recite the people, that eate the flesh of Lions, and Panthers, called Agriophagi or recite those that eate Lice in Scithia called Budini Or them that eate Serpentes, called Ophiophagi or those that féede on mens bodies, called Anthropophagi yea, of those that eate their owne parentes, as the Caspians did.
Unto what purpose should name a nacion in India without mouthes, which onely lyue with the ayre that commeth vnto their where they receyue breath: they can neyther nor drinke as Plini sayth in his seuenth booke, thei liue the longer with the swéete smell and odours of flowers? Unto what ende likewise should speake of those blind Andabates that fight without eyes? or of those great eared people that Fanesij whose eares shadowed and couered their whole body? or of the Monopods which in like maner shadow their whole bodie with one foote? or of Arimaspi people in Scithia hauing but one eie in the middest of their forehead, like the great Ciclope Poliphen{us} which Vlisses destroyed? Yea, of millians more, whose deformitie to depaint, whose ouglinesse to write, were to much a charge vnto the writer, and to much tediousnesse vnto the reader.
might speake of people in some part of India which liue two hundred yeres and more, whose heare vpon their heades in their young age is white, and in their olde age blacke, called Pandorae
might likewise recite a people in Libia whose horses may not be guided nor gouerned with bridles, bée the bittes neuer so strong: but with roddes most gently are they tamed, be the roddes neuer so simple.
Herodotus a famous Gréeke writer, is not ashamed to shewe how the women Selenetidae brought foorth egges, whence men were borne, of such heigth, length and stature, that am partelye abashed to aleadge his authoritie therein.
Againe, the people called Sorbotae of Aethiope are spoken to be eight Cubittes long.
To speake of the Troglodites which liue in caues of the grounde, féeding of Serpentes, people of woonderfull swiftnesse, which out runne any horse in Aethiope which cannot speake but hisse: To speake of Massagettes of the people Nasomones will according vnto promise omitt the proilixity thereof, touching all countries by the way, or some of the chiefe, as Egypt which bragges and vaunts of their antiquitie.
The Aethiopians and the people of Caria, with simplicitie and slauerye.
The Sycilian warye and trustye: so the cruelnesse of the Caspians: the filthinesse of the Lesbians the dronkennesse of the Scythians the fornication of the Corinthians the rudenesse of the Boetians the ignoraunce of the Symmerians the beastlinesse of the Sybarites the hardinesse of ye Lacedemonians the delicacie of the Athenia~s and ye pride glory of the Romanes.
Thus we reade that the Spaniards be the greatest trauellers, the greatest despisers: The Italian prowde and desirous to reuenge: The Frenchman pollitike and rashe: The Germain a warriour: The Saxon a dissembler: The Sweuian a light talkatiue person: The Brytaine a busie bodie: The Cimbrian sedicious and horrible: The Boemian vngentle, and desirous of newes: The Vandall a mutable wrangler: The Bauarian a flouter and a scoffer.
Thus much are incident vnto the aforesayd nations by nature: But bicause in this place it were somewhat vnto the purpose, to delare the glorie and state of which of al the world we estéemed feared: And for that Rome had more enimies, than all the whole worlde beside, to shewe briefely how they florished, how theyr fame spreade, and their glorie grew, thinke it expedient, not medling with the antiquitie thereof in the time of Ianus and Cameses but touching their fame by doing of wars, in the time of Romulus which being begotten of Mars of Rhea a Uestall Uirgin, was the first builder of that Citie, also King thereof.
This king Romulus warred on the Sabins after he had elected a hundred Senatours, to discerne and iudge causes of the Citie, to defende Iustice, and practise the same, and to punish vice wronges, according to the law of Plato who willed euery common welth to be gouerned with reward vnto the vertuous, and punishement vnto the vicious.
Againe, he appoynted certaine souldiers, vnto the number of one M. to be in a redinesse alwaies to defend the Citie.
After Romulus succéeded Numa Pompilius the seconde King, a man very religious and pitifull: hée in his time made lawes to obserue rites, sacrifices, and ceremonies, to worship their gods: He made Bishops and Priestes, he appointed the Uestal Uirgines, and all that belong thervnto.
Thirdly came Tullius Hostilius to bée king in Rome, whose felicitie was onely to teache the youth of Rome the discipline of warfare, stirred them woonderfully to exercise and practise the same.
Martius with the like industry and care for the further and surer state of the City, in raising the hie walles of Rome, in a Bridge vpon the riuer Tiber in amending and beautifiyng all the stréetes in Rome.
The fift King was Torquinius Priscus which though hée was a straunger borne of Corinth, yet hée encreased the pollicy of the Romanes with the wit of Gréece, hée triumphed ouer the people of Tusk and enlarged the fame of Rome much more then it was.
To this came next Seruius Tullius which was the sixt, and Torquinius superbus the seuenth and last King of Rome, who for his misgouernment and lust in the Citie against the chaste matrones, for the pride and infringement of the libertie, hauing withall rauished Lucrecia Collatinus wife, was at length after long rule and gouernment, banished Rome.
The first alteration and chaunge of state was then after these seauen Kinges gouerned Rome, two hundred yeres and a halfe, which was the first infancie of Rome.
Then Collatin{us} and Brutus after these kings were exiled, a iust reuengement of their libertie and honest life, were the first Consuls in Rome: they say, altering the gouernment of the Citie, from a Monarchy vnto a kinde of gouernment called Aristocratia which continued in Rome from the time of Brutus and Collatinus vntyll the time of Appius Claudius and Quintus Fuluius which was two hundred yeres.
In this season, during this two hundred yeres was Rome most assailed of all kinde of enimies, stirred vnto wars of all nations, for the space of two hundred yeres and a halfe.
Then Appius Claudius forgetting the law that he him selfe made in Rome against fornication, forgetting the rauishment of Lucrecia and the banishment of Torquinius for breaking of the same, against all right and reason willyngly and wilfully rauished Virginia the daughter of Virginius which after that hir owne father slue hir in the open sight of Rome, the cause being knowen vnto all the Citie, the power of Virginius and the populer state which alwayes had the gouernment of Rome vnder them, with straight in armes to reuenge the wronges and iniuries against lawes committed, and to defende likewise the lawes.
Euen as the Kinges before named were exiled and banished Rome for the rauishment of Lucretia so now the tenne Commissioners called Decemviri were likewise excluded and reiected for the rauishement of Virginia
IN diuers learned Histories wée reade, and specially in Plini of the woonders of waters, and of the secrete and vnknowen nature of fire: which for the rare sight therof, and for that it doth degenerate from things knowen, therein are noted thinges to bée marueyled at, as certen water in the countrey of Campania where if any mankinde wyll enter therein, it is written that he shall incontinent bée reft of his sences.
And if any womankinde happen to go vnto that water, she shall alwayes afterwarde bée barren.
In the same countrey of Campania there is a lake called Auernus where all fléeing Fowles of the ayre that flée ouer that lake fall presentlye therein and die.
Well there is in Caria called Salmacis whose water if any man drinke therof, he becommeth chaste, and neuer desireth the company of a woman.
The riuer Maeander doth bréede such a kinde of stone, that being put cloase vnto a mans heart, it doth straight make him mad.
There are two ryuers in Boetia the one named Melas whose water causeth staight any beast that drinketh therof, if it be white, to alter colour vnto blacke: the other Cephisus whiche doth change the black beast vnto a white beast by drinking of the water.
Againe, there is in India a standing water, where nothing may swimme, beast, birde, man, or any liuing creature else drowneth: this water is called Silia In Affrica on the contrary part, there is the water named Apustidamus where nothing, bée it neuer so heauy or vnapt to swimme that drowneth, but all kinde of thinges doth swimme: leade or any heauy mettall doth swimme in that lake, as it is in the Well of Phinitia in Sicilia
Infinite waters shoulde recite if in this woulde be tedious, in repeating their names, whose strange natures, whose secrete and hidden operation, whose force and vertue were such as healed diuers diseases: as in the Isle of Auaria there was a water that healed the collicke and the stone.
By Rome there was also a water called Albula that healed gréene woundes.
In Sicilia the riuer called Cydnus was a present remedy vnto any swelling of the legges.
Not farre from Neapolis there was a Well whose water healed any sicknesses of the eyes The lake Amphion taketh all and sores from the body of any man.
What shoulde declare the natures of the foure famous floods that issue out of Paradice: the one named Euphrates whom the Babylonians and Mesopotamians haue iust occasion to commende.
The seconde is called Ganges which the Indians haue great cause to praise.
The thirde called Nilus which the countrey of Egypt can best speake of.
And the fourth is called Tigris which the Assyrians haue most commodity by.
Here might be long occupied if shoulde orderly but touch the natures of all waters.
The alteration of the Seas, and the woonders that therof appeare, as ebbing and flowing, as saltenesse swéetenesse, and all things incident by nature vnto the Seas: which were it not that men sée it dayly, practiseth the same hourelye, and marke thinges therein continuallye, more woonders woulde appeare by the seas, then skant reason might be aleaged for, sauing that God (as the Prophet sayth) is woonderfull in all his workes.
The fiue golden Riuers, which learned and auncient writers affirme that the sandes thereof are all glistering gemmes of golde, as Tagus in Ispaigne, Hermus in Lydia, Pactolus in Asia, Idaspes in India and Arimaspus in Scythia these say are no lesse famous through their golden Sandes which their weltering waues bring vnto lande in these foresayde countreys, then Permessus in Boetia where the Muses long were honoured, or Simois in Phrygia where Venus was conceyued by Anchises
To coequat the number of these fiue last and pleasaunt riuers, there are fiue as ougly and painfull, as Styx in Arcadia whose property is to kil any that will touch it, and therfore founde of the Poets to be consecrated vnto Pluto for there is nothing so harde but this water wyll consume, so colde is the water thereof.
Againe, the riuer of Phlegeton is contrary vnto this, for the one is not so colde, but the other is as and therfore called Phlegeton which is in English fiery or smoky, for the Poets faine likewise that it burneth out in flashing flames of fire.
Lethes and Acheron two riuers, the one in Affrica the other in Epire the one called the riuer of forgetfulnesse, the other the riuer of sadnesse.
The fift called Cocytus a place where mourning neuer ceaseth.
These fiue riuers for their horror and terrour that procéeded from them, for the straunge and woonderous effectes therof, are called infernall lakes, consecrated and attributed vnto King Pluto which Virgil at large describeth.
Diuers welles for the straungenesse of the waters, and for the pleasauntnesse thereof, were sacrificed vnto the gods, as Cissusa a Well where the nources of Bacchus vsed to wash him, and therfore consecrated vnto Bacchus so Melas vnto Pallas, Aganippe vnto the Muses so foorth, not molesting the reader further with natures of water, but briefely meane to touch the straunge nature of the earth.
Plini affirmeth that there was neuer man sicke in Locris nor in Croton neyther any earthquake euer hearde in Licia after an earthquake they had fourtie fayre dayes.
By Rome in the fieldes called Gabiensis a certaine plotte of ground, almost two hundred akers would tremble and quake as men rode vpon him.
There are two hilles of straunge natures by the floudde called Indus the nature of the one is to drawe any yron vnto it: insomuch, as Plini saith, that if nailes be in any shooes, the ground of that place draweth the sole of.
There is a piece of grounde in the Citie Characena in the countrey of Taurica where if anye come wounded, hée shall bée straight healed: And if any enter vnto diuers places, as in a place called Hirpinis where the temple of Mephis is builded, or in Asia by Iheropolis they shall incontinently die.
Againe there are places by the vertue of grounde, in that place, that men may prophesie.
Diuers where we reade that one péece of grounde deuoured another, as the hill Ciborus, and the Citie harde by called Curites were choked vp of the earth.
Phaegium a great mountaine in Aethiopia and Sipilis a hie hill in Magnesia with the Cities named Tantalis and Galanis
There is a great rocke by the Citie Harpasa in Asia which may be moued easie with one finger, and yet if any man put all his strength therevnto, it will not stirre.
To speake of mount Aetna in Sicilia: of Lypara in Aeolia: of Chimaera in Lycia: of Vesbius and Aenocauma fiue fierie mountaines, which daye and night bourne so terrible, that the flame therof neuer reasteth.
If anye man will sée more of these merueylous and woonderous effectes of Elementes, let him reade the seconde booke of Plini where he shall haue aboundance of the like examples.
There he shall sée that in some places it neuer rayned, as in Paphos vpon the temple of Venus In Nea a towne in Phrigia vpon the Temple of Minerua and in diuers places else, which is the nature of the grounde.
In Aethiopia certaine fieldes about mount Hesperius shine all night like stars, as for earthquakes and woonders that thereby happened, will not speake, for that it is forced of matter: but of those strange groundes that neuer alter from such effectes afore mentioned, beside the mettalles, the stones, the hearbes, the trées, and all other thinges, are so miraculous and straunge, that Plini in diuers places doth speake of.
And as for fire, it is to great a woonder that the whole worlde is not burned thereby, sith the Sunne, the Starres, the Elementarie fire, excell all miracles, in kéeping the same from damage, and hurt vnto manne, if God had not preuented: yea, appoynted that the heate of the Sunne should not kindle strawes, stubbles, trées and such like, which the heate thereof (as we dayly sée) burneth stones, leade, and the moste hardest substaunce out: sith speciallye that fire is in all places, and is able to kindle all thinges, insomuch, that the water Thrasimenos burneth out in flames, which is vnnaturall and straunge, that fire kindleth in water: And likewise in Egnatia, a Cittie of Salentine there is a stone which if any woode touche, it will kindle fire: In the Well called Nympheus there is a stone likewise, whence flames of fire from the stone it selfe burneth the water.
greater woonder it is, that the fire should be kindled by water, and extinguished by winde.
Fire flashed about the heade of Seruius Tullius being then a boye in sléepe, which did prognosticate that hée shoulde be a king of the Romanes.
Fire shined about the head of L. Marcius in Spaine, when he encouraged his souldiours to reuenge manfullye the deathes of those noble and famous Romanes, named Sipians
The meruellous effectes of fire, are most woonderous and most straungest.
Of the worlde, and of the soule of man, with diuers and sundrie opinions of the Philosophers about the same.
AMongst diuers Philosophers and learned men, grewe a great controuersie of the beginning of the worlde: some of the best affirming that it had no beginning, nor can haue ende, as Aristotle and and Plato applying incorruption, and perpetuall reuolution to the same.
Some with Epicurus thought the world shoulde be consumed: Of this opinion was Empedocles and Heraclitus
Some of the other side did iudge with Pithagoras that so much of the worlde shoulde be destroyed as was of his owne nature.
Thus helde they seuerall opinions, concerning the making, the beginning, the ending, and the numbers of the worlde.
Thales sayde there was but one worlde, agréeing with Empedocles.
Democritus affirmeth infinite worldes, and so iudged Metrodorus the Philosopher, worldes to be innumerable.
What child is of this age but smileth at their folly, reasoning largly one against another, in applying the cause and the effect of thinges vnto their owne inuentions.
And as they haue iudged diuersly of the worlde, concerning the frame and nature thereof: so were they as farre from the true vnderstanding of the creation of man.
Some iudged that it had a beginning by the superiour bodyes: And for the antiquity of mankind, some iudge Egypt to be the first people, some Scythia some Thracia some this countrey, and some that countrey, with such phantasticall inuentions, as may well appeare vnto the most ignoraunt an errour.
And alas howe simple are they in finding out the substaunce of the soule, what it shoulde bée, where it shoulde be, and by what it shoulde bée, some say that there is no soule, but a naturall moouing, as Crates the Theban some iudge the soule to bée nothing else but fire or heate, betwéene the vndeuidible partes.
Others thought it an ayre receyued into the mouth, tempered in the heart, boyled in the lights, and dispersed through the body.
Empedocles is of opinion that it is hote blood about the heart: so that they varye in sundry opinions, attributing the cause thereof eyther to the fire, or else vnto water, eyther vnto the earth, or vnto the ayre, and some vnto the complexion of the foure Elementes: others of earth and fire: others of water and fire: Some againe reason that the substaunce of the soule is of fire, and of the ayre.
And thus of approued Philosophers, they shewe themselues simple innocentes: How ignoraunt were they in defining the soule of man? so far disagréeing one with an other, that Zenocrates thinketh againe the soule to be but a number that mooues it selfe, which all the Egyptians sometime consented vnto.
Aristotle himselfe the Prince of all Philosophers, and his maister Plato shewed in this their shifting reason, which both agrée that the soule is a substaunce which mooueth it selfe.
Some so rude and so farre from perfection in this poynt, that they thought the heart to bée the soule: some the braine.
Howe ridiculous and foolishe séemeth their assertion vnto this age concerning the soule, and as childishly they dispute reason againe about the placing of the same, where and in what place of the bodie the soule resteth: For Democritus iudgeth the heade to be his seat: Parmenides in the breast: Herophilus in the ventricles of the braine: Strato doth thinke that the soule was in the space betwéene the eie browe: yea, some were so foolishe, to iudge it to be the eare, as Zerxes king of Persea did: Epicurus in all the breast: Diogines supposed it to be in a hollowe vaine of the heart: Empedocles in the bloode: Plato, Aristotle and other that were of the best and truest philosophers, iudged the soule to be indifferent in all partes of the bodye: Some supposed of the wisest, that euery péece and parcell of the bodie hadde his proper soule.
In this againe they were much in séeking a proper seate for the soule deceyued, euen as before they erred shamefully, and lied manifesty about the essence and substaunce of the soule: so now were they most simplye beguiled in placing the soule, as you haue hearde.
And now after haue opened their seuerall opinions concerning what the soule is, and where the soule is, you shall here likewise heare, whither the soule shall go after death, according vnto the Philosophers, which as diuersly vary and disagrée in this, as you before hearde their diuersitie of opinions concerning the substance, the place.
And first to begin with Democrit{us} who iudgeth ye soule to be mor+tall, that it shall perish with the body: to this agrée Epicur{us} Plini.
Pythagoras iudged that the soule is immortall, and when the body dieth, it fléeth vnto his kinde.
Aristotle is in this, that some partes of the soule which haue corporall seates must dye with the body, but that the vnderstanding of the soule which is no instrument of the body, is perpetuall.
The people called Drynda were of this iudgement, that soules should not discende vnto Hell, but shoulde passe vnto another worlde, as the Philosophers called Essei which suppose that the soules of the dead do liue in great felicity beyonde the Ocean Seas.
The Egyptians, auntient people, iudged with Pythagoras that the soules of men shoulde passe from one place vnto another, and then to enter vnto another man againe.
The Stoicks are of that opinion that the soule forsaketh the body in such sort, that the soule which is diseased in this life, and aduaunced by so vertuous death together with the body, but they iudge it if it bée adurned with noble and heroicall vertues, that it bée accompanied with euerlasting natures.
Diuers of the Pagans holde that the soule is immortal, but yet they suppose that reasonable soules enter into vnreasonable bodyes, as into Plantes or Trées for a certen space.
There were againe some friuolous Philosophers as Euripides and Archelaus which say that men first grew out of the earth in maner of Hearbes, lyke vnto the fables of Poets, which faine that men grew of the sowen téeth of Serpentes.
Some againe very childishly affirme that there bée nine degrées of punishment, or rather nine Mansions in Hell appointed and prepared for the soule.
The first seate is appointed for young Infantes: The seconde for idiotes and fooles (I feare that place wyll bée well filled:) The thirde for them that kyll them selues: The fourth for them that bée tormented with loue: The fift for those that were founde gyltie before Iudges: The sixt appointed for strong men and champions: The seuenth is a place where the soules bee purged: The eight seate is where the soules beyng purged do rest.
And to ioyne these Legendes of lyes of olde women with friuolous figmentes of Poets, which likewise affirme the like folly of fiery Phlegeton of frostye Cocytus of the water of Stygia of the flood Lethes and of Acheronta with other such, when all Paganicall rites, and fonde foolishe obseruations first grewe, meane of fables of the Poets, and not by the reading of the holy Scriptures.
blinde baiardes, in séeking that which they coulde neuer finde so.
And as they coulde prooue and say that the body came out of the earth, the moysture out of the water, breath of man by the ayre, and the heate of man by the fire: so coulde they not know the worker thereof, how wit and wisedome came from God, how all things was made by him of nothing.
This knew they not, not that they wanted learnyng, but that they wanted grace.
They could appoint planets in their seuerall places, in their due seates and iust Mansions, as Iupiter in the liuer, Saturne in the splene, Mars in blood, Sol in the heart, the Moone in the stomacke, and Venus in the reynes: but they coulde not agrée in appointing a place for the soule.
They coulde likewise appoint seates for the bodies superiour in man, as the Ramme in the head, the Bull in the necke, and the Crab in the heart, the Lion in the breast, and the fishe in the foote, and so of others: but they coulde in no wise find a seate for the soule.
True is it saide, that God reuealeth wisedome vnto babes, and hideth the same vnto the sages of the worlde· Hence groweth the beginning of all heresies according vnto the prouerb: The greatest Philosophers, the greatest Heretickes: Hereby say grewe almost the inuention of Philosophie, coequall vnto the veritie of the gospell, from the which Paule the Apostle crieth vpon all men to take héede of flattering Philosophers.
If in this place shoulde shewe their opinions concerning our God and Creatour, should séeme tedious: For Diagoras and Theodorus affirme that there is no God.
Epicurus iudged that there is a God, but that he had no care ouer earthly things.
Thales sayd that God was a minde which made all things of water.
Alcineon iudged the Sunne, the Moone, and the stars to be onely God.
Parmenides maketh God to be a continuall circle of light, which is called Stephanen.
Anaxagoras supposeth God to be an infinite minde, mooueable by it selfe, so doth Pythagoras likewise iudge: Yea, Aristotle imagined God to be of proper nature, as the worlde, or the heate of the Heauens, or the diuinitie of the minde, which eyther of these three he nameth God, and so infinite are they, that so simply conceaue the maiesty of Godhead, that farre wiser had they séemd vnto vs by silence therin, then by vttering of suche fonde phantasticall opinions, where too much errour and folly are vnto all men euident.
NVma Pompilius the seconde king of Rome, being studious to drawe the ignoraunt and rude people to some profession of religion, was the first that appointed sacrifices vnto Iupiter and vnto Mars
In Rome euen hée elected vnto Vesta and appointed certen orders in choosing of the same.
None by the lawe of Numa might bée taken vnder olde, and none aboue terme to bée a Vestal virgin, which virgines should bée thirty religious, and vowed vnto Vesta of the which yeres, the first tenne yeres· they shoulde learne the order and fashion of the sacrifices and religion of the goddesse Vesta
The seconde tenne yeres they shoulde sacrifice and employ the ceremonies with rites and belonging vnto Vesta The thirde tenne yeres they shoulde as graue Matrones, learne the others chosen, to bée perfect in the rites ceremonies of Vesta Then if any of them woulde marry, they might after thirty yeres continuaunce so do.
If any of these Vestal virgines were conuicted of whordome, the law was· in open sight of the City of Rome she shoulde bée brought vnto the gate called Collina and there aliue be burned.
Againe, if the fire at any time in the Temple had gone out by any meanes, their kepers with scurges shoulde whip and scurge them almost vnto death.
The same Numa to make the people more religious, appointed twelue men called Salij with painted garmentes, singing verses in the praise commendations of God Mars with solempne dauncing and playing rounde about the City.
Amongst other sacred orders, hée made certen Priestes called Feciales these punished offendours: these reuenged the wronges of Legates: these redressed all iniuries offered and committed within the City of Rome: these Priestes appointed rites and ceremonies, made sacrifices vnto the goddesse Bona Dea in a Temple erected vnto their goddesse vppon mount Auentine: here might no men come to do sacrifice, but all women.
Of this goddesse Bona Dea doth Cicero make oft mention in diuers of his orations and inuectiuos made against diuers pernicious and wicked of the City, as Cutelin, Clodius and others.
There was in Rome another kinde of religion dedicated vnto Flora the sacrifice whereof was called Floralia
This Flora as both Liuius and Dionisius do report, was a common strumpet, which for that she made the whole citie of Rome her being wealthy at her death, she was therefore thought to bée of the Romanes, the goddesse of fruites, and was honoured of all the lewde women in braue garlandes, decked with all of flowres, in gorgeous apparell; and this was done in the moneth of May.
The goddesse Ceres began then to bée famous, for she had hir and sacrifices named Cerealia by the Priestes appointed, she was thus honored, the Priestes in white garments, and with lanternes and firebrands in the night time woulde come vnto the Temple, they abstayned from Wine, and auoyded venery for a certen time, they had appointed euery fift yere a great fasting.
Minerua likewise began to haue such honour in Rome, that she had thrée seueral kindes of sacrifices, one of a Bull, the seconde of a Crane, the thirde of a Weather.
The Romanes did celebrate in the beginning of the spring, such feastes and sacrifices vnto Berecynthia called the mother of the goddesse, that euery man did offer of the chiefest thing that hée did possesse to pleasure their goddesse.
There were diuers other kindes of sacrifices, and vaine supersticious ceremonies obserued then in Rome, whose beginninges procéeded from the inuention of deuyls, which of long time were honoured as gods: for then men sought no helpe but of their gods, which were rather deuyls as Polidorus in his fourth booke affirmeth of a certen rich man in Rome which had thrée of his sonnes sore sicke of the plague, this man was named Valesius who euerye night at whome in his house, besought his housholde goddes called Penates to saue his children, to plague him for the fault of his sonnes.
Thus euery night praying vnto his goddes for the health of his children, a voyce was hearde, that if hée woulde go with his thrée sonnes vnto Tarentum and wash his sonnes with the water which was consecrated vnto Pluto and Proserpina they should recouer their health.
Valesius thought the way was farre, yet for health vnto his children, hée tooke his iourney, and being redy shipt in Martius fielde harde by the riuer Tyber he was desired of the maister of the ship, to go vnto the next Uillage called Tarentum for a litle fire, for the fire was out in the ship, the Mariners about other things: when Valesi{us} hard the name of Tarentum hée knewe straight that it was that place that his goddes appointed him to go to, for the Cittie of Tarentum was in the furthest part of all Italy, in the countrey of Calabria hée willyngly went and brought both fire with him for the Maister of the ship, and water for the children, which being geuen vnto his sonnes, they recouered health.
Wherefore, in memory of this, hée recompensed his Goddes with this sacrifice: Hee in the night appointed solempne playes to honour Pluto Proserpina ech seueral nights euery yere for so many sonnes hée had that recouered health, erecting vp alters, and offeryng sacrifices in honour and solempnitie of Pluto
These oracles and diuine aunsweres which the diuyls were to geue in idols to deceaue men withall: These say were they that blinded and allured the people to idolatrie.
Priestes of Rome, the Bishops, for that the sacrifices and feastes, ceremonies and rites, belonging vnto new made Goddes, grewe to suche a number that they appoynted thrée men called Triumviri to be rulers of the sacrifices, and appoynted other thrée that shoulde kéepe the sacred Oracles of Sibilla
The Oracles of Sibilla were written in bookes, where they resorted oftentimes for councell and fiftéene men appoynted to knowe what was to be done in any perill or necessitie, as at the warres betwéene Caesar and Pompeius
Suche prodigious sightes were séene, such vnnaturall working of the heauens, such terrible sightes on the earth, such portentuous miracles then séene in Rome, that the Senatours came vnto Sibilla to knowe the effectes· and endes of these monstrous showes, and to be instructed of the state of the Citie, vnto whome she gaue sixe letters in writinges, thrée R. and thrée F. to be expounded of their wisemen, which when the meaning was founde, that thrée R. was this, Regnum Romae Ruet: and thrée F. was Flamma, Ferro· Fame that is as much to say, that the monarch of Rome shoulde perish with fire, sworde, and hunger.
Dionisius in his fourth booke sayth, that an aged woman brought nine bookes vnto Torquinius Superbus being the seauenth and last King of the Romanes, which she woulde haue solde for thrée hundred Crownes to the King, letting Torquinius vnderstande that those bookes were full of oracles and deuine aunsweres, but hée making a iest of hir bookes, did burne thrée of them before hir face, demaunding of hir againe what he should paye for the other sixe, shée aunswered: thrée hundred Crownes, then he burned other thrée, and asked what he should pay for the thrée bookes that were left, shée aunswered as before thrée hundred Crownes: the King marueyling much at the constancie of the woman, bought the thrée bookes for thrée hundred crowns, and after that time that woman was neuer séene in Rome, wherfore it is thought of the Romanes that she was Sibilla
Therfore these thrée bookes were obserued in Rome as aforesayd vnder the custody of .iij. men appoynted for the purpose, and shée so honored worshipped, that sacrifice vpon sacrifice was offred vnto Sibilla in Rome.
Thus the Oracles of Sibilla in Rome: The Oracles of Apollo in Delphos The Oracles of Iupiter in Ammon were the instructors to the Gentiles, and teachers of the Gréekes.

Thus wandering in this vale of miserie like pilgrimes farre from the countrie that we ought to trauaile vnto, where that true and liuing God, the God of saluation and health which is without ende to be worshipped: Hée is the God of all men, and yet of the fewest worshipped: he is the sauiour, and yet he is neglected: yea, and more reiected of vs that be Christians, then the blockes and stones were honored of the Gentiles.
And for the proofe meane to shewe the seuere lawes that were both in Athens and Rome, the two lanterns of the worlde, for obseruing of their Gods religion, whome neyther Philosophers in Athens nor Senators in Rome nor ye magistrates Princes of the worlde then would in no wise permitte iniuries towards Gods, suffer any euill report toward their religion, in such care were they lest they shoulde offende their Goddes and breake their lawes, certen husbandmen founde in the landes of L. Petilius by plowing therein, two stones, wherevpon an Epitaph of Numa Pompilius was written in one, in the other there founde they fourtéene bookes: seuen latine bookes, entituled Ius pontificum the law of bishops concernyng religion and sacrifices of their goddesse: bookes with great diligence and care were not only commaunded to be kept, but also in all pointes to bée obserued.
The other were Gréeke bookes, entituled Disciplina sapientiae the rule of wisedome, which for that they tasted of Philosophye, and contempned the vaine superstitious religions of their goddesse· Petilius fearing lest by reading of wisedome and Philosophie their folly and religion shoulde bee destroyed, being then praetor in Rome, at what time Cornelius and Bebius were Consuls by aucthority of the Senate in open sight of all the citie of Rome burned the Gréeke bookes, for the olde and auncient men woulde haue nothing kept within their citie that might hinder their Goddes, for before all thinges, their goddes and their religions they preferred, and so honoured their Priestes their sacrifices and their vestall Uirgines before the Emperours and Senatours, as it appeareth by a History in Valerius that when Rome was taken and conquered first by the Frenchmen, and the vestal Uirgines enforced euery one burthened with sacred things belonging vnto the goddes Uesta, to beare those thinges away, shifting more for the sacrifices and rites of their religion, in carying their bookes, their garmentes, their goddes, and their thinges belonging therevnto, they cared for their countreys, friendes, children, and gooddes: Insomuch that L. Aluanius when he sawe the Uestall Uirgins taking paines to maintaine the honour of Vesta vndefiled, her sacrifices vnpoluted, in sauing the ceremonies and religion of their Goddes the enimies, as one that had more regarde and respect to their vaine religion, then carefull of his wife and children, whiche then being in a Chariot to be caried and conueyed from Rome, commaunded by Aluanius to come downe from the Chariot, and go a foote, where he placed where his wife was and his children, the Uestal Uirgins with all their burthens belonging vnto Uesta, their sacrifices and other necessaries, and brought honorablye vnto the countrie of Créete where with great honor thei were receaued, and for memory hereof vntil this time the people of Créete for that they did succour the vestal Uirgines in aduersity, Vesta the goddesse recompensed them no lesse for their humanity in receauing of her maydes vnto their towne, then she gratified Aluanius for his consideration waying of her religion: In so much, that the coches where her Uirgines and her sacrifices were caryed, was afterwarde more honoured and estéemed, than any triumphant or imperiall chariot.
In the selfe same time and perturbation of Rome, when the Capitoll was besieged with the enemies Caius Fabius perceauing how religion was then estéemed, girded himselfe like a sacrificer, caryed in hande an host to bée offered vnto Iupiter was suffered to passe through the middest of his enemies to mount Quirinal where solempnities and sacrifices were done vnto Iupiter and being accomplished, he likewise went vnto the Capitol through the middest of the armie with all his company, and by this meanes got the victory ouer his enimies, more by religion then by strength.

The Romanes made lawes at the distructio~ of Canna for that great slaughter of Romans which at that warre happened, that the matrones of Rome bewayled and lamented the deathes of their husbandes, their children, their brethren, and friendes incessantly, that they shoulde not passe thirtie dayes in mourning, least the Goddes woulde be angrye, ascribing all fortunes good and badde vnto their Goddes.
Wherefore it was decréede by the Senatours, that the Mothers and Wiues, the sisters and the daughters of them that were slaine at Canna at the thirty dayes ende, shoulde cast awaye theyr mourning apparelles, and banishe their teares, and come altogither in white garments to doe sacrifice vnto the Goddesse Ceres for it was thought and trulye beléeued among the Gentiles and Heathens, that the Goddes woulde iustly reuenge those that woulde at any time neglect their sacrifices and religions.
Apollo for that stout Brennus went to Delphos and spoiled his temple, and neglected his godhead, was plagued gréeuously, and worthyly reuenged: euen as king Zerxes whose Nauyes couered the whole Seas, whose armies of men dryed vp riuerrs, shadowed almost the whole earth, for that he sent foure thousande souldiours vnto Delphos to robbe Apollo hée was therefore discomfited in his warres, forsaken of his souldiours, prosecuted of his enemies, and compelled to flée like a vagabonde from hyll to hyll, vntyll hée came vnto his kingdome of Persea vnto his great infamie and shame.
The like in Carthge when the Cittie was oppressed by the Romanes, his Temple neglected, and hee him selfe not estéemed.

Minoes king of Créete, was woont euery ninth yere to go vnto a secrete place by him selfe, and there a long time staying to consult with Iupiter what law hée shoulde make vnto the people of Créete, as hée enformed the people, deceaued them craftily.

The originall beginning of ydolatie, as learned writers affirme, that the prince of this worlde, which is the Diuell exercising his Art, practising his diuinations, shifting such sundry shewes, that such errors were poured in mens heartes, for that prodigious actes and miracles, which diuelles, and men by diuelles wrought were seene, that men were blinded with the shiftes of Satan, which as Saint Paule sayd could chaunge him selfe like an Aungel of light, that some by sorcery, some by coniuring, some by this craft, and some by that diuell, which goeth about like a roaring Lion to encrease his kingdome, became goddes on earth: some againe for strength, some for building of Cities, some for inuentions of thinges, were hadde and counted in the number of Goddes: as Isis amongst the Egyptians, Gabyrus amongst the Macedonians, Mithra amongst the Perseans Euen so with the Rhodians and Massagetes was the Sunne honoured, amongst the Latines Faunus with the Romanes Quirinus with the Babylonians Belus with the Sabines Sabius with the Moores Vranios and so Iupiter in Créete, Apollo in Delphos as beforesayde.

Of the first beginning of shauing, and of the vse thereof, vvith much making of the heares of the heade.
THE Lacedemonians were woont to excell all other nacions in letting their heares of their heades and beards to growe, as an ornament and a comly setting foorth of man.
Wherfore Licurgus did defende the same, saying that as the heares of the heade were comelye and séemelye vnto beawtifull men: so were they a terrour and a fearefull sight vpon the deformed man for the enimies to looke vnto.
Nicander therefore being demaunded why did the Lacedemonians and the people of Sparta estéeme their beards and hearie lockes of heares vpon their heads: he sayde, Bycause it is a most naturall garment, and most comelye vnto man, to haue that which is best in sight, and least in charges.

The Gréekes honored their long heares, and so estéemed theyr beardes, that Homer was woont to call them Carecomoontas that is to say: fayre heared.
It shoulde séeme that the Macedonians made to much of their heares and beardes, for at what time Alexander the greate, had gathered all his power and force to take his conquest in hand, being demaunded of his souldiers whether in them were anye thing to be amended, the wise prince considering the great hurt and inconuenience that shoulde happen chiefly in warres vnto those that were long heared or long bearded: And againe being loth to offende his souldiours, for that he knew well that they much estéemed their beardes, hée smiling merily spake, sée no want in you nor no vntowardenes: but wishe your beardes and long heares were at home vntill your returne.
They meruayling muche at his request, Parmenio aunswered and sayde: that the Macedonians woot not what you meane thereby: then Alexander perceyuing that his souldiours were angrie for his desire and wishe, sayde, bicause long hears is daungerous, and specially amongst the enimies, no better holde then by beardes or heares, but it that they had rather to be conquered like men in theyr beards, then to be conqerers like boies without beards.
As for the Romanes heares delighted them so much that there was no shauing séene, no Barbers knowne, vntil Pu. Ticinius brought certaine Barbers out of Sicilia vnto Rome, which for the space of foure hundred and foure and fifty yeres, Rome nourished their long heares before, as that which they best delighted in for the time.
Affricanus was the first that euer delighted in Barbers, and next vnto him was Augustus Caesar successer of Iulius Caesar, besides these countries and famous kingdomes, diuers others were that so made of their héeres, that to obserue orders, to auoyde daungers of warres, they did shaue diuers partes of their heades much against their will: yet for custome sake Maxies people in Aphrica doe vse to shaue the right side and to let the heares growe vpon the left side.

It séemed that eyther Barbers were skant, or not known in those dayes, or else heares much set by, and estéemed of all men: for Suetonius that writ the liues of Emperours doth report that the Emperour Caligula was woont for enuie to those he met, to shaue their heares of behinde, knowing wel that nothing might molest them so much, as to haue their heares of: for he was so enuious, that if he sawe anye that had fayre golden heares, hée woulde haue it of streight with his owne handes.

Occasions were ministed vnto them sayde they by their long heares, and beardes, to knowe them selues and the state of their body: for of an olde man in the citie of Sparta being asked why he ware his bearde so long, hée aunswered that in behoulding the graye heares in my bearde, maye doe nothing vnséemely nor vnworthy of such graye heares, for a good man is alwayes prickt with stinges to lyue verteously.

The like dyd Ieronimus surnamed Rhetus make of his bearde, for when sée sayd hée my beard, than know right well that am a man, and not a woman: and then knowing my selfe to bée a man, am ashamed to doe any thing lyke a woman, eyther in word or déede: Much more might bée héere alleaged, for the actorities of beardes, and for estéeming of long heares, for there is no country be it euer so ciuyll, but it is addicted vnto some peculiar qualities, neither is there any man be hée euer so wise, but doth glory in one thing more then in another: as the wise man in his wisedome, the learned man in his knowledge, the ignoraunt man in his folly, the proude man in his person, the selfe louer in some place more than in other, either in his face, body, legge, middle, foote: yea, in hande and héere, and specially many do make much account of their beards, kembing, decking, handlyng and settyng it in order alwayes: But bicause people are mutable full of chaunge, and that time altereth all things, we wyll no further procéede in this, though menne maye misiudge of others concerning their long héeres and beardes: yet say iudgement is not safe in this poynt, for it may bée that they preferre the rustye rude countrey Poet Hesiodus, before the warlike and eloquent Homer as Panis king of Calcides or as Midas did iudge Pan the Piper before Apollo the god of Musicke.
Harde it is to iudge of men, whether the bearded man, or the beardlesse man is to be preferred, the long heare or the short heare to bée estéemed: for vnder straunge habite lurcke hidden qualities, for vnder a ragged cloake (as the Gréeke prouerbe is) lyeth wisedome secretely, as vnder a Ueluet Gowne.
Of diuers kindes and sundry fashions of buriall amongst the Gentiles.
THE aunciente Egyptians waying the shortnes of mans life, litle estéeming the time, doth prouide such sepulchrées against they die, that they account their graues an euerlasting habitation.

Of the beginning of Mariages, and the sundry vse of the same.
AFter that God had made the worlde in full perfection, and so beautiful that the Gréekes did call it Cosmos which is, faire, framing all things for the vse of man, aswell the world, as also all that mooue or growe in the worlde: hée then made a woman whiche shoulde be likewise a further solace vnto man.
And where he made the worlde, and all liuyng creatures beside in seuerall and sundry proportions, yet hée framed man like him selfe to beholde the heauens, to measure the elementes, and to rule the very Globes, and to this ende hée might multiplye the worlde, saying vnto Adam after hée blessed all thinges on earth: Go and multiplie.
This multiplication and the vse thereof was so diuers, that diuers countreys had sundry orders, aswell in single life, as in matrimonie.
And as concerning antiquitie of mariage, wée reade in Trogus that noble Historian, that Cecrops the first King of Athens before the time of Deucalion to haue first framed appointed Matrimonie in Gréece: But such was their orders in diuers places, such was their libertie in Matrimonie, that the Egyptians the Indians and the Thracians might marry as many as they woulde, according vnto the abilitie of the man: some tenne, some twelue, some more, some lesse.
Againe, the Scithians the Perseans and all Barbarie there marriages and wiues were common one for another like brute beastes.
The Massagetes had this law, that it was not to be suffered that any of their countrey should marry but one wife, but it was lawfull for any man to take another mans wife, and to make an exchange, for so were their wiues common vnto all, but marryed vnto one.
In Libia the people called Augylas and the people called Nasamones had this order in their Matrimonies, that ye Bride the first night after she was marryed, shoulde lie with euery ghest before she shoulde go to bed with her owne husbande.
The Arabians lawe was, that one women was marryed vnto all her kinsmen, and at all times lawfull for any of her kinne to chalenge and claime her as his wife, vsing this policie, to leaue a staffe at the chamber doore to geue to vnderstande that one was in bed with her: And when the staffe was not there, then they knew that no body was within: in so much if any were founde of another kinrede, it was adulterie, and by law hée shoulde dye. Polidor reciteth a historye for the purpose to bée noted, that there was a Kinges daughter of great beautie, which had fiftéene tall men vnto her brethren, with whom seuerally often times she did accompay, and beyng almost weryed, desirous to take some rest, for she was so faire, and they were so many that alwayes she had company: she vsed this policie, to make a staffe much like vnto the chamber staffe, which was as it were a Porter appointed.
And vpon a time after that one of her brethren had left her in the chaumber, and was gone out, she straight layed the staffe at the doore, thinkyng thereby somewhat to ease her selfe, and to rest from venery: but one of her came from the market, where hée left the rest of his brethren together, and when hée sawe the staffe at the doore, went straight vnto his father, and accused his sister of adulterie, saying that all his brethren were in the market, and that there was a fornicator with his sister: but the matter being knowne, hée was punished of his father for that hée slaundered his

Herodot in his fourth booke doth make mention of certen inhabitants called Poeni approching the confines of Egypt, whose order and lawe of matrimonie was, that the King of that countrie should haue the first taste of the Bride before hir husbande: this order was once obserued of the auncient Scottes, that the Lorde of the soyle shoulde haue the virginitie of the maried woman.

And thus sundrie orders and seuerall lawes in maintayning the same.

Moyses perceyuing the Iewes muche to bée gyuen vnto extreame seuerall vices, some vnto couetousnesse some vnto lechery, that for reformation of domesticall quietnesse, for that the Iewes were so desirous of other women eyther for beawtie or for wealth, their owne they punished and plagued vnto death, they had a diuorcement of Moyses to mitigat the furye and hardnesse of their harts rather to auoyde the tyranny of the Iewes which they vsed towards their wyues by sufferaunce then by commaundement.
For as the world in most places was too wicked concernyng the libertie of Matrimonie: so were they in diuers countreys very straite concerning mariages, in so much the Ethnikes obserued that sentence of Catullus the Poet, that virginitie ought to bée ruled by the parentes, sith one part is the father, the seconde is the mother, and the thirde and last is in the childe.
The solemnitie in matrimonie in diuers places imported vnto vs wise morals, and did as it were presage a duetie and an obedience vnto things, as both Plutarch and Plini write of the Venetians that when a mariage was solemnized in Venice the Bride after that day bringeth her distaffe and her spindle, and Flaxe redie, as one after that day neuer to bée idle, but occupied alwayes in the affaires of her house.
The Gréekes and the Romanes also had this custome, they girded the loynes of their daughters alwaies vntil the day of their maryages, and then that night her husbande shoulde loose the knot, and vnbinde that which of long time the Uirgines of Gréece kept fast bonde.
Amongst diuers countreys, where sundry solemnities in matrimonie is vsed, reade not in any historye so solemne a state, and so worthy ceremonies as wée do sée in Englande, which if you marke in all pointes, you must néedes confesse that outwarde ceremonies do import a great Maiestie and dignitie of Matrimonie.
Againe, they had lawes in diuers places that none should mary without some reuerence shewed vnto their gods before: as the Athenians suffered no maryage without sacrifice first done vnto Diana

In Sparta by the law of Licurgus the maydes that shoulde mary, shoulde shaue the héeres of their heades, and weare mans apparell: and by the same law they were forbidden to geue any substaunce with their daughters, but that loue and good wyl should be the whole cause of mariage.
Moreouer, they vsed these ceremonies, to deuide a péece of bread in Macedonia and in the most part of Greece for the Bride and Bridegrome to eate before they shoulde bée maryed.
The like in Rome in Romulus time was vsed, so that they had water more to their bread then the Gréekes had.
In Galatia they shoulde drinke first of one Cuppe appointed for that purpose only, and so foorth in diuers countreys they vsed diuers ceremonies, as in Carmenia no man might mary without he brought the head of some enemie or other to the King, as a proofe of his loue toward his countrey.
In Maeotis no mayde might mary without she had subuerted one enimie or other of her countrey: but in some countrey they maried not, as Esseni people much geuen to abstaine aswell from Wine as from women.
Wherfore Socrates being demaunded what was best, to mary or no, aunswered: To mary you shall suffer brawling and chiding, to bée single you shall be solitary and comfortlesse.
Therefore Pompei{us} the great comming amo~g the Massagets who vsed once a wéeke to company their wiues, demaunded the cause thereof, they aunswering saide: bicause wée shoulde not heare their chidings in the daye time, nor their complayntes in the night time.
But to ende, lette euery man haue his owne wife, if he cannot liue chaste, for better it is to marry than to burne.
BYcause comparisons are odious amongst diuers men, yet for that Plini and Plutarch doe vse them chiefely for necessaries, shall shewe how like diuers princes were one vnto another, not in countenaunce and outwarde proportion onely, but in life and conuersation: Also by comparing the auncient Gréekes and the latter Romanes one with another, as most certaine the Romanes imitated the Gréekes in all poynts: wée shall sée and perceyue by their actes, doinges, and life, who were most like one vnto an other.
And first begin with Romulus the first king of Rome, how hée in all his dooings imitated that valiaunt Gréeke Theseus King Aegeus sonne of Athens that Plutarch in hys first booke declareth that by comparing their liues one with an other, a man may easilie iudge how like in state and fortune they liued: the one hauing occasion to warre with the Sabins the other with the Centaures the one in augmenting the state of Italy and building of Rome, the other in deliuering all Greece from tirannye and bondage: of equall trauell both, and of like state, for then Italy was in Romulus time, as Gréece was in Theseus dayes.
The next was in Rome Numa Pompilius which for his pittie vnto the poore, his loue towarde his countrie, his grauitie and seueritie in lawe making, his zeale and religion to the seruice of theyr temples: In fine for all vertuous doings in all respects like vnto Licurgus that famous lawe maker amongst the Lacedemonians the care that these two princes had for their friends and countries, cleane contrarie vnto Theseus and Romulus before mentioned.
It is set foorth by Plutarch in his fourth booke.
Licurgus was not so studious to call the Lacedemonians from vice and sin, But Numa was as carefull to instruct the Romanes in all goodnesse and vertue, so that Rome bare witnesse of Numa and Sparta of Licurg{us}, which for their seuerall and sundrie lawes, their vertuous liues and dooings compared by Plutarch they may wel for their contempt and neglecting the honors and dignities due vnto them, and for care they had eyther of them for their people, be like one vnto an other: and euen as Publicola did not onely imitate Solon in all poyntes, but also translated Solons lawes in Rome, so that one was counted most sage and wise in Gréece, the other thought to be most happie in Rome.
So did Numa likewise followe Licurgus in all doings, imitating his lawes and orders in Rome.
What comparison is made betwéene noble Scipio Haniball the one defending the state of Rome, the other Carthage and eyther of them in open warre with the other, that to reade their liues and fortunes about the affayres of their countries, what is it else but to sée two noble Capitaines one like vnto an other in magnanimitie and courage, whose fortune after strong and stout seruice towardes their countries was suche that they both were banished Rome Carthage And as they in life were most like of Plutarch compared, so did they embrace their death likewise.
Euen so was that stoute Gréeke Alcibiades which Thucydedes most worthyly prayseth, and Macoriolan{us} that famous Romane compared for the like magnanimity and state of fortune.
Pericles that renowmed Gréeke, and Fabius Maximus the Romane, whose doings Athens Rome did long rule, were likewise noted one to be like an other.
Plutarch in his booke intituled the liues of Emperours, compareth Silla the Romane vnto Lysander king of Sparta compareth Sertorius vnto Eumenes and likewise Pompeius the great, vnto Agesilaus king likewise of Lacedemonia
If respect be duely had vnto the marshall feates and noble actes of Gréekes and Romanes? If their liues, honours, and dignities be waied? If on the contrarie, mishappe, euill fortune, banishement, and such like be considered, we must thinke and iudge truely of Plutarch in comparing these iolly champions and puissant Princes as Alexander the great and Iulius Caesar Demetrius and Antonius, Nicias and Crassus men in all theyr doings in all enterprises most lyke one vnto another, some for wisedome againe and eloquence compared as Cicero vnto Demosthenes some for iustice and equitie likened one vnto the other, as Cato the senior likened vnto Aristides the Athinian For gentlenesse and clemencie was Pelopidas King of Sparta compared vnto Epamino~das Prince of Thebes Some againe compared one vnto an other for their liberalitie and franke giuing, as that famous and liberall Phocion was iudged to be like vnto that frée and franke Athinian Cimon some likened by misfortune and chaunces, as Dion who gouerned Sicilia a long time in fauour and great honour with Dionisius then to Brutus which likewise might co~maund Caesar to pages missing] long therein occupied, with small pleasure and dilectation vnto the reader: and therfore thinke it better to obserue measure in things, then with prolixitie of writing or tedious examples to molest the reader: for when it was tolde Caesar Augustus that there was a young man of Sicilia that was very like vnto the Emperour in countenaunce and person, hée commaunded the young man to bée brought before him, where when hée came, the Emperour demaunded meryly whether his mother had euer béene at Rome, the young man aunswered and sayd: My mother was neuer at Rome, but my father was oftentimes at Rome: and so the Emperour was cut of with the like equiuocation vnto him, as vnto the young man hée meant, geuing to vnderstande that the young mans father might bée as bolde with the Emperours mother, as he thought hée shoulde with the young mans mother.
GReat controuersie there is for the antiquitie of Musicke, some doe attribute it vnto Orpheus as the Thracians which with Horace affirme that the Musicke of Orpheus coulde mooue stones, rockes, and trées: some vnto Amphion as the Thebans doe, which honour Amphion for the first musition, for that with his Harpe hée caused stones trées to follow him, wherwith hée builded the towne of Thebes some vnto Dionisius as the Gréeks which saye that he first inuented harmonie: Solinus affirmeth that Musicke was first founde in Créete: Polibius saith that Musick was found first in Arcadia: Diodorus thinketh that Apollo found first harmony: Iosephus iudgeth that Tubal amongest the Hebrues was the finder first of Musicke: And thus auntient writers diuersly do vary herein.
But sith Musick is but a sounde within number and measure as Cicero saith, and that by diuers meanes founde of men, and from time to time augmented by man: for first when Mercury the sonne of Maia had founde after that the floode Nilus had watered all Egypt, amongst diuers other drowned creatures, a sea Snayle, the flesh being withered, yet the synewes still remayned, which being striken, made a sounde: Thus did Mercury make first a Harpe with seuen strings to coequat the number of Atlantides and then he added two more and made them nine, iust with the number of the Muses.
Thus was the first Harpe made by Apollo though some say it was made by Orpheus some by Amphion some by Lirus yet it is most like that Apollo made it for in Delos the picture or simulacre of Apollo is there set vp, hauing in hys right hande a bowe, and in his left hand the thrée Graces, and eyther of them hauing in their handes seuerall kinde of instrumentes, the first a Harpe, the seconde a Pype, the thirde a Flute.
In the chap. of the inuention of things you shall at large finde more concerning Musicke.
But now to declare the harmonie of Musicke, the mirth and melodie that procéedeth from musicke, the loue and affection that auncient Princes and graue wisemen bare vnto Musicke, that Themistocles though hée was wise and discréete in other thinges, yet for that as Cicero sayth in his first booke of Tusculan in that hée refused to heare one playe vpon the Harpe in a banquet where hée was, hée then of the wisest men in Athens was though and iudged to bée of learning lesse than they supposed him to bée: For the Gréekes iudged none to be learned, vnlesse he were séene in musike.
Socrates page duplicate] page duplicate] the father of all Philosophie, and Mayster of all Philosophers, béeing by Oracle of Apollo named and iudged the wisest man in all the worlde, became in hys latter yeres an olde man to be taught to play vpon the Harpe, and often founde amongst little children which being taunted of Alcibiades for that he found him playing with a litte infant called Lamproce aunswered: it is good being to be in good company.
Euen so that wise and discreéete prince Agesilaus king sometime of the Lacedemonians spiyng one of his men to laugh at him for that hée rode vpon a long réede with one of his children, sayde: holde thy peace and laugh not, and when so euer thou wilt be a father, thou must doe as a father.
Wée reade the like of noble Architas the Tarentine which when he was maried, hauing a great number of seruauntes in his house, hée woulde playe with their children, and delighted much in the company of young infantes.
Certainely eyther of these thrée last mentioned Socrates, Agesilaus or Architas were in those dayes most renowmed for their wisedome and knowledge, and yet refused they not the company of young infants.
That mightie and strong Hercules though hee was the sonne of Iupiter and counted in all the worlde most famous, rather a God taken than a man, as Euripides doth testifie, woulde be often founde amongst children and young innocent infantes playing, saying this sentence with a childe in his hande: play with children which for the chaunge thereof is so gratefull vnto mée, as though were in the games of Olimpia
The self same famous Hercules went to schole vnto Liuius to learne to play vpon the Harpe to solace him in his sadnesse, and to make him mery when he was compelled to mourne.
In the middest of his triumph went that great conquerer Alexander likewise to learne musicke.
That deuine and godly Prophet Dauid played vpon his Harpe and serued his God with mery songues and godly ballades.
It is written that in the mariage of king Cadmus the sonne of Agenor which builded Thebes in Boetia the Muses played on instrumentes.
In Gréece musicke was so estéemed that their sages and wise Philosophers addicted themselues wholy to musicke.
The Arcadians the Lacedemonians and the Thracians people, though they were much giuen to warres, seuere in dealing, hardie in all trauayles, and in learning most rude: yet woulde they acquaint themselues with musicke vntill they were thirtie yeres olde.
The people of Créete brought vp their youth in all kinde of melodye and harmony.
The most part of the worlde dyd learne musicke saue in Egypt, as Diodorus in his second booke affirmeth, that musicke was forbidden, least the tender and soft mindes of their youth shoulde bée intised to too much pleasure.
And though some contemne musicke with Diogines and saye that it were more profitable to mende maners than to learne musicke: And some that will with Alcibiades taunt musicke, who was woont to say that the Thebans were méete men to learne musicke, for that they coulde not speake, but that the Athenians should hate such wanton tunes, for that thei spake without instrument.
Likewise King Pirrhus being demaunded which was the best musition, Python or Charisius he despising them and their musicke, preferred a great warrior according to his owne mind named Polysperches
Though these say with diuers others despised musicke sometime, yet wée reade againe as wise as they, as stout as they vsed much musick, as Achilles, Alexander the great, Nero, Silla, M. Cato, Socrates, Cimon
To many might repeate that were as wise as they were merie, as learned Ioppas whose songues in Virgill are expressed: as Salij whose pleasaunt pamphletes Rome a long while embraced and much estéemed.
For as musicke is dolefull, pleasaunt, full of harmony and melodie: so is musick terrible and fearefull, full of life and courage.
For wée reade in the olde age while yet the worlde was rawe, that Aliates King of Lidia· in his warres against the Milesios hadde musitions for his Trumpetters, Pipers and Fidlers, as Herodot{us} in his first booke affirmeth, to mooue the people with musicke vnto warres.
The people of Créete as Gellius writeth, had Gitternes and Cithrones playing before them, as they went vnto the fielde to fight.
The Parthians vsed as Plutarchus in the life of Crassus reporteth, the ringing of belles at theyr going vnto field.
The Ethiopians vsed songes of diuers tunes, and dauncing before they went to warres.
The Sirians before they mette their enimies woulde sing Balades to honour the same, with all kind of dauncing to solace them selues.
The Cimbrians did make melodye with drie skinnes, beating the skinnes with stickes at the very entraunce vnto the enimies, Cirus the great King dyd with his souldiours sing vnto Castor and Pollux before he tooke his voyage to the enimies.
The Athenians woulde sing Hymnes vnto Iupiter before they woulde go to the féelde.
The first noyse and sounde that the Lacedemonians had, as Thucidides saith, in stéede of Tru~pettes were Flutes, vntil by an oracle they were warned of Apollo that if they thought to haue victory euer Messena they should appoynt a man of Athens for their Capitaine: the Athenians being right glad of the oracle, for that the Lacedemonians Athenians were alwayes enimies one vnto another, they sent vnto Athens for a Captaine, where they appointed vnto them a lame and a deformed man named Dircaeus in reproche a mock of the Lacedemonians
This Dircaeus being appointed and made a Capitaine ouer all the people of Sparta he first then inuented the trumpe, and taught all the Lacedemonians to sounde the trumpe, which was such a terror vnto the enemies the people of Messaena that at the first sounde of the trumpets they fledde, and so the Lacedemonians got the victory.
Thus was the auncient musicke in the beginning so necessary, that euery countrey endeuoured to haue skyll in musicke: then Mars claimed musicke in the féelde, nowe Venus occupieth musicke in Chaumbers, that kinde of gentle and softe musicke the Egyptians forbad the youth to bée taught therein, lest from men they woulde become againe women.
But shall wée ioyne the olde auncient games, the mirth, the solace and the playes that they vsed in those dayes, together with their musicke, to prooue the agilitie of that time, and the actiuities of that age to bée much estéemed amo~gst the Gréekes and Gentiles.
The Gréekes at some time had foure great games appointed: the first in mount Olimpia in Arcadia harde by the Citie Pisa which Hercules inuented first to honour Iupiter
This was so famous amonst the Gréekes that euen as the Romanes vsed to accompt the by their Consuls, so did the Gréekes vse to number by the games of Olimpia which was appointed euerye first yere: Unto this game came all the youth of the worlde both on horsebacke and on foote to do maisteries, the reward was appointed for the victors a Garland made of Oliue leaues, for they came not there for money, but for mirth and exercise, in so much that when Tigranes King Artabanus sonne harde of the fame therof, and of the Garlandes of Oliue, hée sayde: Well worthy were the Gréekes to be spoken of, that so litle estéemed money, that Oliue was preferred for the chéefe reward in Olimpia
This same mooued first King Zerxes to warre against the Gréekes to his losse and decaye.
The seconde games were called Pithij and inuented of Apollo in memory that hée killed the great Serpent Python which was of Iuno sent to kyll Latona Apollo his mother: Here was appointed for the victories eyther a foote or a horsebacke, a Garlande made of Oken leaues.
Here likewise all the youth of Gréece exercised feates, practized policies, vsed maisteries, and prooued them selues in any thing that they felt them apt to do: as in running, leaping, wrastling, riding, swimming or such like as then wée vsed.
The thirde was called Isthmia inuented of Theseus in the honour of Neptune
In this play was appointed for ye victors, certen garlands made of Pine leaues hauyng the name of Isthmos a place in Achaia where Neptune is worshipped, where the Temple of Neptune is compassed.
The fourth game is called Nemea which the Argiues make in memory of Hercules for that hée killed a great and a fearce Lion in the woods of Nemea according vnto the name of the play.
Here do likewise the Argiues come to exercise youth, practize feates as the rest do.
These foure playes were long in Gréece obserued, as causes and occasions for men to come together, to shewe feates and to trye qualities.
The first in Olimpus for Iupiter the seconde in Delos for Apollo the thirde in Isthmos a place in Achaia for Neptune the fourth amongst the Argiues to Hercules
In the first play the Garlande of victory was of Oliue, in the seconde play the Garlande of victory was of Oke, in the thirde play they had their Garlandes of Pine, the fourth play of Poply, and thus then they triumphed in their mirth, they bragged of their victories, they gloried in their garlandes, while yet Lawrel as Ouid sayde was not knowen.
Besides these foure famous playes, there were diuers others, as Pirrhus play which hée inuented in Créete, for the souldiours to exercise them selues in armes, wherein hée taught diuers iestures and sundry shiftes in moouings, whence first procéeded much the vse of warres: this was a kinde of dauncyng in armes, as Hali. in his seuenth booke saith, which was of the people called Curetes mainteyned in the memory of Pirrhus.
Licaon likewise inuented other kinde of playes, where naked men contrarye vnto Pirrhus games did vse feates.
Diuers others were had in great estimation in Gréece, made and inuented by seuerall men, but the first inuentour of mirth was as Diodorus saith, Mercurius which onely was inuented to recreate the people, and to practize agilitie and feates of bodyes.
Others there were of lesse name, but of as great mirth, as diuers kindes of playing at the Ball, which is an auncient game, as it seemeth in Vergil it was much vsed sometime amongst the Troyans for when Aeneas incontinent after the destruction of the Cittie of Troye came vnto Italy, where hée first taught skipping and frisking at the Ball, before hée maryed Lauinia King Latinus daughter, the youth of Troy had playing at the Ball for their chéefe mirth and recreation, and at this day much vsed in diuers countreys.
Againe, for further recreation, they vsed sundrye kindes of Dice playes.
Herodotus doth witnesse that the olde and auncient Lidians did first finde out the Dice and Ball, though Plini doth report that one named Pythus first founde the play at the Ball: but for the certainetie thereof, sith so many kinde of Balles bée, and the playing likewise so variable, both Plini and Herodotus may well agrée, for the people of Lydia at a certaine time being oppressed with great dearth, and sore plagued with hunger, they inuented then diuers kindes of diceplay, as Herodotus sayde, to passe the time in playing, and to forget hunger, for they fed one day, they came togither the second daye to playe: thus eating a little one daye to satisfie nature, they played the seconde daye to auoyde hunger.
Againe, there was amongst the ancient Gréekes a play muche like vnto our Cheasse play, which one Zerxes a wiseman first inuented, to warne a tyrannous Prince which he then serued to auoyde his tyranny, to let him vnderstande by his playe, that a Prince ought to watch and to vse his subiectes as his force and strength, euen as the playe is in moouing the Pawnes, the Knightes, the Bishops for the defence and bulwarkes of the king, that as the player, meane Zerxes did shew his maister the King the effect of the play, howe the king was preserued by playing wisely of the men lest they bée lost, so the tiraunt him selfe vnderstoode by the play of Zerxes how daungerous that Prince is that vseth not well his subiects, that will not discréetly sée and watche for their commodities, whiche is the Princes safetie.
Another play was vsed then in Gréece, either vpon the Dice, or els closelye in hande: called euen and odde.
This playe came from Gréece vnto Rome, in the time of Augustus Caesar the seconde Emperour of Rome, as Suetonius doth write in the life of Augustus where the Emperour Augustus wrote a letter vnto his daughter in Rome, after this sort: Daughter sende thée two hundred fiftye pence, which geue amongst thy ghestes to play after Supper the Gréeke play called euen and not euen, whether they will at Dice or cloase in hande.
Lottes likewise were much vsed for recreation and mirth, with diuers other sundry games and playes to recreate the minde of man, which both the Gréekes and Gentiles did practize then, aswell to trye their wittes, as also to vse pastime and mirth to drawe company togither to be mery.
leaue the Gréekes a while, and wyll something speake of the Romane pastimes and sportes, which in nothing were inferiour to the Gréekes, but rather excelled Gréece all the worlde in all qualities.
And lest shoulde séeme tedious, will speake of no more but of foure principall games, correspondent vnto the Gréekes, and coequall vnto their number.
The first called Lupercalia brought out of Arcadia by Euander sacrificed vnto Pan vpon mount Palentine
And as Siluanus doth write, the sacrifices were made in the Moneth of February after this sort, by Euander the first inuentor thereof.
The youngmen of Rome shoulde gather together, euery one bearing in his hande a scurge or a whip made of Goates skinnes, running one vnto another, and hée that was most swift of foote escaped stripes: for euery one should runne vnto another in order, euery one his length before the other: and thus they made them swifter in running by reason of his stripes, for hée that was ouertaken by the way, was sure to spéede: Euery man ranne naked, to this ende, that they might vse to be swift.
The women likewise thinkyng thereby to become more fruitfull and fertill, offered them selues wyllyngly to receaue stripes.
These scurges and whippes that they had in their handes, made such ratling noyse by reason they were made of drie skinnes, that it made him that ran before to straine him selfe, hearing the noyse, and fearing the stripes.
The seconde game that the Romanes vsed, was called Circenses as some say sprong vp first amongst the Romanes them selues, a place appointed by Rome, enuironed about with huge strong walles: Here all kindes of pastime and sportes were vsed, running with Horses and fighting on Horsebacke in the one ende, in the middest the champions were placed in armes a foote to fight, in the other ende wrastlers, leapers, runners and such like games were appointed: so that the place was framed accordingly long and large, that they might haue roome enough in both endes, and in the middest.
This was the chiefe and the auncientest play amongst the Romanes sauyng Saturnalia this sport did Ianus which then did raigne, togither with Saturnus as Macrobius saith, inuent and frame in memory and monumentes of Saturnus his fellowe.
This play was celebrated in the moneth of december with such mirth, pleasure and pastime, that it far surmounted all other.
In this moneth of December euery man saluted his friende with rewardes, tokens, presentes or with anye treasure that they had to pleasure one another.
And because all things were common in Saturnus time, and called the golden worlde, there was such mirth vsed as woulde make some men of this time to sée it.
beléeue none of this age would bée content to sée his seruaunt in bedde with his wife, which in Saturnus time was tollerable.
Some say this play sprong first among the Pelagians some againe affirme that it began amongst the Athenians but how and where it began first in other countreys it is no matter, but in Rome it was first framed and inuented by Ianus
The fourth play amongst the Romanes was then called Gladiatoria where the youth of Rome came to learne how to behaue them selues among the enemies: In this play shoulde they fight one with another at the long Speare, the long Sworde, the staffe, and such as then they vsed in fight for to embolden them selues: in that play being naked without armes against they came to fight with their armed enemies.
Thus by this play were the Romanes taught boldly to fight with their enemies, and hardned at home, litle to estéeme woundes and strokes abrode.
Thus games and playes were chéefely estéemed of the Romanes, though diuers others as Cicero in his office affirmeth, the Romones had in Martius féelde harde by Rome, to exercize the youngmen to practize feates, to become redy and prompt in marshall offayres, which they onely most estéemed.
IF men bée diuers in affection one towardes another, as wée dayly sée and trye by experience: howe much ought the siely and simple beast which wanteth vse of speach to bée commended, that so careth and prouideth for him his.
And though as Cicero saith that it is common vnto all liuing creatures to multiplie and to be carefull ouer those that nature procreated, to differ in no part from a beast therin: yet by reason we are to excell all kinde of beastes, all things in subiection vnto man, aswell the heauens aboue, and all that shineth therin, as earth beneath and all that liue thereon.
And hence maruayle much though thd secrete working of nature, in fearce and raging beastes bée tollerable, yet in a reasonable man, in whom saith the Philosopher nature onely mooueth vnto the beast suche enimitie, variaunce and discorde shoulde procéede.
It is thought that the Eagle and the Swanne be not fréendes, the Dolphin and the Whale can not agrée, the Woolfe and the Foxe at variaunce: so of the Dogge and the Cat, of the Crowe and the Kite may be spoken, but it is well knowen that man is most odious vnto man, and though it be spoken Homo homini Deus yet is it prooued Homo homini Daemon
If nature made the mighty Lion the most valiaunt beast in the worlde to feare the little crowyng Cock? If nature do cause the huge and monstrous Elephant, to tremble at the sight of a sielie simple Shéepe? And if nature mooue the Panther, a strong and a straunge beaste, to quake at the presence of a Hinde? If nature worke so subtilly, that the strongest, mightiest, and valiauntest beast, shoulde feare the most innocent and most simple beast? howe much more might reason rule in vs to feare our God and his mightie workes? which wée altogether either forget his glory, or despise his power.
Though in beasts the heauens haue dominion: yet saide Dauid, man by reason and feare of God ruleth the heauens.
But wyll omit to speake further of that, and wyl returne to that which meane a litle to discusse.
wil not speake of the loue and affection of men generall, but of the loue mutuall betwixt man and wife, betwixt brother and brother.
And as it is a vertue not to be forgotten, so is it a vertue most rare to finde: for euerye thing in his owne kinde is most to bée accepted.
And first to entreate of the excéeding loue, of the woonderful affection that men bare towarde their wiues: Wée reade of that noble Romane Anthonius Pius who loued so well his wife Faustine that when shée died, he caused her picture to be made, and to be set vp before his face in his bed chamber, to ease some part of his gréefe with the sight therof.
M. Plaucius sayling with his wife vnto Asia with thréescore Nauayes came very gorgeously vnto the citie of Tarentum where in the middest of his pompe and great glory, for that his wife Orestella by sicknesse dyed, he slue him selfe with one dagger, saying: Two bodyes shall possesse one graue.
The like wée reade of two young men in Plutarch the one named Aemilius the other Cianippus which for méere affection and passing loue towardes their wiues, after long tormentes, panges and paynes conceyued by inwarde griefes, that their wiues were dead, to solace their sadnes and to ende their woofull hap, offered their pined bodyes a sacrifice vnto death, for a pledge of their true and faithfull loue.
What meanes doth loue séeke to saue it selfe, to auoyde gréefe and lastyng paine, and to bée acquainted with ease and pleasure? to embrace death.
How rufully the Gréeke Poet Antimachus bewayled the death of his wife Lisidides in such mourning verses woofull plaintes, that whosoeuer read them, hée should bée as redy to wéepe in reading the dolefull Epitaph of Lisidides as was Antimachus her husband sorowfull of hir death.
Pericles was so louing vnto his wife, being a noble capitaine of Athens and so chaste, that when Sophocles spied a marueylous beautifull young man, saying: Behold a passing fayre young man.
Pericles aunswered and saide: Not onely the heart and the handes of a Magistrate must bée chaste, but also his eyes must refuse the sight of any but his wife.
It is read that Pericles being at Athens hée was founde kissing and making much of his wife, and being from Athens he was found more sad to depart from his wife, then vnwilling to die for his countrie.
Orpheus loued so well his wife Euridices that as the Poettes faine he feared not the power of King Pluto to redéeme his wife, with hazarde and daunger of his owne bodie.
Innumerable are they that deserue the like fame, so that these fewe maye bée a sufficient proofe of others.
And now a fewe examples to prooue the like good will and loue from the wiues shewed towarde their husbandes, as hithervnto you heard the great loue of husbandes toward their wiues.
Alcestes a noble Quéene of Tessalie at what time King Admetus hir husbande shoulde die, hauing by an Oracle giuen an aunswere, that if any woulde die for the King he should liue: which when all refused, his wyfe Quéene Alcestes offred hir selfe to die to saue hir husbandes life.
Iulia the wife of Pompeius the great, and onely daughter to that famous and renowmed· Iulius Caesar Emperour of Rome, shée was no lesse obedient vnto hir father Caesar then shée was louing vnto hir husbande Pompeius who though they both were enimies one vnto an other, yet shée shewed hir a louing daughter vnto hir father, and a true wife vnto hir husbande: and so true that when shée sawe hir owne Pompeius comming blouddy from the fielde, as his apparell made a shewe a great way of, shée supposing that hir husband was slaine, béeing great wyth childe, trauayled straight and died before Pompeius hadde yet come in.
The loue of Artimesia Quéene of Caria towarde hir husbande king Mausolus is as well declared by the sumptuous Tombe and gorgeous glistering graue which she made for him when hée died, compted for the excelencie therof one of the seauen woonders, as also truelye verified by cerimonies at his death, in making the skull of hys heade hir drinking cuppe, in drinking all the ashes of his bodie as suger vnto hir wine, and in eating of his hart vnto hir body, saying: though bodies be departed yet our hartes shall neuer be a sunder.
That noble Gréeke Laodamia looued hir husbande so well, that when shée hearde that hir husbande Prothesilaus was slaine by Hector at the siege of Troye shée desired onely of God that shée might sée his shadowe or likenesse once before shée died: which when shée sawe embrasing the lykenes of Prothesilaus as shée thought in hir husbandes armes, shée then presently dyed.
We reade that Quene Ipsicratea loued hir husbande king Mythridates so entirely, that shée shaued all the heares of hir heade, and ware mans apparell, and followed him like a Lacky, for that hée shoulde not know hir to be his wife, shée had rather go vnto the wars with hir husbande like a lackie, than tary from hir husbande in Pontus lyke a Quéene.
Paulina when shée hearde that hir husbande Seneca was put to death by that cruell Emperor and Tyraunt Nero whome Seneca sometime taught him in his youth Philosophie, and at the length requited him with death: which when say Paulina harde thereof, she enquired what kinde of death hir husbande suffred, which béeing knowne, shée ministred the like playster vnto hir selfe, as was appoynted for Seneca hir husbande.

What can be so harde to take in hande, but loue will hazarde it? what can be so perillous but loue will venture it? neyther water can stay it, nor fire stop it.
Sulpitia the wife of Lentulus the daughter of that worthy Romane Paterculus when shée perceyued that hir husband was appointed by the Magistrates of Rome to passe vnto Sicilia as an Embassador, and there to continue for a season, though hir mother had great charge ouer hir, very carefull studious she was to comfort hir daughter in the absence of hir husbande: yet she deceyued hir mother, shée chaunged hir apparell caused hir two maides likewise to be disguised toke two men in the like apparell, and went all by night from Rome vnto Sicilia.
Aemilia the wife of Affricanus and mother vnto that noble Cornelia which was mother vnto those famous Romances called Gracchi, shée perceauyng her husbande to bée in loue with one of her maydes in the house, and often to vse the mayde as his wife, though Aemilia knew wel of it, yet she neuer hated the maide, nor opened it to her husbande: but after that her husbande died, she gaue to this maide a great summe of money, and maryed her wealthyly in Rome: rare thing in a woman founde.
To speake of Penelopes loue in Gréece, towardes her husbande Vlisses, or to shewe the constancie of Lucrecia in Rome towarde her husbande Collatinus the one twentie yeres was prooued of diuers noble Gréekes, and yet remayned she true vnto Vlisses the other through force being rauished by proud Torquinius sonne named Arunti{us} would not be false vnto Collatinus but opened the same reuenged it with hir owne death.
Now againe to prooue how well did Quéene Tomiris loue hir sonne Mesgapites the death of great Cirus King of Persea with two hundred thousande of his souldiours beside can testifie: or howe Ageus loued his sonne Theseus which when he hadde perceyued the black sayle, contrary vnto promise made before when Theseus went vnto Créete to the monster Minotaurus that his as he supposed was slaine in Labirinthus he threw him ouer a high rocke into the sea.
What shoulde molest the reader herein, sith an ende can scant be founde, but onelye recite one worthy hystorie out of Valerius of a seruaunt vnto one named Panopion that hearing that certaine souldiours came vnto the City of Reatina in purpose to kill his Mayster, he chaunged apparell with his mayster, and conueyed his Mayster first a waye safe and sounde from the enimies, and he went vnto his Maysters bedde as though he had béene Panopion and suffred himselfe to be slaine in stéede of his Mayster.
man woulde thinke that greater loue coulde be founde in no man, then a man to die for his friende: and truth it is.
But to finde such loue in beastes towardes men, a meruell great it were: Insomuch, that in Leucadia a Peacock loued a young Uirgin so well, that when shée dyed, the Peacock also dyed.
And Plini sayth that in the Citie of Seston an Eagle being brought vppe by a young mayde loued the mayde so well that it woulde flée a broade and kill foules and bring them whome to the young mayde: and when the Uirgine died, the Eagle flewe vnto that same fire where the mayde was appoynted to die, and also died with hir.
The Perseans were woont for fauour and affection they had vnto their Horses, to burye them and the people named Molossi made braue sepulchres for their dogges.

Such tryed loue and faythfull trust was found in Dogges, that the great King Masinissa of Numidia neuer went to bedde but had a dosen dogges in his great chamber, as his garde to kéepe and watch him from his enimies, for sure he was that money might not corrupt them, friendshippe might not alure them, threatnings might not feare them.

The like Examples we reade in Plini of horses, and specially of thrée, the one Alexander the great King of Macedonia hadde: the seconde Iulius Caesar Emperour of Rome hadde: the third Antiochus king of Siria had: These thrée noble Horses suffred no man to ride or touch them, but their owne maisters, and so gentle vnto them, that they kneled to let them mount on their backes.

The Porter hauing shewed vnto his Lady that a poore scholler was at the gate begging some meate for Goddes sake: The Lady sayd he shoulde haue nothing there for his sake: The scholler then desired for our Lordes sake some meate, hée was againe denied: The thirde time hée prayed to haue some meate for his owne sake: The Ladie then commaunded hir Porter to bring the Scholler vnto hir chamber, which when shée perceyued him to be ragged, and not séene of hir before, shée asked him why hée was so boulde to aske meate at hir gate for his owne sake which was not knowne of no man: bycause sayd the scholler you haue denied me for Goddes sake, being the Creator of all thinges, thought to aske for mine owne sake, being the simplest wretch of all men.
Young Uirgin refused to haue a welthie husbande which hir parentes had ordayned hir, being demaunded the cause why shée so young a mayde denieth to leade hir life in mariage, sayd: when am maried, my husbande, and my children will clayme that loue at my hande then, which nowe God onlye hath at my hande, and therefore will not mary.

IT is written in the liues of the fathers, that a young man seruing an Hermet, being sent of his maister vnto a village harde by, where a certen great Usurer and a vicious man being dead, was caryed honorably and buried with solempnitie, with the Bishop of that Diocesse, which when the boy saw, hée wept out that so euyll a man, so wicked an Usurer should haue such solemne buriall: and returning whom, hée founde his maister deuoured of a Lion, which so mooued him almost to bée beside him selfe, saying: The wicked Usurer dieth with greate honour, and is buried with great pompe, that liued all the dayes of his life in sinne and wickednesse.
My maister being fifty yeres in the wildernesse an Hermet, is eaten vp and deuoured of a Lion, whiche studied and traueyled to fight with sinne, and with the deuyll.
An angel appeared vnto the boy, saying: The deuyll can no more hurt thy maister, for hée hath done his worst, and now thy maister hath conquered the deuyll.
The deuyll spared the Usurer in his life time, that hée might possesse him after his death.
SOcrates therefore dying, héeing constrayned for that hée refused their gods (and sayd that hée would rather worship a Dogge than the gods of Athens and to drinke his last draught, perceyuing that his wife wept, demaunded the cause of her wéeping, his wife aunswered and sayd: the innocencie of Socrates death is the cause of my wéeping: Nay rather sayde Socrates laugh and reioyce at that, and wéepe at him that deserued death.
The like examples haue wée of King Antigonus and Anaxagoras the Philosopher, hearing both that their sonnes dyed in the warres, the one sayd, knowe hadde my sonne borne to die: the other without vexation or chaunge of countenaunce, made him be buried out of hand, saying: It is no straunge thing to heare of death, aswell vnto Princes, as vnto poore men happened.
Great King being admonished by his Phisitions of death, began to lament much his state, saying: Alasse Myser that am, howe many princelye Pallaces, regall Courtes: howe manye Kingdomes and countries must depart from? and go vnto those quarters know not where?

SOme hold that opinion, that in the auncient tyme whiles yet the worlde florished not in learnyng, that memorie then was moste sette by and esteamed, for what so euer was seen or heard, was then committed vnto Memorie, and not recorded in bookes, whiche Socrates saied, after the vse of letters were had the vertue of Memorie decaied, for the care whiche then was in harte and memorie; with feare and diligence to obserue, is of all now put in bookes, that now our memorie is put in writyng, and then was it fixed in minde, in so muche that noble Athenian Themistocles passyng by Simonides schoole, who as some suppose taught firste the arte of Memorie, beyng demaunded, whether he would learne the arte and facultie of Memorie answered, that he had rather learne how to forgette thynges, then to keepe thynges in Memorie, for can not, saied he, forgette what would, and haue thynges in Memorie, whiche faine would thei were out of Memorie.
Seneca doeth so report of hymself, that he was of suche perfect Memorie, that he could reherse after one, by hearing twoo hu~dred verses: yea, a greater maruaile of Memorie, he could recite twoo thousande names of men, beyng repeated once before hym, with as good a Memorie, as he that firste named them.
The like we read of Aelius Adrianus a capitain, that hauing a greate armie vnder hym of soldiours, if any were absent in any place about any businesse, he had in Memorie the name of the persone, the name of the place, and the cause of his businesse.
Of this excellent Memorie, to their perpetuall fame was kyng Cirus and Scipio the one a Persian the other a Romain whiche had this fame by Memorie: that either of theim could seuerally call their soldiours by name, euery one after an other, whiche is moste rare, yea, moste maruailous, hauyng so many alwaies vnder them, as both Rome and Persia were chiefly in their daies by them defended, to be able to name so many soldiours, as either of them both had in armie.
Their Memorie was suche that thei maie not be forgotten now: Iulius Caesar was as muche renowmed, for that Plinie reported, that he could dooe suche thynges by Memorie, as in readyng, in talkyng, in hearyng, and in aunsweryng at one tyme, that no fault could be founde in either of these fower qualities at one tyme practised, whereby he deserueth no lesse praise by his Memorie, then fame by his actes.
Diuers excelled in tyme paste in Memorie, as a noble Oratour of Rome was able to speake in any place, any thing which he premidated priuatly, without studie openly, he had more truste in his Memorie, then in bookes.
Carmides of Grece was so famous for this facultie, that he neuer heard any readyng, but he could repeate it worde by worde without writyng, were the writyng or readyng neuer so long, he would not misse a sillable.
Cyneas a noble and a famous Oratour, one of the counsailours of kyng Pirrhus beyng sente from Epire vnto the Senatours of Rome as an Ambassadour, he but once hearyng the names of the Senates, before he came vnto the Senate house, where when he came he named them orderly by name, euery one after an other, that all the Senatours were in a greate admiration of his Memorie, in repeatyng so many names, in openyng so many matters, in co~cludyng so many thinges, whiche when he came vnto kyng Pirrhus his master whom from Rome he recited not onely his doynges and orations, but also their aunsweres and replies, euery woorde by woorde as then was spoken, doen, or written by the Senators.
This Cyneas was not so excellent of Memorie, but also of passyng eloquence, of whom kyng Pyrrhus was wonte to saie, that he gotte more cities, tounes, and kyngdomes by the eloquence of Cineas then with all the force and strength of al the Epyrotes beside.
that Pythagoras had charge of God Mercurie to aske what he would (sauyng immortalitie) and he should haue it, and he willed to kepe in Memorie all thinges that he heard and sawe, and to forgette nothyng beyng deade, of that whiche he sawe beyng a liue, whiche beyng graunted, the soule of Athalides beyng slaine of Menelaus entered in Euphorb Secondly tooke place in Hermonius thirdly in Pyrrhus and fourthly in Pithagoras whiche had suche Memorie thereby, that he could describe the state of the liue, and the dead.
Diuers were famous for Memorie emongst the Greekes, as Archippus, Lysiades, Metrodorus, Carneades, Theodectes and others.
Many emongst the Romains were renoumed for their Memories, as Iulius Caesar, L. Scipio, Portius, Claudius Hortensius with infinite nomber.
What greate fame had Mythridates kyng of Pontus that hauyng as Plini and Gelius bothe reporte .xxij. straunge Nations, that were souldiours alwaies in warres vnder him against the Romains that he could speake xxij. languages, with out interpreter to open his minde vnto the~.
straunge thyng it is nowe to finde a man in this our ripe yeres, that can speake half a dosen speaches.
If a man can but smatter in sixe or seuen languages, he is noted to bee a rare felowe, and yet king Mythridates had .xxij.
note of greate Memorie, for some there be in learnyng one speache, that thei knowe not, thei forget an other that thei knowe.
That worthie man Lucullus is remembred of Cicero in his fourth booke of Achademicall questions, for his passyng and noble Memorie.
The Aegiptians vsed notes and figures for their Memorie, in so muche thei marked the well memoried man, with the figure of a Hare, or a Foxe, for that the Hare heare beste, and the Foxe of greateste Memorie, and if any wa~ted Memorie, thei compared hym to the
We reade of Esdras a Prieste, that had all the lawes of the Hebrues vpon his fingers ende.
We read of Portius that he neuer forgot any thyng that he once read before.
He againe would neuer read that, whiche once he wrote, but straighte out of hande, his Memorie was suche, would speake it and pronounce it in order, euen as he wrote it before.
Memorie therfore is likened vnto a Nette, whiche taketh and staieth greate fishe, and letteth through the little fishe: and euen as bookes that be not occupied waxe rustie, and cleaue together, so memorie whiche is not occupied, saieth Seneca waxe dull and obliuious, as wee oftentymes see howe forgetfull men waxe, either with sicknes, age, or suche like, that letteth the Memorie of man to be occupied: as Orbilius by extremitie of age, forgot his alphabetes and letters Hermolaus had a fre~de, whiche in his youth was a perfecte Grecian and yet in his latter yeres waxed so obliuious, that he could not read: Greke.
Plini saieth Messala surnamed Coruinus waxed so forgetfull by longe sicknesse, that he forgotte his owne name.
And Seneca doeth write of one Caluisius that was so weake of memorie, that he did forgette the names of those, that he was daiely in companie, as Achilles Vlixes and Priamus whom he knewe verie well What is it els for a manne to wante Memorie, but to wante the name of his knowen frende, for he is no man that knoweth not that man, as Augustus Caesar somtyme Emperour of Rome his beade is verie obliuious, whe~ he should come vnto the Senate, he demaunded of the Emperor, whe+ther he would commaunde hym to doe any thyng that he could doe? why saied the Emperour, take this letter with thee, that men maie knowe thee, for thou knowest no man, for thou wantest memorie.
Cicero doeth make mention of one Curio that was so obliuious beyng a iudge, that he forgotte the case; whiche he should giue iudgement vpon.
Likewise Atticus the soonne of Sophista was of fraile Memorie, that he could neuer keepe in mynde, the names of the fower Elementes, Bamba a certaine kyng of the Gotes by a draughte of drinke giuen by Heringius his successour loste his Memorie: it maie well be that drinke cutteth of Memorie For the Poetes faine, that there is a riuer in helle named Lethes whose water if any man taste thereof, he forgetteth any thyng doen, or past before.
In this were the Thracians so dulle of Memorie, that thei could not compte aboue the nomber of fower.
Now that memorie is praised in some, and obliuiousnes dispraised in others, that there wante no testimonie therein, what maie bee spoken of those, that then were compted the famous clearkes, and the renowmest Oratours in all the worlde, whiche did not onely staie in their oratio~s but also quite wer beside their matters: as Demosthenes and Cicero two noble Oratours, vpon who~ depended the state of Athens and Rome suche imperfection was in them· notwithstanding that Demosthenes was dismaied at the presence of Philip kyng of Macedonia and Cicero astonied at the presence of the Senatours, that bothe tongue and countenaunce failed these noble clearkes.
Likewise Theophrastus that graue Philosopher, successour vnto Aristotle many tymes was put to silence in the middest of his Oration, before the people of Athens
Herodes Atticus before M. Antonius quite out of countenaunce, so that the presence of princes, the dignitie of places, the maiestie of states, abate and chaunge the worthinesse of the persone.
Some againe chalenge vnto theim selues, whiche altogether thei are as voide of as Hipparchion when he would haue contended with Ruffinus he had not a woorde to speake, in so muche that a prouerbe grewe by hym, applied vnto hym that is more talkatiue then wise Hipparchion is dooen, Some againe with Cassius Seuerus whiche though all his bookes were burned by the Senatours, saied that he caried all his learnyng in minde and Memorie, whiche could not bee taken awaie, vnlesse his life likewise should bee taken awaie: For my lernyng said he, is in my mynde, and not printed in bookes.
The greatest excellencie that can be in man is Memorie, the beste iuell that manne hath is Memorie, and the nexte thing that approcheth immortalitie is Memorie, and so nigh that if a man could but remember the ende of thinges, he should neuer taste death, but he should liue for euer.
THere is no beast vpon earth, no foule in the eare, no fishe in the Sea, that séeketh his owne decaie but man, as by experience we see all things to haue a care of his owne life.
The Lion when he feeleth hym self sicke, he neuer ceaseth vntil he féedeth vpon an Ape, whereby he maie recouer former health.
The Gotes of Creet féedyng on high vpon the mountaines, when any of them is shot through with an Arrowe, as the people of that countrey are most excellent archers they seeke Dictamum and hearbe assone, as they eate any thyng of the same, the arrowe faleth downe, and the wound waxeth whole incontinent.
There are certen kyndes of Frogges in Aegypt about the floud of Nilus that haue this perseueraunce, that when by chaunce they happen to come where a fishe called Varus is, whiche is a greate mourtherer and a spoyler of Frogges, they vse to beare in their mouthes ouerthwart a long réede, which groweth about the bankes at Nilus whiche when this fishe doth gape: thinkyng to feede vpon the Frog, the réede is so long that by no meanes can he swallowe vp the Frogge, and so saue their liues.
If the frogges of Aegypt haue this vnderstanding to auoide their enemies, how muche more ought men to be circumspect of his life, which hath saie millions of enemies nether séen nor knowen.
We reade in the first boke of Aelian that the rude swine, if at any tyme by chaunce, they eate of that hearbe called Hioscyamus which draweth by by the vaines together, that skant thei can stirre, yet they striue for remedie sake to goe vnto the water, where they feede vppon yong Crabbes to recouer health.
In the same booke ye maie reede of a Sea Snaill whiche from the water doth come vnto lande to breede, and after she hath egged she diggeth the yearth and hideth her egges, and retourneth vnto the sea again, and there continueth .xl. daies, and after .xl. daies, she commeth vnto the same self place where she hidde her egges, and perceiueth that thei are ready to come out of the shell, she openeth the shell, and taketh her yong ones with her, vnto the sea.
And thus haue they care charge not onely of their owne states and liues, but also of others, and by some shewe of sence thei amende that which is most daungerous and hurtfull, for the sely and simple mise haue this kynde of fore knowledge, that when any howse waxeth olde and ruinous, they forsake their olde dwellyng and creepyng holes, they flee and seeke refuge in an other place.
The little Antes haue foresightes, that when penury and want of relife draweth nier, they waxe so painefull and laborious, toilyng and trauailyng in gatheryng together victualles as maie serue them duryng the tyme of famine.
If these smale crepyng wormes, seely and simple beastes prouide for them selues, what shall wee saie of man, the kyng and ruler ouer all beastes, who hath not onely a bodie to prouide for, but also a soule to saue.
More happie are these wormes and beastes in their kinde, then a nomber of Princes are.
For that they by nature onely are taught their foes to auoide, neither we by nature neither by God the cause of all goodnes, can loue our frendes.
Therefore verie well it is saide of the wise man, that either not to be borne, or els beyng borne streight to die is the happiest state that can chaunce vnto man.
For liuyng in this vale of miserie, wee sée the Pilgrimages and trauell of life to be such, that better farre it were be a poore quiet man, then a busie proude Prince.
And sith death is the last line of life, aswell appointed for princes as for poore men, who in reading the liues of Emperours, Kinges and Princes, the nobles of the worlde seeth not their vnhappie states, whiche commyng vnto the worlde naked, and departyng from the same naked, yet like proude pilgrimes busie one to destroye another, not co~tented with countries and kingdomes, go from one place vnto another, from one cou~trie vnto another like Pilgrimes, to bee acquainted with miserie and to seeke death.

How sore was L. Vectius set on of Caesar to betraie Pompeius the greate, whiche for the loue and zeale that Pompeius had in Rome, Caesar began to malice Lucullus, Curio, Cato and Cicero for their priuate loue towarde Pompeius no lesse daunger it is to be in fauour with princes sometime, then perilous, to bee princes, wee reade of a Quéene named Rosimunda the doughter of kyng Cunimunda of Gepida after that she poisoned Albonius king of Longobardes hir first housebande, she maried a prince of named Helinges which likewise she thought to poison, but beyng warned in ye middest of his draught, he caused his wife to drinke the reste, whiche drinke was the cause of both their death, howe manie noble Princes in the middest of their Pilgrimages died that death, as Diocletian the Emperour of Rome, Lotarius kyng of France, Carolus the eight of that name, with diuers others, as Hanibal prince of Carthage Aristobolus king of Iuda and Lucullus Emperour of Rome, Princes and noble men doe sometyme poyson theimselues, lest they should be enforced of their foes to doe what thei would, as Themistocles beyng banished fro~ his countrie Athens when he did deserue wel life and honor, beyng in seruice with Artaxerxes kyng of Persia poisoned hym self with the bloud of a Bulle, in presence of all the Persians lest he should be compelled to fight in warres againste Grece his countrey.
Euen so Aratus Prince of Sicionia perceiuyng Philip the yonger, should banishe and exile hym out of his countrey, was enforced to drinke his owne death, out of his one hande.
Euen after this sort, after long administration of common wealth, after greate honour had, and after Princely dignities possessed, with worthie renowme and same receiued, did noble Socrates learned Anaxagoras worthie Seneca famous Demosthenes poison them selues.
Thus their pilgrimages were ended, and their liues finished, their honor and dignitie, their fame and renoume did purchase them death.
Happie the~ are those, whom the worlde knowe not, ne yet desire to be acquainted with the worlde, but quiete and contented doe trauaile their Pilgrimage.

Henry the thirde was of his owne soonne, named Henry again putte in prison, where he died.
Aristonicus for all his businesse and greate doynges, was vanquished by the Consull Aquilus and put in prison where likewise he died.
In prison diuers princes ended life in foreine countries, diuers kindes of deathes, sondrie plagues happen vpon princes, more then vpon man els, as orderly meane to proue by their Pilgrimages and liues.
Some by fire, as the Emperour Phalaris of Agrigentin who was burned with all his children, and his wife in the brasen Bulle, whiche Perillus made for others, and when Perillus firste assaied this newe inuented worke before all others, and after him the Emperour hym self was put therein.
By fire was the Emperour Valentine burned of the Gothes by fire was that famous Gréeke Alcibiades destroied in Phrigia burned in bedde with his woman Tymandra after he had ruled Athens and all Grece a longe while, thus was his ende.
Sardanapalus that greate kyng, and laste prince of Assiria fearyng to fal vnto the handes of Arbactus and detestyng to die by his enemies, made a solempne fire, where he after long leude life, wantoning in luste, and followyng his desire burned hym self, it was the ende of that renoumed man Hercules whiche conquered Monsters, subdued Serpentes, Lions, Dragons, and wilde beastes, to dye by wearyng of Nessus therte the Centaur, whiche burned hym a liue.
To speake of Prince Boges the deare frende sometyme of kyng Xerxes which when he knewe that he could not escape the hande of Cimon and the power of Athens he made greate fire, where he caused his wife and concubins, his children and familie to be burned, and then his gold, siluer, and treasure, and last of all burned him self.
maie not be tedious in recityng to many names, but some to shewe and to write, that did take a part of sondrie plagues, diuers deathes.
So desirous wer men alwaies to become princes, so ambitious of honour, so gready of wealthe, that hauyng the name of a king, thei thought to auoide and escape that, whiche alwaies harde at the heeles of Princes, meane death, were not Princes hanged of their owne subiectes, whiche is the vilest and moste ignomious death that can bee.
Achaeus kyng of Lidia for that he troubled his subiectes with newe taskes and Subsidies, he was hanged of his owne Subiectes ouer the riuer Pactolus Bomilchar a Prince of Libia beyng suspected of his owne countrey men the Carthaginians that he had conspired with Agathocles vnto the annoyaunce of the subiectes, was hanged in the citie of Carthage in the middest of the Markette.

Herodotus dooeth affirme, that Leonides that famous kyng of Sparta that long ruled the Lacedemonians with great fame and renowme, was by Xerxes kyng of Persia after his heade was smitten of, commaunded notwithstandyng to be hanged.
Trogus dooth write of Hanno a Prince of Carthage whiche flourished in the tyme of kyng Philippe father to Alexander the greate, whiche for his prosperous successe, Fortune, and lucke that he had in all his attemptes, he waxed to be suche a tyrau~t that his owne people firste bounde hym with coardes, whipt hym with roddes, pluckt out his eyes, brake his legges, cutte of his handes: and at laste to recompence his Tyrannie, thei hanged hym vp in Carthage
These were no meane men, that thus were hanged in their owne Countrey, of their owne people: But honoure which is alwaies ambitious, doeth bryng this to passe euery where.
These Princes were in the middeste of life, arrested by death, and by diuers kindes of death.
Some as you haue heard with poison, some with fire, some with hangyng haue ended their Pilgrimages, some againe were deuoured of their owne horses, as Diomedes kyng of Thracia was foode hym self vnto those beastes, whiche before he fedde with mennes bodies.
The kyng of Eubaea for his tyrannie in Boaetia was giuen by Hercules to be eaten of his owne horses.
Lucinius the Emperour, at what tyme he had appointed his doughter Herina should bée giuen vnto his horses to be eaten, he hym self ministryng her as fode vnto theim, was torne in péeces.
It happened that Neocles the sonne of that noble Greeke Themistocles was by a horse likewise deuoured.
This plague was not straunge vnto Princes, for thei were alwaies subiecte vnto all kinde of deathes.
After that famous Prince Metius Capitaine of the Libians had broken with the Romains promise of truce and amitie, he was afterward, as Liui doeth witnesse, taken and drawen of fower greate horses a liue, at the commaundemente of Tullus Hostilus beyng then kyng of Rome
Kyng Theseus soonne Hippolitus beeyng then falsely of his Mother in lawe Quéene Phaedra accused, fliyng to auoide the furie and rage of his Father at the requeste of the Quéene, was torne in peeces of wilde horses.
But let vs passe further, and then we shall reade, that some againe, euen as thei afore saied Princes were deuoured of horses, were of Serpentes stonged vnto death, as Laocon that worthie Troian was in open sighte of twoo Serpentes destroied, yea, that famous and warlike woman Cleopatra Queene of Aegypt after her louer and frende Marcus Antonius was conuicted by Augustus Caesar the Emperour, she had rather to bee ouercomed with Serpentes, then subdued by Caesar
With this death was Opheltes Lycurgus sonne kyng of Menea vanquished.
Again some of wilde Bores, and ragyng Lions perished, as Anceus kyng of and Paphages kyng of Ambracia perished in the like miserie, the one by a Boore, the other by a Lion.
Plini in his seuenth booke, maketh mention of a Quéene in Bythinia named Cosinges kyng Nicomedes wife, whom her owne dogges slue, and tare in péeces.
Euripides that learned Greeke commyng in the nighte tyme, from Archelaus kyng of Macedonia with whom he had béen at supper was by an ill willer of his mette, named Promerus whiche set his dogges to mangle hym vnto death.
Eue~ so were Heraclitus and Diogines bothe Philosophers, by dogges likewise deade.
maie not forget so greate a Prince as Basilius the Emperour of Macedon which in huntyng emongest his lordes and nobles, yea, emo~gest thousandes of his Commons, he onely meetyng a Harte in the chase, was prickt in the legge, and so died.
As for Seleucus kyng of Siriae soone vnto Antiocus surnamed the GOD, and Bela kyng of Pannonia thei were bothe throwen by their horses, and so died.
If these mischaunces happen vnto princes in the middest of their glorie and state, what is it then but miserie of mortalitie, and pilgrimages of Princes, sithe nothyng expelleth fate, nor can auoide death.
Some so wearie of life, some so fearfull of death, that thei threwe them self vnto waters to be drouned, others for all diligente feare, watchyng for death, were moste shamfully, notwithstandyng by death preuented.

It is written in Curtius that Queene Sysiga~bis kyng Darius mother died of honger.

Eue~ as somtime Lycurgus king of Thracia was of his owne Subiectes, throwen headlong vnto the sea, for that he first mingled water with wine.
How many famous and noble princes were stoned, and by stones deade, as valiaunte Pyrrhus kyng of the Epirotes beyng in warres with Antigonus was slaine by an olde woman with a Tile stone at Argos, Pyra~der at what tyme the Athenians warred against Eumolpus for that he feared famine, hidden the wheat from his souldiours, was therefore of theim stoned to death: Euen so was Cinna the Romain at the warres betwixte the Fre~chemen and Rome for the like thing stoned vnto death stoute Cebrion king Priamus sonne was slaine by a stone of Patroclus at the siege of Troy so was Cignus of Achilles at the same time.
vnstedfaste Fortune, that little stones should ende so many famous liues of Princes, vnprudente Princes, that knowe not how nigh alwaies ye are vnto death.
How many did God punishe, and plague with sodaine death for their offences and misliuyng: as Mythridates kyng of Pontus, Nicanor the soonne of Parmenio kyng of Macedonia as Curtius in his v. booke dooe write, died sodainly.

The vncertaine state of Princes, the flattrie before, and the enuie behinde, is seen and tried by their death.
Who liueth so shorte a tyme as a Prince? Who dieth so straunge a death as a prince? Who liueth in care? Who dieth liuyng but a prince? was not Sergius Galba and Commodus the sonne of Marcus surnamed Anbilius twoo Emperours of Rome the one by Otho strangled in the Markette place of Rome the other by Marcia his owne Concubine, after he ruled Rome xiij. yeres.

Likewise Cethegus, Gabinius, Ceparius and Stabilius for that thei rebelled with Catelin were appoincted by the Senatours to bée strangled in prison.
Nothyng so vncertaine as the state of princes, nothing more deceiptfull then princes again as well proued by histories: For Minoes kyng of Crete trauailyng after Daedalus vnto Sicilia was there of his great fre~de kyng Cocalus as he supposed, slaine through deceipt, euen so was Alebas chief gouernour of Larissa a citie in Thessalie murthered of his owne souldiors.

GOD gaue theim ouer in the middeste of their pleasure, euen eatyng and drinkyng, as Septimus and Valentianus twoo famous Emperours died of surfette, for wante of disgestion.
What is the life of Princes, but an vncertaine Pilgrimages, whiche scante seeth his daies fully by nature graunted as we see how, and after what sort thei die daiely euery where.
There was greate difference betwene the Pilgrimage of Vlixes and his felowes, whiche Cirses the Witche did chaunge theim vnto diuers kindes of beastes, for that thei knewe not what Pilgrimage meante, and Vlixes hym self kepte his naturatl shape and frame.
And for that in his pilgrimage he was wise and painfull in his life, he did learne of Aeolus Phisick, of Cirses Magicke, of Calipso Astronomie, and that vnder couler of fables.
That pilgrimage is onely appointed vnto manne, to knowe hym self, and to serue his God, diuers learned Philosophers, as Pithagoras, Democritus, Anaxogaras trauailed from Grece vnto Aegypte vnto Persia vnto Caldea and to diuers other countries for knowledge sake.

Dissimulations, cautelles, craftes, as thei are most euill to practise wicked thynges, so are thei of the contrary, moste necessary to doe good, as Euclides whiche vsed the like crafte as before, but to the better purpose, where thei practised this feate, to feede luste, to pleasure affection, he vsed it to see Socrates reade Philosophie, and to learne wisedome, for there was a Lawe betwene Athens and the Megaris for the greate hatered that the one bare vnto the other, that who so euer came from Athens vnto Megaris should die.

THE spoyle and slaughter of lust, did alwaies farre passe all other vices, it hath suppressed Castles countreis, it hath vanquished Kynges and Kesars, ouerthrown the po~pe of Asia, Africa and Europe and almoste depopulated the whole worlde.
This vice of all vices is to be abhorred detested, for there is no vice but it is addicted of it self to applie those, which it doeth beste fancie, as pride chiefly hath her seate appoincted in puisant Princes and Noble menne.

Had Phasiphae quene of Crete béen well matched, she had forsaken kyng Minoes and come to the emperour Caligula where she might been as boulde with others, as she was with Mynotaurus father, had the Empresse Messalina been worthely accordyng vnto hir lief maried she had been more meete for Nero then for Claudius for his life and hir life did well agree together, for she past all the Courtezaunce of Corinth all the Strumpets of Athens and all the hoores of Babilon for she was onely mistris and ruler of all the stewes and brothell houses in Rome, what wickednesse procéeded from lust, what vngodly incest is brought to passe by lust, what secret vengeaunce co~meth by luste, luste allured quéene Cleopatra to vse hir brother Ptholomeus as hir housband.

And thus the popular state, whiche had chief rule alwaies of Rome, chaunged states of the Citie diuers times, for that luste so raigned.

Thus wee perceiue that by sight, we are moued to luste, and by consent we wilfully synne, the one in the eye, the other in the harte, therfore better it is with Sophocles for a man to turne his backe from a faire woman, and to saie a madde dogge, then with Nero to beholde beautie, who looking to earnestly vpo~ Pompeias héere, was moued therby to lusts.
Question refused of all the Gods to bee answered whether man or woman is more ielowsie, for as the poets faine, there sprong a contention betweene Iupiter and Iuno concernyng Lechery and Ielowzy, and hauyng no equall iudge to speake of this matter, it was posted, after greate controuersie vnto one Tiresias an auncient and learned Poet sometyme in Thebes whiche Tiresias on a certaine tyme metyng twoo Snakes accompanyng together, and accordyng vnto kynde engenderyng together, hauyng a white rodde in his hande, departed theim with sharpe strokes.

This Tiresias was thought moste meete of Iupiter and Iuno by the consent of all the Goddes, for that he had been a woman seauen yeares, and nowe a man againe to Iudge of this question.
And beyng called vnto the Barre to geue his Uerdite, hee preferred Iuno for Ielowsie, whereby Iuno waxed angrie, and made hym blinde, and Iupiter to recompence his truth, made him a Prophet.
And then hee proued that when Iupiter fell in loue with Iolla, Iuno beyng suspicious and full of Ielowsie, caused one named Argos with an hundred eies to watche Iupiter which for all his eyes was deceiued, Iuno therby was so furious and so angrie with Argos that she translated his hundred eyes vnto a Pecockes taile, and transformed Iola vnto a white Cowe.
There is no suche rage nor anger in Ielowsie, as there is wilines and craft in loue, so that the streight pinning and kepyng of Danaes kyng Acrisius doughter in Towres and Castels, cold neuer kepe hir from valiant Perseus neither the hundred eies of Argos might spie the craft of Iupiter vnto Iola
We reade of a womanne named Procris who was in suche Ielowsie of her housbande whiche was called Cephalus and hauyng hym in suspition for his often goyng a huntyng, on a certaine tyme she folowed hym priuely vnto the woddes, thinkyng there to finde hir housbande at his praie, and hiding hir self in a thicke bush, to see the ende of thinges, hir housband passyng by the bush, perceiuyng somthyng there, to stéer, thinkyng it had been some wilde beast, thrust his wife vnto the hart with his darte, and thus Procris was slain of hir owne housbande, for hir importunate Ielowsie.
The like happened vnto Aemilius wife, whiche for hir suspicious minde and ragyng ielowsie, neuer quiet, but busie alwaies to finde some faulte in hir housband, folowyng hym euery where, and watchyng still in euerie secrette seate and spiyng in priuie places, thinking to finde him with the maner, vntil she spead of the like chaunce as Procris did, she could neuer rest.

straunge kind of sicknes, that so infecteth the mind, that vexeth the spirites and molesteth the hearte, that the head is ful of inuention, the minde full of thought, and the hearte full of reuengement.
So Ielows was Phanius that inuented this in his head, and thought this in his minde, that the doores beyng shut, the windowes cloase, all priuie and secret places preuented, euery where as he thought stopte, his wife could not deceiue hym, neuer thought that loue could pearce Tile stones to come vnto his wife, but he was deceiued, for the lurkyng dennes of loue, the Lion caues of fancies, the secrete searche of affection haue more priuie pathes wherby that Cupide maie come to his mother Venus then Labiranthus had chambers for Minotaurus kyng Acrisius thoughte he was so sure of his doughter Danaes when that she was close bulwarkt with a greate castell, Iuno thought to preuent Iupiter by the hundred eies of Argos, Phanius thought that his wife was sure when the doores were shut and the windowes cloase.

For thei saie ielowsie proceadeth from loue, and loue from God, but saie it commeth from hatered, and hatered commeth from the Deuill.
And because we reade in the sacred scripture, that Abraham was in ielowsie of his wife Sara saiyng, thus vnto his wife, know that thou art faire, and that they will kill mée to haue thy loue, the maners of the Parthia~s were to kepe their wiues in pruie places of their houses, ouer whom thei were so ielouse that their wiues might not go abroad but with couered faces.

Who hated learning so much as Heraclides and Philonides which are so ignoraunte, that thei were coumpted, as Caelius doeth testifie, as laughyng stockes, and had of the common people in greate derision, for their ignorance and folie.
These blinde baiardes, and bolde bedlemes, call others Asses of Cuma when that thei themselues are farre inferiour to any Asse of the worlde.
For diuers Asses had more reason then Philonides or Heraclides had.
Wée reade that Ammonius a greate Peilosopher of Alexandria had an Asse, that would accompany with Origen and Porphiri to frequente the schoole of Ammonius to heare hym reade Philosophie vnto his scholers.

So that some Countreis are naturally giuen to trauaill, as the Lidians, Phrigians Frenche men, with others.
Some againe giuen to Idlenesse, as the Persians, Corinthians, Englishemen with others.
Some by lawe forced to flie idlenes, some by punishemente feared, some by death enforced to labour for their liuyng.

Wherfore that greate Philosopher perceiuyng the furious and hastie nature of Alexander wrote from Athens vnto India, where this noble conquerour was at warres with kyng to take hede of wrath and anger saiyng.
Anger ought not to be in any Prince towarde his inferiour, for that may be mended with correction, nor towarde his equall, for it maie bee redressed with power, so that anger ought not to be but against superiours, but Alexander hat no coequales, yet in vaine was Aristotles doctrine vnto Alexander in that point, for beyng in a banquet, when Clitus his deere frende and foster brother, commended his father kyng Philip of Macedone to bee the worthiest and most renoumed prince then liuyng, Alexander waxed vpon a sudden so angrie, to preferre anie man before hym, though Philip was his owne brother which was commended, and Clitus his especiall frende that did commende hym, thinkyng rather to deserue praise at Alexander hand, then to spead of death was thrust vnto the harte with a Speare.

If anger make men murtherers, if wrath make me~ mad without wit or reason to know themselues or others, let theim imitate Plato in his anger, which being angrie with any of his scholers or seruantes, would geue the rod to Xenocrates to correcte theim, for that he was angrie the learned Philosopher misdoupted himself, that he coulde not vse modest correction, euen so Architas would alwaies speak vnto his seruauntes whiche had offended hym.
Happie art thou that Architas is angrie, lettyng his man vnderstande howe dangerous wrath is, for as Aristotle saieth the angrie man seeth not the thyng which lieth vnder his féete· Agustus Caesar Emperour of Rome desired Athenedorus a philosopher of Gréece, whiche a long time accompanied Augustus in Rome, and nowe readie to departe vnto Athens his natiue zoile, of some sentence that the emperour might thinke of him.

The fame and renoume that both Themistocles and Aristides in vanquishyng their anger one towardes an other, for beyng sent both as embassadours for the state of Athens, trauailyng ouer a high hill, like wise men that subdued affection, and conquired anger, Themistocles saide vnto Aristides shall we both burie our anger in this hill, and go as frendes and not as enemies, and there though the cause was greate, at Athens they became frendes one vnto an other, forgetting and forgeuing one anothers fault.
Anger and wrath are the only poisons of the words wher hidden hatered doeth proceade, for to norishe the one is to feede the other.
Therfore it is written, that hidden hatered, priuate wealth, and young mennes counsell, hath been the verie cause of diuers destructions.
Manlius Torquatus, after he had conquered Campania and triumphed ouer the Lateus retournyng vnto the Citie with noble fame, and renoumed victories, though the Senatours and Elders of the Citie, mette hym in a triumphe and honour of his victories: yet the younge men of Rome more disdainefull, then courteous, more odious then louyng, more willyng to haue his death, then desirous of his life, kept them rather his enemies lurkyng in Rome towardes hym, then frendes, the cause is knowen in Valerius

¶Of Periurie and Faithe, and where either of these were honored, and esteemed.
SIthe Faithe is the foundation of Iustice, and Iustice the chiefe meanes, as Aristotle saieth, to preserue a publique weale, for we se after muche fomyng and frettyng of seas, after clustryng cloudes, after longe lowryng lookes, there doe often appere calme weather, cleare aire, and gentle countenaunce, whiche to obserue, and to maintaine Iustice, is the worker therof, and to note how faithfull and iuste some haue been, and how wicked and false others shewed them selues, for the commoditie and benefite of that one, and for the discommoditie and iniuries of the other, good it were to shewe the examples thereof.
There are not so many vertuous in one, but there bee as many vices in an other.
For some from foes become frendes, as Clodius and Cicero twoo greate enemies a long tyme, and yet in tyme twoo faithfull frendes.
Tiberius likewise, and Affricanus from mortall foes, grewe to bee suche perpetuall frendes, that Affricanus gaue his onelie daughter Cornelia in marriage vnto Tiberius
Euen so some again from frendes became foes, yea, from tried frendship, vnto mortall enemitie, as Dion of Siracusa of his moste assured frende (as he thought) with whom alwaies before he founde frendshippe and faithe, was slain and cruelly killed of Callicrates.
Polimnestor likewise, though kyng Priamus supposed greate trust and confidence in hym, that he committed his owne soonne Polidorus vnto his custodie, yet falsely slue hym, and murthered hym: though beside frendshippe, he was his nigh kinseman.
How well saieth Socrates that faithefull frendes doe farre excell Gold, for in daunger faithe is tried, and in necessitie freindes are knowen.
Suche is the secrete force of Faithe, and suche is the hidden subtiltie of falsehode, that the praise and commendations of the one, shall bee seen and proued in a historie of Sextus Pompeius soonne and heire vnto Pompeius the Greate, the slaunder and shame of the other, shall bee manifestly knowen by Hanibal sonne of Carthage.
The Faithe and Iustice of Pompeius at what tyme he had appoincted a banquette for Augustus Caesar and Marcus Antonius vpo~ the seas, was well tried, for beyng moued of diuers at that tyme, to reuenge his fathers death Pompeius the greate, and specially often stirred by his frende· and Maister of the Shippe.
Menedorus to requite olde malice, for killyng of Pompeius to destroie Caesar and Antonius whiche Sextus in no waies would suffer, saiyng: that Faithe and Iustice, ought not to bee tourned vnto periurie and falshed, for as it is periurie, to omitte faithe and promise made vnto these Emperors, so this is tyra~nie and not iustice, to reuenge my fathers death vpon innoce~cie.
And true it was that Augustus Caesar was then but a boie, brought vp in Schoole in Apulia when his vncle Iulius Caesar vanquished Pompei
And as for Marcus Antonius rather a freinde he was vnto Sextus Father, then a foe, and therefore no lesse Faithfull was Sextus in performyng, then iuste in waiyng innocencie.
Farre vnlike vnto Haniball whiche vnder pretence of peace with the Romaines sente Embassadours vnto Rome to entreate thereof, where thei were honourablie receiued: but well requited he the courtesie of Rome toward his Embassadours.
For whe~ that noble Romain Cornelius came from Rome, as an Embassadour vnto Haniball his welcome was suche· that he neuer went a liue vnto Rome againe, for moste cruelly and falsely was he slaine by Haniball
In this falshed and periurie was Haniball muche defamed, not as muche corrupted by vilenesse of his owne nature, which alwaies in this, was not to bee trusted, but by the falshode and corruption of the Countrey, of whiche it is prouerbially spoken Poeni perfidi false Carthaginians for the people of Carthage delited in falshode· practized periurie, and vsed all kind of craftes, as the people of Sarmatha were moste false in wordes, moste deceiptfull in deedes, and moste cruell one towardes an other.
The Scithians beyng muche molested with warres, and driuen to leaue their wiues at home, in the custodie of the slaues seruauntes, thei hauyng occasion to bee absent iiij. yeres whose wiues married the seruauntes, brake their former Faithe with their owne housbandes, vntill with force and power their seruauntes were slain, and so recouered their countreis wiues again.
Apollonius the chief gouernour of whom the commons of the Countrey, from lowe estate had exalted vnto dignitie vnto whom thei committed the gouernment and state of Samios was so false of his faithe towardes his subiectes, that hauyng their goodes, landes, liuynges, and liues in his owne hand, he betraied theim vnto Philip king of Macedonia, their moste mortall enemie.
That proude periurer Cocalus king of Sicilia, slue kyng Minoes of Crete, though vnder colour of frendshippe, and pretence of talke he had sente for hym.
Cleomenes brake promise with the Argiues, with whom he tooke truce for certaine daies, craftely betraied them in the night, slue them being sleping, and emprisoned against his former faith, and promise made before.
Euen so did the false Thracians with the Boetians brake promise, violated faithe, destroied their countries, depopulated their cities, and of professed frendes, and vowed faithe, became wicked foes, and false traitors.
But of all false periurers, and vnnaturall foes, shal Zopirus emongest the Persians, and Lasthenes emongest the Olinthians to their perpetuall slaunder and reproche, bee mentioned, of the one borne in the famous citie of Babilon, deformed hym self in suche sort, with suche dissimulation of forged faithe, that hauyng the rule and gouernment in his hande, he brought kyng Darius to enioye that, through his periurie and falshode, that with long warres in many yeres, he might not va~quishe nor subdue: The other as falsly, beyng ye onely trust of the citize~s, deliuered Olinthus their citie, vnto the handes of their long and greate enemie, Philippe kyng of Macedonia.
What fraude hath been founde alwaies in frendship? What falshode in faithe? What deceipte in truste, the murtheryng of Princes, the betraiyng of kyngdomes, the oppressyng of innocentes from tyme to tyme, in al places, can well witnesse the same.
When Romulus had appoincted Spu Tarpeius to be chief capitaine of the Capitoll, the chamber of Rome, where the substaunce wealth of Rome did remain.
Tarpeia Spurius doughter, whiche in the night tyme, as she wente for water out of the citie, metyng Tatius kyng of ye Sabins though he was then mortall enemie vnto Rome, in co~tinual warres with Romulus yet by false Tarpeia brought to be lord of the Capitoll, thus Tarpeia beyng as false vnto Rome, as king Tatius was, likewise false vnto Tarpeia for she loking to haue promise kept of Tatius fou~d him as Rome founde her.
She was buried a liue of Tatius by the Capitoll, whiche was called Saturnus mou~t and by her death buriall, there named Tarpeius rocke vntill Torquinus Superbus tyme, whiche first named it the Capitoll, by findyng a mans heade in that place.
There was neuer in Rome suche falshode shewed by any man, as was of Sergius Galba whiche caused there famous cities of Lusitania to appere before him, promi+sing them great co~modities, and diuers pleasures, concernyng the states and gouernment of their citie, yeldyng his faith and truth, for the accomplishment of the same, whose professed faithe allured to ye no~ber of ix. M. yong menne, piked and elected for some enterprises, for the profite of their countrey, whiche when false Galba had spoiled these thrée cities of al flowers of their youthes, against all promise and faithe, slue the moste parte of theim, sould and enprisoned the rest, whereby he most easely might conquire their Cities, men are neuer certen nor trustie in doing, when thei are fautie in For as the Sunne lighteneth the Moone, so faithe maketh man in all thinges perfect, for prudence without faith, is vaine glorie and pride.
Iustice without faith, is turned vnto iniurie, and fortitude vnto slouthfulnes.
The orders in diuers countreis for the obseruation of frendship, and for maintenaunce of certen and sure loue one towarde an other, were diuers othes.
The noble Romains at what tyme thei sweare had this order he or she, to take a flint ston in his right hand, saiyng these wordes.
If be gilty or offende any man, betraie my countrey, or deceiue my frende willingly.
wishe to be cast awaie out of Rome, by great Iupiter, as cast this stoan out of my hand, and withall threwe the stoan awaie.
The auncient Scithians, to obserue amitie and loue, had this law.
They powred a greate quantity of wine in a greate Boule or a Cup, and with their kniues launced some parte of their bodies, letting their bloud to runne likewise, one after an other, vnto that cup, and then minglyng the wine and blood together, tipt the ende of their Speares· and ther Arrowes in the wine, takyng the boule in hand, drank one vnto another, professing by that draught, faith and loue.

For Pylades was not mencioned nor spoken of, but onely Orestes he it was that should steale their Goddes awaie vnto Gréece.

Howe much did noble Curtius and famous Decius surmount that cruell and Tigrishe L. Silla and that wicked impe C. Mari{us} they through the like Oracle moued, were redie in harnesse to mount on horsebacke, to offer themselues aliue, vnto an open dampe and gulfe to saue Rome: the other with sworde and fire no lesse willing to destroy Rome, then studious to spoyle their natiue zoyle and countrie of Italie.

Mithridates the bloodie king of Pontus slue his thrée sonnes, and thrée daughters, kilde hys wife Laodices and maried an other straight named Hipsicratea
Tiranny lurcketh in the hidden vaines and secret bowels of enuie: for euen as Mithridates slue his wife Laodices so Constantine the great Emperor slue his wife Fausta and Nero murthered his wife Poppea
To speake of Cleander, Aristratus, Strates, Sabillus with innumerable more, shoulde wearie any reader with the prolixity therof.
The state of Rome where such chaunge was by meanes of tiranny, that now they raigne vnder Monarchia and then vnder streight Aristocratia
And thus the common séeking by chaunge the amendement of Princes, kept alwayes the chiefe rule and gouernement of the Cittie of Rome vnder Democratia which is the popular gouernement, considering the corruption of Princes, to the immortall fame and perpetuitie of credite.
Though it be a harde question to knowe where tirannye is least shewed, eyther in that common welth, where the people bare swaye, or where elected number doe rule, or where one doth gouerne, which is hardely discussed and disputed of the learned, for the maintenaunce of eyther of these: but that shall be touched in the Chapter of common wealthes and gouernement of Princes.
FLatterie is the swéete bayte of enuie, the cloake of malice, the onelye pestilence of the worlde, a monster ougly to beholde if it coulde be séene, verye terrible to trust if it might be knowne: with as many heades as Hidra to inuent wickednesse: with as many handes as Briareus to commit euill: with as many eyes as Argos to beholde vengeaunce: with as swift legges as Thalus to go to naughtinesse, entering into euerye mans house with a tongue as swéete as honey, hyding in euery mans hart as bitter as gall, of whome the olde poeme is spoken, Mel in ore, verba lactis: fel in corde, fraus in factis.

For euen as tyranny is hidden in the secret bowels of enuie, so is enuie cloked vnder filed phrase of flattery, and very wel compared to the Crocodils of Nilus or to the Cirenes of ye seas, the one wéeping mourning, the other singing laughing: the one with mone, the other with mirth study how to annoy ye poore Mariner.
The flattering Parasite as Ouid saith, denyeth with the negatiue, and affirmeth with the affirmatiue, wéepeth with him that is sad, and laugheth with him that is mery: as sometime Clisophus when his maister Philip King of Macedonia and Father vnto Alexander the great, woulde hault bicause hée had the gout, he would hault likewise: when the king would be mery at his drinke, Clisophus woulde not be sad: In fine, what soeuer Philip tooke in hande, the same Clisophus did maintaine.
Aristippus the Philosopher coulde better please King Dionisius with adulation, then Dion the Syracusan coulde pleasure him with trueth.
Cleo coulde better accomplish the desire lust of Alexander with forged flattery, then Calisthenes his Counsellour coulde satisfie him with Philosophy and trueth.
Who might mooue Caesar to do any thing asmuch as Curio the Parasite, not Pompeius his sonne in lawe: nor yet his onely daughter Iulia nor all the Senators of Rome might make Caesar friende or foe as muche as Curio

For who is more made of, than hée that ought least to bée estéemed? who is trusted more, than hée that deceyueth sonest? who is hearde more at all times, than hée that ought least to come in sight at any time? who hath more of all men than hée that deserueth least of all men? In fine, who is more beloued any where, than he that ought most to be hated euery where? The common people of the Meedes and Perseans for that they knéeled vnto Alexander and made him the sonne of Iupiter were more estéemed for their flatterie therein, than the nobles of Macedonia for their truth and plaine dealing.
What is it, but flattery bringeth to passe?

Dion of Sirecusa was slaine by his flattering friende Calicrates
sucking serpent of cancred malice, whose small fruict is terrible death.

What flatterie was betwéene Iason and Medea what deceit followed? what adulation was betwixt Theseus and Ariadne what falshood ensued? the one king Oetes daughter of the land of Cholcos helping Iason vnto the golden fléece: the other king Minos daughter of Créete, deliuering Theseus out of the dreadfull dennes of Labirinthus from the monster Mynotaurus but both deceyued by flattery? howe the Troyan Prince Aeneas deceyued Quéene Dido with flatterie? how the Grecian Demophon beguiled Quéene Phillis with adulation? howe diuers such Quéenes, Ladies and others, haue béene allured and entised by fayre spéech, the daylye experience with pollicie and practise therein, is a certaine and sure proofe of the same, which bicause they are common histories will omitte to speake of.
But passe we forwarde in the pilgrimages and affayres of Princes.
Who murthered Caesar that worthy Emperour, in the Senate house of Rome?

Where is their greater tiranny shewed, then where flattery is most vsed? Where is there greater deceyt practized, than where curtezie is most tendered? Where is more falshoode tryed, then where trust is most reposed? The first thing that deceyued man was flatterie, which the Diuell the serpent put in vre to deceyue Eue flattering hir, saying: if thou eate of this fruite, thou shalt know good and euill, and you shall be as Goddes on earth.
As the Diuell is the only aucthor of all lies, so is hée the only father of flatterie, attempting alwayes the best and not the worst: accompanying the hiest and not the lowest, freque~ting the court more than the countrie, approching nier stately princes, than poore beggers.
And no meruell when Christ was assaulted with flattery of the Diuell, promising him all the world if hée would knéele and flatter him.

Or else wish that wise men, which are sonest of all by flattery allured, to imitate the example of a noble man of Thebes named Ismenias who being sent Embassadour from Thebes vnto Persea vndersta~ding the maners fashions of the prowde Perseans that nothing can be gotten without flatterie, no body can be hearde without knéeling, dyd lette downe his ring to the grounde, whereby he might stoope before the King, not vnto the King, but to take vp his ring.
Or else woulde wishe all men to aunswere flatterers, as Diogines aunswered Aristippus who speaking vnto Diogines that if Diogines could be content to flatter Dionisius the King, hée néeded not to licke dishes, or to liue poorely in Athens vnto whom hée aunswered: if Aristippus coulde be content to licke dishes or to liue poorely in Athens he néeded not to flatter Dionisi{us}
It is read in Caelius that the women of Cipria were most giue~ to loue flatterie, insomuch they knéeled downe to bowe and bende their shoulders, as a footestoole vnto their Ladies to mount vnto their Chariots: surely the men of Persea and the women of Cipria engendred such broode of flattering Parasites, that glorious Maysters neuer want flattering seruauntes.
Haue we not many now a dayes that will speake vnto their friendes as Nicesias was woont to saye to Alexander the great, being wounded and his bloode gushing out? what noble bloode is thys? this bloode commeth from some God and not of man, that saye flattering Nicesias woulde affirme that, that Gnat which happened to taste of the bloode of Alexander must néedes farre surmount other Gnats.
The wiseman saith that fiue things ought of all men to be mistrusted: a straunge Dogge, an vnknowen horse, a holowe banck, a talkatiue woman, and a flattering seruaunt.

Demetrius hauing then obtayned victory in the warres at Salamina being so ioyfull and glad of his hap, did sende Aristodemus a very subtill and a cunning flatterer, to certifie his father King Antigonus of his prosperous successe, geuing in charge vnto him to shew the King his father orderly the triumph and victory in large maner.
Aristodemus no lesse ioyfull of the message, then skilfull in flatterye, leauing his Nauay and his company in Cipris went on lande towarde King Antigonus who hauing vnderstanding that Aristodemus was come from his sonne Demetrius being desirous after long looking of newes, to heare of the warres and successe of his sonne, sent diuers to méete him on the way, to know the trueth and effect of his comming: he saluting all men as one very sad, and so sad that all men iudged that either Demetrius was slaine, or else lost the fielde.
The King being certified that Aristodem{us} was very sad, and that there was no likenesse of good newes, came hastily to méete him: which when Aristodem{us} saw, he cryed out with a loude voyce a farre of, saying: Most happy art thou King Antigon{us} commended of the gods, saluted of Demetrius and this day feared of all the world.
Thy sonne is conquerer ouer conquerers, and King ouer Kinges, triumphant victor in the warres at Salamina: thus artificially Aristodemus vsed suche flattery before King Antigonus that the King had as great a delite to heare Aristodemus flattering phrase, as he had ioy and gladnesse of the prosperitie of his sonne Demetrius
Thus Aristodemus with flattery won the heart, and waded the bowels of King Antigonus that his rewarde was as much by his flatterye, as his thankes was for his newes.
Marcus Antonius delited so much in the flattering speache of the Athinians at what time he was enforced to forsake Rome by meanes of Augustus Caesar who to reuenge the death of his Uncle Iulius threatned.

Aristippus when he might not obtaine his purpose at Dionisi{us} hande with flattery and faire words, he would knéele downe embrasing and kissing his féete, and being accused of his friendes for that he was a Philosopher, to be a flatterer, he aunswered them in this sort: Aristipp{us} is not in fault to speake vnto any man where his eare is, Dionisius rather is to be blamed to heare at his féete, or to haue his eares at his héeles.
Diogines therfore being demaunded what beast was most hurtfull vnto man: of wilde beastes sayde he, a tyraunt: of tame beastes, a flatterer.
What greater hurt happened vnto that noble and famous Alcibiades then flattery of fained fréendes, to take him awaye from his maister Socrates with whom he was instructed in Philosophie to knowe him selfe, to bée acquainted with selfe loue, and to glory in flattery, that at length with Timandra his harlot, who a long time beguiled him with flattery, ye house being fired, hée was forced to flée naked from his foe vnto the midst of his enimies to be slaine.
And thus this valiaunt Gréeke was shamfully slaine by flattery, whom ye learned Thucidides could neuer sufficiently praise his vertues otherwise: what subiect is he that deliteth not in flattery? what prince is he yt is not pleased with adulation? What God is he saith the Poet that loueth not his commendation and prayse? Hercules was gladde to heare the adulation of Cercopes.
Bacchus was ioyfull to heare the flatterie of Silen{us} Euen Iupiter himselfe the king of gods, was delighted in Vulcan
The remedie therefore to auoyde this Gorgon, to expell this monster, to exile this murtherer, is as Cato the wiseman sayth, to vse truth: for he that vseth to heare good talke alwayes, will neuer speake euill anye time.
The nature of flatterie was so knowne, that it was so hated of Augustus the Emperour, that he lothed knéeling of his housholde seruauntes.
Tiberius the Emperour likewise woulde in no wise suffer anye of his owne men, to call him Lorde, for that there is but one Lorde.
Flatterie was so abhorred in Athens that when Timagoras was sent as an Embassadour vnto Darius king of Persea for that hée flattered the King in talke at his returne, hée was beheaded· Euen so Euagoras for that hée called Alexander the sonne of Iupiter was punished vnto death.
The Lacedemonians feared flattery so much, that they banished Archilogus onlye for his eloquence in a Booke that he made.
Flatterie was so odious in Rome, that Cato the Censor gaue co~maundement to expell certen fine Oratours of Athens out of Rome, least with fayre speache and flattery they might annoy the state of Rome: what is it but flatterie can compasse? what may not sugred Oratours mooue? what coulde not Demosthenes doe in Athens what might not Cicero perswade in Rome? King Pirrhus was woont to saye of Cineas his Philosopher, that hée won more Citties, Townes, and countries, through the flattering stile of Cineas than he euer subdued with the strength and force of all the kingdome of Epire
But to auoyd two much iarring of one string, which as Plutarch sayth is tedious to the reader, for nature is desirous (sayth Plantus of nouelties.
Leauing flatterye as counsaylour vnto Princes, hayle with noble men, chamberlaine with Ladies, chiefe gouernour of the common people.
To speake a little of those that fledde flatterie, it was the onely cause that Pithagoras that noble Philosopher forsooke his countrie Samos: the whole occasion, that worthy and learned Solon fledde from Athens the chiefe matter, that made Licurgus to renounce Lacedemonia and the onely cause that made Scipio Nasica forsake Rome: for where flattery is estéemed, there truth is banished: where flatterie is aduanced and honored, there truth is oppressed and vanquished: In fine, flatterie findeth frindeshippe, when truth getteth hatred, as prooued in the histories of Senica and Calisthenes two famous Philosophers: the one Maister vnto Nero Emperour of Rome· the other appoynted by Aristotle to attende vppon Alexander the great King of Macedonia which Philosophers bycause they would not féede the corrupt natures insolent mindes of these prowde Princes, with adulation and flatterye, they were both put to death: Seneca by Nero for his paine and trauell taken with the Emperour in reading him philosophie, while Nero was young: Calisthenes by Alexander for that he inueyed against the Meedes and Perseans who vsed suche flatterie that Alexander commaunded all men to call him the sonne of Iupiter
Euen so of Cicero and Demosthenes the one the soueraigne Orator and Phaenix of Rome, the onelye bulwarke of all Italie: the other the sugred Anker, the patron of Athens and protector of all Gréece: After they hadde sundrie and diuers times saued these two famous Cities, Rome and Athens the one from the pernicious coniurations and priuie conspiracie of that wicked Catelin and his adherentes, the other from the prowde attemptes and long warres of that most renowned warriour Phillip King of Macedonia yet were they after many vertuous actes done in their countries, and for their countries, from their countries quite banished and exiled.
Cicero for Clodius sake, Demosthenes for Harpalus which the Romans tooke so heauily, that twentie thousande ware mourning apparell with no lesse heauinesse in Rome, than teares for Demostenes in Athens

True seruice is often rewarded with anger and wrath of Princes, as Thrasibulus a noble captaine and famous, for his truth was banished out of Athens
Dion of Siracusa hunted out of his countrey by Dionisius euen that renowmed Hanibal the long protector of Carthage compelled after long seruice to range abrode like a pilgrime euery where to séeke some safegarde of his life: Too many examples might be brought of Gréeke and Latin histories for the proofe hereof.
The chéefest Ancker and the strongest bulwark of common wealth saith Demosthenes is assured faith without flattery, and good wyll tryed in the Commons, plainnesse without deceit, boldnesse and trust in the nobles.
Flattery is the only snare that wisemen are deceyued withall, and that the Pharisées knew well, when that they woulde take our Sauiour Christe tardie in his talke, they began to flatter him with faire wordes, saying: Maister, wée know that thou art iust and true, and that thou camest from God: Euen so Herode willyng to please the Iewes, in kyllyng Iames the brother of Iohn in prisoning Peter in pleasing the people with flatterie, that when Herode spake any flattering phrase, the people straight cryed out, saying: this is the voyce of God, and not the voyce of man: so swéete was flatterie amongst the Iewes.
The flattering frindes of Ammon knowing the wickednesse of his minde, and his peruerse dealing toward Mardocheus did not perswade Ammon from his tiranny, but flattered with fayre wordes, and made him prepare a huge Gallowes for Mardocheus where Ammon and hys children were hanged.
Likewise the young man that came to flatter king Dauid saying: Saul and his children are deade, was by Dauid for his flatterie commaunded to die.
Tertullius whe~ he was brought to dispute with Paul first he flattered Faelix the President of the Iewes, because with flatterie he thought to win the heartes of the hearers.
In fine, flatteres will as the false prophetes sometime that did perswade Achab king of Israell of great fame and luck in the warres to come: saye, they euen so will flatter their friendes of all good successe to come, and passe with silence the truth present.
PRide is the roote of all euill, the sinke of all sinne, the cause of all wickednesse, the auncient enemy to the seate of GOD, before man was made, it did attempt the angels.
The outwarde pompe and vaine ostentations of shiftyng shewes from tyme to tyme, from age to age maie be a suffient profe how prone, howe bent and howe willyng we bee to honour pride.
Eusebius doth reporte, that Domitianus the Emperour, by an order of lawe charged al men to call him Dominum Deum Domitianum That is, to name hym Lorde and GOD Domitian certenlie to heigh a stile though he was an Emperour to be called a God.
Likewise wee reade of a certen king in India named Sapor whiche would be called kyng of kynges, brother vnto the Sunne and Moone, felowe vnto the starres.
boke, entituled of diuers histories, doeth write of one Hanno borne in Carthage whiche was so proude, that he caught certen birdes, and kept theim in a darke place, where he often preuily resorted to teache theim to speake.
The birdes beyng brought vp daie and night, with one lesson after muche paine and trauaile taken, when the birds could speake, he did lette theim flie abroade euery where, to chirpe and bragge that proude lesson, whiche he taught them, which was this Deus est Hanno.
Hanno is a god, bee there not (suppose you) some of Domitianus courte that thinke that there is no God but themselues, bee there not some of king Sapors minde, that make them coequall to the Heauens, and farre superiour to the yerth whence thei came.
Are not diuers brought vp in the schole of Hannon which inuent diuers waies how they mighe séeme to bee otherwise then they are.
God graunt there bee not to manie like proude Suffenus flatteryng themselues in their owne follie, deliting too muche in their owne doinges, ensuryng themselues to be some ofspringes of Gods.
We reade in Iustine that Alexander would not be called the soonne of Philippe, perswaded with hym selfe, that sne God was his father, wherefore he went vnto Rhodes where the temple of Iupiter Ammon was, to knowe his progenie, where and when it was, by Oracle of Iupiter and false flatteryng Prelates of the Temple, he was saluted as a sonne vnto Iupiter which after he commaunded euerie man to call hym so, he waxed not proude herby him self, but corrupted diuers others, as Perdicca and Craterus triumphed in ostentations of vaine shewes.
The maner of pride is, to suffer no equalitie, for as Archestratus the Athenian was wonte to saie, that Athens was not able to suffer twoo Alcibiades so Ethocles the Lacedemonian did often vse to saie of Lisander that Sparta might not abide two Lisanders notyng the insolencie and pride of theym bothe, of Alcibiades in Athens and of Lisander in Sparta
Suche is the ambition of pride, that it coueteth superioritie ouer al, and suffereth coequality of none, as Diodorus in his second boke doeth reporte of Alexander the greate, who aunsweryng the Embassadours of king Darius entreating for peace, séekyng frendship and amitie of Alexander promisyng his doughter therefore in mariage with diuers large promises, said, as the heauens can not suffer two Sonnes to rule, so the yearth may not suffer two Alexanders this proude prince forgat that little sentence.
Ther was sometime a certen Phisition named Menecrates so glorious and so proude, that when he wrote any letter vnto kyng Agesilaus he vsed this stile, Menecrates soonne vnto greate Iupiter doeth salute thée Agesilaus kyng of Sparta

Likewise in Rome ther was (as Agrippa doeth witnesse, a scholemaister and gramarian named Palaemon and an other in Alexandria named Appius the one of suche arrogancie and pride, that he promised immortalitie and euerlastyng felicitie, vnto any that he dedicated anie booke of his, the other of suche glorie and self loue, that all learnyng (as hee supposed, had a beginnyng by hym, and shoulde haue an ende by hym likewise.
See the arrogancie of simple men, and marke the folly whiche foloweth pride, was it pride or folly in Empedocles the Philosopher, to mount the top of the high hill Aetna thinkyng he might thence with winges of pride ascende easely to the skeis to rule the heauens, and to gouerne the states of the starres: what pride had Milo in hymselfe: What glorie had Polidamas in his strength, the one supposyng he was able to plucke vp greate trees from the grounde, huge Okes from the rootes, the other thought hym strong inough to resist greate hilles, to withstande with his Souldiours, monstrous Ockes.
Suche is the fonde fancie of men, and selfe loue whiche some conceaue of them selues, that some are to proude with Palaemon in Gramer, some to heigh minded with Menecrates of phisik, some to glorious with Empedocles in philosophy, some to ignoraunt with Naestorius in diuinitie, some to bold with Polydamas of their strength In fine some menne are in any thing proude, for pride is often placed in a ragged cote, as in a Ueluet Gowne.
Therfore as Diogenes was wont to saie vnto Plato bicause hee wente braue in apparell, Calco fastum Platonis
Euen so Plato aunswered Diogenes for that he went ragged.

shift vsed of diuers, for who is more bould in some place, the~ blinde baiard, who speaketh more then he that knoweth least, who taketh more vpon hym in all thinges, then he that can least iudge of any thyng, Herodotus in his fourth boke, and Gellius in his sixtene, doe write of certen people called Psylli who are so foolishe, that they with weapons harnessed on horsbake, marche orderly in battaile arraie vnto the filde to fight with the Southerne wind, for that they thinke the Southerne winde to bee the onely cause of their losse and greate damages, and because it is hurtefull vnto their countrey, their landes, their beastes and their people, thei arme theim selues to requite the iniurie, in fielde with manhode.
The like is read of the people of Celta whiche likewise are so proude and hardie, that oftentimes thei drawe their sweardes and shake speares at the surging waues of Seas.
Ther is a kind of méere madnes in pride, as Chares whiche Plutarche writeth of, waxed so proud, bicause he hurted kyng Cirus in the knée, that for verie pride that he hurted suche a greate kyng, became starke madde, so glorious and so proude waxed this foolishe Chares of suche a chaunce.
Aiax Thelamonius a stoute and a valiaunt Gréeke, whiche bicause he might not haue the Harneis of Achilles beyng geuen before by Agamemnon vnto Vlixes at the siedge of Troie, waxed so madde thereby, for that hee thought no man worthy to weare them, but onely hee hymself, that he beate Blockes and Stones, he fought with greate trees cut doune their bowes and branches he killed heardes of beastes, supposing Vlixes to be amongest them, thinking to kill him and Agamemnon which was generall and chief prince ouer all the Gréekes, the one for that hee presumed to weare Achilles harneis, whiche was onely meete for him, the other for he gaue vnto others, whiche he ought to haue geuen vnto hym, and thus onely proceaded of selfe loue, whiche is the nourse of pride.
Diuers there be that be proude of their euill doynges as Chares was, and some as ignorant as Sparsus and some as mad as Aiax thin+kyng no man worthy of any thyng but themselues.
write as a Poet, meane as a christian, bouldnes and rashenes, ar hande maides of pride, for what is it but pride taketh in hande, selfe loue and arrogancie are chief Councellours vnto pride, the onely Nourshes whiche feede and maintaine Pride.
Howe bolde was Lucifer to presume through Pride, to sitte in the Sacred seate of GOD, to attempte his maiesties throne, though an Aungell greate, prouoked by Pride to bee a GOD: so ambicious his imppes are, to mounte vnto the seate of Princes.
How presumptuous sometyme the greate Giauntes were, to throwe mightie stones, and huge rockes vp to the heauens, to strike doune the Starres, and as thei thought, to moue Iupiter vnto warre.
So impudente are their dispersed broode, with wicked and violente dartes of Pride, against heauen and yearth? How rashe was Phaaeton to mounte the loftie skeis, attemptyng to rule the glorious Globe of mightie Phoebus
So arrogant some are to chalenge that by pride, which thei ought most to abhorre by reason.
Howe saucie was Icarus to enterprice beyonde his reache, to ascende through Pride aboue his father Dedalus and to mounte higher to the heauens, so false are thei, whiche beyonde their nature and arte, doe enterprise that, whiche their witte and reason can not comprehende.
How proude was Actaeon to prease in place, where sacred Diana was? How bolde Belleropho~ to ride on Pagasus? How madde was Perithus to attempte the moste daungerous and perillous riuers, Acheronta and Phlegeton yea, to passe vnto Erebus to steale Proserpina kyng Plutos wife awaie.
Some are by pride, that either to wickedly to winne, or to shamfully to lose, thei hasarde life.
But the prouerbe is true pride wil haue a fall.
Lucifer fell from the height of the heauens, vnto the verie bottome of helle, his Impes shall followe hym.
The Giauntes were destroied, and conquered by Iupiter their broude shalbe likewise vanquished, Phaaeton burned, Icarus drouned, Actaeon eaten of his one Dogges, Bellerophon brake his necke, Perithons deuoured of Cerberus, Milo slaine, Polidamas killed, Caesar murthered, Alexander poisoned, Hercules vanquished.
The frisselyng and frompelyng of heares, the paintyng and colouryng of faces, the staryng and roulyng of eyes, are outward shewes of immoderate pride, suche braggyng in gesture, suche countenaunce in lookyng, suche bearyng of bodie, that pride it self seemeth therein to soiourne.
Suche washyng in sweete waters, suche smellyng of sweete odours, suche desire to see, and to bee seen, to speake, and to be spoken vnto· that vnder the banner of Pride, thei triumphe and glorie.

That man or woman, saieth Euripides smell well when thei smel of nothing, but of inward cleanlinesse, and not of outward shewes, That manne, that woman saieth noble Thucidides is moste to be commended, that is neither praised, nor dispraised, the smell of pride is the worst sauour of stinch And here thinke good to recite a historie, whiche is written in the liues of the holie fathers, that an Angel kept co~panie with an Eremite, who passyng by a dead stinkyng carkase, the Eremite stopt his nose, to auoide the ill sauour and smell of the Carren, where at the Aungell smiled: little further thei passed by a faire garden, where satte a verie faire woman richly apparelled, bee decte with fragrante flowers, and sweete odours, in a grene harbour, with her Lute in her hande, where at the Anngell stopt his nose: The cause beyng demaunded, why he smelled not the stinkyng dead carren, and stopt his nose, at the sight of a verie faire woman: The Angell aunswered, that pride and vainglory doe stincke worse before the maiestie of God, then all Carrens of the world.
The pride of the Quéene Cleopatra that she had in hir draught of drinke vnto M. An+tonius

Diuers preferre themselues with arrogant Antigona before the Goddesse Iuno and diuers therebe that will set them selues with selfe loue with Lichione to go before the Goddesse Diana
In fine, the moste parte prone in comparisons with kyng Praetus doughters, to matche themselues with the learned Muses, but iustly rewarded were they, accordynge vnto their pride and presumption.

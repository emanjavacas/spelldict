to the reader
there has not been any point perhaps in the whole tract of english story either so dangerous to be mistaken in or so difficult and yet so necessary to be understood
as the mystery of this detestable plot now in agitation a iudgment for our sins augmented by our follies but the world is so miserably divided betwixt some that will believe every thing and others nothing that not only truth but christianity it self is almost lost between them and no place left for sobriety and moderation
we are come to govern our selves by dreams and imaginations we make every tale an article of our faith and from incredible fables we raise invincible arguments
a man must be fierce and violent to get the reputation of being as if the calling of one another damn'd heretique and popish dog were the whole sum of the controversie
and what's all this but the effect of a popular licence and appeal when every mercenary scribler shall take upon him to handle matters of faith and state give laws to princes and every mechanique sit iudge upon the government were not these the very circumstances of the late times when the religious iugglers from all quarters fell in with the rabble and managed them as it were by a certain fleight of hand the rods were turned into serpents on both sides and the multitude not able to say which was aaron and which the enchanter
let us have a care of the same incantation over again
are we not under the protection of a lawful authority nor was there ever any thing more narrowly sifted or more vigorously discouraged than this conspiracy
reformation is the proper business of government and council but when it comes to work once at the wrong end there is nothing to be expected from it but tumult and convulsion
a legal and effectual provision against the danger of romish practices and errours will never serve their turn whose quarrel is barely to the name of popery without understanding the thing it self
and if there were not a roman catholick left in the three kingdoms they would be never the better satisfied for where they cannot find popery they will make it nay and be troubled

too that they could not find it
it is no new thing for a popular in the matter of religion to have a in the belly of it
the first late clamor was against downright popery and then came on popishly affected that sweeps all the order of bishops and the discipline of the church took their turns next and the next blow was at the crown it self when every man was made a papist that would not play the knave and the fool for company with the common people
these things duly weighed and considering the ground of our present distempers the compiler of this abridgment reckoned that he could not do his countrymen a better office than by laying before them the naked state of things to give them at one view a prospect both of the subject matter of their apprehensions and of the vigilance zeal and needful severity of the government on their behalf
to which end he hath here drawn up an historical abstract of the whole matter of fact concerning those persons who have hitherto been tried for their lives either upon the plot it self or in relation to it opposing authentick records to wandring rumours and delivering the truth in all simplicity
he hath not omitted any one material point there is not so much as one partial stroke in it not a flourish nor any thing but a bare and plain collection without any tincture either of credulity or passion
and it is brought into so narrow a compass too that it will ease the readers head as well as his purse by clearing him of the puzzle of forms and interlocutories that serve only to amuse and mislead a man by breaking the order and confounding the relative part of the proceeding
having this in contemplation and being at the same time possest of a most exact summary of all passages here in question this reporter was only to cast an extract of these notes into a method especially finding that upon comparing the substance of his own papers with the most warrantable prints that have been published his own abstract proved to be not only every jot as correct but much more intelligible which being short and full he thought might be useful and find credit in the world upon its own account without need of a voucher

the history of the charge and defence of edward coleman esq the first of the conspirators that was brought to publick justice was mr edward coleman who received his trial at the kings novemb


and pleaded not guilty to the indictment
the jury consisted of persons of condition and known integrity being sworn without any exception or challenge from the prisoner
the general heads of his charge were the conspiring of the death of the king
the endeavour of subverting the government of england and the protestant religion
and these treasons and designs to be made out against him partly by witnesses viv√¢ voce and partly by letters and negotiations under his own hand proving a correspondence with several sorts of agents for the accomplishing of the aforesaid ends
the charge being read and the particulars of the matter in evidence modestly and learnedly opened by his majesties councel the prisoner past some reflections upon the hard measure of not allowing councel to a prisoner in this case recommending himself to the justice of the bench to be councel for him and representing the disadvantage of a roman catholicks appearing at the bar under so violent a prejudice he insisted further upon the ingenuity of his confessions in prison and it being objected to him as a thing incredible that he should break off his correspondences just at with the date of the last letters of his that were found his answer was that he never received any letters after that time but cursory intelligence which were either burnt or used as common paper and that he had offered all oaths and tests in the world for confirmation of the truth thereof and that they had seized every one of these letters of general correspondence for the two or three years last past that he knew of

hereupon the court proceeded to the evidence the lord chief justice previously inculcating the sacredness of an oath

and exhorting both the jury and witnesses to proceed with all due tenderness and caution for the life of a man was at stake and it was not intended that any thing should be put upon the stretch against the prisoner
the witness first called was mr oates and the first thing demanded of him was what he could say of the prisoner being any way privy to the design of murthering the king to which he gave evidence as follows that is to say

that in november last making a visit to mr iohn keyns his father confessor then lodging at mr colemans in mr coleman asked him who that was one says he that is going to st omers
then says mr coleman to the witness must trouble you with a letter or two and will leave them for you with fenwick the procurator of the society in london


on the monday following fenwick

gave mr oates the packet mr coleman had left in his hand and away goes he to dover with it
the outside sheet was a paper of news which past under the name of colemans letter and at the bottom of it these words pray recommend me to my kinsman playford who lived at that time in st omers
this letter was written in english at length and addressed to the rector of st omers giving him an account how matters went in england
the witness deposeth that he read this letter and in it many undutiful expressions concerning the king

and this in particular that the match of the lady mary with the prince of orange would prove that traytors and tyrants ruin

that there was also a letter in latin to la chaise

with a flying seal and no subscription and this letter with the letter of news and the postscript were all in a hand this was a letter of thanks to la chaise for which he confest to have received for the service of the catholick cause with a promise that it should be wholly imployed as it was designed and that no endeavour should be wanting to destroy the protestant religion root and branch
now this letter was in answer to one from la chaise dated in august which was directed to strange who at that time was provincial of the society for london but strange having hurt his hand with a reed and mico his secretary being sick mr coleman wrote this letter by direction of the provincial as the provincial told the deponent himself

that letter from la chaise to which this was an answer

the witness deposed that he saw and read and observed instructions in it to this effect
that the should be laid out to no other end than for the killing of the king
the witness did not see coleman write this letter but delivering it to la chaise himself la chaise named a gentleman with a french name and asked how he did the witness not well understanding him being at a loss one says la chaise that was formerly secretary to her royal highness whereupon mr oates in latin asked him if it were not coleman but what answer was made to this mr oates does not remember
la chaise answered his letter and the witness brought that answer to st omers from whence it was sent by the society under cover to mr coleman telling him in express terms that this letter was received and owned

the witness having a patent to be taken into the consult

had the sight of this letter at st omers and it was sent to mr coleman who acknowledged the receipt of it from la chaise and in the same hand that wrote the news letter which was agreed upon to be colemans hand
mr oates being demanded what he could say to the consultation here in may last and how far the prisoner was privy to the purpose of murthering the king he proceeded to this effect

by vertue of a brief from the father general of the society at rome the jesuits were appointed to have a meeting which begun at the in the strand

in april old stile and may new and continued there no longer then till they had concluded upon the dispatch of one father cary an agent and procurator for rome and

then they adjourned themselves into clubs and cabals some at wildhouse some at harcourts irelands fenwicks lodgings and came at length to this result
pickering and grove were to destroy the king either by shot

or otherwise and for their reward grove was to have fifteen hundred pounds and pickering being a religious person masses which may be valued an equivalent at twelve pence a mass
mr coleman in this deponents hearing was told of this determination at wildhouse and the witness affirms to have seen a letter under the prisoners own hand to one ireland expressing his desire that by some means or other the duke of york might be trapann'd into the plot
there was a to this letter recommend me to father la chaise
and besides all this the witness averrs that he heard coleman give his opinion at wildhouse that he thought it was well contrived

the next point was what the witness knew of any rebellion to have been raised in ireland

or of any practice designed upon the duke of ormond to which mr oates deposed

that in august there was a consultation at the savoy

with the iesuits and with the benedictines and a letter written from talbot the pretended archbishop of dublin making mention of one of the popes legates an italian bishop cassay as he believed that maintains the popes claim to the kingdom of ireland
and in this letter he speaks of four iesuits that were contriving the death of the duke of ormond and in case that design should not take place that then fogarthy should do it by poyson fogarthy himself being there at that time
that before the end of the consult mr coleman came in and earnestly prest the dispatch of fogarthy for ireland to do the work
the same letter did also say that they were ready to rise in ireland for the pope

the witness being asked if he knew any thing of arms gave evidence

that blank bills were provided to be sent into ireland
and that another letter from talbot of ianuary or february last said they were furnished by the popish and that they had them ready in ireland

that coleman fenwick and the witness being together in august last in fenwicks chamber in drury lane without any other company coleman told fenwick that he had a way now to transmit the

pounds for carrying on the rebellion in ireland which he said to this deponent also a week before so that mr coleman was privy to it and a prime actor in it

the witness was now examined about transmitting money to windsor

or persuading the sending of any thither and the time who deposed as follows

that dr fogarthy proposed and provided four irish ruffians to be sent to windsor

in august last and they were dispatched the same night
that the next day one william harcourt rector of london sent fourscore pounds to them in the name of the provincial who was then beyond the seas and by whose authority the other acted
that mr coleman told the witness that he had been to look for harcourt at his house in drury lane and was there directed to wildhouse where he sound him
and coleman asking what care was taken for the four gentlemen that went last night to windsor harcourt made answer that eighty pounds was ordered them and that the messenger was there that was to carry it
that the money was there upon the table most in guinnies and that mr coleman gave the messenger a guinny to make haste
and that mr oates never saw the messenger but that time

the witness was asked what he knew concerning mr colemans discourse with one ashby

whose evidence was that one ashby in iuly last and formerly rector of st omers being in london and ill of the gout was appointed to go to the bath that this ashby had certain instructions under the hand of white the provincial beyond the seas to authorise ashby and the consult of london to dispatch the king by poyson in case groves and pickering failed and to offer sir george wakeman to effect it taking the opportunity of giving his majesty physick that mr coleman attended this ashby that he saw read and copyed out the instructions and sent them over england to those that were privy to the plot that this deponent himself saw the reading and the transcribing of them mr coleman declaring the sum to be too little and that sir george wakeman would hardly undertake it upon those terms adding that it were well to give more to make the business sure and that this was said at at mr sandersons house and that upon mr colemans dispatch of these suffrages the word he used for instructions to the principal of the catholick gentry of england some thousands of pounds were collected and that coleman told the witness that he sent these copies about to quicken people in their contributions
the court demanded if mr coleman was not to have been one of the secretaries of state to which mr oates replyed thus

that in may last new stile april old soon after the consult at mr langhorns chamber among other commissions he saw one from the general of the society iohannes paulus d'oliva by vertue of the popes authority directed to mr coleman

and that this deponent saw it at mr fenwicks chamber in in the month of iuly mr fenwick being present and that mr coleman did then and there acknowledge the receipt of it open it and say that it was a good exchange for it made him secretary of state that upon the seal there was an undefined span alphabet with a cross and in english characters and that he knew this to be the writing of the said general for he had seen it forty times

that in the month ian the witness opened at st omers certain letters from rome directed to father harcourt he having power so to do wherein it was certified that the commissions were already in mr langhorns hands

which gave the witness a curiosity to ask mr langhorn about them
now the witness being summoned to be at the consult in april and appointed by the provincial to wait upon mr langhorn he did so and in discourse about the commissions asked him if he might not have a sight of them to which mr langhorn replyed that he had received the commissions and that he would not scruple to let him have a view of them the witness giving him that very day an account of the consult

the witness was asked if he were acquainted with langhorn

and he declared that meeting two of mr langhorns sons in spain and doing them some kindnesses upon the witnesses return out of spain mr langhorn received him with great civility at his house somewhere about but the wife being zealous another way mr langhorn advised the witness rather to come to him for the future at his chamber in the temple and that the witness was ordered by the provincial to give mr langhorn an account from time to time of all results at the white horse and wild house

being interrogated how many came over in april together with the witness

and how many priests and jesuits to his knowledg had been lately in england at one time he answered that there were nine jesuits as the rector of leige warren sir thomas preston the rector of watton francis williams sir iohn warner charges one poole a monk and the witness the ninth but for the number of the rest that he could not remember it and that to his knowledg there had been in england at the same time secular priests iesuits and by names upon a list above

the prisoner being now permitted to ask any questions

and speak for himself

mr coleman suggested

that upon his examination before the councel the witness told his majesty that he had never seen him before and yet now pretends to great intimacy and acquaintance with him

mr oates alledged that in truth he said his sight being had by that he would not swear that he had ever seen him before

but so soon as ever heard him speak he would have sworn him to be coleman

it being demanded

when the design upon the king at windsor was before the council how the witness came to omit mr colemans giving the guiny to the messenger the time when the fourscore pounds was sent the way of remitting the
the prisoner consulting and approving of the murther of the king and his saying that was too small a reward for sir george wakeman

mr oates his answer to all this

was that his business before the council was rather to exhibit an information than to deliver a charge and that it gives light to a prisoner how to shift when he knows the whole matter of his accusation beforehand and that besides he was so spent with waiting and watching that he could scarce stand upon his legs and that the king and council were sensible of it and willing to ease him but yet if he had been prest he should have enlarged his information
the witness being examined how long it was betwixt the time of his being interrogated and speaking only to the letters and that time of communicating to the houses of parliament the matter at present in question his answer was from monday the
of september until the parliament met

the witness was likewise asked why he did not inform sooner

and of all together mr coleman being so dangerous a person and engaged in so desperate a design why he did not name the jesuits he accused
and how he came to charge sir george wakeman by name and not mr coleman mr oates reply was that he had been a long time accusing other jesuites that he spake little but where the persons were face to face
that he had a list of the jesuits names but only such as were expresly charged were taken up and that being dosed with sitting up two nights he forgot mr coleman but upon consulting his papers he made upthe accompt which afterwards he delivered

the prisoner urged that the witness was just by him when he says he could not see him

and further that mr oates named three or four places where he says he met him about business the witness answering that the candle was in his eyes and that the prisoner stood more in the dark and to the rest that he wore several peruques at several meetings which much disguised him but that immediately upon speaking

he knew him to be coleman denying that the question was ever put to him whether he knew coleman or no

the prisoner still insisting upon it

that the witness did declare before the council that he did not know him sir thomas doleman and sir robert southwel being clerks of the council and at that time present were examined on the behalf of the prisoner sir tho dolemans evidence amounted to this that mr oates speaking of coleman did say before the council that he did not well know him and that he said these words after mr coleman was examined adding that the witness said he did not know him as he stood there
and speaking of coleman that he had no acquaintance with that man
it was asked mr oates in regard that he knew coleman upon hearing of his voice why he did not declare himself that he knew him so soon as he had heard him to which the witness answered that he was not asked

sir robert southwel

was now interrogated concerning mr oates his examination before the council and gave evidence that mr oates declared that pounds promised to sir george wakeman was now made fifteen and that mr coleman paid sir george wakeman five thousand pounds in hand
to which mr coleman replied that mr oates his charge was so slight that the council were not of his opinion as appeared by the mitigation of the first order which was at first to commit him to newgate but only now into the custody of a messenger
to this sir robert southwel gave an account how that mr oates examination was so general it could not well be fixed that mr colemans papers were found and seized on sunday night and that mr coleman rendred himself voluntarily at the house of sir ioseph williamson on monday morning hearing of a warrant out against him but so many other prisoners were upon examination that he was not called till afternoon when he seemed to hear these lewd things charged upon him with great scorn and indignation

the defence he made was such

that though a blank warrant was filled up to send him to newgate he was only for the present committed to a messenger and a special warrant granted to the messenger to secure him against the first order
upon his majesties departure the next day for newmarket a committee being appointed to examine several papers and mr colemans amongst others there were found in a deal box such papers as moved the lords forthwith to sign a warrant for his commitment to newgate

the sum of mr oates charge

was his traiterous correspondence with the french kings confessor the pounds accepted by him and five of it actually paid to sir george wakeman and the witnesses opinion that colemans papers would cost him his neck mr oates declaring that he had the stone and therefore could not be present at the consultation in the savoy but that he had an account of all things there from those that were upon the place
thus far mr oates his examination
mr bedlow sworn and examined

first

what he had seen or heard concerning any commission to mr coleman
secondly what discourse he ever had with mr coleman concerning that matter

mr bedlow

swears that he knew nothing of any commission to mr coleman more than that sir henry tichbourn told him that he brought him a commission from the principal jesuits at rome by order from his holiness and that he was to be secretary of state but that he never saw it nor knows the title of it
as to any discourse with mr coleman about it the witness declared that in april
father harcourt gave him a large pacquet of letters from mr coleman who in the witnesses sight delivered the said letters to father harcourt that they were directed to mr la chaise and other english monks to whom he delivered the letters and brought back an answer from la chaise and certain english monks at paris
mr bedlow furthur declares that there met at a consultation two french abbots and certain english monks and that he heard them talk of a plot upon the government and religion of england and that the king was to be destroyed in the first place and the lords of the council that this discourse passed upon the consultation and there was a pacquet of letters from mr coleman they not knowing that the witness understood french
that the pacquet from la chaise was directed to harcourt with one to coleman enclosed and addressed a monsieur monsieur coleman

mr bedlow being examined what he knew of money received by mr coleman how much and for what

gave this evidence
that it was to promote the subversion of the government of england to deliver it from hellish ignorance and to free catholicks from the tyranny of hereticks
the witness further declareth that being with harcourt at colemans may
or

harcourt delivered this deponent another pacquet which he had also from mr coleman for the english monks at paris and the witness to call at douay in his passage in case they were not gone for paris before him
that upon the receipt of these letters they applauded the merit of the service and that upon the consultation not having any full assurance what assistance the english catholicks might have from abroad they resolved to put their design in execution that very summer the english being in a great forwardness already
that the witness after the consultation gave le faire the letters and he carried them to harcourt and harcourt though indisposed went and carried them to coleman and this witness along with him but he stayed over the way while harcourt went in who soon after gave this witness a back to come over to him and then and there did this witness hear coleman say if he had a hundred lives he would lose them all to settle the catholick religion in england and depose or destroy a hundred heretical kings if they stood in his way
and this at his own house behind westminster abby¬∑ at the foot of the
here the prisoner demanded of bedlow if ever he had seen him in his life whose answer was that in the in summerset house coming from a consult there he had seen him

after this mr bradley

the messenger that seized mr colemans papers was examined what papers he seized what he saw and how he disposed of them
to which mr bradly rendred this account

that by warrant of council

dated september
at six at night for the apprehending of mr coleman and seizing of his papers he went accordingly and told mrs coleman his business who said he was welcom
and her husband not being at home he desired her to send for him
that upon the search he found a great many papers about the house and put them into several bags and looking into a private corner in his own chamber in a place behind the chimney he found a

deal box tacked together with a nail with letters in it which he delivered into the custody of one of his assistants to take care of it
and going then into his own study he searched his scritoire and put up all the papers he could find in bags without any other papers among them sealed them up with his own seal keeping them constantly in his sight and so carried every paper of them to the clerk of the council

sir robert southwel and sir thomas doleman were then examined

whether or no the papers then produced in court were the papers which were brought by mr bradley the messenger and first sir robert southwel concerning mr colemans long letter whose answer was that he had not seen that large letter in several days after the papers were brought to him from bradley remitting the account thereof to the other clerks of the council
sir thomas doleman in answer to the same question declared that he found it among mr colemans papers in a deal box that bradley brought

the next point was to prove both by his own confession

and by two witnesses that all the papers in question were of his own hand writing
whereupon mr boatman one that had waited upon him five years in his chamber was first examined who declared that he believed all the papers then shewed unto him to be of mr colemans writing acknowledging further that a pacquet of letters from beyond the seas was directed unto him two or three days after he was made a prisoner confessing also that he had received a letter for his master from la chaise but denying that ever he wrote any for his master to la chaise owning also that his master kept a large book of entries for his letters and news but that he knew not what was become of it and that he had not seen it since two days before his masters commitment
he declared likewise that he did usually receive news every post but could not say that any letters of the two years last past were entred in the aforesaid book
the prisoner here interposed that all his letters from the hague bruxels france and rome were before the council and that these were all he had received
one cattaway a kind of an amanuensis to him was then examined upon those papers who positively affirmed them to be of mr colemans writing

sir philip lloyd was produced next to prove the long letter

against him upon his own confession who gave evidence that he received the papers then shewed him from sir thomas doleman and that the long letter was owned by mr coleman to be his own

it bare date september

subscribed your most humble and most obedient servant without a name
and it was read by the clerk of the crown according to the order of the court but being too long to be brought into a breviate and the whole letter it self being little more than the deduction of a three years history of former negotiations for the greater part with mr ferrier the predecessor of la chaise it will suffice to give this brief of the whole money was the prisoners great design and the procuring of it by a pretence of more power both in the church and in the state than effectually he had is in short the drift of that large discourse
towards the end of it he has indeed this bold and dangerous passage our prevailing in these things would give the greatest blow to the protestant religion that ever it received since its birth

to this foregoing letter was produced an answer from la chaise

owning the receipt of it and giving mr coleman thanks for it concerning which letter sir robert southwel declared that he found it in mr colemans canvas bag the sunday after the papers were seized and that sir philip lloyd examined it
this letter was read in court by sir robert southwel first in french and then in english which being a very brief and pertinent proof of the correspondence in question we shall here insert according to the translation of it there exhibited
the letter

sir

paris octob



the letter which you gave yourself the trouble to write to me

came to my hands but the last night read it with great satisfaction and assure you that its length did not make it seem tedious
should be very glad on my part to assist in seconding your good intentions will consider of the means to effect it and when am better informed than am as yet will give you an account to the end may hold intelligence with you as you did with my predecessour
desire you to believe that will never fail as to my good will for the service of your master whom honor as much as he deserves and that it is with great truth that am

your most humble and most obedient servant

as it was the business of the prisoners long letter abovementioned

first to procure mony and then by his interest as he phansied to himself to work a dissolution of the parliament so in case of attaining that end mr coleman had by him the draught of a declaration as from his majesty shewing the reasons of that dissolution promising before the end of the next february to call another parliament charging all persons to forbear talking irreverently of the proceedings and offering to the discoverer of any seditious talker against it unto a principal secretary of state

this is in short the substance of that voluminous declaration and he did not make more bold with his majesty in this contrivance out of his own head then he did in another letter of mr la chaise in the name of his master the duke of york

not only without the order and privity of the duke but incurring his very great displeasure upon the very mention of his project as he himself confessed before a committee of the house of lords that discoursed with him in newgate to which point sir philip lloyd deposed the truth of what is here asserted he himself being then appointed to attend the said committee

the letter itself was read consisting most of complement to the french interest

and of such imaginations as might give mr coleman some credit and authority in his future undertakings

there was another letter produced

which was also to la chaise and without date it is too long to be here inserted and the pinch of the letter lying in a very narrow compass we shall only give you so much of it as may be sufficient for our present purpose

we have a mighty work upon our hands

says he no less than the conversion of three kingdoms and by that perhaps the utter subduing of a pestilent heresie which has domineer'd over a great part of this northern world a long time there never were such hopes of success since the death of our queen mary as now in our days
and again it imports us to get all the aid and assistance we can for the harvest is great and the labourers but few

this letter was acknowledged by coleman to be of his own writing as attested by sir thomas dolman and sir philip lloyd from mr colemans own lips

there were read also divers other letters of the prisoner and one especially of august
to the popes internuncio at bruxelles where he owns the design to be the utter ruin of the protestant party but these were never thought fit for the press

the prisoner did here crave the leave of the court to ask mr oates some questions

who having been withdrawn to rest himself was called again it being also offered by the court that mr coleman might speak with mr bedlow also but he did not desire it

here the prisoner demanded the particular days of the months where the consult was held

who were present at it to which mr oates made answer that it was within two or three days of the consult in may new stile and april old which began at the and was afterwards adjourned to several companies that there were present at it the provincial mico strange and keins and that the prisoner came to the provincials chamber two or three days after the consult
as to that at the savoy in august old stile the witness would not charge his memory with the particular day and touching the consult in may that mr coleman was not present at it but two or three days after it approved at of the resolutions before taken

the prisoner here suggests that he was fourscore miles off

in upon the
of august old stile and so for two or three and twenty days before solemnly imprecating himself that he never saw mr oates his face but in the council chamber and now in the court and that he never saw mr bedlow but now in the court in his whole life

mr coleman did also endeavour to evade the danger of two witnesses

by alledging that they did not both of them swear the self same fact which was overruled by shewing that the general fact of killing the king was sworn to by both though not the particular manner either of pistol or poyson

the prisoner laboured likewise to extenuate the malice of his expressions

by calling them only extravagant and to expound himself by saying that by the words aid and assistance was intended only mony and not violence and finding that all this did not avail him he offered proof that he was in at the time sworn that he was in london which being allowed him boatman

was called again whose testimony was only this that in august last mr coleman was in all august to the best of his remembrance but he could not say what time of the month the prisoner was in london and gave no positive answer
when he was asked if coleman was in and no where else the prisoner affirmed that he had been at the lord denbys and mr francis fishers at least twenty days and so concluded with these very words positively say and upon my salvation never saw these witnesses oats but once and bedlow never before

the kings council then sum'd up the evidence the prisoner offerd the same things over again and his servant was examined

as to the time of his masters going out of town and of his return but could not speak certainly to the day

so that the lord chief justice proceeded to his charge to the jury whereupon the prisoner was found guilty

of the high treason whereof he stood indicted and remanded to the prison with order to bring him again the next morning to receive his sentence
the prisoner repeating what he had said before concerning the two witnesses

mr coleman being brought again the next day november to the bar first prayed favour for his papers and then offered a book to prove him out of town

from august to the
late at night referring himself also for the truth thereof to some papers and books of accompts which were then under seisure alledging also the improbability of speaking in company of killing the king desiring the benefit upon the whole matter of the act of grace but his offence being since the last act of pardon

and his other pretensions being found to be of no weight the lord chief justice after a grave and pertinent speech pronounced sentence upon the prisoner to be drawn hang'd and quartered according to the usual form

after sentence past

the prisoner denyed the making or receiving the knowing or hearing either directly or indirectly of any propositions for the destroying of the king the subverting of the government or the bringing in of popery by violence or by the help of any forrein power
he declared upon his salvation that he had given the house of commons a true accompt of all his books papers and correspondences and so desiring and obtaining leave for his wife and some immediate friends to come to him he was carried back to newgate

upon the tuesday following the sentence was executed upon him

at tyburn where he thanked god that he dyed a catholick renouncing upon the word of a dying man any knowledg of the murther of sir godfrey and so was turned off
the history of the charge and defence of william ireland thomas pickering and iohn grove
on the
of december

that whitebread issued a second summons

which was received april
whereupon nine appeared at london the rector of liege sir thomas preston marsh the rector of ghent williams the rector of watton sir iohn harper and from st omers two or three more who were all under a caution to lie close for fear of discovering the design

that the first consult april

the secretary to the society did the same day draw up this following result

and iohn grove shall proceed upon their attempt upon the person of the king and that groves reward shall be and pickerings masses

that this resolution was first signed by whitebread

and then by ireland and fenwick and likewise by all the four clubs at the meetings beforementioned the witness carrying the instrument from one to another and seeing them sign it whitebread ireland and fenwick signing it at that part of the consult which past at their respective chambers the witness being still present
that in may mr whitebread went to st omers upon his provincial visitation and with him cary and mico cary going from thence to rome

that whitebread having rendred an accompt of the state of the catholicks proceedings in england what monies collected what party made and engaged what means used to promote the design he ordered the witness to come over into england and to murther dr tongue for publishing a book called the iesuits morals who left st omers iune

that the witness coming in a coach with fenwick and other passengers for london

the coach being searched some six miles on this side canterbury they found a box full of beads crucifixes images and directed to richard blundel esq that these things being seized as prohibited goods mr fenwick said that if they had searched him they might have found letters in his pocket would have cost him his life that fenwick passed by the name of thompson near the fountain tavern at to which place he ordered the searchers to write to him

that coming to london iune
after a few days

one ashby came thither sick of the gout and was advised to go to the bath for his cure
this ashby had been rector at st omers and dr oates declareth that he brought these following instructions from whitebread
first the offer of to sir george wakeman for making away the king
secondly the bishop of hereford to be murthered
thirdly dr stillingfleet
fourthly that not withstanding the offer to sir george wakeman pickering and grove might go on nevertheless
that copies of these instructions were dispersed among the conspirators and that sir george wakeman not accepting of
whitebread gave order for the making of it which was profered and accepted as appeared upon their books of entries and by a letter from whitebread expressing much satisfaction upon the agreement of it being paid down in hand by coleman or his order

that in august one fogarthy since dead was at a consultation of the iesuits with the benedictines where fenwick and one harcourt were both present
that at this consult fogarthy recommended four ruffians

for the attempt which the consultors accepted and they were also approved of by fenwick
that these ruffians were dispatched away and the next day was sent them most of it gold coleman giving the messenger a guiny to make hast

that in august whitebread gave advice of what he had done about the scotch business ordering harcourt rector of london to send moore and sanders alias brown down into scotland whither they were accordingly sent from london august
in the name of the provincial

the witness swears further that moore and sanders were imployed to promote

the design of raising a rebellion there which fenwick and ireland had projected sending down people under the disguise of presbyterian ministers to put the scots into a tumult by setting forth the sad condition of living under an episcopal tyranny

the witness deposeth also that they had determined to dispose not only of the king

but also of the duke too unless they found him to use their own words vigorous in promoting the catholick religion
dr oates was here examined if he knew the prisoners at the bar and ordered to call them by their names and likewise examined what he knew of pickering and groves acceptance of the conditions whereupon he named them all

and concerning pickering and grove

dr oates declared that he himself was present at mr whitebreads lodgings when they accepted of the conditions but that the consult was over before grove came thither and that then he took the sacrament and an oath of secrecy upon it and so agreed to it and that a iesuite by the name of barton delivered the sacrament

hereupon mr whitebread interposed

that whereas the witness says that in april and may he was present at such and such consults there were hundreds could prove that dr oates was all that time at st omers the prisoner desiring to know at what time he himself received that sacrament to which dr oates testified that he received it at the same time the
of april the prisoner taking god to witness he was not there

dr oates was then examined about the time that mr cary was sent to rome and upon what business to which dr oates answered that april
it was resolved that cary should be sent and that in may or iune cary was brought over by whitebread to st omers secretary mico with him and that then cary took his journy receiving at paris for his expences

dr oates being asked what he knew of any design upon the person of the king in st iames park

declared as followeth that he saw grove and pickering divers times together in the park with screw'd guns betwixt pistols and carbines and that they had silver bullets which the witness himself saw in the possession of grove and in the months of may and iune and that grove told the witness that he would champ his bullets that the wound might not be cured upon this mr whitebread suggested that the witness was at that time actually at st omers
but dr oates averred that he saw grove bullets twice or thrice in may and iune and pickerings in august
the witness was now questioned what he knew of pickerings penance and what was his offence who gave evidence

that in march last pickering slipt a fair opportunity as whitebread told him for his flint was loose and he durst not strike for fear of missing fire and that for this neglect he had twenty or thirty strokes and grove was censur'd too for looking not better after it
that he had seen and read this in letters from whitebread whose hand he knew very well

the witness was then ordered to speak to the business of the ruffians

that were sent to windsor and how they succeeded to which dr oates could say little in regard that at the beginning of september last one bedingfield had written to whitebread that the plot was discovered and that none but such a one could do it calling the witness

by his borrowed name
that this deponent coming to speak with the provincial at his chamber sept
the provincial there shewed and read bedingfields letter to the witness reproching striking and abusing him and charging him with a discovery of the matter to the king and asking him with what face he could come to him thus after he had betray'd him
that the witness was not only reviled and commanded to depart the kingdom but was assalted in his lodging by whitebread and others who would have killed him if they could

dr oates was called upon next to speak to the fourscore pounds who gave this evidence

that he himself saw the mony at harcourts chamber in near the arch and that it was given by william harcourt but for the four irish men that were sent to windsor that he never saw them or knew their names or the name of the messenger that carried it but that the mony was paid by coleman and fenwick present at the payment of it to which fenwick demanding when this was and where dr oates replyed that it was in august and in harcourts chamber fenwick denying that ever he saw dr oates there in his whole life

dr oates being examined who signed the resolution concerning grove and pickering

declared that there were at least forty that signed it and the five prisoners amongst the rest and that the witness carried it from one to another and saw the signing of it having been an attendant upon them ever since the chiefly at mr whitebreads the provincials chamber where it was first signed
that mico drew up the resolution at whitebreads chamber and all the prisoners privy to it that when the whole consultation had signed it and mass was ready to be said grove and pickering did sign it before mass and approved of it at the provincials where they all met that day to receive the sacrament which was delivered in a little chappel at

as to the oath of secrecy

dr oates gives evidence that he saw whitebread administer it to all that were there mico holding the book a but what the form of the oath was dr oates could not say

mr whitebread reasons the matter

that he was in a very doubtful state of health and that he would be loth to leave the world with a lye in his mouth how much easier it is to assert an affirmative than to prove a negative and declaring before almighty god that the witness had not spoken three words of truth

dr oates then called to mind that mr whitebread was authorized to grant military commissions

and informed that the seals of the office were in the court with which the provincial had sealed some hundreds
that some of them past the seal in the time of the former provincial that the commissions of the general officers were sealed by iohannes paulus de oliva the general of the order but that the seals for inferior commissions were in the hands of the provincial
that he had sealed one to sir iohn gage which was delivered unto him by this witness who received it from mr ashby but by whitebreads appointment as appeared by a memorial which the witness saw and read

that whitebread when he went over lost several commissions with blanks

and one ready sealed which was delivered in his absence unto this witness
and that the intent of arming was to rise upon the murther of his majesty ireland and scotland being already prepared to incourage an invasion

dr oates offered somthing here concerning grove

informing that he went about with one smith to gather peterpence either to advance their design or to send them to rome mr grove faintly denying any acquaintance with the witness whereupon mr oates informed the court that in december last going to take his leave of the then provincial before the witness going to st omers he met there with mr grove who appointed to come next morning to his lodging and lent the witness eight shillings for the hire of the coach by which token it appears that they were acquainted as well as by other circumstances and by one very particular when as the witness informeth groves told him that he and three irishmen had fired southwark and that they had for their pains grove and the other a piece

upon the courts examining mr fenwick if he knew dr oates

mr fenwick owned that he did and remembred it by divers circumstances but insisted upon it that dr oates was at st omers upon april the
which was the time when dr oates affirms that he brought the resolve of the consultation to the prisoners chamber and that for the month of may dr oates stirred not from st omers all that month for the proof whereof mr fenwick offered a testimony under the seal of the colledg and signed by the magistrates of the town
to all which the court gave a very favourable hearing and offered time to make out a proof
but the evidence propounded not being according to law the prisoner in this point was overruled

dr oates on the other side

affirms that in december or november he went to st omers stayed there all ianuary february march and part of april came over to the consult of the
and went back again presently after it was over
that father warner sir tho preston father williams sir iohn warner one nevil came over with him and further that a lad from st omers being discharged the house and having lost his mony williams supplyed him towards his going home as he remembers his name was hilsley and that they came up to london together

that the witness lay at groves

and there was a gentleman and strange the late provincial that lay there besides but that the witness was charged to keep himself very close groves in the mean time denying that oates ever lay in his house and confessing that strange did but not in either april or may

mr whitebreads reply upon dr oates was

that williams and hilsley did come up to town together and that dr oates knew of it but that he was not with them nor could he be with them for he had no orders
the court did here very tenderly advise the prisoners to bethink themselves as a very material point if they could make it out that dr oates was not in england in april or may

mr bedlow was now called and sworn and then examined what he knew of any plot to kill the king

and by whom who rendred this account

that he had been near five years a carrier of letters betwixt england and france

for the society and the english monks in paris
that the first letter he carried was from mr harcourt who sent for him over being then a lieutenant in flanders about michaelmass last was four years

that the witness visiting the english nunnery at dunkirk was kindly treated by the lady abbess

who entertained him six weeks in the convent and afterwards recommended him to sir iohn warner as a person fit to be intrusted either with letters or any thing else against england that after a fortnights stay sir iohn warner sent him to father harcourts the next spring he sent him with several letters into england and mr harcourt gave him several dispatches from thence to morton and doway and other places

that in
he carried a packet to the monks at paris

which they communicated to the other english monks in france to whom it was directed with a letter in it to la chaise from harcourt prichard and cary
that upon the receipt of this packet there past a consultation betwixt la chaise some monks and a french bishop or two by whom mention was made as stapleton an english monk told the witness of a letter from the lord bellasis and other catholicks in the plot shewing in what condition affairs stood in england
that from the english monks at paris the witness was sent with a packet addressed to mr vaughan of courtfield in monmouthshire
that mr bedlow went from thence to pontois and carried other letters from thence into england which he opened and found to be only prayers for the success of the design and an earnest intreaty not to fail meeting at the consult

that may

the witness carried over an other packet

and delivered some letters to the english nuns at bruges and ghent
that coming to doway the monks sheldon stapilton and latham being gone the witness hastened after them and overtook them at cambray that the intent of these letters was to give notice of what had passed in a consult at about the destroying the protestant religion that there was great joy in cambray at the news and at paris the witness was informed that the lord bellasis blamed them for not keeping touch with england stapleton telling the witness that neither my lord nor the society in england had any reason to blame them for they had their men

mony and armies in readiness upon any occasion from thence the witness was dispatcht into spain to an irish father whom he overtook at la mora and from thence he went to salamanca and st iago and so came back into england and landed at milford¬∑ haven

that the witness passed thence to london

and delivered the letter to mr harcourt that he did not look into the contents of it but knew that it tended to the same purpose with the rest and to the advancing of the plot
that he was afterwards sent by harcourt and coleman with letters to some papists in england

that in the beginning of august last there was a close consult at mr harcourts

as this witness was informed by pritchard
that it was a plot upon the kings life and that pickering and grove had been long about it but that for fear of failing there were four ruffians to be imployed that would do it at windsor and that the next day mr coleman would inform the witness of the success
that pritchard told him further that some being sent to windsor mr coleman was following them having given a guiny to the menssenger that carried them their mony
and moreover that the witness demanded why they kept him so long a stranger to the design they answered him that it was the societies resolve and the lord bellasis order that none but those of the society and the actors in the conspiracy should be made privy to it

that about the latter end of august

as he believes the witness coming to harcourts chamber found ireland there pritchard pickering and grove
that their discourse was that since the ruffians could not dispatch the king pickering and grove should take in conyers and try if they could snap him in his morning walk at newmarket
that they were all of them eager upon it and especially grove who said that if it could not be done by surprize it must be openly and that at the worst it would be an honourable miscarriage and that in spight of all discoveries the party was yet strong enough to bring it about

the witness swears also

that fogarthy and harcourt were there and that ireland grove pickering and the rest heard all this
that harcourt promised the witness a considerable reward grove to have if he came off and to be the favourite of the church pickering to have as many masses at twelve pence a piece as would come to that mony
ireland denies that ever he saw bedlow before that time in the court

and bade him produce a witness if he could that he had ever spoken to him

mr bedlow was examined what he could say of the rest and his answer was

that he charged only those three that as to whitebread that he had heard he was deep in the plot but did not know it and only knew him by sight but that whitebread and fenwick had been at many consultations

mr bedlow came now to speak to groves agreement

and the
his evidence was that grove was to put it into a friends hand but he knew not his name nor the certain time of their agreement
ireland

affirms that he was not in london the whole month of august and offers to prove by twenty witnesses that he was in staffordshire from one end of the month to the other and desires that mr bedlow would name the place and the company where ever they were together

mr bedlow

replyed that he did not pretend to a familiarity with him but that he had seen him often and particularly at le fairs at in company with several other priests and jesuites upon irelands bidding him name one mr bedlow named segnior perrare suppose says ireland if perrare may be brought hither at which words dispute concerned in the business
the reader may here take notice that the printed tryal has this passage in it page
mr bedlow askes mr ireland
do you know le faire and parrare to which ireland replies yes but never saw you in their company in in my life but once or twice yes says mr bedlow you have twice at le faires

here is a contradiction in the one part

and an incongruity in the other which neither finding in my own notes nor any notice taken of it in the court the reader is left to judg if it may not be some slip in the press

mr bedlow gave evidence also of his seeing mr fenwick say mass at and of another plot

discoursed of upon the lives of certain noble persons knight to kill the earl of shaftsbury pritchard the duke of buckingham neale the earl of ossory and obrian the duke of ormond

dr oates

informs the court of a consult he had forgotten where there was a plot laid to kill the duke of ormond and raise a rebellion in ireland declaring that in ianuary last fenwick ireland and whitebread had the perusal of some letters from talbot sent to london which they communicated to the society at st omers
the letters speaking to this effect that the catholicks stood fair to do their business in ireland
and the witness also swears that he saw a letter under covert signed by whitebread ireland fenwick of thanksgiving for their hopes in ireland and declaring withal that no stone should be left unturned for the extirpation of that abominable heresie out of that kingdom

that fenwick

about the
of august a little before his going to st omers to bring home the provincial was at a consult and did there consent to a design upon the duke of ormonds life and the moving of a rebellion after his death and likewise approve of the four iesuites that were to do the work and of sending fogarthy over to talbot in case the four iesuites should not do their business
and also that mr whitebread agreed to it at his coming over as may appear by his books of entry for a letter from mr whitebread dated as from st omers about the latter end of august and taxed at but two pence made this witness suspect that it was written nearer hand in that letter whitebread approved of the design upon the duke and the witness swears that it was signed with his own hand informing the court that the said result might be found in the book wherein all the consults are registred

mr iames bedlow

being sworn declareth that he did not know ireland that he had heard of pickering and grove and could say nothing to the conspiracy against the king but he had heard his brother talk of the priests and jesuites as people that he knew and that many of them visited his brother
that he had fetched many sums from them for his brother as or at a time as he had proved to the duke of monmouth the lord chancellor and lord treasurer from the persons that paid the mony
mr iames bedlow being examined what he had heard his brother say concerning mr ireland and how long he had known him made answer that he had heard his brother speak of him but where or in what place he could not tell
mr ireland urged that mr bedlow made mention of one place some three years since and that it was at paris and that if he talked of him so long he must have known him so long whereupon the question being put to mr bedlow how long he had known mr ireland mr bedlow made answer that he had only known him since august last but that a man might talk of people that he never saw in his life
mr william bedlow with his brother did not withdraw and dr oates speaking to the summoning of a consult did aver that he heard mr whitebread ask mr peters if he had summoned the consult as he directed him and that mr peters answered him yes and that he had written into and about it
there was now a letter produced from mr peters a prisoner about this plot sir tho doleman declaring in court that he found it amongst harcourts papers the hand being likewise sworn by dr oates to be mr peters hand which letter as it follows was read in the court

tertio pro domino solovo disco

am straitned for time that can only assure you shall be much glad of obliging you any ways
sir your servant edward petre
pray my service where due
mr whitebread declared that he knew nothing at all of this letter and mr ireland that it was none of his letter and that he had not heard of it before in particular
upon this matter sir thomas doleman informed the court that dr oates gave an account of this consult to his majesty and council four or five days before this letter was found

the seals were now produced in court

dr oates affirming them to have been seized in the provincials chamber and mr whitebread confessing as much

the jury were now dischaged of mr fenwick and mr whitebread

upon a tenderness of not screwing up any evidence to an over rigorous construction so that they were taken from the bar to attend the event of a farther discovery
the prisoners being now called upon to make their defence with an assurance that their witnesses should be fairly heard and a free ingress and regress allow'd them without trouble mr ireland came on first alledging

that there were not tow witnesses against him

for he could not be at harcourts chamber in august being that whole month out of town that he went into staffordshire august
in company with the lord aston his lady and his son sir iohn southcot and his lady and that mr iohn aston can witness for him he being in staffordshire all august
mr aston was then called but did not appear mr ireland complaining that he had not liberty to send a note to any body but it appeared that his sister was free to solicit his business

upon irelands denyal of his being in town in august sarah pain whom grove owned to have been formerly his servant was sworn who gave this evidence that she knew mr ireland and that she saw him at his own house about a week after the kings going to windsor who went about the
of august so that about the
she saw him and it was at a scriveners in
that she knew him very well for he came often to mr groves and opened all the packets of letters which her master delivered afterwards and sealed those that went beyond seas

there was then called ann ireland

on the behalf of the prisoner who informed that august
mr ireland set out for staffordshire and continued there till about a fortnight before michaelmas
upon mr irelands denying that he knew sarah pain she minded him of her bringing him divers letters that came by the carriers as well as by the post to which mr ireland replyed that it might very well be so and yet he not remember it

mr irelands mother eleanor ireland was then called

who declared that he went and returned as was informed by the daughter and that she and her daughter lay in the same house with him all the time whereupon it was objected that he might go from the house and come again as is suggested and yet be in london in the mean time

dr oates declared that he was with mr ireland in london

to take his leave of him betwixt the
and
and that he saw him afterward within the month of august at mr fenwicks chamber and further that upon the first or second of september he himself had of him in town which mr ireland said was a most false lie he being then in staffordshire and he minded them of a contradiction in the witnesses the one speaking of him as going to st omers the
and the other charging him with being at harcourts chamber at the end of the month which was solved thus that he might be going or pretending to go and yet not go

there was next produced one harrison

the coachman that carried him down who informed that he met the prisoner mr ireland aug
in the evening at the bull inn in st albans and travelled with him till the
that he knew not whether he came from london that day or not and that he had never seen him before
that he was a servant to sir iohn southcot who married the sister of the lord aston and that he carried the prisoner to tixal the lord astons house that after three or four days stay at tixal he went to nantwich and so to westchester where he left him and that he was now called up to town by a messenger the night before

mr ireland gives this account of his passage

that aug
he went out of london to standen where he lodged that night and the next and on the
went to st albans going out of his way for sir iohn southcot and his ladies company who he knew were to meet the lord aston and his lady at st albans and being asked how he could prove himself to be that whole month in staffordshire when yet it appears that he was in westchester mr ireland made answer that he was in staffordshire and thereabouts and that he was at wolverhampton

he desired mr charles gifford might be called to bear him witness who gave testimony that from a day or two after st bartholomew he continued there till the
of september and could say no more

mr ireland then reflected upon the credit of dr oates testimony

having been told that he broke prison at dover and other ill things of him so that he offered it as reasonable that some witnesses might be brought to attesst his reputation desiring time to produce more witnesses having witnesses already to prove that there are more and naming hilsley for one that would prove that when dr oates said he came over with him dr oates was all that time at st omers but says ireland no man can answer to a charge he was not aware of

sir denny ashburnham being solicited to appear

and testifie what he could say concerning dr oates was now called and he informed that upon a letter received that morning with the copy of an indictment of perjury against dr oates from the town of hastings for which he served he sent them to mr atturney but it being only a certificate and the indictment not proceeded upon and no warrantable evidence and neither for nor against the prisoners it was not thought worth a reading
sir denny ashburnham information was that he had known dr oates from a child and that in his youth he was lookt upon to be a person not much to be confided in that being the night before importuned by the sister of mr ireland to give evidence for the prisoner he refused so to do declaring that he could not speak any thing to his advantage for though perhaps having known dr oates in youth he might have suspended in his belief upon dr oates his single testimony yet finding it so seconded he was clearly convinced and satisfied with the truth of the thing and he declared farther that he could say nothing to take off dr oates evidence
that the matter of the indictment in question was only dr oates swearing the peace against a man and saying that there were witnesses could prove such a fact which they would not do when they were called

mr ireland pleaded the loyalty of himself

and family his relations plundered an unkle killed in the kings service the pendrels and the giffords that preserved the king after his defeat at worcester and so only desiring time for more witnesses he remitted himself to the court

mr groves said little more than that dr oates never lay at his house

and that he never saw him take the sacrament at wildhouse as he could prove if he were able to send for witnesses his sister declaring that she never saw dr oates there at her brothers house dr oates deposing that he was there in a disguise and by another name
the prisoner concluding all with these words
as have a soul to save know nothing of this matter charged upon me

mr pickering affirms that he never shot off a pistol in his life

that he never saw dr oates that he knew of offers to swear that he never was in mr bedlows company urges that his father was slain on the kings side and pleads that he had no time to summons his witnesses

after the lord chief justice had given his directions to the jury which were exact and impartial together with some learned reflections upon the errors of the church of rome the jury went out to consider of their verdict

and in a short time came in again and returned the three prisoners severally guilty of the high treason whereof they stood indicted and so the court adjourned till four in the afternoon when meeting again according to their adjournment mr recorder after a grave and weighty discourse upon that occasion pronounced sentence upon the prisoners according to the usual form in such cases which sentence was accordingly executed upon ireland and grove ianuary
at the common place of execution pickering being reprieved till may

when he likewise suffered death according to his sentence
the history of the charge and defence of tho whitebread will
harcourt john fenwick john gavan and anthony turner
there were tried by an oyer and terminer at the at old bayly iune

five jesuits and priests that is to say tho white alias whitebread provincial of the society in england will
harcourt rectour of london iohn fenwick procurator for the society iohn gavan and anthony turner upon an indictment of high treason for a conspiracy against the life of the king the overturning of the government and the destruction of the protestant religion
there was also a sixth brought to the barr one iames corker but upon his petition to the court for longer time in regard that he had not sufficient notice for the producing of his witnesses and the preparing of his defences he was for the present set aside

the indictment being read

mr whitebread represented to the court that having been tri'd on the
of december last upon the same indictment the jury impannell'd and the evidence found insufficient that was brought in against him and the jury discharged without verdict he was informed that no man could be tried and have his life put in jeopardy twice for the same cause and therefore made it his suit that he might have counsell to direct him upon that point in the matter of law
he pressed that his life was in jeopardy being deliver'd over in charge to the jury and cited sayer case eliz
who having pleaded to a former indictment for a burglary was indicted a second time the judges declaring that he could not be indicted again for the same fact
he desired a sight of the record and to be informed whether or no being come upon his trial a man ought not to be either condemned or acquitted
upon which motion and proposal it was opened unto him

that the jury being discharg'd of him

his life was in no danger and that the jury being sworn to make true deliverance of the prisoners in their charge their charge is not full till the last charge of the court after evidence
and farther that their plea was not to be supported without a record and moreover that there was no record of december
concerning them for there was no verdict because there was no trial nor was it the same indictment but contained new matter
upon which mr whitebread submitted himself to the court

mr fenwick offered the same plea with mr whitebread

inlarging himself upon it that they two were in the fame danger with the other three that suffered for if mr bedlow who declared he could say nothing against them had given the same evidence as against the rest they should have been likewise condemned so that the evidence falling short he supposed that they ought to have been discharged

the court proceeded now upon the prisoners

who did all plead not guilty and the jury being called they did unanimously except without naming them to all those persons that had served before as in the same cause

when the king's counsell had opened the indictment

mr oates was the first witness called and sworn who giving the court to understand

that he should have occasion for several witnesses which he desired might be called in mr gavan objected against it for fear of giving them instructions so that mr oates giving in their names a note was taken of them and they were sent for to be in readiness upon occasion and then mr oates came to his evidence declaring

that mr whitebread was made provincial december last was

and ordered conyers to preach this doctrine in the english seminary upon thomas of becket day that the oaths of allegeance and supremacy were antichristian heretical and devillish which was done accordingly

and that whitebread wrote letters in ianuary

or february to omers of what talbot had written to him about the state of ireland which was that thousands would be in readiness to rise when the blow was given signifying by the word blow as was usual among them the murther of the king
farther declaring that this expression was in whitebread letter and that he said for the blow he hoped it would not be long first

that in ianuary whitebread sent two jesuits to see how things were in ireland

of whose return in april whitebread delivered an accompt mentioning a consult appointed in april old stile may new where there met whitebread fenwick harcourt and turner who did all of them sign the resolve whitebread at fenwick in harcourt in
that the consult began at the tavern in the strand where cary was made procurator to be sent to rome after this they adjourned into small meeting at whitebread chamber ireland harcourt fenwick
the witness durst not charge mr gavan with this point

that the resolve signed as aforesaid

was¬∑ that pickering and grovo should proceed to dispatch the king as a good expedient
and that after this consult the witness and or more returned to omers and in iune whitebread went over to flanders being provincial to look to his charge where upon discourse with some of the fathers he had this expression that he hoped to see whitehall laid fast enough and that if the brother should appear to follow in his footsteps his passport should be made too

that iune
old stile the witness came for england by order

took boat at calais on the
and on the
betimes in the morning he landed at dover where mr fenwick was with some students that he was sending over
that fenwick the witness and some others took coach baited at canterbury and when they came six miles farther there was a box taken by the searchers directed to the honourable richard blundell esq at london and brought up by mr fenwick
it was full of beads crucifixes and the like and fenwick desired the searchers to send it with a letter for mr thompson so he called himself to the fountain tavern near charing cross
he swears farther that fenwick said if they had searched his pockets as they did his box it might have cost him his life for he had letters there about the concern in hand
that he came to london about noon iune
old stile and that in iuly one ashby or rather thimbleby and fenwick brought over instructions from whitebread

for the offering sir george wakeman li to poyson his majesty and for the filling up of a blank commission for sir iohn gage to be an officer in the army and that by fenwick own order the witness gave it one sunday into sir iohn own hand the commission being filled at by whitebread order but signed and sealed by whitebread who ordered ashby in iuly while he was at omers to have it filled up which order

the witness saw and knew the hand
that there were present at the filling of it up mr harcourt mr ashby and mr ireland and that fenwick and harcourt did counsell ashby upon his leaving of the bath

whither he went about the latter end of iuly to take his circuit in somersetshire and possess the people there with the matter not doubting but the gentleman at whitehall would be dispatch'd before he came back

as to mr gavan

mr oates declares that seeing him in the lobby disguis'd in a periwigg and one enquiring if he knew him the witness did not then well know him in that dress and so gave no information against him at that time not conceiving the mystery of it knowing him to have a very good head of hair of his own

that mr gavan

in iuly
informed the fathers at london how things went in staffordshire and shropshire and how industrious father ewers was to order matters in those countries
the letter did not say from what place neither did the witness at first know the hand but afterwards he did as he shall make appear and it was iuly or august that the witness saw mr gavan at mr ireland chamber
mr gavan here interposed upon his salvation that he was as innocent as a child unborn which gave the court occasion to forbid the interrupting of the evidence

mr oates declared likewise

that meeting gavan at ireland chamber he gave ireland the same account of staffordshire and shropshire as he had before in his letter and for the proof of his hand the witness saw him draw a bill for payment of money to some little priest which was the same writing with that letter
that gavan talked of two or three thousand pounds that would be ready thereabouts for the design

that betwixt august
and
ireland took leave of the witness

and others at his own chamber as if he were going to omers and that he leaving the town fenwick in the other's absence executed the place of treasurer and procurator
that august
fenwick harcourt keins and blundell were together at and li before them

the greater part in guinneys which was for those that were to kill the king at windsor and that the matter being agreed coleman came and gave the messenger a guinny to quicken him in his dispatch
that from they removed to harcourt chamber for the papers that were to goe to windsor and that there the messenger received his money

that a day or two after this fenwick and harcourt being at a consult at the benedictines he had fresh news out of ireland from talbot of a design upon the life of the duke of ormond he enquiring how things stood in england and desiring commissions and money for advancing the design
that fenwick sent commissions as he told this witness to chester by an express but concerning the letters by the post the witness speaks his own knowledge
that mr fenwick delivered this witness some money for necessary expences charging him to get some masses said for the success of the undertaking
that august
after noon he saw fenwick at his chamber he being next day to depart for omers with or students after which time the witness never saw him more till he was in custody

that the first or second of september

a letter coming from mr whitebread that was charged but two pence and yet passed for a forrein letter the witness concluded that mr whitebread lay close somewhere in england
that september
the witness went at night to visit mr whitebread but could not speak with him because he was at supper but that next morning he gave the witness ill language and blows asking him how he could look him in the face having done so falsly by him
and that

the witness asking him what injury he had done him his answer was that the witness had discovered the business upon this mistake that the person to whom the witness had communicated his information by dr tongue went to his majesty in the cloaths that the witness wore and mr whitebread having received a description of his cloaths concluded it to be the witness

that the witness having countenanced the matter as well as he could to mr whitebread

he shewed the witness a letter from bedingfield informing that the design had taken air and that if the five letters sent to windsor and intercepted had not made the rest look like a counterfeit all had been spoil'd

that the witness having pacified mr whitebread

he offer'd to be friends with him upon condition he would tell him the person and the minister that went with him
mr oates declared this to be all he had to say to the prisoner at the barr saving onely that upon sir george wakeman refusing to poyson the king for li
mr whitebread advised the adding of five thousand pounds more and exceedingly rejoyced to find it accepted
concerning mr turner and his being present at the consult in april and signing the resolve of murthering the king mr oates has something to say

as to mr gavan

mr oates swears that he was summoned to the consult of april
but cannot swear he was there but onely that he saw his name to the resolve which was all one with the letter about staffordshire the witness still declaring that he never saw gavan write any thing but the aforesaid bill of exchange

that whitebread fenwick harcourt and turner were there and that the mony was raised for furthering the design of destroying the king and government
that gavan wrote a letter to mr ireland which he received by the hands of grove for the taking up of mony declaring farther that that letter was received by grove

and delivered to ireland giving an account of the affairs of staffordshire as is before related and that this account was given in london the beginning or middle of iuly when mr ashby was in town

here gavan alledged that mr oates said but even now

that it was in the latter end of iuly upon which mr oates moved that the witness might be examined by the court and not by the prisoners that would put things upon the evidence which they never said

after this the prisoners put several questions to the witness
whitebread ask'd him how long he had known him before the april consult
mr oates answered that he never saw his face before
mr whitebread demanded how he was to be employed and what recompence
mr oates told him that when he left omers he was to wait upon the fathers at mr whitebread chamber and to carry the result from place to place where respectively they met

to fenwick questions if mr oates was at the tavern if he din'd there how long he stayed in town who came over with him and their names mr oates made answer that he was at the white horse that he did not dine there

that his stay in england was under twenty days and that he could not punctually remember who they were that came over with him it was so long since
whereupon mr fenwick told the witness that he need not charge his memory for he had them in his narrative
mr oates upon this naming divers of them as father williams the rector of watton the rectour of liege sir iohn warner sir thomas preston

mr whitebread asked the witness

if mr nevil and sir robert brett were there he having said so in his narrative
mr oates answered that he believed that they were there
mr fenwick offered mr oates narrative as an evidence upon oath being sworn before a justice of the peace insisting upon it that his evidence in court ought to agree with his narrative
but he was answered that they were to proceed according to law which would not admit a pamphlet in evidence

mr gavan demanded of mr oates whether it were in august or july that mr oates saw him what time of the month and whether before mr ashby went to the bath or not
to which mr oates replied that it was towards the middle or latter end of iuly that he saw the prisoner in town ashby being then also in town and gavan telling the witness that he would go see him the witness declaring particularly that about ashby came to town stayed not above a fortnight designing for the bath and that at this time it was that gavan communicated the subject of that letter
gavan demanded of the witness

in which of the two weeks it was ashby staying but a fortnight that mr oates saw him in town
the prisoner expounding to the court the intent of that question that he might endeavour to disprove it either in the one week or in the other
but mr oates could not charge his memory with the precise week

mr gavan put it then to mr oates how often he had seen him in london
whose answer was onely one day but two several times that day as he remembered by the token that an apothecary brought mr gavan a cordiall in the afternoon to mr ireland chamber he being then and there indisposed
that the apothecary was called walpoole but that the witness could not say whether it was he himself that brought it or his servant
mr gavan brake out here into this expression do as truely believe that there is a god a heaven and a hell as any one here does
as hope for salvation as hope to see god in heaven never saw mr oates before that day in january when he says had the periwigg on and he did not know me
and as for july call god to witness never saw him then
vpon my salvation was not in london

liberty being allowed to the prisoners to ask any questions in their own defence

mr turner asked mr oates if whitehall was not the first place that ever he saw him in when he told the prisoner that he went by another name
mr oates told him that in that disguise and beastly periwigg he did not so well call him to mind and that he did not consider names but he was the man
he saw him at the consult where there were or in the meeting
that he could not say he saw him at the white horse but at mr fenwick chamber he did
turner laid hold of that and minded him that at whitehall he said it was at which mr oates explained

by telling the court that in regard the greatest business was done at they called all consults the consults of

mr dugdale being sworn

was examined what he could say of whitebread and harcourt but to begin with whitebread
he declared that he had seen whitebread some two or three years agoe with the old lady aston at tixall having no great acquaintance with him
but that in a letter from mr groves to mr ewers he saw one of mr whitebread inclosed cautioning ewers to chuse men that were hardy and desperate or to that purpose and no matter for their being gentlemen
that he came to know mr whitebread hand by looking upon him as he was writing a letter at tixal which he gave him to convey
that his name was to the

letter

and that it was so like the hand which the witness saw him write that he might almost positively swear it was the same
that he came to the sight of this letter by intercepting it and reading it and that he saw it at tixall all letters coming to mr ewers under cover from mr groves being directed to the witness the said mr ewers being a iesuite and the witnesse's confessour

mr dugdale swears farther

that he was engaged in the plot upon the life of the king by gavan and divers others
that at mr ewers chamber this witnesse at boscobel and elsewhere there were divers consultations about the death of the king and bringing in of popery wherein mr gavan was a great man having a good tongue and the faculty of moving the people and the witness believeth that mr ireland was then in the country

that at tixall there was one meeting about september last

where my lord stafford was present mr peters mr leveson mr ewers and many more mr gavan among the rest and the meeting was to advise upon the design of change of religion and taking off the king
that this was sept

but that the witness hath heard it spoken of two years agoe
that upon this occasion the witness was by mr harcourt chosen to be disposed of at london under the government of mr parsons
that ewers and gavan were the first that brake this business to the witness mr gavan often perswading and incouraging him to it
the court appearing to be much affected with this evidence laid great weight upon it as a thing wholly new to them
upon which expression gavan made an exclamation in these words tis so to me too upon my soul for upon my conscience never heard of it before bidding the witness look upon him with confidence if he could
mr dugdale presently desiring mr gavan to inform the court whether he ever had the witness under his tuition or no or knew any ill thing by him gavan acknowledged that he had been acquainted with mr dugdale living within miles of tixall and conversing with the family and that he knew mr ewers very well but never was in his chamber
dugdale proceeded that some of the discourse already given in evidence was in the little parlour and some in mr ewers chamber
and for a farther argument of friendship betwixt them that this witness gave them li to pray for his soul

and to set forward this design and promised them li more upon their complaint that they should want mony mr gavan assuring the witness that he should be canonized for what he had done

mr dugdale swears farther

that in his hearing they talked as if they look'd for forces from abroad and that mr gavan said that though they were in great troubles themselves they would yet have men and mony enough to spare for such a design
and then as to a massacre the witness swears that he hath heard it talk'd at several consultations
but they were first advised by a letter from paris that passed through harcourt hands to make the death of the king to be a presbyterian plot and in case of his miscarriage to engage the protestants in a revenge upon the presbyterian party as guilty of the fact and after that to go on to a massacre and those that scap'd it to be afterwards cut off by an army

the witness saith moreover

that mr gavan hath many times endeavoured to perswade him of the lawfulness if not the merit of killing any body for the advancement of their religion giving reasons for it out of scripture and instancing in the example of garnet and the miracles wrought by his reliques

he declareth farther

that he hath seen several treasonable letters from beyond seas striking at the life of the king and the protestant religion

which this witness hath intercepted and read at least of them which were sent from harcourt to ewers under a cover from groves

the witness says farther

that the first intelligence they had in the country of the death of sir edmundbury godfry was from harcourt that it came to ewers on the monday and bore date on the saturday that he was murthered
that the intelligence was in these words this very night sir edmundbury godfry is dispatch'd
it was not said by whom he was murthered but that he was killed and they knew by whom
upon the sight of harcourt or harrison letters which were usually sign'd with which stands for both this witness went the next day to an alehouse hard by and ask'd if they heard any thing of a knight thas was murthered at london and that he had an evidence in court for the truth of what he deliver'd

mr dugdale was demanded a farther account of whitebread letters to ewers

who said that he particularly remembred one but could not say how many he had seen
mr harcourt then asking the witness the date of the last letter the witness had received from him mr dugdale answered that as he remembred it was that concerning the death of sir edmundbury godfry in october and then harcourt affirmed that he had not written to him this year and half
mr dugdale now applying himself to the prisoner minded him that upon mr ireland being last year in the country the prisoner was used to send the omers letters to mr ireland and so they were dispatch'd down to my lord aston
that the witness had the sight of eight of those letters by the token that he pretended to conjure in telling the death of mr edward aston before it was known to any of his relations which the witness came to understand upon reading two of these letters
that mr ireland took it ill that he heard it no sooner and the prisoner wrote him word of the sending these letters

mr harcourt opposed

that mr dugdale but five weeks since owned before a committee of parliament that he did not know him and came also to the gatehouse to entrap him before the gent of the committee but he denieth that he hath written to him for several years and the writing of any such letter as he mentions or that he ever approved of putting any man to death informing that the gent for desired the prisoner to write his own hand and name and three of them also wrote their names and he could not say which was the prisoner's who does not disown all this while that he hath often writ to ewers and address'd to dugdale

mr chetwin was now sworn to speak to a discourse that past betwixt him and mr dugdale the last summer

what it was and at what time who gave this evidence
that being in staffordshire in a family which mr sanbridge my lord aston kinsman much frequented the gent coming to him in october last askt him if he heard any thing of a westminster iustice that was killed
the witness told him that he heard nothing of it
was told says mr sanbridge by a girl of the house this morning at elds that mr dugdale had reported such a thing there
this was upon tuesday morning and the saturday following the witness received an account at litchfield that sir edmundbury was murthered
upon mr dugdale coming to town this witness with some others went to him before his examination the witness asking him what he could say about that gentleman's death who made answer that he remembred a letter from father harcourt to father ewers with these words in it this night sir edmundbury godfry is dispatched
that this witness being out of town when the murtherers were tried upon his return to london enquired

if dugdale was there and finding that he was not the witness past this reflection upon it that there was lost a very material witness

mr dugdale informs

that whitebread charged ewers in his letter to take none but stout desperate fellows and that they were to kill the king to take away the king's life in those very words as the witness remembreth
that these letters were sent by the ordinary post and it being wondred at that any man would venture such words in a letter the witness made answer that he was to have been an actour and that they directed their letters to him that if they were discovered he should be hanged and they come off
the witness declaring that he had been dealt with before by the lord stafford and mr ewers to kill the king
mr whitebread demanding of him whether he intercepted and read them himself and the witness replying that he did so whereof mr whitebread desired the jury to take notice

mr dugdale was then examined concerning mr turner and fenwick

who informs that he had seen turner ewers and leveson with others together at mr ewers chamber at tixall and in other places about two years since and that he had heard them discourse and agree upon the whole design and that this witness had heard from ewers that turner was to manage the plot in worcestershire but that for fenwick the witness cannot say that ever he saw him before
turner on the other side did own that he had been or times in his whole life at tixall but not so much as in staffordshire for these four last years

mr prance sworn and examined

who informs that harcourt told him about a year agoe as he was paying him for an image of our lady that there was a plot upon the life of the king
and that mr ireland mr fenwick and mr grove at mr ireland chamber were saying that there would be men in readiness to set up the catholick religion and mr fenwick told him that my lords bellasis powis and arundel should command them and that grove afterwards told the witness the aforesaid lords had commissions to give places
the witness deposeth farther that asking mr fenwick what would become of if we should come to have wars he bad the witness never fear want of trade for there would be enough for images crucifixes and the like
that the witness going to mr fenwick chamber after father iames his ghostly father was dead mr fenwick would have had the witness come to confession to him
this was about a week before michaelmas last
mr fenwick denying all the witness minded him of a table for the altar that was brought him at the same time
mr harcourt asking the witness if ever he had discoursed with him about any such matter mr prance affirmed that he had and that he paid the witness for some candlesticks one thompson being in his company
harcourt owning that he knew thompson and bought such candlesticks of him

mr bedlow sworn

who informs the court that he declined the giving of full evidence against whitebread and fenwick for fear of disappointing a design he had then afoot being at that time treating with reading about mr whitebread and mr fenwick as well as the lords in the tower appealing to some of the justices upon the bench for the truth thereof and referring to his apology at that time in the court for keeping himself upon a reserve
mr whitebread asking him thereupon if he said any such thing at the last trial

mr bedlow chargeth it upon mr whitebread

that he gave mr coleman an account of sending the four to windsor and that he saw harcourt take out some or li which mony he paid upon coleman order

and gave the messenger a guinny from mr coleman to drink his health as harcourt told this witness coleman being gone before he came in

touching the reward of pickering and grove

that grove was to have fifteen hundred pound with an assurance of the good will of the lords and pickering as many masses as at twelve pence a piece would amount to that summe this allotment being made at harcourt chamber where the witness heard it from whitebread pritchard le faire and keins
that the reward was for killing the king
pickering having been disciplin'd for his neglects one while the flint's loose then no powder in the pan and another time laden onely with bullets and no powder
that he had seen fenwick at harcourt and whitebread chambers when the thing was discoursed of and that they all agreed upon it

that he saw whitebread at harcourt chamber onely twice harcourt himself was there once and pritchard and le faire with others at another time where they discoursed of sir george wakeman sticking at the li and so made it up li
that the business of the consult was first to advise upon their manner of doing it and then what aftercourse to take if they fail'd
mr ireland propounding the taking off the king at his at newmarket fenwick and conyers to be employed and three or four more as the witness was inform'd
that the witness knew nothing of turner but by hearsay
nor of gavan more then that he had heard he was an actour in the plot

as to mr harcourt that he was very well acquainted with the witnesse's practice of bringing pacquets and portmantles

from beyond sea having brought over several for himself
harcourt replied that the witness never brought him but one pacquet and never any portmantle and that he never saw him more then twice before that time in the court and once before the councill
mr bedlow informed the court that he had got to have proved this but the putting off the trials so from time to time had disappointed him of his witnesses
proceeding that he had brought the prisoner letters from watton omers bruges paris valladolid and salamanca

all of them concerning the plot of changing the religion of england and overturning the government what men and moneys in readiness both at home and abroad and what more expected the contributions and accounts mostly in mr harcourt hands the witness having carried several papers from harcourt to langhorne concerning this matter
mr whitebread now with leave of the court ask'd if mr bedlow was a lieutenant in flanders or not and whether of horse or foot
the witness replied that he was a lieutenant of foot in the of frieseland regiment
upon which mr whitebread replied that the flanders companies had no such officers but onely captains and alfarez
so mr bedlow sent for his commission to clear it

mr harcourt pleaded

that some five years since mr bedlow brought him a pacquet from dunkirk and that upon the opening of it the prisoner found the letters enclosed addressed to other persons to whom he sent them the outside cover being onely directed to him
this was the first time the prisoner ever saw him and the second was when he came afterwards to his chamber lamenting his condition that he was newly turn'd catholick and had lost his friends when the prisoner lent him upon his promise of repaying it but never saw him after till lately at the privy councill
this was about four years since
mr bedlow affirmed that he had ten pounds of the prisoner for the sending for but he could not properly produce his witnesses before the trial of the lords and that he might honestly speak a hundred times more of mr harcourt

the witness saith farther

that the consult which he carried to omers he had from mr coleman to whom mr harcourt went with him and in that consult was the main of the design and that he was also presented by mr harcourt to the lord arundell who promised him great matters when the times were come about
harcourt interjecting that he spake not one true word mr bedlow demanded of the prisoner if in august or september last he was not in company with le faire or le fevre
to which mr harcourt said he knew no le faire but le fevre he did and believes that he saw him then but never since
and the witness went on that pritchard recommended him to him as a person tri'd and trusty and fit to be taken into the privacy of the design pritchard declaring to the witness in their presence that the death of the king was one part of it
and the witness says farther that going another time from pritchard to harcourt he saw harcourt give sir george wakeman a bill of exchange upon some citizen for li keins and sir william anderson being present

which bill sir george wakeman read folded up and went and received the mony
and that mr harcourt told sir george wakeman upon delivering the bill that that li was in part of a greater summe
sir george wakeman replying upon it that li was but a small consideration for the of religion and the saving of three kingdoms
harcourt desired he might name the citizen upon whom it was drawn for it would then be found upon the merchant's book
fenwick urg'd that it was not enough to averr that he saw a bill of exchange if he cannot say from whom it came and to whom it was directed
but the court found that to be of little moment mr bedlow himself not being concerned in the bill
mr bedlow's commission for lieutenant was read
sir thomas doleman was now sworn concerning a letter produced in court who delivered that it was found about a week after that dr oates had inform'd the councill of the plot in a bag of mr harcourt's papers which sir thomas was appointed to examine
and then the letter it self was read

honoured dear sir

have but time to convey these following particulars to you

first am to give you notice that it hath seem'd fitting to our mr consult prov to fix the
of april next stilo veteri for the meeting at london of our congregation on which day all those that have a suffrage are to be present there that they may be ready to give a beginning to the same on the
which is the next day after george day
you are warned to have jus suffragii and therefore if your occasions should not permit you to be present you are to signify as much to the end others in their ranks be ordered to supply your absence
every one is minded also not to hasten to london long before the time appointed nor to appear much about the town till the meeting be over lest occasion should be given to suspect the design
finally secrecy as to the time and place is much recommended to all those that receive summons as it will appear of its own nature necessary
tertio pro domino solone disco benefact
prov
luniensis
am streightned for time that can onely assure you shall be much glad of obliging you any ways

sir your servant edward petre

mr harcourt being called upon to explain this letter

informed the court that this letter was written to one that had a vote in the meeting which by the order of the society is to assemble once in three years and advise about their particular affairs that the chief business was about the choice of a procurator to be dispatch'd to rome wherein secrecy was requisite because it was dangerous to have it known
as to the caution of not hastening before the time or being too publick for fear the design should be suspected wherein secrecy was naturally necessary mr whitebread expounded it that the design was the getting of a congregation which it was prudential to keep secret as a thing not permitted in this nation declaring upon his salvation that there was no other reason for the enjoyning of that secrecy offering farther that it would be very hard to take away mens lives upon a word that may as well bear one construction as another instancing in the usual way of speech have a design to dine here or there tomorrow where the word design is properly enough made use of
it was returned upon them that the word design with a caution of privacy and the business being matter of secrecy in its own nature must necessarily imply something of greater consequence then the election of an officer

mr gavan in reply offer'd his exposition

that the jesuits in all places meeting once in years for the inspection of their officers and the regulation of their members this was their time for their meeting here applying the word design to the great concernment of both worlds which was the subject matter of this meeting declaring upon his salvation that though he was not at this consult himself yet he believed that which he had delivered was the true and onely cause of their meeting adding hereunto that it being in time of the parliament sitting secrecy was necessary that they might not give offence and that it concerned them not to be taken notice of when their lives depended upon the discovery
that the design was the design of a congregation
dr oates objected that though they justify the consult now yet when there was but one proof of it they denied at first that there was any such consult
at which fenwick disown'd the denial of it

mr bedlow declared that whereas mr gavan says that their desire of secrecy was out of a respect to the parliament

he and others had been employed to bring more jesuits into england in then in any other for that they were then in least danger
dr oates adding that they were more bold and publick in the lobbies and court of requests in sessions of parliament and not forbearing to threaten the protestants
another letter was now produced and sir thomas doleman called to speak to't who declared that he found it some two days after that which was read before among mr harcourt papers and that reflecting upon dr oates information to the councill concerning commissions given out and some ambiguous passages in the letter he the witness presented it to the councill with theis quaere upon it enqu
what is meant by the word patents it was signed christopher anderton hilton febr

oates representing that by hilton was meant rome which harcourt acknowledged
the letter it self was now read

worthy sir

know not from whence it proceeds

but perceive that both your letters and mine have bad fortune by the way for my correspondents with you complain they hear not from me whereas write constantly intire pacquets and since the bills received from your self for sir william goring and for mr ireland from mr shelly have not had one letter but what received this week which in part made recompence for the former for it brought me three of yours and one of mr ireland for which render you many humble thanks and acknowledge the fifteen pounds from my lord castlemain though mr ireland made no mention of it in his
we are all here very glad of the promotion of mr thomas harcourt
when writ that the patents were sent although guess for whom they were yet know not for certain because our patrons do not use to discover things or resolutions till they know they have effect
and therefore in these kind of matters dare not be too hasty lest some will say a fool's bolt is soon shot

there arose a great difficulty upon the plurality of the word patents

mr whitebread expounded it to be meant of his patent for provinciall which being but one would not have been called patents
which mr whitebread qualified by making it a latinism and called it literae patentes
it was objected that he being made provincial ianuary
and this bearing date feb
the word patents could not be intended of his commission
to which whitebread answers that possibly they did not know till then and that it was not known what exceptions might be exhibited against the person named besides that every patent is called literae patentes
dr oates affirmed that if a man be chosen to a place he must execute it upon pain of damnation if he disobey his superiour
to which mr whitebread replied that a hundred instances might be given of refusalls in the case and that he would have refused it himself if he had foreseen the trouble of it appealing to almighty god as he was to answer at the last day that he knew nothing at all of this business
dr oates declared that the patents spoken of in this letter were sent a great many of them in april and may before
the prisoners being now called to their defence dr oates witnesses were sent for to be in readiness

mr whitebread beginning

that though he did not fear death he would be loth to die by injustice and that he hop'd that he should be allow'd the common freedome of endeavouring to preserve himself for that a man's life might be taken away by perjury as well as by a pistoll so that he trusted that no man should be admitted as an evidence against him that was not probus testis offering that oates was not such a man and he craved leave to say that he was perjured
he says that he did such and such things by whitebread appointment was present with him april
and that the prisoner acquainted dr oates with the whole design a thing so improbable that whoever believes it must take the prisoner for a to trust any body with such a concern at first sight for he confesseth that so it was and then to trust a man that had his livelyhood from the society for they maintain'd him that is to say first the prisoner's predecessor and then himself
upon his importunity to be entertain'd in the society the prisoner perswaded him to withdraw reflecting upon him as a person not answerable to the purpose he pretended to and that for severall reasons
first for his principles for he held severall opinions that were not sound
secondly his life was loose and therefore he was desired to retire
to which end he had a suit of cloaths given him a periwigg and li in his pocket which

he promised to repay upon the fale of his library in london but he never did
the prisoner took notice of the just wonder of the court at writing to dugdale by the post in so plain and dangerous terms and the like in his discourse to dr oates but concluded in craving the court's leave to produce witnesses that from the
of decem to the
of iune following dr oates was at omers and lodg'd but one night out of the house
it was observed upon mr whitebread as a strange thing that they should still maintain a man that they had so ill an opinion of but mr whitebread denied the maintaining of him affirming that he was not sent over by them as he said he was and undertaking to prove it allowing all this while that they had maintained him before and distinguishing betwixt an office of charity to a man of letters and in necessity and a confidence of intrigueing with him in such a case as this

mr fenwick then recommended it to the court to consider

that dr oates evidence from one end to the other was supported by the sight of such and such letters from one person or another and all the testimony is the sight of the letters as if fenwick that knew dr oates was turn'd away from omers for his misdemeanors should after that make him privy to all his letters
the prisoner desired the court to take notice that he had a thousand letters taken from him and not one syllable either of treason or of solliciting people to come over was charged upon him out of those letters
urging that all the proof made was but saying and swearing and defying any man to make out any probability to any unbyassed judgement how this could possibly be
here the prisoners were minded that there is no other evidence to be given then by saying and swearing
fenwick pursued his discourse declaring that he did no more think of his being taken or accused then of his death and that he removed nothing and that besides letters there were seized in bonds and bills to the value of five or six thousand pounds and it seems strange that out of all this there should nothing of a design appear
for god's sake said the prisoner where are the commissions sign'd and the moneys paid

mr hilsley being presented to the court as a witness on the behalf of the prisoners

mr whitebread begs that their witnesses might be sworn which though it would not be granted because it was against the king yet the jury were directed to value the testimony according to the credit of the persons and the matter in question
mr gavan offered that there was no positive law and the lord coke in his institutes says that there is not so much as scintilla iuris against it
but this being against constant usage and custome it could not be granted

mr whitebread shews

that in mr ireland triall pag and dr oates declares that he came from omers with sir iohn warner father williams and mr hilsley but it was answered that printed trialls are no evidence there may be errata's in them
then mr fenwick asked dr oates if he did not acknowledge that he came over with hilsley

and dr oates told him that to any question of that day if the court thought it reasonable he would give an answer
fenwick insisted upon it that dr oates was forsworn in affirming he did but not being convict that could not be prest so that fenwick offered to prove his affirmation by witnesses that heard it asking dr oates again if he came over with hilsley

to which dr oates made answer that to put them out of their pain as he said then so he said now that one hilsley did come over with him
to which hilsley answered that he did not for he left him at omers
dr oates acknowledged that hilsley left him at omers but that he came away a day after him and overtook him at calais
hilsley denied it saying

there were a great many there that could prove the contrary
dr oates informed the court that hilsley lost his mony at calais and that he prevailed with father williams to relieve him
hilsley confess'd the loss of his mony but utterly denied that ever dr oates and he were in a ship together
dr oates urged that he might be examined if he were not in orders but it was not thought reasonable to press him to accuse himself
hilsley offers witnesses to make out that dr oates was in omers the day after hilsley came out

and several weeks after
dr oates swears that hilsley left them upon the way and did not come throughout with them to london
hilsley says that he believes dr oates was told of his losing his mony by one that was with him the second of may and that there was one in court who he supposed could speak to't

mr william parry offered then to swear

that dr oates was at omers upon that day when he affirms he came over that is that he was there upon the that he stirr'd not from thence that day that the evidence din'd with him and he went into the infirmary for he was sick that he was at omers till after the
of iune by the token that he was there at a play upon the
day
dr oates denied the business of the infirmary and offered to make appear to the court that hilsley had been several years of the sodality of the iesuits and that they dare not but say what their superiours bid them

as to the
of iune dr oates averrs that he was at omers at that action

but affirms that he was then come back again from london
parry on the other side denied that dr oates ever went out of the colledge for that he constantly din'd and supp'd with him saving or days when he was in the infirmary where he entred april the
old stile
dr oates advertised the court of a contradiction in the prisoner's evidence upon the difference between old stile and new

mr parry affirms that dr oates came to omers in december

and went not out from the colledge till the end of iune and that onely to watton for two days and a night and that he is confident of what he says for a scholar never removes from thence to england but tis the talk of the whole colledge
and then says mr gavan they goe away in secular garments that no notice may be taken of their leaving the place
dr oates admitted this as a general rule but that his case was a particular exception to that rule and that he resum'd the habit of the house upon his coming back to london and appear'd as one of it still not knowing that it was taken notice of that he had been out having never shewed himself in the colledge in a
mr whitebread followed it that let his cloaths be what they would his place and seniority was the same so that at meals he was visible to the whole house

there stood up for the prisoners one mr doddington

another witness that passed at omers by the name of hollis betwixt and years of age who gave this account of dr oates that he entred the colledge about a fortnight before christmas and betwixt that and iune was never out but one night at watton
that he saw him at least every other day and in particular the day after hilsley departed which was april
new stile and falling sick he went the next day into the infirmary affirming that he saw him in the garden upon the
of may with one blood or burnaby
this witness came into england in april last about two months since in part upon the proclamation for recalling such as were in seminaries and partly for want of health

mr gifford was next examined

who declared that he came from omers about a month before and that the occasion of his coming was to justify

that dr oates was at omers when he said he was here
he affirmed that he saw him was twelvemonth and april
at omers and kept him company the whole week after
that he remembers the first of may by the token that one mr burnaby coming that day to the colledge dr oates made an acquaintance with him and this witness saw them together and at the of recreation for a week at least he came every day after dinner
that he was not in the infirmary till the day after hilsley was gone away continuing there about three days and from that time till iune at least gifford solemnly averrs that he saw him at least every other day for he never was out all that time but one night at watton for his relaxation
and he could not but be taken notice of for though there were a matter of that eat all in the same room yet he sitting at a table apart betwixt the religious and the youths could not chuse but be taken notice of

mr palmer stood up next

who inform'd that he came from omers or months since and that he came because he car'd not for staying any longer that his father lives by windsor that he saw mr oates on mayday new stile by the token that there were strangers that day and that the witness saw him in the afternoon playing with the other boys at ninepins
they call all those boys that are not of the religious and though he sate at a table distinct yet going to school he was still reckon'd among the boys
the witness saw him the next day with mr burnaby and it was wondred at his thrusting himself into his company having never seen him before as mr burnaby said himself
that the witness saw him also at the action and also with mr killingbeck on the
of may who was then departing and likewise with mr poole at his going away
that the
day at a play dr oates would needs sit in the place of the musick and one mr watson quarrelled with him
seeing him also betwixt these times and so from time to time till iune following

mr cox informed

that he came away from omers in november after dr oates that he knew dr oates very well and saw him at omers at the time when he affirms that he was in england for he was often with mr poole when he was sick which mr poole was the witnesse's
that he went away in iuly and never stirr'd from omers till he went quite away
that the witness was there also till dr oates went which was after the consult of the jesuits which he affirms to have been in april and himself to have been at
the witnesse's jumbling of the months caused the people to laugh and the witness still persisted that dr oates was at omers till the jesuits consult was over
he informed that he came thither and was onely one night out of the house at watton all the time he was there
that he did not goe away with mr hilsley for a gent that was going that day for england being loth to rise dr oates told a story of him how loth he was to leave his bed which was the day after hisley went away
the other gent went upon the
of may and mr poole and mr nevil who he says were with him in england were neither of them absent at that time
that dr oates was at omers all may and iune
the witness being prest to name the month when oates came away he said he could not remember it

mr thomas billing informed

that he came about months since from omers that he knew dr oates very well and saw him at omers the very day or the day after that he came thither the
of december and that he continued there till toward the end of iune never out of the house but once at watton in christmas this witness being then in the infirmary and dr oates came in saying that he had been at watton
that he had been twice in the infirmary and the second time was in april where as

that he was there all may and could not be days in england as he says for being entred into the sodality march
he was appointed to read at six a clock every sunday morning and after he had begun he read constantly in course till he went away for he was never sick on a sunday in april but somewhat indisposed so that he went to the infirmary upon occasion for some or days and once in or days the witness constantly saw him

of iune the witness taking a more particular notice of him by serving as a butler and laying the table and drawing beer and the like serving dr oates himself most days
that he came away for his health beginning to be ill at christmas
that he lives with his father in radnorshire and came up to london upon a summons as a witness

mr cook

informs that he came from omers last ianuary upon this occasion and that he hath been ever since in town
that he saw dr oates there in iune and that he went away upon the which he knows being a taylour and having made him some cloaths
that he saw him every day and sometimes times in a day
that he was there all april and all may and he came twice every week to the witnesse's shop for things
that the witness liv'd in the colledge and remembers that dr oates was at watton onely one night in april but he cannot say the very day onely it was spoken of over the house

mr gavan

offers that dr oates says in his narrative he came over in company with sir iohn warner and sir thomas preston and that to prove him perjured clears the prisoners
but being told that they should have indicted him and made that out before if any such thing were mr whitebread replied that they were kept close prisoners pressing again the business of his coming over with sir iohn warner

dr oates

to clear himself of all contradictions says that he named some persons at one time and some at another as his memory served him naming the rectour of liege sir iohn warner father williams father marsh father warner sir thomas preston

one bartlet a dutchman

but speaking a little english informed that he came from omers may

new stile that sir iohn warner was at watton all april and may and that he was there himself and saw sir iohn there that he had been some five or six weeks in england and came over about the latter end of iune
but bartlet being minded that he said the
of may before he excused himself that he thought the question had been ask'd concerning dr oates coming over which he heard of beyond seas

mr tisser was then sworn to be a true interpreter to one carlier

a witness for the prisoners that could not speak english

mr tisser informs that carlier came into england about seven or eight weeks since and that he was for the last two years in watton that he was the last sunday in april and all may at his house there the witness having been his gardener

then mr tisser stood interpreter for another witness charles verron

who speaks no english
verron says that sir iohn warner was at watton all april and may was and so till september and the witness affirms it for he passes with a vessel between omers and watton and for the most part sees sir iohn every day and that the witness is of the roman religion

but that sir thomas preston was away in the time of vacancy which is in august
peter carpentier

informs that being caterer at liege he knew sir thomas preston very well and saw him there every day all april and may

mr gavan told the court

that he had no more witnesses to this point and then offered the difference of his case from the rest and that dr oates did not charge him as sitting in the consult but as seeing his hand to it afterwards representing that onely a profest iesuit has a right of sitting there which as then he was not
the prisoner insists upon a witness that he has to prove that at that time he was at wolverhampton in staffordshire
being told that it was his hand to the consult not his being present at it that was charg'd upon him gavan replied that he could not sign it at london unless he were at london and so he offered to prove himself at wolverhampton the four and the five and twentieth of april
but dr oates swearing that it was in iune or iuly that he saw mr gavan hand to the consult it was considered that it might be sign'd at any time during that intervall and so the proving mr gavan at wolverhampton the four or five and twentieth of april would doe him no good but however his witness was called
catharine winford inform'd that for the greatest part of the summer mr gavan sojourn'd in her house at wolverhampton in staffordshire

in iune and so to the
of iuly when he went to another lodging in the town more convenient for his turn
the witness said that he was never from thence in all that time and that he sojourn'd longer with her but she onely speaks to the months in question
that after he went she seldom failed a day of seeing him and that she was a roman catholick
mary poole

informed that she had known mr gavan or years and that being a servant to mrs winford at wolverhampton she saw mr gavan at this time twelvemonth at her mistresse's and that he was there in april and that she believes he was there in may for she does not remember his going away till the end of iuly and he was there also in iune
it was asked her why she stuck more at may then the other months and her answer was that any body might mistake
she own'd her self likewise to be a roman catholick

mrs winford

was further examined what circumstances she could call to mind at the time when he went from her
to which she answered

that not knowing what she should be examined upon she could not well recollect her self but that he went often abroad to my lord aston that she knew not how long he stay'd there but that she was confident that he did not goe to london for he had no linen with him then as he had when he used to goe a journey
dr oates suggested to the court that he took a chamber to goe into the exercise and that under that pretence he might slip to london and no body the nearer because upon that occasion they are close shut up
to which mrs winford answered that she knew nothing of it but upon any urgent business people are then admitted to see them and that she her self could speak it upon her own knowledge and that about the end of iuly she went often to him after he had left her lodgings
that the former part of iuly he was in the witnesse's house from whence he went upon the
that he was not shut up in the witnesse's house and that the last eight days she was allowed to come to him not but that he was shut up but still upon business either of bringing any thing or speaking with him there was admittance to him
touching the point of his having time enough to be at london and back again while she did not see him the witness declared that she thought he had not but that she was confident that he did not go
but it was observed upon her that she had said peradventure he might be away or days but she still persisted that she was confident he had not been at london in the interim

mr gavan then prest the court for liberty of speech and urged it that dr oates charged him directly to have been in town in iuly and that he met the prisoner with mr ashby

who was then in town so that the prisoner's being in town must be betwixt mr ashby's coming to town and his going out again which he computed to be a fortnight's time
the prisoner reasoning the point in such sort that if he could make it out that he was in staffordshire from the
or
of iuly to the end of the month he had then acquitted himself
dr oates makes it to be either the beginning or middle of iuly that mr ashby came to town but does not swear which onely he rather inclines to think it was the middle and while mr ashby was here mr gavan came up and told the witness that he would go visit mr ashby

mr gavan having given evidence where he was at the end of iuly was now called upon to prove where he was at the beginning of the month

but he told the court that his witnesses were not here and then addressed himself to the court to this effect that being innocent it was not possible for him to imagine upon what point they would accuse him but yet he cast his thoughts every way to see where he was most liable and what he had ever done that might yield the most plausible pretence for a charge and that finding nothing so colourable as his being engaged at that april consult the prisoner had provided himself at his own expence with witnesses to clear that matter
and now having discharged himself by the use of all prudential means for his clearing and having done it effectually as to the
of april upon which the main pretension of a conspiracy was founded he cast himself with all submission upon the honour and justice of the court offering proofs that he was not in london in august protesting solemnly and upon his salvation that he was not in london and imprecating upon himself most exemplary judgments from almighty god if he were not innocent

after this he offered himself to the court to pass the ordeal

as a test of his innocence which in capital cases was in practice for a thousand years together where there was onely the oath of the accuser against the denial of the accused
but this custome being now out and the

proposal favouring of a popular artifice it was not allowed him

here six witnesses more are produced for him
the first witness saw him every day the last week of iuly
the second witness saw him the last fortnight in staffordshire as he believes but cannot positively averr it
the third witness living in the same town could not say that he was out of it all iuly but the last week he was in the witnesse's house
the fourth witness spake onely to the last week too

mr whitebread offered in his defence that dr oates failing in his testimony against ireland was not probus testis

but improbus and so an incompetent witness and not to be credited in one case after being convict of perjury in another recommending to the jury to take notice of it that he fled from his former testimony
where the prisoner was admonished that he was gone from the present question and that there was no conviction of perjury without a record and to prove it that record must be produc'd too

mr harcourt

pressed it that mr bedlow mr prance dr oates and mr dugdale were men of desperate fortunes and flagitious persons and that false swearing was their livelihood and that these were the men by whom he was charg'd
and then again if the evidence on his side should be rejected because they were roman catholicks it would be a very hard case in his own particular and destructive also of common commerce with other countries and it would be vain to call witnesses if a roman catholick should not be taken as a good evidence

mr harcourt was here inform'd of his mistake for roman catholicks

were allowed to be witnesses and none refused upon this triall

mr harcourt

said farther that dr oates charged him one while with paying the li for the ruffians at his chamber and another while at wild house and that he had witnesses to that point
dr oates lays it that mr ireland was by too whereas the witnesses were now in court that would prove him to have been all august in staffordshire producing it in the printed trialls
but the print being no record and what dr oates said before not being the point now in issue that suggestion could not avail the prisoner
dr oates denying also that ever he said that ireland and harcourt were together at the paiment of the li to the villains and affirming that they were not together

mr gavan

acknowledged that the proof of his not being in town was rather a negative then a positive evidence but however as to dr oates testimony he charg'd the borrowing of of mr ireland upon september
at which time mr ireland was at boscobell
but dr oates denied the speaking precisely to the day and would not be positive whether first second or any certain day but that as he remembred it was the second
the prisoner then produc'd pendrell and gifford and their wives

mr gifford gave evidence

that being last sessions in court to prove that he saw mr ireland upon the
and
days of aug in staffordshire the day that dr oates affirmed he saw him in london dr oates being at a loss upon the particulars affirmed at last that he had of ireland in mr harcourt chamber on the first or second of september about the fast day
dr oates said here that he spake to the best of his memory and mr gifford went on saying that he saw him there some other of those days but that there were divers then in court that were every day in his company
but they were now upon the wrong trial again

dr oates informed

that it was not ireland but harcourt that he charged with being at wild house where coleman met him and that most of

the money was there and carried back to harcourt chamber where it was delivered to the man that carried it to windsor coleman leaving a guinny for the messenger but he himself going away before
dr oates farther delivered that mr fenwick took leave of mr ireland as going to omers betwixt august
and but whether they met about the plot or no or what they said he does not remember the particulars
to the question whether fenwick had any communication with ireland in august for the furtherance of the plot dr oates gave evidence that he had

young mrs harwell informed the same from the to the
saving that on bartholmew eve he went to litchfield and came back again upon which day she did not see him
mr gavan here offered evidence of a prisoner in newgate to the same point desiring to be instructed whether a man charg'd with but not convict of the same crime might not be a good evidence
but he had no encouragement to make use of him
elizabeth keeling inform'd that she saw mr ireland at wolverhampton from the
of august to the
when she went out of town and coming back on thursday found him there where he continued till the
mr pendrell then informed that he saw mr ireland septemb

who saw him there and it was answered that there was onely mr dugdale to witness that

mr fenwick produced captain hill against mr bedlow

and offered to prove by a clark of sir iames boteler that he couzen'd a cuttler of a sword
but the clark being called and not present nothing was done about it mr fenwick still reproaching him with several cheats
his pardon being objected the prisoner replied that a pardon did not make a good witness and pretended to prove something since his pardon

mr whitebread charges mr bedlow with giving evidence against him this trial

in contradiction to his declaration that he had nothing to say against him the last insisting upon it that the reason now suggested of his forbearance was no way intimated at that trial and that not swearing the whole truth he had broken his oath and is perjur'd
this objection was left to the jury
and then captain hill inform'd onely of mr bedlow condition in the marshalsea which was found to be of no moment to the matter in question

the king's councell having summ'd up the whole proceedings thus far into a brief deduction and narrative and so laying it before the jury the king's witnesses were called

and informed that the first knowledge he had of dr oates was about april last was twelvemonth at mr charles howard in a corner of old arundel house where he met him by chance upon a visit to mr howard as an acquaintance and friend and that he saw him there the second time in may also but the day he could not say nor whether he saw him afterwards or not but that dr oates in court was the person he saw there
dr oates offering to the court that mr clay was a priest in orders but that question was not put to him onely he own'd himself to be a papist

mr whitebread

plea was that urging dr oates at the last triall to name any one that he had seen in town he could not name any body
and so likewise afterwards at the committee he told that the prisoner lay privately at grove and the prisoner can prove that he never lay there at all and then he was positive that he stay'd here but six days and saw little company
now the evidence affirms that at the end of march or the middle of april he saw him here and yet dr oates himself declares that he passed the sea with hilsley the twenty fourth of april
if he landed in england the seventeenth of april as is said and continued here a good part of may how can this stand with his being in england but six days the prisoners were answered that the precise day was not so punctually sworn to so that dr oates might be seen here the latter end of april and the beginning of may and yet his testimony stand good

mr gavan offered to the court

that the evidence against them spake onely to one or two particular days one to his dining with him and another to his disguise and that in the very evidence there was a manifest contradiction for he could not come over with hilsley as he said he did and appear here in may and all this within six days
that it might be farther considered also the disproportion in the number of the witnesses sixteen for the prisoners and such as conversed with dr oates every day
or allowing that a less number for the king should weigh down a greater number on the part of the prisoners the exception to his evidence about the rectour of liege sir iohn warner and sir thomas preston remains yet untouch'd
or supposing a mistake in what concerns dr oate being at omers there are yet six that prove he has sworn false
and the prisoner humbly represented that no body ought to be condemned but upon two sufficient witnesses
and after all that mr ireland was prov'd to have been out of london from august to september by at least staffordshire witnesses
which two points remain without answer for dr oates says that he was with him here august
when they agree that he was in staffordshire
as to the maid she onely says that she saw him without speaking to him
the prisoner here appealing to the honour and conscience of the court how far to believe a witness that hath even in one point falsify'd
and then there is sir iohn southcott and his family that give an account of mr ireland in the country from august to the
which was after the precise day that the maid speaks of in london
there are seven or eight of

them that agree upon the seeing of him from the first day to the last
and whereas it is objected in the business of iuly that the prisoner's witnesses speak positively onely to the last week the prisoner offers that they rather incline to think him there the other weeks also then not and that being shut up in the last they took a more particular notice of him
he minded the court also of the evidence of mr ashby coming to town about and of the prisoner's coming likewise within the fortnight which mr ashby staid and of the prisoner's saying he would wait upon father ashby where the discourse past that he speaks of adding that he is neither prov'd to have been at the great consult nor capable of it appealing to mr harcourt and the rest whether he were there or not and upon the word of a dying man denying it
as to the prisoner's name being to it which is laid in iuly he proves himself in staffordshire the last week of that month and has evidences of being there till the
and the last week which he hoped would be considered
he mov'd farther whether standing accused by one witness about one fact in london and by another concerning another fact in staffordshire these two witnesses are to be reckoned good in law
but this being already resolved in sir henry vane case where severall witnesses prov'd severall facts in severall countries and yet all overt acts of one and the same treason mr gavan suggested that serjeant rolls was of another opinion
mr gavan second plea was grounded upon the circumstances of credible witnesses and of clear evidence but that in his case there was neither the one nor the other and therefore that he ought not to be convicted by such a witness and upon such an evidence
wherein the court informed him that they were lawfull witnesses because not convict of any crime to destroy their testimony and for the credibility of them that was left to the iury
whereupon the prisoner addressed himself to the iury to this following effect

that his life was in their hands

that he was not at the consult nor of age to be there that to the making of a credible witness there must be integrity of life and truth of testimony

that dr oates was turned out of omers as a person of ill moralls that in sir iohn warner sir thomas preston's and the business of mr ireland being here august
he is unanswerably disporv'd and that though he be not convicted of perjury he might have been so that there was enough before them to shake his testimony
and then in mr ireland business betwixt august
and
how many proofs of his being in staffordshire to one woman that says she saw him in town sixteen witnesses that were daily in his company that affirm'd the contrary
he inculcated over again the business of the omers witnesses sixteen to three or four the contradiction of dr oates his coming over with hilsley and staying but six days with the evidence that saw him in town april and may his being at wolverhampton from iuly
upwards

as to mr dugdale

he had the knowledge of him five or six years severall disco urses with him but none treasonous upon his salvation and that he came away from his lord after he had embezelled li of his money

that he mr gavan had been twenty weeks a prisoner without the means of sending for witnesses
concluding with an asseveration of his innocence as he hoped to see the face of god and with a prayer for the king and the court
mr whitebread minded the court of an excellent observation made upon that rank and dangerous letter which mr dugdale pretends to have intercepted from the prisoner to mr ewers that none but a would send such a letter by the post
and so he recommended the improbability of it to the jury

mr fenwick desired the court and jury to consider the evidence on both sides

the one spake to the whole time upon a daily conversation the other onely to this or that day or seeing dr oates in a disguise on the one side so many youths train'd up in vertue and on the other a beggerly sort of people that might be drawn in to mend their fortunes by their evidence
his testimony then is false as to sir iohn warner mr williams and sir thomas preston for they came not over with him
or suppose the witnesses to be equal what support has he for his evidence such and such letters he pretends from mr whitebread which if it were true the prisoners deserved to be hang'd for fools as well as for knaves for trusting a creature that they never had any esteem for and who was expelled the colledge

and then for the commissions and letters he speaks of

tis almost a year that this discovery hath been afoot and thousands of letters seiz'd and yet not one commission appears not one penny of mony or any order for it no arms found nor out of all these letters any thing discovered towards this design
and for all the writings signed which he says were hundreds from one consult to another there is not one single paper produced in confirmation of it
ending in these words there is no reason brought among them all but saying and swearing and that i'll stand by

mr whitebread told the court and jury

that whereas dr oates charg'd him with beating of him first the prisoner neither was nor ever had been a fighting man and he appeal'd to their considerations how he should dare to strike a person whom he had made privy to so dangerous a secret
reflecting then upon the strangeness of the thing that so many eminent persons should be concerned in it the plot discovered and yet no footsteps of it appear
and so he recommended himself to god and the jury
mr harcourt then declared that being now arrived at seventy years of age this was the first time in his whole life that he had been accused before a magistrate but that a negative cannot be proved and that there was no evidence against them but downright swearing
mr fenwick was about to pass a reflection upon the life and conversation of the witnesses but bringing no proof he put an end to the discourse

mr turner being demanded what he had to say he did ask if it were reasonable to admit of those people to an oath in evidence

who for scandall were debarr'd the sacrament as he would prove by one hastings
but he being called and not appearing the court proceeded to give directions to the jury wherein the evidences were so fully and distinctly summ'd up by my lord chief justice that there was nothing to be added to them

the jury were then sent out to consider of their verdict

and after about a quarter of an hour they returned and found all the prisoners guilty of the high treason whereof they stood indicted
and after a short and pithy speech of the recorder to the jury they were remanded to newgate and the court adjourned till next morning

the history of the charge and defence of richard
langhorn esq

upon iune

mr richard langhorn was brought to his trial

at the in the old bayly according to an adjournment of the day before standing indicted of high treason for contriving the death of the king the subversion of the protestant religion and of the establisht government
he pleaded not guilty to the indictment
the jury was sworn without any challenge
the king's councell open'd the charge and so the court entred upon the trial beginning with some evidences upon the main design

mr dugdale and mr prance were both sworn

and mr dugdale spake first to the plot upon the life of the king declaring that he himself had been engaged in divers consultations for the destruction of his majesty and of the present government and for bringing in of popery
that being at most of their meetings he heard these very expressions us'd and was tempted with reward to be instrumental in it and to kill the king

the men that put him upon it were all jesuits as mr ewers mr gavan mr leveson and vavasour
that upon the killing of the king they were to be ready with an army but not before though at first it was resolved to raise an army out of hand

they had some thoughts of beginning with a massacre

and then to cut off those that scap'd with an army but this witness did not hear of any certain number resolved upon
these consultations were at tixal boscobel my lord aston and mr gerrard all in staffordshire and the protestants were to be destroy'd in the first place

touching sir edmundbury godfry death harcourt wrote a letter to ewers that began thus this very night sir edmundbury godfry is dispatch'd and more to that purpose
the witness saying thus to mr ewers about it i'll be hang'd if this don't spoil the design whose answer was that he was a great enemy of loose people and it would be judg'd some of them had done it in revenge
the letter was received upon monday night and dated on saturday

mr prance declared

that one mr messenger was engaged by the lord arundell of wardour and the lord powis to murther the king and was promised a considerable reward as my lord's butler told this witness who afterwards meeting with messenger and asking him why he would do it his answer was that he was off on't now

the king being dispatch'd men were forthwith to be raised

as fenwick ireland and grove said in the witnesse's hearing being all together
that this army was to set up the romish religion and all the protestants to be destroyed the lords arundell and powis to command these forces
and he says that one harcourt twice at his chamber in dukesstreet told him that there were several to kill his majesty
this was in the hearing of one mr thompson and fenwick told the witness that langhorn was deeply concerned in't and that was all the witness knew

dr oates was then sworn

and this is the summe of his evidence
that returning out of spain into england in november he brought mr

langhorn

letters from two sons that he had in spain in english colledges the one at madrid the other at valladolid
he delivered the letters within a day or two after his arrivall to mr langhorn at his chamber in the middle temple who treated the witness very respectfully and upon telling him that the witness thought his sons would enter themselves into the society mr langhorn standing that way affected himself was very glad of it for matters would not hold long in england as they were he said and that if they kept themselves in the world they might quickly come to great preferment in england

the witness was once more with mr langhorn

before his coming to omers which was in november old stile december new when he gave him a pacquet of letters to carry with him
in this pacquet was a letter of thanks to the fathers at omers for their kindness to his sons in their journey for spain and promising the repayment of twenty pound which they had furnished his sons with upon their passage
this letter was subscribed richard langhorn and it made mention of one written to father le chaise in order to our concerns
these were the very words
now the letter to le chaise this witness did not see but onely the other that took notice of it and he said that mr coleman having written to him at large he should not trouble his reverence with many words at that time

the witness remembers also another letter

either in march or april he could not say which wherein mr langhorn among divers ill passages expressed a wonderfull zeal for the catholick design and saying that the parliament began to cool in the business of the protestant religion and that now was the time to give the blow that was the word the blow but the letter was too large to give a particular account of

dr oates minded the court of the consult here in april
the witness and divers others came from omers and other parts to that consult
mr langhorn himself was not at it but the witness was ordered by the provinciall to tell mr langhorn from time to time what passed there and upon the report the witness made him to their proceedings mr langhorn with his hands and eyes up to heaven prayed god to prosper them

the summe of the witnesse's report to mr langhorn was this

that cary was to go procurator to rome that they had concluded upon the death of the king that pickering and grove were to attempt the king's person li to grove and masses to pickering to be the reward
he told him also that they had all signed the agreement
and this past a day or two after the signing of it

the witness swears that there were at that time divers parchments lying upon mr langhorn

which he found to be commissions for the arundell of wardour powis bellasis and petre to be chancellour treasurer general
that there was one for coleman to be secretary of state and another for mr langhorn to be advocate of the army
they were authoriz'd by a brief from the pope directed to the general of the society with the jesuits cross upon them and signed iohannes paulus de oliva

the witness being demanded if they lay open he told the court that they lay upon a corner of a desk folded up

and that he came to take notice of them by having information from one father anderton that these patents as he call'd them were come whereupon the witness spake of them to mr langhorn

and upon his desire he let the witnesse have the sight of them who remembers that there was one more for a son of the lord arundell and something for the lord stafford too concerning the army
the witness saw severall of these commissions and the greater part of them in mr langhorn study but he could not say all
the prisoner told the witness that for inferiour officers and all there were about but a matter of or were all that the witness saw

dr oates swears that in april and may he saw the answer to several of mr langhorn letters to la chaise

and that the fathers desiring to have the originals mr langhorne delivered them to this witness who carried them to the fathers
they came from the fathers la chaise confessor to the french king and anderton rector of the colledge at rome
the witness saw them in mr langhornes custody but he cannot say that they were directed to him the substance of la chaise's was to assure them of his firmness to the english society and that the french king would assist them for the advancing of the cause

that mr langhorne being the iesuits sollicitor went with harcourt fenwick keines and langworth to the benedictine monks

to desire their aid towards the work and the witness hath heard that at the prisoners instance they contributed pounds which was by them paid to the society and mr langhorne was said to have received it toward the murther of the king and the change of religion
this witness did not see the payment of the money but about iuly or august he heard mr langhorne say discoursing of it that he would do what he could towards the getting of it and how troubled he was that sir george wakeman made such a difficulty of accepting of ten thousand pounds for poysoning the king adding that it was a publick work and a body would have done it for nothing but that he was a very covetous and
a writing under the iesuits seal being shew'd in court to mr oates he presently declared that to be the very hand which was to the other and just such a seal

several questions being put to the witness by or in the name of the prisoner dr oates answer'd that he went towards st omers

at the latter end of november and that he arrived there about the tenth of december new style that he went in the and stayed there till april following without stirring from thence saving only that he went to paris and was a night or two at watton and then came away in april whether about the middle or latter end he could not say but he was in england under twenty days

there came over with him nine or ten in all

as father williams father march the rector of liege sir iohn warner and that he could not name any more
the prisoner objecting to him that the names of all the rest were in the record of the dr oates referred him to the record
the prisoner ask'd him also if sr tho preston and poole came over with him and the witness said they did

to the objection that this was but a repetition of what was proved the day before the prisoner humbly offered that the trial of the day before was in another county and by another iury and therefore he presumed in his own defence

to urge this in which liberty he was not debarr'd

the witness said also that he thought sir robert brett was there
the prisoner express'd the drift of his questions to be only this to see if dr oates would now affirm what he swore in the lords house dr oates telling him that he might produce that record and the court allowing that a sworn copy of that record would be good evidence

the prisoner ask'd if the witness came from dover by coach

or on horseback dr oates replied that it was a sudden question but that as he remembers he came by coach
the prisoner then giving the reason of his question because upon a trial at the kings bench the witness said he came in a coach with mr hilsley mr oates declaring that they came over together in the boat but upon landing they parted

mr langhorne ask'd him where he lodged at his coming into town and his answer was that when he came in april he lay at mr groves but being ask'd where he lay the first night dr oates could not speak certainly to that

but in general that he lay there and as he remembers some three or four nights

dr oates swears that he acquainted mr langhorne with the consult within a day or two after it that he returned to st omers as he believ'd the first week in may
and being then told that he had said the day before that his stay there was but six days he said that was a mistake for he said under twenty

the prisoner demanded if dr oates saw him write those letters he spake of he said no but he knew his hand for he saw an order of his for the paying of money to his sons and the money was paid upon that order

the prisoner demanded if he could say that la chaise or anderton ever wrote to him to which dr oates answer'd that he had letters subscribed with their names and that langhorne himself told him that they came from them and that they were to be imparted to priests and iesuites and that he delivered those letters to the witness to that end

the prisoner desired to know how long he staid at st omers dr oates told him till iune new style
the prisoner then demanded seeing him to be come over from the church of rome to the church of england when it was that he went over from the church of england to that of rome and if he was then beneficed the time dr oates told him was in february or march and that he was for some time in a vicaridge at bobbing in kent and that he came to that vicaridge in
mr langhorne taking notice that he turn'd papist in ask'd him whether or no he had left his living first dr oates answer'd that he had left the place not very long before for the air did not agree with him besides that he had other private reasons for leaving it
mr langhorne ask'd if turning papist he became a iesuite also because he says in his narrative there came nine of us over all iesuites the court told him first that it was not a fair question and then that what he offered was no evidence

the prisoner then ask'd the witness if he had ever been in his company since that business in his chamber of the consult and commissions dr oates made answer he had been twice with him about the time of the consult and twice or thrice after his coming over again

mr bedloe is sworn

mr bedloe

declares upon a question concerning a writing signed by the superiour of the iesuites that he had it at mr daniel arthurs and that finding it to agree with the hand and seal that he had observed upon commissions in paris he presented it to the council
let the reader observe here that this was a business only of a private concern

the witness swears to this effect that he had no familiarity with mr langhorne

but some three years since being entrusted by mr harcourt and coleman with certain letters to la chaise mr coleman carried him to mr langhorne chamber who there entred them and they were then sealed up by mr coleman who delivered them to the vvitness to carry them the letters being written at mr colemans and only registred by mr langhorne
some of these letters were read in court at mr colemans trial

the scope

of them was only to inform la chaise that he wanted nothing but money now in england to accomplish the work and to learn what supplies they might expect from france
that the catholicks were safe in england all places of trust in their hands or at least in such as were well inclined and that considering the conjuncture of the present power of the french king and a general disposition of circumstances here there never was so fair an occasion of accomplishing their ends
this was to father stapylton in english but the other to the nuncio and la chaise were in french and to the same purpose

mr langhorne copied these before the witness

he went into his study and wrote while mr coleman and the witness walked in the chamber
the witness declared that there was not a penny of money in this business but some way or other past his accounts
the witness cannot say that ever mr langhorne spake to him expressly of the kings death but only of the main design

the witness was with him a second time

about a year and half since and it was from harcourt for the registring of another pacquet of letters
he took the pacquet and without much heeding the messenger sent word to mr harcourt that mr williams a name that this witness was known by had brought him some letters which he would return again the next day as soon as he had coppy'd them
that mr harcourt shew'd this witness the answer in this pacquet there were two letters one says the vvitness that he brought out of spain from sir william godolphin directed to the lord bellassis which was sent to mr langhorne some three weeks after to be entred the other from the irish iesuites in salamanca directing that the rest of the lords concerned and the whole popish party in england should be in readiness for they had now gotten some irish casheer'd souldiers

that should be laid to embarque at the groyn under the colour of pilgrims and then to land at milford haven where as the vvitness said the lord powis whould have a considerable body of men to help forward the design
the prisoner enter'd colemans letters into a large parchment book but the vvitness did not see him enter the other the book seem'd at least three inches thick and that two thirds of it were filled
pritchard telling the vvitness that the commissions were in mr langhornes

hand and every thing now ready the vvitness asking about his commission pritchard made answer that mr langhornes commissions were only for the general officers and that the vvitness must have his from the lord bellassis

as to the money to be advanced by the benedictine monks

the vvitness says that in the pacquet to la chaise of may there was a letter inclosed to mr stapylton a benedictine monk to furnish the money they had promised the sum was not named but the vvitness says that la chaise told him that the french king was sure enough and the money not to be doubted
nay that part of it was already sent over to coleman and ireland and the rest should follow so soon as they were ready for it
the vvitness declares that he never discoursed with mr langhorne about commissions not ever saw any in his hand only pritchard told it to this vvitness but that st henry tichburne at paris shewed the vvitness three commissions signed and seal'd in form which made him take so much notice of the writing produced this day in court of mr arthurs having the same hand and seal to it

how far mr langhorne was privy to the treachery of pickering and grove this vvitness cannot say but mr harcourt told the vvitness upon a particular occasion that he was going to mr langhornes to enter

the minutes of that morning resolution which was a result for the dispatch of those people to new market that were to murther the king
but hearsay being no evidence mr bedloe was examined what he remembred out of any letter that he saw mr langhorne transcribe and so he informed the court that in a letter of an account was desired of the religious at doway and paris what progress they had made with the rest of their friends towards the furnishing of money for the hearts and arms of the english were ready the garrisons plac'd in good hands and nothing but money wanting

there were three of these letters transcribed by mr langhorne one to la chaise another to the popes nuntio and a third to the english monks at paris
there were in these letters expressions of arms and garrisons and in that to la chaise an invitation of the assistance of the french
the letter it self did not mention the destruction of the king and of the protestant religion but mr langhornes and mr colemans discourse expounded the meaning of it and that it was to overthrow the government and set up popery and they did also lay their heads together after the letters were transcribed
here mr langhorne asked if this were all that mr bedloe had to charge upon him whose answer was that he thought of no more at present but something else might come into his mind hereafter

dr oates now minded the court of one thing which he had forgotten there were crowns he said as a contribution from the congregation at rome

to be remitted into england mr langhorne was inquisitive after this money having advice that it was received in france and mr langhorne himself told father harcourt keines and fenwick in iuly or august that the money was lodg'd in france

mr bedloe also recollected himself that keines told him one day must go immediately to mr langhorne and when he returned afterward with a letter in his hand he told the vvitness that cardinal barbarini

had sent mr langhorne a chiding letter for slipping their opportunities and making to more half
this vvitness did not see the letter but keines told him the tenour of it and that he had it from mr langhorne

these vvitnesses having delivered their evidence the prisoner desired they might not depart the court
thomas busse declares that in september last

drinking with an old acquaintance that was newly come out of italy and just going over again one anthony being in the company you must have a special care says he to anthony of those four worthy gentlemen that brought over with me
what said this vvitness from italy no says he but they are four worthy irish gentlemen that will do our business
this vvitness neither asking any question nor heeding the matter till colemans trial that speaks of the irish men that were to attempt the king at windsor and then he reflected upon it
he that spake it had some relation to the benedictine monks in the savoy and anthony was something about the queens chappel both of them strong papists
so that an order was granted with all reverence to her majesty for the enquiring after antonio hankinson being gone again beyond sea before

mr langhorn offered to the court

that the two vvitnesses against him were parties in the crime charged upon him and he desired to know whether they had their pardon or not mr bedloe made answer that he had three and dr oates that he had two under the broad seal mr bedloe saying that he gave no evidence till he had it
it was declared that they were witnesses whether they had or not or otherwise that they should not have been admitted
mr langhorne however remitted himself to the court as to his councel whether having had their pardons they might not fall under the same prospect in law with an approver not as directly being approvers but under some equivalence of reason with them
if the approver be pardon'd the appellee ought also to be discharged it seems hard that those that were participes criminis and having now got their pardons should be admitted for allowable vvitnesses against the prisoner

mr langhorne desired also to know

if they had either received or if they did not expect gratifications or rewards for their discoveries dr oates to acquit himself declared that he had been rewarded by expending six or seven hundred pounds out of his own pocket without knowing whether ever he should see it again
mr langhorne said that a prisoner mr reading told him mr bedlow had received five hundred pounds
to which it was answer'd that first mr reading was an incompetent vvitness and secondly his was for the discovery of sir edmondb
godfreys murther not for the plot

mr bedlow affirmed that he was so far from gaining by his discovery that he was seven hundred pounds out of pocket

as to the approver the court told him he was ever allowed maintenance and there must be a proof of corrupt contract or subornation to invalidate a witness
mr langhorne gave the court the reason of pressing this for though it might be very prudential to invite any man to come in by the promise of a reward towards the discovery of a plot where such a person absents himself yet it seems very hard that when a man is once in custody vvitnesses should be call'd in against him by such means the prisoner was here advised to speak first to the fact and afterwards to the witnesses
the prisoner upon this represented to the court that he had no possibility of making any other defence setting forth that from the of october to that day sevennight or friday last he had been kept so close that he knew nothing of what was done abroad no friend or relation admitted to him he could never hear what was charged upon him and could not foresee

what would be and therefore the he had no other plea left him but the incompetency of the witnesses
it was objected to him as a scandal to the kings proclamation to suppose an incouragement to the swearing of a plot where there was none and that king lords and commons were touch'd in such a reflection
mr langhorne said no more but that there was a reward propos'd and so call'd his vvitnesses

dr oates informed the court

that there were papists come in with their swords on but that apprehension being compos'd mr langhorne desired that mr hilsley might be set up first who gave this account

that he came over from st omers april new style

that he left him at st omers and that he did not overtake him at calais as is suggested
that tis true he lost his money as dr oates says and that he himself had met one by the way that told dr oates the story

mr gifford declared

that he did see dr oates and that he told them at st omers that hilsley was gone away and this was some three or four days after he was gone he did not remember what passed in the particular discourse nor whether any body was by when dr oates and he were speaking concerning hilsleys being gone away

there stood up a third witness then

who said that dr oates was with him and mr burnaby came into the company and told him that he met with mr hilsley and that he was cousen'd of his money he did not say how but by a shirking fellow and the vvitness does not know whether he named the place or no
to prove now that dr oates must know this by another hand the third witness affirmed further that dr oates had been at st omers from december till iune except one day that he was at watton where he saw him almost every day that he saw him in the refectory where he had a little table by himself that this witness was there every day and there he saw dr oates
mr langhorne offered then what appears both in his narrative and upon his oath in the lords house that he affirm'd sir robert brett came over with him
but mr langhorne was to have spoken to something that was sworn there
mr langhorne prest it that dr oates had own'd that what he swore was truth and so proceeded to his vvitnesses concerning sir iohn warner coming over with him

the fourth witness was sir iohn warners gardener who affirmed that his master was at watton all april and may that the witness was only four days away at st omers and left his master and found him at watton that for the last of april the first second and third of may he saw dr oates at st omers and when he went away he did not know
he affirm'd that st iohn warner was at watton all april and may but he would not speak to all iune being asked why not to the one as well as to the other his answer was that the rector sir francis williams came then for england and in the absence of the rector he took upon him the charge of the house
this was the th of april where sir iohn warner was in iune and iuly he could not tell nor where in august and september more than that he went out of town then and the vvitness knew not whither
the court ask'd him how he came to be more doubtful of these months than of the rest and his answer was because that the question fell upon the other months
it was then reflected upon that april was the very day that dr oates came over and the rector one of those that he said came over with him but the vvitness reply'd that

the rector came single having onely one officer of the college

mr gifford was then examined

as to sir iohn warner who declared that he saw him about iune in st omers and then in iune or iuly when he invited the vvitness to watton
the fifth witness affirmes that the first of may being a great feast he saw dr oates for four days and afterwards all the month of may and that he also saw mr pool and sr robert brett at the same time but where sir iohn warner was then he knew not dr oates affirmed that mr pool came over with him
the fifth witness further informed that mr pool being his could not be away without his missing of him

this witness was a taylor and having a suit of cloathes to make for mr killingbeck dr oates came into the shop and ask'd him questions about them

mrs grove then informed

that she never saw dr oates that she had lodgers in her house april was twelvemonth and that she knew them not till they came to lie there and that dr oates could not be there but she must know him for there was no place to lodge him
dr oates affirmed that he lay alone when he lay there and that it was the place where two men were seized and carried away
the witness owned that such men had been seized there but denied that dr oates ever lay in that place dr oates swears that he did lie there three or four nights

more or less
it was considered that dr oates being in a disguise might not be known but the vvitness said that she knew them all and nam'd them one strange and mrs lay one pair of stairs her sister above and there they lay all april and may and in march too there lay one mr crupper in the room where the men were taken and a young man with him which young man was a prisoner by mr oates procurement and mrs lodged there too

mrs groves maid inform'd that her mistresses brother and sister lay in the room

and no men but mr strange he and mrs lay there in april may iune iuly and august

mr langhorne desires liberty to prove a copy of the record in the lords house which not being allowed for evidence he told the court that it was an extract out of their iournals and the particular he insisted on was concerning the company that dr oates says came over with him from st omers it is that which dr oates remitted himself to and has gone over and over with it that sir iohn warner sir

thomas preston and mr pool came all along with him
the prisoner was told that if he had a record to overthrow his present evidence he might produce it mr laughorne then desired that those that took irelands trial might be called and that he might be permitted to make proof by witnesses of what was there sworn with regard to the prisoner at the barr and being told that it was not to be done the prisoner desired to know why not for he had a witness to prove that such words were spoken without which he had no means of defence the answer to him was that as it would be no proof against him so it could be none for him

there was a complaint here brought in by the lord castlemain

of violence offered by the rabble to the prisoners witnesses and that they were in danger of their lives for their coming to give evidence which was highly resented by the court as an affront to publick justice and direction given to enquire out the offenders tht they might be punished

a witness was now called to speak to one point about the meeting at the whitehorse taverne

who informed that she had kept the house seven years and left it last iuly
the question was about the number that met at that consult dr oates answered that there might be some eighteen or twenty there at a time and that they were divided into several rooms
the witness said that she knew the greatest part of those that used her house and that she could say nothing to the particular of who was in her house april the th but that she did not remember that ever she saw dr oates there
it was plain however that he might be there and she not know on't
mr langhorne gave this reason for asking how many because dr oates both in his depositions before the lords

and in colemans trial affirmed there were fifty persons at that meeting and that then they adjourned into several small meetings
but it was returned that so there might be at several times of the same day and dr oates explained himself that though the meeting was the th day the consult continued yet till the th at night
the witness urged that she never knew so many in the house together but once in all her time and that was upon a iury and they were forc'd to put them into three rooms for there was not a chamber to receive above a dozen upon this three witnesses made oath

the first that he had seen a dozen or sixteen at dinner there in a room together and that it would hold twenty the second that there were two rooms in the house where twenty five or thirty might dine together in either of them and a third that he himself was at a there towards the street where there were above twenty persons
the prisoner thought it material however if the room would not hold fifty and he spake only upon information for he had never been there

mr langhorne being ask'd

if he had any more witnesses mov'd that he might reserve them till the kings council had spoken but that was not found allowable so he pray'd an answer to a question or two if the court pleas'd
the one was mr ireland here in london in august or not to which it was reply'd that it was a point forreign to the matter in question
the other was since mr oates affirm'd himself six or seven hundred pound out of purse since his discovery if the prisoner might examine two witnesses upon the probability of that assertion for if he were extreamly necessitous before how should he get credit for it since but by his evidence but it was found to be a matter clear from the point to demand of him how he came by his money

mr langhorne then offer'd a copy of a record of the house of lords

to prove that mr bedloe had there declared that he had no person more to charge either in the house or out of the house than what he there charged and that he the prisoner was none of the persons there charged
it was objected that he might forget things at that time and call them to mind afterwards and besides that some body should have been produced to prove that mr bedloe took that oath

mr langhorne offered a question now concerning the commissions

asking whether or no and to whom the prisoner distributed those commissions as the vvitness says he did

dr oates replyed that he only said the commissions were delivered but not to whom but that he affirms they were for those five persons and that the prisoner himself told him in iuly or august that he had dispos'd of them without naming to whom only speaking of one which he sent his son with to my lord arundell eldest son he told this vvitness it was delivered not calling to mind that he knew of any other
this question is put says mr langhorne because dr oates charged the prisoner before the lords

with sending the commission to the lord arundel himself
dr oates affirming also that he saw a letter in the prisoners chamber acknowledging the receipt of it

mr langhorne desired

that mr lidcott might be examined to a point of dr oates evidence at colemans trial where he says that he came and communicated to the prisoner the matter of the consult the very next day after it and never saw the prisoner any more but mr lidcott though present there was not able to speak to the particulars of the trial so mr blany was ask'd what he could testifie upon that point who acknowledged that he took the notes and remembred something about mr langhorne but could not charge his memory upon it without book so mr langhorne presented the narrative which mr blany said was not printed from his copy

but an historical narrative was agreed to be no evidence in law
mr langhorne offer'd that without some light to his charge he could not prepare himself for his defence and that in other cases people are confronted before a magistrate and so come to understand the matter of their charge
mrs sillyard was called but affirming that she durst not give evidence without being secur'd from the rabble and the court being only able to promise justice upon any offender in that kind that should be brought before them she was discharged by mr langhornes consent without examination

mr langhorne said

that he intended to make use of her evidence to a deposition of mr bedloes at readings trial which was that he could have said more against whitebread and fenwick then he did at their first trials which concealment he took to be perjury for not having told all the truth and that however impertinent it might seem it was yet of great effect to the prisoner to shew that the vvitness against him was not to be believed
but mr whitebread having before receiv'd an answer to that objection the kings council summ'd up the whole matter in brief to the jury and then more of the kings vvitnesses were sworn
william walker deposeth

that he had known dr oates seven or eight years
that towards the end of march or the middle of april following he had seen him in england in a disguise and could not call him to mind that night but early in the morning it came into his head that it was titus oates and so he rose early to enquire of a gentlewoman concerning him that knew him and asking her how dr oates did she struck her hand upon the counter and cried he is an undone man for he was turn'd papist
the vvitness asking her then if she knew were he was no said she he is skulking somewhere up and down here and dares not shew his head in the day
whereupon this vvitness told her that he had seen him the day before about ten in the morning betwixt st martins lane and leicester house but that he was disguised and the vvitness described his habit to her
mr langhorne prayed he might speak to the time as near as he could and the vvitness said that he did rather think but could not be positive that it was about the middle of april and that it was not about the time of the year when he usually came to town to receive money
and the vvitness affirms that it was dr oates whom he saw and that he was brought up for a vvitness having spoken of this passage to several persons after the report of the plot which he supposes might come to dr oates ear by chance

mrs ives then deposed

that mr walker told her being the mistress of the house the substance of what he gave in evidence concerning her adding that it was about the middle of april was and that dr oates father coming to her shop and eating some upon their first coming in she told him the story that walker had told her

one butler was sworn sr richard barkers servant and affirmed

that he had known dr oates two or three years and that he saw him the beginning of may last was at his masters house enquiring for dr tongue that he was so disguised as that he heardly knew him
that the witness in court was the man and titus oates his name
this vvitness bad him welcome into england but he went in and came forth again without taking any notice of the witness
he was in a a his hair cropt to his ears and one would rather have taken him for a shepheard than a minister
mr langhorne ask'd if it were in or in the vvitness affirmed it to be in may was and that he told his master about a week after at his coming out of the country that dr oates had been there in a strange dress to ask for doctor tongue
cecily mayo was then sworn

and said she never saw dr oates face till about a fortnight before whitsontide was and that then a servant of sir richard barkers shew'd him to her at the window and that this gentleman dr oates in court is that man
philip page deposed that he had known dr oates five years and that he saw him at sr richard barkers about the beginning of may was twelvemonth and that he was positive that dr oates then in court was the same man

sir richard barker deposed

that he had known dr oates from a child and that his servants told him that they had seen him about a year ago and that he himself had not seen him which he wondred at having lately seen his father who said nothing of it and that he the vvitness had thoughts of bestowing a living upon him
it was in

at the vvitnesses coming home that he was told by his servant of dr oates being there and of his dress but upon enquiry what message he had left it was answered that he only asked for the vvitness and for dr tongue and this was in the beginning of may was twelvemonth
mr langhorne seemed to admire that the vvitness should intend him a benefice under these circumstances
sir richard barker was certain that this was in and informed the court likewise that a grandson of sir william thorold now sr william thorold and two or three of the vniversity had a conversation with dr oates at the same time which he presented only as a circumstance

mr clay deposed

that he had known dr oates since april last was twelvemonth and that he had seen him twice in april and may at the house of mr charles howard which was a part of that was since turn'd into a street he remembring it by this token that mr charles howard told the vvitness he had been at st omers and was now come over again and that he had some inclinations of entring into the society but that he thought he should put him off the witness declaring himself to be of the church but not of the court of rome
and that he was certain that this was in
mr langhorne desired to know whether mr clay rememberd any thing of dr oates playing at that time with mr howards son or talking to him about his book or asking him questions but mr clay remembred nothing of it nor that mr howards son was in the room

mr smith deposed

that dr oates had been his scholar that he knew him before the fire of london and that dr oates gave him a visit and dined with him at islington at the beginning of may the first monday in may as he remembred and that he was with him or hours
that the vvitnesses wife was there and that they discours'd of dr oates travels into spain valadolid and salamanca that he had a cinnamon coloured suit on and green ribbands

mr charles howard declareth

that he knew dr oates very well and that he had known him upward of two years and that he had been divers times at and particularly about two years ago
that he remembred him there after iuly was twelvemonth but not in may and that the vvitnesses son dy'd in may
mr howard declaring that in april his child was living and that dr oates and mr clay dined there with him dr oates affirming that he had not been two years acquainted with mr clay mr clay alledging that he never knew dr oates before the end of april last year and likewise that mr howard had a son yet living at that time
dr oates informing the court that one son of his was dead a twelvemonth before mr clay and dr oates met there
mr howard explaining himself that he spake of his eldest son who deceased two years since

mr langhorne being called upon to speak what he had to say

represented his case that he was accused by two vvitnesses the first mr oates against whom if he could prove any thing false given in evidence he conceived that he ought not to be regarded
as for sir tho prestons coming over with him in april it hath been clearly made out that he was then at liege and for sr iohn warner mr pool and others coming in the same passage he said that the falsity was proved against him beyond dispute
then as to himself it was proved likewise that he was sick in the infirmary after mr hilsley was come away he deposing that they came together
these particulars being clearly proved he thought sufficient to take off dr oates credit averring also that from november to that minute he never set eye on him
the prisoner set forth

that he had been a great while kept close and but one week allowed him to prepare his defence and therefore depending that he would have delivered the same things here which he has publish'd in his narratives all that the prisoner could do was to arm himself as well as he could against these points
mr langhorne did likewise tell the court that he had seen dr oates in michaelmas term once or twice and that he brought him a letter from his yonger son in spain
he told the prisoner that he would go over to st omers for he could not get himself admitted into any of the colleges in spain
he affirmed that since that day till now in the court he never saw him nor knew a face of any of the witnesses from st omers and that he hoped the iury could not look upon those youths as capable of driving on a design or aiming at a reward
it was reflected they were all papists and in a common causes
mr langhorne offer'd to that objection that if the one side ought not to be credited as being papists and friends so neither was the other as being enemies
if it were clear that he neither lodg'd at groves nor came over with hilsley or that neither sir thomas preston warner or poole came with him that then his evidence ought not to be look'd upon as valuable

and then as to mr bedloes evidence

it may be considered first there is no proving of a negative secondly that the prisoner had no acquaintance with him nor can say that in his whole life he ever saw him before this occasion but yet tis possible that he might see him and not know it
is it probable now says mr langhorne that the prisoner if he were guilty would ever have taken mr bedloe into a confidence in a privacy of this nature or that a person of the prisoners practice should spend his time in registring letters and keeping accounts for any particular religious order if the prisoner could have known his charge he might have accommodated his defence to it and the vvitnesses that he had were only such as his friends thought might be beneficial to him
the other side having had all advantages of bringing their vvitnesses together
the prisoner suggested further that if he fell under any prejudice for his religion it would look as if he suffer'd for that
concluding with this declaration that he did believe it damnation to any one that should go about to kill the king or deprive him of his government and he recommended the rest to the court and to the iury
and the lord chief iustice hereupon gave directions to the iury with his usual candor and gravity
after directions given the court reflected upon a letter found amongst harcourts papers which had been made use of in the trials of the day before and was found six or seven days after dr oates information of a plot to the council
this letter the court order'd to be read as a paper that might give some light to the general designe and it was read accordingly

honoured dear sir

have but time

see the history of the defence of whitebread fol

the letter being read mr langhorne offer'd that dr oates might easily have explained it being no other than such a summons to this meeting as brought these over from st omers that attended it and for the design it was no more than the holding of a congregation like that of a dean and chapter in a college and for the caution of secrecy it was but reasonable where the discovery was dangerous

the iury was now sent out to advise upon their virdict

and after a little time they brought in mr langhorne guilty and then the prisoners before convicted were brought to the barr by the direction of mr recorder to receive iudgment which was past upon them to be drawn hang'd and quarter'd according to the common form
which sentence was executed upon the five priests and iesuites on the of iune and upon mr langhorne on the th of iuly
the history of the charge and defence of robert green henry berry and lawrence hill

the three prisoners having been arraigned at the barr

on the fifth of february for the murther of sir edmond bury godfrey the grand iury for the county of middlesex having found the indictment two days before they were upon the tenth of the same month brought again to the barr to receive their trials when his majesties council having open'd the indictment the kings vvitnesses were called and dr oates first sworn who gave evidence

that he applied himself to sir edmondh
godfrey september the sixth last past

with certain informations and having made oath to the truth thereof he carried the record back again and september the th repaired to sir edmond godfrey with two or three perfect copies and swore them also
this being done the vvitness gave information thereof to the council after which sir edmond came unto the vvitness september the th as he remembers and told him what he had got some reproaching and threatning him for doing so much and others for doing so little and that the parliament should be acquainted with it being to meet on the one and twentieth of october ensuing

the vvitness also swears

that about a week before sir edmond was wanting he told the vvitness that some popish lords menac'd him for medling in the business
that he had great apprehensions of mischief from the papist party and he told the vvitness how he had been watched for several days
the vvitness asked him why he went without a servant he had one he said but he was a pitiful weak creature the vvitness then advising him to get him some smart lad to wait upon him but he gave little heed to it telling him that he did not fear any man upon the square but still he would be talking to the vvitness of the danger that he was in who gave him this consolation that if it should be his lot to suffer it would be in a righteous cause
thomas robinson esquire was sworn

and deposed that sir edmond and himself had been at westminster and for above forty years of a continued acquaintance saving only in the late vvar and for the peace

that having been together at westminster october the th upon the rising of the court they went to dinner with the head baily

they had a great deal of talk there concerning the plot

that this vvitness told sir edmondb that it was said he had taken several depositions about it
to which he made answer that he had done more in it than he thought he should have thanks for and that he could have been well content if it had fallen into some other hand
this vvitness telling him that he had but done his duty and desiring a sight of the examinations if he had them about him
but his answer was that a great person had them and that when he got them again the vvitness should see them
they both agreed that they were not yet at the bottom of it but upon my conscience said sir edmondb
believe that shall be the first mariyr adding that no man should have his life neither upon easie terms
the vvitness advising him to go with a man and he not liking it
mr prance was then sworn

who declared

that before sir edmond was murther'd for a fortnight or three weeks there were several meetings at the where was green girald and kelly and that the two latter who were priests drew the vvitness in

perswading him that it was no sin but rather a piece of charity for he was a busie man and would be very troublesome
these words passed at the plow and at the waterside some week or fortnight befor the murther
upon the meeting of green hill and girald they came to a resolution that who ever saw him first should immediately give notice to the rest that they might be ready for him
girlad kelly and green said in the vvitnesses hearing that they had dogg'd him into the fields

but had no opportunity to kill him there
on a mr kelly came to the vvitness and told him that they were then watching of him and told the vvitness afterwards that either hill or green had been at his house to enquire for him but the servant telling him sir edmond was not up he left word that he would come again by and by after this they waited their time and then dogg'd him as girald and green told this vvitness but whether it was green or hill that went he could not say
and that day girald green and hill dogg'd him from one place to another and so into st clements

about seven of the clock green told the vvitness where sir edmond was and he hasten'd away from his own house to immediately the vvitness living in not far off
where he was at st clements this vvitness cannot tell

towards nine a clock notice was given to hill who came before that the vvitness was to be in readiness

presently upon this hill went away to the gate and as sir edmond was passing by he desired him to try if he could quiet two fellows yonder that were quarrelling

which he was loath to do but hill pressing it that the authority of a iustice might make them friends sir edmond went along with him and as he was at the bottom of the railes green got a handkercher about his neck

which he had twisted and there pulled him over and punched him and choak'd him
girald would have run him through with his sword but the rest were against it for fear that it should be found out by the blood

the vvitness went to the body a matter of a quarter of an hour after and handling it perceived that he had life in him yet for his legs quivered

but then green took him by the neck and turned it quite round
the vvitness does not say that he saw him do this but green made his brags of it and the rest told the vvitness of it too
the witness was ordered by hill to stand at the and berry looked to the stairs they did all four tell the vvitness of the twisting of his neck and they were about the body when the vvitness went down
berry was not there at first but he came before they had him into the house and helped to carry him up and so did this vvitness with the rest
that is to say girald green hill kelly berry and the vvitness did all put their helping hands
he was carried into dr godwins house where hill that had been the doctors man had a chamber and he went before to get the door open while the rest brought the body the body was kept there till munday night and then it was laid in where this vvitness saw it by hills they were all there and upon tuesday night the body was removed again into hills lodgings in a court below there
what was thrown over him this vvitness does not know hill had a which was all the light there was but the vvitness was certain that it was sir edmund godfreys body
it should have been laid in hills lodgings but some body being there they conveyed it into a room that was overagainst it sir iohn arundels lodgings as he thought
about nine on wednesday night as they were carrying it into the chamber where it was first this vvitness had the hap to come just at that time which started them so that they ran away but upon the vvitnesses speaking berry returned and the body was got up and so carried off about midnight in a sedan

it was hill that brought the sedan and all the company helped to get him into it
girald and the vvitness took him up first berry stood ready upon a hemm to open the gate and so he was carried out at the vpper court gate green and kelly went before and they took him up in to ease the other in longacre the vvitness and his companion took him up again and carried him on as far as soho church
hill was ready there with a horse

and there the body was set up astride and hill rode behind it holding it up green hill girald and kelly went along with him the sedan being put into a house till they returned

the next morning hill kelly and girald told the vvitness that they had thrust his sword through his body cast him into a ditch and his gloves and things were laid upon the bank

as to their meeting at bow it was at one cashes the there was one leueson vernat the vvitness mr girald and one dethick that mr vernat sent for by a cobler and he came immediately
there was a barrel of oysters for dinner

and a dish of fish that the witness bought himself and it was the friday after the proclamation for sending all papists out of town
the pretence of this meeting as mr vernat told the vvitness was only to be merry

while the company was making merry the vvitnesshearing somthing rustle at the door

he went and found a drawer hearkning there and told him he had a good mind to kick him down stairs and so went away
the vvitness says that hill and berry were in the business before him as girald said with whom the vvitness had been several times at berries house they met twice at the plow and the second time hill

was there
they said there was a great reward promised but this witness cannot tell what
girald

had taken up a full resolution to destroy him that night and rather than fail he would have killed him in the street in the lane that goes down to his house
mr prance being questioned about mr bedlow declared that before the vvitness was in prison he cannot remember that ever he was in mr bedlows company

mr hill

desired the court that prances evidence might not be admitted against him because he had denyed all to the king that he had before confessed and so was perjured but he was answered that his confession was not upon oath
hill asked prance what time it was he went to sir edmond godfreys who answered that it was nine or ten a clock
hill affirmed that he had not been abroad that day and denied every syllable
then berry askt prance what people were in the house when he said he was there and bad him name any and prance told him that his wife was there and girald kelly and the vvitness
but berry could not deny the knowing of prance no more could hill nor green
prance could give no account from whence they hounded him when they murthered him he was carried into the house some quarter of an hour after he was killed being taken and by surprise strangled

captain richardson was asked what he knew of prances

denying what he had consested who declared that he was ordered the night before the last parliament was prorogued to carry prance before the committee of lords to be examined how that he was in great disorder and earnest to speak with his majesty and that being brought into kings closset he threw himself upon his knees and cryed he was innocent and they were all innocent and he said as much to the council denying upon the question that any body had tampered with him
that so soon as ever he was in the prison again he begged of captain richardson that for gods sake he would go tell the king that all he had now said was false and that true which he before made oath of and if he might have his pardon he would make a considerable discovery
that he recanted purely out of fear that he had lost all his custom among the catholicks and though the king should pardon him they would go near to murther him
and captain richardson declared that after his pardon he demeaned himself very quietly and expressing a great detestation of the practices in the church of rome
mr bedlow sworn

who declared that le faire pritchard

and divers priests besides had dealt with him for the killing of a person without naming the man and that he should have help and a good reward and that this was in october or september last
after which le faire pritchard and welch put him upon working himself into an acquaintance with sir edmond godfrey

that this vvitness having introduced himself into a familiarity with sir edmund insomuch that he had been at his house for about a week together day after day they would have had the vvitness have brought them into his company too
that he made his acquaintance by going to him for warrants against people and this vvitness had been with him every day but saturday the week before he was murthered
that upon friday the day before the vvitness sent his boy to know if he were at home with an intent to have gotten him over to the grey hound tavern where the confederates then were five iesuits but he was not at home and so le faire welch and the vvitness went into

the city
that le faire having been next morning at the vvitnesses chamber and missing him they met by chance in the afternoon in and so they went to the palsgraves head taverns together where upon discourse he told the vvitness there was a very considerable man who was that night to be put out of the way that was the expression for he had gotten all the informations of dr oates and dr tonge and if these papers were not taken from him there would be such discoveries made as would endanger the whole design
the vvitness could not get it from him who he was but there had been several plots upon him and none of them had hit and that mr coleman had orders to pay for the service
the vvitness parted with him then upon his promise to come to him at cloyster that night but the vvitness knowing the business failed him and saw him not again till munday night in red lion court where he met him
he charged the vvitness with not keeping his word who told him that he fell into other company and besides that he could not ingage to kill any man without knowing first

who it was
well says he to the vvitness be you at nine a clock to night at and you shall hear more
the vvitness went punctually at his time and they had a great deal of discourse together in the cloyster from thence he walked the witness into the court and chid him for not assisting in that affair

but however if you will lend us your hand now said he to get him off you shall have two thousand pounds of the four
the vvitness then asking if he were murthered he answered yes
the vvitness then demanded if he might not see him he told him that he might and so he led him by the hand through a dark passage into the place where the body lay

there were several people in the room but how many and who they were he could not say
there was no light in it but a lanthorn and by that the vvitness could discern the body
there was a cravat about his neck drawn so streight that the vvitness could not get his finger betwixt
they had some discourse then of getting him away pretending him to be one that was related to a person of quallity
the vvitness was very much surprised when he found who it was and urged the dropping of him into the thames with weights to sink him

but they rather chose to have it put upon himself and to carry him out in a chair and the porter berry should be ready at the gate to let them out
they owned that they had strangled him and would have had the vvitness to help them out with him
but he excused himself as being yet too early and that it were better to stay till about eleven or twelve a clock promising to be with them again but says le faire upon the sacrament you took on thursday you will be at the carrying him off to night which the witness promised and so they parted

this lay heavy upon the vvitnesses conscience who could not resolve to discover that which he had taken two sacraments in a week to conceal
in this trouble of thought the vvitness went to bristol where god put it into his heart that some murthers were past and greater to come for the prevention whereof he was at last convinced of the duty of revealing this wickedness and so made his application to the king and parliament thereupon
meeting prance afterward in the lobby and there apprehending him
mr bedlow declared also that he saw green was about the court the night when the body was to be carryed away and that he heard berry was to open the gate but they finding that the vvitness had again

disappointed them put it off that night for fear of further obstruction

reported the matter how that finding the croud to be great in the lords lobby and being desirous himself to be private he bad the guard clear the room of all that had no business there an order was given for all to quit but mr bedlow and his friends when seeing a man lift up his hat to find out his way and finding it to be prance the vvitness charged his guards with him but he being then in custody and the constable telling him that he was his prisoner the vvitness bad him have a care of him and afterwards charged him before the house of lords
as to the prisoners hill said that he never saw mr bedlow and berry that he never saw mr girald

the constable was then sworn

about the finding sir edmund godfreys body whose evidence was that the body was found in a ditch his sword sticking in it and two handfuls through his back neither the sword nor the place where it lay was bloody
he had a thrust in another place but striking upon a rib it passed no further and there was no blood there neither
his breast was bruised his neck broken as the vvitness believed his gloves and stick by him upon the bank his servant said that it was his masters sword and he had both gold and silver in his pocket

that the breast was bruised as with blows or stamping on it his neck distorted two wounds one fell on a rib and the other past through his body but he never dyed of those wounds and neither his cloths nor his wastcoat were pierced his neck was certainly broken and probably he might be dead four or five days before these wounds were given upon the opening of him it appeared that he began to putrifie
mr cambridge another chirurgeon was sworn who deposed that he saw the body on the same day with mr skillard the neck displaced bruised upon the breast one wound on a rib and another that past through him under the left pap which wounds were undoubtedly given him after he was dead

which hill also denyed the vvitness particularly remembring that she was then doing somthing about the fire in the parlour that she gave her master his breakfast there hill being with him and then went up stairs and missing her keys came down again and found them upon the parlour table and hill was yet there in the very cloths he had on in the court about nine or ten a clock which agreed with prances evidence hill acknowledging that he had not changed his clothes but objecting that she said in newgate she never saw him and undertaking to prove that he was elsewhere

that morning and about a month after she saw him in newgate

but there was another man that brought a note for sir edmond godfrey

the night before which her master had and she knows not what became of it
the man came on friday night with a letter in his hand tyed up and asked for her master the vvitness telling him that he was at home but busie

the witness carried the letter and delivered it to the gentleman telling him whence it came
so he lookt upon it and bad the vvitness tell them that he would come to them presently so the vvitness returned and found the gentleman there still that sent him
they gave him a glass of wine and paid him and so he went away

mr prance went thus far ready and directly but coming to examine the place whither they had carried the body he said it was somwhere by the garden

sir robert southwel now produced the minutes he had taken upon these mens examinations wherein it appeared that hill was examined that he confest he knew girald but not kelly hill then interposing that he knew one girald who was not a priest and that he did not know girald the priest

it was charged upon berry

to which berry replyed that the might have entred if he had pleased that it had been proved as was acknowledged by the court that five or six had gone in before
that he had an order only for two days as he remembred and that he had had such orders formerly
but there being no such orders produced the court reflected upon the pretence as the best artifice they could invent to keep the design private

the kings council having heard the prisoners and their vvitnesses

summ'd up the evidence and the lord chief iustice gave directions to the jury who brought them all in guilty and they receiv'd sentence the day following to be severally hang'd by the neck till they were dead
and upon the one and twentieth of the same month they were accordingly executed
the history of the charge and defence of sr george wakeman william rumly william marshal and iames corker

on the eighteenth of iuly sir george wakeman william rumly william marshall and iames corker were brought to their trials at the in the

upon an indictment for conspiring the death of the king and the subversion of the government and the protestant religion
but iames corker was first brought to the barr having been arraigned the former sessions
the jury being sworn and admitted without exception the kings council as is usual opened the indictment and mr dugdale was first produced and sworn
and first as to the plot in general

mr dugdale deposed

that he had some inckling of the plot seven years ago but that ewers gavan peters leueson had more particularly acquainted him with it about two years since and drew him into the design upon the government and religion and upon killing the king and the duke of monmouth
that all harcourts letters were directed to the vvitness eight or nine at a time and almost all of them were concerning the plot

the scope of the letters were to instruct ewers how to proceed towards the getting of money

and engaging the gentlemen of the country to serve as officers in the army which was to be raised upon the death of the king
that he saw receipts from st omers of money paid to that end
that he received a letter directed to himself which came from harcourt but who wrote it he could not say or if it had any date or no only he supposes that it came from to london and so to him
it gave caution to say nothing of arms till the king was dead
he deposed a correspondency thrice a week betwixt the conspirators in london and the staffordshire agents and in a letter from whitebread ewers was charged to choose stout and hardy men

with this expression in the letter to kill the king which letter was sent by the common post and superscribed to mr dugdale who vvas sworn to secrecy by mr ewers at least ten times
and the vvitness took the sacrament upon it

he deposeth also

that gavan leueson ewers and my lord stafford would have had the vvitness destroy the king by shooting dagger or the like not so as to do it directly himself but to come to london for directions how to do it where mr ireland was to have him in his care and that he was to have come in october last the resolution being taken the iuly before
this vvitness also deposed that the lord stafford promised him five hundred pounds in hand upon his coming to london in october for an incouragement but that a more considerable reward vvas to follow and that he should have come to london if it had not been discovered

he deposeth further

that he found ewers reading a letter from london with these words in it this very night sir godfrey is dispatch'd and that it was dated the very night that he was killed ewers shewing the prisoner the letter and telling him also that sir godfry was grown too inquisitive into the plot and it would be well to take him off
deposing also that mr ewers shew'd the prisoner the letter to comfort him that one enemy was gone and the vvitness reporting it again to the minister of the place

he deposed further

that the protestants were to be destroyed and that they had great confidence in the vvitness he having given them four hundred pounds and promised another hundred to pray for his soul and land made over to mr girald to raise the money upon the sale

mr corker demanded

from whom the dangerous letter before mentioned came and the vvitness not presently recollecting it the prisoner appealed to the court upon the improbability of sending such a letter by the common post and yet no appearance either to whom or from whom it came

but mr dugdale rendred an account of other letters one from paris to st omers and thence to london and so to tixall where it was read in the presence of the prisoner by the lord aston and mr ewers it was subscribed and thought to be from sir iohn warner that it was dated from paris whence they advised the casting of it on the presbyterians after the death of the king which would make the church of england men fall in with the papists to destroy the party
this was the paris letter and the london letter approv'd the advice with several lords hands to them in allowance of the design of killing the king and raising an army

the prisoner asked

if it were dated from st omers and mr dugdale reply'd that in the pacquet from st omers there were three letters paris st omers and london one from each and all in one cover being cover'd in groves pacquet the vvitness averring that he himself was to be of the party that should kill the king in october
the prisoner here made a reflection that dr oates mentioned only three designs to kill the king by grove and pickering by the ruffians and by poyson and that now a fourth was found out in october when the design was charged upon iuly or august but it was reply'd upon him that there might be more plots than docter oates knew of

mr marshall offer'd that the vvitnesses testimony was suspicious even from the multitude of persons employed and intrusted and nothing done upon it where yet a few might have done the business
the prisoners were here ordered to wait their time without interposing that

the kings evidence might be first heard whereupon the prisoners desired pen ink and paper which was granted them and so the court proceeded
it was much wondred that any body should write by the common post about killing the king
to which mr dugdale answered that in case of discovery it was to be cast upon him and that he was under an oath to deny it affirming that the very words were for the killing of the king

without any superscription to ewers or name to the letters
the prisoners joyned in admiration at the folly and madness of any man in putting such words in a letter

mr dugdale proceeded

that whitebread letter was directed to himself and that it came in company with others that there was a black cross upon what he was to deliver to ewers and that he was to disperse them where they were to go
but being ask'd by what mark he should know whither to send them the witness answered that mr ewers knew their hands and what every thing meant and for whom it was
to the question of how many letters the witness answered that in two years he believed he had a hundred and mr rumley asking him from how many persons and wondring that he had none of them to produce mr dugdale answered that there were a great many from sir iohn warner and that so long as he intended to go on with the plot he burnt them all but that he had spoken what he could remember
he deny'd the seeing of any commissions but affirmed that he spake with some that were to be officers

mr prance deposed

that some three weeks before michaelmas he heard fenwick and grove at mr irelands chamber talking of raising men and settling popery mr fenwick saying that it would be easily done and encouraging the prisoner being a silver smith with the hope of work enough about crucifixes candlesticks naming the lords that were to command the army and after that he was told of commissions given out
he deposed further that my lord arundels butler told him that one messenger was to murther the king and this witness meeting mr messenger and asking him the question he was surprised at it and said to this witness pray keep counsel for we are off of that now

mr iennison deposed

that in iune upon a discourse with mr ireland in about religion his sister mrs aune ireland being by mr ireland spake as if the romish religion would be quickly settled in england for there was but one stood in the way and the king might be easily poyson'd
whereupon this witness speaking of it as a horrid thing mrs ireland asked her brother why he talkt at that rate and he qualified the matter as a thing which he thought should not be done and then the witness minding him of the gunpowder treason he said it was only a trick of cecils
the witness being at that time a roman catholick but since converted

the vvitness deposeth further

that he saw mr ireland positively on the th day of august being then newly returned from windsor as he remembers punctually upon very particular circumstances
the court looking upon this evidence as a most eminent confutation of what ireland affirmed at his death which was that betwixt the third of august and toward the middle of september he was never in town but all that time in
mr iennison then proceeding that upon the th aforesaid he saw mr ireland draw off his boots at his own chamber upon the frame of a table as the witness remembers being come post as he said out of betimes that morning
that the vvitness telling him upon his question where he had been

and what news that he had been at windsor and that the king was early up in a morning went a fishing and hawking the vvitness telling him of his own accord that his majesty had but very little company with him
mr ireland reflected upon the kings going so thinly guarded

saying that he might be easily taken off
the witness replying god forbid and then mr ireland smoothing it over this witness thought no more on it till the plot was discover'd and then he told his father and his sisters this discourse saying that it was very suspicoius
this vvitness was very sure it was the th and knew mr ireland very well having been acquainted with him a year and an half and he went out of town september the th into the north
mr corker asking the vvitness when he turned protestant and objecting that he did not for sake his religion till he found it might be for his advantage
mr bowes was then sworn who declared that he saw mr iennison in tunbridge about the beginning or middle of august that he went then from tunbridge
that the vvitness went to windsor august the th or th and that mr iennison came to windsor when the witness was out of town
mr burnett deposes that about the middle of august the very day of he met mr iennison on his way to windsor
the court declaring this to be a point that did not concern the prisoners but to shew the falsity of irelands affirmation

dr oates then made oath

that mr ashby coming sick to town in iuly sir george wakeman prescribed him a course how he should govern himself both before he went to bath and there
that he should take a pint of milk morning and evening and drink nothing else in the morning and at the bath to have a hundred strokes at the pump sir george telling him in this letter who would help him to poyson the king
some two days after the vvitness saw sr george lay by his pen and leave the paper upon the table with the ink wet upon it which was an apothecaries bill as he supposed and the same character with the letter to mr ashby and the vvitness swears that as sir george wrote mr ashby discours'd to him of a commission received for physitian to the army which the witness saw at mr ashby's in sr george's hand¬∑ he deposed further that he heard one promise to help sir george in the promoting the catholick cause and in the poysoning of the king and that he heard ashby in the provincials name offer to sir george for his reward
this was in iuly harcourt fenwick ireland and the witness present

he deposeth

that sir george said that it was not enough for poysoning the king and so refused it and that the fathers met on purpose to deal with sir george about it before mr ashby went to the bath and that upon sr george's refusal they acquainted mr whitebread with it who presently gave the commission to offer more which as this vvitness is informed was accepted and of it paid down the vvitness having seen sir georges name subscribed to the wherein was specified such a proposal to sr george with his acceptance of and receipt in part of the receipt from harcourt by colemans order and the goldsmith as this vvitness remembers was stayly sir georges hand to the receipt with a memorandum of the day in august when it was propounded and accepted
the it self being in the fathers custody at but who kept it this vvitness could not say only that mr langhorne had it sometimes and that the acceptance and receipt were entred the same day

dr oates saith not that he ever saw sr george write

but that he saw him lay aside a pen and a paper newly written and no body by that could write it but himself
and sr george charging him with declaring that he did not know the prisoners hand the doctor affirmed that a letter that he saw signed wakeman was the same with that of the receipt and the
sir george demanded a positive answer

if the vvitness had not deny'd the knowledge of his hand and the knowledge also of his very person before his majesty and council to which dr oates made answer that he was so doz'd with sitting up and his intellectuals so disordered for want of sleep that perhaps he might speak short before the council

but now that he had light to see sr george's face he could say more to him
the doctor affirming the prisoner to be the same gentleman and desiring that what he had to ask might be put to the court the doctor not calling to mind whether he said he knew sir george or not but affirming this to be the person that was called sir george wakeman but not able to say that it was the person that attended the council when the witness was there
the doctor deposing likewise that he saw sir george two several days at mr ashbyes chamber and that he never saw him before and but once after which was at when the was offer'd where mr ashby lay in iuly before he went to the bath which was about the end of iuly or beginning of august his stay in town being about fourteen or sixteen days

the prisoner asking the vvitness then

if he knew all this when he was before the council why he said there that he knew nothing of the prisoner but about one letter from ashby to fenwick and objecting that if this evidence had been given there he must doubtless have been committed but the prisoner was directed to reservo what he had to say till his proper time and the doctor referred his answer also to its proper place

touching mr corker

dr oates deposed him to be a benedictine monk privy to the raised for this designe and that in august last he sent his consent out of germany to the proposal of raising it being president of the benedictines
that he gave the english monks in paris and la chaise an account how matters went forward in england and that he had a patent to be bishop of london which the vvitness saw in his own hands
that this letter out of germany he had seen and that it was addressed either to hitchcott or another father in london

the witness deposing moreover

that as he remembers mr corker went over in iuly to lamspring in germany but that in iune he saw him with mr fenwick and that upon discourse about some body that was behind in his pension mr corker gave mr fenwick an order for some or to be received of mr langhorne the order subscribed iames corker the vvitness first seeing this order
and another time his name to an examination which agreed with his letter from germany
deposing further that the prisoner disposed of several parcels of money as he said for the advancing of the design

that the prisoner was also privy to the consultation of april

and excepted against the choice of pickering to kill the king because while he was attending at high mass an opportunity might be lost
that this exception was at the convent in the savoy to the vvitness himself and at the same time when he gave fenwick his order for money the was to be advanced upon the benedictines estates and the witness believed it was paid for the fathers acknowledged the receipt of

it and that though mr corker was against mr pickerings doing of it he did yet approve of the thing it self

dr oates charged mr marshall also with being present when the was resolv'd upon

and with pickerings design upon the king making the same exception against him with corker but he could not say positively that mr marshal was at the consult
dr oates deposed that mr rumley knew of the consult for the being either a benedictine monk or a believing that he consented to it because he prayed for the success and that this was in august

the prisoners being now allowed to make their objections

mr corker inform'd the court that lamspring was not in germany as the vvitness said but in westphalia and urg'd an inconsistence of that story and his seeing la chaise
to which dr oates reply'd that it was usual with them to say they would go to one place when they went to another

dr oates call'd one thing more to mind

that conyers laying a wager with another gentleman that the king should eat no more christmas mr marshall went half with mr conyers that he should not
mr marshall ask'd how long the vvitness had known him and where he had ever been with him dr oates answering that he had seen him often at the altar but had no acquaintance with him that he had known him off and on two years but never heard him speak till the time of the wager but had only a knowledge of him by sight
mr marshall seeming to admire that the vvitness taking him to be in the plot should never converse with him
mr marshall demanded the time and the place of the consult which the doctor told him was in august and either the day before or after the feast of the assumption and the place the savoy

the vvitness charged the prisoner also with another consult in aug

of the the former being the th at which time came letters from talbot of the state of ireland
it was dated from dublin but it was not tax'd at the as an irish letter
he also deposed that there were some benedictines and iesuites and mr marshall in the company who agreed at the same time about sending commissions for the the letter was read at the convent and the commissions order'd for ireland and the poysoning of the duke of ormond was also agreed upon

dr oates was ask'd the time of pickering being taken

and if he himself was present who answer'd that he was taken upon michaelmass eve or morning and that he the witness was there
it was demanded of dr oates what consults he was at who answer'd that there were two consults of the th and of aug but that the witness was not at the consult for the to sir george wakeman

mr bedlve deposed

that about the beginning of august last he the witness was at mr harcourts chamber and sir george wakeman came thither after much out of humor and asked mr harcourt if he had not something for him whereupon mr harcourt demanding of him how he went on sir george answer'd him short that that he did not know whether he should go on or no for he did not love to be trifled with in such a business stay sir george says mr harcourt things are better than you imagine and so took some papers out of his cabinet and a small bill asking sir george what readiness he was in for says he we have been ready a good while
sr george asking harcourt what that bill was he said it was a bill of from a person whom this vvitness

has forgot and drawn upon a goldsmith as he believed somewhere near
that sir george reading it and discoursing upon it enquired of mr harcourt who this vvitness was mr harcourt telling him that it was a friend had been long in the plot and was to have a very great part in it himself
sir george then telling him as this vvitness deposes that if the bill were accepted he should hear from him suddenly and so he went his way this vvitness going presently after him and meeting sr george wakeman again betwixt the and from whence the vvitness concluded it to be near mr harcourts lodgings being but in sir george told the vvitness that the bill was accepted and that afternoon the money should be paid
this deponent affirming that he had known sr geo a matter of years though not much acquainted with him

he deposeth further

that upon asking whether or no this was in part of the
mr harcourt made answer that it was only for the present the other being not settled as yet but the vvitness affirms that shortly after it was made and that mr harcourt told the deponent that it was all upon the same account and if windsor and this should both fail the work would be done at

mr bedloe deposed

that he had been once in company with mr corker keines and le fevre at and that he did not hear any thing from mr corker that pointed directly at the murther of the king but that he heard corker and le fevre talking in general about the plot and letters of intelligence and talking of raising an army and who were sent to agitate in the country what interests they had made and the like
and this was about iuly was twelvemonth

mr bedloe moreover deposeth

that he knew mr marshall when he saw him in the and that he had been in his company in latham chamber several times that he carried several letters to the catholick party that were in this design which letters this witness brought over from and more particulary one to sr fra ratcliffe
that all the letters this witness brought to the fathers spake to the point of subverting the government and religion of england
that mr marshall was of the club that saw the letters and examin'd the answers and that to this vvitnesses knowledge the prisoner sent letters twice concerning the destruction of the government and the bringing in of popery

mr bedloe could say nothing positively as to mr rumly

but that he had heard of his sending of letters and of his being intrusted when any secret ones were sent but that he could not swear mr rumlyes privity to any letters relating to the plot

sir wakeman ask'd mr bedloe what day it was that he saw him with harcourt when he read the bill

and how he knew it was for this mony and what acquaintance the prisoner had with the witness to vvhich mr bedloe answer'd that it vvas about the beginning of aug and he knevv it to be a bill for the prisoner read it aloud and that though the witness had no acquaintance vvith him yet mr harcourt inform'd him vvho the vvitness vvas

sr george urging

hovv unlikely it vvas that he should put his life into any mans hand at first sight but mr bedloe reply'd that he vvould have done a great deal more upon mr harcourts security
adding that he had forgotten the goldsmiths name and the gentlemans who subscribed the note also affirming that though sr geo would not own the knowing of him yet he had been the witnesses physitian at the bath about years ago
sir wakeman reflecting upon several marks of falshood in the evidence

mr marshall urg'd mr bedlow to say when ever he saw him

before he came to him in the deni'd his owning the knowledge of him and affirmed that mr bedlow acknowledged himself a stranger to the prisoner appealing to those in the prison that heard it
and likewise the prisoner affirmed that mr bedlow coming to him used these words mr marshall do not fear for will not hurt you and so prest it upon mr bedlow to say where ever he had seen him

mr bedlow's answer was that he had seen him at the benedictines in the savoy

and that the first word the witness said upon coming into the was this is mr marshall that us'd to carry letters to such and such referring himself to sir waller to attest it

sir waller gave evidence that mr bedlow

in his hearing in the spake to the prisoner asking him mr marshall do not you know me and mr marshall answered that he did not know him but yet that he had seen him mr marshall suggesting to sir william that mr bedlow was gone before he came in and sir william affirming that he was with mr marshall before mr bedlow came in
mr marshall insisting upon it that he was in a private room with mr bedlow and that sir william asked the prisoner in the common hall if mr bedlow had not been there who told him yes and that those in the did know that the prisoner had been private with mr bedlow before sir william came in

mr bedlow deposed

that going by order to see the prisoner he met sir william waller and went in with him and that they were onely with the prisoner in the common room sir william withdrawing to one end of it while the witness asked the prisoner some questions and mr bedlow calling the prisoner by his name upon the first sight of him
sir william waller also affirmed that mr bedlow did ask him if his name was not marshall

mr marshall telling mr bedlow

that he was first with him in a room on the right hand where his guards were mr bedlow denied that he knew any such room and mr marshall pleaded for himself that he had no proofs there because he could not imagine that such a thing would have been mentioned
the prisoner said that mr bedlow came to the a meer stranger to him and that mr bedlow asking him did not you send to such a one to have mr bedlow questioned about such and such things the prisoner denied it and the witness did not so much as pretend to have any knowledge of him
besides that he might learn his name from those that took him for he deliver'd himself up a prisoner by the name of marshall though he was otherwise called marsh remitting himself to the people in the for the truth of what passed there
and that the witness had him have a good heart for he should have an honourable bench and a good iury

but mr bedlow on the other side affirmed that without hearing of his name at all he said as soon as ever he saw him this is marshall the benedictine and moreover that he had seen the prisoner at the savoy and at other places
marshall bidding him name any other place and he would suffer death for it
but mr bedlow would not be positive in any other place

but that he remembred the savoy more remarkably as the place of their consults about the letters he carried thither and that it was there he had the greatest conversation with the prisoner
mr marshall telling the witness that if he could but make it out by any creature that ever he the witness was in the savoy he would submit to be hang'd without a word speaking
mr bedlow replying first that he had witnesses though they were not at hand and then that it was a thing sworn before the secret committees
but however

the witness nam'd his landlord as one that had been often with him there in the convent and with his maid that carry'd the portmantle with his letters beyond seas
and moreover that he lodg'd some six months in the savoy at one woodroff
the prisoner asking him if it were there that he saw him mr bedlow said no for onely monks and messengers came thither
the prisoner asking him also if he were present at the search of the savoy he said he was not but yet that he gave directions to sir william waller where to look

sir william waller deposed that he had his directions from dr oates and mr bedlow where pickering lay

and to search such and such places and by those directions he searched the savoy and that this description was made before mr marshall was seiz'd some two or three days
upon which it was urg'd that such a description could not be made by one that had not been there
to which mr marshall reply'd that dr oates had search'd there before and inform'd mr bedlow as might be well enough imagined both of them joyning in the same charge and suggesting how easie it was to describe a house by hearsay
mr bedlow did here declare that it was he that gave sir william waller notice to search particularly under such a bench in pickering quarter for the gun that was made choice of to kill the king and the gun was found accordingly

upon some question of particularities in the evidence

mr bedlow was call'd up again to repeat his testimonie about sir george wakeman which was to the effect as before of his being at harcourt chamber sir george coming in and mr harcourt taking a bill of exchange out of his cabinet and saying sir george there's a bill for you which have receiv'd at to day by the queen's order
sir george replying upon it that he thought his nine years service of her majesty might pretend to deserve it and that there had been no hurt in't if the queen had given him it

mr chapman informed

that one mr thimbilby an infirm person of years of age brought him recommendations to the bath from sir george wakeman
this was the
of iuly last
his business was to get a lodging as near the king and queen's bath as might be which was done
and then he shew'd the witness a letter from sir george whereof the lower part was a direction what to take and how to govern himself at the bath which was now produced in court
that the latin bill the witness kept to himself returning the english part of the letter to mr thimbilby
declaring that both he and his son read the english part and that there was no mention of king or queen in it more then of the king and queen's bath

a paper was then shew'd the witness

and a question upon it if it were sir george hand the witness saying that it was not having severall of his bills to compare it by
that he knew not of any date or name to it and that he did not know whose hand it was
it was then considered that the witnesse's paper could not be the letter dr oates reflected upon having neither sir george hand nor his name to't as was presum'd of the other
sir george wakeman then deny'd the writing any other letter then that of his servant by his dictate which ashby carry'd to the bath and saith that dr oates had charg'd him before the lords but with one letter
and then reasoning upon it that if he had been conscious of any guilt he had time enough to make his escape challenged any man to prove that he had any thing more to do with ashby then as a physician with his patient and alledged that a physician here in the town would testifie that they two had been joyn'd in consultations about him
sir george desiring the iury to take notice that he never wrote any other letter

mr chapman was ask'd

if there was any thing of milk mentioned in that letter who said no and the milk was never prescribed with the waters
dr oates affirmed that the letter he saw was in another hand a kind of a gentile hand
sir george appealing to all the world that milk was direct poyson in the case
but dr oates inform'd the court that he was to take the milk in town
sir george wakeman opposing that it could not be for he staid but two days after the writing of that letter
it came then to be consider'd that this could not be the same letter
dr oates confirming it also and that the prescription of milk was after the first line or two of complement and that there was nothing of a latin recipe in it
sir george wakeman observed to the iury that admitting any other letter then this in court he must write two receipts for the same thing which was very improbable
and that the reason of his hand not being to it was his being ill and asleep when his man who wrote it over again from a foul copy went away with it

mr chapman repeating the order of the prescription

and declaring that he follow'd it at the bath for six days together dr oates deposed that there was no bolus in the other letter nor what bath he should go to as was in this and that therefore it could not be the same letter
besides that it was written above ten days before mr asbby went away
sir george objecting that there was no need of telling him of his course in the bath so long before he went thither

sir george servant inform'd the court

that telling his master that mr ashby desir'd directions for the bath it being well late and his master indisposed he bad the witness take pen and ink and write and making some mistakes his master bad him mend it and so he interlin'd the corrections
that this witness wrote it fair that night and carry'd it next morning before his master wak'd to mr ashby who was then going for the bath
the witness declaring that he knew nothing of mr ashby's drinking of milk onely that a friend of his had advis'd him to it
but dr oates deposed that he himself was with him and that he drank it night and morning
the witnesses for the prisoners were now call'd

and

first elizabeth heveningham who informed that she was by when sir george servant wrote the letter from his master's mouth and that she saw the letter and that there was no such thing in it as is said
wherein the court was satisfy'd as to the truth of the evidence but that this could not be the same letter dr oates spoke of for that was written ten days before mr ashby went to the bath
whereupon mrs heveningham affirm'd that mr ashby said in her hearing that he wanted directions

sir george wakeman pleaded

that he was left at liberty days after he had been before the councell and that upon dr oates bringing an information upon the letter now in question to the house of commons bar they sent an address to the lords with admiration that the present prisoner was not confined and that thereupon dr oates was sent for to the lords bar to repeat the story and mentioning the letter now in debate he consest there that he did not know sir george wakeman hand and onely knew it to be his letter by being subscribed wakeman
sir george reasoning upon it that the witness would have told more if he had known it at that examination

dr oates depos'd

that sir was left at liberty because the witness was so weak and distemper'd with watching and toiling about that

he could not perfect his charge and that he the dr did speak the whole truth of his knowledge as far as he was able denying that he said he onely knew sir george hand because george wakeman was subscribed
which sir opposed and offer'd to make good his contradiction by the record
dr oates deposed that he could not perfectly remember the very words but that if the prisoner prov'd them by an oath upon the record it must be referr'd to the iury
but to the best of his memory upon asking him about sir george wakeman hand he said that he saw a letter subscribed with his name and that upon this information sir was committed

sir philip lloyd was called

who informed the court that dr oates made oath before the council sept
that he had seen mention made of sir george wakeman undertaking to poyson the king in a letter as he remember'd from mr whitebread to mr fenwick at omers and that coleman had paid sir george li in part of li which he was to have
that sir george wakeman being call'd and advertis'd of this charge he did not onely deny the whole matter and appear otherwise unconcerned but mov'd it as a reasonable thing that he might have reparation for the scandall
this behaviour of his was ill taken and it was found reasonable to enquire farther into the matter but the evidence coming onely from a letter sir george was not committed
dr oates being call'd in again was demanded what he could say of his own personal knowledge concerning sir george wakeman
upon which question dr oates holding up his hands no said he god forbid that should say any thing against sir george wakeman for know nothing more against him
sir philip remitting himself to the whole council for the truth of what he deliver'd
sir george wakeman minding the jury that this was a protestant witness and dr oates not remembring a word of the whole matter

dr oates did very candidly represent to the court

that he onely inform'd the council as by report of sir george wakeman receipt of the li in part the council not urging the witness to speak upon his knowledge
that the witness believed it to be so but would not be positive for in case he should have made such answer as is informed against him it was known to the whole board that he was at that time hardly compos mentis and scarce in condition to return an answer
but that this witness did according to the best of his skill knowledge and remembrance acquaint the board with sir george wakeman letter but he would not be positive

sir philip lloyd was then examined as to the letter

who informed that he remembred nothing of that letter and that afterward this witness observing in dr oates depositions before the lords and commons an account of such a letter from sir george wakeman to mr ashby found upon the table he this witness hath often reflected since that time upon dr oates declaring at the council that he had nothing more against sir george wakeman repeating dr oates action and expression that with his hands erected he said he knew no more against him

sir george wakeman plea

that the council would certainly have committed him if this evidence had been given to the board appearing to have something of weight in it dr oates sought to qualify that by saying that they were such a council as would commit no body
which was reflected upon by the court as unadvisedly said

mr lydcot was call'd

who brought a copy of the lords records and informed that it was a true copy and that titus oates was set in several places as to an information but whether it was his hand or not

mr lydcot could not say onely that it was copied from mr rolph hand
to all which it was objected that the witness not being present when dr oates said this not the thing attested by the clerk that made the entry or saw him subscribe the examination that copy amounted to no more then a transcript from the iournall which could not be allowed in evidence

mr rumly was offer'd to have his witnesses heard

but the court finding that he had no need of them the prisoner wav'd them

sir thomas doleman made oath

that dr oates appearing before his majesty and councill on the saturday and attending morning and afternoon and being employ'd that night upon searches the councill sitting sunday afternoon as the deponent remembred dr oates was then examin'd and the council sitting very long he was appointed that night to search again when he seiz'd several priests and papers the night being wet having much disorder'd him
on monday morning he was examin'd before the council again and at night in so feeble a condition as ever the witness saw any man
sir george wakeman offer'd that he appear'd upon sunday and so was dismist again till the king himself might have the hearing of the business the next day
sir thomas doleman than proceeded that sir george wakeman was then call'd in and deliver'd such an answer that the council very much wonder'd at the manner of it several persons being of opinion that his denial was not so as it might have been insisting much upon his loyalty to the crown and reparation upon a point of honour

sir george wakeman inform'd the court

that being charg'd with treason before the council and dr oates his accuser he pressed dr oates to say if he either knew him or had seen him before
he said no but that upon a consult at omers where ashby was rectour sir george wakeman was pitch'd upon by name for the poysoning of the king though the dr is now pleas'd to say that the debate was in england
that the prisoner finding the charge sos semote offer'd that where there was no proof he hop'd there would not be expected any defence
the prisoner upon this taking a freedom to instance in divers actions of loyalty both from himself family and relations as some testimony of his duty to the government

mr corker offer'd in plea

that not knowing his accusations he could not come provided with evidences to support his defence that nothing is easier then to accuse an innocent person so that he shall never clear himself and that it is not a positive but a probable oath that proves a man a criminal and that otherwise dr oates and his companions might hang up whom they pleas'd let the men be never so innocent or the matter charg'd never so ridiculous and that the circumstances ought to be credible as well as the witnesses neither of which were as he suggested to be found in his case
proceeding in a reflection upon the extent of the charge it involving the whole body of the roman catholicks in the treason using many flourishes of discourse to affect the bench and the iury as to the credit of the very plot it self raising arguments from improbabilities of circumstances and incredibility of witnesses to uphold his pretence
but the court with as much ease answer'd his defence as they heard it with patience

sir george wakeman recommended one observation to the court

that in dr oates copious narrative there is not one letter from abroad but he deposes positively both to the date and to the receipt of it and yet in the case of a man's life he will not be confin'd to a month

mr corker suggested divers mistakes of dr oates

as his charging the prisoner with the denial of a truth before a justice wherein the prisoner clear'd the errour and then the business of his going to lamspring
but these were look'd upon as matters of no weight
the prisoner then reflected upon the doctour's deposing him to be president of the congregation whereas stapilton is known to have been president of it for several years past
and says that if this prisoner be not president dr oates accusation of the benedictines waiting for his consent must fall to the ground

the prisoner being put to prove who was the president of the order

not being provided with witnesses at hand spake himself denying any letter either written or received as was suggested any privity to such a consult about the mony or any necessity for his being at it if the thing had been true
and arguing that in reason if he had been in the conspiracy with pickering when pickering was taken he would certainly have fled

and as to his exception against pickering

because no the dr knowing pickering so well and himself being present at the taking of him it seemed strange that he should neither know nor charge nor apprehend him the prisoner untill near a month after especially the officers coming to this prisoner's chamber when they seiz'd pickering
but dr oates hearing afterward that the prisoner had lodg'd there enter'd him in his list and so took him
whereas if as dr oates says the prisoner was a with pickering he being then in quest of the conspiratours it was his duty to have taken them both together
beside that the prisoner's name not being upon the doctour's catalogue he thought might acquit him
but the prisoner being in it that what he offer'd was no evidence he recommended himself to the jury to lay it to their consciences whether they did not assent to him in the truth of this matter

mr marshall being now ask'd what he had to say spake to this effect

that upon notice a month agoe of coming speedily to his trial he had bethought himself of his defence and with good hope to acquit himself
but reflecting upon the issue of the late trials he had once resolved to submit all to the sentene of the court and the jury without a word speaking
but that being now encourag'd by the candour and equity of the proceeding he made it his humble suit to the honourable bench to take into their own menage the cause of the prisoner
passing from thence to a slight reflection upon dr oates and mr bedlow and then referring to the unconcernedness upon him at his apprehension there being no warrant out against him nor any charge of treason lying upon him but that coming by chance to enquire for one where they were upon a search though he saw the officer at the door and candles up and down the house yet he went forward as all the people can testify and sir willam waller also that took him

sir william waller being called

deposed to this point that going to search there he gave order to one at the door to let nay body in but no body out and that the prisoner came and knockt at the door as sir william supposed not knowing of any search in the house
but being let in and finding how it was he did what he could to get away again

but mr marshall begging pardon for the contradiction

affirmed with a solemn asseveration that he enter'd without knocking the door being open and so went in of his own accord as the constable would bear him witness
and for his endeavour to get away again he affirm'd that while they were searching within he continu'd in an the constable and others with him wondering when he came back that the prisoner was

not gone
the prisoner affirming likewise that he was left at the door alone and beside that he could have slipt out at another door into an alley which he had the trick of opening while a man might speak three words
the prisoner insisting upon this confidence as an argument of his innocence saying farther that be was spoken to to take off his perriwigg and stand with his back to sir william and dr oates which the prisoner did not understand
but sir william being so kind afterwards as to see him at the with two worthy gentlemen sir philip matthews and sir iohn cuttler upon the prisoner's affirming that dr oates was wholly a stranger to him the prisoner was told that dr oates as a token that he knew him describ'd a certain mark upon the of his head the prisoner offering himself to the company to see if there were any such thing or no
the prisoner did now desire that dr oates might give an accompt of that mark and that the jury would believe of him according as they found it true or false
sir william waller inform'd the court that he knew nothing of any mark but that dr oates when he came in call'd the prisoner by his name
mr marshall excus'd the trouble he had given the court his defence depending upon the proof of doctour oates being a stranger to him desiring the jury to observe that such a description was given sir william waller owning a desire to see him without his perriwigg to look if he had a shaven crown which mr marshall said sir william must needs know could not be it being an experss caution that no religious wear any such testimony of his profession in england

mr marshall inform'd the court

that upon dr oates first evidence against him he desired sir william that it might be put in writing which sir william refused but promised to commit it to memory
hereupon the prisoner did now adjure sir william as a worthy gentleman and as he should answer for it at the last day to be as good as his word
the prisoner said farther that dr oates looking hard upon him askt him what his name was which shew'd him to be a stranger
and upon the prisoner's owning his name to be marshall dr oates told him that he was call'd marsh
urging it that dr oates seeing the prisoner saying that he did not know them leaving them in bed and at liberty to be gone and he himself declaring that he was looking for traitours the prisoner left the jury to judge whether he had any thing to charge upon them
sir william waller protested solemnly that there was nothing of all this
marshall exclaiming that he was astonish'd and affirming that upon a controversie with dr oates about it mr gill the constable averr'd it and promised to attend in court to make it good
the prisoner averring that he askt dr oates why he did not seize him before when he was searching for traitours if he knew the prisoner to be a traitour whose answer was before sir william that at that time he had no commission to seize him
but sir william remember'd nothing of this neither
mr marshall then ask'd sir william if he remember'd what dr oates said upon a question of his seeing the prisoner last summer which was that he saw him iune iuly and august
sir william waller calling to mind something of that mr marshall averr'd that he could prove himself in warwickshire all those three months but that his witnesses were not here and that it was impossible to foresee what points would come in question
whereupon he did submissiverly desire respite of the court for the producing of his witnesses

the prisoner recommends over again the consideration of the false mark

the dr's
finding him in bed and yet not knowing him his pointblank evidence upon august and the most certain means he had of disproving

it still insisting upon a very short time to bring up his witnesses

mr corker minded the court of the officers

and others that said upon the taking of pickering that they had nothing to say against the prisoners which a servant of the house was then ready to attest
elenor rigby informed that upon the search in the savoy marshall and corker were both in bed at the same time when pickering was taken and that the company ask'd the name of the people in the house and that this witness named to them pickering marsh corker and others
they declaring dr oates among the rest that their business was onely to pickering

upon the question

who was president of the benedictines the witness answered mr stapilton and that he had been so several years and that she was certain that corker never officiated in that place
and being ask'd if ever she had seen dr oates or mr bedlow there in the house she the witness answer'd that dr oates came to mr pickering for a charity that summer was twelvemonth and that mr pickering forbad his coming into the house
mr marshall collecting from that evidence that this being charg'd for the very nick of time to advance the plot it was not probable that they would treat so necessary an instrument in it at that rate
the prisoner repeating his desire onely of or days time to provide his witnesses reasoning upon the thing that if his life might justly be sav'd he did presume that the court would not have him lose it
but it was urg'd on the other side that he had notice long enough to have brought them up and that the iury must be now kept together till they give up their verdict

mrs elizabeth shelden informed

that mr stapilton was at present and had been for four or five years last past to her knowledge president of the benedictine monks
and alice broadhead informed likewise to the same effect
upon which evidence mr corker raised this inference that dr oates accusation was of no validity depending wholly upon the prisoner's being president and consenting to the plot under that qualification

sir george wakeman

with a soleman imprecation disclaimed all the crime in this matter that was charg'd upon him
and so likewise did mr corker renouncing both the doctrine of moving a sedition for religion and all power of dispensation for so doing
mr marshall was more copious and rhetorical and more upon perswasion then defence
so that the lord chief justice after some short remerks upon the romish principles summ'd up the evidence

and gave directions to the iury who after an hour's consideration returned the prisoners not guilty

letter to the trew professors of Christes Gospell inhabitinge in the Parishe off Allhallowis in Bredstrete in London made by Thomas Sampson sometyme their Pastore.
We as helpers therfore exhorte you that ye receaue not the grace of God in vayne.
Imprynted at Strasburgh in Elsas at the signe of the golde~ Bibell In the moneth of Auguste. the yeare of our LORD.
The grace a~d fauour of God our heauenly father pourchased vnto vs by the blody death of Christ our Sauiour befelte and encreased in all your consciences too your euerlasting consolation.
THe viole~ce of this age dothe not suffer me my most louinge brethren to come (as wolde do) vnto you and by talke brotherly co~ferringe to putte you in mynde of the Gospel of Iesus Christe which amongeste woothers farre more worthie euen by Gods grace preached amo~g you.
therfore haue thought nedeful by these letters now to do thesame nowe saye when thoughe the peruerse frowardnes of men the trew preaching of Christes Gospel is bannished and mans doctrine is taughte with lyes fables: And thoughe some perchaunce will thinke that thys longeth not to me but too hym that is youre Pastore to doo yet for as muche as once was your pastore ca~
not but testefye that some pece of pastorall cure dothe yet reste in my harte towardes you.
The whiche in dede dothe muche perswade me as the presente necessitie also semeth no les to require to make a longe a large treatise by whiche ye mighte haue an whole armour againste all the assaultes off false Prophetes.
But whe~ consider how truly and that with much dilige~ce ye haue ben taughte and therewith thinkinge that ye are not forgetfull hearers of the worde thinke that amonge you it shall suffice if do but name those greatest euelles whiche nowe are poured forthe out of pulpittes amonge you and therewith put you in mynd of the truthe contrary to these lyes which once you both herde and recyeued desiring you to abide in the same.
This will do shortly as haue but littell and thesame vnapte tyme to do it yet truly trust to do it as let Gods worde therein trye it.
If first ye will suffer me to tell you that throughe these fals Prophetes the castell of youre healthe the saluacion of your soules is assalted whome if ye suffer too be with you if ye yelde vp your selfes to the beleuinge folowing of their doctrine then knowe ye that as by blynde lears ye be ledde so you wyth them then beynge blynded
shal wyth them fall in to the pitte of pardicio~ which
is prepared aswell for the falsely seduced as for the false seducer.
Of thys coulde be content to speake the lesse but that se that whylest of to many and that Londyners these beastes befolowed.
Ye haue euen drawen and pulled vpon your heades those abhominacions whiche if but reason had ruled shoulde not haue bene admitted before that by lawes they had ben thrust vnto you that speake not what trew Christianitie shoulde haue moued you too haue done.
is this the Gospelling fruicte to be the firste that withoute a lawe shouldest bannish trew preaching out of the too be the fyrste that againste lawes shalt admitte that massinge Idolatrie to be the firste that shall geue the example of sto~bling to all Englande whych shouldest yet haue bene the fyrst in constancy in humble sayeng for the continuinge of the truthe in the in quiet and paciente suffringe for the truths sake euen deathe if by the rulers it had bene offered the.
That grounde arte thou whyche not in persecucion but before persecucio~ commeth dost go backe a grou~d thou arte reserued for the Lordes wofull cures to whose iudgement London leue the.
it is nowe meete for vigilante Pastors too watche ouer their flocke to chase the wolf awaye les at the Lordes hande they doo heare the name of hierlinges
so nowe is it hygh tyme for you my louinge brethre~ and all them that he the chyldre~ of God to take heede whose voyce ye do heare too beware of the leauen of papisticall Phariseis and to kepe your selfes vndefiled from all their abhominacions.
The greatest of whiche now will resite amonges all their abhominacions one of the principall is their doctrine of transsubstanciatio~ the very pryde of papistrie and the horrible offence euen of the Turckes and Heathen.
That a popish priest by his hussing and bussinge and mumblinge vp of the woordes of Christe more lyke a Coniuror then a Christian shoulde worke that miraculous alteracion and chaunginge of the substaunce of breade and wyne into the substaunce of the bodye and bloude of Christe whiche then is to be taken as Christ hym selfe God and man so to be adored.
But you knowe my dere brethren that there is no suche miracle too be beleued without the certayne doctrine of Gods worde to warant thesame which the papistes can neuer showe therfore their miracle is not to be beleued Christ in Insti+tuting the Supper me~t not to leaue there
hys body and bloud really and substancially as the papistes do teache: For Christe in the substaunce of hys body was then to be crucified he was to dye he was to ryse agayn he was to ascende and he was and in thesame yet now is to appeare before the glorious God our Bishop aduocate mediator there so to remayne vntill the laste daye as the schriptures do teache.
In the Supper he instituted a commemoration of the breaking of hys body and sheddinge of hys bloud to be done and made of them that do eate that breade and drynke of that cuppe accordinge to hys institution: which he called his body and bloude for that it is to the receauers a seale and confirmacion of Christes body broke~ and Christes bloud shedde for them that the profite and commoditie thereof is theirs whiche there do partake by fayth.
And so these woordes: This is my body, and this is my bloud, are to be vnderstand and not as the transsubsta~+ciators literally enforce them.
For their vn+derstanding them is bothe co~trary to Christus meaninge and also to the office of hys body besydes that it is agaynst the nature of hys very body.
And that thesame phrase of speakinge is thus to be vnderstanded as haue sayde: The like phrases in like matters in the scriptures dothe sufficie~tly teche
As whereof circumcision the LORD dothe saye: This is my couenaunt, where it was but the seale of the couenau~t as Paul calleth it.
In the same sorte it is sayde: This is the pasouer.
So that if the aduersaries will geue the geue the holy Ghoste leaue to expound hym self then these woordes.
Thys is my body? Thys is my bloud? are figuratiuely to be vnderstanded.
As the leke Phariseis are and so serue they not all for their monstruus transsubstanciation.
In whiche (too let many thinges passe as the straungenes of the tounge the Iewesh apparel the fonde noddes crosses beckes duckes.)
Thre euels moste notable and to a Christian conscience intollerable are there.
whiche their masseboke testefieth to be Propiciatorie to take awaye the synnes of all those be they dead or liuing for whom thei do say masse: Yea profitable and availeable for warres peace wether sickenes for murrain of beastes and for whatsoeuer ye lust to bye their appliecacion.
As concerninge the sacrifice Propiciatorie for synne ye must hold the anker of your faith
that this sacrifice Christ him self once offered for all in his own bloudy death.
He was the priest the sacrifice the offerer and the thing offered by his own bloudy offering purified he in the shedding of his bloude all hys fro~ synne.
By it purchased he eternall sanctificacion saluacion for the~ that shalbe saued: by it finished he for euer the ful pro+piciacion for synnes:
for sayeng these wordes it is fynished or consummate he yelded vp the ghoste.
Detestable therfore is the papisticall sacrifice ingerous to the bloudy death of Christ.
Christ instituted this supper to be a sacra+ment to vs and not that of it a priest should make a propiciatory sacrifice for synne: In the eating drinking of it that we should de+clare the Lordes death offeringe the sacrifice of thankes therefore (and therefore is it called of the fathers a sacrifice of thankes) and not leauinge any more sacrifice propyciatorie for synne too anye prieste too offer:
That we eatynge and drinkynge according too hys institucion shoulde by fayth applie vnto oure consciences the benefite of hys deathe and passion and not geuinge power too any prieste by messing too applie the benefite of hys death to whome and to what he lysteth.
Christ ordeined hys Supper neither for the dead whiche haue no vse of eating and drinking with vs in the congregacion: nor yet for beastes wether nor war for which Christ did not dre: but for hys church liui~g vpon thys earth that nedeth hys worde nedeth hys Sacrame~ts for the co~firminge of their fayth.
Thus plainly ye se one mischeuous misuse in this masse.
The seconde euell is that the bread and cuppe (which the Lorde instituted too be receaued of the faythefull with thankes geuinge) In their masse they do abuse and make of it an Idol holding it vp for the people not onely to gaze vppon but to geue vnto it that honor whiche is dewe vnto God alone: And so bothe make of it an Idol and of the people grosse Idola+tors and transgressers of Gods commaun+dement.
The fylthines of which Idolatrie know you do se so plaine that nede not with many woordes to impugum it for a Christian conscience can not but abhorre it.
The thirde euel is that in their masse that that is eaten and drounken is done deuou+red of the priest all alone with quartering and soppinge with lickinge and suppinge with wasshing and wyping and such prety trickes of their owne inuenting.
Take ye, and drynk ye all of this sayeth he: This do ye in remembraunce of me.
For so oft as ye eate this bread and drinke of this cup ye shew the Lordes death tyll he commeth.
Christ and Paule speaketh not to the priest alone but too the whole congregacion too obserue thys ordinaunce of eating and drin+kinge at the Lordes supper: Whereby ye maye playnely se how contrary thys doyng of our popishe massers is in this also to the Institucion of Christe.
And too be shorte in thys their whole masse is nought els but an horrible prophanacio~ of the Lordes supper: Wherefore as a moste iniurius blasphe+mye too the bloude of Christe as a moste grosse Idolatrie as a moste wicked propha+nacion of Christes institucion of all Christians is this masse to be eschewed and abhorred.
Out of his mischeuous Idol the masse form they vnto the people a new founde sa+crament of their owne inuentinge: deliuering to the people (as they saye) through the miracle of their transsubstanciatio~ a body in which body because also there is bloude therefore they do not minister their consecrated cup accordingly for feare of spilling and yet they geue drinke too their houseled to washe doune the cromes withall.
Where haue ye your ground in the scripture for this your vnholsome hou+sell.
Who can with a good conscii~ce receyue suche a new found Popish sacramente at a papistes hande seynge also it is thereto off them vsed to put Christes true institucion out of hys trew vse.
Whose appointed ordinaunce is that the bread of thankesgeuing and the cuppe of thankesgeuing shoulde be eaten and droncken of the congregacion as before sayd.
Thys their newe founde Sacrament they hange vppe in the pix they carrye abrode in processio~s to be adored with many such mischiefs of their owne inuentinge whiche to reken vp all were an endles labour.
leaue them therfore euer listeninge when may heare them defende these their abhominacions by the written woorde off God but this as they neuer yet coulde do so shall they neuer be able to do it and therfore of all Christians are they wish their euasyons to be forsaken.
In the doctrine of Iustificacion they wander enwrapped in laberin these inextricable.
They erre in extenuating synne bothe originall and actuall in not vndersta~dinge the lawe the force of it (I meane) nor
the ende of it in makynge a Iustification partly of Christes grace partelye of mans free wil good mocyons and good worckes and herein they so enwrappe theym selfes with their termes of the fyrst grace
the seconde grace grace presidente grace concomitatinge grace folowinge with merite of congruence and merite of condignitie that neither vnderstande thee trewe iustificacion neither canne other men vnderstande what they do meane by their Iustificatio~: But their doctrine is too bringe men into a continuall doubtynge of saluacion and leadeth them cleane from that free Iustificacion whiche we haue in Iesus Christe.
But you my brethren haue out of the scrip+tures receyued and truste by the practyses of youre owne conscyences haue tasted.
That by nature ye are the chyldren of wrath of your selfs: as of your selfs that ye are but suche a lompe of synne that in you dwelleth no good thynge.
For whyche the lawe iustely condempneth you as gilty of Goddes curse and wrathe and so dryueth you too Christe.
By whose bloudde sheddynge onely and alone the attonemente is nowe made
made betwene God and you whiche you beleuing are made the heires of blessinge of whiche your consciences by fayth beinge assured by the worke of Gods spirite
ye be at peace with God because ye do feale euen in your hartes by liuelye perswasion off fayth that Christ hath loued you and geuen hym self for you
for whose onely sake ye are iustefied and saued: Which you thus felinge are ledde by thesame spirite that worketh thys in you too render vnto God the sacrifice of your body in liuing doing those workes which in hys sight are acceptable and that in a fredom and libertie off the spirite meane no fleshely libertie but that libertie of the spiritie by whiche we darre drawe nye vnto the seate of Goddes grace calling hym: Abba father that libertie that subdueth the libertie of the fleshe and maketh it captiue bonde too serue the spirite.
In which you also walkinge when ye haue done all that ye can do yf ye coulde do all that is commaunded you too do yet seinge all mans righteousnes is but as a defyled clothe ye seke not thereby the perimplishment of your Iustificacion.
Which is all redy fully geuen you in Christes Iesus ye loke not to the merite of your good workes: but on your part knowing your owne want and imperfection
in the best ye do ye saye: we are vnprofitable seruauntes commending all your doinges to the grace of God thorowe Christe that by hym they maye be made pure: on Godes parte considering that the good ye do is the worke of his spirite in you which worketh in all men bothe to will to do ye do geue vnto hym the glory seyng by his grace onely ye are that good that ye are.
whiche through Christe hath accepted you vnto his grace doth of the same grace in Christe accept these youre workes into hys fauour as iust perfect and good.
Whiche though they be the woorkes of hys spirite in you yet is he content to haue the~ called and estemed as yours and as youres dothe he of hys owne fre grace reward the~ bothe in this lyfe and in the lyfe to come.
In this that haue thus spoken you se the force of synne originall and actuall the force and ende of the lawe the power of mans free will the trew iustification ma~s regeneracion and the life fruictes perfec+tion of Gods regenerate chylde: By which ye may the more easely perceaue how farre the papistes wander from the truthe of iustification by which they drawe men into a desperate doubting of saluacion whyche who so liketh let them taste therof.
occasion also geuen me to warne you of all those meanes that they haue taught too be meritorius to deserue Gods grace as workes of superrogacio~ workes done of a good entent fish fastes vowes pylgrimages par+dons
and suche like Popish trashe which though as yet perchau~ce they dare not teathe yet haue they taught and will hereafter teache it.
But against all such acco~pt you sufficiently armed if ye holde fast thys that our onely merite a valiable before god is the merite of Christ whiche he frely geueth and God for his onely sake frelye imputeth to all trew beleuers which is vnto them full perfyt and sufficient merit righ+teousnes sanctification saluacion.
They teache also inuocacion of sainctes to make them mediators if not too God for vs yet vnto Christe to speake the better for vs.
The scripture teacheth playn that betwen God and man there is but one mediator the man Iesus Christ who therfore became man that for men he alone should make intercessio~ as for mans rede~pcion he alone did dye.
Wherefore euen he also teacheth me~ to call vpo~ the father in hys name promising to suche that they shall be harde.
Prayer abuse they not onely in a strau~ge tonge contrary to the doctrine of Paule whiche will haue all thinges done in the co~+gregacion
to the edifyeng thereof: in supersticious numbring of a certayne number of Psalmes or Pater nosters of whiche because the people shalbe sure
they teache the~ the vse of beades contrarye vnto whiche Christ our Sauiour taught condemninge it as a phariseicall supersticion when for their much clatering sake they thinke them selfes to be hard:
But also they teache and defend prayeng for the dead to be charitable and propiciatory.
Where as yet the scripture teacheth that they that dye in the Lorde are insolace and blessednes.
As then they nede not our prayers so our prayers can adde noughte vnto their blessednes:
And on the contrary parte they that dye wickedlye haue no remedye euerlastingly: So that on all partes thys kynde of prayer is in vayne.
The wother being in moste blessed saftie and with these the tyme of health grace beinge past theyr curious charitie therfore and their peuishe propiciatorye prayer hath no ground in the scriptures.
But through this they haue picked the purse of many a poore man for on thys vnhappye grounde buylde they chantries trentalles vniuersaries diriges purgatory pardons for soules departed and a pece of their expiatory sacrifice with many suche proper deuises.
Auriculer confessio~ they teache in which they enforce a numbring of synnes whiche is nought els but the tyra~ny of their kingdome and as they vse it a killing of Christia~ consciences and hath no grou~de of the scrip+tures.
In an anguishe and dute of conscie~ce it is both good necessary and comfortable for a man to counsail with sum suche learned elder in whose lippes dothe lye the law of truthe.
Agayne if the trew ecclesiasticall discipline were vsed a pece of it oughte too be that the man restored shoulde of hys faulie make an open confession before the congregacion to declare publicquely hys repentaunce.
Yea and a minister may vppon iust grou~de examine any of whom he hath cure of such a faute as he seeth him worth to be reproued for: But this is so farre fro~ their eareshrifte that a man moste blynde maye easely iudge thereof.
But the rable of their errors are to many now to recite as of the authoritie of the churche of the not erring of the churche of discipline of theyr fyue new enuented sacrament of voues of ckoyse of meates of images and such lyke.
Against all whiche that ye maye be armed my deare brethren require you not onely to call to minde the doctrine of the truthe receyued.
But also that for the triall of the~ ye do abyde in the worde of the truthe Godes
And because here they haue also an error will but recite it and so make an ende.
Their error is that Gods writte~ worde is not a sufficiente doctrine vnto saluacion but (say they) the voyce of the church tradicions and counsayles are to be harde of necessitie.
As for tradicions there is no tradicion of any matter of faithe to be receyued other then is in the scriptures expressed.
with the consent and custome of the churche are so farre to be harde in matters of faithe as they do agre with the writen scripture: for it is the touche stone to trye them all by that in suche sorte that if they saye not according to this woorde then as there is no light in them so are they not to be folowed.
and by and for the order of the churche ceremonies receyued and vsed which be no matters of faith they may be admitted and altered at the discrecion of theym that haue the rule of the church vnder Christ according to the neces+site of the tyme and the disposition of the people so that in them be nothinge elles but trew edifying to vnfayned Godlynes.
And suche are of the people with humblines too be receyued.
But for the ful triall of suche and for the full and perfect institucion
of all men in suche thinges as concerning saluacion God hath lefte vnto his church and people hys written worde.
In whiche though all thinges that God mighte haue caused to be written be not writte~.
Yet in it so much is written as sufficeth to teache vs that Iesus Christ is the sonne of God and also that we beleuing might haue lyfe euerlastinge as Ihon dothe witnes by whiche we learne that the written worde of God.
is a sufficie~t doctrine to instruct vs in that fayth whiche bringeth to lyfe euerlastinge.
It is that sufficient doctrine that can alone make men learned vnto saluacion by the fayth which is in Christ Iesus it alone sufficeth to make the ma~ of God perfectly enstructed too all that is good as witnesseth Paule.
Therefore vnto the scriptures do Christe sende the Phariseis Abraham too Moyses and the Prophetes Peter also to thesame worde of the Prophetes as to the doctrine that sufficeth to enstructe vs too saluacion.
The knowledge of whiche worde whosoeuer goeth aboute to take from the people by putting it into a straunge langage to the ende that the more safely our popish marchau~tes maye kepe their marte of falshead and Popery he robbeth the people of their meane to saluacion he openith a dore for theues and murtherers to deuoure the
flocke of Christ and if at the worldes ha~de he sustayneth not the iudgemente of a thefe yet at Godes hande shall he be sure to haue the iudgement of a soule murtherer.
Thus briefly haue put you in mynd my deare brethren of the principall errors of the aduersaries and of the truthe contrary to them not so copiously as the matter deserueth but shortly measuring the neade of your knowledge for haue not to do now with the ignorant but with you of whom by the tyme and kynde of your teachinge iudge that ye be able not onely too iudge off the truthe but too be brotherly enstruetors of other in thesame.
And thus haue done furst to exorte you constantly to abide in the truthe receyued.
Call to youre mynde that God of his great mercy and goodnes hathe long ben in planting sowing and watering of you as it were to make you a garden off pleasure vnto hym selfe.
These sedes of lyfe the deuel by hys doctors will now go about to picke out of your hartes.
But if in thys Gospelling adge ye haue bene worthy hearers of the Gospel if with the worde herde with youre eares the Lordes sprite hathe touched your hartes to beleue the worde of truthe preached as he hath done to so many as haue vnfaynedly desired it
if ye be the shepe which haue rightely herde the shepeherdes
voyce then surely the straungers supplanting voice shall ye not heare but ye shall flee frome suche hurelinges as frome theues robbers and murtherers.
Hereby verely shall ye be knowen what ground ye are fruteful or vnfruteful constant or seruers of the tyme:
Good Gospel hearers be not suche as will be tost aboute with euery wynde they be no suche grounde as wil be dried vp with euery blast of bourning heate but they abide in Godes truthe serchinge and learninge thesame in hys holy scriptures and that with suche faithfull diligence and constante obedience that if an aungell from heauen shal preache an other Gospel they holde hym accursed:
Yea and thoughe there be many counterfaicie Christians that fall awaye frome the Lordes truthe yet abide they with Christe and saye: Thou hafte the wordes of euerlasting lyfe: Consider my deare brethren that not too heare alone but to kepe Christes woorde maketh a man happie.
And in kepinge the principall parte is too perseuer in the doctrine off truthe thys maketh Christes disciples this maketh you free yea thys is it that maketh a man safe for he that perseuereth too the ende shalbe saued.
Thys also haue written too exorte you to kepe your selfes vndefiled frome all
yf ye do fall from the Gos+pell and embrace Poperie ye fall frome truthe to lyes frome the woorde of lighte and lyfe to darkenes and death frome saluacion to dampnacion from God too the deuell.
Ye are then they into whome the euell sprete reentreth with seue~ worse then hym selfe ye are then the folishe buylders whiche suffer the vnrecouerable ruin.
And as then with that filth that is in Popery ye be defyled with it: so of the dampnacion whiche is due to suche abhominacion ye shall be partakers of it.
But if ye thinke that ye can bothe embrace Popery and the Gospel ye do disceaue your selfes for you can not bothe holde the taste off Christes deathe in your consciences and alowe also that masse whiche is the defacer of Christes deathe you can not embrace the righte vse of the Lordes supper and also vse and partake the horrible prophanacion of thesame: Ye can not by faythe apprehende free iustificacion and yet seke by your righteousnes and merites too be saued: you can not accepte Godes written woorde as the sufficient doctrine of saluacion: and alsoo take mans doctrine and tradicions as necessarie to thesame and so forthe of the rest.
This can ye not do bothe they are so contrarie.
But if ye coulde do it yet may ye not do it for God will none of your ma~geled seruice for as there is no co~uenie~ce betwene Christe and Beliall so men must not halte on both sydes in Godes seruice but eyther say that God is God or els that Baal is god.
God neuer allowed that seruice of the Samaritaines whiche both serued their Idols and worshipped the lyuing God.
But if ye be turned to the Lord then all straunge Gods muste ye cleane forsake.
The Lorde is God alone alone therfore according to hys worde will he be serued.
God is ouer ma~ a gelious God wherefore he will haue whole man wholy to be hys alone as our fyrst comma~dement teacheth vs. Agayne if you thinke that in your hartes ye will serue the Lord but yet ye will be and may be present in parson at their Idolatrie.
This is but a fleshly policie which fayleth as many as trust vnto it.
How can you too whome Christes deathe is deere: abyde to se that whorish thefe that stealeth from Christe the glory of his death.
Howe can ye which haue ben and are ready to receaue with thankefulnes the Lordes supper according to Christes institucion abide to se the horrible prophanacion thereof?
But if your conscie~ce were suche that ye coulde thus do yet knowe ye
For we are taughte that too beleue with the hart to confesse with the mouth maketh a man safe.
Bothe hartes belefe mouthes confessio~ must go together whiche dothe not so in you when inwardly ye are Gospelers outwardly dessemblers with papistes.
Ye are bought with a pryce (sayeth Paule) glorify now God in your body and in your sprite whiche are Gods.
Seinge both body an sprite are Goddes not onelye by creacion but bought also by redempcio~ euen in the price of Christes bloude ye can not with a dissembling prete~ce couple your bodies with papistes for then ye do not glorifie God in your bodies.
We rede not that any chylde of God vsed euer iustlye anye suche dissimulacion.
Daniel vsed none such and therfore was he sone accused of not ado+ring the kyng Bel and the Dragon.
The thre chyldren whether they came by co~pulsion or came of their owne mynde where the Idol was dissembled not for forth with they were accused as transgressors of the kynges commaundement.
These men glorified God in body sprite these men beleued in hart confessed with the mouth so must you do without any other muysinge yf ye will do the office off
And this to do not onely the profession of Christianitie enforceth but Christian cheritie also.
Our doinges must be without offence geuinge: But by thys dissembling a double stomble blocke is geue~ whiche euen in thinges indifferent is to be auoyded.
For what though a Christian may eate frely of meates offered vnto Idols yet if thereby an Idolater whose conscience in hys supersticion shoulde be confirmed ther+by it were better neuer to eate fleshe.
And what though al thinges be clean to the clean to be eaten on all dayes with thankes geuing yet better it is not to eate flesh nor to drinke wyne:
If this be to be obserued in thinges indifferente howe muche more in thinges which are absolutely euell must ye take heede that neither ye geue occasion off concerninge the conscience of an Idolatrie nor yet of offending the weke to draw them to the leeke euell with you: bothe whiche ye do when bothe a papist and a weke brother seeth you as mingrels myngling your selfs with the Papistes in their Idolatrie.
As muche might speake howe that all thynges that ye do in the congregacion muste be done to edifyeng.
referre you to the mynde off mayster Caluine lately tra~slated printed
Thus now ende wishing you all well in the Lorde.
Offer youre selfes hu~bly to suffer all violence of blouddye lawes for the truthes sake kepe safe your conscie~ces thoughe the sworde taketh your lyues from you suffer beare withal humblenes and quiet obedience.
Humble your selfes in vnfayned repentaunce before the Lorde in the horrible plague of Po+pery that of hys mercy he maye be moued to ende these dayes of delusion and let your prayers alwayes ascend vp before the Lord begginge of hym suche thynges as ye nede.
The grace of our LORD Iesus Christ be with you all.

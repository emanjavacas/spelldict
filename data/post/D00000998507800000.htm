the preface to the reader
good reader my love revere~ce to the author living and to his memorie being dead my desire to serve the church of god by other mens woorks who am not able to doe it by myne owne have moved me to publishe this learned treatise which doctor rainolds left as many other exquisit travels of his shutt vp in the closett of some private frends as in a fayre prison

because my testimonie or any mans know is of much lesse waight then the onely name of the author to co~mend the woorke will say nothing more in praise of it then that it is an vndoupted woorke of that worthie holy man whose learning dilligence abilleties meeknes wisdo pietie made him eminent to vs may

perhaps yeeld him more admirable to posteretie which without envie of his person shal view the marks of thies graces in his writings or take them by storie

touching the argument will onely say that it seemeth the more woorthy such a mans resolution by how much it hath bene formerly or prese~tly is controverted amongst the learned
and if anie man be co~trarie minded to this which is the common iudgement of the reformed churches he above others shalbe my debttor for helping him to so good a mea+nes of reforming himselfe in matters of opinion chiefly divine he that conquer eth he that is is co~quered devide both honor proffit
if any man take good by it let him give praise to god if he take none let him bla~e none but himselfe the next page will shew the contents order of the booke the booke it selfe wil shew thee how good it is

the contents of the chapters

the first chapter
the state of the question betwene the church of rome the reformed churches being first declared the truth is proved by scripture that a man having put away his wife for her adulterie may lawfully marrie another
the second chapter
the places of scripture alleaged by our adversaries to disprove the lawful liberty of mar+riage after divorceme~t for adulterie are propo+sed exa~ined proved not to make against it
the third chapter
the co~sent of fathers the second prete~ded proofe for the papistes doctrine in this point is prte~ded falsly if all be weighed in an even ballance the fathers checke it rather
the fourth chapter
the conceits of reaso~s urged last against vs are oversights proceeding from darknesse not from light reason it self dispelling the mist of popish probabilties giveth cleare testimonie with the truth of christe

an admonition to the reader
although the printer hath beene carefull supplied sometimes the defects of his coppie yet hath he somtimes fayled not only in mispoyntinge or not poynting or transposing omitting or adding sometimes a letter which the readers iudgment diligence must helpe but in omission or alteration of woords obscur+ing or perverting the sence which the reader shal doe wel to corect before he reade the booke as they stand herevnder
it is like enough there may bee more faults especially in the quotations chiefly in the greeke woords written in a lattin letter concerning which onely desire that the author whose skill and dilligence were admirable might take no damage by other me~s faults
the faults are omissive or coruptions of words
the woordes omitted are in the corrections following writte in another letter faults escaped in the printinge

of the lavvfvl+nes of mariage vppon a lavvfvl divorce
the first chapter

the state of the question beeing first declared the truth is proved by scripture that a ma having put away his wife for her adulterie may lawfully marrie another·

the dutye of man and woman ioyned in marriage requireth that

they two should bee as one person and cleave ech to other with mutuall love and liking in societie of life vntill it please god who hath coupled them together in this bonde to sett them free from it and to dissociate and sever the by death but the inordinate fansies desires of our corupt nature have soe inveighled adams seede in many places that men have accustomed to put awaye their wiues vppon everie trifling mislike discontentment yea the iewes supposed the~selves to be warra~ted by gods

lawe to doe it so that whosoever put away his wife gave her a bill of divorce me~t
this perverse opinio errour of theirs our saviour christ reproved teaching that divorcements may not be made for anie cause save whoredome onely
for whosoever saith he shall put away his wife except it bee for whoredome and shall marrie another doth commit adulterie and who so marrieth her which is put away doth commit adulterie
now about the meaning of these wordes of christ expressed morefully by on of the

evangelists by

others

more sparingly there hath a doubt arisen and diverse men eve from the primative churches time have bee of diverse minds

for many of the fathers have gathered therevpon that if a mans wife committed whoredome fornicatio he might not onely put her away but marrie another
some others and amonge them namely augustine have thought that the man might put away his wife but marrie another he might not
the schooledivines of latter years the cano~ists as for the most parte they were adicted comonly to austins iudgme~nt did likewise follow him herein the popes mainteining their doctrine for catholique have possessed the church of rome with this opinion
but since in our dayes the light of good learning both for artes tongues hath shined more brightly by gods most gracious goodnes then in the former ages and the holy scriptures by the help thereof have bene the better vnderstoode the pastors and doctors of the reformed churches have percieved shewed that if a mans wife defile her self with fornication he may not onely put her away by christs doctrine but also marrie another
wherein that they teach agreeably to the truth and not erroneously as iesuits papists doe falsly and vniustly charge them
will make manifest and prove through gods assistance by expresse words of christ the truth it self
and because our adversaries doe weene that the co~tra+rie hereof is strongly proved by sundrie arguments and obiecttions which two of their newest writers bellarmin the iesuit a namelesse author of an english pamphlet have dillige~tly laid together for the farther clearing therefore of the matter and taking away of doubts scruples will set downe all their obiections in order first out of the scriptures then of fathers last of reasons and answer everie one of them particularly
so shall it appeare to such as are not blinded with a opinion and prejudice that whatsoever shewe of probabilities ate brought to the contrarie yet the truth delivered by our saviour christ alloweth him whose wife committeth fornication to put her away and marrie another

the proofe hier of is evident if christs wordes be weighed in the niententh chapter of mathews gospell
for

when the pharises asking him a question whether it were lawfull for a

man to put away his wife for everie cause received answer that it was not and therevpon saide vnto him why did moses then commande to give a bill of divorcement and to put her a way our saviour sayde vnto them moses suffered you because of the hardnes of your harte to put awaye your wifes but from the beginning it was not so
and say vnto you that whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for whoredome and shall marrie another doth commit adulterie and who so marrieth her that is put away doth commit adulterie

now in this sentence the clause of exception except it bee for whoredome doth argue that he commiteth not adulterie who having put away his wife for whoredome marrieth another

but he must needes commit it in doing so vnles the band of marrirge be loosed and disolved
for who so marrieth another as long as he is

bou~de to the former

is an adulterer
the band then of marriage is loosed dissolved betwene that man and wife who are put assunder and divorced for whoredome

and if the band beloosed the man may marry another seing it is written

art thou loosed from a wife if thou marrie thou sinnest not

therefore it is lawfull for him who hath put away his wife for whoredome to marrie another

this argument doth firmly and necessarily co~clude the point in question if the first parte proposition of it be proved to be true
for there is no controversie of any of the rest beinge all grounded on such vndoubted principles of scripture reason that our adversaries themselves admit and graunt them all

the first

they denie to weete that the clause of in christs speech except it be for whoedome doth argue that the ma committeth not adulterie who having put awaie his wife for whoredome marrieth another
and to overthrowe this proposition they doe bring soudry answers and evasions
the best of all which as bellarmin avoucheth is that those words except it bee for whoredome are not an exception
for christ saith he ment those words

except for whoredome not as an exception but as a negation
so that the sence is whosoever shall put awaie his wife
except for whoredome that is to saie

without the cause of whoredome shall marrie another doth commit adulteric
whereby it is affirmed that he is an adulterer who having put awaie his wife without the cause of whoredoe marrieth another but nothing is sayde touching

him who marrieth another having put away his former wife for whore dome
in deede this evasion might have some collour for it if these words of christ except it be for whoredome were not an exception
but neither hath bellarmin ought that maye suffice for the proofe hereof and the verie text of the it selfe is soe cleare against him that he must of necessitie give over his houlde
for the principal pillar wherewith he vnder proppeth it is

austins iudgme~t who hath so expounded it in his first booke touching adulterous marriages now of that treatise

austin saith himselfe in his retractations have written two bookes touching adulterous marriages as neere as could according to the scripturs being desirous to open and loose the knotts of a most difficult que+stion
which whether have done so that no knott is left therein know not nay rather perceave that have not done it perfectly and throughly although have opened many creeckes thereof as whosoever readeth with iudgment may discerne
augustin then acknowledgeth that there are some wants imperfectio~s in that worke which they may see who reade with iudgment
and whether this that bellarmin doth alleage out of it deserve not to fal within the co~passe of that ce~sure appeale to their iudgme~t who have eies to see for augustin thought that the word in the orignial of mathews gospel had by the proper significatio of it imported a negation rather then an exception
as

he sheweth by saying that where the common latin translation hath

ex+cept for whoredome in the greeke text it is rather read

without the cause of whoredome
supposing belike whether by slipp of memory or rather oversight

that the same words which were vsed before in the fift chapter of mathews gospel to the same purpose were vsed also in this place whereas here they

differ and are well expressed by that in the latin by which austin thought they were not so well
howbeit if thy had bene the same with the former yet neither so might bellarmin allowe his opinion considering that the comon latin tra~slation which papists by there councel of trent are bound to stande to vnder paine of ourse expresseth

those likewise as a plaine exception

which in deede agreeth to the right and naturall meaning of the

particle as

the like writers vse it in like construction even

then to whe it hath as it were a link lesse to tie it vnto that meaning

wherefore

austins mistaking of the worde and significatio thereof is noe sufficie~t warra~t for bellarmin to ground on that they must be taken so
as for that he addeth that albeit

both these particles be taken exceptively often times yet may they also be taken otherwise one of the is vsed in the revelation as an adversative not an exceptive this maketh much lee for proofe of his assertion
for what if it be vsed there as an adversative where the matter treated of and the tenour of the sentence doe manifestly argue that it must be taken so must it therefore be taken so in this place whereof our questio~n is or doth bellarmin proove by any circumstance of the text that here it may be taken so no
neither saith he a worde to this purpose
why he then that it take otherwise and is in the revelation for an adversative particle truely know not vnlesse it be to shewe that he can wrangle and play the cavelling sophister in seeming to gainsay and disprove his adversarie when in trueth he doth not
or perhaps though he durst not say for the particular that it is taken here as an adversative which he coulde not but most absurdly yet he thought it policie to breede a surmise thereof for the generall that shallower conceits might imagin another sence therein they knew not what and they whose brasen faces should serve them thereto might impudently brable that our sence is not certaine because another is possible eve as if a iew beeing pressed by a christian with the place of

esay behoulde a virgin shall conceave and bring forth a sonne should answer that the hebrue worde translated virgin may be taken otherwise sith that in the

proverbs it signifieth a married woman at least one that is not a virgin in deede though shee woulde seeme to be but as the iew ca~not conclude hereof with any reaso that the word signifieth a married woman in esay because the thinge spoken of is a straunge signe it is not straunge for a married woma to conceave and bring forth a sonne so neither can the iesuite conclude of the former that the particle in mathew is ment adversatively because the words then doe breede noe sence at all in which sorte to thinkethat any wise man spake were solly that christ the worde and wisdome of god were impietie
nay if some of bellarmins schollers shoulde say that words must bee

supplied to make it percit sence rather than their maister bee cast of as a wra~gler they would be quickely forced to pluck in this horne or els they might chance to leape which is worse out of the frying pan into the fire
for adversative particles im+port an opposition and contrariety vnto that sentence agaynste which they are brought in now the sentence is that who so put teth away his wife and marrieth another doth commit adulterie

wherefore hee by consequent co~mitteth not adulterie who doth so for whoredome if the particle bee adversative and must have words accordingly supplied vnderstood to make the sence percttt
thus the shift and cavill which bellarmin hath drawen out of the double meaning of the greeke worde is either idle and beateth the aire or if it strike any it striketh himselfe giveth his cause a deadly wound
yea that which he principally sought to confute hee hath confirmed thereby
for sith the worde hath onely two significations exceptive and adverstive neither durst he say that it is vsed here as an adversative
it foloweth he must graunt it to be as an exceptive soe the place rightly translated in our english agreeable to the other in the
of mathew except it be for whoredoe which as in their authe~ticall latin text also doth out of controversie betoke an exception
having al passages therefore shutt againste him for scaping this way he sleeth to another starting hole to weete that if the worde be taken exceptively yet may it be an exception negative

and this he saieth sufficeth for the maintenance of austins answer
for when it is said whosoever shall put away his wife excepting the cause of whoredome and shall marrie another doth commit adulterie the cause of woredome may be excepted either because in that case it is not to marrie another and this is an exception affirmative or because nothing is determined touching that cause whether it be sufficient to excuse adulterie or noe and this is an exceptio negative which in that austin imbraced he did well
would to god bellarmin had austins modestie
then would hee be ashamed to charge such a man with imbracing such whorish silth of his owne fansing as in this distinction of negative and affirmative exception he doth
for he handleth it soe and porversly by calling that affirmative which in is negative

and by avouching that to be negative which is not as if he had made a covenant with his lipps to lye treadinge in the stepps of those wicked wretches of whom it is written

woe vnto them who say that good is evill and evill good
for the proofe whereof it is to be noted that an excepton is a particular propo+sition contradictorie to a generall so that if the generall proposition be affirmative the exception is negative and if the pro+position be negative contrarywise the exception is affirmative

as for exsamples sake

he that sacrificeth to any gods save to the lorde onely shalbe destroyed saieth moses in the lawe
the proposition is affirmative he that sacrificeth to my gods shalbe destroyed

the exception negative
he that sacrificeth to the lord shall not be destroyed

there is none good but one even god
saith christ in the gospell
the proposition is negative there is none good
the exception affirmative
one is good even god

would to god that all layth paul to agrippa which heare me this daye were alltogether such as am except these bonds
the proposition affirmative
wish that all which heare me were such as am altogether
the exceptio negative
wish not in bonds they were such as am

no church did communicate with me in the account of giving receiving you onely sayth the same paul to the phillippians
the proposition negative no church did co~municate with me in the account of giving and receiving
the exceptio affirmative you of philippi did

likewise in all the rest of adioyned to generall propositions though the markes and tokens as of generalitie sometymes lye hidden in the proposition soe of denying or affirming doe in the exception yet it is plaine and certaine that the proposition and exception matched with it are still of contrarie quallitie the one afirmative if the other negative and ne+gative if the other affirmative
which thing beeing soe see now the iesuits dealing how falsly and absurdly he speaketh against truth reaso
for sith in christs speach touching divorce+ment for whoredome the proposition is affirmative whosoever shall put away his wife and marrie another doth commit adulterie it foloweth that the exception which denieth him to commit adulterie who putting away his wife for whoredome marrieth another is an exception negative but bellarmin sayth that this were an exception affirmative
yea which is more straunge in a man

learned knowing rules of logique but what can artes helpe when men are given over by gods iust iudgment to their owne lusts and errors he e~titeleth it an exceptio affirmative even then and in the same place when where himselfe having set it downe in the words going immediarly next before had given it the marke o~f a negative thus it is not adulterie to marrie another
and as no absurditie doth lightly come alone he addeth fault to fault saying that this is an exceptio negative when no thing is presently determined touching the cause whether it be sufficient to excuse adulterie or no
so first to denie with him was to affirme and next to say nothing now is to deny
yet there is a rule in

law that he who saith nothing denieth not
belike as they coyned vs new divinity at rome so they will new lawe and new lodgique too
howbeit if these principles bee allowed therein by the iesuits authoritie that negative is affirmative to say nought is negative see not but al heretickes vngodly persons may as well as iesuits mainteyne what they list impudently face it out with like distinctions
for if an adversarie of the ghost should be controuled by that we reade to the corinthia~s

the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god his answer after bellarmins patterne were readie that this proveth not the spirit of god to know those things because it might be a negative exception
importing that paul woulde determine nothing presently thereof
if one who dispaired of the mercie of god through conscience of his sines trespasses should be put in minde of christs speach to sinners

yee shall all perish except yee repent he might replie thereto that the exceptio is negative and this though not in the former poynt yet here were true but to make it serve his humour
he must expounde it with bellarmin that christ doth not determin what shall become of the repentant
if a vsurer should be tolde that he

is forbidden to give forth vpon vsurie

or to take encrease a theefe that he is

commanded to labour woorke

so to eate his owne breade they might if they had learned to imitate bellarmin defend their trades both the one by affirming that to forbidd a thing is to say nothing of it the other that to commande be tokeneth to forbid
in a worde whatsoever opinion were reproved as false or action as wicked out of the scriptures denouncing

death eternall and paynes of hell thereto the seduced and disobedient might shift the scriptures of by glosing thus vpon them that false is true and wicked holy life ment by death and heaven by hell
or if the papists would condemne this kinde of distinguishing and expounding places as senselesse and shamelesse then let them give the same sentence of bellarmins that negative is afirmative and to say nothing is to denie
whether they doe or no will with the co~sent liking not of all indifferent iudges and godly minded men who love the truth and not contention conclude that these lying gloses of the iesuits doe not become a christian
and seeing it is proved that an exception negative is not a or passing over a thing in silence which if christ had ment hee could have done with fitt words as wise men are wont but a flat denying of that in on case which the proposition affirmeth in all others it remayneth that christ having excepted out of his generall speech them who for whore dome put away their wives denieth that in them which in all others he affirmeth and thereby teacheth vs that the man who putting away his wife for that cause marrieth another doth not commit adulterie

the next trick of sophistrie whereto as to a shelter our adversaries betake them is that the exception ought to be restreined to the former branche of putting away the wife onely
to the which intent they say that there are some words wanting in the text which must be supplied and perfected thus whosoever shall put away his wife which is not lawfull except it be for whoredome and marrieth another doth commit adulterie
this devise doth bellarmin allowe of as probable though not like the foresayd two of negation and negative exception
but our english pamphletter preferreth it before all
and surely if it were lawfull to foist in these words which is not lawfull the pamphletter might seeme to have shewed greater skill herein then bellarmin
but men of vnderstanding and iudgme~t doe knowe that this were a ready way to make the scripture a nose of waxe and leaden rule as

pighuis doth blasphemously tearme it if every one may adde not what the circu~stances matter of the text sheweth to bee wanting but what himself listeth to frame such sense thereof as

pleaseth his conceit and fansie
the sundrie interlasings of words by sundry authors into this very place and the wrestings of it thereby to sundry senses may to go noe further sufficiently discover the fault and inco~venience of that kinde of dealing

for

the bishop of auila supplieth it in this manner who so putteth away his wife except it bee for whordome though he marrie not another committeth adulterie and whoso putteth her away in whatsoever sorte if he marrie another doth commit adulterie
freier alpho~sus

checketh and controlleth this interpretation partly as too violent for thrusting in so many words partly as vntrue for the former braunch of it sith hee who putteth away his wife not for whoredome although he cause her to commit adulterie yet doth not himselfe commit it vnlesse hee marrie another
wherevpon the frier would have it thus supplied rather
whose putteth away his wife not for other cause but for whoredome and marrieth another doth commit adulterie
but this though it have not soe many words added as the bishop of auilas yet in truth it is more violently forced against the naturall meaning and drift of the text
for by adding these words not for other cause his purpose is to say that whoso putteth away his wife for noe cause but for whoredome yet committeth adulterie if he marrie another much more if he~e marrie having put away his wise for any other cause
and so is christs speech made in effect cleane contrarie to that which his owne words doe geve hee saying whosoever shall put away his wife except it bee for whoredome and the frier forcing him to saie whosoever shall put awaye his wife although it bee for whoredome and shall marrie another doth commit adulterie

nicolas lira beeing as in time more auncient then the frier soe more sincere and single in handling the scripture saith that other words must bee interposed to the supplying of it thus whoso putteth away his wife except it bee for whoredome sinneth and doth agaynst the lawe of marriage and whoso marrieth another doth commit adulterie
wherein though hee deale lesse vyolently with the text then doe the frier and the bishop yet hee offendeth also in their lice~tious humour of adding to the scripture where nothing was wanting and making it thereby to speake that which hee thinketh whereas he should have learned to thinke that which it speaketh yea bellarmin him self acknowledgeth

that they all were overseene herein albeeit censu+ring them with gentler words as he is wont his favorites and freinds
for the explicationsl sayth hee which the bishop of auila alphonsus a castro and others have devised are not soe probable

but why should these be noted by him as improbable yea denyed vnworthy the rehersall and that of his owne though adding in the like sorte which is not lawfull be allowed as probable yea magnyfied as most true by the pamphletter the reasons which they both or rather which ballarmin for the pam+phletter doth no more here but english him as neither els whe+re for the most parte though hee bragg not thereof the reaso~s then which bellarmin doth presse out of the text to breed a per+suasion in his credulous schollers that this interposito is probable and likely are pressed indeed according to the proverb the wringing of the nose causeth bloode to come out
for hee sayth that christ did not place the exception after those words and shall marrie another but straight after those whosoever shall put awaie

and likewise when hee added and whoso marrieeth her that is put away committeth adulterie hee did not ioyne thereto except it bee for whoredome to the intent that hee might shewe that the cause of whoredome doth onely make the putting away to be lawful not the celebrating of a newe marriage too
and how doth he prove that christ did soe place the exception in the former clause to this intent or to this intent did omit it in the latter nay hee proveth it not it is but his coniecture like a sick mans dreame
vnlesse this goe for a proofe that christ did not so place it before without cause nor omit it afterwarde without cause
which if hee meant it should it was for want of a better
for christ did not these things without cause graunt therefore he did the for this cause it foloweth not
paule having occasion to cite a place of scripture doth set it downe thus

come yee out from among the seperate your selves saith the lorde and touche noe vncleane thing
herein hee hath placed the words sayth the lord not after touch noe vncleane thing but after seperate your selves
this did he not without cause what for this cause therefore that he might restraine the words sayth the lord to the former branch as not pertayning to the later also no for it appeareth by the

ptophet esay that they belong to both
it is to be thought then that the spirit of

god who doth nothing without cause did move paul for some cause to place the soe

perhaps for perspicuity commodiousnesse of geving other men thereby to vnderstand the rather that both the words going before and co~ming after were qualified with sayth the lord
which is to be likewise thought of the ex+ception placed by our saviour betweene the two branches of his speech
and that with soe much greater reason in my iudg+ment because if hee had placed it after the later and shall marrie another the words·

except for whoredome might have seemed to signifie that it were lawfull for a man having put away his wife for any cause

to marrie another if hee could not conteine as it is written

because of whoredome let every man have his wife where now the exception being set before the pharisies whose question christ therein did answer could gather noe such poyson out of his words to feede their error but they must needes acknowledge this to be his doctrine that a man may not put away his wife for everie cause and marry another but for whoredome onely
as for christs omitting of the exception afterward bellarmin himself will quickly see there might bee another cause thereof if hee consider how paul repeating this doctrine of christ doth wholly omitt the exception which neverthelesse must needes bee supplyed and vnderstoode
for why doth paul say that to married persons

the lorde gave commaudement let not the wife departe from her husband and let not the husband put away his wife without adding to either parte except it bee for whoredome which the lord did add greatest

doctor saith that hee omitted it because very well knowne most notorious
if then paul had reason to omitt it wholy because it was so well knowne how much more iustly might christ in parte omitt it for the same cause having mentioned it immediatly before made it knowne thereby chiefly that as hee framed his speech to mens vnderstanding so did he folow the common vse of men therein
and if should say vpon the like occasion whosoever draweth his sword except he be a magistrate and killeth a man committeth murder and whosoever abbetteth him that killeth a man committeth murder what man of sense and reason would not thinke meant that the exception set downe in the former sentence touching ma~quellers pertaineth

to the later of there abbetters also and vttered once must serve for both yea even in the former too who would not thinke that my meaning were the exceptio should reach vnto both the branuches of drawing the sword killing a man not to bee abridged tyed vp vnto the first as if had said whosoever draweth his sword which none may doe except he bee a magistrate killeth a man committeth murder yet one who were disposed to play the iesuites parte might thus expound my speech and say taught thereby that peter in deede was iustly reproved for drawing his sword though

he killed not but magistrates are authorized to draw it and noe more not to put men to death

to take vengeaunce on him that doth evill
neithet should he doe mee grea+ter wrong· there in by making mee to speake contrarie to scripture then bellarmin doth christ by the like depraving of the like sentence
but if all these reasons will not persuade his scholars that in christs speach the exceptio of whordome is to be exte~ded to both the points iointly of putting away marrying that bellarmin adding these words which is not lawfull did vnlawfully sow a patch of humaine raggs to the whole garment of gods most precious word behold their owne doctrine allowed established by the councel of tre~t shall force them will they nill they to see it acknowledg it
for if the exceptio be so tyed onely to the former point then a man may not putt away his wife for any cause save for whoredome no not from bed and boord as they tearme it that is from mutuall co~panie society of life although he marry not another
but the councel of tre~t pronounceth and defineth

that there are many causes for the which a man may put away his wife from bed and board where+fore the papists no remedie must graunt that the exceptio cannot so bee tyed vnto the former point onely
and therefore whereas bellarmin sayeth further that he thi~keth it is

thomas of aquines opinio that christs words should bee expounded so

ierom seemeth some what to bee of the same minde the papists peradventure wilbe faine to say that bellarmin was deceived herein
for els not onelie ierom of whom they reckon lesse but

thomas of aquine the sainct of saincts chiefest light of the church of rome shalbe conviuced of errour even by the councell of trents verdict

and these consideracions doe likewise stopp the passage of

another shift which this coosin german to the last intreated of and bellarmin prayseth it alike
to weete that the words committeth adulterie must be supplied and understood in the former parte of christs sentence thus whosoever putteth away his wife except it be for whoredome committeth adulterie and whoso marrieth another committeth adulterie

salomon did wisely iudg that shee was not the mother of the childe who would have it devided but shee who desired it might bee saved entier
surely the iesuite hath not those bowels of kinde and loving affection towards christs that a christia should who can finde in his heart to have it devided of one living body na~ely whosoever putteth away his wife except it be for whordo~e and marrieth another co~mitteth adulterie made as it were two peeces of a dead carkas the first whosoever putteth away his wife except it bee for whoredome committeth adulterie the seco~d whoso marrieth another co~miteth adultrie
which dealing beside the inco~venie~ce of making the scripture a nose of waxe lead~e rule if men may add what pleaseth the spetialy if they may also ma~gle sente~ces chop the in sundry parts but beside this mischief here it hath a greater that christ most true and holy is made thereby to speake an vntruth
for a man may put away his wife for other cause then for whoredome yet not co~mit adulterie himselfe
yes hee committeth it sayth bellarmin in his wives adultery whereof hee was the cause by putting her vniustly away
but reply that it is one thing to cause his wife to co~mitt it another to commit it himself
and christ when hee was minded to note these severall faults did it with

severall words expressinge them accordinglye
moreover vnderstandinge the tearme to put away not as

the force thereof doth yeeld christ tooke it for loosing of the ba~d of marriage but for a sepe ration from bed and boord onely as bellarmin vnderstandeth it he cannot allowe the sentence which hee fathereth one christ though soe expounded without either condemning of the trent councel or beeing himself condemned by it

for if whosoever seperateth his wife from him but for whoredome doth committ adulterie in causing her to committ it then is it a sinne to seperate her for any cause save for whoredome
if it bee a sinne the

church of rome erreth in houlding and decreeing that shee may bee seperated

for sundrie other causes
but whosoever sayth that the churche erreth herein is accursed by the

councell of trent
the councell of trent therefore doth co~sequently curse bellarmin if hee say that christ spake his wordesin that sense in which he co~stru+eth them
and doth it notcurse

austin also

theophilact who bellarmin alleageth as saying the same at least it declareth that in the cou~cels iudgment the fathers missexpou~d the scrip tures sometymes even those verie places on which the papists cite the assounde interpreters of the scripture
now the speech of christ being cleared saved entier from all cavils the meaning thereof is playne as have shewed that he who having put a way his wife for whoredo~e marrieth another co~mitteth not ad+ulterie
for soe much importeth the exception negative of the cause of whoredo~e opposed to the generall affirmative proposi+tio wherewith our saviour answered the question of the pharisi+es touchcing divorceme~ts vsed by the iewes who putting awaye there wives for any cause did marrie others

the onely reason of adversaries remayning to bee answered stood vppon and vrged by them as moste effectuall and for cible to the contrarye is an example of like sentences from which sith the like conclusion say they cannot bee inferred as wee inferre of this the inferrence or this is faultye
and faultie graunt they might esteeme it iustly if the like con+clusions coulde not bee drawen from the like sentences

but lett the examples which they bring for proofe here of be throughly sifted and it will appeare that either the sentences are vnlike or the like conclusitons may bee inferred of them
for of three sentences proposed to this end the the firste is out of scripture in iames epistle

to him that knoweth how to doe well and doth it not to him there is sinn
a sentence though in shewe vnlike to that of christs for the pro+position and exception both yet having in deede the force of the like if it be thus resolved
to him that doth not well except hee know not how to doe well there is sinn
and why may it not be concluded hereof that there is no sinn to him who knoweth not how to doe well doth it not because there are sinns of ignoraunce saith bel+larmin he who knoweth not how to doe well and doth it not sinneth though lesse then hee that offendeth wittingly
knowe not whether

this be a snine of ignorauns in bellarmin or no that when he should say if he will check the conclusion there is sinne to ignorant he saith as if that were all one the ignoraunt sinneth

betwene which two things there is a great difference in iames his meaning
for iames in these words there is sinne to him doth speake emphatically noteth in that man the same that our saviour did in the pharisies when because they boasted of their sight knowledg

he told the that they had sinne meaning by this phrase as himself expoundeth it that their sinne remained that is to say continued and stoodt firme setled
the custome of the greeke tongue wherein iames wrote doth geve this phrase that sense as also the syriaque the language vsed by christ translating christs words after the same manner the matter treated of doth argue that he meant not generally of sinne but of sinne being cleaving to a man in spetiall peculiar sort
for as

the servant that knew his maisters will and did not according to it shalbe beaten with many stripes but he that knew it not and yet did committ things worthy of stripes shalbee beaten with fewe
likewise in tra~sgression whereto the punishment auswereth he that knoweth how to doe well doth it not sinne is to him hee hath it he offendeth not ably but he that knoweth not how to doe well doth evill hath not sinne sticking to him his sinne remaineth not hee sinneth not so greatly greivously
wherefore when bellarmin draweth out of that sentence such a conclusio as if iames in saying there is sinne to him had simply meant hee sinneth bellarmin mistaketh the meaning of the sentence which if the text it self cannot informe him

his doctors well considered may
but take the right meaning the conclusion wilbe sound
whosoever doth not good and honest things except it he of ignoraunce he sinneth desperatelie mainely
therefore whoso of ignorance omitteth to doe them he sinneth not desperately
and thus our conclusion drawen fro christs sentence is rather confirmed the preiudiced by this example
yea let even


austin whose authoritie bellarmin doth ground on herein be diligently marked and himself in matching these sente~nces together bewrayeth an oversight which being corrected will helpe the truth with light stre~gth
for to make the one of the like the other hee is faine to fashion christs speech in this fort to him who putteth away his wife without the cause of whoredome marrieth another

to him there is the cryme of committing adulterie
now christ hath not

these words of emphaticall propertie and strong signification whereby he might teach as angustin gathereth that whosoever putteth away his wife for any cause save for whoredome and marrieth another comitteth adulterie in an high degree and soe imply by consequence that who soe marrieth another though having put away his former wife for whoredome yet committeth adulterie too a lesse adulterie

but that which christ saith is simple flatt absolute

he committeth adulterie
and therefore as it may be inferred out of iames that he who omitteth the doing of good through ignoraunce sinneth not with a loftie hand in resolute stifnes of an hardned heart soe conclude wee rightly out of christs wordes that hee who having put away his wife for whoredome marri+eth another committeth not adulterie in any degree at all

the first sentence then alleaged by austin and after him pressed by our adversaries out of the scripturs is soe farr from disprooving that it prooveth rather the like conclusions from the like sentences
the seconde and thirde are out of theire owne braynes the one of bellarmins forging the other of the pamphletters bellarmins hee that stealeth except it bee for neede sinneth
the pamphlctrers hee that maketh a except it bee for a vauntagoe doth wilfully sinn
whereof they say it were a wrong and badd inferrence that hee sinneth not who stealeth for neede and hee who lyeth for a vauntage sinneth not wilfully
a badd infer+rence indeed
but the fault therof is in that these sentences are not like to christs
for christs is from heaven full of truth and wisdome these of men fond and imply vntruth
they might have disputed as fitly to their purpose and prooved it as forcibly if they had vsed this example all beasts ex+cept apes and are devoyd of reason
or this all longeared creatures except asses are beasts
for hereof it could not bee concluded iustly that asses are not beasts and apes are not devoyd of reason
no
but this perhaps might bee concluded iustly that he had not reason nor was farre from a beast that would make such sentences
considering that all men who write or speake with reason meane that to be denied in the per+ticular which they doe except from a generall affirmed
and

therefore sith hee sinneth who stealeth

though for neede as the wise man sheweth and hee that lieth for a vauntage doth willfully sinne yea the more wilfully somtymes because for a vaun+tage as when the christ it were a verie fond and witlesse speech to say that whosoever stealeth except it bee for neede sinneth and whosoever lyeth except it bee for a vauntage doth wilful+ly sinne
wherefore these sente~ces are no more like to christs the copper is to gould or wormewood to the bread of heaven

neither shall they ever finde any sentence like to his indeede of which the like conclusio may not be inferred as we inferre of that
and soe the maine ground of my principall reason proposed in the beginning remayneth sure clearly prooved that he by christs sentence co~mitteth not adulterie who having put a way his wife for whoredome marrieth another
whereof seeing it followeth necessarely that he who hath put away his wife for whordo~e may lawfully marrie another as there declared it followeth by the like necessity of co~seque~ce that the popish doctrine mainteined by our adversaries denying the same is contrarie to the scripture doth gainsay the truth delivered by the sonne of god

the second chapter

the places of scripture alleaged by the adversaries to disproove the lawfull liberty of marriage after divorcement for adulterie are proposed examined and prooved not to make agaynst it

sainct austin in his learned bookes of christian doctrine wherein hee geves rules how to finde the right and true sence of scriptures doth well

aduise the faithful first to search and marke those things which are set downe in the scripturs plainly and then to goe in hande with sifting and of the darke places that the darker speeches may be made evident by patterns and examples of the more playne manifest and the records of certayne vndoubted setences may take away doubt of the u~certayne

this wholsome and iudicious counsaile of augustin if our adversaries had bene as carefull to follow as they are willing to shew they follow him in these things which he hath writ+ten lesse advisedly they would not have alleaged and vrged the places of scripture which they doe agaynst the poynt of doctrine prooved out of the niententh chapter of mathew
for christ in that place doth open the matter and decide the question most plainly and fully of purpose answering the pharises
in others either it is not handled of purpose incidently or in sett downe more briefly and soe more darkly and
wherefore if any of the other places had seemed vnto them to rayse vp a scruple and shew of some repugnancie they should have taken paynes to explayne and levell it by that in mathew the darker by the clearer the brieffer by the the vncertaine and ambiguous by the vn+doubted and certayne
but seeing they have chosen to follow austins oversights rather the his best advises in like sorte as

furius an orator of rome did imitate fimbria whose force of speech and arguments hee attained not to but

broadly and set his mouth awry like him wee must say of the as christ of the pharisies

let them alone they are blynd leaders of the blynd and ourselves endevour to follow augustin in that he followed christ who cleared

the darker place of moses by

the playner word and ordinance of god
the which if wee doe wee shall by gods grace easily perceive that none af all the places alleaged by our adversaries doth make agaynst the doctrine already prooved and concluded

for the first of them is in the fifth of mathew

whosoever shall putt away his wife except it for whordome doth cause her to commit adulterie and whoso marrieth her that is put away doth committ adulterie these words sayth bellarmin and looke what bellarmin sayth the pamphletter sayth with him so that one of their names may serve for both and reason bellarmin have the honour these words
and whoso marrieth her that is put away doth commit adulterie must be either generally taken without exception or with the exception
except it bee for whoredome
if generally then he who marrieth her that is put away even for whoredome too doth committ adulterie
the band then of marriage is not and loosed by her putting away but company debarred onely
for hee that marrieth her should not commit adulterie vnlesse shee were bound yet to her former husband
and thus farr bellarmin sayth well but superfluously
for the words may not bee generally taken sith they have relation to the former sentence whereto they are coupled and that sentence speaketh of her which is put away except for whore dome
their meaning then must bee that hee who mar+rieth her which is so put away doth commit adulterie
neither could bellarmin bee ignoraunt hereof or doubt with any likely hoode but that this is our iudgment and would bee our answer
wherefore his two forked dispute about the words was a flourish onely to make vs a frayde as if hee fought with a two hand sword which would kill all that came in his way
but now hee goeth forward vpon his enemies pike layeth about him on the other side
if the words must bee taken with the exception then hee that marrieth a whore put away from her husband committeth not adulterie
and consequently the whore is in better case then the innocent and chaste
for the whore is free and may be mar+ried wheras the innocent that is vniustly put away can neither have

her former husband nor marrie another
but this most absurd that the law of christ beeing most iust would have her to bee in better case and state that is iustly put away then her that is vniustly
for answer vnto which reason of bellarmin would spurr him a ques+tion whether by the popes law which forbiddeth a man that

hath bene twise maried or

hath maried a widow to take orders admitteth on thereto that hath kept or happely keepeth many concubines a whormonger bee in better case then an h+onest man and if a whoremonger bee so by the popes law

whether wee ought to iudge that this is most absurd or noe
here if hee should answer mee that the popes law is not most iust and therefore noe marvell if it have some such things as were most ab+surd to bee imagined by christs law must acknowledge hee spake reason
well would spurre him then another questio whether hee thinke that am in better case then any iesuit yea then the best of them all
phy hee will answer there is noe co~parison
the best nay the worst of them is in better case then am yet may marry if list and none of them may because of their vowe
belike this was not established by the law of christ which is most iust but by

the popes lawe rather
or it is most absurd that a poore christian should bee in better case then the proudest iesuit
but heere peradventure the man will say rather that wee are heretiques and they catho+liques and the meanest catholique is in better case even for his faiths sake then any heretique whatsoever which if he doe as it is likely neither can hee say ought with probability but to this effect then hath hee confuted and overthrowen his own argument
for by this answere hee cannot chuse but graunt that the simplest woman being put away vnjustly from her husband is in better case for her chastities sake though shee may not marrie then whatsoever whore that may
and hope hee wil not say that the stewes and curtizans at rome are in better case then honest matrons there divorced from their husbands
yet may none of these while their husbands live bee ioyned to others whereas the curtizans are free to marrie whom they will if any will marrie them who are soe free
howbeit lest any place of ca+velling bee left him and of pretending a difference betweene those who having had the vse of marriage lose the benefit of it

and those who lose it not having never had it will sett before him a playne demonstration therof in married persons
seianus as the

romaine historie recordeth did putt away his wife apicata vnjustly thereby to winne the rather the favour of li+via which was the wife of drusus
livia being carried away with the wicked entisements of seianus was not onely nought of her body with him but consented also to make away her husband drusus with poyson now let bellarmin tell vs whether of these two were in better case apicata or livia livia the adulteresse murderesse of hir husband being free to marry or chast apicata being bound to live solitary
if hee say livia should have bene put to death by the

romaine law because of her murder and then had shee not bene in better case then apicata for liber+ty to marrie reply that likewise by the law of

moses the wo+man whom christ speaketh of should have bene put to death because of her adultery and soe the doubt here ceased too
but the law of moses being left on the adulterous woman as the romain was for the tyme of livia let bellarmin a~swer to the poynt not as of livia onely but of any whore that hath wrought her husbands death and for want of proofe or through the magistrats fault is suffered to live whether shee be in better case then an honest chast religious matron that is put away from her husband vnjustly
which if hee dare not say considering on the one side the plagues that

in this life and

in the life to come are layd vp for such on the other the blessed

promises of them both to the godly then hee hath noe refuge but hee must needs confesse that his argument was fond
for the murdering whore is not an adulteresse by the law of christ though shee take another man her husband being deade and yet the chast matron were an adulteresse if shee married while her husband liveth who hath vnjustly putt her away
wherein this notwithsta~ding is to be weighed that a chast womans case is not so hard in comparison of the whores

no
not for marriage neither as bellarmin by cunning of speech would make it seeme to therewith his rea+so
for he frameth his

words so as if the had no possibility of remedy at all neither by having her former husband nor by marrying another therefore were in worse case the the whore

who is free to marrie whereas the truth is that by christs lawe shee not

onely may but

ought to have her former husband

and why should not shee bee as likely to recover her husbands goodwill to whom shee hadd bene faithfull as a faythlesse whore and infamous strumpett to get a newe husband

chiefly seing that it is to bee presumed they loved ech other they married and experience sheweth that

falling out of lovers is a renewing of love
but if through the frowardnes of men on the one side foolishnes on the other the chaste wife could hardly reco~cile her husba~d the whore get easily a match it that the law of christ cannot bee justly charged with absurdity though it doe enlarg the vnchast and lewd in some outward thing in which it enlargeth not the chast
no more then

the providence of god may bee controlled and noted of iniquity though

the evill wicked enioy certaine earthly blessings in this life which are not graunted to the vpright godly
wherefore the first place of scripture out of mathew enforcrd by bellarmin with his

horned argument as the logitions tearme it doth serve him as much to annoy our cause the iron hornes made in achabs favour by zedechiah the falce prophet did stand him in stead to push and consume the hoste of the aramites

the second place is written in the tenth of marke

who so putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adulterie agaynst her and if a woman put away her husband and be married to another shee committeth adulterie
the like whereof is also in the sixteenth of luke

whosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery
these words sayth bellarmin doe teach generally that marriage co~tracted perfected betweene the faithfull is never so dissolved that they may lawfully ioyne in other wedlocke
and whereas wee answer that these general sentences are to be expounded with a saving of the exception mentioned in

mathew because one evangelist doth add oftentymes that another omitteth mathew els where contrary vnto marke and luke which sith they all wrote as they were moved by the holy spirit of truth is impossible bellarmin replieth that the evangelists in deed omitt or add somewhat now and than which other eevangelists

have not omitted or added but they doe never omitt in such sorte that the sentence is made false
a straunge kinde of speeche as if all generall sentences were false from the which some spetialtie though not expressed in the same place yet by with others is vnderstood to bee expressed
sure the civill lawe which in learned mens opinions hath much truth will then bee stayned foully with vntruthes and lyes
for how ma+ny sentences and rules are set downe in it with full and generall tearmes whereof notwithsta~ding there is none

lightly but suf+fereth an exception
the canon law also whose creditt and authority bellarmin must tender howsoever he doe the civill hath store of such axiomes and

teacheth accordingly that a particular doth derogate from the generall
but what speake of mens lawes in the scripture it self iob sayth that

the hipocrite shall perish for ever like the dung and david that the

wicked shall turne into hell all nations that forgett god
salomon that

everie man is an abomination to the lord though hand ioyne in hand hee shall not bee vnpunished
these sentences of iob david and salomon are true in the belief of christians yet forasmuch as they must bee vnderstood with an exception according to the doctrine of

christ and

his servants saying vnto sinners except yee repent yee shall all perish in the iesuits iudgement they are made false
and ionas semblablie when hee preached to the ninivits

yet forty days and niniveh shalbe overthowen abvsed the with an vntruth though

learned men doe finde a trueth in his speech as being to be thus taken that niniveh should bee over throwen except it repented
or if bellarmin also acknowledg the same which hee may not choose vnlesse of a iesuit hee will become a iulian and quite renounce the christian fayth then acknowledgeth hee that hee playeth the parte of a guilefull sophister or a malitious rhetoricia in signifying that the sente~ce of christ is made false if it bee expounded and vnderstoode with an exception otherwhere expressed
and withall by consequence hee acknowledgeth farther that it is an idle braynsick amplification herevppon lavisheth out iesuit like and vaynely mispendeth paynes and tymes about it by saying that els if the sentence forsooth were false the evangelists had deceived men to whom they delivered their gospells making noe mention of

other evangelists and that when marke wrote his gospel at rome recei+ved by the preaching of peter hee did not send the romaeines backe to mathews gospel as to a commentary nay if mathews gospel hadd bene then at rome in the hands of the faythfull it may be wel thought that marke would not have written and that marke wrote not to add ought to mathew as iohn did afterward but onely that the romaines might the better remember that which peter taught for

irenaee

eusebius and

ierom geve this cause and that luke wrote his gospel for those nations to whom paul had preached and vnto who the booke of mathew and marke were not yet come but certayne false writings of false evangelists onely as

himself sheweth briefly and it is more clearly gathered out of

ambrose

eusebius and

ierom

and in conclusio that the things which marke and luke say must be absolutely true not depend of mathews words vn+lesse our meaning bee that they were deceived who did read marke or luke without mathew
for by this reason of bellarmin the words of iob david salomon and ionas must bee absolutely true and not depend of christs words in luke or by esay vnles our meanig be that they were deceived who read the psalmes of david or salomons proverbs or heard iob or ionas speake without christ which likewise might receive a gay shewe by saying that els if these sentences were false these holy men had deceived them to whom they spake or wrote making noe mention of other holy teachers and that when iob and david and salomon and ionas did either write or speake they did not put me over vnto luke or esay as to a comentarie nay iobs words were vttered before either of them or any of christs of the whole scripture wrote as

sundry of the fathers doe pro+bably teach

ionas did looke that niniveh should be over thro+we according to his absolute speech so farre was he of from se~d+ing the ninivites to such as specifie the exception besides that had hee sent them whither should they have gone who neither knewe the scriptures and

lived before the tyme of luke and esay both david too and salomon were their auncients farre and ech did sett forth the one his psalmes the other his proverbs even those which they did writ not all at once but by partes and partly

their owne titles and

other sciptures argue partly

athanasius

theodoret and

bede signifie neither

did luke or esay write to add ought to the psalmes or proverbs or to the words of iob or ionas as

ezra did to the booke of kings but esay to publish onely his owne prophecie and the storie touching it luke the gospel of christ and acts of the apostles
here were a trimme tale which might be very forcible with a man forlorne like iudas iscariot to perswade him that the sentences of iob of david of salomon of ionas concerning the distruction of hypocrits and all the wicked are not to bee expounded out of luke or esay with an exception of repentance
yea this should of reason have greater force and weight then bellarmins of the same spinning
for he sayth that marke did not write his gospell to add ought to mathew
which thing beeing graunted yet marke notwithstanding might be expounded by mathew and soe much the rather mathew having specified an exception that marke omitteth as

the lawiers teach that their generall rules were not written to add ought vnto the former yet must bee expounded with the excep+tions touched in the former lawes
but in the that have woven after bellarmins patterne it is contrariewise that esay and luke did not write to add ought to the psalmes or proverbs or to the words of iob or ionas which hath greater colour to prove that their sayinges should not bee absolutely true and not depend of exceptions mentioned so long after neither meane to bee ioyned to them chiefly for alianes from the of israell such as they that heard iob and ionas were who lived not to read the doctrine of christ in his prophets and apostles
wherefore seeing bellarmin is for+ced to acknowledg it were a lewd parte to reason and conclude this on generall sentences of iob david salomon that an hypocrite a wicked a man shall not bee forgiven saved though hee repent much more must hee acknowledg a fault in his disputing and gathering out of marke luke that a man having put awaye his wife maye not marrye another though hee have put her away for whoredome
and hereby wee may see what honour they both himself and the pamphlet ter who in this whole discourse goeth with him soote by foote save that by enterlacing more fond vnsavory words him sometymes a cover well beseeming and worthy

such a cuppe onely somewhat broader but hereby wee may see what honour they have done

austin in knitting vpp their tale with his words who are wee that wee should say some putting away their wives and marrying other commit adulterie and some doeing soe commit it not whereas the gospel sayth that every one committeth adultery who doth so even as much honour as themselves should gayne if in the forlorne mans case which spake of they were his ghostly fathers and put him in this comforte who are wee that wee should say some wickedmen shall goe to hell na+mely the vnrepentant some the repentant shall not goe whereas the scripture sayth that everie wicked man shall goe to hell
lett this kinde of dealling in refuting matters bee once allowed for currant and every priest and iesuit as well as the pope will have more royall power even over princes what should say over common christians for whereas it is written in the epistle to the collosians

children obey your parents in all things prophets were honoured with the name of fathers not onely by their

schollers the children of the prophets but also by the

kings of israel the

title of father geve to all priests though not in such degree as to

the pope yet to all priests and to iesuits especialy insomuch that a

great person of rome doth terme them not fathers onely with the people but the reverend fathers the catholique fathers the good fathers of the society of the holy name of iesus this title then applied and geven to them all will quickly winne their schollers to thinke that the

obedience commaunded towards them is obedience in all things
now we pro+testants teach that neverthelesse supposing they were in deed fathers not caterpillers of the churche yet if priest or iesuit or the pope himself should commaund a man to commit murder or whoredome or theft hee might not bee obeyed because it is written in the epistle to the ephesiaus

children obey your parents in the lord whence that to the collosians ought to bee expounded that parents must bee so farre forth obeyed in all things as standeth with the dewty which children owe to god and in pietie they may
but if some catholique father should denie this and say like father robert that paule in deed ommitteth or addeth somewhat in one epistle which hee hath not omitted or added in another but hee doth never omit in such sorte that the sentence

is made faulse for els paule hadd deceived the collossians to whom hee sent that epistle making no mention of that other to the ephesians and surely when hee wrote to the collosians from rome he did not send them back to his ephesian epistle as to a commentary nay if that epistle had bene in their hands it may bee well thought that hee would not have written to them
eor hee did not write the epistle to the collossians thereby to add ought to that which he had writte vnto the ephessians as hee did the later to the corinthians or thessalonians after the former but onely to reclayme the collossians from their errour that man is reconciled and hath accesse to god by angels and to corect their iewish and heathenish observations for

chrysosto

theophylact and

oecumenius geve this cause
that which paule therefore sayth to the collossians must bee absolutly true and not depend of that he sayth to the ephesians vnlesse our meaning bee that they were deceived who read the epistle to the collossians without the other
if some catholique father say should speake thus agaynst our interpreting of scripture by scripture would not his children trow yee thinke it strongly invincibly proved that they must obey him absolutely in all things chiefly if as father robert bringeth austin soe he brought

cassianus chrisostoms scholar in who prayseth one mutius a novice of an abbey in egypt as a most worthy paterne of obedience to his abbat or father as you would say for that he was ready to cast his owne natural sonne a litle child into the river at his commandeme~t soe as much as lay in him did murder his son but that some by the abbats appoyntement did receive him beinge caste out of his fathers hands towards the river and saved him from drowning
for hee

who extolleth this novices fayth and devotion to heave affirming that the abbat was by revelation straightway advertised that mutius hadd performed

abraham the patriarks worke by the obedience as if there were noe difference between the

lords commandement and an abbats might have formed a like austins in defence thereof who are wee that wee should say children in some things must obey their parents and in some they must not whereas the scripture sayth
children obey your parents in all things
by the which construction whatsoever a mans mother should command him must bee obeyed too shee being comprehended in the name of parents and what

soever a mans

maister should command hee beeing also a father and whatsoever

any governour should co~mand or frend that hath done good or an olde ma they being fa+thers all though not by nature yet by office benefit or age
and then had king

asa done evill in putting downe his mother maachah from her state because shee hadd made an idole in a grove in breaking downe her idoll and stamping it burning it
and

doeg the edomite had deserved greater prayse then sauls servants sith they would not move their hands to fal vpom the lords priests when their maister bidd them which doeg did and his wrath to the vttermost
and the

apostles hadd overseene themselves when they disobeyed the high priest and rulers and elders of israel and gave this reason of it wee ought rather to obey god then men
yea that wrecthed impious execrable fryer who did more then barbarously murder his soveraigne lords the

french king the annoynted of the highest may then bee excused excused nay commended and praysed by papists as having done that which hee ought seing it is likely that either pope or priest or iesuit or abbat or some of his superiours commanded him to doe it
such absurd consequents of bellarmins affirming that markes and lukes words must bee absolutely true and not depend of mathew doe shew what great reason hee had soe to speake
for it is written of the cittie of ierusalem compared with the canaanites amorites and hittites

such mother such daughter in like sort may it be sayd of this constructio of the holy scripture compared with bellarmins
such conseque~ce such antecedent
and thus farre of his second place

the third is in the epistle to the romaines the seve~th chap

knowe yee not bretheren for speake to the that knowe the law that the law hath dominion over a man as long as hee liveth for the woman which is in subiection to a man is bound by the law to the man while hee liveth but if the man bee dead shee is delivered from the law of the man
so then if while the man liveth shee take another man shee shalbe called an adulteresse but if the may be dead shee is free from the law soe that shee is not an adulteresse though shee take another man
out of which place and

the like in the seaventh of the first epistle to the corinthians wee gather saith bellarmin that the band of marriage

is never loosed but by death and that seing it is not loosed it remayneth after divorcement too for whatsoever cause the divorce bee made
this doth bellarmin gather but gathering soe hee reapeth that which the holy ghost sowed not
for pauls meaning in those words to the romains and corinthians was that the band of marriage is not loosed comonly and ordinarily while both the parties live not that absolutely it is never loosed till one of the die
as in the like case to open the matter by his owne examples hee

sayth who goeth to warrfare any tyme at his owne cost now some have servd at their owne charges without pay sometymes
for soe did the

roma stocke of the fabij agaynst the vientians and

clinias an athenian citizen agaynst the persians
but men for the most parte are waged publiquely therevnto
and that is the poynt which paule respected
againe

who planteth a vineyard eateth not of the fruite thereof hee on who they father the first occasion of that proverb many things doe happen between the cupp and the lipp is sayd not to have drunke of the fruite of the vineyard which himselfe had planted nor to have eaten thereof belyke
at least seing

old men plant trees for their posterity neither might

the iewes eate of their fruite in certayne yeares it is more then likely that many of them did not
some did not questionlesse they namely who sustained the curse which god denounced vnto them by moses

thou shelt plant a vineyard and shalt not vse the fruite thereof
yet paule sayd wel because such as plant vines doe enioy them common+ly
agayne

who feedeth a flocke and eateth not of the milke of the flocke they eat not of the milke who doe not milke their sheepe at all and

there bee who doe not for feare of impayring thereby the lambs or woole
but it is sufficient for pauls purpose the truth of his speech that men in most

cuntreis are wont to have the milked they who vndertake the paines of feeding flockes are accustomed to eate of the milkes of the flockes
againe

no man ever hated his owne flesh but nourisheth cherisheth it· cato the yonger who slewe himself at vtica

was so farr from nourishing and cherishing his body that when his bowels being gushed out thereof hee was not yet dead hee tore them in pieces with his owne hands as

rasias also did
neither would paule have denied this who knewe that

many hadd

killed themselves and taken away all ioyes of life fro their flesh
onely he meant that noe man hath ever lightly hated it but every one doth nourish and cherish it rather

noe man that warreth entangleth himself with the affaiers of life because he would please him that hath chosen him to be a souldier
what is this false because

the rich crassus being chosen by the romains to bee their generall in syria did without all care of pleasing them who chose him plaie the marchant man and occupied himself in councels money matters or because a

band of campanian souldyers who served the king of sicilie gave themselves to citizens trades and occupations having by treachery seazed on messana dispossessed the townesmen devided their wives goods and lands among the a ba~d of romans did the like in rhegiu to the disco~tentme~t of such as chose the to be soldiers no for the apo+stle who exhorted timothy

to behave himself as a good honest sould yer of christ was not to learn that there are some vnhonest sould yers retchlesse of their duty
but his meaning was that soldyers vsually do employ the~selves on warrlike exercises not on ci+vill affayers or domesticall busines whe they are chosen once to serve in the same sence did he likewise say that a married woma is bound by the law vnto her husba~d while he liveth because the band of marriage is not vsually and ordinarily loosed but by death though it may bee loosed and is sometymes otherwise on rare vnwontted causes
which is apparant to have bene his mean+ning by that hee teacheth

that if an vnbeleeuing man who hath a christian wife doe forsake her then

shee is not in bondage
for if she be not in bondage shee is

free to marrie as the words of scripture imply by the contrary and the

pope declareth
if shee bee free to marrie the band of the former marriage is loosed els were shee bound and not free
wherefore sith the popes authenticall record doth prove out of paule that a wife in some case is free to marrie another while her husba~d liveth the papists must acknowledg that paul meant the band is not comonly loosed but by death not that it is never at all loosed otherwise absolutely and simply
bellarmin to frustrate and avoyde this answere sayth that it may bee proved by foure reasons which hee bringeth forth poore vnarmed weake ones of his owne mustering and with a strong hand putteth them to flight

that soe men imagining these are all that can be alleaged on our side for the proofe thereof might thinke that our whole force is quite discomfited and bellarmin hath wone the feilde
have heard say that there is cunning in daubing
surely there is cunning in this kinde of dealing
neither is it for nothing that

one of their glorious champions doth vaunte that the co~mon sorte of catholiques are able to say more for vs the wee can for our selves
in deede they would beare the co~mo sorte in hand that their learned men in handling of questions and controversies of religion doe set downe all obiectio~s that can be made of our parte
and graunt they set downe more then ofte tymes themselves can soundly answere
yet they vse discretion therein by their leave and many a strong reason which would trouble them fowly if it came in place they are content to winck at and say nothing of it whereto they joyne this policy now and the also that they take vpon them to bee as it were our proctours and at turneys in shewing what may bee sayd for vs vnder which pretence they bring in such things as having a ready solution with the obiection and proving vnsound may turne to out causes discredit and to ours
so the iesuit here his argument being grounded vppon two places the one to the romans the other to the corinthyans wee countermyning the whole with one answere hee sayth that our answere may bee proved by foure reasons which hee gathereth out of circumstances of the former place all such as the later hath neither any kinred with and discoverceth them to be of no valew
but of the reasons which have brought to prove our answere fitting both the places and partly confirming that paule might well meane the same in these which in the like hee meant partly demonstra+ting that certaynly hee did soe because it were not true els that hee teacheth of the libertie of christians forsaken by the vnbeleevers these reasons bellarmin doth not touch
no marveil for they are too hot
and it is likely that he studied not what might be most stronglie said in our defence but rather what most weakely that so he might seeme to ioyne battaile with vs and yet might bee sure to doe himself no harme letting passe therefore the help which he offreth in like sorte to vs as the

sa ritanes did vnto the iewes come vnto the vniust and false accusation

wherewith

they sought to hinder the buylding of the temple meane to the reasons which hee vntruely sayth doe witnesse our answer and exposition to bee faulse
those hee draweth to three heads whereof the first hath two braunches one that pauls words are playne the other that they are oft repeated
for what is more playne sayth hee then thet

if while the man liveth the woman take another man shee shall be called an adulteresse and that

the woman is bound by the lawe as longe as her liveth playne denie not
but this proofe how pithy strong soever hee thought it to set it his is already shewed to bee no proofe at all sith there are as playne words in like sentences which neverthelesse must bee expounded as these are by vs
for what more playne then that

who goeth a warrefare any tyme at his owne cost and that who planteth a vineyard and eateth net of the fruite thereof and that whofeadeth a flocke and eateth not of the milke of the flocke and that

no man ever hated his owne flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it that

no man entangleth himselfe with the affayres of life

many other such that might bee aleaged if in a thing so cleare it were not superfluous nay in these sente~ces the words are more playne then in those wee speake of because those have noe such marke of generality expressed as these have
wherefore if soe great playnnesse of words signed with generall toke~s as it were importing that they are true in all yet convinceth not that they are meant of all without any exception fully and vniversally how can a lesser playnnesse wanting such efficacie convince the same of those in question or if it should elswhere by reason of some difference which might supplie by other weight that this wanteth yet here it cannot possibly because

paule himself as have declared sheweth that in one case the sayings could not so bee true moreover the

papists hold that if a married man become a monke before he know his wife carnally shee may law+fully take another husba~d while he liveth
perhaps further also that the pope for any very weighty cause maye vpon the same circumstance dispense and loose the band of marriage
at least

tell vs that sundry popes have done so and

their great doctors hould wee may
yet is the woman his wife who hath wedded her or espoused her onely though shee hath not

entred into his
for shee that is betrothed is accounted a wife by the law

of god and consent not carnall company maketh marriage as the civill

lawiers

fathers

popes doe teach
the papists then of all men may worst enforce the playnesse of pauls words agaynst our exposition the selves condescending in cases more then wee doe that a woman may take another man while her husband liveth and bee noe adulteresse
whereby agayne appeareth how wisely discreet+ly the iesuit triumpheth with

austins words these words of the apostle so oftentymes repeated so oftentymes inculcated are true are quick are sound are playne
the woman beginneth not to be the wife of any later husband vnlesse shee have ceased to bee of the former and shee shall cease to bee of the former if her husband die not if he playe the whoremonger
the wife then is lawfully putt away for whordom but the band of the former lasteth in somuch that hee becometh guilty of adulterie who marrieth her that is put away even for whoredom

for if these words of austin bee quick and sound against vs then touch they poperie at the quick sith it may be sayd by the same reason the woman beginneth not to bee the wife of any later husband vnlesse shee have ceased to bee of the former and shee shall cease to bee of the former if her husband die not if hee waxe a monke

admitt then that the wife bee put away for monkery yet the band of the former lasteth insomuch that hee becometh guilty of adulterie who marrieth her that is put away even for monkery
and likewise whatsoever those weighty causes were for which so

many popes have loosed the bande of marriage they are all controlled by the same censure the woman beginneth not to be bee the wife of any later husband unlesse shee have ceased to bee of the former and shee shall cease to bee of the former if her husband die not if a better match be offered or some mislyke bee conceived or the pope dispense and bee well freed from it
nay paul himself must fall within the co~passe of austins reprofe by construing his words so without exception because they are true and quick and sound and playne
for against his doctrine towching a susters liberty to marry if shee be forsaken of her vnbeleeving husband the force of austins consequence would inferre in like sorte the woman beginneth not to bee the wife of any later husband vnlesse shee have ceased to be of the former and shee shall cease to bee of the former if her husband

die not if hee forsake her
the iesuit who vseth so often to repeat so often to inculcate the testimonies of the fathers should deale peradventure more considerately more charitably out of doubt if before hee cite them hee weighed their words better whether they may stand with the truth of scripture with his owne doctrine
for els as

cham discovered the nakednes of noah so doth hee their blemishes hee who aleageth them not wee whom hee enforceth to shewe why wee dissent from them least our saviours sentence bee pronounced agaynst vs

hee that loueth father or mother more then mce is not worthy of mee
but the iesuites meaning you wil say was not to discredit them by laying a necessitie on vs to refute them what was his meaning then by their credit to discredit the scripturs with the truth whereof their sayings doe not stand for trust hee meant not to overthrowe the poynts of his owne doc+trine which their sayings crosse vnlesse hee bee of that mynde which

tullie condemneth as barbarous and savage expressed in an heathnish verse let ovr friends fall soe that ovr foes die withall
howsoever it be it is plain that the plaines of pauls words neither doth prove the sence thereof to be simply absolutely general the scripture noting an exception neither cann bee sayde by papists to prove it whose doctrine both alloweth that exception of scrip+ture addeth more thereto
thus one braunch of bellarmins first and principall reason being cutt of the other and the rest of his reasons also are cutt of with the same labour and instrument
for whereas hee sayth certes it were marvell that the apos+tle should never ad the exception of whoredom if it were to be added seing hee repeated and inculcated these things so often
certes wee may say as well of those exceptions which himself approveth that it were marvell the apostle should never add them if they were to bee added
though what marvell is it if paul omitted the excep+tion of whoredom in all those two places which hee hath repea+ted and inculcated these things so often as bellarmin so often telleth vs when the thing is mentioned in the

former of them by way of a

similytude wherein it had bene fond and beside the purpose to speake of any exception and for the

later paul hath omitted the same exception

twise where the

scripture

sheweth and bellarmin confesseth it should have bene added· or to speake more properly where although it needed not to bee added yet must it needs bee vnderstoode
now to that bellarmin doth next alledg the fathers

ambrose chrysostome theophylact theodoret oecumenius primasius anselmus and others over and besides

austin

origen and

ierom all as bearing witnesse that wee expound the places falsly could reply that some of these whatsoever they witnesse have small credit with bellarmin as ambrose specially some namely chrysosto theophylact theodoret oecumenius and primasius doe not witnesse that no more then paul himself doth nay they all save one are contrary minded rather as shall appeare in

due place but that which have sayde already touching austin may serve for answer to the rest chiefly sith the papists in whose behalf they are aleaged will rather yeald that all the fathers might erre the any of their popes

who yet must have erred in more the one canon if this were true which bellarmin fathereth on the fathers
finally concerning that for the vpshoote hee vrgeth pauls similytude as if the

drift of it did absolutely require that the man and wife can not bee made free from the band of ma+riage by any seperatio but by death onely because while the law had life as it were and stoode in force till christ the iewes could ne+ver shake off the yoke thereof from them although they endevored to seperate from it by committing whoredom with sundry lawes of salfe gods the rest of pauls similytudes which mencioned doe bewray the lamenesse and halting of this inference seing that the drift of the requireth absolutely by the same reason that noe man went to warfare at his owne cost or planted vynes or fedd sheepe without relief thereby because

all they

who preach the gospel are allowed to live of the gospel
and likewise that no man did ever hurt his owne body because

every husband ought to loue his owne wife

as christ loved the church and likewise that no souldier hath ever entangled with the assayres of life be+cause tymothee should bee

still about those actions whereto the lord

who choose him to hee a souldier did call him
nay to goe no farther then the drift it self of the samilytude which bel+larmin doth vrge if it requier absolutely that the band of mar+riage may bee no way loosed but onely by the husbands or the

wives death then neither is it loosed if the vnbeleever doe for sake the christian neither if the husba~d become a monke or the wife a nunne neither if the pope see cause to dispence with either of them
and will not this fansie of his about that drift drive him into greater inconvenience yet to weet that every woman whose husband is dead ought to marry another because the iewes were bound to become christia~s after the death of the lawe or of the other side that the iewes are not bound vnder payne of damnation to become christians because no widowe is bound vnder payne of death to take another husband or if these absurdities bee not great enough that dead men ought to marry because

the iewes by duty should bee vnto christ when they were dead to the lawe or that the men of rome to whom paul wrote should rather not beleeve in christ because

he wished widowes rather not to marry of the which consequences if some bee esteemed erroneous by papists some not esteemed onely but are so in deede the most have impious folly ioyned with vntruth let bellarmin acknowledg that simi+litudes must not bee sett vpon the racke nor the drift thereof bee stretched and pressed in such sorte as if they ought iust in length bredth and depth to match and whereto they are resembled
it sufficeth if in a generall analogy and proportion of the principall poynt wherein things are matched and compared together they bee eche like to other and both agree in one qualitie
which here is observed in pauls compariso of the state of marriage with the state of man before and after regeneration because

as a wife her husband being dead doth lawfully take another and is not an adulteresse in having his company to bring forth fruite of her body to him soe

rege+nerate persons their naturall corruption provoked by the law to sinne and flesh being mortified are ioyned to the spirit the force of christ working in them as it were to a second hus+band that they should bring forth fruite the fruites of the spirit vnto god
and thus seing neither the drift of the similytude nor the iudgment of the fathers nor the playnnesse of the wor+des so oftentymes repeated doe disprove our answer and expo+sition of the place our answer proved by scripture standeth firme and sure and therefore the third place vrged by our adver+saries

is sutable to the former

so is the fourth last taken out of the first· to the corithians the seaventh chapter a to them who are married it is not that give commandement but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband but if shee depart too let her remayne vnmarried
or bee recon+ciled vnto her husband
wherein as bellarmin reasoneth the words of paul if shee depart and so forth are meant of a woman which parteth from her husband vpon a cause of iust divocement as namely for whordom haeresie and the rest whatsoever they be not of her which parteth without any such cause
but concerning her of whom the words are meant paul sayth most playnely shee may not marrie another
therefore even a cause of iust divorcement looseth not the band of marriage neither is it lawfull for married folckes to mar+ry others although they beesevered and put asunder by iust divorceme~t

and of this argument bellarmin doth say that it is altogether insoluble
in saying whereof hee seemeth to confesse that none of the former arguments were so but might bee answered and confuted
his confession touching them hath reason with it must needs approve it
but his vaunt of this is like that of

ben hadads that the dust of· samaria would not bee enough to all the people that followed him for every man an handfull
to whom the king of israel sayde let not him that girdeth his harnies boast himself as hee that putteth it off
bellarmin hath skarcly girt his harneis yet that which hee hath girt is vnservisable bad harneis too

for the formost parte thereof his proposition a vouching that the words if shee depart and so forth are meant of her onely which parteth from her husband vpon a iust cause of divocement as namely for whordom heresie and such like is faulty sundry wayes seing they are neither meant of her onely which parteth for a iust cause and though· they bee also meant of her which parteth for any other iust cause yet not of her which for whoredom

moreover the conclusion knitting vpp his argument with therefore even a iust cause of divorcement looseth not the band of mar+riage is guilfully sett downe being vttered in the forme of a par+ticular and true so taking divorcement as hee doth but intended to carry the force of a generall so by fraude and faulshood to beare away the poynt in questio
of both the which to treat in ordre his proposition hee presumeth of as most certayne because

in his iudgment paule would not have sayde of her who departed without some such cause let her remayne vnmarried or bee reconciled vnto her husband but hee would have sayde let her remayne vnmarried till shee bee reconciled vnto her husband let her come agayne vnto her husband in any case
and why doth bellarmin thynke so his reasons follow
for paul could not permitt an vniust divorcemnt agaynst the expresse commandement of the lord

and if in the same chapter paul permitteth not the man and wife to refrayne from carnall company for prayers fake and for a tyme except it bee with consent how should bee permitt the wife to remayne seperated from her husband agaynst his will without any cause of iust divorce+ment
in deede if it had lyen in pauls power to stay refraine the wife from remayning so no doubt hee neither would nor might have permitted it
which himself sufficiently shewed in

forbidding her to depart at all much more to continue parted from her husband
but

if notwithstanding this charge and prohibition she did leave her husband vpon some lighter cause or perhaps weightyer though not weighty enough for a iust di+vorcement then paul in duty ought and might hope with reason requier and exhorte her to remayne vnmarried and not to ioyne her selfe in wedlocke with another a thing that

greekes and

romayns whose the

corinthians were vsed to doe as to make it playner by the like examples paul neither might neither would have allowed a man to bee rashly angry with his brother for

christ forbiddeth it
but if one were suddenly surprised with rashe anger paul would advise him

not to let the sunne goe downe vpon his angry wrath
neither might hee therevpon bee iustly charged with permitting wrath vntill the sunne sett agaynst christs commandement

no more might hee with graunting liberty to lust because he

willeth men not to fulfill the lusts of the flesh whereas

christ com+mandeth them not to lust at all
for paul also

condemneth all lusting of the flesh as sinne
but seing that

the flesh will lust agaynst the spirit as long as wee are in this mortality he sturreth vp the faythfull that they

let not sinne raigne in their mortall bodyes nor doe fulfill the lust of the flesh
in the same sort therefore hee giveth charge with christ that the wife departe not from her husba~d
yet in consideratio of humaine infirmity he addeth

but if shee departe too let her bee vnmarried
and to meete with a doubt which herevpon might rise sith in the next words before hee had affirmed that they who haue not the gift of continence should marry and what if shee have it not hee adioyneth farther

or let her be reconciled vnto her husband
so that although the words may seeme to bee vttered in the same sorte as if they did imply and import a permission yet are they not permissive but imperative in truth and an expresse precept that the wife having forsaken her husband therein done evill

forbeare to marry another for that were farre worse yea though shee can not containe in respect where of or of any thing els if shee mislike to live vnmarried shee may not vse the libertye that single folke may who rather ought to marrie then burne but shee

must reconcile her self vnto her husband whose wife shee is by duty still
and may say likewise doubtles vnto bellarmin that hee and his pamphletter should not have mayntained their error in writing but sith they have done it let the write no more in defence of it or let them acknowledg that in this poynt they were deceived
for whereas

they gather of the disjunctive par+ticle let hor remayne vnmarried or bee reconciled that paul hath put it in the womans choyse left her at liberty either to live seperated still from her husband or to be reconciled vnto him they might as well ground vpon christs words to the angell of the church of the laodiceans

would thou werest colde or

hot that hee hath put it in our choise and left vs at libertie either to bee colde in faith and love as flesh is or to bee fervent in the spirit
yet christ had no such meaning
for he commaundeth vs to bee

servent and that verie angell hee saith to everie faith full men

be hot zealous
but because the partie was luke warme a wordling

who had receyved the seede of the word but bare not fruite who

knew his maisters will but did it not there by sinned most grievously christ wisheth that he were colde and sinned lesse sith hee did sinne or that hee were hot and free from both these faults the later wishe made simply the former in comparison
after the which manner seing paul might well did by all likelyhood of circumsta~ces of the text wishe simply and chiefly that the wife estranged were reconciled to her husband next that shee continued rather parted from him then

married to another as a lesse evill in comparison the vttering of his sente~ce with a disjunctive particle let her remayne vnmar+ried or bee reconciled doth not prove hee put it in the womans choyse and left her at liberty to doe whether shee listed
and thus it appeareth how certaine and vndoubted that principle is which

vpon this proofe bellarmin avoucheth to bee most certaine vndoubted that pauls words touching the wife if shee depart are ment of her onely which parteth from her husband vpon a iust cause of divorcement
howbeit if they had bene meant of her onely yet must they have touched such wives as leave their husbands for any other just cause not for whoredom an other and greater oversight of bellarmin that in exemplising the causes of divorcement to which in his opinion the words should bee restrayned hee nameth whoredom first as prncipally comprised in pauls precept whereas paule meant that it and it alone should bee excluded and excepted

for these are his words

to them who are married it is not that geve commandement but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband but if shee departe too let her remaine vnmarried or bee re+conciled vnto her husband and let not the husband put away his wife

where in the last braunch let not the husband put away his wife must needes bee vnderstood except it bee for whoredom because paule saith it is the lords commandement and

the lord gave it with that expresse exception
this bellarmyn doth graunt
well
then as the last braunche so the first too let not the wife depart from her husband
for the analogie is all one and yeche having interest in the others bodie shee may as lawfully depart

from an adulterer as hee from an adulteresse
and this doth bellarmin graunt also
but the middle braunche is to be vnderstood of the same departing and likewise qualified as the first
therefore
if shee depart too is meant except it be for whoredome
nay not so quoth bellarmin for the same departing is not meant in both but a farre different in the first an uniust departing in the next a just and this must be the sense of the apostles wordes
not but the lord geve commandement let not the wife depart from her husba~d to weet without a just cause but if shee goe away to weet having a just cause let her remaine vnmarried so forth
in the refutation of which wrong violence done vnto the sacred text what

should stand whe the onely reason whereby out of scripture hee assayeth to prove it is the disiunctive particle which as have shewed alreadie hath no ioynt or sinew of proofe to that effect
and

the onely father whose testimony hee citeth for it doth ground it on that disiunctive particle of scripture so that his reason being his and authoritie by

his owne

approved rule may beare no sway
and on the contrarie parte

many other fathers doe expound the second braunche as having refere~ce to the same departing that is forbidden in the first
and which is the chief point the naturall drift and meaning of paules words doth enforce the same
for the tearmes

but if too importe that doing also of that which in the sentence before he had affirmed ought not to be done as

the like examples in the same discourse to go no farder shewe yea some having one

particle lesse then this hath to it therevnto
it is good for the vnmarried and widowes if they abide even as doe

but if they doe not conteine let them marry
the woman which hath an vnbeleeving husband and hee consenteth to dwell with her let her not put him away

but if the vnbeleeving depart let him depart
art thou loosed from a wife seeke not a wife

but thou marrie also thou sinnest not this speake for your profitt that you may doe that which is comely

but if anie man thinke it vncomely for his virgin if shee passe the time of marriage let him doe what he will
the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth

but if her husband be dead she is at libertie and so forth
in all the which sentences sith the clauses brought in with those coniunctio~s have manifest relation to the things spoken of before and the in the same sense the braunche that is in questio having like dependance must in all reason be conserved of the same departing that the former
thus it being proved that paul commanding the wife to remanie vnmarried if shee departed from her husba~d did meane
except it were for whoredom it followeth that bellarmins proposition is faultie even in this also that he nameth whoredom among the iust causes of the wives departing here meant by paul
now in his conclusion inferring herevpon that even a iust cause of divorcement looseth not the band of marriage hee is as deceitfull· as he was false in his proposition
for the word divorcement being vnderstoode as it is

by him for anie seperation and parting of the man and wife though from bedd onely for a certaine time there may be sundry causes why such a seperation should be allowed or tollerated whe as the band of marriage shall neverthelesse endure still
and so the simple reader were likely to imagine that bellarmin had co~cluded a truth to purpose
but the point where with he should have knitt vp his dispute and he would have men conceyve beare away as if these words implyed it is that no iust cause at all of any divorcement doth loose the band of marriage and therefore neither whoredo
the falsehood whereof would have bene as cleare as the sunne shine at nooneday the proposi+tion being so evidently false whereon it is inferred
and this is the argument that bellarmin set his rest on

the insoluble argume~t eve altogether insoluble the ground whereof hee tearmeth

a demonstratio a most invincible demonstratio against the which nothing he saith can be obiected but an insufficie~t reply made by to weet that paul speaketh of a

adulterous wife who therefore being cast out by her husband is charged to stay vnmarried the innocent partie not so charged
which speeches of the iesuite come fro the like veine of a vaunting spirit as those did of his complices who boasted that

the spanyards armadoes navy should finde but weake seely resistance in england and called their army sent to conquere vs an invincible army
for as they diminished by vntrue reportes the forces prepared to meete encou~ter with the spanish power so bellarmin by saying that nought can be obiected beside that hee specifieth yea farder by belying and falsifying of erasmus

who contrariwise replieth that paul doth seeme to speake

of lighter displeasures for which divorcements then were vsuall not of such crimes as adulterie
moreover by the substance weight of my replie to his insoluble argument the godly wise indifferent eye will see trust that the knots strings thereof are loosed and broken even as the invincible armie of the spanyards was by gods providence shewed to be vincible without great encountring the carkeises spoiles of their shipps me vp o~the english scottish irish coasts did witnesse it.f so let all thine enemies perish lord and let them who love him be as the sunne when he goeth forth in his strength

the third chapter

the consent of fathers the seconde pretended proofe for the papists doctrine in this point is pretended falsly and if all be weighted in an even ballance the fathers check it rather

after the foresaid testimonies of scripture vrged by our adversaries in the first place for the commending of their errour secondly the same truth saith the iesuit may be proved by tradition
by which his owne speeche if we should take advauntage of it he graunteth all that have said agaynst his arguments drawen out of the scripture and so farre forth agreeth with vs
for what vnderstandeth hee by the word tradition a doctrine not written as

professeth in his first controversie
where having noted that al though the word tradition be generall signifieth any doctrine written or vnwritten which one imparteth to another yet divines almost all the auncient fathers applie it to signifie vnwritten doctrine onely and soe will wee hereafter vse this word saith hee
if the point in question the may be proved as bellarmin affirmeth it may by tradition we might conclude it is not written in the scriptures by his owne verdict and therefore all the scriptures alleaged by him for it are alleaged falsly
but hee seemeth to vse the name of traditio in like sort as

vincentius lirmensis doth calling the doctrine de+livered by the church the churches tradition
this to be his meaning gather by the reason that hee addeth saying for there are extant the testimonies of the fathers in all ages for it
the pa~phletter in other words but more pere~ptorily to avouch the proofe thereof by the opinion and censure of all ages affirmeth he will shewe that it was never thought lawfull since christ for christians divorced for fornication to marry anie other while both man and wife lived
that it was never thought lawfull since christ is a boulder speeche them bellarmin doth vse though to hitt the marke as it were with his shaft hee must and doth imply as much in that

hee saith it may be proved by tradition
for traditio hath not force enough to prove a thing to be true not in the papists owne iudgment vnles it have bene alwaies approved agreed on by the generall consent of fathers as we tearme them pastors and doctors of the church
which affirme not vpon the generall rule of

vincentius onelie so greatly and so often praised by them as golden but vpon the canon of the trent councell and pillars of the popi~sh churche subscribing to it
for the

councell of trent commanding that no man shall expound the scripture against the sense that the churche holdeth or against the fathers co~senting all in one doth covertly grau~t that if the fathers consent not all in one their opinion may be false and no sure proofe of a point in question

andradius doth open and avouche the same in his defense of the councell a worke verie highly comme~ded by

oseruis
and

canus setteth it downe for a conclusion that many of them consenting in one can yeild no firme proofe if the rest though fewer in number do dissent
yea

bellarmin himself saith that there can no certaintie be gathered out of their sayings when they agree not among themselves
it is a thing graunted the by our adversaries that the fathers have not strength enough to prove ought vnlesse they all consent in one
but the fathers do not all consent in one about the point wee treat of as it shalbe shewed our adversaries therefore must graunt that the opinio which they holde in this point cannot be proved by fathers
nay they are in danger of being enforced to graunt a farther matter and more importing them by the consequent hereof
for through a decree of

pope pius the fourth the professors of all faculties all that take degrees in any poopish schoole are bound by solemne oth that they shall never expound and take the scripture

but according to the fathers co~se~ting all in one
wherefore how will bellarmin perhaps the pamphletter also if he have bene amongst them and taken any degree but what shift will bellarmin and his

puefellowes finde to save themselves from periurie when it shal be shewed that many of the fathers gaine say that opinion which and his expound the scripture for and what if it appeare that the greater number of fathers doe so nor the greater onely but the better also

and those whose grounds are surer then all the probability which fathers can yeild will turne against the papists and that which our adversaries would prove by tradition and the consent of all ages will rather be disproved thereby
but howsoever men be diversly persuaded touching the number qua+lity of fathers enclyning this or that way by meanes of sundrie circumstances which may breed doubt both particularly of certaine and of the whole summe in generall the maine and principall point remayning to be shewed namely that the fathers consent not all in one for the papists doctrine is most cleare and evident out of all controversie
in so much that many even of them also whom bellarmin alleageth and the pamphletter after him as making for it make in deed against it and those of the chiefest and formost rankes spetially in the first the second the third the fourth hundred yeares after christ
all the which agree and teach with one consent that the man forsaking his wife for her adulterie is free to marrie againe save such of them onely as in this very point of doctrine touching marriage are tainted with error by the iudgement and censure of papists themselves
a token of the vanetie and folly of our adversaries bellarmin and the pamphletter who by naming one at least in everie age would needes make a shewe of having the consent of all ages with them whereas it wilbe seene hereby that in many we have the most and best and they either none at all or none sound
for in the first hundred yeares after christ all that bellarmin sayth they have is the testimony of clemens in the cano~s of the apostles

where the ma is willed without any exception to be excommunicated who having put away his wife doth marrie another
now beside that clemens vpon whom bellarmin fathereth those canons is iniured therein
as for the later parte of them

himself sheweth

his friend for the former neither are they of apostolique antiquitie and authoritie notwithstanding their title as

many fathers testifie and papists will acknowledg when they are touched by them

the author of the canon had respect therein by all probabilitie to the apostolique doctrine receyved from christ therefore though he made not an expresse exceptio of divorce for whordom might as well impply it as have declared that some of

the euangelists and paule did
which the interpreters also of those canons

zonaras and balsamon thought to be so likely and more then a coniecture that they expound it so without any scruple
balsamon in saying that he who putteth away his wife without cause may not marrie another and zonaras that hee who marrieth a woman put away without cause by her husband doth committ adulterie
or if these writers mistooke the authours meaning in his opinion no ma howsoever his wife were put away without or with cause might lawfully marrie another take this with all that

hee skarse allowed any second marriage but controuled the third as a signe of intemperance condemned flatly the fourth as manifest whoredom
which although

a iesuit goe about to cover and salve with gentle gloses like

the false prophets
who when one had built up a mudden wall did parged it with vnsavorie plaister yet sith that counterfait clements worke did flowe out of the fountaines of the gretians as a

great historian of rome hath truelie noted and amo~g the gretians many held that errour as it is likewise shewed by a

great sorbonist the likelyhood of the matter and spring whence it proceedeth agreeing so fitly with the naturall and proper signification of the words will not permitt their blacknes to take any other hewe nor suffer that profane speech of know not what clement to be cleared from plaine contradiction to

the word of god
wherefore the onely witnesse that bellarmin produceth out of the first hundred yeares doth not helpe him

out of the second hundred he produceth three iustinus athenagoras and clemens alexandrinus
the first of whom iustinus praising the compendious briefnes of christes speeches rehearseth this amongst them whoso marrieth her that is divorced from her husband doth commit adulterie
meaning not as bellarmin but as christ did who excepting whoredome in the

former braunche of that sentence vnderstoode it likewise in this as have shewed
and how may wee know that iustinus meant so by his owne wordes in that

hee commendeth a godly christian woman who gave to her adulterous husband a bill of dirorcement

such as did loose that band of matrimony and saith concerning him that

hee was not her husband afterward
the next

athenagoras affirmeth graunt that if

any man being parted from his former wife doe marrie another he is an adulterer
but bellarmin must graunt with all that athenagoras affirmeth it vntruly considering that hee speaketh of parting even by death too as well as by divorcement with the

montanists that whatsoever second marriage is vnlawfull
wherevpon a famons parisian divine

claudius espenseus saith of this same sentence of his which bellarmin citeth that it favoureth rather of a philosopher then a christian and may well be thought to have bene inserted into his worke by eucratites
a censure for the ground thereof very true that the said opinion is a philosophicall fansie yea an heresie though the wordes seeme rather to be athenagonas his owne as

sundrie fathers speake dangerously that way then thrust in by encratites

who generally reiected all marriage not marriage onelie
athenagoras therefore worketh small credit to the iesuits cause
as much doth the last of his witnesses

clemens alexandrinus
for both in this point about second marriage

hee matcheth aethenagoras and otherwise his writings are tainted with vnsoundenes and stained with spotts of errour
which iudgme~t not onely

protestants of germaine have in our remembrance lately geven of him though a

iesuitical spirit doe traduce the insolently for it but

an auncient pope of rome with seave~tie byshops assembled in a councell above a thowsand yeares since and a byshop of spaine a man of no small reputation with papists for skill both in divinitie and in the canon law

didacus covarruvias doth approve the same
now in the third hundred yeares to goe forward tertullian and origen are brought forth to averre bellarmins opinion of whom one questionlesse controlleth perhaps both
for

tertullian disputing against the heretique marcion who falsely obiected that christ is contrarie to moses because moses graunted divorceme~t christ forbiddeth it answereth that christ saying whosoever shall put away his wife marrie another committeth adulterie meaneth

vndoubtedly of putting away for that cause for which it is not lawfull for a man to putt away his wife that hee may marrie another
and likewise for the wife that he is an adulterer who marrieth her being put away

if shee be put away vnlawfully considering that the marriage which is not rightly broken off continueth and

while the marriage doth continue it is adulterie to marrie
which words of tertullian manyfestly declaring that a man divorced from his wife lawfully for the cause excepted by christ may marrie another bellarmin doth very cunningly finely cut of with an et caetera and saith that there he teacheth that christ did not forbid divorcement if there be a iust cause but did forbid to marrie againe after divorcement
so directly agaisnt the most evide~t light of the wordes tenour of the whole discourse that learned men of his owne side though houlding his opinion yet could not for shame but graunt that tertullian maketh against them in it
for

byshop covarruvias mentioning the fathers who maintaine that men may lawfully marrie againe after divorceme~t for adulterie nameth tertullian quoting this place amo~g them
and

sixtus senensis a man not inferiour in learning to bellarmin in sincere dealing for this point superiour co~fesseth on the same place on those same words but recited wholy not clipped with an etcetera that tertullian maketh a certaine vndoubted assertion thereof

pamelius in deede through a desire of propping vp his churches doctrine with tertullia~s credit saith that though hee seeme here to allowe divorcement for adulterie in such sort as that the husba~d may marrie another wife yet hee openeth himself holdeth it to be vnlawfull in his booke

of single marriage
he saith some what but litle to his advauntage
for tertullian wrote this booke of single marriage

whe hee was falle away from the catholique faith vnto the heresie of montanus so doth holde therein agreably to that heresie that is vnlawfull to marrie a second wife howsoever a man be parted from the former by divorcement or by death
but in that thee wrote while hee was a catholique against the heretique marcion hee teacheth co~trarywise the same that wee doe as sixtus senensis and covarruvias truely graunt
yea pamelius himself if hee looke better to his owne notes doth graunt as much
for

he saith that tertullian vseth the worde divorcement in his proper signification for such a divorcement by which one putteth away his wife marrieth another
but tertullia saith

that christ doth avouche the righteousnes of divorcement
christ therefore avoucheth that for adulterie a man may put away his wife and marrie another by tertullians iudgment
which also may be probably thought concerning origen although

it be true

hee saith as bellarmin citeth him that certaeine byshops did permitt a woman to marrie while her former husband lived addeth they did it agaynst the scripture
for he seemeth to speake of a woman divorced from her husband not for adulterie but for some other cause such as the iewes vsed to put away their wives for bygiving the a bill of divorceme~t
the matter that he handleth and cause that he geveth thereof doe lead vs to this meaning approved by the opinion of certaine learned men too
for after he had said according to

the words of christ which he expoundeth that moses in permitting a bill of divorceme~t did yeeld vnto the weakenes of the to whom the law was geve he saith that the christian byshops who permitted a woma to marrie while her former husba~d lived did it perhaps for such weaknes
wherefore sith in saving that this which they did they did perhaps for such weaknes he hath relatio vnto that of moses moses as he addeth did not grau~t the bill of divorceme~t for adulterie for that was punished by death it followeth that the byshops who origen chargeth with doing against the scripture did permitt the woma to marrie vpon divorceme~t for some other cause not for adulterie so his reproving of the doth not touche vs who grau~t it for adulterie only
thus doth

erasmus thinke that origen meant concluding it farther as cleare by the similitude which

he had vsed before of christ who put away the synagogue his former wife as it were because of her adulterie married the churche
yea

tapper likewise a great divine of lova of better credit with papists the saith that the divorceme~t permitted by those byshops who origen co~trouleth was a iewish divorceme~t
wherein though he aymed at another marke to prove an vntruth yet vnwares he a truth more the hee thought of strengthened that by origen which he thought to overthrowe
howbeit if bellarmin or bellarmins interpreter ca persuade by other likelyhoods out of origen as he is somewhat darke know not whether irresolute in the point that the thing reproved by him in those byshops was the permitting of one to marrie againe after divorcement for adul+terie our cause shalbe more adva~taged by those sundrie byshops who approved it the disadva~taged by one orige who reproved the for it
chiefly seing orige impaired much his credit both by other heresies in diverse points of faith for a

generall councell with

bellarmins allowa~ce count a damned heretique

in this matter by

excluding all such as are twise married out of the kingdo of heave which

divines of paris observe check him for
whereas those byshops of who he maketh mentio were neither stayned otherwise for ought that may be gathered nor herein did they more then the right believing catholique churche all that time thought lawfull to be done as appeareth by tertullia iustine the martyr
in the which respect

peter soto a freir of great account in the trent councell said that it is plaine by many arguments that the case which we treat of was doubtfull in the auncient church this for proofe thereof out of origen that many byshops married me to marrie againe after divorcement
this if the two of who bellarmin alleageth out of the third hundred years as making for him doe not make against him which per+haps they doe both yet one of the doth not out of all controversie byshops more in number in credit greater the the other agree with him therein
out of the fowrth hundred the which bellarmin maketh is a great deale fayrer the out of the third a number of fathers the councell of eliberis am lero a roma byshop chrysostome are affirmed to ioyne themselves with him
but they are affirmed in the like ma~ner as the former were skarse on of the avouching the same that he doth the rest in part seeming to be of other opinion in part most clearely shewing it such as shewe not so much yet shewing their owne weakenes that in this matter their opinio iudgme~t is of small value
for the formost of them

the councel of eliberis ordained that a woma which forsooke her husband because of his adulterie would marrie another should be forbidden to marrie if shee married shee should not receave the communion till hee were dead who shee forsooke vnlesse necessitie of sicknes co~strayned to geve it her
wherein it is to be noted first that the councell saith not

if anieman so to comprehend touche generallie all both men women but they speake peculiaritie of the woman alone so doe not forbid the ma to leave his adulterous wife marrie another
secondly that the woma is excommunicated if when shee is forbidden by the church to marrie shee marrie neverthelesse not if before shee be forbidden as it were to punish her disobedience rather then the fact it self
thirdlie that is not all her life time from the

communion but for a season onely and in time of neede in daungerous sicknes doth receive it yea even while the partie who shee forsooke liveth
of the which circumstances the first though it might argue the councells oversight who made the womans case herein worse then the mans both being free alike by gods lawe yet for the ma it sheweth that they allowed him to marrie againe after divorcement according to the doctrine of christ which wee maintaine
the next yeildeth likeliehood that the councell did forbid the woman this not for that they thought it vnlawfull but vnseemelie perhaps or vnexpedient as

another councell is read to have forbidde the celebrating solemnizing of marriages at certaine times
but the last putteth the matter out of doubt that they were persuaded of the woman also marrying in such sort that her fact was warra~table by the word of god
forels had they not iudged her marriage with this latter ma to be lawfull they must needes have iudged her to live with him in perpetuall adulterie
which if they had thought it is most improbable they would have admitted her to the communio in case of daungerous sicknes seeing at the point of death

they denie it to wome so continuing yea

to men offending lesse heynously then so
with such extremitie of rigour therein that

baronius noteth their decrees as savouring of the novatian heresie

bellarmin layeth it almost as deepely to their charge
so farre from all likeliehood is it that they would admitt her in necessitie of sicknes to the communio had they bene persuaded shee lived in adulterie still
therefore it was not without cause that bellarmin did suppresse this circu~stance together with the former in citing the decree of the elibernie councell least his false illatio to weete that they accounted such marriage vnlawfull even for the innocent partie in the cause of adulterie should be discovered controlled thereby
next is ambrose brought in who vpo the chapter of luke writeth much against the that putting away their wife doe marrie another he calleth that marriage adulterie in sundrie places nei+ther doth he ever except the cause of whoredom in that whole discourse as bellarmin saith
but what if bellarmin here be like himself too certainely ambrose speaketh

of such wives as lived without crime

whom their husbands were as hee addeth

forbidden by the lawe of god to put away
so that hee reproving men for marrying others after they had put away their chaste wives doth evidently shewe he meant not of marriage after divorceme~t for whordo
and if it be proofe that hee supposed they might not marrie againe after they had put away a whorish wife because hee never excepteth whoredo in that whole discourse of marrying againe then by as sufficie~t a reason hee supposed that

they might not put away their wives at all no not for whordom because hee never excepteth it in that whole discourse of putting away the wife
but papists will graunt that a man may lawfully put away his wife if shee committ whordom
as bellarmin then will construe ambrose in this braunch so let him in the former
and if he say that ambrose thinking vpo luke alone who hee expounded or trusting his memorie forgot the exception added by christ in mathew for

putting away the wife the same slipp of memorie might loose the same exception for

marrying another
if he thinke that ambrose did not forget himself but vnderstoode the exception in the former point as the

apostle did though neither mentio it expressely what reason why it might not as well be vnderstoode in the later also as for ierom no marveil if hee wrote against second marriage after divorceme~t for whordom

who wrote against all second marriages in such sort that

espe~ceus asketh what could have bene said more greivously against them by the impure

catharists then is said by him and

vives pronounceth that hee did not onely detest second marriages but also had small liking of the first nor did much favor matrimonie beside that himself too as farre as hee exceeded the boundes of godly modestie truth herein even by these mens iudgments who papists doe repute learned catholique allayeth corecteth in one of the places which bellarmin alleageth his peremptorie censure geve in the other
for whereas hee saith in his epistle to amandus that the wife who divorced herself from her husband because of his adulterie another

was an adulteresse for so marrying and

her newe husba~nd an adulterer in his epitaph of fabiola a noble godly gentlewoman of rome who did the like was poenitent for it after her second husbands death hee saith that shee

lamented bewayled it so as if shee had co~mitted adulterie
by which kinde of speech others sutable to it as that he temeth her state after divorcement fro her first husband widdowhood addeth that shee lost

the honor of having had but one husba~d by marrying the second

saith shee thought it better to vndergoe a certaine shadow of pitifull wedlocke

then to plaie the whore because it is better saith paul to marrie then to burne ieron de+clareth that although it were a fault in his opinion to doe as shee did yet not such a fault a crime a publique crime as bellarmins doctrine maketh it
no more may it be iustly thought in the opinio of that roma byshop of who because he put fa+biola to publique penance after her second husband death bellarmin co~cludeth that it was accounted a publique crime in the catholique church at that time if any man whilst his wife yet lived married another yea albeit for whordo
for men at that time were put to some penance in the catholique church for marrying againe after their first wives death as bellarmin observeth out of the adding therewith al that although they knewe seco~d marriage to be lawfull yet because it is a token of incontine~cie they chastised it with some pena~ce
wherefore sith it might easilie bee that they who laid some penance vpon no fault would lay publique penance vpo a small fault spetially in women to who in such cases they were more severe rigorous the to me the penance which the bishop did put fabiola to for her seco~d marriage doth not prove sufficie~tly that it was accounted the a publique crime in the catholique church
howbeit if the tearme of publique crime be vsed in a ge~tler sense the

co~monly it is or the byshop of rome did never put any but grievous offenders finners to publique penance yet perhaps even so too will bellarmin come short of his conclusio still
for thereby saith hee we doe not vndersta~d that if any ma while his wife yet lived married another yea albeit for whordo it was accounted a publique crime in the catholique church at that time if any ma did it
as who say the byshop of rome must needs hould that if women were not licensed to marrie after divorcement for whordom men could not be nei+ther
whereas he might be of the same opinio that an auncie~t

councell as shewed to have bene before him and

an auncient

father living writing as

some thinke in rome about the same time was meane that this libertie freedom should be graunted to men but not to women
moreover the delay of faebiolas penance in that she was not put thereto vntill

after her second husbands death yeildeth very strong probable coniecture that it had not bene before the accou~ted any crime at all in the catholique church not for a woman neither to put away her husba~d because of his adulterie to marrie another
for that which fabiola did shee did

openly
her self was religious godly well instructed thought it to be lawfull
her husba~d by all likelyhood of like minde iudgme~t the church of rome called not their marriage in to question the byshop did not execute any church censure on them
nay sith shee was

very yong when they married and never heard of anie fault therein committed as long as her husband lived it may be rome had many byshops in the meane time none of who saw cause why they should blame her for it
the example of fabiola therefore the roman byshops dealing in it maketh more a great deale with vs then against vs if it be throughly weighed
now chrysostom maketh absolutely with vs howsoever bellarmin affirmeth that hee teacheth the same with ierom yea with

ierom simplie condemning all such marriage
for what doth chrysostom teach in the

sermon that bellarmin quoteth vpon mathew forsooth that by moses lawe it was permitted that whosoever hated his wife for any cause might put her away and marry another in her roome but christ left the husband one cause alone to put away his wife for namely whoredome
what and doth it follow hereof that chrysostom meant that the husband putting her away for whoredome might not marrie another rather the cleane contrary seing that he speaketh of such a putting away as moses did permitt and maketh this the difference betwene christs ordinance and the law of moses that moses did permitt it for anie cause christ but for one
which to be his meaning hee sheweth more plainely

vpon the first to the corinthians saying that the marriage is dissolved by whoredom neither is the husband a husband anie longer
for hence it appeareth that hee thought the ba~d of marriage to bee loosed whe they

are severed for whoredom therefore consequently the parties free to marrie according to the

apostles rule
and

other where also though somewhat more obscurely yet conference with this place will shewe him to have taught
but what should stand on farther proofe thereof it being so vndoubted that

byshop covarrisvias an earnest adversarie of marriage after divorcement and bringing all the fathers that hee can against it confesseth chrysoctom to stand on the other side against him for it
and this in foure hundred yeares after christ bellarmin cannot finde one of the fathers that hee may iustly say is his excepting them which make as much for the encratites montanists and catharists as they doe for papists
in the ages following hee findeth better store now one now moe in eche hundred
yet among them also looke how manie hee nameth of the easterne byshops whether expressedly or implyedly hee playeth the iesuit with him
for the first of them theophylact hee alleageth with the same faith truth that he did chrysostom whose schollar theophylact being after

bellarmins owne note did follow his maister
and this the two places the~selves that bellarmin quoteth doe insinuate clearely

the former by opening how christ permitteth not that putting away which moses did without iust cause nor alloweth any cause as iust but whordom

the later by omitting mention of whordo in spesifying the causes for which if a woma depart fro her husba~d shee must remaine vnmarried
whereto if bellarmin neede more light to see it by we may adde a third place in which

theophylact saying that luke rehersing christes words against men putting away their wives marrying other must be vnderstood with the exception out of matthew

vnless it be for whoredom doth shew howfarre he differeth herein from bellarmin who denyeth flatly that christes wordes in luke must be supplyed with that exception
the rest of the easterne fathers whose testimony is alleaged by bellarmin though their names not me~tioned are such as were assembled in the councell of florence
for there came thither to conferre with the pope the westerne byshops albeit many of these houlding a generall councell at basil the same time refused to chaunge the place for the popes pleasure who sought his owne advantage therein not the churches and vndermined the actions

of the councell of basil

which condemned him of heresie and deposed him but there came thither

the patriarches of constantinople alexandria antioche and ierusalem either themselves in person or by their deputies with many metropolitanes and byshops of greece of asia of iberia and other countries of the east
whose creditt and consent how vntruely bellarmin prete~deth for the proofe of his false assertion it is plaine by that hee saith the councell of flore~ce did decree the same in the instruction of the armenians
a chapter which is fathered in deed vpo the councell by the schisimaticall pope eugenius the fovorth the deviser of it but fathered vniustly and calmuniously as the time argueth wherein it was begotte
for it is recorded in the same decree that it was made the

two and twentieth of november in the yeare of christ a thousand foure hundred thirtie nine
now the councell ended in iuly the same yeare foure moneths before as both

it self witnesseth

popish stories
wherefore the councell could not be the father of that decree and chapter no more then a man can be of that childe is borne fourete moneths after his death
and the pope whose bastard in truth the brat is by the acknowlegment and record of papists themselves in the

tomes of councells was so much the more to blame to father it vpon the councell of florence

the great generall councell and

date it in a publique solemne session thereof because neither was it debated in the councell whether marriage after divorcement for adulterie were lawfull or no and the

easterne byshops mainteyned it to be lawfull when the pope after the end of the councell did reprove them for it neither is it likely the contrarie was decreed by all there present of the west
chiefly seing that more the half of them were gone when both partes the east west subscribed to the decrees of the councell in the letters of agreement as appeareth by conferring

their number with

their names the note thereof
yea the councell being ended the sixth of iulie had their subscriptions added vnto it the one twentith
then if of seve score or perhaps vpward scarse threescore were remayning at florence foureteene dayes after the councell ended what may we thinke there were above foure moneths after but how many soever were present of the west as the

pope can quickly muster an hundred byshops or more if neede be out of italie alone

to carry away things in councell by multitude of voices such pollicie hath he vsed for that but how many soever italians he banded to countenance his decree the byshops of the east agreed not thereto neither was it the councells act
thus all the fathers of the eastern churches whom bellarmin alleadgeth and may vrge with creditt their doctrine touching marriage doe not onely not say with him but gainsay him
wherein their have so many others followe them from age to age till our time that it is apparant they allowe with greater consent a ma~s marriage after divorcement for adulterie then fathers of the western churches disallow it
for

eusebius treating of iustine the martyr setteth forth with the same praise that hee had done the storie of the christian woman who divorced her self fro her adulterous husband
and

basils canons approved by

generall councels doe not onely authorize the ma to marrie another whose wife is an adulteresse but also check the custome which yeelded not like favour in like case to the woman
and

epiphanius saith his words are read corruptly but the sense is plaine of our side as

covarruvias graunteth epiphanius therefore saith that seperatio being made for whoredo a ma may take a seco~d wife or a woman a second husband
and the same avoucheth

theodoret in effect affirming that christ hath sett downe one cause whereby the band of marriage should be dissolved and wholy rent a sunder in that hee did except whordom
and a

generall councell wherein there were above two hundred and twentie byshops of the east gathered together doth imply as much in saying that hee who his wife having kept the lawe of wedlocke and being faithfull to him yet forsaketh her and marrieth another is by christs sentence guiltie of adulterie
so doth

oecumenius in applying the precept of abiding vnmarried to such as should not have departed and in abridging chrysosto~s words after his manner whose scholar

bellarmin therefore tearmeth him
so doth

euthymius chrysostoms schollar too in that ma with adulterie who marrieth a woman divorced for any cause but whordo from her husba~d
so doth nicephoras in copying co~mending that out of eusebius which he had out of iustin the martyr
to be short the grecians

which nam

compriseth many nations of the east all who the

florentine councell calleth the eastern church doe

put the same doctrine receyved from their auncestours in prac+tise even at this day allowing married folke not onely to sperate divorce the~selves in case of adulterie but also to marrie others as bellarmin confesseth
wherefore his opinio hath not the consent of the eastern byshops neither hath had it any age since christ
much lesse can he shewe the consent of the south

the aethiopians abessines or of the

moscovites russes in the north both which as they receyved their faith fro the east so vse they like freedome libertie for this matter
no not in the west it self though he have many the~ce agreeing with him yet hath hee the generall co~sent of all the fathers perhaps not of half if an exact count might be taken of them
for besides tertullian the councell of eliberis and to let passe ambrose one byshop of rome or more alreadie shewed to have thought that a man being divorced from his wife for her adulterie is free to marrie againe there are of the same minde

but the papists aunswer doe graunt that sundrie of them were and such as they graunt not the light of truth reason will either make them graunt or shame them for denying it
as

sixtus senensis namely doth deny that hilarie and chromantius allowe a man to marrie

another wife after divorcement or teach that hee is loosed from the band of matrimonie while his former wife though an adulteresse liveth
now weigh their owne wordes it will appeare that sixtus iniurieth them therein
for

chromatius saith that they who having putt away their wives

for any cause save for presume to marrie others doe against the will of god and are condemned
wherein with what sense could hee except whoredom vnlesse he thought them guiltlesse who having put away their wives for it doe marrie others and

hilarie affirming christ to have prescribed no other cause

of ceasing from matrimony but that she weth that the band of matrimony is loosed thereby in his iudgme~t
chiefly sith he knew that they might cease from the vse thereof for other causes the occasion and tenour of the speech doe argue that he meant of such a seperation as yeeldeth libertie of newe marriage
in like sorte or rather more plainely and expressely did pollentius holde and maintaine the same as austin whom in this point hee dissented from doth reporte and testifie
yet bellarmin a strange thing in a case so cleare but nothing strange to iesuits saith that pollentius

did not gainsaie austin but asked his iudgment of the matter and for proofe hereof referreth vs to the beginnings of both the bookes of austin
even

to those beginnings in which it is declared how austin having laboured to prove that a woman parted from her husband for his fornication might not marry another pollentius wrote vnto him

as it were by way of asking his iudgment and shewed hee thought the contrarie yet shewed it in such sorte that austin setting downe both their opinions doth specifie then as flatly crossing one the other you are of this mynde of that and saith of pollentius againe and againe that

hee was of this mynde which bellarmin denieth hee was of
wherein the iesuits dealing is more shamefull for that beside the evidence of the thing it self so often repeated in the verie same places that hee citeth

sixtus senenses a man as vnwilling as bellarmin to weaken anie of their trent points with graunting more then hee must needes confesseth that pollentius thought hereof as we doe belike because sixtus senensis honoreth him with the praise and title of a

most godlie man bellarmin thought it better to lie then

to graunt that they have such an adversarie
hee would faine avoid too another auncient father bearing the name of ambrose

ambrose might his name be though hee were not famous ambrose byshop of milan
but whether hee were named so or otherwise which

perhaps is truer vnto his testimonie pronouncing it lawfull by paules doctrine for a man iustly divorced to marrie againe though not for a woman as hee by missetaking paul through errour

though bellarmin replieth with a threefold answere
first

gratian saith hee and peter

lombard doe affirme that those wordes were thrust into this authours commentarie by some corrupters of writings
in+deede the one of them affirmeth

it is said so the other

it is thought so
but if it be sufficient to affirme barely without anie ground of proofe or probabilitie that it is said or thought so what errour so absurd that may not be defended by perverse wranglers what cause so vniust that vnrighteous iudges may not geve sentence with for whatsoever wordes be enforced against them out of the law of god or man out of anie evide~ce or record of writers witnesses worthie credit they may with peter lombard and gratian replie that the place alleaged is said or thought to have bene thrust into those monume~ts by some corrupters of writi~gs
and in replying thus they should speake truelie though it were said or thought by none beside themselves but how reasonably they should speake therein let men of sense reason iudge
surelie though peter lombard rest vpo that aunswer for want of a better yet gratian whether fearing the sicklie state thereof doth leave it seeketh himself a new patron saying that ambrose words are thus meant that a man may lawfullie marrie another wife after the death of the adulteresse but not while shee liveth which aunswer is more absurd then the former
in so much that

covarruvias speaking of the former onelie as vncertaine saith that this repugneth manifestlie to ambrose
a verie true verdict as man not blind may see by ambrose wordes and bellarmin confesseth the same in effect by passing it over insilence as ashamed of it
but others sayth hee secondlie doe aunswer that this authour speaketh of the civil law the law of emperours to weete that by the emperours lawes it is lawfull for men but not for women

having put away their mate to marrie another and that paul therefore least he should offend the emperour

would not say ex+pressely
if a man put away his wife let him abide so or be reconciled to his wife
now gratians second aunswer was no lesse worthy to have bene mentioned then this of

william lindan patched vp by bellarmin
for the

civill law pronounceth the band of marriage to be loosed as well by divorcement as by death and alloweth women to take other husbands their former being put awaie as it alloweth men to take others wives
so that it is a fond and vnlearned conceit to imagin that paul would not say of husbands as hee did of wives least hee should offend the emperour by speaking expresselie against that which his law al+lowed
for

hee did expressely controll the law in saying of the wife
if shee depart from her husband let her remaine vnmarried or be reconciled to her husband
and the authours wordes doe shewe that hee meant to speake not of humaine lawes but of divine of the sacred scripture wherevpo he wrote and what was thereby lawfull
which seemed so evident vnto

peter soto

sixtus senesis and

the roman censors who oversaw pope gregorie the thirtenths new edition of the cannon law that they confesse that ambrose meaning this authour doth aprove plainely certainly vndoubtely mens liberty of marrying againe after divorcement
bellarmin therefore comyng in with his third aunswer
yet saith hee if these be not so well liked it may be aunswered easilie that the author of those commentaries is not ambrose nor any of the renowned fathers

as learned men know
thus at length this authour if men will not beleeve that his wordes are corrupted or that hee spake of the civill law shall be graunted vs with bellarmins good leave but then wee shall be tolde that hee is not ambrose nor anie of the renowned fathers as learned men know
and why could not bellarmin aunswere this at first why was hee so loath to graunt that such an authour base obscure of sclender credit maketh with vs herein there lieth a mysterie
there is

in this authours commentaries a place a

peece of a sentence which seemeth to speake for the popes supremacie though perhaps never writen by this authour or not with that meaning as have shewed els+where

bellarmin had cited that place for that in

ambrose his name and

make a feast thereof as being sure ambroses
now if hee should saie that the authour of those co~mentaries was neither ambrose nor saint hee should gainsaie himself
and sith hee was learned when hee did cite it so and therefore knewe by his owne words that it was not ambrose nor anie of the renowned fathers who writt it men would see thereby that hee had for the popes sake against his owne knowledg fathered on ambrose that which is not his
no mar+veil then if bellarmin came to this aunswere as a beare to the stake
at the which though hee seeme to cast vs by saying that the authour was no renowned father and erred in mistaking paul as having geven more libertie to men then wome in due place afterward yet in the meane season hee is forced to graunt that this auncient father tooke it to be lawfull for men to marrie againe after divorcement for adulterie
the sundrie evasions and shifts whereby the papists have laboured to wrest the credit of this one out of our ha~des doe geve mee occasion to suspect that they will wrangle much more to withdraw from vs the first councell of arles

being more auncient in time in credit greater and as

one of themselves doth probably coniecture confirmed by the pope also
herevnto the councels wishing of certaine persons not to marrie in the case wee treat of might serve them for a colour in as much as

it saith concerning them whose wives are taken in adulterie that if they be yong men and forbidden to marrie

advise should be given them as much as may be not to take other wives while the former live though adulteresses
but this giving of advise is in truth an argument that the councell iudged a man no adulterer if hee tooke another wife
els would they have given not advise and counsail but charge and commandement to refraine from it and as it is likely restrained mens transgression therein with sharpe discipline spetially considering

they punish lesser faults with excommunication
neither it is nothing that they temper also this counsail and advise to be geven such with

as much as may be
and a farder circumstance yet of more importance they make not this restraint for all men but for

yong men

nor for all yong me but such as are forbidden to marrie meaning as it seemeth those who being vnder the care of their parents were by them forbidden could not honestlie disobey
for had not this respect or the like moved the fathers of the councell why should they have restrained such yong men not other nay why onelie yong men not rather men not aged men or them also sith in

scripture elder women are chosen to be widowes and yonger willed to marrie
our adversaries therefore must yeeld that the councell of arles is of our side for the point in question
whereto they shall have greater reason to induce them if they note with al that the

councell of vannes in the same countrie

the age following made this canon
wee appoint and ordeine that they who having their wives except for whoredom as it is said in the gospel or vpon proofe made of adulterie marrie others shalbe excommunicated least

sinnes being suffered by our too much gentlenes doe provoke other men to loosenes of transgressing
and this decree finde not anie of the papists that goeth about to shift of· neither can see how they may possiblie the councell expounding so plainely christes wordes of marriage forbidden after divorcement vnlesse it be for whoredome and accompting marriage after such divorcement not a lesser sinne but no sinne at all as the reason added for strength of their decree sheweth now for the next the generall councell assembled in the emperours palace of conantinople which made the like decree and taught the same doctrine as have declared bellarmin would persuade vs vpon other occasions touching poperie nearer the quick then this doth that the western byshops neither gave thereto with their presence nor approved the canons thereof with their consent
to this end hee denieth that the said councell was a generall councell striveth in his

third controversie to aunswer some of our reasons which confirme it
but hee easeth vs of paines to fift his aunsweres by meanes that himself in the

fourth co~troversie discoursing of generall coun+cels purposelie doth recke it amongst the
for as in

me~s lawes whe they are repugna~t one vnto another the later derogateth fro the former so trow when bellarmin doth contradict himself his last word must hold
and the more reaso it should so in

this because both

pope adrian the first of auncient tyme did call it the sixth councell declaring thereby hee tooke it to be one of the ge~eral cou~cels whereof he tearmed it the sixth and in

the seaventh generall councell su~dry fathers alleaged it by the name of the sixth generall avouched it to bee iust+ly called so
which sentence of theirs being not controled by any of that councell and the

councell it self afterwarde approving the decrees and canons of the sixe generall councels it is verie probable that the western churches yeelding their co~sent to the seave~th cou~cel and taking it for sound accounted as

the eastern still have done doe that which they entitled the sixth to bee generall
specially seeing that in the west men of great credit

ivo and

gratian and

pope innocentius the third and their disciples the whole schoole of cannonists have on those authorityes of the seaventh councell made like recko+ning of it
and although our yonger papists for the most parte and some of the elder perceyving what advantage may be tak+en thence agaynst many grounds of popery doe crosse their pre+decessours herein with

seely reasons such as where of the would inferre more forceablie that their councell of trent was no generall councel yet amo~g the also there are who allowe the auncient opinyon as

caranza namely andf genebrard and surius with whose preface te~ding to the proofe therof it is recommended published by papists in the two perfitst and last editions of the councels
wherefore whether anye of the west were present in person or by deputyes

and subscribed to it which balsamon and

nilus learned greeke fathers avouch by olde records or whether it were celebrated by eastern byshops onely as the

second generall councell also was in the same city of constantinople the consent of the west approving it for generall averreth my sayings by a cloude of witnesses of the western churches
pope gregory the third followeth

hee graunteth that if a woman by reason of sicknesse wherewith shee were taken could not performe the duty of a wise to her husband her husband might put her away and marrie another
more then by the doctrine of christ hee had learned to graunt for any sicknes but so much the likelyer that he

thought it should bee graunted for whoredom expressely mentioned by christ
wherevpon

ioverius a sorbonist in a worke approved by sorbonists matcheth his canon with the like of councels who gave the innocent partie leave to marrie againe after divorcement while the other lived
neither doth bellar+min denye the illation but the proposition which the poynt inferred is grounded vpon
for the doctors sayth hee mea~ing the canonists expound the canon of such sicknesse as maketh a woman vnfitt for marriage and so is an impediment disolving matrymonye contracted by shewing it was no true matrimonye
but the doctor of doctors

gratian himself vnderstood it otherwise of sicknsse befalling to her who was an able wife
and those his glosse writers vse most that exposition which bellarmin would have vs recieve for authentick as the fittest salve yet rest

they not vpon it
and

antonius a great canonist archbyshop of flore~ce correctingp gratians slipp of memorie for the persons concludeth with him for the matter
and the flower of lovan

tapper the chauncelour of their viniversity approveth this of antonius
and

the learned men who were of the last edition of the councels doe witnesse by co~trolling it as a thing which now the church observeth not

that gregory meant of sickenesse vnto lawfull wives in their iudgement and the pope himselfe as

bellarmin noteh els where declareth that hee tooke it to bee true matrymonie by saying that the man ought not to bereave the former wife of ayde that is ought to maynteyne finde her as his wife still
wherfore if no catholique byshop would imagin that a man may law+fully put away his sick wife and marrie another vnlesse hee thought the same much more to bee lawfull in an adulterous wife as wee are to presume then must the papists by consequent acknowledg that the poynt in question is prooved and allowed by gregory the third
a playner and directer allowance thereof appeareth in a canon of his successor zacharie who whe a certayne man had defiled himself incestiously with his wives sister graunted that his wife should be divorced from him and vnlesse shee were privie to that wicked act by counsayling or procuring it might marry in the lord if shee could not conteine
this so cleare a testimony of an

auncient pope

authorizing the divorced woman to marrie bellarmin would elude by saying that hee meant shee might marrie another after the former husbands death
as who say the pope inioyning the

man and the whore for a punishment to stay and abyde without hope of mariage were likly to mea~e by liberty of marriyng graunted the guyltlesse for a benefite that while the guilty lived who might overlive her shee should not marrye no more then hee
or as though there had bene neede for the pope then to graunt it with exception

if she will not conteine let her marrie in the lord
whereby it seemeth that hee rather wished her to refrayne from marriage if shee might be induced thereto which hee had no cause to wish on this occasion after the mans death she being then simply free

and willed to marrie

such might her age be
but what doe reason out of the circumstances in a thing so certayne and cleare of it self that although the

great maisters whom bellarmin alleaged before followed here have assayed to darken the light thereof by this mist

yet sixtus senensis confesseth that pope zachary decreed that the women if shee would not conteine should marry another husband while the former lived
it is true that sixtus seeketh to helpe the matter another way somwhat by yoking the pope with provinciall councels who hee sayth allowed decreed it not by a generall and perpetuall ordinance but for a tyme to certaine nations that in such heynous crymes as incest onely but will the papists stand to this doctrine that the popes decrees bynde not al nations generally nor are perpe+tually to last the must they acknowledg which would touch the papacie popery verry neerely that the popes supremacie is falsly pretended hee hath his certeyn limits as metropolitanes have and some will reason also that the lawes of popes were to last for a tyme vntil luther rose but for a tyme onely there date is out now
as for the cryme of incest wherevpon the pope allowed the innocent partie to put away her husband and to marrie another that confirmeth rather the poynt in question then disproveth it
for hee had no warrant to allow this by but our

saviours doctrine forbidding such divorcement except it were for whoredom so that he might not have graunted it for incest vnlesse hee had thought it lawfull for adulterie

neither did hee consider the cryme but as comprised vnder adulterie too whereof in a generall sense meant by the

law incest is a kinde
and therefore in speaking of her with whom the detestable act was committed hee tearmed her

the adulteresse not the incestious person
thus it is apparant that in this matter pope zacharie was no papist
no more was the councel of wormes which shewed their iudgment to the like effect to weet that a man who could prove his wife to have been of counsail with such as sought his death might put her a+way and marry another if hee would
presuming that belike which they might iustely as

examples teach vs that shee was nought of her body with some of the conspiracie
for els had the councell expressely authorized the same that

christ conde~+neth if for any other cause then for adulterie they had allowed the man to marrie
therefore

covaruvias reckoneth

vp this councell among the who held that a man having lawfully put away his wife for her whoredom might take another while shee lived
yet a certaine spanish frier named raymund one of pope gregory the nynthes speciall the compiler of his decretals

would avoyd it also after gratians manner by false expo+sition as if the councell had meant a man might take another wife after the death of the former
to the more effectuall perswading whereof that questionlesse they meant so hee vseth a speciall trick of popish cunning
for making shewe of registe+ring the councels owne in steed of those wordes

hee may put away his wife and marry another if he will the frier setteth downe these

hee may after his wives death marrie annother if hee will
and whereas the councell had sayd

as we thinke which wordes had bene absurdely put in if they hadd meant after his wives death hee might marrie another a thing agreed on and vndoubted the frier as theeves are wont to deface and suppresse the markes of things which they have stolen least they be taken thereby leaveth that cleare out
but by the mouth of two witnesses

burchardus byshop of wormes and

gratian or

palea both elder then the frier and from whom of likelyhod hee receaved this canon of the councell of wormes his false and irreligious dealing is bewrwayed
whereto may the confession of the third bee added though in years yonger yet

greater in credit for things agaynst papists himself a popish doctor and burning light of paris ioverius meane who sayth of that councell that it allowed the innocent partye to marrie agayne after divorceme~t the other being yet alive
and the councell it self maketh farder proofe that they are not vniustely charged by ioveruis and covariuvias with this iudgeme~t

for if any man had committed wickednesse with his daugh+ter in lawe the daughter of his wife by her former husband

they agreed that hee should keepe neither of the but his wife might marrie another if shee would if shee could not conteyne and if shee had not carnall company with him after that she knew of his adulterie with her daughter
the last clause whereof sheweth that they ment of liberty graunted her to take another husband while the former lived sith it cannot be thought with reason but they iudged shee might take another the former though shee had continnued with him as his wife after shee knew of his adulterie
the

councell of tribur did maynteyne the same ordeyning that if any committed vilany with his mother in law her husband may take another wife if hee will if hee cannot conteine and the like order is to bee observed if with his daughter in law or his wives sister
bellarmin like the

paynter who being good at purtraing of a cypresse tree when one gave him money to draw and represent a shipwrack in a table asked if hee would have a cypresse in dispai+ring to doe ought worth perhaps vnlesse that helped saith that all such canons all not onely this of the triburian councell are vnderstood of marriage graunted to the innocent par+ty after the death of the former wife or husband
an answer no fitter for this and all such canons then a cypresse tree is for a shipwrack as those of pope zachary the councell of wormes the former whereof hee garnisheth also with this cypresse tree doe argue
for the same reasons which proved zacharies can on to bee meant of the womans marriage while the man lived prove the councel of triburs to bee likewise meant of of the mans in the womans
the punishment inflicted there+in

on the offe~ders doe equally enlarge the benifit to the innocent
the

exception added to the enlargeme~t is stronger implying they would have him staye vnmarried rather if he can conteyne
the testimonye of sixtus is all one for both neither

doth the quallity of the cryme of incest more infringe the argument heere then it did there
and this extenuation that the councell beeng a provinciall councell ordeined it for men of their owne province and for that tyme onely encreaseth the authority thereof if the precious bee severed from the vile the truth from the falshood
for why affirmeth hee that they did ordeyn it for that tyme onely the forme of their decree touching

all generally that should offend so not some particular per+son who presently had they speaking of the thinge as

lawfull in it self and

to bee observed alike in like cases their makinge of

other canons to that effect yea

another councel also per+adventure no limitatio of tyme in any of them doe persuade the contrarie
now whereas they ordeyned it for men of their owne province their modesty was the greater who did not take vpon them as popes to make lawes for men of all nations but looked as byshops to their owne diosaes
and the greater modesty the liker to

christ and the better to be liked of

christ+ians the more reverence to be

heard with and their iudgme~t had in greater estimation
beside that this decree of theirs was establyshed also by

the councell of wormes

and

at that tyme pipinus king of fraunce and of a great parte of germany was present
who as hee did keep a gener+all assembly of his people

there so by all likelyhoode called byshops thither out of his whole realme to make decrees for the whole
a province of such largenesse that

councells co~sisting of byshops assembled out of no greater have bene tear+med generall and woorthely as

bellarmin confesseth in comparison of provinciall councells commonly so called wher+in there were not byshops of a whole nation or realme
thus sixtus by striving to lessen diminish the credit of the cano of the cou~cel of tribur hath give vs occasio to make the more of it co~sidering on the one side the modestie of the byshops who were assembled there and made decrees for their province on the other the province which that decree was made for so large that all the provinces of italie cannot match it though they were lincked in one
had it not bene better for him with out this retorique to say directly and flattly as

ioverius doth that the councell of tribur made the like decre to the councell

of wormes which now the church hee meaneth the popish church receyveth not whether any papist wil take excptio agaynst the councell of mascon

which allowed likewise a certain man whose wife had bene defloured by his brother beefore hee wedded her to put her away and marry another it may bee wee shall know hereafter
but vnto a councell that made another such decree as

gratian sheweth alleaging it without name bellarmin taketh two exceptions one that it is lost the other of the cypresse tree
touching the former not as much as the name thereof sayth hee is extant therefore it might be easily contemned sett at nought
why is it therefore worse then all that have names because it is namelesse then have

manye cardinals with other learned reverent men bene much to blame for writing so of rome as if it had a number of wicked lewd prophane
for by there report the romans having everye one a name or two should bee worse for the most parte then were the atlantes a people of africke whom

diodorus siculus commendeth verie heighly for godlynes and humanity yet non of the had anie name

herodotus saith
or if this bee a fable as

plinie seemeth rather to thinke and well it may be yet is it most certayne that plutarch recordeth as grave and wise sayings of lacedemonyans without names as of any whose names are known
and bellarmin trust will graunt that in the scriptures there is no lesse account to be made of the booke of ioshua then of nehemias of iob the of the proverbs though their names who wrote the one bee not sett downe as theirs who wrote the other
but hee will say perhaps that of this councell not onely the name is vnknowen but also the worke it selfe lost
and what if it be were not

those of varroes workes which wee have not as learned as the worke

of floccus which wee have of tullie of polybius of livie dio tacitus of infinite writers more are there not as good bookes lost as there are extant

the same hath fallen out in eclesiasticall authors specially in councels whereof a great many are not to be found as they who by occasion of canons cited thence in the decrees and decretals have dilligently searched through the chiefest liberaaies of europe doe note
and a certaine famous and auncie~t councel of ments

beeing commended and praised above the other by

tretenius and surius

who wisheth hee might have gotten it to be publyshed sheweth that some extant are not to bee compared with some that are lost wherefore bellarmins former exception to the councell that it is not extant no nor the name of it was not worth the nameing
the latter that the councels canon was meant of marriage after the former wives death is lyke to prove as false as the profe thereof is frivolous and fond
for

these are the words of the canon a certaine woman laye with her husbands brother it is decreed the adulterers shall never bee married but lawfull marriage shalbe graunted vnto him whose wife the vilenie was wrought with
which words are well expoun+ded saith bellarmin by the doctors and their meaning gathered

out of the like canon following a litle after wherein it is ordeined that when the adulterous wife is deceassed her man may marrie whom hee will but her selfe the adulteresse may not marrie at all no not her husband being dead
gratian in deed and the glosse on him the doctores meant by bellarmin doth them wrong in saying they expound it rightly
for this cano following out of which they gather that to bee the meaning being a canon of know not what gregory at least fathered on him doth noe more prove it then

the above alleaged canon of gregory the third permitting marriage to the innocent partye while the other lived doth inferre the co~trarie
and the councells words mentioning expressely the innoce~t parties freedom and liberty to marry which had bene superfluous if they meant of marriage after the others death make it most probable that the councell vttered them with the same meaning wherewith others vttered the like as hath bene shewed
herevnto the iudgement of

sixtus senensis doth add no small weight sith he albeit striving to weaken the strength and cutt the sinewes of it acknowledgeth notwithstanding that it was of one minde with the councell of tribur

so was pope alexander the third too some tyme though bellarmin alleage

him as of another mynde
but let bellarmin say whether hee had two myndes and erred in on of them seing it is certaine hee was of this minde once vnlesse hee wrote against his minde
for where as a man that had wedded a wife did before hee entred the

with her enter her mothers bed pope alexander sayde that hee doing some pennance might bee dispensed with to marrie another wife
here the popes favour towards the offender doth favour of that which

hath bene mis+sliked in papall dispensations
but he that graunted thus much to the incestuous husband would trust have graunted it to the guiltlesse wife as

hee did also to her that had this iniurie
the onely evasion whereto a bellarminian might by his maisters example have recourse is that the canonists expou~d the popes words not of a wife but of a spouse her espoused also by wordes of the tyme to come not of the tyme present

which exposition may seeme the more probable because the popes wordes sett downe in the decretalls geve her the na+me of spouse without signification that the man had wedded her
but hereof frier raymund who compiled clipped the decretalls must beare the blame as

antonius contius a learned lawier of their owne hath well observed
for the popes epistle which is extant whole in the

tomes of councels declareth that the woman was the mans wedded wife though he did forbeare her companie a while
no remedi~e but it must be graunted that in this matter pope alexander the third subscribed to the former councels
now by all the rest whom aleaged there is none excepted against by anye papist for ought that know or as thinke will bee
for

lac+tantius first avoucheth so the lawfulnes of putting away ma~s wife for adulterie even with intent to marry another that both

covaruvias and

dominicus soto graunt him to be cleare from it
next

touching the authours mentioned by gratian as holding the same for one kinde of adulterie who doubted but there were certaine so persuaded when such an adversarie confesseth it
then for pope celestin the thirde sith

a pope saith hee thought that a man or wife might lawfully forsake their parteners in wedlocke for haerisie and marry others see not how the papist may denye hee thought it lawful for adulterie more then shewed they might of gregory the third
and albeit

zacharie byshop of chrysopolis may seeme to shew rather what other mens opinion was then what his owne yet it is apparant by his manner of handeling that hee ioyned with

ambrose therein whose words hee citeth and fenseth them against authorities that might bee opposed
as for the byshop of burgos paul commended heighly by

learned men for learning

hee sayth that it is manifest by christs doctrine that whosoever putteth away his wife for whoredom commit+eth not adulterye though hee marry another

naclantus who was present at the councel of trent a byshop of principall name and price among them affirmeth as directly that a wife being losed from her husband by death or by divorcement is not an adulteresse if shee marrie another
to conclude bellarmin confesseth that erasmus caietan catharinus luther melancton bucer calvin brentius kemnitius peter martyr and in aworde all lutherans and calvinists as it pleaseth this roman tertullus to name vs poore

nazarens agree that our saviour doth allow marriage after divorcement for adulterie howbeit fearing much what a deadly wounde hee might geve his cause by graunting that erasmus caietan catharinus three so learned men and two of the such pillars of the romish church a cardinall an arch byshop agree in this poynt with lutherans caluinicts he addeth that those three differ much fro these hertiques mea~ing by heretiques the na+zarens spake of

whose was paul in as much as they submitt the~selves expressely to the churches iudgement
and because the church saith he hath now opened her minde most evidently as appeareth by the cou~cel of tre~t the
sessio the cano where all who thinke the band of marriage maye be loosed for any cause are acursed therefore it seemeth that those three also chiefly the two later must be thought no otherwise minded in this matter the

all the rest of the are have bene with great agreeme~t co~sent which dispute of bellar if it have sufficie~t grou~d strength of reaso erasmus must be cou~ted a catholique in al things for

in al his writings he submitteth himself to the churches iudgeme~t
the why doth

bell cal him a demie christia

enrol his na~e amo~g sectaries hertiques what are the fathers of the cou~cel of tre~t sectaries heretiques thy are by bellar logique of one minde with erasmus
moreover austin the ciefeft ma of bellar side in this questio must be cou~ted ours by

the same logique
for

he taught expressely that himself yea any byshop eve cipria yea provincial cou~c too should yeeld to the authority of a general cou
and the general cou grau~ted liberty of mariage after divorcme~t as hath bene declared wherfore if caieta must be thought no otherwise mynded then papists are because that church whose iudgme~t he did submitt himself to defined so at tre~t

a good while after his death astin must be thought no otherwise minded the we are because our assertio was co~firmed likewise by a general cou~cell whereto hee would have yeelded
chiefly sith of liklyhood hee would have more easily yeelded theru~to the caietan to his chur+ches because

caieta sheweth hee was stiffe in holding fast his owne opinio

whe for feare of he durst not say all that he thought in this very point though

submitt~ig hi~self to the see of rome as wel as to the church

he eludeth decrees of

popes that make against him

so resolute he was in it
sr au+stin co~trariwise vsed very modestly willingly to retract things that he had writte eve whe

he lighted on ought in an heretike that seemed better truer this point he thought

so darke in the scripturs hard to be discerned that his opinio was not hard to be removed if he had see stro~ger reason broght against it or greater authority
now if anstin come over to our side by that quirck of bellar
a band of bellar wittnesses is like to come with him namly the cou~cel of melevis affrique

which he was prese~t at swaied much with perhaps primasius also

were he austins scholar bede with a nu~ber of cano~ists and schooleme who folowed most austin
but bellarmin will ne+ver resigne all these vnto vs to gaine the other three fro vs
for

as our saith men live not by losses
he must suffer therefore erasmus caietan catharinus specially who beside the

place that bellar hath quoted doth avouch the matter in a treatise written purposely thereof more throughly exactly then erasmus or caietan bellarmin say must suffer them to be counted of that minde which they were of while the~selves lived not cavill as if they were of that which peradventure they would have bene

had they not died before the councell of tre~t taught so
vnlesse he thinke which he may by as good reaso that whereas they were deceased above yeares yer the

trent made that new canon wee ought to count them alive all that while because they did submitt to physitia~s and would have lived perhaps till then had arte bene able to cure disseases
how much more agreablye to singelnes truth doe

sixtus

covarruvias and

domenicus soto acknowledge the two former touching catharinus the last for erasmus all concerning caietan that in this question of marriage agayne after divorcement for adulterie their doctrine is the same with those auncient fathers whom our yonger teachers of the reformed churches follow
and thus if should e~ter into the comparison of divines on both sides first for the number it is more then likely that wee prevayle much

popes allowe alexander punished one who blessed it;o innocentius checketh a decree of alexander that deprived the innocent partie of his

right because the offendour had sinned thus or thus alex+ander whether in this decree knowe not for it is razed out of the

decretals but in other extant overthwarteth himself as his words aleaged on both parties for bellarmin for vs doe testefie
so bellarmins obiections of humaine infirmities and wants notwithstanding they which are of our side excel in esti+mation those which are of his for diverse circumstaunces and respects
and the most important respect of all others the ground wherevpon

ours doe buyld their doctrine is the plaine evidence expresse testimony of our saviour

christ excepting whoredo namely out of the causes for which he denieth a man may put away his wife marrie another
contrariewise the ground that our adversaries buyld on is their owne co~ceit not able to stand without violent wresting suppressing or corrupt+ing of christs exception the proofe whereof is seene in three the most peremtorie men for this matter and best accounted of a+mong them innocentius the first the third thomas of aquin

thomas in that he answereth that christs exception pertaineth to the putting away of the wife not to the marring of another also innocentius the first in that he omitteth the exception quite

citeth christs words thus whoso putteth away his wife for whoredom marrith another doth commit adulterie

innocentius the third in that he depraveth altereth the exception affirming that christ saith

whosoever putteth away his wife for whordom marrieth another doth commit adulterie whosoever putieth awaye his wife for whoredom
a notable corruption by scraping out of the sentence

the exceptive particle having the force of a nega+tive to change for this point into an affirmative so easily to be corrupted by the text of the scripture it self that doubted whether it were not the printers or bookewriters errour vntyll perceived that all the printed copies which could gett the sight of did agree therein even the newe one too of gregorye the thirtenth conferred with all the written copies in the popes liberarie beside many other corrected by them
but of such buyldings such must be the groundworkes or equall vnto such in force an vntruth will never cleave vnto the truth by other kinde of morter in probabillity therefore it is to bee presumed that not onely the greater parte of the fathers but the better

also and they whose groundes are surer doe maintayne our doctrine
so the weapon which bellarmin draweth out of their sheath against vs doth bend backe and turne the poynt against himself and the wound it may geve it can not pearce so deepe as

that which is sharper then two edged sworde but the wound it may geve it geveth to his owne cause howbeit if any shall conceive otherwise hereof for the number quality of the witnesses as some peradventure will may by reason of broken coniectures which the variety of circumstances yeel deth yet no man will trust sure no man of modestye and sense can denie but the mayne and principall poynt hadd to shewe namely that the fathers consent not in one for the papists doctrine is shewed to their sha~e whose face co~scie~ce served the to avouch the co~trary
wherfore sith our adversaries doe grau~t that the fathers have not stre~gth enough to prove a point in questio vnlesse they all co~sent about it bellar
with his pa~phletter must co~seque~tly grau~t that their cursing tre~t assertio in this point cannot be proved by fathers and so the seco~d staffe which they have fra+med the~selves to leane vpo is like to that broke staff of reed

egipt whervpo saith the scripture if a man leane it wil goe into his hand pearce it

the fovrth chapter

the conceits of reason vrged last aganst vs are oversights proceeding from darknes not from light and reason it selfe dispelling the mist of popish probabilities geveth cleare testimony with the truth of christ

the third and last obiection wherevppon the and his schollar stand is

conceit of reason devided into five braunches as it were or riverets issuing fro one spring
the water whereof how vnlike it is to

the water of siloah savoring of that puddle of which the roma deputie gallo did draw when having vndertaken to doe

according to reason

he spake prophanely of reli+gion

suffered one to bee wro~gfully vexed for regarding it as if to doe iustice in that case were against reason leave it to bee iudged and considered by them who saye that

our reason is naturally darke and

leadeth her wise men into sottish fol+lies neither can discerne the things which are of god till it bee lightened by his spirit

for although the papists have some glimse of light see more then the

heathe~s as

the pharises did

whose wordes am afraied they will vse likewise are wee also blinde yet as

the pharises were overseene fowlly in ma+ny of their argume~ts grounded vpon reason so the papists may bee
and that they not onely may be overseene but are in the reasons which their hath yelded vnto bellarmins cisternes in this poynt the bea~es of reaso lighte~ed fro above shall ope descrie let such as love not darknes more then light bee iudges
for hee reasoneth first thus the marriage of the faithfull is a singe of christs coniunction with the church as st

paule teacheth
but that coniunction is indissoluble and cannot bee loosed the band of marriage is threfore indissoluble too
as if a rebell should say
the ioyning of the head with the body in man resembleth the coniu~ction of christ with the church as st

paul teach+eth

but christ the church can never bee parted there fore the head maye never bee cut from the bodye
a happye co~clusion for traytors if it were true
but if it bee faulse where then is bellarmyns reason which will take the greater overthrow by this because looke

how christ is the head of the church semblably the husband is the wives head
so that notwithstanding the similytude of christs the ioynt whereby a traytorous head is knit vnto his bodye may feele the axe of iustice as bell
will grau~t the marriage band that coupleth a man to an adulterous wife may be loo+sed by like reaso notwithsta~ding marriage is a signe of christs co~iunctio with the church
and if this suffice not to make him acknowledg the loosnes fondnes of his sophistical syllogisme let him observe farder that the seperatio which the~selves allowe in case of adultery is conde~ned by it
for christ dot co~tinue with his church

alway cherisheth her

for ever with his spirit of co~fort he is so farre fro dispoyling her of her owne wealth if shee had any that of

his gifts graces still he leaveth with her
now the

papists teach that a man may lawfully withdraw him+self fro ever dwelling with his wife fro yeelding love duty to her yea

may stil her owne dowry fro her if shee be an adulteresse
which doctrine how could bell cleanse fro stayn of errour if some whore of rome should touch it with this reaso
the marriage of the faithful is a signe of christs co~iu~ction with the church as pavl

teacheth but christ doth stil assist relieve enrich the church with his graces therefore must the husba~d dwel stil with his wife finde her maintena~ce wealth
would

he

say the of trent accurseth al who make such iesuitical syllogis+mes sophymes against their sacred cano
certainly the harelots reaso must be good vnlesse the iesuits be naught
but he go+eth onward addeth that albeit some partes of the church to weete some faithful folke doe comit spiritual whordo now then make a di+vorceme~t yet it is not lawfull for them to cha~ge their god
what a spech is this as who say our saviour could deserve at our hands that we should forsake him ourselves a newe bridgro
neither doth god cast the so away saith bell that he wil not be reco~ciled nay he doth exhort to reco~cileme~t

still still to whom then

sware he they should not enter into his rest what

were they whose carkeises fell in the wildernes whence came the man of god

who willed the

that co~mit idolatry to be slayne where lived the

prophet who saies thou distroyest all the that goe a whoring fro thee the israelites who god did shut out of the promised land of who he tooke ma+ny thousa~ds away by su~dry plagues to who

the lawe speaketh as being vnder the law did they not professe that faith vse those sacram which al that doe are faithful folk partes of the church in

bell phrase meaning grau~t that

god offereth to be reco~+ciled somtymes to such offenders waiteth in mercie long for their ame~dement
which if it be a pattern for vs to follow herein say if it be for god gave tyme of repe~tance to

ioab a murderer who the

magistrate should have put to death

prese~tly god gave tyme of repenta~ce to

idolatrous wives of the iewes whom

their husbands ought not to have spared so if therefore gods actio herin be set downe for our imitatio the ma that can conteyne be without a wife as god without our service maye likewise in mercie waite for her repentance when he perceyveth it to be vnfayned take her againe to be his wife
but he who can not or will not render such kindnes for such vnkindnes wickednes may in iustice also put her so away that no place or hope of reconcileme~t be left her as bell owne reason in this similitude teacheth
for god is not bound to give vnto prophane dispisers of his grace breakers of his covena~t place of repenta~ce reconciliatio nay he may in iustice absolutely denye it them oftentymes doth as the examples of

cain of

esau of

corah dathan abiram of

zimri of

acan of

ananias saphira of sinfinit other that haue either prese~tly dyed in their

innes or had sentence of death pronounced irrevocably against the doe argue
wherefore when bell co~cludeth this reaso with saying that

austin vrgeth it greatly in his booke of the good of marriage he dealeth as cookes do in larding to give that a relish which of it self would be vnsavoury
though even for the lard too perhaps it agreeth not half so wel herewith as this italia cook would have vs thinke it doth
for why did not au+stin vrge the same likewise in his

bookes of adulterous marriages writte

afterward purposely maintaining this point against pole~tis who gainsaied him in it was it because he saw that he had vrged it more the it would beare wel or that he perceived it would not hould against an adversarie though without an adversairye it were a pretie allusion at least whatsoever men of the

lard the meat is naught such that though the cook be conte~t to eate the driest morsel of it yet must he nedes graunt that it hath not tast not as much as

the white of an egg hath
for

himself saith that marriage betokeneth signifieth christs coniu~ction with the faithful soule as

thomas

the pope teach
but chricts coniunctio with the faithful soule is not indissoluble as him self also saith the ba~d of marriage therfore by his owne co~seque~+ce may be dissolved loosed
and thus farr of his first sophisme

the next is that if other marriage were lawful

the should be iniuried for the childre borne already saith he should be evill provided for who should begin to have a stepfather in steed of a father a stepmother in steed of a mother
where hence the conclusio secretly inferred to weere other marriage therfore is not lawful would very wel folow if his formost grou~d propositio were true that the childre should be iniuried therby
for it is not lawful to deale iniuriously with any he

that doth wrong shal receive for it
but how proveth bel that they should be his reason ensueth for they should be evill provided for
what therefore iniured is god vniust then who by tak+ing men out of this present life doth leave their wives widowes their children fatherlesse both often destitute of help god forbid saith

the apostle els how shall god iudg the world but the childre shold be endamaged therby that perhaps will bell
say was his well
they should be endamaged evil provided for
why because they should have a stepfather in steed of a father or stepmo+ther in steed of a mother
then belike

the brau~ches cut of the olivtree which was wild by nature graffed co~trary to nature in aright olivetree are evill provided for endamaged by it
for as when a gardiner asked why the hearbs which he set or sowed doe grow and shoot vp slowly where weeds which the earth brought forth of her owne accord encreased apace

aesop said that it was because the earth is the weeds mother the herbs so the wild olive tree was the mother that brought forth those brau~ch+es the right olive tree whereinto they were graffed is their step mother
paul

who thought it better for vs of the gentiles to be graffed so the to continue as we were

the children of wrath by nature declareth that

a christia whose wife being an infidel an vnbeleelever forsaketh him is free to marrie another
which co~sidering that he had an ey to

the holy seede their ofspring also what

letteth him to have done with this persuasion that the children should receive more good benefit by a beleeuing then by an vnbeleeving mother
doubtlesse

his care of having them brought vp in godlynes a thing that

godly mothers doe furder very much

vngodly hinder is a great argume~t he was of this minde
and the sonne of catiline whom that

adulterous wretch

his father murdered to compasse the more easily the liking of a woman whom he lusted after hath left sufficient proofes that some havi~g fathers are no better looked to for things of this life neither then they should of likelyhood if in steed therof they had stepfathers
wherfore sith experie~ce verifieth the same in me which

in woemen that whe they have made shipwracke of their chastity they will not sticke at any wickednes the argume~t that childre should be endmaged evil provided for because in steed of adulterous fathers or mothers they should have stepfathers stepmothers chast honest is

worse provided for by bell
then he thought
but suppose it were good proved that the childre should be endamaged how followeth the conclusion the childre should be endamaged by a~other marriage

therfore the marriage is not law+ful for by this reason a beleeving husba~d forsaken by his wife be+ing an vnbelever may not take a~other if he had childre by the for+mer
nay no wife or husba~d having any childre may lawfully ever marry againe eith

of the after the others death
and in deede by a law that charondas made for his thurian cityzens the men who did so were punished
and marcus antoninus an emperour of rome because he was loath to wedd a to his children his wife being dead kept a concubine
and

ierom speaking as the catharists did against second mariage doth by de+testatio of a stepfather dissuad a widowe from it
but

the papists hold agreeably to

scripture that the man is at liberty to marry in the lord after the woma~s death the woma after the mans yea

in life tyme also if either of them being an infidel vnbelee+ver forsake the other being a chistia
and bell acknowledgeth that they hold both these poynts ought to hold them
bellar shall therfore doe well to acknowledg that his which oppugneth both these poynts of sound doctrine savoureth of heresie neither maketh more for him against vs then for the catharists against the catholique fathers
wherewith he may con+fesse

too that he hath abused ambrose in affirming this to be his reaso avouching him to say that the father ought to pardo the mo+thers fault for the childrens sake
for

ambrose blaming the man who

puteth away his wife without cryme marrieth another an adulteresse by so marrying mislyketh that the children should have such a stepmother having such a mother vnder whom they might be
and if the mother being put away so tooke another husba~d who in this case were an adulterer ambrose wisheth the childre to be vnder their father not vnder such a
and if the father casting out his wife so cast out his childre with her ambrose saith the children should ratherpurchase pardo for

their mothers fault at their fathers hands then bee cast out for her sake
wherin he doth no more saye that the father ought to pardon the mothers adultery for the childrens sake then abra+ham said that god ought to forgive the sodomites abhominatio for

lots sake when he said that

the wicked should rather be spa+red for the righteous the the

righteous should be destroied with the wicked
but here peradve~ture the pa~phletter wil reply that al+though bell author argument as himself observed who there vpon cut bell shorter prove not his intent to weete that another marriage is vnlawful yet they prove such marriage to be inconvenient in respect of the children to whom there riseth hurt and discomodity by it
for answer whervnto to the like reaso~s dra+wen by him bell
from other inconveniences seven things are to be noted al such as our adversaries themselves must needes yeeld to yeelding therevnto shall set on fire their owne chaffe
the first that the man whose wife is an adulteresse may putt her absolutly away for al his liftyme nor is ever bou~d to let her dwel with him againe noe not though she repent
which point being plainly implied in our

saviours answer to the pharises

bel avou+cheth maintaineth the~ce agreably to the doctrin of his chiefest guids the

popes

thomas of aquine
the second that if the woman continue in her wickednes without repentance ame~dement the man is by duty bound to put her away
mathew reporteth of the blessed virgin that when she was found to be with child of the holy ghost before her husband ioseph she came together

isoseph being a iust man not willing to make her a publicke exaample was minded to put her away secretly
of which words importing that

iustice moved him to put her away goodwill to doe it secretly it seemeth to follow that such a woman as ioseph misdeemed her to be to weete an adulteresse ca~not be kept without sinne whether she repent or no
and

cornelius iansenius a learned byshop of the papists graunteth herevpon that it was so in the old testament
but in the new testame~t he saith if she repe~t she may be kept with out sinne acknowledging that she may not in the new test neith+er vnlesse she repent
whervnto the canonists schoolemen doe accord expounding a sentence cited by many

fathers out of the proverbs of salomon

he that keepeth an adulteresse is a foole and a wicked man a sentence found in the greeke text of the proverbs albeit not expressed out of the hebrue fountaine but added by the seventie interpreters or other perhaps to shew that salomon co~mending a wife did meane a chast wife in their iudgment but added in the greeke thence translated also into the common latin edition called ieroms so that it goeth for scripture with papists by their

trent canon this sentence say

the canons of the fathers that vrge it vndistinctly against whosoever kep+eth an adulteresse whether repenta~t or vnrepenta~t in like sorte as the

civill law co~de~ned all such

the canonists

distinguish expou~d of such as kepe adulteresses which doe not repent amend their lives
now graunting that a man may kee+pe an adultereffe in matrimony if shee repent or being divorced from her may take her again yet which is the third point hee may not doe it often least impunitie encrease inequitie
and this is agred on by the same pillars of the church of rome the

cano ists



hermes out of who the maister of the se~+tences aleageth avoucheth it meant as his reason brought to prove it argueth that the man may take her so againe but once
which doctrine the papists can make canonicall if they list vnlesse

stapleton lie who saith their catholique church at this pre+sent may add to the catalogue of ca~onicall scriptures that of hermes written in the apostles tyme by pauls schollar not onely cited much but co~mended too by many most au~cient fa+thers clemens ireneus origen athanasius eusebius ierom
at least the chiefest part of the canon law

co~piled by the directio and ratified by the authority of pope gregory the ninth setting downe the verie same out of a

councel that peter lombard out

of hermes the papists though they will not trow be of stapletons minde for

hermes booke yet may think it likely that the cou~+cel pope approved his meaning in this point
chiefly sith

pan+ormitan the flouer of the canonists having noted on it that one offending often must not be pardoned because sinnes vnpu~ished doe becom examples citeth an excelent proofe light therof a lawe of worthy emperors vale~tinianus theodosius arcadius

who grau~+ting a generall pardon for smaler trespasses extended it to none

co~mitted oftner the once accou~ting such vnworthy of their prin+cilie favour as grew by their former forgivenesse to a custome of sinning rather then to amendement
but whether the papists will iudge those christian emperours to have bene to strickt saie that adulterie deserveth pardon oftener the lesser faults with the or whether they thinke it sufficient to pardon once so great a crime which the emperours excepted by name out of their pardon willed it to be punished even the first tyme the papists doe agre that a husba~d must not forgive it to his wife ofte
the fourth thing to be noted is that the woma being putt away so doth lose her dowry too by law
which pu~ishme~t as

god hath threatned by his law to men that goe a whoring fro him though they have not any dowrie of their owne neither but of his gift so the

civil law hath i~sticted it on adultrous wives

the cano law looser tymes also
the fifth that many persons mistake the

help prepa+red of god marry or doe worse co~sidering that some cannot conteine as pope

goegory noteth touching men

ambrose tou+ching wemen the

scripture touching both some though they could perhaps yet should hurt their bodies by sicknesse if they did as

physique

phylosophie teach some though neither chastity nor health enforce the to marry yet need it for their state of living as

dominicus soto doth prove by certain poore labourers
the sixth that if a man die have no sonne his inherita~ce ought to come to his daughter by the

law of moses and if he have no daughter it ought to come to his brethere and if he have no bretheree to his fathers brethere and so forth to the next kinsman of his familie
vnto which ordina~ce the lawes of al wel

ordred states co~mon weaks are though in certaine circu~+staunces different yet in substance sutable
the seave~th that it is sundry wayes inco~modious for a child to be vnlawfully begotte

and as we tearme it base borne because both the

ignomenie thereof is a blemish

that blemish bredeth basenes of courage

bastards are not brought vp so well by their parents as lawfull children vse to be neither are they priviledged a like preaferred to

place of publique government or

benefit of inheritance by lawes divine or humane
and these things being weighed well shew that bellarmins reason corrected by the pamphleter needeth a new correction if inconveniences might decide our question which they cannot doe for

manie things are lawfull that are not expedient but if they might decide it they would swaie with vs rather then against vs
for in case the man burning with iealousie rage

which is vsuall in this kinde of iniurie or the woman beeing as

adulteresses commonlye are wicked impudent once naught alwaies naught hee will not or maie not keepe or take her againe the childre missing her are destitute of a mother to looke to their education
and then it were better for the that their father tooke a second wife to bring the vp as

plato thought
wherein another man might have the like successe that poris a gentlema of macedo~ia had

whose former wives childre were brought vp as wel and carefully by their stepmother as her owne children were
but if it fall not out with many as with him and the childrenfind more sharp hard vsage at their stepmothers hands who knoweth whether it may not turne to their mo+re good
chiefly fith the tender indulge~ce of pare~ts doth

nourish wanton wickednesse in the sonnes of eli

ambition in ado+nia

tra~sgressions in who not and

moderat severitye would re+strayne the same as

one who sayde he had a cruel stepmother a father

another who fou~d like fault with his father mother both for feare restrai~ng the~selves from tricks of u~thrifts did shew by their examples
here is a farder help too for the childrens benefite that their father having their mothers whole dowry beside whatsoever the second wife bringeth is able to doe more for the
wheras contrarywise if by means he ca~not live single u~married he be constrained to keepe the adulteresse still or after seperation to receive her againe she is likely to

geve her owne her husba~ds goods to her lover as

messallina did to siluis or though she take gifts rewards of him to

wast all in riot as the

whor+es of cattilines co~federacie did
moreover a woman that can have

no sonnes but daughters onely by her husband may have sonnes by another man as

hippocrates sheweth
which if the adulteresse have by her lover the daughters to who the inheritance should come are defrauded of it and if she have but daughters or yo~ger so~nes by him the bastards presu~ed to be lawful childre defraude the lawful children of so much as them selves gett
the cuckow hatcheth her eggs in other birds nests the eggs she findeth of theirs she devowreth as

aristotle writeth or as

plinie sayth the birds that sitteh abroade vpo her owne eggs the cuckows when both their yong are bred vp liketh the cuckows bird better then her owne suffereth them to be devoured of him in her owne sight
a tearme in reproch drawne in many languages fro the cuckows name to note their

calamity or if they suffer it wil lingly dishonesty who receive other men into their bedds fost+er vp their childre may be a sufficie~t leso for a father what co~fort benefit his childre are to looke for by having such a mother to feede oversee them
beside to omitt suspicio of bastardy where by his children also may be discouraged stained himselfe

shal be cou~ted a bawd vnto his wife must by a canon of the

of nantes doe seaven yeres publique penance be shut out al that while from the co~munion yea want the co~fort therof even at his death too by another

co if he be of the cleargie
and how can he choose but live still in feare anguish of minde least shee add

dru~cke~nesse to thirst murder to adultery meane least she serve him as

clytemnestra did agamemnon as

livia did drusus as

mrs arden did her husband or if to avoyd these griefes of shame dau~ger he put her quite away resolve never to come againe in house with her he may incurre as great dau~ger or sha~e or both nay greater on the other side by lack of a necessary help for his living or by state of body subiect to certain sicknesses or by inco~tinecie whether co~su~ing

burning him without remedy or forcing him

to da~nable remedies of whors

or worse
further more his wife the adulterous mother may be the boulder to sinne to returne

as the dog to his vomitt the sow washed to wallow+ing in the myer if she know her husband canot want a wife must have her or none which perhaps moved that ge~tlewoma of ro+me to be the more lic~etious

whom her husba~d fou~d plaing the incestuous whore with their sonne in law

after that she had her

husband bou~d by oth that he would never seperate divorce her fro him so to be free to marry another and why may not she live too in perpetual heavinesse feare least her husba~d being chayn+ed with such necessity should seeke to get himself libery of marry+ing by making her away there was a certaine spanjard whose wife drive out by him for her adultery eftsoons reco~ciled was when she offended againe divorced fro him by an ecclesiasticall iudge at his suite shutt into a monastery
the husba~d saying af+terward that he loved her that he agreed for feare to the divorceme~t desired that he might be reco~ciled to her she restored to him according to the

civill law

navarus as famous a man for skil in cano law amo~g the papists as bell
for divinity being asked his iudgme~t what should be doneheriu made answer

that the wife divorced in such sort is not bou~d to returne againe u~to her husba~d that the husbands speech of his affectio must not be easi+ly beleeved because he may faine it to the inte~t to allure her ther+by to dwell with him that he may slea or poysen her

through desire of marrying another wife after her death
of which thing saith navarus there may suspicio co~iecture rise out of the cir+cu~stances of her offence his suite cheifly in a man of the spanish natio which is more inclined to beare smal love to their wives yea being chast then to be reconciled to the being adulteresses specially after the first tyme
now though spanjards chiefly be prone to worke such feats of slaying or poysoning as this man who knew the himself a spanjard witnesseth yet an italia

mar+ques who put to death his wife taken in adulttry married another declareth that

not only spanjards wil adventure to make their wives away if finding the vnchast they must have some and would have better

finally if the wife not able to have any childre by her husband have some by an adulterer

for this may come to passe also the brethren

or the next of kinne to the husband shal loose his inheritance that which they ought to enioy by right the adulterous seede will intercept putloine
let passe the pub+like harmes disco~moditis which by

such iniquities of private persons were likely to accrew to the como weale
these that have touched suffice to overweigh our adversaries reason drawen fro inco~venie~ces
for if should stand on the childre alone eve those alreadie borne whom

bell expressely me~tioneth nameth the

hardnes of a stepfather or stepmother lighting on them by the second marriage can~ot co~uterpeise the losse in educatio wealth inheritance honour which an adulterous parent bringeth
beside that the children to be borne afteward as bell
by naming those already borne seemeth to confesse should be evil provided for whose basenes of birth disco~modities following it proceeded fro restraint of maring again after divorceme~t for adultery
wher+fore if we put withall in our balla~ce the detrime~ts harmes that grow to the father the mother the brethre kinsme of the father might say to the co~mon weale too the bala~ce of out adversaries wilbe tilted vp so high by the weight of ours as if it were lighter then vanity it selfe

and thus by the way of weaknes of bell
third fourth reaso~s is descryed dau~ted
the third that if the marriage wee treat of were lawful a gapp would be ope~ed to infinit divorceme~ts yea uro~gful vniust
the fourth that if the innoce~t party may marry the nocent also may who the should gaine by his sinne many would sinne of purpose that thy might marry others
for as one of the wisest best learned popes

pius the said that marriage was taken away fro priests for great cause but ought to be restored to them for greater so may a iudicious discrete papist supposing these reasos of bell to be sou~d say that marriage after devorceme~t for adulterie was taken away from men vppon many good co~sideratio~s but ought to be restored vnto them again vpon more better
howbeit must add thervnto that al+though his reasons be co~futed sufficie~tly with this supposali lett them be tried also by the rules of reason it wil appeare they are a great deale sou~der in shew then in deede
for

the divorceme~t of an adulteresse from her husba~d is pu~ishme~t of her sinn as ha~g+ing with vs is a pu~ishme~t of theeves of cutpurses burning thro+ugh the eare of rogues
so that bell reaso co~cluding the marriage in question to be vnlawful because a gap would be opened to infinite divorceme~ts is like as if a libertine or vagabond should say that it is vnlawful for iudges to do iustice on rogues theeves cutputses because there would be opened a gap to infinite hangings burnings through the eares
but some men sayth bell
would sowe debates pick quarels devise faulse accusatio~s against their wives being innocent so a gap would be opened to wro~g+full divorceme~ts not to divorceme~ts onely
what must no offen

no traytour no blasphemer then be put to death because many thousands of

innocent persons yea

innoce~cie it self have bene accused falsely putt to death wro~gfullie or if bell graunt that although some

sitting to iudge according to the law doe manifest wrong to guiltlesse men against law yet must wicked miscreants be exequ~ted by the magistrate

who beareth not the sworde in vaine he graunteth it is cavilling captiousnes sophistrie to conclude that me divorced lawfulie may not marry because some would therefore be divorced vnlawfully
the greater was his fault to say that this reason is touched by

ierom whose oversight he should have done better to acknowledg friendly to excuse it by his haste in writing for haste is unadvised blinde as

one said well the by his name to countenance so weake a reason in it self so daungerous in co~sequence which overtroveth all administring of iuctice iudgme~t
and sith

himself teacheth against

ieroms iudgme~t that a man whose wife entiseth him to heresie or to wic+ked deedes may be divorced from her because although the womans chastitie should come thereby into hazard yet lesse is the pe+rill hurt of her adulterie then of his wickednes or heresie the churche provideth rather for the innocent partie then for the nocent hee might with a litle indiffere~cie equitie of an vnpartial eye have seene that the church should by the same reason allowe the innocent to marrie at least that ieroms creditt cannot preiudice vs more in the one point the him in the other
true is that cannot denie which hee addeth true most true certaine that the

offendours should gaine by their sinne if they might also marrie as well as the innocent
they should gaine in deede
but as

daniel said vnto nabuchodonosor the dreame be to the that hate thee the interpretatio therof to thine enemies in like sort may say this gaine be to the enemies of god of his church
for adulterers adulteresses doe gaine first dishonesty

defiling their bodies soules with an heynous detestable crime
then

hardely scape they but they gaine beggary too the man if he be a whormo~ger wasting all co~monly as the

prodigal child did the woma losing her dowry
beside

they gaine infamy a gaine of greater value the beggary by much for

a good name is to be chosen above great riches
last of al they

gaine the heavie wrath of god his iust ve~gea~ce they lose the inhertta~ce of the kingdo of heaven purchase to

to the~selves the chaines of darknes for ever lueretia a matrone of rome in tyme of paga~isme having suffered violence of sextus tar+quinius when her husband being sent for to come vnto her

did aske her is all well no quoth she for what is well with a woman her chastity being lost yet she if better iudgeme~t might have prevail+ed with her had not lost her chastity her body being onely defiled by force her mind vndefiled
but now a christian man if yet a christian sure a iesuit the chiefest instructer of the youth of ro+me of the komanists through al christendo doth mainteyn in print that lucretia not she spake of but such

a lucretia as the

popes daughter was having lost not onely chastety but also wealth good name gods favour

the promise both of this life the life to come yet if being put away from her husba~d she may take another hath gained by her losses because she may be married to her tarquinius match a gracelesse whore with a shamlesse beast

as for the last of bell poynts of inconve~ce that many would co~+mitt adultery of purpose to the intent of being set free from their former wives they might marry others it may be some would
and have read

of a woma that had a desire to be beaten of her husba~d which she fou~d means also as she was witty to obtein in so much that she put it oft in practise till having cruelly beate her at length he killed her
the man who of purpose to get a newe wife would co~mitt adultery should desire

more strips then that woman meant

die a death infinitly more greivous then shee did
but if some as wise almost as shee was should long after scourges must they who deserve by law to be whipped be denyed it because a foole desyred it without desert the romans had an au~cient

law that whosoever did a man iniurie should by way of punishme~t pay him

about a shilling
there

was a lewd losell a youthly harebraynd ruffian who having wealth at will taking a delight in geving honest me boxes on the eares would walke vp down with a pursefull of shillings which his slave attending on him did carrie geving one a boxe would bidd his slave geve him a shelling another a boxe ashilling
what was in this case to bee done for remedie if bellarmin had lived there bene of counfail to the state wee see the advise hee would have geven namely that the amerciement should be taken away because some would doe men iniurie of purpose to fulfill their lusts with paying of a

shilling or two
but the roman governours tooke contrarie order to encrease the amerciement according to the discretion arbit reme~t of iudges that evill disposed persons might be deterred fro trespassing by sharpnes of the punishment to be inflicted on them for it whose wisdome therein it is to be wished that princes and rulers remembring themselves to be ordained as david betimes to destroy all the wicked of the land would follow by increasing the pu+nishment of adultery and then should bell mouth be the sooner stopped for his fourth reason
which yet in the mean while doth no better prove that faithful husbands seperated from adulterous wives may not marry againe the vserers extortio~ers procuring wealth by wicked vngodly means doe prove that may not enioy the goods which by lawful trades vertuous industrie they gett

the fifth last is that even among the heathe too where good orders flourished no divorces were made
for no bill of divorce+ment was written as rome for the space almost of six himdred yeares af+ter the city was buylt but afterward good orders beeing overthrowen divorces also were brought in with other vices
and this reason bellar doth lard after his maner with

tertullia~s name to season it there by give it some verdure
but it is such caraine that the lard is lost all the cookery cast away

for the first divorce which was made at rome was of a chast wife put away by her husband because she was barrein did not beare him children
now to seper+ate husbands wives for such causes we graunt it is vnlawful

our saviour allowing it for whoredo onely
the example therefore of the well ordred romans is in vaine alleaged out of tertulian against vs
but neither was there any divorce for adultery made above five hundred yeares among them will bell
perhaps say
graunt
and will help with a stronger argument that among the cians a state well ordered too seaven hundred years did passe before any divorcemet was made for adultery
for as

plutarch writeth there was no adulterye co~mitted by the space of so many hundred yeares among them
but among the roma~s will bell perhaps reply it is likely that some was co~mitted within five hu~dred yeares
true
but

the husband then might put his wife to death being convicted first of adultery

without al pub+lique iudgement
so that if bell words have any force this is their

effect among the heathen romanes while good orders flourish+ed the woman that co~mitted adultery suffered death afterward good orders being overthrowen she was divorcend onely
but whether she were put away by death or by divorcement the man might marry again
wherefore the example of the heathen romans both well and evill ordered fighteth against the popish romans and their champion
hereto the example of

all other hea+thens whose orders were but so good that they allowed second marriage may be adioyned which doe not affirme so much on myne owne knowledg though for ought have read remember it is true as on bellarmins secret confession and silence a man of greater reading and having vsed manie mens paines in search of these thinges
beside when christian faith came among the hea+thens the

emperours did punish adulterie first by death afterward iustinian mitigating that law did punish it by divorcement
but in

both these cases the man being severed from his adulterous wife was free to marrie againe
bellarmins speech therefore towching well ordered heathens came in evill seaso to raise both them others yea christians too against him
so his last reason nay his reasons all are growne to be in worse plight then were the seaven later kyne in pharaos dreame the seaven poore evil favoured leane fleshed kyne

that devoured the seaven former fatt well favoured there by saved their life
for the thinne carkeises dreamed of by bellarmin have not strength enough to overmaister eate vp the sound bodies of reasons standing ther against but gasping after them in vaine they die with famin
and thus having proved that neither light of reason nor consent of fa+thers nor authority of scripture our assertion
conclude that point demonstrated at first by the worde of truth the doctrine of chrict that a man having putt away his wife for her adulterye may lawfullie marrie another

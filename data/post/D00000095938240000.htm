the preface to the christian and reader
covrteovs reader

although all christians acknowledge that of all the affaires in this world there is none of that importance vnto man as the saying of his soule and that salvation cannot be obtaynd without the true faith and religion yet manifest experience dayly sheweth that many thowsands do carrie themselvs so slouthfully in that most important affaire of religion as if it were a matter of the least or rather of no consequence
for we see that in whatsoever error or heresy though never so monstrous men are bred for the most part they continew in the same or els according to the mutability of their inconstant leaders they passe after them from one falshood into

another without making any further search for the truth
this is truly one of the greatest miseries and the most deplorable follie of man that he should be so slouthfull and almost insensible in these things which concern his eternal salvation whereas he is so diligent carefull about his temporall affaires which are incomparably of lesser moment
neither is this negligence follie proper only to the rude and ignorant but it is also very ordinarie to many who are neither fooles nor vitious but rather have good store of worldly wisdom and of moral vertues

this then being vndenyably the common lethargie of almost all those who live in the false religions and sects of perdition wherewith the world is now pestered it is no small favour which they receive who by the divin mercy are awakned out of that dead sleep and being made to open their eys do see their own danger and seeing it strive by all means to free themselvs of it by seeking earnestly with imploring the divin assistance the right way vnto eternal happinesse
this favour god hath been pleased to vouchsafe lately vnto diverse protestants in scotland awakning them by the great confusion and division most sensible and natural marks of falshood that had falne vpon their religion and by the grievous dissensions that have been rageing a long time amongst their inconstant teachers
and amongst others he was pleased to graunt this favour vnto a certain honorable personnage who

had been a very zealous protestant relying altogether vpon the ministers words but so soon as he saw their horrible contradictions dissensions and that they condemned accursed what themselvs had before taught practized yea and furiously enforced others to follow them and swear to all their innovations replenishing in the mean time the whole nation with vnspeakable miseries calamities he thought it was not fitting nor secure for him to trust any longer these inconstant guides in a iourney of such importance since he could not prudently trust guides of such qualities in an earthly voyage
wherefore being thus awakned and not a stranger from good letters he did set himself seriously to seek the truth choosing the divin scriptures for his rule and the holy fathers for interpreters of the same by which means he conceived that he should attayn vnto the knowledge of the practice beleef of the primitive church which by all sides is acknowledged to have been the true church
and so beginning his search with the trial of the innovations which were lately introduced by the presbyterians he did not only soone find them to be against the scriptures holy fathers but also he began to see a glimse of the truth of the catholique religion which he had heard so often defamed by the ministers
for he clearly perceived by pervsing especially some peeces of augustins works and the protestants apologie that the holy fathers primitive church beleeved diverse

points which are condemned by protestants and are still beleeved by catholiques whereat he was not a little astonished especially when he saw this acknowledged by the chief divines of the late english church which pretended above all others to be most conformable vnto the primi ive times whose testimonies are diligently collected by breirly in the forementioned apologie

having then thus seen the great deformity of the scottish presbyteian kirk which is so monstrously different from the primitive and the great prevarication of the late english church he remained for some time in great perplexity of mind not being able of himself to overcome some difficulties preiudices which had been a long time beaten into his eares against the catholique religion till at length falling into the acquentance of a roman catholique whom he perceived to be somewhat versed in these questions he was pleased to vnfold his mind to him and after diverse conferences received not only full satisfaction of his doubts but also was instructed in the chief principles and immoveable grounds of the catholique faith whereby he saw also the sandy grounds of the protestant religion
being therefore in end fully resolved to enter into the bosome of the holy catholique church he desired the said catholique would be pleased first to draw vp in some few sheets the occasion motives of his conversion to the end that having these papers by him he might be more able to give

satisfaction to others who might enquire of him the reasons of his change
which was done accordingly with intention only that it might serve for his private vse
but some other zealous catholiques coming thereafter to the sight of these papers were of opinion that they might prove profitable to others if the same methode being observed the matters there touched were a little more enlarged and then published
and therefore they ioyntly desired the said catholique would be pleased to vndertake that labour giving him good hopes that not only the new converted catholiques would be thereby confirmed but also others who were seeking the truth might be helped and assisted besides some other goods which they thought might redound from it
in obedience to whose desires this labour was vndertaken by him now it is his earnest wish that it may answer their expectation albeit perhaps for that end some more time had been requisite

thus courteous reader thou hast heard the occasion of writing this book now thou maist be pleased to see a little the model and methode of it
in the first place are set down the occasions of that honorable new converts doubts concerning the truth of the protestant religion such as are the ministers inconstancy in doctrin disciplin their great dissensions and divisions their tyrannizing over mens consciences their contradicting their own principles
in which matters some late histories or passages are interlaced without

expressing the names of persons therein concerned because that was not necessary since the things here touched are publique late fresh in all mens knowledge and memories within the countrey and the persons also well enough known neither is it the digrace of any mens persons

which hierom calls the machines of heretiques but the correction of their errors which is here intended
after the occasion of the doubts is shewed in some few chapters then followeth the triall of the last pretended presbyterian reformation in the principal points thereof as its condemning of episcopacy the abolishing the hymne of glory to the father the denying the apostolical authority of the apostles creed neglecting to say our lords prayer
in all which points the presbyterians are found to go against the word of god the primitive church the former doctrines practises of many among themselvs against their first reformers and many learned protestants so that this last pretended reformation is shewed to be nothing but a reall deformation destroying not only the apostolique office government established by christ in his church but also the two chief pillars or heads of the christian religion to witt our lords prayer and the apostles creed
then followeth the trial of the first pretended reformation which is also shewed to have destroyed in effect the other two chief pillars of christianity to witt the divine commandments and holy sacraments and to have

brought in a most erroneous doctrin of iustification by faith only expresly against the scriptures holy fathers
so that these two pretended reformations are shown to have made vp between them the hideous work of desolation
after this the whole protestant church by the vndenyable principle of the perpetuity of christs church is proved not to be the true church of christ and by the same vndenyable principle the church in communion with the sea of rome and she alone is demonstrated to be the true catholique church of christ and to have in all ages still continued in the same doctrin which she received from christ his apostles notwithstanding the calumnies of heretiques
then lastly the same truth is proved by the marks whereby the true church is clearly designed in the scriptures as by her vnity sanctity vniversality apostolical succession by which marks the holy fathers also did prove the true church in their times
to which is subioyned a brief examination of the presbyterian covenant or confession of faith which although it was much idolatrized of late is shewed to be nothing but a denyall and abiuration of the holy faith with many execrations and blasphemies against it
this briefly courteous reader is the scope and methode of the ensuing treatises which the author thereof earnestly wishes may tend to thy profit that if thou be a new converted catholique thou mayst be co~firmed thereby in thy holy faith if one who

after many tossings in errors art seeking the truth thou mayst be assisted to find it where only it can be found if lastly thou be one who not through malice but through negligence or ignorance adheres vnto errors thou mayst be stirred vp to try them and to seek diligently the truth which is a work most worthy of thy paines
neither is it so hard as some do imagin to find the truth since god almighty according to his infinit goodnesse wisdom has prepared the way to heaven so much the more certain easy to be known how much more error and deceit in it brings greater losse with it and therefore he has promised so plain and direct a way vnto eternal happinesse that fooles may not erre by it

whence it is evident if thou seekest this way with diligence and after the right manner thou mayst have great confidence by gods grace to attayn vnto it
but then thou wilt seek it in the right way according to the advice of the glorious doctor augustin to his friend honoratus if thou dost vse fervent and frequent prayer

strivest to have peace and tranquillity of mind if thou wilt hear that church which god hath established on earth with so great authority and which is called catholique both by her own by strangers
for it is by authority only whereby men can come vnto the knowledge of divin truth and there is no authority equall vnto this wich began by miracles and is most famous for multltudes of peoples and nations and therefore if thou proceedest orderly at this authority

thou oughtest to begin as the same holy father affirmes
but if thou contemnest so great authority and only openest thy eares to the enemies and calumniators of so famous a society which has been also calumniated by all the former heretiques as well as by these of this age thou canst not be excused neither canst thou arrive vnto the possession of solid truth
therefore if thou be wise follow the former advice of augustin who was so wise so learned a doctor and who had such great knowledge and experience in this affaire
and if thou wouldest take a short and compendious way to come vnto the truth try only that one question of the church according to the marks abovementioned whereby it is clearly designed in scripture and thou wilt not only soone find that they cannot agree to thy new inconstant church but also thou wilt quickly see that they agree to the catholique church which has ever endured and against which hels gates could never prevaile and so with the true church thou wilt find truth because it is ever governed by the spirit of truth and is the pillar and ground of truth
this is the right manner for thee to attayn vnto the truth and to true to which that god almighty may direct and bring thee shall be earnestly desired by thy welwisher

that god by the confusion of errour stirres vp many to seek the truth
so great and admirable is the goodnesse of god that as augustin hath observed he would not permit sin to be in the world

vnlesse he did draw good from it and so infinit is his power ioyn'd with that goodnesse that from the worst and most wicked actions he can and doth extract the greatest goods
ioseph did acknowledge in himself the experience of this truth when he said to his brethren who had vnnaturally sold him you thought euil against me but god hath turn'd it vnto good that he might exalt me as you see this day and preserue much people
but this truth

is more admirably seen in that most horrible crime of the iewes of crucifying the lord of glory out of which god did extract the greatest of all goods to wit the exaltation of christ and the redemption of mankind

since then that heresy is confessed by all christians not only to be evill but one of the greatest evils as being the corruption of a most excellent good to witt the divine faith gods goodnesse would never permitt it to arise and for a tyme to continue against the true faith the holy church vnlesse he cowld and did make it tend to the good of both
paul toucheth this matter when he saith to the corinthians heresies must be that they which are approoved may be made manifest among you
that they must be proceeds by the permission of god from the vickednesse and free choise of man and from the malice of the devill whom our saviour calls the enemy

who sowes tares in the field where he had sowen the good seed
that heresies are turn'd into good proceeds from the goodnesse and special providence of god who of evil worketh good as he doth here making heresies tend to the manifestation of those who are approved and constant in the faith

but the providence and goodnesse of god is specially wonderfull in this matter that he doth not only draw good from heresy but also he makes it against its owne nature intent to serve for the further manifestation of the truth and he turn's all the plots and cunning design's of

the authours and promoovers of falshood to the ruine and confusion both of it and of themselves and to the exaltation of that whereof they intended so eagerly the destruction
this was evident of old in the arrians who vsed all slight and might to obscure and extinguish the great mystery of the holy trinity
but it did never shyne so brightly neither was it so fully discussed clearly vnderstood till the arrians begun to bark against it as augustin speaks

so that by the many fold grace of our saviour that which the enemy intends for hurt destruction god turn's into help and advantage

these things for the most part are now by the goodnesse of god become very evident in the scottish covenant and presbytery which prospered so much for a time and yet at leuth are come to nought notwithstanding all the wise deepe plots that were so subtilly deuised for the standing and aduancing of them and notwithstanding the great power of armies which did raise and vphold them in these nations and by which they should in a martial rather then apostolique manner haue been propagated troughout the world as the ministers some others fondly imagined but more foolishly bragged
the great covenanters also haue been much disappoynted and come short of their design's
there was nothing wherein they so much gloryed as in their prosperity and in the ruine which fell vpon all their opposers whereby they avowed publiquely

and frequently that their cause was clearly owned by heauen
all their discourses and sermons were nothing but panegyriques of that great ingyring light as they tearm'd it which god had made shyne to them above all other nations
they did bragge not a litle that they were gods covenanted people and he their covenanting god which high priviledge no nation else could claime
their wisdome in their counsels diligence in executions were highly esteem'd and much cry'd vp by many
there seem'd nothing in humane prudence fitting for the advancment of their cause but they try'd it and nothing could appeare a crosse and hinderance to their designs but they provyded for it
and yet notwithstanding all these pretended priuiledges exploits and diligences the covenanting presbyterians haue been brought to confusion their prosperity so much bragged of hath quickly turn'd into adversity and their self conceated wisdome

hath now appear'd to all men to be manifest folly
for god who takes wise in their own craftinesse and dissipats the counsels of the froward as it is in iob hath made that witty or crafty course which they took for their own standing tend to their ruine and hath caused their fall to proceed from those whom they least or in no wise suspected that is from their own covenanting and leagued brethren whom they had of purpose raised and vpholden to be a prop to themselues and a ruin to their enemies
and now is verifyed in them

that which paul foretold showld befall to all false teachers and seducers
they shall not long prevaile for their folly shall be made manifest to all men
yea it hath not only pleased god to bring the covenant and presbytery to such a stay and to frustrate the designs of their promoters but he who drawes good out of evil hath drawen this good from them amidst the many deplorable evils which they haue directly brought vpon this nation that many who were not sensible of the great errour wherein they were lying haue been awakned as it vere out of a dead sleep by the huge confusion of the covenant and presbytery and so seeing their own danger haue been stirred vp to seeing for the truth and to see the day of god as augustin speaks

amongst which number his vnspeakable goodnesse hath been pleased to make me one who by all apparance would haue liv'd and dyed in a grosse security of the religion wherein was bred if the covenant presbytery by their confusions changes and violence had not furiously endeavoured to dispossesse me of many points which formerly beleev'd as was taught for vndoubted truths and by that means pressed me to make an earnest search to informe my self of the true grounds of these alterations and to find some setled ground whereon might safely rely for the salvation of my soule and not be tossed to an fro with every wind of doctrine in the wickednesse of men and circumvention of errour

whilst there was nothing but some little jarres betwixt the bishops and a few ministers for conformity to the
articles of perth which concerned kneeling at communion privat baptisme confirmation of children observation of christmasse and of some few festival dayes was never moved to doubt of the religion publiquely professed
for these dissensions were not as conceaved in substantial points neither was the manner of them very vehement and rigorous by reason of the bishops temper who did not vrge these things violently though establish'd both by ecclesiastical and civil lawes
besid's the ministers who oppos'd them were but few and not considerable either for learning or prudence in regard of those who were of a contrary iudgement
all this time liv'd in a deepe security in an implicit faith of the church of of scotland and its doctrine imagining that it was the very same which was taught by christ and his apostles
but so soone as that great storme of the covenant did arise none got leave to sleep any longer at rest in that barke all were awakned by these unskilfull mariners to whom we had rashly trusted our soules who fell at such oddes and dissensions amongst themselv's that hardly ever such confusion and noise was heard or seen every one of them contradicting condemning and accursing another and making such factions that they seem'd to thirst after nothing but blood with which they may be sufficiently glutted since they begun
this

tempest and confusion hath brought such shipwracke vpon the church to speak nothing of the miseries of the countrey that many of sound iudgement seing the danger haue been mov'd to abandon that confus'd and sinking vessell and putt themselv's in one more solidly built and govern'd by more sober wise and discreet pilots
this confusion was the occasion of my first doubt which made me begin to examin the particular points of these new dissenssions and to try the ground whereon our religion so easily shaken was weakly founded
and finding that all was built vpon the sand made there after a diligent search to find out that true religion and holy church which christ the wise master builder had promised in the scriptures to build vpon a rocke which could not be shaken neither by the deceits of men nor by the power malice of the devil

having then after a serious equitable and zealous search of the truth found it by gods grace to be where the ministers clamours and my education made me least suspect it was and therefore being to abandon that religion and particular new inconstant confus'd church wherein was bred and to incorporat my self into the vniuersal ancient perpetual and invariable church protected alway's from heaven against the gates of hell thought fitting to to recollect the occasion and reasons of my happy change both for the contentment of my own mind that may briefly see what have

long and diligently sought after and for the satisfaction of others who perhaps may imagine had done rashly desiring earnestly god may be glorifyed in both
the reasons which mov'd me to think strange of our religion were these following all which saw with my eyes

the ministers inconstancy in doctrine

their dissensions
their contradicting their owne principales

their cruelty over mens consciences

disobedience to civil magistrats with a shew of godlinesse without any effect or truth of it
chap
ii
of the ministers inconstancy and of the alterations made by the late presbyterian reformation

there is hardly any thing that makes people to stumble more at religion then the often changing of it and nothing makes them more apprehensive of their pastours falshood then their levity and inconstancy in their doctrines and practises
for how can people think that religion true and solid which they see is never constant but is alway's changing like the moone and how can they but suspect their pastours to be false prophets whom they heare at diverse times teaching them contrary doctrines for it's evident by the light of reason that such lighsnesse and inconstancy especially

when it is accompayn'd with a proper condemnation of their own former doctrines and practises is a reall open confession of their former errours if not of formal deceit's
and therefore it shewes them to be either deceitfull or at least blind guides to neither of which can people either prudently or safely intrust their soules
if such wandering and erring guides after some experience had of them would not be followed nor trusted in earthly voyages how much lesse are these to be followed or trusted in our voyage to heaven which is of greater concernment

as lightnesse and inconstancy are farre from the office of true apostles so they are alwayes proper to false teachers and prophets
paul writing to the corinthians freeth himself and other true pastours from such imputations
did vse saith he lightnesse or was my preaching it is and it is not for the son of god iesus christ who was preached by vs among you by me and sylvanus and timothee was not it is and it is not but
it is was in him
but vpon the other part the same paul writing to timothee shewes that all false teachers are light and inco~stant
evil men

saith he and seducers prosper to the worse erring driving into errour
this is the worst most deplorable kinde of inconstancy which proceeds from evil to worse which is too evident in the presbyterians who haue abrogated condemned and deformed many things which their first reformers had left vntouched allowed and practised as shall be presently seen
for

vnder vaine imagination of a new reformation they haue gone further from the truth and vnder pretext of attayning greater purity they have plung'd themselves more deeply into the puddle of errour

first then they changed the governement of the church by bishops which had continued a good time and was established both by civil and ecclesiastique lawes yea they did not only change and abrogate the governement of bishops but they condemned also their very office as vnlawfull and antichristian and forced others to swear and subscribe to their sentence
and in place of episcopacy they brought in a parity of ministers and a forme of discipline which they call presbytery declaring that this was the only governement conforme to the word of god and which christ had ordain'd for his church to which sentence also all behoved to sweare and therefore to the two marks of the church ordinarly assign'd by protestants the presbyterians ioyn'd their discipline as the third whereby they declared that all protestant churches which wanted this governement were not true or at least pure churches of christ
so that they made their presbyterian discipline a substantial point of doctrine the contrary whereof was taught believed and practised in the bishops time in the isle of britaine and in all places where the lutheran protestants lives
and what ever was the practise of the french calvinists yet they did not definitiu'ly declare the office of bishop

to be antichristian but kept society with these protestant churches where episcopal governement was established and wrote most respectiv'ly vnto the bishops themselves as may be seen in the survey of the new discipline

secondly
after the change and abolition of the old governement of the church they proceeded next to abolish all sett prayers all the orders and directions which were ordain'd by knox the first fundatour or reformer of this church for administration of the sacraments and of mariage yea all sett formes of prayer were disallowed and cancelled vpon pretext that they nourished tepidity and smoothered the fervour of the spirit according to which all persons were ordain'd to pray albeit oftentymes it prov'd the spirit of giddinesse as appear'd by their frequent tautologies and bablings
but it had not been so much matter for abrogating mr knox his prayers if they had not been too bold with the most excellent of all prayers made by our saviour himself and recommended by him to all christians
for although the ministers were accustomed before to end their imperfect prayers as they spoke in that most perfect forme of prayer made by christ which was also the practise of their first reformers

as may be seen in knox chronicle at the conclusion of the prayer for a benediction to the superintendent yet it was left off any more to be said by these new presbyterian reformers the rest of the brethren thought it most secure for their own

own standing to follow their leaders
albeit they cashiered all other sett prayers yet they might have excepted this both for the excellenty of it and the dignity of the authour
they indeed spoke nothing publickely and directly against it till one of their prime apostles did not stick to call the frequent vse of it most irreverently a papistical charme
thirdly they changed not only the prayers but also the manner of singing psalmes for they tooke away and abolished the hymne of glory to the father and to the son with which the psalme was ordinarly concluded according to the custome which was kept from the beginning of the reformation
this was not done by any formal act but as a minister spoke by a desuetude of the principal covenanters whose example the rest of the ministers followed
but there was one thing which hapned in this matter not vnworthy of remark and is very famous throughout the countrey for whilst the people of a parish in anguse were singing at the conclusion of a psalme glory to the father and to the son as not knowing of the new alterations they were presently interrupted by their minister who cry'd aloud no more glory to the father no more glory which accident rendred the presbyterians very ridiculous to the old protestants

fourthly they proceeded further and strook at the roote of the christian faith to witt the apostles creed denying it to be apostolicall the contrairy whereof we was taught in our

yonger yeares as was believed troughout the whole christian world
and after they had thus denyed the letter and authority of it they proceeded next to corrupt the sense of that article he descended into hell as we shall see shortly
their inconstancy and changes may be instanced in diverse other points and practises as in their taking the communion sitting and condemning kneeling as vnlawfull
their deuiding of the bread among themselues wherein they place no small purity of their religion and not taking it out of the ministers hand as the custome was before
their condemning private co~munion and private baptisme although administrated vpon extream necessity which found to be pernicious errours especially in so far as concern's baptisme
their condemning as superstitious the religious observation of christmasse and of all other festival dayes
all which are not only contrary to the doctrine of the most famous protestant churches abroad but also were contrary to the doctrine lawes practises of this church at home
by which inconstancy of the ministers and the alterations made by the the people was not only miserably tossed to and fro and carried about with violent winds of new doctrines but also they knew not what to believe and almost loos'd all belief since they saw that many points which they believ'd before being taught them by their own pastours were now condemned by the same pastours who are very like vnto these whom the apostle iude calls wandering starres

hauing thought seriously vpon these things made this reflection with my self
how can this scottish church which changeth like the moone and is as vnstedfast as the wind be the true church of christ which must be firme and stedfast as a rocke how can these ministers who drawes yea driwes the people into such varieties of faith

be the true apostles of christ seing they were established as paul testifies to conserve the people into the vnity of faith they must be false pastours who do tosse the people to and fro with the inconstant winds of their new doctrines since true pastours were ordain'd by christ to keep the people into the constant profession of the old doctrin which was once delivered and generally professed throughout the world and to preserve them from such tossings
as the scripture sheweth that inconstancy and lightnesse belongs to false teachers so found that the holy fathers did observe it by experience

ireneus saith they delight to find out every day some new thing
let vs now see their inconstant doctrin
but
hiero most pithily describs their humour
the feet saith he of those who erre are alway's wavering neither are the footsteps sure which are against the truth but they run here and there and are caried about with euery wind of new doctrin whilst they passe from one falshood into another falshood
therefore seeing the great inconstancy and changes of the scottish church desired to find out a more constant and skifull guide to rely vpon to lead me vnto the kingdome of heauen
chap
iii
of the ministers dissensions and divisions
as the inconstancy of a church in faith and doctrine gives iust occasion to many of doubting and stumbling at it's religion so dissensions and divisions which necessarly flow from such inconstancy are no lesse but rather more sensible evils and gives greater and more vniuersal scandals
for there are many who would take no notice of inconstancy and yet are awakned by the confusion that ever attends dissension and division

it's evident by the light of reason that nothing becomes more the house of god then vnity and order and that confusion and dissension are only fitting for babel or the house of the devil and as vnity tends to preservation so dissension hastens to destruction
therefore our saviour being to found his church which was to be a heavenly house vpon earth of admirable order and to stand for ever did pray most earnestly for the vnity of it

by which he knew it would be both beautifyed and conserved
yea he sheweth that by the admirable vnity of his church the world showld know

that he was sent from heaven and be made to believe in him
therefore these churches which haue no vnity but are torne by dissensions and divisions cannot be the true church of christ neither can they long laste
as vnity doth designe

beautifie and conserve the true church so dissension points out deformes and ever at lenth destroies all false churches
our saviour saith every kingdome divided against it self shall be made desolate
and paul if yow bite and eate one an other take heede you be not consumed one of an other
and that this division and destruction befalls to all false churches luther himself doth testifie
a kingdome saith he divided in it self cannot stand neither did heretiques at any tyme perish by force or art but by their owne mutuall dissensions neither doth christ our lord fight against them by other armes then by sending among them the spirit of giddinesse and dissension

now what miserable dissensions have happened these yeares by past into the church of scotland by which it hath been much deformed and a considerable part of it destroyed are knowen far and neare at home and abroad
for these dissentious haue been for matter manner and the miserable effects that have flowed from them very remarkable
the matter of them concern'd no lesse points then the governement of the church established by christ the authority of the apostles creed the vse of the sacraments of private baptisme and communion the vse of our lords prayer and of glory to the father the keeping of holy dayes and the rest of the articles of perth the covenant it self the heade spring of all dissensions and the authority of the civil magistrate
but the forme and manner of these dissensions

hath overcome the matter for it hath been so great and confus'd that it turned the eyes of all the world to looke vpon that strange and bloody theater which was thereby erected in great britaine and to take special notice of the diverse representations made vpon it
all hath been done on each side that tongues and hands could do to defame and destroy one an other
three famous kingdomes have been thereby miserably embroyl'd in shedding their owne blood and brought to horrible confusion
and besids the alterations that have happened in the state these dissensions haue made great desolation and destruction in the church
for the presbyterians by their strong assaults have destroyed the late english episcopal church which was esteem'd so glorious and the independents againe who sprung vp from the presbyterians have by their strong oppositions to presbytery

much weakned it and taken the power of stinging from that snake as the christian moderatour calls it

moreover the presbyterians so soone as they had perfected their work of destroying the church of the old protestants fell presently into dissensions among themselves which were atte~ded by divisio~s whereby they are now cut into small pieces
the first dissension appeared when some of the most able ministers among them opposed the vnexpected reformation that is the abolishing of the hymne of glory to the father and takeing away the vse of our

lords prayer and such other innovations for which opposition covered with other pretexts these ministers were deposed
then in the last nationall assembly at andrew's in the yeare
there appear'd a new sect which of presbyterian protestants became presbyterian protestatours protesting against the authority of that assembly
this protestation hath made great division amongst them so that the two factions will hardly sit together in synods but keeps their conventions a part
diverse bitter invectiues have past since that time betwixt these two parties but the civil power is so strong and provident that it keeps them from biting one another
now lately againe new divisions have risen
for some of the chief protestatours have abandonned altogether presbyt'ry and covenant as humane inventions although before they preached and cryed them vp as divine and cleare truths and have rendered themselves independents
and some of these after a little pause in independency that they may attayne yet to a greater purity which they imagin doth consist in going further from popery are become anabaptists

but among all these changelings there are two ministers in the north most famous because one of them was esteemed very learned and both of them were very zealous covenanting presbyterians who by word and work violently forced others to be like to themselves
they commonly styl'd the independents erronious sectarians periur'd persons and

any word spoke against the covenant or presbytery was called by them horrible blasphemy
and yet shortly after the independents became maisters they begun to extoll highly a new light that had appeared vnto them and on a suddaine they quitted both covenant and presbytery as humane inventions and became independents
this change so vnexpected was the cause of much admiration to many and of many observations but this which heard a friend make before some company seem'd to me most remarkable
either said he these ministers were ignorant before their cha~ge of the falshood which they now acknowledge in the covenant and presbytery or they were not ignorant but knew the falshood of the if they where ignorant then they were scarcely worthy to be ministers much lesse to be esteemed of so great learning as one of them was reputed heretofore and both are now declared to be by their new preferments to the highest places of dignity and learning that can be had in a colledge or an vniversity
were these men maisters in israel and yet vere ignorant of a question that had been so long in agitation for which there had been so much trouble and bloodshed did they not know so much as what governement christ had established in his church if they were ignorant of the falshood which they now acknowledge to be in the covenant and presbytery then in the time of their ignorance they could have no cleare and certaine knowledge of the

truth of them how then could they be so vnreasonable as to preach and cry vp these shings as divin truths and cleare engyring lights yea how could they be so cruel as to persecute and force others making them swear these things to be divin truths whereof themselves had no certaine knowledge and which now they condemne as grosse falshoods and humane inventions

our saviour saith if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch
these men did not only blindly lead but they did also furiously drive both the seeing and the blind into the dirch
if it be said that they were not ignorant but knew well enough the falshood of the presbyterian covenanting way which they followed and yeelded to the times for some wordly respects then they fall into a worse inconveniency then before
for by that means they would be guilty of most deepe and damnable hypocrisy since they had not only professed and practized such things as were directly against their owne conscience but also fotced many others to doe the same with oathes against their consciences
thus he
for my part do not know how to free these ministers of one of these imputations
and many thinks it probable that this new light would never have clear'd the eyes of their minds if the light of some temporall interest had not first illuminated the eyes of their bodies

shortly after this separation there arose scandalous dissensions betwixt an old apostle of the covenant and one of these new independents

who had agreed before like simeon and levi to do hurt
for neare the space of a yeare their sermons preached in the same church were nothing but continual contradictions railings and scoffings at one another
what was said by the one in thefore noone was co~trould out of the same pulpit by the other in the
the presbyterian did bend all his wits to prove that presbytery was iure diuino
and the new convert would neither have it to be good nor expedient iure humano
yea sometymes they would choose the same text and in the same church before the same auditory they would with contentious zeal deduce contradictory conclusions as out of this text holynesse becometh thy house lord the new independent did amply inferre that none ought to be acknowledged members of the church except those who were visible saints and from the same text the old presbyterian did strive to shew that in the church there was both chaffe and wheate the evill mixed with the good
some of the people tooke great scandall and others especially the old episcopal protestants made good sport of these dissensions
and although by intercession of some friends an agreement was made at last betwixt these two ministers to make them abstaine from their publique and scandalous contradictions yet that concord did not laste long their inward fire did shortly burst forth
for one day after sermon the independent inviting the people to his communion
which he was to give the next sunday

he was publickly interrupted by the presbyterian who accused him of apostasy from the covenant and presbytery and straitly charged the people to receive no communion from him and with this confusion the meeting ended but the ministers bauling continued a space thereafter
the event did shew that the presbyterian got the better of this conflict for the other did not appeare at the day appoynted to give the communion as he had promised
yet the fulnesse of the presbyterians victory was much diminished by reason the others place was supplyed by his colleague who besids others had both the presbyterians daughter and for two of his communicants

conceived that all these dissensions and divisions did fall forth by divin providence to give people sufficient notice that a church of so great confusion cannot be the true church of christ which ought to be a house of great order and vnity and to shew that these ministers who are the rulers or rather of such a confus'd church and who bragge so much of the spirit are not led by the spirit of god which is not contrary to himsef· but by the spirit of errour and giddinesse
and although sometymes the ministers to cover the vgly deformity and great scandals of all their dissensions would pretend that their differences were not in fundamentall points yet at other times their words did varie and their actions contradicted ever their words
for they changed their tongue as the diversity of questions

did trouble them or the interest of their cause did presse them
when they were not vrged with their dissensions then they cry'd vp presbytery as the only scepter of christ the only governement of the church iure divino the only means to vphold christs kingdome and to hold out the wild boare of
it's well knowen also how necessary and fundamentall a point the covenant was esteem'd and how the ministers put it very neare in ballance with the booke of life
but their actions did shew more sensibly then their words that they esteem'd their dissensions to be in substantiall and fundamentall matters
or else they have been voyde not only of christian charity but also of humane discretion
for how could they haue embroyl'd all these kingdomes into so great confusion and bloodshed for such matters as themselves esteem'd only circumstantiall and not substantiall how could they with any discretion force these points of their now reformation which they thought only ceremoniall and not substantiall so furiously and substantially vpon others

but whither their differences were in fundamentals or not for the matter it's euident that they were substantiall and fundamentall for the manner to the substantiall destruction of one and other and almost to the fundamentall subversion of three kinhdomes
yea found that the presbyterians in queen elizabeth and king iames time were more ingenuous and confessed freely that their differences

from the english church were in weighty and substantiall matters
for thus they speake in rogers
the controuersy betwixt them and vs is not as the bishops and their favourers would deceive the world concerning corner capes surplices but of more weighty matters as of the true ministery the governement of the church
and againe wee contend with the formalists whither iesus christ ought to raigne
in this cause we ought so to oppose ever the conformists that if we had as many lives as we have haires we ought rather to loose them all then to leave off our enterprise
vpon the other part the english church or the old protestants do acknowledge that they differ substantially from the presbyterians

this doctour covel plainly protesteth in all their names
least any man saith he should thinke our contentions with puritans were in smaller points and difference not great each side hath charged one the other with heresies if not infidelities yea euen with such as quite owerthrow the principall foundation of our christian faith
and albeit they would not confesse their differences to be in fundamentalls yet it is evident they are so
for what is more fundamentall to a church then the gouernement established by christ what is more fundamentall then the foundation of faith to wit the apostles creed what more fundamentall then the sacraments of the church and the lords prayer and in all these they have tragicall differences besids in many other points no lesse substantiall although not so

sensible as in predestination and reprobation vniversall grace whether god absolutly decerns or only permits sin whether the sacraments confers grace whither christs body be really present in the eucharist whither christ redeem'd the world by shedding his blood and corporall death or by suffering in his soule the paines of hell whither man after the fall hath free will and many more which may be seen collected in the protestants apology

in all which the old protestants and the presbyterians do teach ooposite doctrines and accuse others of grosse errours and sometymes of blasphemies

having then diligently considered these things made this reflection with my self
how can this scottish church which is like a babel of confusion be the true church of christ which for order and vnity ought to be like to the heauenly ierusalem how can that church which is the vnhappy roote of so much dissension and division be the church of christ which is no lesse the roote of vnity then it is the pillar and ground of verity see that ever one sect begets an other which not only divids but strives also like vipers brood to destroy the former
such confusion and dissension becomes not the church of christ but are more proper for the synagogue of
if the true church may be knowen by her vnity then the false church is no lesse but more easily discerned by its dissension

our saviour saith of all false prophets who appeares

at first in sheeps raiment you shall know them by their fruits

and augustin sheweth that their fruits are dissensions
we sought saith he among them the fruits of charity and we find the thornes of dissension
if therefore we observe our saviours rule and iudge the ministers by their fruites we will soone find them not to be true prophets and their church wherein their is such dissension not to be the true church of christ but rather a babel of confusion
therefore will endeavour by gods assistance to seek out a church which hath not only constancy but also order and vnity that becomes the house of god
chap
iv
of the presbyterians rigour and tyranny over protestants

mercy and truth do ordinarly goe together and it's a great signe that these haue no truth who shew no mercy
salomon giv's good advise to keepe both together let not mercy and truth

saith he leave thee put them about thy neck and write them vpon the tables of thy heart
the covenanters did not follow this sound counsel for albeit they profess'd much truth and purity yet they shew little christian meeknesse and mercy which made many grossely to suspect that they had nothing but a pretext of truth
they complain'd much of hard vsage vnder the bishops and

cry'd for compassion of tender consciences and who would haue expected hard vsage from such men or that they would have strain'd other mens consciences who would not suffer their own to be touch'd if they ould not attaine vnto some degree of christian perfection in meeknesse mercy they might at least have practised a moral vertue not to do that vnto others which they would not wish to be done to themselv's

at the beginning of the covenant in the yeare
the presbyterians appear'd first like lambs for they vsed nothing but milde invitations and many plausible words to induce men to renew as they spoke the national covenant with god the breach of which was the cause of all miseries and the keeping of it would be the source of all happinesse
this was the only means to divert gods imminent iudgement to conserve purity and hold away popery
and according to this milde tenour commissioners and ministers were sent to all parts of the countrey to draw the hearts and hands of all men to the covenant
all this time they profess'd that they would vrge or force no man against his conscience but shortly after they had by these faire mean's got their number and power encreas'd they chang'd their tunes they left off entreaties and procceded to threatnings and from these they went to their ecclesiastical censures to deprivation of ministers excommunications to plundering and sacking of mens houses sequestrating their

estates imprisoning their person's and persecuting all the old protestants whose consciences ty'd them to live conforme to the law's of church and state not as yet abrogated
the presbyterian ministers tongues were sharped like two edged swords cutting in pieces all mens honour reputation and honesty who dissented from them although never so inoffensively and they never ceased by their continuall clamours to whet the material sword against them
so that albeit they begun with iacobs voice yet they ended with esaus handes they appear'd first like lambs but their ravenous nature did soone shew that they were only covered with


their spiritual tyranny over mens consciences was very great for they were not content with obedience to their doctrin and new orders which almost all protestants would have given retaining only an internall liberty according to the light of their minds not to condemne the former governement doctrines practises as in themselv's vnlawful against gods word
but the presbyterians requyred all men to sweare that they thought belieued presbyterian doctrin and disciplin to be only lawfull according to gods word and the contrary of episcopacy and the other points which they had condemned to be false and erronious which was to force men to sin by making them not only do but also sweare things that were directly against the light of their consciences which is the highest degree of

of soule tyranny
yea the presbyterians rigour and cruelty was not only great but also vniversal for none of whatsoeuer condition or quality could be free of it
although at the beginning men were only admitted to subscribe the covenant yet shortly thereafter the more zealous sisters obtain'd that fauour and others who were not seeking that curtesie got it press'd vpon them
at lenth it came to children at schoole to seruants young maides and all sort's of persons without exception
and these who could not write their owne names into the covenant behoved to do it by a publick notary so that they would haue none to be left out of gods covenant and the covenant of grace as they spoke
the ministers who did not conforme themselv's to these new orders were presently render'd odious by the name of papists and by populare tumults rais'd against them were forced to leave the countrey
and many others who swore all that the presbyterians could require yet because they did not seem to be zealous enough in the cause were deposed and they with their wives aad children exposed without compassion to great want and misery
then for the lay protestants these among them who could not be drawen on by the ministers faire words threatnings nor censures were driven to obedience by ministerial armies which consisted principally at the beginning of highlanders whom the old protestants call'd argyle apostles who by their sakeing and burning of some

good houses converted more to the covenant then the ministers had done
for diverse persons of quality were imprisoned and fyned till affliction gave them vnderstanding and made their wills plyable to accept and sweare the new reformation whose example many others followed
moreover the presbyterians press'd all noblemen and barons to receive into their houses chaplaines of their choosing or approving to say vnto them extemporary prayers
but one of their employments and that not the least was to observe what they heard or saw spoken or done against presbyt'ry and the blissed work of reformation as they call'd it and to make a true relation of all their observations to the presbyt'ry vpon which depended their preferment to a church
and when any of these chaplains seem'd not to be faithfull enough in giving these relations the presbyt'ry would sometimes summon other servants to depose vpon oath what they knew spoke or done in the family against presbyt'ry which being rightly considered was no small trouble to these persons who could nor be free of presbyterian tyranny within their owne private families in many whereof the presbyterians would have rais'd vp more then one iudas

the rigour and tyranny of presbyterians was not only spiritual over mens consciences but it was also temporal over mens estates and persons
for besids the grosses fines which

they imposed vpon those who could not get implicit faith soone enough to heare beleeve them they made a general misery to overflow the whole countrey by their new inventions to maintaine and advance their plots and design's as by their leavie money lone money monthly maintenance blind bonds and diverse others
their souldiours who were ordinarly styled saints were very vnruly and insatiably avaritious so that they proved sore saints to many whereof the north of england had some experience
then the presbyterians severity over all their opposers became so well knowen that none expected favour who fell into there hands
the ministers cry'd alway's for iustice to divert from the land as they gave out gods iudgements
it would be tedious to relate all the particulars that have past of their severity
that alone which they vs'd against the lord montrose and his fellow captives made their temper sufficiently knowen to all europe
for although they coul'd not have been much blam'd supposing their principles for removing out of the way such an active enemy yet the manner of it shew too great passion and cruelty
some respect might have been had to his ancient nobility to his personall gallantry and many worthy parts but especially to his admirable clemency show'd to his enemies after many notable victories obtayn'd over them
but notwithstanding all these respects when he fell into the presbyterians hands they were not content to put

him symply to death vnlesse they satisfyed their passion by putting disgraces vpon him
for they brought him vp the high street of edim borough bound with ropes to a chaire in a carte bareheaded the common executioner riding in livery covered before him which spectacle was so cruel and lamentable that it wrested teares from many of his enemies
this was the triumphal entrie he got into that cittie which was in his power after the battall of kilsyth to have burn't and sack'd but of his innate clemency did spare it
and within two or three dayes after this solemne entrie they caused him not only to be hang'd but also to be dismembred and quartered ordaining his head legges and armes to be affix't in the principal townes of the countrey and the trunck of his body to be buryed vnder the common gallowes
and all this was done by expresse order of the presbyterians who excluded all other from having voices in parliament
that scaffold which was erected at the crosse of edimborough for the execution of montrose did remaine vnremoved about the space of two months conrrarie to all former custome vpon which every week the presbyterians offered vp diverse sacrifices of gallant and worthy men so that it became a heape of blood and therefore it was called by many of the people the ministers altar who as they alleadged delights not in vnbloody sacrifices
yea some of the ministers hatred against montrose was so great that it did not

end with his death but pursued his memory after death calling him publickly a periur'd traytor a dogge the malignants god with many such vncivil epithets
then they bragged who durst any more oppose them or set their faces against them that god had now own'd their cause and had brought their greatest enemy's to confusion as they had often prophecy'd for which ever thereafter they ought to be beleev'd
but all the severity and rigour that had past was nothing to that which many wise men foresaw was approaching if the reigne of presbyt'ry had endured longer
before montrose death the presbyterians were not free of feares and were not fully masters but shortly after getting home the king whom they made to subscryb and swear their covenant and solemne league and to confirme all their proceedings they had higher design's
but as the christian moderatour hath observed their fall was nearer then they expected and the hand of god stop't them in their full carriere so that they were not only rendered vnable to do more hurt which they intended but also they were happily hind'red from doing any more that which they practised at least in their accustomed rigour

these obvious considerations made the rigour and severity of presbyt'ry appeare to be very tyrannous vnto me
for thereby saw that it was both spiritual and temporal and extended to the soules and bodies lives and estates yea and to the very memories of men

after their death and that for pretext of religion to protestants whom sometimes they acknowledge to be of their owne religion
and therefore made this reflection with my self
how can this presbyterian church have christian truth and purity since it's so voyd of christian meeknesse mercy how can these presbyterian ministers be christs true disciples

since they do not learne nor practise his lessons christ saith learne of me for am meek and humble of heart
they learne this lesson backward for they shew no meeknesse nor humility but rather the contrary all pride and cruelty
our saviour saith to his disciples love your enemies

the presbyterians hates and persecut's their friends their owne brethren protestants
truly cannot think there can be much truth among presbyterians where there is so little mercy
they would have done well to have ioyn'd these two together vsed salomons wise advise let not mercy and truth leave thee and then perhaps they had found more credit
chap
of the presbyterians contradicting their owne principles

trvth is alway's consonant to it self
wise men do not fall into manifest contradictions and good men do not practise these things which they blame and condemne in

others
now in many things the presbyterians appear'd to me to contradict their owne principles in deeds and words whereby they bewray'd the vanity of their faire pretexts and shew that some of their principles were so false that themselv's were forced to goe often against them and controwle them


this appeared in their pretext of tender consciences which truly and many others beleeved they for the most part had till they tooke the power of ruling or rather domineering over other mens consciences
but as it is in the proverbe magistratus indicat virum
many seeme good so long as they have no power to do evil
the presbyterians tendernesse of conscience was most esteem'd when it was least knowen but so soone as it was brought to the light it lost more credit then they acquyred power
when the prime ringleaders of this mad presbyterian dance were vrged to conformity in the bishops time
then they cry'd vp their tender consciences they could not so much as cary a cassocke nor make a sermon on christmasse in remembrance of christs nativity nor baptize a child privat'ly although at the point of death their tender consciences could not digest such hard meates they would stand to the purity of their reformation which had abandonned all such superstitions
but after they became masters they seem'd to swallow downe some more grosse morsels and for all the pretended purity of their first reformation they would yet

reforme and purify it more
for then they digested the denying of the apostles creed the abrogating the hymne of glory to the father the forbearing of saying our lords prayer all which were practised by their first reformers besids the many terrible oaths of the covenant and their obedience sworne to their superiours civil and ecclesiastical all which and many more they swallowed downe without the least trouble of their consciences
now how can such men be iustly thought to have tender consciences who started so at straw's and leap't over mountains who are like those of whom our saviour saith they straine a gnat and swallow a camel


as they pretended much tendernesse of conscience in time of their subiection so they cry'd then much for compassion which almost they all found
for it cannot be denyed that the scottish bishops vsed no great severity against them but gave to those who were in possession of churches and to all laiques wharsoever full power of enioying both internal externall inoffensive liberty of their consciences
but so soone as the presbyterians had vnhorsed the bishops and got vpon their saddle they rul'd the raines and vs'd their spurres in a more manner
let men cry never so much mercy and compassion the presbyterians would shew none
neither would simple obedience content them oaths were also required not only to make men obey but to swear themselv's out of their consciences
apparantly

the presbyterians thought no others besids themselvs had conscience which is no smal signe that they had not much but whither they had or had not it was evident they had no compassion
the old protestants were long vnder the presbyterian rod and it was preparing also for the independents anabaptists and other new sorts of protestants who are permitted to serve god in their owne gospel way
the rod had some mercy for it happily broke in the presbyterians hand which had none
in this the presbyterians caried themselves very irrationally that in their subiection they would have and found also compassion from others but in their exaltation they would shew no compassion to them


they inveighed most sharply against the bishops for medling in civil and state affaires as vnbeseeming ecclesiastical persons and yet the presbyterian ministers did meddle much more in them then ever the bishops had done but with this difference that the bishops as lords of councel and parliament had the freedom of their voices with the rest but could not carrie any businesse vnlesse the consent of the temporal estate did concurre with them neither could they hinder any affaire which the most voices caried
the presbyterian ministers did not indeed sit in councel or parliament but they sat in another iudicatory which made it self superiour to both and drew all weighty affaires to it's cognizance for although the councel or parliament

concluded any thing in state affaires it was not to be obeyed vnlesse the presbyterian commission of the church had given consent without danger of their thundering censures as was evident in the matter of the ingagement after the bad successe whereof they entered into peaceable possession of superiority both over covncel and parliament
for all things were sent to the commission of the church with submission to their approbation or reprobation
by them the malignants were purged out of the army of the saints and when that army had bad successe at dumbar they were againe by them admitted
which bred a great rent among the ministers for being so inconstant in their principles


they accused the bishops of tyranny and domineering over the lords inheritance and yet themselves became more guilty of these vices as may appeare to any man who will compare together their deportments
yea such a huge difference will be seen that the bishops fault in regard of theirs will appear but like a mote to a mountaine
the bishops in the space of
yeares scarcely deposed foure ministers and that not for following inoffensively the liberty of their consciences but for their inordinate zeal and bitter invectives
the presbyterians in lesse then the fourth part of that time have deposed some hundreds many of which had never spoken against them
then the bishops troubled no laicks carying themselves peaceably neither did they impose any

oaths vpon them but the presbyterians troubled all conditions and qualities in a most rigourous manner with fearfull oaths which to many as being against their consciences were flat periuries


if we reflect a little vpon pride which the presbyterians did so much condemn in the bishops and iudge by the effects since god alone knowes the hearts the presbyterians seem's to have out strip't the prelats both in words and actions
for it hath appeared as an inseparable property in the ministers of the presbytery especially of the rightest stamp and deepest graine to make their owne will not only a rule for themseves but also a law to others and that without controll which is the highest point of pride
their proud contemning words vttered publlckly agrinst persons of greatest quality are well because they are yet fresh in mens memories
their proud cariage may be knowen by this alone that they made the greatest noblemen of the kingdome not only do publick pennance in sackcloth before the people in the church for their opposing the orders of presbytery but also they behooved to petition in that five or six ministers sitting in the presbytery and so often as they were called so often they were to appeare before that high iudicatory in their penitential habit
and thus after a great deal of ceremony as if it had been a great curtesie they would at lenth be admitted to take the covenant and with

most terrible oaths and holding vp of hands permitted to swear obedience vnto the presbytery
and although all this odedience was knowen to many and to the ministers themselves to be more external then internal more for worldly then spiritual ends to be free of the presbytery's vexations yet the ministers stood not so much for the heart they were satisfyed if this external adoration was giuen by men of greatest quality vnto their soveraigne tribunal
for then they bragged that none thereafter durst stand out any more against them
the cedars were made to bow and the shrubs might be affray'd to be broke
an officer of the english army observed some traces of this pride to be yet remaining even in the presbyteries subiection
for in a letter dated from edinburgh in februarie
and cited in the christian moderatour he writ's thus to a friend
yow would wonder to observe the strange pride and proceedings of the
and in an other letter dated in april

he makes this observation
beleeve it all our other enemies are tame heasts to the high presbyter and yet with the winding and turning of a religious pretence and an artificial zeal against heresie he will like a tame snake if not warily avoyded get into your bosome if this ingenious officer observ'd so much when he saw presbyt'ry in its declination what would he have observ'd and said if he had seen it in the hight of it's elevation have knowen some moderat presbyterian ministers wish that the presbytery

had not caried thinge with such extremity of rigour and so high a hand
for indeed it was not convenient that these who condemned pride in others should exercise much more themselves

they professe that every particular church is fallible and so consequently their owne as their frequent changes and manifest experience do shew
therefore iudged they did very inconsequentially in exacting so rigorously an vndeniable obedience with oaths to a fallible and perhaps an actually erring church with which yow must wheele about againe when it wheels and turn with it as a with the wind
yow must swear this yeare that to be true which peradventure the next yeare the same exactours vpon pretence of new lights will have yow swear to be false


they inveigh often against implicit faith as popish and and yet themselues practise it in a most grosse manner and very inconsequentially
that they practise it is manifest
for who among the people hath expresse knowledge of all points of the covenant and of their new confession and yet they are made to abiure all the points of the one and to believe all the articles of the other
yea it's knowen by experience that few of the ministers themselves know all the points abiured in the covenant as opus operatum stations and the like and yet all are abiured
therefore they practise in deeds what they renounce

in words and they do the same thing which they iudge and condemn in others
yea it is considerable that they do not only goe against their principle but also they abuse implicit faith in such a grosse and irrational manner as cannot be imputed vnto the roman catholiques
for these beleeving explicity their church to be infallible and to be continually assisted by the holy ghost conforme to this principle do most rationally to believe implicitly all points which the same church teaches and believes iust as a protestant believing explicity the scripture to be gods word although he doth not know expresly all the sentences and verses in it yet with great reason he believeth implicity all to be true and reveal'd by god which is contayn'd in it
but the presbyterian church being fallible and professing it self to be so requires very irrationally an implicit faith to all her doctrine whereof a man can prudently believe no more then he sees and knowes
moreover the presbyterians haue fallen into a third more grosse and inconsequentiall errour concerning this implicit faith
fore they haue forced many not only to swear and subscrive such things whereof they were ignorant but also such things which the presbyterians themselves knew to be against the expresse knowledge and consciences of the swearers and subscrybers which is to force men to sin as is evident out of the to the romans
this is a rare kinde of implicit faith which can consist with explicit

beleef of the contrary
heard from a person worthy of credit that when this inconvenience was proposed to a prime apostle of the covenant how many were driwen to periury by swearing against their consciences he answered
that it was all one to him let them looke to it
and vpon an other occasion he said to a roman catholique who after great trouble offered at lenth to take the covenant if thou be not sincere shall make thee damn thy owne soule

they appeared also vnto me to goe clearly against an other principle of theirs to witt that the scripture is the only iudge of controversy
and yet the presbytery did make it self only iudge
and after it pronounced sentence all were obliged yea and forced to give obedience albeit many could not find their doctrinal decisions in the scriptures
but found that the simple truth was they gave the scripture the only name of a iudge and keep't all power of iudging to themselves iust as they did with the king to whom they gave a bare empty title but keep't to themselves the reall possession and exercise of all royall power and authority

lastly they seem'd to overshoote themselves very much when not long before the battel of dumbar they made their solemn appeale to god for decyding the iustnesse of either cause by the victory that was to ensue whereof they thought themselves very certaine as indeed they had great probability

the english army notwithstanding many disavantages wherewith they were prest accepts the appeale and makes also their recourse to god after the same manner
and at lenth the question being decyded in favour of the english when the most eminent person of that army put the ministers in mind of their solemn appeale and how god had pronounced sentence against them he received this answer
you must not iudge the goodnesse of a cause by the event
which words vere very inconsequentiall to their appeale and in which absurdity they had not fallen if the victory had be fallen to them
many ministers since that time have blam'd the rashnesse of that appeale as being grounded more vpon humane confidence then any divin assurance

by these considerations discovered clearly the vanity of the presbyterians many faire pretences and how their deeds contradicted their words how themselves did the same things which they condemned in others and how their principles were so false that themselves behooved to controull them
they pretended great tendernesse of consciences when they were servants but shew strong consciences when they were masters
they cry'd much for compassion in their subiection but would shew none in their exaltation
they condemn'd the bishops for medling in civil affaires and yet their ministers did rule the affaires of state
they accused others of pride and tyranny and yet their owne little fingers have been more

heavy then the others loines and they have shewed more pride and contempt of others in one yeare then these whom they accuse had done in forty
they professe themselves to be fallible in faith and yet they will be infallibly believed and vndeniably obeyed
they renounce implicit faith and yet they practise it and in a most grosse and vnreasonable sense exacts it
they pretend the scripture to be the only iudge of controversies and yet they will take all power of iudging to themselves
they will be esteem'd true prophets when they guesse right and they will not have themselves thought false prophets when they divin wrong
they would have their cause esteem'd good for it's prosperity and they will not have it thought evil when it fall's into adversity
in a word their doctrin's and practises were so full of contradictions that found many of them not only to be humane but also false inventions which may be showen in diverse other particulars but these for our intention are sufficient to shew that could not prudently believe them much lesse could hazard my salvation vpon them

of the presbyterians disobedience to the civil magistrate and of their pretext of piety

good christians are alway's good subiects and these who are true to god are ever true to men
as they render vnto god what is gods so they give vnto caesar what is caesars
vpon the other part these who are false to men can never be true to god and they who are disobedient to their earthly superiours can never be obedient to their heavenly soveraigne
when the lawes of men are against the law of god then it's better to obey god then man but when there is no such opposition then the law of god obligeth vs to obedience and subiection
paul doth earnestly exhort all christians to this duty when he saith let every soule be subiect to higher powers for there is no power but of god and those that are of god are ordained
therefore he that resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god
and they that resist purchasse to themselves damnation
peter also maketh the like exhortation
pet

and

how the presbyterians have caried themselves in the duty of subiects to the civil magistrate and to their other superiours is so generally knowen and so fresh in all mens memories

that it needs not be described nor amplifyed
the very naming of a presbyterian is sufficient now to raise in mens minds the true notio of one who will obstinatly deny obedie~ce to those to whom he oweth it and will rigorously exact obedience from those who owes him none
indeed if the presbyterians owne words be taken they will be esteem'd not only saints but also most loyall and obedient subiects for so often they have tearm'd themselves
but their actions alwayes bewrayes their words

they professe in their new confession of faith that no difference of religion yea infidelity it self cannot take away the civil magistrats iust right nor his peoples obedience and duty to him
and yet in their practise they would not admit the king till he swore and subscribed their covenant and solemn league which many thought were very bitter potions that went much against his stomacke
many other instances may be brought of their inordinat cariage to their superiours and others by which they rais'd both scandal and preiudice against their religion for people seeing them to be evil subiects and worse masters could not think them to be good christians but forbeare not being willing to rip vp too much their sores wishing rather that all their bypast miscariages may be forgot and buried by their calme cariage and dutifull obedience in time to come
but apparantly some in present power have no great hopes of much voluntarie amendment in them vnlesse the rod of disciplin be

still kept over their heads for an eminent english officer in his printed letter above cited speaking of the presbyterians

saith if they be not closely look'd vnto they will set all on fire againe

then for their pretext of piety observed great shew but no substance some floorishes but small fruits huge pretexts but no performances
we had indeed much preaching praying fasting and such like exercises
but what were their long preachings nothing but continual praises of the covenant the solemn league and presbytery which they cryed vp to the heavens and omitted as our saviour observed of the pharisees the weighty matters of gods law

as iudgement mercy and faith
yea their sermons were replenished with constant and most bitter railings against their opposers and all those who did not favour their cause by which means they armed the people with fury to aduance the covenant and presbytery
what were their fasts but humiliations as the prophet esay saith for strife debate and to sinne with the fist of wikednesse god faith to the iewes
is not this the fast that have chosen to loose the bands of wickednesse to vndo the heavie burden and to let the oppressed go free that ye break every yoke but the fasts which the presbyterians have choosed were contrary for their fasts were to tie more firmely their covenant which hath proved a band of wickednesse to lay heavier burdens vpon the

peoples consciences to oppresse these who were free and to augment their yokes by inventing many new oaths to the oppression of many soules
it was much observed that shortly after their solemne fasts we were alwayes sure of some great claps
the fast was ordinarly a preparation to some violence or evil worke that was intended
this made many vnderstand what queen marie stuart mean't by that famous saying
that she was as much affrayed of a fast of the ministers as of an armie of souldiours for experience taught her that these fasts were sure prognostikcs of ensuing tempests
their long prayers also which were often seasoned with tautologies and somtimes with no good sense did not prove them to be saints more the the like did sanctify the pharisees
they bragged much of the spirit but shew no fruits of the spirit if these be the fruits which paul reckons out to the gallatians the fruit of the spirit saith he is love ioy peace gentlnesse goodnesse faith meeknesse
they rather shew and perform'd the works of the flesh which the same apostle doth there recount
the works of the flesh are manifest which are fornication hatred variance emulation wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders
if they lived in the spirit then they should have walked in the spirit as the same apostle exhort's and so they would have been better beleeved

in a word if piety consists in many externall sighes and grones in long prayer and graces in

wringing of hands making of strange faces in turning of the eyes and in dolefull houlings and cryes which were commonly called the sough if piety say consists in such things we had abondance of it but if it require some greater perfections and better fruits then we were very scarce of it
indeed if we would heare and believe these presbyterian ministers we were the happiest people of the world for they said we only of all nations had the honour to be covenanters with god we had the truth of the gospell in greater purity then geneva it self
we had such a clear and engyring light that the like had not shin'd to any other nation since the time of the apostles
yea one who is esteem'd a principal apostle among them did not sticke to affirme in the pulpit amidst the manyfold confusions troubles and miseries which had fallen vpon this church nation that the angels and saints of heaven if they could leave the sight of god would be glad to come down and see the admirable order and beautie of the presbyterian church of scotland neither is this to be much wonder'd at for it's probable he spoke as he thought and as the proverbe is
the crow thinks ever her owne bird fairest
and every foole esteem's much his owne babel
but many indifferent men thought that he was one of those of whom paul speaks to the philippians enemies of the crosse of christ and whose glory is in their confusion

these practises at least a great part of them were the occasion of my first doubting that the

presbyterian church could not be the true church of christ
for by the prebyterians changes and inconstancy in doctrin saw evidently they were not govern'd by the spirit of truth which christ promised to his church but by the spirit of errour whic is alwaies various
by their great dissensions and divisions perceived they had no vnity as becometh the house of god but were a confus'd chaos as many heads so many different opinions and that it was not truth nor authority that prevail'd in their meetings but the vsurpation of some few ringleaders who owerawed the rest and made them succumb
yea saw that inconstancy in doctrin flowes naturally from their principles and that their inconstant church doth necessarly breed dissensions but hath no means to lay them nor take them away
by their cruell severity over mens and persons
saw they had little christian love and meeknesse which vertues christ had recommended so earnestly to his true disciples by which he said the world should know them
by their clear contradicting their owne principles perceived they were not men led by reason but miscaried by passion and inconsiderat zeal which made them fall into inconsequentiall discourses not worthy of men of prudence and by which themselves shew the falshood of their owne principles

by doing their duty so ill to man saw evidenty

they perform'd not well their duty to god by their violent disobedience to their earthly superiours knew they could not be humbly obedient to their heavenly soveraigne by their great pretext of pietie without any substance and by their bragg's of the spirit without any fruites of the spirit but rather with the works of the flesh perceiv'd they were both corrupt in faith and manners
and albeit some of the more simple had great zeal and no evill intentions yet others of a higher or be who moved the rest gave no small ground to make many suspect that they were not sincere christians

although all that hath been already said which are not old nor hidden stories but such things as were done in our owne times and obvious to our senses did shew vnto me sufficiently the vnreasonablenesse of the new presbyterian reformation yet for my further satisfaction and least might be deceived resolved to try diligently and impartially the grounds of these new changes and alterations and to vse the apostle iohns counsel to prove the spirits
my deerest saith he believe not every spirit but prove the spirits if they be of god for many false prophets are gone out into the world
now the triall which intended was to trie their doctrin by the pure word of god which these reformers gave out to be their only ground
when the scripture was expresse and clear then was resolved to be fully satisfyed but when the scripture was not

evident and the question not so much concern the scripture as the true sense of it then intended to follow the interpretation sense of the holy and learned primitive fathers who have been after the holy apostles the pillars and propagators of christianity and resolved to prefer their constant testimonies according to the practice of the primitive church to the inconstant guesses of new vpstarts according to the practice of their wavering church who are as far inferiour to the holy fathers in holynesse and learning as they come short of them in antiquitie and renowne
and with this resolution began to examin the question of epicopacy which gave so great occasion to all the broiles and alterations that have ensued

vii
of episcopacy condemned as by the presbyterians

as knew the church of christ which is often called in the scripture the kingdome of heaven to be the most excellent society that ever was vpon earth to tend to a most spiritual and heavenly end and to be directed by most holy and divine lawes so iustly conceived that the goodnesse and wisdome of christ had established a most excellent order and forme for the governement of that heavenly

kingdome which he had founded vpon earth and that whosoever would strive to overturne that order and government would be guilty of spiritual treason and of sacrilegious presumption
we have had for many yeares furious contentions in our nation concerning the governement established by christ in his church
the bishops who had governed from our infancy were deposed at the beginning of the troubles and their office was declared to be contrary vnto the purity of our first reformation to have no warrant in gods word and to be in it self vnlawfull and
and in place of episcopacy was brought in a parity of ministers and the presbyterian disciplin as the only governement established by christ in his church and only conform to his word
but after due triall found the presbyterians in all these matters to come very short of their pretences

to begin then with our reformation
imagined a good space that episcopal governement was not vsed till many yeares after the reformation wherein was deceived by two reasons
because it was generally affirmed that king iames brought first in bishops at the assembly of glasgow anno

because the puritanicall ministers were accustomed to accuse the church of scotland for having fallen from her first love and they alwayes pretended that they were to reduce all things vnto the purity of their first reformation
but found the contrary in their owne

records
for knox his chronicle sheweth that at the beginning of his reformation which happened in the yeare
the church newly planted was governed by who had authority over whole shires could ordaine and depose ministers had a larger stipend then others and kept their places all their lifetimes
it expresseth also the manner of their election and the names of those who were first chosen with the bounds of their power and iurisdiction as may be seen in the said chronicle pag

and
of the london impression
and what is this but episcopal power vnder an other name this governement remain'd vnquestioned the space of
yeares till andrew melvil a man of a firie and presbyterian spirit comming from geneva in the yeaere
began to make factions and by all means laboured to introduce the holy geneva disciplin which he cry'd vp to the heavens and as far abased the episcopal function as a meere corruption
the whole matter is largely described

in the late bishop of andrewes history where he sheweth that the confusion troubles and tyranny which the presbyterian governement brought into the church and the seditions it raised in the state were so great that iames who had often that sentence in his mouth no bishop no king was forced to reduce things vnto the first reformation and to restore episcopacy
so that it's very evident that the presbyterians do falsly pretend that

episcopacy or superiority of pastors is against the purity of their first reformation and that parity of ministers or presbyterian governement is conform to it the contrary being most certaine out of their owne records

next found they came as little speed of their pretence of the word of god which is so far from condemning episcopacy as evil and that it rather commends it as good and christian

paul writing to timothee saith this is a true or faithfull saying
if a man desire a bishops office he desireth a good worke
and that we may not contend about names find the same paul acknowledging in timothee the power of iudging and ordaining presbyters in which the power and svperiority of bishops principally consists
for in the
chap of the same epistle he saith against a presbyter receive not an accusation but vnder two or three witnesses
and ver
lay not thy hands suddenly on no man
he sheweth also that he had left titus in the isle of crete to ordaine priests by cities

by this saw as conceived clearly enough that all pastors are not equall but some are superiour to others and that a bishop and a minister is not the same as the presbyterians do pretend since the one hath power to iudge and ordaine which the other hath not
therevpon made this observation
if it be a true or faithfull saying as the apostle speaks to call the office of bishop good then it is neither a true nor faithfull saying to call it evil as the presbyterians speaks
if the

office of bishop be a good worke then it was no good worke in the presbyterians to condemn it as
for that is not only to contradict the scripture but also to incurre the curse threatned by the prophet
wo vnto them who call's evil good and good evil

more over christ himself did institute diverse degrees of pastors in his church when he choosed
apostles

and thereafter
disciples
now it appear'd very evident vnto me that as the apostles were distinguished from the disciples by their diverse institution

number and more intire familiarity with christ by whom they were privily instructed so they were in a higher degree and dignity above the other disciples which truth is much illustrated and confirmed by the solemn assumption of matthias who was before one of the disciples vnto the apostle ship

or as peter sheweth out of the psalmes the bishoprike of iudas
lastly god did institute in the old testament diverse degrees of the high priests the other priests and levits as calvin himself confesseth
therefore it seem'd vnto me there was no repugnancy

why the like goodly order and subordination of pastors might not also be in the new testament yea rather all reason doth require that these things ought to be in the church of christ and that more excellently and perfectly then in the synagogue of the iewes since this is but a shaddow and type of the other

but although the scriptures being duely

considered seemed clear enough in this matter yet for more security and to take away endlesse ianglings and wranglings which some contentious heads makes vpon the clearest words of scripture had my next recours vnto the interpretation of the holy fathers practise of the primitive church
and found that they did not only vnderstand the scriptures for the superiority of bishops over other pastours but also they condemned the contrary opinion as a wicked heresy in aerius
augustin

explaining these words of paul above cited who desireth a bishops office desireth a good worke saith the apostle would shew what the office of a bishop is for it's a name of of labour and not of honour that he may know himself not to be a bishop who delights to preside not to profite

hierom sheweth that in the primitive church the office of a bishop was the next degree to martyrdome for bishops being the chiefe leaders of christians were most diligently searched out persecuted by the pagans
therefore the office of a bishop being so high and excellent so hard dangerous it was no wonder that the apostle did require so many excellent vertues and qualities in any

who desireth that office which he call's a good worke
will only adde to these two most ancient fathers for confirmation of this truth
denys arcopagita the disciple of paul describing the hierarchy instituted by god in the church putteth the bishops in the first place the priests in the second and the

ministers or deacons in the third
and ignatius the disciple also of the apostles and bishop of antioch doth shew this excellent subordination of pastours in the church for thus he writes in one of his epistles
priests be subiect vnto your bishop deacons vnto priests and you people vnto priests and deacons
who shall observe this comelinesse of order would willingly change my soule with theirs and our lord be with them for ever
the presbyterians have not only not observed that comelinesse of order but they have condemn'd it and brought in the vglinesse of confusion and therefore they want this holy martyrs benediction
the holy fathers also do constantly teach that the bishops do succeed vnto the apostles and the priests vnto the
disciples and therefore the bishops are greater then the priests
yea the most eminent among all the holy fathers were bishops although diverse of them were advanced to that dignity much against their will
and besids all these testimonies found the practice of the whole primitive church which was alwayes governed by shops from the beginning
must professe that considering all these things was fully satisfyed and resolved not to abandon all these authorities of scriptures fathers and the whole ancient church for the ministers strong cry's and bare words which they only bring against them all

was much confirmed in this resolution when found the contrary opinion concerning

parity of pastours which is now maintayn'd by the presbyterians to be condemned as an ancient heresy by the holy fathers
epiphanius writes thus of aerius
his speech was more furious then became any man for he said what differs a bishop from a priest there is no difference the order is one the honour one and the dignity is the same
and confuting it a little after

he saith that this matter is full of fully is manifest to all wise men
for that a bishop and a priest are not the same the divine word of the apostle doth teach
and after he hath proved from the words of the apostle above cited that bishops who have power of iudgeing priests are above priests then he proves also the bishops superiority by their power of ordination
how is it possible saith he that a bishop and a priest can be equall for that order begetteth fathers vnto the church but the other hath no power to beget fathers it only begets children vnto the church by the lauer of regeneration and not fathers and masters
and how is it possible that one can ordaine a priest who hath got no imposition of hands for ordination augustin also reckons vp this errour of aerius in his booke of heresies
yea hierom who of all the holy fathers doth most extoll the order of priestood and brings it as would seem in some comparison with episcopacy excepts alwayes the power of ordination for thus he writes
what doth a bishop except ordination that a priest doth not also by all which it is manifest that if the presbyterians had been living

above tuelve hundred yeares ago they had been condemned in this point as heretiques by the holy fathers and that with more reason then the aerians who never proceeded to their hight of arrogance to call the office of bishop vnlawfull and
now against all this what brings the presbyterians for themselves pure scripture at least they pretend so which is an ordinary custome to all those whose errours are most against scripture
they bring ordinarly two places wherein they have greatest confidence
the first is math
where our saviour saith vnto the apostles
you know that the princes of the gentiles overrule them and they that are the greater exercise power against them
it shall not be so among you
the like words are repeated the
of luke
the second place is
tim


where the apostle saith to timothee neglect not the grace that is in thee which is given thee by prophecie with imposition of the hands of the presbyterie or of the eldership as some of their bibles translates it

considered diligently these places and the rest which they bring and could not find in any of them either superiority of pastours condemned nor equality approved much lesse a iudicatorie of
or
ministers with a changeable moderator established to iudge over their brethren in all matters ecclesiasticall
there needs no more to know the truth here but to open our ey's and read the places for impudence it self cannot affirme that the

scripture doth there expresly condemn the one or approve the other
therefore it's a vaine and false pretence of the presbyterians to alledge their disciplin to be contain'd expresly in the scripture
after expresse scripture failes them then they run to their owne glosses and consequences vpon the scripiure which they will have the people to believe as scripture wherein they commit a double deceit

to promise pure scripture and then in place of it to give yow their owne glosses or rather guesses which are not to be found in
to oblige yow to believe these glosses and humane inventions to be scripture or as scripture
as if one who had promised to give an other a quantity of gold and in place of it would give himonly brasse and then after this deceit would also oblige him to esteem the brasse to be gold
but albeit these glosses and consequences be not in scripture yet it may be they are cleare of themselves and necessarly deduced from the scripture as the presbyterians pretends
found this pretence also to be false
for if they were so evident and necessary then men of iudgement would easily see such glosses and make such consequences
but the holy fathers who were not only men of great iudgement but were also most eminent for learning and holynesse never made any such interpretations and consequences vpon the scripture
therefore the presbyterian glosses cannot be clear and evident which such holy and piercing ey's could not see

or if they saw them it was only to condemn them as hath been shewed
and albeit this authority be more then sufficient to overthrow the pretended clearnesse of all these new glosses yet when considered that the most learned of all the protestants side as all the lutherans in germanie suedland and denmark who have their superintendents and the late protestant church of england scotland and ireland and which is to be much here considered the scottish church at its first reformation never made any such interpretations vpon these scriptures but had their bishops and superintendents then esteem'd it a madnesse to imagin that these presbyterian glosses could be clear and necessary which neither the holy fathers the whole primitive church and so many learned protestants and all their churches could not see
and albeit the french protestants do admit of the consistorial disciplin yet they do not declare episcopacy to be absolutly or that their forme is only christian much lesse do they think it so necessarie as to overturne kingdomes commonwealths for setting it vp
of which beza and du moulin may be sufficient witnesses

the first saith whosoever doth iudge this disciplin not only vnprofitable but hurtfull to their churches let them enioy their owne sense
and much more to this purpose
the other saith in so much as co~cerneth ecclesiastical disciplin we do not hold that equality of pastors is absolutely necessary
who esteem not that order a point of faith or a doctrin of

salvation
we live thanks be to god in brotherly concord with our neighbouring churches which follow an other forme where there are bishops some superiority

and monsr blondel a famous minister in france hath lately written a booke entitled of the primacy in the church where he teacheth that although superiority of pastours be not by divine right yet it is not against divin right and therefore neither is equality of pastours by divine right
all which are very far from the doctrines and practises of our scottish presbyterians who stands very single and bare of all authority divine and humane having all the world against them not only the holy fathers and whole ancient church but also all the old protestants both lutherans and calvinists
and if we shall add vnto these the independents and anabaptists and other new protestants who admits of an equality among pastours but condemns presbyterian power and tyranny their small authority and number is yet much diminished and the clearnesse of their glosses is much obscured lastly if we will take away from the presbyterians number all these who by deceit or force were gain'd vnto it their authority will appeare very slender and the number of knowing and willing presbyterians scarcely considerable for now when force hath fail'd them many are dayly falling from them

as found the presbyterians destitute of all authority to backe their new glosses so perceiv'd their reasons and consequences to be

meer sophismes as this which they wrest out of our saviours words in mathew above cited doth shew
christ say they forbids ruleing among the apostles as the princes of the gentiles vsed over their subiects saying it shall not be so among yow but whosoever will be the greater among you let him be your servant
therefore say they none ought to be greater then an other but all equal
and from this equality they inferre that there ought to be a presbytery
which is as ridiculous as if yow would say the king or supreme magistrate forbids all domineering or tyrannizing of his subordinate iudges such as is vsed among the turks therefore he forbids all superiority of one over an other and makes all his iudges equall whereas indeed there followes no more but that he forbiddeth turkish tyranny
after the same manner christ forbids among the apostles heathenish tyranny but not lawfull and christian superiority
yea doth not christ propound himself for an example in the same place and was not christ superiour to the apostles therefore it's evident he only requireth there greater humility in those who were to be in greatest dignity as hierom writing on this place doth observe
so that our saviours words here are so far from inferring an equality that they necessarly suppose an inequality of pastours
and if such presbyterian consequences were admitted they might vpon the same ground bring in a levelling in the civil as wel as in

the ecclesiastical estate
yea they would destroy their presbyteries which they would have only to stand as the independents do reason well against them
for it's much lesse lawfull for tuentie or many to domineer over their brethren as the presbyterians have done and would do then for one of worth vertue to have exercise christian superiority and iurisdiction
as the old protestants do shew the falshood of the presbyterians first consequence by which they would wrest from our saviours words an equality of pastours so the independents and other new protestants do shew the falshood of their second consequence by which they would infer from that suppos'd equality the governement of their presbytery
for these new congregations do admit equality and yet will not heare of presbytery
the like insufficiency may be shewed of their glosses and consequences vpon that place of paul to timothee where he speaks of presbytery from which they would most ridiculously infer parity of pastours and the whole platforme of their disciplin with the power of their soveraigne iudicatory which they call presbytery
all which glosses and consequences are not only against the sense of the holy fathers and of the ancient church but also against the sense and interpretation of almost all the old and new protestants which is sufficient to shew them to be false and groundlesse
and therefore for brevities sake we will not insist longer in refutation of them
this only may be observed by

the way that the presbyterians are brought to a hard straight when for all their disciplin which they bragge is so clearly in scripture they are enforced to run to one word and that also they must etymologize and vnderstand against the sense of all christian nations and ages

but albeit the presbyterian disciplin cannot be found in the scripture nor fathers nor cannot by any right reason be drawen from them yet perhaps it may be good in it self and a heavenly thing
well then we shall according to to our saviours rule try it briefly by its fruits
it made indeed great promises of it selfe and had some faire floorishes but the fruits did not answer to expectation neither were they proportionable to the great labour that was bestowed in planting nor to the aboundance of blood that was shed for watering that vnhappy tree
among many high commendations of presbytery which are collected in the
chap of the survey of the holy disciplin it was said in queen elyzabeths time the want of presbytery is the cause of all evil
it's not to be hoped that any commonwealth can floorish without it
without this disciplin there can be no right religion
these who reiect this disciplin refuse christ to raigne over them
at the beginning also of these troubles in scotland the people were fed with large promises of the good of presbytery
for then it was said that all prelatical pride and tyranny should cease all innovations should haue an end the purity of the gospel should be restored and all blissings should be poured

downe with presbytery vpon this nation
these were the promises floorishes of presbytery but the fruits have proved iust contrary
for there was never more yea hardly ever such pride and tyranny never more innovations never greater miseries and calamities and never lesse solid religion and more inclination to atheisme as may appeare by reflecting on what hath been said above
it cannot be denyed whatsoever the government of the church be but our saviour doth require mecknesse and humility in the governours of it and yet the covenanters in the iudgement of many haue carried themselves as if christ had not required these vertues but rather the contrary vices
therefore many of the wiser sort of those in england who were weary of episcopacy after they had taken a short triall of presbytery soone smeld out the nature of it and finding they had changed for the far worst and that their consciences were oppress'd by more heavy they did quickly cast off that heavy yoke and so finding out a third way of independency haue many wayes since that time both outwitted and over throwen the presbyterians by their owne weapons

to conclude this matter found after a serious triall that superiority of pastours is conforme both to the old and new testament that episcopacy is so far from being and against gods word that it is most christian and expresly contain'd in the word of god

which was so vnderstoode by the holy fathers and that this was the governement of the primitive church in the purest times when the office of a bishop was not so much a place of honour as a worke of labour and the next degree to as is evide~t in the bishops of rome thritie of which and above did successively after peter shed their blood for christ
and vpon the other part could not find parity of ministers and the new disciplin in the scriptures but rather found that it was against scripture against the holy fathers and the whole primitive church against sound reason and good governement against many protestant churches the learnedest men of that profession and against the practise of our first reformers and that it brought in confusion in the church and tyranny over mens consciences that it was condemned as an ancient heresy by the holy fathers and that as an evil tree it had lately produced much evil fruite
therefore could not abandon all these divine and humane authorities these manifest reasons and experiences which found in confirmation of episcopacy and in condemnation of presbytery for the strong cry's of some few passionat ministers who as they are destitute of all divine and humane authority so they scarcely professe to satisfy men in reason
they will haue their bare words accompanyed with a sigh or a grone to be sufficient to oblige all men to swear and believe all that they say or can invent albeit you find never so great

authotity yea and reason it self to the contrary
it's knowen how a great apostle of the covenant cry'd out against some ministers who shortly after the beginning of these troubles came to reason for episcopacy or to demand reason for the abolishing it and setting vp of presbytery
away away said he with your reason you must quite all reason and help poore christ a lift
which he said truly in a part
for any man who would believe them must quite reason and more too

found at lenth this matter concerning episcopacy or the governement of the church to be of greater consequence then many thinks or was at first aware of
for what can be more fundamental to the church then the order and governement which christ hath established in it what can be a more dangerous fundamental errour then to overthrow yea and accurse that order and governement which christ had setled in it if it be treason in any kingdome or commonwealth for any private faction to overthrow the fu~damental governement which is established in them by law what high treason is it against christ to abrogate and accurse that order and governement which he with so great wisdome had setled in his heavenly kingdome therefore if episcopacy be ordain'd by christ and so be iure diuino as it appear'd sufficiently to me for the reasons lately touched

then as the puritan authour of the tuelue general arguments reasoneth well and acknowledgeth ingenuosly the churches of

scotland france low countries and other places
cannot be a true church but the synagogue of satan contradicting therein both christ his gospel
moreover if there can be no true church without lawfull pastours and no lawfull pastours can be without lawfull ordination and none hath power of ordination except bishops alone as the doctrin and practise of the ancient church do shew then the destruction of episcopacy brings alo~g with it the destructio of all lawfull pastours and so consequently of a true church and sacraments which is a most desperat errour as it was a most cruel tyranny to enforce others to swear and believe it against their consciences

viii
of our lords prayer neglected to be said by the presbyterians

after had tried the presbyterians abrogation of the apostolique governement which christ had established in his church proceeded next to consider brieflly their innovation concerning the most excellent of all prayers which himself had made and recommended to his church
we were taught from our infancy to our lords prayer and the ministers themselves did ordinarly conclude their prayers with it
christ made it and the scriptures containe it
so that we had not only the dignity of the authour the authority of the scriptures but also the practise of

the ministers and of the whole people to render the vse of this divine prayer laudable and profitable
but after the presbyterians tooke vpon them to be reformers they abolished all set prayers and this also was worne out of vse as well as the rest
yea as they all neglected any more to say it so there were some who thought not that sufficient vnlesse they spoke also too boldly against the vse of it
could never see any probable pretence for this presbyterian innovation which as am informed seem's so strange and incredible to strangers that they can hardly believe it
therefore this alteration being so vnreasonable did quickly discover the absurdity of it

found it to be against the practise of our first reformers

against the scriptures

against the ancient church and holy fathers

that the presbyterians by forbearing to say this prayer did rob themselves of the benefite of the most excellent and efficacious of all prayers

that they did not bring so good prayers in the place of it

because the presbyterians pretended alwayes to reduce all things to the purity of our first reformation informed my self of the practise of our reformers and found they made publique vse of this prayer as may be seen in knoxes chronicle pag
where at the conclusion of the prayer for election of the it is said we crave the encrease of thy grace as by thee our lord king and only bishop we are taughs to pray our father


so that this presbyterian innovation is clearly against the purity of the first reformation


it is also manifestly against the scripture for after our saviour had reproved the hypocritical prayers of the pharisees and much speaking of the heathen

he saith vnto his disciples be not you therefore like to them
thus therefore shall you pray
our father
and because some do very phantastically pretend that our saviour did not prescribe this prayer to be said but only did shew it as a forme or model of prayer to be followed they are clearly convinced out of the
chap of luke where our saviour said to his disciples when you pray say father hallowed he thy name
our saviour here saith not say thus or after this manner but say our fathers

this presbyterian innovation is also much against the practise of the holy fathers and primitive christians who vsed this divine prayer frequently and dayly
augustin beareth witnes of this when he saith
the dayly prayer of the faithfull doth satisfy for our dayly light offences for its theirs to say our father which art in heaven
where the holy father call's this prayer for the dayly vse of it the dayly prayer of the faithfull and albeit

as the same augustin testifyeth elswhere there be not an absolute necessity of saying the same words but to pray in the same or the like sense yet the church of christ in all ages did ever give such respect vnto this heavenly prayer that she

hath continually vsed not only the sense and meaning but also the very words of christ
and although also she made vse of other prayers yet she never omitted this but vsed it dayly and frequently as deserving most iustly the preeminence above all other prayers


the holy fathers do shew not only the excellency of this divine prayer but also the great efficacy of it to obtaine from god all benefits
cyprian writes thus of it's excellency
deerly beloved how great and how many are the mysteries of our lords prayer they are briefly collected in speech but they are spiritually copious in power so that nothing is omitted in our prayers and supplications which is not contayn'd in the compend of that heavenly doctrin

tertullian calls our lords prayer
tho breviarie or compend of the euangel and saith that how much it is shortned in words it is as much enlarged in senses
but there needeth not much commendation of the worke to those who know the excellency of the authour
the same cyprian doth shew the great efficacy of this prayer in these excellent words
since we haue christ an aduocat with our father for our sins when we sinners do supplicat for our offences let vs bring forth the words of our aduocat
for when he saith what euer you aske from the father in my name he will giue it vnto you how much more efficaciously shall we obtaine what we aske in christs name if we aske it by his owne prayer and againe he call's it a friendly familiar prayer to pray god with his owne to make the prayer of christ ascend

vnto his eares
the father saith he will aknowledge the words of his son when he who dwelleth inwardly in the heart is also outwardly in the tongue
augustin in the place lately cited doth shew also the vertue of this prayer when he saith that the dayly saying of it doth satisfy for our dayly and light offences without which this life is not led
therefore the presbyterians by neglecting to say this prayer did deprive themselv's of the benefite of the most excellent and efficacious of all prayers
and therefore albeit they tooke exception against all set formes of prayer which were made by men and would say them no more yet they might haue alway's excepted this prayer which was made by god both for the excellency of it self and the dignity of the authour
but all were put in the same category
yea there were some of the deepest presbyterian dye who did not think it sufficie~t to neglect the saying of it vnlesse they spoke also irreuerently against the vse of it
and there were some so vnreasonable that they would maintaine it was not only vnprofitable to say our lords prayer but also vnlawfull
we noted above how a great apostle of the covenant called publickly the vse of saying often our lords prayer a papistical charme
an other minister in galloway did glory as was assured by a person of knowen honesty that he had banished out of his parish two idols to witt our father and god of all glory and peace
which was a short grace that was said ordinarly after meate for all graces as well as prayers

behoved to be extemporary even among the laiques who intended to be in the right presbyterian mode
but as that person to whom this minister spoke answered him well saying if you haue banished these two which you call idols feare you shall bring in worse idols in their place
so it fell forth
for in place of that diuine short and excellent prayer made by god we got long tedious inconsiderat prayers made extempore by men which for the most part were full of tautologies and idle bablings
as tertullian said well of our lords prayer
that it was short in words but large in senses so the contrary may be said not vnfitly of the presbyterians extemporary prayers they were large in words but very short of sense
and this was the noble exchange that we made which certainly was for the worst

seing then it's evident that our lords prayer is the most excellent of all prayers that it was made by christ for our vse that it was highly esteem'd and frequently vsed by the holy fathers and the primitive church that it's most efficacious to obtaine from god all benefit's and besid's that it was said publickly by our first reformers and is yet vsed by all the old protestants could not approve the presbyterians innovation of forbearing to say it
much lesse could approve the irreverent or rather blasphemous opinion of some who maintain'd that it was both vnprofitable and vnlawfull to vse it which found also to haue been maintain'd many yeares ago by the brounists

and puritans as may be seen in britannomachia ministror lib
cap

dogm
for what is the authority of presbytery against all these authorities which are brought for the laudable vse of our lords prayer and how much lesse is it to be esteemed since this innovation did not proceed from any general consent of the whole ministery but from some few giddy domineering heads which tyrannized over the rest and made them to follow their example
for now since presbyterian power is a little quailed diuerse ministers are clinging in againe to their old custome of saying this divine prayer which they may do now without danger

admired much when a catholique friend shew me

that the waldenses defended an errour iust contrary in this matter to the presbyterians
for they maintain'd that no other forme of prayer was to be admitted except our lords prayer as may be seen in gualterus and these admits almost all other prayets except that
thought the waldenses and we had agreed better together for had often heard that we were all of one religion
but the same friend made an other observation on this matter which seem'd to be more smart
for after he had showen me a ridiculous story which is related towards the end of the preface to knoxes chronicle with many circumstances and which thereafter found not without some admiration to be repeated in spots woods new history

how there

fell forth a great dispute and trouble among the doctours of andrew's

a little before the reformation whither our lords prayer should be said only to god or if it might he said to the saints also now said he this fable by divine providence is truly turn'd on your presbyterians
for they will not have our lords prayer to be said neither to god nor the saints and they withdraw men by their evil example from saying to their heauenly father our father· which art in heaven
chap
ix
of glory to the father or of the hymne of glorification taken away by the presbyterians

from the reformation of our lords prayer which was said to our heavenly father the presbyterians proceeded next to reforme or rather to abolish the hymne of glory which was ordinarly sung in praise of the holy trinity
this innovation seem'd very strange and gaue great scandal to many
for besids that it had been vsed from our infancy and was sung publickly in all churches at the conclusion of of the psalmes it contain'd not the least apparance of evil but rather did appear to tend much to the honour of god to whom all praise glory principally belongs
and albeit it be not word by word in one place of the holy scripture

as our lords prayer is yet the sense and the like words if not the same are to be found in it
for what is more expresly contain'd in the new testament then the father son and holy ghost in whose name we are all baptized and which all true christians do acknowledge to be one true god and what is more cleare in scripture then that glory is due vnto god paul saith to the king of the worlds immortal invisible only god be honour and glory for ever
amen
peter also speaking of christ saith to him be glory both now and to the day of eternity
amen
and iude to the only god our saviour by iesus christ our lord be glory magnificence empire and power before all worlds and now for all worlds evermore
amen
there is nothing more freque~t in the revelatio then redoubling of this glory to god
iohn saith that he heard every creature in heaven and vpon earth saying to him who sitteth on the throne and to the lambe benediction honour glory power for ever and ever
therefore since the giving of glory to god is the principal exercise of the saints in heaven why may it not or rather why ought it not to be the exercise also of the saints on earth iohn saith he heard a voice come out from the throne saying
say praise to our god all you his servants and you that feare him little and great
why then should the presbyterians hinder both little great to sing this hymne of praise glory vnto the holy trinity why should they goe against their owne former practise and that custome which was observed

by their first reformers and which is yet keep't in all the more ancient protestant churches how could one of their ministers interrupt the people when they were singing that hymne by crying out no lesse ridiculously then scandalously no more glory to the father no more glory indeed if the presbyterians denyed the mystery of the holy trinity as the arians did they might vpon that false ground had some pretence of reason for this innovation but acknowledging the truth of that divine mystery they appear'd very vnreasonable for abolishing that hymne which was ordinarly said in praise of it and which hath so good ground in the holy scriptures

being therefore desirous to know this matter from the source had my next recourse according to my accustomed methode vnto the primitive church the holy fathers
and there found that this hymne was most ancient an apostolical tradition that it was highly esteem'd and much vsed by the catholique church in the primitive times that as some heretiques did much endeavour to pervert it so the catholiques did labour as diligently to preserve it in the same purity as it had descended vnto them by continual practise and tradition
and lastly found that god did approve the laudable vse of this hymne by some notable miracles
all which we shall briefly shew

how the hymne of glorification was vsed from the very tyme of the apostles basil the

great doth largely shew
for when the sacrament of baptisme was administrated by them in name of the father of the son and of the holy ghost the faithfull answered glory be to the father to the son and to the holy ghost
which custome of glorifying god the same holy father doth affirme to be an apostolical tradition which had been every where observed throughout the whole church
of this matter cardinal baronius treateth amply in his third tome anno
where he also sheweth that this hymne was of so great authority and esteeme in the ancient church that when the holy fathers in the councel of constantinople were to establish a rule of faith against some heretiques who denyed the divinity of the holy ghost they would haue inserted in that symbol a testimony from this hymne of glory for the divinity of the holy ghost in these words who with the father and the son is adored and
and albeit this hymne was much vsed in the church from the beginning yet it was sung more frequently in honour of the blessed trinity after the arians began to corrupt it

how the arians did strive to change and pervert this hymne the same card
baronius sheweth out of sozomen

for as they had changed the forme of baptisme by saying baptise thee in the name of the father by the son in the holy ghost so also they corrupted the hymne of glorification by singing glory be to the father by the son in the holy ghost
which diversity

a dissension in antioch between the catholiques and the arians whilst they would keep the ancient custome and the others would bring in their corrupt innovation
therefore the great councel of nice

which had arian heresy for the more confusion of it gave order to continue these hymnes in the church which were in vse to be sung formerly in praise of the holy trinity and especially the hymne of glorification which the arians had changed and endeavoured to pervert as they had impiously denyed the mystery of the holy trinity in whose honour it was said
and from this time that hymne began to be more frequently vsed so that the countrey people would sing it whilst they were busied about their ordinary labours
for how much the arians did strive to suppresse and pervert it so much the catholiques did labour to preserve and celebrat it
for which cause ambrose did conclude all the new hymnes which he made to be sung by the people during the time of the persecution which he suffered of the arians with the hymne of glorification as augustin testifieth

and therefore being accused by the arians for hauing deceived the people with the verses of his new hymnes he answered do not deny that
what is more powerfull then the confession of the trinity which is celebrated every day by the mouths of the people they labour all earnestly to confesse the faith they know to praise in verse the father son holy ghost and they are all become teachers who scarcely

could haue been schollers
yea to confound yet more the arians who blasphemously said that the son was made by the father in time and that there was a time when he was not the holy councel of nice was pleased to add vnto the ancient hymne of glorification glory to the father
that appendix as it was in the beginning now and ever shall be world without end amen
which clause did appeare in my iudgment as a prophesie serving not only for the confusion of the arians but also of the presbyterians

moreover the christians of old vere so carefull to preserve the integrity of this hymne as it had been delivered vnto them by their religious ancestors that they would not suffer so much as one syllable of it to be altered so that diverse of the faithfull did take offence at some expressions of great basil who ended his sermons with the glorification for not observing the words of it
and therefore he wrote an excellent booke de spiritu sancto to give satisfaction vnto the catholiques and to take away all aduantage which the heretiques might haue drawen from his expressions
where he professeth that it is not lawfull to any person whatsoever to reiect or write otherwise the syllabe and which proceeded from our lords mouth
the same did pope vigilius testify as baronius relateth to eutherius a spanish bishop

who had shewed him that some evil christians in spaine had changed both the forme of baptisme and the hymne of glorification by taking

away from them both the particle and before the holy ghost saying baptize thee in the name of the father of the son holy ghost
doing the like also when they sung the hymne of glorification to which the pope ansuered that these were novelties and dangerous errours wherein if these persons would obstinatly continue they could haue no communion with the catholique church
by this and diverse other experiences perceived how carefull the ancient christians were to preserve the purity of divine truths of apostolical traditions that they would not quite not alter so much as one syllable of them to please all the heretiques in the world
what would they thought then of the presbyterians who haue not taken away on syllabe but the whole sentence and substance of this hymne

lastly found that god hath been pleased to approve the laudable vse of this divine hymne by miracles
for whereas diuerse catholiques had their tongues cut out by the wicked cruel arians in the persecution which they endured vnder hunericus the arian king of the wandals by the admirable power of the holy ghost they spoke distinctly without their tongues and did celebrate the divinity of christ as baronius sheweth by the testimony of irrefragable witnesses

as of iustinian the emperour and diverse others who saw some of them with their eyes and beard them speake
which matter also cornelius a lapide doth touch in his commentaire on the
ch to the rom

moreover the same baronius doth also relate out of many good authours

how hildebrand the popes legat in france who became thereafter pope gregory the
did by this hymne miraculously discover diverse simoniack bishops in that when one time a learned and eloquent bishop was accused of simony before him which he would by no means confesse being suddenly commanded by the legat to say glory be to the father to the son to the holy ghost he pronounced indeed clearly and distinctly the father the son but by no means could he pronounce the holy ghost
by which miracle he was moved to confesse his fault to quite his bishoprique after which confession he pronounced distinctly the whole hymne
diverse other simoniack bishops in that countrey were induced by the same miracle to do the same
so that god almighty for approving the vse of this heavenly hymne hath made his approved servants who wanted their tongues miraculously to pronounce it and from these who had tongues but vere vnworthy he tooke away even their natural power to vtter it

what shall we say then of this inconsiderat presbyterian sect which hath outstripped the arians the most wicked of all heretiques for these did only change a little this glorious hymne which yet with that change might admit a good sense although they made it for a perverse end but the presbyterians to their greater ignominy haue totally abolished it

wherein they haue shouen themselv's against the scripture and to be clearely opposit unto the holy church to the sacred councel of nice to the custome of their first reformers and to goe against their owne practises and of the other reformed churches abroad
yea in an other consideration the presbyterians appeare in this point to be worse then the arians
for these heretiques denying the mystery of the holy trinity by opposing one or two places of scripture which they did privatly falsly expound to the constant ancient belief of the whole christian world did rationally supposing these ill principles to change the hymne of glorification which was said in in honour of the holy trinity yea if they could to haue altogether abolished it which doubtlesse they had done if shame could haue permitted them
but they left this effronted action to the presbytery which is more passionat and lesse rational then the arians
for the presbyterians pretending to believe the mystery of the holy trinity haue most irrationally abolished that hymne of glory which had been said in honour of it from the beginning of christianity
was much astonished when considered into what miseries raveries inconsiderat passion furious zeal do drive men who vnder pretence of greater purity of more close adhering to the sriptures stray alway's further from them and fall into greater impurity and defile themselv's with more filthie errours

this innovation shortly after it came in was very hardly press'd against me by a roman catholique of my acquentance who tooke occasion therevpon to say vnto me
what is the reason that knox your first reformer whom you esteem no small light did not abolish the hymne of glorification as your presbyterians haue lately done or if he did not see all things how could it escape the sharp eyes of these two famous first apostles luther calvin whom you believe to haue bein sent extraordinarly by god to reforme the church they neither saw nor could see any thing blameable in it
when he saw that answered nothing but only blamed the presbytery for their inconsideration inconstancy which indeed was all that could say he told me that paul manifesteth the true source of this the like innovations
for speaking of false teachers he saith evil men and seducers shall wax worse erring driving into errour
so that

what the first reformers who could not on a suddaine deny all truths left vntouched your second presbyterian reformers haue abolished as they haue done here the hymne of glory which was said in praise of the holy trinity and for which you haue got the noble exchange of co~tinual praises of the covenant presbytery
but as the great councel of nice did add vnto the ancient hymne of glory to the father that clause
as it was in the beginning
for confusion of the arian heresy so also it hath by the same addition prophetically

foretold the continuance of it for ever to the confusion of this new sect called presbytery which is most consonant to that of paul to god be glory in the church and in christ iesus to all generations world without end amen

that church which hath triumphed over the arians who corrupted this glorious hymne will also triumph over the presbyterians who have abolished it
yea this hymne shall not only continue to the worlds end in the church militant but it shall be also the exercise of the church triumphant which shall never cease for all eternity to sing praise glory vnto the most holy trinity
thus ended my catholique friend whose words found to be more waighty a good space after then they appear'd to me at the time when he spoke them
moreover remember he desired me to consider that these innovations against our lords prayer and the hymne of glory were such blacke actions that the prime presbyterians who introduced them were ashamed to make acts to forbid them as they had done for abolishing of episcopacy and some other points but only brought them in by a desuetude as they speake and so wore them out of vse
which sheweth said he that they would gladly haue some things done covertly which they are asham'd to avow publickly
chap
of the apostles creed denyed to be apostolical by the presbyterians

there was hardly any thing that the presbyterians did which made me stumble so much as their innovation concerning the authority of the apostles creed
they were not content with their reformation or rather abrogation of the apostolique governement vnlesse they also did deny the creed to be made by the apostles and so weare it out of vse as they had done our lords prayer
at the end of of their new catechisme they speake thus of the creed albeit the substance of the doctrine comprised in the abridgement commonly called the apostles creed be fully set forth in each of the catechismes so as there is no necessity of inserting the creed it self yet it is here annexed not as though it were composed by the apostles
in which words they reach covertly two things

that the creed it self is not necessary if we have the substance of it as it is explain'd in the new presbyterian catechisme

that it needs not be esteemed to be composed by the apostles
but their practise did shew more evidently their meaning
for they did not only declare it not to be apostolical and therefore to be only a humane collection but also they did no more say it neither did they require it to be said any

more of others as the custome was formerly at baptismes
and by these means they put it out both of estimation and vse

this innovation gave great scandal to many who thought iustly they could thereafter be sure of nothing since their creed was called in question
this was vniversally esteem'd before the covenant began the badge or mark of a christian and the principal foundation of the christian religion
the authority of it was held so sacred that it was an ordinary proverbe in mens mouth's when they would give great assurance of performing any thing they had promised that before they failed
they would as soone deny their creed
as it was called the apostles creed so it was taught for such
so it was believed and esteemed to be
it was publickly said in the church by parents at the baptisme of their children and it was required to be said by the people when they were catechized
but all these things were altered and overturned by the presbyterians
the authority and esteem of the creed was dash't by their denying it to be apostolicall and the custome of saying it both publikly privatly was taken away so that it was soone worne out both of vse and request
if they did this so easily with our lords prayer which is contain'd in scripture how much more easily would they do it with the creed which is not in scripture and which they pretend to be a meer humane collection and so in a short time they would get it to be altogether slighted as a humane invention and banished

out of the memories of men

wherefore being desirous to penetrat this matter more inwardly found after some diligence that the same grounds which can be brought for the apostolique authority of the scriptures are also brought and that in an eminent degree for the like authority of the creed
and therefore if we receive the one we cannot reiect the other
shall briefly collect what found or hath been shewed vnto me for the apostolique authority great excellency frequent laudable vse of this diuine symbol

cardinal baronius in the
tome of his annals doth shew by the testimony of the holy ancient fathers that the creed was composed by the holy apostles a little before they were to part and goe into several countries to preach the gospel vnto the gentils to the end there might be a certaine short clear rule of faith in which they all agreed wherein they were to instruct all persons and by which as by a certaine badge all christians might he knowen
for this cause it was not committed to writing but was delivered by lively voice and imprinted in the hearts of christians by the faithfull diligence of the apostles
this hierom

and augustin do testify
the first saith the symbol of our faith hope which was delivered by the apostles is not written in paper or inke but in the fleshly tables of the heart
the other affirmeth

that the creed was not written that it might be retain'd in the hearts of the faithfull
and againe he saith
the holy apostles did deliver a

certaine rule of faith which being comprehended in tuelve articles according to the number of the apostles they called a symbol by which the faithfull may hold catholique vnity and tread vnder feete heretical impiety
to these two great doctours

agrees also ambrose who saith the holy faith is contain'd in the symbol of the tuelve apostles who as skiful artificers meeting together haue made a key by common counsel
and againe let vs believe saith he the symbol of the apostles which the roman church doth ever preserve and keep's inviolate
and if we will ascend higher

ireneus bishop of lions and disciple of polycarpus sheweth that diverse nations believed without scriptures by tradition which certainly was of the apostles creed
clement the disciple of peter coadiutor of paul doth testify the same diverse other fathers may be seen cited in cardinal bellarmin tom
de verbo dei non scripto lib
cap

basil doth reckon the apostles creed as a principal apostolique tradition
and in a word found that all christian nations and ages have borne testimony of this truth

moreover found that in the primitive times this symbol was holden in so great reverence that in general councels it vsed to be first recited

and lay'd downe as the ground of the whole ecclesiastique building as baronius doth shew
to this purpose augustin calls it
the foundation of the catholique faith vpon which the edifice of the church built by the

hands of the prophets and apostles did rise

and leo saith that this short and perfect confession of the catholique symbol which is sealed by
sentences of the apostles is so furnished with heavenly armour that by this sword alone all opinious of heretiques may be cut of

as found such greet testimonies to prove the apostolique authority of the creed so did find that the holy fathers did highly praise the excellency of it as of a worke worthy of such diuine architects
augustin calls it
the comprehension perfection of our faith
it's simple saith he short full
that it's simplicity might serve the rudnesse it's shortnesse the memory its fulnesse the instruction of the hearers
elswhere he calls it the compend of the scriptures
lib
ad catech

and againe he saith this is a symbol briefe in words but large in mysteries
for whatsoever is prefigured in the patriarchs whatsoever is declared in the scriptures or foretold by the prophets is contain'd and briefly confessed in it
and in his sermon above cited de traditione symboli speaking of the creed he saith these are not humane words but heavenly mysteries of our lord
but most notable and efficacious are the words of rufinus to this purpose
the apostles

saith he being to part from one an other to preach they lay'd downe this marke of their faith and agreement not as the children of noe being to part from each other rearing vp a tower of bricke and slime whose top should reach vnto the heauens but building the fortresses of faith of liuely stones and heavenly pearles which should stand stedfast

against the face of the enemy which neither the winds should shake nor floodes subvert nor boysterous stormes or tempests move
they therefore being to separate building the tower of pride were deservedly punished with the confusion of tongues that not one could vnderstand the speech of his neighbour but these who built the tower of faith were endued with the skill and knowledge of all languages to the end that the one might be the marke of sin and the other the monument of faith
thus ruffinus

lastly the same holy fathers do shew the frequent laudable vse of the apostles creed in the primitive church
it was first taught and delivered vnto those who desired baptisme and it was required to be publickly said by them immediatly before their baptisme
this custome as ruffinus sheweth was carefully observed in the roman church

augustin also doth witnesse how the did say it in name of the infants whom they presented to baptisme and therefor he earnestly exhorts every christian when he comes to the yeares of discretion to say frequently the apostolique creed which he professed by the mouths of those who presented him to baptisme and call's it the mirrour of a christia render saith he your symbol render it vnto the lord be not weary to rehearse it the repetition of it is good least forgetfulnesse creep on thee
do not say said it yesternight said it to day say it every day haue it well
remember thy faith behold thy self let thy creed be a mirrour vnto thee there see thy self if

thou believe all that thou confesses thy self to believe and reioyce dayly in thy faith
let it be thy riches the dayly apparell of thy soule
do you not cloath your self when you rise so by remembering thy creed cloath thy soule least peradventure forgetfulnesse make it naked
ambrose calls it the seale of our heart which we ought dayly to review and the of a cristian

which should be in readinesse in all dangers

by all which irrefragable testimonies the sacred authority great excellency and frequent laudable vse both in publick and private of the apostles creed did appeare sufficiently vnto me
so that found for it the consent of peoples and nations the testimonies of the holy fathers the martyrs saints and christians of all ages that is of the vniuersal church the piller ground of truth which are the greatest assurances that can be had vpon earth
and therefore rested fully satisfyed with them
but was much more confirmed in this resolution when vnderstood by a serious conference with a friend that there was the same certainty for the creed that there is for the scriptures to witt the tradition or testimony of the church
augustin delivers clearly this truth concerning the scriptures
would not haue believed saith he the euangel unlesse the authority of the catholique church had moved me and that authority being once weakned neither can believe the euangel
this testimony authority of the catholique church was proved to me to be the most easy manifest and infallible

ordinary way that can be had on earth to come vnto the certaine knowledge of what books are scriptures yea it was clearly proved to be the only way so that if once this testimony be weakened there is nothing left but guessings wanderings after the manner of blind men as experience doth shew in the difference between the lutheranists the calvinists who agree in all their supposed wayes of knowing the scripture and yet can never agree in the same canon of the scriptures
but of this matter we shall haue occasion to speake more fitly hereafter in the question of the church

if then the scriptures cannot be certainly knowen but by the testimony authority of the church and are to be believed for the as augustin doth affirme the creed also may be knowen and ought to be believed to be apostolical for the same very reason since the same testimony authority are for both
yea the tradition testimony of the church for the apostles creed hath in a certaine manner some preeminence above that which is for the scripture
for it is more ancie~t more vniuersal more manifest
more ancient because the holy fathers and the whole church do constantly affirme that the symbol was composed by the apostles before any part of the new testament was written
it was more vniversal because it was received every where at the very first plantation of christianity whereas diverse parts of the scripture being directed

only to some particular churches could not be communicated but after some space to the whole church
it was also more manifest because there were some bookes of the scripture doubted of by some of the ancient fathers till the vniversal church did determin the canon of the sciptures but there was never any ancient christian who doubted of or denyed the apostles creed there was such a clear and vniversal tradition for it
and besides the creed in it self is very clear as being a short rule of faith ordain'd for the capacity of the most simple according to which the scriptures that are more obscure ought to be vnderstood

seing then the whole church in the primitive times and in all ages hath professed that the apostles made taught the creed it remaines most certaine that the apostles did teach it for greater certainty then this cannot be had
if the apostles taught and delivered it vnto the first christians then they being so taught were obliged to receive it with the reverence wherewith they did receive the scriptures which were delivered or directed vnto them by the same apostles
and if the first christia~s were so obliged why not also their children their childre~s children so downeward fro age to age vntill the end of the world shall haue the same obligation if this obligation held in the first age why not also in the second and in every succeeding age or when should this obligation cease or why more at

one time then at an other since the same assurance remaines at all times or why should it cease more for the creed then for the scripture since the same testimony is for both and if there be any preeminence in this matter the creed hath it as has been shewed

wherefore as was by these considerations fully satisfyed of the apostolique authority laudable vse of the creed in the primitive church so could in no wise approve the presbyterians innovations against it but rather did much admire of their presumption
for by their denying the creed to be apostolique saw they denyed the clear rule and endeavoured to subvert the very foundation of the christian faith
by their taking away both the publick and private vse of it they would haue robbed christians of the heavenly apparell and spiritual armour of their soules as the holy fathers above call it
and all this they do relying vpon no other grounds but their owne gesses which they oppose and would haue to be preferred to the constant testimony and irrefragable authority of the whole christian world
the iewes brought at least

sleeping witnesses against the resurrection of christ for which folly augustin mocks the and saith that they the~selves were sleeping and failed in their search
but the presbyterians bring neither sleeping nor waking witnesses and yet they will blindly iudge in a matter done above
hundred yeares ago and boldly pronounce sentence against an ancient fundamental truth which had been received professed

by the christians of all ages
but albeit the presbyterians do reiect the authority testimony of the church yet saw if they followed their owne principles they might as easily discern the creed to be apostolique as they pretend they can know the scriptures
for the maiesty of the style the harmony of the parts the purity of the doctrin and the like do concurre in the creed in an eminent degree as we haue seen above out of the holy fathers who do so highly praise it for its perfections as a worke worthy of such heavenly architects
and the matter being considered in it self the creed in all these qualities is equal if not superiour by outward apparance vnto the scriptures
for in them there are many seeming contradictions hard to be explained but none in this
many things in scripture not so full of maiesty as about pauls cloke

but the creed is totally replenished with most sublime divine mysteries
therefore if the presbyterians could by these marks discern the scriptures they might as easily discern the creed to haue been made by the apostles

albeit admired much how the presbyterians could vpon so weake grounds deny the apostles creed against such invincible authorities yet was much more stricken with admiration when considered what they brought in place of it
for in place of the apostles creed we got the presbyterians covenant
as that was denyed to be apostolical so this was cry'd vp to be divine for it was called

gods covenant the confession of faith
as parents were accustomed at the baptisme of their children to say the apostles creed in which they promised to bring them vp so now they were made promise to breede them in the covenant which was too long to haue by heart or to be repeated
this was truly a rare exchange to deny the creed to be apostolique to cry vp the covenant to be divine
to rob vs of a most ancient clear briefe positive sacred confession of faith made by the holy apostles famous in all ages vniversally received troughout the whole world full of great mysteries divine expressions and to give vs in place of it a new long obscure negative confession or rather confossion of faith full of terrible oaths execrations combinations devised by some few discontented heads by cunning and force obtruded vpon this nation much suspected at the beginning to be nothing but a meer pretence of religion as it was notoriously knowen to be a humane invention and as it's now at lenth after all its disguises manifested for such vnto the world
it's good fame hath not lasted long neither at home nor abroad
it got some footing in england by cunning and worldly interest but these soone failing it was quickly detected and reiected
the christlan moderator saith to this purpose
that the last reformation setled with so solemn a covenant and caried on with so furious a zeal is already by better lights discovered to be meerly humane therefore deservedly lay'd aside

therefore to conclude this point found clearly that the creed hath been alwayes held to be is apostolique that it is the foundation perfect rule of the christian faith that it is a worke worthy of the holy apostles that it is such a strong heavenly fabricke that it cannot be overthrowen by no stormes nor tempests by no force nor violences and that it overcomes all heresies that the ancient custome of saying it publickly at baptisme and often privatly and dayly is most laudable and profitable to christian people
and vpon the other part found that the presbyterians by denying the cred to be apostolique haue denyed the foundation clear rule of the christian faith most vnreasonably haue worne out both the publick private vse of it and that they compleated their new raformation when they not only reiected the creed but obtruded the covenant in place of it
and lastly found that as the presbyterians new doctrin in this matter is most erroneous and presumptuous so that all their endeavours have proved vaine frivolous
for that fortresse of faith which was built by the holy apostles of lively stones heavenly pearles as ruffinus speaks hath held out stronger tempests then the presbyterians weake blasts and therefore it still stands immoveable
whereas the babel of their covenant which they were so diligently building and vpon which they could never get the capstone as they often regrated hath ended in confusion and in a short space hath come to

ruine
now all these things being considered refer my self to any man voyde of passion if could reasonably much lesse christianly exchange the pearles of the apostles creed for the drosse of the presbyterians covenant

of the article of christs descent to hell perverted by the presbyterians

after that the presbyterians had thus endeavoured to shake the authority of the apostles creed least peradventure their small authority might not prevaile against all christianity what they could not get effectuated by denying the letter they laboured to performe by corrupting the sense and especially of that article he descended into hell
for in their new catechismes they interline or put on the margent this glosse with it
he descended into hell that is
he continued in the state of the dead and vnder the power of death till the third day

observed that although we had and said the words of the creed before the covenant began yet we did not know the true sense of it in this and some other articles albeit as augustin shewes it was made plaine short that it might serve the capacity vnderstanding memory of the simple
for there was a great quarrelling before these greater

troubles among some of the ministers for the sense of these words he descended into hell
some publickly taught that they behoved to be literally vnderstood of a real and local descent others of the preciser sort called that a papistical interpretation against which they did most sharply inveigh and taught according to calvin that the sense of them was that christ did suffer in his soule the horrible torments of a co~demned and forsaken man which glosse was called by the former ministers a horrible blasphemy
to come then to the true sense of this article about which there was such contrariety among the ministers had my recourse to the holy scriptures fathers and found that there was scarcely any article of our faith more clearly contain'd in the scriptures and more vnanimously avowed by the holy fathers who brand those who do not believe it literally with the name of infidels
and lastly found that diverse grosse wayes have been devised by the ministers since their pretended reformation to pervert and obscure it and when the falshood of one is discovered they alwayes find out an other but will never embrace the true sense of it

the light of reason doth shew to every christien that it is not sufficient for mans salvatian to hold the words of the creed but it is necessary also to follow the true sense of it
this the holy fathers do teach who shew likwise that as heretiques ever endeavoured to pervert

the true sense of the creed so the true church doth ever retaine maintaine it
cyril with the alexandrin synod writes to this purpose to nestorius who pretended to believe the nicen creed yet denyed the blessed virgin to be the mother of god
it's not sufficie~t saith he that you professe with vs the symbol of faith
for you do not vnderstand nor expound it rightly but rather perversly although you confesse the words of it with your tongue
augustin also saith to the like purpose
vnder the few words contained in the symbol many heretiques haue endeavoured to hide their poisons to whom the divine mercy hath resisted and doth resist by spirituall men who haue not only merited to believe and receive the catholique faith in these words but also by the revelation of god to vnderstand know it
so the presbyterians although they have denyed the creed yet vnder the words of it they endeavour to hide their poisons

although the article of christs descent to hell were not in the creed which is a clear and easy rule of faith that ought to be plainly and literally vnderstood yet it is so clearly in the scripture that it cannot be denyed without wresting of it
peter in his first sermon doth apply vnto christ

a prophesie of dauid in the psasme which saith my heart hath been glad my tongue hath reioyced my flesh also shall rest in hope
for thou wilt not leave my soule in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption

after peter hath proved that this prophely cannot be vnderstood of the

prophet dauid he sheweth that dauid mean't of christ in these words
whereas therefore he was a prophet forseeing he spake of the resurrection of christ
for neither was he left in hell neither did his flesh see corruption there is both the old new testament fot this truth
the prophet dauid foretelling and the apostle peter expounding and shewing the fulfilling of it to witt that christs soule was not left in hell neither did his flesh see corruption
what can be reasonably more required by any christian

but let vs heare augustin so vnderstanding it
that our lord saith he being mortifyed in the flesh did goe into hell is very certaine
for that prophecy which saith thou wilt not leave my soule in hell cannot be contradicted which least any man should presume to vnderstand otherwise the same peter doth expound it in the acts of the apostles
and then he concludes in these words quis ergo nisi infidelis who them except au infidel will deny christ to haue been in hell behold what in augustius iudgment are all presbyterians who do contradict the prophecy which he saith cannot be contradicted and who vnderstand it in a contrary sense which peter did expound least any man should presume to vnderstand it otherwise
which is indeed to goe against the scriptures both the old and new testament the prophets and apostles the holy fathers the whole church and in a word as augustin speaks to be infidels

hierome expounding that place of paul

in the to the ephesians and that he christ ascended what is it but because he descended also first into the lower parts of the earth saith the inferiour parts of the earth are taken for hell to which our lord saviour did descend
where it is also shewed for what end our saviour did descend
he saith paul ascending on high did leade captivity captive and gaue gifts to men
vpon which the same hierome saith our lord and saviour descended into hell that being victorious he might lead with himself the soules of those who were kep't there inclosed
whence it came to passe that after his resurrection many bodies of the iust were seen in the holy citie
the apostle sheweth the same truth in the
chapter to the collossians

where he saith
and christ spoyling the principalities powers hath ledde them confidently in open shew triumphing them in himself
passe by for brevities sake

some other passages as that of peter how christ in his spirit did goe downe and preach'd vnto the spirits in prison and the like which are vnderstood by some of the holy fathers of christs desce~t to hell these already brought appeared to me to be most clear sufficient
moreover found aug vnderstanding the words of christ to the good theefe this day thou shalt be with me in paradise far otherwise then the presbyterians do
for he saith non ex his verbis it is not to be thought by these words that paradise is in heaven for the man christ iesus was not to be in heaven to witt that day but in hell according to his soule

and in the grave according to his flesh
and a little beneath he subioynes the scripture clearly shewes that he was in hell according to his soule
but as the same holy father shewes out of the
psalme he was so in hell that he was free among the dead and did there begin his triumph over all infernal powers principalities and freeing the soules of the iust from their captivity did carrie them gloriously with himself vnto the heavens into which he did first enter and opened them vnto all true faithfull christians
for so it was fitting
that he who is the head of the body the church the beginning the first borne of the dead as paul speaks the first fruites of these who are asleep may in all things hold the primacie
know these things are laughed at as if they were fables by the presbyterians who founds their faith vpon their owne groundlesse fancies and will believe nothing which doth not suite to their humours albeit it be most clearly contain'd in the scriptures so vnderstood by the holy fathers and so believed by the christian world
but intend god willing to prefer these solid grounds to puritanical imaginations which are without yea and against scriptures the holy fathers and whole ancient church and lastly against the clear words of the creed

as saw the true and clear sense of this article so found that the ministers haue vsed many crooked windings turnings to obscure and deny the true sense of it
for first they haue

not stood to corrupt the letter of the scripture

they followed a sense invented by calvin which was not only false but by many esteem'd blasphemous

when for shame they had abandonned that sense the presbyterians haue of late invented a new one not so impious but very ridiculous
and lastly to compleate the work they haue denyed the whole creed to be apostolical which is the cleanliest way that hath been yet vsed

for their corrupting of the words of scripture beza calvins entire brother may cary the prize
for in the bibles of his translation he turnes these words
acts
thou wilt not leave my soule in hell after this manner
thou wilt not leave my body in the grave
and when this manifest corruption of gods word was obiected to him by protestants he answers in defence of his version against sebastian castalio

saying no man can doubt but here is mean't of the body grave vnlesse one would be blind in the
this must be a strange light or rather a strong illusion which the presbyterians alone see
but the reason which beza gives there a little before for his changing soule into body and hell into graves is very remarkable
did not this rashly saith he since we see that this place is chiefly wrested by the papists for establishing their limbe and the ancients also devised from it the descent of christs soule into hell
our presbyterians in scotland were one degree inferiour to beza for they did not corrupt two words as he did but only one as may be seen

in the great bibles printed at edinburgh by andrew hart where they reade thus the foresaid text thow wilt not leave my soule in the grave putting grave for hell which corruption was amended in the new translations that was made by order of king iames who said in the conference at that he had never seen a true and sincere translation of the bible in english but of all these he had seen that of geneva was the worst

having thus corrupted the text they did also invent corrupt senses of it
calvin the great foundator of presbytery vnderstands by christs descent to hell that he suffered in his soule the paines of a damned man and that doubting of his salvation he vtteted words of desperation
for thus he writes in his institutions
diros in anima cruciatus damnati ac perditihominis pertulit that is he suffered in his soule the horrible paines of a damned lost man
and writing on the
chap of mathew ver
he saith that a word of desperation did fall from christ
and a little after
sowe see saith he that he was vexed on all sides that being overwhelmed with desperation he ceased from calling vpon god which was to renounce salvation
most strange doctrine which find to be condemned by many as flat blasphemy and yet calvin esteem's so much this blasphemous fancy that he makes it the price of our redemption
for thus he writes nothing had been done if christ had onely dyed a corporal death but it was also requisite that he should feele the severity of the

wrath of god
and when this was obiected as a blasphemy by campian whitaker did second sustaine it

saying that calvin wrote most truly that nothing had been done if iesus christ had onely suffered a corporal death
yea he calls this a doctrin most full of comfort
these doctrines are so fals against the scriptures which shew nothing more frequently and clearly then that we are redeemed by the blood and death of christ and they are in themselues so absurd and blasphemous that we neede spend no more time in refutation of them for they are of the same kind with those of which hierome speaks when he saith
that to discover them is to vanquish them
yea some ptotestants have written against them as doctor bilson of winchester in his booke

which he intitles the full redemptein of mankind by the death and blood of christ and in the defence of the article that christ descended into hell
but notwithstanding all the grosse absurdities of this sense invented by calvin yet it was generally followed by the presbyterians and by many other protestants who denyed the local descent of christs soule to hell
for although it sounded very ill yet it behooved to be kep't by the presbyterians for want of a better vntill a new one more commodious was found out which now lately hath been performed by the new reformers of these times who see further and more clearly then calvin who although he was famous in his owne generation and was reputed to be an apostle sent extraordinarly

by god to reforme the church yet did not so much as know his catechisme nor the true sense of the articles of his creed but invented such a sense as some of his disciples haue abandonned it as false and others as blasphemous

as beza in his version of the scripture turned hell into grave so he vnderstood this article of the creed he descended into hell that is he descended into the grave
which errour together with the former coruption invented by calvin a learned minister in edinburgh did publickly refute in divers sermons a little before the troubles for which he was much persecuted by the puritans
he shew that bezas corruption made a grosse tautology in the apostles creed or it made an explication more obscure then the thing it explained
the tautology would be very grosse to say crucifyed dead and buryed he descended into the grave that would be twice buryed
or if you make descending into hell the explication of burial that is a rare commentary to explicate a matter which is cleare and needs no co~mentary by that which is more obscure and cannot yet be rightly vnderstood by protestants as appeares by their dissensions
the same minister shew that both these vices were against the end of the creed and the wisdome of the holy apostles who made it short and plaine that it might serve the capacity of all men and therefore it was to be free of idle tautologies and obscure commentaries
but at that time

this minister did not know that the presbyterians were to deny the creed to haue been composed by the apostles by which his arguments are answered although by falling into grosser absurdities

the third sense devised by the presbyterians at westminster is subiect to the like inconveniences that is both of tautologies and obscure glosses
for they say by that article he descended into hell is vnderstood that he continued in the state of the dead and vnder the power of death till the third day
for first it would be a tautology to say dead and buryed and then repeate againe he remained dead or in the power of death that is sufficiently knowen by the words that follow to witt the third day he arose from the dead
for he behoved to remaine dead so long as he was dead and he was dead till the third day that he arose from the dead
so that the addition of he descended into hell vnderstood in the ministers new coyned sense would not be onely superfluous but also ridiculous
then if they will make christs descent to hell an explication of christs remaining dead the commentary would be more obscure then the text which is clear of it self
how would the presbyterians be pleased if one would say of iohn calvin or knox or of their late apostle henderson that they are dead buryed descended into hell and if this man being accused before the presbytery would bring in his owne defence the ministers new commentary

that he meaned only by these words that they remained in the power state of death because they are not as yet risen from the dead
am morally perswaded what ever commentary could be brought either their owne or any other the presbyterians would be ill pleased with such a text and would thinke it was sufficient to haue said that they were dead and buryed without this addition
they descended into hell

but of all the expositions that ever found on this article that of the late protestant bishop vsher is the rarest which vane speaking of the ministers iuglings describes thus
what serpentine wriglings and windings to escape the assaulters do they make what perverse ridiculous and contradicting answers and evasions do some of them make in which they shew at once both much wit and much folly
for fooles could not speake as they do and wise men would not
in so much that vsher primat of armagh a very learned man to avoid the confession of christs descent into hell according to the article of the creed in the plaine sense thereof doth so turne it and wind it that he makes the sense of the words he descended into hell to be he ascended into heaven
to such pitifull refuges doth the weaknesse of a bad cause drive them
thus he
and so by this bishops commentary for descend we haue ascend and for hell heaven
but all these senses being nowayes satisfactory the presbyterians tooke the cleanliest easiest way to deny the creed it self to be apostolique

that so men might not care much or take great notice of the sense when all authority is taken from the text
that shift might in some manner serve their turne if this truth were not as expresly in the scripture as it is in the creed

now would inquire at any man of conscience or ordinary discretion who will consider impartially these things what should do in this case should believe the presbyterians who haue no scripture for them in this point but in expresse words against them should give credit to those who to maintaine their errour did first manifestly corrupt the words of scripture with false translations and thereafter did pervert the sense of them with blasphemous interpretations should believe those who although they quitted their first sense of blasphemy did invent another full of tautology not so impious but very ridiculous
and who last of all to compleate the worke did deny their creed or should believe the old and new testament the prophets foretelling and the holy apostles expounding the holy fathers so vnderstanding the whole primitive church assisted by the spirit of truth so believing and professing and last of all should believe my creed which the whole christian world did receive as a most perfect plaine rule of faith composed by the holy apostles for the capacity of all men must professe that after such a triall could not put these authorityes in the ballance together

much lesse could prefer the presbyterians inconstant new opinion to the ancient constant beliefe of the whole world vnlesse would haue renounced both reason conscience

a reflection on the last and an entrance into the triall of the first supposed reformation

having by the divine grace by the former considerations discovered as well the falshood of the forsaid presbyterian innovaons as the ancient truth of the catholique doctrine was advised and much encouraged to make the like triall of the principal points of our first reformation as concerning the commandements our iustification the nature effect of the sacrame~ts
for was represented vnto me that there was no lesse pretext of pure scripture and a like lowd cryes of a great engyring light for the last then was for the first reformation
and seing by the former triall had discovered these last pretences to be false why may not haue some confidence to do the like with the first if would vse the ke diligence and if the last reformers haue been mistaken and misled by passion why might not also their predecessours over see themselves too or what assurance can any man haue of

their infallibility more then of the others the alterations that haue been lately made by the presbyterians do shew even in their iudgment that their first reformers were not infallibly assisted

was put in mind that had found lately some of the most eminent among them to be corrupters or as paul speakes adulterers both of the letter and sense of the scriptures and therefore they are not to be altogether trusted without trial
in a word great promises and assurances were made to me that would by this triall find out the falshood of the first as had done of the last reformation
by that means might attaine vnto the possession of solid truth whereon might safely rely for the good of my soule
as truth can endure iust trial and desires nothing more by which it is more manifested so falshood cannot abide triall but alwayes shuns it because thereby it's deceits are detected

lastly it was showen vnto me that the ancient pastours of the church did most wisely reduce the whole substance of the christian doctrin which is of it self so large and plenteous into these
heads to witt the apostles creed the sacraments the divine commandements and our lords prayer for all things which belong either vnto the knowledge of god the creation and governement of the world or the redemption of mankind the rewards of the good or the punishments of the wicked are contain'd in the apostolique creed
the signes and instruments which

god hath instituted for attaining grace are the holy sacraments
the divine commandements shew what we ought to do and our lords prayer doth containe all what we can wish or desire
and therefore these are as it were the foure great pillars wheron the whole fabricke of christianity relyes
now it was told me how had found by the former triall that this last pretended reformation had overturned two of these pillars· to witt the apostles creed the lords prayer besides the fundamental governement established by christ in his church
if then should find also that the first reformation had overturned the other two pillars to witt the divine commandements the holy sacraments then might conclude that the end and intent of these reformations what ever was the intention of the reformers hath been vnder the pretence of reformation totall deformation and the destruction of the christian religion and that betwixt them they haue compleated that hydeous worke of desolation
for if the first refomation tooke away two as the next hath taken away other two then they both together have subverted so far as they could the
great pillars of christianity and the last presbyterian reformation hath compleated what the first had begun and had not perfected

begun then the trial of our first reformation with it's doctrin concerning the divine commandements and specially of the impossibility to keepe them which was taught by

our first and is yet maintain'd by our last reformers
for it was showen to me if the commandements of god were possible to be keept as all wise and iust lawes are ordain'd for that end that they may be observed then we by teaching they were impossible to be keep't destroyed the very end for which the commandements were made and so destroyed the commadements themselues
chap

of the possibility to keepe the divine commandements with the assistance of gods grace denyed by the presbyterians and their first reformers

had for some space a preiudicate opinion in this matter against the catholique doctrin which affirmed as the ministers taught that it was possible for any man to keep all the divine commandements yea and to do more then god had commanded
conceived that to be false
for since no man to my knowlege or their owne confession had kep't them all or doth keep them thought it not possible they could keep them
for it would seeme if a thing were possible some one among so many thousands would put it in act
vpon the other part was not well satisfyed with our owne doctrine which teacheth that it is altogether impossible to keep the commandements of god

by reason of a dangerous consequence which a catholique made me see to follow thervpon to witt that so many thousands should be damned for not doing that which was vtterly impossible for them to do
wondered how that could stand with the goodnesse iustice of god
for greater tyranny iniustice cannot be imagined then to punish one with eternal misery and grievous paines for not doing that which was altogether impossible for him to do
the light of nature would not permit me to impute such cruelty to god whose goodnesse mercy knew to be vnspeakable

hauing therefore seriously implored the divine assistance that might come to the knowledge of the truth received the first sparke of light in this matter by knowing the true state of the question
for found that the roma catholiques did not teach that men were able of themselves that is by their owne strenth or by any natural power to keep the divine commandements but only they teach that men are able to keep them by the assistance of gods grace now that particle of divine grace was ordinarly suppres't by the ministers in this question
and when knew this to be the true meaning and expresse doctrin of the catholiques as may be seen

in the councel of trent session
canon
imagined there was no real controversy till found in the new presbyterian catechisme a particular exception made against gods grace
for hauing there made this question is any man able perfectly

to keep the commandements of god they answer no man is able either of himself or by any grace received in this life perfectly to keep the commandements of god but doth dayly break them in thought word deed
and in the answer to the third question thereafter they say that every sin even the least deserveth gods wrath and curse both in this life and that which is to come
this booke is very obscure in most points but here it speaks somewhat clearly although againe by foysting in the word perfectly it seemes to cast a mist over our ey's that the authours of it may lurke in their obscurities as we shall see hereafter
found the catholique doctrin to be contrary set down in these termes by the councel of trent if any man say that the commandements of god are impossible to be kep't by a man even iustifyed and constituted vnder grace let him be accursed

being therefore desirous to know the truth began first to consider the testimonies of scripture for the strenth of gods grace to enable men to keep his commandements which testimonies found to be very strong and expresse

saw that god promisheth clearly in the scriptures to enable men to keep his commandements yea and to make them actually keep them

god saith in ezechiel will put my spirit within you and cause yow to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my iudgment and do them
and againe he saith they shall be my people and will be their god and david my servant shall be king over them

they shall also walk in my iudgments keep my commandements and do them
where nothing is more clear then that god hath promised to enable men to keep his commandements
but gods promises are true for he is faitfull

as abraham the father of the faithfull did professe believe and whatsoever he hath promised he is able and willing to perform
therefore his promises which are ever true haue been truly faithfull fulfilled and so consequently some by the help of gods grace haue actually kept his commendements
therefore they are not impossible but possible to be kept by the grace which god giveth in this life

secondly found in the scriptures a real performance of this promise for some are recorded there by name to haue actually kept the commandements of god
luke giveth this excellent testimony of zachary elyzabeth the parents of iohn baptist they were both iust before god walking in all the commandements ordinances or as it is in the catholique translation the iustifications of our lord blamelesse
so that they were not only iust before men but also before god and they did not only walk in one but in all the commandements of god without blame

the scripture also calls noe a iust and a perfect man
enoch elias were so iust holy that they are said in the scripture to haue walked before god and were translated
iob is also called in the scriptures a perfect vpright man one that feared god eschewed evil

but most clearly is the iustice of abraham exalted by the mouth of god himself who said to his son isaac will perform the oath which sware vnto abraham thy father
in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed
because that abraham obeyed my voice kept my precepts my commandements my ceremonies my lawes
what can be more clear to prove the possibility of keeping gods commandements with the help of his grace and to disprove the impossibility of observing them
for what is impossible to be done by men even with the assistance of gods grace no man hath done or will do
but god himself and the scriptures shew that divers haue kept gods commandements
therefore with the help of his grace they are possible not impossible to be kept
yea it appeared most consonant vnto all reason piety that if the commandements were possible and were actually kept by gods grace in the law of nature under the law of moyses they should be more possible and more easy to be kept vnder the law of grace when by the fulnesse of christs redemption grace is more plentifully powred forth and in which time

the prophet esay foretells that the light of the moon should be as the light of the sun the light of the sun should be sevenfold as the light of seven dayes

thirdly found the scripture to be so far from affirming the commandements of god to be impossible that they avow the clear contrary yea and more then the contrary
for a

thing to be impossible is much more then to be hard or difficult
what is impossible to men cannot be done by any man what is hard not impossible may be done although with difficulty
now the scriptures affirmes that the commandements of god are easy which is not so much as difficult and therefore much lesse are they impossible
christ saith take my yoke vpon you
for my yoke is easy my burden is light
and iohn a most faithfull interpreter of our saviours words affirmes that gods commandements are not heavy
this is the love of god saith he that we keep his commandements and his commandements are not heavy
and againe he that saith he knoweth god keepeth not his commandements is a liar truth is not in him
what is easy light not heavy is neither hard heavy nor impossible
but the commandements of god are an easy yoke a light burden they are not heavy as our saviour his beloved disciple do affirme
therefore they are not hard nor heavy and much lesse are they impossible
yea found it was the love of god that made the commandements which seeme so hard and difficult to others to be easy vnto the saints
david saith

that the commandements of god were more sweete then the honey or the honey comb and againe did run in the way of thy commandements when thou didst enlarge my hart
moreover all the children of god love christ and they who love him as himself testifyeth keep his words

and iohn saith this is the of love god that we keep his

commandements
therefore hauing diligently considered these testimonies of the scripture found that the scripture was clearly for the possibility of keeping gods commandements with the assistance of his grace as the catholiques teach and against the impossibility of observing them as the prerbyterians almost all protestants hold
wherevpon tooke occasion to admire at two things
first how it was possible that all the points of our religion are expressly in scripture and that the contrary points maintain'd by the papists are not in scripture but condemned by it since vpon serious triall found the scripture to be in this matter so clearly against vs
did no lesse admire that reading frequently the scriptures before this search did not till now observe our doctrin to be contrary vnto it
but a catholique to whom imparted my thoughts some space thereafter did quickly free me of these admirations by shewing me the reasons of both
the first said he is not to be much admired
for if the first reformers had not pretended that all their new doctrines were expressly in the scriptures they had got no followers and if the ministers did not continue to make the same pretence there would be few or none so foolish as to abide with them
this same pretence of scripture all heretiques have ever made although their errours were clearly against scripture and this pretence they must all make if they intend to find any credit
the reason also of the second said he is no lesse

evident for it's no wonder that till of late yow did not find your doctrin to be contrary vnto the scriptures because you did reade them before very superficially without solid reflexion attention as the most part of protestants do and many also reade them with preiudicate opinions framing their faith vnto the scripture but wresting the scripture vnto their errours
that is not to search the scriptures to which our saviour did exhort the iewes who contented themselves with the like superficiall reading of them and therefore could find nothing of christ in them
but he shew if they would search that is reade diligently consideratly they would find that the scriptures bare testimony of him
the like may be said truly of the catholique church religion that if the protestants would search the scriptures they would find therein sufficient and clear testimonies of them
thus spake the catholique

but although the above cited testimonies of the scripture appeared sufficiently clear vnto me yet least relying vpon my own iudgment might be deceived had my next recours after the scriptures to the exposition of the holy fathers to the beliefe of the holy primitive church
from which the old episcopal ministers did affirm that the papists were altogether degenerated and we were made by them to believe that as our doctrin was conform to the scriptures so it was also conforme to the holy fathers who were all said to be of our

religion true protestants
but to speak mildly whithout any exaggeration found that to be a grosse vntruth and that the puritans who either not claime the holy fathers or yeeld them vnto the papists are much more ingenuous in this matter then the old protestants as shall be seen god willing in the progresse of this triall
concerning the possibility of keeping the divine commandements found three things to be clearly contayned in the holy fathers

they affirm that the catholique doctrin is expressed in the scriptures which they did so vnderstand and expound

they prove it by the light of reason drawen from the nature iustice of god
they not only condemn the contrary that is presbyterian doctrin as an heresy but they accurse it as a blasphemy against god

in proose of the first crysostom brings these words of our saviour above cited my yoke is easy and my burden is light

and saith
christ self hath truely affirmed of his co~mandements that there is nothing laborious nothing troublesome in them saying my yoke is easy my burden is light and we on the contrary make them heavy which he hath made light and what he hath made sweete we make bitter by sinning
if there were any thing laborious in the commandements deservedly and decently labour should accompany vertue for rewards are propounded after labours
and elswhere he explaines the same words daintily thus
hearing my precepts to be a yoke be not affray'd

for it is replenished with rare delight
neither feare ye that name it a burden for it is light
how then said he before the gate to be narrow and the way to be straight through tribulation that is when thou art drowsie or a dastard but when with courage thou doest that work then the burden shall be light augustin proves by these words of iohn and his commandements are not heavy that the commandements are not only possible but also easy and he shewes that it is the love of god which makes them light the want of that love that makes them seem heavy
the precepts of god saith he are good if we vse them lawfully
for in so much as it is believ'd most firmely that god who is iust good cannot command impossible things· therevpon we are admonished what we are to do in easy matters and in difficult what to request pray for for all are made easy to charity to which alone the burden of christ is light or it is the burden it self which is light according to that which is said
and his commendements are not heavy
and let him to whom be heavy consider that it could not haue been said in holy scripture they are not heavy vnlesse there could be such a disposition of heart to which they are not heavy and let him pray for that which is commanded and a little after how can that be heavy which is the commandement of charity
for either a man doth not love and then the command is heavy or else he doth love and then it cannot be heavy
in which words divers notable things are contayn'd
took notice principally of these

that he saith

the possibility of keeping the commandements is most firmely believed

he doth not only prove it by scriptures but also by the nature of god that he who is iust good could not command things impossible

that the commandements of god are heavy to those who want the love of god but they are light to those who haue it
yea the same holy doctour shewes by the testimony of paul that christ came into the world and lay'd down his life for this end that he might obtaine grace vnto vs whereby we might be enabled to keep the commandements of god which were before so hard difficult

thus speaks paul
for that which was impossible to the law in that it was weakened by the flesh god sending his son in the similitude of the flesh of sin for sin co~demned sin in the flesh that the iustice of the law might be fulfilled in vs who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit

vpon which words augustin saith the law was given that grace might be sought after and grace was given that the law might be fulfilled for not by any fault of the law the law was not fulfilled but by the wisdom of the flesh which fault was to be shewed by the law but to be cured by grace
for that which was impossible for the law hierom brings the same place of
paul against the pelagians to prove that man is not able by his own strenth or free will

but only by the grace of christ to keep the law of god
behold there the catholique doctrin affirmed by the holy fathers not of their own heads but proved by the scriptures
and

that this was the general beliefe of the holy fathers of the ancient church it was made appeare vnto me by the second arausican councel celebrated about augustins time

which makes this profession we believe according to the catholique faith that by grace received in baptisme all such as are baptized christ helping cooperating may and ought to fulfill if they will labour faithfully these things that belong to salvation
so it is evident that the holy fathers ancient church believed this doctrin to be contain'd in the scriptures which is sufficient for my purpose

this same truth is confirmed by augustin not only by the scriptures but also by reason
some one may say saith he can by no means love my enemies
to which he answer's thus
god saith to thee in all the scriptures that thou canst
consider now whether thou or god ought to be believed and therefore since truth cannot lie let humane weaknesse forbeare it's vaine excuses
for he who is iust could not command any thing that's impossible and he who is good will never condemne man for that which he could not avoid
so that according to augustin the presbyterians beliefe is not only against all the scriptures although they pretend to believe nothing beside scriptures but also against sound reason that is against both the iustice goodnesse of god

hierome also affirmeth that these who say that god hath commanded any thing impossible pronounce god to be vniust

moreover the same two most renowned

holy fathers do not only teach the catholique doctrin but also they censure the contrary that is the presbyterians opinion as blasphemy in the heretiques of their time
we accurse saith augustin their blasphemy that affirm god commanded any thing impossible to man and that gods commandements cannot be kept of any man in particular but of all men taken together
the same is repeated by hierome
so that these holy fathers do iudge this errour not only to be an heresy but also a blasphemy
and yet these new reformers which is a thing most admirable deplorable make such blasphemies the principall articles of their faith and they haue also most tyrannically enforced others vnder pretext of giving them only pure scripture to swear believe such horrible errours and blasphemies for divine truths
but found that some more prudent and conscientious protestants haue abandoned this wicked calvinisticall opinion yea and condemned it as the holy fathers had done for blasphemy
mr shelford a minister in england hath written a treatise expresly on this matter

to prove the possibility of the law with the assistance of gods grace where he censures the contrary opinion by the scriptures fathers by the authority of king iames
for this he speaks
king iames vpon the lords prayer affirmeth it to be blasphemy to say that any of christs precepts are impossible because this is to give him the lie who out of his own mouth told vs that his yoke is easy his burden light
and his inward disciple

saith his commandements are not grievous whence basil the great averreth
impious it is to say the precepts of gods spirit are impossible
thus he
behold

what the presbyterians do esteeme a principal article of their faith how a learned protestant whose booke came forth in the yeare
with great applause in cambridge and king iames who was head of the church of england do condemne as blasphemy impiety a giving the lie to god
heare also that some of the new independent congregations in england do no lesse sharply condemn the same presbyterian opinion

but besides all these pressing authorities found also some convincing reasons against the presbyterians which will briefly collect

it cannot stand with the goodnesse and justice of a lawgiver such as god is to impose vpon people lawes which are impossible to be kept then to punish them with losse of goods and life for not observing these impossible lawes
the greatest tyrant on earth did never arrive to that hight of impiety cruelty
therefore it is impossible that god who is good iust should commit such cruelty iniustice
to this accordeth augustin in his words above cited when he saith
god could not command any thing impossible because he is iust neither will he damne a man for that which he could not avoid because he is mercyfull
yea these absurdities of iniustice and cruelty would follow against the goodnesse of god in a high degree in how much the punishment he inflicts is greater·

then can be inflicted by man although greatest tyrant on earth
for what is the lo of temporall goods and life in comparison of the losse of heaven and of the death both of soule body in the eternal paines of hell therefore it's no wonder that the holy fathers some protestants do detest the presbyterian doctrin as extream blasphemy

it doth not only incroach vpon the goodnesse iustice of god but also vpon his wisdome
for as it's certaine that god made these lawes so it's no lesse evident in the scriptures that god vseth admonitions exhortations propounds rewards and threatens punishements to induce men to observe his lawes
now what magistrate would be esteemed to be in his right wits who would not only make lawes impossible to be kept but also spend time in making exhortations propounding rewards to perswade men to do impossibilities but the presbyterian doctrine makes god who is not only wise but wisdome it self subiect to both these follies which are most grosse absurdities
and therefore since his lawes admonitions exhortations cannot be but prudent reasonable they do ever suppose the possibility of that which they enioyne and wherevnto they exhorte

the presbyterian doctrine is not only iniurious to god but also it is very preiudiciall to man for it would rob him of the most excelcellent of all vertues to witt the love of god
for none can love another vnlesse he be good iust or at least appeare to be so
but how

can god appeare to be so who is described by the presbyterians as if he were the most cruel tyrant in the world to command impossibilities then to punish man eternally for not doing them therefore if the prerbyterian doctrine were true no man could love god as good gratious but rather would hate him as vniust tyrannous

the presbyterian opinion is a great enemy to piety vertue
for if the commandements be impossible none will strive to keep them and by this meanes a wide gate is opened to all impiety
this is acknowledged by the forementioned minister shelford who saith were the law impossible to be kept then all the exhortations threatnings in gods word should be idle then all mens labours would wax lazie then good life which is after the rule would be exiled for that no man will strive against the stream
wherefore great enemies are they to christian growth reward in the way of godlinesse who are against this doctrine to witt of the possibility to keep the commandements
lastly if the law were impossible then all men would be freed from subiection obedience to it for who can be reasonably tyed to things meerly impossible and this was the vse that islebius one of luthers schollers made of his doctrine wherevpon he began the sect of the as sleidan doth testify in the
book of his history

having therefore found such clear testimonies of scriptures fathers such weight of right reason for the ancient catholique doctrine

could not either in reason or conscience reiect all these and follow the presbyterians groundlesse fancies which are against the very ground of faith to witt the holy scriptures
for the presbyterians do teach that the commandements are impossible even with gods grace and the scripture saith they are easy light not heavy which is more then if it had affirmed that they were meerly possible
againe the presbyterians by affirming the commandements are impossible do averre that never any did keep them doth or shall keep them
the scripture shewes in expresse termes that abraham zachary elizabeth and others did keep them and that god hath promised many should keep them
iohn affirmeth that he who saith he knoweth god keepeth not his commandements is a liar the truth is not in him
the presbyterians do professe that they know god and that they neither do nor can keep his commandments and yet they will not be esteemed liars but rather true professours
for my part am not able to reconcile such manifest contradictions as are in this matter betwixt the scriptures the presbyterians
and therefore seing cannot adhere to both choosed rather to abandon the presbyterians in matter then to forsake the scriptures
was much confirmed in this resolution when saw the catholique doctrine and sense of the scriptures to be so clearly in the holy fathers that by no shifts their testimonies can be shunned
but will add to these testimonies already brought

one or two more which seem'd to me very clear efficacious how pray you saith sainct augustin is it impossible vnto man to love to love say a bountifull creator a most loving father and then also to love his own flesh in his brethren but he who loves has fulfilled the law as the apostle teacheth
wherefore the same holy father admiring the great goodnesse bounty of god

who requires nothing of vs but to love him who is so good in himself and so gracious to vs he speaks thus vnto him
what is man that thou wilt haue thy self to be beloved by him and if he do not love thee thou threatens him with great punisments but is not this punishment great enough if do not love thee chrysostome to the like purpose saith god commanded nothing impossible in so much that many go beyond the very commandments
and then he sheweth who these were to witt paul peter even all the quire of saints
lastly the holy fathers do not only prove the catholique doctrine by the scriptures and most solid reason founded vpon the goodnesse iustice of god but they condemne also the contrary opinion as a flat blasphemy against god
which censure is approved likewise by some protestants
truly cannot resist these reasons authorities and follow the presbyterians to make a doctrine which is against the scriptures and is condemned as blasphemy by the holy fathers by some protestants a principal article of my faith
chap
xiv
a consideration of the presbyterians principall grounds against the possibility of keeping the divine commandements
having received aboundant satifaction in this matter concerning the catholique doctrin will briefly run through the presbyterians principal grounds against it which in this search did not leave vnconsidered

found they acknowledged the novelty of their doctrine

they brought no pure scripture to prove it notwithstanding they pretend to believe nothing but scripture

the scriptures they bring are privatly expounded by them against the holy fathers ancient church against the scriptures themselves in other places

they lay down some false maximes and weak reasons whereon they build their imaginary faith or rather most dangerous errour

calvin acknowledges the novelty singularity of his doctrine

in these words
that we said the observation of the law to be impossible is briefly to be explained confirmed for it was wont commonly to be esteemed a most absurd opinion in so much as hierome did not doubt to denounce a curse to it but care nothing what hierome thought

the centuriators also of magdeburg do acknowledge the same that the most ancient fathers as iustin martyr tertullian

cyprian many more did affirme that the law was possible to be kept
this confession of calvin the centurists did manifest sufficiently vnto me the antiquity of this catholique doctrine that it was no late invention of the popes as the ministers were wont to pretend falsly of the whole catholique religion

then for scripture they cannot bring so much as one place which containeth expresly the article of their beliefe to witt that the commandements are impossible to be kept even with all the grace that goh gives in this life
calvin brings these words of our saviour
thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy strenth wherevpon he his followers do scance after this manner
to love god with all our heart requires all the faculties of out soule to be alwayes applyed vnto the love of god which none can do
from which they inferre that we are so far from being able to keep all the commandments that we cannot so much as keep the first
in answer to which a catholique shew me that he did acknowledge the words of scripture but that calvins private interpretation inference vpon them is no scripture

he said that besids that calvins glosses consequences were no scripture they were not to be much regarded since they were against the holy fathers who will be prefer'd to him in the iudgment of all wise men

they are lesse to be regarded or rather much to be detested seing they are expresly against the scriptures themselves in

other places
for calvin saith that none can love god with all his heart and david saith in the scripture

speaking to god
haue sought thee in my whole heart
and god himself approves this testimony to be true when he gave order to the prophet to say to ieroboam thou hast not been as my servant david who kept my commandements and followed me with his whole heart

the scripture saith also of iosias that he turned vnto the lord in all his heart in all his soule and in all his might according to all the law of moyses
therefore it's false against scriptures themselves what calvin saith that it is impossible for any to love god with all his heart and consequently his interpretation of the love of god

is also false
shelford a protestant minister saith we love god with all our heart when we preferre him above all the world and above our lives as the martyrs did when we will not offend god not part from his love for the love or feare of no creature
this is the love of god with all our heart which is here commanded wherevnto we are obliged which by gods grace may be by vs fulfilled as it was done by abraham zachary elyzabeth
for how could the scripture say that they kept all the commandements walked in them blamelesse if they had not kept the first greatest of all the commandements the absolute highest perfection of loving god is neither commanded nor can be exercised in this life but can only be attayn'd to in the heavens where the fulfilling of it as augustin speaks

is not obedience but happinesse
thus spake the catholique with more words whereby received good satisfaction


the presbyterians pretend it is impossible to keep this other commandment thou shall not covet
because they say that here is forbidden all motion of concupiscence although involuntary albeit we resist vnto it whereof none in this life can be free

to which find the same shelford answer saying that the consent of the will is only forbidden here the cherishing of the first motion to sin according to the scripture every where let not sin reigne in your mortel bodies and go not after thy concupiscences to fulfill the lusts therof

touching which matter augustin saith most clearly as for vs we would ever be without sin till this evil of concupiscence were healed if we did not consent vnto it to evil
therefore not to consent vnto concupiscence is no sin and by the grace of god we may not consent and therefore we may keep that commandment
thou shalt not covet


they bring these words of iohn
if we say we have no sin we deceive our selves the truth is not in vs moreover salomon saith the iust man falls
times a day
from which they inferre that it is impossible to keep the commendemens so much as one day
remember that a catholique answered me obiecting these places to him against the possibility of the commandments and said that there was this difference between the catholiques the protestants

that the protestants make the scripture to contradict it self neither haue they any probable way nor care they much how to reconcile these contradictions but think it sufficient to lay hold on that which they imagine makes for them
as here because
iohn saith if we say that we have no sin we deceive our selves they conclude that it's impossible to keep the commandments whereas the scripture shewes that abraham zachary elizabeth kept the commandments and therefore they make the scripture say as much as if it said they kept the commandments they kept not the commandments which are flat contradictions
but catholiques clearly shew that one may keep the commandments as abraham others did yet not be free of sin because the scripture affirmeth both
these two truths are not contrary one to another as the presbyterians do imagine
for one doth keep the commandments who doth nothing against charity or the love of god which is the end of the commandments as paul affirmes and that only is properly a breach of the commandments which breaketh love friendship with god
but that is only done by mortal or grievous sins not by light or venial faults such as an idle inoffensive word a little immoderate laughter

such like as augustin reckons out in his booke of nature and grace
for such lights faults do not break friendship with god since they do it not reasonably with men
now by the grace of god men may be free of mortal sins although not of venial imperfections

therefore they may keep the commandments yet not be free of sin
this truth is clearly delivered by augustin
as no man saith he ever hath been or ever shall be without small offences so we by gods help aid may and ought to be without any manner of capital crimes
and again he shewes that albeit zachary kept all the commandments yet he was not without sin for being a priest he was to offer vp sacrifice not only for the sins of others but also for his own sins as paul affirmes whereas christ iesus was the only priest who being free of all sin did offer vp sacrifice only for the sins of others
et elswhere he saith because sin doth often steal vpon vs in light matters sometimes vnawares they were both iust and not without sin
so that by the distinction of mortal venial sin which is sufficiently expressed by our saviour when he said who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of iudgment
who shall say raca shall be in da~ger of a councel
and who shall say thou foole shall be guilty of
which is also clearly contain'd in the holy fathers and is consonant to right reason these places of scripture which shew that some kept the comma~dments the others which teach that the iust are not alwayes without sin are both true easily reconciled
but the presbyterians quite the first and to maintaine their errour adhere only to the last which they also falsly expound against the sense of the holy fathers the very words of the other scriptures

after these principal scriptures which they

bring

considered next their chiefe maximes reasons
luther calvin do teach that all the best actions even of the greatest saints are mortal sins and the presbyterians do generally insist in the same doctrine
from which indeed it followes very clearly if it were true that the commandments are impossible to be kept
will bring a protestant minister giving his iudgmens of this doctrine which was taught by his two first apostles
it may be obiected saith shelford in his foresaid treatise that the very best works of the saints are vnclean impure menstruous mortall sins therefore it is impossible for any man to keep the law
answer saith he they that say so cannot in my iudgment be excused from extream blasphemy yet seeing it is out of ignorance they may happily obtaine pardon as the iews did who crucifyed our saviour
can the works the fruits of the holy ghost be impure hath christ purchased to himself nothing but a filthy impure generation which can do nothing but sin and that mortally how can this but derogate from the grace wisdome of god from grace that it cannot purify the heart from filthinesse from his wisdome iustice to reward menstruous rags for so they term them with heaven thus he
so that in his iudgemens this maxime of luther calvin is not only false but also blasphemous against the merits of christ the power of his grace

it is likwise clearly against the scripture
for paul saith if a virgin marry she sinneth

not but if we believe the presbyterians she sinneth whether she marie or marie not
christ saith of mary magdalene she hath wrought a good work on me
but if these men speak true she wrought an evill work
in a word found their words to be against christs words and the holy scriptures

found also that their reasons were very vnsolid as for example when they say none doth keep the commandments therefore none can keep them
for although the antecedent were true the consequence is very false
and it is iust as you would say adam did not keept gods commandment in paradise therefore he was not able by gods grace to keep it which is most ridiculous a false kinde of reasoning for we can do many things with the help of gods grace which we do not
hierome clears this matter when writing against the pelagians he saith god hath commanded things possible of this no man doubts but because men do not these things that are possible therefore all the world hath need of the mercy of god

then when expresse scripture is produced shewing that diverse haue actually kept the commandments haue heard some presbyterians say that no such men are living now a dayes
this they do iudging all men by themselves of such persons hierome saith many iudging the commandments of god by their own weaknesse not by the strenth of the saints think all the commandment of god to be impossible
but if diverse kept the commandments in the

law of nature vnder the law of moyses how much more may it be iustly thought that many haue kept them in the law of grace· when the law of the spirit reigneth when the motives of the love of god as the death passion of christ and the like are much more efficacious then they were before his coming when these things were knowen but very obscurely at least this confession of theirs to witt that diverse are recorded in the scriptures to haue kept the commandments shewes that they are not absolutly impossible

for this cause as would seeme the presbyterians being pressed also with the waight of other reasons haue begun to say of late that the commandments are not absolutly impossible but only that they are impossible to be kept perfectly
but this being an ambiguous expression very apt to deceive was desirous to know in what sense it was true in what not and in what sense the presbyterians intend it
wherevpon a catholique who did much assist me in this triall shew me that in this matter concerning the observation of the commandments there may be distinguished two kinds of perfection to wit perfection in parts and perfection in degrees
the first is when one having the love of god endeavoureth to keep not a part only but the whole law of god as iosias did who turned vnto god according to all the law of moyses to this perfection all men are obliged for he who offends in one is guilty of all as iames teacheth
and as all are obliged to

this perfection of keeping the whole law so by gods grace they may perform it
perfection in degrees is when the commandments are kept in the highest degree of perfection as the angels and saints in heaven do love obey god most perfectly
now as the commandments cannot be kept here in this life according to that highest degree of perfection so neither are they required to be kept so perfectly of vs
but they may be kept in an inferiour degree of perfection which god doth iustly exact of vs
for clearing of which matter the same catholique shew me that there are three states of perfection containd in scripture

they are called perfect who alwayes actually love god and refer all actually to his glory
this state of perfection is only proper to the blessed saints in heaven as it cannot be attaind to in this life so neither is it commanded
of this perfection paul speaks when he saith not that haue now received or now am perfect but pursue if may comprehend
and yet immediatly thereafter he calleth himself and others perfect in another inferiour degree of perfection
let vs therefore saith he as many as are perfect be thus minded

they are called perfect who although they do not alwayes actually love god think vpon him yet they consecrate themselves totally to gods service and leave willingly all worldly things to please him according to that of our saviour if thou wilt be perfect go and sell all thow hast give to the poore
this perfection is not commanded but

onely counselled as the holy fathers constantly teach and albeit it be not commanded yet many by gods grace do attayne vnto it
lastly they are called perfect who are ready to foresake loose all before they loose the love friendship of god
this last kind of perfection is required of all men as god said to abraham walk before me and be thou perfect and christ said to his disciples be ye perfect
the sripture calls some perfect in this sense for it saith that noe was a iust and a perfect man and paul saith we speak wisdome among the perfect
to this state a proportionable degree of perfection in keeping the commandments is required which by gods grace may be performed
of this perfection augustin speaketh when he saith that the iustice by which the iust man liues albeit for the capacity of this life it be not vndeservedly called perfect yet it is little in regard of that great iustice which the equality of angels doth containe

hence it may easily appeare in what sense the commandments of god ought may be kept perfectly and in what not
to wit they may be kept perfectly in all the parts not one excepted and in some degree of perfection although they cannot be kept perfectly during this life in the highest degree which is not commanded nor required of vs
if the presbyterians followed this sense they were not to be reproved but they haue a quite contrary meaning
for they deny all possibility of keeping the commandments any wise perfectly either in parts or the lowest degree of perfection as may be

seen in their new catechisme where they say that no man is able by any grace received in this life· to keep the commandments perfectly but every one breakes them dayly in thought word deed
so that their sense of the impossibility to keep the commandments perfectly is most false if not blasphemous
for either god commandeth that perfection which they say is above their force power or he commandeth it not
if he commandeth it not then they may fulfill the law perfectly because it is a law no further then it commandeth and if so far it may be fulfilled then may it be fulfilled perfectly
therefore it is false which they say that it cannot be fulfilled perfectly
if they say that overplus of perfection which is above their power is commanded as they do ordinarly then they make god to be a prince vnreasonable in commanding vs to do that which is not in our power to do and to be tyrannous cruell in punishing vs eternally for not doing that which was above our reach to perform
all which do make against the wisdome goodnesse iustice of god and therefore these opinions are condemned by the holy fathers by some protestants as blasphemous
thus spake the catholique

moreover remember he shew me that there was a notable difference in this matter betwen the catholiques the presbyterians
for the last said he do free themselves and put the blame of all their wickednesse and sluggishnesse vpon god alleadging that he hath given

them a law impossible to be kept even with all the help grace that he gives them
but the catholiques do free god of all blame impute iustly their breaking of the law to their own wickednesse alone
hierome shewes the humour of the presbyterians in these words we cry against god and we say that we are oppressed with the difficulty or impossibility of his commandments
neither is it sufficient that we do not keep his commandments vnlesse we pronounce the commander to be vniust whilst we complaine that the authour of equity hath commanded not only hard things but also impossibilities
the church of christ said the same catholique hath been troubled in this matter with two opposite heresies to witt of the pelagians the calvinists
the first taught of old that the commandments were possible to be kept without the grace of god and the others of late teach that the commandments are impossible to be kept even with the grace of god
the church of christ keeps the medium of truth between these opposite errours
against the first she teacheth that the commandments may be kept but not without gods grace and against the second that they may be kept with gods grace
and therefore against both these enemies as well to one another as to grace she defends the grace of god
against the first she shewes the necessity of grace and against the second she maintaines the power efficacy of it
but there is this notable difference between pelagius calvin in their opposition of grace that the first

is an open enemy to it and the second is a great friend in words but no lesse enemy in deeds
for whilst he vndervalues all the faculties and natural powers of man he would seem to cry vp grace to give all the glory to god
but when he teacheth again that grace is not able to purify our soules or make vs able to walk in the commandments of god he quite overthrowes grace
god who of his mercy delivered this island from the first heresy may also in his own time deliver it from the second
thus he
but did oppose vnto him that which heard some ministers say that god might iustly command things impossible to man fallen because it is sufficient that they were possible to man before his fall and seing by his own fault they became vnpossible god may iustly exact them without the least imputation either to his iustice or goodnesse

to this he answered that the authorities of the scriptures holy fathers are for the possibility of the law after the fall and the fathers shew by most solid reasons that god could neither with his iustice or goodnesse impose impossible lawes after the fall punish the transgressours of them with eternal paines
therefore this reason or rather pretence of the ministers being no scripture but rather against scripture the holy fathers who knew found reason as well as the ministers is not to be regarded

as a man who was rich and had mispent his estate cannot be iustly commanded by any new law to pay as much tribute as

when he had his estate nor be punished for not paying it thereafter for such a law would be both vniust ridiculous commanding impossibilities and so would be no law and the makers of it would be both vnreasonable cruel
so man after the fall of adam could not by any new law be iustly commanded by god to do that which was impossible vnto him vnlesse we would make that new law vniust and ridiculous god him self vnreasonable tyrannous
therefore since god made and promulgated his law long after the fall of man vsed exhortations propounded rewards and threatned punishments to induce men to keep it and all his actions are iust and wise they presuppose necessarly the possibility of keeping that law with the assistance of his grace or else such things would not be only against gods goodnesse iustice but also against ordinary prudence

moreover the same catholique shew me that the presbyterians who accuse the catholiques falsy for taking away the second commandment as they call it of which matter we shall haue occasion to speak more fitly hereafter may be iustly accused for taking away in reality not one but alle the commandments for their errour of the impossibility of them destroyes the end for which they and all iust lawes are made to wi that they may be kept and so they destroy the whole divine commandments and make them of no effect yea this errour destroies also the end of christs incarnation

passion if we will believe augustin for having brougt many passages of scripture to this purpose he subioyns quibus appaparet iesum christum nullam aliam ob causam in carnem venisse

where he sheweth very largely that christ for no other cause came vnto the world and became obedient vnto the death of the crosse· but that he might reconcile sinners to god destroy the power of sin obtaine grace from god to make vs walk in newnesse of life and in obedience of his holy commandments
whereby it may be seen what a dangerous fundamental errour this is which is against such principal fundamental points of the christian religion
therefore the presbyteria~s would de well to make vse of the same holy fathers sound advice when he saith
let him to whom the commandments are heavie know that he hath not got the gift to witt of the love of god by which they are made not heavie but yet though he find them heavie let him not be broke with despaire but let him be enforced and stirred vp to seek to beg and to knock
but the presbyterians who hereby may know that they want the love of god cannot make immediat vse of this wholsome counsel to seek and beg that love of god by which his commandments are made easy till they first correct or rather quite their erroneous faith whereof they make this a chiefe article that it's impossible to love god or keep his commandments
therefore they must first beg true faith that they may believe gods commandments

to be possible with help of his grace and then they may beg and obtaine the second to witt the love of god by which they may find grace to fulfill them
this article of the presbyterians faith gave occasion to a catholique gentleman of my acquentance to say to the presbyterians who were much pressing him to subscrib the covenant that he would never be of their religion who professed they did not love god yea and made it an article of their faith that they could not love him
thus he

having therefore diligently considered all these grounds could no longer believe the impossibility of keeping gods commandments even with the help of his grace as an article of my faith reveald in scripture which found to be against scripture and against the goodnesse iustice and wisdome of god which the holy fathers some protestants do call extream blasphemy which destroyes the vertue and power of gods grace which puts the blame of our negligence sluggishnesse from our selves and layes all vpon god which is against the end of christs incarnation merit of his passsion which hinders the growth of piety and opens a gate to all wickednesse and makes all the divine commandments of no effect
but vpon the contrary resolved by gods grace to embrace and believe the ancient catholique doctrin concerning the possibility of keeping the commandments with the help of gods grace which found to be so clearly expressed in scriptures so strongly maintaind by the holy fathers

so consonant to right reason iustice piety and which did make so much for the glory of gods grace the merits of christs death and passion

of iustification by faith onely maintain'd by the presbyterians and their first reformers as the principal article of their religion

after the triall of our doctrine concerning the commandments considered in the next place our doctrine of iustification not only because this hath connexion with the former but also for the importa~ce of the matter
for haue read and heard this article of iustification by faith onely called by many protestants the soule and life of their religion and of all articles the principal and greatest on the contrary they call iustification by works the life of popery so that fox saith that luther

by opening a certaine veine which lay long hid to witt our iustification by faith only did overturne the foundation of popery
moreover haue heard it affirmed that iustification by faith only was so certaine a truth and so evidently contain'd in the scriptures that some of the learned papists after they had much oppposed it were at lenth overcome by the strenth of it and made to acknowledge it and there was no point of popery esteem'd to be more absurd

nor more against the scriptures then iustification by works in so much that knox in his first sermon at andrewes did make instance principally in it

for thus speaks his history of him he plainly proved the papists doctrine lawes to repugne directly to the lawes of god the father and of christ iesus his son
this he proved by conferring the doctrine of iustification expressed in the scriptures which teach that man is iustifyed by faith only and the doctrine of the papists which attributes iustification to the works of the law
and vpon severall occasions haue heard the ministers pretend great advantage in this point which they ordinarly vrge very much

having then no small expectation to find such expresse and convincing scripture for this point of iustification by faith only that any impudent front cowld hardly deny it begun to consider these passages which they do ordinarly bring and cote on the margent of their confession and found that not one of them containes in expresse words the presbyterian article contradictory to the papists as may appeare to any man who will read the words
these passages are three and the first is in iohn who saith as many as received him he gave them power to become the sons of god who believe in his name
the two others are in paul

who saith we conclude or as it is in the catholique translation we account a man to be iustifyed by faith without the workes of the law
and againe being iustifyed therefore by faith let

vs haue peace toward god
now in none of these places can find it written that man is iustifyed by faith only or as it is in their new confessio faith is the alone instrument of iustification
find indeed that the scripture saith there that man is iustifyed by faith but can not find where it saith by faith only that word only or alone which is the maine point in this matter cannot be found in the scripture albeit knox in his foresaid sermon falsly pretends that it is expressed in scripture

admired to see both our first and last reformers after such huge pretences to want expresse scripture for this maine article of their religion but admired much more when found the catholique article which is flatly contradictory to the protestants to be expresly in the scriptures
iames saith abraham our father was he not iustifyed by works offering isaac his son vpon the altar and again
do you see that by works a man is iustifyed and not by faith only where iames directly contradicts the doctrine of the protestants for they say a man is not iustifyed by works but by faith only and iames saith a man is iustifyed by works and not by faith only
wondered how we could brag so much that we had always the scripture for vs against the papists and yet when tryed the matter found ever hitherto the contrary as may be found by any man who will not renounce his senses of hearing and seeing
but to find this in other points did not think it so strange as in the present which is

called the principal point of the protestant religion and wherein we did so much glory against the papists who haue much the better of vs if we will acknowledge the expresse words of scripture and stand to them

but the presbyterians pretend that although their article be not word by word in scripture yet the equivalent is there when paul saith a man is iustifyed by faith without the works of the law which they say is all one as if he had said by faith only
found many weighty reasons against this ministeriall glosse

at the beginning of their reformation they promised vs the pure word of god and now they give vs for it their gesses or the word of man which is a weak ground of faith

which is yet worse
their words interpretations are in expresse termes against the word of god in another place to witt in iames as we have seen

they affirm that all points necessary to salvation are clearly contain'd in scripture
how comes it then that this most necessary substantial point which they call the life of christianity is not there yea how comes it to passe that not only it is not in scripture but the quite contrary is word by word in scripture and that not simply affirmed but proved by many reasons examples and these who affirm the contrary are compared to devils
the holy fathers primitive church did never vnderstand the scriptures in that sense but in the contrary
how then could in sense considering these things make the ministers words

and interpretation which are not scripture yea which are against scripture and against the holy fathers the beliefe of the primitive church to be the principal article of my faith

augustin shewes that some men in the apostles own time did misinterpret the same words of paul as the presbyterians do now and made it the ground of the same errour
but men saith he not vnderstanding what the apostle saith we account a man iustifyed by faith without works thought that he said faith would suffice a man albeit he live ill and have no good works
which god forbid that the vessel of election should think secondly the same holy father shewes that to roote out the errour of those who by misconstruing pauls words did gather from them iustification by faith only the other apostles did principally direct the intentions of their epistles
peter saith he knowing that some wicked men took occasion from some obscure sentences of paul as being secure of their salvation which is in faith had no care to live well gave advertisment that there were some things in his epistle hard to be vnderstood which men perverted as they do the other scriptures to their own perdition
see vpon what a dangerous ground the principal article of our reformation is founded and how dangerous also it self is
but iames

saith augustin is so highly offended with these men who think that faith without works can availe vnto salvation that he compares them even to devils
and

then hauings brought these words of the apostle thou believest that there is one god thou dost well the devils also beleeve tremble he subioyns quid verius brevius vehementius dici potuit what could be said more truely more briefly efficaciously thus augustin
and that he alone did not condemne this errour maintained the catholique doctrin opposite to it

is manifest by the confession of the centurists who for this cause taxe the most ancient fathers as clement origen cyprian hierome ambrose augustin chrysostome many more
moreover the same augustin shewes that this errour of iustification by faith only was the ancient heresy of eunomius

and ireneus ascribes it also to simon magus
and yet this ancient heresy against the scripture the holy fathers is obtruded vpon vs as the principal article of our faith by our reformers who yet pretend to believe nothing but pure scripture
therefore resolued by gods grace not to believe any longer such a wicked opinion as the principal article of my religion but vpon the contrary intended to embrace follow the catholique doctrin opposite to it which found to be in expresse termes in the scriptures which were so vnderstood and beleeved by the holy fathers

vas much confirmed in this resolution when vnderslood how luther calvin hauing no scripture for them but against them haue grosly abused it to maintaine their errour
for luther the first apostle in this last age of

this new doctrine did two notable iniuries to the word of god
for seeing that this prime article of his faith was not expresly contain'd in the scripture by an vnparallel'd presumption he added the word sola or alone to the scripture in his german translation of the bible and whereas paul saith we account a man iustifyed by faith without the workes of the law he makes him say by faith alone and when this high temerity of adding to the word of god was obiected to him

he defended it with most insolent words saying that a papist and an asse was the same thing and that the word sola should remaine in his bible although all the papists in the world shoud go mad and be transformed to in asses
the second iniury that he did to the scripture was not by addition but by diminution wherin he was much more liberal then in the first for he added only one word but he took away many hundreds
because finding that the words above cited of iames epistle were clearly expresly against his doctrin he expunged the whole epistle out of the canon of the holy scriptures

calling it an epistle of straw vnworthy the spirit of an apostle
yea he arrived to that impudency that he said the authour of that epistle delirat that is dotes or raves
by these two practises was moved to think that luther could not be the second elias the restorer of purity true religio who would not only reform the church but also the scriptures yea in such a manner as he hath incurred not one but both the curses threatned by iohn for adding to and

pareing from the scriptures
and by this perceived also what little esteem they make of the scripture when it makes against their errours

calvin went more subtilly to work for although he followed luthers doctrin of iustification yet he neither added the word sola to the letter of the scripture neither did he deny iames epistle to be canonical but what luther added to the letter calvin added to the sense and what luther denyed the other corrupted
for calvin would have iustification by faith only to be as firmly believed as if the word only were there in scripture which indeed is all one as if he had added with luther that word to the scripture
then the words of iames which are clearly opposite to his errour and for which luther did reiect the whole epistle he doth so corrupt with new senses which luthers more grosse head could not invent that they passe many mens senses vnderstandings too and are against the words of scripture clearly against the sense of the holy fathers
for he saith faith alone doth iustify but not alone
some others of his schollers explaine it thus fides sola iustificat sed non solitaria
others say faith doth iustify and not works but yet faith not without works or a man is iustifyed with works but not by works and works are the means but not the causes of iustification
but all these inventions are directly contrary to the words of iames
for he saith man is iustifyed by works not by faith only
he doth not say

man is iustifyed with works but by works he doth not say he is iustifyed by faith only but not by faith only
and after the same manner and expression that he ascribeth our iustification to faith he ascribs it also vnto works
he neither speaks of causes nor means these are the ministers words and not the word of god which is not cleared but rendred more obscure by them
it was made appear to me that the question at first between the catholiques luther was whether good works were in any respect necessary to our iustification and not whether they were required as causes or conditions
luther said they were in no wise necessary or else none could be iustifyed since the best works of the greatest saints are mortal sins
and in this he spake consequentially to his principles
but calvin finding that the catholiques by innumerable scriptures and particularly by that place of iames proved the necessity of good works vnto iustification he invented a distinction not to cleare but to confound the matter that good works were necessary but not as causes and faith was the only cause of iustification
and this he did also very vnreasonably against the principle which he holds common with luther to witt that all our best actions are deadly sins
for if good works be in any manner necessary how can any be iustifyed according to calvin who maintains there can be no good works but that all are mortal sins for if a condition be necessary to any effect then if the condition be

not fulfilled the effect cannot be produced
as approximation of wood vnto the fire is ordinarly called the condition without which the wood could not take fire
therefore as the wood if it were not put near the fire would not conceive fire so also if good works be a necessary condition vnto iustification as calvin pretends no man can be iustifyed since according to him there can be no good works
therefore calvin speaks very inconsequentially if not also falsly

moreover it was showen me that the lutherans were so highly offended with these new glosses of calvin his schollers that they call them the doctrins of the new papists more pernicious then these of the old and illyricus

a famous lutheran doth not stand to call these calvinists seducers who by diuerse waye saith he would elude the propositio of paul
for this cause the lutherans deny all necessity of good works vnto salvation either as means or causes
for this they professed at the conference of altenberg we conclude say they with that worthy saying of luther if works be necessary vnto salvation then none can be saved without works and then we would not be saved by faith only
so found at length that this prime article of our religion to witt that man is iustifyed by faith only after so many great brags is not in scripture but against scripture as the lutherans vnderstand it and as calvin takes it its not only against scripture but also against his own principle who makes the whole matter to end in philosophical termes for the

most part neither vnderstood by speakers nor hearers
of which matter had not long ago a notable experience
for being in a gentlemans house in the countrey where there chanced to be a minister of esteem'd learning two roman catholiques and diverse protestants as the ordinary discours now a dayes is concerning religion so heard one at that time
for the minister taking occasion by hearing cardinal bellarmin named spake at first much in his praise saying that none of all the popish authors did relate so faithfully the protestant tenets nor argumented more clearly then he did
yet at length said the minister after the cardinal hath shewed the strength of his wit at the issue of the matter being convinced by the force of truth he concludes for the most part with the protestants
wherevpon one of the catholiques present said that he admired very much how bellarmin who had written so much for popry should be esteem'd a protesta~t merrily subioyn'd· that himself was iust a protestant as bellarmin was
after there had pass'd a little laughter occasioned by these words the other catholique did gravely desire the minister to shew wherein bellarmin was a protestant
wherevpon the minister instanced in this same matter of iustification and said that after bellarmin had wearied himself by produceing many testimonies of scriptures and fathers to prove that we are iustifyed by works and not by faith only he in end yeelds the victory to tthe proestants for he concludes that

it is most safe to rely vpon the merits of christ
and so in one sentence he destroyeth what he had been building a long time
to which the catholique replyed that if bellarmin was a protestant for that then all catholiques were protestants for they all professed the same
neither was the catholiques relying on christ merits any way against iustification by good works more then the protestants relying on the same merits was against their supposed iustification by faith only
but said he admire very much how you ordinarly pretend so great advantage in your doctrin of iustification by faith only which you esteem the principal article of your religion and yet it cannot be found in all the scripture the only pretended ground of all your faith and how you can crye so much against the catholiques for believing that we are iustifyed by works not by faith only which is expresly and word by word in the scripture
for doth not iames clearly say ye see that man is iustifyed by works and not by faith only
the minister finding himself thus engaged pass'd presently from the scripture enquired of the catholique whom he knew well enough not to be a profess'd scholler if he had any logique
who answered he had not much but he had sufficient for this purpose
that there was not much logique required to see what was contained in scripture
he would trust his owne eyes in that matter
it was sufficient for him that he had on his side the expresse scripture which

is better then logique
but the minister told him that although these words are in scripture yet they must be vnderstood in a sound sense
for works said he although they be necessary to iustification yet they are not the causes of it but in a very improper sense
for you must vnderstand that there are diverse kinds of causes there is causa efficiens causa formalis and causa sine qua non which is not a cause properly
now works are not the efficient nor formal cause but only causa sine qua non
they are via regni and not causa regnandi
and so after this manner he made a long discours involving the matter in great obscurities passing the reach of the hearers if not also overpassing his own vnderstanding
but the catholique holding him still by his grounds told the minister that his logique was no scripture and that the protestants are brought to a low ebb when they are enforced to acknowlege that this prime article of their faith is not expresly in scripture as they at first pretended and now when the quite opposite doctrine maintaind by the catholiques against which the ministers did so much raile is showe to be expresly in scripture they are enforced to run from scripture to their logique which indeed is to yeeld the cause to the catholiques and to quite ground
for at first they pretended nothing but scripture and now they flie to aristotles logique and that against the expresse words of scripture making the whole matter end in a logomachy which is so much the worse on the protestants side seing

they will not vse the very phrase of scripture which the catholiques keep
and vpon this followes also another evil that the people being made to believe that they are iustifyed by faith only and not by works makes by natural logique this inference which all the ministers in the world with all their artificial logique will not put out of their heads that good works are not necessary and so they altogether neglect them
thus ended that conference the minister replying something but little to purpose with small satisfaction of some protestants present who imagined that this prime article of their faith had been better grounded and that this minister whom they much esteemed could haue said more then to acknowledge that his faith was against the words of scripture and in end to run to his philosophical distinctions which were not by them intelligible

but albeit was sufficiently satisfyed by what hath been said of the truth of the catholique doctrin concerning iustification yet being desirous that might be able to discern more fully the deceits and obscurities which the ministers invent to elude the clear scriptures a catholique whose assistance required shew me that for this end it was necessary should first know the nature of iustification according to the doctrin of the catholique church
for as a rule said he is a measure to discern both what is right and what is crooked so truth is a manifestation both of it

self and of falshood
wherevpon he had several discourses with me on this matter the summe of which will briefly collect
chap
xvi
of the nature of iustification according to the catholique doctrine

albeit you haue seen evidently said the catholique vnto me that according to the expresse scriptures man is iustifyed by works· not by faith only yet that you may know how this is done and what works are excluded from iustification according to paul and what these works are by which we are iustifyed according to iames yow must know the nature of iustification of a sinner which according to the catholique church is thus described
iustification of a sinner is the translation of one from the state of sin into the state of grace a changing of one from being an enemy to make him become the friend of god
there is the misery from which a sinner is delivered the happinesse to which he is brought
now that he may come from such a miserable condition to such a happy estate there are some preparations and dispositions required to go before in the soule of a sinner that is come to age of which kind only we here speak
first god of his meer mercy by his preveening and helping grace doth excite and call a sinner

without any of his preceeding merits as it were out of the sleep of sin that he may convert himself vnto god

a sinner being thus awakned and assisted by the divine grace conceiving faith by hearing doth believe all things to be true which are revealed promised by god particularly that a sinner is iustifyed by the free mercy of god through the redemption which is in christ iesus

this faith representing god to be a severe punisher of sins there ariseth in a sinner thus disposed by faith a fear of gods iudgments with which the soule is profitably shaken terrifyed

for as salomon saith the feare of our lord is the beginning of wisdome

the soule of a sinner being thus terrifyed it is raised vp againe to hope by the same faith which represents god to be most bountifull mercyfull in forgiveing sins
for which cause he sent his son into the world to deliver vs from sin by his death

vpon this hope confidence in the divine mercy there ariseth the love of god who is so bountifull and mercyfull and likwise a hatred and detestation of sin which god hateth a sorrow and grief for what is past and a firm resolution of a better life in time to come a purpose of observing the divine commandments of receiving the holy sacraments
now all these dispositions of fa th fear love hope and the rest being placed in the soule of man by gods preveening grace iustification or the infusion of iustifying grace doth follow as we shall see shortly

that these preparations difpositions are

necessary before iustification the scripture shewes
our saviour shew the necessity of preveening grace when he said no man can come vnto me vnlesse my father draw him
of faith paul saith that without faith it is impossible to please god for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him
of fear beside the former testimony of salomon it is said that who is without fear cannot be iustifyed
and again the fear of our lord chaseth away sin
paul saith of hope that we are saved by it

of love our saviour saith many sins are forgiven her for she loved much
and that repentance is also necessary there is nothing more clear in the scriptures
by all which testimonies it remaines evident that although faith be the first disposition of the soule to iustification yet the others are also requisite
neither can there be any difficulty in this matter since it is as clear as the sun that no man of a sinner can become the friend of god vnlesse he haue not only faith but also the fear love of god with hope in his mercy and repentance for sins
to this purpose augustin saith fides prima datur ex qua caetera impetrantur
that is faith is first given by which the rest are obtain'd
and again the house of god is founded by faith raised vp hy hope and perfected by charity
and as in this sense it is truly said that faith doth iustify to wit as a fundamentall radicall disposition to iustification so it is no lesse true that fear hope love repentance

do also iustify to witt as secondary dispositions proceeding from faith because these likwise dispose the soule fitly to receive the forme of iustice and to become the friend of god and the scripture ascribes forgivenesse of sins salvation or iustification to them as it doth vnto faith
for as our saviour told mary magdalen that her faith had saved her

so he said that many sins were forgiven her because she loved much and paul saith we are saved by hope and iames expresly that we are iustifyed by works not by faith only
by which consideration it may be easily vnderstood what works paul excludes from iustification when he saith that a man is iustifyed by faith without the works of the law
for he doth not exclude the works of grace but only the works of the law which are done by the strength of nature without the grace of god and do not proceed from faith but go before it
now it is certaine that such works as not proceeding from faith do not properly dispose and prepare the soule vnto salvation

for as the councel of trent teacheth faith is the foundation roote and beginning of all salvation iustification and is the first effect of gods free grace in the soule of man
but the apostle doth not exclude from iustification the works of grace which follow faith for they do iustify that is dispose the soule vnto iustification as faith it self doth and they proce also from grace as faith proceeds from it and therefore are not the works of

the law but the works of grace
after this manner doth that great doctour augustin clearly reconcile these two places of paul iames
the sentences saith he of paul iames be not contrary one to another one affirmeth that a man is iustifyed by faith without works the other saith that faith is vaine without works for paul speaketh of works that go before faith and iames of works that do follow faith

these preparations being placed in the soule iustification it self doth follow which is not only remission of sins but also sanctification and renovation of the inward man by the voluntary reception of the divine grace gifts
but albeit iustification followeth these dispositions of faith love repentance the rest yet it is altogether free proceeding from the mercy bounty of god without the desert of man
for the catholique church professeth openly notwitstanding the ministers strong calumnies to the contrary that no man by any faith or works can merit the grace of iustification

as the councel of trent teacheth in these words
we are said to be freely iustifyed because none of those things which preceed iustification whether faith or works doth merit the grace of iustification
now this grace consisteth in two thing,s to witt in remission of sins and inward sanctification by the first the soule is changed purged from sin which is the filthinesse of the soule and by the second it is adorned and beautifyed with grace which is the beauty of it and made to die vnto sin live vnto iustice

but it must be diligently observed that the catholiques do teach according to the scriptures that in iustification our sins are not so forgiven that they remaine in the soule but they are quite taken away
for iohn saith of christ behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world and the spots of our soules are said to be washed cleanged and our sins to be throwen into the bottome of the sea and to be blotted out and exhausted
therefore in iustification sins do not remaine but they are really taken away

as the soule in iustification is purged and cleanged from the filthinesse of sins which are so forgiven that they are really taken away so it is also beautifyed with inward grace and inherent iustice by which he who was before a sinner is renewed in the spirit of his mind and hath the love of god powred forth in his heart by the holy ghost
this the apostle sheweth

when writing to the corinthians he saith these things you were to witt fornicators adulterers but you are washed but you are sanctified but you are iustifyed in the name of our lord iesus christ and in the spirit of our god

and elswhere be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new man which according to god is created in iustice and holynesse of truth
and writing to the romans he saith the charity of god is powred forth in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given vs
forbear to cite more testimonies

augustin sheweth that this inherent iustice is the love of

god the grace whereby we are iustifyed that is

saith he the love of god poured into our hearts
and elswhere charity begun is iustice begun charity encreased is iustice encreased great charity is great iustice and most perfect charity is most perfect iustice
if therefore charity or the love of god which is powred into our soules and consequently is inherent intrinsecal in them be the iustice by which we are made formally iust then our iustice is also inherent intrinsecal
and hereby all the causes of our iustification according to the doctrin of the catholique church may be clearly vnderstood

for the efficient cause is our mercyfull god the meritorious our lord iesus christ the final cause the glory of god of christ and life everlasting and the formal cause is the iustice of god not that by which he himself is iust but that by which he makes vs iust and with which we being endowed are renewed in the spirit of our mind and are not only reputed but truly are iust

but said the catholique to me that you may vnderstand more fully how we are made formally iust not by that iustice which is in god but by that iustice which proceeding from god is in vs will illustrate the matter a litle more vnto yow
as sin is the death of the soule so grace and iustice is the life of it
wherefore as the natural life of man is the formal cause of his living naturally so his spiritual life which is grace iustice is the formal cause of his living spiritually
as then the natural life

or soule of man by which he lives naturally albeit it be from god yet it is not that life by which god lives but it is that life communicated by god to man by which man lives and therefore cannot be any thing external but must be internal in man so the spiritual life of the soule which is grace iustice by which man lives spiritually is not the iustice which is in god or by which god is iust but that iuftice which is communicated by god to man whereby man is rendred iust and lives spiritually and therefore must be internal in him since nothing can live either naturally or spiritually by any thing which is external vnto it
the example of the raising lazarus from the the dead will yet more cleare this matter
for if christ calling lazarus from the grave had not given him inward life lazarus could not haue risen again and lived by the life of christ which was without him
but it was necessary for the resurection of lazarus that his own life should be inwardly restored to him by christ
it is so in our case for a man who is raised by christ from the death of sin vnto the life of righteousnesse must have grace or iustice which is the spiritual life of the soule inwardly communicated to him by christ the fountain and meritorious cause of all iustice and the source of all spirituall life or else man could not be raised from the death of sin and live spiritually
augustin proves by the holy scriptures that christ came into the world

to give vs that spiritual life
shall heep together saith he many

testimonies which shall suffice by which it may appear that for no other cause christ came into the flesh but that by the disposition of grace he might quicken save and illuminate all those to whom as members appoynted in his body he is head who before were placed in the death sicknesse darknesse of sin
shall only bring two or three of the many testimonies of scripture which the holy father heapeth vp there
paul saith god who is rich in mercy for his exceeding charity wherwith he loved vs even when we were dead by sins quickned vs together in christ by whose grace you are saved and raised vs vp with him

and again be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new man which according to god is created in iustice and holynesse of the truth the same apostle writing to the colossians saith and you when you were dead in the offenses and vncircumcision of the flesh did he quicken together with him pardoning you all offenses
and to titus he saith

that we are iustifyed by his grace
whence it is evident that these who haue been sinners and become iust are said to rise again to be quickneed by christ to be renewed inwardly to be iustifyed by his grace
but they could not rise from the death of sin nor be quickned renewed inwardly and be iustifyed by his grace vnlesse they had spiritual life which is grace or iustice inwardly co~municated vnto the
therefore these who rise fro the death of sin are iustifyed quickned inwardly renewed have the spiritual life of iustice flowing from the merits iustice of christ inwardly

remaining in them
and hence doth appear clearly the truth of that which the catholique church teacheth to witt that we are made iust by the iustice of god not by that wherby he himself is iust but by which he makes vs iust
for as nothing can make an man iust but iustice so it is not the external iustice of christ but it must be internal iustice flowing from his merits and iustice that can quicken vs

this raising of one from the death of sin to the life of iustice is called by the catholiliques the first iustification by which one of a sinner is made the friend of god
and it is altogether free proceeding meerly from the grace favour of god without all works and merits of man
of this paul speaks to the romans

when he saith we conclude that man is iustifyed by faith without the works of the law
where augustin vnderstands by the works of the law not only the works of the ceremonial and iudicial law but also of the moral law which are done by the force of nature or by the insight of the law without the help of grace in christ which help is not given except one haue first faith in christ which is the roote of salvatio first effect of the divin grace in our soules
therefore if man could not be iustifyed by these works of the law albeit he did them much lesse can he be iustifyed by these works when he breaketh the law as paul proveth in the same epistle that both iewes and gentiles haue sinned and therefore stand in need of the mercy of god and consequently must be

iustifyed by the faith grace of christ
besids this first iustification there is another which the catholiques call the second iustification by which one is not of impious made iust but of iust he is made more iust and of a friend made yet more intimate with god according to that in the apocalypse he that is iust let him be iustifyed even vnto death
of this iustification are vnderstood the words of iames when he saith that a man is iustifyed by works and not by faith only
that is by works following after faith flowing from it for such works are not the works of the law that is they are not works done meerly by the force of nature or by the only knowledge of the law but they are the works of grace as faith it self is and by these works we are iustifyed and not by faith only
this second iustification is acquired by doing all works of iustice and piety by which a man being in the state of grace purchaseth a further augmentation of it
augustin brings paul

as an example of both these iustifications
for before his conversion he was found with no good merits but rather with many evil merits who was persecuting the church and yet he obtain'd mercy
therefore he was not iustifyed by his works or by the deeds of the law but by the faith or grace of christ
but after his conversion first iustification the same apostle reckons out the good works he had done

by which he had advanced in piety iustice
am even now saith he to be sacrificed and the time of my resolution is at

hand
have fought a good fight have consummate my course have kept the faith
concerning the rest there is laid vp for me a crown of iustice which our lord will render to me in that day a iust iudge vpon which augustin saith he reckons out now his good merites that after his good merits he might obtaine the crown who after evil merits did obtaine grace
take heed what followes
there remaines to me a crown of iustice
to whom could the iust iudge render the crown if he had not first as a merciful father given him grace and how had that been a crown of iustice if grace had not gone before which iustifyes the impious how could that haue been rendered as due if the first had not been freely bestowed thus augustin
by these reasons many other testimonies which were showen vnto me was brought to vnderstand the catholique doctrin concerning the nature of iustification and therby was made more sensible of the errous which are against it
chap
xvii
of the presbyterians three principall errours concerning iustification

having thus seen the truth of the ancient and catholique doctrin was moved to take special notice of three principall and most grosse errours maintain'd by the presbyterians against it
the first is that they do not only place the whole nature of iustification

in remission of sins but they likwise teach that although our sins be forgiven in iustification yet they are not taken away but that they really remaine in the person iystified and are only covered and not imputed
the second errour is that a man iustified hath no internal nor inherent iustice in him as being altogether defiled inwardly with sin but that he is only iust by the external iustice of christ with which he is covered and which is imputed vnto him
the third and last errour consists in this that they teach this external iustice of christ is applyed vnto man by faith only and that not by a christian or catholique faith wherby one believes the articles of the creed or such things as god hath revealed in scripture but by a special faith as they call it wherby every one believes for certaine that his sins are forgiven him and that he is one of the predestinate

the first errour to witt that sins remaine and are not taken away from the person iustified maintain'd by calvin and the presbyterians found to be against cripture the vertue of christs passion the efficacy of baptisme
iohn baptist calleth christ the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world

paul saith that christ was offered vp once to exhaust the sins of many
and iohn affirmeth that the blood of christ cleanseth vs from all sins
ananias said to paul arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins
if our sins be taken away as iohn affirmeth how do they remaine

as the presbyterians believe if our sins be washed away and cleansed by the blood of christ and by baptisme how can the filthinesse and blots of them remaine david saith to god wash me and shall be whiter then snow
but according to the presbyterians he behoved to remaine as black as pitch and as filthie as the puddle even with all the washing that god would bestow vpon him
therefore this presbyterian doctrin is against the scriptures the vertue of christs passion and the efficacy of baptisme and it is also clearly against the holy fathers as we shall see shortly in the triall of the sacraments

against these clear authorities the calvinists bring principally one place of scripture whereon they found their errour and that is in the
psalme where david saith blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven whose sins are covered
admired that for this one testimony which saith that our sins are covered they should deny so many which shew that sins are taken away and will not rather confesse with the scripture that they are both covered and taken away
augustin sheweth excellently on this place how god doth both
for comparing him to a surgeon or physician

he saith that god doth so cover the wound with a plaister that he cureth it and taketh it away
calvin his followers make christ to be a very imperfect spiritual physician who can neither heale the sick nor cure the wounded soules but only can cast a cover vpon them
such a physician

of the body who could do nothing but throw his cloake vpon the sick or wounded and neither be able to take away the sicknesse or wounds would be in small esteem and little employed

the second grosse errour of calvin which denyeth inherent iustice is sufficiently above refuted
where it was shewed out of the scriptures fathers that we are quickned by christ and that iustice or grace proceeding from the iustice of christ the meritorious cause of our iustice is the spiritual life of the soule which quickens it and therefore must be internal and inherent within vs
for as one cannot live naturally vnlesse he have internal life within him so neither can one live spiritually by any thing that is without him but he must necessarly have the life of grace or iustice within him
this truth is so strong that calvin did sometime acknowledge it for he saith

that we are never reconciled to god but we are also gifted with inherent iustice
but at other times he frequently opposeth it affirming that the most holy and iust persons are nothing inwardly but filthy sinners and that all their iustice consists only in the external iustice of christ which is imputed to them and with which their sins and filthynesse are covered

so that calvins iust men are not vnfitly by some compared to whited sepulchres to which our saviour compared the pharisees that outwardly appeare vnto men beautifvll but within are full of dead mens bones all filthinesse
so the presbyterians

would appeare beautifull outwardly by the iustice of christ but inwardly they are full of filthinesse iniquity
they are also like wolves in sheeps clothing who haue an external shew of meeknesse iustice but inwardly are ravenous creatures
but as sheeps clothing doth not make a wolfe to become a lamb so neither will the external iustice of christ that innocent lamb with which a sinner would cloth himself outwardly and yet remaine still in his sins make him a saint

iohn giveth a serious warning to this purpose little children saith he let no man seduce you
he that doth iustice is iust even as he also that is christ is iust
therefore they are seduced who think to be iust and yet will do no iustice as christ did

the third errour to witt that faith alone doth iustify is also above refuted
for
it hath been shewed not to be in scripture and therefore the presbytetians make it very vnreasonably against their own principles the principal article of their religion

it is not only not to be found in scripture but it is expresly word by word against scripture as hath been seen out of iames
therefore the presbyterians brags of great advantage in this point are very false and groundlesse

it is also against the holy fathers who condemned it as we haue seen in some ancient heretiques
yea augustin doth affirm that because it had risen in the very time of the apostles by misinterpreting the words of paul the other apostles as peter iames iohn did direct

the intention of their epistles and wrote most earnestly to roote out that errour from the minds of men and paul also did expresse himself sufficiently against this errour when he said that albeit he had all faith so that he could remove mountains if he had not charity

which he calleth greater and more excellent then faith and hope he would be nothing and his faith would profite him nothing
whence augustin saith that it is charity

which makes all vertues profitable and that faith may be present but it cannot profite without charity and leo saith that charity quickens faith it self by which the iust man lives
yea shelford the protestant minister above cited saith expresly that charity is the most precious grace of god and is the greatest mean instrument of our iustification
and that he meaning calvin who preferreth faith before charity in our iustification would elude pauls demonstration

but there is another part or branch of this third errour much more dangerous then the former
for as they teach that faith alone doth iustify and yet they require with it charity other vertues which makes the difference to be more nominal then real so they teach that this iustifying faith is nothing else but a sure persuasion that every one ought to have of the forgivenesse of his sins for the merits of christ and that he is iust in the sight of god
this is the special faith which they say is only given to the elect and these who once have it can never

fall from it and they are sure of their election predestination
in this matter the presbyterians differ substantially from the catholiques who require also faith to iustification but of a far different nature from this of calvin which they esteem not to be faith but rather a phanatical fancy and high presumption
against which found some solid reasons which will briefly touch

no ma ought to believe any thing as an article of faith but that which god hath revealed
but god hath not revealed that every ma~s sins are forgiven him
therefore he ought not to believe it much lesse although he believe it is he iustifyed by it

there is neither precept nor example in the whole scripture of such a special iustifying faith
therefore it is not to be admitted

it is far different from the faith of abraham the father of the faithfull by which he was iustifyed which faith the apostle in the same epistle to the romans doth highly extoll
for he was iustifyed by believing the promise of god which was revealed to him to witt that he should be the father of many nations and that his seed should be as the starres of the heauen and the sand of the sea
this is the faith which the christians of all ages ever required before luther calvin arose to believe what god had revealed to witt the articles of our creed and the other matters contaynd in scripture accorording to that of the apostle if thou confesse with thy mouth our lord iesus and in thy hart believe that god raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved


iohn saith also these things are written that ye may believe iesus christ is the son of god and believing ye may have everlasting life here is not a word of calvins special faith and yet we see how abraham others were iustifyed without it by believing these things which god had revealed


paul esteem'd predestination one of the most deep secrets of god crying out the depth of the riches of the wisdome knowledge of god
and yet every calvinist will know this secret in relation to himself as if he were one of gods privy counsellers or god had particularly reveald it to him augustin saith to the same purpose who of all the campany of the faithfull so long as he lives in this mortality can presume that he is in the number of the predestinate what would augustin have said of the presbyterians who do not only so presume but make it also the principal article of their faith and the very ground of their iustification

this belief of the assurance of election is against the scripture which sheweth that man knoweth not whether he be worthy love or hatred

and exhorts vs to work out our salvation in fear and trembling and advertiseth him who stands to take head least he fall
lastly as this presumptuous belief openeth a wide gate to all sort of vice and banisheth the exercise of vertue true piety which might be easily shewed so the seeking this faith hath made diverse loose all hope and it hath proved pernicious to them both in soule body
for experience hath proved

that it hath made diverse to be troubled in spirit and loose their wits and some to fall into despaire by putting violent hands in themselves as it did not long ago to a famous covenanter in aberdeen

who drowned himself when he was esteem'd by the ministers there to haue been at the very point of getting assurance of his election
so that have heard some of the old protestant ministers condemne much this iustifying faith of the puritans

and shelford doth not stand to call it a private fancie and a false faith and an enemy to all true vertue piety
therefore by gods grace do not intend to believe it much lesse to found my salvation vpon it
all the assurance that we can have here without gods particular revelation is by hope in the divine goodnesse and mercy which hope is not only fufficient to comfort vs in this life but also it will not confound vs in the next if we strive here to do our dutie and have the love of god powred forth in our hearts
therefore it belongs to the vertue of hope and not to faith to apply the divine promises as the same shelford doth acknowledge

besids all these authorities reasons a catholique shew me that this doctrin of iustification by faith only destroyeth it self
for if we cannot be iustifyed by any works then we could not be iustifyed by faith since faith it self is a work according to these words of our saviour this is the work of god that you beleeve in him whom he hath sent
therefore said he since we are iustifyed by faith which is not

against the divine grace nor our free iustification because faith it self is a work of grace so we may be also iustifyed by love hope and other works of grace without any derogation from the diuine grace
he did further vrge and said either the faith by which the calvinists say that men are iustifyed is a mortal sin or not if it be a deadly sin then they are iustifyed by sin which is impious to say
if it be not a mortal sin then all our actions are not sins as luther calvin falsly teach
the same catholique shew me that to shun these inconveniences to which the doctrin of the calvinists drives them they affirm that faith albeit it be a work yet it doth not iustify as a work of vertue but only as an instrument to apprehend the iustice of christ
calvin saith that faith although it be of no dignity nor price iustifyes vs bringing christ as a pot filled with money enricheth a man
melanchton saith that iustifying faith is like a poore mans hand which he stretcheth forth to receive almes from a rich man
and so at length this iustifying faith which the presbyterians so much cry vp by the confession of calvin is of no price nor dignity so that by him it is compared to a pot and by another great light to a scabbed mans hand and by both ther principles it is a sinfull instrument by which they will have all men to be iustifyed
whereby said the catholique it may appeare that these men are no lesse enemies to faith then to works and that they destroy the goodnesse vertue of both
whereas the catholiques do

esteem faith to be an excellent vertue and the very roote foundation of our iustification

there was an other difficulty arising clearly from the presbyterian doctrin with which the same catholique did much presse me and some other protestants who were present
either said he the presbyterians who pretend to be assured of their electio are purged cleansed from the filthines of their sins befor they can enter into heauen or they are not purged at all from them if they be not purged from them then they cannot enter into that heavenly citie
for iohn saith there shall not enter into it any polluted thing
that citie is described to be of pure gold and the foundations of it to be adorned with every precious stone
therefore the citizens of it must also be pure and without spot
and consequently if the presbyterians be not purged from the filthinesse and sores of their sins which must not be only covered but really taken away cured and cleansed they cannot enter into heaven
if they say that they must be purged from their sins and all filthinesse and blots taken from them before they can enter into heaven then they are either purged from their sins in this life or in the life to come
not in this because they teach that their sins are not taken away in this life but are only covered and the filthinesse of them remaines and as they live so they in sins
not after this life for then they behoved to acknowledge a purgatory which is against a principal article of their negative faith

if they say their sins are taken away by death in the very instant of it then since death is common to all men if death had that power all men would be cleansed from sin and so all would be saved which is false
if they say it is not death simply but death ioyn'd with faith that hath this power
why shall not also faith and life have the same power how can the presbyterians without any ground in scripture assigne that power to faith and death which they deny against scripture to faith and the holy sacraments and to the blood of christ death indeed may put an end to sin that one sin no more but it cannot take away sins already done or else death would be more powerfull according to that tenet then the blood of christ the holy sacraments which is not only a groundlesse fancy but also a great absurdity
out of which it followeth that either the presbyterians must grant that they do not go to heaven which is very much against the assurance of their election or that they are purged from their sins after this life since they are not purged in it which is against their negative confession
and so these who deny a a purgatory for venial sins must grant a new and most dangerous purgatory for mortal sins
for my part could never find a solid answer to this reason and therefore leave it to the presbyteries consideration

but because this catholique did trouble vs with this difficulty thought to have entangled him as much with the words of bellarmin

whereof had heard some ministera often boast
did not bellarmin said after he had much laboured to prove iustification by works in end conclude that it was most safe to put all our confidence in the only mercy of god
what will become then of all your works and merits which such a great champion of your church doth renounce to which he answered that bellarmins words fully related do clear the whole matter

and shew the vanity of the ministers pretences
for thus he speaks
by reason of the vncertainty of our proper iustice and of the danger of our vaine glory it is most safe to put all our confidence in the only mercy favour of god
where he doth not deny neither good works nor merits but only affirmeth that for two reasons which he there toucheth that it is most safe not to rely vpon them but vpon the alone mercy of god
out of which the ministers would make this false collection therefore we are not iustifyed by works
which is as ridiculous as if you would say
the protestants teach that it is most safe to rely vpon the mercy of god therefore they are not iustifyed by faith
if then the protestants relying vpon the mercy of god taketh not away iustification by faith why should not also the catholiques relying on the same mercy not take away iustification by works bellarmin speaks so clearly in this matter that his meaning cannot be wrested without malice
for he sheweth in the same place that david and other saints had some confidence in their iustice

and good works according to that in the
psalme the lord will render to me according to my iustice because have kept his wayes
the like he sheweth of nehemias ezechias and ester
and this they did with great humility
but because such co~fide~ce is dangerous to many by reason of pride vaine glory that may arise beside there are few who haue such merits or are sure to have them therefore bellarmin saith it is most safe to rely on the mercy of god whereof he gives this reason
either a man hath good works or he hath none but evil works
if he hath no good but evil works then he is perniciously deceived who trusts in evil works for these are deceitfull riches
as bernard calls them
if he hath good works he looseth nothing by not looking on them by putting his trust in the mercy of god alone for god lookes on them knowes them well and will not suffer them to passe without their due reward
thus bellarmin
yea

the councel of trent makes the like profession when it saith although much be given to good works in the holy scriptures yet god forbid that a christian should trust or glory in himself not in our lord whose goodnesse is so great that he willeth these things to be our merits which are his own gifts
the ministers may collect out of these words by their logique that the councel of trent yea and that all papists are protestants· but they will not distinguish between the necessity of good works and confiding in them which are very different
at least all moderat protestants may

know by this open profession the falshood of that calumny which is often beaten into their eares to witt that all papists presume in their merits
augustin sheweth that there are two gulfs in this matter one vpon either hand and that the truth is a direct way in the middle
presumption of iustice or good works is the gulf vpon the one hand and negligence of good works is the precipice on the other
but the earnest care of good works and piety accompanyed with humility is the safe way in the middle
thus ended the catholique to the good satisfaction of some protestants who were present

to conclude this matter wherein have stayed longer by reason of the ministers specious pretences of great advantage in it can not believe any more iustification by faith only as the principal article of my religion because it is not in sctipture because it is expresly against scripture against the holy fathers because it is an ancient heresy condemned in simon magus eunomius because the presbyteria~s iustifying faith is not a true catholique faith having the divin reveal'd truth for its obiect as these he retiques required but is a private fancy a false faith

as it is acknowledged by some protesta~ts having for its obiect humane presumption
because it makes christ a most imperfect physician and either debarreth man from the kingdome of heaven into which he cannot enter with the filthinesse of his sins or exposeth him after this life to a most dangerous purgation

because it breeds neglect of all piety and good works and opens a wide gate to all sort of vice
in a word albeit the ministers bragged much of this article yet found they had never lesse reason if we will stand to the iudgment of the scriptures fathers which god willing ever intend to prefer to their fancies and to their philosophical distinctions or rather confusions to which they are forced to run that they may lurk in their obscurities when they are beaten out of the scriptures in which at first they pretended to be impregnably setled
it is sufficient for me that the scripture expresly saith that a man is iustifyed by works and not by faith only which is the contradiction of the presbyterians faith and that themselves do acknowledge in end the necessity of good works
but to know how they are necessary either as causes or conditions is not a necessary curiosity wherof few are capable and without which many have gone to heaven
and so now proceed to the trial of our doctrin concerning the sacraments
chap
xviii
of the excellency of the christian sacraments and particularly how they conferre grace which is denyed by the presbyterians

as knew the christian religion to be the most excellent of all true religions that ever have been whether we consider that which was vnder the law of nature or the other which was vnder the law of moyses so iustly conceived that it was most agreeable to gods goodnesse and wisdome to adorne and enrich it with most excellent sacraments
for since no religion whether true or false can be without some sensible signes

as augustin hath observed the christian religion which is not only the true but also the most perfect religion to which the former two served as preparations must also have the most perfect and efficacious sacraments
and so found the same augustin extolling the perfection of the christian sacraments above these of the ancient law
our lord saith he and the apostolical disciplin haue delivered some few sacraments for many and these most easy to be done most magnificent for signification and most pure to be observed
and elswhere he saith the sacramenss are changed they are made easier fewer holsommer happier
now the principal perfection of the christian sacraments was generally believed

to consist in this that god by them did conferre grace vnto our soules
which truth is so engrafted in the hearts of christians that knew diverse protestants could not be at first perswaded that luther or calvin or that their church taught the contrary and
when that was sufficiently manifested to them they were much scandalized at it in so much that some of them did say if the sacraments do not confer grace and baptisme doth not take away original sin for what vse serve the sacraments for what end were they ordain'd wherefore being thus stirred vp to try this question found in end that the catholique doctrine which taught that the sacraments of the new law do confer grace is conformable to the divine scriptures that it was expresly believed by the holy fathers and doth duly exalt the perfection of the christian sacraments whereas the presbyterians doctrin which denyeth the sacraments to confer grace is not only false against the scriptures but was also condemned as an ancient heresy by the holy fathers that it vndervalues the vertue of the christian sacraments and is so absurd that diverse famous protestants haue abandoned that opinion albeit it was taught both by luther calvin and in this point do agree with the catholiques
all which things for brevities sake will only touch

of baptisme iohn said to the iewes indeed baptize yow in water but he who comes after me shall baptize you in the holy ghost

fire
ananias said to paul be baptized wash away thy sins

paul calleth also baptisme the lauer of regeneration by which we are saved
the same apostle saith that christ hath sanctifyed his church by the lauer of water in the word of life
by which testimonies albeit we speak nothing of many others it appear'd sufficiently clear to me since we are said to have our sins washed away by baptisme to be sanctifyed to be born of new again that by it we receive also grace without which these things could not be verified and performed
the like is also affirmed of the eucharist of which our saviour saith if any man eate of this bread he shall live for ever
and again he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath everlasting life
now this everlasting life is no otherwise had here but by receiving grace which is the seed of glory and of eternal life happinesse
therefore these two sacraments which are all that the presbyterians admit do confer grace by the vertue institution of christ

what was the belief of the holy fathers and of the whole church in this point it is so clear that calvin himself and other chief protestants do acknowledge it to be the same which is now believed by the catholiques against their doctrin

for
calvin confesseth that with great consent it was taught and believed for many ages that the sacraments of the new law do confer grace if they were not hindered by mortal sin which albeit he calleth

a pernicious and pestilentious opinion and alleadgeth that it drawes men from god to rest in the sight of corporall things and not in god himself yet he confesseth also that it was taught by augustin the holy fathers whom he striveth to excuse by saying that in their immoderat praises of the sacraments

they vsed hyperbolical speeches
the lutheran centurists do ascribe the same doctrin as an errour to the most ancient fathers as to clement iustin cyprian and others
musculus saith plainly that augustin did rashly affirm that the sacraments of the new law conferred grace
these open confessions shall save our paines of citing the fathers testimonies
and that this doctrin of the catholiques doth manifest the perfection of the christian sacraments it is so clear of it self that it needeth no illustration
vpon this consideratio augustin

admiring the wonderfull effects of the sacraments cry'd out vnde tanta virtus aquae vt corpus tangat cor abluat whence comes saith he so great vertue to the water that it toucheth the body and cleanseth the soule where he ascribes this wonderful effect to the goodnesse omnipotency of god which sheweth also that his speeches are not hyperbolicall as calvin falsly pretends
thus much briefly to shew that found the catholique doctrin to be conforme to the scriptures holy fathers and to manifest the perfection of the christian sacraments
and therfore calvins opinion which is iust contrary must needs be against all these

he himself confesseth that it is against the holy fathers and consequently it cannot be conforme to the scriptures whereon they founded their faith and not vpon humane imaginations
that it taketh away a great perfection from the sacraments denying them to conferre grace is so evident that it needs no proofe
calvin saw this so clearly that he pretended the farhers vsed immoderate praises of the sacraments and that this vertue which the catholiques do ascribe to the sacraments makes people to trust more in creatures them in god himself
but as found calvins doctrin to be false so soone perceived that his pretence of preserving gods honour was very frivolous
for how can the vertue of the sacraments derogate from the power honour of christ since all power vertue that they have is acknowledged to be from christ who is the principall agent and author of grace they being only the instruments by which he produceth it how can the vertue of the sacraments draw people from god and make them rely more on corporal things then on god since it being so spiritual and supernatural rather drawes people from corporal things to god and makes them to admire more his power to love his goodnesse this was the effect that the vertue of the sacraments produced in augustin when with admiration he cryed out whence hath the water that vertue that it toucheth the body cleanseth the soule
a catholique did further illustrate this matter to

me by an example
vvho can be so void of reason said he as to think that the vertue which proceeded from the hemme of our saviours garment by touching whereof

the woman in the gospel was cured did derogate from the honour of christ or would make the women to rely or fixe her ey's more on the garmen then on christ himself but rather is not the contrary most evident that thereby the power vertue of christ was mvch illustrated who by such a small instrument had produced so wonderfull an effect and was not the woman all the people present drawen thereby more closely to christ and made to love his goodnesse and admire his power it is iust so in the sacraments
as that vertue which proceeded from the hemne of our saviours garment cured supernaturally the desease of the body so the vertue which proceeds from the sacraments cures the deseases and infirmities of the soule
and as that tended to the honour of christ so doth this much more
thus he

moreover found this presbyterian opinion which robs the sacraments of all vertue to be an ancient heresy condemned by the holy fathers

in some heretiques called messalians who taught that sins were purged without the divine sacraments as epiphanius augustin damascen do testifie
there is indeed this difference between them the calvinists that they ascribed that power of purging sins to prayer which these do in their own manner to faith
lastly this opinion of

luther calvin is so false absurd

that diverse famous protestants as osiander whitaker hooker bilson and others cited in the protestants apology besids some more late doctours of the late english church haue reiected it and believe with the catholiques that the sacraments of the new law do not only signifie but also conferre grace and acknowledge the difference which the holy fathers haue put between the sacraments of the old law and these of the euangel
all which considerations gave me sufficient ground not to make any longer such a grosse errour an article of my faith

but because the first chief protestants deny the sacraments to conferre grace was curious to know for what end they thought the sacraments were ordain'd

and for what vse they served and in this matter found a diversity among them
melanchton said that they serve as badges to distinguish vs from infidels
zuinglius maketh sacraments no better then souldiours marks by which they are distinguished
luther saith that they are external signes ordain'd to stirre vp our faith
calvin is of the same opinion but he addeth that they are seals of gods promises ordain'd to vphold our faith to witt his special iustifying faith
when it was obiected to luther by the catholiques that the sacrament of baptisme could not stirre vp faith in infants baptized who have no vse of reason he was brought to that straight that he said infants did actually beleeve

whilst they were baptized which is so false that as augustin speaks they

who affirm such things do an iniurie to humane senses
calvin not relying fully vpon luthers vnreasonnable opinion saith that the baptism of infants stirreth vp their faith when they come to the vse of reason
which doctrin gives great advantage to the anabaptists and sheweth that the baptism of infants is not profitable before they attayne to the vse of reason
so that according to the chieff protestant reformers the sacraments are nothing but badges or bare signes tokens or seales of gods promises without any inward effect of grace
and therefore they are made by them to serve to little or no purpose
by which saw what vncertainty is among these reformers even in the principal points of our faith and how abiectly they speak and think of the christian sacraments whereas the catholique church holy fathers speak most reverently esteem highly of them shewing that they were ordain'd principally for our sanctification according to that famous definition of a sacrament

collected out of augustin
a sacrament is a visible signe of invisible grace instituted by christ for our
to which purpose the same holy father saith without the grace of invisible sanctification to what would the visible sacraments serve and again the vertue of the sacraments vnspeakably auaileth much
therefore the presbyterians sacraments being without invisible sanctification

serve to little vse according to augustin

there was one doubt which had in this matter concerning that which the catholiques teach that the sacraments do conferre grace ex opere operato or by the work wrought
for have heard some ministers affirm· that the papists intended thereby to shew that the sacraments produced grace as well in those who were evil disposed and came without due preparation as in those who were well disposed and came well prepared to receive them which iustly esteem'd to be most false and impious
therefore having proposed this difficulty to a catholique was informed by him that this was a meer calumny of the ministers

wherein they followed their predecessors luther calvin who said that to conferre grace by the work wrought according to the catholiques was nothing else but to conferre grace to a sinner without faith and repentance
but the catholiques said he have no such false and absurd meaning
they only by that phrase do shew that the grace which christ produceth by the sacraments as by his instruments doth not depend either vpon the the holynes of the minister or vpon worthinesse of the receiver but vpon the work wrought that is on the sacramental action which is instituted by christ for that end
as for example the sacrament of baptisme confers the grace of sanctification to infants washing away their original sin and making them the children of god and this effect it vndoubtedly produceth in infants in whom no

dispositions are required so that if they die before they commit any actual sin all of them would infallibly go to heaven
here it is evident that baptisme confers grace by the work wrought or by the sacramental action and institution of christ and not for any worthinesse of the infants
again although the dispositions of faith love repentance and the rest be required in these persons who being come to age are to be baptized yet baptisme doth produce their sanctification not by vertue or for the merit of these dispositions although without them iustifying grace would not be produced but for the institution of christ to whom and not to the merit of the receaver all the grace is attributed
thus he shew me how the catholique doctours did explaine the matter and that it never entered into any of their heads that the sacraments would produce grace in those who were ill disposed or received the without due preparation since the scripture sheweth that these

who receeive the eucharist vnworthily receive vnto themselves damnation

vpon these considerations thought it no wonder that the presbyterians who esteem their sacraments to be of so little value haue also made them to be of so little vse
for they haue abrogated and condemned all private baptisme and communion so that these two sacraments which are all they have cannot be any more vsed in private although vpon never so great necessity
and for their communion

as they never give it in private for the comfort of the sick so they give it very seldom in publick for the devotion of the whole for in some remarkable townes and other parts of the countrey it hath not been once administrated these
or
yeares
by all which saw clearly enough that the doctrines and practises of the presbyterians were not only against the excellency but also against the necessity of the christian sacraments which were thereby rendred altogether gracelesse and almost vselesse
therefore intended godwilling to follow no longer such wicked opinions and practises which destroy the nature end and vse of the christian sacraments
chap
xix
that baptisme taketh away original sin which is denyed by the presbyterians

vpon the determination of the former question this other was soone decyded
for if baptisme conferres grace as hath been proved generally of all the christian sacraments in the former chapter then it also taketh away sin which cannot stay with grace in the same place
and so accordingly the catholiques teach

that original sin is taken away by baptisme as the councel of trent hath defined in these words if any man shall

deny that by grace conserred in the sacrament of baptisme the guilt of original sin is taken away or saith also that all that is properly sin is not taken away but only razed and not imputed be he accursed
the chieff protestants presbyterians hold the contrary as an article of their faith
luther saith to deny sin to be remaining in a child after baptisme is to tread both paul and christ vnder foote
calvin accordeth to him
it is false saith he that by baptisme we are loosed and exempted from original sin
the presbyterian confession of westminster saith that by original sin we are wholly defiled in all the faculties parts of soule body
and that this corruption of nature during this life doth remain in those that are regenerated and that it self and all the motions of it are truly properly sin
found the catholique doctrin to be firmly founded in the scriptures to have been zealously defended by the holy fathers who account them infidels who deny it and to be agreable to the very instinct of almost all christians
and consequently the presbyterian belief which is iust opposite must be against all these as also found it to have been an ancient heresy and that it is so false and absurd that diverse protestants have been scandalized at it and abandonned it and some have condemned it as blasphemy
all which shall briefly touch

that baptisme taketh away original yea and all sin the scripture sufficiently sheweth

ananias said to paul
arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins
peter gave this advice to the iewes be every one of you baptized for the remission of your sins
paul saith that christ hath loved his church and delivered himself for it that he might sanctifie it cleansing it by the lauer of water in the word
again he hath saved vs by the lauer of regeneration
peter saith baptisme saveth you also
if then baptisme washeth away our sins how are they not taken away if we be cleansed from sin how can the filthinesse of sin remain if we be borne of new again in the lauer of regeneration how can the old man or death of sin abide in vs christ is called in the scripture the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world
but how could he be said to take away the sins of the world if he did not take away original sin which is the sin of the whole world and how is that sin taken away but by baptisme these places of scripture appeare so clear for this truth that without great violence they cannot be wrested to an other sense
but now let vs heare the iudgment of the holy fathers of the primitive church

augustin sheweth the doctrin of the ancient church against the pelagians who falsely alleadged that the catholiques maintaind baptisme did not take away all sins but did only shave them for which supposed doctrin they branded the catholiques with the name of manichees
he puts down their calumny in these words these manichees do teach that

baptism doth not give remission of sins nor takes away crimes but only shaves them
to which calumny augustin answer's thus
who affirmes this against the pelagians vnlesse he be some infidel
for we teach that baptism gives remission of all sins and takes away crimes and not shaveth them
where may be observed not only what was the doctrin of the auncient church but also that the contrary is a point of the manichean heresy and that these who maintain it are infidels in augustins iudgment
again the same holy father sheweth the great vertue of baptism when he saith by the begetting flesh original sin is only contracted but by the regenerating spirit remission is made not only of original but also the of voluntary sins
chrysostom doth more largely illustrate this matter shewing that baptism doth not only take away sin but also bringeth many graces privileges to the persons baptized
they are

saith he not only made free but holy not only holy but iust not only iust but children not only children but heires not only heires but brethren of christ not only brethren of christ but coheires not only coheires but memhers not only the temple but the members of the spirit
yow see how many are the privileges of baptism
many indeed think that the heavenly grace consists only in the remissien of sins but we have reckoned ten privileges
for this cause we baptize infants

thus chrysostom
again the same holy father sheweth that albeit a sinner were defiled with all sorte of iniquity and tyed with the

bands of all wickednesse yet when he comes vnto this bath he riseth more pure then the beames of the sun
and as a little spark of fire cast into the deep sea is not leasurely but instantly extinguished by the aboundance of waters forthwith it is shewed to be nothing so all humane malice when it comes to the waters of these heavenly fountaines is more easily put out then the heate of that little spark
and least this should be thought to be said out of ambition or exaggeration he proves all from these words of paul
do not erre
neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers shall possesse the kingdome of god
and these things indeed you were but you are washed but you are sanctifyed but you are iustifyed
then after an excellent discours on the vertue of baptism he sheweth why it is not called the lauer of remission of sins nor the lauer of purification but the lauer of regenerion because saith he it doth not only forgive our ssns nor simply purify vs who were wrapped vp in wickednesse but it makes vs as if we were borne from heaven
more testimonies need not to be added since the centurists do confesse that the most auncient fathers as clement

iustin cyprian and many others maintain'd the same doctrine
yea they maintain'd this so eagerly that some of them do brand those who believe the contrary with the note of infidelity as we have seen lately out of augustin

to whom also accordeth gregory the great who saith that nothing can be more vnfaithfull then to

teach that sins are only superficially or not fully taken away in baptism

moreover this truth is so engrafted in the hearts of christians that the most part of protestants believes it albeit it be against the faith of their church and albeit it be also true that few of them know so much
hence it came to passe that diverse presbyterians were scandalized at some words which a great apostle of the covenant spake lately against this truth
for when one striving to cleare himself before the presbytery of some imputation wherewith he was charged had said that he was as innocent of that whereof he was accused as he was free of original sin by baptisme the said apostle presently took him vp sharply told him that he was speaking flat popery and that neither he nor any man whosoever would be freed from original sin so long as they lived
wherevpon many to whose eares this discourse came took great offence as if this had been the private opinion of that minister not knowing that it was also the belief of the presbyterian church and of their first reformers
hence it may appeare that this article of the presbyterian faith is not only against the scriptures holy fathers but also against the very instinct of almost all christians and besids all these absurdities found it to have been a most auncient heresy defended by the origenists who thought as epiphanius witnesseth

that sins were not taken away by baptism but only covered and were at length purged by

death
so that we have for the most part auncient and condemned heresies for the articles of the presbyterian faith
yea a famous protestant of germany condemnes this opinion in the name of his lutheran brethren as a blasphemie against the holy scriptures
this blasphemie

saith he of the calvinists that baptism doth not purge sins the holy ghost in in many places refuteth
all which besides many other considerations were more then sufficient to hinder me from making such a pernicious errour which indeed makes baptism of no effect an article of my faith

will conclude this matter with the testimonies of two most renowned fathers who found by experience the wonderfull effects of baptisme

augustin doth relate how a dear of his whom he had infected with the errours and heresies which himself followed before his conversion falling extreamly sick being without vnderstanding or sense was in that condition baptized
and how thereafter he coming to his senses augustin began to iest him with the baptism which he had received without vnderstanding
but saith the father he found that he had received it and abhorred me as an enemy admonishing me with a wonderfull libertie that would leave off to speak such things if would remain a friend
whereat
augustin professeth that he much admired to see such a change wrought in the mind by that which was done in the body of him who at that time knew not

what they did

cyprian also ingenuously confesseth what a vitious man himself was before baptism and how suddenly he was changed and became an other man by the grace which he received in that sacrament and acknowledging thankfully the many benefites which christianity conferred vpon him he calleth it truly the death of sins and the life of vertues
the like admirable change was also wrought by baptism in the soule of augustin
by all which may be knowen that baptism not only purgeth the soule from sin and adorneth it with grace but also it changeth admirably the mind of man
the false supposition of the presbyterians that original sin is nothing else but concupiscence shall be hereafter refuted in the triall of the covenant
chap

that baptism is necessary for the salvation of infants· which is denyed by the presbyterians

took notice of a other da~gerous errour which was taught by our first reformers and is yet maintain'd by the presbyterians against the necessity of baptism
for as they teach that baptism taketh not a way original sin so they belieue that it is not necessary for salvation that children dying without that sacrament may be saved
vpo

this dangerous doctrin followeth a most dangerous practise
fot they believing baptism not to be necessary suffer many children to die without it and they have also made a law abrogating all private baptism
our first reformers shew their minde clearly

when they say in their first confession that baptism isnoto of such necessity that the want of it can be hurtfull to the salvation of children
and they deny also the profitt of it when they subioyn that many have ben baptized and yet were never inwardly purged
the same is almost repeated by our new presbyterian reformers in their late confession at westminster where they say that grace and salvation are not so necessarly annexed vnto baptism that no person can be saved or regenerated without it or that all that are baptized are vndoubtedly regenerated
these doctrines and practises are from calvin the first foundator of presbytery who taught that the children of the faithfull are holy from their mothers womb are already sanctifyed and have remission of their sins and that they have need of baptism not as of a help necessary but as of seale ordain'd by god to seale in them the grace of adoption
and if they die they may be saved without baptism
and according to this doctrin he made a law in geneva that the children to be baptized should expect sermon and he suffered a child to dye without baptisme because it was brought a little late to the church as florimond reymond testifyeth
now found the opposite doctrin to witt that baptism is necessary for the salvation of infants to be most firmly founded in gods word to haue been strongly and zealously defended by the holy fathers and the ancient church and to be conforme to the general instinct of christians
therefore the presbyrian doctrin which is contrary must be against all those
and besids found it to be an auncient heresy and to be so dangerous and pernicious an errour that diverse famous protestants have abandonned it
all which points shall briefly touch


our saviour saith clearly in the scripture vnles a man be borne again of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god

which place the holy fathers and the ancient church vnderstood of baptism

augustin sheweth that this place was so expresse convincing that it confounded the pelagians who denyed original sin and made them acknowledge the necessity of baptism although not for the remission of original sin which they denyed yet for the attayning of the kingdom of heaven
but yet to maintain their errour they foolishly imagined that children might be saved without baptism although without it

they could not enter into heaven
vrbanus regius a famous protestant in germany saith that the right beleeving fathers and christians vnderstood this place of baptism
and to beleeve saith he that none either man or child can be saved without baptism both the scripture and the authority

of the auncient church compelleth vs

for the fathers we shall bring augustin who writeth thus to hierome
whosoever saith that such children shall have life in christ who depart this life without participatien of the sacrament of baptism that man questionlesse gainsayeth the preaching of the apostles and condemneth the whole church where such hast is made to runne with children because it is beleeved without doubt that otherwise they cannot at all be quickned in christ
and in another place he saith most earnestly do not beleeve do not say do not tea that children preveened by death before they receive baptism can attayn remission of their original sin if you desire to be a catholique
and that this was not only the belief of augustin but also of the other holy fathers as of cyprian nazianzen hierom

ambrose hilarius the centurists themselves do acknowledge yea the carthaginian milevitan councels as augustin testifieth professed the same and condemned their opinion who think that children can be saved without baptism
and that the necessity of baptism is conforme to the generall instinct of christians may appeare by the former testimony of augustin where he sheweth that christians make such haste and are so earnest to have their children baptised because they believe that otherwise they cannot be quickned in christ
therefore the presbyterian doctrin which denyeth the necessity of baptism gainsayeth the scriptures fathers and

against the common belief of christians

moreover it was condemned

as an old heresy in the pelagians
for they denyed also that baptism was necessary for the remission of original sin
there is indeed this difference between them the presbyterians that they denying original sin thought it not necessary for the remission of it albeit they esteem'd it necessary for the attayning the kingdom of heaven
but the presbyterians graunting original sin believe that baptism is neither necessary for the remission of it nor for obtaining of heaven and so their errour in this point is greater then that of the pelagians
for they promise the kingdom of heaven to children dying without baptism which the pelagians presumed not to do it being so clearly against the scriptures

that diverse famous protestants have abandonned this errour and do hold that salvation is not promised to the children of the faithfull dying without baptism breirly sheweth in the protestants apology

where he cites for this purpose the confession of auxburg vrbanus regius hosmanus bilson bishop of winchester and others
king iames also in the conference at maintain'd that baptism was necessarie by the necessity of command albeit he did not think it necessarie by the necessitie of means
all which considerations were more then sufficient motives to make me abandon the presbyterian opinion and to embrace the catholique

belief concerning the necessity of haptism for the salvation of infants

but finding that the presbyterians have principally two exceptions against the ancient catholique doctrin proposed them to a catholique for my greater satisfaction
first said the presbyterians do alleadge that the necessity of baptism is against the power of god· by tying him to the ordinary means

they affirm that it is against his mercy to exclude so many children from the kingdom of heaven
and therefore in their covenant they accuse you who are catholiques of cruel iudgment against children dying without baptism
to which the catholique answered that these pretences were frivolous
for first said he that cannot be against gods power which is according to his divine will by which his power is in some kind limited
now god whose power is infinit and who might save children by many other means then by baptism hath declared his will th vnlesse a man be borne again he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven and therefore so much as we know by his reveal'd will he hath appointed no other remedie for original sin but baptism which being determinated by gods proper will cannot be against his power
neither is god hereby tyed to any ordinary means but to such wherevnto he hath freely determinated himself according to his will
vpon which only will of god and his divin institution and not vpon the fancy speculation of man do depend the

remedies which are necessarie for the salvation of infants
now gods will and institution cannot be knowen but by the divin revelation and god hath reveal'd no other remedie but baptism
therefore as the catholiques do well by grounding their faith on the divin revelation and by vseing all diligence to apply the remedie which is appointed by christ for the salvation of infants so the presbyterians do ill by founding their faith in this point not vpon the scriptures but vpon vncertain coniectures which are also against the scriptures and they do also ill by neglecting the remedie ordain'd by god to expose the salvation of infants to meer vncertainties
augustin saith excellently to this purpose let not according to our fancy eternal salvation be promised to infants dying without the baptism of christ which the divin scriptures preferable to all humane ingines do not promise
secondly the catholique said that the presbyterians speak not consequentially when they say that gods power should not be tyed to the ordinary means
for by this phrase they would make people believe that they esteem'd baptism the ordinarie mean of taking away or of pardoninng original sin which indeed they do not
for they teach with calvin that original sin is taken away before baptism which doth not according to them purge or forgive sin but is only a scale of sin already forgiven
and therefore the presbyterians in this matter both contradict themselves and would deceive others

next the same catholique shew me that the presbyterians by their other pretence would seem to plead for the mercy of god as they did by the first for his power but with a like bad successe and that they very vnreasonably accuse the catholiques iudgment
for it is no crueltie to conform our iudgments to the iudgment of god which we know by his own revelation
gods iudgments although they be sometimes so secret that we cannot alwayes penetrate into the true causes of them yet it is most certain that they are ever iust and therefore not cruell
but as in this matter gods iudgment is clearly reveal'd so it is very easy to find the cause of it to witt original sin which as it was contracted by generation from adam so it must be purged and taken away by regeneration in christ or else he who is truth it self saith that none can enter into the kingdom of heaven
besides the catholiques iudgment against infants dying without baptism is not so cruel as the presbyterians iudgment is cruel against many children dying with baptism
for the more common sentence of catholique divines is that children dying without baptism are not troubled with any sensible paine but that they are only excluded for want of it from the supernaturall happinesse which the baptized enioy in heaven and that otherwise they leade a happie life but the presbyterians in their new confession teach that all children baptized are not vndoubtedly regenerated to which is consequent

that many infants baptised are not saved as not belonging to the covenant of grace which bucer did expresse more clearly

when he saith that children predestinate are saved without baptism and the not predestinate are damned even with baptism
now enquire which of these two iudgments is more cruell to say that children dying without baptism do not enter into heaven but yet they suffer no sensible paine or to say that many children dying with baptism are not only excluded from heaven but are also eternally tormented in hell with sensible paines without all doubt the last which is the iudgment of the presbyterians is incomparably more cruell
moreover it is more rigorous then the iudgment of these other catholiques divines who teach that infants dying without baptism are not only excluded from heaven but are condemned to hell and to some sensible paines therein for the same reason
for it is more rigorous without doubt to condemne to hells sensible paines some infants that are baptized and some that are not then to iudge that the only not baptized children are liable to that paine
by this it may be seen that the presbyrians who accuse others falsly of cruell iudgment against children dying without baptism are guilty themselves of more cruell iudgement against children dying with baptism

but albeit said he the catholiques iudgment in this matter were false or cruell as the presbyterians do alleadge yet there followeth

no cruelty nor inconuenience vpon it to children who are thereby with the greater care and commiseration carried in all haste to baptism
so that this pretended cruelty in iudgment produceth true mercy compassion in action
but if the presbyterians doctrine be false as it must be if the criptures· fathers councels be true great evils and cruelties follow vpon it to the children
fot thereby many of them are suffered to die without baptism and so are cruelly deprived of their salvation
these mens pretended mercy in iudment produceth reall cruelty in their actions
thus he in answer to my doubts

moreover the same catholique shew me that according to the catholique doctours the baptism of infants may be supplyed by martyrdom which is also called baptism in the scripture as when our saviour said to the children of zebedee can you be baptized with the baptism wherewith am baptized
and so the church did of old and doth still honour the innocent children murdered by herod as martyrs
the same is also verifyed of those who are come to age as augustin testifieth
whosoever also

saith he not having teceived the lawer of regeneration dyeth for the confession of christ it availeth as much to him for remission of his sins as if they had been washed away in the sacred font of
the baptism of water may be supplyed also by a true conversion to god when the baptism of water is not contemned but rather desired and yet through some necessity

men die without it as ambrose testifieth of valentinian the yonger· haue lost him

saith he whom was to regenerate but he hath not lost the grace which he hoped for
this true conversion penance is also called baptism in the scriptures for it is said that iohn preached baptism of penance vnto remission of sins
and according to this doctrin the ancients did handsomly distinguish three kinds of baptism which they called sanguinis flaminis fluminis that is the baptism of blood of the spirit of water

lastly he said that although baptism were not a necessarie mean ordained by god for salvation of infants yet it hath the necessitie of a command to pastors

as is evident by our saviours words to the apostles goe and teach all nations baptizeing them
therefore although it were supposed that no hurt come to the children dying without baptism yet they who by their office are obliged to baptize commit a great sin when they wilfully neglect to obey christs command which the presbyterian pastors manifestly do suffering so many children notwithstanding the many teares and cries of their parents to die without baptism
and according to this observation king iames answered well a minister in scotland who enquired of him if he thought baptism so necessarie that if it were omitted the child would be damned
no said the king but verily believe if yow being called to baptise a child in danger of death would refuse to do it

that you would be damned
this answer may be seen in the first dayes conference at
where it is also shewed that such a neglect of baptisme is not only a damnable sin in the minister but likwise that it is very da~gerous for the child
for who saith the bishop of london hath any of religion and would not by all meanes be carefull that his child receive baptism who would not rather assure his action vpon the promises of iesus christ then the omission of it vpon the secret iudgment of god then whereas the ministers do alleadge that christs command extends only to publique and not to private baptism this is a meer fancy without any ground in scripture where no such distinctio is made yea it is against scripture
for do we not read that paul was baptized privatly by ananias and the eunuch by philip

but they who teach that gods commandments are impossible to be kept and make dayly profession to break them may let this passe with the rest
these and diverse other inconsequentiall errours of the presbyterians concerning baptim he did manifest vnto me which for brevities sake omitt

therefore to conclude this point cannot believe the presbyterian doctrin against the necessity ob baptism because is against our saviours expresse words against the holy fathers whole ancient church because it is an ancient heresy condemned in the pelagians because it is against the common instinct of christians and is condemned by diverse famous

protestants so that king iames the head of a famous protestant church iudged it damnable in the ministers and his prelats esteem'd it most dangerous to the infants
for which dangerous doctrin and the cruel practise flowing from it can find no other ground but ministerial tradition from geneva and that against the scriptures and all the former authorities
florimond above cited sheweth

how this tradition descended from calvin and that musculus superintendent of berne deposed a minister named samuel hueber for having baptized a child in the night when it was in danger of death and beza did assist to that censure
moreover he sheweth how in a protestant synod at figear it was ordain'd that the ministers should comfort the parents of children dying without baptism but all in vaine so that the ministers of poictou in an aslembly at chastelrauld in the yeare
were enforced to give way to ministers to baptize in private houses that they might avoid the cryes of tender hearted mothers
have heard of some pittiful accidents that have fallen forth in our countrey vpon this same occasion so that some mothers have almost gone out of their witts when the ministers suffered their children to die without baptism
and knew a protestant father who for this same reason took great indignation at all presbyterian ministers
such a strong impression hath god made of this truth in the hearts of the simple people who in many other things have

suffered themselves to be too simply misled to abandon the truth
by all which it may be how the presbyterians make void and destroy the sacrament of baptism
chap
xxi
of the reall presence of christs body in the holy sacrament which is denyed by the presbyterians

as the presbyterians by denying both the effect and of bapism do in effect quite take away that so holy and necessary a sacrament so conceived if it be true that christs body be really present in the eucharist as the catholiques beleeve that the presbyterians who deny the reall presence and do give vs nothing but signes and tokens of christs body do also destroy this other most excellent sacrament
the catholiques belief in this point

is clearly set down by the councel of trent where it is said the holy synod doth openly and simply professe that in the sacrament of the eucharist after the consecration of bread wine our lord iesus christ true od true man is truly really suhstantially contain'd
our first scott sh confession speaks not so clearly
for after some ambiguity of words by which it would seem to graunt the reall presence it acknowledged that hrists body is only in the heavens
for it saith that

the holy ghost by true faith carrieth vs above all things that are visible and maketh vs to feed vpon the body blood of christ iesus which is in the heavens
and yet notwithstanding the far distance of place which is betwixt his body now grorifyed in the heavens and vs now mortall in this earth yet we assuredly beleeve
the late gonfession of westminster albeit it vseth also some ambiguous expressions yet it affirmeth that christs body is not corporally or carnally in with or vnder the bread wine

and its knowen also that the presbyterians do zealously maintaine that christs body is only in the heavens and that it is impossible even to the omnipotency of god to make a body to be present in two places at once
and therefore according to them christs body cannot be really present in the sacrament

although this be a most important question and is much agitated by the curiosity of carnal reason yet was soone satisfyed in it because was resolved by gods grace to found my faith vpon no other ground but vpon the divine scriptures as they were vnderstood by the ancient church holy fathers
and therefore after a little diligence and some conference with a catholique on this matter found that the reall presence of christs body in the sacrament was conforme to the clear words of the scriptures which were so vnderstood by the holy fathers and which in right reason cannot be otherwise vnderstood and that god hath approved this truth by famous miracles
and

vpon the other part found that the presbyerian doctrin is against scriptures fathers councels and right reason that it is an ancient heresy and so false that many protestants do eagerly oppose it and lastly that such great confusion was in this matter among the first apostles of this new religion that it is no wonder to see it so much multiplied among their children
all which points will briefly touch


the catholiques bring expresse scripture for the reall presence to witt the words of institution of this holy sacrament related by three evangelists and one apostle where our saviour alwayes saith this is my body
this is my blood
and to know that he mean'd of his true reall body he adioyneth my body which shall be given for you and my blood which shall be shed for you
now it was his reall body which was given for them and his reall blood which was shed for them

therefore it was his reall body reall blood which they received in the sacrament
moreover iohn relateth along discourse which our saviour had to the iewes in which he affirmes that he was the bread of life that came down from heaven
and the bread which he was to give was his flesh for the life of the world and vnlesse they eate his flesh and drink his blood they should have no life in them
and notwitstanding that the iewes murmured at all these things saying how can this man give vs his flesh to eate and this is a hard saying who

can heare it yet our saviour did with many asseverations affirm it over and over again yea and the suffered them to depart from him because they would not believe this divine mystery
now christ is not a mocker or deceiver of men to speak one thing yea and to averre it with asseverations which are equivalent to oaths and to intend the contrary
christ is not ignorant of the vsual manner of speech therefore since he tells the apostles plainly that the eucharist is his body delivered for them it must be his body as the catholiques beleeve and cannot be not his body as the presbyterians imagine
if the scripture be iudge of controversies then this controversie is decyded for that iudge to which protestants make ordinarly their appeales hath so determined the cause against them that they dare not stand to the clear words of their iudge in so much that some learned protestants do confesse that the scripture taken in the native proper and literal sense is plainly for the catholiques against themselves and namely morton when he speaks thus to the catholiques
if the words he certainly true in a proper and literal sense then we are to yeeld to you the whole cause
and therefore they are enforced to runne to their tropes figures

but found the holy fathers making no such glosses on our saviours clear words taking them in their proper sense
augustin

citing these words of our saviour this is my body

speaks thus a man may be carried by the hands of others no man is carried in his own hands but christ was carried in his own hands when recome~ding his body he himself said this is my body
for he carried himself in his own ha~ds
and again we receive with a faithfull heart and month the mediator of god and man the man iesus christ who giveth vs his flesh to eate ambrose saith clearly
before consecration it is bread but when the words of consecration come it is the body of christ
heare him saying take eate
this is my body chrysostom saith he who sitteth above with the father in that same instant of time miracle the bounty of god is touched by the hands of all and he gives himself to those who will receive and embrace him
cyprian
the bread which our lord gave to his disciples being changed not in shape but in nature by the omnipotency of the word is made flesh
many more testimonies of these and of the other holy fathers in all the first ages even vntill the time of the apostles

may be seen collected by coccius and gualterus
so that found both the scriptures fathers giving sentence against the presbyterians
the first for the letter and the other for the sense

this same truth is also confirmed by the testimonie and authority of the vniuersal church in general councels as the first nicen councel whose words bellarmin cites
the third generall councel of ephesus to which cyrill of alexandria did preside by which synod the

epistle of cyrill to nestorius where the real presence of christs body in the eucharist is contain'd was approved as it was thereafter by the fourth and fift generall councels to speak nothing of other more late councels

besides all these authorities it was also made evident vnto me by the light of reason that our saviours words concerning the institution of this sacrament cannot be but literally vnderstood
for
the principall articles or points of our faith are not delivered in the scriptures but in proper and clear words
but this by all mens confession is a principall mystery of our faith
therefore it is delivered in clear and plaine tearmes

that cannot be ascrybed to christ without blasphemy which no reasonable or prudent man would do
but no reasonable or prudent man would make his testament in obscure and figurative words for that were the high way to deceive his children heires and put them at variance
therefore since christ at the institution of this sacrament a little before his death was making his testament as is manifest by his words when he calleth the chalice the new testament in his blood by which he left vnto his children the most precious legacie of his body for their comfort nourishment he spake properly clearly and not figuratively

promised the iewes a more excellent foode then manna

to witt the bread of life his own flesh but if the sacrament were meer bread and not christs body it would not be more

excellent then manna which was called the bread of angels but much inferiour to it as is evident

christ who is goodnesse and wisdom it self would not for tropes and figures have vsed so many asseverations as are set down in the
chapter of iohn
neither would he have suffered so many of his disciples and others to go away from him after so many doubts proposed by them but he would have cleared the matter vnro them
lastly
if this liberty be once graunted to expound the scripture figuratively when we are not forced to it by any other scripture or article of our faith then nothing will remaine but vncertaine opinions of divine things and so by this means the whole mysteries of the christian religion may be denyed or overturned
for there is no more requisite according to this licentious rule but that some few novelists think a mystery impossible albeit all the holy fathers ancient church did ever esteem it not only possible but also a truth reveal'd by god and an article of their faith
and so diverse heretiques have imagined the mysterie of the incarnation of the holy trinity and such like principal articles of the christian religion to be impossible and therefore have expounded all the scriptures which speak of them figuratively as the presbyterians do here
for these reasons besides the authority of the holy fathers it appear'd sufficiently evident to me that the words of christ concerning the holy sacrament ought to be literally plainly vnderstood and not figuratively

this truth also of the reall presence was shewed to me to betestifyed and confirmed from heaven by miracles both auncient and modern which are related by famous and faithfull authors
for either some singular benefites have been obtain'd by the faith of this holy sacrament as expulsion of devils deliverance from shipwrack and the like or some punishments have fallen vpon those who either did not beleeve the reall presence or vsed the sacrament irreverently or some visions and apparitions of christ in the forme of a child or flesh have been seen to confirm those who were doubtfull of the reall presence
of the first sorte

prosper bringeth an example which fell out at carthage how a young arabian maide who by a certaine sin made her self an habitation to the devil by whom she was so miserably vexed some dayes that her throat being stopped she could receive no meat or drink was at length delivered by the communion of the sacred body of our lord
but most famous is that miracle which
bernard by the holy sacrament did at milan before innumerable people
for he cured a woman who had been possessed many yeares by the devil and was rather a monster then a woman

by holding the holy sacrament above her head and saying wicked spirit here is present thy iudge
here is the highest power resist now if thou canst
now said he the prince of this world shall be cast forth
this is that body which was taken of the body of the virgin

which was stretched on the tree of the crosse which lay in the sepulchre which in the sight of his disciples ascended vnto heaven
command thee wicked spirit in the terrible power of this maiesty that going out of this hand maid of our lord thou presume to touch her no more
god approved the truth of bernards faith which was alwayes the faith of the catholique church by granting his desire

the like miracle was done in this last age at laon in picardie on the person of a young woman named nicolas obry as is related with many admirable circumstances by an eye witnesse florimond reymond counsellour of the parliament of burdeaux by which miracle he professeth himself to have been drawen out of the gulf of heresie

ambrose doth also relate how his brother satyrus by the great faith he had of this holy sacrament was miraculously delivered from shipwrack

how god hath punished those who have abused or blasphem'd this holy sacrament both auncient and modern histories do shew cyprian relateth many of these miracvlous punishments

which fell out in his time so that some were filled with vnclean spirits others were turned into madnesse
optatus doth shew that the donatists who threw the holy sacrament of the catholiques vnto dogges immediatly thereafter felt the divine iudgment for the dogges becoming enraged did set vpon their own masters and tore them in pieces
the above named florimond doth

relate how an arian woman of cracovie in the yeare
looking out at her window and seeing the holy sacrament caried in procession cry'd out behold the beare which the papists carie and adore
but immediatly she was punished for the devil seazing on her did so torment her that blaspheming she expired in her husbands armes
moreover

the sheweth that a iew having made himself christian did steale out of a catholique church three consecrated hosties with which he fled to hungarie where he sold one of them to a iew in presburg and with the other two he went to another town called nickesburg where he assembled diverse of his companions to shew their outrage against the sacrament
whence it came to passe that one of the company taking a knife did stob the sacred hostie which was lying on a table saying if thou be the god of the christians shew it by some miracle
the blow was no sooner given but the blood did spring vp by which they were astonished and in the same houre thunder came from heaven which destroyed that house and consumed into ashes that wicked company except only three who half burnt were left to be witnesses of their wickednesse and having escaped the fire of heaven were severly punished by the hand of man as the author recounts
this miracle was so much the more famous that the table and the two hosties of which one was pierced by a knife were found entire

among the middest of these ashes and were collected at the sight of innumerable people
this miracle fell out in the yeare
passe by many more which were showen me to this purpose

lastly for the comfort of the faithfull or for confirmation of the doubtfull some visions have appeared in the holy sacrament
that which is recounted in the life of the great is very remarkable
the historie is briefly this
when gregorie was giving the sacrament to the people he came to a woman who smiled when he said to her the body of our lord iesus christ preserue thy soule wherevpon the pope did withdraw his hand lay'd the sacrame~t on the altar
after the holy solemnities were ended he enquired at the woman why she had laughed in so dreadfull an action
she in end confessed that she could not acknowledge that bread which she had made with her own hands to be the body of christ
then gregorie prayed god earnestly for her and obtain'd that the bread even in external forme should be turned into flesh by which miracle he both reduced the woman vnto the faith and confirmed the people in it
the faith of lowis king of france

concerning this sacrament is much celebrated
for when he being advertised that a most beavtifull child had appeard in the holy sacrament was desired to come and see this miracle he refused to goe saying that these miracles were done for these who doubted but for himself he was most certaine that christ iesus was truly

present in the eucharist
an other such apparition was seen at doway in the yeare
continueda good time

so that great numbers of people came from diverse parts to see it and the memory of it is every yeare celebrated in that town with great solemnity
by all which considerations was sufficiently satisfyed of the catholique belief concerning the reall presence which found to be containd in the holy scriptures beleeved by the holy fathers
and by general councels and to be confirmed by miracles
and therefore could not any longer believe the presbyterian doctrin which against all these authorities makes the body of christ to be as far distant from the sacrament as the heavens are from the earth


perceived that they scarcely pretend to have scripture for them but are enforced to runne from the clear words of it to their tropes figures

which augustin observed long ago to be the custom of erroneous persons so soone saith he as the opinion of any errour hath once prepossessed their minds they esteeme all to be figures
which the scripture saith to the contrarie
and therefore albeit the scripture saith not once but foure times that the eucharist is the body and blood of iesus christ without ever saying in any one place that it is not his body but only a figure of it they beleeve the one which it saith not and not the other which it affirmes
against them iohn damascen saith efficaciously the bread wine is

not a figure of the body blood of christ god forbid it were that but it is the divine body of our lord he himself saying this is my body

they passe from the scriptures fathers and found their negative faith vpon their senses and some carnal reasons

against which vaine pretences chrysostom saith well
let vs beleeve god every where let vs not oppose him although that which he saith seem absurd to our sense vnderstanding
let his speech overcome our sense and reason which in all things we ought to do cheefly in the mysteries not only looking to that which lieth before vs but also holding fast his words
for we cannot be deceived by his words our sense may be easily deceived these cannot be false this is often deceived
because therefore he hath said this is my body let vs not be holden by any doubt but let vs beleeve and comprehend it the ey's of of our vnderstanding

cyrill speaks no lesse efficaciously against those who pretend this mystery to be against reason and impossible compareing them to incredulous iewes
a malignant minde saith he doth presently reiect as frivolous false what it doth not vnderstand yeelding to none nor thinking any thing to be aboue it self as we shall find the iewes to have been
for when it became them who had seen the divine vertue the miracles of our saviour to receive his speech willingly and if any thing seemed difficult to have asked the resolution of him they did the quit contrarie and cryed out together against god not without great impietie
how can this man give vs his flesh neither did it come into

their minde that there is nothing impossible with god for since they were sensual as paul speaks they could not vnderstand spiritual things and so great a mystery seemed to them to be follie
but let vs make great profit by other mens sins
let us have a firme faith in these mysteries let vs neuer speak nor think that word how
that's meerly iudaical and the cause of great punishment
thus cyrill

the presbyterians do wrest our saviours words by a figurative interpretation against all reason as hath been shewed

then found this presbyterian doctrin

to have been an ancient heresie of simon magus and menander and thereafter of berengarius who at his death did recant of the albigenses and of diverse others
yea gualterus brings some testimonies of the holy fathers to shew that iudas the traitor denyed the reall presence and did not believe our saviours words in the
chapter of iohn
lastly diverse famous protestants have abandoned that doctrin of calvin
as bishop andrews who writes thus against bellarmin
we agree faith he with yow of the matter all the contention is about the manner a presence say we believe not lesse reall then yow
casaubon made the like profession in name of king iames of the whole church of england

and whereas heard so much cryed out against transubstantiation as a thing impossible and a noveltie lately introduced into the church found both these allegations to be

false
for the holy fathers do shew both the possibility and the verity of it out of the scriptures

cyrill saith christ changed once water into wine which is near vnto blood and is he not worthy to be believed of vs that he hath changed wine into blood
ambrose having shewed the power of christs speech how by it he gave a being to the world which had no being before saith how much more then operative is it that these things which were might have a being and be converted into another
again the same holy father calls this change a conversion of nature substance bringing examples out of the old testament of moyses rod turned into a serpent of water turned into blood
you see then saith he that by prophetical grace nature was twise changed what shall we then say of the divine consecration it self where the words of our saviour do operate if the speech of elias was so prevalent that it brought down fire from heaven shall not the speech of christ prevaile to change the species or nature of the elements

cyprian above cited saith that the bread is changed not in shape but in nature and by the omnipotency of the wotd is made flesh
gregory nyssen affirmeth that the bread wine are transelemented
and iohn damascen averreth that the elements are transchanged ascribing also that change to the omnipotency of god albeit we cannot know the manner how it is done
neither is that much to be admired for the same father saith we can hardly tell how bread and wine or water

by eating drinking are turned into the substance of our body blood
if we can hardly know the manner of that change which is made every day by nature how can we think to comprehend the manner of this supernatural change which is made in the divine mysteries by the omnipotent power of the god of nature these testimonies besides others shew me sufficiently both the possibility antiquity of the thing signified by transubstantiation to witt a conversion of the whole substance of the bread and wine into the substance of christs body blood the outward formes or accidents of bread wine remaining
therefore the presbyterians do affirm very rashly in their new confession that this change is not only repugnant to scripture but also to common sense and reason seing the holy fathers who cannot with any modestie be denyed to have common sense and reason did believe and prove it both by the scriptures reason
at least resolved to preferre alwayes the common sense of the fathers to the private sense of the presbyterians
then when the thing it self is clear it is great follie in some to make out cryes against the word transubstantiation which they may do as well vpon the same ground against the words trinity consubstantial
if they receive these vpon the authority of the church and a general councel why not the other also vpon the same authority if the change of our saviours figure or countenance vpon mount thabour

be fitly called transfiguration

why may not also this substantial change of the elements into his body blood be iustly called transubstantiation yea beza plainly confesseth that if the letter of the scripture be followed papistical transubstantiation is established

and we have seen that the letter must be followed

as saw great vnity among the catholiques in their belief concerning the holy sacrament so admired to find such dissension and confusion among protestants in so substantial a point of the christian religion and that this confusion should have risen even among their chief apostles and the first builders of their high tower of reformation

for luther teacheth that christs body is truely and really in the sacrament but that the substance of the bread is not changed into it and that they remayne both together
zuinglius opposed his master and taught that the sacrament is only a bare signe of christs body which is not in or with the elements but only really int he heavens
then calvin the third apostle came in with pretence of a third light wherewith he would illuminate the world and reform these reformers
first he taught with zuinglius against luther that christs body is only really in the heavens and not in the elements
then against zuinglius he saith that the elements are not bare signes but they exhibite vnto vs the true body blood of christ which we eate by the mouth of faith
and because it seems impossible to eate any thing remaining

at so great a dista~ce he telleth yow that this mysterie is vnperceptible as indeed it is in his opinion which is more hard to conceive then the belief of the catholiques because it is impossible and hath no ground neither in scriptures nor fathers
but as some grave authours have observed calvins opinion of the sacrament differs nothing in reality from the opinion of zuinglius except only in obscurity of words which are trimmed vp to deceive men putting them in hopes of realities but indeed giving them nothing but bare figures
for which cause luther and his disciples do brand both zuinglius calvin and their successors with the infamous name of sacramentarian heretiques
we do seriously censure saith he zuinglians all sacramentaries as heretiques strangers from the church of god
again take god to witnesse the whole world that do not agree with them nor shall ever agree with them so long as the world endureth but shall keep my hands free from the blood of those whom these heretiques draw from christ whom they deceive and murder
he leaveth also a perpetual curse to all those who will make peace with them which curse his disciples have diligently shun'd
yea he professeth that amongst other things the devil counselled himself to deny the real presence to which he did not give consent by reason of christs clear words to the contrarie
but what the devil could not do in this point with the master he performed by his scholler zuinglius who by his own confession learned

this opinion of a spirit in the night for which cause luther saith that the devil doth now ever dwell in the zuinglians that their blasphemous breasts are insatanized supersatanized and persatanized with many other horrible expressions of which the zuinglians say did ever a man heare such words proceed from a furious and infernal devil
luthers schollers do continue their masters zeale for one of them very famous

writes that as of old averroes the arabian the pagans iewes railed at the christians for their beleef of christs reall presence so do now hostes abiurati testamenti filij dei calvinistae blaspbemi the blasphemous calvinists the foresworne enemies of christs and with the auncient pagans they take great pleasure with poisoned and devilish blasphemies to deface and inveigh against the receiving of christs true body which we by christs words defend
and having shewed by all circumstances that the words of christs institution ought to be litterally vnderstood he concludes in these words
horrible therefore and detestable is the malice of the sacramentaries that this so clear a word they do perversly interprete and change into significations tropes and figures

melanchton also saith that these words of christ this is my body fulmina erunt they shall be thunderbolts against those who deny the beleef of christ true body in the sacrament
thus we have seen what iudgment luther and his followers have of the zuinglians calvinists for their negative belief of the real presence

neither is the iudgment of the zuinglians and calvinists much better of the others for their beleef of the reall presence by consubstantiation
zuinglius speaking to this purpose of luther saith behold how satan endeavoures to possesse wholly that man
and his tigurin schollers speak yet more clearly
luther calleth vs say they a damned execrable sect but let him take heed least he shew himself as an heretique who will not or cannot communicate with these who do professe christ
how clearly doth luther here shew himself to have a devil how many filthy things breathing all the devils of hell doth he belsh forth calvin saith we affirm that they to witt the lutherans do speak and think more grosly of the corporal presence then the papists
and in another place he saith speaking of the eucharist have shewed a long time ago that the papists are a little more modest and sober in their raveries then they
beza affirmeth that we cannot insist vpon the letter of these words of christ this is my body but papistical transubstantiation is established and again either transubstantiation is to be established or a figure
thus we see how these first apostles of protestants like the builders of babilon are divided in so important an article of the christian faith
the beleef of zinglius and calvin in this matter is heresy blasphemy to luther his schollers
and luthers faith to calvin is a meer raverie more insuportable then the popish transubstantiation
if this dissenssion

was so great at the beginning how great must it be now in the progresse how can these men be true apostles who disagreed so manifestly bitterly in such a necessarie princicipal point of the christian religion or what assurance can any man have who followeth such vnsure guides

to conclude this point could hardly desire greater satifaction for the catholique belief of the real presence then by gods grace found to witt expresse scriptures the holy fathers vniuersal church famous miracles the light of reason grounded vpon the goodnesse and wisdome of christ whereas for the presbyterian opinion which is an ancient heresie is condemned by the lutherans as a blasphemie found we had no scriptures but were enforced to flie from the clear words of it to tropes figures to some shallow carnal reasons against the scripture omnipotency of god which reasons saw clearly answered in the catholique writers and as a catholique shew me more strong reasons have been brought by pagans some heretiques against the mysterie of the trinitie incarnation
perceived also that the presbyterians involved their opinion in such obscurities that by their words one might collect they beleeved both a real presence a real absence and they made vse of either as the time required and that the most part of them did not know and could not tell what they beleeved
but at length when the best of them were well sifted

all ended in this that christs body was only in the heavens neither was it possible to be in the sacrament nor in two places at once
and so their pretended real presence proved indeed to be a real absence
in a word found that the presbyterians by taking away the real body of christ from this sacrament and giving vs an emptie figure do really take away the substance of this sacrament and so destroy it as they had done before to baptism by denying both the vertue and necessitie of it
and therefore in effect they have destroied both these sacraments which they would seem to have left
their doctrin which denyes the sacraments to conferre grace shewes that they esteem them graclesse and their seldom vseing of them especially of the eucharist manifests that they think them vselesse or fruiltlesse
both which errours augustin refuteth by these two excellent sentences without the grace saith he of invisible sanctification for what vse serve the visible sacraments
and again
the vertue of the sacraments vnspeakably availeth much and therefore it being contemned makes men sacrilegious
for that is impiously contemned without which piety is not perfited

some reflections vpon both the pretended scottish reformations

having found aboundant satisfaction for the truth of the catholique doctrin in the points lately tryed did freely acknowledge to the catholique by whose advice and assistance had made this last trial of our first reformation that did not only see the truth to be vpon the catholiques side but also that perceived a notable difference between the sublimity of the catholique doctrin and the lownesse of presbyterian opinions especially concerning rhe holy sacraments and particularly the eucharist
wherevpon he took occasion to shew me that there is indeed such a notable difference between the doctrines of the true church all heretical opinio~s;s that as some of the ancient fathers co~pare iustly heretiques to the prodigal child who left his fathers house so they fitly parallel their doctrines to the husks where with he was fed
for thus speaketh gregory nyssen
a fugitive from the faith went into a far countrey and divided his fathers goods into two halfes whilst he threw down sublime doctrines to base swinish opinions and wasted his riches with whoorish heresies
for heresy is a harlot which with pleasures as with deceits draweth many vnto her
so one who leaves the catholique

church that rich house of his heavenly father leaves also the heavenly bread of christs precious body wherewith his children are nourished and feasted and going astray vnto calvins congregation finds nothing but an empty drie calvinistical supper having nothing divine no iuice in it but bare signes figures which contayn lesse then manna or the shew bread of the ancient table
he leaves also the other sublime doctrines concerning the sacraments as how they conferre sanctifying grace purge the soule from sin and is turned vnto vaine opinions in which nothing is solid nothing stable that can satisfie the minde
therefore he striveth to satiat himself dayly with new opinions and idle inventions but all in vaine for these are nothing but husks which leave the bellie empty
there is no remedie for him but to return with the prodigal child vnto his fathers house where he will be received with ioy and feasted with the bread of angels

but said the catholique to make a general reflection vpon all that hath past vnder this trial do you not now clearly see how falsly these reformers pretend alwayes the scriptures to be for them when you have found the scriptures so expresly against them in all these principal points of the christian religion already examined and which is very considerable have you not seen these scriptures to be so vnderstood by the holy fathers in the pure and primitive times as they are now vnderstood

by the roman catholiques do not now perceive how heresy like a strumpet fardeth her self with the colours of the divin scriptures by which fain'd and false beauty she allures and deceives many but so soone as she is brought near the fire of triall how her fardings melt fall away and her own vglinesse appeares among heretiques saith augustin

there is nothing but the promise of truth a meer shew or pretext of it no performance
their doctrines are like the fruites of sodom and gomorrha which as iosephus testifyeth have a specious shew and appear pleasant vnto the eye but so soone as they are touched fall into ashes
so truly are all hereticall opinions they are given out for the fruites of pure scriptures they appeare very specious and pleasant but so soone as they are tryed diligently according to the scriptures and are touched as it were by the fingers of the holy fathers they presently evanish and nothing remaines but the flammes of heretical dissentions like the smoak of sodom gomorrha as a testimonie of the divin iudgment vpon them
have you not now seen that these two pretended scottish reformations have between them compleated the hydious work of desolation and destroyed the principal pillars of the christian religion and that as the later hath taken away two to witt the lords prayer and the apostles creed so the first hath taken away in effect the other two to witt the divin commandments and

the holy sacraments and so the presbyterians haye overturned what their predecessors left vntouched in a word they may be briefly described thus
they have a creed from the apostles which they do not beleeve they have a prayer from christ which they do not say they have commandments from god which they professe they will not keep and the two sacraments of the law of grace which they had only left to themselves they have made altogether gracelesse almost vselesse
and besids all this they have robbed the holy trinity of glory and the church of the apostolique governement together with all order decency to speak nothing of their other smaller pranks
therefore am now confident that you have found what promised at the beginning to witt that the first pretended reformation was no better grounded then the last and that the end of both hath been total desolation and the destruction of the chief pillars af the christian religion whereas vpon the contrary you have seen the catholique religion which you had heard so often calumniated with strong and shamelesse cries to be in all these principal points conforme to the scriptures and holy fathers and to the primitive church
thus he

as was so clearly convinced in all these particulars that behoved to renounce both knowledge conscience if would deny them so did ingenuosly confesse to him my

satisfaction and withall promised if could find the like evidence for the catholiques in all the other controuersies that would by gods grace render my self a roman catholique
to which he answered that the triall of all the particular doctrines in controversie after the former manner was a long laborious needlesse way and that god had more easie and shorter meanes to come vnto the knowledge of the truth or else what would become of those who are not capable to make such trials therefore he would vndertake to prove shortly by a clear vndeniable principle and granted by all protestants the protestant religion their whole church to be false and by the same principle to shew clearly the present catholique church in communion with the sea of rome to be the ancient catholique church established by christ his apostles and to have continued still in their doctrin without any variation
and so with some confidence arising from my former experience prepared my self to receive this new instruction
chap
xxiii
that the true church of christ must be perpetuall and must endure without interruption vnto the end of the world

the principle said my catholique friend whereby will demonstrate the protestant church not to be the true church of christ shall be so evident and convincent that as nothing is more expresly in scriptures so nothing is more freely granted by luther calvin generally by all learned protestants
and this principle is the perpetuity of christs church or that christ must have a church which hath endured from his ascension vntill this time shall endure from this vntill the end of the world
before proceed further will first manifest vnto you the strength of this truth by the scriptures fathers by protestants and their reasons
the passages of scripture for this truth are many but shall content my selfe with some few which may serve for your satisfaction
the first do concern the eternal kingdome of christ by which all men vnderstand his church
of this the prophet daniel saith
in the dayes of these kings the god of heaven shall set vp a kingdome which shall never be destroyed
it shall break in pieces all these kingdomes and it shall stand for ever
the

angel gabriel speaking of the same kingdom of christ to the blessed virgin said and of his kingdome there shall be no end

calvin proveth by these places and others which speak of the kingdome of christ the perpetuity of of his church against servetus
so doth also beza and the confession of holland
if then the kingdome of christ be perpetual there must alwaies be some to acknowledge him to be their king
the second passages of scripture contayne christs promises to his church

and the governours of it
vpon this rock saith he will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevaile against it
by this place augustin proveth both the perpetuity

and inuincibility of the church
the catholique church saith he fighting against all heresies may be opposed but cannot be overcome all heresies have gone out of her as vnprofitable twigges cut off from the vine but she remaines in her roote in her vine in her charitie the gates of hell cannot pervaile against her
christ promised also his perpetu assistance vnto the pastors of his church behold said he am with you alway even vnto the consummation of the world
which place both augustin and hierome do bring to prove the same truth
the first introduceth the church speaking thus to christ
shew vnto me the fewnesse of my dayes how long shall be in this world
shew this vnto me for those who say she was but now is not the church hath made apostasy and perished from all nations
and he declared vnto me
behold am

with you alway even vnto consummation of the world
hierome saith that christ

by these words shews there should be alwayes some faithfull people in this world that he should never separate himself from them
passe by many more places of scripture which is so evident for the perpetuity of christs church that augustin said against the donatists who denyed it

and affirmed the church had perished they mock christ in a matter which is evident in a matter where no man can say did not understand

this truth is not only evident in scriptures and fathers but it is also acknowledged by all protestants whose minds are best knowne by their confessions of faith which ought to be of more authority amongst them then the testimonies of their private writers

the confessions of ausburg of saxonie of the suizers do not only affirm that the church must still continue vnto the end of the world but they prove it by the expresse scriptures above cited
the authors of our first scottish confession professe that they beleeve as firmely the perpetuity of the church as they beleeve the mysterie of the trinity

for thus they speak
as we beleeve in god the father son and holy ghost so we do most earnestly beleeve that from the beginning there hath been now is and to the end of the world shall be a church
the new confession at westminster professeth the same truth
and so do also luther calvin as we shall see presently

now the contrarie doctrin to witt that the church of christ did perish or can perish is censured both by catholiques protestants as a most damnable errour iniurious to god against the clear scriptures
aug testimonie shall suffice for the first
for against the donatists who defended the like error and said but that church which was of all nations is no more she hath perished he subioyneth this censure this they say who are not in her
impudent speech and after ward this voice so damnable so detestable so full of presumption falshood which is sustained with no truth enlightned with no wisdome seasoned with no salt vaine rash heady pernitious
the holy ghost foresaw
by the great severity of this censure may be knowne the abominable falshood of that opinion
neither is the iudgment of caluin against that error lesse severe
for writing against servetus who defended it and who was burnt by his order at geneva he saith did not touch that long banishment of the church from the earth which he faineth wherein he plainly accuseth god of a lie
and afterward he maketh this profession
but we indeed confesse that the church was put in glorious places otherwise god would have lied who promised that he should alwayes have some people so long as the sun and moone shall shine in the firmament
we know what the prophets do every where teftifie of the eternall kingdome of christ

the reason of these great censures is very evident
for
there is nothing so often and so

clearly promised in the scriptures as the perpetuitie of the church of christ
if then notwithstanding these clear promises the church might perish then all the other mysteries reveal'd in scripture might be denyed then it would follow that god were a liar as calvin reasoneth against servetus

if the church could perish then that article of the apostles creed believe the holy catholique church would be false and therefore none could believe truely that to be which had no being
this reason is brought by luther

it would follow that men could not be saved

for out of the true church there is no ordinarie possibility of salvation as our new confession of faith acknowledgeth
now what could be more against the goodnesse mercy of god what more iniurious to the merits of christs passion then to take away the means of salvation which would be clearly taken away if the church did perish by all which may be seen that the perpetuity of christs church is not only clearly contayn'd in the scriptures holy fathers but also that it's granted by protestants proved by their reasons and that the contrarie opinion to witt that the church can perish is censured both by catholiques protestants as a most pernicious damnable error
thus spake the catholique

was so satisfied of the truth of this principle that desired no more for the evidence of it and professed if by it the protestant

church were proved not to be the true church that it could not be denyed but protestants were convinced not only by a clear truth but also by their own principles

but to perform this the better the same catholique shew me that it was necessarie to lay down an other principle to witt the definition or description of a protestant church
and although said he this be difficult by reason that protestants are very inconstant and changeable in their doctrin which is the essence of a church so that the definition which will serve them this yeare may perhaps not fit them the next for which cause some have affirmed that it's as hard to find out a definition which will alwayes agree to them as to paint proteus or make a fit coate for the moone yet notwithstanding these difficulties a general notion may be had of them and the best appear's to be that which is taken from their confessions of faith
so that the protestant church of scotland may be described to be a society of people beleeving the whole articles of the scottish confession
and other protesta~t churches as of engla~d france may be described after the same manner by their several confessions
for these confessions distinguish them from all other societies and they require no more of any to be esteem'd a protestant of their respective churches then to subscrive and swear their confessions
but it is to be observed that these confessions must be beleeved wholly and intirely

and not only a part of them otherwise all heretiques might be esteem'd protestants
for arius sabellius and the rest beleeved some of these articles and yet were not protestants
these two grounds being setled he proceeded to his proof
chap
xxiv
that the protestant church hath not been perpetual yea was not at all before luther and therefore is not the true church

from the former two principles which granted and conceive no protestant can deny this argument was made vnto me
the true church of christ hath still continued without interruption since the ascension of christ
but the protestant church hath only continued since the apostasy of luther
therefore the protestant church is not the true church of christ
the maior is evident by the first principle of the perpetuity of the church the minor is proved by the second principle after this manner
the protestant church for example of scotland is a church beleeving all the articles of the scottish confession and the same may be proportionally said of all other protestant churches and their confessions
but before luther there was no church which beleeved that confession or any other of the

protestant confessions
therefore there was no protestant church before luther and consequently it hath only continued since the fall of luther
the maior is evident by the second principle
the minor to witt that there was no church before luther which beleeved any protestant confession is proved thus
if had been any church before luther beleeving any protestant confession it was either visible or invisible there is no medium
but there was no church either visible or invisible which beleeved any protestant confession
therefore there was no church at all beleeving any protestant confession before luther
if you will affirm said he that there was such a church visible ask where it was to be seen before luther appeared which can never be showen if you say there was a church beleeving some protestant confession but invisible demand only for the present how the true church can be invisible how can the true church be without doctrin sacraments neither of which can be had in an invisible church but shall prove he after that the scriptures fathers right reason are as evident for the visibility as they are for the perpetuity of the church
yea shall shew that albeit the true church could be invisible the protestant church was not so much as invisible before luther and therefore was not at all
visibility invisibility are indeed the two

starting holes by which your authors think to escape when they are prest by this argument and therefore they must be both diligently watcht
for there is a custom as augustin observes common to foxes heretiques

as foxes have two entries to their hole to the end they may save themselves by the one when they are pursued by the other so heretiques whom the scripture ressembles to foxes have a double issue in their answers that they may escape by the one when they find themselves assaulted pres't by the other
this custome many protestants observe well in this same matter
for when they are pres't to shew their church before luther they say often it was invisible therefore could neither be known nor shown
but when it is proved by the scriptures right reason that the true church must be visible then they make many shifts to shew it was visible and when all these faile they run back again vnto their hole of invisibility and so think to escape that way
thus he

but esteeming visibility a more honorable natural propertie of the church of christ then invisibility since christ saith tell the church which were impossible to be done if the church were not visible knowing that diverse famous protestants do affirm that their church was visible before luther willed him if he would gain his point to shew me first that the protestant church was not visible before luther
wherevpon he toul dme that he would prove that very particularly but

first he would shew me in general that even these protestants who pretend their church to have been visible cannot endure to be ask'd that fatal question where was your church before luther for knowing the hardnesse of this question and the insufficiency of their answers they endeavour to shift it calling it an vniust impertinent demand an old but vnnecessarie question a question of historie which would require twentie yeares study
but said he if this demand be vniust

then the fathers were vniust who made the same demand to the heretiques of their time required them to shew the origine of their churches and to tell what they were and whence they came
yea if this demand be vniust some chief protestants are vniust who made the same to diverse sectaries who have gone out from them
for the theologs of heydelberg speak thus to the anabaptists if you be the church of god it followeth that god hath been without people and without a church
and the reason which they subioyn is very remarkable for it is directly according to the second principle above setled
for if you say they would read over all histories you shall find no people
from the beginning of the world that hath made a confession of faith like yours beza hath also been vniust who presseth the new arians with the like question if their doctrin saith he be true we require them to show vs at length in what place their church hath been
these testimonies to passe by many others do shew that this question is neither

vniust nor impertinent and that these protestants who vrge it so hardly against others do know the great strength and evidence of it which they cunningly dissemble or maliciously deny when it's vrged against themselves

but that this question is not vniust may be shewed also by reason
for if the protestant church hath been visible it must have been in some place visible
since then we cannot see nor heare of it before luther arose although all histories have been searched all records pervsed which do inform vs of things lesse considerable as sometimes of one single man when and where he arose and opposed the church and yet not so much as one word can be found of a whole visible continual society of protestants and besids that they cannot be found in histories they have left no monuments behind them by which they may be known to have been in the world before luther although they have left many ruinous monuments behind them since luther seing say after all this diligence we cannot find out this visible protestant church and yet these protestants affirm that it was visible we most iustly require them to help tell vs where their church was in what kingdome province or citie and if they cannot do this we may iustly conclude that their allegation is a groundlesse imagination invented to deceive men against their sense vnderstanding in a matter of greatest importance
but wc do not as yet make any such conclusion we only require

them to shew what we cannot see by our selves to point vnto vs where their church was that we may fix our ey's towards that place and for satisfaction we are answered that the demand is vniust and we impertinent if we do not beleeve vpon their bare word that their church was visible albeit neither we can find nor they can tell where it was
but all prudent and indifferent men would think it much more iniustice impertinencie both in them to require and in vs to beleeve that their church was visible before it can be shewed where it was then in vs to require where it was before we beleeve that it was
who giveth credit quickly

saith the wise man
is light of heart
any heretiques albeit never so grosse may pretend the same vpon as good ground and yet no reasonable man can think it vnreasonable to demand where their church was before we beleeve them

moreover this is not only a iust and pertinent but also a most necessarie and important question
for thereby all false churches are clearly sensibly discovered even to the meanest capacities
because if the church of christ must be perpetual as hath been evidently demonstrated and if it must be also perpetually visible as these protestants of whom we now speak do grant then it followeth when ever a new church or congregation ariseth with a new confession of faith which was not see nor known before that that church is not the true church of christ which ought to

be alwayes both perpetual visibie
for this cause the holy fathers did vrge this question so hardly by which they confounded all heretical new vpstart churches

and whereas some protestants do alleadge

that this question is a curiosity of history an old question which would require tventie yeares studie it is such a curiosiry of that it can be found in none or else the laborious centurists had not omitted it
it is indeed an old question but was never well answered and will yet require a new answere as shall appear by the insufficiency of all the old answers
and if it require twentie yeares study they cannot complain who have got now a hundred yeares to find out an answer to it

but to speak no more of these shifts shall shew how diverse protestants being vrged by that fata question make many essaies to answer it and yet cannot make appear the visibility of their church before luther they run almost all the world over to find their church
they begin their iourney in france striveing to prove it in the waldenses albigenses

from france they go over to england to prove it in the wicleffists

from england they passe to boheme to find it among the hussists

from boheme they to greece and from that to aethiopia armenia pretending that nations were protestants

having thus wearied themselvs all in vain the most learned are glad to come

back again to the papists saying that their church before luther was in the very heart of popery

finding that their new coin'd distinction of fundamental points involves them in great labyrinths and that the papists will not acknowledge them for their associats they passe from the later vnto the purer times before gregory alleadging that the primitive church holy fathers were protestants

after they have made this monstruous leap of
yeares and there find both pastors people at the sacrifice of the masse which the protestants abhorre as idolatry they run to their last shift which is to get out of the sight of the world and hide themselves in the hole of invisibiliy
these many different answers shew that the protestant church hath no great certainty of its pedegree shall briefly shew you the insufficiency of every one of these answers by which it shall be proved that the protestant church was not visible before luther and hereby their first starting hole shall be either so stop't or lay'd that they cannot escape this way
chap
xxv
that the protestant church was not visible before luther neither in the waldenses albigenses vviclifists nor husits
that the protestant church may be continued in the waldenses and the same is to be observed of the albigenses and the rest two things are to be proved by protestants

that the waldenses have ever continued since the time of the apostles
and this is clear by the first vndeniable principle of the perpetuity of the church

that the waldenses were intirely of that faith which the protestants do now or did professe that is beleeved any of their confessions of faith
for without this whole agreement the waldenses could not be a protestant church as is evident by the second principle above setled
now it is impossible for them to shew either of these two

for first concerning the continuance of the waldenses all histories do affirm that they began in the twelfth age and that their author was one waldo a marchant of lions about the yeare
whom the centurists place in the
century
how can it be then proved

that the waldenses had continued since the apostles time seing their author who was before a catholique a laique lived neer
hundred yeares after the apostles supposeing then

that waldo became a protestant after he had been before a catholique the question remaines where was the protestant church before waldo the true church must be perpetuall

secondly as the waldenses did not continue since the apostles so neither did they agree intirly with protestants

in the principal articles of their religion to witt in iustification by faith only if we beleeve luthers testimonie
and if we will trust calvin they held also the reall presence in the popish sense of transubstantiation
therefore such men could not be protestants

thirdly they agreed with the catholiques in diverse other points as about the number nature of the sacraments the vow of chastity the necessity of childrens baptism
they began a kind of religious order for which they were called the poore men of lions and sought confirmation of it from pope innocent the third but could not obtayn it

lastly they maintaind diverse grosse errours which are condemned both by catholiques protestants

as
that churchmen by mortal sin lost all spiritual authority

that the civil magistrats by mortal sin fell also from their dignity

that churchmen should possesse nothing in propertie

that it was lawfull to dissemble in religion and their practice was conform to their doctrin for they went to masse confessed and communicated
for which dissimulation the protestants at the

beginnining would not acknowlege them for their brethren
these and other grosse errors they maintain'd as may be seen in the protestants apology where the authors are at large cited

but as these differences do shew the waldenses not to be good protestants so will bring some few to prove that they were ill presbyterians


they admitted no other forme of prayer except our lords prayer the presbyterians admitt many others but not that

they allowed only three orders in the church to witt of deacons priests bishops
the presbyterians have abiured episcopacy the whole hierarchie of the church
the waldenses affirmed that all oaths were vnlawfull
the presbyterians have tak and enforced others to take many vnlawfull oaths in the covenant

the waldenses maintain'd

that it was not lawfull to put any man to death hy the sentence of a iudge and therefore they abolished all iudicatories in the cause of blood
the covenanters have shed much blood vnder pretence of iustice spareing none of their opposers who came in their reverence


they consecrated ordinarly their sacrament vpon that day only whereon our saviour was betrayed and they kept it thus consecrated all the yeare long to be given to the sick
the presbyterians do not professe to consecrate at all they give their sacrament very seldom to the whole and they have made an act never to give it to the sick
can find hardly

any thing wherein the waldenses agreed more with the presbyterians then with other protestants

except in this alone that they contemned the apostles creed which the presbyterians have more then probably done by denying it to be apostolical
by all which it is evident that the waldenses did not continue since the time of the apostles and from the time they arose they were not protestants much lesse presbyterians and so are deficient in both the principles

therefore fox illyricus and other protestants have their recourse very groundlesly to the waldenses to prove the continuall visibility of their church by them
and for this cause we must leave them passe to the albigenses
albigenses

these men had their name from the towne of albingia in france where the greatest part of them remained
they began in the same age with the waldenses and was a branch of their sect

as osiander fulk do confesse
their late riseing sheweth that they had not continued since the time of the apostles and therefore could not be the true church as is evident by the first principle and consequently albeit they had been protestants the protestant church could not be shewed continually visible in them
they are also deficient in the second principle because they did not beleeve any protestant confession
for they held the same

doctrin with the waldenses

except some few things which they added of their own
as
they maintain'd with the manichees that there were two beginnings to witt god and the devil

with the saducees they denyed the resurrection of the body

with the manichees seleucians and other ancient heretiques they reiected baptism
and maintain'd many other errors which are condemned both by catholiques protestants and they committed some abominable and prophane villainies in the church of tolouse
hence it is that albeit some protestants do seek to perpetual their church by them yet others do clearly reiect them
iewell saith plainly non sunt nostri they are not ours
and osiander reiects them more clearly
their doctrin saith he was absurd impious heretical they remained obstinatly in their errors and impiety whence men think that they have been possessed with anabaptistical furie
and yet notwithstanding these grosse errors which they maintain'd and their great differences from protestants fox reckons the albigenses in the number of protestant martyrs and some other protestants

as spark fulk do very gtoundlesly pretend to shew the visibility of their church by them
but seing the protestant church cannot be continued neither in the waldenses nor albigenses in france we must passe next to the wiclefists in england
wiclefists
iohn wicleff an english man was a roman priest and a curate in england
he lived in the yeare
as fox testifieth and from him began the church of the wiclefists for there was none or that religion before himself
all the world saith fox was covered with thick darknesse when wicleff like the morning flarre did shine out in the midst of a cloude
therefore the church of the wiclefists which began so long after the apostles cannot be the perpetual church which we are seeking

the wiclefists were not protestants because they did not beleeve any protestant confession of faith yea they did not beleeve the principal point of the protestant faith to witt iustification by faith only
for melanchton saith of wiclef truly he neither vnderstood nor held the iustice of faith

he agreed with the catholiques in many other points against protestants as in the intercession of saints veneration of images the rites ceremonies of masse extreme vnction all the
sacraments

as breirly sheweth out of his own works
lastly he maintain'd diverse grosse errors condemned both by catholiques protestants as that all things fall out by an absolute and fatal necessity that god ought to obey the devil as the councel of constance doth testifie
vpon which words his disciples made many violent intricate

glosses which may be seen examined in stratfords disputation of the church

he held also that church men in mortal sin did not baptize nor conferre orders
that princes magistrats fell from their dignity power by mortal sin
that churchmen ought not to enioy any temporal things but should beg many other seditious errors he taught
all which shew that wiclefs church which raise so lately decayed so quickly is not the true church of christ founded by his apostles which must endure for ever and that neither he nor his associats for the short time they endured were protestants
therefore

the protestant church cannot be continued visible in them albeit fox humphrey and others falsly so pretend
hvssits

from england we must follow some protestants to bohemia where they vndertake to prove their church visible in the hussits
these men had their origine from husse who lived in the yeare
that is some few yeares after wiclef
he was first a catholique a priest before he became author of his sect
therefore the protestants cannot by this and his congregation although they were granted to be protestants continue the visibility of their church vnto the apostles

husse held not the protestant confession of faith for fox giveth this testimonie of him

what did the popish faith define of transubstantiation which he did not confirme who said masse more religiously then he who kep't more chastly the vowes of priestly single life yea he affirmes also that husse maintain'd also free will iustification by works merits veneration of images and other points of the roman faith which shew that husse was no good protestant

therefore luther saith that the papists burnt husse when he did not go so much as a finger breadth from popery
and last of all he maintaind almost all the same errors with wiclef which are condemned both by protestants catholiques
and yet it's a wonder how fox calleth him a most holy martyr his disciples defenders of the gospel
chap
xxvi
that the protestant church hath not continued visible in the grecians armenians nor aethiopians

albeit the grecians were granted now to be protestants yet they were not alwayes so and therefore protestants cannot continue the visibility of their church by them
for they were at least seven or hundred yeares in the communion of the roman church as witnesse the first eight general councels all held in grece and approved by the popes of rome
the first revolt was made

by the grecians denying the procession of the holy ghost from the son
they were vnited again diverse times to the church of rome and lastly in the councel of florence

this sheweth that the grecians have not alwayes remain'd in the same doctrin and therefore they are not the perpetual church which we are now seeking

since the tim that they began their schisme they were not protestants for they have reiected the protestants communion and disproved their co fession

as is well known by the censure which they have published against it where they maintayn masse transubstantiation
sacraments invocation of and diverse other points of the roman faith
lastly they hold an error condemned both by catholiques protestants to witt that the holy ghost proceeds only from the father not from the son
therefore the protestants cannot continue their visible church by the grecians who were for many ages catholiques who never were nor yet are protestants and are known to this day for a great part to be roman catholiques

the like may be said of the armenians
for first supposing they were now protestants they were not alwayes of that religion for they remaind catholiques

ever till about the
age
therefore the protestant church cannot be continued in them
they never held the protestant confession of faith
for they maintayn the real presence the vnbloody sacrifice

prayer for the dead invocation of saints
they were vnited to the roman church with the grecians

in he councel of florence
and lastly since their falling away they hold errors which are condemned both by catholiques protestants
for they deny the procession of the holy ghost from the son they confound the two natures in christ and reiterate baptisme all which do shew that they neither were nor are protestants

from greece and armenia we must now at length go to aethiopia where du moulin affirmes the protestant church was

before luther
but supposing they were now protestants they were not alwayes so
for near the space of
hundred yeares they were catholiques at which time they began to be corrupted with the heresie of eutiches
therefore the protestant church for
hundred yeares was not visible in them

since their schisme they never beleeved intirly any protestant confession and never held iustification by faith only


they agree with the catholiques against protestants in the
sacraments invocation of saints prayer for the dead masse transubstantiation as stratford sheweth out of their own authors
they call the pope head of all bishops as is evident by the letters of their emperour to pope clement the
whereof a part is recited in the upplement of

and they have offered diverse times obedience to the pope
lastly they held diverse errors which protestants cannot

approve
for they deny the procession of the holy ghost from the son

with the grecians they acknowledge one only will in christ with the mono helities and one only nature in him with the eutichians and with the iewes they abstaine from certain meats and observe circumcision
therefore the protestants cannot continue their church by the aethiopians nor by any of their pretences which serve for nothing but to make it visibly appeare that there was no visible protestant church in any part of the world for no age or time before luther how much lesse for the whole time between the apostles and luther yea albeit the and all the rest above named to whom the protestants do pretend were granted to have beleeved the protestant confession as it's evident they beleeved it not yet the protestant church could not be continued by any or all of them because they did not continue from the apostles and the most part of them lived at diverse times without any society or lineal descent hanging often assunder whole ages one from an other and the first being long decayed before the others did appeare
for this cause some learned protestants seeing the impossibility of continuing the visibility of their church by such broken and vanishing troopes and being ashamed to claime as members of their church such erronious persons or notorious heretiques have vndertaken by two other wayes to

shew their church to be visible before luther which we shall shortly run over
chap
xxvii
that the protestant church was not visible in the primitive church or the holy fathers nor thereafter in the roman church

it was very ordinary for the old protestants of the late english church to alleadge that the ancient fathers were of their religion and that their church was conforme to the primitive church
in which matter iewels appeale to the fathers of the first
hundred yeares is very famous
but that pretence is idle in regard of our present question

it is false
first it's idle because were it true as we shall see it to be most false that these fathers of the first
or
hundred years were protestants yet could not that suffice to prove them a continued succession of
years
for enquire what became of the protestant church after the fathers to the time of luther did it perish or not if it perished then it is not the true church which must be perpetual according to the first vndeniable principle above setled
if the protestant church did not perish but remain'd visible for
years between the fathers luther

then the question remaines where was it in what kingdome province or citie never be shewed
yea some famous protestants do acknowledge

that all that time the protestant church was not to be seen
therefore although the fathers were granted to have been protestants the protestant church cannot be continued by them after their time

secondly its most false that the fathers were protestants

because the christians of the sixth age must needs know better what was the religion and tenets of them who lived in the fifth age by whom they were instructed and with whom they conversed th protestants can do now
but these christians have protested on their salvation that it was the very same with theirs receiv'd from them by word of mouth
therefore if the christians of the sixth age were not protestants neither were the fathers and christians of the
age protestants and so you may go vpward even to the apostles
this reason shall be more cleared hereafter

it may be known that the fathers were not protestants by the points already examined
for they did not beleeve iustification by faith only the impossibility of keeping the commandments they did not deny the necessity effect of baptism they did not deny the real presence which are principal articles of the protestant religion but taught the quite contrary as hath been seen
therefore according to the second principle above setled they were not protestants


not to descend to particular doctrines this same truth may be shewed by the little account protestants make of the fathers whom they would highly esteem if they made for them and in a word by the open confession of the chief protestants that the fathers were against them in many things
luther as if he were a little after cups speaks very intemperatly of the fathers
in the writing saith he of hierome there is not a word of true faith or sound religion of chrysostome make do accompt basil is of no worth he is wholly a monk weigh him not a haire cyprian is a weak divine

and generally he affirmeth that the authority of the fathers is not to be regarded
if the fathers had been luther had not so vnderva ved them nor disclaim'd their authority
calvin also ingenuously confesseth that the fathers are against him in many points
it was a custom saith he about years ago to pray for the dead but all of that time confesse were caried away into error he also that the fathers taught satisfaction free will merit fasting in lent
all which whitaker confirmes
it's true saith he what calvin the centurists have written that the ancient church did erre in many things as touching limbe free will merit of works
and again he saith the popish religion is patched vp of the fathers errors
peter martyr accords to him
so long saith he as we stand to the councels and fathers we shall remaine alwayes in the same errors
an other famous protestant

said more clearly if that be true which the fathers have professed by mutual consent it is altogether on the papists side
this open confession of the protestants chief reformers and best schollers sheweth evidently that the holy fathers were not protestants
and therefore the presbyterians who disclaime the holy fathers yeeld them to the papists are much more sincere ingenuous in this matter then the late english protestants who laid claime to the fathers deceitfully made the people beleeve that they were protestants which they were enforced to deny when they were dealing with schollers as may appeare by the former testimonies
by all which it is more then evident that the holy fathers and primitive church were not protestants and therefore the protestant church cannot be shewed to be visible in the much lesse can the visibility of it be continued after them
wherefore we must go and seek out this visible protestant church els where for here it cannot be seen

the last valiant attempt was made by some famous protestants who after they had seen that all their neighbours and predecessors had wearied themselves in vaine by travailing all the world over to find out a visible protestant church before luther which could not be found had in end their recourse vnto the popish church as vnto a city of refuge in this great straight
they taught two things

that the roman protestant churches are

all one church as agreing in all fundamental points of faith although they in not fundamentals and by this distinction they think to answer easily that hard question where was your church before luther to witt they say it was the ve same with the roman which they acknowledge to be a true church keeping all the fundamental points of religion which are necessary to salvation albeit she had some errors not fundame~tal which do not destroy the nature of the church but only make it si and weak
and so by this means they think to avoid all the inconveniences into which other protestants do fall
for hereby it is shewed that the church did not perish nor was invisible nor was only visible for a time but was perpetually visible

they deny that the protestant church made any real substantial separa ion from the roman and affirm that all which they did was only to free themselves of some errors which as sicknesses though not in themselves mortal had crep't in vpon the roman which being often advertised of her maladies and desired to cure them would admit no medicine which the protestants taking at length in a cup of reformation did purge themselves of all infirmities and thereby their church was rendred whole and sound
so that there is no more difference between the roman protestant church then between the same man whole sick who by health and sicknesse is not substantially different but remaines still

the same man
the protestants who followed this course were famous in their own generations and much cryed vp for learning prudence as hooker the bishop of spalato feild bunny potter chilingworth and diverse others as may be seen in the of calcedons treatise of fundamental points and in the protestants apologie
shall content my self with the testimony of bunny who writes thus no question ought to be made for our separation from the church
for we make not a distinct church from them nor they from vs
there was therefore no separation made fro the church neither did any of vs go out from them
the only question may be which of vs are to be esteemed the more wholsome members of the church we or they neither is there any other question approved by vs yea he acknowledgeth that vnlesse this answer be made the papists have great advantage in their old question seing the protestants cannot shew a church distinct from the roman before luther

but this answer of these late authors is as false and insufficient as any of the former
first it directly contradicts the ctrine practice of their reformers who are supposed to have been heavenly apostles
for they accused the roman church of idolatrie superstition and diverse grosse fundamental errors which make not a church to be only sick but also kill and destroy it and as the presbyterians speak make it of the church of christ become the synagogue of sathan
then for separation first reformers were so far

from denying it that they invited all persons to separate themselves from the roman church which they called babylon and according to this doctrin their practice followed
therefore it is evident that the first reformers did not think the roman and protestant church all one in fundamentals neither did they deny separation from the roman church but rather the quite contrarie is most clear and certaine

secondly diverse other famous protestants condemne this new opinion as im ious
for perkins writes thus
the politician who is of no religion saith hat we and the papists differ not in substance
and whiteker saith plainly that the roman church hath taken away many fundamental articles of faith and corrupted faith in the principal parts
all the late protestants and especially the presbyterians condemne the same opinion
for nothing almost can incense them re then to say that the church of rome is a true church and that the protestants made no separation from her
hence it came to passe that hooker was sharply reproved for this device by the puritans in their christian letters

thirdly besids all these confusions contradictions among themselves the answer in it self is false insufficient
for when we are seeking a protestant visible church before luther these men shew vs the popish church and albeit all the world knowes that papists are not protestants yet they affirm that

the popish and protestant church are all one differ not substantially which is a double deceit first shew one thing very different for another and then to affirm that they are both one
but conceive it can hardly enter into a mans imagination vnlesse it be troubled to think that these churches are substantially one which differ and are clearly opposite in the principal substantial points of religion as in sacrifice sacraments the observation of the divine commandments iustifying faith good works and many others particulars
the one church approveth external sacrifice as a most acceptable service and worship due to god and offers vp the christian sacrifice as the most excellent of all sacrifices and adores it as god
the other hath no sacrifice at all but condemnes that as great abomination grosse idolatrie which the first makes the greatest obiect and exercise of its piety
this difference alone albeit we speak of no more is so great that dallie a renown'd min ster in france doth affirm in his apologie which he wrote lately for the reformed churches and is approved by his colleagues the ministers of charenton that it was sufficient to iustifie the protestants separation from the roman church and to hinder their vnion again with it as being a most substantial and fundamental difference
by which it's evident that the ground whereon this answer is founded to witt that there are no fundamental differences between the catholique

protestant church is false both in it felt in the iudgment of the first reformers of many other famous protestants
but whither there be fundamental differences or not the answer is not sufficient for the still remaines where was the protestant church before luther that is a church believing all the articles of a protestant confession whither some of them called fundamental or not fundamental or if they please of men holding all these articles and esteeming some of them fundamental and some not
for we are now seeking a protestant church before luther and according to the definition above setled such a church is a society beleeving all the articles of their co~fessio
therefore they must shew vs such a confessio or else they do not shew vs a protestant church
yea the points which they call not fundame~tal wherein they disagree fro the papists are these which make them properly protestants
if then they confesse as they must do that no society can be had before luther which believed all these points which they call not fundamental they must also grant that there was no visible protestant church before luther which is directly to succumb faile in that which they vndertook to shew
so that albeit this distinction of fundamentals were admitted as good true whereas indeed in their sense it's false and deceitfull as we shall see more clearly hereafter yet in relation to the present question it would serve them to no purpose

these reasons are more then sufficient to shew that this new answer is false and insufficient and is nothing but a meer shift devised to elude the question and that it cannot be satisfactorie to any man who is searching for the truth which is condemned by famous protestants as and impious and which is contrarie to the doctrin practice of the first reformers
this sheweth clearly the great straight necessity wherevnto such learned and prudent men were reduced in answering this hard question which required an accompt of the protestant church before luther
for they could not say the church had perished which had been a blasphemous falshood against the most clear scriptures they saw also that all the other pretences to the waldenses and the rest were false and frivolous seing none of these agreed intirely with protestants neither had any of them perpetual continuance and being ashamed of the puritans invisible church which we shall see to be a meer chimera they had no other refuge but to flie vnto the roman church which they were therefore enforced to acknowledge to be the true church which had alwayes remain'd albeit their first reformers had abandonned it as a false church accusing it of superstition idolatrie as the most part of all visible protestants yet continue to do
but this refuge hath been shewed to serve them to no purpose
these men do in a part resemble the prodigal child who never thought of returning to his fathers

house till he had spent all means and till great misery necessity compelled him so these learned protestants after they had fare travailed wearied themselv's much and spent all their braines in seeking out their church before luther and not finding it any where at length by meer necessity had their last refuge vnto their fathers house the catholique church which they had before left
but there was this deplorable difference between the prodigal child and them that he being truly penitent and confessing his fault with great humility was by his father most lovingly met embraced kissed cloathed and feasted whereas they returning not with humility repentance for their separation but with idle excuses and vaine accusations without any other intention save only to get their nakednesse covered and their other vrgent necessities supplyed were neither met nor received clothed nor feasted but have perished for famine and cold and are now almost all with the decay of their late ill founded church exstirpared out of the world
they called the roman a sick church and their own a whole church yet it is verifyed that their whole church is dead and hath decayed before the sick church
and as their church according to them was only visible in the roman church before luther so it's now invisible in it self and only visible as it was in the beginning and like to continue so vnto the end

by all which considerations it is evident

that no visible protestant church can be found before luther and much lesse a continuall succession of it from the time of the apostles
we have travailed almost all the world over seeking this church and we have followed diverse protestant guides who vndertook to shew it vnto vs but ever in the end they faile of their promises
therefore we must passe now from the protestant visible church which cannot be seen before luther to their invisible church which we shall see cannot be found before him
chap
xxviii
that the church of christ ought to be alway's visible and therefore an invisible church cannot be the true church

having gone hitherto along with diverse protestants who promised to shew vs their church visible before luther we must now leave them as falling short of their promises and quit all further search of this church in the light and follow these other protestant guides who vndertake to find out their church to vs in the dark
for vnto that old demand where was your church before luther they answer that it was although invisible
and in this answer of invisibility the most part of all visible protestants and especially presbyterians do now acquiesce thinking this last refuge such a strong and retir'd

hold for them and so well guarded by the scriptures in that answer which god gave to the complaint of elias that they cannot be smoaked out of it
but notwith these pretences the same catholique shew me that the church of christ ought to be alway's visible that the invisible protestant church is a meer chimerical invention against the scriptures fathers famous protestants against the ends for which the church was instituted against protestants own principles and that many grosse absurdities follow vpon it to the disparagment of the christian religion and advancement of atheism

the scripture which affirmeth so clearly as we have seen above that the church must be perpetual affirmes no lesse evidently that it must be manifest and visible
for this cause the prophet esay compareth the church to a mountain
the mountain of the lords house saith he shall be established in the top of mountains and shall be exalted above the hil es and all nations shall flow vnto it
again the same prophet speaking of the church saith vpon thy walls ierusalem have appointed all the day and all the night they shall not hold their peace for ever
conforme to this first prophecie our saviour compares his church vnto a city seated on a hill which he saith cannot be hid

and vnto a light shining in the world
conforme to the second prophecie
paul sheweth that christ hath established pastors to remain continually in the church

for the consummation of the saints
now

what is more manifest then a mountain a city built vpon a hill what more visible then light shining and pastors continually teaching therefore according to the scriptures the church of christ which must be perpetual must be also visible and cannot be hid or invisible

for the fathers we shall bring augustin who produceth the same places which he calls clear and evident to prove the same truth against the donatists
there is nothing

saith he more manifest then a mountain but yet there are some mountains vnknown because they are placed in one part of the earth the mountain of the church not so it must be known because it hath filled the whole face of the earth
and elswhere bringing our saviours words

he saith the church is not hid because it is not vnder a bushel but vpon a candlestick that it may shine to all who are in the house
a city seated on a hil cannot be hid
but it is as it were hid vnto the donatists because they hear such clear and manifest testimonies which shew her to be in the whole earth and they choose rather with shut ey's to dash against that mountain then to go vp to it
and further he saith
the church hath this most certain mark that she cannot be hid
to the same purpose chrysostom affirmeth that it is easier for the sun to be extinguished then that the church shall be obscured
so that it is all one both in it self and with the holy fathers to say the church had perished and that it is hid or invisible
and

therefore if the one be so abominable the other is no lesse detestable
augustin who censured so heavily the opinion of the donatists who taught that the church had perished every where except only among themselves as if he had foreseen this presbyterian shift which pretends the church had not perrished but was invisible writes thus against it
some one may say it may be god hath other sheep but know not where of which he taketh care but know them not
how absurd is he vnto humane sense who imagines such things
we have seen how this opinion is against the scriptures fathers and now in augustins iudgment it's against sense we shall see presently how it is against reason and famous protestants

all men ordinarly agree in this general notion of the church that it is a society of people instructed in the faith of christ governed by lawfull pastors and having communion together in the christian sacraments
but if the church were invisible there could be no instruction no governement no administration of sacraments
and hence will appear that an invisible church is against all the ends for which god had established a church vpon earth
the first was to instruct and guide the members of the church vnto the port of salvation
and for this end are necessary instruction in the faith administration of sacraments which require visibility both in the and in the people
for invisible pastors cannot instruct nor administrate sacraments

and therefore the church which consists of pastors people must be visible
for as humphrey saith whilst the ministers teach others learn they administrate the sacraments these receive them who seeth not these things is more blind then a but if the church were invisible there could be no instruction consequently no faith no sacraments so none could be directed in this invisible church vnto the port of salvation
this sheweth that the church must be visible at least to the members of it
the second for which the church was ordain'd was to receive the gentils and to afford to all persons who are astray the means of salvation by entering into the church
this the prophet esay speaking of the church foretold
thy gates shall be open continually day and night they shall not be shut that the strength of the gentils may be brought vnto thee
but if the church had been invisible her gates had been worse then shut for they could never have been found to be knokt at and so the gentils heretiques albeit never so desirous could never have entered which is against the scriptures and goodnesse of god
this reason proveth that the church must be visible even to strangers
the third end was to compose which might arise among christians according to that of our saviour tell the church
but had the church been invisible she could neither have been told nor found
invisible iudges cannot compose differences

the fourth end was to oppose all errors heresies

for which cause god established pastors in the church to conserve the people in the true doctrine fro the circu~vention of error
but had the church been invisible she could not have opposed heresies they had prevailed without co~troul
it there had been no church to oppose heresies before the protestants peep't vp what had become of the christian religion surely it had been a puddle of errors or a masse of confusion
so that this invisible church is against all the cheef ends for which god established a church vpon earth

it is also against famous protestants who sharply censure it
melanchton whom luther equaleth to the fathers

calls it monstruous
it is necessary saith he to confesse the church to be visible
wherevnto tendeth this monstruous speech which denyeth the visible church it abolisheth all testimonies of antiquity it causeth an endlesse confusion and induceth a commonwealth of vnruly ruffians or atheists where no one careth for another

humphrey saith it is a manifest conclusion that the church ought to be conspicuous
another protestant saith of the puritans they affirm against the scripture that the church for some ages was not visible
this cannot be a sound article of the protestant religion which such protestants so sharply censure

now we shall see how it is against protestants principles yea and destroyes it self
for they ordinarly assign two necessary marks of

the church to witt the right preaching of the word administration of the sacraments
to which the presbyterians add their disciplin as a third mark
inquire then if this church which some of them make invisible for
some for
and others for
hundred years had preaching and sacraments during that time or not if it had then it could not be invisible for invisible people can neither be instructed nor baptized
if it had no preaching nor sacraments then it hath been a miserable church or rather no church at all which wanted these two things which are necessary to constitute a church
if a famous presbyterian minister took occasion lately whilst he was baptizing a child on a cold winter day to say against the anabaptists it is cold dipping to day love not sommer sacraments may not any one say more iustly against the presbyterians in many dayes an invisible church cannot be found out
love not a church wherein for a thowsand years above there were neither sommer nor winter sacraments
moreover either this invisible church had some government or it had none if it had any it could not be invisible as is evident and if that governement was disciplin that church had not been only visible to these who obey'd it but also very sensible to those who did not willingjy stoop to it or else it hath been very far different from the nature of our scottish presbytery
if that invisible church had no government then it wanted

that which no society can want and without which there is no order but confusion
yea this invisible church is such a rare device that it destroies it self
for no church albeit never so invisible can be imagined without internal faith at least
now faith coms by hearing

according to paul and how shall they heare saith the same apostle without a preacher but in an invisible church there could be no preaching or instruction and so no faith and no faith no church
not so much as an invisible one
in a word this invisible church which wanted preaching faith sacraments and government hath been a miserable or rather a chimerical church

lastly this invisible church doth highly disparage the christian religion
for it makes the church of christ of whose glory above the synagogue of the iewes so much is recorded in the scriptures not equal in glory but more inglorious then the iewish synagogue hath been even since the coming of christ
for ever since that time the iewes have professed their religion and had visible synagogues in diverse famous nations whereas the presbyterians make the church of christ to be invisible for many ages of that time in which not one could be found who had the courage or devotion to professe the true religion
now what can be more against the sriptures and the honour of christ then this wicked device what more opprobrious to all the christians of these times god speaking

of the church

saith by the prophet aggai
the glory of this later house shall be greater then of the former
but if the christian church had been so many ages invisible it had been more inglorious then the synagogue of the iewes which was all that time visible
christ is called by paul

the mediator of a better covenant which was established vpon better promises
but by the presbyterians invisible church he is made mediator of a worse covenant and to have failed of his promises
hierom saith nimium prophani sunt
they are too prophane who affirm the iewes had more synagogues then the christians had churches therefore they may be called most prophane who affirme the iewes had many synagogues and deny the christians to have had so much as one church throughout the whole world
whence this opinion gives great advantage to the iewes and infidels against the christian religion
for they may iustly pretend that the christian church if it was so many ages invisible could not be the true church kingdom of the messias which the prophets foretould clearly should be eternal conspicuous and glorious and that christ could not be the true messias who had failed so palpably of his promises
yea this opinion is very dangerous to protestants so that it hath made some to stumble at the christian religion and it hath drawn others into flat atheism
sebastian castalio professor of basil having cited some clear testimonies of

scripture for the perpetuity of the church and the conversion of kings nations writes very perplexedly vnto edward the
king of england
truly saith he we must confesse that either these things will be or that they have been or god is to be accused of lie
if any man say they have been inquire of him when inquire how the knowledge of god and pietie which was promised to be eternal and more aboundant then the waters of the sea was not altogether perf ct and could so soon decay by which words he shewes what stuck in his stomack
david george a protestant of holand proceeded further vpon this ground of the visible decay of the church blasphem'd against christ saying if the doctrin of christ his apostles had been true the church which they planted had endured

and here vpon he became an impure apostat from the christian religion
adam neuserus the chief pastor of heydelberg of a minister became a turk and was circumcised at constantinople

these and some other examples may be seen in the protestants apology
by all which may be seen how false dangerous pernicious this opinion of the invisible church is against a most clear truth to witt that the church cannot be hid
therefore as augustin did conclude against the donatists

in these words
the church hath this most certain mark that she cannot be hid she is then known to all nations the sect of donatus is vnknown to all nations that then cannot be she
so we may conclude more forcibly

against the presbyterians
the church of christ hath this most certain mark that she cannot be hid or invisible
she is then known or visible to all nations
the protestant church before luther was invisible and vnknown to all nations as the presbyterians do confesse therefore the protestant church cannot be she
chap
xxix
that albeit the true church might be invisible yet the protestants had no invisible church before luther

it hath been already proved that albeit the protestants had had an invisible church before luther yet it could not be the true church which must be alway's visible
now remaines to be shewed the second thing which was vndertaken above to witt that albeit an invisible church were sufficient yet the protestants had not so much as one of that nature before luther and so they succumb as well de facto as they have done de iure and consequently this device of an invisible church for two reasons will serve them to no purpose which is shewed thus
an protestant church is a church which beleeved the protestant faith in their heart albeit they made no external profession of it
but de facto there was no church before luther which beleeved the protestant confession of faith
therefore

there was no visible protestant church before luth
the maior is evident because there is this difference between a visible and an invisible church that the first professeth the faith the other professeth it not but they both agree in this to have inwardly the faith without which there cannot be any church
therefore an invisible protestant church is a church which beleeved inwardly the protestant faith
the minor is proved of the time immediatly preceeding luthers preaching
for either luther himself before he began to oppose the pope was a member of this lurking protestan church beleeving the confession or these who adhered to him were members of it or some others who did nor ioyne with him and besids these no others can be found or imagined
but none of these can be said
for luther is avowedly confessed by himself and all men

to have been a roman catholique a priest a friar of augustins order and as himself acknowledgeth said masse devoutly and honored the pope in his heart
therefore luther before he opposed the pope did not beleeve inwardly the protestant faith and was not a member of the lurking invisible church but was a member of the roman visible church
but so were melanchton carolstadius the saxons and all the rest who followed him papists or priests professing the roman religion knowing nothing of the protestant till luther taught them
therefore all these who adhered

to luthers new doctrin were before that time not lurking protestants but profes't papists
neither were there any other members of that suppos'd lurking protestant church who did not ioyn with luther
for if there had been any they should and would have come out of their lurking holes so soon as luther began to preach and got the protection of secular
for then there was no more feare of persecution which was the only reason why these men did not professe their religion
and therefore that being taken away if there had been any such invisible protestants they would have showen themselvs visible acknowledged their brethren run and ioyn'd hands with them and said behold this is the faith which we alway's beleeved although we did not or durst not professe it
but no such persons did appeare when they might safely and ought in all duty to have appeared
therefore there was no lurking protestant church before luther and consequently the protestants had no church at all before him neither visible nor invisible

this may be yet further illustrated confirmed
for there may be conceived two kinds of invisible protestant churches
the first is a church which believed in their hearts the protestant faith and yet made profession of the contrary religion to witt of popery
the second is a company of people beleeving also internally the same faith but making no profession

of a contrary religion
and between these two extreames there is no medium
but the protestants had neither of these two invisible churches before luther
therefore they had none at all
not the first which although they had could not have been the true church of christ or a society of faithfull christians but rather was a miserable crue of dissembled sycophants for so they behoved to be who beleeved one thing professed the contrary which they thought grosse superstition idolatry not the first say
for such a dissembled church behoved to beleeve the protestants faith in their heart and professe the contrary against their consciences
but there were none before luther who beleeved the protestant faith in their hearts because luther himself beleeved the roman catholique faith in his heart and of this there can be no greater evidence then his own testimony against himself
for he professeth that he honoured the pope for conscience sake and thought that he would have been severed from god if he had been separated from the pope and much more to this purpose
therefore luther was not a dissembled protestant but rather a sincere papist before he began to oppose the pope
neither were there any other before him who believed the protestant faith professed the contrary because his followers were ignorant of the protestant religion till luther taught it and shew them the light
this is witnessed by prime protestants

who say it's ridiculous to think

that any man before luther did attayn vnto the true doctrin or that he receiv'd it from others and not others from him
that all the world was overwhelmed with more then cimmerian darknesse that luther was sent to dispell it and to restore the light of true doctrin
besids that chief article of iustification by faith only was altogether vnknown before luther

so that fox affirmeth that luther by opening that veine which lay a long time hid overturned the foundation of popery
wotton averres that luther may truly glory that he was the first who taught christ especially concerning that principal doctrin of iustification by faith alone
therefore saith he it was a great honour to luther to have been a son withovt a father and a disciple without a master
all which testimonies do evince that there was not so much as a dissembled protestant church before luther neither as conceive will any iudicious protestant plead much for such a church which although it had been could not be the church of christ but rather the synaguogue of sathan and so not the true church which we are now searching after

neither had the protestants that other kind of invisible church before luther which beleeved the protestant faith in their hearts and made no profession of the contrary
for first luther his followers did not beleeve it till he opposed the pope as hath been

presently proved
secondly they professed themselves both by words actions to be roman catholiques and so made profession of a religion contrary to the protestant therefore in both these conditions this invisible protestant church is visibly deficient and consequently there was no kind of an invisible church before luther neither a sincere nor a dissembled church if we will iudge of it by the persons who it visible
neither were there any other lurking for they would have shown when there was no more danger for them as hath been said which they not or if they were lurking they are still lurking and will ever lurk vnto the day of ivdgment
for there is no more reason that they shall appeare at any time hereafter then now or in the time of luther
therefore this invisible protestant church is a meer fiction without all ground and against sense experience
the independents who within these twelve years or thereabout and who before had been for the most part violent presbyterians may pretend vpon the same groundlesse fancy that their church had alway's endured invisibly
the same might also pretend the quakers who are more lately sprung vp
but if any of these congregations were so vnreasonable as to make that pretext which they may as lawfully do as any other who would be so vnreasonable as to beleeve them or who could be so simple as to be decived

by them the beginning and progresse of those congregations being so well known so late and fresh in all mens memories in the presbyterian sense any person although never so great a liar might take vpon him to be a prophet
for albeit he foretold things never so false which never came to passe yea that fell out quite contrary he might say with the presbyterians they were all fulfilled but invisibly
now what is more foolish then this device what would be more ridiculous in the of iewes and pagans and more iniurious to the truth of the christian religion for if they would demand how are the prophesies concerning the perpetuity of christs church fulfil'd how are his clear promises to his church kep't and if it were an swered as the presbyterians do that they were all fulfilled and kept but invisibly
what could more confirm these men in their infidelity then this answer what could make the christian religion appeare to them to be more false and ridiculous augustin did far otherwise the of the scripture concerning the church
for writing against the donatists on this same subiect of the church he saith
let vs heare some few things out of the psalms so long ago sung and foretold and let vs now with ioy see them fulfil'd
again heare this out of the divine booke how it was foretold and see now in the world how it is at complish'd
therefore as there is no other way to make a prophesy true but by fulfilling it so there is

no other way to know it to be fulfilled but by visible and sensible performance of it

by what is said may be easily seen that the complaint of elias which is alway's in the puritans mouth makes nothing for their invisible church before luther
for first elias was only speaking of israel as a famous protestant confesseth

in these words
our vnskilfull reformers say that the church was invisible in the time of elias but the holy spirit testifyeth that he spake this of israel and not of iuda for he knew that good iosaphat was reigning in iuda and that the church was not only visible there but also floorishing in great piety
wherefore it is an evil parity to say the iewish synagogue was invisible a short time in one province albeit it was visible at the same time in another
therefore the christian church may be or was invisible throughout the whole world for a thowsand years above

these who were lurking in the time of elias bowed not their knees to baal which if they had done they had not belong'd to the invisible church of god
but all the suppos'd invisible
protestants as luther and his followers bowed their knees to the masse which they esteem idolatry as hath been shewed
therefore they could not be the invisible church of god

although these good israelits were invisible to elias at such a distance when he fled yet he knew many of them to be visible both to others

and among themselves
for abdias told him a little before that he had hid

prophets of the lord in two caves where he fed them
but all protestants before luther were invisible both to others and themselves
for not so much as one person knew himself to be a protestant before luther taught that religion as hath been proved

although the whole iewish synagogue had been invisible which is most false yet it followes not the whole christian church may be or was so too for this as paul testifyeth is founded vpon better promises


salvation was not altogether tyed before christ to the iewish synagogue for there were some faithfull gentils as melchisedeck iob
but the presbyterians by making the whole christian church to be invisible for many ages take away all the ordinary means of salvation which only can be had in the visible church
lastly
albeit all the faithfull both iewes and gentils had been invisible in the time of elias yet this would make nothing for protestants vnlesse they had been also invisible before luther
but de facto there were no lurking protestants before him as hath been clearly proved
therefore although the church could be invisible yet the protestants had no invisible church before luther
and besides the reasons brought above against this invisible church it may seem truly strange that for so many ages not so much as one person of it was heard of or known never so much as one false brother could be found among them to reveale them
and which is

most strange when this invisible church became visible not so much as one person did appeare who had been a lurking member of it
such groundlesse conceipts require strong imaginations to fancy them but much more credulous hearts to beleeve them
wherefore elias complaint for many reasons makes nothing for protestants but is cleary against them

so is also their other refuge to the church of the predestinate which they say was invisible before luther
for
there is no such church because christs church is a congregation of all true beleevers as well reprobate as predestinate there is in his floore both wheat and chaffe and in his field both corne tares

the predestinate are as visible as the reprobate peter was as visible as iudas

although it were granted there had been some invisible predestinate before luther yet none of them could be protestants because none believed the protestant faith till luther taught it as hath been proved

either these supposed protestants before luther professed their faith or not if they professed it then they were not invisible

if they profess'd it not then they were not predestinate
for with our heart saith paul we beleeve vnto iustice and with our mouth confession is made to salvation

it is at least requisite that the predestinate should not deny their faith if they will not confesse it or else they cannot be predestinate
but all the supposed invisible protestants before luther

denyed their faith by professing popery as hath been shewed

therefore they could not be predestinate
lastly heresies and persecution make the predestinate more conspicuous
heresies saith paul must be that these who are approved be made manifest among you
who are more approved before god then the predestinate who are made more manifest before men then they especially when heresy persecution do arise for then by their close adhereing to the true faith and their profession of it whereas others either through error or feare fall from it they are rendred more conspicuous as the scripture shewes and therefore they are not made hid invisible as the puritans do alleadge
hence it is that the church is so far from being invisible in the predestinate more then in others that vpon the contrary when that might happen in others either by error infirmity or feare of persecution then the true church shall be most manifest in the predestinate

and is principally conserved in them
for then as augustin speaks in suis firmissimis eminet she shines in her most stedfast members
predestination indeed is invisible and so is reprobation but the predestinate are as visible as the reprobate yea

they are the most eminent members of the visible church out of which they cannot be found as melanchton confesseth
let vs not dreame saith he that the elect can be found any where but in the visible society of the church
but the protestants had no visible church before luther

therefore they had no predestinate and so many wayes this babel is overturned
the apostles and all the ancient christians who were predestinate were members of the visible church and professed their faith in the time of the heathen persecutions which were more cruel vniversal then any that has hapned since
they had not giges ring to make themselves invisible not the black arte of dissembling in religion as the invisible protestants if there were any behoved to have which are qualities very vnbeseeming the predestinate

by all which it remaines sufficiently proved that the protestant church cannot be the true church
for to resume briefly the argument
the true church must have still continued since the ascension of christ to this time
but the protestant church hath only continued since the revolt of luther
therefore the protestant church is not the true church
there is nothing more certain then the maior
the minor hath been proved because if there had been any protestant church before luther it had been either visible or invisible
but there was neither
not the first because there was no church nor person before luther that professed entirely any protestant confession for any little time much lesse for the whole time between the apostles luther
not the second because if there had been any invisible protestant church before luther it had become

visible when luther appeared and the feare of persecution was taken away
but no such invisible church did then appeare
and moreover it hath been shewed that although the protestants had had an invisible church before luther yet it could not be the true church which ought to be alwayes visible and that an invisible church is against scriptures fathers reason protestants own principles disparageth the christian religion gives great advantage to iewes and infidels and leads men into apostasy and atheism
and so both the holes of visibility and invisibility by which these foxes were accustomed to escape are now lay'd or stop't
the diverse essaies which many protestants make to find their church shew the difficulty of the question so that they see what they ought not to say but cannot see what to say that hath any probability of truth
they have travailed much to find out their church before luther they have been above these
years in seeking it and we have followed the most famous guides among them
but both they we have laboured in vaine to find that which cannot be found
yet we make much profit of our labour if we have discovered that the protestant church before luther cannot be found not because it was hid but because it was not as hath been proved and therefore leave off any further search of it following augustins advice who writes thus to the donatists about the like purpose
some thing saith he

may be and yet not found out but that which hath no being cannot be found
let them therefore leave off to seek that which they could not find not because it was hid but because it was not
to this purpose spake the catholique who vpon my desire delivered me thereafter these things more fully in writing which after serious consideration of them gave me such satisfaction that desired him to proceed to the proof of his own church which he did in the manner following
chap
xxx
that the church in communion with the sea of rome and she alone is the true church
having already proved to your satisfaction said my catholique friend to me your church not to be the true church and that by the vndenyable principle of the perpetuity of the church will now endeavour with the assistance of gods grace to prove no lesse clearly by the same principle laying aside other proofs the church in communion with the sea of rome and her alone to be the true church
which briefly do after this manner

that is the only true church which has had

a continued succession from christ his apostles to this time
but the church in communion with the ea of rome and she alone has had a continued succession from christ his apostles to this time
therefore the church in communion with the sea of rome and no other is the true church

the maior is clear
for to have a continued succession to be perpetuall is the same thing
now as we have seen above that the true church must be perpetual or must have continually endured from christ his apostles to this time so it is no lesse evident that that is only the true church which has been perpetual or has still endured
this the holy fathers do testify this the light of reason doth evince
hierom saith will bring a short and clear declaration of my mind that we ought to remain in that church which being founded by the apostles endures even vnto this day
and the reason is because we ought to remain in the true church and that according to hierom is the true church which hath still endured from the apostles

to the like purpose tertullian saith that is true which is first that is first which was from the beginning that is from the beginning which was from the apostles
and therefore that is the true church which has continued from the apostles

this same truth is also cleared by the light of reason
for the true church was first founded by christ his apostles before any heresies

or false churches which carie the name of christian were or could be raised by heretiques
because truth is alway's before falshood the body is before the shaddow and the good seed is sow'n in the field before the tares
therefore that is the true church which was first and from the beginning and consequently that is the only true church which hath been perpetual for that only could be first from the beginning
moreover this truth is confirmed
for it is certain that de facto no heresies or false churches have continued from the primitive times because these which arose of old have long ago evanished and these which remain to this day have but for a short time endured
therefore if it be most certain that the true church must be perpetual then it is also certain that that only is the true church which has been perpetual since one only christian church hath been perpetual
yea albeit any heresy had continued even from the ancient primitive times as never any of them by gods special providence can see so many dayes yet it could not be perpetual because it could not be first and from the beginning which only the true church can be as we have seen but it behoved to be raised thereafter by heretiques and therefore could not be so ancient as the true church and consequently had not perpetually endured
by all which the maior of our argument is sufficiently cleared

the minor to witt that the church now in communion with the sea of rome and she alone has still endured or has had a continued succession from christ and his apostles to this time is proved by all the evidences whereby such a proposition can be proved whereby the holy fathers proved it in their times
for all histories all monuments records publique fame the consent of people nations and as augustin speaks the confession of mankind bear witness that this church and she alone has had a continued succession
for this was the church which in the primitive times suffered and overcame all the cruel persecutions of the iewes pagans this is the church which hath converted kings nation from infidelity to christianity which hath had her gates continually open day night in all generations to receive the strength of the gentils and in a word which has made the world christian
this is the church which alone in has opposed all the heresies which did arise in their diverse ages from the beginning of christianity and albeit they all have shut out their hornes against this church and both by slight might have endeavoured to destroy her yet she alone hath fought against them all and gloriously triumphed over them all
this is the church which has held all the general councels which hath condemned all errors and heresies which has had pastors and people professing the faith in all ages without interruption and in

which all the saints martyrs and doctors have lived
these things might be shown by a particular catalogue of this churches chief pastors councils nations converted and publique professors in every age if it were not too longsome and besids it is so clear that it is not here necessary especially seing the lutheran centurists who have raked together all they can both for themselves and against the roman church yet can shew the succession and continuance of no other but only of this church
and the reason of this is clear because this church and she alone hath so clearly this succession that no other churches which carie the name of christian can so much as pretend to have it in the least degree of probability
for it is evidently certain that all other churches which are separated from this church were once of her faith communion and went vndeniably out of her and therefore they cannot be so ancient as she and consequently they have not alwayes had a continued succession from the apostles and if they pretended it they would be most ridiculous making an evident lie against sense
therefore the protestants wisely pretend no such thing
yea their whole reformation is grounded vpon a contrary pretext that the whole church had fallen into desolation grosse errors heresy and idolatry which is inindeed to pretend that the succession of the church had failed and that they were now sent to set her vp again
by all which it is seen

that the church in communion with the sea of rome and she alone has had a continued succession from christ his apostles and that so clearly that no other church can pretend to have it

this same truth was testifyed by the holy fathers in their time
hierom said above that he would bring a clear declaration of his mind that that is the true church that hath still endured to witt the church in communion with the sea of rome which he esteem's so much to be the true church that he affirmes those who have no communion with her to belong not to christ but to
for thus he writes to damasus bishop of rome with the successor of the fisher and with the disciple of the crosse speak
following none chief but christ hold the fellowship of communion with thy holynesse that is with peters chaire
vpon that rock know the church to be built
whosoever shall eate the lambe without that house is a prophane person
he that gathereth not with thee scattereth that is saith he who is not christs is
this old doctrin is far different from the presbyterians new opinions
cyprian saith who leaves the chaire of peter vpon whom the church was built does he think to be in the church but let vs hear augustin the most glorious doctor of the church shewing this same truth
for after he had spoken much of the sincere wisdom great holynesse and fruits of piety of the church and of the great authority

which god hath conferr'd on her he subioyns these remarkable words to his friend honoratus
seing therefore we see so great help and assistance from god shall we make any doubt or question at all of retiriing into the bosome of that church which to the confession of mankind from the sea apostolique by the succession of bishops hath obtain'd the soveraignity principal authority heretiques in vain barking round about it being condemned partly by the gravity of councels partly also by the maiesty splendour of miracles vnto which not to grant the chief place is either indeed an extream impiety or a very rash and dangerous arrogancy
thus he
here we see what church in the time of the holy fathers had this continued succession and the same is no lesse evident to this day
in the scriptures we read the prophesies and christs promises of his church and in this church alone we see no lesse clearly the performances
what the scripture had foretold

here with ioy as augustin speaks we may see fulfilled
the church before was only read in books and now it is seen in nations

by all which authorities evidences both the maior and the minor of the argument proposed are sufficiently proved to be manifest truths to witt that that is only the true church which has had a continued succession from the apostles to this time
and that the church in communion with the sea of rome and she alone has had a continued succession

from which the conclusion followes clearly
therefore the church in communion with the sea of rome is the only true church of christ
you see this reason is neither new nor obscure for it was vsed by the holy fathers as a most clear short and convincing way whereby the true church may be known
if it was so easy strong then it is no lesse but rather more evident forcible now
if the succession of the church for
or
hundred years and of
or
roman bishops was esteem'd so strong by the fathers to prove the true church how much more forcible is the successio of the church for above
yeares above
hundred bishops of the sea apostolique to prove the same truth nothing could be said by the ancie~t fathers in confirmatio of this truth which may not as iustly be said now and nothing can be pretended now by the present enemies of the roman church against it which might not have been as iustly prete~ded by her ancient enemies the old heretiques
neither is there any way to shun the force of this demonstration but either by affirming that the true church had perished which is detestable blasphemy or by saying she became invisible which we have shown above to be a grosse falshood and desperate folly

this whole matter may be further illustrated and confirmed
there is nothing more clear in the scripture then that the church of christ must still endure or have a continued succession of people professing the same faith

which was taught by the apostles
now it is no lesse clear it is granted by all christians that the church in communion with rome had once this succession and professed the true faith at least for some years after the apostles
therefore either she holds still the same true faith and so has a continued succession from the apostles or else if she hath fail'd some other church hath succeeded and kept the true faith in all generations thereafter
but no other church can be assigned which hath still succeeded
therefore either the church in communion with the sea of rome which was once vndenyably the true church is still the true church and hath ever professed the same true faith or else the true church of christ which ought to be perpetual and visible hath perished out of the earth for many ages which no christian can affirm
moreover as the true church is clearly easily known by her continued succession so all false churches are evidently discoverd by their new rising

the most ancient father irenaeus having reckon'd out the succession of the roman bishops by which he shewes the succession of the true church from the apostles saith haec est plenissima ostensio
this is a most full demonstration that the same lively faith taugth by the apostles is still even vnto this day conserved in the church and truly delivered
and by this saith he confundimus omnes
we confound all novelists who cannot shew such a succession
hierom saith that any

new church which hath not still endured from the apostles is not the church of christ but the synagogue of
for by this same very thing that they are afterwards established they shew themselves to be those whom the apostle foretold were to arise
tertullian affirmeth that heretiques are discovered by their age alone
again to cut short all disputes with heretiques we vse to prescribe them by their posteriority or after rising

but it is worth the observation and much illustrates this matter to consider what two contrary things the scripture foretells of the true church and of heresies
of the church it shewes that it hath no later beginning then christ who founded it and can end no sooner then the consummation of the world
both these truths are contain'd in that one sentence of christ to speak of no more
vpon this rock will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
of sects heresies it shewes iust the contrary

they are not so ancient as christ but arise afterwards as paul foretold the ephesians saying know that after my departure there will ravening wolves enter in among you and of your selves shall arise men speaking perverse things

iohn saith they went out from vs
as they rise lately so they quickly decay paul saith they shall prosper no further
the first two are verifyed clearly in the catholique church which being founded by christ hath continued to this day without interruption and so shall continue vnto the end of the world
for

this being the work of god cannot be dissolved as gamaliel wisely or rather divinly foretold
the other two are no lesse verifyed of all false churches
for they began of late in several ages after the apostles and albeit they seem'd sometimes firmly established yet being the works devices of men they were ever at length dissolved
the first point to witt late rising is verifyd of the protestant churches which were not known before luther their dissensions changes divisions and subdivisions which every day encrease and for which there is no remedie shew that they cannot endure for ever
is it not then truly admirable that the heresies which have risen against the church being so many in number for two hundred heresiarchs are reckoned to have been before luther some of the vpheld by great earthly power maintain'd by diverse svbtile and crafty wits covered with the mask of truth and promoved with furious zeal yet never one of them hath endured and vpon the other part the catholique church being all alone so ancient so much hated so much calumniated and persecuted by them all hath stood out against them all and endures vnto this day is it not very considerable that all heretiques having intended by slight and might the destruction of the catholique church which some of them have most cruelly persecuted and the building of their own new respective churches yet they could never get either of these two designs accomplished

for the catholique church being founded by christ vpon a rock cannot be shaken
whereas these new churches albeit sometimes they seem to be brought neer vnto some setling perfection yet before they can get on the capestone for which the presbyterians did often in vain cry fall ever into ruin and confusion
who will consider these things may not see the finger of god in protection of his church the clear performa~ce of all his promises vnto her and vpon the other part who may not see an evident curse fall vpon all heresies which like babels can never be perfited being built vpon the sand cannot long stand or being like adulterous plants cannot take deep rootes

but that you may discern the better how the true church is so easily known by her continued succession all false churches are so clearly discovered by their new rising pray yow conceive in your mind these following representations which are grounded in the scriptures holy fathers

represent vnto your self the true church as a great river passing from one end of the earth to the other running continually from the time of christ his apostles through all generations
and such is the church in communion with the sea of rome having succession of pastors people in all ages like a river ever running in which all the saints as living waters have flowed vnto paradise
but heretical churches are like little brooks or rainfloods not alway's running but rising at several times after stormes

tempests not compassing the earth but overflowing some petty corners of it making for a short space a great noise thereafter running more calmly and in end clean dried vp augustin makes this comparison for on these words of the psalme
they shall come to nothing as water running down he saith let not my brethren some floods which are called torrents affright you the water runs down for a time it makes a great noise it shall soon cease they cannot endure long many heresies are now dead they have run in their streams as much as they could they have run out their waters are dried vp scarcely the memorie of them is to be found
thus he
you know that the covenant did not always run and after it began how furiously it ran what great noise it made how it carried down almost all with it
now you see it runs more calmly it is almost run out and the great noise of it is past

again the true church is like the sun ever shining in all generations according to that of the psalmist he hath put his tabernacle in the sun

which augustin expounds thus he hath placed his church in manifestation
and such has been the church in communion with the sea of rome always visible and ever shining since the time of christ
but all heresies are like comets which arise at certain times being made vp of terrestrial vapours make a great blaze so long as their grosse matter lasts but so soo as that failes they quickly evanish
so indeed are heresies made vp for the most part of te~porary interests which make the for a short time

give a great glister but so soon as the grosse matter of these interests failes as it cannot laste long then they begin to shine dimnly then they languish in end evanish
how great a light was the covenant esteem'd what a great lustre did it make in great britain so long as the interests concurred but these soon failing new lights have risen which have discocovered the former to be meerly humane have made it to languish and in a word have shown it to be a comet

moreover the church of christ is frequently compared by the holy fathers to a ship strongly built and wisely governed by christ which ever since his time hath sailed through the seas of this world and notwithstanding the many tempests which the divel and wicked men have raisd against her yet she riding out them all hath carried in her all these who have been saved vnto the port of salvation
she has been many wayes tossed but could never be overwhelmed
for

as ambrose saith excellently she cannot suffer ship shipwrak because christ is exalted on the mast that is on the crosse the father sits pilot in the sterne and the holy ghost preserves the
such is the church in communion with the sea of rome as we have seen
but heretical churches are like little boats neither made nor governed by christ but by new who foolishly abandoned the ship of the church
who promise a safe and more easy passage to heaven whereby many are rashly drawn to entrust

their soules to them
but within a short space the stormes arising these new vnskifull pilots being of contrary iudgments fall into horrible dissensions and their passingers into bloody factions to the destruction of one another
so that in end these boats which came but lately vpon the sea of this world which intended fondly to sink the church are das't against rocks split in pieces and all these miserable soules which remain'd in them are overwhelm'd with waters

for whosoever saith hierom is not in the ark of noah shall perish by the raging deluge
and thus all false churches after a little time have perished
lastly the church is compared by christ vnto a house built by himself as by a wise vpon rock which must stand for ever
and such is the church in communion with the sea of rome which hath stood vnto this day
but heresies are new houses built by foolish masters not founded vpon a rock but vpon the sand which are soon shaken overthrown
wherefore to conclude hope now through gods goodnesse that you having seen such evidence for the truth of the roman catholique church will make your self a domestique of this heavenly house which can never be shaken that you will enter into this ship which can suffer no shipwrack that you will walk in this light that can never be eclipsed and that you will runn this channel wherein all the saints have pas't vnto paradise
to this purpose spake the catholique
after had considered diligently all these things which were given me thereafter in writing and had seen that this reason was so well grounded in the scriptures and was vsed by the holy fathers as a most clear and convincing way to prove the true church was much satisfyed therewith
but yet desired the catholique if he would fully satisfie me to shew that the roman catholique church had never changed her doctrin and had still kept that same which she had received from the apostles
for doubt not said but you know that the ministers accuse her to have fallen from the apostolique doctrin in many points and to have brought in many corruptions
wherevnto he answered that by proving the church in communion with the sea of rome and her alone to have had a continued succession he had proved clearly her to be the true church and so consequently to haue stil retained the same doctrin which was taught by christ and the apostles for change of doctrin changeth the church and so the doctrin being changed the church had not continued
but said he for your more full satisfaction to take away all doubts and to dispell the mists of these calumnies will prove the same truth by another special way
chap
xxxi
that the church in communion with the sea of rome holds now and has still held the same doctrin which was taught first by christ his apostles
albeit this truth hath been sufficiently proved by the continued succession of the church yet now it shall be demonstrated by the special manner whereby this church has received and still conveighed all her doctrin and for more clearnesse frame my reason thus
that church which in all ages believed nothing as the doctrin of christ his apostles but what she received from her immediat ancestors as their doctrin holds and hath still held the true doctrin of christ his apostles
but the church in communion with the sea of rome she alone hath in all ages received all her doctrin after that manner
therefore she alone holds and hath still held the true doctrin which was first taught by christ his apostles and consequently she has never changed the doctrin which she first received

the maior is proved after this manner
that church which in all ages believes the same doctrin which christ and his apostles

taught in the first age hath ever held the true doctrin of christ his apostles
but that church which believes nothing as christs doctrin but what she received as such from her immediat ancestors believes in all ages the same doctrin which christ his apostles taught in the first age
therefore that church which receives so her doctrin has ever held the same doctrin which was taught at first by christ his apostles
the reason of this vniformity of doctrin in all ages is because that principle of receiving no doctrin as the doctrin of christ his apostles but what was delivered immediatly by the christians of the preceeding age makes the doctrin of every following age the same with the doctrin of the preceeding age and so makes the doctrin of all after ages the same with the doctrin of the first age
for suppose that the church now in this age relies vpon that principle to believe nothing as christs doctrin but what her predecessors of the
age taught her to be his doctrin it is evident that the doctrin of these two ages will be the same
and the church of the
age relying vpon the same principle must hold the same doctrin which the church of the
age held and so vpward the doctrin of the third age will be the same with that of the second and the doctrin of the second will be the same with that of the first and so if this principle has been carefully observed in all ages the doctrin of all ages will be the same with the doctrin of the first age which is the doctrin of

christ and of his apostles
the maior then is evident

the minor is proved thus
the church now in communion with the roman sea holds in this age that principle
for she professeth to believe nothing contrary to the doctrin of her immediat ancestors and presumes to add nothing as christs doctrin vnto the doctrin of her ancestors
therefore she professeth to believe nothing as christs doctrin but what she received as such from her immediat ancestors
if the church of the present age professeth so as it is evident she doth then the church of the fifteenth age behoved to make the like profession or else the church of this age could not make it
for so many persons as are now in communion with the roman church cannot concurre to make so notorious sensible a lye as to say they professe nothing but what was profes't and taught by their immediat ancestors if these of the
age had not made truly such a profession of the same doctrines
and for the same reason these of the
age could not make that profession and teach it vnto this age vnlesse the
age had done the same and so you may ascend vpward even vnto the first age
therefore the church professing to observe this principle now in this age hath profes't it alwayes
if she has profes't it alwayes she has also observ'd it alwayes for the same reason because so many nations as are in commmunion of the roman church cannnot make so notorious a

lye as to say they believe nothing but what they received from their immediat ancestors if they believed any thing else as christs doctrin which they had not received
therefore seing they affirm in all ages even vnto the first that they received all their doctrin from their ancestors it must be true that they did receive it all and it must be also true that with the other doctrine they received and observed this principle to believe nothing but what has been delivered by their immediat ancestors for this is as it were the rule ground of all particular doctrines so that by proving that the present church in communion with the sea of rome professeth to observe this principle it's proved she profes't it alwayes and by proving that she profest it alwayes it is shown she has observ'd it alwayes and this principle been alwayes profes't and observed it has been ever delivered with the rest of the doctrin as the main ground whereon the church hath relyed by which men may come vnto the sure knowledge possession of the true doctrin which was taught by christ his apostles
so that if the whole church hath not made a notorious sensible lye in one age to damn themselves and their whole posterity she hath ever received all her doctrin from her immediat ancestors and so it will be true that the doctrin of all ages is the same with the doctrin of the first age which is the true doctrin of christ his apostles
now it rests to be shown that this church alone observes the

former principle which is easily done
for if there had been any other society of christians which had constantly kept that principle it had also kep't the same doctrin which the roman church keeps as is evident by what hath been said
secondly no other churches and especially the protestant can so much as pretend to keep this principle
for they are so far from professing to receive all their doctrines from their immediat ancestors that at their first rising they accuse their ancestors and the church in their time of errors whereof they professe themselves to be reformers and that not by doctrin which they had received immediatly from others but what they had received or pick't out from the scriptures by their private collections which has been the ordinary custom of all heretiques
and this is evident in protestants who do acknowledge that they have their doctrin not by the testimony of the age immediatly preceeding luther but from him who opposed the whole church in his time and for many ages before him which he pretended to reform by the scriptures

the whole strength of this proof is grounded vpon this manifest truth that a full report from whole worlds of fathers to whole worlds of sons of such things as they heard and saw is altogether infallible since sensible evidence in a world of eye witnesses vnanimously concurring is altogether infallible
and such is the test mony of the whole church

in every age for her doctrin that it is the very same which was delivered by christ and his apostles and therefore it was truly delivered by them
for neither can the church be mistaken in this testimonie since whole nations cannot be deceived in what is told them not once or twice but what is dayly beaten into their ears what they are bred with and what they see dayly with their eyes or else we may say the whole world erres in iudging white from black
neither can all the christians in the world dispersed through so many nations malitiously conspire to make so notorious a lie as to say they heard this taught and saw it practised if they had not seen and heard it for that were to testify a lie in a matter subiect to sense against their greatest interest to witt the salvation of themselvs of their posterity
if it be impossible that all the persons of a great citie and much more of a whole nation should think affirm that they saw and heard such things which truly they neither saw nor heard
how much more is it impossible that all christians cities nations should think and affirm they were instructed in such doctrines saw such practices if it were not really true that they had received these doctrines seen these practices

hence it remaines evident that this continued testimony of so many christian in every generation is a most sure infallible way to attayn vnto the certain knowledge of what doctrin christ his apostles taught and that

the catholique church by her constant treading this way has still held the same true doctrin which she first received and consequently has never changed her doctrin nor brought in corruption as the ministers do caluminate
and therefore their pretended reformation having no other ground but this calumnie is a groundlesse imagination and a destruction of christs true doctrin
but that the truth of this whole matter may yet more fully appear will shew you briefly that this constant testimony is the only sure infallible way to attayn vnto the certain knowledge possession of our saviours true doctrin that it is also most easy vniuersal for all sorts of persons that the holy fathers primitive church did follow it and that all errors heresies have been clearly confuted by it

we have already show'n that this testimony is a sure infallible means now that it is only sure infallible

is shewed
for if there were any other it would be the scripture as protestants pretend
but that cannot be

because we cannot beleeve the scripture without the testimony of the church as augustin clearly avoucheth

albeit we could know it without that testimony yet by the scripture we cannot know the whole doctrin of christ especially since the scripture it self saith hold fast the tradition
thirdly principally albeit the scripture contain'd the whole doctrin of christ yet how shall

know assuredly by the letter of the scripture the true sense of it without which have not the true doctrin of christ
yea may corrupt the scripture or follow those who corrupt it as peter shewes many do vnto their own perdition
here many if not all protestants are perplexed to show how by the scripture the true sense of it may be had
some say that the scripture is clear in all things necessary to salvation so that every man may easily vnderstand them
others think that the scripture is not so clear but an interpreter is necessary
but they are divyded in assigning this interpreter
some say the scripture in one place expounds it self in another others assign the private spirit and last of all some assign for an interpreter every mans natural reason
but all these are false frivolous pretences
for first they could never shew what these necessary points are
besides this is an open confession that by the scripture we cannot know assuredly our saviours doctrin in these points which they call not necessary
then is not the true belief of the sacrament necessary for the church and yet we see what contrary glosses the lutherans calvinists make on our saviours clear words
lastly if there needed no interpreter for things necessary every one although vnlearned who could but read might pick out what are necessary which troubles the most learned heads among them to find out and these who could not read behoved to pin their implicit faith at

at other mens sleeves
now what confusion would this make what vncertainty would there be in this case of our saviours doctrin and how contrary are these things to truth and experience to protestants principles practices so it is evident that by the scripture alone we cannot come to the sure and infallible knowledge of our saviours doctrin
neither can we attayn to it by the scripture assisted by any interpreter which protesta~ts assign
for it is false that the scripture expounds it self it being obscure in many places which are not interpreted by others more plaine as may appear besides other reasons by the protestants dissenssions in many points
the conference of places study and the like which some require to be ioyn'd with the scripture are but humane helps subiect to error and not infallible
then for the private spirit it can give vs as little assurance of the sense as it can of the letter of the scripture
we see what contrariety is among those who all equally lay claim to it
neither is the last interpreter to witt every mans reason assigned by chilingworth the last peaceable refiner of the english church any white better but rather worse
for besids that this opinion makes humane reason not the divine authority the main ground of our faith which is a dangerous errour it is so far from bringing men vnto the sure knowledge of what our saviour taught that it professeth no more but a moral certainty for the truth of the whole christian religion and leaves all

particular doctrines to be pickt out of the scriptures according to the diversity of mens particular reasons
and so diuerse men according to the diversity of their reasons collect from the scriptures opposite doctrines
for what some think reasonable accept others esteem vnreasonable and reiect as is evident in the socinians who deny the divinity of christ principally vpon this ground because it chokes their reason as the calvinists also chiefly for the same reason deny the reall presence
so that this interpreter brings as great vncertainty to know our saviours doctrin as any other
and therefore it remaines evident that the scripture even assisted by any interpreter which protestants can assigne much more the scripture alone is not a sure infallible means for this end and consequently the testimony of the church is the only sure infallible means

but here did enquire of the catholique
if the scriptures were as cleer every where as augustin affirmes they are concerning the church where he saith they need no interpreter might they not then give vs vndoubted assurance of our saviours doctrin to which he answered that although the scripture were never so clear and as evident in every sentence as words can be written yet because these words may be diversly vnderstood taken indifferent senses they cannot be so sure infallible away to certifie vs what was our saviours doctrin as the living words testimony

of the whole church which received the true doctrin and the sense together with the letter of the scriptures which she hath constantly transmitted vnto posterity
this is evident in a very principal point of the christian religio to witt the holy sacrament
what words can be more clear then these of our saviour this is my body which shall be given for you and yet vpon these clear words there are reckoned about two hundred diverse interpretations since protesta~ts arose how then should a man amo~g such variety of senses come vnto the true sense be sure that he has attayn'd vnto it in which only christs true doctrin consists therefore it is evident in this case that the written word cannot do it and this only the church can perform which has conserved both the letter and sense of the scriptures from corruptions
if then the scriptures although they were written in most cleer words cannot certifie vs fully of the true sense of our saviours doctrin how much lesse can they as they are now being in many places hard and obscure these protestants who reiect all but scripture would make christ to have been the most imprudent lawgiver that ever was in ths world to have left vs only a written law or a book in many things very obscure and expose it to every man to scance vpon without assigning an interpreter who could give vs full assurance of the true sense of it
that way would never bring men to the sure knowledge of christs doctrine and the true sense of his law but

would make all things vncertain and bring in a confusion more worthy of babel then of the house of god
but his divine wisdom hath otherwise provyded

we haue seen then said the catholique that the testimony of all christians in every generation is the only sure infallible way now we shall see that it is the most easy vniversal way to attayn vnto the certain knowledge of what christ his apostles taught
for what is more easy then to hear a continued testimony of pastors people who constantly depose that this is the doctrin which they have receiued from their forefathers what can be more easy then to open our eys and see the practise of all christians no man of sense will deny if the true doctrin can be surely known hereby but it is a much mor easy way then by the scriptures which are so hard and obscure or by any written word although never so cleer
and it is also evident that it is more vniversal for the scriptures are only for those who can read and vnderstand them but this serues for all sortes of persons learned or vnlearned these who can read or cannot and even for the meanest capacities
this was certainly the meaning of god when he promised vnder the gospel a direct way so that fooles cannot erre by it
therefore this being so sure

so easy so vniversal a way the wisdom goodnesse of god who disposeth all things wisely and sweetely has made vse of it
this may be yet further illustrated and confirmed

by the manner how the christian religion was planted
first the apostles stayd long in one place that they might diligently inculcate the christian doctrin as paul said to the ephesians haue not spared to declare vnto you all the counsell of god
for three years night day ceased not with teares to warn every one secondly the apostles earnestly exhorted their disciples to keep carefully what they had received

to entrust it vnto faithfull witnesses and not to admit any doctrin contrary to that which they had received not although an angel from heauen should preach otherwise
thirdly the mysteries of the christian religion were not only sensibly taught to the eare but they were rendred visible to the sight by the devotion of the christian people
fourthly the christian religion was planted at once in many diverse nations

therefore it was easy for the primitive christians to know what was the apostles doctrin which they had heard so often beaten into their eares which they saw practised with their eys and which was profest through out the whole word and great reason had they not to receive any doctrin contrary to it
it was also easy for them to discern hold out all new false doctrins
for although some would pretend never so much the scriptures against the publique doctrin of the church yet the ancient christians knowing certainly that the scriptures are not contrary to the doctrin which the apostles had clearly delivered by

lively voice and publickly establish'd in the church they vnderstood the scriptures according to the clear rule of faith left by the apostles
they did not vpon pretext of contrariety between the doctrin of the church the scriptures abandon the apostles clear lively doctrin vniversally establisht and follow a new glosse of their writings contrary to it which had been indeed grosse follie and directly against the apostles command in the scriptures as has been shown
and as this was an easy way in the first ages to know the truth and to discern error so it has been in the succeeding ages
for the rule of faith ought to be immoveable as the faith it self is

god himself promiseth the continuance of this easy way when he said by esay my spirit which is in thee and my words which have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth and out of the mouth of thy seed for ever
and again
vpon thy walls ierusalem haue appointed watchmen all the day all the night
the scripture directs vs to this way
remember the dayes of old saith moyses consider euery generation ask thy father and he will show thee thy elders they will tell thee
god himself saith in ieremy stand you in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way and walk therein and you shall find rest to your soules
because many leave this old good way we see they change many wayes and can find no rest and never will vntill they return again to the old good way

which they foolishly abandoned
christ directs vs to this way

when he saith tell the church and who heares you heares me

the holy fathers followed this way
augustin shewes that this is the way to put an end to all doubts to attayn vnto the truth to be at rest which he knew by his own experience
if thou seeme to thy self saith he to have been already sufficiently tossed and would make an end of these labours paines
follow the way of the catholique disciplin which has proceeded from christ by his apostles even vnto vs and from hence shall descend and be conveighed vnto posterity
tertullian affirmes there is no other way to know the apostles doctrin
what the apostles taught saith he will prescribe ought no otherwise to be proued then by these churches which the apostles founded
and that we must begin with the testimony of the church in the time wherein we live to ascend by every generation vnto the ancient church and so to the very mouth of christ his apostles the same tertullian shewes who makes this ladder of belief what believe receiued from the present church the present church from the primitive the primitive from the apostles the apostles from christ
according to this tradition the holy fathers did vnderstand the scriptures

vincentius lyrinensis shewes the necessity of this rule to avoid the turnings and windings of diverse errors where he cites and commends the following words of ambrose
let vs therefore keep the precepts of our

elders and not with temerity of rude presumption violate those seals descending to vs by inheritance
to the same purpose origen writeth
in our vnderstanding saith he of the scriptures we must not depart from the first ecclesiasticall tradition nor believe otherwise but as the church of god has by succession delivered vnto vs

by this way also all heresies have been clearly discovered condemned

theodoret expresly witnesseth that the heresy of arius was condemned by the doctrin not written which had been always profest in the church
for there was no end by scripture the arians pretending that as well as the catholiques
tertullian saith there is no good got by disputing out of the texts of scripture
but either to make a man sick or mad
and the reason is because albeit you would bring never so clear scriptures the heretiques will expound all according to their pleasures and they never faile also to bring scriptures for themselvs so that the victory is vncertain or not so evident but by the constant belief of the church all heretiques are clearly confounded
athanasius by this means confounds the arians
behold saith he we have proved the succession of our doctrin delivered from hand to hand from father to son but as for yov new iewes and sons of caiphas what progenitors can you name for your selvs by this means also the error of rebaptizing those who had been baptized by heretiques was refuted and the custom of the church to the

contrary prevailed over all cyprians reasons and many authorities collected from the scriptures
as yet saith augustin there had been no general councell assembled in that behalf but the world was held in by the strength of custom which was opposed to those who would bring in that novelty
stephen pope and martyr wrote to cyprian in these words nihil innovetur nisi quod traditum est let nothing be changed nothing received but what has been delivered

herevpon proposed this difficulty that some things were believed after the definition of a general councel which were not believed before
therefore it would seem that the church has not always relied on that principle to believe nothing but what was delivered by the constant testimony of their immediat ancestors
to which the catholique answered that the clearing of this difficulty would manifest the strength evidence of the former proof
first said he it is evident that the principal if not all the points maintain'd by catholiques and now questioned by protestants did ever appear externally in the profession practise of the whole church and were not defined by anterior councils
therefore according to augustins rule they are apostolical
for that saith he which the vniversal church doth hold and was not instituted by councels but has been still retayn'd in the church is most iustly believed to have descended from no other authority than from the apostles

therefore this obiection makes nothing for the benefit of protestants who condemn many things which were publickly vniversally profest and practised in the church before they were by any councils authorized
secondly these points of faith which were determined by general councels were not defin'd as new doctrines
for either they were generally constantly believed by the whole church till some heretiques began violently to oppose them or there were some points not so generally believed practised throughout the whole church but some catholiques did with submission to the iudgme~t of the church doubt of them
now it is evident that the church in the points of the first kind believed the same thing after the definition of a general council which she believed before as we haue seen out of athanasius concerning the divinity of christ which was believed as well before the great councell of nice as after it
neither were these other points of which some catholiques doubted defin'd as new doctrines but the whole church assembled in a general council after due examination having found these points to have descended by sufficient approued testimony or tradition and being assisted by christ the head of his body which is the church the holy ghost the guide of it according to our sauiours promise special necessary providence over his church proposeth them to be vniversally believed without any more doubt

and whosoever after this definition of the vniversal church of her supreme authority call these things any more in question become heretiques are cast out of the church
but all good christians who had any doubt before for want of the churches proposeall having now got that do acquiesce and are put out of all doubt for to oppose the whole church

as augustin observes would be most insolent madnesse
this whole matter is clear in the question of rebaptization
for it was decided by a general council according to the custom or tradition which was opposed before the council to cyprian
therefore the same thing was a matter of faith was believed before the council although some did not know it to be such till the church did interpose her supreme authority declare it to be so
augustin shewes how much himself relies on this iudgment and that cyprian would have yielded to it if in his time it had been interposed
neither durst we saith he affirm any such thing if we were not well grounded vpon the most vniforme authority of the vniversal church vnto which vndoubtedly cyprian also would have yielded if in his time the truth of the question had been cleared declared by a general council established
vpon the other part these who after the determination of the council maintaynd the same error of rebaptization were esteemed heretiques

which made vincentius cry out thus
admirable change the authors of

one self opinion are called catholiques and the followers of it heretiques and the reason of the difference is because as augustin observes an erring disputer may be suffered in other questions not diligently tried not as yet strengthned by the full authority of the church in these matters an error may be suffered
but after the iudgment of the vniversal church which is the highest authority on earth has past and condemned any error then it is no more to be suffered then these who will not hear the church are by our sauiours command to be esteem'd as heathens publicans
by which the difficulty proposed is clearly answered the proof stands good that the church has alwayes believed that which from father to son has been delivered and amongst all doctrines which have been delivered there is none descended more clearly then the irrefragable testimony of the catholique church either as she is dilated throughout the whole world or as she is assembled in a general council whereof the continual practice of the church from the beginning is a superabvndant evidence

from this truth we will briefly deduce some corollaries

since we neither ought nor can arrive vnto the certain knowledge of our saviours and his apostles doctrin but by the testimony of the catholique church this testimony is not only necessary for the knowledge of the doctrines not written but also of these which are written because the true

sense of these cannot be infallibly known but by this lively rule of faith

the doctrines not written which have been still believed and profest in the church are truly apostolical divine as well as these doctrines which are contain'd in scripture because we have the same infallible assurance for them that we have for these

since the testimony and authority of the vniversal church is the only means by which we can be fully assured what was the doctrin of christ and therefore is the formal motive of our belief it followes that what ever the church testifieth to be revealed by god has been truly revealed and ought to be beleeued whither the matters themselvs be great or small
and hereby the protestants distinction of points fundamental not fundamental is quite overturned and shewed to be impertinent
because neither of these points are beleeved for themselv's but for the divine authority revealing them and this cannot be known but by the testimony of the church by her authority proposing them
therefor the formal motive being the same for all points they are all alike to be beleeved when they are by the same authority of the church sufficiently proposed and in that case to deny any thing albeit never so small for the matter is a fundamental error and clearly opposite to the formal motive of our faith for which all the points of faith are beleeved and whosoever disbeleeves any thing at all so proposed denies faith to god reiects his authority


he who contemnes or neglects the testimony of the catholique church in the time wherein he lives which is a testimony beyond all exception most worthie of credit can never come to the full certain knowledge of our saviours doctrin
for that is as it were the first step of the ladder vpon which if one set not first his foote he cannot arrive vnto the top that is vnto the first age wherein christ his apostles lived

from this principle flow all the notes of the church
as first her vnity in all points of faith
for if she has alway's beleeved nothing but what was received from hand to hand from father to son by the testimony of the christian world and all persons within her submit to the same supreme authority of one chief pastor of general councels the church cannot but have vnity in all points of faith
secondly the holynesse of the church flowes also from the foresaid principle
for if the doctrin of the church was holy at the beginning as all christians must confesse and the doctrin by this continual testimony remaines ever the same as hath been proved then the church is still holy in all her doctrines which all tend to holynesse
thirdly the church is also catholique
for it is by the testimony of christians in all nations that the doctrin of christ is infallibly conueighed vnto vs lastly the church is apostolique
for it is by her continued testimony that the doctrin of christ is known in all generations and therefore

she must have a continued succession from the apostles

wherefore to conclude hope that have proved now sufficiently the church in communion with the sea of rome by receiving all her doctrines in all ages from her forefathers has ever kept the same doctrin which she first received from christ his apostles never changed it and therefore as she was so she still is the spouse of christ being a fruitefull mother yet a chast virgin never parting from christ for she could never be drawn from the doctrin which she once received from him neither by the bloody persecutions of the pagans nor by the deceitfull pretexts and allurements of heretiques yea she never did dissemble the least error in her deerest children

but as iude exhorts has ever contended earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints
she has indeed been ever falsly accused as an adulteresse by all heresies which are themselvs as we have seen before harlots and strumpets but she remaines pure chast
adulterari non potest

saith cyprian sponsa christi
the spouse of christ cannot become an adulteresse she is chast incorrupt
what she once knew of christ she still holds and never at all parts from him as he never parts from his church to which he said will espouse thee to my self for ever
paul speaking of the great love of christ to his church saith that he delivered himself for it that he might sanctifie it and present it vnto himself a glorious

church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
and of the indissolvible coniunction between christ and his church he saith this is a great sacrament but say in christ his church
as the iewes did loaden our saviour with lies calumnies so all heretiques strive to defame oppresse his spouse by the same means but all in vain
for as the innocency of christ did appear and the whole earth was filled with his praises whereas his enemies were cloathed with shame confusion were scattered through the earth had their temple destroyed and their nation ruined
so within a short time the vnspotted innocency purity of his spouse is manifested to the shame confusion of all heresies which being accursed by the church with all their lies calumnies are ever at length destroyed from the face of the earth for as the wiseman has observed the mothers curse rooteth vp the foundation
if it was a great sin in the iewes that they not only refused to hear and obey christ but also falsly accused him and many wayes lyed and blasphemed against him
it cannot be a small sin in heretiques that they do not only refuse to hear the church for which crime alone they are by christs command to be holden as heathens publicans but also they falsly accuse his spouse which he loves so deerly for an adulteresse and charge her with idolatry superstition all sorts of abomination
these calumnies if not blasphemies are the ground of all their new doctrines

pretended reformations by which we may know the rare fabrick which is erected vpon it
but all these lies calumnies false accusations and railings can prevaile nothing against the church which may say truly as the prophet david foretould of her how often have they impugned me from my youth how often have they impugned me but they have not prevailed against me
sinners have built vpon my back they have prolonged their iniquity
our iust lord will cut the necks of sinners let them all be confounded and turned back which hate sion chrysostom writing on these words of the psalme the queen stood at thy right hand said truly and excellently of her
the church is opposed and overcomes being pursued by snaires she gets the vpper hand being provoked with wrongs and reproches she is made more illvstrious
she is hurt but yields not to the print of the wou~ds how ever she be tossed she is not overwhelmed
she endures great tempests and yet for all that suffers no shipwrack she wrestles but is not thrown down
thus he
thererefore this cloud of the ministers calumnie to witt that the catholique church had changed the doctrin of christ brought in corruptions which is the very same which all heretiques have vsed the new arians vse to this day being dispelled am confident that by gods grace you see now the admirable light of the catholique church and therefore abandoning the darknesse of all error will walk in this light by which all the saints have attain'd vnto

the light of heaven
to this effect with many more words spake the catholique

after had diligently considered all these things the heads of which were given me in writing did not only by gods grace see with my vnderstanding the truth of the catholique church but also was bent with my will to follow embrace it laying aside many worldly difficulties which only stood in my way
and having heartily thanked my catholique friend by whose paines charity had received so much help earnestly desired that for the accomplishment of the work he would assist me to consider how the true church may be known by these
notes which are contain'd in the nicen creed and which he briefly touched above to which he willingly condescended shewing me that any man who believes the scripture may find the true church so manifestly there described by these properties that he may easily find her out or rather clearly see her so that augustin saith the scriptures speake more obscurly of christ then of the church that they are so clear for the church that by no shift of false interpretation they can be avoided that the impudence of any forehead that will stand against such evidence is confounded and that it is prodigious blindnesse not to see which is the true church
shall collect briefly the summe of our conferences in this matter
chap
xxxii
the true church proved from the scriptures first by her vnity

as the great dissensions of our ministers furnished to me the first occasions of my doubting that their church could not be the true church so the very light of nature did shew me that the true church being the work of god must have vnity
for what more belongs to the house of god which ought to be a house of order then vnity what more fitting for his kingdom which must endure for ever then vnity which tends to preservation what more vnbeseeming them then disorder division which at length produces ruine destruction the scripture is full of clear testimonies to this purpose as where it is said of the church my dove is one my beloved is one

and it's called by our saviour one sheepfold

paul doth also excellently shew the vnity of the church in which are diverse functions by the vnity of mans body in which are diverse members but all animated with one spirit as the whole church is quickned by one faith
for else where he saith there is one lord one faith one baptism
but of these other passages of scripture which were brought there was one which had a special influence vpon me and that was our

saviours prayer in the
of iohn where after he had prayed most earnestly for the vnity of his apostles he prayes also for the vnity of the whole church

saying neither pray for those alone but for them also who shall beleeve in me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and in thee that they also may be one that the world may beleeve that thou hast sent me
did seriously ponder this reason which our saviour brings to obtain his desire which was much vrged also by the catholique who shew me that our saviour declared thereby the vnity of his church should be so admirable that the world should be moued thereby to beleeve that he was the son of god a true prophet sent from heaven as some fathers have also obserued
therefore it's evident by the scripture that the true church must have vnity

and that that cannot be the true church of christ which wants it
and if we shall speak of the holy fathers they are so much for this vnity of the church that some of them have written whole treatises concerning it

now it is no lesse evident both to sense and reason that this vnity agrees better to the church in communio with the sea of rome then to the protestant churches or rather it agrees fully to the one and not at all to the other
for who may not see by the manifold schismes divisions which are now among protestants all other sectaries as well in doctrine as government which we have

touched above and which do dayly augment that the protestant churches have no vnity shortly after luthers rising the protestant church was divided into three principal sects to witt the lutherans calvinists zuinglians that we may speak nothing of the anabaptists and libertins
but now their divisions have so multiplyed that they can hardly be numbred
and these divisions are not only great for the matter being in some principal points of doctrin but also have been very great for the manner
for thereby diverse protestants have kild and destroy'd one another made bloody warres and overturned kingdome commonwealths
so that if there were no other christian church but the protestant the world could not be moved by the vnity thereof to beleeve that christ was sent from heaven or had been a divine architect who had built such a babel of confusion

but if laying aside rancour preiudice we will cast our eyes vpon the church in communion with the sea of rome this vnity appears wonderfully in her
for how can it be but wonderfull to consider that this church being dilated throughout the world in so many diverse remote kingdomes provinces countreys of different languages customs worldly interests and some of these being enemies to others in worldly affaires should all agree in the vnity of the same catholique faith as if they were one man whereas all other churches which go out

from this vnder pretext of greater purity although they do not fill the earth but are comprized in small bounds fall into such horrible dissensions and divisions that they never rest till like generations of vipers they destroy one an other and oftentimes the later destroies the former as we have seen in our time the church in communion with the sea of rome may be known to be the true church by this admirable vnity for which christ prayed and christ by it may be known to have been sent from heaven who had establish't vpon earth so large a kingdome of such admirable vnity
if the vnity of the catholique church were not a special blissing of god how could it fall out to her alone how could it have continued so long among such great multitudes of people as have been and are of her communion how comes it to passe that vnity could never be conserved among heretiques who although but few and new could never shun the curse of division which ever destruction followes at the heels for my part cannot resist vnto this clear reason

as this vnity in the catholique church proceeds principally from the blissing of god so secondarly it flowes from the ordinary means which his divine wisdome has appointed and whereof all false churches are destitute
as first from this principle that she beleeves nothing but what has descended vnto her by the constant testimony of her forefathers in all ages from the time of christ his

apostles
by which means it has been shown that she cannot but keep vnity in faith
secondly she receives the decrees of all general councils which in all reason ought to be believed to preserve that which was delivered by the apostles and if any doubt arise about the sense of the scriptures are more able to interpret them then any other persons
to which therefore all the members of the catholique church do modestly wisey submit their iudgments they never ransack any matter of faith once defined but it remaines ever inviolable
and lastly all catholiques submit themselves to one supreme pastor whom they acknowledge to be establish't by christ over the whole church from whom the holy fathers do affirm that the vnity of the church doth much depend
this person appoynted by christ they shew out of the scriptures to have been peter to whom christ said

will give thee the keys of the kingdome of heaven and again feed my sheep feed my lambs
vpon which cyprian saith that christ might shew vnity he establish't one chaire and he disposed by his authority the origin of that vnity to proceed from one
the primacy is given to peter that one church of christ and one chaire might be shown
hierom seeing the necessity of one head

for keeping vnity saith excellently one is chosen that a head being appoynted occasion of schisme might be taken away
and that the bishop of rome is successor to

peter in that same dignity primacy and that the vnity of the church depends vpon his authority all the holy fathers do affirm
the same hierom writing to damasus bishop of rome saith with the successor of the fisher with the disciple of the crosse speak
am ioyn'd in communion with thy holynesse that is with the chaire of peter vpon that rock know the church is built who gathereth not with thee scattereth
augustin affirmes that the succession of priests from the seat of peter to whom our lord after his resurrection commended his sheep to be fed vntill the present bishop held him within the lap of the church
there is nothing more ordinary with the fathers then to reckon out the succession of the roman bishops from peter vnto their time

augustin tearmeth the sea of their residence the chair of vnity and cyprian calls it the beginning of vnity the roote of the catholique church

as by these means the vnity of the true church is preserved so for want of them there can be no constant vnity in false churches
for they all reiecting the infallible testimony authority of the catholique church by which we are certified of our saviours doctrine as has been shewed put their own election and private iudgment in place of it and their iudgments being diverse they make diverse faiths having no compasse to steer by but the scriptures which they diversly interpret according to their pleasures
neither do

they submit themselv's to the sentence of any church for they beleeve that all churches may erre neither is their own church constant in her sentence for one assembly ransacks and condemns as heresy and what another has defined approved as christian truths
neither have they any supreme pastor to whom they obey
and in a word they have no bond to ty them together except sometimes worldly interest or the hatred of another religion
and when these interests faile when by mutual assistance ioyn't forces they have subdued or overturned that church which they esteem their common adversarie then they instantly begin to be miserably scattered divided as fresh experience sheweth how after the destructio of the late english church the brethren of scotland and england became hugely divided notwithstanding the solemne league covenant which had before so straitly tyed them together
yea it is impossible for the wit of man to make it otherwise
for besides that it is impossible that many men can a long time adhere to the same falshoods as we suppose all heresies to be the nature of man being so strongly bent vpon truth this confusion division followes from the nature of their principal doctrin which is the ground work of all the rest to witt that every one should have liberty of reading interpreting scripture and iudging the preachers doctrin thereby
from which ground there must needs arise variety of sects in religion according to the various conceipts and

apprehensions of people
moreover god in his iust iudgment sends ever the curse of division among heretiques for according to their sin so are they punished
they endeavoured to divide the church and themselvs are divided and so at length destroied
this god promised by the prophet esay when he said will set the aegyptians against the aegyptians and they shall fight every one against his brother and every one against his neighbour citie against citie and kingdome against kingdome
augustin saith it is the iust iudgment of god that those who seek nothing else but to divide the church should themselves be miserably divided
and so he shewes how the donatists were cut into small threds
chrysostom affirmes that the sin of dividing the church is so great that nothing doth so provoke the anger of god
so that when we have done all other manner of good

we deserve no lesse severe punishment for dividing the vnity fulnesse of the church then those who pierced divided christs own body
salomon saith that there are six things which our lord hates and the seventh is abomination to him which is he who soweth discord among brethren
how much then must he hate and abhorre those who sow discord in his church which is his body and his spouse for which he died and for the vnity whereof he so ardently prayed and therefore it's no wonder to see the curse of division fall ever among them
and as this division and contrariety ariseth naturally from

their principall doctrin the ground of all the rest besides gods iudgment on them so they have no way to take it away when it doth arise
for albeit they pretend the word of god to be their iugde of controversies to which they promise all obedience yet this iudge could never hitherto end any controversy among them and indeed it is not the word but the sword which decides all their controversies
the iust contrary is in the catholique church
for albeit all heresies and sects do first arise out from her

as the apostle saith there must be heresies and iohn affirmeth they went out from vs but were not of vs yet they do not arise from the nature of the churches doctrin or from her principles which are constant immoveable all tending to vnity but from the malice of the devil
and when they arise the church loseth not her vnity thereby
for if these coyners or followers of new doctrines do not submit themselvs to the iudgment of the church they are iudicially cutt off from that body from which they first cut themselvs by misbeleef and by this means the rest of the body is preserved entire and at vnity within it self
so that when any question ariseth the church has a solid way to take away all controversie and to preserve vnity
but the protestants principles tend to division and they have no means to take it away as has been shewed

since then it is so evident by the scripture that the church of christ must have vnity it

is no lesse evident that that cannot be the true church which wants vnity and is full of dissensions divisions as the protestant church appeares now evidently to be even to the weakest vnderstandings by her great schismes and divisions both in doctrin government
and therefore he who believes a church of so great division or confusion to be the true church cannot be said to follow the scriptures but rather to controul them and to follow his own fancies
whereas the church in communion with the sea of rome by her admirable vnity both in doctrin disciplin all the world over even to the least article or point of faith may be easily seen to be the true church of christ which was founded by him and he by the same vnity may be known to be the true messias who was sent from heaven

the true church proved by her holynesse

the second mark whereby the true church is described in the nicen creed is holynesse beleeve one holy church which property is also assign'd to her in the apostles creed
beleeve the holy catholique church
besides these authorities the very light

of nature and the scripture show that the true church ought to be holy
for this being a society of people ordain'd by god for a most holy end to witt to enioy himself who is the holy of holies for all eternity must have holynesse of doctrin to direct them and holynesse of life to bring them to so holy an end
this the prophet david sheweth

saying holynesse becometh thine house lord for ever
paul saith that christ delivered himself his church that he might sanctifie it that he might present it to himself a glorious church not hauing spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it may be holy and vnspotted
it is evident then by the by the light of nature and by the scriptures that the true church must be holy
and the holynesse of it for our present purpose consists principally in two things to wit in holynesse of doctrine holynesse of life
therefore that church which teacheth impious doctrin and wherein there is little or no holynesse of life cannot be the true church
let vs then briefly see to which church whither to the protestant or to the church in communion with the sea of rome this mark of holynesse doth best agree

first concerning doctrin find that the first apostles of protestants teach doctrin directly repugnant to the goodnesse of god to the nature of man to the holynesse of the christian sacraments to the observation of gods commandments besides many other particulars
calvin the great foundatour of

pressbytery teaches that god is the author of sin for thus he writeth
now have clearly enough shewed that god is called the author of all these things which these controwlers to witt the papists will have to fall forth by his idle permission onely
and such things which according to catholiques god willeth not but only permits are sins of which calvin there speaks as of the blindnesse and tyranny of achab of the incest of absalon and the like of which he calls god the author
again he saith man by the iust impulsion of god doth that which is not lawfull for him to do
and of pharao he saith deus voluit vtique illum iussui suo non obtemperare immo vt ei repugnaret ipse in eo effecit
god willed him not to obey his commandment yea he himself wrought that in him that he might disobey it
many more places are collected by becan in a treatise which he wrote on this subiect de authore peccati
where he cites diverse testimonies of beza and other protestant authors to the same purpose
now that this is an impious opinion and against the very clear light of nature is evident
for all men conceive by natural instinct that god is not only good in himself but also goodnesse it self the author and fountain of all goodnesse
but how can he be goodnesse itself and the author of goodnesse if he be the author of wickednesse a holy father saith it's the same madnesse to deny god and to say he is the author of sin
for if he be the author of sin he is not good if he be not good he is not

god
the manicheans taught the same impiety but with this difference that they made not the good but the evil god the author of evil
moreover it's evident that god cannot be the author of that whereof he is the punisher
but he is the punisher of sin
therefore he cannot be the author of it
know some protestants strive to make a faire face vpon this doctrin of calvin but all in vain for it is so black and vgly of it self in the tearmes which he vseth that as it is in the proverb these who would blanch it vndertake to wash a
the text is so bad that it can admit no good commentarie

so that the lutherans in germanie have condemned it as contumelious against god pernicious to mankind and the zuinglians of berne caused calvins books wherein these black errors were contain'd to be burnt publickly by the common executioner
he teacheth also some doctrin no lesse pernicious in the iudgment of many concerning predestination as that god by his only will has ordaind many without any consideration of their merits to damnation

his words are these by his only will and without any consideration of their merits they are predestinated to eternal death
such doctrin which transformes god into the devil and represents him as the greatest tyrant imaginable cannot be holy no more then he who taught it can be heavenly albeit he be much esteem'd by the presbyterians who keep still this doctrin lying at their hearts though vpon some occasions

they are ashamd to profess it

secondly
as he robs god of his goodnesse so doth he also spoile man of his which is not only false against common experience and the confession of mankind for as augustin saith no fewnesse of the learned no company of the vnlearned do deny it but also in the iudgment of many protestants it makes all exhortations admonitions and threats which are so frequent in the scriptures both vselesse and ridiculous it hinders all exercise yea and attempt of vertue holynesse and with the opinion of gods absolute decree of reprobation it brings men to despaire
thirdly their doctrin of the impossibility to keep the divine commandments even with the assistance of gods grace we have seen above to be iniurious to the goodnesse wisdom and iustice of god to be a great hindrance of the growth of piety and of the care of a good life from which wicked doctrin flowed the impious sect of the
to which if we shall add that doctrin which they call the life of their religion to witt their iustification by a special faith only whereby they beleeve that all their sins are forgiven them what a wid gate is opened to all licentious liberty to the neglect of piety and of all good works their doctrin also concerning the sacraments is not holy which robs them of all grace and vertue of sanctification
in a word if the proper doctrines of the presbyterians be impartially considered there is almost nothing amongst

them which hath appearance of holynesse or any invitation to it
for they do not esteem their churches holy they have no holy ornaments no holy vessels no holy rites or ceremonies no holy dayes or festivities no holy forme of publique worship or service of god and nothing that setteth forth the maiesty magnificence of god or that can breed respect or revere~ce in man
yea their principles if they be followed lead to prophanesse or atheism whereof will bring some few instances
the first is of one named godefridus a valle who wrote a book

which he entitled of the art of beleeving nothing in which he said all other things false and one only thing true as becan relates to witt that he who would become an atheist should first be a calvinist as himself had been
for from that doctrin of calvin that god is the author of sin and that by his absolute decree of reprobation he had preordain'd the most part of men vnto damnation without any regard of their works but only for his own pleasure he collected that such a god was a most cruel tyrant
therefore he would rather deny there was a god then acknowledge such a god
and therevpon he became a profest atheist and was burnt publickly in paris in the yeare
another instance fell out not long ago in our own countrey on another subiect
for as the presbyterian ministers generally teach that the church is no more holy then any other place nor no more reverence due vnto it except

only when the minister is preaching so a great apostle of the covenant taught that doctrin very eagerly in aberdeen the fruite whereof did shortly thereafter appear
for a covenanting souldier of the saints army was found within few dayes in the colledge church of that town in vncivil conversation with a woman and being brought before the same minister as was credibly informed who did exaggerate the grievousnesse of the crime from the holynesse of the place he answered that there was neither preaching nor praying in the church at that time by which he confounded the minister
now of a long time they keep their churches shut both night and day except only at such times as the minister is to preach
knew also a young lady who took great scandal at a ministers sermon wherein he vndertook to prove against the papists the impossibility of living chastly which doctrin she truly said was very dangerous to young people and loosed the reines to all lasciviousnesse
so that in many points both concerning god and man the sacraments the commandments we see the presbyterian church is not holy in doctrin

but on the other part the church in communion with the sea of rome teacheth most holy doctrin in all these points
for first concerning god she teacheth that in him there are all perfections in an infinit degree that he is not only good in himself but the fountain of all goodnesse and that no evil can proceed

from him
that he is neither the cause author or approver of sin
that he is so good that he would not permit sin to be vnlesse he could draw good from it
that he has predestinate no man to damnation but only for sins which they willingly freely commit
this is the doctrin of the catholique church and of the holy fathers

augustin saith
god who is good would not permit evil vnlesse he being omnipotent could also do good of evil
the arausican council saith we do not only not beleeve that some are predestinate vnto evil by the divine power but if there be any who beleeve so great a wickednesse we accurse them with all detestation
the same holynesse might be shewed of the catholique doctrin concerning and the possibility of keeping the commandments with the assistance of gods grace of iustification of the sacraments which all tend to holynesse to the exaltation of gods goodnesse to the killing of sin to the advancement of piety of all good works as the holy fathers have shown of all the points of the catholique church and particularly augustin who saith truly in the churches of her communion nothing filthie and wicked is proposed to be seen or followed
where either the commandments of the true god are explained or his miracles related or his gifts praised or his benefits desired
besides in the catholique church are many holy houses dedicated and consecrated to gods service holy altars ornaments holy vessels holy solemn worship

service with many holy rites ceremonies manifesting the maiesty magnificence of god breeding respect reverence in man
and in a word this church militant here on earth is a true representation of the church triumphant in heaven still adoring praising and magnifying god
therefore holynesse of doctrin belongs rather to this catholique church than to the protestant

then for holynesse of life
never knew any iudicious protestant but acknowledged that the catholiques had too much the better of them
luther the first apostle professeth that whilst he lived among the religious of augustins order he observed chastity

obedience and poverty that he did all things with a single heart for the glory of god fearing the last iudgment
but after his fall from the catholique church he changed not only miserably his faith but also his life
for thus he proclaimes his own shame
as it is not in my power to be no man so it is not in my power to be without a woman
am burned with the great flammes of my vntamed lust
and to make himself more infamous he having vowed his chastity to god married a profest nun named katherin bore who had made the like vow
he is charged also by his fellow protestants with arrogancy insolency intolerable pride which he exercised against persons of greatest quality as against the emperour charles the fifth and henry the eight king of england
his bitter railings his fowle and

filthy expressions have bred such a stench in all his writings that they purchased to him the title of propheta stercorarius or the dunghill prophet

these qualities are very far different from saints vertues
concerning calvin it is affirmed by conradus shlusselburg a famous lutheran that he was guilty of sodomie and other abominable vices for which he was branded on the shoulder by the magistrate of noyon with a hote iron
that he was striken also a little before his death by the hand of god with herods desease and that he dyed in despaire cursing and blaspheming
no lesse vices also are layd to beza his charge who did celebrate his own shame and filthy lusts with most lascivious epigrammes
all which are not alleadgeances of catholiques but testimonies of protestants against themselvs
neither are these reformers commonly even by protestants esteemd saints
as for the common multitude which followed the reformers luther himself confesseth that the world is become seven times worse

then it was before in the papacy yea it is generally observed that catholiques who become protestants change their life into worse
and albeit the presbyterians during the late troubles did vsurp to themselvs very ridiculously the name of saints yet both in the iudgment of other protestants and in the truth of the matter they were very far from deserving that title
for if we will beleeve the old protestants avarice pride tyranny cruelty impudent railing sedition

periurie and many such other vices are the presbyterians greatest vertues and who are most exorbitant in these enormities are their greatest saints as they instance in some chief apostles of the covenant in whom they affirm these vices to be palpably evident
neither have the presbyterians any better opinion of the old protestants whom they call malignants as appear'd by their excommunication thundered out against the bishops at the assembly of glasgow for very horrible crimes
and albeit the bishops at least some of them were not guilty of these crimes yet there was no wise man even amongst those who loved them most that thought any of them a saint or eminent for holynesse
neither can the presbyterians be saints even in their own principles vnlesse they would make their lives not only better then their belief but also contrary to it
for they teaching that the commandments are impossible to be kept even with gods grace how can they pretend to keep them and if they keep them not how can they pretend to be saints these are poore saints who break every day gods commandments and much more who commit a mortal sin in all their actions as the presbyterians commonly teach
their actions also which need not to be here recounted and ought to be better beleeved than their words shew that they were not saints
a late author who had occasion to know well both sorts of protestants gives this verdict of

them
amongst the legal protestants there are many stored with moral goodnesse but the devotion and zeal is amongst the puritans but it has eaten vp almost all morall honesty among them
so the qualities which were too evident and sensible in the presbyterians even of the greatest estimation shew clearly that they fell so far short of saints perfections that they had not so much as moral vertues
neither did god ever testify either the holynesse of any of their lives or of their doctrin by any miracle

vpon the other part find the lives of roman catholiques especially of those who were converters of nations and foundators of religious orders

to be highly extolled
to speak nothing of more ancient saints
bernard whom all the world knowes to have been most addicted to the pope and roman faith is called esteemed a saint by calvin and by diverse other protestants
the holynesse of dominick

francis and others is confessed by the centurists
the approved sanctity of francis xaverius a iesuite who in the last age converted sundry nations of the east indies is testifyed by hacluite a minister in his book of navigations where he doth highly praise him
luther confesseth that in the papacy is the very kernel of piety
breirly cites the words of diverse protestants who acknowledge that there are many holy men women in the roman church that protestants are not to be compared vnto them in the least degree and that the catholique church hath

many excellent orders and holy institutions

for curbing of sin and advancing of piety whereof protestants are destitute
this must be a strong truth which extorts confession from adversaries and this confession is a most convincent proofe against themselves
moreover amongst many of the catholique church there is found not an ordinary but a sublime degree of holynesse
for many persons in all ages of the greatest quality honour riches have renounced the world all its pleasures that they might serve and enioy god more freely so that they have not only by gods grace kept but also gone beyond the commandments as chrysostom speaks
augustin describing the manners of the catholique church in his time after an excellent apostraphe concerning the holynesse of her doctrin saith vnto her concerning holynesse of life deservedly with thee the divine commandments are kept far and neer
by good right with thee are many given to hospitality many dutifull many mercyfull many learned many chast many holy many so burning with the love of god that in highest abstinence from all worldly pleasures incredible contempt of the world they delight only in the desert
and thereafter shewing the diverse degrees of holy persons in the catholique church as of the anachorits who liv'd in the wildernesse of the monks who liv'd a part by themselvs and of others who were gathered together into communities of religious women who separating

themselvs from the company of men served god chastly diligently and having described their diverse manner of living their divin contemplations fervent prayers frequent fastings and the rest of their holy exercises he saith of the anachorits not without admiration
what is it beseech you that these men who cannot but love man do see and yet can be without the sight of man truly whatever it be it must be more excellent then all humane things since for the contemplation of it a man can live without man
and a little after
to whom this excellent hight of holynesse doth not appear of it's own accord worthy of admiration how can it appear to him by our words then of them all he professeth himself vnable to praise sufficiently these holy manners these holy orders and institutions and if he would vndertake to do it he would be affrayed lest he seemed to detract from them as if they would not please men by the simple relation of the
in end as this were an vndeniable truth appealing to the heretiques own iudgment he saith these things reprove if you can
but if there had been any presbyterians in his time he had found them not only reproving these most holy things but also renouncing abiuring and accursing them as may by known by their covenant practice at the beginning of their reformation
in this indeed the presbyterians go beyond the manicheans
augustin proceeds to the praise of the holynesse of the clergy the bishops priests deacons

whose vertue he saith is so much the more wonderfull how much it's more hard to keep it in such a kind of troublesome life amongst so great a multitude of persons with whom for their spiritual goods they do converse
and yet he saith that he knew many holy persons in all these vocations as also many of the laytie of all ranks qualities living holyly in the world as if they did not vse the world and who would willingly forsake all wordly things before they forsook the love and service of god
this description of the ancient catholique church which the catholique shew vnto me did represent very clearly to my sight how fitly the present catholique church doth agree with it in all these holy orders and institutions and it did no lesse evidently manifest vnto me how monstruously the present protestant church is different from it
lastly diverse histories as well of enemies as of friends have recorded many famous miracles wrought in the catholique church for confirmation of her doctrin and for manifestation of the holynesse of some persons who have lived dyed in her communion
the magdeburgian centurists although protestants have recorded many great miracles done by catholiques in the
chapter of every century for
years together after christ

therefore since holynesse of life doctrin testifyed by miracles from heaven hath in all ages from christ been found eminently in the roman catholique church and in no other

we may most iustly conclude that she and no other is the true church and lawfull spouse of christ

augustin saith the catholique church alone is the body of christ out of this body the holy ghost quickens no man
and a little before
for as a member if it be cutt off from the body of a living man cannot retain the spirit of life so a man who is cut off from the body of christ the iust cannot retain the spirit of iustice

the true church demonstrated by her vniversality for which she is called catholique

as the true church is designed in the apostles creed by her holynesse so is she also by her vniversality
beleeve the holy catholique church
she is clearly also described by the same vniversality

in the scripture
god said to abraham in thy seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed
the prophet esay foretould the same when he said of the church all nations shall flow vnto it

god promised this to christ
will give thee the gentils for thine inheritance the vtmost bounds of the earth for thy possessions
christ himself declared it

when he said that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name vnto all nations beginning from hierusalem
paul

said to the colossians

that the gospel was in all the world fructifyed
therefore to forbear from citing more testimonies it's evident by the creed by the law and the prophets by the psalmes and the holy apostles and by christ himself the most true describer of his own body that his church must be catholique or vniversal for place having the communion of all nations
she must be also vniversal for time that is she must endure from the time of christ vnto the end of the world as we have seen above in the perpetuity of the church
for of christs kingdom there shall be no end and the gates of hell shall not prevaile against his church

these places of scripture are so clear for the vniversality of the church that augustin having produced them against the donatists for the same purpose affirmeth no man how blunt so ever he be and slow of heart can say did not vnderstand them
that none but heretiques with frowardnesse and blind fury can bark against them
and that no excuse is left for those who do not beleeve them because they contradict christs clear words
the next thing then that we are to do is to see to what company of christians whither to protestants or to those christians who keep communion with the sea of rome this property of vniversality by which the true church is so clearly described doth best agree

we need not make great search in this matter

for if we will speak of the time before luther the church in communion with the sea of rome was so much catholique in regard of protestants that there was no little company yea nor one person at all of the protestant religion to be seen or found to contest with her for this glorious title of catholique
whereas from luther vpward in every generation she may be proved by the most famous testimonies histories records monuments in the world to have been alwayes catholique that is to have been a most ample society keeping the communion of nations and to have been most eminent above all other religions sects and heresies that went out from her which being condemned by this church were as vnprofitable boughs cut off from the vine and so remaining where they fell in petty corners of the world did soone wither and decay
again if we will make now the comparison between the church in communion with the roman sea and the protestants churches since luther arose we shall find the last come very short of the other for vniversality and that for the same very reason which augustin brought against the donatists
these sects saith he are not found in many nations where this to witt the catholique church is and this which is every where is found also even where these sects are
so it may be said protestants are not to be found in many nations where the catholique religion is profest and catholiques may

be found where ever protestants are
for all the diverse sorts of protestants are comprized within europe and possesse only the northern parts thereof there being some most famous large kingdomes provinces even within europe where they are not to be seen or found as in all spaine italy sicily and in others they are but scantly sowen as in france poland germanie where they are not a handfull to the catholiques
and in these northern places which they possesse out of which they banished by force the publick exercice of the catholique religion and still persecute the professors of it there are not deficient catholiques who in the midst of the enemies of their religion have alway's profest their faith
but in other parts of the world where the catholique religion doth wonderfully flourish the name of protestants is not so much as known
for the catholique religion is not only publickly professed in the most famous kingdomes and provinces of europe but also it is to be found in africk asia and america
and albeit in diverse countries the publick profession be heretical mahometical or heathnih yet even there the catholique roman church hath fathers and children professing her faith and what she lost by the falling away of protestants in europe she has gained with much encrease by the propagation of the catholique faith in the east and west indies now of late in the great kingdom of china where many thowsands have e~braced the faith
if then the society of christians in communion with the roman church remaines still catholique notwithstanding that the protestants have falne away from her and albeit they would muster together all their forces against her how much more is she catholique in regard of protestants if they be taken a part by their diverse sects scattered troops as in all reason they ought to be for none should be esteem'd of one religion but these who are of one communion and therefore since vniversality doth necessarly include vnity no protestant church can be further vniversal then her communion is spread which will be found to be so little a way that every one of those protestant churches especially being compared with the roman catholique will deserve rather the title of particular then of vniversal

moreover the holy fathers have observed that as the church in communio with the sea of rome has ever had the thing signifyed by the word catholique so she alone has ever possessed the glorious title of catholique whereof heretiques have been very ambitious but could never obtain it
augustin did esteem the title of catholique so plain an evidence of the true church

that he said in the bosome of the church the very name of catholique holds me which not without cause amongst so many heresies that church alone hath so obtayn'd that although all heretiques would have themselvs called catholiques yet when a stranger

enquires any of them where the catholiques do assemble no heretique is so bold as to shew him his own meeting place
again he saith we must hold the communion of that church which is called catholique both by her owne and by strangers

this name of catholique the true church received from the apostles to make her be known from all hereticall congregations which she has ever caried as a badge of truth a title of great honour
cyril expounding the apostles creed saith for this end thy faith has given to thee this article the holy catholique church that thou mayst avoid the polluted conventicles of heretiques
and a little after when thou commest into a town enquire not simply where the temple of our lord is for heretiques also call their dens temples
neither ask simply where the church is but ask where is the catholique church for that is the proper name of this holy church
vpon the other part as no heresies could ever be vniversal for time or place for he who has prescribed bounds to the sea has also ordain'd that no heresie can cover the earth so by the divine providence they could never obtain the title of catholique but were ever denominated from their authors as arians pelagians lutherans calvinists or from some accident as protestants for protesting against the emperours edicts

which sorts of names hierom affirmes to be evide~t marks of the synagogue of
neither indeed can any new sects with any

probability call themselvs catholiques
for what would be more ridiculous then if the independents or quakers who are of so late standing and of so litle extension would stile themselvs catholiques this word signifying vniversality both of time place which they evidently want the same may be as iustly said of the presbyterians or of any other protestant congregation
and if any of these sects were so vnwise as to call themselvs so they would not be vnderstood but taken for papists

remember that my catholique friend shew me that it has been an ordinary custom of those who separat themselv's from the catholique church when they see that they neither have the thing signifyed by the word catholique nor can obtain the title of it to shew themselvs enemies to both
this the old donatists did who pretended that it was not necessary

the true church should have communion of nations or be vniversal that truth is often among a few and that it was the fault of many to erre
this same some protestants do pretend
against which may be opposed the words of augustin

who saith as he shall be anathema or accursed who preacheth that neither christ suffered nor rose again because we learned by the gospel that it behoved christ to suffer and to rise again the third day so he shall also be anathema whosoever preacheth the church to be elswhere then in the communion of all nations because by the self same gospel

we learn in the words next following pennance to be preached in his name and remission of sins throughout all nations
then for the word catholique luther was so great an enemy to it that he tooke it out of the apostles creed putting the word christian in place of it
our presbyterians ordinarly abstain from the word catholique turning it vniversal

beza calls it the vain tearme catholique
a great apostle of the covenant shew both his envie anger at this word
for when a gentlema in the north who had been summoned not long ago to give an account of his faith before the presbytery of aberdeen had profest himself to be a catholique the said apostle was offended with that title and willed him to call himself a papist which he neglecting to do the min~ister the enquired of him if the women of his religion called themselvs catholiques also which question had such an vncivil sense as he proposed it that some of his more modest brethren sitting in iudgment with him shew both by their countenance and words their dislike of his vncivility
augustin relates how the donatists also were great enemies to the word catholique calling it a humane forgerie or fiction

which the holy father calls words of blasphemie

to conclude therefore this point
as it is evident both by the creed and by the scripture that the true church must be catholique so it's very clear certain that the protestant church before luther was not catholique that as yet it is not catholique and by all appearance

never will be
for according to the nature of heresie it gote all what it possesseth at the first hurle and these
years it hath made no progresse but rather by its own divisions hath gone backward and has been still on the loosing hand
therefore the protestant church not being catholique cannot be the true church
vpon the other part it is no lesse evident that of all christian societies the church in communion with the sea of rome was the catholique church in the time of the apostles as it was also in the time of augustin and of the holy fathers and ever since it has had the communion of nations kept all general councels made decrees condemned all errors heresies and in a word what the holy scriptures have so clearly of the vniversality of christs church and of the conversion of gentils from infidelity to christianity hath been accomplished in this church alone and performed by her members
therefore this church and no other is the holy catholique and true church of christ
chap
xxxv
the true church proved by her continued succession lawfull vocation of her pastors for which she is called apostolique

by this note or property of apostolique the holy fathers and auncient councels would have the true church clearly known and distinguished from all new sects heresies
the church is called apostolique principally for two reasons
first because it was founded by the apostles and from their time must continue vnto the end of the world
secondly because the pastors thereof derive their mission from the apostles by ordinary calling personal succession
in the first sense the true church is clearly distinguished from all sects and false churches because they were not founded by the apostles but by some new pretended reformers who arose after the apostles in their several generations and therefore these new churches founded and erected by them are not called apostolique but have their denomination from their founders such as the arians pelagians lutherans calvinists
in the second sense she is also clearly distinguished from false churches because they have not lawful pastors deriving their

vocation from the apostles by a continued and vninterrupted succession but intrude themselvs into the office of pastors without any lawfull calling
of the first sense of the word apostolique we have spoken sufficiently above when we proved the true church by her perpetuity and continued succession and disproved all false churches for want of it which proofes need not to be here repeated
of the second sense of the word apostolique we shall here briefly speak

besids the authority of the creed it is evident by the scriptures that there must be alwayes pastors in the church lawfully called to that charge
god saith by the prophet esay vpon thy walls ierusalem have appointed watchmen all the day and all the night
they shall not hold their peace for ever

the apostle paul sheweth how our saviour performed this promise by appoynting pastors and teachers to the consummation of the saints for the work of the ministerie for the edifying of the body of christ till we all meet in the vnity of faith
our saviour also has promised his continual assistance vnto the pastors of his church behold am with you always even vnto the consummation of the world
as there must be always pastors in the church so they must be lawfully called to that charge or else they are not pastors but theeves and robbers
paul saith no man takes vpon him that honour but he who is called of god as aaron
and again how shall they preach vnlesse they be

god in the old testament reproved those who went without mission saying had not sent these prophets yet they ran and prophesied falsly in my name
christ saith who entereth not by the doore into the but climbeth another way is a theef and a robber
moreover our saviour has put a strict obligation vpon all people to hear and obey their lawfull pastors and has forewarned them earnestly to beware of false prophets
of the first he saith who heares you heares me and who contemns you contemns me
and whosoever shall not receive you nor heare your words verily say vnto you it shal be more tolerable for the land of the sodomits gomorrhaeans in the day of iudgment then for that citie
of false teachers he saith beware that no man seduce you for many shall come in my name
and again take great heede of false prophets
paul to the like purpose forewarneth the ephesians saying take heede to your selvs know that after my departure there will ravening wolves enter in among yow
for the which cause be vigilant
seing then we know evidently by the scriptures that there must remain always true and lawfull pastors in the church and that false prophets will also arise that we are obliged vnder paine of damnation to heare the first and vnder no lesse danger to beware of the last it is most certain that the goodnesse of god who promised such a clear way vnder the gospel that fooles should not erre in it has ordaind an easy

sensible way for all men to discern between true false pastors that they may be preserved from error in so great danger or else only fooles but also wisemen might be miserably mistaken and misled to their own perdition

now the same scripture points out this easy and direct way if men would walk in it
for it shewes that all true pastors must have sensible vocation mission and these who want them cannot be true and lawful pastors first it's evident that our saviour did sensibly call
apostles and sent them with commission to feed govern his church
secondly the apostles did also sensibly call and ordain other pastors as is evident in the election ordination of mathias
thirdly the chief pastors that is bishops received also power from the apostles to choose and ordain others as is evident in what the scripture records of titus and timothee
this was so evident and sensible a way that fooles might not erre in it
and if this order was always observed that none could be esteem'd lawful pastors but who were thus called and ordain'd by others who had received that power then it was as easy to know a true pastor from a false apostle as it is easy to know who is called to be a iudge in the state from an vsurper for they are both discernable by easy and sensible signs
this is the doore of which our saviour speaks by which all these who are lawfull pastors enter into the government of

the church and all these who enter not by this doore and yet vsurp that honour to be pastors of the church are theevs who climb vp another way and so may be easily known
the auncient iewes had also an easy way to know their ordinary priests pastors from vsurpers for among them none were priests but these who were descended from levi by aaron by natural generation
but in the law of grace it is more easy where none are to be esteem'd bishops lawfull pastors but these who are descended from the holy apostles by visible ordination personal succession

the holy fathers did vse this succession and vocation of pastors as a most evident argument to demonstrat the true church and by want of these they discovered also as clearly all false churches
for it's certain the true church cannot be without lawfull pastors lawfull pastors cannot be without lawfull vocation ordination where there are no true pastors lawfully called and ordaind there can be no true church
ireneus proves the true church by the succession of pastors

which he calls a clear demonstration by which all heretiques are confounded
tertullian requires the heretiques to bring forth the origine of their churches to recite the order of their bishops

by succession from the apostles
as it is evident then that vocation succession of pastors by lawfull ordination is an inseparable propertie of the true church so we shall now briefly see to which church it best agrees

whither to the protestant or to the church in communion with the sea of rome

find that the protestant pastors are as much perplexed to show the lawfulnesse of their vocation after luther as they were vexed to show where their church was before him
for they run from one shift to another and what some say others controule severly censure
as there were three principal sorts of protestants to witt the lutherans calvinists these of the late english church so find they bring three different answers to the question of their ministers vocation
some say the lutherian ministers have an ordinary vocation because luther was made a priest in the roman church but this answer is frivolous
for first luther by that vocation got only commission to preach the doctrin of that church and not to preach against it
secondly it is monstruously absurd for the lutherians to derive their vocation from that church which their first apostle esteem'd
thirdly although luthers own vocation were supposed to be good how could he being only a simple priest ordain others since from the beginning of christianity it was never known that a priest could be ordaind by any but by a bishop fourthly luther succeeded to none neither bishop or priest who professed his doctrin and therefore the lutherans are in their first source destitute of succession and in their progresse of lawfull ordination and so neither luther

nor his successors have any lawfull vocation

calvin most of his schollers renounce the way of ordinary run to an extraordinary vocation for they are ashamed to derive their vocation from the roman church which they imagine to be neither can they do it because calvin was never ordain'd a priest
by the saith he of the pope the true line of ordination was interrupted now there is need of a new
and truly this was an extraordinary charge which the lord imposed on vs
to him accords his scholler beza who saith that at the beginning of their church ordinary vocation appear'd no where
and

in the conference at poysie being enquired of his vocation he said it was extraordinary
against this pretext of extraordinary vocation which is followed by all the puritians other protestants do sharply inveigh
saravia saith that it's a doctrine full of danger of a new and evil example and vpholden by no testimony of the scripture
diverse other protestants cited in the protestants apologie reiect this extraordinary vocation as fanatical and opening a way to all seducers who may make the same pretext
and now the presbyterians find by sad experience that the independents anabaptists and others make vse of it against themselvs

but that calvin and his followers had no extraordinary vocation may be easily shown
for vnto that there are two things requisite according to the examples recorded in the

scriptures
first that god speak sensibly vnto one whom he is to call extraordinarly as he did to moyses elias paul secondly that he make that appeare by some miracle
the first is not sufficient without the second to which may be ioynd a third condition to witt holynesse of life doctrin which becomes gods extraordinary ambassadours without which even their miracles ought to be suspected
now not only one but all these conditions were visibly deficient in calvin the other pretended reformers
for never any of them was so impudent as to say that god spake sensibly to them albeit luther confesseth that the devil conferred oftner then once with him

then they were so impote~t of working miracles that erasmus obiects to them they were never as yet able so much as to cure a lame horse
lastly their lives were not extraordinary for holynesse befitting an extraordinary vocation as we have seen above
luthers sentence against

makes also against calvin
if he pretend saith luther that he is sent by god as the apostles let him prove that by doing signes and miracles for where ever god will change the ordinary way there always he works miracles

lastly the late church of england pretended a succession lawfull vocation of her pastors

above all other protestants
for so mr mason praiseth and admireth the sweet and singular providence of god towards the new church of england that when other reformed church as were enforced through necessity to admit extraordinary

fathers or ordainers that is to receive ordination from inferiour ministers or priests yet the church of england had alwayes bishops who according to the ordinary and most secure custom of the church had conferred holy orders
but this pretence is also false and frivolous
for either the first protestant bishops in queen elizabeth time were ordaind by the catholique bishops or had their vocation from some others

as from the queen and parliament
the first cannot be said
for both sanderus and dr show that the catholique bishops choosed rather to die in prison as they did then to impose their hands vpon the queens new design'd protestant bishops
besids whitaker and fulk renounce the catholique ordination as vnlawfull albeit all the more late diuines of the english church had their recourse vnto it in so much that fulk expresseth himself very passionatly thus we with our whole heart renounce abhorre detest and spit at your filthie orders
so full of confusion are they in this matter that what some of their greatest divins esteem their greatest glory others no lesse famous among them think their greatest shame
moreover albeit the catholique bishops were granted to have imposed their hands on the first protestant bishops yet by that ordination they made them only catholique and not protestant bishops for the church in all reason and common sense cannot give a lawfull vocation to any pastors to

preach and act against her self
therefore if these first bishops of the late english church were protestants when they were ordain'd they were not lawfully ordaind and if they became thereafter protestants they lost all lawfull exercice of their power of ordination when they vsed it against that church from which they pretend to derive their lawfull vocation
lastly the first protestant bishops in king edward the sixth or queen elizabeths time succeeded to no other protestant bishops much lesse can they show their succession vnto the apostles as is requisite to make them lawfull and apostolical bishops
if it be said that the first protestant bishops were made by vertue of the king or queens supremacie and by act of parliament this is not the way prescryved in the scripture which has been always observed in the church
and if these english bishops pastors had no more sure ground for their vocation then the royal supremacy it is no wonder that they are both falne together and that one parliament has ransacted what others had enacted so we see that the late english church has been resolved into the same principles of which it was first composed as by the same iust iudgment the presbyterians who pretend an extraordinary vocation are almost subverted by the independents anabaptists vpon the same pretext

it rests that speak now a word of our scottish ministers vocation which found

as groundlesse and more ridiculous then any of the rest
for besids that the most part of them at the beginning were vnlettered men and had no other vocation to be ministers then that which the presbyterians blame now in the independents the vocation of xnox our great reformer seems very strange as it is described in his own chronicle
in one thing indeed he shew himself more scrupulous then luther for although he had been ordain'd a roman priest yet he thought not without reason that his popish orders gave him no lawfull vocation to be a protestant minister and therefore he expected another call which was given him after this manner
some discontented protestants having conspired together had cruelly kill'd

as a protestant author speaks cardinal beaton within his own house the castle of andrewes possessing themselvs of all the cardinals riches and thereafter kept out the castle in rebellion against the state
to this place of security knox had his refuge carying along with him some gentlemens children whom he instructed in the grammar and new catechisme

his book saith that when these within the castle perceived the manner of his doctrin they dealt earnestly with him to take vpon him the function of a preacher
but he refused alledging he would not run where god had not sent him meaning that he would do nothing without a lawfull calling
wherevpon they going to a private councel resolve or

give a charge publickly to knox by the mouth of their preacher iohn rough which was done at the next sermon as it is there at more length described
so by this means knox gote his vocation to be a minister from the call of that holy congregation which was guiltie of murder and robbery and was then in actual rebellion by the mouth of their preacher who could have no lawfull vocation himself but being an vnlettered man had taken vp by all appearance that calling at his own hand as many others did
for it is said of him in the
page
albeit he was not the most learned yet was his doctrin without corruption
was much astonished when this historie of our first reformer his vocation was first shown me in his own book by a catholique who did not faile to manifest the ridiculousnesse of it by all the circumstances

now these are all the different vocations of the protestant ministers and all and every one of them are so vnsufficient that they are disproved not only by catholiques but also by most famous protestants who are brought to such confusion in this matter that they hardly know what to say
for they can neither pretend ordinary nor extraordinary vocation not the first because they evidently want succession as also ordination both which are requisite to an ordinary calling
not the second because they want the power of working miracles and have no extraordinary holynesse which are qualities very requisite and vsual for

all gods extraordinary ambassadours
and albeit neither of these qualities were required yet these who pretend this extraordinary vocation do fall into such contradictions that they are evidently known thereby not to be gods extraordinary ambassadours whom he never vseth to send with contrary commissions so that to the protestant ministers or bishops agree well the words of cyprian
these are men saith he who without any divin disposition preferre themselvs among rash people who make themselvs prelats without any lawfull ordination who none giving to them a bishops office take the name of bishops vpon them
therefore the protestant pastors wanting clearly succession from the apostles are not apostolique and so are not true pastors but vsurpers and consequently the protestant church is not the true church for that cannot be the true church which hath no lawfull pastors

vpon the other part this succession of bishops from the apostles has been ever so evidently in the church of the roman communion that the holy fathers did bring it as a most evident argument to show the true church and therefore they reckon out ordinarly the succession of the roman bishops

augustin saith the succession of priests from the seat of peter the apostle vnto the present bishoprique holds me in the church
and elswhere shewing the continuance of the same succession he saith the continuance of the true church by

most certain succession of bishops doth persevere from the apostles time vnto ours and to the times after vs again
and this succession doth to this day continue in the roman church as evidently as it did in the time of the holy fathers neither can any thing be said now against it which might not have been said as iustly by the auncient heretiques
therefore as the church in communion with the sea of rome has been shewed to be one holy and catholique church so it is no lesse evident that it is apostolique having lawfull pastors as it has ever had deriving their vocation from the holy apostles by lawfull ordination personal succession and consequently this is the true church lawfull spouse of iesus christ

this matter of vocation is of great importance because doctrin depends vpon it and because it is easily discerned so that it is compared by our saviour

to a gate
as then it is more easy to hold a theef at the gate then to thrust him out being once let in so all heretiques are more easily confounded for lack of vocation which is to hold them at the doore of the church then by the falshood of their doctrin which is to expell them after they are once admitted
for if they cannot bring evident testimonies of their vocation ordination from a known pastor of the church they are presently known to be wolves who run when they were not sent who enter not by the doore but climb vp another way
therefore it is great deceit in some ministers

to vndertake to prove the lawfulnesse of their vocation by the truth of their doctrin which is a preposterous and ridiculous way
core and his complices taught no other doctrin but that which was taught by moyses and yet because they vsurped the priests office we know how fearfully they were punished
what would be more ridiculous then if one would vsurp the office of a iudge in the state and then would prove himself to be a lawfull iudge by the iustice of his decisions this question then of vocation being so important and easy a catholique gave me this advice which resolve god willing to follow never to admit a minister to dispute of religion till he first shew the lawfulnesse of his vocation and to make ever that the first question
wherefore having now seen such evidence for the truth of the roman catholique church to which alone the marks and properties of the true church recorded in scripture do so clearly agree will draw to an end by this subsequent conclusion
chap
xxxvi
the conclusion

as light is more pleasant after darknesse so is the invention of truth more delightfull after errors
have now by gods grace and by the former triall seen both our pretended

reformations which were called such great engyring lights to be nothing but thick aegyptian darknesse obscuring the chief and most clear truths of the christian religion both in doctrin disciplin
have now found amongst the protestants what augustin observed amongst the manichees

that they have nothing but a meer promise of truth a pretext of following only the scriptures whe indeed they follow their own errors that their doctrin is nothing but counterfeit mettall which cannot endure the fire of triall
yea have clearly seen that their church which is the ground work of all has not the least resemblance of the church of christ as she is without ambiguity described in the scriptures
for according to them the church of christ must endure for ever but the protestant church has only endured since the time of luther
according to the scriptures the church cannot be hid but must ever shine like a light set vpon a candlestick but the protestant church has lyen many hundred years hid and invisible vnder a bushell
the church of christ must have vnity as becomes the house of god but the protestant church is full of division confusion both in doctrin disciplin
the true church must be holy in all her doctrin and fruitfull in produceing saints but the protestant church teacheth doctrines which tend to prophanesse to the neglect of piety of all good works and she is so barren in produceing saints that

she professeth to bring forth none but those who continually or dayly break mortally gods commandments
the true church according to the scriptures must be catholique or vniversal and must convert all nations from infidelity to christianity but the protestant church is only in parts pettie corners of the earth and has never as yet converted any nation of infidels but according to the nature of heresy has only perverted some ill catholiques
the true church must ever have true pastors lawfully called and ordained deriving their succession by an vninterrupted line from the holy apostles but the protestant churches first pastors succeeded to none and without any lawfull vocation ordination did intrude themselves by vsurpation into the pastoral office as all their successors have done
the true church adheres so closly to the truth that she is called in the scriptures the pillar ground of truth

but the protestant church is so inconstant passing from one falshood into another that she may be called the pillar ground of error
the true church according to christs promise is ever directed by the spirit of truth into all truth but the protestant church is misgoverned by the spirit of giddinesse as is known by fresh experience
these considerations besides others make me see the great darknesse wherein lay and have made me to admire of my former blindnesse that reading so frequently the scriptures did not see

the monstrous difference which is between the church of christ there so clearly described and the protestant church to which not one propertie of the true church contain'd in the scriptures doth agree
this shew me how necessary it is to read the scriptures with attention and to implore the divine maiesty for spirituall illumination without which darknesse will seem light and light darknesse

but in the holy catholique church found not only promise but also perforformance of truth
found her faith to be more pretious then gold which is tried by the fire as peter speaks

which after greatest opposition and triall doth ever shine more brightly
found in this church clearly fulfilled all the prophesies and that to her do agree all the properties of the true church described in the scriptures
for this is the church which alone has endured since the time of the apostles
this is the church which as a citie seated on a hill could never be hid but as a candle set vpon a candlestick hath enlightned the whole world
this is the church which has been admirable for its vnity and eminent for its sanctity replenishing the heaven with innumerable saints who have all lived and died in the bosome of her communion
this is the church which is vniversal for time place which has had her gates continually open night and day to receive the strength of the gentils which she alone has

converted from infidelity to christianity
this is the church which has had a continued succession of pastors descending without interruption from the holy apostles
this is the church which adheres so closely to the faith she once received that she would never part from it nor yield in one syllabe or letter neither to heathnish cruelty nor to heretical impiety and which neither force nor flatterie could ever shake so that she may be iustly called the pillar ground of veritie
this church is the chast virgin spouse of christ which has been ever falsly accused as an adulteresse by all heretical strumpets and has been even overloaden with their calumnies but she has alwayes adhered vnto her heavenly spouse who in his own time has manifested her innocencie and brought confusion on her enemies and in a word this is the church which is admirable for its order and government for its supreme authority and invincible strength for its heavenly doctrin and great holynesse and lastly for her power of working miracles
what then can do more fitly then after so great darknesse to embrace so clear a light after so many dangerous errors and wandrings to put my self in the direct way of salvation and incorporat my self without delay into this one holy catholique apostolique church wherein all the holy fathers all the saints have liv'd and dyed what can vse more properly then the words of augustin who saith to this purpose since

we see so great help of god so great profit and fruite shall we make any doubt at all to retire vnto the bosome of that church which from the apostolique sea by succession of bishops has obtaind the soveraign authority heretiques in vain barking round about it
to which not to yield the primacy is either a matter of greatest impiety or of precipitat arrogancy
the same motives which held augustin within the catholique church have drawn me vnto it to witt

the consent of people and nations authority begun by miracles nourished by hope enlarged by charity and confirmed by antiquity the succession of priests from the seat of peter vnto the present bishoprick and last of all the very name catholique which not without cause this church has only obtaind among so many heresies

as then andrew and the woman of samaria were glad when they found the messias foretould by the prophets because they were sure to find with him all truth so am no lesse overioyed to have found the true church foretould and clearly described by the messias for with her am sure to find all truth since she is the pillar and ground of truth and christ has promised to her the spirit of truth to remain with her for ever to lead her into all truth
as the apostles believed christ for the voice of god the father who said this is my beloved son heare him so believe the church for the voice of god the son who said who heares you heares me and

who despiseth yow despiseth me

and who will not hear the church let him be to thee as a heathen a publican
and as the holy apostles did believe christ in all things because he received all from his father so believe the catholique church in all points because she has received all her doctrines from christ his apostles and has faithfully retaind them
this catholique church is she alone which

as an auncient father writeth retaines the true worship
this is the fountain of truth and house of faith
this is the temple of god into which if one do not enter or from which if one go astray he is a stranger from the hope of life and eternal salvation
here in this house of faith is found the the true catholique invariable faith of which augustin truly saith that no riches

no treasures no honors no substance of this world are comparable vnto it therefore in end will offer vp my thanksgiving vnto god in the words of that glorious doctor for the same benefite
truly lord thou art my god who hast drawn me out of darknesse and out of the shadow of death and thou hast called me into thy admirable light and behold see
thanks be given to thee thou who art the illuminator of my soule
looked back and saw the darknesse wherein had been and that profound black pitt wherein had lyen and was sore affraid and said wo wo be to that darknes wherein lay
wo wo be to that blindnes wherein was not able to see the light of heaven
wo wo to that former ignorance of mine when had no

knowledge of thee lord
but give thee thanks my illuminator and deliverer because thou hast illuminated me and have knowen thee
yet still am come too late to thee thou antient truth too late am come to know thee thou eternal truth
and because cannot praise thee sufficiently humbly desire the blessed virgin all the angels saints of heaven to blisse and magnify thy glorious name and to offer vp their holy prayers for me that as by thy grace have acquired the true faith so may also attayn vnto sincere piety and so may have the happinesse to praise thee in their holy society for all eternity

a litle of the scottish covenant
being desirous after the triall of presbytery to take a serious view of the late famous but now vnfortunat scottish covenant presbyteries principal chartour required the accustomed assistance of my above mentioned catholique friend which he willingly vouchsafed to me
wherevpon we had diverse conferences and he was also pleased to write some papers on this matter for my contentment out of which will make a brief collection of some principall observations whereby as by a little the covenant which glistered so much for a time and which was sold for the pure gold of divine truth may be seen to be nothing but base counterfeit mettall
section of the great esteem and high titles of the covenant and that it was vniustly called gods covenant
the respect which the covenanters gave to the covenant was so great that perhaps it may seem incredible vnto posterity
for they esteemd it as much as if god had sent it from heaven or had given expresse order for making it
they were not content to esteem it so much themselvs but they would have all persons within their power to do the same they were not satisfyed with mens simple profession to beleeve it but they enforced all persons to swear and subscribe it yea and to take their sacrament vpon it and were resolved by furious zeal to propagate it by force throughout the world
they gave it also high titles calling it ordinarily gods covenant or the covenant between god and the kirk of scotland the confession of faith the holy covenant
all which shew their great esteem of it

at the very first serious view and once reading over of the covenant we presently saw that it did not deserve these high titles and especially of gods covenant because it containd

some most grosse and palpable lies of which we observed three most obvious

the first is containd in the very first words of the covenant which begin thus
we all and every one of vs vnderwritten protest that after long and due examination of our own consciences in matters of true false religion where they professe to have vsed long due examination of their consciences before they swore and subscribed the covenant
now this is a falshood so manifest that men need not to examine their consciensces but only to recollect their senses and consider what their eys saw done to discover it
for when the covenant was subscrived at the beginning of the troubles anno
in the grayfriers church of edinburgh all the long examination then vsed was to heare it once read over accompanied with a panegyrick made by the lord lowdon and a prayer by henderson and immediatly thereafter all almost who were present ran contentiously to it
throughout the rest of the countrey the ministers commendation of it was made to serve for all the peoples long due examination and presently followed their subscription with an implicit faith vpon the ministers bare word which is no sure ground to relie vpon
the puritans ran to it every where with little knowledge and furious zeal that they might pull down the bishops and the old protestants being awakned by their false alarmes did swear and subscribe it inconfideratly that they

might oppose the entrance of popery which they were made beleeve to be at the doore
so that it is evident even to sense that few of the covenanters vsed any diligence most of them vsed none at all and none of them vsed long and due examination of their consciences but their subscriptions and oaths went before their knowledge and their knowledge before due trial and diligence
whereof this is an evident sign that as yet after
years agitation few of their chief heads know all the points abiured in the covenant as opus operatum works of supererogation stations and the like
therefore the first words of the covenant are manifestly false

the second grosse vntruth is a little after the middle of the covenant in these words
and seing many are stirred vp by satan and the roman to promise swear subscribe and for a time vse the holy sacraments of the kirk deceitfully against their own consciences minding thereby first under the external cloak ef religion to corrupt and subvert secretly gods true religion within the kirk and afterward when time may serve to become open enemies and persecutors of the same vnder vain hopes of the popes dispensation devised against gods word to his greater confusion and to their double condemnation in the day of the lord iesus here said the catholique are linked together diverse lies and not only lies but calumnies and both so evidently false impudent that the father of lies if he had any shame

might be ashamed of them
for what can be more false and malitious then to say that the pope stirres vp catholiques to swear and subscrybe the protestant to abiure the catholique religion against their consciences that he stirres them vp to vse the protestants sacraments and that of purpose to subvert their religion vnder hope of his dispensation first the catholique church hath ever constantly taught with paul that no evil is to be done

that good may come of it and therefore much lesse is the greatest of evils to be done such as is the renouncing of the catholique faith and swearing of a contrary religion against the light of a mans conscience
secondly she condemned the helchesits in the primitive times

as heretiques for affirming that it was lawfull to christians to deny christ externally in the time of torments persecution
thirdly the popes of whom the puritans think no sin to lie are so far from stirring vp catholiques to do the forsaid abominations that they earnestly dehort them from approaching to the least degree of such impiety
which to by other instances may be known by the breviat of pope paul the fift directed to the english catholiques in october
where he saith we have vnderstood that you are compelled by the threatnings of most grievous paines to go vnto the temples of heretiques to frequent their meetings to be present at their sermons truly we vndoubtedly beleeve that those who with so great constancy and courage

have suffered most fierce persecutions and almost infinit miseries will never trespasse so as to be defiled with the society of the desertors of the divine law
neverthelesse we being stirred vp by the zeal of our pastoral charge and out of the fatherly care we have of the salvation of your soules are forced to admonish and earnestly beseech you that by no means you would go vnto the temples of heretiques or heare their sermons or communicat with them in rites least you incurre the wrath of god
for it is not lawfull for you to do these things without the dammage of the divin worship and of your own salvation
if the pope dehorts so earnestly the catholiques from going to the heretiques temples how much more doth he dehort them from abiuring the catholique faith and from receiving the puritans sacraments if the pope only connived at such actions it would be a lie and calumnie great enough to say he stirred vp catholiques to do them
but it is a monstrous lie and calumnie to say he stirres vp men to do such abominations when he stirres them vp to the contrary
neither can the covenanters ever shew that any pope did otherwise since ever the protestant religion began
the catholiques beleeve that god has such a care of his church that it needs not by periuries dissimulations or any false wayes to be advanced and they know also that all hereticall churches need not by such vniust means to be by them subverted
for by their own divisions they are sufficient

to subvert themselvs as long experience hath shewed
lastly it is false that these catholiques who against their consciences renounce their religion do it vpon hopes of the popes dispensation for all catholiques know that the pope as he himself professeth cannot dispence in any thing that is intrinsecally evil and against the eternal law of god as that action is in the highest degree
all which may be known to moderate even by the confession of apostat catholiques
therefore these being so groundlesse lies and malitious calumnies the covenant did well to begin them with the father of lies for thus it speaks and seing many are stirred vp by satan the roman
but it had been no lie if the ministers had been yoaked with the devil in that work for they have concurred oftentimes with him to draw and force diverse catholiques to renounce their faith against their consciences as has been known by many late experiences since the covenant began

but it is strange to see famous protestants yea and the very same accusers guilty of the same crimes which they falsly lay to the charge of others which may be shewed by their own monuments
who is esteem'd a more famous protestant then queen elizabeth the foundresse of the late english church and yet she is taxed by knox for faigning her self to have been a papist for

bowing to idolatry and going to masse all the time of her sister queen maries reigne
it is known also how shortly after her sisters death she subverted all that in her lay the catholique religion albeit she sware to maintain it at her coronation
who gave her dispensation to vse such dissimulation in religion surely it was not the pope but rather she as head of her own church which is now also subverted did dispence with her self
it is yet fresh in all mens memorie how many of the puritans did swear obedience to their bishops and conformity to the late english churches orders and yet when time served they subverted both
who gave them dispensations for such hypocrisies and periuries that is one of their rare privileges that they all and every one of them by more then papal power can dispence with themselvs as becan shewes in a special treatise of their privileges

the third grosse vntruth of the covenant followeth in these words
we therefore willing to take away all suspicion of hypocrisy and of such double dealing with god and his kirk protest and call the searcher of all hearts to witnesse that our minds and hearts do fully agree with this our confession oath and subscription so that we are not moved for any worldly respect but are perswaded only in our consciences
as the the foundation was false so is this fabrique which is raised on it
for the most rigid covenanters know that many thowsand protestants were made to put their hands to the

covenant whose hearts were far from it and when they could shew both their hearts hands against it
and they were so far from being moved without worldly respects that for these only they were induced to take the covenant and so soone as these failed they abandoned it
by all which it is evident that this covenant which containes so many grosse lies and calumnies against very sense and experience cannot be the covenant of god who loves truth and hates lies
section ii
that the covenant is not a confession but a denyal of the faith
the covenant carieth this title in print
the national covenant or confession of faith
but it appeared very soon to vs not to deserve that title but rather that it ought to be called a confossion or denyal of the faith which it deny's not simply but with many horrible execrations and blasphemies

all heresies are of a malignant nature consisting in denyal of some points of the catholique faith but there are some which deny fewer and others more points of it
in the primitive times some heresies were cast out of the church for one word only against the faith but the covenant and presbyterian religion

deny almost al the points of the catholique faith
for they run through heaven earth the church triumphant and militant they leave neither god nor man the angels nor the saints the living nor the dead vntouched but they rob every one of them of some excellent privilege
for they spoile god of his goodnesse by making him the author of sin christ of his merits by denying he dyed for all and the holy trinity of glory
they spoile the angels and the saints of their felicity and of all respect and reverence from men they rob the church of the continual assistance of the holy ghost man of his the living of the prayers of the saints and the faithfull departed of the suffrages of the living
they rob the sacraments of grace and the commandments of obedience
yea what have they left vntouched in the church they have taken away many books of the scriptures almost all the sacraments all traditions priesthood sacrifice vowes set fasts festival dayes altars reliques holy images all monuments of piety all the antient ecclesiastical lawes all order and disciplin all comlinesse and beauty from the house of god
they have abolished the apostolique government denyed the apostles creed subverted the divine commandments and abiured all the evangelical counsels and many more points have they destroyed as we shall see in the progresse of the covenant so that never any heresy deserved more the title

of destroyer never any heretical confession of faith deserved so much the title of the negation of faith as the covenant
for never any heresy or negative confession denyed so many points of the catholique faith and so overturn'd the christian religion both in doctrin disciplin in all the monuments and helps of piety
as the matter of the covenant is very large containing so many points of the catholique faith which it deny's so the manner how it doth renounce them which is as it were the life and forme of the covenant is very considerable
for it doth not only deny these articles but it detests and abiures them yea and blasphemes them adding a blasphemous epithet almost to every point
for thus it speaks we renounce and detest the vsurped authority of the roman his wicked hierarchie his devilish masse blasphemous priesthood profane sacrifice bastard sacraments doubtsome faith desperat repentance

behold said the catholique to me what a rapsodie of lies and calumnies against manifest sense and experience against the ancient faith and true religion was fathered vpon god the author of truth and was called his covenant behold what a blasphemous negation of the faith was entitled the confession of faith behold what a monstrous idol of lies execrations blasphemies the covenanters did so highly honour reverence as if it had been gods vndoubted truth and not only did

idolatrize it themselv's but with furious zeal and rigour enforced others to adore it against their consciences cyptian affirmes that the devil in place of the old pagan idols has invented the deceits of errors heresies and hierom saith that all heretiques are idolaters adoring their own fictions and imaginatio as divin truths
according to this doctrine if the covenant containe heresies as we shall see it containes not a few the covenanters have been great idolaters
the old pagans did indeed adore false gods and the works of their own hands but never any carying the name chr stians did more idolatrize the fancies of their own braines then the covenanters have done
the prosperity of the covenant for a time did blind many but now the visitation which god has sent vpon it has opened the ey's of a great part so that the covenant which was before the obiect of their greatest reverence respect is now become the subiect of their laughter sport
the prophet ieremy foretells that these miseries should befalls to all idols
they are vain things

saith he and a work worthy to be laughed at in time of their visitation they shall perish
which words hierom applies excellently to heresies
who would not laugh saith he when he considers the idols of heretiques heresies prevaile only for a time that these who are chosen may be made manifest and be approved
but when the visitation of god comes and his eys do behold their fooleries then all are quyet

and it
and so now is the covenant silent and fallen asleep
but enough for our intended brevity of the false titles of the covenant and of the grosse vntruths in it against sense
we shall now run through the spiritual vntruths of it against faith
section iii
of the covenantes vain pretext of the word and spirit of god and of the marks by which they describe their
that this matter may proceed more clearly we shall set down in order the words of the covenant and then subioyn the observations we made vpon them
the preface then of it goes thus
covenant
wee all and every one of vs vnderwritten protest that after long due examination of our consciences in matters of true false religion
wee are now throughly resolved of the truth by the word spirit of god and therefore we beleeve with our hearts confesse with our mouths subscribe with our hands and constantly affirme before god the whole world that this only is the true christian faith and religion pleasing god and bringing salvation to man which now is by

tho mercy of god revealed to the world by the preaching of the blessed evangel and received beleeved and defended by many and sundry notable kirks realms but chiefly by the kirk of scotland the kings maiesty and the three estates of this realm as gods eternal truth and only ground of our salvation as more is confessed in the confession of our faith established and publickly confirmed by sundry acts of parliament and now of a long time hath been openly professed by the kings maiesty and whole body of this realm both in burgh and land
to the which confession and forme of religion we willingly agree in our consciences in all points as vnto gods vndoubted truth and verity grounded only vpon his written word

to passe by the first sensible vntruth about the long and due examination of their consciences which was lately touched they pretend next that they are fully perswaded of the truth of their religion by the word and spirit of god
but this is no new song neither is it only peculiar to them
all sects although never so monstrous which receiv'd the scriptures have made and do make the same pretexts and this they must all do or else they would get few followers
but that the covenanters make this pretext as falsly as any other sects is very evident
for first they falsly pretend to be perswaded of the truth of their religion by the word of god seing they beleeve diverse points as principal articles of their religion which are expresly against

the word of god
which may be shown by many instances but we shall be content with two or three
the covenanters beleeve as the principal article of their religion that man is iustifyed by faith only which is clearly against the word of god which saith in expresse tearmes man is not iustifyed by faith only

they beleeve that the commandments are impossible to be kept which is against the word of god which affirmeth that gods commandments are not grievous

and that zachary elizabeth did keep them
they beleeve that the eucharist is not the body and blood of iesus christ

which is directly against the scripture which affirmeth it is his body and blood and that with such words as design the true body true blood
therefore it is evident that they cannot be perswaded of the truth of their religion by the word of god seing the principal articles of their religion are so clearly against the word of god
yea before their religion can be true the most clear truth in all the scriptures must be false to witt the perpetuity of the church of christ
for their whole religion is founded vpon that supposition that the whole church of christ had become and had perished for a long time before luther then which nothing can be more against the word of god as we have seen above
neither have the covenanters any other refuge to shun these contradictions between their beleef and the scriptures but to fly vnto tropes figures and

pretend that these places of scripture must be vnderstood figuratively which is the very fraude that was vsed by the auncient heretiques
so soone

saith augustin as any error doth prepossesse their mynds they esteem all to be figures which the scripture saith to the contrary
yea they must bring senses iust contrary vnto the words of the scriptures as for example the scripture saith man is not iustifyed by faith only which according to their beleef must be vnderstood as if the scripture said man is iustifyed by faith only which it nowhere saith
therefore if men can be perswaded by the scripture to beleeve such things as are contrary to the expresse words of scripture the covenanters are perswaded by the scripture of the truth of their religion otherwise they are not but rather perswaded to the contrary

secondly they come as small speed of their pretext of the spirit of god
for first they can bring no more ground for it then all sects do that is their own bare words and therefore they ought not to be beleeved more then others
secondly they cannot be perswaded by the spirit of god who oppose the catholique church which according to christs promise is ever directed by the spirit of truth
iohn who adviseth vs wisely not to beleeve every spirit but to prove the spirits if they be of god gives this by which they may be tryed
he that knoweth god saith he knoweth vs and he that is not of god knoweth vs not
in this we know the spirit

of truth and of error
this same has held in all succeding generations
for these who would not beleeve the catholique church and the pastors thereof succeeding vnto the apostles although they bragged never so much of the spirit of god were instantly seen to be misled by the spirit of error and were condemned as heretiques who with insolent folly would appropriat the spirit of god vnto every one of their own giddie heads and yet deny it to the whole catholique church against the clear scriptures the same holds against calvin his descendents the presbyterian covenanters
thirdly they cannot have the spirit of god which is the spirit of vnity who have mingled among them the spirit of giddinesse and contrariety by which their erroneous spirit is discovered now even to the most simple among the people
lastly the covenanters falsly pretend that they are fully perswaded of the truth of their religion
for if they had full assurance of it they would not make so many changes in it and besides their director is very vnconstant for what is more changeable then the privat spirit

having seen now said the catholique the covenanters vain false pretence of the word and spirit of god we will briefly run through the description of their religion and to spare paines of often repeating their names we will turn our speech to them
first you say that your faith religion is the only true faith

religion pleasing god and bringing salvation to man
if this were true the world for many ages had been in a pittifull condition
for about the space of a thowsand or
hundred yeares your faith religion were not known and so all that time there had been no means of salvation
by which device you not only controule the clear scriptures but also show your selvs enemies to the glory of christ to the riches of his grace and to the perpetuity of his kingdome yea and to the very good of man
and lastly you oppose most famous protestants who acknowledge salvation was had in the roman church before luther and may be had now after him in so much that king iames in his speech to the parlament
sharply censures you for this cruel opinion
we confes saith he that many papists especially our ancestors may be saved and often are saved detesting in this parte and iudging worthy of fire the cruelty of puritans who yeeld salvation to no papist
secondly you describe your religion further saying that it is now reveald to the world by the preaching of the evangel
but that is rather a mark of the false then of the true religion
for the true christian faith was reveald of old by christ his holy apostles and from that time could never be hid but your presbyterian faith has iust two contrary qualities to witt it is now reveal'd and has lyen long hid
vincentius lyrinensis sheweth the nature of your faith by describing the doctrine of the auncient heretiques

what do they propose saith he but new and vnheard doctrines
for you shall heare some of them say
come you vnwise miserable men who are commonly called catholiques learn the true faith which besides vs none knoweth which has lyen hidd many ages but now is lately revealed and manifested
neither doth it a white availe you that you call your faith the gospel and the revealing of your faith the preaching of the gospel
for so all heretiques call their greatest errors the gospel of christ
hierom saith wisely that the gospel of god by a false interpretation becames the evangel of man or which is the evangel of the devil
so there still remaines a great question about the truth of your preaching which is nothing but your privat interpretation
thirdly to make your faith more commendable you pretend that it is both auncient vniversal
you pretend vniversality when you say that your faith is beleeved received and defended by many notable kirks and realmes but chiefly by the kirk of scotland
next you lay claime to a certain kind of antiquity when you say that it hath been of a long time openly professed
such is the evidence of truth that enemies to it are sometimes enforced to make vse or rather a shew of it

but to speak first of the vniversality of your faith where are all these many notable realmes and kirks which you affirm do professe your religion in europe no such kingdomes can be found
for swedland denmark are

known to be lutherians who have neither vnity of faith with you nor communion in sacraments and abhorre the very name of calvin of all sacramentaries
the realme late church of england maintaind the hierarchy of the church abhorring very much the anarchy of your presbytery and now since england became a commonwealth it hates nothing more then the as it is commonly called there of your presbytery
the other famous kingdomes of europe are either totally or for the much greater part roman catholiques so that the many notable realmes of your religion are as yet invisible vnlesse you would count all those to be of your religion who are not papists or who go vnder the general name of protestants
but that cannot be done for the vniversality of a church requires vnity in faith communion in sacraments which you evidently want with a great part of protestant churches
and therefore knowing that you want this vnity you wisely pretend that this faith which you so much praise is chiefly professed by the kirk of scotland
for every one of you pretends to be chief and will not yeeld to another

then yow come as little speed of your antiquitie
for all the long time that your faith was profest from the beginning of your reformation to the first making of the covenant is but about
years and as yet to this day it has not past the bounds of one age
if you had the vniversality antiquity of the catholique

church how would you glory when you make such a stirre with your fewnesse and novelty for your one kingdome and your one hundred years in which your religion has been professed we can show you the same kingdome professing the catholique religion above
hundred years and all the famous christian kingdomes and countries of the world making the same profession even to the first time of their conversion from infidelity to christianity
and for your one king mentioned in your covenant which he took in his younger years disproveing it when he became more ripe as appears in the conference at we can show you
kings of the same nation diverse of which are glorious saints in heaven who lived and dyed in the catholique profession to whom we may add all the famous christian kings emperours that have been in the world

but albeit you were more spread then you are you would find no great advantage by it augustin compareing you with good reason to smoake

which doth vanish so much the sooner by how much it is greater more dilated abroad
this we have seen verifyed in our time
for the late church of england intending to dilate her self in scotland did shortly thereafter vanish like smoake in england
again the scottish presbytery indeavouring with great zeal to propagate it self in england lost soone much of its fyrie

force in scotland
secondly antiquity of your religion would tend no lesse to your ruine for as hierom hath observed all heresies please only men for a time and when they grow old they weare out of request as may be known by the many alterations of religion that have happened in scotland but especially in england since their publique fall from the catholique religion
then for acts of parlament whereby you say your faith is confirmed they cannot be very many seing the religion is so late neither can they give great confirmation to a religion because they are very changeable
we see one protestant parliament has ransacted the kings which many protestant parliaments had enacted and that which was before declared heresy if not treason to deny is now iudged both great follie and treason to affirme
the true religion is warranted by a higher authority then by earthly courts but the protestant religions are made and vnmade by protestant parliaments

the last point here proposed containes three vntruths linked together as where you say that you all willingly agree in all points all the horologes of the world will sooner agree then your wills
when coercive power is now taken out of your hands you see how many do willingly freely disagree from you
then you call all the points of your faith gods vndoubted truth which they cannot be besides other reasons because many protestants doubt

of diverse of them yea they think them vndoubted falshoods and besides yourselves are often changeing them which shewes that many articles of your faith are doubtsome and your faith of them is nothing but meer opinion

lastly it is most false that all your faith is grounded only vpon the written word because you beleeve some things without the word of god as the changeing of the sabboth into sunday the baptizing of infants and which is more you beleeve some points against the expresse word of god as your article of iustification by faith only to speak nothing of diverse others
and moreover you lay down a false ground when you professe to beleeve nothing

but what is containd in the scriptures whereas they expresly bid you hold fast the traditions
thus we have seen all your pretences as about the word spirit of god the vniversality antiquity of your faith by which you would make it more commendable to be false groundlesse
now we shall see how bitterly you renounce accurse the catholique faith
section iv
of the popes supremacy where it is shewed that the pope is not nor an vsurper as the covenanters do calumniate
after the former preface follow these words of the covenant
and therefore we abhorre and detest all contrary religion doctrin but chiefly all kind of papistry in generall and particular heads even as they are now damned confuted by the word of god and kirk of scotland
but in special we detest and refuse the vsurped authority of the roman anti christ vpon the scriptures of god vpon the kirk the civil magistrate and consciences of men

here you ingenuously confesse your selves to have one quality which all heretiques have ever had to hate and detest most the catholique religion
and your practice sheweth this your confession to be true
for albeit any person become a socinian anabaptist or atheist you take no great notice of him but if you heare of any that is become a papist he is sure to get no more rest
next as you falsly pretended your faith to be contain'd in the word of god so now as groundlesly you

pretend the catholique faith to be condemned by the same word which as yet you could never make good in any one point
it is true indeed that the catholique church is condemned by the church of scotland but it is as true that the church of scotland is condemned by the catholique church which is of far greater authority and which has iudged condemned all former heresies and triumphed over them

now followes your dismall song with your abiurations detestations of the faith order disciplin of the catholique church and first you strick at the visible head and governour of it vnder christ whom you call detesting his authority which you call vsurped
the principal reason for which you beleeve this strange article of your faith to witt that the pope is is because he claimes primacy over other bishops and extends his care over the whole church which he affirmes to be committed to his charge as vnto peters successor
if your reason were good then peter himself had been the first for both the scriptures and fathers show that he received from christ the primacy over the other apostles and that the care of the whole church was entrusted to him
mathew shewes that peter was the first of the apostles
the names saith he of the apostles are these the first who is called peter
now peter was not first in calling but in preeminence
for as ambrose saith

in
cor
andrew first followed our saviour before peter and yet the primacy andrew received not but peter
the same is showed by the change of his name which christ promised in the
of iohn and thereafter performed

in mathew where he said thou art peter or a rock and vpon this rock will build my church
and will give vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heaven
this change of the name of simon into peter foretold by christ and thereafter performed by him is not without great mystery and these excellent privileges which our saviour promised to him of the keyes of the kingdome of heaven of binding and loosing do show that he was particularly to grace and advance him above others which he performed after his resurrection when he said to him feed my sheep feed my lambs giving him thereby the charge of his whole flock

the same supremacy of peter may be showed by many other preeminences recorded in scripture as how christ prayed particularly for him that his faith might not faile and payed tribut for him but for brevities sake they are omitted

now we shall briefly see how the holy fathers vnderstood these scriptures
gregory the great saith it is manifest to all persons who know the gospell that from our lords own mouth the re of the whole church was to peter the prince of the apostles for to

for what end saith he did christ shed his blood

but that he might purchase these sheep the care of which he committed to peter and his successors
augustin calls peter the head of the apostles the of heaven and the foundation of the church
cyprian saith we hold peter the head and roote of the church
and in a word all the holy fathers affirm the same
they do likwise acknowledge that the bishops of rome are peter successors in that supreame authority
athanasius writing to pope liberius saith for this cause the vniversal church is committed to you by our lord iesus that you should labour for all men
and again writing to pope felix he saith thou art peter and vpon thy foundation the pillars of the church that is the bishops are fortified
augustin saith in the church the principality of the apostolique chair did ever flourish
and elswhere number the priests from the sea of peter and in that order of fathers see who succeeded to another
this is the rock which the proud gates of hell do not overcome
to which we shall only add the testimony of bernard who writes thus to eugenius
thou art he to whom the keies of heaven are delivered and to whom the sheep are committed there be other porters of heaven other pastor of flocks but thou st erited in more glorious and different sort for they have every their particular but to thee all span missing

of all the pastors themselvs
but thou wilt ask me how prove that even by our lords word
for to whom of all say not only bishops but apostles were the sheep so absolutely and without limitation committed if thou lovest me peter feed my sheep
he saith not the people of this kingdome or that citie but my sheep without all distinction
so bernard
by which authorities testimonies both of the scriptures and fathers you see what solid ground the popes authority hath that it was confer'd by christ on peter and that it has been acknowledged by the holy fathers christian world in the bishops of rome his successors
therefore you very rashly have reiected this authority which has been established confirmed by christs special providence vnto this day but more wickedly do you call it an vsurped tyranny and beleeve the pope for vindicating and exercising the same authority to be the great whereas you ought to acknowledge him to be the vicar of christ
these who honour reverence the authority of the bishops of rome of the apostolique sea follow the example of all the holy fathers and auncient good christians but these who now a dayes endeavour to dishonour and revile them have the heretiques for their predecessors who never caried to them
augustin shewes that the donatists called the apostolique sea the chair of pestilence but that is nothing to the epithets of the covenanting ministers
who

in railings and blasphemies all that ever spoke when they fall vpon this point making thereby the simple people beleeve that article of their faith that the pope is
but the holy fathers tooke it for an vndoubted mark that these who did not acknowledge the popes authority and were not of his communion belonged not to christ but to
hierom writing to damasus saith who gathereth not with thee scattereth that is who it not christs is

having now seen that the pope whom the covenanters call malitiously is the vicar of christ it remaines evident that his authority is lawfull not vsurped
for he who is a iust possessor is no vsurper
yea he has been so far from vsurping over the scriptures the church that he has chiefly preserved them from the vsurpations and corruptions of heretiques
and first it is shewed that he doth not vsurp over the scriptures as the covenanters do calumniate for he neither vsurps over the letter nor the sense of them
not the first
for both the pope whole catholique church professe that they only declare that to be scripture which they received for such from the holy apostles and it's by their care diligence that the letter of the scripture has descended pure free from corruptions vnto our hands whereas it might have been altogether corrupted or totally perished for protestants
neither do

the pope or catholique church vsurp over the sense of the scriptures but they preserve that sense which is conforme to the vanimous consent of the auncient fathers of the primitive church
secondly the pope doth not vsurp over the church because the care and charge of it was committed by christ to peter and to his successors as we have seen and he preserves the church from the vsurpation of heretiques
thirdly he doth not vsurp over the civil magistrate
the experience of many ages in all christians kingdomes is more then sufficient to make this good to manifest the impudent falshood of the presbyterian calumnie to the contrary
fourthly the pope doth not vsurp over the consciences of men but as chief governor of the church has lawfull authority to make ecclesiastical lawes which bind in conscience as also all the iust lawes of kings other civil magistrats do bind in conscience to which their subiects ought to obey according to that of paul be subiect not only for wrath but also for conscience sake

and the contrary doctrin of protestants which affirmeth that neither the lawes of church kings or other magistrates do bind in conscience is much detested by the catholique church and opens a broad way to all disobedience

but now it will not be amisse to show how yow are destitute of all lawfull authority and deeply guilty of the same vsurpations which yow falsly impose on others
first all

heretiques who go out of the church and having no lawfull calling or authority take vpon them to be pastors and impose their new doctrines lawes vpon the church are truly vsurpers and are called theeves by our saviour who enter not by the doore but climb vp another way
so optatus speaks to the donatists how comes it to passe

saith he that you who are fighting against the chair of peter by your presumptions and sacrilegious boldnesse contend to vsurp the keies of the kingdome to your selves
thus luther calvin the two chief
apostles of protestants were vsurpers who being private men without any lawfull calling or authority would bring in new doctrines and prescribe lawes to the whole catholique church
and in this the covenanting ministers do imitate them
secondly they vsurped in particular over both the letter and sense of the scriptures
for luther added the word only to them in the matter of iustification and tooke the whole epistle of iames and the apocalypse from them
calvin also by his private spirit made vp a new canon not known before his time expunging many bookes avnciently received out of the scriptures which new rule the covenanters follow
then for the sense they transgressed the bounds set by the fathers reiecting the auncient sense preserved by the catholique church and invented new senses of their own imaginations which they enforced vpon others as divine truths
in

this also you covenanting ministers have followed closely their footsteps
for you have been no lesse fertile in inventing such new senses then active in enforceing them vpon others
thirdly your pretended reformers were vsurpers over the church who having no lawfull calling nor authority tooke vpon them to be reformers of the church who would impose their own fancies as lawes divine oracles on the church who insolently· would take vpon them to iudge and condemn the whole catholique church and who vnder pretext of reformation have destroyed almost all that is sacred· in the church barbarously destroying many excellent churches and sacrilegiously vsurping and plundering the riches ornaments of them
this luther and calvin did at the beginning and this you have compleated in a great measure above all their progenie
fourthly you are also very guilty of vsurpation over the civil magistrate
the late riseing of your religion cannot furnish vs old histories but for your short time you have been prettie bussie and afford vs a good store
for in our countrey there have been only
or
princes since your religion began and none of them has been exempt from your vsurpation
first the queen regent was deposed by you from her regency and died shortly thereafter for grief
secondly how you vsed her daughter queen mary stewart it is notoriously known to the world for after you

had imprisonned her enforced her to renounce her crowne you never desisted till by persecuting of her vnto death you made her purchase a more glorious crown and yet by your calumnies after her death augment her glory in heaven
thirdly

how you vsurped over king iames her son he himself hath registred to your no small infamy
and albeit you did not prevaile against him yet you have payed home that deficiency with vsury to his son the late king charles
by this may be seen whither the pope or yow do vsurp more over the civil magistrate
lastly you have been great vsurpers over mens consciences as may be known to passe by all other instances by your furious vrgeing this same covenant vpon many protestants against their consciences for which they give you the title of
by all which may be seen that you are very guilty of the same vsurpations which you falsly obiect to others
section that the lawes of the catholique church are not tyrannous nor her doctrin concerning the scriptures and office of christ erroneous
after you have renounced the popes authority as vnlawfull then yow renounce his lawes as tyrannous and the doctrin of the catholique church concerning the scriptures the office of christ as erroneous
for thus you speak in your covenant we detest all his tyrannous lawes made vpon indifferent things against our christian libertie
his erroneous doctrin against the sufficiency of the written word the perfection of the law the office of christ and his blessed evangel

if you renounce all lawes made vpon indifferent things pretending that they are against your christian libertie then you renounce the most part of all lawes both civil and ecclesiastical which are ordinarly vpon such matters and in a certain manner restrain libertie
then you may renounce also the lawes of the apostles

for they made some vpon indifferent things as to abstaine from things strangled and from blood giving them out in the name of the holy ghost and commanding them to be kept by the first christians

which lawes albeit they restrain'd libertie yet they were not against christian libertie which co~sists principally in three things to witt in freedome from the slavery of sin in freedome from the fear servitude of the moral law by receiving the gift of charity through christs grace whereby we willingly and the law and lastly in freedome from the bondage of the iewish ceremonial law which peter calls a heavie yoak
these are the liberties wherewith christ has made vs free as was shown me at more length and are not as the covenanters do imagine a libertie to do what every man lists or to be vnder no obedience of spiritual or temporal lawes
against which licentious libertie peter gives warning in these words be subiect vnto every humane creature for god

as free and not as having freedome for a cloke of malice
and paul to the galatians you are called brethren into libertie only make not this libertie an occasion to the flesh
now all the lawes of the catholique church against which the ministers make heaviest complaints as about lentfasting abstinence from flesh on frydayes the single life of church men and the like may be easily shown to have been observed in the primitive times to be most iust nowayes tyrannous or against our christian libertie but that they rather tend vnto christian perfection which is the greatest libertie of a christian and that the ministers who speak so much against these holy

lawes make their libertie as paul speaks an occasion to the flesh or as peter saith a cloke of malice
but it would indeed seem very strange if it were not so ordinary among you that yourselves do such things without all authority which you blame in the catholique church vnto which christ has given so great authority
for have not you dureing the space of some few years heaped vp more lawes and decrees in your assemblies then exceed all the body of the canon law and yet you cannot deny but the most part of these lawes is made vpon indifferent things and some of them in the iudgment of many protestants vpon false things as your lawes for swearing subscribing the covenant
you pretend much christian libertie which you promised to the people but indeed you kept them in more then iewish slaverie
for to passe by many other instances you would not suffer the people vpon sundayes after they had been much wearied hearing both your long some sermons prayers to be seen on the streets or to go and recreat themselves in the fields which truly was greater then a iudaïcal servitude
the catholiques find the yoak of christ sweet and the lawes of his church their loving mother not heavie
but many protestants find the yoak of your presbytery which they esteem a cruel to be very bitter and think your lawes not only against their christian libertie but also insupportable

now we come to your other heavy accusations against the catholique church which for brevities sake we must only touch
yow accuse her doctrin as erroneous against the sufficiency of the written word
but without all reason
for she teacheth that the written word is sufficient in this sense that it containes immediatly the substance of our faith all the articles necessary necessitate medij for mans salvation and also it containes mediatly all that we are to beleeve in that it remits vs to the church which it assureth vs is governed by the holy ghost in all truth whence it evidently followeth that we draw that truth out of the scriptures which we draw out of the mouth of the church for whosoever deputes an other to speak for him speaks mediatly by his mouth
so augustin reasoneth albeit saith he we can produce no example of scripture concerning this matter yet hold we the truth of the same scripture seing we do that which is conformable to the vniversal church which the authority of the same scripture commends vnto vs
and in this sense the written word is most sufficient
but it is not sufficient in the common sense of heretiques who will have the dead letter of the scripture to be sufficient without having recourse to the catholique church for the true sense of it and who will have nothing to be beleeved but what is formally expresly containd in it
for that is directly against the scriptures themselvs which referre vs to the church and bid vs stand fast and

hold the traditions that is also against the doctrin of the auncient fathers
chrysostome saith it is evident that the apostles did not deliver all things by writing but many things without and those be as worthy credit as the others
epiphanius saith to the same purpose we must vse traditions for the scriptures have not all things
that is contrary to the practice of the covenanters who beleeve somethings without scripture and diverse points against it as we have seen above

and lastly it has furnished weapons to the socinians and anabaptists to fight against the presbyterians who now by experience are become more wise then at the beginning
for in their new confession of faith at westminster

they say that the whole counsel of god concerning all things necessary to salvation is either expresly set down in scripture or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from scripture
so that the scripture which was before sufficient without church and traditions is now not sufficient to salvation without logique and consequences which doctrin makes them fall into another grosse folly to quite the church the pillar and ground of truth and have recourse to philosophie and fallible consequences wherein these new sects are not behind with them but by the same principle do vndermine them

you next accuse the catholique church of erroneous doctrin against the perfection of the law the office of christ and of his evangel but

you do not make good your accusations neither show yow wherein these pretended errors do consist
yet it may be easily shown that your accusations are false and that your selves are guilty of the same crimes
for the catholique church teacheth that the law of christ is most perfect and that the very substance of perfection consists in keeping it and that none can be perfect without fulfilling it
and albeit it be true that she teacheth there be some evangelical counsels which make a man more perfect then the precise keeping of the law yet that doctrin is nothing against the perfection of the law
for this was the doctrin of christ of paul and of the holy fathers
our saviour having said to the young man in the gospel
if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments and receiving answer that he had kept them all adioynd if thou wilt be perfect sell that thou hast and give it to the poore
paul also saith who maries doth well but who maries not doth better
augustin vpon our saviours former words saith our good master distinguished the commandments of the law from this more excellent perfection for there he said if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments and here if thou wilt be perfect sell all
by which it may appeare that the doctrin of the catholique church in this matter being the same that christ his blessed apostle the holy fathers taught is not against the perfection of the law
and the same may be made good also by the light

of reason
for every thing is perfect when it has perfection in its own degre and so the catholique church teacheth that the law of christ is most perfect in the nature of a law that no law can be more perfect and that perfection consists essentially in keeping it
which nowayes hinders but that there may be some works not commanded but counseled which may be prefer'd in perfection to some works commanded and so some counsels may be called more perfect then the commandments which are about the same matter
as for example it is more perfect to sell all for the love of god which is only a counsel then not to steal which is a precept as it is also more perfect to keep chastity then to marie and not commit adulterie
again there are some counsels more perfect then any of the commandments not in regard of the external work but of the internal charity which they presuppose and to which they lead
for it presupposeth a greater degree of perfection charity to renounce all riches pleasures which are otherwise lawfull for the love of god then to equal and prefer nothing to god which is commanded
therefore as the catholique church is free of erroneous doctrin against the perfection of the law so we may iustly inferre that your doctrin which teacheth the law is impossible to be kept is most erroneous against the very end and perfection of the law since it was made for that end to be kept and it robs men

also of all perfection which cannot be had without keeping the law

then for your other accusations about the office of christ the evangel albeit you strive by such words to affright the people making them beleeve that the pope the catholique church are sworn enemies to christ his gospel yet it is well enough known that christ and his gospel are more honoured in the catholique church then among all the sects of the world
for it is by her means the gospel has been preserved and christs name has been honoured among all nations all which she alone has converted to the faith
but you are enemies to all christs offices
for you would destroy his kirgly office by making him a king many hundred years without a kingdome and by destroying the spirituel governement thereof bringing in place of it the anarchy confusion of your pressbytery
you are enemies also to his priestly office by abolishing the dayly sacrifice for the continuance of which he is called a priest for ever after the order of melchisedech
you are enemies likwise to his prophetical office for whereas he had prophesied so clearly of the perpetuity of his church that it cannot be hid that it should be ever governed by the spirit of truth into all truth you would make him a false prophet by teaching that the church had failed had been many hundred years invisible and was fallen into errors
lastly albeit you pretend to honour the

gospel and make it the only rule of your faith yet you do iust the contrary because you deny what it affirmes and beleeve the contrary to what it teacheth in expresse tearmes and you make it such a rule that you frequently oppose your iudgments to it as has been more then once shown
section vi
that the doctrine of the catholique church concerning original sin iustification and sanctification is not corrupted but that the prebyterian doctrine is corrupted in all these points
covenant
we detest his corrupted doctrine concerning original sin our natural inhability and rebellion to gods law our iustification by faith only our imperfect sanctification obedience to the law

as it is ordinary for all those who are tainted with corrupt errors to call these catholiques doctrines corrupted which oppose their corruptions
so the covenanters here call the catholique doctrine concerning original sin corrupted which indeed is most pure and the most poysoned source of almost all their corruptions
the catholique church teacheth principally three things in this matter against the errors of the calvinists

first that all children as well of faithfull as of infidel parents descending from adam by natural generation do contract original sin and are borne in it which is against a corrupt doctrin of calvin who affirmeth that the children of the faithfull are borne saints
secondly the catholiques teach that original sin is quite taken away and purged in the sacrament of baptisme which is against an other corruption of calvin and his followers who affirme that original sin still remaineth in vs even after baptisme
thirdly the catholique doctors ordinarly teach that original sin is nothing else but a privation of original iustice or iustifying grace which was in the superior part of the soule which is restored to vs by the merits of christ in the sacrament of baptisme which is against a most corrupt error of all calvinists who affirme that original sin is nothing else but concupiscence or a pravitie of nature by which the image of god is vtterly defaced in man and by which adam his posterity became enemies to god slaves to sathan servants to sin
so do our scottish ministers speak in their first confession article
of the first two points something hath been said above and they are both evidently true by the scriptures fathers
for the apostle paul saith that all sin in adam and were borne the children of wrath

augustin affirmeth that holy parents do not beget regenerated children which is seconded by hierom who saith christiani non nascuntur sed fiunt
we are

not borne but made christians
and that baptism taketh away original sin has been so clearly above shewed that nothing shall be here repeated except only what augustin said none except an infidel can deny it
the third point also was fully cleared to me by the catholique who shew that as all sin is evil evil is nothing else but the privation of good so original sin being evil can be nothing else but the privation of some good and that can be of no other good but of original iustice
and as original iustice albeit it comprehended many supernatural perfections both in the soule body consisted principally properly in that iustifying grace by which the soule was adorned and vnited vnto god the soveraign good so original sin is the privation only of that iustifying grace in the superiour part of the soule the want of which makes the soule deformed and averted from god
and seing this want is taken away by baptisme and the whole grace as it beautifyed the soule is entirly restored the whole guilt of original sin is taken away and the whole essence of original iustice is recovered again by the merits of christ
then for concupiscence which is left after baptisme it is not truly any sin but a weaknesse imperfection of nature proceeding from the former original sin as all sicknesses miseries and death it self are
all which are left in vs even after the sin it self is taken away to put vs in mind from what happy estate we had fallen and to stirre vs vp to labour

more diligently and to call more earnestly for the help of gods grace
neither is the grace which we receive from christ the smaller or weaker that it doth not take away concupiscence and restore vs to the whole rectitude which adam enieyed but it is rather more strong since many by it do stand even with all that weaknesse of nature which adam did not with all the grace he had even in the strength rectitude of his nature
all which things were confirmed to me by diverse authorities reasons which were too longsome here to insert
it shall be sufficient to bring one testimony of augustin against calvins opinion and the fundament of it
concupiscence

saith he is called sin because it was made by sin whereas now in the regenerate it is not sin yea he sheweth that concupiscence is so far from being sin when it is resisted that it becomes rather the matter of victory and of a crown vnto vs sometimes saith he reason doth stoutly resist bridle concupiscence even when it is stirred vp which when it is performed we fall not into sin but after some wrestlings we are crowned
calvin ingenuously confesseth that his opinion in this matter is against augustin all antiquity which is sufficient to make it to be suspected if not also reiected

as then the catholique doctrine concerning original sin is the same holy pure doctrine of the primitive church so your doctrine covenanters is full of corruptions
for besides that it corrupts the catholique

faith it corrupts both your soules bodies
this your selves do confesse for in your new confession you say that man by original sin became wholly defilled in all the faculties parts of soule body and that this corruption of nature dureing this life doth remain in those who are regenerated and that both it self and the motions of it are truly properly sin
moreover it corrupts all your best thoughts words and actions
for so you professe that by it you are vtterly indisposed disabled and made opposite to all good and wholly inclined to all evil
this also calvin did teach

saying the vitiousnesse of original sin which remaines in vs defiles before god what ever works proceed from vs of which doctrin shelford a protestant gives his opinion thus these who say so cannot in my iudgment be excused from extream blasphemie
thirdly it corrupts grace for it makes the grace of christ so weak and imperfect that it cannot free vs from the corruption of original sin
and lastly it is the source of many corrupt errors as of your iustification by faith only the impossibility of keeping gods commandments the denyall of all good works of inherent iustice many more
from which it is evident that your doctrine is very much corrupted which is the cause of so many corruptions

hence also may be easily seen that the catholique doctrin concerning our natural inhability and rebellion to gods law is not corrupted because as it teacheth against the pelagians

that we are vnable by the power of nature to keep gods law so it affirmeth also against the presbyterians what is impossible to be done by nature is possible by gods grace and what we cannot do of our selves we can performe by the strength of him who comforts vs which might be easily shown to be pauls doctrine

and therefore to be free of corruption
but your doctrine is very corrupt which so grants a natural inhability that it denys all supernatural ability even with the assistance of gods grace to keep his law
you professe yourselves to be so naturally rebels to god that all his grace cannot make you good subiects which shewes that both your doctrin your selves are very much corrupted
the same may be shewed of sanctification
for the catholiques teach that no man is so perfectly holy here in this pilgrinage but he may every day advance in holynesse and be renewed dayly in the inward man and that no person even the holyest is free of venial sins imperfections and then only we shall be perfect when this corruption shall put on immortality
in this sense they grant that sanctification in this life is imperfect whereas in an other sense they teach that there may be even in this life a certain perfection of holynesse in some degree svitable to the observation of the divine commandments as has been shewed above chap

but your doctrin is very corrupt which maks your sanctification so imperfect that you cannot by

it think so much as a good thought or do any thing but sin mortally
and your obedience to the law is so imperfect that you break it at every minut so that such sanctification may be rather called profanation and such imperfect obedience to gods law may be iustly tearmed disobedience
lastly if the catholique doctrin which affirmeth that man is not iustifyed by faith only be corrupted then the scripture is corrupted which teacheth the same not only in substance but in expresse words proving it by diverse arguments examples and comparcing those who beleeve the contrary to devils as we have seen above chap
pag
but your doctrin in this principal article of your faith is very much corrupted which corrupteth the pure fountain of gods word
by all which may be seen not only how falsly you accuse the catholique doctrin of corruptions in all the former points but also how truly your own doctrin is full of corruptions
section vii
of the holy sacraments of ceremonies divorces and of dispensations
next follow these words of the covenant
we detest his corrupted doctrine concerning the nature number and vse of the holy sacraments
his five bastard sacraments with all his rites ceremonies and false doctrines added to the ministration of the true sacraments without the word of god his cruel iudgment against infants departing without the sacraments his absolute necessitie of baptisme his blasphemous opinion of transubstantiation or real presence of christs body in the elements and receiving of the same by the wicked or bodies of men his dispensations of solemn oaths periuries and degrees of mariage forbidden by the word his cruelty against the innocent divorced

as an impudent strumpet said my catholique friend is accustomed when she contends with a chast matrone to obiect such crimes to her whereof herself is notoriously guilty so here the covenanters do accuse the holy catholique church the immaculate spouse of of errors corruptions in the nature number vse of the holy sacraments whereas themselves are miserably corrupted

in all these points
which shall be briefly shown
first you accuse the catholique church of corrupted doctrin concerning the nature of the sacraments which must be because she teacheth that the sacraments of the new law do conferre grace
but we have seen above that this is most true doctrin conforme to the scriptures and holy fathers and that this is a perfection most suitable to the excellency of the christian sacraments
whereas your doctrine which robs the sacraments of all power to conferre grace and makes them only simple tokens signs and seals without all efficacie and which equals the sacraments of the old law in excellency vnto them corrupts indeed the nature of the christian sacraments and abaseth the power of them which cannot be done without perverting and corrupting the scriptures and holy fathers which are so clear for the catholique doctrine that they have moved many famous protestants to abandon your calvinistical opinion
all which may be seen in the
chapter of the former treatise

next you accuse the catholique doctrine of corruption concerning the number of the christian sacraments whereas indeed your doctrine if we will iudge of it by your first reformers is not only full of corruption but also of confusion in this matter
the catholiques do constantly teach that there be
sacraments of the law of grace instituted by

to witt baptisme confirmation eucharist penance order and matrimony
which precise number hath from the ancient fathers primitive church by continual practice been delivered and received in both churches greek and latin as may appeare by the councel of florence
for all which sacraments the catholiques do bring expresse scriptures testimonies of the holy fathers some of which we shal briefly touch
to speak then nothing of baptisme and the eucharist which are out of question confirmation is shewed
cor
and verse where it is said he that vs with you in christ and hath anointed vs god who also hath fealed vs and given the pledge of the spirit in our hearts
and acts
verse
when philip the deacon had converted samaria peter and iohn were sent to confirme them who when they were come saith the scripture prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost
then did they impose their hands vpon them and they received the holy ghost
of which augustin saith the sacrament of chrisme in the kind of visible seales is sacred and holy even as baptisme it self

penance is shewed iohn
verse
where our saviour said to his apostles receive you the holy ghost whose sins you forgive they are forgiven and whose sins you retain they are retain'd
of this power which christ has given to priests followeth the necessity of confession
for if the sins retaynd on earth be retayn'd

and not remitted in heaven and on the other part the priest cannot remit the sin vnlesse he know it as it is manifest he cannot nor can he know it vnlesse it be told him it followeth necessarly that he who will have his sins remitted must by his own confession open them to whom god hath given power to remit them
confession was also vsed in the apostles times

as appeareth in the acts where it is said many of them that beleeved came confessing and declareing their deeds
of this sacrament ambrose giveth testimonie

who refelleth thus the novatians
why do ye baptize if sins cannot be remitted by a man for in baptism is the remission of all sins nor is it material whether priests challenge to themselvs this power by penance or by baptisme
chrysostom saith that christ has given that power to priests which he would not to be given neither to angels nor archangels
the earthly princes have also power to bind but the bodies only but the bond of priests toucheth the very soule it self and reacheth even to the heavens what power beseech you can be greater then this augustin also speaketh to the same purpose in his
homily and in the second book of visitation of the sick

of holy orders the scripture beareth testimonie
paul writing to timothee saith impose hands on no man lightly
tim

and again neglect not the grace that is in thee which is given thee by prophesie with the imposition of the hands of priesthood
our saviour

said to his apostles receive the holy ghost iohn
augustin calleth holy order a sacrament compareing it with baptisme
let them explicate saith he how the sacrament of the baptized cannot be lost and the sacrament of one ordained can

extream vnction is clearly in scripture
is any man sick among you saith iames let him bring in the priests of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oyle in the name of our lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick man and our lord will lift him vp and if he be in sins his sins shall be forgiven him
vpon which chrysostom saith the priests have authority to forgive sins not only when they regenerate vs but afterwards also
for is any sick among you saith the apostle let him bring in the priests

of matrimony it is said they shall be two in one flesh this is a great sacrament but say in christ and the church
ephes

vpon which augustin saith that which in christ and the church is a great sacrament this in all men and wives whatsoever is the least sacrament but notwithstanding an inseparable sacrament of coniunction
and again in the church not only the bond but also the sacrament of marriage is commended

by which few testimonies these
sacraments which you reiect are as clearly proved out of the scripture as these two which you admit
yea although they had not been mentioned in the scripture yet they are all with

reverence to be received seing they are demonstrated by divine tradition which is of no lesse infallible authority then the scripture it self as has been proved above and this tradition is evident both by the consent of the holy fathers and by the constant beleef practice of the whole church which has vsed these sacraments in all ages according to the ends for which they were instituted
and thefore the catholique doctrine concerning the number of the sacraments which flowes from such pure fountains is pure true not corrupted as you do calumniate
whereas indeed your doctrine and that of your first reformers in this matter is not only full of corruption but also of confusion
for luthers followers admit three sacraments to witt baptism eucharist penance as may be seen in their catechismes
zuinglius receives also three but not all the same for in place of penance he puts matrimonie
and calvin reckons also three for to baptism the supper

he adds order
so full of confusion even at the beginning were these builders of babylon following neither scriptures nor fathers but their own fancies
wherein you are not behind with them swarving from the doctrin of your master calvin and according to your own imaginations admitting only
sacraments which two also in effect you destroy by robbing them of all vertue and efficacy as has been shewed above chap
in fine
you accuse next the catholique church of corruptions concerning the vse of the sacraments
but it is sufficient against your accusations that these vses of the sacraments which you most blame as private baptism private communion are known to have been observed by the holy primitive church are in themselvs laudable and tend much to the devotion comfort of the faithfull and are also approved by diverse learned moderate protestants
whereas your doctrines practises make your sacraments altogether gracelesse and almost vselesse and comfortlesse for which you are blamed by diverse protestants

moreover you are enemies also to the very ceremonies with which the sacraments are administrated in the catholique church
it is not sufficient for you to have taken away the fruite of grace from these heavenly trees planted by god in the garden of his church as in a heavenly paradise vnlesse you pull away also the ceremonies which serve as leaves and ornaments to them
you detest all ceremonies not contain'd in the word of god by which you lay down a most false deceitfull principle as if no ceremonies were to be vsed which were not expresly there
for first the scriptures containes not expresly all doctrines but referres vs to the church and to traditions as we have seen above
how much lesse then doth it contain all ceremonies secondly as our saviour when he did

institute the sacraments did not prescribe the particular forme by which they should be celebrated but left that to the wisdome of his apostles so his apostles did not set down that manner in writing augustin expresly affirmes the first part

saying christ did not command in what order thereafter the sacrament should be taken that he might leave that place to the apostles by whom hs was to order his church
the second part is also evident
for we never read where paul who writing to the corinthians concerning the holy eucharist said the rest will dispose when come did expresse that manner or order in the scripture
and the same may be said of the other apostles
thirdly some rites and ceremonies vsed by christ himself recorded in scripture were changed by the holy apostles according to the instinct of the holy ghost for the greater honour of the blessed sacrament and have been from the apostles times observed throughout the whole church without scripture

this augustin doth testify
neither saith he because christ gave the sacrament after meat ought we having dyn'd or sup't assemble to receive that sacrament or as these whom the apostle reproves and corrects mingle it with their tables
for it seem'd good to the holy ghost that for the honour of so great a sacrament our lords body before all other meat should first enter into the mouth of a christian and therefore this custom is observed throughout the whole world
fourthly the church can

institute ceremonies for greater decency and order and for the more honour of god
for if iacob a private man vsed a new ceremonie by erecting a stone by powring oyle vpon it and giving it the title of bethel

if the synagogue of the iewes made a new feast by the advice of mardocheus

why not also shall the church of christ have the same authority if such was the power of a private man and of the handmaid how much more ought the power be of the the holy church the immaculate spouse of or what can be more ridiculous and profane then to grant that power to these and deny it to this
or to think that the catholique church which is governed by the holy ghost in all truth according to christs promise should not have so much wisdom as to ordain aright some few ceremonies

therefore your former principle is very false for many reasons yea it is so false that yourselves doe not observe it
for where have you scripture for the godfathers which you require at baptism where have you scripture for taking your communion fasting from the hands of one another not from the hands of your minister and for many such rites customes besides your stoole of repentance when did your ministers observe that ceremony of washing the feet of others which was vsed by christ

before the celebration of the eucharist when did either they or their elders anoint the sick

according to iames precept
whereby it is evident that you observe some rites which are not contain'd in the scriptures and others you neglect which are there particularly recommended

as then it is clear that the church of christ may vse ceremonies which are not expressed in scripture so these ceremonies which she observeth are most commendable because they are most auncient and were vsed in the primitive times as coccius shewes by the testimonies of the holy fathers they are most observeable because they were instituted by the holy apostles and pastors of the church who had both authority and wisdom to institute those which are most convenient and lastly they have been confirmed by the long practice of the whole church against whose custome to dispute as augustin affirmes is most insolent madnesse
therefore without or rather against all reason do you detest the ceremonies of the catholique church
no religion can be without ceremonies and we see in the scripture that all great mysteries are accompanyed with sublime significative ceremonies as our saviours nativity baptism transfiguration resurrection ascension the descent of the holy ghost
our saviour also at all great solemn actions vsed many ceremonies as at the raising of lazarus the cureing of the man who was both deaf dumb mark
and vpon many other occasions all which ceremonies serve as ornaments

of religion presenting an external maiesty to the senses and making the spiritual mysteries to be more clearly vnderstood to be received with greater reverence and to be more deeply imprinted in the hearts of the beholders
the same might be easily verifyed of the catholique ceremonies
therefore you who vnder pretext of spirituality are profest enemies to all ceremonies do not take heed that you take all order decency from the church service of god that you oppose the practice of christ his apostles and of the whole primitive church and do render the sublime mysteries of the christian religion contemptible
you renounce also to vse your words the popes
bastard sacraments
but that is only proper to adulteresse churches to have bastard sacraments
the catholique church has none but lawfull sacraments instituted by her heavenly spouse of admirable vertue grace as we have seen all these to be
but indeed you have made even those two which you keep bastard sacraments by robbing them of all vertue and grace

we shall only speak a word of your other detestations which follow in this section because some of them have been touched above
first vnder the name of the pope you detest the iudgment of the catholique church as cruel against infants dying without baptism and for the absolute necessity of baptism
but this was also the iudgment of the

primitive church yea of christ himself who has said vnlesse one be borne again of water the spirit he shall not enter into the kingdome of heaven
and therefore is not cruel as has been shewed above at more length
whereas your iudgment is both false and cruel against many children dying with baptism excluding them from heaven
yea not only your iudgment is cruel but also your practice suffering many children to dye without baptisme

for which cruelty king iames affirmed that your ministers who were guilty of it would be damned
you accuse next the catholique church of blasphemy for beleeving the reall presence or transubstantiation which you wisely make all one question and for teaching that the wicked receive the body of christ
but they are not blasphemous who do beleeve christs words expressed by
evangelists and one apostle and who follow the constant doctrin of the holy fathers of the auncient church as the catholiques do in this matter as has been shewed above

and if the wicked did not receive the body of christ how could they be guilty of it as the apostles affirmes the vnworthy receivers of it to be but you are rather guilty of blasphemy even in the iudgment of protestants who will not beleeve christs clear words and deny thereby his omnipotency
luther your first apostles gives this iudgment of you we censure as heretiques aliens from the church

of god the zuinglians all sacramentaries who deny the body blood of christ to be received with the carnal mouth in the eucharist
and a famous doctor of his church continues the same opinion of you for speaking of this same matter he saith the sect of the calvinists is grown to such blasphemy and madnesse that they dare call in question gods omnipotency

then you accuse the pope catholique church for dispensations in solemn oaths and periuries
but these are either vain or false allegations
for it is certain that the church may dispense sometimes with the bond of oaths as she may loose from punishments and free men from the bonds of sins according to that power which christ gave to her saying whatsoever thou shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
but it must be for a iust cause and without the iust preiudice of others as becan shewes

or else the dispensation is not valid
periuries or false oaths need no dispensations as you mistake or calumniate but must be only taken away by true repentance as other sins are purged
it is strange that you should deny the lawfull power of dispensing to the whole catholique church such as paul vsed with the incestuous corinthian and yet appropriate it to every one of your selves and should obiect that falsly as a crime to others whereof yourselves are so deeply guilty
for it is known how many oaths vowes your first reformers did either break or dispense with at their own hands and if

we will beleeve king iames

you are not behind with any in these enormities

you accuse also falsly the pope catholique church for dispensing in degrees of mariage forbidden by the word of god that is by the law of christ vnlesse you will have the ceremonial law of the iewes to be the law of christ and to oblige all christians whence it would follow that if a man died without issue

his brother should marie the widow which yourselves do not observe but deny that it ought to be done
the church is so far from dispensing in degrees forbidden by the eternal law of god that she has made lawes forbidding dissolving mariages in degrees not prohibited by the eternal law of god which serve as to guard the divin law
she dispenseth indeed sometimes vpon good reason in her own lawes but never in the eternal law of god which she professeth to be altogether indispensable

neither is the pope and catholique church guilty of cruelty against the innocent divorced by forbidding them to marie vnlesse christ himself and paul be cruel and the primitive church which taught the same doctrine

our saviour saith every one that putteth away his wife and marieth another committeth adulterie and he that marieth her committeth adulterie

paul saith not give commandment but our lord that the wife depart not from her husband if she depart to remaine vnmaried or to be reconciled to her husband

whence it is clear that neither of the parties can marie so long as the other lives
this was the doctrine of the holy fathers and of the ancient church
augustin proveth this in his bookes de adulterinis coniugijs

and elswhere he saith it's lawfull for the cause of fornication to put away an adulteresse wife but dure ng her life it is not lawfull to marie another
these are adulteries not mariages
is augustin contemned let christ be feared
two ancient councels do also confirme the same doctrine therefore

the catholique church in denying mariage to the innocent partie divorced is not cruel as you calumniate but observes the iust law of christ the commandment of the apostle and the practice of the holy ancient church
and if any think it hard they have a remedie prescribed by the apostle to reconcile themselves to the guilty partie
but indeed you are cruel who vnder pretext of mercy do allow men to violate the iust law of god and vnder the name of mariages authorize people to commit adulteries to the destruction of their soules
so that it is truly verifyed of you that your mercies are cruel
but let vs proceed now to your other abiurations
section viii
of the christian sacrifice and of priesthood
after you had robbed christians of almost all the sacraments and of our saviours legacie to witt his precious body now you would rob the church of the christian sacrifice and would spoyle god of the greatest external honour that can be rendred to him is due to him alone
and with the sacrifice you would also destroy the sacred order of priesthood by which it is offered for you renounce them in these most virulent tearmes of your covenant
we detest his devilish masse his blasphemous priesthood his profane sacrifice for the sins of the dead and the quick
as never any religion neither vnder the law of nature nor vnder the law of moyses wanted sacrifice which is a supm worship due to god alone so the chrisn religion which excells all religions have been is not destitute of that perfecn but hath a most excellent sacrifice far exceeding all the ancient sacrifices
the prophets did foretell of it christ did institute it the holy apostles their successors did offer it and the whole christian world hath in all ages frequented it which points we shall briefly touch

the prophet david speaking of christ saith the lord has sworne thou art a priest for ever according to the order of melchisedech which words have relation to these of moyses melchisedech king of salem brought forth bread and wine for he was priest of the most high god
the holy fathers vnderstand that prophesie of the christian sacrifice of christs body blood vnder the formes of bread wine
so cyprian who is more priest

saith he of the most high god then our lord who offered a sacrifice to god his father and offered the same which melchisedech had offered that is bread wine to witt his own body blood
augustin also to the same purpose saith no where now is the priesthood sacrifice according to the order of aaron and every where vnder christ the priest is offered vp that which melchisedech brought forth when he blessed abraham
and again speaking of melchisedechs sacrifice he saith there did first appeare the sacrifice which is now offered vp to god by christians in the whole world

the second prophesie is in malachie where god saith to the iewes have no pleasure in you neither will accept any offering at your hands
for from the riseing of the sun to the going down of the same my name shall be great among the gentils and there is offered sacrificed to my name in every place a pure oblation
the holy fathers vnderstood this as a most clear prophesie of the christian sacrifice
so ireneus among the
prophets saith he

malachie did so of it
have no pleasure in most clearly signifying by these words that the first people should leave off to offer vnto god and in every place a sacrifice and that pure be offered vnto him
so also augustin did vnderstand it
malachie saith he prophesying of the chvrch which we see now propagated saith most vnto the iewes in the person of god
have no pleasure in you since then we see the sacrifice by the priesthood of christ according to the order of melchisedech offered vp in every place and they cannot deny but the sacrifice of the iewes is ceased why do they yet look for another christ seing that which they read prophesied and see fulfilled could not be accomplished but by him if this prophesie be so strong against the iewes it is no lesse forcible against the covenanters

as the prophets foretould so christ fulfilled by instituting this sacrifice by offering it vp himself and by ordaining it to be offered vp vnto the end of the world
this he performed when taking bread he blessed it saying this is my body which is given for you and after the same manner of the chalice
he ordaind the same oblation to be continued when he said to his apostles do this in remembrance of me
so the holy fathers expresly teach
ireneus who lived in the second age speaking of christs words of institution saith christ taught the new oblation of the new testament which the church receiving from the apostles offereth vp to god throughout the whole

world
cyprian affirmeth clearly the same truth saying our lord god is the high priest of god the father
he offered vp himself a sacrifice to his father and the same he commanded to be done in his remembrance
to which two we shall only adioyn augustin who saith christ did institute the sacrifice of his body blood according to the order of melchisedech
and last of all may be added the practice of the whole christian world which in all ages from the death of christ did render vnto god supreme honour worship testifying his soveraignity power of life death by this most excellent sacrifice of christs body blood which the holy fathers called the sacrifice of the masse the vertue also of which god has manifested by many miracles one of which will recount out of augustin to our purpose

which is briefly thus
the house of a certain tribune in the countrey near to hippo the city of augustins residence being vexed with evil spirits to the great losse of his cattel and affliction of his servants he came and desired that one of our priests saith the holy father being then absent would goe and pray that the devil might be chased away
wherevpon one went and offered vp saith he there the sacrifice of the body blood of christ to the end that the vexation might cease and by gods mercy it did cease immediatly

as therefore it is evident by what has been briefly said from the scriptures holy fathers

that there is nothing more holy divine in the whole christian religion then the christian sacrifice of christs pretious body blood vnder the formes of bread wine which was foretould by the prophets instituted and offered vp by christ himself and was thereafter offered vp by the holy apostles and their successors so you very wickedly call it devilish for that cannot be devilish which was ordain'd by god himself and whereby he is most honoured that cannot be devilish which chaseth away devils
but your railing against it and abolishing it must be devilish because the devil by his principal instrument the great is to abolish it in the later dayes
daniel
and luther your first reformer

by a strange divine providence did confesse to the world that the devil did stirre him vp by many arguments to abrogat it
and as the sacrifice is most holy divine so is the office of priesthood by which it is offered most sacred and venerable
if the aaronical priesthood whereby only bullocks and beasts were sacrificed to god was so sacred how much more sacred excellent must be the christian priesthood according to the order of melchisedech by which the body blood of christ are offered vp vnto god a pure oblation and therefore you very wickedly call the office of priesthood blasphemous and by dishonouring it you dishonour god himself who did institute it as ignatius the disciple of the apostles affirmes when he saith that

priesthood is the top of all honours that are amongst men which if any man dishonoureth he dishonours god our lord the alone chief priest of god by nature
your ministerial office is rather blasphemous against god which robs him of his supreme worship by sacrifice which has been given vnto him since the creation

that the christian sacrifice is offered vp for sins our saviour shewes when he saith this is my blood which is shed for many to the remission of sins
and that it is profitable also for remission of sins to the faithfull departed the holy fathers do teach by the scriptures and practice of the whole church

augustin saith we read in the books of the machabees of sacrifice offered for the dead but though it were no where read in the old testament yet not smal is the authority of the vniuersal church which shines in this custome where the commendation of the dead hath its place in the prayers of the priest which are powred out to our lord god at his altar

and in his ninth book of confessions he tells vs his mother monica desired on her that memory should be made of her at the altar from whence she knew the holy sacrifice to be dispensed wherewith the indictment against vs was blotted out
where you may see also the saints call that a holy sacrifice which you call profane
section ix
of the canonization of saints invocation of angels and saints worshiping of images reliques and crosses dedicating of churches altars now follow these words of the covenant we detest his canonization of men calling vpon angels or saints departed worshiping of images reliques crosses dedicating of kirks altars dayes and vowes to creatures

we shall now for brevities sake run speedily through all the rest of the covenant
first you blame here the catholique church for a most laudable custome which she has ever observed of canonizing that is declareing some persons who had been eminent for holynesse to be glorifyed saints in heaven
there have been indeed different wayes by which this canonization has been performed
for sometimes it was done by the voice of the people with consent of their prelats or by the prelats the people not controuling but since the year
none have been canonized but by the sea apostolique according to the decree of pope leo the third whence it is that this action is performed with greater diligence and more exact trial both of life

miracles then when it was done in a popular manner
what then can you iustly blame here but indeed you are to be blamed who canonize in your own manner not saints but sinners that break mortaly every day gods commandments and such was your covenanting army which you ordinarly called the army of the saints

you passe next from detesting the catholiques canonizing of saints to detest the invocation both of angels saints but indeed you cannot detest that vnlesse you detest also the scriptures the practice of the saints of the whole primitive church
for did not iacob invocat an angel when blessing iosephs children he said the angel which delivered me from all evil blisse these children doth not the prophet osee testify the same saying
iacob prevailed agrinst the angel he wept prayed to him did not also abraham lot gedeon pray to angels as may be seen recorded in the scriptures genes

iudges
therefore in detesting the invocation of angels you detest the scriptures practice of the saints
the same may be also said of the invocation of saints departed
for if it be lawfull to invocat the angels why not also the saints of heaven whom our saviour affirmes to be equal vnto the angels luke
yea if it be lawfull to invocat saints and sinners living vpon earth and to desire the assistance of their prayers why is it not lawfull to invocat the saints raigning in heaven

and desire them to pray for vs to say that they do not hear our prayers and know not what is done here below which may concern them

is most false for our saviour sheweth that there is ioy among the angels of heaven at the conversion of a sinner
therefore they must know it
and shall the angels know such things and reioyce at them and the glorifyed saints who are of our own nature be altogether ignorant of them and have no with vs shall some saints living here on earth know the secrets of others hearts know what is done at a distance as is recorded in scripture of samuel in relation to king saul
kings
and of elizeus in regard of his man giezi
kings to passe by other instances of daniel peter shall say these saints have such knowledge in their exile here on earth and shall the glorifyed saints in their countrey in the presence fruition of god be ignorant of such things and so be in a worse condition no that cannot be for that could not stand with the goodnesse of god happinesse of their estate
yea does not iohn expresly deliver that the saints in heaven do not only know our prayers

but also offer them vp to god when he saith that the foure beasts and the foure and twentie elders fel before the lambe having every one harpes and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the saints lastly what was the doctrin practice of the primitive church may be known briefly by the testimonies of the

two great lights ambrose augustin
the first saith we must pray to the angels who are given to be our defenders we must pray to the martyrs
for they are able to pray for our sins who have washed away their own
the other having invocated the blessed virgin and many angels saints by name concludes saying beseech you interceed for me a sinner vnto god that may be delivered from the iawes of the devil and everlasting death
so you may see how vnreasonably you detest so holy a doctrine so profitable a practice which has been vsed by the greatest saints
now we are come to that point to witt the worshiping of images wherein you pretend great advantage
for first you give out that the catholique doctrin practice in this matter is directly against the scriptures and particularly against the second commandment
secondly you affirm with great clamours that the catholiques prevarication is so evident here that to conceale the matter from the people they have taken away the second commandment
and for this cause especially you accuse the catholiques and condemn them for sacrilegious idolaters
but all these were shown me to be vain pretences

for first it is clear in the old testament that the ancient synagogue of the iewes had their holy images and that by gods own appointment
secondly that they did also reverence and honour them with competent worship
the first part is evident exodus
where god

said to moyses two cherubins of beaton gold shalt thou make on both sides of the oracle
moyses did obey this command chap
moreover king salomon did adorne the famous temple of ierusalem with diverse pictures
kings

to speak nothing of the brasen serpent which god gave order to make
behold here the commandment of god for making placeing of holy images in the tabernacle vpon the ark notwithstanding the iewes were most prone to idolatrie
and that these images were also honoured by the auncient people of the iewes is evident
for the cherubins were the chief part and ornament of the ark and the whole ark was honoured as may appeare first because it was put in the holy of holys as in a most honorable place heb
secondly it was translated with great honour to the house of obededom
thirdly it was only lawfull to the priests levits to carie it

kings
fourthly the philistims were punished with diverse plagues because they kept it beside themselvs without due honour and vpon the contrary obededom was blissed for keeping it honorably in his house

kings
and
yea god himself comma~ded by the mouth of david

saying adorato scabellum pedum eius
adore his footstoole
this is vnderstood of the ark as appeares by davids words

chron


and what ever it be it is not god and yet the iewes were commanded to adore it now can any man of solid iugment and consideration think that

god did prohibite all images and veneration of them by that which the protestants call the second commandment to witt thou shalt not make any graven idol and yet immediatly thereafter should command moyses to make images and to hold them in such veneration or rather is it not evident that the protestants do apply very falsly what is spoken in scripture against idols to the holy images of christ his saints therefore it is evident that the iewes had not only holy images by gods appointment which were set in their tabernacle temple and most holy places but also that they did lawfully and religiously worship and honour them albeit with an honour infinitly inferiour to that which is due to god

and as the iewes had their holy images so with as good if not more reason had the auncient christians theirs which they placed in their oratories and reverenced with due honour chrysostom saith in his liturgy the priest bowes his head vnto the image of christ

basil affirmeth that the honour of the image is referred to the exemplar
many more testimonies were shown me from the fathers and ecclesiastical histories but for brevities sake forbear to cite the as also it was shewed

that these who were enemies to the holy images of christ his saints were condemned by the auncient church as most furious heretiques called the iconaclasts who concur'd in this impiety against christ his saints with the profest enemies of christ as iulian the apostat the

perfidious iewes mahumetans destroying where euer they could the images of christ his saints against whom god by many miracles has manifested the truth as he did once against the iewes by making aboundance of blood to flow from our saviours image which they had pierced crucifyed in the citie of berytum in syria
by which miracle by the miraculous cure of the sick who were anointed with that blood the whole multitude of iewes in that place was converted

as athanasius testifyeth
by which it is evident to passe by diverse other miracles recorded in ecclesiastical histories that holy pictures are capable of dishonour and therefore also of competent honour that catholiques by keeping them giving due reverence vnto them follow the practice of the ancient christians and tradition of the apostles as basil testifyeth

saying honour the histories of the saints images and openly adore them
for this being delivered by the holy apostles is not to be forbidden but in all our churches we erect their histories
and it is no lesse evident that you covenanting ministers who furiously break deface all holy pictures crosses do thereby dishonour christ his saints go against the practice of the ancient christians follow the example of furious heretiques of other profest enemies of christ
you without all reason detest the catholiques worshiping of images but you ought rather to detest your own profaneing of them which indeed many

protestants do detest

hence may be easily discovered the vanity of all your former pretensions as first when you say that images are forbidden to be made worshiped by that which you call the second commandment
for there are only forbidden idols and all divine worship to any creatures but not the holy images of christ his saints nor a competent worship due vnto them
did not god himself in the same book command the holy images of cherubins to be made and due veneration to be given vnto them adore you his
is god contrary to himself or will he command idolatry secondly you falsly alleadge that the catholiques take away the second commandment whereby you deceive many for they make only that a part of the first commandment which you make the second and therein they follow the authority of augustin who expresly saith that more conveniently three precepts of the first table are to be reckoned then foure and that these words thou shalt not make any idol are indeed an explication of the former
which division of the commandments was also shown to me to be most agreeable to right reason
thirdly you falsly calumniate the catholiques for idolaters seing they do not worship holy images as gods with divine worship but with a respect infinitly below that like vnto the honour which the people of god gave vnto the arke and the cherubins and which is given by all good

christians to the letters of the holy scriptures
but indeed all these accusations which you bring falsly against others may be iustly retorted against your selves for though you adore no idols made with hands yet you adore many errors fancies of your own braines which hierom calls the idols of heretiques
and you have not taken away only one but in effect all gods commandments by denying the possibility of keeping them

what has been said of holy images may also be vnderstood of crosses
then for reliques the scripture fathers and right reason are so clear for dutifull respect veneration to be given vnto them that there can be no doubt of it
do we not read in the scripture how the woman in the gospel by touching respectfully the hem of our saviours garment was cured of her bloody flux math

how iohn baptist did so respect honour the latchet of our saviours shoe that he esteem'd himself vnworthy to vntye it mark

how the napkins that had but touched the body of paul cast out devils and cured diseases acts
how the ancient church did reverence reliques

augustin testifyeth saying
they bring the reliques of most blessed stephen the martyr which your holynesse is not ignorant as we also have done how conveniently you ought to honour
and in his
book of the citie of god he sayes at the reliques of stephen only there were in a short space so many miracles wrought that they might fill many volumes

it is also agreeable to right reason to honour reliques for the very light of nature teaches vs to honour the instruments of supernatural effects and to carie due respect vnto the bodies of the saints
but these who dishonour and destroy them imitat the old pagans and the enemies of the christian religion

you accuse lastly in this place the catholiques for dedicating churches altars dayes vowes to creatures
but it is sufficient against your accusations to know that they observe the custome of the holy fathers ancient christians who dedicated churches altars not to creatures but to god the creator albeit in memorie of the saints martyrs
so augustin saith the christian people celebrateth the memories of martyrs with fuligious solemnity but yet so that we apwant altars to none of the martyrs but vnto the god of martyrs though in memorie of the martyrs
the same he affirmeth of churches saying we build not churches vnto our martyrs as vnto god but memories as vnto dead men whose spirits live with god
then for dayes they are principally dedicated vnto god though in honour and memorie of the saints
as also vowes are properly principally made to god as vnto the first principle author of all good but when they are made to the saints they are made in a secondary manner as vnto the friends of god by whose prayers intercession we receive benefits from him which is a respect infinitly inferiour to that which

is given by vowing to god as may be seen in bellarmin lib
de cultu sanctor
but indeed you are iustly to be blamed who dedicate no churches nor altars to god but have destroyed profaned many that were consecrated to his service and have abolished the festival dayes not only of the saints but of christ himself and are so far from honouring the saints whom you call very simply creatures with vowes that you have taken away that worship respect from god the creator which had been alwayes given to him both in the law of moyses in the law of nature
section of purgatory praying for the dead praying in an vnknown tongue processions litanies auricular confession yov go on in your covenant saying we detest his purgatory prayer for the dead praying or speaking in a strange language with his processions blasphemous litanies and multitude of advocats or mediators his manyfold orders auricular confession

as you are pleased to father all the points of the catholique faith vpon the popes as if they were their inventions so you father this

point of purgatory vpon them in a special manner crying out that it is a meer fiction a late invention of the popes for their own gaine that it was not beleeved by the primitive church with which vain fancies you fill your peoples eares
but having found you already to be so often false accusers we will not think it strange to see you here like your selves for the holy fathers of the primitive church not only beleeved there was a purgatory that is a third place of temporal punishment where some soules are purged and punished after this life for venial sins and for the temporal punishment due to their mortal sins not fully satisfyed in this life but also they proved it by the scriptvres whereof we shall bring two or three testimonies
the first is of paul
cor
where he saith the work of every one of what kind it is the fire shall trie if any mans work burne he shall suffer detriment but himself shall be saved yet so as by fire
which words augustin bringing speaks thus because it is said

he shall be safe that fire is contemned yet that fire shall be more grievous then what ever a man can suffer in this life purge me lord in this life and make me such an one as shall not need that mending fire
ambrose expounds it after the same manner saying but whereas paul says

yet so as by fire he shewes indeed that he shall be saved but yet shall suffer the punishment of fire that being purged by fire he may be saved and not tormented for ever as the infidels

are with everlasting fire
the second place is in mathew ch

where our saviour saith he that shall speak against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world nor in the world to come
vpon which augustin saith neither could it be truly said of some that they are neither forgiven in this life nor in the life to come vnlesse there were some who though they are not forgiven in this life yet should be in the life to come
bernard brings this same testimony by which alone he thinks to have sufficiently confuted the heretiques who denyed purgatory in his time
the third place is math

where our saviour saith amen say to thee thou shalt not goe out from thence till thou pay the last farthing
vpon which hierom
this is that which he saith thou shalt not go out of prison till thou shalt pay even thy little sins
by all which it is evident that purgatory was beleeved by the holy fathers by the primitive church and that it has good ground in the scriptures
yea the same was also beleeved by the ancient iewes as it is clear out of the
book of the machabees
ch and it is also known that the iewes to this day pray for the dead to speak nothing that the very heathens of old held and the mahumetans hold the same

as bellarmin sheweth
therefore it is not only a false but also a shamelesse calumnie which you covenanting ministers do make when you say that purgatory is a late invention of the popes and they are miserably deceived who

give credit to you
but indeed you ought not to be so great enemies to purgatory seing you must either grant a certain purgatory after this life or else none of you can go to heaven as has been shewed above out of your own principles
for seing according to your doctrine

the filthinesse of your sins alwayes remaines in you dureing this life it must either be taken away purged after this life and so consequently you must grant a purgatory or else you will not be admitted into that heavenly city where no vnclean thing can enter

purgatory then being so firmly established by the the scriptures fathers tradition of the whole church the question of prayer for the dead which has such affinity with it is soone determined
augustins testimony alone shall be sufficient because it shewes the practice of the whole ancient church
it is not to be doubted saith he but the dead are eased by the prayers of the holy church by the wholsome sacrifice and the almes which are given for the soules departed so that they are more mercyfully dealt with by our lord then their sins do deserve
for this being delivered by the fathers the whole church observeth
and that this was not a new doctrine or practice calvin himself confesseth granting that it was a custome to pray for the dead
hundred years before his time
cal
inst
par


you detest next the custome of the catholique church in offering vp her publique prayers in a language not vulgaire
but you do

this without solid reason
for first the church has introduced no novelty in that matter but has still retain'd her liturgies in the same tongues which she had vsed from the first time of her founding by the holy apostles
secondly the church has thought more fitting to retain her liturgies in these ancient sacred and vnchangeable languages though not commonly now known then to subiect her liturgies to all the inconveniences that are occasioned by the changes of vulgaire tongues which are in a continual ebbing flowing
this custome may be confirmed by the practice of the ancient iewes who having corrupted their language by the long continuance of the babylonicall captivity speaking commonly syraick did not leave of for that to continew their office in the hebrew tongue for which our saviour did not reprehend them which certainly he had done if it had been an vnlawfull thing
thirdly the command and practice of the church ought to be obeyed and followed in matters of disciplin where god has commanded nothing as he has done nothing here concerning the language of the publique liturgie
lastly there is no necessitie of vseing a vulgaire tongue in the publique prayers of the church seing they are directed to god who vnderstands all languages for the good of the people who are sufficiently instructed in these matters by continual catechizing preaching and interpretation in their vulgaire languages
and hence it comes

to passe that the service of the church is more venerable being in an ancient vnchangeable language not known to all and by that means also the communion of the churches service is more spread it being in a common language
therefore we may iustly conclude that you vniustly blame the catholique church for vseing this ancient venerable custome
but you may be iustly blamed who although you pray not in a strange language yet you oftentimes pray ex tempore in a strange sense yea you have committed a greater absurditie for you have put latin which you call a strange language in your confession of faith this same very covenant when you abiure opus operatum as we shall see presently and which is more you do not interpret and explain it which experience sheweth none or few of you can doe
if it be amisse as you alleadge to pray vnto god in a strange language albeit he vnderstands all languages it is much more faulty in you to put latine in your confession of faith which the people does not vnderstand and yet not only require them to say but also enforce them to swear amen to it as you have done with your covenant vnlesse perhaps you think it a sin to pray vnto god in a strange language but not to swear or curse something in it

you are enemies also to the most laudable ceremonies and devotions of the catholique church as vnto processions litanies by which gods glory is manifested and his iudgments

have been often prevented
first concerning processions we read in the scripture how acceptable to christ was the procession of the children people of ierusalem

when he entred into that citie vpon throwing down their garments before him carrying braunches of palmes and singing hosanna in imitation of which the catholique church vpon that day makes solemn processions by carrying the holy sacrament strawing of flowers and bearing of palmes
all which is done to the honour of christ
in the old testament also we read of the solemn processions that were made with the ark about iericho iosue
and of diverse others when the ark was carried from place to place
kings
and
kings
they were vsed also in the primitive church as baronius shewes

and mention is made of them in the councel of laodicea
in these processions were oftentimes said litanies or short prayers by which god has been often pacifyed of which basil the great saith cum litanias dicimus non humanis verbis sed oraculis spiritus deum placamus
when we say the litanies we pacify god not with humane words but by the oracles of the holy spirit
by these processions litanies

or publique supplications the city of rome was miraculously delivered from a furious plague in the time of gregory the great and the city of vienne in france from horrible earthquakes in the time of mamertus bishop of that city

as may be seen in the ecclesiastical history

therefore processions litanies are most ancient laudable they tend much to the glory of god stirring vp of devotion
and the litanies are so far from being blasphemous as you very rashly call them that they are oracles of the holy ghost by which gods iudgments have been often prevented
for the multitude of mediators advocats which you renounce the catholique church acknowledgeth but one mediator who has redeemd all mankind by the shedding of his pretious bloud to witt
and for the saints she acknowledgeth them to be only mediators advocats to pray for her as the faithfull living pray for others which makes nothing against the one meditation redemption of as is evident to any man who has common sense
therefore albeit you renounce the mediation of the saints to pray for you yet the catholique church will not renounce the prayers of the saints

you detest also the manyfold orders of the catholique church which are in all reckoned to be to witt the order of porter lector exorcist acolite subdeacon deacon priest and which may be seen explained

in the roman catechisme out of the scriptures and holy fathers
it is sufficient to know that they were observed in the most holy primitive times and it may be truly said that these manyfold orders of the catholique church are much more commendable then the manyfold

confusions of your presbyterian kirk

lastly you detest here auricular confession but either you detest it as vnlawfull or vnnecessary
you cannot detest it as vnlawfull vnlesse you controule both your masters luther calvin

for the first saith secret confession which is now kept in the church doth mervailously please me and is profitable yea necessary neither would wish it were not yea reioyce that it is in the church of christ since it is a soveraigne or only remedie to afflicted soules
calvin also speaketh to the same purpose saying when any man is troubled with his sins he may discover them to his pastor to be comforted yea not only the late english church did allow it but also your selves do sometimes practice it confessing to your ministers albeit some of them be not very good secretaries telling in the pulpit what has been tould them in their care to the ruine and disgrace of some as might be shown by fresh experience
if you detest it as vnnecessary then you goe against our saviours commission the holy fathers
for christ having made the apostles spiritual iudges and having given them power to bind loose from sins it followes necessarly that the people must confesse their sins to them or else their power had been given them in vain neither could they absolve the people from what they knew not
but hear augustin so vnderstanding the scripture shewing the practice of the primitive

church
do penance saith he as it is done in the church
let no man say to himself
doe it secretly doe it with god god who forgives me knowes doe it from my heart
therefore without cause was it said what you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven therefore without cause were the keys given to the church
doe we make void the evangel of god doe we make void the words of christ if we promise to you that which he denys doe we not deceive you and elswhere he saith there are some who think it sufficient to salvation to confesse their sins to god alone for they will not or they are ashamed or disdaine to show themselv's to the priests
but will not that thou be deceived by that opinion
for his iudgment is also to be vndergone whom our lord doth not disdaine to appoint his vicar
passe by more testimonies for some have been brought above to this purpose section
by this alone testimony of augustin you may see that your ministers who deny the necessity of confession or the desire of it when a confessor cannot be had make the power of loosing to be given to the church without cause make void the evangel of god the words of christ and promising you remission of your sins without confession promise you that which christ denys and so miserably deceive you
the catholique doctrine of confession is a truth so engraffed in the hearts of christians and the practice of it brings so great comfort that even these who are brought vp in a contrary heresy

are enforced sometimes to make vse of it for the comfort and ease of their distressed consciences albeit they confesse for the most part to vnlawfull pastors who have no power to absolve them
and your puritanical opinion against confession is an old damned heresy of the novatians messalians iacobits
section xi
of repentance faith satisfactions opus operatum works of supererogation
merits pardons peregrinations stations
yov say next in your covenant
we detest his desperate and vncertain repentance his general and doubtsome faith
his satisfactions of men for their sins his iustification by works opus operatum works of supererogation merits pardons peregrinations and stations

here in the first place you follow your two masters luther calvin by calling the repentance of the catholiques desperate and vncertain

which cardinal bellarmin reckons not amongst their doctrines but amongst their deceits calu~nies
for first it is most false that the catholiques repentance is desperate thtough co~trition be required to it since there is no more required but that which is iust and

which many have had and by gods grace may be easily had neither have any been drawn to despaire by it as the same bellarmin affirmes against calvins calumnies
secondly it is falsly called vncertain for albeit the catholiques teach that no man without divine revelation can know the truth of his own repentance by the certainty of divine faith yet he know it by a moral certainty ariseing from hope in the divine goodnesse according to that of paul

we are saved by hope which is sufficient to put mans mind in peace and tranquillity
then you as falsly detest the catholique faith as generall and doubtsome for albeit the catholiques bele ve not only all that god has reveal'd in but also every particular point yet you call their faith general and doubtsome because they will not beleeve that which god never reveal'd to witt your special faith or rather foolish fancie by which every one of you beleeves that your sins are forgiven and that you are of the number of the predestinate and by which you think to be iustifyed
but the catholiques have no reason to beleeve such a special faith because as it has been shewed above it is nothing but meer presumption and is condemned as a false faith a private fancie by a famous protestant and it is so groundlesse doubtsome that it brings diverse among your selves who follow closely your principles into great perturbation of mind and some into desperation
all which

as also the truth and certainty of the catholiques iustifying faith may be seen handled above in the matter of iustification and particularly in the
chapter page
and some few pages following

after you have detested confession and blamed the catholiques for requireing so much contrition now you detest satisfaction and so you renounce all the three parts of the sacrament of penance but you do this with as little reason as you have done the rest for by satisfactions the catholiques vnderstand some laborious works such as prayer a mesdeeds fasting which are offered vp to god in satisfaction for the temporal punishment due to our sins after the guilt and eternal punishment are taken away by the sacramental absolution which doctrine is most consonant to the holy fathers
that temporal punishment remaines due to sin after the eternal is remitted is most clear in the person of king david

who after he had gote remission of his sins from god by the mouth of nathan the prophet was notwithstanding punished temporally with the death of his son

this truth augustin doth testifie saying a man is forced to suffer even after his sins are forgiven doth hold a man temporally whom sin holds not guilty vnto eternal damnation
that this temporall paine remaining after the guilt of sin is remitted may be redeemed by good works which are therefore called satisfactions is also evident
for

daniel said to the king let me counsell thee king redeem thy sins with almes and thy iniquities with the mercies of the poore
iohn baptist saith doe fruits worthy of penance
augustin vpon these words of the psalme cleanse me from my sin desires sinners to say with david no my lord my sin shall not be vnpunished it shall not be vnpunished but therefore will not that thou punish it because punish my own sin
passe by more testimonies for brevities sake
it is sufficient to note that the centurists confesse this was the doctrine practice of the auncient church as may be seen centurie
col
neither is it any wonder that you who deny all good works are so great enemies to satisfactions or works of austerity

you detest next the popes iustification by works but you might as well with your first apostle luther renounce the iustification of iames who teacheth the same in expresse termes saying do you see that by works a man is iustifyed and not by faith only but enough of this matter has been said above

then for opus operatum which you abiure it has bred some of your ministers endlesse work for being often enquired they could never tell truly what it was but brought diverse ridiculous oftentimes contrary glosses or rather gesses on it which would be too tedious here to insert
whereby it is evident

that they have blasphemed things as iude speaks whereof they are ignorant and have

made many thowsands do the same
what the catholique doctors intend by opus operatum has been above shewed pag to witt that the sacraments of the new law doe conferre grace by the work wrought that is by the power of the sacramental action instituted by christ to that effect and not by the merit of the minister or receiver of the sacraments which is a most certain truth as may be seen above explain'd and confirmed at more length
this is a better work wrought then the work of your covenant which has wrought much mischief in great britain

you are not content to renounce all works of duty which are commanded by denying the possibility of keeping the commandments vnlesse you renounce also works of more perfection not commanded but counselled which the catholiques call works of supererogation
that there are such works most laudable commendable albeit you detest them is evident by the scriptures fathers
for virginity is not a command but a counsel and is more perfect then matrimony
of this paul giveth testimony saying as concerning virgins a commandment of our lord have not but counsel give as having obtaynd mercy of our lord to be faithfull

cor
where he also sheweth that he who maries doth well but he who maries not doth better ver
the same also our saviour shewes saying that there are eunuches who have gelded themselves for the kingdome of heaven
again our saviour

shewes another counsel

or work of perfection when he said to the yong man in the gospell if thou wilt be perfect goe sell the things thou hast and give to the poore thou shall have treasure in heaven
math

to these two works of perfection is adioyn'd voluntary obedience as christ himself shew by his voluntary subiection to the blessed virgin and ioseph he himself being the absolute lord of them all things
luke
the holy fathers are most clear for this doctrine
chrysostom saith some things christ commandeth somethings he leaveth to our own for he said not sell that thou hast but if thou wilt be perfect sell that thou hast
and in his
homily of penance he saith multi ipsa superant mandata many goe beyond the very commandments
augustin also sheweth the difference between commands evangelical counsels affirming that for not doing the first men are condemned but for doing the other they are commended in these things god commandeth a debt in those what you shall supererogate or bestow more he will render at his returne
these are the excellent works of perfection to which a great treasure or reward is promised in heaven these are the heroick acts of vertue which are only performed in the catholique church and show the admirable excellency perfection of the christian religion against which excellent works you are so great enemies that you have not so much vertue as to approve

them when they are performed by others
the truth is so clearly here on the catholiques side against you that it extorted a confession from one of your own coate shelford a protestant minister who having spoken a little of the foresaid evangelical counsels and of the great rewards that are promised to them concludes in these words these are gods counsels which of the primitive church were put in practise but in our times meaning of the protestant church they are put off with a non placet

you detest next the catholique doctrine of merits which you would make the ignorant beleeve to be most absurd and indeed so it will seem to any who lookes vpon it through your ministerial spectacles representing it vnto them as if the catholiques taught that good works done by the force of nature and not by the power of christs grace were meritorious of heaven or that they taught that they were to be saved by their own merits and not by the merits of christ whereas indeed the catholique doctrine is iust contrary as may be seen in the councel of trent sess
can



and in the
chapter of that same session of which matter something has been touched above pag

and before that
where some words of the councel to this purpose are cited
the true sense then of the catholiques concerning merits is that good works done by a person in the state of grace and performed by the power

strength of christs grace have a reward of eternal life by christs goodnesse promised vnto them
the scripture is so clear for this truth that it is wonder how any person can doubt of it it our saviour saith
be glad and reioyce for great is your reward in heaven
math

again call the workmen and pay them their hire ch

paul saith god will render to every one according to his works to them truly that according to patience in good works seek glory incorruption life eternal
rom
who sowes in the spirit shall reap in the spirit life everlasting

cor
and of himself he saith have fought a good fight concerning the rest there is laid vp for me a crowne of iustice
tim

and in the apocalypse it is said of some saints they shall walk with me in whites because they are worthie
whereby it is as evident as the sun that life eternal is the reward and hire of good works and therefore they are meritorious for rewards are not given but to merits
the holy fathers are so much for this doctrine that luther diverse protestants doe censure them for it

as may be seen in the protestants apology
we shall be content to cite one only testimony of augustin who saith he to witt paul sayes that our lord a iust iudge will render to him a crowne he therefore owes it and as a iust iudge will pay it for the work being regarded the reward cannot be denied
but the evidence of this truth is so great that it is acknowledged by other protestants the forementioned

shelford saith the main tenet of the scripture is that god will reward every man according to his works
and much more to this purpose
the protestant author of the christian moderator confesseth it yet more fully saying professe sincerely should be so far from enforceing papists to renounce the doctrine of merits that am resolved to suffer a thowsand deaths rather then abiure so manifest a truth according to the sense wherein they explain themselves or affirm so great manifest an errour according to the sense wherein we explain our selves
thus he
but according to your principles yow have reason to renounce all merits since you deny all good works affirming that your best actions are mortal sins to which indeed not reward but punishment is due and so you will be in a very hard case if you be rewarded according to your works

you renounce also pardons or indulgences but when these are known according to the catholiques sense they are not such boggles as you would make them appeare to children for these are only remissions of the temporal penance or paines which for the most part remain to be suffered for the satisfaction of sin after the guilt thereof is taken away
that the church has this power is proved by our saviours words whatsoever thou shalt loose in earth shall be also loosed in heaven
and by the practise of paul who pardoned the incestuous corinthian of the rest of his penance

cor
where he saith he pardoned him in

the person of christ
neither in this matter rightly vnderstood can there be any difficulty and therefore we will insist no more on it and the ministers themselves have been known to give such pardons to some faulters freeing them from their stoole of repentance

for pilgrimages to holy places which you detest we need not also to stand much vpon them seing they were ordained by god himself as may be seen deuternomie
chapt ver
where moyses saith three times in a yeare shall all thy male appeare in the sight of our lord thy god in the place which he shall choose
the holy parents of samuel carefully observed this precept

kings
as also christ himself and his blessed mother
luke
iohn
the gentils likewise came from far cou~treys to worship in ierusalem as the eunuch of aethiopia
acts

and the three wisemen came from the east

to adore christ at his birth
mat
the devout woemen went to visit our saviours sepulchre
now what was the practice of the primitive church is so clear that it needs no proof

hierom saith it would be longsome to recount through every age from the ascension of christ to the present time the number of bishops martyrs and eloquent persons who have come to ierusalem to adore christ in these holy places
and again
the iewes of old did worship the holy of holyes because there were the cherubins the propitiatorie and ark of the testament manna the rod of aaron the golden

altar
but does not the sepulchre of christ seem more venerable vnto thee the glory of whose sepulchre was foretould by esay
and his sepulchre shall be glorious

the peregrinations also to visit the sepulchres of peter paul and of other saints were very frequent in the primitive church and are not blamed by some protestants
these devout pilgrimages to visit holy places saints reliques by which god his saints are much honoured devotion augmented many benefits often obtaind are much more commendable then your intended warlik peregrinations with your covenanting armies to destroy these holy places monuments of piety
but you have come far short of your reckoning
how much are you degenerated from the piety of your ancestors who built diverse hospitals in the way to rome enriching them with revenues to receive the pilgrins who were going to visit the bodyes of the holy apostles

as cardinal baronius testifyeth

then for stations which you have made the people abiure with implicit faith they have put many of your best ministerial heads to a stand not being able to shew what they are as is known by many experiences
but albeit you ignorantly abiure them yet they are most ancient and commendable
tertullian makes mention of them

when he saith that the church in time of persecution disciplinaticr est in ieiunijs stationibus orationibus that is more exercised in fastings stations and prayers

and in many other places he speaks of them
they were nothing else but vigils or dayly watches of people continually praying in the time of solemn fasts
which were called stations by a similitude drawn from an armie wherein there are alwayes some appointed to keep watch when others are at rest
so in the catholique church which is the army of the living god there are some ordain'd to stand watching praying for the rest
what evil is in this or rather is there not great good in it but thereafter the stations were not only vsed vpon fasting dayes but also vpon sundayes feasts as may be seen more amply in cardinal bellarmin lib
de bonis operibus
and it is related in the life of columbanus a great apostle of our nation that in the famous monasterie which he founded at luxovium in burgundie there were so many religious persons that there were ever some in the quire night day praying and praising god
such holy stations are much better then your and therefore you very inconsideratly abiure them
section xii
of holy water consecration of bells solemn vowes the sign of the crosse the rest of the covenant
yov subioyn next in your covenant these words we detest his holy water baptizing of bells coniuring of spirits crossing sauing anointing coniuring hallowing of gods good creatures with the superstitious opinions ioyn'd therewith
his worldly and wicked hierarchie
his three solemn vowes with all his shavelings of sundry sorts
his corrupted bloodie decrees made at trent with all the subscribers and approvers of that cruel and bloudie band coniured against the kirk of god
and finally we detest all his vain allegories rites signs traditions brought in the kirk without or against the word of god and doctrine of this true reformed kirk

to make now an end of your covenant a little word shall be spoken of the particulars which you here abiure
first you detest holy water which the devil also hates because he has found often the power and vertue of it
mention is made of holy water numb
and
clement shewes that mathew did ordain the manner of consecrating it
and

basil the great reckons it among the apostolical traditions
as for the effects of it

epiphanius shewes that ioseph did dissolve incantations by holy water and hierom doth testify the same of hilarion
besides bernard witnesseth that malachias by holy water did cure a phrenetique man and a woman who was much vexed with a cancer
this is sufficient to shew that the vse of holy water is most ancient and profitable which might be shown also for other effects as of taking away venial sins
but we proceed to the rest

after your detesting of holy water you detest the catholiques consecration of bells to gods service which is done by sprinkling of holy water vpon them and by vseing some other ceremonies for which you call it baptizing of bells whereby some are brought to think that the catholiques do really baptize them so that sutcliff accuseth them for abuseing thereby the sacrament of baptism
to which kellison answers that the said sutcliff is very ridiculous if he think that the catholique church baptizeth belles as she doth litle infants or that she saith to the bell baptize thee in name of the father
and therefore if he look into the pontiflcal he shall find that this blessing of belles consisteth only in sprinkling holy water prayers other ceremonies by which the bell is dedicated to gods service
and although the people in some places as in france call it baptizing of

bells yet this baptizing is only a benediction or dedication of the bell

thus the doctor with much more to this purpose as may be seen in his reply this blessing hallowing of bells is much better then your reformers vnhallowing selling of them which sacrilege god did visibly punish when at the beginning of your pretended reformation he caused a ship loaden with the lead bells and other ornaments of some churches which they were sending beyond seas to be sold to plump down suddainly on a very faire day in the road of aberdeen whereby all the persons goods within it were lost as is known by the relation of some old creditable persons yet living
that was indeed in some sense dipping of bells

you abiure coniuring of spirits or exorcismes by which the catholique church invocating the name of of his saints commands expells devils out of persons possessed
but you do this so much the more without reason

that it was not only vsed efficaciously in the primitive church as iustin martyr cyprian do testifie but also because you were never able to cast out any
luther indeed your first apostle tryed to cast out a devil from a certain woman a disciple of his but that enterprise succeeded so ill with him that he himself was in great danger to be killed by the devil and left behind him a very evil odour as staphylus who was present doth relate

you abiure also the sign of the crosse which basil reckons in the first place

amongst the apostolical traditions and which augustin call the sign of christ without which no benediction is rightly perfected
it was so much honoured in the primitive times that it was erected as chrysostome testifyes vpon the topes of kings crownes scepters and imprinted vpon the front or head of man the most noble member of his body as vpon a living pillar and it is most efficacious against temptations and the affrightfull apparitions of devils whereof iulian the apostata found experience as gregory nazianzen relates with many circumstances
therefore you are very rashly enemies to this glorious sign of the son of man and some of you very wickedly do call it the sign of the beast and it may be iustly said the catholiques crossings are much better then your cursings

by detesting the anoynting of the catholique church you detest iames

who prescribed it and the holy apostles who practiced it as mark testifies saying they anointed with oile many sick the primitive church which vsed it

whereby augustin shewes the excellency of christians to whom all now vnction belongs which was only proper before to priests kings
by detesting the hallowing of gods good creatures you detest your own practice in blissing your meat with long graces and the elements of your sacrament with long prayers
paul shewes that

every creature may be sanctifyed by the word of god and prayer
the hallowing of gods creatures to pious vses is not superstition but the contrary practice is profanation
the popes worldly monarchie as you call it has agreed better with all the monarchs of the world and that for many ages then your worldly democracy has consisted with one or two monarchs in one corner of the world for the few years you have lasted
and the sacred hierarchie of the church which you without all modestie call wicked has not produced such wicked effects for the space of
hundred yeares and above as the anarchy of your presbytery has done in lesse then the space of twentie
you abiure also the three solemn vowes of voluntary chastity poverty obedie~ce which have been shown above to be works of greater perfection
this shewes that the prophet esay did not mean of you but of the members of the true church when he prophesied of them

saying they shall vow vowes vnto our lord pay them
but your first chief reformers vowed these solemn vowes and brake them
and it may be iustly said that these
solemn vowes are much better works then your solemn league covenant

you renounce also the clerical tonsure which you call shavelings of diverse sorts
but that this was a most ancient ceremony

denis athanasius hierom and others do and venerable bede affirmes that peter did first of all carrie a crown of haires the rest of

his head being poll'd
the mysterious significations of this ceremony may be seen in bellarmin lib
de monachis cap

and albeit no other reason be brought the very venerable antiquity of it alone is sufficient to shew that these shavelings of sundry sorts are better then your new of sundry sects
then you detest according to your phrase the popes corrupted bloodie decrees made at trenf
but that is ordinary for all novelists to carrie hatred to and calumniate these sacred general councels by whose authority their corrupted errors are condemned so did the arians to the great councel of nice
that which you speak of a cruel bloody band subscrybed there is a meer calumnie for no such thing was done there
but indeed it is no calumnie to call your covenant which was approved and subscrybed at your assembly of glasgow a cruel and bloudy band as the effects have proved
it is by such cruel and bloudy bands that false religions must be propagated or rather enforced against mens consciences but the catholique church trusting in the promise of christs assistance and being armed with the force of truth goes on vpon other principles
you are pleased also not only to detest the decrees of the councel of trent but likwise the subscrybers approvers thereof whom you call conspirators against the kirk of god
but albeit your passion leads you to detest their doctrines yet civility should oblige you not to detest their persons especially

since some approvers thereof are the most eminent princes of the world to whom you ought to carrie respect
and whereas you take vpon you the name authority of the church of god it has been shewed above that your kirk has lyen too long hid to be the kirk of god
you call your kirk a reformed kirk but it ought rather to be called a new formed kirk because it is substantially different from the old and it is so far from being truly reformed that it is deformed in the principal points of the christian religion as we have seen concerning the apostles creed our lords prayer the commandments sacraments besides many other substantial articles above touched
that which you say of the popes vain allegories rites signs is frivolous
it is known that these allegories which you blame were vsed by the holy fathers particularly by augustin who excelled in the allegorical sense of the scriptures whose allegories are not vain but most grave and will be preferred by all sound iudgments to your ministers vain tropes and figures against the clear scriptures as we have seen in the matter of the holy sacrament
of traditions we have spoke sufficiently above
all the rest that followes in your covenant excepting the two vntruths touched above in the first section and your oath for maintaining the kings authority is nothing but a concatenation of most fearfull and horrible oaths whereby you tye yourselves vnder highest

curses and paines to maintaine these your grosse errors and heresies which ought rather to be deplored then confuted especially since you are begun to find the effects of these enormities

thus have briefly collected the principall observations which my catholique friend and made vpon the covenant although have passed by many things that were in his papers that this book might not exceed the iust bignesse
but by what has been said may be in some measure seen what counterfeit mettal the covenant is and what a masse of errors and old condemned heresies it containes ioynd with blasphemous execrations of the principal points of the holy catholique faith and what an idol the simple people was made to adore
it is truly to be regrated that our nation which for the space of
hundred years did professe the catholique faith with so great piety and did propagate it abroad with so great glory zeal of which many monuments are extant in forreign nations should be now so blinded with error and miscarried by passion against the truth that for the most part if it were in their power they are no lesse zealous to extirpate it

the most famous cardinal baronius gives this excellent testimonie of the ancient scottish christians
these saith he who received the gospel first from pope victor and their first bishop from pope celestin by whom they were all made christians did profitt so much through the grace of christ that they became

the most excellent of all christians and practising the christian faith with great diligence by an apostolical function did propagate it largely and gloriously among forreign remote nations as we shall see in due place
thus baronius
it may please god in his own time to dispell the clouds of darknesse and ministerial calumnies and make the light of truth appeare again vnto this nation and turn their hearts vnto the right way from which they have gone very far astray
and that this may be granted all ought to pray especially these whom god has called lately in this nation vnto the knowledge of the truth
with the concurrence of which desire would make an end if the renounciation of the covenant shown by my catholique friend to me and some other new converted catholiques wherein there is an antithesis almost in every point between the catholique and presbyterian doctrine were not thought fitting to be here subioynd with which we shall conclude
a renovnciation of the scottish presbyterian covenant or confession of faith

wee whom it hath pleased god of late to call mercyfully from the darknesse of heresy vnto the admirable light of the holy catholique faith doe professe that after

long and serious search for the truth we are now

fvlly satisfyed thereof by the

word and spirit of god residing constantly in the holy catholique church
and

therefore we beleeve and professe that this only is the true religion without which it is impossible to please god which was of

old mercyfully revealed by our blissed saviour and by his holy apostles through the preaching of the blessed evangel which since that time has never lye hid but has ever shynd like a light set vpon a candlestick

and has been professed through all ages in

all christian nations and particularly in the ancient kingdome of scotland as gods

eternal and most known trvth the only ground of our salvation as may be seen in the catholique confession of faith approved and authorized by the

vniversal consent irrevocable determinations of all the general councels of the christian world
and

has been not for the short space of
or hundred but for the

long time of
hundred years and above professed publickly not by one or two but by above


kings of this nation diverse of which are

gloriovs saints in heaven and by the whole body of this kingdome

which had filled the christian world with the fame of their piety and zeal for propagating the eternal kingdome of christ

to the which confession and ancient vniform religion we without any constraint of men but meerly for the love of truth in hope of eternal reward though with imminent danger of temporal losses doe most

willingly agree in our whole hearrs as vnto gods

vnalterable truth grounded only vpon his

revealed word

and therefore we renounce all sects and heresies contrary vnto it but especially the presbyterian sect and all the points thereof as they are now and have been anciently condemned by the

word of god and by the holy catholiqve chvrch
but particularly we reiect the vnparalleld insolency of that calvinistical

sect vpon both the

letter and sense of the holy scriptures vpon

the

holy catholiqve chvrch vpon their own

lawfvll princes and superiors and their tyrannizing over the

consciences of their

all their licentiovs exemptions from obedience to iust lawes vnder pretence of christian libertie to cloke iniqvitie and give occasio to the flesh
their destvctive doctrin against

the necessity of the

vnwritten word expresly commended by the written word

against the fvlfilling of the law without which there is no perfection against the triple

office of christ as he is king priest and prophet which is a manifest corruption of the blessed evangel

their corrupted doctrine of

original sin which makes their best actio~s mortal sins
our

svpernatvral ability and dutiefull svbiection to gods law
our iustification by

works
our

perfect sanctificatio and obedience through christs grace vnto the law

the

natvre nvmber and vse of the holy sacraments
their two

gracelesse sacraments administrated without all holy

rites and ceremonies venerable for antiquity commanded by lawfull authority and not contrary

to the true doctrin word of god
their

iudgement against many children dying with the sacrame~t together with their most crvel
practice of suffering many children to die withovt the sacrament
their

conditional necessity or rather indifferency of the most necessary sacrament

of baptism
their more then chimerical imagination of the real absence of christs body from the elements together with the real presence of the same to the soules of their faithfull receivers

their

violations of solemn oaths withovt dispensations vrgeing of perivries vpon men against their consciences
their allowing of marriages in degrees forbidden by the chvrch of god
their

impiety of allowing advlteries vnder the name of marriages to the divorced against the word of god

their

devilish abrogation of the divine masse
their

blaspheming ministerie their sacriledge of robbing the holy sacrifice both from the quick the dead their

sainting of covenanting sinners

their calling vpon

men and not vpon angels and their miscalling of glorious saints by opprobrious titles
their idolatrizing of their own fancies and errors and profaning of holy images reliques and crosses
their barbarous destroying of churches and altars with their violating of holy dayes and vowes made and consecrated to the creator

their endlesse vnpvrgeing purgatory

their mercylesse not pittying the paines of the dead

praying in a strange sense

backslidings into grosser errors

blaspheming the holy litanies and preferring a multitude of

ministers to the angels saints in the

office of mediators and advocats

their manyfold confusions and disorders

publique revelation of private confessions
their

presvmptvovs and vain repentance

their special and groundlesse faith

their doctrine of sinning withovt satisfactions

iustification by faith only

the opus operatum of the covenant which sainted without dispositions even the worst covenanters

their omission of works of dvty tending to edification

demerits

selling of pardons
their intended warlik peregrinations to destroy holy places

their kirk sessions

vnconsecrated wine

their vnhallowing and selling of bells

their

want of power to coniure spirits and cast out devils

their cvrsings and detestations of the sign of the crosse as also

of vnctions of benedictions of creatures for holy ends together with the profanations of these hallowed creatures
their domineering presbyterian

democracy and cruel anarchy

their solemn leagve and covena~t with all their rovndheads of sundry sects their cruel decrees made at glasgow to extirpate the catholique religion where their covenant which has proved a bloudy band was confirmed against the holy catholique church

and lastly we reiect all their

vain tropes and figvres perverting the true literal sense of the divin scriptures against the constant exposition of the holy fathers together with all their

presbyterian traditions brought in without or against the word of god and doctrin of the

holy catholiqve church the pillar ground of truth

to the which holy catholique church we most willingly ioyn our selves in doctrin disciplin and all holy rites as members of the same vnder christ iesus the supreme invisible head and the

bishop of rome the successor of peter prince of the apostles the visible and subordinate head or governour thereof

promising by the assistance of gods grace to continue in the obedience and communion of the same church all the dayes of our lives

and seing many

catholiques are solicitited by sathan and the presbyterian ministers
to swear subscribe receive their sacraments against the clear light of their consciences for ivst feares of the ministerial confiscations and lossing of their estates

we solemnly promise by the assista~ce of gods grace that we shall never yeeld vnto such temptations nor be so ingrate after god has made the light of his truth to shine vnto vs who were living in the darknesse of error as to abandon the truth against our consciences but rather shall continue constant in the profession of the same though it be with the losse of our lives and estates knowing that

god almighty is power full and hoping that his goodnesse shall be willing to render vnto vs a hundred fold and life everlasting
to which god of his infinit mercy bring vs amen
the presbyterian covenant or confession of faith

wee all and every one of vs vnderwritten protest that after

long due examination of our own consciences in matters of true false religion we are now

throvghly resolved of the truth by the

word and spirit of god and therefore we beleeve with our hearts

confesse with our mouths subscribe with our hands and constantly affirme before god and the whole world that this only is the true christian faith and religion pleasing god and bringing salvation to man which

novv is by the mercy of god revealed to the world by the preaching of the blessed evangel and

received beleeved and defended by

many notable kirks realmes but chiefly by the kirk of scotland the kings maiesty and the three estates of this realme as gods

eternal truth and only ground of our salvation
as more particularly is confessed in the confession of our faith stablished and publickly confirmed by sundry

acts of parliament
and now of a

long time hath been openly professed by the

kings maiesty and whole body of this realme both in burgh and land

to the which confession and forme of religion wee

vvillingly agree as vnto gods

vndovbted truth and verity grounded only vpon his vvritten word

and therefore we abhorre and detest all contrarie religion doctrin but chiefly all kind of papistry in general and particular heads even as they are now damned and confuted by the

word of god and kirk of scotland
but in special we detest and refuse the vsvrped avthority of that roman

scriptvres of god the

kirk the

civil

conscienaes of men

all his

tyrannovs lawes made vpon indifferent things against our christian libertie
his erroneovs doctrin against the svfficiencie of the

vvritten word

the perfection of the law the office of christ and his blessed evangel

his corrupted doctrine concerning original sin
our natvral inhability rebellion to gods law
our iustification by faith only our imperfect sanctification and obedience to the law

the natvre nvmber and vse of the holy sacraments
his five bastard sacraments with all his rites ceremonies and false doctrines added to the ministration of the true

sacraments without the word of god his crvell iudgement against infants dying withovt the sacrament
his absolute necessity of baptisme

his blasphemovs opinion of transvbstantiation or real presence of christs body in the the elements and receiving of the same by the wicked or bodies of men
his dispensations with solemn oaths perivries and degrees of marriage forbidden in the word
his crveltie against the innocent divorced

his devilish masse
his blasphemovs priesthood his profane sacrifice for the sins of the dead and the quick
his canonization of men

his calling vpon angels and

his pvrgatory prayer for the dead

praying or speaking in a strange langvage with his processions blasphemovs litanies and

multitude of advocats or mediators

his manyfold orders

his desperate and vncertain repentance

his generall and doubtsome faith

his worldly

monarchie and wicked hierarchie his three solemn

vovves with all his shavelings of sundry sorts
his corrupted and bloudy decrees made at trent with all the subscribers and approvers of that cruell and bloudy band coniured against the kirk of god

and finally we detest all his

vain allegories rites signs and

traditions brought in the kirk without or against the word of god and doctrin of this true

reformed kirk

to the which we ioyn our selves willingly in doctrin faith religion disciplin and vse of the holy sacraments as lively members of the same in christ our head

promising swearing by the great name of the lord our god that we shall continue in the obedience of the doctrin disciplin of this kirk and shall defend the same according to our vocation power all the dayes of our lives vnder the paines contained in the law and danger both of body and soule in the day of gods fearfull iudgement

and seing many

are stirred vp by sathan and that roman to promise swear subscribe and for a time vse the holy sacraments of the kirk deceitfully against their own consciences minding thereby first vnder the external cloak of religion to corrupt subvert secretly gods true religion within the kirk and afterwards when time may serve to become open enemies and persecutors of the same vpon vain hopes of the popes dispensation devised against the word of god to his greater confusion and their double condemnation in the

day of the lord iesus

wee therefore willing to take away all suspicion of hypocrisy and double dealing with god his kirk protest and call the searchers of all hearts forwitnesse that our minds and hearts do fully agree with this our confession promise oath subscription so that we are not moved for any

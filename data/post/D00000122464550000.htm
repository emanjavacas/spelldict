the preface
it is not the design of this discourse to intrench upon any knowledg already disposed and appropriated into arts and sciences as they are at this time delivered but only to propose such things to consideration and use as lying scattered and in common are less cultivated and regarded
for this reason tis in vain to expect accurateness of method or stile but the first part is almost wholly writ in manner of essaies the second of aphorismes the stiles most free loose and unscientifical

the most useful knowledg is that of a mans self and this depends upon that more universal consideration of quid homo potest naturally and artificially what abilities are in us originally by the gift of god and what attainable by our own industry
and both these in order to knowledg or action
to advance this discovery it is hoped that these papers may contribute some hints and steps whereby others may proceed to perfect the whole building
which who shall effect or but considerably promote shall perform a service as acceptable as beneficial to mankind

the perfecting of a young man in sciences and speculative learning is the business of so many books and persons that it seems superfluous to engage in that part of instruction
it was therefore thought more useful to furnish some rules and principles

of active life as being that whereto gentlemen seem more disposed both by their births and general inclinations and whereto also little assistance could be expected from our ordinary speculations
have therefore rather chused to gather up disorderly and bind together such scattered counsels and notions as have occurred either in observation or in some italian writers not ordinary amongst us
if any person shall hereby be any whit forwarded toward the attaining the great end of his creation tis all that is here aimed at
almighty god give success according to the riches of his goodness

the two last of which are comprehended in education

that a man may attain perfection in any art science or virtue three things are requisite

a natural ability power or capacity

art or instruction

exercise and practise
capacity consists
in fancy or invention

memory
and
judgment of which we shall speak at large hereafter
and these in several persons are very different
for granting what some philosophers say that they are originally equal in all men as being the soul it self yet in reality because every soul comes into a body endued with various dispositions and the organs which the soul employeth and are as necessary to the producing its operations as the soul it self are not in all equally there ariseth great variety of capacities and abilities god almighty distributing these his gifts of nature to every one in what measure himself thinks fittest


know there are who accuse the divine providence as more niggardly or sparing towards men then other animals which without teaching know not onely what is sufficient for their subsistence but some things also which men learn by long imitation as to go to swim to express their passions and thoughts
yea and some manual arts which are in us the effects of education are in beasts the actions of sense or instinct
but truely this complaint is without reason
for if we think impotency to be an advantage and those creatures to be in the best condition who have least to do it is true that beasts are happier than men and vegetables than animals
but if every thing be made for action and the more able it is to work the more noble if plus posse follows argues nobilius perfectius esse then is our condition infinitely the better as not only having more but more various more sublime and more difficult operations
it is necessary for beasts to be born with haire feathers scales or shels because they had not the ingeny to make themselves garments which to their very great convenience they might alter according to the seasons nor had they the knowledge of creating fire building houses and the like
nature furnished them with beaks claws and horns because they could never arrive to find out a stone to be melted and framed into all sorts of instruments and utensils
their knowledge ariseth no higher then of what is pleasant or painful they apprehend not convenient or inconvenient just or unjust happy or miserable
god as a master of a family gives the servants their set salary and employs them but his children he educates and instructs to command and dispose not their own onely but even the faculties of all the other therefore were beasts to live by

nature but man by art
beasts were to be perfect at first that they might be presently employed man by habits of his own acquiring
for beasts besides their sustentation in this present life were to expect no other recompense but man by his labour was to merit and by his abilities to inherit a reward and that eternal
he made indeed no creature which he endowed not with sufficient abilities for the uses of their creation and most also with a power to better and advance them by assiduous practice but the end of all inferior creatures was comprehended in their actions of life for the conserving and propagating that but man he created capable of a supernatural employment of a life to be continued infinitely beyond and above this small moment and of operations sublimer then providing for the belly
and therefore he adorned him with faculties accordingly an ability to discern betwixt good and bad virtue and vice reflection upon his own actions an understanding capable to know and comprehend the whole world and more then that also to be present to all past and future as well as present things to multiply a small inconsiderable proposition to infinity and to know him who exceedeth all knowledg


nor are these faculties even in infants tho imperfect altogether obscure
for as soon as they have strength with which beasts are born they do more then beasts they exert greater testimonies of natures bounty framing in themselves human actions whereas beasts work only according to their own kind
for even the nobler faculties shew themselves betimes fancy in imitation of others memory in retaining

what is imitated and judgment in selecting certain actions and parts of actions for their imitation which are the principles and manner of all learning
deny not but sometimes there is such an impotency or defect in the organs which also doubt not most frequently if not alwaies to be a disease and often curable by a discreet physician as renders the subjects according to the degrees of the indisposition unfit or uncapable of any instruction and that all labour bestowed upon them is lost or at least so unapt are they as it is not tanti to employ so much industry as is requisite to render them indifferently like other men
neither is this exact difference of capacities alwaies in childhood especially so easily discerned as it may be with conversation and tryal
let the educator therefore think himself to be but as a midwife who cannot bring forth a child where there is none but where there is can assist the birth though the mother be sickly and the child infirm
and as it is loss of labour to sow where there is no soil and as where the parts are meaner the greater measure of cultivating by instruction and practice is requisite by which even mean parts may be bettered so where there is a greater measure of parts less institution and exercise will advance in them a greater harvest and great industry will raise them to admiration
of these several degrees it is diligently to be considered that some have a bare capacity sufficient to be instructed moving only as they are drawn who like bottles render no more then is just put into them
others have a great inclination to knowledg running when once set in the way either to any or some one science in particular and having the grounds and principles given they are able to

raise conclusions gather corollaries and having the foundation laid build up the rest themselves
others though few are as automata undefined span alphabet their own masters and have a genius or somewhat extraordinary to assist them
which who so have and withal a probity of affection and willingnes to take pains they seem set out by god himself richly fraught for his glory and the good of mankind
it is also to be observed that where there is a great indisposition to one study as many times there is some being by nature more inventive others more retentive some very active others slow it is seldome worth the labour to strive to introduce the contrary to such inclination
amended and bettered such persons may be but totally cured they rarely are and in their own way they may prosper excellently with less pains
speak not here of inclination to virtue or vice for there is no man so disposed but he may be virtuous if he please as shall be shewed hereafter
this of capacities


but the best capacity without instruction by precepts and examples to which are subservient exhortations admonitions threatnings corrections is ready to spend it self upon low mean and many times vicious employments as the best ground except tilled and sowed with profitable seed produceth only ranker weeds
satis norunt prudentes saith pasch in vitâ pybrach virtutis vitiorum semina cum nascendi origine copulata educationis in alteram partem necessario emicare adeo ut bonum esse non natura datum sed arte sit quaesitum ac proinde bene institui sit efficacius quam feliciter nasci
his meaning is that parts are indifferent of themselves to

produce good or evil and great parts as themistocles was told by his master fili tu nihil mediocre eris sed vel magnum patriae lumen vel magna pestis are fitted for great whether good or bad undertakings great errors and wickednesses proceeding only from great wits
education and discipline form our manners and that only every one knows which he is taught
the faculties of the soul can work of themselves but as not except upon an external object so neither to the utmost of their power without imitation nor in the best the right and true manner but by instruction
we are born with hands feet and tongue and have by nature power to write dance and speak yet none of these can we do except assisted sustained and formed by either those whom we see so to employ the same members or by those by whom we are as soon as strength permits taught and moulded into such habits
so all men are born with reason but have not the use of it at first
and when we begin to serve our selves of it it is so weakly that we are easily overcome by sense which till then hath guided us
and if at this dangerous conjuncture we be not assisted tis much to be feared our reason will be but of small use to us especially since we find great store of tracks and encouragements in the broad way of pleasure and therefore shall be unwilling to leave it for the narrow rough and unbeaten routtes of industry and labour
it is true that persons of very great parts can out of their own observation for so all sciences at first began or when they arrive at years of discretion by the help of books that is other mens experience advance without a teacher to a considerable perfection
as lucullus is said to have come into asia an excellent general who departed

from rome an unexperienced soldier
the same is also storied of the lord deputy montjoy
though to confess the truth these instances are not very rare for which seems strangely absurd there is no art to obtain which less diligence is used then this of soldiership though of the greatest consequence
but we had lately a person who without any experience in navigation by reading and study at the very first essay of his art happily and discreetly commanded a ship to the
some commend only practice others think reading sufficient both to blame joyned together they do best
reading advanceth more and sooner then practise alone
a reader is more universal better for many things more accurate and observant in his practise a practisers knowledge is in a shorter compass in ordinary cases and is longer before it come to perfection
reading is other mens experience which by meditation and practise becomes our own but it makes us somewhat too exact and to expect all things should fall out according to our imaginations whereas the world in fancy is much different from that in reality not clothed with those particularities and circumstances which are either parts of or inseparable from it
though reading however be good yet tis best with those who have already had an instructer who can apply his precepts and advices to all accidents supply defects answer all doubts retrench excesses inculcate what is neglected call to mind what is forgotten and set his charge in the straightest and nearest way


yet both capacity and instruction are effectles without practise and exercise which consists according to the nature of the thing to be

learned in meditation thinking or contriving observing others practises and actually trying and working
precepts serve very well for a guide but advance not the guided except himself follow them they facilitate the beginning and progress but the person himself must set to his own endeavour if ever he intends to attain perfection
never have seen parts how great soever without industry and study to produce any good much evil indeed have known proceed from thence
such persons may prove sometimes plausible discoursers and of an agreable conversation in ordinary companies for a time till their stock be spent but it is industry and exercise that renders a man knowing and solid that makes him not fear to be asked a question in what he professeth
and if industry be necessary to great much more to mean parts which it bettereth and advanceth to perfection and honour
and since to have great natural parts is not in our power but we must be contented with those which god hath given us we must set our rest upon our labour and industry for correcting our bad bettering our indifferent and perfecting our good inclinations
and of this the use and profit we make of our talents must we give a severe account
nothing changeth nature but another nature custome not force not reward not passion
our thoughts are according to our inclinations our discours and speeches according to what we have learned but our actions according to what we have bin accustomed
how often do we see men promise vow engage yea and resolve to change an ill habit and yet continue to do as they did before how many see we daily who began well and as long as they took pains profited exceedingly but when trusting

to the goodness of their parts and that small stock of knowledge laid in before not improving it further but giving themselves liberty of mirth and pleasure have not only not profited but bankerupted also and lost their principal besides industry and exercise of themselves render us thinking vigilant attentive provident for all cases and accidents lay up a treasury against all events prevent surprizes and make us familiar and ready to all that may happen
but by idleness and pleasures the spirit is relaxed the understanding unbended the fancy with rust and rubbish and the memory perished


these two last instruction and practise are comprehended in education
there is but one way and manner of learning be the subject what ever it will
in manual arts the master first sheweth his apprentice what he is to do next works it himself in his presence and gives him rules and then sets him to work
the same is the way of breeding a gentleman or a scholar
the educator prescribeth his end gives him rules and precepts presents him examples and patterns and then sets him to act according to what was before taught him
and if the educated apply himself seriously to meditate contrive observe his copy and be content to be admonished and corrected when faulty he will no doubt arrive to the intended perfection which is to perform his duty with ease readiness and delight to advance his art into another nature
for in this art equals nature that is as she works without deliberation and is indisposed to the contrary as a good musicians hand consulteth not what string to touch but runs to it as readily as nature doth to the proper

muscle when she would move a finger
only in this they differ that nature god hath given us art is of our own acquisition nature is perfect at the first moment art is not obtained without study and industry
and the earlier we begin the better it is
for should we suffer as they say of hercules to chuse virtue or vice labour or pleasure when they come to years of discretion and in the interim let them spend their youth in the vanities and follies that age suggests to them is not this that wherein the devil tempted our first parents presenting them the excellency of the knowledge of good and evil whereas it had bin much better to have known good only and left evil to have been understood by the examples of such as would not consider
but into what hazzards are these uninstructed persons cast should it please god to cut them of in their youth is it not as if they said let them habituate themselves in vanity idlenes and folly that they may afterwards judg better of virtue of that whereof they have no experience how can they chuse good since they know not what it is and every one must follow and embrace what he knows
shall we let them first vent their malice but by practise it increaseth let them defer their choice till they may make it with discretion but without teaching they will never come to discretion
for every habit especially when according to a natural inclination as these are by reason of the remainder of that evil left in us for our exercise hurries them violently and at length irresistably also
at best suppose a child should escape accidentally by the care of parents or his own naturally good disposition this rock yet those who start late are so far

behind that when they should be ready for employment they are learning the principles of it and are surpriz'd and at a gaze where to begin
the great inclination of youth is to pleasures and that either to idlenes and sleep whence proceed inconsideration carelesnes hatred of labour and thinking or else to eating drinking or the other lusts of the flesh
and all these indulged and accustomed grow stronger and at last inextirpable
for they end in habitual sin darknes of understanding and extinguishing the light both of gods spirit and reason
virtutem saith pasc vit pibr nisi in primaeva germina dum tenera sint mollia instilletur frustra in adultis requiras
the reason why we see so many old men fools is because we see so many young men unlearned
those who are employed in missions for converting nations to christianity find little fruit in treating with ancient men
it is also necessary to get an habitude of virtue and knowledg in youth that in that age when our understanding fails us wee may do nothing unbeseeming us
but the force of education is seen in nothing more then that whole nations from age to age continue in the very same customes and manners and to change these especially to the better is a difficulty even beyond imagination
those who are brought up in wars are active restles violent ungovernable but by force brought up in peace lazy unexperienced in trade subtil interessed covetous amongst poor men amongst idle persons good for nothing
again were there a city consisting of subjects without education what a confusion would it be without obedience without breaking their own humors and passions every one

following his own lusts without regarding any other without discretion civility even without humanity it self
tis good education of youth that makes virtuous men and obedient subjects that fills the court with wise councellers and the with good patriots
even trees if not cultivated when young change their nature into wildnes and beasts grow fierce and resty if not tamed and broken in youth
nature is bettered and made useful by education and what our industry produceth in us contrary to nature is stronger and converts nature into it self
to neglect instructions is to want other mens experience and to begin again at the very foundation of every art or science which being by little and little advanced and not yet perfected he much hinders himself that takes not advantage of the height they are already arrived to
and not to exercise parts is to loose them and not to use them to the best is to debase and vilify them
for they whose spirit suffers them not to be idle and yet are not instructed to the best advantage fall upon trifles turning watchmaking hunting or worse
one have read of brought to alexander who by many years practise had obtained the dexterity of throwing a small seed through a needles eye
the king for a just reward gave him a sack full of those seeds
but math
huniades the warlike king of hungary was more severe with him that brought him a wooden coat of male wherein was not one ring wanting a work of fifteen years for he commanded him to prison for fifteen yeares more to expiate for so much time and parts spent in so fruitles an employment

chap
ii
of the duty of parents in educating their children
desire parents would seriously consider that education of their children is not left to their pleasure but a duty imposed on them
god the great father of us all deposited the children in the fathers charge and provided by his laws and threatnings they should be reverenced and obeyed by them
they are part of your selves and what you do for them is indeed for your selves
you expect honour by them at all times may sometime also stand in need of their help
tis what you either have enjoyed from your parents or lament your loss by their neglect
you have brought forth children into this world of misery and trouble and will you so leave them will you not assist them in passing through it as well as they can it is but reasonable they should by a speedy death be taken away from the future evil if you refuse to fortify them against it
you provide them estates to what purpose if you also procure them not parts to use them by that you appear to be their provident parents but by this you are paralleled to their good angels in taking care and watching over them

but will speak no more of this for though there be some inhuman and irrational parents that desire their children should be like themselves that think their own honour and respect eclipsed if their sons be wiser or worthier then

they and are contented their children be wicked least their own actions be shamed some also who for covetuousnes neglect or ignorance will not bestow good education upon them yet there are so few of this sort and their error so manifest that it needs no further discovery

another and not inferior error of parents there is that out of know not what tendernes they are unwilling their children should undergo such hardships and severities as a good education doth require
which is as if the mother should not suffer her infant to be molested with the pain of swathing and binding till it grows better able to endure that torment
many parents are afraid their childrens spirits their obstinacy and pride should be broken with due correction and harsher chiding

but the greatest and most general error of parents is that they desire their children to be more plausible then knowing and to have a good mine rather then a good understanding or at least to have both together to employ the same time to acquire serious studies and to study gravity and levity gallantry and philosophy together
but besides what said before if these come in competition pleasure will certainly carry the cause both more time bestowed and greater proficiency shall be made in that then the other it seems to me little less then impossible that two things so unlike if not contrary should be together attended one hour of pleasure obliterating more then three of study will imprint that two so differently

commanding masters should be obeyed
if the soul can apply it self to such dissonant studies why may not the eye also at once aime at two opposite marks the gallants chiefest study is to spend his time the other's to save it the one is for living in pleasure and mirth the other in labour and seriousnes
the one for adorning and trimming himself to visit game play the other for watchfulnes industry devotion
in sum the one placeth his design to be conformable and acceptable to those who understand least to some such silly women and ladies from whom if you take vanity nothing remains the other strives to approve himself to god his holy angels the example of all worthy and wise men of the past and present age
why are rich clothes but to be shown shown to them who best understand them they best understand them who mind nothing else who can judg of every punctilio of the mode and can read a lecture upon a knot of ruban
besides gallantry is ridiculous except accompanied with formality of conversation punctuality in dancing visiting courting which inevitably engage them in loss of time folly and averting the understanding from serious and useful thoughts
and this is as consentaneous to reason as experience for the soul is fortified by introversion upon it self continual meditation and reflecting upon its operations faculties and the objects therein reserved whereas all sensual pleasures call forth the forces of the soul to the outward parts and members of the body whence proceeds that continual combat so much spoken of both by philosophers and divines between sense and reason the body and the soul wisdome and pleasure

methinks therefore children should be educated to all severity of labour and virtue and to this outward politure by the bye only to make those their study and employment and to regard these so much as not to be offensive to those they converse withal
pleasure and recreation indeed is so far necessary as to keep up the strength and alacrity of the bodily forces without which the soul cannot work but speak not of these at this time but of that which is esteemed a part of busines and employment
cyrus and darius great captains and wise men ruin'd their families and monarchy because they educated their children after the median fashion amongst their wives and women who never suffering them to want any thing nor to be contradicted their delicacy made them slothful and languid the slavery and flattery of those about them rendred them haughty and imperious so that they could neither labour wirh cheerfulnes nor command without arrogancy that made them contemptible as effeminate this odious as insolent
wish the persians were the onely faulty in this matter
whoever would educate a child to folly and ruine must give him his own will not suffer his humor to be contradicted be careful that he never come in danger or hardship that he be above labour and industry and every days experience shews us that fortuna quem fovet fatuum facit

but it is very considerable contrary to the persians that many great princes have brought up their children to industry and hardship
eginartus saith of charles the great liberos suos it a censuit instituendos ut tam filii quem nepotes primo

liberalibus studiis quibus ipse operam dabat erudirentur
tum filios quamprimum aetas patiebatur more francorum equitare armis ac venationibus exerceri fecit
filias lanificio assuescere coloque ac fuso ne per otium torperent operam impendere atque ad omnem honestatem erudiri fecit
augustus wore the clothes spun and made by his wife daughter and as suet informs us
monsieur de rhodez thus describes the education of henry the great of france
his would not permit him to be brought up with that delicatnes ordinarily used to persons of his quality well knowing that seldome lodgeth other then a mean and feeble spirit in an effeminate and tender body
neither would he allow him rich habilements and childrens usual trifles nor to be flattered or treated like a prince
because all these things are causers only of vanity and rather raise pride in the hearts of infants then any sentiments of true generosity
but he commanded he should be habited and educated like the other children of that country that he should be accustomed to run to leap to climb the rocks and mountains that by such means he might be inured to labour
his ordinary food also was course bread beef cheese and garlick and he often went and bareheaded
the same care was taken by whole nations especially such as were of a military constitution
the lacedemonian and other antient nations customs are to every one known
olaus magnus describes the manner of the education of the nobility of the warlike nation of the goths

they were accustomed to endure beating and wounds to change of heat into sudden cold to suffering of fire and frost to lying upon boards course and uneasy clothing strong but

ordinary food violent and wearisome exercises according to every age such as riding darting shooting wearing heavy arms especially helmets sheilds spears boots and spurs swimming on horseback and in armor
shall not instance in any more for fear of seeming to much to upbraid the present delicacy


the duty of the parents therefore is first to begin betimes for very frequently the blandishments of nurses and the foolish vain or evil conversation of those about them leave such impressions even upon their infancy as are difficultly defaced even when the child arrives to discretion and maturity
besides the nurses form the speech the garbe and much of the sentiments of the child
the ancient romans saith quintilian when a child was born put him not out to an hired nurse but brought him up in his mothers chamber under the eye of some grave and virtuous matron chosen out of the neighbourhood who was to have him continually in her presence coram quâ neque dicere fas erat quod turpe dictu neque facere quod inhonestum factu videretur ac non studia modo sed remissiones etiam lususque puerorum sanctâ quâdam gravitate ac verecundiâ temperabat
and so considerable was the education of children thought to be that as he saith cornelia the mother of the gracchi aurelia the mother of augustus caesar were governesses to great mens children


secondly though a discreet and careful nurse be provided yet let not the father remit his diligence to wean him betimes nor permit tenderness to overcome his judgment or his present false the durable and perfect love

but hinder as much as is possible the sowing of evil seeds and prevent the very first beginnings and sprowtings of bad actions
there is indeed no man that seeth not the vast difference in childrens inclinations to virtue or vice how easy some are advised how difficultly others restrained even by correction
there remaining in every one somewhat of that pravity derived to us from our first parents inclining us as much if not more to evil then to good yet some more violently then others which inclinations though they render us not guilty the sin being washed away by baptisme yet our consenting to them is sin as our resisting them is virtue and our fighting against and overcoming them is the great employment of our life
and truely were it not for evil examples and councells or at least for want of good ones the victory would not be so difficult as we commonly suppose and find it nor the difference of inclinations so manifest
for thus much must be acknowledged to the glory of our maker first that as every constitution hath a disposition to evil so that very disposition is contrary to another evil to which the indifferent would be more obnoxious and secondly inclineth also to the neighbouring good every defect by the wise ordering of providence being ballanced with another advantage as proneness to anger prompts also to activenes and hardiness to attempt difficulties the slow and phlegmatick are also perseverant and constant in their resolutions that which disposeth to lust suggests also persuasivenes plausibility and cheerfulnes desire produceth industry fear breeds quiet and cautiousnes
and by the way let this be remembred

that it is much easier to bend a natural to its neighbour virtue then to its opposite as an angry person is easilier perswaded to activenes then meeknes the tenacious to frugality rather then bounty obstinacy to constancy fawningnes to complaisance and ignorance to obedience
so that any one becomes evil rather then good is not so much the fault of his constitution as the perversnes of his will following the suggestions of sense rather then the dictates of reason
tis pleasure in children that recommends the evil and warps them from the good tis inconsideration and folly more then the difficulty or unnaturalnes of virtue
and if there be any such man as without delight or interest pursues bad rather then good he wanteth either the reason or desires common to all mankind
nor did wise institute reward and punishment to constrain men to doe against nature but to equiponderate the prejudices of pleasure and interest to countenance reason against sensuality
cannot forbare setting down a notable saying of quintilian cap ult natura nos ad optimam mentem genuit adeoque discere meliora volentibus promtum est ut verè intuenti mirum sit illud magis malos esse tam multos
and seneca nihil est tam arduum difficile quod non humana mens vincat in familiaritatem producat assidua meditatio nullique sunt tam feri sui juris affectus ut non disciplinâ domentur
quodcunque sibi imperavit animus obtinuit
sanabilibus aegrotamus malis ipsaque nos in rectum genitos natura si emendari voluerimus juvat
thus they out of the strength of their reason and experience perhaps also they had learned so much from socrates who by his own example

shewed that even the worst disposition was conquerable by reason
and this is to the shame of so many pretended christians
but how would they have glorified god had they known the advantage given us by grace and his holy spirit always ready to assist our good endeavours though seneca seems to have discerned some glimpse of that also
ep
sacer intra nos spiritus sedet malorum bonorumque nostrorum observator custos
bonus vir sine deo nemo est
an potest aliquis supra fortunam nisi ab ipso surgere ille dat consilia erecta magnifica
pie domine salvator bone saith salvian
quantum per te efficiunt studia disciplinae per quae mutari possunt vitia naturae and speaking there of the africans he saith adeo exclusa naturae originalis sinceritas ut aliam quodammodo in his naturam vitia fecerunt
the sum is though all dispositions be not equally good yet the worst may by the industry of the educators and gods grace never wanting till refused be so reformed and bettered as to be able to do god his prince and family honour and service
and the greatest frowardnes and worst inclinations we find in children are conquerable and when actually overcome those very persons may better succeed then the more facile and complying
only as said let them be taken betimes and the rather because it cannot be known but by experience how any childs disposition may prove and shew it self
but if instead of rectifying his evil inclination any one indulge it and instead of bridling incourage it he makes it his master
whence come those irregular and extravagant desires and actions which we see in many persons of stealing drinking inconstancy and the like

my third advice is that parents would have their children as much as they can under their own eye and inspection
by this they shall be preserved from evil companions imitatation of bad superiors their councel discours and such like but more then all from indiscreet impertinent unmanaged servants
for youth not having the judgment to measure it self from its own actions knows it only by reflection from others relations and thinks it self such really as a fawning servant represents him and servants who are usually brought up in that low condition and have their thoughts and speeches suitable cannot be fit companions to a gentleman
but above all the example of the father is of greatest force to educate a son
te beatum adolescentem plin lib
ep
potissimum imitandum habes cui natura te simillimum esse voluit
the father's actions authorise the same in the child nor can the father chastise him for what himself is guilty
great care must the father take therefore least he give any bad example either of intemperate anger with servants or of using any evil obscene or undecent words and to be such as he desireth his son should represent him
it concerns him also to overlook even his governor and educator when he is of age to stand in need of one both to keep him to his diligence and create authority to his instruction
cato though he kept a master expresly for his son in his own house yet did himself always frequently teach him
so did augustus his caius and lucius
the great theodosius used frequently to fit by arsenius whilst he taught his sons arcadius and honorius to whom also he commanded

such respect to be given by them that surprizing them once sitting and arsenius standing he took from them their robes and not till after a long time and much intreaty restored them
and if the father and family be of good example it seems to me best to educate him at home and leave him in his first bed till he have taken some root before he be transplanted
if the child be of a soft or of an haughty disposition or the family of evil examples tis better to send him abroad betimes
but generally the best place of education seems to be amongst companions as near as may be his equals at some distance from home but whether he may repair every night or very frequently
if this cannot be then with companions in his fathers house for to teach one alone besides other inconveniences is extreamly tedious both to master and scholar
for want of these opportunities the next is at a public school but then great care is to be had that the family where he sojourneth be of good example
and much better would it be for him there to have a pedagogue which in those countrys that abound with clergy is seldome omitted one somewhat versed in learning who may continually attend the child see to his repetitions and the performing his tasks exercises model his manners and preserve him from danger and the like


parents also fourthly ought to guide them as much as is possible with kindnes and affection endeavoring to convince and perswade them of the excellency of labour seriousnes learning virtue sufferings and the like and even denying

what they think not fit to grant them with sweetnes and love and even chastising them with sorrow and for vices only in things indifferent giving them liberty
in bodily sicknesses the patient is the first who desireth the cure but the distempers of the mind are to be discovered and perswaded to the patient by reason and good admonition
neither must the father destine his child to such an employment as himself thinks fittest to serve his other occasions
though most mens parts are capable of many employments yet are many less disposed to one then another and so much as it is not worth the time and labour many times as is said before to endeavour the change of such inclinations
consider therefore both his disposition and the nature of the calling what faculties it chiefly employs and whether those faculties be most eminent in the subject and so fit them together and you shall not need to fear their corresponding to your care
however if after all your endeavours they prove not to your desire as many times it happens murmur not against god who permits them to miscarry either that men may take notice that all is from his grace not our wisedome or that your faith and patience may be tried and your self purged from all human and secular affections and interests or that some faults in your self may be punished in them

of the educator

the fathers greatest diligence is seen in chusing a good governor or director of his son
a good educator therefore whether one be to be chosen or any one desires to render himself such being instead of a father to his charge ought to be first religious virtuous and grave both himself and family that he may give good example and not need to fear that his scholar resemble him
he must therefore be sure to live with greater severity then he exacts of his charge
then also may he hope by his prayers to obtain a blessing upon his endeavours and performing his duty as in the sight of god to give up his accounts cheerfully and receive his reward from him

prudent and discreet as in all other things so especially in observing the childs disposition and to know what it will produce
for many times the medicine is to be applied to the disease not to the symptome
not too severe nor too indulgent not too austere least he affright nor too familiar least he become contemptible to his charge
for young men understand not much the reason of his demeanor
he must praise without flattery chide without contumely and correct without passion be cheerful without levity affable without fawning grave without morosity and merry without folly


patient humble and meek to dissemble and bear with many impertinencies dulnesses forgetfulnesses to endure many affronts contempts passions and sometimes very evil words
not to despond though success answer not his industry for almighty god gives grace when he pleaseth nor doth all seed immediatly sprout however he shall be rewarded not according to the others proficiency but his own industry and sincerity


master of his tongue for that is his great and universal instrument
besides the speech of the master authoriseth the childs imitation
he must therefore religiously avoid not only all wicked profane and obscene but also all undecent all passionate all hyperbolical superfluous customary vain speeches knowing that the greatest reverence is due to children

diligent making it his busines to assist and better his charge to observe all his motions and speeches for tho all cannot be amended at once yet no default is to pass unregarded least that connivance authorize the committing it and the frequent committing produce an habit
yet let him not so trust to his own industry as not by continual prayer to recommend his employment to the giver of success


not covetous
especially let him not fancy to himself the making advantage by insinuating into the interest of his charge for that breeds jealousies at least nor into his affections for their gratitude is writ in sand and their

passions change with new objects
besides after a while he will be look'd upon as impertinent and exercising ridiculously an obsolete power
if besides these qualifications he have experience of forreign parts if he understand learning and sciences if of a good presence and address and wear his clothes hansomely it will admit him into the respect of his charge and facilitate the performance of his duty


in all times great care was taken for providing good educators for they said it was better to prevent vices then punish them
and in most states the magistrates appointed them nor was it lawful amongst many nations for parents to employ any others or educate their children but in public
the canons of most churches since christianity have charged that election upon the bishops and that with so much reason and prudence that the contrary practice hath once and is even now ready to endanger the ruin of this government
the ancient persians despairing to find all requisite accomplishments in one had usually four distinct persons to educate their princes one supreme who had the general inspection over both masters and scholar another eminent for sanctity and virtue to teach him religion honor and justice a third for learning to principle him in knowledg and wisdome and a fourth to perfect him in his carriage valour exercise of armes and chivalry
and tho this be above the capacity and reach of most subjects yet by this every one may see what is perfectest toward which he may advance as his estate will bear
and let them be sure of this that if they

will have the best educators they must liberally encourage them for worthy persons will not labour without considerable rewards both of means and respect
besides the gratitude of princes and great persons to their educators invites others to fit themselvs and to undergo that laborious and hazardous employment
alexander the great built up stagyra for aristotles sake and spared lampsacus for anaximenes augustus bestowed great honours upon the person and country of apollodorus and forgave the alexandrians to gratify areus his master in philosophy
trajan dignified his master plutark with the consulship
memorable is the piety of aurelius who made proculus proconsul and took junius rusticus with him in all his expeditions advised with him of all his both publick and private businesses saluted him before the designed him to be second time consul and after his death obtained from the senate publicly to erect a statue to his memory
tantum autem honoris magistris suis detulit ut imagines eorum aureas in larario haberet ac sepulchra eorum aditu hostiis floribus semper honoraret saith capitolinus
see the gratitude of gratianus to his educator ausonius in his epistle to him
carolus magnus exceedingly honoured alcuinus as did also theodorick cassiodorus making him his counceller and confident
so did otho iii
gerbertus for whose sake ut habeat magister quid principi nostro petro parte sui discipuli offerat otho gave to the church to be disposed of by his governour eight comitatus or counties pesaurum fanum will
rufus made lanfranc archbishop of canterbury
laur
medices greatly enriched

joh argyropilus and marsilius ficinus his educators
and truely it seems to me that one of the greatest advantages of wealth is that thereby may be procured better education then those can have who are not able to requite a worthy person

chap
iv
of the educated
the educator cannot perform his duty unless he know the aime and scope of his employment unless he consider diligently what a one the educated ought to be framed by him


first then we suppose that no man cometh into this world either to be idle or follow and enjoy only his own pleasure and humour but to be serviceable to his maker who acting as a rational agent maketh nothing for our but him self and out of his infinite favour to us is pleased to honour us so much as both that some way we may do him service and thereby also in the highest manner advantage our selves by advancing his kingdome and interest by doing good for god is the universal good both to our selves and others
there is no exception even of the greatest prince from that general burden laid upon us by god himself in sudore vultus tui vesceris pane tuo every man is

to have some laborious employment either of body or mind which is to be his calling and of which he is to render a strict and severe account
solomons princess eats not the bread of idlenes
paul laboured
our lords whole life was divided in labores and dolores
the greatest prince is obliged to the greatest observance and some have accounted themselves but as the general ministers or stewards of their subjects
the high priest among the jews had and the grand seignior at this time hath a trade at which as am informed he is to labour every day which is for no other intent but to mind him of this general obligation
and good reason this is for there cannot be imagined such a difference amongst men all of the same kind made all of one mass having the same entrance into and exit out of this life that some should be born for pleasure only others for labour some for themselves only others for the sustentation of them in their idlenes


the greater means and opportunities any one hath of glorifying god the greater duty and obligation lieth upon him
the reason is plain it is god that bestows all good things who being no respecter of persons gives to every man to profit others
and the more he as the sows the more he expects to reap more from him that had five talents then from him that had but two


whatever a man enjoys enabling him to glorify god and to do good to himself or others is a talent
as strength health parts
also whatever gives him greater authority

as riches and honors or reputation the two foundations of nobility which rendring them eminent and conspicuous above other men sets them also at least as lights and examples to be followed by their inferiors


persons of quality therefore besides the obligation of private persons have others also particular and peculiar to their condition
first as rich men they are to make all the advantage they can for bettering themselves and others by their riches
they are gods stewards after they have taken what is necessary or convenient to themselves and families the better to perform such duties not for luxury delicious fare or fatting themselves as beast are for the day of slaughter nor for accumulating wealth the rust whereof will corrode their consciences as fire would their flesh nor for furnishing their vain pleasures or extravagant desires
but for providing for the poor the immediate and particular care and charge of almighty god many of whom he hath left in worse condition then the beasts and fowls were they not preferred to these treasurers but for public and magnificent works which exceed the ability of meaner persons
besides that charity and generosity are ingenious to invent many waies of assisting others

secondly as masters of numerous families they are to provide for their several relations wife children servants neighbors
and not only temporal but also spiritual supplies
every family being a little church and every master of a family a magistrate within his own walls to govern advise direct reward and

punish those under his charge

thirdly as members of a noble stock they are to advise assist and benefit also their brethren and kindred to whom they have a more particular relation then to the rest of mankind
they are also to correspond unto and in themselves as in a concenter the characters of their worthy predecessors and communicate them as well as their wealth down also with advantage to their descendants
and let them remember that it is not less to deserve to be a prince then to be one


as the most considerable members of a they are engaged in more peculiar duties toward the prince and his subordinate magistrate to know and obey the laws and assist toward the observation of them by others
beside this to fit themselves for such employments as they may probably be call'd unto
whether to be

courtiers and domestick servants to the prince
magistrates in peace commanders in war
councellers of or officers under the prince
employed in forreign parts as agents ambassadors

or in the church as secular or religious active or contemplative

nec sic quisque debet esse otiosus ut in eodem otio utilitatem non cogitet proximi nec sic actuosus ut contemplationem non requirat dei
aug de


these and such like are the callings and employments of gentlemen who as you see ought not to overvalue or think themselves better because

of their wealth or honour but to have greater obligations
and as they may justly expect greater rewards because of greater temptations so are they to fear greater punishments because of greater opportunities of doing good and because every fault is more conspicuous and dangerous in them then in inferiors
but besides they must not forget themselves also to be private persons but let their public busines be what it will they will and must have some time to themselves also to bestow on their particular inclinations
whereof first that is best spent which is employed upon almighty god
and by the way let them take notice
that they ought not to undertake any employment which will not allow them every day a competent time for their devotions

next that is best employed which is set upon ingenious studies especially such as are beneficial and advantagious to the public or such as poorer persons are not able to support
such are the history of his own or other countreys search of antiquity natural history and experiments medicine forreign laws mathematicks astronomical observations mechanicks and the like it being a noble study to observe how god governs natural as well as free agents
thus is salomon praised for his knowledg in plants moses for being versed in all the learning of the egyptians daniel was chief of the magicians abraham a great astronomer david and job eminent philosophers avicen averroes and almansor were all princes
radulfus the emperor gave his mind to jewelling gratianus to making of arms
but heed must be taken least those be made the principal which should only be accessories and divertisements


now to all these the educators care cannot extend nor is it expected it should
but this he ought to do first to lay in his charge the foundation of religion and virtue

to improve his natural parts as much as he shall be able

to ground him so far in such general knowledges as may be serviceable or useful unto him till he be able in some measure to proceed in them by his own industry and by them be also fitted for the other

and lastly to assist him in such particular arts or faculties as he seems most fit for inclined unto or likely to follow
but these not all at once but as his judgment and parts are prepared to receive them that being not superficially or slightly painted or tincted but thorowly furnish'd to all good employments he may have both ability and delight to pursue by himself the same routte and in his private studies build up that knowledg and wisedome whose foundation was laid by his teachers
which is the end of the educators pains and will perhaps take up more of the age then is usually allowed by parents to that purpose
and perhaps it will not be amiss here to advertise that governors be not too soon cast off
augustus caesar kept posidonius his instructor with him till his old age and when he then desired of the emperor to be dismissed into his own countrey where he might dye in quiet out of the tracas and noise of the world cesar desired before his departure to receive some good rules from him for better governing himself the philosopher answered that when he perceived himself angry he should before he undertook any business repeat over the alphabet augustus considering his prescription replyed that he perceived he

had still need of him and perhaps as much as when he was first under his care so refused to dismiss him but gave him an appartment in the palace better and nearer to himself increased his revenues and kept him with him as long as he lived

general directions to the educator

the educator having thus his end proposed and his matter the educated delivered into his hands let him consider how to work this matter to that end
and first he should endeavour thorowly to understand what parts and capacity as also what dispositions and inclinations his charge hath how apt to or averse from this end
next how to frame and order these dispositions which to correct which restrain which encourage
for many times an unskilful gardiner spends much vain labour to gather out the roots of which would perish in the digging


much doth it concern the educator to carry himself discreetly
for young men observe diligently and censure severely when amongst their camerades and their governors in the first place
his first case must be to steer evenly between mildness and severity
yet making use of more or less of each according to the disposition

of his charge and the present occasion
it requires great judgment to join sweetnes and efficaciousnes in his commands not to advance into harshnes and morosity on the one side nor degenerate into softnes and laschenes on the other
harshnes is discovered in these and the like particulars
in enjoyning things in themselves too difficult unfesible unsuportable or too hard for that person or commanding obscurely or equivocally as if he were seeking an occasion to chide or enjoyning them too imperiously and not shewing the reason of his commands in not directing him how to do them in unseasonable urging and exacting them either in regard of the time or the ability or disposition of his charge in pressing all things great and small with the same vigour and importancy or because it is his command in rejecting all reasons to the contrary as excuses and not hearing his charge speak for himself in shewing himself jealous and suspicious or to have an ill opinion of his charge or giving occasion to suspect him morose unsatisfiable or that all his actions and speeches tho dubious are interpreted in the worst sense in exaggerating all mistakes and errours into sins and crimes in denying all or most of his desires tho the things be reasonable or unprejudiciable in unseasonble nimious opprobrious chiding and such like


remissnes on the contrary shews it self in these things
if he take notice only of great and scandalous not smaller or secreter faults
if what is well enjoyned either because of the educated's unwillingnes or others intercessions be

not as it ought exacted but either omitted or changed into an easier
if he judg faults because ordinarily committed or his charge is inclined to them lesser then indeed they are
if he think them incorrigible and so go not about to rectify them
if indeed he resent them as faults but chideth or correcteth not so much as is sufficient to amendment
if when he hath shewed him his faults and that he is displeased with them he leave the amendment to the young man
if to please others as the parents kindred companions of his charge he yeild to a greater indulgence then he ought or if out of timidity and fear of offending his charge he neglect his duty


now to avoid both these rocks either of which is fatal let the governor be resolute to obtain his end but sweet and mild in prescribing and exacting the means
to be sure not to let any vice pass unreprehended and according to the nature or danger of it to be more or less eager but for things indifferent indecencies fancies little humors which are neither vicious nor scandalous to bear with them till their turn come to be weeded out
endeavour to beget in your charge a perswasion that you reprehend or correct not out of your own interest pleasure or passion but out of a true internal sincere affection which if you really bear such towards him will not be difficult
and if you can thus far advance you may go a step farther breed in him an affection toward you for love begets love and then the great difficulty of your work is past in this also the parents must assist
this must be increased by shewing your self at

all times concerned in his interests openly taking part in and justifying his quarrels tho privately you reprehend him severely for thus he sees you are careful of his reputation by your diligent care and attendance on him when sick and many other occasions will be suggested of honestly insinuating into his affections
but take heed you flatter him not nor praise him too much yea tho he deserve very well for many times immoderate praise makes him proud and insolent many times also lasch and negligent thinking he hath got applause enough and needs no more endeavour but as if he hath already hit the mark unbends and throws away his bow
indeed the moderate suffering of praise is as great a tryal of wisedome and prudence as the cupel is of silver


strive also to enamour him of what you would teach him
for to him that doth willingly what he must of necessity the proficiency is certain
to be a good and virtuous man consists almost solely in the will quid tibi opus est ut sis bonus velle
sen ep
he that desires to be so wants little of being so
and this is done by recommending your commands instructions with the reason of them for when the judgment is convinced the will surrenders of her self
cannot deny but this is contrary to the practise of too many of our great schools where children learn only because it is minus malum tho painful and troublesome yet not so much altogether as perpetual chastisement
many have doubted whether children of person of quality should at all be beaten pretending it is slavish and if in another age injurious that he who will not

reform with chiding will be also obstinate against beating
tho there is no justifying those masters who think every thing lawful against that unresisting age who being overburdened with numbers make cruelty pass for diligence and supply their want of care with plenty of the rod as if they who are committed to their charge are abandoned to their passion or as if reason were not to be used to those who are not yet masters of it yet corporal chastisement is necessary even for great mens children also especially for such stubborn dispositions as care not for shame but are afraid of pain
but not this till last of all
for the educator is to try all means before he comes to that exhorting examples employments praise and shame promising threatning rewards alwaies before punishments
divers laudable crafts also and deceits are to be practised as to commend him sometimes more then he deserves or for what he hath not done but you feign to believe he hath done it
to let him know that you many failings in compassion to his age to seem not to believe the evil related of him but to nourish a better opinion to put his faults upon another and exaggerate them in his presence to declare the punishment deserved or inflicted to watch over him so as to hinder the acting of his evil intention without taking notice of it
it was also the custome to punish the young prince's favorite for the prince
if these suffice not try smart chiding wherein take heed of unbeseeming words which a noble nature many times resents long after but all are apt to imitate towards others
beware also of too importunate or unseasonable reprehensions as either when the offender is in passion or in public

or your self in passion tho it be not amiss sometimes to seem so
neither be alwayes chiding for that breeds insensibility and carelesnes and authorizeth his fault by your own
nescio quomodo hoc ipsum quod concupiscitur jucundius fit cum vetatur contumax est animus maxime puerorum in contrarium atque arduum nitens
indiscreet reprehension is many times recommendation of the vice
let corporal punishments be the last refuge and when the rest tryed are found insufficient for what is done willingly is best done horses and beasts are subdued by the rod but man hath a which if possible is to be gained by reason
what we do for fear of punishment we really detest and were we left to our selves we would not do it
yet by accustoming to do it though for fear the bugbear that caused our hatred is driven away and by little and little we acquire an habit of and by degrees a love to it


take all faults vices especially at the beginning by preventing as much as you can all occasions and opportunities of as let him not frequent suspected places not be abroad tho with a friend nor be late from his lodging and the like
for tho he do at such time nothing yet that irregularity indulged will breed inconveniencies first and faultines afterwards
plato having chid a young man for a slight fault and he replying twas no great matter answered but the custome of it is
tho he cannot amend all at once yet he must not settle in any one
many times also we see a word cast in by chance or in merriment to have greater force then a formal admonition
quintilian

if any of his young scholars commited a fault especially too bold and venturous would tell him that for the present he disliked it not but for the future he would not endure it so he both indulged their wit and corrected theit errours aegre enim reprehendas quae sinis consuescere

especially beware of all obscene discourse and those equivocal phrases which the wicked invent to express their lust ingeniously as they think most plausibly dangerously
as likewise of all filthy songs and of libels wherein either the magistrate or other person is taxed
forbear also chiefly if the child be naturally timorous all discourse of witches spirits fayries and the like which intimidate the spirit and fill the head with vain and frightful imaginations
also all fond romances whether of giants or love
those seem to have taken their original about the time of the when all europe was upon the gog of fighting to which they thought those fond stories were very conducing but these from later times when courtship and lust were in greater account then arms and valour
but whatever they be being but castles in the aire it matters not whether they are built for palaces or prisons thay have both a bad effect for they impress upon children and which is almost the same upon women and weak silly men also false notions
they are to the mind what a feaver is to the body filling the soul with preternatural irregular conceits and hindering the true understanding and reall notion of things as they are in the world which true histories set forth
they represent actions by a false glass as in the idle imaginations of silly and loose people
if wandring

and insignificant fancies in the brain romances in the thought be so troublesome to all people to have such in writing is certainly much worse
what a madness is it to increase these by suggesting more by printing our follies and publishing our resveries they shew us lust instead of love false honour and valour instead of true the world in imagination for that in reality agreeable dotages pleasant means to render men fools
the most dangerous of all romances are those which are dressed up with all the artifice of good words habits action on purpose to withdraw the soul from seriousnes and virtue to vanity and filthines comedies mean which who with delight frequenteth returns with the passions and humours there represented shall say or recommended
the design of them is sensual delight and pleasure to say no worse which a good serious man looks upon as his greatest enemy nemo ad voluptatem venit sine affectu nemo affectum sine casibus suis patitur
vbi voluptas ibi studium per quod sc voluptas sapit
tert de spect
upon the same reason would disswade all conversation with fools jesters buffoons and all such as accustome to and study to procure laughter
a dangerous and pestilent sort of pleasure that renders the mind's indulging it like to his that causeth it light foolish vain and contrary to that seriousnes and thinkingnes requisite to prudence and gallantry of spirit
when this passion is over reflect upon what caused it and the manner of it and you shall scarce find any action wherof you will be more really ashamed as of that which nature hath not suffer'd to be acted without uncomely motions

of the mouth and countenance
impossible saith danti
che sia pace verit nella republica se colui che governa amico de buffonerie bugie
and as it is in a commonwealth so in a family and in all conversation


let him do every thing for a good end the best way
first direct his intentions aright and by that means his actions become virtues and which is more there will be insensibly implanted the very essence of religion
to carry himself decently tell him not that the people will think better of him that he shall be more accepted in conversation but tell him that he ought to carry himself as the noblest and worthiest of gods creatures
to study and be diligent not that thereby he may arrive to honors here and be acceptable to great persons but to do god his creator the more service and the like
to do his actions the best way will breed a laudable ambition in him to excell in that which is good
and since in every age the same faculties are employ'd only the objects changed and the actions of those faculties not many it must need be that our whole life is but reacting the same thing frequently over upon divers subjects and occasions
as the fool personates the same humour tho in divers comedies and tho sometimes lance jodelet or scaramuccio yet tis all but the same buffoon
in infancy little quarrels with their brethren peevishnes wilfulnes are afterwards angers hatreds envies prides jealousies and a sensiblenes in youth for a gig or a is the same afterwards for honour or interest
and he is not the only wise man who discourseth of

or acteth great and high matters but he who speaks or doth whatever it be great or small pertinently and according to the nature of the subject
therefore let your charge even in his youth frequently reflect upon his own and others actions and censure them freely that himself may be engaged to know to do better when the like occasion recurs
tis generosity not to admire every thing he hears or sees which some miscall civility but to use his judgment to discommend as well as praise nor to acquiesce in every answer but to seek for solid reason and according to his capacity satisfaction
let him also in in his sports be prompt diligent active subtil free not dishonest and where there is any engagement for victory earnest contriving watching advantages yet not quarrelsome endeavouring to overcome yet patient if vanquished and these qualities will be also afterward put on in more serious matters for if hunting be a praeludium to war childrens sports are so to all other actions of their life


it is also necessary that the educator have the disposing of the servants or at least that the child have none but virtuous and discreet persons to serve and wait upon him especially in his chamber whose discourse at his rising and going to bed have great influence upon him many times either to confirme or deface such notions as have bin infused into him the day before
great care also must be had of recommending him to good companions and rather those that are somewhat above him in years of a good reputation and such as you will be content he may imitate
if you come into a

strange place you may discover evill company if they be extraordinarily officious without any reason if they applaud whatever the young man saith or doth if they offer their service and assistance to all purposes if they advise against the governor or to liberty libertinisme or idlenes if they railly droll and speak evil of others especially of virtuous men or such as the young man is recommended to if they endeavour to draw him to unknown obscure or suspected places or bring him into much company
beware of such men and get your charge out of their hands as soon as you can


have often thought it a great shame to see beasts as horses and dogs taught with so much care and industry their natural vices corrected and their disposition reformed by almost certain rules fitted out of observation to every humour and imperfection yet many men to return not only not bettered but much deteriorated from their governors till considered that besides the ignorance negligence and insufficiency of the educators or their undertaking to bring up too many and all by the same way there was also required on the part of the educated the generous concurrence of his own free desire and endeavour to do well
that some also have such natural imperfections and perverse dispositions as if not taken at the first moment as it were the acts and preserved with infinite care and industry from temptation are difficultly reformed and straightned
nero was not rectified by seneca and burrhus tho it is probable had he been a private person and so long under their care till he had got an

habit and imbibed those instructions they gave he might have proved a virtuous person
but the tree returned to its native crookednes before it had time to grow straight
cicero son to the stupidity of his nature added drunkennes and good fellowship and no wonder if from athens and cratippus he returned as he went to them
aurelius provided
of the most approved masters of the whole empire the learned julius pollux being one to educate his son commodus and within a while cashiered five of them because he had observed some levities in their carriage
yet could not the other nine rectify the froward and barbarous humour perhaps suck'd from and encouraged afterward by his mother at the time of his conception in love with a gladiator
caracalla was nursed by a christian tert ad scapulam whose education had such force upon him that for a long time he behaved himself so as he gained the love of all men hujus puoritia blanda ingeniosa saith spartianus
but afterward the natural humors which were not sufficiently by that short time of good education purged out sermented again and corrupted the whole mass
in such cases therefore advise the educator to be contented to do his endeavour and not easily despond but if no betterment to have patience and without all passion and with due respect to the person careful not to fix any scandal or permanent infamy upon the family send him away
he may be fit for somewhat else as the spanish proverb saith that which will not make a pot may make a cover or others may be more fitting for him or more fortunate then your self
and so as physicians remove their incurable patients far off into the

countrey free your self from him that you may not be shamed by him nor your self see his shame

vi
of the ordering the disposition and manners of the educated
this begin withal because it is the chiefest and foundation of all the rest
for if you can plant in him a virtuous disposition the rest is easy and follows as natural corollaries from thence
and this is sustained upon two general bases conscience and honor
therefore


let the educator in the very first place endeavour to plant in his charge a true sense of religion
mean not that which consists in disputing for a party or in discourse only but that in the heart and affections
that he may seriously remember and acknowledg his creator betimes and accustome himself to bear that yoke which in time will grow easy and at length pleasant and that he may not be ashamed to own god almighty for his master in this adulterous and atheistical generation
our lord said that the good seed being sown in the ground of an honest and tractable disposition cannot but bring forth in youth the blade then the eare and at last arrive at maturity
regard not any wicked proverb or censures of early piety
but if religion

once take root in the spirit of a child
the principal is saved should it please god to call him betimes out of the world

neither can he in his whole life miscarry
for this is founding him upon the rock which withstands all floods and tempests it is a principle universal perfect unfailable upon which whoever builds shall live uniformly contentedly and happily both here and hereafter a principle which will bear him up in all estates accidents and actions a principle he never need change or forget
his sufferings by it will be pleasant his life blameles his actions prudent his words discreet his thoughts virtuous and regular and in all things shall he live according to the perfection human nature is capable of
religion prescribes a certain end the glory of god or doing as much good as he can to himself and others which is an high and noble aime and direction and hinders all lownes of spirit disorder and confusion in actions and inconstancy in resolutions
for if any object be proposed he considers not so much what is lawfull or expedient as what is best to be done
from want of such a scope or mark it comes that most men shoot under employ their minds in little unworthy their dignity and not honorable if effected
indeed our understandings are foolish and desires irregular and to rectify them we have fathers and governors whose wisedome we make our guide yet is not theirs comparable to that of our lord set forth in the holy scriptures
frequently therefore inculcate the greatness of god the creator and governor of all and every particular in this world the shortnes of our life and certainty of judgment the great reward for

the good and severe punishment for the bad
explain to him the mysteries of the lords prayer the creed commandments his obligation in baptism and the doctrine of the sacraments in due time
accustom him often to meditate and set before him the manner of the life which our great lord the only son of god lived here on earth and the great sufferings and mortifications he voluntarily chose and underwent that so he may not prefer in his thoughts any way before it
frame also for him prayers conformable to his age and condition which may contain a summary of his duty
and take care that he say them every morning and evening upon his knees not in bed and as he advanceth change them lest they become a meer form
let him also every night at his going to bed recollect historically what he hath done and said that day and for what he hath done amiss to be sorry and for what well done give thanks
let him also frequently suppose twice a day read some part of the scripture and the historical and sapiential books rather then the other which are more difficultly understood
in the morning let him as much as he can order his actions and emploiments for the whole day foreseeing what temtations that day are likely to come upon him and how he may best prepare against them


let him also be made to know his own dignity the sublime ends to which he was created and the noble actions which are in his power
ad magna imò ad maxima nati sumus not as beasts groveling on the earth obedient to their appetit and labouring only for their belly
major sum ad majora genitus quam ut

sen man hath a design higher then nature to be like to almighty god and his holy angels to overcome himself master his passions and rule over others not by fear and violence but by reason justice and choice
the arts and sciences he invents the laws and government he establisheth the cities and fleets he buildeth argue him to be of a most noble extraction and that a good man is worthy to be reverenced of his own self in as much as he will do nothing misbeseeming so noble and eminent a nature
and especially let him be fortified and well prepared to entertain sufferings which is the great trial and cupel of gallant spirits and without which he can never become perfect his faculties can never be advanced to the height of their power
for in some sort suffering is the one half of our life as doing is the other
sufferings in body sicknesses pains want of conveniencies in diet lodging liberty wearines
in good name obloquies defamations revilings affronts too much reputation expectation and the like
in his mind ignorances of what he desires or is fitting for him to know discontents for loss or miscarriage of relations and friends breaches of friendship treacheries ingratitudes failings of his designs insulting of enemies
in external things losses poverty with infinite more
shall not name spiritual afflictions because seldom incident to this age
now for these and the like let him be instructed how to render himself as little as is possible obnoxious to them by not setting his mind upon what is not in his power by good considerations proper to every sort such as are furnished in many books particularly in petrarch

but especially let him be practised and inured to suffer and bear so many as his age well permits with courage and patience
however he may arrive to the discretion not to be disturb'd for trifles for the loss of a horse a dog or a picture or somewhat of smaller value
and if he can bear a small burthen in youth doubt not but he will be able to carry greater still as he grows in age


endeavour to sow in him the seeds of true honor to be afraid of shame for misbehaviours and to value the good opinion of virtuous and worthy persons
the desire of honor is of so great force in all our actions that the false and conterfeit of it is the great incentive and encouragment to all wickednes that those men who neglect and despise religion yet pretend altogether for honor that the horridest and most dangerous designs never want persons to act them if they can be perswaded to be honorable that the pretended diminution of it is thought not sufficiently revenged with the loss of life that for it so many battels are fought so many friendships broken so many laws even of religion despised and conscience and justice trampled on
but these are from a misapprehension and mistaking that to be honorable which indeed is not so
but would my educated should esteem reputation only from wise and virtuous persons which is the attestation of them that know best to his actions and a public recommendation to emploiment
by this means he shall list himself under that ensign and be ranged with that party whereof our lord himself is the captain and he will take pleasure in virtue and piety

when he sees his actions and waies conformed to the sentiment of the world of all gallant persons both past and present
nor shall he need to hunt after applause and fame that will follow him fast enough with those that are either indifferently or well inclined
but he must expect obloquy from the contrary party and many evil words and much raillery will be spent upon him in vain if he have the courage to despise them
being a gentleman then let him consider that he is above the tongues of evil men that he is engaged to nobler and sublimer designs and actions then other persons he must steer by higher stars and aim at somewhat more heroical
other men labour for a fortune and are a long time before they can arrive at that height to which he is born and wherein the virtues of his fore fathers have placed him he is already because of his wealth secured from necessity and want of what may be convenient or useful for his studies from necessity too often the mother of low and abject thoughts with which a poor man first combats before he can conquer any advantage of emploiment
besides by his family he is already placed upon the theater where all his actions shall be observed and praised even more then they deserve all mens eyes are upon him expecting somewhat extraordinary from him and so he needs not some eminent action to introduce him into the good opinion of the world
let him therefore aim at somewhat above not only ordinary persons but his own condition also least he fall equal to those below him for he cannot in practise reach the height his imagination designs
let him say continually with

himself for what came into the world why hath god gived me such riches such parents such respect amongst men but to do more good surely have received five talents a greater increase and return is expected from me
magnam fortunam magnus animus decet


this greatnes of spirit consists principally in these virtues omitting most of those which erasmus in his enchiridion militis christiani recommends very effectually but are common to all christians as well as to a cavalier will only recite such as are more noble heroical and honorable and leave the pressing of them to the industry of the educator

his title of gentleman suggests to him the virtue of humility courtesy and affability easy of access and passing by neglects and offences especially from inferiors
pardoning also injuries as being superior to them and not provocable to injure another
generosum apud animum cito moritur iracundia
he despiseth no man for his fortune or misery and is not afraid to own those who are unjustly oppressed for such ordinarily are men of parts and if of virtue and integrity they commonly rise again
he is not proud no not when commended nor doth any thing render him insolent or haughty above other persons
nor doth he strive to make himself known to be a gentleman by huffing swelling strutting or domineering over inferiors nor by disobedience and restines towards superiors much less by hectoring and quarelling
so neither by his clothes and peruque nor stands he upon his family name wealth honor of his kindred

or ancestors but strives to equal himself with those that began their reputation in civility industry gentlenes and discretion
by obedience to laws submission to governors not content to do barely what is enjoined or to make law the adequate rule of his actions he forbears more then the law forbids and doth more then it commands he storns to take advantage of his quality to exemt him from such duties exercises and rules as meaner persons are obliged unto

he doth nothing for fear of punishment nor leaves he a good action because of the danger obloquy or the like
courage is the proper virtue of great spirits
wherefore he defieth all little crafts and subtilties in negotiations and thinks to master his designs by reason and magnanimity rather then finesse and devices
he is also as much as is possible equal and alike in his conversation calme peaceable and the same in private as in public
he bears also adversity cheerfully when deservedly chid or corrected is patient is open and free not dissembling or hiding himself behind little nets or
invalidum omne naturâ querulum est
he scorns to tell a lie
tasso said that other vices were like clip'd or light but lying like counterfeit and false mony which an honest man ought not to pay tho himself received it
nor is he afraid to confess his faults because he committeth them unwillingly nor ashamed to discover his ignorance for he hath a desire to learn

he is also laborious abstinent and willingly undertakes

difficult and painful emploiments he had rather be in a camp then in a and is afraid of nothing more the the dead sea of sloth and pleasure
difficulties he knows bake and concoct the mind lazines effeminates and loosneth it

he is ready to do good to all give rather then receive is bountiful values not great favours done by himself so much as small ones received
is not ungrateful to others but himself desires no recompense and is content tho unworthily used
bona facere mala pati regium est
he thinks it much below him to hate any one
in sum he is bold without rashnes affable without flattery prudent without cunning secret without dissimulation devout without hypocrisy
he is constant not opiniatre liberal not prodigal gentle not soft open not foolish frugal not covetous
he fears nothing he despiseth nothing he admires nothing


to beget in him these and all other virtues set before him good examples if of his own family ancestors and kindred tis the better as also are those of his own countrey condition time age acquaintance and present rather then ancient and absent
no prince except of a very base alloy as nero and commodus if he hear of a good musician or comedian desire to be like him but if he knows of the noble acts of his equal he wisheth his own were such
acquaint him also with the stories of good and virtuous rather then men for this many times fills his

head with vain and fruitles imaginations
and here cannot but recommend to all persons the reading of lives of modern rather then ancient persons which are not the worse if drawn truly because somewhat hansomer then the original
as monsieur peiresk and monsieur de renty alessandro luzzaga coglione giacome medices marquis of pescara pibrac giac
foscarini sir tho
more proposed to himself jo
picus mirandula whose life and some of his works he translated into english
carolus calvus caused a manual to be made for his instruction in his daily duty out of the lives of famous persons and that excellent book of aurelius seems to be no other then such memorials as he collected for the governing himself and empire
examples also of evil men if discreetly represented are as useful if not more then others for wise men learn more by fools then fools by wise men
the thorns also which are dug out of his own ground by admonition or correction must serve to make a fence for the future and he must be manured with the weeds pluck'd up in his own garden
all the faults both of himself and other men being useful to preserve him from the like


let him also know the great advantage of innocency above repentance
he that keeps himself from great sins is as one that hath a prosperous voiage he that repents as he that saves himself upon a plank
consider what the good father said to the frugal son all that have is thine
and what john of those who continue virgins innocent that they have a new and peculiar song that they as immediate attendants

follow the lamb whither soever he goeth
and that they are the first fruits most holy unto god and our lord
how happy is he that never goes out of his way with a reasonable constant pace he must needs advance much further then other persons
especially fortify him against the three great ruins of youth luxury debauchery and gaming and all other faults which tho in themselves lesser yet his peculiar inclination may render them as dangerous as the other
but if his garment cannot be kept alwaies clean yet have a care it may be with all possible speed washed and let all endeavour be used to preserve him from habitual and customary sins for rather then permit these you ought to render him up to his parents who perhaps may find a cure you know not
dionysius tis better to use a forreign example for that which is too common amongst us having in his youth indulged himself the liberty of debauchery and finding too late the inconvenience and endeavouring to oblige himself to the strict rules of temperance was answerd tho perhaps untruly that he could not safely do it if he relinquished his drinking he would fall into a consumtion so in his own defence he was forced to continue in his sottishnes
so true is that of our lord he that committeth sin is the servant of sin and especially in this sin of drunkennes whilst that extraneous supernatural fire quenching the true native genuine heat of the body requireth still to be nourished by its equal or stronger


the great spring and origine of lust is idlenes and if drinking increase the fire lust takes

away the fewel both shorten the life
ply him therefore with continual labour and study that the temter may find no bait to cover his poison
this is the remedy against that fire which consumeth so many noble persons families and nations an enemy not to be contended withal but avoided
after you have detained from him all romances lascivious books pictures and discourses and yet prevail not bodily labour interchanged with study must be prescribed and if this remedy not change places and suggest new objects continually
a worthy prince of late times being by a servant of his temted to this sin shewing him all things prepared for the purpose the prince opened the door of the room and commanded the officious ruffian to give him place and secrecy which he had no sooner done but the prince shut the door upon him and forbad him ever to come again into his presence
and truly this temtation is the exact and almost adequate trial of a brave and heroical spirit
he that is not carried away with every beauty nor too much with any one that is deaf to pleasure those enticements which so few can avoid hath a noble soul and well grounded virtue
but if neither sense of honor which this sin wounds more then any other shame alwaies accompanying those unlawful as blushing doth the lawful actions nor sense of the grievousnes of the sin nor the expensivenes nor spoiling his parts nor danger to his person nor the fear of diseases and shortnes of life nor conscience of his duty and virtue nor emploiment nor any other remedy will serve tis best to marry him
this sort of love said tasso is a vice wherein the same coin is not current between

buyer and seller the one pays honor conscience virtue as well as money the other but love at the very best
but betwixt man and wife there is money for money love for love and all other things equal
but look not upon marriage as a remedy only for fornication except in such young men who before the time are impetuously carried on to those desires it is much more honorable but seldom falls under the educators cognisance and if it do he is rather to advise who is unfit then who is fit for a wife


the inconveniencies of gaming are
acquaintance with low base unworthy company

learning also from them sordid and unmanly arts as sharking cheating lying equivocating which is by such counted overwitting their camerade

loss of time and money

great engagement of the passions which is the most effectual and speedy means to obliterate any good thought and introduce the superiority of the bestial part

learning or at lest patiently enduring those abominable swearings cursings blasphemings
danger from other mens passions
how many have bin murthered more duelled upon monsieur faret observes that only three sorts of persons follow the trade of gaming

covetuous who for love of money care not what means they employ to obtain it and find none easier and cheaper then this which requires no stock no tools no learning and is readily taken up by any one that hath but little wit and less conscience

lazy and effeminate who not knowing how to spend their time better can devise no divertisement so proper as this lasch exercise

desperate who being by fortune or their own

wickednes reduced to that extremity that they live to day as if they were to die to morrow think they may obtain that subsistence by cheating or hazard which they cannot hope reasonably for by their industry and not having any virtue ability or lawful emploiment to supply their debauchery they betake themselves to prey upon the weaknesses and ignorance of better men then themselves
here then it is to be supposed that no gentleman desires to advance his fortune by the detriment of an other and that to avoid coveteousnes the author of those horrid mischiefs in gaming he ought to forbear gaming as the trade and emploiment of necessitous idle dissolute persons the cheats whereof are so infinite that it is impossible a virtuous or ingenious person should learn or avoid them and that it is a science which will neither credit its professor nor quit the charge of the learning
yet if not as a trade but with due caution practised plays may be learned such especially as are menaged by skill and not fortune only to acquaint him with numbring and to quicken his fancy and memory
besides musick discourse and such other divertisements will not hold out long conversation with the same persons
but then let him not play for more money then the loss of it will be insensible to him and if his play can bear its own charge seek not to gain by it
and let him as much as is possible practise to be unconcern'd in the winning or loosing to play calmly without passion
to which if he can arrive he hath been serious in his play to very good purpose
let him also be veracious and abominate a lie or cheat even in his play
and lastly if a let him beware of discovering the faults either unskilfulnes or deceit of the gamesters else both parties will hate him

of frugality or ordering his money and expences


wealth money being the great instrument whereby all things are performed in civil societies and therefore being equal to all other external commodities of our life whereby also well laid out friends are gained in the court of heaven it is necessary the educated be taught the use and value of it betimes
it is reported of sr thomas more father that to the intent his son might prove a good husband and employ his time and intention wholly upon learning he would never permit him to have any money but when he wanted any thing to ask for it
quod adeo stricte observavit ut nec ad reficiendos attritos calceos nisi patre peteret pecuniam haberet
and this severity sir thomas more afterwards mightily commended for by that means saith he could not furnish any vice or pleasure could not loose my time in gaming nor knew what unthristines or luxury were nor could employ my self in any thing but my studies
sir thomas more was indeed one of a rare and extraordinary spirit so observant of his father that the history saith he never offended him nor was ever offended with any thing his father said or did to him and when himself was lord chancellor of england before he ascended his own tribunal in he went to the

where his father was judge to ask him blessing upon his knees and beleive had his father indulged him the command of all his estate he would have done no otherwise then as without it
so that whether is better to keep all money from a youth or let him have some small proportion for any great part he must by no means be possess'd of is a question not to be decided by this example
knew two persons of quality great friends who brought up their sons together and were of divers opinions and practises in this point
if we may judge by the event he who had the power of money proved the better husband
but neither do think this to be any more then one single example more am confident have miscarried on the other side
methinks the best general rule because several dispositions are to be handled several waies which must be left to the discretion of an educator is that he be allowed so much a month to be spent according to his own fancy yet not scrictly watched except where there is reason to suspect some ill menagement by the governor
who is also to restrain him from debauchery gaming and all notorious acts of prodigality and on the contrary to provoke him to compassionate the necessitous be liberal to such as have any way served him nothing being so unbecoming a gentleman as ingratitude and such like
but by no means let him have all his allowance in his own power for that is to put the bridle out of his mouth the means whereby the governor must coerce him


let him at first with the direction of

his governor do as much of his own business mean buying trucking giving receiving paying chusing clothes books as he is capable for hereby his mind is inured to a great piece of wisdom soli sapienti notum est quanti res quaeque taxanda sit
sen ep to esteem compare one thing with another to judge and value not only things necessary for the present but all others also
for the grounds and principles of judgment and discretion are the same tho the subjects whereupon they are exercised are divers
nor let him fear the silly opinion of such persons as think cheapning or chusing a derogation to their honor or buying for the just value a cheating of the seller
have seen the greatest king in christendom refuse to buy what he conceived too dear and to change the shop where he thought himself not well used
persons also of very good quality in italy are not asham'd to go to a shop chuse and bargain for their clothes and make the taylor also cut them out of the whole piece before them
whereas an ordinary gentleman amongst us thinks himself abused if not cousened
as if it were noblenes to expose and suffer themselves to be overreached derided and fooled by an impudent pedlar or flattering host
who tho in our nation they arrive by the impudent folly of those who know no nobler way of generosity then to be fooled by the meanest and unworthiest of all people to buy the estates of such prodigals as degrade themselves first into a familiarity then into an equality at last into an inferiority with them yet in other countreys where men have and make use of the parts

god hath given them they are kept in that degree and rank which befits their profession


let him alwaies buy with ready money which will both keep him in mediocrity of expences within his bounds teach him the value of money and acquire him very great reputation both with tradesmen and others
he buyeth cheaper and better commodities and is not imposed upon with false bills and accounts
by this means also he may learn to live under his revenue which whosoever doth not can never keep himself out of debt
it is therefore dangerous to have to do with them that keep books which are authentick records tho governed many times by careles or dishonest boys except himself also keep another and as diligently look to his accounts and that frequently to old reckonings never turning to the profit of the debtor and if after the manner of merchants under the notion of creditor and debtor tis the easier and better
but if he keep his accounts severely not only they with whom he deals but his servants also will be more careful what reckonings they bring him


young men out of emulation have a great vanity of desiring whatever they see their equals enjoy and this proves many times a dangerous and expensive folly being accompanied with a speedy loathing or neglect of what they unreasonably long'd for
omnis flultitia laborat fastidio sui
a young man need not be altogether cured of this distemper if it can be regulated excellent use may be made of it for his instruction in many knowledges

and gaining him much experience
but to moderate the exorbitancy the best way is to make him an example to others by putting him upon some particular curiosity by himself which may with reputation be opposed to those many vanities of his camerades
and such a one also as need not perish with the using as globes maps pictures medals curiosities of art and nature


neither let the educator be too morose or solicitous to keep him from all vanity in clothes or expences lest he be discouraged
for few being willing to learn out of the school of experience and she being a good mistress if not the sole one it is very fitting to make her a partner in our instruction
only the educator that is reason must be the chief master and let his charge take out only such lessons under her as his guide shall think fit that is such as may convince the younker of the vanity of those and the like desires

of the preservation of his health
because it is very tedious chargeable and sometimes dangerous to repair for every small distemper to a physician it is very fitting the governor should know to preserve his charge in health
for without that he is uncapable to undergo any emploiment neither can he study nor follow his exercises when sick but is troublesom to others and unprofitable to himself


in youth excess in eating and drinking is very frequent necessary therefore it is to moderate his appetite
for if the stomack be stretched beyond its true extent it will require to be filled but never well digest what it receives
besides it is much better to prevent diseases by temperance sobriety chastity and exercise undefined span alphabet then cure them by physick
qui enim se medicis dederit seipsum sibi eripit
summa medicinarum ad sanitatem corporis animae abstinentia est
he that lives abstemiously or but temperately needs not study the wholesomnes of this meat nor the pleasantnes of that sawce the moments and punctilios of air heat cold exercise lodging diet nor is critical in cookery and vintnership but takes thankfully

what god gives him
especially let all young men forbear wines and strong drinks as well as spiced and hot meats for they introduce a preternatural heat into the body and at least hinder and obstruct if not at length extinguish the natural


but if overtaken by excess as it is difficult alwaies to stand upon guard the best remedy is vomiting or fasting it out neither go to bed upon a full stomack except by reason of drinking it be necessary to remove him from company that the world may not be witnes of his brutality and that himself may be hindred from all extravagancies and be ashamed of it the next day
let physick be alwaies the last remedy that nature may not trust to it

if through melancholy timorousnes or womanish education for see very few women well educate men nor men women your charge have imaginations that he is alwaies sick if he only pretend so that he may avoid study and labour tis another case do not at first seem to discourage him but rather bring him off his humor by painful and harsh physick which is the cure also of those melancholic persons whose sicknes tho they are frequently indisposed yet is not dangerous either for life or labour


much of health consists in exercises and recreations which must be regulated according to the country season but generally rather violent then lasch such mean as may cause the body to transpire plentifully and

exhale those black and fuliginous vapors which are wont to oppress young men that nature be not hindred in her circulation
neither be afraid tho he be weary and tired for wearines is no disease nor doth simple heat without putrefaction cause a feaver
besides brisk exercise will render him strong active mettlesome whereas idlenes contracts a stagnation of humors numnes of the joints and dulnes in the brain
yet violent exercises as running leaping wrestling are not so fit for thin choleric and weak bodies rendring such old and gowty before their time as they did constans the emperor


dancing is a moderate exercise so much whereof is to be learn'd as may give a good and graceful motion of the body
no nation civil or barbarous ancient or modern except our late contradictive spirits that express not their joy and mirth by it which makes it seem a sprout of the law of nature
but the use which is now frequently made of it especially since it is become a difficult study and many years besides infinite practise required to a reasonable perfection in it cannot but utterly condemn subscribing to the severe but true censure of that most excellent modern historian monsieur de rhodez
there is nothing saith he which doth more dissipate the powers of the spirit nor more enervate the forces of the soul then the ravishing harmony the continual agitation of the body and the charms of ladies conversation
the great triumph of sensuality is such meetings where the eare is fed with musick the eyes with beauties the smell with perfums

the tast with banquets whither none are invited or come but to please or be pleased
could their thoughts be then seen in what a hurry and tumult should we perceive them what desires what fears what impatience what lust what jealousy what envying what despisings card
borromeus in his book against balls and dances saith that he when a young man at the university and his companions with great importunity prevailed with one of their professors a grave and prudent person to go along with them to a ball who having observed the actions and circumstances thereof told them with great astonishment that it was an invention of the devil to destroy souls by corrupting the very being and essence of christian virtues
when a servant lighteth a torch we give him strict charge not to carry it amongst flax straw or the like
why do not parents forbid their children to frequent those places where is more danger of kindling another manner of flame to have the imagination swelled with the presence of beauties in their trim and under a full sail when the blood is chased and the mind set upon pleasure is not drinking cold water but strong poison to one overheated


it will not be amiss here to add that divers bodily diseases infirmities and undecencies may by the educators care be regulated and either wholly or in good part amended
for few there be who have all the members of their body equally sound and the worst is corrected by bringing spirits to that part with labour and exercise as

shooting in a long bow for the breast and arms

bowling for the reins stone gravel walking for the stomack
riding for the head and the great drusus having weak and small thighs and legs strengthened them by riding especially after dinner as did also his late majesty
squinting and a dull sight are amended by shooting
crookednes by swinging and hanging upon that arm
stammering by deliberate and slow speaking and observing what words run most currently
so both mr mede and mr oughtred helped themselves
divers misaffections in the eyes by spectacles
bashfulnes and blushing by frequent speaking in company

ix
of the divers passions inclinations and dispositions of man and the ways to rectify and order them

but that the educator may clearly see his work and have it as it were wholly in his view will dig a little deeper anatomize and lay open the soul with its operations
perhaps not so accurately and punctually yet as plainly and for practice as usefully as can regarding not the curiosity or philosophy but the necessity and utility of the knowledge
for he that knows quid homo potest will quickly perceive what his charges abilities are and what his defects and consequently what the remedies

in the soul then are two sorts of powers cognoscitive for knowledge
motive for action
knowledge omitting apprehension as not falling under our consideration consists in invention memory and judgment of which in their places
action is in the will of which we shall not speak or affections
and these are either concupiscible or irascible and both these are passions or inclinations

passions are the natural motions of the soul towards objects agreeable or disagreeable
or the

motions or effects which objects pleasing or displeasing immediately cause in the soul what the soul suffers from its objects immediately without deliberation
tho some call passions only the more irregular and ungoverned actions of the soul

inclinations are the frequenter and customary working according to those passions
and if meerly according to natural suggestions they are properly called inclinations but if they proceed to excess and be not bridled and regulated they become vices
but if regulated by reason or gods spirit they are properly virtues
if by the probity of nature without much deliberation our inclinations work laudably as they do when habitually regulated by reason then are those natural inclinations called natural virtues or good nature


by the way take this caution that you trust not to these natural virtues as if they were or could be sufficient to make a man habitually and throughly virtuous or as if he that acteth according to them were really and sufficiently virtuous
what seneca saith of valour is true of all the rest
paucissimos fortes natura procreavit bona institutione plures reddidit industria
and this our holy religion expresseth more plainly when it distinguisheth between grace and nature for if natural dispositions be not sufficiently virtuous morally neither are moral virtues sufficient for obtaining heavenly and spiritual graces
dispositions indeed they are to virtue but must themselves also be ordered and directed by prudence else they will run into many mistakes love where there is more reareason

to hate and cajole where they should chastise they will also neglect many actions of virtue and run into many of vice
nor is it a sufficient excuse for any an angry person to say that he is so naturally for we are to live by reason and grace not by nature nor is it well said of a thief am so naturally for to what purpose have you reason

suspiciousness doubtfulness suspense misinterpretation

it is to be noted that many times a man worketh contrary to his natural inclinations because the inclinations follow the cognoscence of the soul and it happens frequently that a violent and strong apprehension may be formed on a suddain contrary to what is usual
as the sound of drums trumpets shouts examples may put such apprehensions into a coward as may make him valiant and on the contrary weariness darkness rumors sombre and dismal accidents may intimidate a valiant man
wherefore it is great rashness to judge of any mans inclination by any particular action or to think that every man must work as he is inclined
again passions having their force because reason and the commanding part of the soul doth not restrain and bridle them it seems that inclinations are best discerned when they are most at liberty as childrens at their play when they think not of dissembling or restraining them
and
that they who command not one passion are also obedient to others

and that he who is one way passionate is likely to be so in all or any
and
that the educator seeing the inclination of his charge may moderate change and govern it as it shall be convenient and that by changing objects and apprehensions but chiefly by shewing him the good or bad of that or the contrary that is by rationally persuading him to submit it to reason


these inclinations are but as the elements and principles of our dispositions and humors which are made up of many of these man as all other creatures being and these in several degrees and predominancies and these also mingled and tempered with the differences of knowledge or apprehension
and by the way upon these grounds perswade my self it would not be difficult to enumerate all or the greatest part of our actions and the causes and order of them which is a piece of knowledge the most conducing to the well menaging of our selves that can be for the variety of passions inclinations and dispositions is the cause of all human business and affairs in the whole world
from the mingling of inclinations and apprehensions arise those infinite sorts and varieties of as the french and spaniards call them wits we term them dispositions
the chiefest have observed will here set down for an essay and sampler to direct those who have more leisure to add to them according to their experience
and it would be a good work to characterize them so vively that men at least such as are extravagant may see themselves as in a

glass and discovering their imperfections amend and alter them
in general some dispositions are bad others good
bad are such as these


such as want wit dead stupid senseless heavy dull forgetful sottish not able to apply themselves to any thing yet are crafty and deceitful these are miserable

idle sensual slothful gluttons without memory or care dissolute foolish impertinent obstinate untractable

weak base low fearful irresolute soft troubled mazed confused emty open bashful sheepish sneaking yet many times crafty and malicious these easily become a prey to low and mean companions

vain giddy harebrain'd inconstant such as employ their thoughts in things of no value as domitian in catching flies skipping from place to place neglectful haters of thinking inconsiderate heeding nothing after it is out of their hands
fantastical restless lightheaded carried away with every new object never considering what is best unconstant impatient changeable that work without affection or delight doing what they must to make an end rather then to do it well

curious scornful mockers jeerers taunters abusive reproachful tatlers charlatans who upon all occasions are ready to publish all they know to the prejudice of another delightful in making debates and mischief enemies of god and charity breeders of all petit factions

buffoons ridiculous flatterers apes rimers players wits airy light foolish


proud pretenders pedantick formal


contentious litigious quarrelsom blustering cowardly hectors froward perverse disloyal treacherous envious

ambitious arrogant fierce rash impudent violent

crafty sly double malicious cheats versuti and who can change their shape mine and discours according to their advantage

covetuous sordid

of angry persons some are sour harsh ill to please sturdy sullen intractable unadvisable a disposition mixed up of pride and melancholy peevish fixing upon the worst morose a delicate sort of wasps who are offended if every thing be not done the best way as they would have it
some mens anger vapoureth away in words clamor scolding reviling railing threatning
others say little but lay up revenge against an opportunity this is incident to superiors who conceive it below them to quarrel and who think themselves despised if every thing is not conformed to their will
others neither chide nor revenge but turn their wrath upon themselves as melancholic men do
pitty these for they have already the reward of their peaceable wrath who have a pleasure in their torment and a kind of satisfaction in their most agreeable discontent
but it were better for them to chide even without reason then store up this sooty humor which corrodes body and soul
some are quickly angry and quickly pacified hasty
some are quickly angry and difficultly pacified

some difficultly angry and difficultly pacified

some difficultly angry and easily pacified
the disposition of god himself

pragmatical prating impertinent giving judgment in every business without a fee without asking in every mans company unwelcome

mad wild furious brutish untamed terrible pertinacious cruel impious divelish cross precipitious despiteful revengeful tyrannical

solipsi valuing themselves only their own judgment and interest deceitful

melancholick jealous suspitious discontented interpreting every thing in the worst sense and every displeasure to be contemt affront and all men to be against and enemies to him

extravagant heteroclites alchymistical or astrologues diviners passionate lovers romantick
good dispositions also are of several sorts

subtil sharp piercing ready vigilant attentive to business sagacious

argute acute quick in giving answers and reparties resolving doubts and speculative questions inventive

facetious merry cheerful gay jovial undefined span alphabet

wise prudent judicious that examine things to the bottom able to discern and judge of things alike sage grave practical experienced that know opportunity

free noble generous bountiful meek peaceable quiet moderate magnificent


bold resolute free in reprehending others

and speaking their own minds back'd with reason hardy in difficult enterprises brave warlike valiant sensible of honour


stable magnanimous constant patient in adversities and businesses

industrious thinking ingenious universal

religious and devout

there is also great mixture and composition of these sometimes contraries seeming equally eminent in the same person
procopius saith of justinian juxta malignus erat deceptu facilis cujus ingenium pravum fatuum dixeris
dissimulabat ipse fraudibus omnium expositus
temperamentum insolitum cum ex contrariis constet
inconstans amicis inimicis inexorabilis avarus contentiosus novarum rerum cupidus ad scelera facile ad optima nullis suasionibus moveri poterat
yet is not this temper so unusual as procopius supposeth
for most men mistake a vice for a seemingly like but virtue
as pride for greatness of spirit hectorisme for valour cunning for wisedome which are really contraries
and indeed concerning young men and all others as women persons who follow their present apprehensions and impetus without much considering their actions or rectifying their inclinations by reason it is oftentimes hard to discern whether they be virtuous or vitious which is not so concerning those who are habituated for then all virtues go together as well as all vices
and those constellations are easily discovered by their own light
but natural virtues are often accompanied with such natural vices as are habitually contrary
as meekness is often joined with faithfulness and then it proceeds from want of spirit and apprehension

whereas habitual or acquisite meekness hath perhaps an inclination to sloth but hath mortified and bridled it
and every virtue appeareth and sheweth it self when necessity or fitting occasion requires it
so gravity in a child and those who being old are yet children in understanding is accompanied with dulness formality pride and censoriousness because it proceeds from want of mettle not from choice and seeks to justify and shrow'd that defect by finding fault with others
whereas true and laudable gravity is opposed only to levity and folly
so natural civility and courtesy is joined with effeminacy severity with implacability and the like


climats also and divers other accidents produce various inclinations not that any country produceth only one inclination but only more of one then another
so all of one age are not alike inclined tho most of them are and more in youth then age because the manners are then least artificial
will set down therefore and because most to our purpose inclinations of youth that the educator may in some measure be able to judge which are imperfections of the age and therefore likely to fall off when his charge arrives to maturity
only this caution ought to be observ'd that he humor or encourage not his charge in any of them for that is to perswade him to be a child alwaies
and that if he be in any of them exorbitant the fault then seems to be of the person not of the age which happens very frequently and therefore requires more care and a more early and efficacious remedy in the edication

young men then being guided by sense nature and passion not reason experience or discretion are inconstant and unsetled
for the sense being easily tired with the enjoiment of its object and the soul being made for somthing better not finding satisfaction in things sensible they conceive fastidiousness of the present and a desire to change and this is necessary for their condition that they may not obstinately and fixedly resist as old men commonly do the introducing of such habits as are necessary to the perfecting their faculties and making them happy
for tho their passions be eager and sensuality predominant yet their resistance is strongest at the beginning afterwards they with patience are brought off their natural inconstancy suggesting advantages to the director
for their present thoughts being vented they are at as a fish when wearied brought tamely to your hand therefore also you may hope well of most of them but be confident of none
hence also it cometh that with less reluctance they embrace such knowledges as do not thwart their pleasures and senses but of morality and prudence they are less capable and that in sickness when sensuality fails they are easiliest wrought upon
therefore also are they open and free easily discovering their thoughts and inclinations
eager also hasty unadvised sudainly resolving and as violently pursuing what they resolve for a little time
quicquid volunt valde volunt
stomacful also as not tamed by adversity or necessity
they are also taken with shows gallantry in cloathing desirous of what they see and weary of what they possess ambitious

to do what they cannot or should not but neglectful of what they ought and can
therefore gladly would they be learned but not study be excellent but not take pains consequently expensive easily seduced negligent careless fearless forgetful improvident and credulous desirous of honor and making a shew of excelling in beauty clothes of getting the victory at play and gaming yet valuing honour more then gain wanting experience they are angry fierce enemies of thinking and consideration and therefore rather affecting bodily exercises at which they labour and sweat without measure
full of hope also catching at appearances gay merry laughers modest bashful because ignorant pittiful loving their companions and and follies more then riches the want whereof they value not because they know not their value therefore not looking beyond the present nor avoiding ill consequences
imitative also for the soul being a blank paper and naturally desiring to be furnished greedily imbibes what it sees before it and this is that faculty with which god indued them on purpose that they may learn and advance in knowledge and wisedom
children speak nothing but what they hear and do nothing but what they see hence they are generally addicted to designing acting

such then being the conditions of young persons those who have the contrary are to be feared and well look'd after especially the sly reserved close who are also commonly cunning and malicious for this reservedness proceeds either from pride conceit of their own abilities

and unwillingness to be taught or from evil designs for who strives to conceal what he cares not who knows or from jealousy that other persons counsel them not for the best
these do usually guide themselves by words that seem to them accidentally spoken whereby they are easily ensnared and ruined
for no man being able to bear the burden of his own thoughts and these having no friend or confident they have no other course to steer
they will with all patience hear your advice and reprehension when they are resolved nothing shall work upon or alter their purposes
sometimes they will take notice of so much as serves to their own designs and misinterpret and detort what you say even contrary to your intention
these persons are commonly seized by flatterers mistresses or at best fall into low and mean courses
it is difficult to cure this malady yet ere they know their strength threats and punishment do them good or accidental recommendation of such to their conversation who may humor them by counterfeiting the same inclinations and complying with them till by little and little they can shew them the great advantage of freedom and openness

it hath bin also the observation of learned men that the sad melancholick and querulous hardly advance to any great proficiency
praecipuè vitentur tristes omnia deplorantes quibus nulla non causa in querelas placet sen neque illum tristem semperque demissum sperare possum crectae circa studia mentis fore
quint
querulousnes often proceeds from some inward debility of body as sharp humors of some part or the like

impudence is commonly a forerunner of debauchery violence contemt of laws also of heedlesness forgetfulness slowness to learning and wisedom
confidence is the medium betwixt it and bashfulness
tis observed in the life of emanuel philibert duke of savoy that when a child he had the confidence to speak to any person as he did to charles that great emperor but if what he said was not approved he pressed it not nor was offended when denied which seems indeed to be the true notion of modesty and confidence to express his mind freely yet entirely submitting himself to the judgment of his superiors

bashfulnes on the contrary is an evil weed but sign of a fruitful and good indoles
care must be had that in weeding it we extirpate not modesty
a bashful man is not his own master nor useth his own judgment but is by others boldness and the more impudent have more power over him
tis also an evil guardian of youth betraying it contrary to its own desire and inclination to the worst men who hurry it to evil actions and places
how many have lost their estates honors and lives because they were ashamed to distrust a man invites you to drink to game to rob to be bound for him cast of that foolish modesty deny him
an impudent flatterer comes to eat upon you he begs an horse a ring a garment give to the deserver not the beggar
some are so bashful as not to send for a good physician or chuse a good lawyer or governor because they are acquainted with a worse
begin betimes to break this fault in small matters exert

your liberty and judgment in denying to drink to accept a recommendation to lend money to admire every one you hear praised
and be constant not overcome with importunity another sort of impudence


there are two dispositions most incident to young persons of quality because they most resemble greatness of spirit tho in truth as much opposite to it as a dropsy to health of which shall speak somewhat more copiously these are anger and pride


an angry inclination in children discovers it self either by pettishness peevishness hastiness or by surliness and sullenness
tho all in youth of mettle are promt and seem to be angry naturally yet doth that shew it self in briskness and cheerfulness this in frowardness and incorrigibility
if this evil weed grow up with them in age and they be not broken of it betimes it makes them follow their own impetus despise counsel of friends and authority of superiors eripi sibi suum judicium etsi pravum non sinunt they defend and hug their error and had rather continue in it then change or repent by others advice
also because they are inconsiderate and furious they pursue their purposes good or bad with great force and concernment and therefore take not the aptest and most rational means to obtain them
for reason judgeth what is fit and just anger useth that as fit which it judgeth to be such which makes many good hunters for we are not angry with beasts few good soldiers
hence it comes that angry men are unwary easily deceived

not open and plain but exposed to them who are willing to take advantage
apt also to judge evil and hate other men upon slight occasions therefore are they not fit for friendship also uneven and unequal in their conversation many times also inexorable unsociable and tyrannical and their discourses runs much upon oaths and curses
many are the causes of angriness sometimes a choleric humor from their nativity or adventitious so we see families very subject to it but most commonly it proceeds from weakness of judgment
and generally the more impotent the subjecter to it as children women aged sickly in adversity or such as are also passionate
so we are more testy and angry when weary when watched or any other trouble upon us as a thorn in a finger breeds a feaver in the whole body
some are angry out of choice thinking it a piece of grandezza and that it makes them feared and respected
others by an evil custome being by their parents or educators indulged their own wills who at first not suffering others to contradict them at length neither dare they themselves

because this passion admits no counsel as other passions do but is as when a man sets his own house on fire all full of tumult and confusion that no orders can be heard or obeyed it is difficultly cured
in age it is remedied either by afflictions and crosses which providence bestows upon such persons as he loves or by prudent considerations such as these
because it springs commonly from small matters a word a jest a taunt a neglect endeavour to

pass by pardon and get quit of the occasions examine no faults too curiously chaw not nor reflect upon them argue not nor consider what other men will think or say for that blows and kindles the flame
neither desire great much difficult or rare things nor desire vehemently be as indifferent to all things as is possible and make use of common things rather then appropriate them to your self that and mine are great sticklers for anger
when you are in a fit reflect upon your self and your inner constitution see how the whole frame is disordered it is a passion even in the external as deformed as dangerous and either conquer it which after you have done sometimes the victory to a vigilant person is much easier or at least defer what your passion promts you to do for whatever is done in anger may also be done with judgment
for discretion saith not do not punish a faulty servant but do it prudently
some endeavor to suppress and quench it by violence but then it is apt to ferment either into melancholy or malice and envy

the education also of choleric persons is not less difficult except they be menaged when very young for then their humor may be broken by force and punishment but when they begin to understand their strength fair means must be used for fear of breaking also their spirit and while we cure the angry man we make him soft and lazy
for this passion and spirit are many times so twisted together that it is difficult to distinguish the actions of one from those of the other and consequently to

pluck up one without destroying the other
it is in vain to admonish or reprehend when the passion is violent for at best tis but as burning feathers under the nose of one in a fit of the falling sickness which may perhaps raise him up but cannot cure him
but when he is sober furnish him with good remedies and considerations against a time of necessity as men do when they fear a siege and expect no relief from abroad
or check it with another passion as with shame or fear or joy
indeed cheerfulness and moderate pleasure clear up the spirits and tho sadness and anger differ yet are they much alike in their causes and the same medicines are good for both


pride is many times grafted upon anger and is so like to it that it is not easy to discern which operations proceed from which cause
it is grounded in an error of the understanding a vain and false opinion of his own excellency above others and above the truth
in youth it discovers it self by contemt of others ingratitude injuriousness accepting all honor respect and officiousness as due and deserved but paying none therefore conversing more willingly with inferiors and domineering over them also neither is a proud man familiar or friendly to any but flatterers to whom he easily becomes a prey
his care is not to do well but to seem so and therefore he is ashamed to confess a fault error ignorance or inferiority to learn or be taught to be chid or corrected
instead of amendment he is sullen and dogged
he is seldome free from envy and therefore impatiently hears the praises of another especially

his equal but he swells looks big struts vapors and boasts to shew what he thinks himself to be he is displeased hateth and revengeth if not treated according to his merit
comparing himself with others tis to his own advantage looking only upon their errors and aggrandizing them into faults and vices but upon his own virtues which are all heroical
especially prying into the actions of superiors whom he imagines to usurp upon him who deserves and can menage all things better then they
therefore if in power he becomes imperious tyrannical opiniastre impatient if every thing correspond not to his desires but if he fall into misery as commonly such do being more exposed to it by reason of their high valuing of themselves he is low vile cowardly and dejected
his great badge is singularity and his discours runs much upon we mine
this being a fault of the mind and not radicated in the temper of the body is reduced to equanimity by mortification of his own conceits and fancies either by punishments by reason and good counsel or conversing much with strangers or by the method taken by god almighty to humble him by others resisting despising and crossing him

have not observed that any physiognomical signs are infallible not tho many of them concur in the same indication and tho many famous authors and proverbs in all languages seem to authenticate them
for indeed the temperature of the body seems no otherwise to be the cause of the actions of the soul or person then as the temper of the axe is the cause

of cutting to which many other things as figure weight motion are required as well as it and yet all together are but the instrument of the man who by greater strength dexterity can work better with another sort of a worse tool and can make one advantage remedy another disadvantage
we see also that study and experience give more force to the soul then any disposition whatsoever of the body even as temperance labour make the body more obedient all which are great testimonies of the souls spirituality
tis commonly set down by authors that tall and strong men are of small understanding and courage that it is a sign of wit to have a curiouc tast and delicate stomack which indeed proceeds sometimes from the weakness of that faculty by too much intentive study and many such like which it is in vain to repeat since it is not difficult to shew that some of contrary dispositions have the same signs and of contrary signs to ingenuity are yet ingenious
seneca saith of claranus ep
inique se gessit natura talem animum malè collocavit aut fortasse voluit ho ipsum ostendere posse ingenium fortissimum ac beatissinium suh qualibet cute latere
et videtur in exemplum editus non deformitate corporis foedari animam
the like is verified of the president pedro gasca that recovered to the king of spain peru almost wholly revolted and of many more in our memory
yet thus much willingly grant that the passions discover themselves almost inevitably by the countenance because they being sudain and violent mutations in the soul cause the like also in the spirits which shew themselves through the skin or in the motions

also of the exterior members
but it is not so with the inclinations and dispositions which are by our own industry and habituations turned now into natural and impress no such violent or extraordinary motions in any part either of spirits or body


more trust is to be had to such other signs as seem to be the flowers which preceed and pretend some smell of the fruit it self
these then promise virtue modesty obedience advisableness compassionateness loving virtue in others and consorting with such cheerfulness aptness to friendship impatience till reconciled to any he offended mildness humility
those who are apt to shed tears are of a softer and lovinger disposition as those who cry and shed no tears prove commonly stubborn
signs of nobleness and generosity are to confess a fault rather then tell a ly or frame a cobweb excuse to be ashamed to be overcome in any laudable study or exercise not to be angry when justly reproved or corrected moneri posse ac velle summa virtus est to do more for honor then reward not to be easily discouraged or despond but to be more sprightly to desire difficult emploiments to pass by small offences not to deride others defects to be more ready to excuse then aggravate faults of his companions lastly to be grateful especially to his masters teachers and servants
signs of a capacity for sciences are attention to what he goes about demanding the reasons of things
by the way asking questions very much discovers the ingeny of a child for to ask many is a sign of curiosity and wit to ask vain and impertinent

ones or the same over again or not to stay for an answer of folly and inconsiderateness material and pertinent ones of judgment and discretion
why is the great question of knowledge not to be satisfied with a slight answer sagacity and much thinking not talkative but reflecting wardly meditating with and entertaining himself
primum argumentum compositae mentis posse consistere secum morari
good imitation of what he sees
if he have so much confidence of his parts as to hope with industry to conquer every thing but without labour to do nothing well if he have a strong faithful memory for things tho not for words if a rational methodical and regular understanding
as democritus seeing protagoras when a youth to bind up a fagot orderly and to the best advantage conceived him fit to be a scholar

and cimabue rationally conceived great hopes of giotto bondone when being a poor boy and keeping his fathers sheep he saw him designing one of them upon a brick
afterwards he became the restorer of that whole art and the famousest man of his age
a child that delights in tormenting and vexing either beasts or men as the daughter of caligula that let her nails grow to scratch her companions and is of an evil perfidious and bestial nature

delighting in gallantry commonly portends lowness and weakness of spirit as have those women who have nothing but their outside to entitle them to humanity
but slovenliness

if it proceed from negligence if he be careless in other things especially of concernment is a very ill sign ad morem discincti vivere nattae
but if from particular neglect of delicateness as too low and mean tis a good sign cave tibi male cincto puero
a sign of timorousness and effeminacy is to indulge divers fancies and to pretend to see imaginations and spectra things which valiant men are seldom troubled withal as also to pretend antipathy to divers sorts of meats and timorousness is the prologue to craft and dissimulation
unseasonable gravity many times indicates slowness to sciences negligence and weak memory
quickness of wit is in danger to usher in pride contemt abuse of others and neglect of study
acuteness and sagacity is often accompanied with anger and precipitiousness
such also if students are apt to fall into needless curiosities factions and heresies
for they search not to the bottom but having principles think to work out the rest by the dexterity of their wit
is alwaies subject to flatterers
distinguish between softness and meekness the more soft the less understanding the more meek the greater generosity and nobleness of spirit a soft man hath no anger or gall a meek man bridles and masters it
huffing and swaggering like bottled drink commonly shews want of spirit for it is but froth that makes that noise and presently such become vapid and distastful


we must take heed of thinking any of these imperfections or faults incurable because according to a natural inclination or if a child

be not exactly such a one as we would have him that he must be treated as the brachmans did their children whose indoles they disliked abandon them in the woods to the wild beasts or as the inhabitants of madagascar who expose all their children born upon a friday
turpiter desperatur quicquid fieri potest saith quintilian
illud desperandum est posse nos casu bonam mentem influere laborandum est ut verum dicam ne labor quidem magnus est si modo animum formare incipimus antequam durescat pravitas ejus
sed nec indurata despero
nihil est quod non expugnet pertinax opera intenta ac diligens cura
sen ep
let the industrious and skilful educator make many trials and divers experiments as physicians do before they give a determinate prognostic

now of cures some are general
as to make them know their infirmity and that it is an infirmity and
that they be willing to be cured
for it is not as in corporeal diseases when the body is necessitated by connexion of causes to undergo and suffer the malady incumbent
but here the soul is in its own power subject to it self only and its own will and that directed by the understanding
wherefore the first step to a cure is to convince by reason that they do ill to acknowledge their disease the desire to have it cured follows naturally
so that it is in the power of reason to rule absolutely over the affections and dispositions of the soul
but because reason sometimes is misled or obstinately mistaken almighty god hath given us his holy religion and his spirit to govern reason also and render every

thought obedient to faith
so that in religion lies the universal and never failing remedy of all the evils of the soul
but many times particular and topical ones are also to be applied
a child when he begins to go refuseth immediately to be assisted so when the will begins to follow its own choice it then also begins to scorn a guide the appetite of liberty being stronger then that of security
great industry therefore and discretion is requisite to turn it the best way endeavouring as physicians to introduce the contrary of what is amiss and supply what is defective to coerce and discountenance the bold and impertinent to encourage the soft and modest severe to the merry cheerful to the melancholic
waken the taciturn with questions and silence the loquacious with baffling fallacies
bridle the too forward and eager and spur up the lazy and slothful


some there are who are lazy and unindustrious to study yet very active and sprightly in bodily exercises these many times are fitter for other emploiments then learning
others are to all purposes slow and sawntring and these are to be cured with bodily labor
first make them play run leap afterwards bring them to study
for there seems to be a moisture clogging their spirit which must be first shaken of for if they be indulged they will become more sleepy even till chang'd into dormice
then never let them want work yet not much at a time but be careful that what you command them be sedulously performed
there are also who are pettish peevish hard to please and are alwaies lean maigre and consumtive which

proceeds from a sharp thin humor easily exasperated and to such a degree as may be very prejudicial
it is best therefore to deal with those gently and smoothly the default being more in the body then the mind and not put them upon crabbed intricate vexatious or intentive studies nor be too rigorous in exacting an account of them
it would be worth labor to try whether such medicines as dulcify the blood would not profit them
like to these are they who seem rough harsh regardless of civility and not easily mingling conversation
these if not such in extremity when mellowed by experience prove better then the complaisant and amicable
keep this sour disposition to study virtue and knowledge and tho he grumble and repine be content so as he doth his work and he is in less danger of temtation becomes more solidly virtuous and lasts much the longer
as the wine which pleaseth in the cuve must be drunk in the must
they are also fitter for friendship then the compliant for these are equal to all and the greatest interest can be gain'd in them is but civility the other chuse their company and fix upon the best
this sourness proceeds ordinarily from a brisker and fiercer spirit not willing to go in the ordinary routte nor follow the track of those he undervalues but loves the generous tast of liberty
whereas the soft wax that melts with every ones fingers keeps no impression
but if this harshness be extream and increase with age consider whether it grow from pride and then the root is to be digged up or from natural inclination and then let him frequent facetious and merry company let him converse with strangers with

whom he must stand upon his guard
womens acquaintance also if discreet persons is not ill for this disease
with the froward and perverse begin to use severity betimes and master him before he know his own strength
let him not be humored or gain by his sturdiness but let him know by experience that his tricks are not only undecent but vain also and uneffectual
imitate god almighty who to the meek sheweth himself gentle but to the perverse froward that he may humble the high looks and thoughts of the proud
for indeed this sullen humor which against all reason will be guided only by its own opinions and will brook no contradiction is the effect of the greatest pride and is too frequently found in persons of quality when cockered by parents or flattered by servants
when they are children rough usage is good for them but afterwards it irritates them the more
then if sober reasoning open not their eyes they must be as wild trees often transplanted and removed into strange company
for where unacquainted they dare not shew their humor especially before such as will not brook their impertinencies but answer them with laughter scorn or somewhat more severe
indeed generally all bad dispositions are reclaimed by conversation and the example of other persons especially such as are eminent in the virtue you would produce
afflictions also have a wonderful force which are discreetly to be menaged by the educator for then the humors are ripe for purgation

chap
of parts or capacities in general and of their diversity and how to be ordered and rectified
hitherto we have spoken of dispositions in order to the regulation of life and manners
in the next place we must treat of what concerns knowledge and science
and in order to this we must resume that there are three faculties of which we shall speak by and by more copiously naturally implanted in us wit judgment and memory
concerning which that you may the better understand my intention will set down the most common and usual differences of capacities
and first take notice that the goodness of wit is seen in first quick apprehending what is proposed and ready pertinent and copious invention
a memory then is counted excellent when it quickly embraceth and long retaineth what is committed to it
and that judgment is commended which subtilly compareth and accurately discerns between things that are like
next that wits some are ordinary others extraordinary
extraordinary such are


imaginative persons who
either have their fancy so volatil and skipping from one thing to another that they cannot fix long upon any one subject
sometimes this proceeds from levity

and impatience of the labor of thinking non est enim minor lassitudo animi quam corporis sed occultior sometimes from melancholy
and such a degree there is of this as is incurable but only by medicine that is frenzy and madness
or who have great and ready variety of fancies or suggestions but little of judgment
even as cisterns whereinto the water continually flows are never clear
these catch at and sit down with their fullest apprehensions without weighing or considering the contrary and are called phantastical
the best way to cure both these is to fix them by setting them to mathematicks geometry especially where they are not suffered to tast a second dish till they have perfectly digested the former and by employing their memory
disputations also in public are very profitable


precocious persons whom the proverb hath branded to be of small duration
perhaps because these sine tempers are usually less strong and durable their spirits either exhaling and spending or fixing and thickning
so that like corn upon stony ground they spring up upon a suddain shew all they can do are in admiration for their forwardnes but wanting root they bring forth yellow and emty eares before the harvest and so vanish
thus hermogenes the orator was heard with admiration at
years old at
with laughter
yet by the good leave of the proverb have not seen many of precocious parts except by their own or educators fault miscarry
for many times it happens that those persons seeing their advantage in the race above their companions

slacken their speed betaking themselves to pleasure and idlenes or as they say of rablais who not finding his good parts and serious studies encouraged according to his expectation abandoned himself to buffoonery
these pregnant wits being much courted for their plausible conversation endanger their ruin from those who pretend to woe their friendship
it would be better for them to consider that they are not matched only with those who started at the same time with them but with those also who had advantage and that he is to be crowned not who doth as well as others but as well as he can
but because of the prejudice most men have against precociousnes it will not be amiss to shew some late examples of those who begun betimes have proved admirable and lasted a long while

let no man therefore slacken his endeavor towards these early fruits nor let the young man himself despond but rather which is a great truth say that god almighty hath thus furnished him to be an ornament to his creation and an assistance to mankind
let the educator also be more careful of him and not leave him to himself for there will come cold frosts and hails loathings and tediousnes of labor which if not well defended will hazard his dropping off
the subtil and delicate edge if encountring too great difficulties is in danger to turn in such cases therefore let them not be tired out but assisted to expedite themselves with ease and delight
propose to them high and noble studies but give them your hand keep them continually running but not at their full speed lest they grow weary and loath and abandon them
and indeed it is a much greater difficulty and to direct and conduct great parts then mean ones
parts are indifferent to good or bad and great parts to great good or great evil and all great evil as well as great good proceeds from them
and which way soever they go they are not easily diverted their abilities supplying them still with sufficient defence for themselves
maxima ingenia saith seneca miror timeo mediocria probo as he is in less danger who walks on a plain then he who dances on a rop
minutius in the preface to his paradoxes tells us of one creighton a scottishman who at
years old when he was killed by order of the duke of mantua understood twelve languages had read over all the poets and fathers disputed de omni scibili and answered ex tempore in

verse ingenium saith scaliger prodigiosum admiratione magis quam amore dignum ei judicium defuit
principes solent illa ingenia amare magis quam bene doctos
such persons if not well regulated which as said is difficult become many times proud and conceited angry and precipitious scornful and presumtuous many times also light and freakish
and truly mean and indifferent or even low wits have more pleasure and satisfaction then these
for trusting to their parts they neglect study and exercise and so are easily surprised and discovered when either not fully apprehending the question and the consequences of an opinion or themselves not well disposed for discourse


there is another sort who have not so great parts but have a volubility of language are able upon a suddain to speak de omni ente non ente and of them too pro con
this passeth amongst women and ordinary people for eloquence and great parts but amongst discreet and serious persons for impertinence
and the rather because these men chuse to talk commonly of things they understand not or are most improper and unknown to the company and of them also without order or method and have when at a non plus certain common places to retire to lest they should fall into that terrible disgrace of having no more to say


some persons tho very few have a strong indoles or inclination to and abilities for some particular science strong say for a slight fancy to one more then another is not

straightways as they call it a genius to such a thing for most men are not altogether indifferent to all sorts of learning tho card du perron could never observe that he was more affected to or more apt for one science then another and yet may arrive to a great perfection in that whereto they are least disposed
but if his genius lead him so strongly to any one science that he be unapt to others it is by all means to be humored
ne tentes saith quintil quod effici non potest nec ab eo quod quis optime facit in aliud cui minus est idoneus eum transferas
it is reported of ch clavius that being found by the jesuits under whose education he was very unapt for learning and ready to be sent back to his parents to be some other way emploied before they would quite abandon him one of them resolved to try him in mathematics wherein in a short time he profited to admiration and grew very famous and eminent in those studies
or if his genius be accompanied with a noble and generous wit let great endeavor be used to teach him other sciences and if that he is inclined to be not the noblest to take him off from it also
omnino iniquum est nobiliora ingenia dehonestari studiis minoribus
yet many times it is difficult to bring such off their inclination as in monsieur pascal out of the preface to whose last book will transcribe some passages very memorable both concerning the precociousnes of his wit and strong inclination to mathematics

monsieur pascal was observed in his childhood to have had an admirable understanding to pierce into the profundity and depth

of things and to discern solid reason from superficial words
in so much that when they offered him words only his understanding was restles and unsetled until he had discovered reason
at
years old at table having struck an earthen dish and observed it to make a sound which ceased as soon as touched with his hand he was very earnest to know the cause thereof and from that began to demand many other questions concerning sounds in so much that he made then a small but very ingenious treatise concerning sounds
this his strange inclination to ratiocination made his father fear that if he should give him any insight into geometry and mathematics he would be so much taken with them that he would neglect all other studies especially languages
he therefore resolved to hinder him to lock up all books of those sciences and not so much as to speak of them in his presence
but all this cautiousnes served only to excite his curiosity so that he often intreated his father to teach him mathematics or at least to tell him what they were
his father to satisfy him somewhat in general said they were sciences which taught how to make figures equal or proportional one to another and withal forbad him to speak to him or think any more of them
a command impossible for such a wit
for upon this hint he began to revolve them continually in his mind especially at his times of recreation
once especially being in a large hall where he used to divertise himself he began to make figures with a coal on the pavement as a circle a triangle of equal sides or of equal angles

and the like and this he did easily
afterwards he began to search out and make propositions
but all books and instruction being by his fathers diligence concealed from him he was forced to give names and definitions after his own invention
a circle he called a round a line a bar
after this he framed also to himself axiomes and upon them demonstrations after his own manner till he arrived to the
prop
his father surprizing him in this posture was mightily astonished when he heard him discourse and as it were analize his propositions
and hereupon by the advice of friends he put into his hands euclides elements which he read and comprehended at
years old with as great pleasure and facility as other children do romances he read and understood it all by himself without any master and advanced so much in that knowledg that a while after at paris he entred into the conferences of learned men held once a week concerning mathematical questions
thither he brought his own inventions examined others propositions and yet was all this knowledg only the product of his leasure hours
at
years old he composed a treatise of conics which monsieur descartes would not believe but to have bin the work of his father endeavoring to procure reputation to his son
at
years old he invented that instrument of arithmetic which is in print and at
having seen the experiments of torricelli he also added to them a great number of his own

this example of monsieur pascal is very extraordinary as was that of pet
damianus to piety

who being a boy and almost starved and naked by the churlish and unnatural usage of his brother yet having found a piece of mony not regarding his own necessities he bestowed it upon a priest to pray for his fathers soul
most men are fit for many sciences and that inclination which they have to one more then another is ordinarily from their ability to perform one more then another as memory is for some wit for others courage and bodily strength for others or from their own imitation or others recommendation by word or example to one thing more then another or from some external and accidental effect they have seen or known of any one or some such like
but tho all men have not or scarce any have all faculties excellent in an equal degree it will be the teachers care and educateds endeavor to better that wherein they are most defective but so all waies that you conduct them by that way they will go
too much as forced grounds badly correspond to our hopes
unusquisque suum noscat saith tully ad quas res aptissimi erimus in iis potissimum elaborabimus
seneca saith that virgil was as unfortunate in prose as cicero in verse
but am rather perswaded that both the one and the other proceeded from want of practise
for tasso was eminent in both and ovid was an acute and eloquent declamator as well as a fluent poët
and sen
cont
stories of him that being importuned by his friends for liberty to expunge three verses out of his writings he yeilded upon condition he might except three and named those they would have blotted out


besides what have already mentioned there are in teaching sciences two great rules to be observed

begin not to teach a new science till your scholar understand all that is necessary to it as not rhetoric till he know grammar and the latin tongue for so he will learn both more and cheerfuller
whereas the mind cannot to purpose intend many things at once
tho such studies as have correspondence and affinity may well be conjoined for the comparing illustrates both and variety takes off the tediousnes
see quint


be not too hasty with your scholar advance him not too fast lay the foundation sure and stable
for he that eats faster then he digests breeds crudities and work for the physician to purge away
besides he that understands goes on cheerfully and securely
which take to be the reason why men of age make greater progress in learning then children
jul scaliger began not to learn greek till
years old and then mastered it in a very few months as he did french and gascon in three
pet
damianus learn'd not to read till mans estate yet proved one of the eminentest scholars of his time
balaus entred so late upon the law that they told him he intended to be an advocate in the other world

teach not too much at once but take your lesson in pieces let him spell before he read invent in english before in latin confusedly before in order then chuse the best put it in order turn it into latin and then file and polish it
it is reported of virgil that he first composed his matter in prose then turn'd it into verse afterwards reformed those verses to fewer and last of all revised and amended

them
to these rules must add that he be taught things necessary or useful
such are


languages
the bulla aurea tit
commands all the sons of electors to be brought up from
years old in the italian and slavonian languages and to perfect that study before
that is prescribed to the german nobility but for ours it seems requisite that they learn the latin tongue so much as to understand an author readily to write and speak it competently and if they go abroad the more readily they speak it the better
other of the learned languages are ornaments but not so necessary as the modern and of these theirs with whom we have most converse are the most useful


it is requisite that he learn to speak perspicuously decently and persuasively which is rhetoric
to understand the difference of stiles epistolary historical and for orations in all the three kinds
also to compose and pronounce them hansomly at least in his own language
it is better also if he understand and practise tho not much except he have a considerable dexterity in it poetry without which no man can be perfect orator but his fancy as well as expressions will be low and mean
poetry warms the imagination makes it active and promt to soar to the top of parnassus it emboldens to the use of a lofty metaphor or confident catachresis
besides accustoming the stile to measure gives insight judgment and readines also in oratorical number
it teacheth also to chuse good words to consider weigh

and pierce better into what we read to take notice of the most delicate artifice and discern sparks of diamonds
so that it is observed that when poetry is despised other sciences also are in the wane
one great piece of poetry and perhaps the most familiar and proper is the dramatic in which could they be of good subjects well garbled and discreetly handled it would not misbecome our young gentleman to have his part


musick think not worth a gentlemans labor requiring much industry and time to learn and little to loose it
it is used chiefly to please others who may receive the same gusto from a mercenary to the perfection of many of whom few gentlemen arrive at a very easy rate
should rather advise singing especially if you fear him subject to a consumtion which besides that it strengthens the lungs modulates the voice gives a great grace to elocution and needs no instrument to remove or tune


to discourse pertinently and rationally is also necessary
this is logic which tho taught in every colledg and every one learneth yet do very few attain perfection in it
error is so well disguised verity is also sometimes so deep and our cord so shallow that it requireth very much experience to be able readily to discover the truth and dissolve a sophism
these knowledges already mentioned are but foundations upon which all sciences are built but themselves appear not in the edifice
for they are nothing but regulating and perfecting the actions

of our natural faculties not informing them with any new or extrinsecal accedent they are disposing and preparing the table that good resemblances may be drawn upon it
they are necessary that a man may make the best advantage of his natural parts in apprehending of other arts and knowledges
some indeed have bin of opinion that a gentleman needs no more but what nature hath given him
licinius and a great general in our own times were so illiterate that they could scarce write their own names
lewis xi desired his son might understand no more latin then qui nescit dissimulare nescit regnare
and what harm had it bin if he had permitted his son charles viii to have learned somewhat of latin he could at the worst but have done as he did that is commit his busines to others and not be able to discern good counsel from evil and interessed
but it seems that prince had but one trick in and that a very mean one more latin might have taught him others and not to have needed that so base and unworthy of a prince
as it did those great monarcks who were practised in them julius augustus and the rest of that family whereof nero to his dishonor was the first that stood in need of borrowed eloquence seneca making his speeches for him trajan hadrian aurelius and that miracle of princes severus alexander
hannibal writ the lives of two famous generals and alexander slept with homer under his pillow
will not muster up any more examples they are infinite
learning sciences are not necessary to every man nor all to any man yet are they useful to all tho not to

all equally
but that is best which is most beneficial and proper for every ones condition of life
learning and study makes a young man thinking attentive industrious confident and wary an old man cheerful and resolved
tis an ornament in prosperity a refuge in adversity an entertainment at home a companion abroad it cheers in solitude and prison it moderates in the height of fortune and upon the throne
in these parts of the world we seem to run after sciences and think them to be all things whereas the great and universal busines of our life especially active is wisdom prudence noblenes and liberty of spirit
sciences are necessary to mans life and professors of them are requisite to instruct such whom it concerns to know and exercise them in other persons wisdom is the chiefest and what can be spared from acquiring that let it be bestowed upon science
by the way take notice that these are not both the same that to be learned is not to be wise nor are sciences to be placed in the upper room notwithstanding the honor and wealth to be acquired by them
they are particular means for the obtaining particular ends and dispose a man very much for wisdom also but the great universal art is tu regere imperio populos to excel others in virtue prudence and those abilities which render him more useful in the general concernments of mankind
besides sciences are easily learned being taught by routte and course but wisdom requires greater advertency and more accurate observation which all are not able to learn and very few to teach
but if a young man be industrious and of good parts there is time enough for both sciences and wisdom

those are more properly the emploiments of youth this of maturer age
he may obtain those before he be well capable of this mean a sufficient perfection in them not so much as is required for a professor but so much as is necessary or requisite for a gentleman
nor will the acquisition of them hinder his progress in this but much further and advance it
both because of the of the faculty and of the affinity between both knowledges
amongst sciences therefore recommend to him


the practise of discoursing or the seeking after truth by evidence which is mathematics geometry especially
mean not a superficial taking upon trust the propositions or the practical part only or instruments these spoil make not mathematicians but the high road of demonstration
this is the first part of the building that appears above ground it is practising them in the greatest instances of invention that we know it fixeth the fancy it accustometh to thinking and enquiring after truth in all discourses
analytica is the gage of a mans parts and algebra the pinnacle of argumentation
only let it be remembred that advise it here as a piece of education not a profession
would not have a gentleman give up himself to it for it makes him less fit for active life and common conversation except he well consider that he cannot find his demonstration in all matters except he can be content with such evidence as the subject affords and not despise a proof because he can say somewhat against it and except he can apply his mind and intention to things as they are in the world and

not rack them to the accurate model of his exactly regulated imagination


natural philosophy but especially ethics and politics should also not be neglected
which will dispose him when he comes to greater maturity to comprehend the laws especially of his own and neighboring nations and their government
of which shall speak hereafter


yet one thing we lack
albertus magnus desired of god
years before his death that he might forget all that he had learned in those studies that he might intirely give himself up to devotion
the example also of monsieur pascal is very eminent

tho he was able as any man could be to pierce into the secrets of nature and actually did see very far into them yet more then ten years before his death he so well understood the vanity and nothingnes of all those kinds of knowledg and conceived such a distast against them that he could hardly endure men of parts should seriously discourse of or busy themselves in them from that time he alwaies professed that nothing besides religion was an object worthy an ingenious mans study that it was a proof of the lownes whereto we were thrown by the fall that a man should seriously fasten upon the search of such things as contribute little or nothing to his happines
wherefore his usual saying was that all those sciences produced no consolation in the times of affliction but that the knowledg of christianity was a comfort both in adversity

and defect of all other knowledg
he believed therefore tho there were some advantage or customary obligation to study things of nature and to be able to conceive and discourse rationally concerning them yet it was absolutely necessary not to prize them above their just value
and that if it were better to know and undervalue then be ignorant of them yet it were better to be ignorant of then know and overvalue them

the gentle spirit of petrarch also long before his death quitted his helicon and muses for mount olivet and divinity
card du perron kept not so much as any book of humanity tho formerly a great poet and orator either poetry oratory or history in his library
jo
picus mirandula extreamly repented his love verses so did bembus ronsard muretus laur
gacubaro and cavalier marini
and naugerius tho formerly a famous poet yet afterwards so much detested all licentious compositions particularly martial that every year he bought up a considerable number of such books and upon his solemnly burnt them
nonnus in penance for his dionysiaca paraphras'd the gospel of st john
pet
veliardus not being able to abolish the custome of reading the poets omnes poetas scriptoresque profanos evangelicos faciebat
omnia ad exaedificandam in timore domini juventutem accommodabat ut unde non pauci perniciem periculumque suis discipulis ferunt inde illi in salutem morum disciplinam compararet
orlan in vita fabri
these you will say did well to begin to disengage themselves of their riding posture when they came in sight of their home but that it will be difficult to perswade young

men coming into the world to follow these examples
this grant yet some time should be given to him that gives us all even in youth and the more the better and as before advised to the practise of religion in the very beginning so as they grow towards maturity would perswade them to the study of divinity even that decried study of
which the great earl of strafford and many other very wise persons and have themselves studied and to others recommended
theologia scholastica principi viro necessaria nam dum quaestiones suas discutiunt omnes subtilitates effugia suspiciones omnes denique ingenii machinas vires produnt
the writers of this do more exactly canvas and search out their subject then any others whatsoever
which partly might be the reason why monsieur pascal fell into such an utter dislike and loathing of his physical and mathematical studies in comparison of divinity
for tho he afterwards made that discourse of the roulet or cycloid yet all therein was found out by chance and almost without study and besides he intended it for another purpose far differing from mathematics
but if ever this study was necessary it is now much more certainly when some are ready by the study of nature to immerse god in the matter and with those impieties of democritus and epicurus to confound him with nature and others for want of this ballast in these unsettled times are driven upon rocks and sands by the ignorance of some and craft of others that lye in wait to deceive the betterminded but then themselves


and the best place and manner of learning these and all other arts and sciences or what belongeth to them take to be in the universities
and so hath bin the general opinion from the very beginning of learning
these were the schools of the prophets in gods church and such were athens alexandria and many other places among them that followed their own reason
for these were the great markets for learning here resided the best learned and greatest frequency of them here was emulation and mutual information in studies here were opportunities of discoursing studying and continual advance here were books privacy and all other necessaries for that purpose
and still to this day in all christendom is this observed every nation whether kingdom or makes the establishing and well regulating their universities one of the principal parts of their care
for from hence they draw able subjects for all professions and emploiments here they institute both in learning and manners the whole youth of the nation and the hopes and honor of the growing age
and therefore do the supreme magistrates by such great rewards and immunities encourage and procure the best professors and teachers in every art and faculty
and such rewards are needful to entice persons of great parts as such must be to such indefatigable and uncessant labor and study and to quit all the means of advancing themselves in the to serve the public
in these places you may find skilful men in all knowledges you desire some give their mind and time to languages others to sciences either to have a right and

large knowledg or comprehension of things whether the effects of nature or manner of her operations or of the sublimer and abstruser general propositions concerning the higher and noble entities and such as are not obliged to the laws of nature others to be able to express their knowledg and notions whether popularly by orations and speeches wherein they are frequently exercised or convincingly to learned men by their continual disputations to which they are educated
mean not that arguing and discoursing which a student useth with his own self to find out truth but that which comprehendeth both and the assistance also of others public and open argumentation pro con
this is it which brings a question to a point and discovers the very center and knot of the difficulty
this warms and activates the spirit in the search of truth excites notions and by replying and frequent beating upon it cleanseth it from the ashes and makes it shine and flame out the clearer
besides it puts them upon a continual stretch of their wits to defend their cause it makes them quick in replies intentive upon their subject where the opponent useth all means to drive his adversary from his hold and the answerer defends himself sometimes with the force of truth sometimes with the subtility of his wit and sometimes also he escapes in a mist of words and the doubles of a distinction whilst he seeks all holes and recesses to shelter his persecuted opinion and reputation
this properly belongeth to the disputations which are exercises of young students who are by these velitations and in this palaestra brought up to a more serious search of truth

and in them think it not a fault to dispute for victory and to endeavor to save their reputation not that their questions and subjects are concerning things of small moment and little reality yea have known some governors that have absolutely forbidden such questions where the truth was of concernment on purpose that the youth might have the liberty of exerting their parts to the uttermost and that their might be no stint to their emulation
but indeed in natural philosophy wherein the greatest liberty is given what is there that is not disputable and even they who most pretend to experiments will find it difficult to produce one new or confute an old universal proposition and when they shall discover one they will find it disputed both with contrary reasons and experiments
so true is that of salomon eccles

tradidit mundum disputationi eorum ut non inveniat homo opus quod operatus est deus ab initio usque ad finem
and of siracides ecclus

non est minuere neque adicere nec invenire magnalia dei
cum consummaverit homo tunc incipiet cum quieverit aporiabitur
there may be further discoveries as perhaps was the circulation of the blood and some others and with all thankfulnes we acknowledg and embrace their labors that endeavor such advancement but to lay new principles especially since the received are incorporated into all common speech and our languages are formed according to them and consequently all mens notions set according to them which will not be altered and extirpated by small fancies is a busines of an higher difficulty
besides that aristotle himself whom all universities christian have followed

about
years longer then any other of his maligners have continued theirs but the grecians and arabians much longer time was not a novice in natural history witnes those most learned works in that subject
yet did he write his philosophy conformable not contradictory to his knowledg in particulars and therefore it must needs be very difficult to overthrow that which is so well grounded which was the product of so much experience and by none but those who are better versed in that learning then himself
neither is his philosophy more notional then all sciences which are delivered in a synthetical a doctrinal method and begin with universal propositions
acknowledg indeed one point of education wherein wish our universities more defective then they are that which the ladies call breeding and accomplishment a fault incident to all these schools of learning even to athens it self for plutarch tells us that long before his time some persons wondred why those that went fine gentlemen to athens and very knowing after a year or two's stay there began to know nothing and the longer they staied the greater clowns they proved
a negligence incident to those who have their minds more emploied then their bodies and who converse not with the gallantry of the age


that you may judge the better of universities will set down the manner of instructing in forreign universities or also our own in former times without reflecting upon or judging our present practise
anciently in oxford and paris the two only general studies

for a long time on this side the alps suppose in the others too their reading was dictating and their learning writing those dictates of their master
card estouteville about
reformed this tedious and unprofitable way of teaching and brought in as it should seem the manner now generally used which is first an account of the former lectures then to read and write about half an hour then to explicate that about an equal time
experience since hath added an hour more for the scholars conferring one with another in circles in presence of their reader and disputing upon questions given them the reading before
the hour that remains the master begins another lecture explains it to them and gives them questions for their next disputations
yet the jesuits in portugal to ease their scholars also of much of the labor of writing dictates have printed a course of philosophy which they explain confer and dispute upon
and this seems the best way but whether introducible amongst us or if it be whether better then tutors reading privately in their chambers especially if tutors be diligent it is not fitting for me to determine


the true method of studying to render any one a learned man conceive not to be to trust to his memory aliud enim est meminisse aliud scire meminisse est rem commissam memoriae custodire at scire est sua quaeque facere nec ab alio exemplari pendere
and these differ as much as digesting our meat and reserving it in a cupboard
wherefore neither is it to be able to quote many authors nor tell their opinions nor to repeat

their pretty sentences or profound subtilties as neither to read many books nor to say them by heart is to be a scholar but to digest what is read and to be able to know where a difficulty lies and how to solve it to make it your own and to be able to satisfy your self and others in that which you conceive to be truth
first of all then propose to your self a subject never read at adventure the book newly come out or in fashion whatever subject it handles for that is commonly lost labor but read alwaies with design then shall you know where you are how far you have gone what is behind both of that science or of the whole encyclopaedia
having fixt upon your subject take an author a modern one and the learneder the better and consider first the latitude and method of your science and then begin with his first question upon which first use your own thoughts or at least yours together with his let your imagination loose both before and when you read discourse doubt argue upon and against and draw consequences from your author who is many times but a ladder to your own inquisitivenes
when you have found a difficulty which neither your own thoughts nor his writing do resolve make use of other authors of the same subject for what one wants another supplies your difficulty perhaps your author foresaw not another did
and by the citations of modern authors you will easily be directed where to look for satisfaction
when that question and the difficulties and solutions are fixed in your mind by sufficient meditation go to another and so forward

chap
xi
of invention memory and judgment and how to help better and direct them
it is not my purpose to intermeddle with any particular art or science in this discourse but only with such things as do not properly fall under or belong to any of them yet are generally required to them all
and first must reassume what before only mentioned that there are three faculties to be cultivated wit memory and judgment


wit the actions whereof are fancy or invention is in ordinary acception nothing else but a quicker apprehension of such notions as do not usually enter into other mens imaginations
it consists saith thesauro in
perspicacity which is the consideration of all even the minutest circumstances and
versability or speedy comparing them together it conjoins divides deduceth augmenteth diminisheth and in sum puts one thing instead of another with like dexterity as a jugler doth his balls
it differs very much from judgment that is more perspicacious this more profound that more quick this more stable that chiefly considers appearances this reality that produceth admiration and popular applause this profit and real advantage
ingenious men are commonly impatient

of thinking and therefore take appearances for reality and their fancy still suggesting new conceits suffers them not to weigh or compare reasons wherefore they are commonly unfit for busines their ability consisting in sudain apprehensions and quick expressions whereas tis only study and thinking that hatcheth and produceth all noble designs and actions
and if ingenious men do come to consider seriously or to deliberate they are able to say so much for either side that they have no resolution they dispute well but conclude nothing
consequently they are irresolute inconstant and unfortunate and their wit failing before they arrive at old age and not being furnished in their memory and judgment they become flat and contemtible
but if wit be joined with power it is very dangerous to the public
sapientia sine eloquentia parum prodest civitatibus eloquentia sine sapientia nimium plerunque obest prodest nunquam saith cie
de invent
think may truly add that all mischiefs in proceed from these wits for wise men will not disturb government and fools cannot
whereas the judicious man is fitted for any emploiment considers what dangers and evils may happen and avoids them consequently is prosperous brings about his designs advanceth himself and family
and the longer he lives the more doth his talent increase
in sum the one is best in a tavern or the other at a the one is a facetious companion the other a faithful friend the one a good droll the other a good patriot the one makes us merry the other wise
wit say some proceeds

from active spirits or a greater degree of heat in the brain the excess whereof produceth madnes and so difficult it is to determine what degree serves for one and what for the other that the proverb assigns them the same confines
and indeed the conceits of are nothing else but high and extravagant metaphors as that of one who fancied himself a and desired every one he met to blow him
another thought himself a
another took himself for a with a long nose the droppings whereof he called
others were cocks urinals
a lesser degree of madnes was that they called enthusiasm many times from some vapor or water out of the earth which was imagined to come from the gods and which created the most ingenious poets
who all pretending to that afflatus continually call'd upon the muses nymphs and presidents of those inspiriting places in the beginning of their poems
and they who are denied by nature this faculty and will not take the pains by study and exercise to prepare and fit themselves are wont to increase their heat or frenzy by wine which causeth a temporary madnes or by some high passion which hath the same effect as drunkennes
magna pars eloquentiae est dolor said seneca when he heard a dull orator declame most eloquently that day his son died
so polus the actor that he might more vively represent the grief of a father upon the body of his deceased son brought in an urn the ashes of his own son newly dead
this for one passion
so for anger si natura negat

facit indignatio versum
archilochus and hipponax two very bad poets yet for spite and rabbia to be revenged of two persons that injured them invented those doggrel sorts of verses iambics and scazons whose force they so well applied that their adversaries made away themselves
and for love let the smith of antwerp be witnes who being refused by his because of his dirty profession changed his hammers and anvil for pencils and tables and arrrived to be the famousest painter of his time
but to let these pass wit is the mother of facetiousnes conceits jests raillery satyricalnes which is almost synonymum to wit drollery quick reparties quaint metaphors and the like in conversation
of projects new inventions mechanical instruments
and in learning is the great nurse of poetry oratory musick painting acting and the like


judgment is the deliberate weighing and comparing of one subject one appearance one reason with another thereby to discern and chuse true from false good from bad and more true and good from lesser
which who so doth is a wise man beloved of god and reverenced of all good men
its parts consist
in circumspection or consideration of all circumstances advantages accidents
in sagacity or collecting much from little hints which requires both a great vivacity serenity and subtilty of spirit all these together make up solertia

in caution or weighing all things for and against the subject
and
providence or provision of futures what may and what may

not most probably fall out which is the height of human wisdom
a judicious man is stable solid serious looks after truth real advantage and happines is fit to govern and obey is not rash or inconstant believes not easily nor easily disbelieves but as his reason guides him
his discourse is not so plausible as solid useth reasons more then metaphors speaks to purpose and knows when to hold his peace
he is what every one strives but few arrive to be
this faculty is proper for all sciences that depend upon rational discourse and much thinking as divinity and the profound mysteries thereof natural philosophy and moral practical medicine law judicature and government in peace and war


memory is the calling to mind or recollecting of what hath bin before known and apprehended
they that excel in it are accounted many times greater clerks then wise men are able to cite many books and authors and their editions can tell their opinions and enterlace their discourse with ends of gold and silver
yet if not menaged by judgment their opinion or learning is of little force or esteem amongst knowing men who yet can gather many useful things out of their confusion
this faculty is necessary for lawyers whose learning lies in quotations and records and who number rather then weigh their authorities
tis also proper for learning languages criticismes philology antiquities for putting out commenting upon and making indexes to authors
it is a natural faculty and conspicuous even in children who by it learn

till they arrive to some considerable degree of understanding


it is commonly imagined that a great memory seldom accompanieth a great wit or a good judgment and that these three are incompatible one with another that they have divers habitations in and a divers temperature of the brain
whereas think the contrary is generally but not alwaies true
and thence is gathered an effectual argument that they are all menaged by one great agent the soul or spirit which is above temperature place and matter
that one man proves not excellent in all or many sciences proceeds not from the inhability of one or other faculty of the soul but either from the long time required to one study from want of industry every one being most ready to make use of and cultivate that wherein they have some natural advantage and to neglect the other or from the two great attachment men have to what they first master so that all following studies are cast into the mold of the first or lastly from a mistake for that memory is not so conspicuous except where wit and judgment are wanting
yet in these later times what persons have we seen eminent in all three faculties erasmus when a youth had all terence and horace by heart jos scaliger in
daies got by heart all homer the ilias containing verses and the odysses about the same number and in
months all the other greek poets
monsieur peiresk when a youth at school could repeat all ovids metamorphosis and justins history without book

card
bellarmin saith gallutius had such a memory ut quicquid legeret scriberetve statim ac subito reciperet quicquid recepisset fidelissimè constantissimèque retineret
paolo sarpi great memory as well as wit and judgment even from a child read in his life
what a man monsieur pascal was in divers sciences his other works what in divinity the provincials letters demonstrate
will omit julius scaliger joh picus paulus scalichius adr turnebus casaubon
card
perron in four daies got by heart all ecclesiastes in hebrew and besides his other vast abilities was also an excellent poet
mr oughtred in his old age had ovid and virgil fresh in his memory
fr suarez had austins works so by heart that he could repeat not only the sense but for the most part his very words and if he was asked of any thing in his own works
volums in fol he could tell the place and very page where he treated of it
but this himself called not memory but reminiscence for it was indeed as much judgment as memory for he was so well versed in that learning and so perfectly master of it having read the whole course of as remember
times over that if he were asked of any point or conclusion he would discourse of it just in the same manner and order as he had writ it in his books
could produce many more instances
but in reason the goodnes of the judgment must depend upon invention and memory that being the faculty which gives sentence according to the reports of the other two
yet few there are in whom these faculties are as may say mingled ana
it is best

therefore that all be cultivated and advanced as high as they are capable to be and what is most defective is most to be helped
and children having memory by nature invention not till youth nor judgment till maturity their memory is first to be menaged only with this caution that they be made to understand what they learn and the reason of it as soon as they shall be capable


of the bettering of judgment we shall speak in another place but for memory because we remember better those things
which we learn from our childhood
which we are more attentive to
which we exercise our selves most in
which we orderly apprehend
which we can call to mind from the beginning
which we conceive to be somewhat like
and which is pleasing to us and because childhood and youth have their memory tho not so excellent as men yet more useful then their understanding therefore what ever they learn let it be got by heart that they may repose and store up in their memory what their understanding afterwards may make use of let them also frequently render it and after several interstitiums which will be a great help to their memory to the perfecting of which nothing conduceth so much as practise
yet there is also an artificial help to memory which is variously and obscurely delivered by many authors the shortest and easiest is this
make use of a sufficient number of places best known to you as of towns in the way to london the streets of london or the signs in one street such in fine as are well

known to you
keep their order perfectly in mind which first which second and when any word is given you to remember place it in the first town street or sign joining them together with some fancy tho never so extravagant the calling to mind your known place will draw along with it the fancy and that the word joined to it
and these you may repeat afterwards either in the same order as they were delivered or backwards or as you please
this serves very well for words and indifferently for verses after much practise but it requires a long time by this art to remember sentences
a succedaneum to memory is writing and students are wont to serve themselves of excellent helps to ordinary memories
the best way that know of ordering them is to write down confusedly what in reading you think observable
young students commonly take notice of remarkable histories fables apologues such as are not in esop adagies if not in erasmus or manutius
hieroglyphics emblems symbols which are all but simile's drest after divers fashions histories of heathen gods laws and customes of nations
wise and useful sentences
elegant figures reasons and causes descriptions and the like
leaving in your book a considerable margin marking every observation upon the page as well as the pages themselves with
afterwards at your leasure set down in the margin the page of your index where the head is to which such sentence relates and so enter into the index under such a head the page of your wherein such sentence is stored
these if many

are to be distinguished by a your index must be well furnished with heads yet not too much multiplied least they cause confusion
your own experience will continually be supplying what is defective


invention is bettered by practise by reading by imitation and by

for practise let him have a teacher who himself hath some considerable dexterity and practise in it who may guide his charge by fit and easy rules and exercises and not thrust him upon fishing in books at first and may take his subject after him and shew him what more might have bin said and what he hath said bettered
neither let the young man torture his mind at all but set down what is suggested by his memory or fancy concerning his subject be it considerable or no
the soul will by little and little heat and wind it self unto higher conceptions and in transcribing he may reject what is too obvious
let him be taught first to fill up a sentence with epithetes oblique cases of the instrument manner cause and all circumstances and relations which is easily known by the rection of the parts of his sentence
practise him in most easy oppositions of not and but in most easy descriptions of things most familiar to him to enure him to the observation and taking notice of what he sees in enumeration of parts and species as the old is better
in histories or fables giving him somewhat to make out the rest as ultima omnium spes evolavit dolio in most easy and familiar similes as of a shepheard and magistrate

pismire and industrious person sufficient variety of these is collected by erasmus
under simile's are comprehended also metaphors allegories fables parables symbols and the like
and it were a good exercise amongst a circle of scholars to propose a symbol the easiest first and every one to answer in his turn let every one give his symbol of fortitude and a motto or word for it such as a pillar which sustaineth the greatest weight laid upright upon it the motto rectum stabile a palm tree that grows up against a pressure tu ne cede malis sed contra audentior ito to a die homo quadratus an struck with lightning impavidum ferient a rock an anvil an helmet fables are taken as symbols from things natural from things animate as an eagle cock clothing them with speech and action such betwixt men are parables
so there are mixtures of all these as easter said to the griggs tarde venerunt
there are also compound subjects which they call emblems of which alciat sambucus and many others have made volums
such are also impresa of great men a vast number whereof are collected by typotius and others
another way of practise is to apply all such things as he seeth or as occur in his ordinary busines or conversation to somewhat of morality policy
as seeing an ivy thrust down the wall upon which it grew one said that was the perfect emblem of a flatterer an onion having its germe covered with so many scales representeth a man that conceals his intention under many pretences and the like

for reading verse him well in inventive authors such are generally all paradoxists satyrists such as write one against another declamators controvertists and generally orators and poets as cicero quintilian seneca name him last because tho his matter be very good yet he husbands it well and spreads it thin
among the latin poets lucan juvenal claudian epigrammatists
let him also use his own invention before he reads upon his subject and in reading set down what his own fancy suggests upon or besides the author and let him alwaies read
cassiodorus reports of tully that he refused to plead when it was expected because he had not read upon his subject

for imitation let him imitate those he readeth as is taught in rhetoric by translating paraphrasing epitomizing and composing upon his own subject somewhat like the other
give him the same subject with an author unknown to him and then compare his conceits fancies reasons metaphors with the authors
let him also vary discourses as an history into a dialogue or epistle which take their arguments from all occasions as antenor to priamus to send back helena
agan emnon to menelaus to quit her
so to vary comedies and dialogues into epistles and discourses as mitio to demeas to spare his son and the like


for and helping the invention by them many have written very copiously others think it altogether unuseful

for that experience testifies that those who have passed the course of their studies and never understood or practised this art have yet had very good inventions that those who use their fancies do not at all serve themselves of these nor beg at every door for arguments and metaphors that the matter suggested by these places is only general or an heap of universal notions which is rather a disadvantage then an help
thus art de penser
but on the contrary it must be acknowledged that all the ancients aristotle cicero made great account of this that tho some have great parts that they can without art perform the effects of art yet all fields have not a river or a spring in them but some require the diligence of a bucket that those whom they called sophistae who governed in their daies made profession out of these places to teach to discourse upon any subject pro con and to say all that could be spoken concerning it that many of late daies have attained to plausibility in discourse meerly by lullies art which is but a few of those and those too the most general and indistinct that all conceptions are drawn out of these places and if reason naturally as it were and of her self runs to them it cannot but be very useful for art is a more certain guide then nature to make her see her own power to discover to her self her great treasure and to direct her whither to go for what she wants
for if the soul be a great palace furnished with all necessaries is it not a considerable assistance to the general dispenser to shew him where every thing is disposed

and deposited in its proper place the sole reason why these are not more taught in the schools is because they are included in and learned together with logic and philosophy and tho the use of the topics in logic be quite different from this here intended which seems to be the mistake of that author yet being the things are the same it is left to the diligence and versability of the understanding to apply them according to all their uses
the uses of topics in logic and rhetoric are to discover the value and force of a proposition in order to find out the truth and to produce assent in our selves or others either by conviction or perswasion but here they serve to procure a right notion and apprehension of things by considering all that belongs to them as also to communicate the same right notions to others and by questions to draw forth as many notions as the subject will afford
it is true also that these places are general for being the common springs of wit and invention they cannot be otherwise invention being the well applying of general predicates to particular subjects
thus much also confess that these topics are not so profitable to them who already understand sciences as to those who are ignorant and concerning the usefulnes of them to such matteo pellegrini of whose fon del ingegno have made much use in this chapter telleth us that the gentleman for whom he composed that book by the use of it arrived to such a perfection as to be able in a short time to write without defacing one word many pages concerning any the meanest subject proposed to him to the great admiration of as many as knew him

it is also to be noted that some subjects are barren which notwithstanding will serve very well for beginners such are universal plain ordinary themes and propositions which are to be fertilized by divers artifices chiefly by clothing them with some rare or unaccustomed circumstances such as have a shew of novelty or unexpectednes for nothing else is grateful
as to congratulate for a degree marriage are barren except there be somewhat particular of age severer examination extraordinary merit
it is also to be noted that tho some persons have such happy inventions that they can presently compare notions and as it were descant ex tempore upon a subject yet will they sometimes be at a loss and then these topics will be useful unto them tho perhaps not so much as to ordinary wits who must read and observe much that they may store up a magazin of conceptions and practise much also that they may readily and easily by their questions pump out what is to serve their occasions
for every proposition is the answer to some question and we think we understand perfectly when we are able to answer any question concerning our subject
all subjects also are either of single words or propositions

invention concerning single words consists chiefly in substituting other single words for it whether for expressions only or to raise more matter for propositions

in short the height of the invention a single word is capable of is an high metaphor catachresis or hyperbole
will give you an example of a single theme and how the fancy descants upon and menageth it through all

thus much for single words it follows concerning propositions or sentences these consist of subject copula and predicate
the subject in invention is either kept and other copula and predicates applyed to it or changed to raise more matter and then is substituted in its place either


synonymum as for little take epitome compendium pigmeus homuncio punctum atomus or some other of those expressions found out in the places for single words


genus as for treachery take deceit

species as for treachery take treason against the prince or countrey as tarpeias against enemies as sinon or against friends as bocchus betraying jugurth to sylla

the cognata as for treachery take feigned friendship

or its simile as of a fisher baiting his hook a intising those of its own kind into the danger
for beginning root fountain spring as of a watch seed

opposites as fidelity

the copula for so we will at present call those verbs auxiliary by some of which all questions are made and by which the predicatos whether verb or noun are joined to the subject
these are am was with their divers cases and persons have had do did make made suffer shall should will would may might can could owe ought useth or is wont
these again vary questions by the tenses or times present past or future and both these a long or short while such are these questions is it was it hath it bin alwaies lately or a long time agoe will it be would it be may it be might it be ought it or behoveth it to be

useth it or is it wont to be again all these are either affirmative or negative
is it not was it not hath it not bin they are also varied with if as if it be if it were or were not what would follow if alexander had fought with the romans if the sun go out of the zodiack

for predicates ordinarily authors do prescribe no other for invention then the predicaments which indeed do supply answers to very many questions but not to all
have therefore rather chosen to follow matteo pellegrini who reduceth all predicates that can be applied to a subject as near as his observation could reach to twelve heads or as he calls them fountains and springs of invention which are these

the relation or commerce between the object and human faculties

constituents or parts

the causes principles or efficients

the end

the action

passion

quality

quantity

time

place

the subjects

the correspondents
of which shall speak in order shewing what every place containeth and how matter may be drawn out of them by questions
yet shall not set down all that is to be said for that were both impossible and unnecessary but sufficient to make the use of them and of all not set down understood and practicable
the manner to use them is this set down the common place with its particular heads upon a several table or page till by frequent perusing and practising they become ready and familiar to you
then by the auxiliary verbs put in form of a question find out such notions contained in each place as are agreeable and fitting to your subject

change also the subject as often as you have need by some of the former waies and apply the questions after the same manner to them also



the relation of the object to the faculties of man is as divers as the faculties are
sense external internal

understanding

expression

affection
concerning sense your subject being the object of some of them are these and infinite other questions a battel
have ever seen it at least painted or described might have seen it where how long agoe how often had seen it what would it have wrought in me would had seen it for how can imagine it what notion have of it hath my friend or stranger or acquaintance seen it had he seen it or not seen it what would have followed hath he dream'd of it if a battel be so terrible when heard much more when seen yet more when present in it
could virtue be seen how would it allure all the world tis pitty a lye cannot be seen that all men might beware of it
again the passion of the sense affords such questions as these
the comet did it deceive weaken blind astonish confound please comfort cheer the sense

semper ego auditor tantum nunquamne reponam vexatus toties rauci theseide codri


concerning understanding or the internal faculty of knowing
the actions whereof

are thinking imagination apprehension comprehension perfected when we have a compleat notion or idea of our object this by many men an original of many errors is confounded with assent
assent or beleif that the object is so or not so hereto belong also doubting opinion beleiving or crediting another science or perfect knowledg deceit error prevision or foresight remembrance there being nothing that falls not out to be the object of the understanding concerning these we frame commonly these with infinite other questions
columbus finding out the new world
how came it into his thought did any think of it before what imagination or conception was formed of it why were not such as before him had that imagination excited to undertake it did the ancients think it impossible did they doubt whether it were not all sea did they beleive their predecessors that denied the antipodes how did columbus first assent to it what arguments what authorities moved him if he had not thought upon it would any other a thing so probable did it find many abetters how did it move work upon columbus when he first gave his full consent what resolutions did he take upon it


expression or that faculty which discovers our minds to others comprehendeth words languages spoken or written our own or forreign ancient or modern copious or barren elegant or rude pleasant or harsh perspicuous or obscure ambiguous equivocal synonymous proper natural figurative
again verse or prose narration

interpretation question instructing disputing determining affirming denying proposing answering confuting amplifying exhorting praying commanding advising congratulating condoling
all these again are true or false likely or unlikely doubtful or certain

to this head are referred also all expressions not by words as by painting graving symbols emblems characters cyphers hieroglyfics impresas as also signs with the hand eye or other motion of the body either natural or by consent of general custome or particular correspondence
as also all natural expressions of passions as sighing laughing being to speak of america and its inhabitants ask what is the name of the country what language it is who imposed it whence derived or took he it what is its true signification what the reason of imposing it what synonymas to it is it equivocal who hath writ of it in what language how much again is there any map of it what doth it resemble is it painted any where


affection hath these whence questions may be suggested
delight and trouble pain and pleasure love and hatred desire or aversion hope or fear gratitude or ingratitude anger admiration veneration contemt indignation compassion complacency and in short all other motions or passions of the soul
in reference whereto demand if a visit of a friend hath ever and when and how often delighted me whether it be a thing desirable joyful to me or if to any other and to whom
if he should come how would

my passions be affected what content

ii
second common place of constituents containeth three heads

of essential degrees of genus species
of particulars of its species and
of parts constitutive

the first hath subheads all essential predicates
beginning first with ens enquiring if your subject an unicorn be or if there be such a thing
so descending if it be a substance or accident
if a substance whether corporeal or incorporeal
if an accident whether quantity quality motion action and passion relation time or place running through the species of your genus till you come to your subject it self
these subdivisions of every genus are to be found in the predicaments
for example an eagle
is there such a thing a substance or accident is it a substance created corporeal compounded living mortal animal irrational volative wild that flies single not in flocks with a living by prey
so concerning the first predicate many questions offer themselves
as war is a thing no great matter if it were not in the world
were it not that we see it acted every day we should esteem it a fabulous chimera such as cerberus and the furies
were it not from how many calamities should we be free oh that there were never known the names of quarrels dissentions hatreds fightings but that love charity and peace reigned every where
what sort of entity is war pursuing it through all its differences it is an action not peaceable or profitable but troublesome and offensive offensive upon deliberation not by nature as

cold is contrary to heat for interest of state to distinguish it from robbery or private quarrels
menaged with open violence not secret plots with armed multitudes against an enemy that defends himself with a competent army

the second suggesteth to us considerations if the subject be one or many simple or various and of how many sorts how many sorts of eagles of war by sea by land offensive defensive just unjust horse or footfights fair or barbarous
so for particulars the war of the turks against the venetians english against hollanders french against spaniards
the third of constituent parts whether essential integral and these homogeneal or heterogeneal
adjuncts as hairs are parts of beasts leaves of trees and these either excrementitious or else perfective and for ornament as pillars are parts of noble buildings theaters fountains piazza's of great cities
or parts of order as beginning middle end superior inferior internal external
the soul hath it parts may it have why hath it or hath it not if it had or had not what sort of parts how many

iii
the third is of causes efficients or principles to which are reduced occasions instruments means or any concurrents assistants or accessories to produce the effect
these again are remote near or immediate universal particular primary principal or secundary and less principal total partial separate conjoined internal external necessary contingent fortuitous intended weak strong which may or

may not be hindred easy hard possible impossible prepared unprepared dispositions again all these are either of the thing it self or the thing being such as it is clothed with accidents and circumstances

in human actions also are other heads as the person our selves or some other friend neighbour stranger enemy which work either by chance by reason by passion and these love hatred by force necessity or violence by custome by error or mistake by opportunity as war by whom or between whom made who the occasion what moved to it what was the true cause what the pretence whence began it with what armes and forces was it menaged what instruments or furniture what conveniences how many artillery how many horse how many foot how many shot what stock of mony what strength what experience what counsel who the general what a one for skill courage fortune what of all sorts how qualified was he constrained to fight did he undertake the charge voluntarily out of duty ambition doth he menage it by intelligence treachery or force iv
the fourth is of the end and means or of good for the end of every agent and every action is good either real or seeming near or far off private or public

of ends there are several degrees or subordinations
the ultimate or supreme end
the chiefest is the glory of god the creator next the perfection of the universe
and these are universal of all things
next follow more particular

or mediate ends the conservation of the species the conservation of the individuum its delight or pleasure excellency and convenience honestum or duty profit to the agent his friends neighbors the public his country

all natural agents though they work for an end yet intend it not but are directed to it
only man being a rational creature knows and aimes at an end
and the end of the man is one of his art another as the statuary makes a statue to get mony but of his art is to resemble the archetype
of mens intentions or aims some are principal others accessory some ordinary others accidental
pompey married caesars daughter not for the love of progeny nor for her beauty or dowry but for his own ambition an accidental end to marriage
some direct others perverse as a father recounts to his son the worthy actions of his ancestors to provoke him to the like which he perverts to pride libertinism to laws and magistrates and insolence towards his inferiors
and this happens sometimes out of error and mistake as when an orator diverts his art to get applause sometimes also out of malice and wickednes as when a general desires victory to satisfy his private revenge
when a man goes to church to look upon an hansom woman

again of ends some are ultimate and principal others secundary instrumental or means to obtain the other
as a prince gives out mony to form an army to fight an enemy to overcome him to take away his dominion to seize it for himself
this is the ultimate end the other are means
of these also some

are proper and convenient for the end as if he that designs to be a soldier learns to menage an horse to understand and use arms to endure hunger cold wearines wounds watching others are improper as to quarrel to swagger to be drunk fight kill and slay every one he meets
to be an orator the proper means are to study reasoning and argumentation to imitate cicero demosthenes to observe the best way of disposing his matter clothing it with good words phrases figures the contrary and improper way or rather impediment is to scrape together a parcel of words a few snaps of wit

again some ends are obtained others hindred as a man desires health and strength sed grandes patinae tucetaque crassa annuere his superos vetuere
a father desires his son to be virtuous and prudent and provides him masters books but the young man abandons himself to ill company hindred by our own folly opposition of friends enemies
or fortuitous accidents
questions concerning the end are such as these
wherefore why so to what end purpose intention for whose sake for what good doth worketh maketh he this what shall he reap by it hath he obtained his end hopeth he shall he obtain it what means taketh he to obtain it are they rational prudent proper who can hath will hinder him or it

the
is of actions
whereof some are immanent when the agent is also the patient commonly expressed by verbs neuters in latin
such are to grow to

fail to move to rest to want to hast to declame to study to think understand others are transient when the agent and patient are divers aad are expressed by verbs transitives as striking heating

again some actions concern being as pride what doth can shall will it produce note that all the auxiliary verbs have their greatest use and force in this classe generate perfect preserve consume destroy conversation begetteth similitude in manners mutual confidence uniting interests conserves friendship and is apt to procure advancement debauchery consumes the estate destroies health others concern qualities and indeed all actions proceeds from the virtues or faculties of their agents whether natural or acquisite and actions are as various and copious as qualities are
as a wise man gives good counsel and doth his actions wisely
a young man doth can may is wont to do foolishly
strong wine doth is apt to inebriate
in action the place time and quantity often afford matter considerable
he can speak more boldly in an then at court
the sun warmeth and enlightneth because bigger more then venus more also when nearer
how doth it move act by it self by another by nature force chance as the efficient end pretence circularly directly how in youth how in age how at first how afterwards slowly or hastily constantly or by intermissions equally or unequally mediately or immediately

to action are reduced also consequents or

effects which answer to the question what doth it or he work and of these some are made some are done some endure no longer then the action it self as the room is no longer light then it is enlightened
if the auditors mind him not all is done as soon as the preacher hath spoke his sermon

others remain after the action is ended as health remains tho the medicine have ended science remains when the study is finished
science gets honor honor emploiment emploiment riches
a prince what doth he what ought he to do to administer justice
what will that do or is it apt to produce to maintain plenty security peace
what are the effects of these naturally usually alwaies continually the peoples love and readines to spend their lives and estates for him
hence no danger of insurrections rebellions he will live in great honor and reverence with his neighbors
the golden apple thrown by discord amongst the gods at a feast what consequents had it might it have delight of the guests emulation and desire of the three goddesses chusing of paris to be judge mercuries descent to carry him the message his undertaking it his beholding the three goddesses
so the immediate effect of the sun is heat thence the warming of the earth raising vapors thence clouds rain
again from heat seasons of the year generation of all plants metals

the sixth is of passion or receiving an action
but especially suffering which is chiefly of evil
to this belongs

being made being done was the world could it be could it be made from eternity the rebuilding of the city is it may it could it be done finished perfected destroied consumed and changed into better worse

why do some men grow as fat as ehud none as big as goliah qualities
the moon because receiving her light from the sun is subject to eclipses changes full priamus because old lived to be spoiled of his kingdom to see his sons slain his city destroied
the ethiopian is burnt with heat the laplander frozen with cold
in sum what ever heads belong to action may be also easily applied to passion
what doth the object work upon us our senses what do all simples and medicines air and all things called by physicians preternatural all things edible work upon us in order to health and sicknes what do all arts work what all virtues vices estates ages sexes work well ill or indifferently

vii
the is of qualities which hath these heads
good and evil in themselves good is perfect worthy noble excellent happy evil the contrary
in respect of others necessary helpful superfluous profitable agreeable hurtful as lucifer was created a most noble and excellent spirit but afterwards became unfortunate wicked dangerous malicious in endeavoring to diminish the glory of god and devising mischief to man
full of hatred against heaven and deceit against earth by which means he

is become the vilest and most detestable of all creatures


qualities occult which are known only by their actions
what is the power faculty of the loadstone to draw iron to make it move towards the north who could beleive the power of circe to change men into hogs
qualities sensible such are beauty uglines figures of all sorts light darknes colours of all sorts natural artificial white black for hearing sounds of all sorts shrill loud skreeking whistling din noise
so for smells of all sorts and tasts also tangible qualities as heat cold dry moist heavy light hard soft liquid solid thin thick subtil gross clear and all these natural or adventitious
as lucretia was beautiful naturally
qualities of the mind faculties or powers natural or accidents as in the understanding perspicacity sagacity memory tenacious treacherous invention ready slow the affections also and passions virtues and vice belong to this head

adjuncts as naked clothed armed adorned trimmed not men only but houses cities sepulchres fountains and the like

situation as cloth is tenter'd folded a pillar upright leaning fallen hanged up a living creature standeth sitteth lieth kneeleth


relations as lord subject judg advocate accused magistrate master servant scholar teacher maried unmaried rich poor noble ignoble glorious in disgrace

the of time hath these heads alwaies sometimes what is the duration of the creator he hath alwaies bin
is it possible he should be not eternal if he were not eternal what would follow why is he eternal can any thing be eternal besides him duration is varied into past present and future

brief directions for elocution
beg the readers pardon if contrary to my own design here subjoin to the discourse of invention a few lines in order to regulate our speaking and writing what we have invented

out of him therefore for the greatest part have drawn this short scheme and prospect whereby any even meanly practised capacities may be able to discern and judg of what is well and written or spoken and consequently himself also to imitate the eloquentest authors there are then divers manners of speaking and writing


concisely in few short abrupt sentences as men ordinarily speak in common conversation without any art or order
as

dic mihi damaeta cujum pecus an melibaei non verum aegonis
nuper mihi tradidit aegon

such is very frequent in the comedians

vos isthaec intro anferte abite
sosia adesdum
paucis te volo
dixi audivistis tenetis judicate


somewhat artificially but imperfectly
without any observation of numbers correspondence measure when a period hath no certain bounds but goes on till the matter be ended keeping the mind of the auditor still in suspense till all is said which is to say which when it will be the auditor cannot divine because he cannot foresee where the speakers design will determine
such are the beginnings of most of pauls epistles
such is that beginning of cicero oration pro caelio
si quis judices forte adsit ignarus legum till you come to quibus otiosis ne in communi quidem otio liceat esse
so in that pro milone beginning at occidi occidi non sp maelium unto non modò vestibulo privaret sed omni aditu lumine
so in catone majore
plus apud me antiquorum authoritas valet unto per visum ex africano audisse dicebat
such is that dithirambique scene in senecas oedipus which begins

effusam redimite comam nutante corimbo mollia nisaeis armati brachia thyrsis

such that of virgil in his silenus

namque canebat uti magnum per inane coacta
and aeneid

principio caelum ac terras camposque liquentes

such is most of the historians manner of writing

this fashion of speech the greeks called oratio pendens ar rhet

such when an athenian ambassador used at sparta the senate replied the first part of your oration is gone out of our minds and the second never entred in


afterwards thrasimacus or whoever he was that first observed the pleasingnes in lyrics to proceed from their pauses and measures began to practse the same in prose and to mince those great and unlick'd masses into shorter and rounder periods
of these that which consists of one entire sense only and is not divided into members such as are most of senecas is called by aristotle periodus supina and by reason of the omission of the transitions and the frequent repetition of the same matter in several words is by most orators rejected
wherefore others out of more diligent observation of what was pleasing changed those round and incoherent periods into many more concise members carving them as it were into divers clauses and parcels which were also made correspondent and commensurate one to another
so that they became neither intire nor yet maimed not metrical yet not without meeter not in feet yet not altogether loose without verse not without rythme verse compared with other prose prose compared to verses
this came not in fashion amongst the romans till the latter end of tullies time which made his first orations not to be so eloquent as his latter and himself to complain that he was going out of the world when he

began to understand rhetoric
and of some orators in his time he saith in iis erat admirabilis cursus orationis ornata sententiarum concinnitas non erat they had a wonderful fluency in their stile choice words and round full periods but they wanted the neat distribution of them into parts and members
the first is like an head of excellent hair but hanging down and flagging this other like the same hair disposed and made up into rings and curles
examples of these are infinite in plinies panegyric


this harmony or correspondence of the clauses of a period consists in three things


equality of the members

contraposition of the words

similitude of terminations


equality is when the divers clauses of a period consist of equal number of words or of syllables or times two short syllables being equal to one long which is altogether as graceful
as speremus quae volumus quod acciderit feramus
cic alterum optare crudelitatis est alterum servare clementiae
superbia in fronte ira in oculis pallor in corpore in ore impudentia
plin
si quid obtigerit aequo animo paratoque moriar neque enim potest accidere turpis mors forti viro neque immatura consulari neque misera sapienti
cic
contraposition antithesis is a conversion or retorsion of the same words in divers clauses of the same period
for the same words are severally and often contrarily joined to make as it were a seeming contradiction or paradox at least
as

saepius accidit ut imprudentes felixiter prudentes infeliciter agant

inselix dido nulli bene nupta marito hoc pereunte fugis hoc fugiente peris
stultus prudentibus prudens stultis visus

sometimes also words of a contrary signification are joyned together elegantly in one periodus supina
as inclinata resurgo
carpit carpitur una qui spectavit vulnera vulnus habet
sparta ibi muros habet ubi non habet
sometimes words signifying contrary things are placed in divers clauses of the same period
as aut vivos amplifica aut mortuos derelinque
alba ligustra cadunt vaccinia nigra leguntur
sometimes they are placed in manner of a dilemma
morere si casta es viro si incesta amori
jupiter aut falsus pater est aut crimine verus

similitude of terminations whether

by iteration of the same words in several clauses

of the same cases and persons of nouns and verbs though not the same words yet of the same or like sound
of the spartans at thermopylae
trecenti sumus sed viri sed armati sed lacones sed ad thermopylas nunquam vidi plures trecentos
of the same nos sine deliciis educamur sine muris vivimus sine vita vincimus
this correspondence is sometimes in one word sometimes in and sometimes but rarely
indignus cui vel improbi bene vel probi malè dicant
dum laurum acquisivit regiam palmam amisit popularem

vel in negotio sine periculo vel in otio cum dignitate esse possint

aeque nocent qui nolentibus vitam officiosè impertiunt qui volentibus mortem malitiosè negant

an tu me per hos in patriam revocare potuisti ego te per eosdem in patria retinere non potero
besides these there are two other sorts of figures or ornaments of speech
the first are such as move the affections and perswade as well as delight and therefore may well be called pathetical
the second are such as consist in ingenious expressions in the words themselves
pathetical are those figures which serve to express some passion or other operation of the mind as the imagination understanding whether they concern apprehension appetite anger or any other affection whatsoever

xiii
of bettering the judgment


the judgment is that faculty whereby we discern judge of true and false good and bad better and less good
naturally some sedate considering persons are better disposed to it then others but none at ain any considerable perfection in it any other way then by experience
experience say of others communicated by books or instruction and of themselves by their own observation
the habit which perfects this faculty as that which regulates the will and affections is virtue is wisdome or prudence
that great power whereby we live in happiness and content whereby we excell all other creatures and most men also being by it out of the reach of their deceit and craft and not imposed upon or derided by them whereby our reason and better part is regulated and whereby we

ought to govern both our selves and others
this if it be applied to particular subjects hath severall names as if to govern cities or tis political prudence if armies and war military if a family oeconomical with none of which intermeddle but only with that which concerns every particular person in the conduct of his life and here only in general reserving to the second part such particular rules as either my own or others experience that have read have suggested
in this place therefore shall only advise as wall as can how the faculty is to be cultivated for the implanting that great perfection


and first take notice that the exercising this faculty is the employing of all the rest
for it is in vain to give judgement without examining the reasons devised by invention for both parties and the like cases in former times suggested by memory
for the chief employment of the judgment being concerning the future either the choice of an end or of apt means to an end no man can promise to himself any success in his election without engaging all the powers he hath
as there must be

supposing the end to be already resolved upon and alwaies before his eyes a proposal or finding out severall mediums to an end
which is called counsel

a comparing these together that he may be able to chuse the best and properest and honestest for his purpose for if he use dishonest means tho proper tis craft and subtilty as to chuse improper is folly and want of wisdom
this is the immediate action of judgment and which consists of many parts
as
circumspection of all circumstances

of time place and all other opportunities
caution for prevention of hinderances considering all dangers and difficulties he is likely to encounter and either providing to decline and avoid or arming himself to resist or suffer them

solertia or good and rational conjecturing of what is likely to succeed
a firm resolution and competent secrecy
and lastly a constant and due execution of what is well resolved
now because this knowledge is very difficult and at the best but a conjecture it is necessary to consider what hath succeeded heretofore upon such premises for that is most likely to happen again but this cannot be done without the assistance either of books or experienc'd persons who have seen and known the like cases and successes and this cannot be without much observation and taking notice of things in the time of their actual flourishing and storing up such rules and histories in the memory for future application
by the way it will not be amiss to take notice that as there is no new thing under the sun so neither any new action but the same are represented over again under varying circumstances so that he who intends to be a wise man must endeavour to distinguish the action as physicians do in judging diseases from the circumstances that he may be able to give a good judgment and prognostic and afterwards to frame a general rule which may stand him in stead at other times and occasions


opposite to wisedom is folly that base abject low poor sordid condition which renders a man wearisome to himself and contemtible to others exposed to every ones deceit and craft

a slave to his own passions and others flatteries and a stock whereupon to graft any vice shame or misery
this is made up of two ingredients ignorance and error
to avoid which as also to rectify the understanding and abtain a true notion of things as they exist in the world and relate to us it is necessary that we


endeavour to be set at liberty from the dominion


of vices

of passions


to use much attention consideration and weighing things themselves


that a man may be virtuous it is not sufficient that he now and then do virtuous actions nor that he do them frequently out of good nature interest mode passion or the like but that he work discreetly constantly habitually and for a good end and by deliberation and choice which two last conditions necessarily presuppose prudence
so that as no virtue without prudence neither is it without them
for it hath bin the observation of all knowing and discreet persons and thay have delivered it for a certain rule as hath also the holy spirit and wisdom of god himself that virtuous courses onely together with gods grace obtained by much prayer and intercession are capable to make a man wise to direct his actions in such manner as he shall not need to repent of them
and that therefore such actions are called good and others evill because of the evil consequents that they bring such as perform them to sorrow repentance and misery
hereupon are grounded those rules in the holy scripture that the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom that the beginning of wisdom is to avoid folly and wickedness
that it is sport to a fool to do wickedly and the like religion

being the chiefest and supremest of all virtues
an evil man seeks occasions to gratify his humor and at best thinks to stop at the confines betwixt passion and vice but a wise man avoids the occasions of vice which he looks upon as a disease of the soul contrary to the natural and due constitution of it and subverting its true tone and disposition
and that every vice in particular is contrary to prudence appears because covetousnes instead of wisdome introduceth craft subtilty deceitfulnes which are called the wisdom of the world
pride breeds confidence of a mans self and despising others advise and counsel and lust the third fountain of all vices is the mother of negligence precipitious inconsiderateness inconstancy and at length of that blindness of understanding which renders them uncapable of discerning such things especially as concern their souls but even such also as are advantageous to their temporal welfare and of chusing better from worse fit and convenient from improper and aliene


passions tho not so immediately concurring to the ruine of the judgment as vice yet indirectly and by consequent destroy it also
for being as said before undeliberate motions towards objects pleasing or displeasing and therefore in the sensitive soul the objects passing through that to the understanding carry with them that tincture or forme they there receive by those actions not now as pleasing or painful but as good or bad for so the passions represent them
and if the intellect do not speedily reflect upon the deceit and separate and cleanse the natural from the passionate wherewith it is stained it becomes partaker of and ingaged in the error

and so not only looseth the true notion and knowledge of the object but apprehends it also under a wrong and false idea mistaking the pleasure or good for the object
and whatever it receives or considers whilest in that disposition is conceived under the same mistake
so that all passions more or less according to the degree of their strength render the understanding partial and unindifferent and consequently erroneous and unfit to judge in any thing of moment
hence it is that a man in passion tho the alteration be only in himself yet imagines the world without him to be changed
what was before esteemed when now look'd upon through this false light appears contemtible and the contemned becomes admirable
the beloved or desired is without faults is excellent and easy the hated is all faulty unworthy and impossible
yet is this no great matter compared to the passions when they are in their height and vigor
do we not see how for the satisfying of a lust and enjoying a revenge a man breaks through all laws all obligations natural and civil how he regards not what injury or affront he offers even to magistrates and parents how he despiseth all inconveniences and evill consequences his own or other mens reasons may forewarn him but will not meddle with these extravagants utterly unfit to be carved into mercuries and will consider those which work more mildely and seduce not trample upon the judgement
such are


or an overvaluing of a mans own parts opinions or actions
an error in some sort necessary to the

of man for should every one know exactly the measure of his own ability the greatest part of the world would be miserable
every man therefore makes himself the standard for all others esteeming every ones abilities and actions as they are equal or conformable to his own and this seems to be a natural suggestion but if it be too much indulged so that either for pride of his own parts knowledge or for interest and covetousness or for honor and reputation or for custom and education or any other a man warp his judgment he lies under a lasting and universall prejudice
for this is the beginning of opiniatrety and when despising the advice and judgment of others he follows only his own counsel is it not just that he should be permitted to fall into the consequences of his own opinion he that bends and plies his reason to his passion why should he not enjoy the product of his indiscretion why should he that sows folly reap the fruit of counsel and advisement but to instance in the foresaid particulars


he that is conceited of his own worth eo ipso despiseth others and therefore will not read or take pains to informe himself what other men say or know but when he fixeth in himself this proposition that other men are more ignorant then he then whatever comes in his fancy seems to be an addition to knowledg and must either be reserved as a mystery or vented as the depth of science and oracle of wit though many times it is but either a great error or at best a vulgar truth and the most extravagant

and grotesque conceits as being most of all his own he esteems and values the most
such a man frames to himself notions and opinions which all the world is to submit to and these alone are to be taught and propagated and all opposers are opiniastres and ignorant if not malicious contradicters of the truth and envious of the glory of him that discovers it
hence comes the spirit of contradiction that let the adverse opiner say what he will his reasons will not be heard for indeed our learned man stands upon his guard against truth and so at last instead of fair arguing turns to chicanery and pedantery


how much interest and secular respects wrest the judgement is manifest to any one that observes that the thriving opinions and such as are countenanced by them that can reward never fail of abettors
but can easilier pardon these then those who for love of gain oppose the magistrate and government who knowing the humor of the ordinary people to be against obedience and subjection make use of it to disturb the peace that they may fish the better
they gain proselites that they may grow rich they gather churches that they may collect wealth and heap up disciples that they may multiply collections
thus they deceive unlearned and unstable souls of their temporal as well as their spiritual goods and care not what craft and deceitfulnes they use that they may fill their puries their arts are infinite and seen of every one but those who are deceived by them


or desire of seeming more knowing then other persons is as strong a passion ever since our first parents were carried away by it as any that molests our souls
this goes masked many times under a vizor of seeking reformation advancing knowledg and the like when it is in reality seeking applause insinuating into a party and vaunting our own selves
the beginnings of this delusion are many times very subtil and difficultly discerned except by those who are very jealous of themselves
hence comes an itch to invent or publish new opinions and fancies to quarrel for a new interpretation and even go to law for the primogeniture of a notion
from hence also if sharpned a little by coveteousnes comes all seditions disobedience to magistrates heresies schismes and rebellions
is it not strange to see an ignorant person without comprehending or so much as tasting the principles of arts and knowledg to judg for himself and scorn to be guided especially in things of consequence where most caution is to be used he that will not refuse to be taught to be a scorns to be instructed in divinity and he will submit to a master of a trade that will not bow to a doctor
if a man well furnish'd with this spiritual pride happens to be informed in some particular knowledg above the rest of his condition he immediately thinks himself inferior only to angels instruction he despiseth all ignorance yea and sometimes science too he defieth and pretends to nothing but inspiration and the consequent of that infallibility then hath the devil perfected his work in him he is advanced

as far in error as is possible and becomes a seducer and an impostor


of all opiniatrety that which proceeds from custome and education is the least absurd yet a fault it is also and more difficultly conquerable then the rest
for the errors become in a manner connatural and tho a disease yet have so tincted the understanding that it apprehends nothing but through them
and therefore the more any one knows in his error the more difficultly is it eradicated yet time and labor will do much one custome not being to be expelled but by another
from this force of education it comes that heresies and dissessions are for so many generations continued that whole orders and sometimes nations espouse one opinion and that contrary to another as wise and learned as it self


timorousnes basenes or slothfulnes is another origine of errors quite contrary to those produc'd by when a man seems to have no opinion of his own but to assume the colour and tincture of those with whom he converseth
the opiniatre takes for false what any other person affirms the complaisant for true
this is indeed the most peaceable way and the best to make a fortune but corrupts the judgment more then the other
for such a man either despiseth truth as a thing of no value not worth laboring for or his own soul as if god had not given him reason but had brought him into the world and not endued him with sufficient ability to guide himself in it
such men usually admire other mens persons

and take things upon the credit either of a greater number against a less which in difficult matters is very dangerous or sometimes of a less against a greater
or of persons not versed in what is desired to be known as of a learned man in things of piety or secular prudence of a pious man in matters of learning and the like yet this is better then to take a mans judgment because of some external and accidental advantages as to think a man learned or in the truth because a friend or acquaintance
or am of his opinion because gain or hope to get by him
or he is rich for which men hold him wise
he hath so many legions therefore he hath reason
or he is in great office he is above us therefore wiser then us he is of our order therefore we must sustain him
from this admiration of persons it comes that he is thought a good preacher that sweats and labors in the pulpit or he a good advocate that bawls at the bar or he a wise man that talks gravely
we also think him a wicked person or our enemy that is acquainted with such as if all that converse together joined in the same interest him proud and insolent that neglects a due civility him ignorant that is slow and silent and him to have taken good counsel that hath success
hence also it proceeds that most men admire what is in fashion and vogue even in religion it self and learning as well as in clothes and phrases
that men are taken with shews and splendor and vain appearances and are unwilling to go out of the track but relinquish reason and many times virtue it self because they want company

but that which most imposeth upon persons of learning and prudence is if they see a man say much truth and well they are apt to take the rest of his discourse upon that credit
the strong carries off the weak and the understanding once conquered is not willing to try her strength a second time against the victor


will mention no more of the passions but in short reduce all the causes of errors to
heads of misjudging
the first is too hasty assenting the second too slow
for the first
there being no proposition for which somewhat may not be said many men whether out of passion interest want of ability or leisure lazines or whatever other cause rest with the first appearance and by little and little take root and fix in error
alas how few can judg of probabilities of them that can how few will take pains to weigh and consider how many are concern'd that error should be truth and who are so easily deceived as they that think themselves wisest hence it comes that so many men abandon themselves to sensuality covetousnes and other vices without remorse or discovering the fallacy for they assume to themselves certain reasons built upon slight foundations which they are concern'd should be true and therefore they will not examine them but because they have some tho but very small shew of reason they serve them first for discourse with others and then to fool themselves
as generally for all vice they urge
the example of other men the most many also in prosperity and many esteemed good that yet are vicious some way

that it is not so bad or dangerous as is pretended

that many sin yet but few punished
and the like
for pleasure such as these that natural desires are vainly implanted in us if not lawful
that it is for poor and impotent persons not to bestow upon themselves what they desire to bridle appetites and lusts is an argument of lownes of spirit or want of power and that by this great persons are distinguished from mean ones and inferiors
that if pleasures had not been fitting nature had not joined them to those actions which are mostly hers and that therefore beasts are alwaies regulated by them
that no men whatever they pretend but use them
that studying or emploiment is only that pleasures and rest may be enjoied in old age with more gusto
that thinking is a dull formality and desiring a laborious life by him who can live at ease is a busy folly
so for covetuousnes
that a good patriot endeavors to encrease the stock and wealth of the nation which prodigals wast and consume
that it is a great fault to spend and abuse those things which may be put to good use
that nothing breeds respect but wealth that alone is equal to all things the ransom of a mans life the last appeal and resort of all calamitous persons
that it is but storing up what is necessary

the like pretences and may be found for all other irregular and vitious desires
to which if a man by education interest passion or any other way be biass'd and prepossess'd and his indifferency removed he will easily take up these plausibilities and by them make his reason and truth truckle under his lusts and desires
qui vult decipi decipiatur

but this fallacy of hasty judging reaches further even the learned and philosophers are guilty of drawing universal conclusions out of insufficient inductions
the instances are infinite but not fit for this place
but see in common conversation what argumentations are frequent amongst us
some professing religion live not accordingly therefore all religion is hypocrisy
some grave men are only formal therefore all gravity is formality
some things are uncertain therefore there is no truth at all


the last error in judgment shall note is contrary to the former too long deferring assent
when a man hath considered a question and finds on either side arguments many times he will not put himself to the trouble or for want of judgment he is not able to consider which is more probable which easilier answered but sits down with suspense of assent thinks that of two so equal in probability either part or neither may be safely taken and is contented with scepticism
in justification of this folly some have made a profession and instituted a sect defending that there is no proposition so probable but its contradictory is as probable and that no man can be certain of any thing against which any reason

may be objected
so that wee are not to beleive our selves awake because we somtimes dream that we walke think eat
a doctrine more then brutish for the beasts feed and sleep guided by their senses notwithstanding the manifold errors and deceits of them without any scruple of doubting
against human nature also and injurious to our good creator blaming him for giving us no more certainty then is needful or useful and not such a one as by curious persons may be imagined
tis also against their own practise for what sceptic ever refused to eat or sleep pretending that the necessity of those actions was not grounded upon a principle of absolute certainty or the like which notwithstanding they willingly suggest to others upon the testimony of senses and reasoning upon the objects supplied from the senses all the moments of our lives and fortunes depend peace and war government and obedience and the rest
he would be very ridiculous that being convinced of robbery before a magistrate should plead that the senses of the witnesses might erre that they might be at that time asleep and dream they were robbed that it is dangerous to take away a mans life without absolute certainty
in short not to assent to sufficient evidence to so much as all men are wont to assent unto and upon which they set their lives and fortunes seems to be a disclaiming of humane nature and a silly affectation to be what man never was is nor can be


will instance in no more errors but proceed to the remedies of which some concern the educator others the educated
for the first


would not have the instructor to be offended if his charge take not every thing upon his authority obest plerumque iis qui discere velint authoritas docentis
but encourage him to ask questions and move doubts accustom him to give his opinion and reasons in doubtful cases especially such as fall out at that time and upon the place
for want of such let him censure the ancients let him accuse the murderers of caesar jeer cato for killing himself quicken also and waken his spirit by giving him liberty to contradict you when he finds reason for it and when he doth not do you shew him what arguments are against your self
encourage in him all thinking and exercise of the mind and let him judge and censure freely what he reads or hears sparing persons alwaies for charity sake and discourage him not for every error he commits
take not all the talk to your self nor make to him long harangues expecting a youth should go along with you and understand and believe all you say
but discourse with him much after socrates manner which teacheth him to know things even before he learn them by considering and comparing them with things obvious and familiar to wind up to the knowledge of things unknown and obscure
this will enlarge and exalt his spirit to an universal contemplation of the natures of things as they really are and make him to admire nothing to be surpriz'd with nothing and not condemn every thing that is not cast in his own mold or framed after his own mode and taste
thus he will not be offended with small matters nor be amaz'd to see contrary humors opinions or fashions

nor be like a man brought up in a bottle see all things through one hole
it is also observable that the more any one knows the less is he ingaged in opiniatrety but this only mention


he that seeks truth and to perfect his judgement must endeavour to render himself indifferent free and disengaged that he may be ready to pass his sentence secundum allegata probata which is chiefly by delivering himself from the power and dominion of all passions whatsoever
which is done by regulating the imagination for there is their beginning by subjecting it to reason and the understanding that it may not without consultation follow the suggestions of sense and unruly motions of the appetite
and this is not difficult if the particular occasion can be foreseen but because that happens not frequently it is requisite to set a continual guard over our weakest place where we are most obnoxious to the enemy and to have a continuall magazine of such sober and moderate considerations as advice reading and experience will furnish
but if notwithstanding you cannot prevent these apprehensions which indeed is difficult mean for a man to stand so continually upon centry his arms ready and fixed and in his hands then at the time of the assault retire let the motion spend it self in vaine and suffer it not to fix upon the object
but at the worst play an aftergame
if anger have prevailed against you force your self to beg pardon and let shame and especially voluntary punishment penance bring wrath to reason
so

against insolence contradict your own tho lawfull desires another time and do contrary to what you most affect
in sum observe your own inclinations for accidental passions are not so dangerous and watch over them diligently which is also better and easilier performed if you can procure a faithful monitor to assist and advise you
next set not your affections to much upon any thing whatsoever even not upon the public or works of charity which are not necessary pursue nothing with eagerness and engagement
and think not when you have conquered three or foure times that the war is ended
passions are much the weaker by being overcome but take heed they rally not
qui sani esse volunt ita vivere debent ut perpetuo curentur
good counsel
is not to be taken as physic but as nourishment continually received ruminated and digested
and lastly when you are foiled put some penance upon your self and resolve upon greater diligence for the future
and using these means doubt not by gods blessing but to arrive in time to a sedate tranquillity of mind and a clear understanding of the truth a condition not more advantageous to the possessor then grateful to and admired by them with whom you converse


the last means propose of acquiring a good judgement is consideration weighing or thinking much upon the probabilities of both sides and that not onely at the present when the mind is engaged and concern'd in and for the business but at leisure suppose at night when you recollect what you have done all the day for then the mind is free to review and revise

her own actions
he that useth this will find in himself other thoughts and conceptions then he can possibly imagine and he will see the same difference as is betwixt looking into muddy and clear water
hence it will follow that much busines is a great impediment to him that desires to perfect his judgment nemo occupatus bonam mentem invenit
sen
an experienc'd person is capable of engaging himself in many emploiments but a beginner must not nor in any one busines that taketh up his whole time for by that means indeed he may be well skilled in that one thing but he cannot arrive at the largenes and comprehensivenes required to true wisdom
again whatsoever conduceth to heighten and as may say to spiritualize the soul is also advantageous to wisdom
and this nothing doth so much of the several parts of learning and sciences have spoken before as devotion or contemplation which is a borrowing of light immediately from the sun and a lifting and raising up the soul to god who of his infinite goodnes hath made the reward of his service in some sort the effect of it also

now the first consideration a wise man fixeth upon is the great end of his creation what it is and wherein it consists the next is of the most proper means to that end afterwards he weighs the difficulties and hinderances he is likely to rencounter in his obtaining that end
after which he weighs all particular occurrences how they conduce to or at least agree with that end and those means so chosen
but for these refer you to such authors as have spoken expressly concerning them

of travelling into forreign countries


the advantages of travel are to learn the languages laws customes and understand the government and interest of other nations

to produce confident and comely behavior to perfect conversation and discours

to satisfy their minds with the actual beholding such rarities wonders and curiosities as are heard or read of
it brings us out of the company of our relations acquaintances and familiars making us stand upon our guard which renders the mind more diligent vigorous brisk and spiritful
it shews us by consideration of so many various humors and manners to look into and form our own and by tasting perpetually the varieties of nature to be able to judg of what is good and better
and it is most useful for those who by living at home and domineering amongst servants have got an habit of surlines pride insolence or other resty and slovenly custom
as also for those who are entangled with unfitting companions friends loves servants
for those who are seized upon with the vices of their own country such with us are drinking rusticity sowrnes in conversation lazines and then every one must be sent into the place most proper to reform him as drunkennes

is not much used in france less in italy and spain
debauchery with women not so frequent in germany flanders gaming is common every where but less in italy
quarrelling dangerous in italy and spain
prodigality is often helped by setting a certain allowance in a place where he cannot be trusted where he is necessitated to live within his compass or in prison or shamefully run away without paying his host
it is also profitable for all persons learned inquisitive and curious who by the conversation of learned men and use of books unusual with us and libraries may very much augment their knowledg as well as their experience


would not advise any young man to go abroad without an assistant or governor a scholar one able to instruct him in such ingenious arts as are fitting for him to know to chuse his companions else a young man left to himself not having to employ his time must of necessity fall to debauchery and evil company who are alwaies ready to seize upon young straies to assist him in sicknes or any other necessity to advertise him of his failures to exact the performance of his studies exercises and emploiments to husband his allowance to keep him company and furnish him good discourse and good example


whoever would have his son molded upon the form of such a nation must send him thither young that his tongue may be plied to their language and his whole carriage imbibe by imitation their manner and

fshion before tincted with any other
but if that design be not regarded as conceive it not very convenient for any one to quit his own country customs customs say not vices then it is better to travel when they arrive at some judgment to discern better from worse when able to furnish discourse and by that means enter gratefully into conversation
whereas being sent young and having no knowledg or experience they cannot advantage themselves abroad but are there in a kind of amazednes variety of objects which they neither understand nor value confounding rather then edifying them
and truly conceive the cheif reason why travellers have so little especially good conversation of the natives to be because of the jealousy they have of young travellers that nothing is to be advanced by their conversation worthy the trouble of their bad language impertinent discourse silly questions for such those demands seem to be which concern things to them familiar and obvious and frequent visits
methinks therefore it were better every one to be educated at home to the subjection and obedience of his own country laws and customs except the laws and government be subverted as they lately were and except there be some such nation in the world as admire all laws and customs but their own
etcocles would not give hostages to antipater of the youth but of grown men
and the persians when wanting a king they sent for some of the royall family then hostages at rome were afterwards displeased at and cut them off as not agreeing with the manners and customs of

their country
besides tis better they should stay till by instruction and study they have arrived to a capacity of employing their time profitably and delightfully by themselves without being as too many are forced to seek divertisement with others then leave their country at that age when they should be habituated and molded into the laws of it
and this is the reason why not knowing their native duty and living as strangers licentiously and not according to the best examples abroad they bring home instead of solid virtue formalities fashions grimaces and at best a volubility of talking yet some perhaps think them then well educated and that forreign vanity is preferable to
this is also the reason why they are forced for passing their time to apply themselves to such conversation as they can find and good company being very rare and shy but bad alwaies ready and offering themselves tis no wonder if they run into extravagant expences as well as evilnes of manners
or if they escape these then the fencing dancing and catch them from whom picking up some scraps and shreds of discourse at home they vent them for laces and rubans
or at best of all they sow but which if well husbanded yeilds them a goodly crop of wonders in their own country


exercises commonly learn'd in travel are dancing fencing riding to which some add vaulting and anciently swimming for which reason suetonius takes notice of it as a strange thing that caligula so good at other

exercises could not swim he observes that augustus instructed himself his to write and swim swimming also was publicly taught at athens music and designing
and these conceive might as well if not better be learned in our own country were it not either for the sloth or opiniatrety of our nation
the use of dancing and fencing is sufficiently if not too much known riding renders him master of the noblest and usefullest of all beasts vaulting makes the body active but else is not of so great use as wrestling were if in fashion or swimming which is both more healthful and many times proves to be of great consequence and necessity
music advise not since to acquire any considerable perfection in it takes up too much time and to understand little of it is neither graceful satisfactory nor durable
to thrum a guitar to or italian ballad tunes may be agreeable for once but often practised is ridiculous
besides do not remember to have seen any gentleman tho very diligent and curious abroad to qualify himself with that skill but when he came to any maturity he wholly rejected it
designing advise to but only as a parergon not an emploiment
and the small mathematics strangers learn in france serve to little besides getting mony to the teacher

rules in travelling

be very careful with what company you associate upon the way in pension lodgings
but make no such familiarity except you have of a long time tried the person as not to leave your self liberty to come off when you please
neither be ready to make or accept assignations of meetings

at taverns especially be not the first motioner
much time is lost ill acquaintance got mony spent and many mishaps come by it
besides they beget and draw in one another the most idle alwaies contriving to twist in another meeting


suspect all extraordinary and groundless civility of foreigners as a design upon your purse and what mony you lend upon the way to strangers count it given not lent
nor ever declare what mony or jewels you have of which notwithstanding you ought to have a reserve not to be touched but upon extraordinary occasions but alwaies make your self poorer then you are
make even with your host for pension and all other demands at the end of every month and take his hand to an acquittance for by that means you hinder all and they are wont at your leaving them to pick some quarrel or seek some pretence upon you to get more of your mony
and so upon a journy when you are not at an ordinary reckon with your host after supper
and where you never mean to return extend your liberality at your first coming or occasionally as you have need of them and defer it not till your departure

injuries from strangers especially in their own country are easily safely and discreetly put up but never safely revenged where they have more friends and power then your self
especially beware of intrigues with women infinite quarrels and tragedies have begun there


for health without which you can do

nothing
when you begin especially a long journy for three or four of the first daies or meals at least abate a third of your ordinary eating the like do also at your arrival to rest tilll your body be somewhat accustomed to the alteration
in travelling especially in hot weather drink as little as you can especially by the way for that increaseth your thirst heateth and disposeth you to a feaver
water with wine but water alone to one subject to thirst makes him more thirsty


if you find your self indisposed of feaverish throw in a glister miss a meal or two cover your self well in bed that your body may transpire or sweat or else let blood
but if it seems by your wearines unquietnes disturbed sleep high pulse pain that it tends to a real sicknes call the physician betimes

have with you a little or some such antidote that if you eat any bad meat or drink go to bed presently after supper or find any thing heavy on your stomack or be tired with a long wet or tedious journy by taking a little of it you may restore your self
lucatellos balsom also if well made serves against ulcers wounds aches galls bruises by falls and like accidents

if your occasions require you to voiage in hot weather be very careful to preserve your head from the heat of the sun be very abstemious in your diet and take the best care you can your body be open
accidental heat also is best expelled by transpiration


drink not before you eat for that quencheth appetite nor at any time without eating especially no mornings drinks and beware of

raw fruit the most pleasant and newly gathered commonly is worst corrected much by eating bread with it


temperance chastity and moderate exercise are the great advancers of health and long life
de resto in every country observe the rules of health practised by the discreetest inhabitants

chap
xv
of prudent chusing a calling or state of life
upon the discreet choice of our calling or state of life depends our whole content and felicity for if we chuse that which is agreable to our inclinations and abilities both of body and mind we work cheerfully our life is pleasant and we are constant to our purposes
but if capable of better we chuse a worse and lower we espouse a continual vexation if we aime at what is above our capacity we despond and despaire
players fit their parts to their persons and let us exercise our selves in what we are most fit for
and if necessity force us against our inclinations let us use diligence to comply with it as hansomely as is possible and at least avoid vice rather then pursue things which are not given us


in all our actions the principal guide we have is the end as in travelling the place whither we are to go directs the way
and since we have by the law and condition of our creation one principle reason in us which doth or may and ought uniformely to produce all our operations we may also have them all directed to the same scope and intention
we are indeed composed of body and soul and the body is guided by sense but the soul the better part doth or ought to govern the body and it self be governed by reason illustrated in christians by gods holy spirit


they who aime at nothing but satisfying their sense are such as either
never look before them but live in diem without care or prudence passing their time in mirth and jollity without design or consideration except to contrive that to morrow may be as this day or to escape some present pressure and difficulty which interrupts their delights
or
do indeed advise and propose an end but such a one as is either not obtainable or if obtained not satisfactory universal or durable
such are pleasures riches and honours
any or all of which to be made the principal and ultimate end of our actions is great folly and madnes
for neither will they avail us in sicknes and the calamitous parts of our life whereto also they often engage us and in the prosperous they are not in our power to command them when we please nor keep them when we have them nor do they satisfy us if we keep them
they grow tedious and burdensom subject us to cares sorrows envy

and dangers and there is somewhat better which is not liable to these exceptions


beasts do not deliberate but work out of instinct of nature all of one kind the same way wherein they may be somewhat perfected but not changed without any general end or intention of their living or acting tho they have some little particular ends of some of their actions
but deliberation is a considerate weighing of all reasons pro con such an end and the means to obtain it how a man shall employ those powers and faculties which god hath given him either by nature or his own acquisition to that purpose for which god hath given them
for there is one certain end which all men may and ought to propose as most agreeable and proper for their nature and condition


this intention which will sustain a man in all estates and conditions which will have an influence upon his whole life and actions which is a rock whereon he may safely build in all conditions and accidents is to do as much good as he can both to himself and others
which the holy scripture calls glorifying god a phrase demonstrating the reason why this is the universall end of our nature because that god created us all and gave us our being and all that we have and this not for our own sakes for no rational and intelligent workman doth so but for his own sake who is glorified when his works answer his intention
he being also the universal good of all creatures

what ever good we do is a corresponding to and as it were an assisting him a propagation of his interest and consequently a fulfilling of that end for which he made us


this is performed severall waies as
by serving him in his own house being members of his family officers in his church or ecclesiastical persons whether active or contemplative

by serving him in the in actions of charity and that either as magistrates or private persons
in both which good is to be done by example advice counsel commanding governing rewarding punishing liberality assistance of the weak and poor against oppression
in all which the magistrate hath greater opportunity and obligation to do good then private persons
many of these good actions also cannot be performed without wealth and reputation and riches if with due moderation and justice to this purpose desired and employed are very good
for these being the measure of all things in the commerce and conversation of mankinde tis impossible for him that deals amongst men to be without them and for him who is in an active life and to do good to be without a considerable proportion of them
and his reputation do not say popularity but the good opinion of wise and virtuous persons every one is bound to preserve and to provide thimgs honest in the sight of men also
so much pleasure also is to be allowed as is necessary to keep up the body in health and cheerful vigor which the wise creator also hath appointed in that he hath joyned pleasure to natural actions


in chusing a calling therefore the fitnes whereof is only in order to our glorifying god our own salvation consider


the advantages or disadvantages to our end or its contrary

the temtations we are likely to undergo and meet with

what strength assistance or hopes we have to overcome them
but because it is not possible to judg of these but by experience which the deliberant is supposed not to have but in some lesser measure it is therefore necessary for him to ask advice first of god then of wise upright and experienced persons
and
those who have an excellent faculty or genius to one thing above others seem to be by god called to that

those who are by their parents or own choice educated in one thing particularly and find it agreeable to them may safely acquiesce and be persuaded that calling is from god as may also those who have as it were an hereditary calling being born to riches and honors may safely acquiesce in it say provided they can overcome those temtations of offending god which do usually accompany it
as all callings have some and some very many more and greater than others


those who upon any rational grounds embrace such a calling wherein they are perswaded they can serve god and live charitably and do good to their neighbors may safely conclude that they are called by the ordinary providence of god who is also the giver of reason to assist and govern us in those things

which fall under its cognisance


some also god almighty calleth extraordinarily by his prophets ministers or internal inspirations exciting to somewhat extraordinary either in spiritual or secular emploiments
concerning whom we can give no rules

many men are not capable to chuse for themselves being of weak judgments unexperienced biassed with some vice or irregularity these are to submit to the counsel of their friends and the most disinteressed and nearest a kin are the likeliest to give best counsel

it is in vain for him to ask advice that is not indifferent to all or most of them at least so much as to be without prejudice or to refuse any proposed and not to love or hate any so much but to be ready to change his passions upon the information of better judgments
unindifferent are those who are preingaged
as for married persons it is in vain to consult about single life
for then they can only deliberate how to glorify god in a married estate
and if an estate be ill chosen but irremediably accuse not god almighty for the ill choice but seek to amend it by more virtuous and pious living

going to chuse therefore place your self as much as is possible in equilibrio and resolve to chuse the best as near as your own discretion the assistance of gods spirit implored and the advice of friends shall suggest unto you the best say not simply but the best for you considering your parts inclinations bodily health and strength exterior advantages and the like

and
consider that tho no man is obliged under guilt of sin to undertake the absolutely best calling or estate and that god almighty hath not so made man for eternals that he hath no care for temporals yet in prudence and if he have a design of attaining christian perfection he ought to make choice of that which he conceives the better


that as every man is to give an account of the calling wherein he is and not of another so a man is rewarded that lives and doth better in a less perfect state then he that doth less well in a more perfect yet a more perfect state is to be preferr'd which affords more advantages of doing well or better

that tho there is no lawful estate wherein heroical virtues may not be exercised yet these are much more easily and frequently practised in some then others

that since contraries are so mingled in all our affairs that nothing is so good that it hath not some inconveniences joined with it nor any so probable as that somewhat may not be said to the contrary you are not to defer your resolution till all difficulties be cleared and you be able to answer all things to the contrary but it sufficeth to embrace that which is most probable


that if your election be thus made with indifferency unpassionatenes and sincerity seek not to change but settle your self quietly in it and make account that whatever you chuse you will sometime or other repent of it when you find the unexpected inconveniences and hardships of your own and the seeming ease and conveniences of another

the sincerity of your choice needs not be doubted of if you chuse purely for the love of god if you would have advised your friend to the same course of life and if you would be content when god shall call you to be found so doing


an old man in vitis being demanded of one what he should do answered our works are not all of the same sort
abraham was hospitable god was with him
david was humble god was with him
therefore what you find your soul inclined unto so as it be according to godlines that do
it is true that one calling hath more opportunities of glorifying god and of glorifying him more with nobler and sublimer actions
all men are not alike capable of those heights and by him who after due consideration probably conjectures that he shall do very well in an active and but meanly in a contemplative life here the active doubtless is to be preferred

if you have made choice of an estate less advantageous which you may change be sure to advise well before you do so for many times wearines inconstancy advise a quitting of that wherein it is really better for you to continue


tho there be no state but may be more or less dangerous or convenient for one then another as where god gives greater strength and plentifuller grace there is less danger from temtations yet those states seem to be in themselves best which are not subject to so many temtations which have the fewer

avocaments from religion which have more incentives to and occasions for piety more good examples more leisure for devotion more severity towards our selves more and more heroical acts of virtues which approach nearest to the life of our lord and which shew most gratitude towards almighty god


tho god supplieth grace sufficient to every one for his estate and he that fails of his duty doth it by his own default yet he who casts himself into temtations cannot promise himself to be assisted by god
paul adviseth younger women such as will put themselves in frequent dangers or temtations of not living continently rather to marry
temtations are from company health bodily strength wealth bad inclinations as to ambition covetousnes opiniatrety desire of liberty opportunity of time place
from the consideration of which and such like these rules may be taken notice of a good natur'd facil man is not fit for such an emploiment wherein he must necessarily converse frequently with evil persons
a melancholic person is not fit to undertake a profession of much study or solitarines
a timorous spirit is not fit for magistracy
a covetous person is not to be a merchant or banquier
a man of bodily strength and choler will not be a good officer in war
the sleepy and drowsy are best employed in a calling wherein is much bodily activeness
a rash man not to be entrusted with a great affair especially in war


let no man easily perswade himself that what ever his calling be his thoughts will be different from the rest of mankind that is in that calling for all men are alike have the same principles of thinking and acting and the same way of deducing from and acting by them
particularly let no man think that magistracy will change him to the better especially look at his actions and conversation in his private life such will he be also in his authority
and therefore let him not upon such confidences hastily take upon him a calling in which he sees in general great inconveniencies or dangers to the preserving of his virtue or innocence


if you be consulted concerning a person either very inconstant passionate or vitions give not your advice it is in vain for such will do only what shall please themselves
never advise any one to a calling which is much against his will or inclination

of civility

in this second part are thrown together a miscellany of observations concerning several the most usual occurrences in active life
such as enter not into any art or science but are the result of experience in the conversation and affairs of this world
begin with civility as being the first to be learned and practised and tho many rules of it seem plain and obvious such as are fit to be insinuated into the practise of children yet are they not to be neglected but to be neal'd into youth that they may not through defect of them miscarry in their age as many great persons have done who trusting to their justice and severe virtue have bin ruin'd for neglect of compliance and civility
for tho serpents are greater poysons and presenter death yet more men are destroied by their irregularity in eating and drinking
and small wounds if many are mortal
to be couragious bountiful and just are indeed much greater and

nobler then to be of an agreeable conversation yet is this as useful for it is in continual practise the other rarely and upon occasion besides other virtues have need of somewhat to maintain and exercise them
justice will have power liberality wealth but this is set up with no other stock then a few pleasant looks good words and actions
all men are in some sort disparata and even these who are under the relations of superiority and inferioty yet those obligations being satisfied as to all other matters account themselves as equals
and tho laws punish not the resty and froward yet are they chastised by the loss of that and freindlines which gains most men having greater aversenes to the incompliant then the vitious
wherefore it is necessary for every one that would bring his purposes to effect which cannot be done without making use of other mens abilities and the greater the design the more instruments are needful and those instruments also not inanimate or necessitable but spontaneous and free to master the wills and powers of those he makes use of to make them say to work cheerfully and readily for him which is by civility to let or insinuate himself into their good liking and voluntary assistance
for he who cares not to live void of offence towards others renders himself offensive and odious unto others consequently they comply not with him they act for him if at all by force either of reward or punishment and therefore no more nor otherwise then they are constrained
thus for want of civil address many men of parts and virtue become

useless in their generation but others by their surly and uncompliant humor grow distastful in conversation fall into contemt whence follow affronts and quarrels
some also are forc'd upon low and mean company and thereby bring a dishonor not upon their persons only but their family and parents who are look'd upon as not willing or able to give them decent education and their country also if they happen amongst strangers who are ready to censure hardly of that nation whose gentry are so little civiliz'd


again where there is much company as in cities there is also great variety of humors and dispositions and a greater care of wary conversation as also where are persons of greater and more piercing spirits or curiouser observers as in courts or amongst forreigners who take particular notice of many things which continual practise makes us pass over
he who thinks to live contentedly or peaceably in these places without mortifying his own humor and deposing his natural inclinations is of a shallow capacity or an evil nature

he is either of a savage fierce insolent disposition or of a stupid slothfulnes
both of them fitter company for beasts then men and for deserts then cities


wherefore as justice bridleth our coveteousnes and constancy our natural timorousnes so doth civility our haughtines and presumtion and as a good christian for the glory of god mortifies all his own passions and humors and puts on those which are for his

purpose and according to his intention such mean as religion and reason suggest and as a good courtier for his interest complies with every one alwaies gay cheerful and complaisant without any humor of his own only borrowing that of the company
so in like maner every civil person doth the same so far at least as to avoid all offending those with whom he converseth


for civility consists in these things
in not expressing by actions or speeches any injury disesteem offence or undervaluing of any other

in being ready to do all good offices and ordinary kindness for another
and in receiving no injuries or offences from others
in not resenting every word or action which may perhaps rationally be interpreted to be disesteem or undervaluing
indeed our reputation which is onely pretended in this case were it really in danger yet is not of such consequence many times as peace and quietness but we are ordinarily unjust and partial judges of our own concerns never looking upon our selves but with love and value
but however our patience is certainly a rewardable virtue but whether the correction of a misdoer will reuscire well is a difficult question and is that so much recommended by our lord of forgiving trespasers against us


civility is not therefore punctuality of behaviour mean that which consists in certain modish and particular ceremonies and fashions in clothes gesture mine speech or the like is not using such discourses words

phrases studies opinions games as are in fashion in the court with gallants ladies
this is a constrain'd formality not civility a complying with the times not with persons and varieth with the age or season frequently according to the fancy of mechanic persons in their several professions whereas the rules of civility founded upon prudence and charity are to perpetuity unchangeable
speak not here of such ceremonies as are by duty required towards our superiors either in gesture speech or other address
those are not in our disposing to omit or alter custom our great master hath imposed them and that rationally for the ease of the magistrate and to make his commands current and we ought to obey without dispute or pleading
nor of such as are used generally in conversation whereof also advise every one to be rather liberal and give some of his own then retrench any of what is due
but of such as by particular persons who either would seem modish and perfectly civil or would hide their poverty of understanding and discretion under the vail and varnish of mode studied and affected
whereby themselves think to insinuate into the favor of those with whom they converse but those imagine themselves esteemed as weak and easy that are to be moved with such trifles and as some women are thought to be taken with rubans and fancies more then real decency


compliments also are another thing serve to a contrary end and proceed from a different cause
civility from sincerity and virtue

these from duplicity and deceit
that makes friends these unmake and hinder them that distinguisheth one man from another these involve all in an equal adulation
they consist in praising immoderately and pretending greater love and friendship then either is deserved by or intended to him to whom they are offered
he that useth them beleiveth not himself nor would have his auditor believe his expressions but know not what greatness of affection he is alwaies offering and promising never performing asking pardon where there is no offence or necessity but when it is commanded by god and reason he will dye rather then demand it
these are imaginary services notional impertinent humiliations a solemn an abusing of language and putting together many good words to signify nothing
the use of this traiterous discourse if any be is to hide a as juglers and mountebanks in a cloud of good words that the auditor may not discover more of him then himself pleaseth
or as keep you still in talk lest you should too narrowly examine the wares they would put upon you
officious lies they are licensed by custom and like the unproportionable garments are faults of the age
neither is flattery encouragement to or accompanying in vice or error consenting to any thing prejudicial to a third person a permitting to offend or actually sinning or the like any part of civility
for this consists not but with severe justice real charity and solid discretion


and therefore it as all other virtues requires an early initiation and continual practise to arrive at a perfect habit of it
it concerns also parents and educators to see that the educated converse as much as may be with his equals or superiors not with servants or mean persons lest he put on their manners and playing rex amongst them he become apt to undervalue all others and so become insolent
it behoves them also to give him no evil example by themselves or others but propose such precedents as they desire the young man should copy
in france fathers are wont to carry their children when youths with them to visit persons of quality to shew them how such demean themselves and to procure them a convenient boldnes
mothers also in italy teach their little children pieces of dialogues or plaies by heart which they render and recite in their presence and are taught by them graceful address in saluting speaking they also send their children frequently in errands and visits to their kindred or neighbors teaching them what to say what titles to give what answers to make to the demands most likely to be asked somewhat also to furnish discourse


the young man himself also ought as he grows in age to observe the actions of others especially of his equals and of such as are most reputed for civility and to note what becomes or misbecomes them
also what is practised by most by persons of higher quality and by persons of maturity and judgement
he must also watch over himself severely and once a day

at least call himself to acount of his speeches and actions
and also procure some friend to observe advise and admonish him of what is well what ill what might be better done or omitted
lastly observe such rules as these that follow some of which are framed for youth others for such as are growing up or arrived to some discretion


do nothing which may justly scandalize virtuous persons chiefly by any neglect of religion as by undecent behavior in gods house as seeking your ease abandoning your self to laziness and lolling gazing about you frequent changing postures covering your face or head
regulate therefore your self by the example of the best and most devout in the place you live
use not commonly or unnecessarily the name of god or of the devil not passages of holy scripture not mocking or profaning holy persons things or actions not only because these things are sinful but undecent also and practised only by persons of ill behavior or mean condition


do nothing that may offend anothers sense or imagination
to strike or pinch a man is a clowns salutation
no carion or excrement is to be shewed to your companion for you know not how squeamish he is
approach not your mouth so near in discoursing as to offend or bedew any one with your breath for all mens breaths are offensive
be not nasty in your clothes or about your body in much sweating except in time of war or action belching biting or cutting your nails rubbing

your teeth picking your nose or ears handling any parts of your body which are not usually uncovered nor those more then needs
sing not to your self nor drum with your feet or fingers in company as melancholic men do
grind not nor gnash your teeth nor scrape or make any sound to offend or interrupt others not so much as lowd speaking except where necessity
spit sneez cough from the company and not loud for decencies sake


let your look be pleasant composed modest confident
frowning is apprehended to be a sign of a cruel disposition as is noted of caracalla
when you discourse with any person gaze not upon him as if you were taking his picture
nor fix your eyes constantly on any one object for that betokens impudency or at best amazedness or contemplation as staring doth folly
wandring and inconstant looks express madness or unsetled thoughts winking if not a natural infirmity is the action of persons as winking with one eye like shooters is of maliciousness and evil nature
a sharp and fierce look is as one that is angry
to bite your lip is used in threatening to thrust out the tongue is scurrilous
to sink the head into the shoulders is laziness the head erect and backward is interpreted pride and arrogance as letting it fall on either side hypocrisy
to go with folded arms is sloth or melancholy and in this it is a natural suggestion to keep the breast warm and defend it from hypochondriac pain to set them a kembow is arrogance and to hang them

down folly and lazines to keep your hands in your pockets or covered with your cloak is a neglect of the company

a slow pace is proper to delicate and effeminate persons an hasty one to mad men strutting is affectation wadling is for the slothful and lazy and in measure to dancers
speak not through the nose nor with any affected or unhansom gesture wrying the mouth swelling the cheeks lisping
if you have not a pleasing pronunciation recompense it with good matter and when speaking cough not nor use any interruption for so do lyers when they invent what to say
a little laughter is permitted moderate smiling commended


there is a certain mine and motion of the body and its parts both in acting and speaking which is very graceful and pleasing
greg
nazianz foretold what a one julian afterwards called the apostate would prove when he saw his hasty discomposed and unseemly gestures
ambrose discarded a clerk because of an undecent motion of his head which he said went like a flail
on the contrary cn pompeius saith tully ad omnia summa natus habebat in voce splendorem in motu summam dignitatem
this consists
in the proportion and harmony betwixt every mans person and condition as for a young man to be active and sprightly not mimical and restless a grave man slow and deliberate not dull and sluggish

in confidence opposed to sheepish bashfulnes when one knows not how to look speak or move sor fear of doing amiss but alwaies blusheth and is not able to support

an harsh word a chiding an angry look without being altered

in avoiding all affectation and singularity for whatever is according to nature is best and what contrary to it alwaies distastful and betraies vanity and indiscretion that knows not to imitate the best
nothing is graceful but what is our own
and therefore every one strives to work easily and freely and with a seeming negligence for such seems to proceed either from nature or an habit
but constrainedness undervalueth an action as doth also seeming to do all with design and study
yet affected negligence is worst of all


in eating at meals the company is offended if you eat with hands dirty or unwashed after you have made water or done any offensive action
if you hover over the plate or table as an hawk over her prey if you handle others meat be delicate or take the best or most or formost to your self
as the indian that seeing at the other end a dish that pleased him leaped upon the table to fetch it
if you feed with both hands for fear of loosing time or keep your knife alwaies in your hand or with the point upward if you dip your fingers or any thing you have tasted in the sawce or make a noise in eating cut or put into your mouth great morsels or lick your fingers or not wipe your mouth or spoon after eating

it is against health to swallow your meat unchewed or greedily or much or much variety or delicacies and against civility to eat after others to throw your bones or offal upon the

floor to gnaw your bones to handle dogs at the table to observe what and how others eat to dispraise or praise immoderately the meat or smell to it for if you suspect it let it alone lest you offend others

present not to others what your self have tasted
drink not nor talk with your mouth full or unwiped or glass full nor put the cup too far into your mouth as children do nor drink greedily or so long that you are forced as horses to breath in your draught nor blow into any ones cup or upon his victuals tosts talk not at table any ungrateful or impertinent discourse nor be angry with your servants nor do any thing which may interrupt the cheerfulnes of the company
it is questioned whether it be civil to talk much at meals because that hindreth the intention of the table and it is not easy to avoid all offensivenes especially in discouse about divinity the frequentest in england
in england strangers tax us for drinking before we eat against health drinking many in the same cup and many times the snuffs left by the former for eating much much flesh sitting long at meals not using forks but fingers and the like


in visitings is much more ceremony and civility observed in some places then others
the italians and of them the romans and neapolitans are most punctual
the greatest cause hereof is the avoiding of misinterpretations and quarrelling
this hath begotten an art of ceremoniousnes so full of subtilties and punctilios

that it is an emploiment to learn them
and therefore tho in this country of great freedom and little jealousy where persons of quality are neither so apt to give or take offence they are unnecessary or also unfitting yet it may be fitting to know how to entertain a stranger or how we are entertained by him or by any other that expecteth or practiseth this accuratenes of ceremony
have therefore set down the cheifest of their rules for the most part out of the book called il maestro camera which is on purpose to instruct in those observances

women are not usually visited in the morning nor ambassadors or persons of business on the hour or day of their dispatch or emploiment
nor persons in the beginning of deep mourning and if visited it is not expected they should use the accustomed ceremonies
nor sick persons till they can sit up in their beds and put on their upper garments
women also have alwaies the upper hand even in their own houses and are intreated not to stir out of the chamber of entertainment
it is better to give too much honor to any person then too little therefore better to carry himself as inferior to his equals and equal to such as are not much inferiors
inferiors also if of parts are to be better treated for parts are equal to honors or wealth
the more familiarly the more honorably are inferiors or equals treated but superiors the less as to your table to your or closet to your self in bed dressing or retired

neerest the wall in england and france suppose because the cleanest is the honorabler

place in italy the right hand if two the middle place if three walk together because easiliest heard of both

to make signs to one to be covered is superiority so is to turn the back first at parting to accompany the departed but a little way whereas your equall you wait upon to the utmost door or gate the superior to his coach or horse
the visiter ends the visit but not in the midst of a discourse nor is he to stay so long as the visited seems glad to receive him but if he see his company much desired he may come the oftner
visits of congratulation and condoleance the sooner the better
the uppermost place of a table ought not to turn its back upon the greatest part of the room nor to the door where the meat comes in it should also have the window before or at least on one side of it
in making visits few things are observed but in receiving visits many as entertaining a superior or equal he ought to be so clothed as to go abroad and drawing near to hasten his pace as if he would have gone further to receive him to meet a superior also at the bottom of the stairs to accompany him to his coach
it being a general rule to accompany the departer one degree further then where you receive him
equals tho best received as you desire to be received by them are commonly received at the top of the stairs and the gentlemen meet them at the bottom
it is alwaies observed that the visiteds gentlemen attend one degree at least further then the patron

inferiors are received according to their qualities some in the some three some two or one chamber off or at the chamberdoor or half the chamber of entertainment
only it is better to use too much then to little courtesy

with strangers extraordinary civility and freedom may be used because they come but seldom stay not long and have no emulation with persons of your own country
an eminent person not knowing how to entertain a stranger feigned indisposition and received him in bed
if two send messages to have audience of compliment at the same time to the latter the patron commonly answers that a is lord of himself and time but that at the same time he expects such a one
if any one come to visit whilst his superior is entertaining ordinarily he is conducted to another room where he is entertained by the gentlemen or if of lower rank he staies in the
if an equal come to visit whilst an equall is in the room the patron asks leave of the present and leaving a gentleman or two to keep him company goes to receive the new comer
to persons of quality audience is given with the portiere or hanging that covereth the door on the outside down public audience with it open yet if then a person of quality come it is also let down
likewise at their entrance and departure the whole door must be opened all their doors being made double it being an action of great superiority to give but half a door

seats also ought to be set ready before the visitants enter and chairs with arms are more honourable then those with backs only and these then stools
the visitants or principal seat is to be set in such manner as it may look full upon the door of entrance and the greatest part of the room the patrons with the back towards the door
if many visitants equal their seats are to be set one besides another or ordered along the wall which hath the foresaid conditions
if two their seats are to be set so as to have the door on their shoulders and that on the right hand of the door is the better place

the de may deliver a message of compliment of a meaner person then the visitant but he must be more careful if a message of business except from an equal or that it require hast
but all messages from the prince or superior are instantly admitted and no message must be whispered to the patron in company with equals but spoken aloud
if there be many visitants and one depart before the rest the patron leaveth the rest and accompanieth the departer
and if whilst he is conducting an equal another equal enters he entertains the new comer a while with the departer then recommending him to some of his gentlemen to conduct him to the place of entertainment he accompanieth the departer and then hasts to the other

when visitants are ready to depart the patron maketh a noise with his foot or chair that the attendant may understand to lift up the portiere but he ought not to command him or to do any thing which may shew superiority

in his own house
but if there be need of any thing to ask leave of the visitant to call for it
but visited by inferiors he may call or do what he pleaseth

if the visitants stay till it be dark the causeth to be lighted and set up in the footmens station a torch of white wax and in the other chambers each two candles of white wax and in the entertaining room two or more as shall be necessary which are to be brought in by the gentlemen also two or more in the must stand ready to be lighted to be born by the gentlemen before the visitant when he departeth who yet are not to turn their backs absolutely upon him
at the hall door must be ready torches to be carried in like manner before him by the footmen or pages if there be any four at least for an equal six for a superior
a man meeting his equal or not much inferior makes his coach stop the worthiest stops last and departs first
a man in coach meeting his equal on foot lights out of his coach and when they part he walks on foot a while after and then remounts
for an inferior he alights not except he have business with him

a governor of a place through which his equal is to pass sends to invite him before he enter his jurisdiction and if his invitation is accepted he sends to meet him
or
miles some of his gentlemen in coach and so others as he draweth nearer when near the governor goes to receive him in person or if he please to honor him under pretence of taking the air he may go abroad that way

he comes and so receive him as he pleaseth


do nothing in a company where you design to shew civility that resembles superiority nor usurp upon their rights nor do any thing whereby any of them may think you do not love prize or respect them
as do not your own busines command or chide your servants assume not all the talke to or of your self family wife nor tell your dreams when perhaps your best actions when waking are not worth the reciting censure not nor contradict the rest but cede to the major part
desire not the highest place nor be troublesom with impertinent debasing your self by refusing to go first throwing the arms like a fencer and spending time in being intreated to do what you desire
some are dainty and nice that take exceptions if not saluted in due order mode hence they become jealous think themselves affronted those mens conversation is a slavery to be with them is to be in and a man had as good handle
let them beseech you enjoy themselves by themselves their conversation is a rope of sand and no cement of love and kindnes can ty you to them

the beginning and end of conversation with every one is salutation nor must you break company tho with intention to return speedily except you first ask their leave
the inferior salutes first out of duty and so doth the visiter

modesty is more graceful then boldnes boldnes then bashfulnes bashfulnes then impudence
country people know not how to look but think they do best when most extravagant

endeavor not to partake of other mens secrets either letters books papers discourses if any thing be given to another to read take it not out of his hand nor be hasty to see any curiosity the first nor be curious to know what any one is doing or studying or with whom
whisper not with any in company for the rest suppose you talk of them but if you have any private busines take him aside after you have asked leave and when none is discoursing and when you discourse privately eye no man of the company
when you walk to and again turn your face towards your superior and if you meet a superior in a narrow way stop and press to make him more room for it is an action of respect
beware of sullennes melancholic furious silence as if you observed and censured what every one spoke or did
tho silence in a studious person may be tolerated
and if all the company laugh do not you act the grave nor be like a pump to yeild only what is forced from you
yet to be complaisant is not to eccho to what every one saith or do whatever any other would have you to make up a number and be a cypher in conversation
to comply with all is worse then with none as much as contemt is below hatred

pride insolence statelines imperiousnes angrines

are not signs or qualifications of a gentleman but the scandals of conversation and proceed from a spirit of presumtion and want of breeding which conceives it self to be above better wiser then others and that he alone ought to be the rule to which others ought to conform that all others are wandring stars himself only in the ecliptic
the greatest magnetismes in the world are civility conforming himself to the innocent humors and infirmities sometimes of others readines to do courtesies for all speaking well of all behind their backs
and affability which is not only to be used in common and unconcerning speech but upon all occasions
a man may deny a request chide reprehend command affably with good words nor is there any thing so harsh which may not be inoffensively represented
consider that the meanest person is able to do you both good and harm

esteem the faults you commit against others to be great those of others against you to be small

answer no man till he hath spoken for those who are impatient to hear are rash to censure nor turn your back upon nor correct the speaker depart not before he hath done prevent him not by helping him out with what he seems to have forgot
tell not what comes into your fancy in the midst of anothers discourse nor seem to know what he would say if you think fitting to interpose do it not without asking leave else you hinder the discourse to be understood and make what is said to be misinterpreted whence many unnecessary arguings and confused tattles

before the matter can be cleared
say not knew this before but accept what is said as new and in good part

be not magisterial in your dictates nor contend pertinaciously in ordinary discourse for your opinion nor for a truth of small consequence
declare your reasons if they be not accepted let them alone assure your self that you are not obliged to convert the whole world
it is also an uncivil importunity to clash with every thing we dislike or to confute every thing we think is false to formalize upon all the foolery and we hear
let us not contrast with the whole world as if we were universal reformers
in a controversy say not all you can but what is necessary
also if what you report is not beleived do not swear it nor use any imprecations upon your self nor lay wagers nor take your self engaged to defend it or that he who beleives you not affronts you
so neither repeat the same things frequently over if the company harken not to you let them chuse suppose it your own fault who speak not what deserves their attention
if they understand you not blame your self who either speak not clearly or accommodate not your self to your auditory
after a man hath told a story in your presence ask not what's the matter for that shews that you contemned the speaker and minded not what was spoken besides you make him your inferior to tell a tale as often as you are pleased to ask it

he that speaketh much cannot speak all well
but indeed it is the that bears the

first fruit and the emtiest that makes the most sound
besides it is an injury to the rest of the company who expect to be heard every one in his turn
yet better to speak much then nothing at all except it be apprehended to be discretion

if you live in a place where the language is spoken in an evil dialect do not affect to speak either purely or badly but as the best of that dialect speak
and avoid all big and hard words remember how the lyon crushed the frog whom he saw so contemtible after he had made so great a noise
all obscenity whether in matter or words proceeds from and creates evil manners and renders a gentleman contemtible
but amongst clowns he is most accepted is the greatest clown that useth it most
the pains we take to be pleasing ought to be spent only upon things honorable and of good fame
the reason why some words are immodest others signifying the same thing not is because these represent the displeasing object at a distance through another light and covered with another notion so that the offensivenes is not that which at first appears to the imagination so toads and vipers cause not that effect in us when seen a far off
it appears sometimes under a metaphor or some other translatitious expression which is a corrective to the harshnes and unpleasingnes of the other

the same cautions prescribed in speaking or greater are to be observed in writing the neglect of their pens hath ruined very many and particularly the great master of civility the author of galateo
for going to present

to the pope a petition by mistake he delivered a copy of licentious verses writ by himself whereby he lost the popes favor his own reputation and all hopes of further advancement

chap
ii
of prudence


the prudence here spoken of is not that wisdom of the philosophers which that we may live happily would never have us experience sorrow or trouble would reduce us to speculation abstinence from emploiment and a life abstracted from common conversation
that teacheth to menage action public affairs and negotiation with others this shews how to escape inconveniences and sufferings by withdrawing from busines and living with and to our selves only which that teacheth to avoid by discreetly governing and regulating our actions
the philosopher perswades us to chuse the perfectest the most quiet innocent retired manner of life this prudence to live most perfectly with the least inconvenience or evil consequents which may disturb our happines in a common or active life
the one adviseth temperance by abstaining from all banquets feasts this shews how to be abstemious tho you come to them
the one tells us that the way to avoid danger is never to go to sea this since we are embarked

would have us govern our selves and steer our course in the best manner
whether of these is better now dispute not but supposing a man to have already made choice of an active calling then prudence is of great force to foresee all consequents and avoid the bad to act effectually and the shortest way to chuse the best means to menage crosses and hardships and to be content with what success god shall give


signs of a wise man are these he rather hears then talks beleives not easily judgeth seldom and then not without great examination deliberates as long as his matter permits and when resolved is constant and changeth not without solid reason therefore having deliberated fears not to repent
he speaketh well of all defendeth the fame of the absent courteous not flattering readier to give then ask or receive smiles rather then laughs is moderately grave honoreth his superiors attributeth the glory of good actions to his companions rather then himself observes his friends but doth no unworthy action for their sake is ready to assist and pleasure all even the unknown yet without offending others considereth both events that whatever happens he may be like himself neither exalted nor dejected avoids anxiety melancholy and morosenes what he doth tho necessitated yet doth it not as unwillingly but makes a virtue of necessity is even in his carriage true in his words the same in shew and reality and beleives so of others when he hath no reason to the contrary he

admires none derides none envies none and despiseth none not the most miserable he delights in the conversation of wise and virtuous persons profereth not his counsel especially when he understands not well is content with his condition nor doth any thing through contention emulation or revenge but strives to render good alwaies even for evil
he laboureth to know so much as to be able to depend upon his own judgment tho he do it not
abi tu fac suniliter


a fool talks much and little to purpose is angry without cause trusts any one is restless and still changing place troubleth himself with what doth not concern him the more fool he is the more he understands other mens busines his own the less and therefore is alwaies ready to reprehend and advise seldom to obey he discerns not when flattered but sensible enough to fancy himself abus'd
he desires without choice and discretion and therefore is quickly weary of what he enjoies he resolves without advice and therefore suddainly changeth and that without reason
he is apt to refuse what he cannot avoid desire what he cannot obtain and repent what he cannot amend he laments the past is exalted with the present and negligent of the future
the first degree of folly is to think himself wise the second to proclaim it and therefore he hath an answer ready to every question and is never better by either counsel or affliction
as amongst wise men he is wisest that thinks he knows least so amongst fools he is the greatest that thinks he knows most


prudence depends upon experience without which no man of ever so great capacity can any more arrive to be a wise man then a fruit to maturity without time
and experience is either of other men which we see read or hear or of our own affairs
this is the harsher mistress and happy is he that can learn of the other and arrive to perfection tho in his old age
hence it is that most men understand that only wherein they are most practised as many know what is to be done but neither how to go about it themselves nor to direct others such have much study little experience
many can advise well but themselves cannot act
many can menage a busines if not opposed and many better if opposed as many are not able to beat or chaffer tho they know the prices and many ignorant of the prices yet bargain cunningly
for the rules of busines are the same tho the subjects are divers conversing much makes a man bold and confident and engaging in busines fits for more busines and therefore it is no wonder that many citizens merchants especially prove and in the late wars also excellent soldiers because much practised to treating and negotiation
the like is also of lawyers
but many of both these professions thereby accustomed to value small gains contract such a narrownes of spirit and tincture of interest that it scarce ever leaves them
nor do perceive lawyers fitter for state emploiment then merchants they having both particular trades and differing as to public government no otherwise then an east india or an hamborough merchant in reference

to traffick
for tho the professing of law may seem to intitle to somewhat more knowledge in governing of which laws are the rule yet in effect it doth not because their practise and study is about just and unjust about meum and tuum the petit iuterests and controversies of particular persons not the government of a prince over his people or his negotiations with his neighbors which depend upon different principles seldom considered by those who deale between private persons
besides that the tying of princes to the formalities of courts tediousness of processes and casting the laws of government into the mold of the laws of private interest must needs be great impediments unto it


this prudence you see is quite different from cunning the advantage of fools and wicked men who mistake them for the same
for the prudent mans aime is to secure himself and interest the wisedom of the serpent recommended to us by our saviour to be in such a condition in all estates as to be able justly honourably and openly to make use of all opportunities and occasions for his own advantage toward the obtaining of the great end of his creation
cunning measures justice by escaping punishment right by law and wisedom by success reputation by wealth or power and the satisfaction of others by his own interest
a prudent man deals so sincerely that he fears not the examination of his actions or purposes and is not afraid to have witnesses if it were possible of his thoughts
the crafty builds his house under ground celat tacet

dissimulat insidiatur praeripit hostium consilia and in order to his own advantage he looks upon all other men as enemies
and to these purposes he useth many artifices as taking advantage of the person if in necessity intangled in vice fear of punishment or discovery if in danger humor passion any weakness or ignorance he also watcheth the time if in mirth drinking sorrow if inadvertent if easy he makes use also of his authority reputation and superiority to impose upon inferiors
he pretends great kindness and affection in general expressions or particular ambiguous ones or such as he will not be obliged by for he purposeth nothing nor hath he or ever intends to have any friend
but his great engine is a smooth tongue and a competent stock of wit


persons passionate fanciful intemperate are wont to apprehend things strongly and so apprehended to beleive and affirm to others and act accordingly thenselves and if such men be of reputation or power they often do much harm
very wise men also are oftentimes too resolute and obstinate in their opinions for being used to thinking they apprehend much of their object in a short time they overlook the reasons circumstances probabilities collect consequences which actions familiarize the object to the faculty and this renders the reasons of the contrary side less probable
even as our conversation with a man breeds some degree of kindness and friendship to him tho the man himself be not worth our acquaintance
wherefore

every prudent man ought to be jealous and fearful of himself lest he run away too hastily with a likelyhood instead of truth and abound too much in his own sense


all estates are equall men may be happy in every state
for security is equal to splendor health to pleasure every state also hath its enemies for deus posuit duo duo unum contra unum
a rich man because rich the poor man hath as poor neighbours or rich ones that gape after that small which he enjoyeth beware therefore how you offend any man for the offended joins against you and be sure you hate no man tho you think him an evill or unjust person
nor envy any one above you you have enemies enough by your own state make no more but rather procure as many friends as you can to uphold and strengthen you
every man hath also an enemy within himself he that is not choleric is covetous is facil mean by nature for if he hath subdued these natural desires tis otherwise
nor can a choleric man say am to be pardoned tis natural to me such a one is not so
for that such a one hath also his infirmity his inclination which perhaps is harder to conquer then yours
besides what is according to nature is seldome perceived by us a choleric man perceives not when he is angry at least thinks it no great fault
therefore it is necessary to have an adviser


all men therefore are evil judges of themselves and think they do well many times when they sin and commit small errors when

they are guilty of crimes
it is also in our life as in arts and sciences the greater differences are easily discerned but of the smaller moments onely the wise and skilful in the art can judge
many vices also tho contrary yet are like to virtues the confines of both are the same and the exact limits and boundaries difficultly fixed as of pride and greatness of spirit religion and superstition quickness and rashness cheerfulness and mirth so of ambition and sufficiency government and tyranny liberty and licentiousness subjection and servitude covetousness and frugality and so of the rest
and yet prudence chiefly consists in this very exactness of judgement to discern the one from the other and give to every cause his proper actions and effects
it is therefore necessary for every one that desires to be a wise man to observe his own actions and the original of them his thoughts and intentions with great care and circumspection else he shall never arrive in any tolerable manner to the knowledge of what he doth well or ill
and lest all this diligence should be insufficient as the partiality to himself will certainly render it it is very requisite for him to chuse a friend or monitor who may with all freedom advertise him of his failings and advise him remedies
such a one mean as is a discreet and virtuous person but especially one that thrusts not himself upon the acquaintance of great persons nor upon emploiments scandalous for opportunities of injustice that bridleth his tongue and wit that can converse with himself and attends upon his own affaires whatever they be
insinuare

your self into a confidence with him and desire him to observe your conversation and seriously and friendly admonish you of what he thinks amiss and let not his modesty rest till he condescend to you for do not imagine that you live one day without faults or that those faults are undiscovered
most men see that in another which they do not in themselves
and he is happy who in the whole space of his life can attain to a reasonable freedom from sins and that with the help of old age also that great dompter and mortifier of our lusts and passions
if he inform you whether true or false take it not patiently but thankfully for the advantage is the same which is to break the inordinate affection you bear towards your self and be sure to amend thus you both get a friend and perfect your self in wisedom and virtue
when you consider that you must give account of your actions to your vigilant reprover that other men see the same imperfections in you as he doth and that tis impossible for a great man to enjoy the advantage of friendship except he first disrobe himself of those qualities which render him subject to flattery except he first cease to flatter himself
a good confessor in religion will supply much of such a monitors work tho the one doth it judicially the other only in familiar conversation
and how much more worthy is such a one of entertainment then those who come to your table to make sawces eat your meat censure their neighbors flatter and deride you


if a friend tell you of a fault imagine alwaies

which is most true that he telleth you not the whole for he desires your amendment but is loath to offend you
and nunquam sine querelâ aegra tanguntur


there is little or no difference betwixt not deliberating and deliberating in passion except that this is the worse as engaging more and more irrevocably in error
for he that being out of the way is resolved to go on straies the further

the a wiseman plaies is to foresee and avoid but the aftergame is to carry himself with courage and indifferency
and therefore cato falling into a calamity not by his own fault should not have rid himself of it by a greater wickednes but by his constancy and generosity have shewed to the world what a wise man should do in such a case

all mens apprehensions naturally are alike what one sees red another sees not green and aloes is not better to one and sweet to another and their first thoughts upon them are the same
and that one man is more learned is not because he knows otherwise then another but it is because he knows more consequences and more propositions by his greater industry and experience
the conceptions according to truth are alike and the same but false are infinite wherefore if you find one man single in his judgment be wary of him he either knows more then all others or there is some ill principle in him


no evil man but hath irregular passions which passions are offensive to evil persons more then to good for good men are humble complaisant
therefore one evil man agrees not with nor loves to deal with another


much of the trouble of this world proceeds from certain irregular humors and desires which many men indiscreetly espouse and because they are innocent they think them also prudent and rational
if other men endeavor to repress them as inconvenient tis ill taken and with trouble and disquiet being these are not unlike to such as have antipathy to certain meats that exposeth them to needless passions and impertinent affliction

wisedom is made to rule and yet magistrates generally are readier to make use of their power then wisdom of their will then reason
because it is easier shorter and complies more with the humor of mankind
yet the subjects prefer and often expect the other

a great general where ever he travelled went continually considering the situation of the country and casting with himself what was to be done if leading an army he should be assaulted there by an enemy
by which means he was alwaies provided against surprises
the same care doth every wise man take by pondering all the cases of danger and difficulty which may or are likely to occur in his emploiment


every man hath a tender place which when touched by the hand of god afflicts him and he complains
and those who are most engaged in the world have more tendernesses as riches family reputation bodily infirmities wherefore a wise man provides before hand a stock of patience and fortifies the dangers by good considerations and by taking off his affections and passions from them


the things of this world seem greater at distance the things of the other world greater near hand
because those are fully known and comprehended alwaies with passions of love fear
for they enter in by the senses which being natural and not free agents work ad ultimum virium and entertain their object as much as they can
besides the objects are themselves clothed with many circumstances pomps and shews which make them seem great and taking and without these they would be naked and nothing
but spiritual things move only the soul and spirit which receives not without arguing and disputing without something of truth and rejecting appearances
wherefore a wise man is wary of the things of this world and admits them not confidently

creaturae dei in odium factae sunt in tentationem animae hominum in muscipulam pedibus insipientium
for that which is the occasion to wise and virtuous men of obtaining and doing good is by their ignorance turned by fools to their disadvantage
indeed all things even wise counsel are by fools made either instruments or testimonies of their folly

iii
of conversation and discourse

conversation casual with many voluntary with few of busines to be denied to none
have many acquaintance one friend and no enemy
some keep company to spend their time and saunter away their age such care not much with whom they converse nor is their company either grateful or beneficial
others for pleasure and divertisement to laugh and make themselves merry and so pass their time
others for interest and that either honestly or deceitfully as by gaming debauching hectoring overreaching flattering
great care is to be taken in all conversation for we must do as the ancients feigned of their lamiae that within dores wore their eyes in their girdles but going abroad put them in their heads but still greater care is requisite in choice of such companions with whom a man is to converse much or a long time or to trust with busines of consequence
as the italians say measure it a hundred times before you cut it once at first standing upon your guard till you discover their inclinations
and

first avoid as much as you can the company

of all vitious persons whatsoever for no vice is alone and all are infectious

of swearers prophane and blasphemers lest almighty god lay to your charge the neglect of his interest and honor in your presence uncontrolledly affronted whilst you are ready to resent and vindicate every small offence done to your self
of hectors and those brutish persons who either for gain or satisfaction of their bestial arrogance care not whom they debauch or affront
insolent children of hell ruiners of so many persons and families
of scoffers who put their own faults in the back end of the wallet but discover all they know of others
with such no peace is durable
of a person scandalous either for profession or manners for you run his hazzard and espouse his disreputation
never expect any assistance or consolation in your necessities from drinking companions

avoid also consorting with those who are much superior or much inserior to you inferior not only in degree and external quality but especially in parts
tanti eris aliis quanti tibi fueris
your own thoughts and designs will be such as your companions are and low fortunes breed many times degenerous purposes
he that makes himself an asse tis fitting others should ride him
and it is a very mean ambition to be the best of his company
with open upright plain dispositions as also with the cheerful and facetious there is no difficulty in conversation except where they meddle too boldly with other mens lives but theirs is satyre not calumny

with resty froward ill natur'd humors who are hard to please and think it grandezza to be harsh and parsimonious of good words and supercilious towards their equals few converse who intend not to gain by them

from all good natur'd persons women and drink keep your secrets
and with such as are wholly bent upon their own interest discours not upon what concerns their interest

they who pretend to cunning observe and make much of a rule which think it is not amiss to know to beware of and fortify against but not to practise it which is to observe every mans imperfection for few there are but have such a one and accordingly to apply themselves
as for example
with such as are swelled with conceit of their nobility or wealth if they have busines they give them respect enough if they have not yet they pay them with their own coin no matter if they deceive themselves with the opinion that they are honored according to their merit or desire

all humorous persons are weak and conscious to themselves that they stray out of the plain way of the reason of mankind for it is discretion and judgment that corrects out irregular fancies and where virtue or vice intervene not conforms us to the common customs
wherefore he that will take the pains to comply with and seem to justify their folly rules them


such as having imposed upon themselves certain laws of ceremonies would also oblige others to the same which proceeds

many times from melancholy and not pride their weakness is manifest


with morose persons they deal freely openly and familiarly that they may think they see through their designs and so they are stricken in the right vein

those who are curious to pry into other mens matters are commonly malicious no friendship with them as neither with a proud nor any angry person

with such as are in disgrace with superiors they converse not much and are wary how they offer them help for they fasten as men drowning upon any shew of assistance

with such as are in grace with the prince they keep good correspondence and seek their favor and tho mean persons yet they despise them not for they are chosen by his judgment
but they do as they who in a dark night follow him that hath a torch tho a rogue or a beggar

give no man just cause of offence nor resent too vively injuries towards your self
but if after your care to avoid quarrelling you happen upon such brutes as either to try your mettal or out of a bestial love of injuriousnes for such hectors this age hath brought forth in greater plenty then any other ever read of the best way is to resent it briskly and threaten seriously at least if you do not chastize the insolency that makes injuring a profession

chuse therefore the conversation rather of ancient men for their testimony is of greater force of such persons as are famed for virtue

and wisdom for something is alwaies to be learned by them and such there are many but they offer not themselves but expect to be sought out and admit not every application without choice

so much for conversation it follows of discourse
men are commonly judged by their discourse and therefore it is necessary for a wise man to regulate that almost in the first place
discourse is either concerning

raillery and mirth

other mens lives and actions

occasional as history news
erudition and edification or
business and interest of self or friends


those who take pleasure in exposing others to contemt and derision either by imitating their actions or imperfections or by jeering and mocking them avoid as you would the heels of an horse that kicks every one he can reach if you cannot take the part of the abused blame the action spare the person or if the person be known excuse the action if neither can be done praise the person for some other good action or quality so have you an antidote against the poyson
indeed there is no greater enemy to peace and charity then the railleur
for as ordinarily it is the sooty oven that mocks the black chimney so one jeer seldome goes forth but it returns with its equal and they together beget a quarrel
besides to abuse inferiors argues a mean and contemtible spirit superiors is dangerous and a word often provokes them more then an action
to abuse a friend is to lose him a stranger to lose your self in his and the worlds

esteem
those mocks are most resented which touch a mans reputation chiefly that of wit or discretion for of that even fools are chary and every one rather confesseth his forgetfulness then ignorance
next those which are for particular actions rather then in general for they seem to have more of truth these of wit which are of some secret imperfection which are of that wherein a man prides himself
since francis time who giving charles the lie and challenging him to a duel was refused the lye hath been counted a great affront and many exaggerations are made of that abuse
but had not that king perhaps in justification of his own rashness said that he was not a gentleman that would take the lye do not beleive that would have deserved a severer chastisement then other imputations speak in conversation for laws take no more notice of that then others

yet it seems to condemn all raillery is to tether the wits and therefore if preserved in a mediocrity it might be allowed
for it makes men stand better upon their guard when they know that they are likely to hear again of their actions besides it inureth them to bear harsh words and bridle their passions
but to railly hansomely is very difficult for good jests are to bite like lambs not like dogs tickle not wound
and therefore tis requisite to have a third person of discretion to stroak over the severer nips and throw dust upon them when being heated they begin to sting one another
also with small miscarriages and misfortunes and such as happen without the parties fault you may be the bolder

and with such as bring no shame with them and such wherein many are concerned
the jeerer also must be content to tast of his own broth and the expert in this trade are wont to do as he who having in his youth taken great liberty to railly upon married persons in his declining age took a wife where any one might have had her for his mony and the first entertainment of his friends was the discourse of his own marriage to prevent all that could be said
in sum jeers are only then good when ex tempore when they seem to proceed from wit not anger or malice when they are intended for mirth and pastime not calumny when you are pleasant with his error or mistake not his shame and seldom please at second hand
but because these intentions are difficultly known because many persons are very captious and hasty and because at best it argues not a solid and universal wit but a peculiar dexterity and promtitude which is frequently accompanied with want of good invention as well as judgment a discreet person will not much engage himself in it nor render himself a fool to make others laugh but after he hath tried or times and finds not himself fit for it let him never endeavor it more


a kin to the railleurs are the drolls who turn all to ridiculousnes
their censure see in sen ep
marcellinum nondum despero etiamnum servari potest sed si cito porrigatur illi manus
est quidem periculum ne porrigentem trahat
magna in illo ingenii vis sed tendentis in pravum
faciet quod solet advocabit illas facetias

quae risum evocare lugentibus possunt in se primum deinde in nos jocabitur christians have greater arguments against this drollery that it grieves gods holy spirit and is contrary to that seriousnes and consideration requisite to religion
that there is nothing so sacred or prudent which by the petulancy of wit may not be made ridiculous consequently contemtible fit to be neglected and abolished
virgil we have seen publicly and even the holy writings we heard to have been travesty by those who spare neither their souls nor reputation to prove themselves buffoons and shew their abilities and ingenuity in folly
and this indeed is the great engine charged against heaven the only and trusty weapon wherewith dirty potsheards disciples of julian the apostate porphirius epicurus and the rest of that brutish heard bark and grin against a deity
when all true reason and sober consideration as well as the other creatures justify their maker yea when even the dogs revenged him upon lucian the great professor of scurrility and scoffing as well as epicurism and irreligion
but besides this disposition proceeds from a laschety and levity unbefitting any person of quality and emploiment and increaseth the same inclinations both in the droller and the auditors
for as a wit used to versifying is ready to put all its thoughts into rime or a mathematician is presently reducing all his fancies to somewhat in those sciences every one casting his thoughts into that mold whereunto they are accustomed so do drolls reject all serious notions and accept and fix upon the light and emty
and therefore

we see that when such persons aim at any thing grave and serious it misbecometh them as done out of order and season
thus doth mirth pleasingly by little and little steal away the judgment rendring it vain studious of and delighting in that which wise men avoid laughter
and these men whilst they think to fool others become themselves really what others are in their imagination


in discourse concerning other persons familiar amongst women and calumny is most frequent because all men had rather hear evil of another then good
perhaps thinking thereby to justify their own faultiness at best indulging their which is grounded upon a too high estimation of themselves and too low of others

this evil speaking is very frequently used by many who pretend to extraordinary godliness whose bitings are also more dangerous and venemous with those persons who mistake their formality for seriousnes and their gravity for reality in religion
but even in ordinary conversation men are wont also to defame their neighbours without any ceremony design or remorse
from both these sorts of people especially the former turn away as much as you can but be sure to be none of them nor partake with them in their calumniations
consider what you say of others others say of you
before you calumniate think am not the same or as bad take heed of doing that which may hurt but cannot do good for tis madness to make enemies without cause and it is better to suppress then

vent and satisfy a piece of wit or a foolish passion
the great rule is nothing but truth before the face and nothing but good behind the back

beware also of censuring nations conditions or states of men as well as particular persons for there is no nation or condition wherein are not many good and none so good wherein are not many bad
tis also a great honor and wisdom to pass by the of others against your self
charles the of france demanded of one much emploied by him and on whom he had bestowed many favors what thing in the world could alienate his mind from and bring him in dislike with his prince the gentleman answer'd an affront
this person seems to have bin very sensible indeed but whether his discretion had merited the favor of his prince much doubt
certainly the behavior of antigonus was much more generous who when one told him that such a one affronted him answered it may be so but will not be affronted
augustus advised tiberius not to be offended with peoples speaking ill of them it sufficeth saith he that we can secure our selves from their doing us harm
when one said he was a tyrant he answered were so he durst not have said it
to one calling him dwarf well said he then will get higher shoes
bernard when one bid him get out like a dirty priest replied you are mistaken came in a coach
and truly since all these evil tongues are conquered by silence one would think the victory easy did not experience shew us that the great remedy against bursting is giving vent

there is no reason that the effect which may proceed from divers causes should be attributed to one an action of seeming disrespect may either come from an intention to affront from negligence from having some other busines in his thoughts interpret not therefore such actions as affronts and the rather because it is our duty to take every thing by the best handle


the most innocent grateful and universal discourse is telling stories and modern rather then ancient
some are so well stocked with this trade as to be able to answer any question or parallel any case by a story which is if well done a very great perfection of eloquence and judgment
and in telling stories avoid too often said he and said hear you me mark me be perfect also that you need not recant stammer or repeat things said before be not tedious in impertinent circumstances nor make your own glory the chiefest concern
tell no lye in your discourse especially not gasconades and improbable rhodomontades wherein some out of weaknes and lowness of spirit and parts take as much pleasure as others in drinking when not thirsty and think they then overwit the company
be not hyperbolical and extravagant especially in praising and dispraising for the wit takes away the credit whereas the end of speech was first to make us understood then beleived
and if you be convinced of an error for truths sake acknowledg it and change your opinion for this ingenuity is greater because rarer
and remember that

one chance falling out as the astrologues prognosticate gets them reputation and their thousand lyes are not taken notice of but to a wise man one lye doth more disgrace then thousand truths can recover

when news comes from an uncertain author tho probable and expected yet suspend your beleif because men easily report what they desire or expect but rather give heed to certain extravagant and unexpected relations as unlikelier to be invented
and when you tell news engage not for the truth of it

in your discourse rational or of erudition skip not from one subject to another as do fanatics and other ignorant sciolists who are never at ease till they have vented all they think themselves to know above other men
neither maintain an argument with ignorant nor contradictive persons nor think that you are bound to convert or instruct the whole world least of all with vain drolls who make your seriousnes their sport
be content to satisfy with reason not especially your own authority a refuge many fly unto when worsted if they know there is no examining books such as are capable and disposed
in reasoning the most excellent way wherein the best able is certain to carry the cause and which will bring the controversy to a speedy determination is by asking questions and proceeding still upon the adversaries concessions· which he cannot without shame retract by syllogisms is more pedantic
this is plato manner of discoursing

pedantry is a vice in all professions it self

no profession
for a is not therefore a pedant but he only who importunately impertinently and with great formality shews his learning in scraps of latin and greek or troubles himself with knowledg of little use or value or values himself above his deserts because of something he knows as he conceives more then ordinary or despiseth others not skilled in his impertinencies or censures all authors and persons confidently without reason
and whoever doth thus be he divine lawyer statesman doctor or professor he is a pedant

do not in ordinary company treat of matters too subtil and curious nor too vile and mean nor of things unseasonable as of religion in mixed or young company or at table but in all discourse have an intention to better your self and others
which that you may do contrive as much as you can before hand of what to discourse and lay your scene which afterwards you may menage as you please
a man may judiciously discourse when either he knows the subject very well or when desirous to learn a submission and ingenuity very grateful in company or when necessitated to discourse and then he must do it discreetly and doubtingly unless he very well know his auditory
cautious also must he be who discourseth of that he understands amongst persons of that profession an affectation that more scholars then wisemen are guilty of mean to discourse with every man in his own faculty except it be by asking questions and seeming to learn

you may freely and safely discourse of matters

of philosophy mathematics travels government of forreign countries histories of times past or present of other places husbandry and the like which subjects concern no mans reputation and therefore none much care what part you take

discourse tho amongst learned men laies no grounds of science but supposeth them and therefore study is necessary without which who so adventures amongst scholars is like a lady that hath excellent medicines but neither knows whereof they are made nor how to apply them effectually
have a care also that your income exceed your expences that you hear and read more then you speak for he that spends out of the stock of wit and memory is quickly bankerupted but knowledg and learning continually improve by discourse
cunning discoursers to avoid baffling are wont at first to lay down a proposition easily defensible to which they may retreat in case of necessity but defend the other out works also as long as they can
mens wits and apprehensions are infinitely various nor is there any opinion so extravagant which hath not some followers and maintainers who fit their hypotheses to it
wherefore do not censure any thing on a suddain as ridiculous for tho it please not you it may another as wise
every man makes himself the measure of all others for truth and falshood wisdom and folly
learning and ignorance and the like
and who is able to denudate himself of this false opinion or prejudice at least to truth

but from hence it proceeds that we esteem

him knowing that knows more or as much and him ignorant that knows less then our selves
him also virtuous that is according to our sentiment and degree
also that all men are more ready to blame anothers errors then praise his virtues
and that a man knowing what another doth not and being ignorant of what another knows yet knows not his own ignorance but consequently values himself and despiseth the other

to man alone not beasts nor angels hath nature given a nauseousnes of the present
the best things in the world if not accompanied with variety become distastful
and nothing sooner then discourse which is so much carefullier to be menaged as the eare is sooner cloy'd then the eie
prudent eies are kept open by reason ordinary persons by wit
old men commonly discourse of grave and edifying subjects divinity government history young men rather of pleasant hunting fashions travels wonders every man chuseth to discourse of that he best understands and loves

concerning business
a doctor being intreated by his nephew to give some rules for guiding and securing himself in negotiation and contracts after long study told him he could give him but one which was alwaies to have to do with virtuous persons
but for many reasons this rule tho a perfect one is hard to be practised and therefore beseech you be content with such imperfect ones as my reading or experience can furnish
if any one tell you that it is to no purpose to think long upon any matter that they are only wise men who can dispatch business ex tempore that consulting is but a dull formality and that a man sees as far into a thing at first as by much consideration say boldly that man is a fool the more you think the more and clearer you shall understand
therefore men of most leisure do business the best and those who have much business must have much pardon
therefore men used to business do it better because they have thought of it before either in the same or a like case

a prudent man doth no business rashly without reason and advice and he adviseth also as long as he can and that first with his own thoughts which being not sufficient he takes in also the assistance of other mens counsel and heareth others tho he follow

perhaps his own
most men advise for their own interest and therefore happy is he who hath a friend

to order your thoughts well in deliberation endeavor to put your business into an history considering what is to be done or said first what afterwards
for the hindrance of prudent resolutions is the confusion and disorder of thoughts which by this method is cleared by it also you shall quickly discover where the difficulty is and know when you have done
it is also very convenient to write down your reasons pro con in deliberation for the mind by this means is freed both from the confusion and burden of those arguments
give not your advice or opinion before asked for that is to upbraid the others ignorance nor attribute ill success to the neglect of your councel nor be angry if your advice be not followed
neither accustom your self to find fault with others actions except vitious for you are not bound to weed other mens gardens
be not too eager in counselling others for the evil success which happens frequently to good advice will be laid to your charge and seldom shall you be thanked for the good
it happeneth frequently to men that are wise by experience and not learning that they cannot give a reason of their opinion and advise tho it be really the best as a meer mechanicall workman knows there is a fault in the work tho he cannot tell punctually what it is
despise not such mens opinions for their want of discourse

in deliberations where there is reason on both

there is one great perfection in doing business which is that tho you set your mind and thoughts upon business yet do not engage your affections at least deeply in it
for thus shall you both have your understanding clear at all times and not be disturbed if you miscarry which you must make account will often happen unto you
besides precipitiousness impatience or not staying to take the opportunity and time your business is frequently the ruine of many noble designs and all passion whatsoever deteriorates your negotiation if your reason will not bring you to this indifferency experience will
a l'adventure tout vient point qui peut attendre
in treating about business you understand you have an advantage to propose first in what you understand not tis best to receive propositions
and if you have a doubtful cause an inconstant adversary or find him disposed to comply with your desire defer not to dispatch

in business except buying and selling you shall find very few persons speak to the purpose therefore let every man talk his fill rather then interrupt provoke him to speak for he will blurt out many things to your advantage some out of ignorance and inexperience others on purpose standing on circumstances

and things of small consequence
women commonly as weakest are most extravagant and at an end or the midst of their story must drop a tear for being themselves compassionate they think others are so too and that is their interest

the difficulty of dispatch is not from the business it self wherein a man may easily see what is necessary or fittest to be done but it is in perswading your interest in communicating so much and no more then concerns you using such reasons only as are proper for your matter in applying them to every ones understanding inclination and at a fit time and in taking off the opposition of adversaries
for there is no interest that hath not its contrary and sometimes also so forcible a one as is to be conquered onely with mony which is a sword that cuts even a gordian knot
all things concernning the menagery of affaires are reduced to these heads


the ground or occasion

the end to be brought about

the reasons whereupon the affair is grounded

the difficulties likely to be encountred
the answers which may be made to the reasons

and the replies to them

the advantage of the affaire to the other party

examples of like cases

but alwaies be sure to remove the principal obstacle

some men are apt to beleive what they hope for or desire others are never secure till

they see and enjoy
and this doubtless is the better because it encreaseth diligence good success and less affliction
wherefore of future things imagine and provide for the worst tho of actions dubious of other persons you conceive the best

fear is a necessary passion and hath a great share in all our affairs
the great and general defect being negligence laschety and love of ease fear discuseth these
he that is in continual apprehension of evil watcheth to avoid prepareth to rencounter and is cautious not to give admittance to danger but endeavors to secure his condition and remove further from evil
in things of the other world men are more apt to hope because they have not so clear an apprehension nor so firm a beleif or not so frequent consideration concerning them but in matters of this world more apt to fear for all mens hopes frequently fail their fears seldom
besides the loss of what we enjoy goes nearer and is more sensible to us then the future good may advantage wherefore in treating with most men you know the best topic
and seldom is it seen but that fear also gets the better of love and therefore good magistrates trust not only to love but will in some degree be feared also
secrecy and reservednes is of infinite use for besides that such are not easily prevented and interrupted men are still commenting and in suspense about every motion of theirs which gets great reputation
besides suddain things do more amaze and confound then things foreseen or expected
but you need not put your self to the trouble of secrecy where you fear no opposition

many time also your secrecy is to be concealed nor is an inquirer into the business you would hide rudely to be denied for that many times breeds jealousies but by prudent and courteous dissimulation to be fenced withal and his thoughts dextrously avoided rather then forcibly returned upon him
he that is a good practitioner in this trade becomes master of his thoughts that came to sist him

beware of trusting to your fortune for most men are fortunate for a time and in some things only nor is he fortunate who hath a good occasion offered to him for it is prudence to take hold of and use it but he that hath it presented twice
think not such as these to be good consequences
he is a good man therefore doth nothing ill he is a bad man therefore doth nothing well
he is a wise man therefore doth nothing foolishly consider this well and stand upon your guard
for every one hath errors from whence sometimes greater other times lesser mischeifs arise happy are they whose errors happen to be in small matters and which come betimes and are remediable
he that doubts not knows either all things or nothing
and he that imagines never to commit an error his next pretence must be to divinity

the things of this world never stand in one stay but are alwaies moving their own way and if we perceive not their alteration it is because our age is shorter then theirs
this observation is of importance to many purposes virtue and vice wisdom and folly are

but good and bad prosperous and adverse in the seed

when we read in histories the great changes of government we much wonder at them and are apt to pitty the sufferers
but providence hath so ordered that great alterations ordinarily happen by little and little so that both reason and nature either accomodate to them or have time to escape and provide other waies
he that entreth into danger without considering it is a beast he only is valiant who knowing the danger embraceth it cheerfully whether out of necessity or honor
yea tho he knows and supposeth that all dangers have not their effects but that some are prevented by industry some by courage and prudence and some fortune and the course of things gods providence casts of
dealing with merchants and men of busines and virtue cut of ceremonies and declare the busines at length rather then for this is apt to raise mistakes besides a man is not alwaies in disposition or ability to fathom the depth of an affair with a short cord

when you have extorted from a person what he obstinately denied you need not doubt but at the same time also to obtain another he would not willingly grant
for when a man is forced as it were to let go his hold of what he most firmly grasped he unbends his hand and abandons whatever it contained
commota semel excussa mens stabilitate suâ ei servit quo impellitur
thus the parliament proposed to the king together with the bill of attainder of the earl of strafford which he was

formerly resolved not to grant a bill for perpetuating the parliament which tho of far greater consequence he scrupled not

deser as long as you can the doing of a thing against your mind rather then give a positive denial for accidents many times divert the design and deliver you from that strait wherein a refusal may deeplier engage you
never dispatch an evil and difficult busines so absolutely but that if possible you leave place to undertake and introduce it again
time and opportunity alter many things and make that pass smoothly which formerly would have bin refused had not your dexterity left open the door for a new treaty
all men naturally avoid persons inquisitive into other mens affairs for such commonly are lavish of their intelligence and thereby breed quarrels and spread animosities besides that themselves are apt to envy and malign others that being the concern which breeds their inquisitivenes
the reason why things conform not to the general desire and expectation of the world is because they who give beginning and ending to busines are but few and many are those who desire and expect
he is often to blame who neglects a present good for fear of a future evil except it be nigh at hand and in a manner certain
so is he who strives to avoid all difficulties for more things affright then hurt us
and there are many changes in this world
cosa nasce cosa
and in judgments of the future we see wise men frequently mistaken

poor meanpeople and wranglers conclude

not any treaty nor offer all they mean to give till they be forced till they see the treaty ready to break up and they think that they get a considerable advantage by such restines and importunity as indeed they do if they deal with ingenuous persons
so petty tradesmen love to call their customers back

since grateful and virtuous persons are so rare value the service of such as are joined with you in the same interest or danger and you may more reasonably expect to be assisted by him that hopes to get by you then by him who hath already received favors from you
and remember that a crown in your purse doth you more honor then ten spent
when in consultations there are contrariety of opinions seldom is the best chosen and the more persons argue the further they are from agreeing the love of their own opinion insinuating it self by little and little with their reason
wherefore sometimes the most importunate prevails sometimes he that finds out a medium not that this expedient is alwaies the best but that persons in heat of dispute cannot easily pass over or fully consent to a contrary

thrust not your self to be moderator or umpire in controversies till required and then tis better to exaggerate the mischeifs of disagreement then benefits of concord for fear is stronger then love
many are wont alwaies to take the adversaries part
but it is a very hard thing to reconcile men at first their passions being high and animosities great
but after they are reasonably wearied with law or other inconveniences tis not difficult to find out a medium which may save both their honors which is

that both commonly desire
a worthy gentleman being to reconcile two persons first made them swear both to stand to his determination and that neither of them should reveal upon what terms they were reconciled

every man is more apt to love cherish and trust in him on whom he hath already bestowed most courtesies esteeming him as his creature this is the cause of the great love of parents toward their children and he that loveth and doth favors obligeth and submitteth himself to the receiver so that for fear of losing what he hath already bestowed he must bestow more
wherefore if you seek the favor of a great person accept courtesies from him and not from others
he that would perswade great men let him first begin with the weakest by probable arguments good words and humble carriage he shall obtain their friendship and by their authority tho but fools draw in the wiser
mean wits alwaies distrust subtil arguments and logical heads and great men for the most part are of an inartificial understanding and therefore by seemingly naked truth and plainness are brought to your opinion
in great councils and meetings there are alwaies some leading men whom if you gain your business is done
amongst multitudes one adversary can do more harm then many friends can do good

there are some who are children even in mature age and of them a man must not say they are
years old therefore they will do as men of
years old
but concerning those and all such heteroclites look at their present

customs and menagery of their private affairs
for if you see an aged man vehement suddain in his resolutions following the impetus of his passions hold that man for a child not moved with reason unconstant to day resolving without consideration and in the same manner reversing it to morrow

nothing is well done or said in passion tho there may be just cause of being passionate but less or more all passion according to the degree of it hinders reason and deliberation
but beware instead of passion you fall not into slyness and cunning for these two passion and cunning do many times shoulder out one another and generally people without passion are look'd upon as sly and crafty which of the two is worse there being more of the voluntary in it
it is good therefore sometimes to seem passionate if you be not so
in all treating with other persons try first what may be done by fair means good words hopes of gratitude before you come to power or passion
and let power either of your self or the law be the last

when you consult with a friend about any business be not hasty to receive a present answer but give him time to consider for the common and first conceptions of all men are much what the same at least his extempore is not equal to your premeditated
physicians and lawyers answer out of their trade and as they pretend by certain rules and cases very like if not the same with yours but it seldom falls out that the same case in dispatch of business falls out twice or if it do yet it is clothed with such various and differing circumstances

according to which a wise man frames his opinion that it is very difficult to give judgement

the manner is when you propose a thing which you are afraid will hardly be accepted or granted propose it by parcels that one piece be digested before the other be swallowed
it is better to be near to and serve a prodigal then a thrifty and parsimonious prince tho for the publick this is more advantagious
for the prodigal is forced to use divers oppressions and more suffer by his profuseness then are benefited by it and they commonly are most benefited by it who least deserve it
it seems that princes are more free and masters of their own will then other men but it is contrary in such as govern prudently for they are necessitated to act with infinite cautiousness and consideration frequently to court even mean persons and swallow many a bitter pill at their hands
wherefore pardon your prince if he do not all things exactly according to the precise rule of wisedom
he that having bin the means to advance another to high degree thinks to govern him cancels his own courtesy
if you find that any one hath spoken ill of you to your patron take no notice of it nor be eager to vindicate your self but continue your emploiment without complaining and your innocency will both appear and prevail at last

great enterprises are not to be relinquished because we cannot reconcile all difficulties for were all things easy they were not great and could all objections difficulties be solved little were left to your courage or discretion
some

things gods providence and the course of things render easy and others are difficult only because we see not through them at present

the more you come into favor the less admit cabals and juntos to avoid suspition
nor converse much with the ordinary servants for so they will respect you the more
yet lest you be hated be courteous in your salutes discourses offers of service but especially in giving them reasons in your discourse for then they think you do not despise them
but if they hate you for any good service done to your patron sell it him dear that he may be obliged to protect you
no patron really loves a servant wiser then himself let him pretend what he pleaseth and therefore if you be a person of understanding covet not to be too near him as of his for patrons are not pleased that such persons should pry too nearly into their actions and inclinations
wise men when they have auy way come in competition with their prince have alwaies ceded
yet it is better to be feared and hated then despised
wherefore chuse rather to be a severe searcher into and censurer of actions then to be undervalued for taking no notice of them
if spies abound in a court discourse in generals and give them no cause to think themselves discovered by you
neutrality makes the slowest but surest progress for the neuter is connived at through the others mutuall envying

a weak patron is easily gained but no considerable advantage of honor or profit can

be got by him a wise master is jealous easily lost and then never recovered
if your master have any near kindred keep fair with all for they will certainly prevail and stick to the best beloved

if you light upon a master that is inquisitive after your words and actions know that he intends to keep you under
pray to god not to light upon a cunning master for either you shall be ruin'd by him or at best tired with standing upon your guard
in this case make shew not to perceive his subtilty but to admire his ingenuity
sic ars deluditur arte
if your patron by discourse or actions endeavors to conceal any of his vices be sure he holds that dear is deeply engaged in it and would enjoy it without a rival
to avoid envy affect not expence and ostentation but mind reality
for be sure that way accounted so honourable leads streight to destruction

chap
of servants
since slavery was banished christendom a servant is no other then one hired to such emploiment and under such terms as if well observed the difference is not great between the condition of the master and the servant
for none can compel another to serve him against his will nor can contract with him for his service but at the same time he will bargain with me for his salary
take him under my roof make provision for his sustenance defend him from his enemies as well as from hunger cold and diseases
and what doth he for this he serveth me no he serveth himself
the same labor he would undergo in his own house to maintain himself and perhaps with great anxiety he doth in mine with pleasure
so that now service is nothing but a compact betwixt the rich and the poor for their mutual advantage
and to demand or imagine that a servant should quit his own interest profit and advantage to procure his masters is a folly no considering man will be guilty of
therefore let the master command according to reason and sweetness not so imperiously or with such opprobrious language as may justly discontent or chase away a servant
if he obey with cheerfulness and affection he may at length perhaps make his masters interest his own

if you pay him not his wages he will pay himself

in controversies let the master sometimes cede to his servant to keep his mettal in breath and not too severe if the faults be small or committed for want of judgment or through a little itch of liberty
let the master be sometimes blind and the servant deaf
but faults of malice or impiety are not to be pardoned
the first such fault is the servants the second divided between master and servant the third wholly the masters
correct him not before strangers but if correction amend him not rid your hands of him both for his sake your own and the scandal of others
rich men are inclined to pride and contemt of others for having wealth which commands all things in the great market of this world they are apt to become insolent petulant impatient of disobedience denial reproof or advice
and because ostentation of happiness is one part of it therefore are rich men vain glorious desirous to be observed and to live splendidly
and men newly enriched and without their own industry more vain then they who are born so or have by industry acquired great estates
men in power also are more honorable gallant generous and less vain then the rich
also because great estates are commonly acquired with little and small ones not without great labor therefore are rich men apt to exalt themselves as either above others in parts or the favor of god both which are very great and dangerous errors but difficultly to be eradicated

let them not therefore mistake morosity for grandeur and passion for greatness
it is better to subdue your servants reason as well as his strength and diligence

and those who betake themselves to the rich are to comport with their follies impertinencies and contumelies and to conceale them
it is better they should love their masters but by no means hate them or speak evil of them behind their backs
not dispute their masters judgment not vy wit taunt or rally with them not use familiarity without leave but to put on patience when they put on a livery
to admonish and reprehend is not an action of an inferior and an affectionate disrespect obligeth not so much by its sincerity as it provokes by its ill example wherefore when you advise your superior do it so as it may be accepted
and let not the master refuse to hear the advice of his servant tho he follow it not
no man ever miscaried through excess of respect or was disgraced for retaining a constant and proportionate sense of his patrons grandeur
yet patrons love not sullen melancholic austere grave or silent servants
a master ought not to divertise himself with his inferiors nor make his servants privy to his infirmities and failures but if he do the servant must not presume nor heighten himself for it
but let him be secret and faithful to him

let the servant also know that it is harder to menage well his masters affairs then his own let him therefore be more careful
for he hath more temtations to negligence and dishonesty
besides his masters business is not

alwaies to be menaged the best way but that he likes best

put your servants to emploiments proper for their condition years capacities but never upon unnecessary trouble for that is to abuse not use a servant and will cause them to hate you
those servants justly expect to be rewarded extraordinarily whose industry and diligence seem to merit it
for gratitude being the least of virtues ingratitude is the most infamous of vices especially in a great person and this rewarding is so to be done as the other servants do not resent it
that therefore is best done after some signal service
but beware of equalling all your servants in your gifts or rewards for the discreeter and superior hold it an affront to be equalled with the rest and the inferior made proud but none more obliged then they who catch mony thrown about in a solemnity to render thanks to the donor
some there are who defer their rewards till some festival as christmas or easter but then the day is thanked not the giver and after you are accustomed to it tis expected as due and part of wages not kindness and bounty
it is better to be somewhat sparing then liberal to a good servant for as he grows full he inclines either to be idle or to leave you
and his murmuring you may govern by a seasonable reward
it seldom happens that a reconciliation of master and servant is sincere therefore return not to a service whence you have been ejected

in places which concern mony employ not your kindred nor use them as your servants

for they will presume upon their condition and you cannot with reputation break with them
and truly if you be a single person cannot forbear to recommend to you a saying of a great prelate that a courtier at rome ought to have
ducats rent
in his purse and be
miles from his kindred

of giving receiving and promising
it is uncivil and unfitting for a man to oblige another to keep a promise disadvantagious to him or one made in mirth passion hast unadvisedly in civility or compliment or one obsolete as also not to admit of a reasonable excuse for the failure of a promise

it becometh every man to promise nothing but what he intends to perform yet many tho justly denied are much displeased for all men govern not themselves by reason
insomuch that if a person desire to engage your indeavors in his business if you shew him the difficulties tho you promise your assistance he commonly takes it for a denial or a sign that you intend not seriously to befriend him
for these and such like reasons the fashion is to give good hopes to all suiters and to promise very freely and largely
and they find thereby great advantage as they think for carrying on business
the performance is

sometimes hindred by unexpected casualities sometimes a good and plausible excuse goes a great way sometimes the party suffers himself to be wheedled with good words
yet tis so ignoble and dishonorable a thing for a man to be worse then his word that it never ought to be done
but this may he do he may entertain all suiters with general or conditional promises and fair words and tho all men ought to look at effects and not words yet have good words a wonderful power take heed of being fool'd by them suppose because every one values himself and his merits at more then he is worth and he is offended when that price is not set upon him as himself thinks to deserve

at court they are wont to promise and offer service largely especially to those who are not likely to make use of them but towards ordinary conversants they are more wary because better known

grant a courtesy if you intend it without much asking for that doubles it
to keep long in suspense is churlish and by long expectation the passion to the favor dies and the courtesy is not esteemed nor thanks heartily given for it
monsignior pamfilio afterwards innocent in his nunciature in france and ever after was called
from his frequent use of that answer to suitors
do your favors cheerfully not as if they slipt through your fingers or were stollen or wrested from you
and do them readily for the intreater submits himself to the intreated his modesty therefore must be considered
non cosa piu cara che quella che con priegh· si compra
do

them also without considering whether they be lost or likely to be recompensed for a magnanimous and generous person looks not to receive as much again for that is the courtesy of tradesmen
be not as the barbarous king of madagascar that demanded more for the cowes he gave then his subjects for those they sold for he said that his good will and kindness was to be recompensed
and if you deny do it with good words as if you were sorry you could not pleasure him

be not niggardly of that which costs you nothing as counsel countenance and the like
but beware of being security rather offer to lend mony of your own upon others bond
and by no means sell your ceremonies nor pay your creditors friends and servants with good words looks and smoak
after a courtesy done if you upbraid it you lose it one principal end of giving being to oblige the receiver to your self and interest
neither too much undervalue nor extol your gift but rather diminish and excuse when you give seeming pleas'd so small a matter stood in such stead and was so well placed and accepted that you shall be ready to do greater service upon occasion but when you receive a favor rather augment it
he is not ungrateful who cannot but who will not repay will not through malignity and evil disposition
wherefore a generous spirit is satisfied when the receiver declares his acceptance of the courtesy and acknowledgeth the favor and honor for that shews he hath a good mind to be grateful if he were able

after a courtesy received be not in hast to return

another for that shews you are not willing to be beholden nor return a much greater for that seems to reproach the smalness of the received

those who willingly alwaies receive and never give or those who would alwaies give and never receive of which melancholic generous humor some few there are are not much esteemed in conversation
towards other mens servants the custom of the country is to be followed
in many places the master takes it ill if his servant be considerably rewarded for what himself gives
but it is not so with us where to lodg at a friends house is dearer besides the inconvenience then at a common inne and where what a friend sends is perhaps a present but not a gift when the receiver paies double the value to the messenger and an acknowledgment to the sender
however in all places in entertainment great care is taken the servants be pleased for the tongues of idle persons are
if you desire a courtesy from one beholding to you tis ingenuous not to put him in mind of it least he think you tax him of ingratitude
a favor done to a man sinking or in any danger is alwaies very obliging both because it testifies sincerity without expectation of a return and a good opinion of the receiver to whom the giver needs not to be favorable
most men do more for interest either of gain or friends then reason
more for favor then obligation
but mony if well and discreetly applyed seldom fails of its effect
a man apt to promise is as apt to forget it

of prudence in acquiring emploiment and preferment

presupposing that a person out of a good and sincere intention to serve his prince and country desires to employ himself or be employed in such a condition it is necessary first that he avoid such hinderan ces which are contrary to and destructive of his design
that he use proper means to the compassing it


hindrances are
pride which renders him intolerable to him that should raise him and tho to avoid this such men as are most insolent toward their inferiors are most supple even to baseness towards their superiors yet is it very difficult to conceale this vice from any considering person even because one of these actions betrayeth the other both proceeding from the same lowness and vileness of spirit
where it is it renders its owner impatient of advice admonition· contradiction even in his own affairs by which he becomes a prey to flatterers despised of all good men odious to all upon whose dues and interests he usurps and unfit to be employed

anger for what prince desires to be served by or chuse instruments out of bedlam and if prudence consist in much deliberation

precipitiousness the daughter of anger is incompatible with it
if it be said that angry men are good natur'd yet what discreet person will suffer such and so many impertinencies to enjoy now and then a little good nature so many storms to have sometimes fair weather who will be content to stay for a little reason till the choler be scum'd and the boiling ceased two to one in all things against the angry man was a saying of cardinal mazarine

so following good companions or intemperance and lewd women discover secrets render a man contemtible and unuseful for besides that strong drinks and tobacco fill the head with imaginations hot headedness jealousies when a man should hast to his emploiment he must go to sleep or to his mistress

he that is by nature lazy and slothfull ought not to intermeddle with public affairs for tho in quiet and dull times he may serve well enough to pursue formalities yet when any activeness he fills up the room of a better person

covetousness is not so detrimental as liberality and bounty discreetly placed are advantagious
but
there is nothing worse then an unbridled toung


he that would serve god as well as his king and save his soul as well as make his fortune must beware of such temtations as are most frequent in that sort of life
such are ambition desiring advancement for an evill end or more then he deserves or at unseasonable times or too eagerly or for his own private advantage and not to serve the public
envy at others preserment with all the consequents of

it hatred detraction faction partiality and the like
adulation or complacency with the prince or other great person in vitious or unfitting courses
and the like


it is impossible to be preferr'd if not known and so known as approved also and no man can reasonably be offended for being passed by and neglected if he use not rational means to make himself accepted
such means are of many sorts
as
by merit and that either by ordinary or extraordinary good service

by friends being introduced or recommended by such as are in favor and reputation with the prince

by fear and terror being so considerable as that the prince is glad for his own security to employ him

by flattery and evil insinuations into the princes affections

he that hath no other introduction must shew himself diligently that the prince who observeth more then he seemeth to do may take notice of him besides there falls out frequent occasions of employing him that is present and a constant attendance tho voluntary is a kind of service
and he that loseth a beginning tho not so considerable loseth an introduction to greater matters


there are few of whose merits the prince can be a just and accurate judg because he is not witness to all the circumstances of their actions
besides to know a man requires much familiarity with and observation of him
but such precise knowledg is not requisite

and a prince may with but a reasonable observation discern a wise man from a fool and a virtuous man from one inclined to those vices which render him unfit for service
but if a prince be forc'd to see only with others eyes and hear with others ears he had need to be very wary for those are very seldom indifferent toward the person recommended inform more frequently for their own interest then the princes
wherefore a wise man beleives little but keeps himself in suspense till the truth be manifest

he that is chosen by the judgment of his prince and not by the recommendation of others hath a great advantage for if he prove well the prince is inwardly proud of his choice and will certainly employ him further for he looks upon him as his creature
wise and subtil princes seldom prize or advance a man wiser then themselves except in some case of great necessity
they are also commonly very wary of employing such as are recommended by public fame except it be in smaller matters
consider therefore what emploiment you conceive most suitable to your genius and condition whether war or peace sea or action or advice governing or finances and providing mony or necessaries
and endeavor to render your self very able in that tho it is fitting also you should not neglect other matters
also disrobe your self as much as you can of all particular interest and at least prefer in your designs the advantage of your prince and the public

a small emploiment in youth or betimes is

much more to be valued then a great one in old age for cosa nasce cosa
one business twists in another
and suffer not your self as much as is possible to be out of possession of doing somewhat
if you be yet by continual presentation of your self let it be known that you stay there ready to be hired

it is good sometimes to sue for an emploiment tho you be sure to miss it
for by that means you shew your self to imagine that you have some pretences to be considered
and your superior having once denied you will be more ready to pleasure you another time for fear of discontenting you especially if you be a man of parts
but by no means put in for every thing for that discovers your ambition and a conceit of your self that you are fit for every thing
you cannot be master of what emploiment you please but your commendation must be well to perform that you are actually possess'd of
in a comedy he that acts a slave well deserves as much as he that personates a king
tis a comfortable hearing friend come up higher
neither refuse or contemn any reward or gratuity how small soever your prince bestows upon you
design not upon what is not in your power
and remember that being to deal with other persons you must drive the nail which way it will go
therefore be as indifferent as is possible
your future gains also not being in your power spend not upon the hopes of them and remember that expectation is alwaies greater then the reality


he is happy that hath an opportunity given him to shew signally his prudence and loyalty
sejanus by one action know not whether generous or fortunate of saving tiberius life with the hazzard of his own obtained that reputation that he governed the whole empire and had almost settled it upon himself through the great confidence tiberius otherwise a very jealous prince had in him
but these cases fall out seldom and by the immediate providence as may say of almighty god

if you chance to do any great action be sure to give the glory of it to the prince as indeed he in some sort deserves it for you follow his commands or instructions
besides the means and opportunity of all such are his only and it was performed under his authority
seem not to be willing to draw all businesses to your self nor keep too great grandeur in house followers for that gives ombrage to the prince as great titles are offensive to the
extraordinary service if many ingaged in it is counted a piece of duty and seldom rewarded
either because the prince pretending that he cannot gratify all to avoid murmuring and emulation will reward none
or because those about him if many others be to be considered are likely to find the less share for themselves

it was a saying of antigonus first get power then good will
power is ability of parts wealth friends emploiment then good will and reputation by courtesy civility and other acts of prudent conversation as also by drawing

others by your interest
for you may then engage many unto you and spread your roots and fibres a great way especially if by the reputation of justice and bounty you have procured you a veneration amongst virtuous persons
for by this they are assured that they may securely lean upon you and run your hazzards

and it is more desirable to be loved then honored this indeed is more splendid but that is more safe this is greater that better this is in the imagination that in the heart of others from that proceeds peace with others tranquillity in his condition and a complacency in his own mind
yet is love harder to obtain requires a greater time the acquiring of it is subject to many difficulties which honor is not and therefore make much of honor which also carrieth a tincture of affection with it
only remember what a great general said
desire to honor my life not by other mens opinions but my own actions

because more men are drawn then heaved up
and that amongst ingenious persons there is alwaies emulation and amongst rivals and for all preferments such there are envyings also which are great rubs and difficultly surmounted or removed endeavor to make a friend who may give an antidote against their poyson and by lending his hand raise you in spight of all the weight and pressures they can hang upon you

friends are not easily made and still more difficulty amongst great persons both because they have fewer equals and amongst such equals

emulation is frequenter then friendship yet are they not so rare but they may be procur'd
for long especially youthful acquaintance kindred and relation sympathy in affections partaking in a common danger or such like do reconcile friendship but not frequently nor are these means in every mans power they are obligations by which providence only tyes men together
but there are others also which are more ordinary for you insinuate your self into the affection even of a great person if you can shew him that you are able to strengthen assist and confirm him in his estate and be able by your parts or other way to recompense the favors you expect from him
but mony discreetly applied is a plaister that unites and soders all affections nor is there any heart as well as not any castle that can resist its battery if rightly placed

to desire wealth for its own sake is low sordid and proper only for them who make the obtaining it their profession but to desire it moderately in order to do more good is unblamable
even reputation it self is acquired and sustained by discreetly keeping and spending so that it also is in a manner subservient to wealth

we seldom see that wealth increaseth in a family for three generations together perhaps because that he who comes into a plentiful fortune having no occasion to employ his parts and industry grows lazy and negligent or at best betakes himself to some other affairs or perhaps because men not knowing the difficulty in obtaining it value it not much but rather look after the splendor of the world whereunto rich men

commonly engage and enter their children and for that reason live at the height of the reputation of their estate

the prudence to obtain wealth is generally conceived to be cutting off superfluous or unnecessary expences but that is not all for there is also required good menagery or making your penny go further then another mans
but in this caution must be used for many have bin ruined by buying good pennyworths
in making friends by mony prudence also is required lest you lose that also
for it is best used upon an exigent occasionally rather then frequently and actually rather then constantly like a wedg not like a saw
many can hurt who cannot profit
and the ill tongue of an inferior many times harms more then that of an equal for it is easilier beleived because less suspected
therefore endeavor to keep a fair reputation with all persons with superiors humble and compliant not low and flattering with equals grave not morose with inferiors courteous and fairspoken not sullen or imperious
considering that no man is willing to own him that is out of fashion as may say out of the good opinion of the world

it was more dangerous to offend sejanus then tiberius
for all men raised from low condition are more jealous of affronts and contemts which a natural and generous superior is not who interprets nothing to be contemt but what is meerly so or done on purpose to affront and nothing to be so but what cannot well be construed otherwise
to such therefore as sejanus you must carry your self so as not to

be hated by him for you will find it hard to please both the patron and him
besides you know not how long he will last and it goes hard with a man of understanding and spirit that his good must depend upon two and his ill upon one

if you cannot be reconciled to a favorite be sure to tell your patron that he is your enemy so his ill offices cannot hurt you
it is unpardonable folly to quarrel with them who are much your superiors for the thred breaks where it is weakest
if you be so ill satisfied of any person that you think not fit to pardon or bear with him any longer yet let him not know so much for the time may come when you shall have need of him
and if you resolve to chastise him discover it not lest you be prevented
but this is not to be used but in extremity and towards persons incorrigible
for according to the rules of our most holy faith tis infinitely better not to revenge at all but to pass by offences then which no man can shew greater wisedome
and this is not very difficult if you stifle quarrels in the beginning
but there are some so wicked dispositions that nothing works upon them but fear and he that lets them go unpunished encourageth them in their evil courses

whether you expect emploiment and preferment or chuse a private life if you have any thing to lose endeavovr to be in reputation with your prince and superior and trust not to your innocency or wary living
for besides that he cannot want an occasion some time or other to punish you you know not

what may happen wherein you shall stand in need of him

much less presume that your manners are undiscovered or to commit any fault upon hopes of secrecy for a good judge will so entangle and hamper you that you cannot escape
and if you be once suspected more suspicions will be continually suggested against you
and even to have much suspicion and little proof makes against you for it is a sign that you are more dangerous
no man can stand alwaies upon his guard but sometimes he will faile and mistake happy he whose errors are in small matters that he need not great applications and much endeavor to get himself off the shallow
nor can a man on a suddain foresee the depth of a question or the consequences of an action
therefore when you doubt or see not clearly be wary and take time
many times small mistakes produce great evil effects and great mistakes sometimes none at all wherefore contemn no danger how little soever it seem to threaten
be vigilant cavendi nulla est dimittenda occasio
it is much better to do so then be beholding to your friend to fetch you off for that is accounted equal to if not greater then a considerable benefit
give not much heed to those who would perswade you to quit your emploiment or pretend themselves to be weary of business have they not a mind to succede you or are they not like the fox that having lost his own tail would perswade all the rest to cut off theirs


tis not an unusual way to obtain preferment to shew a so considerable as to fright his prince into compliance
in reason this should be an ill means but experience shewes that under lasch superiors or such as are it many times thrives well enough
upon the same grounds proceed also those who endeavor to make themselves necessary to their prince and so rivet themselves into his business that they cannot be drawn out without tearing the piece

but of such the prince is alwaies jealous and will at some time or other emancipate himself
he therefore that takes this course walkes upon a precipice and the further he goes the greater is his ruine likely to be
the count of paul took his measures upon these grounds in lewis time
but he had to do with a prince of extraordinary parts

the people upon whose recommendation many persons think to raise themselves guide not themselves by reason but chance therefore he is not wise that strives to make himself their favorite or forceth himself to gain their affection
for they will never do the like for him again nor forgo the least of their profit for his greatest benefit
on the contrary the nature of the people and of all mean persons is alwaies to value themselves as if all men were obliged to augment and better their degree tis best therefore to deny them at first when their desires are modest
for if you once grant you must never after refuse lest your former courtesy be lost and to think to satisfy them is to give drink to an hydropic
yet if occasion offer it self to be favoured

by them or if your virtue and good actions have procured their favor neglect it not
for a general plausibility may stand you in great stead besides that it may be very advantagious by your good menagement to your prince

popularity is one of the lowest and meanest sorts of ambition a refuge commonly of those who envy such as have prevented them in the lawful acquiring advancement by the favor of their superiors
and the thoughts of the people being meaner and lower then theirs they are forced to do and say many things contrary to their own judgments and inclinations
besides the people being necessitous measure all things by advantage so that their favor is chargeable and seldom any other then breath and air except religion be in the case
if you arrive to any power be very wary how you tamper to change governments which is usually the refuge of necessitous persons
for not being able to perform it your self you must of necessity trust your cause and person to many foolish and open persons
yet nothing more frequently ruins such designs then too much caution for security
for that requires longer time and employs more persons about the principal business and is subject to many more accidents
in court have many acquaintances but make a friend for advice and consultation out of court and one that is not likely to have any interest in your patron


the service of a prince is procuring that his will and intentions be fulfilled for no

man esteems that be it never so good that is not according to his own desires
such therefore as his desires are such must they be whom he employs for they are looked upon as only the instruments for his compassing and bringing about his purposes

wherefore they who seem most zealous to perform the princes will in all things without deliberation or interposing their own judgement concerning the lawfulness or unlawfulness of them seem to be in the plainest road to preferment
yet divers of the wisest princes have made even that the criterion to exclude men from their favour and retain such as upon tryal were found constantly virtuous
princes usually more esteem one that is then one that is that is more one that loves his person then his state and condition then his nation then the public tho this is indeed the more honorable and the other more easily counterfeited
but in reality princes have very few if any friends to their persons for they have no equals nor familiars· for indeed few wise men will expose themselves to so much hazzard nor set themselves as pales against the wind but for their own advantage
besides they know that if any difficulty happen it is reasonable they should be deserted
wherefore they ought to make much of those who are truly for there are too few of them who are sincerely even so affected

it is an action of very great prudence to carry even between adulation and sowreness
neither to be as the cook that aimes onely at pleasure

nor as the physician who intends only health but to mingle and ajust them together
whilst we retain justice and friendship not to scandalize prudence and interest is a difficult matter
yet not impossible for lepidus kept to the end his authority with tiberius a very jealous prince as tacitus observes

flattery and obsequiousnes is a more quick and ready way to advancement then either durable or laudable
for when discovered to be such it is contemtible and afterwards odious
it is but lead that bends and plies every way nor is he a man either of virtue or courage that can condescend to make himself universal minister to any one
consequently he is neither faithful in his emploiment when he eyes a greater reward nor constant to him when he spies danger

of flatterers there are two sorts
bouffons whose cheif insinuation is to eat and be clothed
who like the ape finding himself neither fit to carry burdens as the asse nor to keep the house as the dog betakes himself to make sport
these are easily discovered and their worst is not very dangerous

the other sort are more subtil gentile and mischievous whose designs are to intrigue themselves into business to make fortunes and get estates or perhaps honors by universal compliance
these by observing the actions and discourses of their pretended patron discover his inclination as hunters do the haunts of wild beasts that they may easilier intrap them
it is their interest he should be vitious careless irregular and extravagant for by that means they can more easily withdraw him from all

virtuous persons and ingross him to themselves who have no other way to ingratiate themselves but their ready compliance with all his desires
this they endeavor should pass for affection to his person and they represent all other advisers either as contemners of him or at best as morose and of evil humor

therefore they pretend to idolize him to observe his counsels and commands as oracles not to converse with those he suspects to inveigh against his enemies to make him the head of their own counsels and themselves to be even in their particular affairs ruled by him to take great content in serving him to praise him immoderately before those who will be sure to inform him of it to exaggerate every small favor received from him and to dissemble the injuries

they also are careful to all his vices
covetousnes they call providence jealousy circumspection prodigality is generousness
then they compare him with others either of a contrary vice if the man be hated or of the same if in any reputation
they feign also in themselves the same inclinations sympathy sentiments with their patron
and often undervalue themselves in respect of him
they are also apt to praise him for what he hath not done or extravagantly for what he hath done glosing and varnishing all miscarriages and few there are who are not taken even with this one bait
for who is he that values not himself above his deserts and thinks not all is his due which is given in reality the refusing or accepting of praise rationally and discreetly is as great a trial of a

wise man as the cupel is of silver

no master esteems a servant of whom he hath no need and that either for his abilities of which few masters can judg or because he knows his secrets this then being the easilier and securer is that way which flatterers and all those who endeavor to make themselves great by unlawful means chuse to walk in
and of all secrets they most desire to be privy to his vices for by that means he becomes obnoxious to them
in doing ill offices these flatterers observe to do them seldom

to tolerate if not confirm the praises of him they design upon lest they be suspected to have done it out of malice

to pretend no small or inconsiderable occasion nor their own concerns but a public one only and in defence of their superiors

to dispose their words so as they may seem casual and unpremeditated
artis est celare artem they endeavor therefore by all means to be accounted sincere and upright persons for they see that the fame of being crafty and subtil which is the great skill they really pretend to much retards and impedes their businesses
in general conversation therefore none more open and free none seeming by their discourse more noble and generous
but their confidence is in simulation and duplicity which because of other mens evil dealing they pretend is necessary

they often pretend and endeavor to be in esteem with the clergy especially those who make shew of greatest severity and holines
and of so great force is the shew of religion that even an hypocrite is feared and reverenced

hereby also they have considerable advantages that they can decry all vices even those themselves are guilty of and can safely asperse those whom they hate or fear and unhappy are they that fall into their hands


princes when they have denied a favor to one that importunately sues for it are apt to suspect that such a one hates them for the denial and therefore afterward look not well upon that person
wherefore be not too earnest in your requests
and if your misfortune be to be denied be sure not to shew such resentment as he may suspect you intend him any harm
rather seem to be content with any slender shew of reason he gives you so you may obtain if not this yet some other favor
but if you perceive his mind to be alienated from you retire betimes for a man falling is by every one thrust downwards
besides all the miscarriages and errors will be surely laid upon your shouldiers notwithstanding all your innocency
do violence to your self rather then not conceal or dissemble the injuries done you by your prince or patron
for should you declare your self unsatisfied so far would he be from compassionating or making amends to you that upon the least occasion he will hate you

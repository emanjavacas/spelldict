TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, SIR CHRISTOPHER HATTON, Knight, one of the Queenes Maiesties most Honourable priuy Counsell, and Captayne of her Graces Garde.
OENOPIDES Chius (most honourable Syr) dedicated at the Tryumphes holde in Greece to the honor of Iupiter Olympus (or as others write) to Hercules, a Booke of his owne framing and makeing all of Brasse: the Methode and matter whereof was nothing else but a summary Discourse collected oute of Plato as concerning the continuance, circuite, and course of the seuen Planets.
VVhich busines so carefully, and costly perfourmed by the aforesayd Chius, is here peradue~ture in another sort with other necessary sequell thereof, with lesse a doe also and lesse cost scanned
VVhich small treatise of myne, neyther crauing Iupiter, nor Hercules, but requireth rather youre honors present Patrocynie, and fauorable protection: Your Honour being now in these dayes to our most renowmed Prince, the VVeale Publike eue~ the same that PHOCION a moste renowmed Captayne was to the Athenians: And as EPAMINONDAS was to the Thebanes.
Three rare royall vertues there are which AGESILAVS (speaking it vpon good tryall and proofe thereof) requireth to bee in a Captayne set ouer the Prynces Garde: the first hee sayth, is fidelity to his Soueraygne, whose per+son hee is moste carefully to safegarde and defend: the second (he sayth) is an hawty heart and valiancy of Mynde, affected towards his friendes, and litle esteming the force of his foes: and the last he reposeth in ripenesse of Iudgement dexterity of VVisdome
All which three Ormame~ts Iewels, and the same three (I dare vtter it) thrise doubled and trebled, shyne and shewe forth in your Honor very resple~ dishingly.
Insomuch that if were (as am nothing fit thereto) to determyn as the Orator DEMADES did, of Noble Personages and moste worthy VVyghtes euen eyes of the Realme, as hee calleth them: the consideration of your honors so Infinite and inestimable vertues, euen of very right deseruing the same, required (I shoulde say very worthely) your Honors accoumpt (as it also hath already) among ye chiefest Senators and Sages of this Land.
And whereas many other Nations being gouerned onely as it were Cyclopycally, (that is to say) wyth myght bodely force, therewith onely defeng the~selues, being wythout theyr wyse Councell, as it were without their Eyes (as the Poets say the great Gyaunte CYCLOPS
is) doe yet neuerthelesse for want of the same runne oftentimes to much ruyne, subiection, and subuersion.
This our Countrey and Nation (the Lord bee hyghly thanked therefore) hauing such theyr Eyes and eysight, as it hath in deede very cleare, perfite, and pretious, whereby aswell all the whole body of the Realme: as also euery parte thereof is most happely dyrected in all kinde of safety: howe greatly wee and the same is to glorifie GOD therefore, though should say nothing thereof but be silent therein, the very force of such a ryche blessinge and Benefite, it selfe would burst forth and speake it.
Now the cause that only mooued me at this time, to craue your Honores Countenauncinge of this Litle Treatise, was chiefly, the hearesay of your Honoures accustomed Clemency, and Curtesy in like behalfe towardes others.
VVhich being any thinge accepted at your Honors hands, shall encourage me hereafter
In the meane tyme shall not cease to pray to the gouernor of all, the Lord of Lordes, for the prosperous long preseruation of your Honour, and for the continuance of your honors estate good lyking, to the glory of GOD, the contentation of the Prynce, and commodity of the Countrey.
TYRESIAS King the Thebanes being in that foolishe minde, so perswaded with him selfe that the Stars had no such Pryuiledge or rule in Mans body, or else, as the Astrologians did playnely affirme, was (as the Poets Imagine) with the aduise and consent of the all (not suffering such speech) striken starke blind and quite bereued of his sense of seing.
And in deede those ignorant men or vnaduised sort which are in a manner come to the same passe that COTTA the Epicure with CICERO, DEMOCRITVS were at, that all things here belowe come to passe by chaunce, meere Casually, or at a venture, accordingly as they hap well or ill, they are eyther blinde in knowledge, or else are wedded to much to their owne Wits and Willes, dealing with the caelestiall povvers preposterously.
kinde of Influence from them all, vvhich disposeth all bodies here beneath according to euery ones especiall and naturall propriety.
In so much that BALBVS the Stoycke is rather to be borne withall, then these kynde of Men, which vppon three Principall causes, and considerations was enforced and driuen to graunte some superior kindes of fatall prouide~ce.
And the firste reason and cause therevnto moouinge him vvas the viewe of such sundrye Varietyes, and such plentifull stoare of Commodities, as which doe daily arise both in the Earth as in the Sea and Ayre, through the contemperature, and variable disposition of the heauenly powers.
The second occasio~ that brought him hereto was, the perceyuinge of the wonderful differences and contrary propertyes both of minde as of body in all thinges almost, that hee coulde not chose but thinke and Imagine a sundrye cause for euery one.
Thirdly the distinct order and placinge of eche thinge to the better co~tinuation of the same in his kinde, prouoked and enforced him for to rest and grounde vpon some Superior workemansters or Authors aboue.
of the Planets, property, and Influence doth in this respect offer it selfe to be seene apparantly, euen in the frame Workemanship of Man kinde, vvhereas euery person almost hath his seuerall and sundry Inclination: some to vertue, some agayn to vice: some also hauing good hap, and other some hauing sinister fortune.
And whereas vvicked men for the moste porte ruffle in the vvorld, fortune alwais laughing on the~: as MARIVS, SYLLA, DYONISIVS the cruell Tyraunt, PYSISTRATVS, POLYCRATES, PHALARIS, And co~trariwyse it is here vvith goodme~ for the most parte, as it vvas vvith PAVLVS AEMILIVS a valyaunte Vanquisher, and a good man, yet through cruell fate murdered slayne vvith his vvhole army at a skyrmishe fought at Canna.
It vvas also Aphricanus his hap to be banished his countrey and to dye in exile.
It vvas CATVLVS his chaunce to bee slayne of his mortall enemy MARIVS.
Yea and vvee see dayly the suddayne rysing of many men from their lowe Estate to the highest degrees
of dignity: as IPHICRATES a Coblers sonne, aduaunced to bee a Captayne vnder ARTAXERZES king of Persia.
RVMENES CARDIANVS borne in Peloponesus a Carters son, aftervvards made Co~usay lor to ALEXANDER the greate.
IVLIVS LICINIVS a Husband mans son aftervvards Gouernor of Dacia.
Yea, and many contraryvvise being Royally and nobly borne by fatall destiny haue fell from aloft: as ALCIBIADES, POMPEYE, yea PTOLOMEVS the Aegyptian king vvhich in hys ruffe and youthfull dayes, banquetted feasted dayly a Thowsand Guestes ordinarely, seruinge them all in their Golden Plate, and yet hee himselfe aftervvardes as he grevve olde vvas dryuen to that extremity, that he vvas faine to be sustayned relieued at other mens handes very barely and coursly.
Yea, and besides this many haue such cruell destinye that as soone as they bee borne they are subiect to be swallowed and soopt vp straightwais of some one dau~ger or other:
as was SEMIRAMIS borne of a noble bloude: and PYRRHVS, afterwards King of the Epirotet.
Which both were throwen out cast fro~ their frends being Sucklings and Infants, and yet by fate of Fortune and by great prouidence preserued euen at the very dent brym of present and Imminent destruction.
By such meanes also was CYRVS so hurled of from his friends, sustayned nourished by the meanes of a Bitche: so was TELEPHVS by a Harte: PELIAS Son to NEPTVNVS by a Mare: PARIS by a she Beare: AEGYSTVS by a she Goate: ROMVLVS, and REMVS by a she Woulfe.
In the wonderfull deliuery dealing vvhereof vvhat kinde of Fate and Prouidence this and an Infinite number such lyke was, referre the same (gentle reader) to thine owne determination.
Whereof this Treatise (if thou vouchsafest the thorough Readinge thereof) doth shewe forth both in proofe in example more aboundantly.
The name also vvhich haue gieuen to this booke callinge it the Dyall of Destiny, doth well enough as thinke agree to the purpose.

Which labos of mine such as it is, receyue thou thankfully: And the~ haue that Recompence that doe require.
POLLIO playe not the POLYPRAGMON or Busie body: wys it becommeth you not.
The Parrat and Popiniaye playe such partes for Pray sake, rather then of property: but the Cornish Choughs and Carrenly Crovves haue it of custome.
If youre wonte bee such it is worse then wyshe it were.
Dayneties surely desire or looke you for none till that your maners be mended.
OF THE CONcord or common felowship of the seuen Planets, as also of their breadefull debate and discorde.
IT is manyfest and approued by argumentes of force, and reasons of more secret and hid phylosophy, likewise by demonstration and conclusions Mathematicall, yt all Creatures whatsoeuer whych haue their being essence, and preseruation vpon the face of the whole Earth, or els be contayned within the Regions or Precinct of the Ayre aboue, and subiected vnder ye circle or Sphere of ye Moone, haue receiue their influence of the higher and more Celestiall hodies or Planets: and after a certayne sorte (sayth Proclus they resi depend of them.
And heerem his saying seemed not to bee amisse, for that experience playnly teacheth vs, and we also see yt there is nothinge heere belowe so able, stronge, or riche of it selfe, that being voyde or destitute
of the fauour or furtheraunce of the celestiall bodies aboue, can be well pleased and contented with it selfe.
Agrippa is in that opinion that at the former constitution or first breedinge of euery ech thinge, both that which lyueth, as also that which is deuoyde of lyfe (as likewise at the committure or composition of the Clements for ye morease of any baser kindes) the bountifulnes of certayne planets is such oftentimes, that besides the beneficialnesse of the owne nature of the thinges themselues (which worketh alwayes liberally) there is a further free gyft bestowed vpon euery ye sayd thinges, and kindes by the Planets themselues: and the same more rightly or preciously whe~ as they meete together in more happy signe, or be in higher Horoscope or Ascendent.
Plato wyth his Consectaryes doe affyrme, that all these Daughters or progeny of Dame Nature, are euery one of them first sealed (as it were) marked of the starres and Planets aboue, whereby in euery thing they haue to chalenge their owne.
And euen as by God the greatest mightiest of all, and the first and principall cause of all things, all creatures are disposed
generally to a like frame and customable order of the selfe same kinde: so in lyke sorte by the seconde causes the Planets although inferiours yet working causes, all things here vnderueath are in more speciall sorte sealed and ensampled.
Easy it is to see that there is no one parte in all the whole proportion workmanship of mans body, that is not ruled or disposed by some one Planet or other, to affectate that most of all other thinges which ye superior force doth frame them and enclyne them vnto: so that vnto me all the whole body of man, as also the bodies of all other creatures here below, seeme to be possessed, busied, and as it were incensed and set on worke by them.
To begin with Sol or the Sunne, it is apparant how he holdeth, gouerneth, and hath in possession ye Braynes and forepart of the head, the heart, the marrow, the right Eye, the vitall Spirite or breath of life: likewise ye Mouth, ye tongue, and all other the Organes or instruments of sense, or feeling: besides this, he chalengeth the hands, the feete, the Synewes, the Imagination, and whole operation of the powre phantasticall.
hath in her subiectio~ ordreth after a certayne sorte all the whole body, in such wise as both the humors and moysture both naturall, and accidental: doth either abounde in them or dyminishe and lessen, according to her prime and wane.
And whereas shee thus worketh generally in all sortes according to her owne variation, so in the speciall members and partes of the body, shee especially ruleth in the Lunges, and dealeth also with a great portion of ye Brayne.
Hers is also the Marrow of ye Backbone, as also the stomacke, the lest Eye, with all the other partes that yeelde forth auoyde the excrementes, and superfluities of ye body, with the powre and vertue increasinge.
Saturne is lord ouer the Lyuer, and hath to doe with the bottome or lowest parte of the stomacke.
Iupiter chalengeth a righte in the Belly, as likewise in the Nauell: in so much that in ye Temple of Iupiter Ham+mon in Lybia, the figure or lykenesse of a Mans Nauell was hanged vp, to fignifie thereby that the thorough closing and fastning together of the Belly belongeth onely to Iupiter himselfe.
the Ribbes, and the place aboute the priuities, as also the Bowels, Entrailes within.
Moreouer the best and more principall bloude is his, as also both ye armes, and both the handes, as well the righte as the left, with all the whole powre vertue Nutritiue, whereby ye whole body is nourished and maynteyned.
To Mars appertayneth and belongeth the seconde more base Bloude, as also the Vaines, the Ridney, the Celles or placinges of the Chest, the Backe, the Buttockes, the Corse and abundaunce of Seede, as also all that full powre of the Stomacke wherein Choler is ingendred.
Proper to Mercury is the Splene, the Mylte, the Bladder, the Matrix, and all those places within the Body which are naturally appoynted to the onely vse and office of nourishing.
Venus ruleth the Secret partes, and ordereth ye naturall Seede, and also causeth and prounketh to the Lust and Appetite of thinges.
It may be perceyued also that in some one parte of the body, they will all seuen beare a sway.
are seuen Pores or holes, allotted to dyuerse and sundry offices, of the which euery one of them is subiect to a sundry Planet.
As that Pore or hole which is in ye righte Eare apperteineth to Saturne: that in the left to Iupiter: Mars also hath the gouernment of that which is in the right side of ye nose: Venus the contrary: Sol is maister ouer that which holdeth the stringes of the Eye: Luna ouer the other in the left Eye: and all the whole workmanship of ye mouth is proper alone to Mercury.
Great graciouse also are all such Benefites of Mankinde, as also the other baser kyndes doe estsoones receiue of the Planets, especially when as those of like co~dition, nature, quality doe meete together in gracious signes of like house.
And co~trariwise heauy and hearde is their happe, fortune, and chaunce, which haue and obtayne any thing of them as they be in battlement, stryfe, contencion among them selues.
Wherefore shall not greatly do amysse, if in this place briefly touch, which of them with other are in friendly league and likance, in like sorte, which of them with other are at deadly discorde, and disagreement.
Mercury, Sol, and Luna: his enemies are Mars, and Vonus.
Mars is despised and detested of all ye other, except onely of Venus.
Sol is in great friendship with Iupiter and Venus, and in greathatred with Mars, Mercury, and Luna.
Venus hath the loue of all the rest saue onely of Saturne.
In friendship with Mercury, are Iupiter, Venus, Saturne: his enemies are Sol, Luna, Mars.
Friends to Luna, are Iupiter, Venus, and Saturne: her enemies are Mars, and Mercury.
Great contencion also is amongst them as they be placed in contrary house: as betwene Saturne, and Venus.
And a much more great debate or strife is betwene the~ as they bee in Opposite, lofte, or degree in Exaltation.
Which thing is often shewed forth betwene Saturne, and Sol: Iupiter, Mars: Venus, and Mercury.
And further their attonement, or agreement is in lyke Nature, Quality, Substaunce, might, or powre: as is of Mars, and Sol: Venus, and Luna: Iupiter, and Venus.
that it was not without iuste cause and occast in that Heraclitus sayd, that al things were persited and made by a proportio~ fetched from frie~dship and discord.
By these Planets also happeneth better chaunce fortune, as also mischaunce misfortune.
Insomuch that some of them are tearmed the Gods of grace and fortune: as is Iupiter whom they name Fortuna maior, the greater or more gracious.
Likewise Venus, who in the rules of Astrologie is named Fortuna minor, as if you woulde say lesse gracious, and yet a Lady of grace.
The other are called the Gods of mishap or casuall chaunce, of the which sort is Saturne, whom they name Infortuna maior: As also Mars which is called Infortuna minor.
And Mercury, which is called the God of indifferency, who is for al companies, for with the good, he is good, and with the bad, he is as bad.
Sol by his shyning Sunne beames, and amiable aspecte or countenaunce, is cheareful to al things: but being in coniunction with other or eclypsed, both hindreth much for the prese~t time, prognosticateth, threatneth more
The moone is sent in message from one to another, and hath hir recourse and passage by them all: so that she hurteth or benefiteth as occasio~ serueth by them, from them.
By Astrologie also they haue all theyr determynate kinde: As Venus and Luna are feminyne or of the woman kinde: And all the other are accompted Masculine, or after men.
They are also deuided into Planets of the day, and Planets of the nighte.
Againe they be so deuyded as that certaine of them be holden for heauy and Massie, of the which sorte are Saturne, Iupiter, and Mars: other are as subtile and light, as are Venus, Mercury, Luna.
But Sol or the sunne is partaker of neither of both these properties.
Amongst the elementes these do also contend for the superiority.
For Iupiter dealeth with that commixture whych partely is of the ayer, and partely of the Water.
Luna or ye Moone exacteth that which consysteth and commeth of the Water alone.
Sol also helpeth forwardes the meanes, or maner in doing or acco~plishing of things.
Luna or the Moone, as it were ministreth matter in such behalfes.
Mars, and Mercury, labour their proceeding going forward, and doe geue them speedy and quick expedition: the firste by the meanes of his force, and might, and the other by his aptnesse and Dexterity in deliueraunce.
The plenty and store of matter commeth from Venus, and the continuation or wayght of any businesse whatsoeuer, is proper alone to Saturne.
Moreouer all the Sygnes in ye Zodiacall Circle doe participate, and inioy the qualities of the seuen Planets.
As Taurus, and Capricornus, bee Saturnine: Virgo, and Libra, are after Iupiter: Aries, and Scorpio, be after Mars: Cancer, Leo, be after Sol or the Sunne: Gemini, and Sagittarius, be after Venus: Aquarius, and Pisces, bee after the Moone.
And accordinge to the course of the Sunne, Aries, Taurus, and Gemini, doe procure a warme and moyst Spring time, very good for the Sanguine Complexion, and for tender age.
Cancer, Leo, and Virgo, likewise cause a hoat Summer a dry: very good
Likewise Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius, cause a colde and moyst Autumne, agreable to the Phlegmaticke co~plexion, and younge age.
And Capricornus, quarius, and Pisces, cause the Winter naturally to be cold and dry, aunswerable to the Melancholicke complexion, and to olde Age.
But of these thinges we are to speake of, as Occasion shall serue more particulerly, as hereafter followeth.
Of LVNA, or the Moone, AS Sol or the Sunne is the Beauty, Grace, and Countenaunce of ye day: so in like sorte is Luna, or the Moone the comforter, light geuer, and glory of the night.
And they both haue for this such their Graciousnes and goodnes, the greatest preheminence and accoumpte of all other Planets.
Whereupon it was not wont good cause, and consideration that in olde and auncient time, both of these when at any tyme they
were Depictures or drawen forth by any Artificer, Engrauer, or Paynter, they were then chiefly set out in ye fashion, seemlinesse or Habite of a Virgin: and in both their handes were placed and put fine and feate Arrowes, or dartes, to signifie thereby that the light which proceeded fro~ these two, was onely cleare, vndefiled, and withoute spot: and that these were the onely Planets which threwe as it were, and cast from them the glistering beames of cleare and comfortable lighte, as Arrowes or Dartes: whereby all things cheared, and continued the better in their Estate, wyth well lyking.
This same Luna therefore is with the Poets called Lucina the Gouernour or Goddesse of the nyghte.
And for that she doth not onely appeare or shyne in the night time, but is seene oftentimes ouer our heade in our Horizon in the day time.
It is growne to a custome, and brought nowe amonge vs to this passe effect, yt shee is also of some called Diana (as if you woulde say Duana for her thorow presence both in ye day night: or as Tully better reasoneth, for that shee with her bright looke oftentimes causeth ye night to appeare as though it were day.
ye other planets is placed lowest, is nighest to ye Earth, for which cause she sheweth forth seemeth vnto our eyesight to bee so great: her figure or fashio~ of body is rou~d, of her own nature she is fiery, although casually intermedling wt vapors, water, so forth, she appeareth to be in colour watery, which much troubleth her: whereupo~ it is reported yt (were it not for such lettes, hinderaunces, as by this meanes it is subiect vnto) she would shyne forth as fully as doth the Sunne, The Hebrewes call it.
She geueth her chiefest light on yt side or part which is opposite against the Sun, is euer darkned on yt side which is turned away fro~ the Sun.
states or co~ditions to be obserued waighed: yt is to say,
either as she is in coniu~ction wt the Sun: or els as she is on some of his sides, or els as shee departeth goeth backe furder of from ye Sun.
point, she will appeare end wise, with her hornes reaching towards ye East.
Seco~dly as she is in oppositio~ wt the sun and draweth nighe to that pointe, shee appeareth all ouer a like rounde with the
Su~ne, but her reuolution then is most towarde the West.
And lastly as on eyther side shee turneth more or lesse towardes the Sunne, so is shee the more obscured or lightned.
Marcianus sayth that there is a certayne Stayne or Spot euer seene in the Moone, which blemisheth her brightnesse greatly: especially the~, when as some matter of Mystes, or of any other Metecre is troublesome vnto her.
Her house is onely in Cancer, Her exaltacion is in the fourth of Taurus, Her qualies are cold moiste.
As likewise her effectes or workinge is to make colde and moyste.
Where she coloureth she geueth a saffron colour: in tastes or sauoures she worketh maketh the saltest.
Her course or race is of all other Planets most swift:
dayes she passeth through all and singuler Signes of the Zodiacke.
And for such her swiftnes or haste it happeneth somewhiles yt shee is vnder ye Sunne, another while aboue: one while she is before, another while behinde.
And when as the Sunne is in his course or circuite by the nethermost circles of ye south, and the Moone contrariwise in the highest circle of ye North, then the top of ye Moone
appeareth like a Cockbote or small ship, and her hornes are vpwarde.
But when as she is vnder the Su~ne, her hornes giue downewarde towardes the earth.
From ye Moone are gathered and coniectured certaine probable signes,
whereby we prognosticate and foreshewe of the alteratio~ of times mutability of the weather to come.
As when the Moone by and by after her chaunge doth appeare red, shee prognosticateth wyndes and tempestuous weather, the most parte of the sayde Moones continuance.
Agayne if vpon her chaunge shee incontinently at her Top or highest parte looketh blacke, or be there darckened shee foresheweth rayne, and a wet moyste first quarter.
But if shee bee onely obscured about ye middle of her, shee prognosticateth a fayre full Moone and last quarter of the same.
The Eclypse of the Moone is generally caused through the interposition of ye earth betwene the Moone our eyesight:
but then especially is she Eclipsed when as the bodies both of the Sunne, Moone, and Earth are right oppositly set one ouer another, in one the selfe same contrary line: so that by such occasion, one darckeneth and
Her chaunge, increase, and decrease, hath much troubled the wits of ye Astronomers.
As hardly also can they render a reason geue forth the cause why one while shee croketh in to hornes, why another while she wexeth all rounde, why one while she shyneth in one parte of her, why another she geueth light al ouer why now she is seene all night, why now but a piece of ye night: why now leauing ye nighte time, shee sheweth her selfe onely in ye day time: why now shee is cleare and radiant, why anon blotted and blemished: why now caried Northwarde, why anon mooninge directly Southward.
Which al and other such like meruaylons and straunge effects and properties (are reported by Plinie in his second booke and eight chapter to haue bene best obserued by Endymion being as is there sayde, rauished in great loue for such her astonishme~t, fel so to affectionate her, that accomptinge more of her then of all the other Supercoelestiall powres, shee to requite him like loue agayne, is sayd to haue discended on a time and to haue kissed the sayd Endymion as he lay a sleepe vpon Latmus, Mountayne in Caria, Plinie
in his fourtenth chapter of the aforesayde boke doth report, yt alwaies at the Moones increase, her hornes are turned from the Sunne: as contrariwise as she decreaseth shee turneth her hornes toward the Sun.
There haue appeared Many Moones at once, but neuer more the~ three at one time.
And three appeared at one tyme manifestly: as in the seco~d booke of the sayd Plinie and xxxii. chapter is recorded: that is to say, in ye tyme of the prehemine~ce or consulship of Cneius Domitius,
and Lucius Annius: which were called of some then, the night Suns.
Likewyse it hath bene seene ye same Author doth affirm it to be true,
that there hath appeared such lightes in ye night, as that it hath bene in a manner all one with the day light.
As for example: In the tyme of Caius Cecilius and Cneius Papirius, they beyng consuls,
such lights were seene in the night, as that the brightnes thereof could not be discerned from the brightnes of the noone day.
And at diuers other tymes in ages and yeares synce, such straunge sights ther haue bene seene, such sightes in the Night, as men haue supposed it to haue bene day.
also Bucklers of fyre sene glisteryng from the West to the Easte,
and of all these the most greuous of others to behold, which bred greatest wonder hapned in the tyme of the Consulship of Lucius Valerius and Cneius Marius.
There hath also ben seene and be often as yet in ye night, fiery flames or burninges in the element or ayre, which haue shewed forth diuers and sundry likenesses: so that some of the~ haue be~ thought to haue resembled and to bee like vnto a Candle or Torch burning:
some like vnto fiery beames: some like vnto pillers set on fire: some are after ye fashio~ of speares: som shewing forth the likenes of swords: some not much vnlike horses manes: some shew+ing forth the likenes of hornes: some as it were fiery darts.
And al these such other like apparitio~s in ye ayre which in Greeke by a general and more common name are called Eupicaumata, do appear for ye most parte in the calme cleare night, although somewhile some of these are seene in ye day time.
And all these aryse euer vnder the globe or circle of the Moone.
The proofe whereof herein is manifeste, for that they continue not in one and the self same place
long, but moue with a swift passage, are caryed away with the viole~ce of ye moones motion.
Wee shall not therefore greatlye go astray if we gieue forth ye cause of these apparitions and sights, and do declare the maner and matter of theyr engendring.
The efficient cause of these fiery impressions bred and ingendred through heat, is the sunne, and the rest of the bodies celestiall: which in theyr motions as they labour in their course, caste from them excessyue heate vpon these bodies, and places below here subiected: Which heat catcheth and carieth vp into the ayre all such exhalatio~s (which of the~selues also be hoat and dry) as are ready for such receipt.
Then the materiall cause is nothing els but such kynd of Exhalation: euen as wodde is the matter of fyre, oyle of the flame.
Now theyr generation is after this sorte: The Earth being throughly warmed through ye sunne and the other starres, doth thereupon cast from her and send forth, a double kind of spiration of breathyng: one kynd very dry accordynge as the places from whych it is sente forthe, bee drye: and this kynd of exhalation being naturally hoate and
drye is much like vnto that fume or smoke which proceedeth from stickes or wood set on fyre and kyndled.
Secondly by such heat raysed from the Sunne and Starres, aforesayde, there is fetched from such places as be moyst, an other more grosse, kind of fume, hot and moyst, which is called a vapour like vnto that maner of euaporation which commeth fro~ the seething water.
These two caught vp into the ayre, and beyng there diuersly placed and set on worke, by the element of the sire (vnto which, the first sort called exhalations do eftsones approach and come neere) do cause straunge sightes in the Regions of the Ayre, for the exhalations beinge both ayry fyery, are sone kyndled and set on fyre, become flames, and fierye impressions: euen as the drie snast of a candel, or as the fare and sticke is soone set on flame.
For the flame of any thing is nothinge els, but the fume of the same already kindled: and it is so soone kindled because it is of a drye and fyery nature.
Now the fashion and forme of the fiery flames seene often tymes burning in the element, do vary and differ one from another, as they haue more aboundance of such matter of exhalation or lesse,
For when such exhalation is dispersed in breadth, and discontinued, there appeare as it were burning lampes: whe~ the same is round, and casteth from it sparcles, then such impression is after a goate, and is so called: when that doth not sparcle, but burneth greate aboue smal below, it is called a fyrebrande.
And that kynd of exhalation which burneth both in breadth and length, and moueth apace in ye ayre, leauing after it som steps of his burning, and as it were marking the way as it goeth, is called a flying starre,
which is wont to appeare on a sodaine: forthwith to vanish out of sighte.
These exhalations as they come nigh to the Elemente of the fyre, or as they bee in the highest region of the ayre, which is next to the fire, bee as it were gunpowder nighe the match, or as brymstone, or towgh put hard to the fyre: which, what expedition is in them, to consume all along, it is euident by experience and common sense.
But these and al other impressions haue theire names of those thinges which they most figurate, and represent.
And as in the cleere night by such matter of exhalation hot and drye, caryed
vp to the highest region of the ayre, kindled, such burning flames do eftsoones appeare: so somewhile through the lyghte onely of the sunne and starres, the element onely appeareth coloured: And these colours there seene are called Phantasmata.
For when the light stayed in any myst ca~not go forth abroade,
or proceede directly, but is fayne to harbour there onely, and to disperse it selfe into the sides, and nexte partes thereof: then doth there shew forth colours of all sortes: somewhiles white, somewhiles blacke: but most often a saffro~ colour, and next to that a sanguine or bloudy colour.
For these colours for this cause causeth such diuersity, as white nighe and next vnto blacke or intermedled therwith: or as the flame seemeth oftentimes moste straunge through the straungenes of the fumes thereof.
So the cause of gaspynges gapynges and gulphes sene oftentimes in the ayre riseth vpo~ the same occasion, partly that the fiery impressions or flames of fyre afore rehearsed do, and partly vpon ye occasion of the colours seene in the ayre, last spoken of.
There is seene oftentymes also in the starlight nights vnder ye moone
(as somewhiles also vnder the sunne and starres) as it were a garland called of the Greekes Halon, in Latine Corona,
whych is engendred through a refraction of the sight in watery Cloudes, as diuerse other apparitions are.
But then specially doth this garland shew about the Moone,
whe~ some vniforme cloude which is on all sides alike thicke or thin, is placed directly vnder the moone: so that her beames coueting to perse and go through ye same, are there stil kept and retayned, or els are beaten backe by the force of the cloude: and so shee being letted therein to go any further directly, disperseth her beames alonge by the outmost sides of the clowde: by which refractio~ there appeareth either right vnder her or vnder som star, a great circle, greately illumined or lightned in a maner of a white garla~d This sighte also is somtimes vnder the sun, the other planets: but most ofte~ vnder the Moone.
For the sun through his extream ferue~t heat doth disperse sunder ye matter of such a cloud, doth not suffer it long to abide vnder him: but ye moone hath not such force of dispersing, therfore this appartio~ stay+eth the more easely vnder her.
So like wise wee shal see this halon or garlande about same starres·
but that is, when betweene those starres vs, ther is oppositely set some harren weake clowde, which is vnfytt to the generation of wynd or rayne.
For if the clowdes were thicke and warry, it were not possible for vs (as daylye experience approueth it) almost to haue sighte of, or to beholde the starres themselues.
Now as the poets also make me~tion, ther is besydes all these straunge sightes in the element which do appeare most in the night tyme, a peece or parte of the Skye, keeping away all a longe in colour mylke whyte, of the Gretians called Galaxia, and latined via lactea.
Which part of the Skye (as they say) was once burnt by the vndiscrete dealinge of Phaeton:
who desiring to take vpon him an enter prise which was very vnfit for him, and wherof he had no skill, that is, to rule hie father Phoebus charyots and horses, by not keeping ye due order and way in dryuing of them, asce~ded and went vp so hie, nigh to the pallaice of Iupiter, yt hee had like to haue set ye same on fyre with the Sun: but as it happened
(say they) that matter beyng espyed preuented in tyme, the most misfortune yt then befel, was that this Phaeton burnt a peece of the Skye, which appeareth vnto vs, to he as it were a whole streete.
But what this ymaginatio~ of the poet herein purporteth, that passe and pretermit: onely the truth of this whyte coloured, milkye, and streetlyke sight of the ayre, is through this occasion.
There is vndonbtedly a certayne part or portio~ of heaue~, in which the light of many starres ioyntly lodged, and receiued by a refraction from them all do cause this whyte coloured appearaunce.
Aristotle sayth, that it proceedeth, or rather sheweth forth by the meanes of some of light, happening vpon an exhalation, yt is hot, and drye, thinne withall.
The cause why these nightly sights, as also why the starres themselues are not seene of vs to skyne in the day tyme, is for that ye Sun letteth the same, by whose great light, the lesser light of the starres and other ayriall sightes are obscured and darkened, eue~ as the quicke cole be it neuer so litle, yet in ye night tyme is seene of vs in his full shyne, but beyng greace, and shyping out withall
thorowly quicke, aliue yet in ye broade day light beyng put in an open place, doth rather seme dead the~ aliue, doth neither geue light norshine vnto vs, al is because it lyeth as it were yeeldeth it selfe to the Sunsmore noble light, and most gloryous shyne: eue~ so doth the starres and al other impressions in the ayer, abse~t kepe them selues from our sight, all the tyme that ye sun is here co~uersant among vs in her such superexcelle~t glory.
But let vs returne to the effect of ye Mone in the other creatures here below: and first let vs begin to co~sider a little vnto what disposition shee frameth those me~ which be subiected borne vnder her constellatio~.
Touching the inclination of all such parties which bee borne vnder Luna, or ye Moone, they be naturally mutable mouable, without fidelity and constancy, geuen to prouoke much anger and discord betwene friends: they be also very enuyous, agreeued with the prosperity and good fortune of others: they bee also ful of hatred, and in their conuersation and manner of lyfe they be verye childish.
The colbure of these commonlye is a pale or whyte colour, althoughe now and then
they haue therwtal a little red intermedled Their face is rou~d, their stature indiffere~t their eies black, their browes wrinkled.
And as in ma~ ye chiefest creature, ye Moone hath this scope or sway: so likewyse it hath as greate force in the bodyes of bruite Beastes, and in them woorketh at her owne wil such straunge effectes as bee no lesse to be meruayled at.
The profe wherof the Panther geueth forth, whose body is altogeather ordered by the Moones dyrection:
for (as Agrippa sayth) he caryeth, or weareth the very badge or patterne of the moone vppon his shoulder: which continueth and vanisheth euerye moone accordingly as the Moone her selfe doth eyther encrease or decrease.
(whom some make one of the kyndes of Apes) other some English ye the Babyon.
Of this Horus APOLLO wryteth, that hee pisseth twelue tymes in the Day, and twelue tymes urthe night.
And that in the wane of the Moone (durynge all the tyme that shee is darkened) hee coutinually lamenteth neuer eatynge
any thing at all: Whereby he playnly pronounceth what parte and rule the Moone hath in him, ouer his whole hodye: vnder ye gouerneme~t of the Moone is also the cha~geable Cameleon, which turneth her selfe into what colour shee lysteth:
Vnder her are also the Badger, the Otter, and whatsoeuer kindes which liue and doe engender monstruously.
The Catte also whose eyes do wexe either greater or lesse at the continuance and chaunge of the Moone, doth manifestly declare what right the Moone hath in the same.
Likewise waspes which arise of the deade carcases of horses: and Bees which do breede of the deade bodies of beastes or Kyne:
Betels which come of the flesh of Asses, do al in their being and continuance depend vpon the Moone: And especially that kinde of Betse which hath as it were two Hornes, and which is also made and proportioned in the eucke like a bull: whose propertie is such that at the be ginng of euery new moone in the sommer and sprynge time chiefly, shee seeketh after and getteth certayne shels wherin she bestoweth some of her seede, which done, she hydeth and burieth the same in ye earth
dayes (in which time the Moone goeth throughe the whole zodiacke, finisheth her ful course) and the
day which is the pryme of the Moone againe, shee retourneth to ye place where those shels were buried, and taketh them forth: and carieth them to the water, where they afterwardes take and receyue life, come to the perfection of their kind.
The Harte also and the Swine, the Dog and the Goate, bee all seruiable vnto the Moone.
Amongest fowles subiected to the Moone, are the Crane, ye Gose, the Duck,
the Cormorant, whose property is to diue vnder the water to take fish, and by ofte~ diuing perceiuing Signes of Tempestes to come, she sodainly wt a gret noise cry get+teth her away fro~ ye water, seketh where to hide her.
Belonging also to the Moone amongst fishes are, ye Creuis or Crabsish: The fysh Torpedo or the Torpede which maketh the takers hands num or dead for a time: Likewise Oysters,
and all shaled fysh: Moreouer the fishe Echeneis whych hath prickels in stead of sins and feete, and neither swimmeth nor goeth, but rubleth.
And fyrst of Trees, in her holde is the Palme tree, which at euery chau~ge shooteth forth a new slippe: lykewyse rosemarye, the Oliue tree, and such lyke.
There is also a certayne Plant, or Herbe called of the Greekes Selenotropion,
that turneth rounde with the Moone, as Heliotropion, lykewyse turneth rounde with ye Sunne.
Chinostares an Herbe also, doth not onelye varye in her tast, goodnes, and virtue, according to the dispositione of the Moone, but getteth loseth more or lesse, of her substance and number of leaues, as the moone getteth, or looseth of her lighte.
Proper to her also amongest Pretious stones or gemmes, is the Christal, the sylner Marcasite, and all those whose colour is white or greene.
which for like qualities with the Mooue, hath with her almost one, and the selfe same name: whose colour is much like hony, and which lesseneth and waxeth byg, accordinge to the pryme, and wane of the Moone.
Hers is also the Magaryte, and all other perles, which engender by a certayne
In this state also is the Berill: and amongest metalles, onely Syluer: and amongest tastes and sauours that which is saltest or most fulsome: amo~gest the superfluities, or excrements of the body, sweate, fleume,
Amongest the Elementes the water with all fountaynes, floods and such like. prouinces also and kyngdomes vnder her dominion and rule are Bythinia, Phrigia, Colchos, Numidia, Aphrick, and all Carthage.
OF MERCVRY. the second Planet NExt aboue Luna or the Moone is Mercury, which alwaies goeth with the sun, and is neuer away from the sun more then
This planet is accompted the father, workeman, or procurer of eloquence and good wit: causeth the senses of those bodies which are subiected to him to bee dextere and pregnaunt.
as hee gouerneth alone: are lightly for the most part rethoricall, well spoken, and very wise,
But as he is ioyned with Saturne or Mars, hee procureth an abuse of the same good and commendable giftes, and conuerteth them to bestow both their eloquence and wits to the hurt and harme of others: as also to stirre vp stryfes, discorde, quareling, tumultes, scisnies, heresies, and such like.
Of such peruerse natured men, ye world (alas) in these dayes is to full of, almost euery where abounding: which as they are endued with right excellent giftes both of eloquence, wisedome, do nothing els therewith (but as the Poet saith well) make thinges that be straight crooked: such as be perfite, and whole, crackte, and broke~: darkening that which is manifest, and thrusting truth out of place: wexe becom shameles scholema+sters of errors.
Contrariwise if this Mercury be ioined wt Iupiter he causeth in the Mercurists a clean co~trary effect.
As who+ly to apply refer the aforesated precious gifts to the inquisition and finding forth of truth, to the defence of the same: as also
to contend in nothing so much as in the aduancement of Religion and vertue.
The Poets faygne that this Mercury nowe a Planet in heauen, was sometimes Neauy to Atlas, who (as they say) vnderproppeth heauen: and somtimes he is named of the~ Hermes, that is an Interpretour, which both geueth plenty of words, as also liberty of speach: whereby we vtter the Imagination and conceipt of our mindes.
Againe he is called Trismegistus for that hee first found out the knowledge or vse of the liverall Sciences.
Marchaunts vse to haue this Planet in high price, of whom many haue supposed them selues to haue obtayned a thorough knowledge and great dexterity in accoumpting and numbring: vpon him therefore they were wonte to call in their affayres and businesse of Marchaundize.
And as Mercury when hee was depaynted or drawen forth in any kynde of sorte, hee was chiefly paynted oute wyth Wynges, and with a Cocke set hard by him, signifying thereby both his celerity and swyftnes in all his busines, as also his Uigilancy and watchfulnesse: So many painefull Marchants in their daungerous
Ptolomy sayth that his house or manston is in Gemini, Virgo: and his exaltation or ascendent is in ye
The qualities which he disposeth vnto are dyuerse, accordinge to the firste and principall qualities of the other Planets, with whom he is in coniunction.
The colors which he worketh are browne, and a darke or dusky colour.
Those that be borne vnder Mercury are Lusty, and lyking, and valiant of body: but of slippery and chaungeable mindes.
The colour of their Face is after a browne, betwene white and blacke: their Face is also somewhat long: they are also of a highe and broade foreheade: their eyes comely, and rowling: their Nose flat: their Beard, thinne, and their Fyngers long.
This Mercury (for seeming to striue wt Venus his next neyghbour in place, aboue him, to co~municate in certaine qualities of righte belonging vnto her) is imagined of the Poets to haue forced and rauyshed her.
The Hebrewes calleth him MACID: The Greekes [undefined span alphabet].
Subiected to Mer+cury are all those kindes of Beasts which be of sharp sense, which be witty, strong, and lusty: and which be also of a chaungeable nature and of swifte pace, and which couet to be conuersant among men: as the Ape, the Foxe, the Scurrell, the Weasel, the sheepe, the Cony, the Hart: likewise all such as be of a confused nature kinde: Among Byrdes and Foweles of the ayre.
He hath in his Domynion all such as bee most subtile and wily, as also those that be of shyrll voyce and of pleasaunt note, as ye Larke, the Lynnet, the Birde Ficedula which lyueth feedeth cheifly vpon Figs and grapes: also ye Blackmacke, the Manys or Thrust, the Parret, the Popiniay, and the Bird Ibis: among fishes he chalengeth the fishe called Trochus which is of one onely kinde,
and conceyueth and enge~dred of it selfe alone, through which occasion it is called Masculofaeminina, that is, both Male, and Female: likewise the wyly and crafty Polypus which is so crafty that it is seldome taken.
Amonge Planets, and chiefly amonge Trees, the Hasell, Filburd tree be his:
And among hearbes, Cinkfoyl or fiue leaued hearve: as also the hearbe Mercury, Fumitory, Pimpernell, Maioram, Parcely, and all such hearbes as beare a small fine lease, and which be also delectably and diuersly colored.
Among Precious stones his is the Emeralde, the Smaragde, the Achate, the Porphyrite, the Topaze, and al those which be of a chaungable colour.
Lastly among ye Elements hee claymeth the water in dyuerse poyntes of seruice to be his owne proper.
This Mercury with Gemini (one of the Sygnes or housen wherein he is placed) doth holde possesse Hircania,
Armenia, with ye Regions and Prouinces of Marmaricke, and Cyrenaica, as also the lowermost Aegypt.
And with Virgo (his other Sygne he possesseth these Kingdomes and Countreyes, Assyria, Babylon, Mesopotamia, Achaia, Greec, Creet, or Candy, and Elam, of whom ye Inhabita~ts are called Elamytes.
In euery attempt or busines of waight he both hasteneth setteth forward ye meanes thereof: as also helpeth forth to a good effect
and Maia, whose Nephewe S. Augustine sayeth was Trismegistus ye Aegyptian, which hath writte so Profoundly, and deepely of Philosophy.
Which Mercury as he is the God of Marchaunts and Rethoritians: so is he also of Theeues and Iuglers, which worke vpon deceipt sleights: he is also a Messenger of the heauenly powres aboue: his Sonnes were Eudorus, whom he had by Polymia as Homer witnesseth: Myrtilus, which draue the Horssiter, or Coche of Oenomaus the King: Hermaphroditus, whych was both Man and Woman: Daphnis the Sheephearde,
and Aethalis ye Cryar, or Beadell, which when hee was deade coulde reuiue himselfe agayne as they say:
VENVS is a faeminin Planet very placable and pleasaunt: a pacifier of Mars in his great fury, and malice, fiery feruency, quieting him with friendly and amiable Aspect, in such wise, as a beautifull and louinge Woman doth appease and still the rage, and anger of her Husband being incensed.
Shee alwayes accompanieth the Sunne: and whe~ shee goeth before him, and sheweth in our Horizon before the Sun she is called Lucifer the bright morning light or day star:
but when she followeth the Sunne, and is seene of vs after the Su~ne set she is called Hesperus the star of the night: and so howsoeuer or whe~soeuer she doth appeare shee is the Sunnes Messenger, either that hee is already comming, or that hee is already gone.
Whereof this verse of Virgil well witnesseth, whereas hee sayth: Ite domum saturae venit Hesperus, Ite capellae.
Yee Goates say with Bellies full that long haue harbored here, Goe get yee home for Hesper now beginneth to appere.
THis VENVS is of a bright shyning colour, being therein of al other starres most acceptable pleasaunt to the eyesight: and shee is called Venus for venustie and beautifull countenaunce: or (as some ymagine) for yt through those qualities and contemperature, which shee naturally planteth in ye body (that is to say) heate and moysture, shee causeth burninge Loue, and prouoketh to tickling Lust.
The Hebrewes call her NEGAHHOTH: The Greekes [undefined span alphabet], which signifieth the Fat or Fome of fleshe: for that (as the Poets imagine) she breedeth the Fatnesse of fleshe and Massynesse, or grosenesse of bloude.
And they haue it also in opinion that this Venus was bred first and came of the froth or bloude that flowed forth from ye Priuities of Coelus whom Saturne gelt, and cut of, and threwe them into the sea.
They also maryed her to Vulcane and made her his Wyfe, signifying thereby yt pleasure delighte is as it were wrought and kindled by fire and heare.
that her colour glittereth after the maner of siluer: and that she onely sheweth her selfe vnto vs in the Winter tyme, for in the Summer she is conuersaunt present about ye Pole Antarticke.
Her Mansion or place of abode is in ye Sygnes Taurus and Libra, her Exaltation or Ascende~t is in the

They are also geuen much to the composing and making of sweete Oyntments and Odoures: Their bodies are wel set, and be of proper features: their Faces vysages are rou~d: their hayre yealow, their Eyes glittering and rowling.
curteous, fayre spoken, milde, and modest, meete for all co~panies: whereupon for such her deseruing towards Mankinde, they of
First they drewe her out in the similitude or lykenesse of a Woman, vpon whose heade stoode a Byrd, which purported Loue his force: and her Feete were after Aegles feete, signifying the swyftnes of the same: and this woman held in her hand an Arrowe or Darte, noting forth the forcible stroke or persifenes thereof.
Another Image of her they were wont to engraue in the Precious stone Lazulus, which represented a fayre and beautifull mayde all vncouered and naked, whose hayre hunge downe a long all ouer her body, who also had a lookinge Glasse in her hande, and a Chayne tyed or fastened to her Necke, by whom stoode a fayre, younge stripling and beautifull, who with his left hand held her fast by the sayd chayne, and with his right hand held her by the hayre: herein peraduenture noting forth the circumstaunce of Suiters and Wooers, and so forth.
Shee had also another manner of Image other wheres: for there were that drew her forth in the habite of an Handmayden or Damsell, whose hayre lay scattering aboute her necke, and whose garment hung downe to
her shooe, which were all white and milky coloured: who helde in her right hande a Lawrell braunch, sometimes an Apple, or els a Posie of sweete and fresh flowers, in her lefthand she held a Combe, whereby is signified that al such as are borne vnder her, are naturally geuen to bee louers of ciuiluesse and cleanlinesse, and to delight much in pleasant smells smeete Odours.
Vnder her gouernment or rule are al such bruite beastes which are delicate leacherous, which are geuen to excesse of lust: as the Cony, the lesser kinde of Dogs, the Goate Goatebucke, the bull and al other which are of like set and disposition.
Ouer birds of fowles she hath ye rule of ye Swan, the Wagtayle, the Swallowe, the Sparrow, the Partrich, ye Bergander, ye Crow, all kindes of Doues, likewise the she Eagle, which is of such immoderate lust that being trod xiii. times in a day,
yet at ye call of her Mate is ready to take it agayne.
Amonge fishes Venus ruleth ouer the gylthead or Goldeney, ye Merling, ye Whiting, the fishe Cancharus which is Ielous ouer her Mate,
Among Plants or Hearbs subiect to her is the Violet, the Malow, the hearbe Venus
hayre or goldy lockes, ye Lylly, likewise the hearbe Lada or Ledum whose Gum is called Ladanum most co~monly Labdanum and is vsed in Pomanders: furthermore al euery odoriferous thing as is Ambra, which is englished Ambergrise: it is found on the sea shore by a countrey called Zingi in ye East part of ye world, is for his gray colour co~monly called of the Apothecaries Ambergrisia, hereof are made very precious Cordiall medicines: hetherto belongeth also the sweete smelling Time, the spice Saunders: furdermore all such fruits as are pleasant, of good taste, as ye Apple the Hare, ye fig, ye currant, the date, ye Pomgranet, &c. Amonge Precious stones shee chalengeth the Beril, ye Chrusolyte, ye Saphyr, ye Iasper, ye Cornellys, ye pretious Aetites the stone Lazulus, ye Corall al such as be beautifull, of mylke white or grassy greene colour: among Mettalls she requireth a right in Copper brasse, partly in siluer: and among sauours yt which is sweetest, delicious, vuctuous is hers: a+mong humors a part of bloude, as also the whole course of naturall seede is at her disposicion: among the Elements she holdeth a porcion in the ayre and also in the water.
First shee rayghneth (as shee is coupled) with Taurus, ouer Cyprus, Parthia, Mede, and Persis, the Cyclades or the fifty Iles in the Sea called Aegeum: And secondly as she is ioyned with Libra, she ruleth ouer Bactriana wherein were sometimes very many cities: likewise ouer the People Caspij a people in Tartaria dwelling next unto the sea Caspium: likewise ouer Serica, Thebais, Oasis, Troglodytis, Agrippa saith that Venus, in all kindes of Creatures purchaseth and procureth Loue betwixte Mate Mate: and that she laboureth chiefly the multiplicatio~ and increase of seede, to the continuance, and preseruation of the whole kinde, coueting alwayes as nigh as she can, and thereto with mighte mayne labouringe, to abandon and remooue Barraynnesse out of the way, which coueteth to cut of ye Race continuance of all.
SOL, or the Sunne is the fourth in place and preheminence amonge these seuen, is among them as it were a Ringe in the midst of his Throne, Trayne, and Garde.
For vnder him he hath Luna or ye Moone, Mercurius, and Venus of whom we haue already spoken: and aboue him in position and place he hath as many, that is toweete Mars, Iupiter, Saturne.
And as it should seeme it was not without great cause and consideration that the Mighty IEHOVAH, the Maker of Heauen and Earth placed the Sunne in such a proportioned equality among them all:
notwithstanding through his excellency he deserueth ye highest roome of prerogatiue and dignity.
For if the Sunne which is the most vniuersall cause, and the very beginning fountayne of light and influence, also of vitall heat,
to his intemperate heate of heart, maketh them in stomacke to be rather wylde sauage, rather then properly Puissant: and more venturouse rashe, and bolde, then co~siderate and Polliticke.
For it is ye excesse of heate, which burning and boyling within a man that bringeth boldnesse and rashnesse, when as the bloude about the heart is immoderately and to much set on fire.
There is nothing almost gloriously mentioned in the sacred Scriptures, but ye glory thereof is likened resembled to the Sun:
as ye Transfiguration of Christe, in which Mathew sayth, his Face did shyne as the Sunne.
So Ihon in his Reuelation sayth that he sawe the Face of the Sonne of ma~ shyning as the Sunne in his greatest glory.
(But to ende with these:) This Sol was fabled of the Poets to haue bene Iupiter, and Latonaes Sonne, who for that he is as it were euery day newly borne, is paynted out in likenes of a younge childe, noting forth thereby that hee is euery day newly rysinge.
His property is neuer to shewe vs all the day longe, one and the self same looke: for in ye morning whe~ he riseth he sheweth red, at noone hee sheweth more
white, at his going downe or sett, he somewhat sheweth wan and pale, but often he appeareth also red.
Wheruppon for such diuersity the Poets imagine that hee hath foure horses, which do daylye at theyr appoynted tymes and seasons, one after an other, helpe to draw the Sunne about the zodiacke.
And the fyrst of these they name Pyrois, the second Eous, the third Aetho~, and the fourth Phlegon.
The Sunne, if so be he shew at his rysing and seeme clowdye or darke, and looketh wan, he causeth vpon this more then wonted warmth: hee foresheweth rayne, if he looketh red: hee betokeneth tempestes to be at hand, if hee shyneth forth cleere: or casteth his beames towardes the South, hee prognosticateth more moderate seasonable weather.
Martianus sayth, that the Sunne as he is in the midedest of the zodiacke, beateth backe from him twelue seueral lightes, or more broad Sunbeams: which reflectate themselues and remayne vpon the twelue signes.
The same Author also affyrmeth that there is nothing so occult or deeply co~+tayned within the entrayls and body of the
It is sayde that ye Indians, or men of Inde had Sol or the Sun to a banquet, and the ba~quetting place was in the Ocean Sea: Wherupon now they say, that before any fore rayne, or showers discending, we feele a terrayne heat going before.

This is as Plinie saith, in his booke, ye Lord and prince of tyme: and as Prolome sayth, the verye spirite or wel of lyfe in all liuing thinges.
The Hebrewes call him IPHNATH, the Greeks [undefined span alphabet].
To vtter forth his exceeding benefites, they vsed in olde tyme to draw him forth after diuers likenesses: as somwhiles after the attyre ryal robes of a king, wearing a crowne of gold on his head, and sitting in his chayre of state, hauinge vnder his footea round globe or bowle meaning to vtter forth thee by ye Sol made many such partyes as were vnder hym, honorable, tryumphant and inuincible.
Orpheus calleth the Sun, the glory and face of heauen, and the sufferaygne ey sight or right eye of
It fortuneth oftentymes yt thys Sun notwtstandinge his great wo~derful light is obscured, darkned,
as it were bereued therof, which is called ye eclipse of ye Sun, Which so often as he is in coniunctio~ wt the Moone, especially if such co~iunction be Diameter wyse vnder ye Ecliptical lyne, in ye head or tayle of ye Dragon, by some interposition of ye Moone betweene the Sun our eysight:
this neuer happeneth that the Sun is whollye eclipsed, but whe~ as ther is such Diameterlyke co~iunctio~ of the Moone Sun vnder the Ecliptical line in ye head or tayl of ye drago~ as they both meete together, eyther in ye head or tayle, so diametewise opposite, as that ye selfe same diameter passeth by the center of them both.
But there may be a particular eclipse of the Sun, then, when as ye moone is in Coniunetion almost vnder the Eclipticall lyne verye nigh within the heade or tayle of the Dragon, and within the bonds borders of the general eclipse, of whiche wee haue spoke~ aboue.
Betweene the general particular eclipse of ye Sun ther is this differe~ce: for yt in the first al ye whyle yt ye coniunctio~ is directly in ye head or tayl of
the Dragon all ye whole body of the Sun, is shadowed darkened, wherby ther happeneth such an eclipse, as that a man can see nothing of the globe of ye Sunne.
But in the particular eclipse, when the coniunction is onely nigh to one of the foresayde poyntes, then is not the whole body of the Sun darkened, but onelye some part: and ther, where it happeneth ye Moone is placed betwixt the Sunne and our eyesight.
And this kynd of Eclipse is oftentymes so smal, as that it is scant perceyued, but supposed to be (as it were) some spotte in the bodye of the Sunne.
it is therefore manifest, that there can he no Eclipse of ye Sun but in the tyme of such Coniunction, as is aboue sayde: as likewyse in the new of the Moone: as there cannot neyther bee any eclipse of the Moone, but in the time of Op+position and ful Moone: because that other wyse the Moone can not bee obiected betweene the Sun and our eyesight.
Now a litle to speak of both their differe~+ces (which is much) recke~ yt to be right necessary.
Fyrst they differ in this, that the Eclipse of the Sunne requireth Coniunction in the same poynt, or very nigh ye same
poynt: but the Eclipse of the Mone requireth Opposition in opposite poyntes.
Secondly the Sun must be eclipsed in ye time of the new Moone: but the Moone in ye time of the ful Moone.
In the first the Moone is interplaced betweene the Sun, and the Earth: In this last the earth is obieceed betweene the Sun and Moone.
In the first the shadow of the Moone doth darken the earth: in the second the shadow of ye earth doth obfuscate the bodye of the Moone.
In the first there is onely a substraction of the light from our eyesight.
In the last there is a depriuation of reall light.
There are besydes these more especiall differences, most worthy to be noted: whereof the fyrst is this, that the eclipse of the Moone (whe+ther it be to tall, or in part) is euer vniuersall in all places of the Earth: but the Eclipse of the Sunne is neuer so generall, which is thus proued: because that the Sun is not at any tyme euery where eclipsed: but whyles here we lacke therby the Sunnes light for a tyme, euen in the selfe same instant, others a far of enioy the light of the same: yea and sometymes those, that he not so farre of, and the reason is, for yt
the Sunne doth but onely suffer some obumbration for a tyme, throughe the interposition of the Mone, which cannot but in a part of the Sun, hinder hys light, and not totally nor whollye.
Agayne there is this other difference, as that the Sun beginneth to be Eclipsed on the West, part of his body, because that the Moones proper motion is from the East.
But ye moon is eclipsed chiefly on the east syde of her bo+dye.
But now a litle let vs tary to reporte what kynd of Eclispe happened in the time of the passion and sufferyng of our sauiour Christ, which befell at noone dayes, and continued all the whole tyme that Christ hanged vpon the crosse: which was so miraculous straunge, that besydes the testimony and witnes that the Euangelistes geue forth thereof,
it is also registred and remembred in the hystoryes of Pagans and Heathen men.
Besydes that Dionisius Ariopagita an eye witnes therof: the~ a student in the vniuersity of Heliopolis in Aegipt, in his epistle to Polycarpus, maketh mention, that hee together with Apollophanes a noble Philosoper did both se and behold the same: and also with exceedinge
much astonishment, and admiration therof considered of the same most deeplye and diligently.
It is manifest that this Eclipse, was not natural, but rather supernatural.
For the naturall Eclipse must bee as wee sayd before, onely in the tyme of the Coniunction of the Sun and Moone, and in the new of the Moone: but when Christ suffered it was full moone, and the same opposite to the Sun as both witnesseth yt, same Dyonisius which saith he saw the same as also Apollophane.
Besydes holye wrytte doth very cleerelye set downe the tyme reporting Chryst agaynst the feast of Easter after he had taken the Passouer with his Disciples incontinently almost to haue dyed, suffred vppon ye crosse.
And this feast of Easter must alwayes of necessity by the prescript of Moses lawe bee obserued, and kept in the ful Moone, so did the Iewes obserue the same most diligentlye: so that this Eclipse, happeninge then at that instant and tyme, could not be as other Eclipses of the Sunne bee natural, through the vnfitnes and incommodiousnes of that tyme: for there is no tyme so vnpossyble to worke such an effecte, as in the tyme of
Opposition: for then the Sun and Moone which require coniunction in that behalf, are neuer more remote, or farder distance from coniunncion, the~ in that present time.
In fyue propertyes therefore fynde this miraculous eclipse, yt so happened at ye passio~ of our sauiour Christ, to differ fro~ all other eclipses, yt be only natural.
The firste which wee laste touched was in the time therof, which hapned the~ at the full of the Mone, a tyme most vnfit to the generation of my natural Eclipse.
The second appeared in the corse of the Moone, which, wher as naturally of her owne proper motion, she goeth from the East to the West.
In this straunge eclipse then seene, Dyonisius sayth, he saw her with a most swift pace returne very stranngely from the East toward the South, vntil shee stood directlye vnder the Sun, wheras shee stayed by the space of whole three howers, and by that meanes caused darkenes ouer al the whole face of the earth.
And after the third hour about which time our sauiour Christ was deade, shee returned agayne to her owne place in the East, with a most swift course appearing there agayne as it had bene in a tryce.
shee was seene vnder the Sun: but in the euening, and at the Sunnes going down she appeared new agayn in the East, right opposite to the Sunne.
The thyrd poynte wherin this miracle differeth from other vsuall Eclipses, was vpon the strange begynning of the same: for this began on the East syde of the Sunn, wheras all other wonted eclipses of the Sun vse to begin to be eclipsed after their naturall order, at ye west part of the Sun.
The fourth poynt of difference was herein, which was verye straunge: For that part of the Sun which was first darkened obscured of his light by the interposition of the moone, did lastly shew forth restitucion of his light which is otherwyse in other Eclipses: which in ye part of the Sunne that seemeth fyrst obscured dother agayne fyrst and formost appeare in the same to be restored.
And then the Moone passed not asyde from the Sun as she is wont in his naturall eclipse, but stode right vnder him for the space of thre whole howers: and so shee not after that, goyng on beyond the Sun, but returning to the East her place from whence she fyrst came, gaue great occasio~ of admiration wonder.
also was vpon the perduratio~: taryance and staye of the same strange eclipse.
For ye Sunnes ordinarye Eclipses cannot continue lo~g, as which are very spedely perfour med, by reason yt the body of the Sun doth infinitely exceede in bignes quantity the body of ye Moone: as also for that ye course of the Moone is very swift.
For which two causes, fyrst because the Moone is so little in respect of the other, therefore not able any tyme to obscure hyde away ye Suns light, neither totally nor in part from our aspect.
And agayne for the swiftnes velocity of the Moones course, shee cannot hyde away the Sun beyng so huge and big any lo~g tyme: but he must needes shyne out on one syde or other.
Besydes, this wo~derful eclipse procured of God to shew forth euidently ye most haynous fact of ye Iewes, in abusyng his Son so, as it greatly grieued ye stars Sun aboue not onely amased many men, so yt many stroke their breastes and returned from Caluary where he was crucifyed:
co~fessing and saying, verely this was the son of God: as ye Centurion and others: but also ther was a general great darknes ouer al ye earth, fro~ ye hower vntil
for els it could not be true yt Dyoni+sius the~ in Heliopolis in Aegipt gaue forth to be true vndoutedly in one of ye yt either ye maker of al thinges then fuffered, or else yt domes day the end of ye world was then come: if yt this eclipse had bene onely in Iudea, which is so far of fro~ Aegipt.
Besides this a lo~g time after by ye du~pe yt this sight stroke into ye hartes of ye people of Athens superstitious me~, Paul being co~uersant among them awhyle, and vewinge their doyngs narrowly, chau~ceth to espye there an Aulter wherin was writte~ vnto the vnknowen God erected as is sayd prese~tlye after ye feare yt this eclipse cast vpo~ ye Athe+nia~s, which is very far fro~ Iudea, proueth it to be more vniuersal: so yt they scant it to narrowly yt seeme to bou~d it onely wt in the borders of yt place, where yt villanous fact was committed.
For shal we thinke that ye miraculous going backe of ye Sun, which happened in ye dayss of Ezechias kynge of Iuda, witnessing his recouery of helth was alone the~ perceyued of ye inhabitants ther, not aswel also among nations furder of: for if we should so think, we should be deceiued.
of, sent afterwardes letters vnto the sayd Ezechias by Ambassadours and Princes of Babilon, to enquire of the wonder.
And shal not we vndoubtedly bee resolued that this testimony that God gaue in this order of the abuse of his son, reached furder then Iudea, na euen ouer all the whole world? for euen the very horror of that fact, caused ye Sun (as it were to kepe backe the benefite of illumination of me~ yt had so yll deser+ued at the hands of his Maker, Creator.
But now hauing sufficiently spoken of Eclipses, aad of theyr kyndes and causes, am to proceede to other visions sights, caused oftentymes by meanes of ye Suns working, which are no lesse meruaylous.
Of the which sorte is the shew and sighte of many Sunnes at once in the fyrmament called of the Gretians [undefined span alphabet]: which are ingendred through this occasion.
When as some cloude of good thicknes and continuant, and which is also regular vniforme is placed so,
as that it is neither vnder the Sun, nor directly agaynst it but as it wer on his syde, and so nigh as it may be resolued into rayne, and beyng not yet resolued, the Sunne by the refractions of hys
beams doth imprynte and forme his owne Image there, as hee doth oftentymes in brasse that is well and finely pollished.
And this ymage of the Sun so consisting on his syde is called Parahelius, of the Greeke preposition [undefined span alphabet], which signifyeth next, the Greeke nowne [undefined span alphabet], which sygnifyeth the Sun: so that Parahelius is another impression in all poyntes mostlike to ye Sun.
Wee sayd before that, that Cloude which must be the mater hereof, must be condensed or thickt, that it may the better cause forth refraction.
And that it must bee continuate, that it maye receaue a more perfect Image of the Sunne: likewyse that it must be regular and altogeather vniforme that it may receaue a more true and perfit image therof: and also that it must beready to be resolued into rayne, that the Sunne may the better represent his lykenes in the same: and yet not conuerted, or resolued, for that if it were already resolued ye parts therof beyng discontinued, the sayd clowd were not fyt neither to receyue the ymage of the Sun, nor to shew forth the same.
And these impressions be called Suns, through the likenes that they haue of the Sun: so
that at their appearance we are to be perswaded, that there is but one of them the true Sun indeed, and the other to bee but likenesses of the Sun.
There haue bene three Sunnes appeared at once in ye dayes of our Forefathers and Auncientes,
as when Spurius Posthumius and Quintus Minutius, were Consuls, and when Quin+tus Minutius, Marcus Partius wer in ye office: and also when Marcus Antonius Publius Dolobella had the same rome: besydes when Marcus Lepidus, Lucius Plancus enioyed the same superioritye: more then three Sunnes at one tyme hath neuer bene seene.
Sunnes at the tyme of the byrth of our sauiour Iesus Christ, which at length comming together into one gaue forth therby some significatio~ of the mistery of the holy Trinity to be co~tanied in vnity which now by the comming of Christ was to be preached in all the worlde: and that the same Child which was then born, the Sunne of righteousnes, hadd, and contayned in him completely the fulnes of the Godhead, and that together with Christ, now neuerthelesse incarnated, the Father and the holy
Ghost were al one in substaunce, and all of them distinct in personne and all of them but one God, one vncreate and euerlasting power, which is to blessed for euermore, Amen.
This Parahelius, or appearaunce of diuers Suns at one tyme, differeth from that Impression, whiche is called Halo,
which sheweth forth ye similitude of a garland about the Sun: and lykewyse from ye raynbow, in many poyntes, but chieflye in the situasion of place, for that the garlande is euer directly vnder the Sun: and ye rainbowe is euer ouer agaynste hym oppositlye: but this Parahelius is situated in none of these orders: for if this should bee in place of the first, the Sunne must needs disperse the matter therof with his heate, and if it were in place of the last, through ye great distance therof the distraction should be to feeble to cause forth the image of the Sun.
Therfore it is placed on the syde of the Sun, that the matter thereof cannot through such nighnes be easily dissolued, yt the Sun beams may occasionate a sufficie~t refractio~ to ye better fashioning of the Suns likenes: whereas this Halo doth seme to be as it were vnder ye Sun, as also
about ye Moone, euen ryght vnder her, yet notwithstanding it is but engendred in the midle region of the ayre, often beneath ye same, and caused onely by such directe situation and placing: but it is through the imbesility of our eyesight, that wee therein beyng deceyued, do thinke amisse, the sayd garland to be neere the Sunne and Mone.
Vnder which this Halo sheweth and appereth more often by a greate deale, then vnder the Sun: for the Sun with his adure~t heat doth more easily dispach, and consume such vapours, as go to the originall thereof, then the Moone, who hath a more moyst light and feeble heate.
and cyrcled by reason of the condensity, or thicknes of the clowde, dyspersyng aboute the Sun beams, as it had bene a circle of bloud.
And this sight was seene (as Plinie reporteth it) in the tyme of the Consulship of Lucius Iulius,
There hath bene also verye prodigious, and very long lacke and want of the Sunnes shyning forth,
as was after that tyme, that Caesar the Dictator was slayne: and in the tyme of the warres of
Antony, the sun almost for a whole yeres space neuer a whit shyning forth.
There hath bene also seene a bloudy bow aboute the Sun, as when Lucius Opimius the thyrd time, and Quintus Fabius ye second time, were made Consuls:
as also in ye daies of the selfe same supertority imposed vpo~ Lucius Portius, and Marcus Acilius.
So there were seene starres in the day tyme following, and accompanying the Sunne all the day longe, and they shewed aboute the circle of the Sunne, as they had bene a kind of garla~d, or a diuerse coloured kind of circle, as in the beginning of the Empyre of Augustus Caesar.
If this garlandlike impression called Halo whether it be of the Sun of Moone vanisheth away sodainly of by little and little lyke smoake,
it signifieth and prognosticateth fayre wea+ther to ensue: for that those vapours which otherwyse are to bee resolued into rayne, are now vanished and gone.
The nexte impressio~ which haue to speake of, (which is also one of the Sunnes effecte) is the Raynebowe, whych is thus engendred in a watry cloud,
ye same ready to resolue into a shower right opposite against ye sun,
as the beames of ye sunne are beaten backe agayne, it causeth the same Cloude, albeit obscurely, and imperfectly to expresse ye Image of the same, which neuerthelesse for the far distance and interiection of the vapours being betwene the sunne and ye same Cloude, expresse it very weakely.
Which inbecillity causeth the figure of a bowe in the same cloude, beautified distinguished with
Greene, and purple, and sometimes red, in steade of Greene, a colour more blacke then Greene: which diuersity of coloures come hereof, as the beames of the sun are drawen out longer or shorter in the cloude: for the longer they be reached out, so much the weaker and feebler are the colours of the Raynbowe: as which also geue forth a greater obscurity and blacknes in ye same: so yt the yealow colour altreth to a greene, the greene to a more blacke.
And agayne, the same Beames beinge become weaker geue forth in the Rainbowe a more weake colour.
And contrarywyse so much ye lesse as these Beames be stretched out, so much the more fresh and florishing colours doth the Raynebowe geue out.
Now the figure of the Raynebowe why it is croked, or halfe circled after ye manner of a Bowe, it would be considered.
When there is a Cloude regular right set, and the same in a parte thereof as it were sundred in one horizon, so as the other part of the cloude going and declininge beneath ye same horizon is taken away fro~ our sight, hereupon yt Raynbowe appeareth croked: and the nearer the sunne commeth to ye horizon, so much the greater is ye raynbowe.
So that the rainbowe doth neuer appeare after a whole circle, or bigger then halfe a circle, but either as a semicircle, at one end touching one parte of our horizon, and at ye other ende the contrary parte of the same: or els it is sometimes lesse then a semicircle.
When there doe appeare but two at once they haue doth the selfe same colours: but a contrary placing of the same: so that whereas the principall hath yealowishe, greene, and red: the other hath in his situation first red, then greene, and lastly yealowishe.
And that Raynbow which sheweth weakest, is the Paterne or
Also whe~ there doth appeare three at once the third is so weake as it can scantly bee perceiued.
For the thyrde commeth of the refractions of the Beames of the second, which must needes be but very weak.
And this thirde being of such weakenes wyll haue notwithstanding alwaies the colours of the first and strongest, and wil be lightly after a yelow, greene and purple colour.
Further this is euide~t that the higher the Sunne is exalted aboue our horrizon, so much the lesse doth the Rainebow appear.
as when any sheweth aboute the mid day, they shew very smal.
But those which shew either shortly after the Sonne rysinge, or not longe before the sunne set: they bee the greatest.
So likewyse in the midst of sommer, whe the Sun is in the chiefest Sommer pointes and Signes: as when ye daies bee longest wée see no Rainebowes shewe forth at any time, aboute noone or the mid day, But after the Aequinoctium of Autumne following, when the sun entreth in to Libra: we see about the same time many Rainbowes almost at al houres of ye day, Now come wee to Comettes or blasing
and occasioned by the suns operation chiefely, and the other starres.
Whereas by the force of the sun and the other starres there is eleuated and drawen vp on hye, ve+ry much viscous matter hoate dry, grosse and fat, and such as will be commodiously kyndled and set on fyre, from these earthly places to the highest region of the Ayre, where it being turned aboute round, wyth the motion of the ayre, and being nighe the fire is kindled and set on fyre equally and on euery side, and so other exhalatio~s styll co~tinuing and comming on doth both nourish and encrease the burning thereof: such kinde of impression is called a comet.
The matter whereof if it be grosser in ye midst, and thinner on the furthermore and outeward sides, it appeareth after the manner of hayre, or as the Horses mane: is called Stella Comata.
But if the sides outward parts therof be be~ding downward in le~gth tailewise it is called Cometa caudata: but if those sides parts being very subtile be thinly layed downe or scattered belowe beardewise, it is called Stella Barbata.
The matter of a Comet must needes bee much and great, and very plentifull or copopious, or els otherwise it shoulde soone be consumed away throughe the Adurant heate of the sunne.
And the shortest time yt euer any Comet continueth and is seene, is at the least the space of seuen whole dayes,
dayes ere it vanisheth away, neuer geuing ouer his fiery shewe and looke, vntill all such viscouse matter be quite co~sumed away in burninge out.
The chiefest time of a Comet is chiefly in and about ye time of Autumne,
because that then there is sufficient heate to eleuate such viscouse matter, and then there is also temperate heate, which easily suffereth such matter without any hinder aunce of the same to be soundly compact together: which in Summer cannot bee well done, as at what time such grosse matter of exhalation throughe the Sunnes heate dispersing the same, also for the extreame coldnesse of the middle Region of the Ayre, doth not permit the same to passe vp into the highest Region.
So in the Springe tyme there is not for ye more parte sufficient heate to eleuate
so great matter: in Winter the extremenesse of Moysture, and colde is vtterly repugnant thereto.
And yet Aristotle in his first booke of his Meteores maketh mention of a Comet very horrible, great, and greeuous, which was seene in the dayes of Asius the Prynce of the Athenians, euen in a very frosty and colde winter, but as he saith, very fayre, and cleare, which at ye first appeared so litle that in the first day of his shewe it was as it had ben vanished away and gone, a litle before the Sunne set: but afterwardes it shewed agayne so grat that it cast out his lighte to the thirde parte of Heauen, and shyned forth in manner of the sinne: so that it went as it were a way of light: and this ascendinge at the last to the Horizon did there aboutes weare away.
Whensoeuer there be any Comets there followeth shortly after great tempests and wyndes and continuance of dry weather, great drouthes.
These Comets doe prognosticate Warre, Commotions, sturres, stryfes, Treasons, and such like, because yt in the tyme of their Generation and continuance, exceding heate ruleth and boyleth in men, which Incenseth and sturreth forwardes
And besides this, it signifieth more especially the death of Princes and Noble Personages, for that the Ayre which then is more grosse and viscouse through the cor+rupted matter of ye Comet, is not so wholsome for delicate and deliciouse Persons, as for the lusty and course Constitution of the bodyes appetites of Labourers and Husbandmen.
But now to returne to the proper possession of the sunne in all kindes of Bodies here belowe.
Such as be borne vnder Sol, are for the most parte of a browne colour, and of smal stature, yet well and comely knit and proporcioned: they be also of a very thin haire and curled Head, Gray eyed: they be also hawty stomacked, and they are aduaunced often to great honours and dignities.
And the Disposition of their minde is such that they be studious of difficult and hard matters, very desirous of glory and ronowne.
They bee also fast and faythfull in friendship and constant in Fact and worde.
They bee likewise, Wise, and Polliticke touching common wealth affayres, and are giue~ much to procure the profit of their cou~try.
Vnder his gouernment among the kindes of Beastes are also all such as be of bigge stature, and of hawty stomacke: likewyse such as are desierous of superiority, and haue naturally a pryde in themselues: Of which sorte is the Lyon, the Crocodile, the wilde and vntamed Lynx, the Ramme, the Oliphant, the Tyger, likewise the Wolfe whom the aunciente Gentils dedicated to Apollo and Latona: amonge Fowles hee hath as his owne ye Phaenix,
which chiefly keepeth about the Coastes of Arabia, and is in bignesse about the greatnesse of an Eagle,
which shyneth like Golde aboute her necke, and in other partes of her she is pur+ple coloured, sauing that her Tayle being blewe is distinguished with rose coloured feathers.
hundred and three score yeares: and when she waxeth olde and is weary of her lyfe, shee getteth slippes of Casia, and Frankinsence, maketh her Nest on hygh as nigh the sun as she can, in ye same she dieth being brunt consumed into Ashes by ye suns heate: out of whose bones ashes there inge~greth first as it were a litle smal worme, which in shorte time after proueth to become a younge Phaenix.
There is no man that euer seeth the Phenix eating: likewise to Sol appertayneth the Eagle which keepeth most in Mountaynes,
and which almost of all Fowles is without her cry, is also very rauenous, so that whatsoeuer pray it catcheth, it carieth it away swiftly.
But one good property it is not without herein, for that it seeketh after his pray a far of alwayes, neuer spoyling about the place where she abideth and breedeth.
They neuer commonly dye vpon death, nor sicknesse, but vpon famine: for yt when they were old, their bill growing out at length in the vpper part thereof onely, and the neather parte of the same ra+ther shrynking then still continuing at his olde stay, doth cause that she cannot co~modiously receiue her Foode.
Her flight and trauaylinge is onely in the after Noone, sitting still idle all the foore Noone eying the assemblies of men, will not remooue till that she haue had wearinesse therein.
In her Neast is onely found the Precious stone Aetites which is very Medicinable and which no fyre can doe harme vnto.
Her feathers being put amonge other Brides Feathers will eate and consume vp the other:
this hath a great and mortall hatred to the Dragon, which very greedely hunteth after the Eagles Egges.
SOL also or the Sunne, ruleth ouer the Vultures whych are of such smell,
as that they can thereby finde out any dead Carkasse wheresoeuer it be hidden: lykewise ouer all such Fowles as which with very pleasaunt Note and Ditty or Songe, doe as it were welcome the Sunne at his vprising: Of which fortes are the Nightingale,
which oftentimes so striueth to excell in her singing as that in strayning herselfe she falleth a bleeding oftentimes: yea, and the continuance of her singinge is such as Plynie reporteth,
that fiftene whole dayes and nyghts together shee neuer leaueth of therein.
Of all byrdes for her Song most maruaylous: first that there should bee in so small a body, so forcible a Breath or spirite: secondly, that in the same beinge but one body, all the whole perfection of Musicke, as it were, should be vttered forth and sounded, nowe in playne Note, nowe descantinge, anon recording, and anon recanting all: one while displeased with her Note she is in her Base, and by and by in
her Treable, shortly after in the meane: so that it is a mater euen almost of astonishement to see and heare such variety of Melody to issue and proceede from so small a breast: which emulateth in a maner all the melodious, and harmonycall Instruments that euer mans arte or wit coulde deuyse.
The Male, Female hereof doth striue oftentimes, which of them may most excell other in Song, so long that now then one of them killeth themselues thereby.
And their younge listen to them both, framinge themselues to imitate yt Note yt they most delight in, in as attentiue sorte as the diligent.
Scholer geeueth good heede to the wholsome instruction of his Maister.
whole dayes and nightes together chiefly in the spring time: then being so wearied they rest a while, being nothing so earnest to sing as before: in Su~mer after, they sing other whiles, but nothi~g so artificially or variously: in which time with their note they also chau~ge their colour.
Lastly in winter they be seldome or neuer heard or seene.
Her breedinge onely is in the springtime and she layeth Egs. Vnder the sunnes gouernment also is the
Larke, as also ye Cocke which is ye nights watchman, and ye mornings Embassadour:
and the Artificers, wayfaringmen, hushandmens Clocke to awake them oute of sleape, to settle them forwardes towardes their next dayes busines.
The Cocke goeth to roust about the sunset, and afore his rysinge agayne hee commonly croweth in the morning three seuerall times: in which crowing he beateth himselfe with his winges.
He is very Emperious ouer all the other fowles where he abydeth, and knoweth right well the force of his Spurres: if he getteth the victory in fight he triumpheth in crowing: but if he be beaten he is ashamed and hydeth himselfe.
Vnder Sol is also the Crowe, the Pye, the Goshawkes which be of diuerse sorts:
for some of them flye co~monly after Fowles belowe: other some as the fowles flyeth about the trees: other as they sit on high: other as they flys in ye open ayre.
In a part of Thracia which lyeth vpon Amphipolis the Men and Goshaukes there, are of such mutual society fellowship as yt they co~monly hawke together, in such order yt the men there doe but onely beate ye byrdes vp out of ye thickets woods, ye goshawks tarying on hie meet
them and strike them downe assone as they haue flowen vp.
And therefore for this seruiceablens of theirs, they ordinarily looke for some parte of the pray, and haue it.
It is not seene at any time that the Goshauke eateth the heart of Fowles.
Under Sol is also the Peacocke, which gloryeth in him selfe in beholding his Golden,
Glorious, Glittering colours, which chiefly shewe most beautifull and Radiant, as hee standeth right ouer agaynst the Sunne: This after hee hath once cast his Feathers and lost his tayle, (which he doth euery yeare) hydeth him selfe and is as it were sorrowfull for a time, vntill the same be growen agayne.
yeares: and beginneth to shew in his gay coloures after hee is once three yeares olde.
The first that euer caused the Peacocke to bee serued in the course of Seruice at any Feaste, was Hortensius the Orator.
which is like to a Mans Nayle, which is of such glittering colour that it shineth wonderfully in the day time, and sheweth also shyningly in the nyght: lykewise in the same order vnder Sol is ye
which is of all kindes of Fyshes most cyuill, Aelianns sayth that they haue their King vpon who~ they alwayes waite.
They hadde in olde time such an opinion, yt whosoeuer coulde see any of these being vpon the Seas hee should haue prosperous successe and good lucke in all his affayres.
which hath as it were an hundred feete, and which hauing vnder the bayte receiued in the hooke into her Belly, doth perbrake and cast out all her Bowels within her, vntill shee be deliuered of ye same, and then afterwardes she soopeth and receyueth them in againe: hetherto pertayneth the Seafoxe,
whych contrarywise as shee perceyueth her selfe caught, doth not cast vp as the other, but doth deuour and receiue the Hooke Line downe into her Belly more and more, vntill she commeth to the weakest parte of ye Lyne, and then the shame she byteth a sunder.
which never deuoureth the Hooke or byteth at the bayte a right or forth on as the other doth, but contrariwise eateth and gnaweth on the sides thereof so warely
Hee repasseth himselfe, and is neuer taken with the hooke.
Unto Sol belongeth also the Crabush which delighteth in rocky places, which also were fat in ye sprynge time, and Autumne: and specially then at the full of the Moone.
They liue a longe time, and haue eight feete bending crokedly in one towards another.
The Females first foote is doubled or parted, the males is al alyke.
These being in fear wil creepe as fast backeward as forward.
They fight betwene the~selues as it were with hornes which they seeme to haue after the maner of Rammes.
They say that whe~ Sol entreth into Cancer that the bodies of these which being deade and cast forth into dry places do reuiue againe there, and doe degenerate into a kinde of Scorpions.
Amongest Plantes, and firste, formost amongest Trees, these are in subiection to Sol: first the Olyue tree, whose iuice is the oyle Oliue.
Also the Cyprouse treee which chiefely prospereth in ye yland Creta: also the Cedar tree, the Balme tree which in preciousnes of smell, far excedeth
all other woods: and is only to be had as it groweth in the land of Iury: This tree neuer groweth higher then two cubits hye: Likewise the pepper tree which groweth chiefely in Arabia, although now in Italy there is a kind of pepper tree not much vn like the Myrt tree.
This pepper tree, hath a certaine cod as ye Iuniper hath, but this is more small,
in which lyeth the Pepper seede: which cods pluckte of before they begin togape or breake out and dryed against the sun and rowled out at length, causeth the longe Pepper: and contrarywise those Coddes suffered and let alone tyll they are ready to fal forth out of the huske themselues, grow round and shew fyrst white, vntill they being dryed, and as it were rosted in the Sun, doe thereby both change theyr colour to black, become wrinckled.
With these pepper berries there are often Iuniper berries intermedled whych are taken for the other.
Hetherto likewyse belongth the Cinamon tree which chyefely groweth in Aethiopia,
whose stickes is best at the top of the tree aboute the bignes of a ma~s hand: then next towardes and at the body of the same: but worst of al towards ye roote thereof.
And the tree is neuer aboue the heyghte of two cubits:
likewise vnder Sol is the Lote tree which is a noble tree in Arabia, so pre+cious that they say a man shall neuer feele ache or haue disease of body so longe as he vseth to eate thereof.
The fruite thereof is saffron coloured, and is in quantity as byg as a beane.
The fruite hereof is of so pleasaunt tast, as is wine: hereof is confecte made a kinde of wine, but it lasteth not beyonde the space of ten Dayes.
Wyth thys whole armies haue bene sustained ofte~ for lacke of other necessaries alonge tyme, and haue done very well.
It is called of some Arbor solaris, the Sunnes tree, for that ye figure of his fruite and leafe is after the Sunne.
There is (as Ruellius witnesseth) a notable tree in Affricke of thys kynde name: of whose fruite if any straunger doth taste or eate of, he incontinently doth forget himselfe of what place and countrey he is of.
Fyrst the herbe Helyotropium which turneth round with the Sunne, both opening, encreasing and closing as the Sunne ryseth, ascendeth, or goeth downe.
Lykewyse the herbe Pyonie, Buglosse which is so sayde because it is like a bullockes
Likewise the herbe Scammonie whose leaues are like Iuye but softer and more Tryanglewise, his flower is white.
Thys is very hoate purgeth choller, and layd to any swellinges doth helpe the same.
Likewyse the hearbe Dictamus which is lyke Sorrel, yet very bitter as Di+oscorides saith.
It is chiefely founde growing in Creet, and with the same Hartes being wounded or shot in with any arrow or darte do herewith cure themselues, and discharge theyr bodyes of the weapo~ whatsoeuer: Likewyse the hearbe Celidonye which is vsed of Swallowes as a Medecine to helpe the sorenes of theyr eyes.
Amongest gemmes or precions stones, these are chiefly subiected to Sol.
Fyrst ye Chrusolyte whych being held against the sunne doth gieue forth beames in color like gold.
Hetherto also belongeth the precious Iris whose colour is after a chrystall.
It is alwayes found in his fashion sixe cornered or sixe square.
This being held in any couert place doth manifestly shew forth the reflexi+ons of the Sunne vpon the contrary parte or side of the wal.
stone called Heliotropius, which is after a Iasper, which being held vp betwixte the sunne and our eyes, doth make the Sunne to apeare bloudy, and representeth to vs a likenes of the sunnes Eclypse.
With this, (as also with the Hearb of like name) the Magicians playnely professed that a man may goe inuisible.
Hereupon this last is called Solsequium, as also Heliotropium. for that it followeth and turneth rounde about with the sunne.
which is made effectuous by the sunne to helpe agaynst Poysons: which also maketh the bearer saufe, getteth him fauour, winneth him riches, and disposeth him to a quicke sharp vnderstanding: and being held or reserued in the Mouth, comforteth and cheareth the heart or minde, and next after that, all the whole partes of the body.
Hetherto lykewise belongeth the Precious Pyrophyte, which is of a mixed red:
as also ye Pa~taure which draweth all other stones to it, after such wise as the Lodestone draweth yron: of other some it is called Pantherus, for yt it is diuersly spotted after the maner of the Panther: and it is called Pantochras, for
Also the Topaze, the Chrusopasse, the Rubine, the Gem cal+led Solis Oculus, as also the Carbuncle, which of the sunne receiueth his hoat burning colour.
Among Mettals Sol hath in in his regiment golde beautifying it wyth so excellent a colour as that it shyneth like the sunne: as also gieuing it that force and powre confortatiue that it hath, as also the powre restauritiue: likewise his is ye Latten mettall, and the more puerer Brasse.
Humoures which bee his is the pure Life bloud, as also he chalengeth the life breath.
And finally among the Elements, he hath to doe with the fier and fiery flame.
Sol with Leo hath speciall gouernment ouer Italy, Apulia, Spayne, Cicilia, Phaenicea, Caldaea, other such like Prouinces, and Kyngdomes.
The Sunne finisheth and endeth his Course aboute the Zodiacke in
MARS in Greeke is called [undefined span alphabet], for yt hee is fierce and fiery hoat: so is he also dry, and worketh the cholericke Complexion, which is also hoat dry: as Saturne causeth the Melancholicke complexion which is colde dry.
This Mars is co~monly called the God of battayle, for that he styrreth vp mens myndes to debate and stryfe, and letteth the league of Tranquillity peace.
He is also called Mars, quasi mors, for that he is a heauy, hard, and deadly Planet: or for that hee procureth the death decay of many Inferior bodyes.
Ouid sayth that he was Sonne to Iuno, without Father, but conceyued of her through a certayne hearb which Flora on a time shewed vnto ber.
Sons to this Mars (as Volateranus saith) were first Oenomaus which raygned in Elys, which obtayned the Daughter of Pelops,
which was the swyftest Runner that euer was, had her to his wyfe, by out runninge her.
And by Meroe, Mars had also another Son called Parthaon: and a third called Oeneus king of Calidonia, of whom came Dianira, which was wife to Hercules, and Meleager, Tydeus, and Menalippus.
This Menalippus whilest hee in hunting the wylde Bore in a Woode earnestly followed his Game, was vnwares by euell hap slaine of his brother Tydeus, who afterwardes fled and came into Argos by night, and hap+pening into the court of Adrastus ye king, and katched in a grieuous Rayne sought further, and anon hit into a shelter where Polynices banished his countrey abode, was scanted, so that that roome would not serue them both, for the which cause they fell together by the Eares, and wounded ech other grieuously.
As Mars is paynted drawen forth hee resembleth a tall and lusty Stripling stan+di~g with open breast, and his feete stretched forth as though he stryded, noting there by that warres are to be atte~pted of hawty heartes, and to bee followed pursued
His colour is somewhat red, hys house or place of abode is in Aries Scorpio, his exaltation or ascende~t is in the
Such as are borne vnder Mars are cruell, dreadfull, despitefull, malicious, quickely moued and styrred vp to wrath and anger: theyr countenaunce and looke also is sowre, grim fearful.
Theyr colour for the most part is after a fiery red theyr hayre cole blacke, theyr face roundewise, theyr eies yellowish.
In conuersation and demeanure or maner of life they he im+pudent, and shameles, very aduentrous bold, hardy, hie minded, proude, crafty and subtill.
Wherevpon in token of such dispo+sitions that the Martialistes were so enclined vnto, they were wont in old time to set out Mars theyr gouernour like a souldyer hauing a sallet on his head, and in his lefte hand was put a Sword, and in his ryghte hand he had a Iauelin or speare, whereby was signified his daily practise and procurement towards wars and co~tention.
The stone which they vsed in time paste to engraue Mars in, was co~monly the Adamant stone, wherin they drewout a harnessed ma~ riding vpon an Aegle in whose righte ha~d
was a naked sword, and in his left hand a mans head which turned round about.
By this was vttered forth how mighty, swift, and fierce Mars is in battayle, so that hys power is a terrour to all the whole fielde.
Mars maketh those bodies ouer whome he hath preheminence hardy and aduenturous, and disposeth them by a certaine naturall inclination to aptnes and dexterity to the quicke and expedite obtayning of such artes and crafts as be manual or don by ha~d.
Mars likewise amongst such beasts as be brutish exceedingly, sauage or wild is altogether ruler.
Likewise amongst the~ that be fierce stomaked or warlik of which sort is the horse,
which was first found out by Neptunus, by him first made acquain+ted with men, after that, he was firste rode vpon by the Thessalonians of whom Xeno+phon reporteth as followeth, how we shal haue an vndoubted perfec trial of a good horse: Fyrst he requireth that he be broade brested,
which tendeth both to comelines importeth main great strength, besides yt, he shal so bewtout danger beneath in his feete of smiting one against another in trauailing which we cal co~mo~ly enterfering.
And secondly, his necke he would not haue hang downe prone, in manner of a boare, nor yet ye same to be too erect or strayt vp, in maner of a Cocke, but to be indifferent betwene both: his head hee would haue to be bony, his Iawbones small, and his eyes in his Iourneying bendinge downe to the beholding of his feete: for the holding out of his necke at length is a signe of wearines and weakenes in a horse, and bewrayeth a Iade.
It is also to be co~sidered whither his eyes be eyther hollowe and deepe within, or whether he be ful eyed and often fiery coloured in the same, which onely betokeneth great valiancy in a horse, as also that he is of exceeding sharpe eyesight: his Nosthrils also the more open they appeare and withall bending right downe, do both demonstrate great ease liberty of breathing in a horse, as also very great fiercenes: his eares must not bee longe, his Foretop somewhat longer then his Mane: his belly must be somwhat gaunt grayhou~dlike: his Loynes how much ye broader shorter they be, so much the more easy is his pace: and ye more that his buttockes be deuided parted with a broader strike, seame, or line
ryght downe toward his Tayle, the more swifter hee is in his runninge, his hinder feete getting an aduantage thereby of hys forefeete in euery step and pace: if a man will frame and make his horse fit for warlike exercises,
he hath (as Zenophon coun+celleth (to try Maisteries with him in this order: he must not spare to make him take hedge and dytches: yea, nor to leape ouer walles somtimes: he must often also exercise himselfe both to skip of, and to skip on at his pleasure: and to put him forth somewhiles right on, sometimes to reuert and turne him backwards, and somewhiles to ride him sidelong.
Somewhiles the Ryder is to bringe him out from his pryuate coursing at home or in ye fieldes, into thro~ged frequented places, that with ye sight, noyse, and hearing of so populous a multi+tude he may acquaint him selfe, through ye tractability of the Ryder to be fit and prepared for euery assay.
that their Markes of age weare away accordi~gly as they grow one in yeres: for when they become two yeares olde and an halfe, he sayth yt then their middle teeth both aboue and belowe doe fall away: and
when they bee foure yeares olde they cast those teeth of theirs which he called Canini, which bee sharp after Dogges teeth, haue new agayne by and by grow in their roome: and afterwards when they growe to be about sixe yeares old, their Wange teeth or great Grynders aboue fall away.
And when they bee seuen yeares olde they cast diuerse belowe, the remnant become all of a like sise, begin in the vpper parte to waxe hollow: after which time it is very hard to affirme truely ye age of any horse when they come to be ten yeares old their teeth then remayning are very hollowe, their Eyebrowes wax hoary oftentymes and some of their teeth sticke out: but of ye Horse wee haue spoken sufficient.
which being bent vpon his pray as he is in his way thitherward, he vseth al the while to smell out extremely in euery part of his body.
Plynie sayth) that in tymes past euen the very sight of wolfes in Italy was thought to presage or foreshewe no goodnesse to the Country.
And neuer bestoweth more time in conioyning with his mate then xii. dayes in the yeare.
Vnder the iurisdiction of Mars also is the Oxe of both fortes, aswell the wylde Oxe as the Tame.
These were first yoked and prepared to the vse of Husbandry in Italy, in so much that ye grecians through certayne contempt,
There are (as Aelianus sayth) some of this kinde in Mysia yt are without hornes.
In India there be Oxen so swift as that they will out run a Horse.
In Eubaea all their breede of Oxen are for the most parte white.
There be wilde Oxen in Aethyopia that moue their hornes to and fro, as our Oxen heere doe their Eares.
Columella sayth, that ye best labourers workmen (as they call them) of these, are chiefly bred about Hetruria, and Italy, which are well knit and stronge to laboure.
And the signes of good Oxen be these as hee sayth: a broade and curled forehead, rough and heary Eares, great black eyes, long hornes, broade wyde nostrells, a broade wreathed necke, a plenti full and softe hyde, a righte out and playne backe, great Hoofes, a long tayle, and of a red, browne, or blacke colour.
Vnder Mars is also the wilde Bul which (as Aelianus saith) be he neuer so curste, fierce or mad he is to be bridled.
If a man tyeth or byndeth his right testicle or stone with a lyne to one of his hornes.
The firste that is red to haue caused the Bul to haue bene bayted was Caesar the dictator.
Hetherto belongeth also the foming Boare, whose armory in fighte consisteth chyefely in his Tuskes: as also the cruell Beare which Aristotle calleth Animal omni vorum,
And yet is the female more wood and stronger then ye male of this kinde.
There is a kynde of whyte beares in Mysia so infectiue, as that they kyll the dogs put on them, euen only wyth theyr venemous breath.
The she beare perfiteth her yonge by little and little with her onely lycking, and hath young at three monethes end, at which time she creeping on her backe and sides, stealeth to some priuy den that shee chose before to that purpose, being very wary least he shoulde be spyde, and there continueth fourteene dayes lyckinge her younge.
Then shee goeth abroade for fleshe, and such lyke to sustaine them her withall.
to saue her younge she taketh some of the~ on her back, and some of the~ in her mouth and away she getteth her vp into the next Tree.
Amongest all such Fowles as fly vnto Mars belongeth the Griffron,
whych is bred in India and hath onely amongst al other fowles foure feete.
It is very bygge and mighty, and hath crooked nayles and clawes after the lyon: he is blacke on hys backe, purple coloured on his forepart, and white winged: his mouth is like the Eagles and his eyes fiery, very hard to bee taken, but onely when he is younge.
He maketh his Nest in the highe Mountaines, and encountreth with all kynde of beastes except onely the Lion and Elephant.
Likewise to Mars pertaineth the Puttock of al fowles the moste snatching.
The firste chasing of her was by Alphonsus the king of Neapolis, which put vp a Goshauke and a Faucon also of his at once after her in ye apre.
Also the Pye which euery day chatte reth eftsoones chaunging her note, whych was dedicated to Mars: Also such fowles as are fierce and earnest of pray, and be of shryll voice, as the Kistrell or Kastell, and the shricke owle,
in sted of songe, as also yt other owle which howleth in sted thereof.
Likewise the Lapwing which maketh her nest in desertes in marshes, and vpon mountaines, buildinge the same with mans dunge, to the entent yt if any man come nigh the same he may bee dryue~ backe by the stinke of the same.
And amonges serpents the Dragon holdeth on Mars which is of a very sharpe fiery eyesight:
which hath also three things in her ve+ry much desyred after (she is killed by ye Elephant which is alwayes at mortall stryfe with her, and she with him) That is to say her eyen, her skin, her teeth.
Her cies whe~ shee is slayn become precious stones called Draconites, and are like the fier: her skyn is very medecinable: and her teeth are like vnto Boares teeth, but that they be smaller and serue also for sundry and diuers remedies, Likewise the Cockatrice,
whych speedeth so wyth her enuenoming, that shee beinge in bignesse but as much as a mannes hande doth yet not wythstanding kill all other Serpentes wyth her onely infected poisonous breath.
And if any ma~ smite at her but with a sticke or staffe, shee speedeth him so with poyson as that he dyeth
Amonge fishes proper to Mars is Cephalus whych breedeth onely in Ionium an Iland, and liue moste vpon mud.
So is the woolfish a great destroyer· which euer swimmeth alone.
So is the Mullet fish which is called Trygle whych breedeth but onely three times in the yere: Of al fishes in the sea a great deuourer, lyueth much by the fome or froth of the sea and by the dead bodies and carcasses of me~, and such other thinges.
Among plantes herbes are pertinent also to Mars, Lingwort, Radish, Onions, Scammony, who roote is of a stronge smell, and his lease is three cornered.
helpeth to make water, yet hurtful to the eyes and raines.
So is garlicke which (as Galen saith) is good to gieue such as haue abundance of flegme It being stampt with salt and rue,
or herb grace, and receiued, doth remedy the byting of mad dogs: or els layde plaster wyse to the sore place is therefore likewise effectuall.
In Aegypte there is a kynde of Garlicke which hath but one onely heade,
and without cloue as our onions here are, which head is also red, sweete and small.
So is also Rue, Turnepps, longe rape in subiection to Mars.
And all such as haue their stinge or be pryckely or the manner of a dart, hurting, byting and festring with the onely touching of them, as the Thistle, Nettle, Quick thorne, and such like.
which is so sayd for that he is inuincible and not to be brought vnder wich any force to be made plya~t to any vse of the Lapidary, but onely with Goates blond very warmely applyed vnto it.
So is also the Lodestone which as The ophraste sayth, is of a siluer colour.
It is digged out of ye ground in Syphnus which is aboute three furlonges of from the red sea.
This stone draweth Iron to it wheresoeuer it be placed, whether on hye or belowe.
So is also the touchstone which is of no great quantity and is found in the greate ryuer Tmolus in Armenia.
The property of this is to try the fynes of gold and liluer.
So is the Pomesstone also which commeth of a kinde of fome in the sea hardened and caste
So is the Sanguinary and a certaine kinde of Ametiste.
Amongst Mettals he possesseth and hath rule in Iro~ of which Plinie saith that it will consume anone and rust away if it bee once put into the fyre,
be not already hardened a good with laborous strokes and wel wroughte.
There is also force of medcine in Iron as it may be vsed: his property is to bind, dry vp and staunche.
It staucheth bloude, and helpeth other excrements and is good for the gowt.
So hath he also the redder brasse and all other thinges mettal like, whych haue most store of the Brimstone in them.
His sauours are al such as be bitter, sharp and such as burne and bite the tongue, and which make a man to weepe.
Amonge the Elementes he hath most right to the fire.
His prouinces dominions are first as he is ioyned with Aries Brittany, Fraunce Germany, Barstany, the lower most countrey of Syria, Idumed and Iudea or Ievvry And as hee is partaker with Scorpio hee holdeth the hyer Syria, Cappadocia, Manritania, Getulia.
He runneth his course about the zodiacke in twoo yeres.
NExt in place aboue Mars is Iupiter, which te~pereth allaieth ye malice of Mars sinister conditions of Saturne.
For this Iupiter is in his qualities very te~perrate (yt is to say) hoate moyste, causing heate moysture.
Wherupon he is sayd to be ye father worker of ye Sanguine Complexion.
For it is proper to bloude to bee hoate and moyst.
Hereupon for such benefite wrought by him, he hath often ben called the Originall Lyfe Planet.
And they were wont to draw him forth in the Royal likenesse of a Kyng, holding a Scepter or golden Mace in his hande: gieuinge to vnderstande thereby his rule and Empyre ouer all Creatures lyuing.
The Poets affirme him to bee Sonne to Saturnus, and Rhea, which Saturne vnderstandinge by a Prophesie that it should come to passe that his owne Sonnes should thrust him out of his Kingdome, prouided with him selfe to
slea them all as soone as euer they shoulde be borne.
So hee began to deale heerein, firste wyth Ceres; then with Neptunus whom he had by the aforesayd Rhea.
Who when she perceiued his purpose herein, be+ing great with childe of Iupiter and deliuered of him, sent him forthwith very priuily into Lycton a place of Creet, where he was hidden in a Denne: and when Saturne came to haue deuoured him also, she cast him a stone in steede of her childe.
Then Iupiter in processe of yeares growing both into mighte and wealth, expelled his Father, deliuered his other Brethren from such Thraldome.
The Stone which Saturne catched in his mouth thinking it to haue bene his owne Chylde, was deceyued therein, and hee euomitinge the same, is yet a Monument still remayning to bee seene at this day vpon the high Hill Parnassus.
This Iupiter by Proserpina had Bacchus, who was called the God of Wynes.
And by Alcumena hee had Hercules, who by Augaea Daughter to Aleus Kinge of Arcady had Telephus, which was hid in a wood and nourished vp of a Hart.
This Iupiter by Iuno had Vulcanus which for his deformity and ill fauorednesse was of them both into the Iland Lem+nus, whereas he should make lightninges for Iupiter: which Vulcanus asceuding vp+on high, and couetinge to see the Palace of his Father, going vp higher then he was able to hold on continue forth, fell downe and brake hys Lymves whereby he halted euer after.
So had Iuditer by Minerua (whom he forced or rauished) another Sonne called Ericthonius, which was the first that inuented and founde oute Carting: of whom Virgil sayth thus: Primus Ericthonius currus quatuor ausus jungere equos. and may be Englyshed thus.
The first that Cart and horses droue, and drawing did Was Erycthon, who Ioyned them in Teame for that intent.
THis Erycthonius had one Pandio to his Sonne which was Kinge of Athens, who had two Daughters one casted Progne and the other Philomena:
the first was maried to Tereus Kynge of Thracia, who being on a time in his sister Philonaes company, and entising her aside as he though good, forced her agaynst her will and to ye intent this matter should not be knowen he cut out her tou~ge: which thing neuerthelesse comming to his wiues Eare, and she takinge greate displeasure the neat, against his returne and comming home she his beloued Sonne Ithys, and dressed him in Meates Banketwise, so set the same before him: whereof he vnawares of his Sonne, yea of his best beloued sonne did feede hungerly.
At which so great wickednesses perpetrated on euery side, Iupiter being highly offended did first chaunge the man into a Lapwing, Progne his wife he chaunged into a swallowe: and Philomena into a Nightingale.
Of Iupiter also and Taygeta Daughter to Agenor came Lacedemon, who built the City Lacedemonia: of him also came Orion which was a valiaunt champion to Diana,
Giantlike, and of yt arrogancy withall, that he boasted craked that he would slea all kindes of beastes others, and yet
to see, he being but stinge of a Scorpion, serpent of no great hignes, dyed presently.
And the same Orion being now transla+ted and set vp for a signe in heauen by Iupi+ter, doth at this day whe~soeuer he sheweth forth to saylers and shipmen prognostycate vnto them litle good to sue.
Iupiter also by Europa had Mynos, which raygned in Creta, and who had first the rule ouer the Cyclade Ilandes:
he first scoured ye Sea of Pyrates, which in that time abounded sore.
This Mynos settinge before him the vertuous and commendable lyfe of Rhada manthus a most iust Kynge, to shewe that he likewise would doe nothinge in Iudgement amisse, is sayd to goe and often into a deepe Den at Gnosus an Ilande of the Cyclades, where he receyued wholsome lawes at his Father Iupiters owne hands.
which raygned in the Ilande Oenon, which afterwards he called Aegina after his mothers name: where wisen as all men died generally of a certayne extreame contagion or pestilence, insomuch that there was not one man left alius, this Aeacus desired prayed his father instant+ly, that he would turne ye Antes or Emets
which hee sawe there into men: which Request being graunted, he afterwardes called them Myrmidone: this Aeacus hath ye third place accoumpt among ye most righteous Iudges.
So another son of Iupiter was Aeolus, which raygned in Sicilia,
and was lord ouer ye Ilands called Aeoliae: this Aeolus is called the God of Winds, which is also said to haue first taught instructed the Maryners seafaringe men to knowe and vnderstand the signes tokens of tempests ensuing, as also the disposition nature of ye winds: this Aeolus begot who raygned at Ephora, which as is said,
being made priuy of the secrecy cou~sel of the Gods, playd the parte of a Blab bewrayed the same vnto men, whereat they taking great indignation to punishe hym therefore perpetually, haue set him in hell to rowle astone asmuch as euer he ca~ wag or moue with al the endeuor he hath, the same most laborious busines of his neuer to ecase.
So was also Tantalus son to Iupiter, which raygned in Phrigia,
who calling the Gods on a time to a feast or banquet yt he had prepared for them, he in the same, hauing slaine his son Pelops, dressed and sod him piecemeale serued him in so
for an especiall seruice: and this hee did to tempt and try their curtesies: at which filthy fact they being highly displeased, first restored Pelops agayne to lyfe, ioyned together agayne his pieces or seuered members, sauing that his shoulders they could not restore, for that Ceres had eaten it vp: therefore in steade of the same they made him one of and Tantalus they threwe downe into Hell, appoynted him an especial place of torme~t for euer, whereas he standing vpright in Floudes and waters vp to the Chin and aboue and hauing there plesaunte Apples hanginge ouer his head reaching downe to his vpper Lippe, striueth continually to catche of them into his mouth, to sustayne and relieue hys extreme hunger, is yet neuer able to come by one byte of them, Vlysses also is sayde to discend come of Iupiter, vaunting him selfe therein: and reckening vp his nobility Progeny so against Aiax, He to keepe him selfe safe at home, and not to goe with the Grecian Army to lay siege to Troye, craftely deuised with himselfe to faine him selfe mad:
and to vtter forth some shewe thereof, he went and sue salt, and went and
ioyned together at Plough, hee cared not what crosse kyndes of Cattell, and all to make the Greekes belieue yt he was stark mad: but deepe dissemblinge doth by one meanes or other euer brust forth, as in this matter: for Pallamedes by and by bewrayed the same, who layde his sonne Telemachus in his way as hee should come wt his Ploughe, to see whither he were in deede as hee pretended: but hee percyuing anon his sonne to lye in his way shunned and eschued such a daunger, and so disclosed his owne counterfayting.
But wee are nowe to returne agayne to the History of Iupiter from which by occasion we haue a litle and yet not very much declined.
The auncient Gentils were wont to depicture hym oute in likenesse of a Bull, for that as the Poets write,
when as he rauished Europa daughter to Agenae King of Phenicia hee transformed him selfe into the likenes of a Bull.
Some also vsed to call him Danaés for that he broke in by the roofe or top of ye house vnto Danáe, Daughter to Acrysius king of ye Argyues, who was close shut vp and locked fast in a strong towre, hee appearing for al yt so vnto her in likenes of a
showre of golden Rayne forced her, and begat on her Perseus, who was hee that first gaue name to the Country and kingdome of Persia.
See herein what assaultes and what meanes inordinate Loue assayeth in oppugning of chastity.
The Panims gaue this Iupiter soueraygnty in all things: and to purchase obtaine through his meanes as they sinisterly thought therein, helpe, remedy in their calamities and distresses: they ioyned with his proper name another as it were a surname, accordingely as the wayght and nececessity of their cause driue them vnto: as for example, when they were preiudiced by any man of ye house, or by any guest,
When kinsfolke and Kinsmen fell to contention, and were together by ye Eares among themselues,
to Iupiter Homoginus: When those which had taken truce with others, or which were in league brake Truce, and deceyued ech other,
And the same star of his is somewhat after a siluer colour.
His house is in Sagitarius Pisces: his Exaltacion or ascending is in the
Such as are vnder the gouernment of Iupiter are outwardely of merry Countenance, and of comely seemely behauiour gesture: they be also louers of clenlinesse, such as be fayre speached.
Their colour is commonly white, yet stayned here there with some red among: their body is well set and proportioned, and their stature and height is indefferent: they be also of thyn haire, of great eyes, and the pupill or ball of their eye exceedeth and is after a black: they bee moreouer of shorte Nose, curled Bearde, and their fore teeth are great and long.
And inwardly concerning the frame or qualities of their minde, they be studuous, quiet, well affected towards all me~, but their loue is sodaynely got quickly lost againe.
Moreouer as co~cerning world+ly benefits Iupiter aduanceth his to great Prosperity, good successe, much Riches, high Honoure, and getteth them Fauour and friendship in the Worlde, and preserueth them fro ye assaults of their enemies.
Amonge bruite beastes all such kynds are his whych in pryde of stomacke, contende and striue one with another for and concerning the prerogatiue of their kynde: as the Elephant and Dragon betweene whome there is continuall and deadly discorde as they that trauaile the wildernesses of Affrica,
For ye Dragon and the Elephant in their meeting purpose the death and destruction of ech other.
And in theyr first sighte they malice one anothers being.
In so much that ye serpent twyning about the other with the greate length of his body and tayle styngeth him round aboute, at which deadely strokes, the other extreamely payned doth fall downe to the ground presently, with ye waight or force of which fall he both killeth himselfe or at leaste wise hurteth hymselfe very grieuously, and is thereby in dau~ger of dying himselfe, as also he presently kylleth the Dragon which is so wounde and twynde aboute his body, and crusheth hym all to pieces.
So is the Tyger also subiecte to Iupiter in that respecte that he likewise beareth a naturall grudge and most mortall malice to the Horse.
This kinde is bred most often in Hyrcania and India, a wylde beast of maruallous swiftenes in running, as also terrible with all in the same.
And the smel of ye females of this kynde is also exceding wo~derfull: For so often as shee being forth at purueying for her younge, and for her owne pray (for the Male kynd thereof doth neuer a whit regard either her or her yong all this whyle) and in the meane time (as it cannot otherwise be) it falleth so forth as that if she be robbed of any of her whelpes at her returne home againe to her Den, when she perceiueth that she hath lost any of her littour; she goeth forth out of her de~ by and by, and smelleth about which wais these should be taken, and after shee pursueth that waies hastely.
And to auoyde the daunger of her which is but present death the partye that hath robbed her, being on horsebacke (for one foote he may not be, for he wil then be quickly ouertaken of her) turning one of them downe, must yet make away as fast as euer he can, and not stay til he be got on the other syde of some greate Water, vnto whych place shee can not
approach, and she in this time makyng after, at the finding of that one so caste in her way, seemeth to be so glad thereof, as that she prese~tly returneth again with al home and there hauing bestowed ye same, taketh againe after the other that she misseth, and neuer staying till shee come at the Water where the robber in passing through escaped her fury and reuenge, shee standeth at the brym or bankes of the same and roreth out very straungely.
which is also a heauy and sore enemy to the Elephant, whych with her one horne whetted and filed vpon some flinte, prepareth her selfe to encou~ter with him.
And alwayes in her fighte shee striueth and laboureth very busily to pushe at the belly of ye Elephant, which she knoweth to be the most tender place.
And as con+cerning fowles all such kyndes be hys, as are of tender and softe meate, and of moste temperate bodies, As is the Pheasaunt, ye Partriche,
which was sometimes dedicated to Iupiter and Latona: Of all fowles ye most lecherous: For the cocke Partrirhe doth often destroy his mates nest and all ye Egges in the same, and letteth her of sytting,
to the intent, shee should serue him at his lyste in the acte of Venery.
There is also great wylinesse in in the olde Partryches, for a man shall see them at such time as any Fawkener or other approacheth nighe vnto their Nest or place where their younge (not yet rype ynough in flight) be contayned and kept togeather, the olde Partryches as it were yeelding themselues to ye Fawkener suffering him to come nigh vpon him, to ye inte~t yt by such pollicy they may auert turne away ye parties far of from happening or chauncing vpon their younge, which they knowe are yet insufficent vnable to shift and prouide for themselues.
So is ye Doue in subiection to Iupiter, whose kindnes to eche other as they bee matched or Mated together, (as it were in a certaine forme of Wedlocke) euery dayes experience doth teache vs.
They assist busily and help one another carefully in sitting: They breede onely two Egs for the most parte, first the Male, secondely the Female.
There is no fowle more profitable, or that breedeth oftner.
For euery springe, sommer and Autumnes Monethes (sauing the moneth of Iune onely excepted, whych is commonly called Carlocke moneth at which time they be most vnapte and least myndfull of generation) they misse not in a maner so to encrease in breeding.
They do lightly return and repayre home agayne (how far soeuer now then notwithstanding they wa~der fly) vnto theyr accustomed breeding places.
As experience hereof was tried at the siege of Mutina,
whereas Brutus catching one of them (which vsed and kept about ye castell) a good way of, wheras then ye chiefest of the Romayne armie lay, afore he let her goe: he wrot an Epistle to them, fastning the same about her feet, after she was let goe, she made haste home againe to the sayd castle her old abyding place, withal by this straunge meanes and message, the other were made priuy of Brutus his purpose, successe and Affayres.
Vnder Iupiter also are the Plouer, ye Quaile, the Larke, the hen, the Capon.
Amonge fishes hee chale~geth great a do in ye Dolphin called Phi+liotechnos for yt she loueth her youg dearely.
and breastes and geueth her younge sucke with the same.
As their younge beginne to learne to swim, they set them in a ranck or rowe one afore another, and the elder Dolphins aswell hee as shee, to keepe them in theyr ray or order, do swym by them on ech side, the other on ye other side: But as her younge waxe great, this ranke is broken.
This kinde bryngeth forth no spawne but a younge fish at the first, gieueth her younge mylke.
The Indian Sea is full of these which are in quantity and bignes fiue times as big againe as the Dolphin.
Ouer Trees hee ruleth ouer ye Popular tree, the Oke, the wyllow tree, ye beeche, ye Darnascen tree, ye Pare Ipple trees.
Likewise he requireth the fruite of the Almond tree Date tree: and amonge sweete leaues and rootes Mirabolanum, Rheubarbaru~, Cassia.
Among herbes he hath Mynt, Iupiters beard Sage, Time, He~locke, Helica~pane.
Amonge gems or precious stones he retaineth the Iacinct, the Berill, the Saphy, the Turkys, the Emerald, ye more dusky kind of Iasper, and all other sortes whych declyne
Among Gemmes or Precious stones hee retayneth the Iacinct, the Berill, the Saphir, the Turkys, the Emeralde, the more dusky kinde of Iasper, and all other sortes which declyne towardes a dusky or darke colour.
which (as Plynie sayth) being ouer layde on such vessels as are of Brasse, maketh them sauour more sweetely, preserueth them from rusting.
All wholsome moysture also proceedeth from him, which cause good increase or nourishment in the body.
And as concerning the Elements he ruleth dealeth as him lysteth in ye Ayre.
he is lord (as he is ioyned wt Sagittarius ouer Tuscia, Celtica, Spayne, and the higher parte of Arabia.
And as he partaketh wt Pisces, hee holdeth Lycia, Lydia, Cylicia, Pamphylia, Paphlagonia, Nasomania, and Garamantye, or Caramantica.
Hee runneth ouer the Zodiacke, endeth his course therein, in xii. yeares.
SATVRNE is a Planet cold and dry, masculine, malicious and hurtfull in many such Effectes as hee worketh: for when he Raygneth, lyghtlye those that bee borne vnder him, either dye shortely, liuinge no longe time to accou~pt of, or els if they liue any long time, they haue for the most part an heauy and hard fortune.
Therevpon for this his pernitious condition of hurting destroying, hee was wont to be set out as a Mower or Haruest man, hauing and holding a Sythe or Sickle in his hand, as one which by his owne will was fully bent and geuen to accelerate hasten the ruine and decay of all liuing things; and were it not but that Iupiter placed betwixt him vs, did temperate bridle him much in his aforesayd heauy qualities, and condicions: nothing here beneath almost coulde eyther
Wherin we haue to consider the vnspeakable and wonderfull wisedome of the almighty that as in all other thinges, so in this hee hath most especially and wisely prouided: that, ye enemy of life so ernestly labouring ye death and decay of all thinges, shoulde haue hys place appoynted him there so far of from the earth, where all creatures lyuing make their abode, that of all other Planettes he the cruellest should be most remote furthest of.
For how should any creature lyuing sustain, help, and defend it self against the force of such extreame cruelty: If thys mortall enemy of all were bestowed placed any thinge nighe: yea, or any nearer then he is now, to the earth here below, the place of our aboade: yea and how shoulde any thynge continue oute his appoynted and determinate Time, if this fearse and furious haruestman as it were, euery day labouring to downe with all, were not let and hyndered by other more friendly gra+cious powers, staying him from such hys force.
See therefore ye truth of holy writ, and how truely it is there sayde, God the perfecte wisedome hath disposed all
It is not therefore for his owne worthinesse or dignity that Saturne hath ye highest place amonge ye other Planets, for his deserts deserued: but rather the contrary, vpo~ other effects occasion: as that all things liuing might by that meanes be the further of from so frowning, froward, and fatall Foe.
He is of a pale and wan colour, and disposeth to ye Melancholicke co~plexion.
This Saturne (as the Poets imagine) was some to Coelus, and Vesta,
as also father to Iupiter, Iuno, Pluto, Neptunus, Ceres, Chiro~, Picus.
Of Iupiter we haue sayd befor: Iuno was both sister,
The ge~tilishe women were wont very superstitiously to call vpon her in their time of trauaile labour of childe, by ye name of Iuno Lucina.
This Iuno had to her Daughter, Hebe a lusty gallant, whom Iuno made af+terwards Cupbearer to Iupiter,
beinge very wanton on a time, forgetfull of womanly modesty, shamefastnesse in a fall yt she had, vncouered her Secrecy, which so offended Iupiter, Iuno, that she being by and by displaced, turned out of her office.
And Neptunus another son of Saturnus, and Ops they make the God of the Sea: And Ceres they make the God of Corne,
And Chiron the Ce~taure they say was Saturnus his son also by Phylira a Nymphe, which Chiron became halfe a man, and halfe a horfe, who was brought vp in a den, and there he was taught and learned the arte of medecynes and the vertue of herbes: as also he practised harpe musicke.
And Picus the last rehearsed sonne of Saturne begat Faunus.
Ouid should seeme to make this Picus ye husband to Circes,
whom by another name he calleth Martius: who saieth hee falling in loue with Pompona, and vsing her company greately, thys Cyrces his wife gelous ouer hym as shee transposed by incantation diuerse other thynges so ofte as shee lysted, so for anger and reuenge of this matter shee tourned her husband Picus into a byrd of that name, whych wee commonly with vs vse to call a Pye.
The star of thys Saturn{us} in greeke is called Kronos which importeth an infinite or vnspeakable time.
This time therefore which measureth the length of our lyues is called of some ye yard Wande or Meterod of all wordly doinges and affayres: Wherefore the Dayes, the Howres, the Nights, the Monethes, the Yeares:
all these are the Horses that draw tyme forwarde, and continue time in hys course.
The Howres being spente euen by litle, lytle, doe yet helpe forwarde tyme apace.
Euery howre of the Day though of it selfe supposed but a short time, is notwythstanding to bee employed to some profitable vse or exercyse, that wee may say wee haue bestowed not so much as one howre vnfruitefully.
As in tymes paste our auncyent Elders consydering the losse of tyme, euen of an Howre: did therefore regarde howe they spente euery Howre most carefully and busily.
Martialis saith, that the Romaynes assigned to euery houre of the day aseuerall kynde of exercyse.
and to prayer: the seconde to salutation by bidding god morrowe, and vsing other friendly conference: the thyrde and fourth they addicted to the hearing and pleadyng of common wealth matters, the fyfth to bodily exercyses
and laboures: the sixt seuenth to take their former repast and ease: the eight they applyed to fence play, trying of Masteries, and martial affayres: and after this the reresidue of ye day in his assigned howres was employed to the inuention or finding forth of such profitable artes or wayes, as which furthered and enryched both the state of ye as also the case and condicion of euery priuate person.
But the dayes accoumpt is not a like in all places countryes: for some recken it to bee a day from sunne rising to sunne rising, as the Babylonians: some from Sun set to Sunset, as the Athenians: some from noone to noone, as the Vmbrians: some from the Sun rising to the Sun set, as the co~mon People here with vs: some fro~ Midnight to Midnight, as ye Aegyptians: and ye Dyall which declareth in ye cleare su~ny day howe euery houre escapeth passeth away fro~ vs, was first founde out by Anaximenes,
Scholler to Anaximander, who was the firste that shewed the Experience thereof in Lacedemonia: and Papyrius was ye first lykewise that broughte the same into Rome: but enough
Some are in yt opinion, that this Planet Saturnus is so called, quasise saturaret annis, for that in his course or circuit going, hee hath yeares and time fully.
His house is in Capricornus, and Aquarius: And his Exaltation or Ascendent is in the
are lumpish, heauy, and sad, dull witted, full of Melancholy, hard straunge, a long time to receiue vnderstandinge and learninge, but yet after they haue once with much a doe apprehended and taken the same, they after become fast Keepers and Retayners thereof: whereupon there is this difference betwixt the Mercurialysts and these, that as the first doe quickly and redely receiue and take, that whych is red and delyuered vnto them, but are on the other side soone forgetfull.
So the Saturnysts are commonly hard to learne, but sure in that which they haue once obtayned.
As that Seale doth better Imprinte and keepe his Marke which Sealeth in Waxe, and so forth: then that
which is bestowed vpon Water, which soone receiueth the marke thereof, soone leeseth the same.
The greatest desire of the Saturnistes also, is for the most part to addresse them selues to become sole or solitary in theyr life,
and to allow of the religious estate or condition chyefly.
Their Phisiognomy is altogether blockish, their cou~tenaunce cruell and stronge, theyr head ha~ging downe, theyr eyes euer bent and caste vpon the ground.
Theyr property is such yt they be euer almost either musing or murmuring with the~selues.
And in their sleepe they are much troubled: For they dreame oftentimes that they be buried aliue put into the earth quycke, or else they dreame of deade men, thynke they see such sights which make them astonished, and to cry out in theyr sleepe, as when they dreame of deuils which they do often, and of hel, and hel fier, and of cruell persecution and tyrannye and such like.
All which and far many moe horible cogitations, do often assault ye melancholike co~plexioned men.
The outward notes and signes of these men be, they bee for the most part of a browne colour, hard, heary rough skynned.
warped or wrynkled much: theyr vaynes greatly distented and puffed vp: they are al+so of hye browes thicke lyppes.
And as co~cerning the disposition of theyr minde, they be naturally gieuen to deceipte, to seduce to bryng the simple people into false belief: to feare and fray, and oftentimes to murther and flea: to consume and pine away within themselues through wrath, ire and cancred malice: They are also very ready and prone to ciuill dissention and discorde.
They be also for the most part shorte lifed, because the exceeding cold in the~ is a short+ner of their Dayes, as we see it cometh to passe in old men, which through coldnes of nature are chopte vp of a sodaine: for olde me~ as they grow on towards death becom very colde and dry, all heate and moysture wyhch are the preseruatiues of Lyfe then forsakyng them and bidding them farewel.
Whereupon it followeth, that these qualyties of Saturnus, that is colde and drynesse are the very hie wayes, Messengers, Har+bengours of death, and ennemies vnto life.
Whereupon thys kinde of complexyoned men can not endure longe, which lacke the mayntenaunce and nurserye of the vittayse
because that being withoute hope of good sucesse: in such thynges as they desire, whych are lightely difficulte: they doe descende into a certayns kinde of desperation thereof,
And they also are gieuen to bee sodainely moued and angred, as was Clynias of Athens, And Achilles, which both, to helpe themselues of this sore and sickenes: vsed, before they would either eate or drink to expell and banish from the~ this inward ennemy of theyr soule or mynde, with gyeuyng theyr endeuours wholy to some kind of musicke.
And solitarynes is a great part of their desire, and the pryuate kind of life: as Experience gaue forth in the Dayes of Diocletianus and Maximinianus Noble Prynces or Emperours:
which forsakying theyr royall roomes and publique, pryncely preheminence: for to obtayne a quyetnes of lyfe, which they hoped to haue in exempting themselues fro~ worldly affaires, gaue ouer all.
So dyd Amurathes the Turke, and Otomanus the Father of Mahomet, whych won Constantinople, resigning vnto
and many Venetian Lordes and Dukes, So did Ierome, Petrus Diamanus, Celestinus,
forsaking the world, they betoke the~ selues to solitarynes of life.
For by that meanes they imagined that they shoulde ye more easely come to the quiet porte or Hauen of science and speculation.
for solitarines of lyfe, but not to a like ende: for the other for desyre onely of knowledge in heauenly thinges separated themselues from the society of men, but this other through a way wardnes and crokednes of nature, abhorred and shunned all me~s companies.
Therfore in the field Atticus he got him a Den and was gladdest when he was furthest of from the sight of al men.
Insomuch that on a time a very friende of his called Peantus brynging with him great prouision purpo+sing to make merry with this Timon,
and iesting with him, and questioning how hee fared, and how hee liked of that Mary very well (quoth he) but shoulde fare and like better if Pea~tus were away.
Then the which speach, what coulde haue bene more hoggishly or swynishly:
Such another was Heraclitus ye Ephesian which misliking mens company dwelled in caues of the earth, and in Mountaynes and mandred in Wildernesses, lyued with Rootes, Herbes Water.
Such another also was Diogenes, who for his doggish conditions was called a Cynicke,
hee abode alone in Cranium without Corynthe, harboured in a Tunne in steade of a house.
In like so~rt did Theon Arsentus, but these two chose out solitarye places to auoid much corruption of lyfe,
But of these solitary persons, Melancholicke men, and very Saturnistes: we haue per aduenture said sufficiently, more then inough.
We are nowe to reuerte to the other effectes of Saturne seene and experyenced, in the Inferiour baser kyndes of Creatures.
And to come nexte vnto bruite beastes, all such kynds be proper vnto hym whych bee of lumpishe sluggyshe Nature, and slowe to dryue: As the Asse whych chyefely breedeth in Arcady, and nowe also aboute Reate in Italy: as also in Betica and throughoute
With ye Mylke of the she Asses, as Tranquillus re+porteth Poppea, Neroes Wyfe made her skin very cleare and fayre: yet in Mauritania in the forrests there are wield Asses called Onagri so swyft in ru~ning that they cannot bee catcht vntill they haue runned themselues out of breath.
Hetherto also belongeth the Mule which breedeth in India through the coniunction of ye wilde asse and Mare.
These be most what of browne colour, and very swift.
In ye Monuments of the Athenians it is remembred that one of these lyued foure score yeares.
The first sorte hath two Kybes on his Backe, and this last hath but one.
And as they haue such like vpon their breastes, vpon which they rest and stay theyr Bodies so often as they lye downe.
The Females haue foure Teates euen as our Kyne here haue, and their Tayle is like to ye Asses tayle.

And ye hill Mou~t Hares are ye greatest lesse swift.
The experience of their swiftnes sheweth forth in then forefeete, which the lesser smaller they be so much ye more do they exceede and excell in their pace.
In theyr coursing they apply their eares fast flat to their backes.

But he matcheth her shift with subtilty flynes: For in ye midst of ye course he giueth her ouer and resteth himselfe,

The age of Hares is well coniectured by certayn sundry poares or holes that they vse to haue in their bodies as they begin to waxe olde.
Among serpents Saturn possesset those that bee of most deadly Venome,
which as S. Ierome in his Epistles sayth, is so full of poyson yt when she goeth any where to drinke, she is fayne to lay aside her poison till she returneth againe, for feare of brusting.
So is the serpent Ichneumon which is continually at hatred with the Aspe,
and laboureth dayly to finde out the Aspes Nest to destroye her Egges, whereby shee knoweth howe greatly she hindreth the Succession or encrease of her deadly Ennemies.
Amonge fowles hee chalengeth the Estriche which feedeth oftentimes vpon Iron: also ye Pellicane which lyueth solitarely in ye Wildernesse,
which resorteth much to the Sea costes there catching shelfishes, after she hath deuoured them she per braketh them vp agayne to the entent shee may the more easly breake their Shelles come by the meate.
The Swan also solitary in her life, and merry at her death,
so reioysinge in hope to be shortly with her beloued Apollo, (as sayth Plato seemeth also to be one of this number.
Amonge Trees Saturne holdeth the Mulbery tree which is longe ere it waxeth olde,
the wisest tree of all, for that hee last of all others putteth forth his Buds blossomes.
whose lease is like the Fyrtree, and whose Barke is like the Cedar: If any Catrell bite of the rootes of the Ewe tree they die presently.
Among hear vs he holdeth Satry, which hath almost ye taste of Time.
And Heniwcke, with which, with fleshe intermedled together, Hunters in diuerse places destroy and kit Wolues.
And Rhododaphne, which beinge taken inwardly poysoneth, and vsed onely outwardely is sufferayne in many Medicines.
Amonge precious stones Saturne hath the stone called Sarcophagus which beinge put to the bodies of dead men and suffred to continue so but the space of fourty dayes,
it eateth vp all the whole Carkase, leauing nothing but the teeth onely.
It shoulde seeme that there bee at this present in Lycia some of these kindes of stones, which being fastened to them that bee alyue, doe awe and consume away their fleshe.
which is found in Persia, and is a perpetuall preseruer of the bodies of men whether they be aliue or
In such a stone was the body of Darius the king of Persia sapped and layed at his funerall, and buriall: which kept hys body safe from consuming away many hudred yeares.
Heatherto also belongeth the Chalazy which is both of the colour, and figure of hayle.
And is the hardnes, of the Adamant: This being put neuer so ofte~ or long in the fier, waxeth neuer the warmer or whotter, but continueth still as colde as yse. Subiect also to Saturnus is the stone Galactites which is of a milkie coloure:
this being beate into, powder and mixt wt water, and so apped to the nosthrilles of sheepe fetcheth their mylke agayne after it is dryed vp.
This being stant or beaten into Powder and intermedled with oyle, and so layd vpo~ any part or place of the body which is become bare or balde, doth helpe in very shorte time to fetch the hayre againe.
S. is the Galazite that delyuereth from the Ague: Also amonge Mettals Saturne hath a do with Ledde which is of two kinds that is to say white ledde blacke:
one of them wil not be adglutina+ted or ioyned to any other thinge, without
Wherefore when they soder any thinges both these do concur together thereto.
In Medicines ye vse of Lead is great: for it helpeth to represse maimes, or scars, and being applied to the Loynes and nigh vnto the Kidneyes in thynne Plates, or Leafes, with his exceeding coldnes it prohibiteth (as Plynie saith) the burning desire and immoderate lust of Venus.
burninge greatly in ye desire of Lust and fleshly Concupiscence, asswage and represse the rage of his intemperate desire.
And being vsed also in such order as after thinne beaten Plates or Leafe wyse, and put next the Breast it cleareth the same exceedingly, and maketh it more apt to singe out clearely.
And so did Nero vse to doe to make his Voyce and Breast pleasaunt.
Amonge the Elementes Saturne hath most a doe with the Earth whose Qualities are also after the maner of Saturnus, that is most colde and drye:
which Earth the Phylosophers not wythoute greate cause called the Nourse or Graunde Mother of all Lyuinge thinges here with vs,
for that she conceyued and brought forth so many distinct and diuers kindes of things as make nowe to the enriching and beautifying of the whole Worlde.
And as the Earth serueth to bring forth such variety of fruites and prouision, as wherewithall al thinges lyuing are richly sustayned: so doe all other things in ye Worlde by Gods speciall apoyntment serue to the commodity and vse of Mankinde, whom God hath made Lord and maister of all.
So that the Fyre (as saith Lactantius which serueth to heate and to geue light:
the Fou~taynes which out of the Earth and sides of hylles gieue forth water: the floudes which water our grounds: ye Hilles that bring forth Vynes other deliciouse kindes of fruite: the Fennes, and Marishes, which bringe forth Reede Sedge: the sea which both storeth vs with variety of Fishes, as also serueth to the passage of Marchauntmen, and marchaundize: the Suu which altreth and chaungeth the times and seasons of ye yeare: the Moone who is a Guide and gouernour in the darke night, and also a Distinguisher of the yeare into seuerall Moneths: the starres which serue greatly to
the trauayling of the sea faringe men: the windes which preserueth the Ayre fro~ corruption: all these, as all thinges els which the Earth produceth of her self any wayes beneficially (which are Infinite) serue all to the commodity, behofe, and vse of Man.
And yet is not ye Earth (albeit it is so richly furnished and great withall and vnmouable) any wayes as big in quantity,
as is the least star in the firmament, if ye Astrologians be to be credited, for they say that the Earth is eighteene times lesse then ye least star there.
To the deeper consideracion whereof (because this thing can hardly sinke in our senses) we are to vndersta~d that after the mindes of Ptholomeus, Alphraganus, others expert Astronomers.
The stars of the firmament are distinguished into sixe sundry differences or degrees of Magnitude greatnes.
In the first degree of quantity or bignesse there are
in number whereof euery one is bigger then the whole Earth
in number, whereof euery one is bigger then ye earth
Of the fourth syse are and all of them greater then the Earth by
stars, and euery one of them greater then the Earth
And all these are the least that are seene and haue bene diligently obserued marked of the Astrologians: Whereupon Alphraganus concludeth that the least star which we see is a great way bigger then ye whole earth.
miserable men therefore that make so much of a Moate, of a Center, or Poynte, of a Pryson: all which names ye earth hath in respecte of the higher Heauens, and to care so litle for the Possession of Heauen, where as is no circumscription of Place, nor measure of Time, nor friuolous Shadowes of Ioy, but all places there infinite and Immensurable, and consuming tyme quite banished, and the Pleasures that bee there be endlesse, and very glorious.
The vertue of the Earth in all bodies compou~d is to fortifie them and to make them durable, and fast.
soundnes of euery mixt thinge is deriued and fetched from this Element.
Yea and Earthquakes also, which come vpon a co~flict and force of some sore windes pent vp and scanted, or denied of their free course within the Entrailes or body of the earth, by such his sounde or forcible resistaunce, procure oftentimes greate distruction and decay to whole Cities, Townes, Countreyes.
As in the time of Seneca a greate part of the Towne Herculana,
as also the City Neapolis, and certayne cities of Ca~pania were ouerthrowen.
In Lybia there was so sore and horrible an Earthquake, that an hundred Cities at one time were decayed therewith.
And S. Augustine sayeth that at the very instant of Christes pas+sion there was such a sore Earthquake, yt with the same there were Eleuen whole Cities in Thracia subuerted.
And in Bythinia at the same time, almost all the hou+ses there were ouerthrowen.
yeare next after Christs Passion there fell downe with an Earthquake
famous cities in Asia (that is to say) Epliesus, Magnesia, Cesarea, Philadelphia, Sardis, Most hene, Megaethytra, Hymmolus, Themis, Myrrhina, Cumae, Apollonia, Diahir.
yeare after ye death of Christe, three other famous Cities were sunke in Asia by an Earthquake,
namely Laodicia, Hierapolis, and Colossa, and great wars afterwarde happened throughout all the countrey.
Cytyes likewise in Asia, Elea, Myrrhina, Pytanae, Cume; and two in Greece, Opuntys, and Orita:
dayes together was shake~ horribly, insomuch that a great deale of the buildinges there fell downe, much people was stayne.
and Fraunce there happened such an Earthquake, so grieuous and sore a Tempest withall, that it ouerthrew great and lofty trees, shooke and ouerturned very stronge and mighty buildinges.
times one after another, and destroied many people and much building.
At which time many Cyties also great Turrets, and Castels in Germany were likewise ouerthrowen.
yeare there brast forth out of the Earth wt an Earthquake certaine flames or lightes of fyre, by which many were sodenly slain.
And what shall say of Basile? which how often it hath ben decayed by Earthquakes cannot nowe stande to recite.
And euer lightly before such effects of Earthquakes there went before as tokens thereof great drowghts, or els continuall sore rayne, dryings vp of Fountaynes, the light
of ye Sunne in the Sommer time greately obscured by Blacke and darke Clowdes, or els with Clowdes of red and fyery colour, and whirle windes, and boysterous rough windes rending trees a sunder, or els turning their rootes vpward, fyery flames running alonge in the Element, straung aspect of stars, calme Ayre, and also great and grosse exhalations, vapors breathing forth fulsomly from ye bottome of ye earth, and the heauy aspect of Saturne, Mars.
These signes haue bene alwayes, and are yet for the most parte Prognosticators of
The Places, or Countreys which are most subiect to these are such as be nighe to the sea, and chiefly where there hee many Fens, and hollowe ventes of running Waters, as likewise in hilly Countryes.
For about the Alpes, Appenninum, Plynie himself is Witnesse that he hath experienced and perceiued very great and ofte~ tremblings quakings of the Earth.
The times which bee Naturally meetest for Earthquakes is the Spring time Autumne, and very seldom or neuer in the Winter time.
And when they happen it is oftner in the night, then in the day time: and the greatest and horriblest that so happeneth is in or about the night, and is not longe before the Sunset, or els it happeneth a litle before the Sun rysing.
Plynie in his second booke maketh two kindes, or differe~ces of Earthquakes.
One, which is the easiest, and which doth least hurt or harme: which is as it were a softy or right vp shaking,
with the Phylosophers called a Vibration which lyfteth lifteth vp buildinges and houses bending, shaking, and bowing the~ with his vpright force and trembling at their highest or top.
And such a kinde of Earthquake happened here in England vppon Easter Wednesday, in ye yeare of Christe
aboute vi. of the Clocke in the euening, Viz of Aprill: which heaued vp waters, hills, houses, Castels, with such thinges as were co~tayned in them, so bursting forth breaking out in such fauorable sorte, as that very title harme (the Lord be thanked therefore) happened within these Countreyes heere aboute vs. Which kinde of Earthquake was a very Vybration or a shaking of Gods sharpe and seuere Rod agaynste vs for the rottennesse of our sinnes: yet in such mercifull order that vpon proofe, and tryall of our amendment hee spared vs at that time fro~ sinking quite subuertinge vs, which thinge our wickednesse had thoroughly deserued.
God graunt the same clemency of our most merciful father may dryue and drawe vs now at the last to take heede to our selues, least that greater vengaunce ensuing doth not ouertake vs.
The second kinde of Earthquake which is a ruinous rushing together of all,
and of Pessidonius called Succussio, or Inclinatio, is more perilous and daungerous.
be farre distant are tost and cast vp one to another, and one vpon another; and in the same, Walles, Houses, Hilles, Castelles, Floudes, Ryuers, great parts and pieces of Countreyes are sodaynely soopte away quite: yea, of this second kinde of earthquake called a Concussion,
there is sometimes that property that runninge vp and downe within the Earthes inclosure, and there boyling like a seething Pot or seething Water, at the length it breaketh forth and doth wonderfull harme.
As it happened at Fryburge in Brisgoia, in the yeare of Christe
There is another kinde of Concussion or daungerous earthquake called Hiatus,
a gasping, or gaping as when ye earth wt forcible matter wtin is driuen to part sunder itself, with which kinde of Earthquake the Citty Cyllene (as sayth Plutarch was sundred and rent a two in the dayes of Mydas the king: and so was the countrey Lygustus afterwards with the same.
Also of this, there is an other kinde called Ruptor a burster,
which bursteth the Earth in twaine, and swelleth the same, and puffeth it vp like a hill, with
which the Ilande Hiera, as also the City Heraclea in Pontus was wonderfully tossed and tumbled.
Then is there another kinde of Concussion called Trusor a thrusting earthquake which with violent force thrusteth vp all that is in his way as it goeth,
Then is there another kinde called Mugitus which is after alowing Noyse, which with his stronge lowing sound shaketh the Grounde:
which sometimes also soundeth without shaking, as when ye matter thereof is more weake, but yet it striueth and strugleth within and laboureth to get out at the Earthes hollownesse.
And these kindes of Earthquakes as they haue naturall causes, so haue they their names accordingly.
But there haue bene other Earthquakes which beinge without such causes, and onely and meerely procured caused by Gods mighty Prouidence very Miraculously,
As was when Peter was deliuered out of Pryson: for yt was most straunge in deede:
firste by reason of the time, for it was at midnight: and the other are only in the euening and morning:
secondly they differ in forme or maner: for this shooke the foundations only of the Pryson house where Peter was shut vp in,
and the other sorts shake most of all at the highest partes or tops of houses and Buildings.
This also did but onely make away for Peters deliuery, and so closed vp the same agayne: the others where they once make any way thei quite destroy there for a full a doe, and neuer close or shut vp the same agayne.
Wherefore this was only a most speciall and supernaturall kinde of Earthquake.
Hee hath vnder him these Prouinces and Countryes, India, Aethiopia, and the lesser Asia.
Thus much of the iurisdiction, proprieetyes, effects, qualities of the seuen Planets, as also of all other kindes here below subiected vnto the~: and this which haue already sayd, thinke it enough and very sufficient at this time.
God graunt vs by the co~sideration thereof to condiscend into a more deepe meditation contemplation of his most excellent and deuine Maiesty: which is all in all, and all to all, as ye Poet said well: who is to be blessed foreuermore.

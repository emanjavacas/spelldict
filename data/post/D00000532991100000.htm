epigraph

john
in my fathers house there are many mansions if it were not so would have told you go to prepare a place for you
and if go will come again and receive you unto my self that where am there ye may be also

our blessed lord and saviour having in the foregoing chapter acquainted his disciples with his departure from them out of this world he comes here in this and the three following chapters to give them his last and therein he endeavours principally to comfort the sad hearts of his disciples who

were now disconsolate and cast down in the spirits under the sense of so great and sad a as the losse of their great and only lord an master jesus christ for whom they had le and lost all christ having acquainted them his going out of the world they thereupon presently begin to be dejected and cast down at thi sad news
lord said they have we left all followed thee and wilt thou now leave us shall we now be exposed to the difficultie and dangerous of the wide world no saith our saviour bi not discouraged let not your hearts be troubled it is for your good that go away in my fathers house are many mansions go to prepar a place for you and if go will come again and receive you
you shall be no losers by my going away from you will surelie make you a mends for all your losse there are mansions of joy in heaven that will abundantlie counter vail all your wordlie losses
if go away it is for your good for go to prepare a place for you and though you have not my bodilie presence yet you shall have my spirituall presence will send you another comforter that shall abide with you for ever
will not leave you comfortlesse will come unto you that is by my spirit to guide you and direct you into all truth and to bear up your hearts under all those troubles and temptations which ye shall meet withall in the world

having thus briefly given you the scope of whole come now to the words themselves com whence raise these four propositions first that there are mansions of glory in heaven for the people of god hereafter in my fathers house are many mansions

note from that christs ascension was to prepare a place for believers go to prepare a place for you

that christ will certainly come again nd receive believers to himself will come and receive you

and lastly which shall briefly insist upon note from hence those mansions of glory prepared by christ or believers in heaven will abundantly recomense and make good all the losses and all the crosses which believers may meet withall in the world

shall begin with the first of these that there mansions of glory for believers hereafter
the point is so plain from the words themselves that shall onely give you a place or two of scripture in the
psalm vers
the lord will give grace and glory and no good thing will withhold from them that walk uprightly
eye not seen ear hath not heard neither hath is ntred into the heart of man to conceive the things which god hath provided for them that love him
cor
come ye blessed saith your saviour inherit the kingdom prepared for you mat

severall other scriptures might give you
shall proceed to the uses of this usefull is it so then that there are mansions of glor for the godly hereafter then note from the unspeakable miserie of all wicked men bo here and hereafter is there glory in heaven
believers what is there then in hell for unblievers if glorie be the portion of the godly wh will the lot and portion of wicked men
the wicked saith psal
shall be turm into hell and all the nations that forget go
wicked men shall have no part nor portion those glorious mansions they are prepated for the godlie wicked men may indeed shall but further agravate their sorrow behold
saints received by christ into glorie as dives held la zarus in abrahams bosome but it afar off
wicked men may at the last day he that blessed sentence fo come ye blessed but the again also they shal hear and that with a vengeance too that wofull sentence of go ye into everlasting fire prepared for the devil his angels
it is impossible for wicked men such as live and die in sin unrepented of to into heaven
know ye not saith the apostle
that the unrighteous shall not inherit kingdom of god
the evangelist st john re

speaking of the world to come which foresaw in his heavenlie vision saw saith he

dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in those books according to their works
all the wayes of men both good and bad are exactlie written down both in the book of gods everlasting rememberance and in the book of mans own particular conscience and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell that is the grave delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works
and whosoever was not found written in the lambs book of life was cast into the lake of fire there's the event of this judgement to the wicked
but what successe the righteous shall there have he sets down in chap
verse
behold saith he the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe all tears from their eyes
and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor cursing neither shall there be any more pain
he that overcometh shall inherit all thing and will be his god and he shall be on
a blessed priviledge indeed but what remains for the wicked see what follows in the eight verse
the fearfull and unbelieving the abominable

and murtherers whoremongers sorcerers and idolaters and all lyars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone
a most dreadfull scripture the lord awaken every secure sinner and give them hearts to consider these things before it be too late for as the prophet malachy faith mal
the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day cometh that shall burn them up saith the lord hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch
then shall they call upon the mountains to cover them and the lls to fall upon them to hide them from the fierceness of the wrath of god
consider this all you that forget god lest he tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver you

secondly if there be such mansions of glory for believers hereafter note from hence the desperate folly and madnesse of all those who neglect or despise their own salvation
ye will not come to me saith our saviour joh
that ye might have life
this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men love darknesse rather then light because their deeds are evil
christ and salvation is freely offered to all in the gospel christ invites all to come ho every one that thirsteth come to the waters isa
rev
the spirit and the bride

say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely
and as christ invites all to come so he receives all that doth come he that comes to me will in no wayes cast him out saith our saviour joh
what think you sinners of these scriptures will ye come to christ and accept of life and salvation or will ye wilfully cast away your own souls for ever you see here christ offers himself to you freely if you will but receive him
come unto me saith our saviour mat
all ye that labour and are heavy laden and will refresh you
what of the will ye come and be saved you be so mad as to destroy your own most precious and immortall souls when behold the lives of most men my very heart trembles to think what will everlastingly become of their precious souls all the care they take is for their bodies how does money come in and how they shall get riches but they never consider how it goes with their souls ah sinners are your bodies everlasting is this world everlasting can any thing but heaven make you happy are not your souls everlasting will ye rather cast away your souls then leave your lusts for sin and you must part orelse heaven and your souls will never meet he that doth not leave his sins on

this side the grave by repentance shall find sins to meet him on the other side the gravel condemn him
if you live in your sins ye die in your sins yea die everlastinglie for you sins
sinners beseech you consider are fit to die are you fit to live in another world are you prepared for heaven if not let me te you you are fit for nothing but hell and prepared for you
sinners what do you do what do you mean to do are you yet a sleep lord what a harvest will hell have in these sin full daies what preparations do men make so heaven are not they that were filthie what men were that they are still god is every day tumbling men into their graves yet no man mends his pace for heaven
sinners you hear all this but can you bear all this me give you two or three properties of a man fitted for hell and beseech you try and your own souls by them

the first propertie of a man fitted for hell obduration a stone you know is fitted to descend it is its propertie to fall downwards hardnesse makes fitnesse
the way to hell is from burning to burning from a seared conscience to a damned soul

a second propertie of a man fitted for wrath is alienation estrangednesse to god speaks fitness to wrath and it is a sign that the soul is

fitted for utter darknesse
there are but two steps to death first the sinner saith he will have no fellowship with god and secondlie god saith he shall have no fellowship with him now is the sinner judged now fit for hell then judge ye the execution onlie is wanting and the devil is not usuallie backward to perform his office the sinner is upon the gallows as it were he wants but turning off unlesse christ steps in with a reprieve that soul is utterlie lost

a third propertie of a man for hell is prophanenesse prophanenesse is the badge of a wicked person wickednesse in the life speaks out a cursed soul
you may know what countrie men are of by their language by their fruits ye shall know them
when mens words and works are the language of hell what need any further inquirie what countrie men or to what place they belong you may read hell in their very faces
the tree is known by his fruit saith our saviour mat
mens lives foreshew what their ends are like to be as the tree falls so it lyes as sinners live so they usuallie die every mans life lively bespeaks what they are and what they shall be hereafter if men will go on in the broad way of sin you know where their journies end will be broad is the way that leadeth to destruction mat
know not what lives you live but to be sure you

may either spell heaven or hell in them
if ye would know the frame of your souls then view your lives your souls breath out themselves either into the bosom of god or the devils and into whose bosom you breath out your souls here in this life into that bosom you will certainly them out in death
fitting grace for heaven you see is no trifle your eternall estate depends upon it
sinners why do you put off this work as a trisle and why do you put it off till death dare say that man would never be holy if be could help it that will not be holy till he die he would never have to do with christ if he could avoid that will not be acquainted with him before he is ready to leave this world when death is fitting the soul for hell then and never till then to be looking after heaven
ah lord that ever those men should have precious and immortall souls to damn themselves they that look no after heaven till they come to their are usually crost in their folly they are then either surprized with infirmities of body and so disinabled to perform so great a work or else surprized in their souls and so unfitted and indisposed to it either they have no strength or no heart to it and so dye in their sins and perish eternally
wicked men would never leave sinning if they did not cease living and that is one reasont to justifie

the infinitnesse or everlastingnesse of the punishment of wicked men in hell
the damned in hell are under easelesse and endlesse sufferings because they would have sinned alwayes if they had lived alwayes wicked men would have no end of their lives here they would live ever that they might sin ever therefore the lord giveth them a life not such a one as they would have but such a one as they deserve to have which is indeed a death for ever wicked men shall die eternally for sin because they would have lived eternally in sin

in the third place beseech you note from hence what a blessed thing it is to be a child of god is it so that there are mansions of glory for believers in heaven hereafter then believers are the onely happy men and women in the world
were it not for the hopes of heaven the condition of gods children might be sad enough
if in this life onely we had hope we were of all men most miserable cor
but the hopes of gods children are in the life to come therefore they are of all men most blessed
the happinesse of a child of god is not in what he enjoyes here below but in what he shall enjoy hereafter in glory
the best things of a child of god are unseen things whilst we look not saith the apostle at the things which are seens but a the

things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things that are no seen are eternall cor
and in pet
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundance mercy hath begotten us again unto a lived hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation
the apostle here excellent sets forth the condition of a child of god and that in severall regards
first they are gotten again by christ to an inheritance possiblie they may lose all here below for sake but yet here is the comfort of a child god he is heir to a great estate in the ne
world there is an inheritance for him that is a sure one in six regards first not a corruptible but an incorruptible one
condly it's an undefiled one and thirdlie it a lasting yea an everlasting one it fadeth no away
fourthly it's reserved for them ti they come to age
gods children in this life are not at full age therefore they are nor of enjoying so great a happinesss which god will hereafter bestow upon them
fifthlie it reserved for them in a safe place
many mo leave great estates here for their children whi

they are often cheated of but the inheritance of gods children is reserved by god for them in heaven where neither moth doth corrupt nor theis steals away
and lastlie as the inheritance is reserved for the children of god so the people of god are preserved for their inheritance henven if reserved for them and they are preserved for heaven they are kept by the mightie power of god through faith unto salvation

fourthly are there such mansion of glorie for believers hereafter then beseech you try and examine your own souls whether or no ye be in the faith and let me exhort you in the name of christ seriouslie to set about the work of salvation
you see what great and glorious things there are laid in store for gods children hereafter then beseech you labour to get an interest in christ here that so you may partake of those glorious mansions hereafter
how greatlie should the consideration of these things draw out our hearts in longings and pantings after god when shall come and appear before god saith david psalm
as the hart panteth after the so panteth my soul after thee god my soul thirsteth for god for the living god
when shall come and appear before god and if david and such longings after the enjoyment of god

in his ordinances here what desires thought we to have after the full enjoyment god himself in glory hereafter
are there mansions of glory to be had hereafter manner of persons ought we to be then in all maner of godlinesse

and then lastly if there be such of glory then let me exhort you all even now this your day to set your hearts at work seeking after those great things of eterni
let every soul of you thus reason with you selves are there such glorious things hereafter and am the man or woman that shall joy them remember a story of gauls having once tasted the sweet wine of ita presently enquired after the countrie and ver rested till they had gotten it
have he given you as it were a of that wine which believers shall drink hereafter in glory now if you find any sweetne in it let not your hearts be at rest till you com to the countrie it self where are rivers those sweet pleasures and that for evermore
martyr suffering death one asked him the cau why he suffered saith he in the words of
apostle eye hath not seen ear hath nor heart neither hath it entred into the heart of man conceive the things which god hath prepared them that love him
the naming of wh

wrought so effectually on the mans heart that immediately became a christian and after death of his names sake
you have not onely one but very many scriptures to you beseech you let not all be in
we read in mark
how the young came running to christ saying good mater what shall do to inherit eternall life that you ever you that hear me this day would also come running unto christ saying what shall we do to partake of these glorious here revealed methinks those things greatly incourage you all old and young ich and poor now to get an interest in christ
that are poor and have but little in this world consider there are as great things in world to come for you as for others
the oorest beggar shall have as great a portion in world to come as the greatest prince
nothing in this world can satisfie a chils of god the glory of the world its but the portion of reprobate and will a reprobates portion you will a dogs portion satisfie you all things in the world saith the but as dung
phil

there are other to be sought after see what our saviour mat
seek ye first the king dome of and the righteousnesse thereof let that your first indeavour
strive to enter in at the

strait gate though the passage benever so stra yet if it be the way to glory strive to enter thereat
consider god hath given you ntures capable of such glorious things as are god might have made you bruit bea and then there had been an end of you god hath made you creatures capable of highest excellency and therefore being of a nature it highly concerns you to seek af such things as may give satisfaction to souls
men live as if they were capable of things else but meat and drink and cloaths if there were no higher things which conce our souls hereafter
the heathens could lieve that man was created for greater thing then these here below and if we who have great and glorious things revealed to us in gospel shall we neglect the looking after then how just shall our condemnation be for shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation heb

come now to the second point and that this that christs ascension was to prepar place for believers go to prepare a place you
as christ came down from heaven to for sinner so christ ascended up to heaven that believing sinners might live with him hen after
had not christ ascended into heaven he had not finisht the work of our redemption

and indeed the great support of a child of god yes in his consideration
it's christ that died yea rather that is risen again and now sits at the right hand of god making intercession for us rom
father will saith christ john
that those whom thou hast given me may be with me where am
if christ be not risen saith the apostle then is our preaching vain and our faith is vain and we are yet in our sins
but as sureas christ died
so the apostle proves
cor
that he rose again and ascended up into heaven
that's an excellent scripture rom
he was delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification
our blessed saviour first appearing to mary magdalen after his resurrection presently sends her to his disciples with the joyfull news of his ascension john
go to my brethren and say unto them ascend to my father and your father to my god and your god
how joyfull is the consideration of christs ascension to a child of god now may a child of god say he hath a friend in the court and a friend in the court we use to say is betcer then a penny in the purse
every believer hath christ for his friend in the court of heaven and that's more worth to them then thousands of gold and silver
christ is in heaven pleading the cause for believers if any

man sin saith the apostle ioh
we have an advocate with the father jesus christ righteous
and it is good for believers jesus christ is in heaven pleading their cause
god so it is good for them that he is there senting and perfuming all their prayers to the father
whatsoever it is that we want that may do us good christ is ready to beg us of his father
father saith christ these may friends and for them have shed my blo therefore father will that they may with me to behold my glory
that is an excel
scripture heb
wherefore he is able to save to the uttermost those that come unto by him seing he ever liveth to make interces for them

is it so then that christ ascension was prepare a place for believers then this short encourage believers to be willing to do or any thing here for christ what was that made the saint suffer so joyfully christ was it not this the assurance of god love in christ to them what was it that up iobs spirit so patiently under all his suffings know saith he though worms dest my body yet my redeemer liveth and sh see him with these eyes
we know saith the apostle cor
if our earthly house of this

nalce were dissolved we have a building of jod an house not made with hands etrnall in the heavens
the assurance of heaven will make as willing to do or suffer any thing for christ
there is that in heaven that will abundantly and make good all our losses on earth
christians beseech you consider you can either do too much or suffer too much for the getting of heaven
the apostles were as great sufferers for the kingdom of heaven as ever any were and yet what account did they make of it we reckon say they that the suffering of this present world are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us rom
if we suffer with christ we shall also reign with christ tim


a third point noted was this that christ wil come again and receive believers to himself the point is clear from the words themselves will come again and receive you
but a little to illustrate the point shall endeavour to shew you by scripture that it is so and secondly how it is so
first that it is so that christ will come again see that positive scripture in acts
and while they looked stedfastly into heaven behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye men of galileo why stand ye here gazing up into heaven his same iesus which is taken up from you into

heaven shall so come in like manner as ye ha seen him go into heaven
here is the point see confirmed by scripture and that by mouths of angles as sure as christ is gone heaven and as sure as he now fitteth at right hand in heaven so sure will he come gain at the last day and receive believers himself
and then how christ will come shall come in power and great glory matth

and secondly he will come sudden even as a thief in the night
first he sh come in power irresistible power against sners
beseech you sinners consider you not be able to stand when he appears for as is all powerfull in himself so will he come atded with an innumerable company of glori
saints and angels
behold saith jude lord commeth with ten thousand of his sai to execute judgement upon all and to convi all
thes
the lord jesus shall revealed from heaven with his mighty angles flamming fire taking vengeance on them th know not god and obey not the gospel of our lo
jesus christ who shall be punished with everlaing destruction from the presence of the lord a from the glory of his power
though god long suffering towards sinners yet will he no always suffer sinners to go unpunished
the so of man shall come in his glory all the holy angels

with him mat
and second lie he shal suddenlie and swiftlie swiftlie even as the ightning
and suddenlie as a thief in the night pet

those scoffers there mocked and scofed at the doctrine of christs comming to judgement but saith the apostle in the ninth verse though the lord be long suffering yet he is not ack concerning his promise but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night
though sinners may think christ long yet they shall find him sure
the comming of christ will be sudden to sinners in two respects sudden in regard of their expectation he will come before they look for him and sudden in regard of their unpreparednesse christ will come to sinners before they are ready for him they will be then to seek for oyl in their lamps
christ as one saith though he hath leaden feet yet he hath iron hands though god be long ere he does strike yet when he doth strike he will be sure strike home
yet a little while and he that sh all come will come and will not tarry

now the use which shall make of this point shall be onely this will christ come again and receive believers then let me exhore you all to believe in the lord jesus christ would you be received by christ into glory then beseech you labour to receive christ your souls by believing
if christ do not

live in you by faith here you shall never with christ in glory hereafter
it is unbe that is the sin he that believe not is condemned already iohn
he that lieveth shall he saved but he that believeth shall be damned mark

he that believ on the son hath everlasting life but he believeth not the son shall not see life but wrath of god abideth on him john


another use which must make of this poi might be this to comfort and encourage people of god in all their sufferings and loss
art thou in poverty doth the world frown thee are thy afflictions and losses many a great let not your hearts be troubled ch is gone to prepare a place for you and ch will come again and receive you therefore not discouraged
what though you meet many rubs and stops in your way yet you be sure to get to glory at the last
consider through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of heaven

the fourth and last observation which served was this that those mansions of glo prepared by christ for believers in heaven abundantly recompense and make good all losses and all the crosses which believers here meet withall in the world
let not yo hearts be troubled in my fathers house are

mansions
sell all saith our saviour and follow me thou shalt have treasure in heaven

for further prosecution of this usefull point shall proceed to handle it first doctrinallie and then applicatorilie and for the doctrinal part shall endeavour to shew you first what those mansions of glorie are which are laid up for believers and secondlie what those losses are which believers may here meet withall and hen lastly how those mansions of glorie do make good the losses and crosses which believers meet with in the world and to begin with the first what those mansions of glorie are which are up for believers in heaven and all that an be said of this will be but as it were the lighting of a candle to the sun for it comes infitelie short of the skill either of men or angels expresse as the apostle saith eyes hath not een ear hath not heard neither hath it entred in the heart of man to conceive the things which god hath prepared for them that love him cor
the glorie of the glorified saints in heaen is so exceeding glorious that it is not posble for all the tongues of men or angels to exess it
but by the way to give you some glimps of this most excellent glorie consider a little hese following particulars

first in heaven we shall have the everlasting refence of god himself there we shall see god

as he is not by faith but by sight clea and fullie
shall see him saith holy with these eyes
now we see as it were throug glasse darkly but there we shall see god fac face
we shall see him as we are seen
th and there we shall be ever with the lord as apostle hath it thess

we shall enjoy in heaven freely and fully without let or inruption though the saints may possiblie with many and great impediments and him rances in the way unto heaven yet in there shall be nothing to hinder or inter their joy
it is possible that a child of may have his skin pulled over his ears as so of the apostles had in their way unto hea yet being gotten into heaven nothing shall lest or trouble them at all
what an unspeable inconceiveable comfort will it be chrians to have and enjoy the presence of god who is all and hath all and will be elastinglie all in all to his people for ever wh having not seen saith the apostle we sire to love in whom believing we rejoice joy unspeakable and full of glory
and if fight of gods presence by faith be so what then will be full fruition and enjment of god himself be unspeakables full of glorie

a second thing which would speak to

indeed must but speak to it is the perfection of grace that shall be enjoyed in heaven christians when ye come to heaven then ye come to full age in heaven
the spirits of just men shal be made perfect and the bodies of the saints shal be made glorious even like the glorious body of christ
there we shall do the will of god perfectlie
in heaven there is no sin nor temptation to sin no not so much as a vain thought or an idle word and as there is no sin so there is no satan
there shall be no more need of sermons nor sacraments nor prayers but the whole work of the saints in heaven will be to sing praises and hallelujahs to god for ever and ever

thirdlie in heaven there is fulnesse of joy rivers of pleasures at gods right hand and that for evermore psalm
and those rivers of pleasures shall flow in and from the presence of god himself as the fountain of all those joies which have infinitenesse and eternitie in them without the least dram of sorrow for god shall then wipe away all tears from our eyes and there shall be no more sorrow rev
the rivers of the saints joy in heaven as they are without bank so they are without bottom our masters joy will then be so great that we his servants shall not be able to contain it there is nothing in heaven but what is

matter of joy our fathers house our inhetance our kingdome our crown and glory our sight of gods face
that is an speech of david thou shalt make me saith he full of joy with shy countenance heaven is boundlesse yea a bottomlesse ocean of joy an happinesse the society of blessed angels at glorified saints
in a word the joies of far exceeds all the joies that can be thought upon earth not onely the joy of marriag and the joy of harvest but also they joy of fait and the joy of ordinances which are all swalowed up by this great ocean of joy can disturb or diminish the joies of the saints heaven

fourthly as there is fulnesse of joy in heaven so there is excellency of glory perfection of glory shall be the saints robes in heaven they shall shine as the stars for ever and ever dan

in the one and twentieth of the revelations st john speaking of the new jerusalem exactly describes the glory thereof it is citty whose walls are jasper and the strepure gold clear as christal whose foundation are of precious stones and the gates thereof pearles and if this new jerusalem the church of god here below be so glorious how exceeding glorious then is that heavenly jerusalem which is above heaven as one saith is the

palace of the king of glory the presence chamber of the great god whose presence it is that makes heaven to be heaven there indeed would be no heaven if god himself were not there
in heaven god makes his glory visible both to saints and angels thence it is called a crown of glory an eternal weight of glory glory shall then and there cover the saints all over from top to toe both within and without their souls shall there be made glorious in knowledge wisdom and understanding and their bodies shall be made like the glorious body of christ the bodies of the saints in heaven shall be free from all necessities of nature as food and raiment sleep and the like
in heaven there shall be no need of these things

secondly in heaven the bodies of the saints shall be freed from all natural infirmities and deformities sicknesse diseases pains or such like bodily infirmities there shall be no cripples no blinde nor diseased ones in heaven heaven is an healthful countrie there is no sicknesse nor death no poverty nor disgrace in heaven our bodies shall be cloathed in heaven with life and immortality by christ christ will there change our vile bodies and make them like his glorious body phil

did moses face shine when he beheld but the

glorie of gods did stephens face with angelicall splendor or brightnesse ho gloriouslie then shall the glorious bodies of th
saints shine when they shall stand before the lord of glorie the saints then shall be a the psalmist expresses it all glorious within their cloathing shall be all wrought gold
th glorie which gods people shall see and enjoy
heaven will infinitely oblidge them to spen eternity there
take a little view a as it were of the saints glorie in heaven
first it is great an exceeding excessive and eternall weight of glory as saint paul expresses cor
the glory of heaven is the glor of glories joy unspeakable and full of glories and unconceiveable therefore it called glory to be revealed rom
a little the greatnesse of this heavenly glories these two things first the vessels that ta
it secondly the resemblance that sets it forth
the vessels that take in this glorie are the and bodies of saints whom the apostle call vessels of mercy prepared unto glory first for the soul here in this life the whole wor is not able to fill or satisfie one souls
the so is capable of more then the whole world is ab to give it but the glory of heaven th will fill all the souls of all the saints
read of some saints that they live their full

they had as it were their ballyful of life but in the life to come all the saints be filled full of glory
secondly for bodies of the saints though they are vessels of lesse quantity then the soul yet the world not able to fill or satisfie the body to the full to instance in the eye and the ear those ttle members of our bodie
we use to say of that their eye is bigger then their belle the little eye at one glance can take into more then half the world and what abundance of noise and found will the ear receive at nce
the eye is not satisfied as the wiseman saith eccles

with seeing nor the ar with hearing
those little members of our are either clogged or tyred out before can be filled or satisfied with those things not only the souls but even the bodies of the saints in heaven shall be filled of glory from the crown of their heads to the sole of their feet
in heaven the everlasting doors of our souls shall alwayes stand wide open to receive the glory of christ in the streams thereof and then shall christ the king of glory come in dwell with them for ever

secondly the greatnesse of the saints glory in heaven may further appear by the resemblances that sets it forth first the glory of kings upon their coronation day that greatly

sets forth and illustrates the greatnesse of saints glory in heaven for in heaven saints shall all be crowned kings and sh reign as kings for ever in glory they shall herit the kingdom as our saviour saith

prepared for them from the foundation the world


the glory of the stars that also resem the glory of the saints in heaven
one star fereth from another in glory cor
the very bodies of the saints in heaven shall shine all the glory of all the stars yea the glory of the sun it self which out shiner all glory of the stars
see what our saviour sa
mat
then shall the righteous shine fo as the sun in the kingdom of their father

the glory of the glorious angels th another resemblance of the saints in glo the glory of the angels that far exeeds all glory of all the stars yea and all the kings monarchs of the world but the saints in hven shall be like unto the very angels

or as st luke hath it luk
equal to the angles in glory


the glory of christ himself who is of glory that resembles and sets forth the gl of the saints when christ comes to be glori in his saints at the last day then shall the sai appear with christ in glory
christ is the glo

the saints here and christ will be the glory of the saints hereafter christ will then put his glory upon them and they shall shine with the glory thereof then they shall be like him as st ohn saith john
for we shall see him as he is
then the bodies of the saints which have lien the dust shall arise and put on beautifull garents even the robes of glory
christ will then change their vile bodies and make them like to glorious body the saints shall be made conmable to christ in glory
is not then the glory of the saints in heaven exceeding great you it is a a a an yea a glory

secondly the glory of heaven is solid subtantial and weighty the apostle cor lls it an exceeding eternall weight of glory 's like to precious things as gold and crowns more weighty they are the more worth is in em hence the original word sighifies both weight and glory
whereas on the contrary glory that's light and frothy having no bstance nor reality in them they are only shadows that appear and then vanish away a fashion as the apostle calls it cor
that passeth it is like a picture that hath only shape and colour but no life meer fantasie a sound and no more

thirdly heavenly glory that is permanent

and durable it is lasting yea an glory it is perpetuall it shall never nor decay but worldly honour and glory th transitory inconstant perishing and passing way like a feather in the air it is only seen blown away with the wind pet

the glory of man is as the flower of the gra in the morning it flourishes but in the eve
it is cut down and withered

fourthly the glory of heaven is satisfy and contenting they that enjoy it shall fire no more but for worldly glory they have most of it still desire more but the in heaven shall have as much of glory as can hold yes more then their hearts can or desire
all the saints in heaven shall we are rich and are full we have all an bound

in heaven there is plenty of wea peace and safety rest and reward plenty wealth without want
the treasures of ven cannot be corrupted there is no moth rust nor thieves to steal them away
heaven treasures can never fail they are like the dows oyl they increase upon the saints are bags that wax not old unsearchable rich ephes

the gold of glory can never be or summed up
secondly in heaven then plenty of peace without trouble safety with danger triumph without war there all enemies

shall cease our bodily enemies shall be reconciled unto us and the enemies ur souls shall be all cast into the lake of fire brimstone
in heaven there is no bloody to kill a righteous abel no luxurious soites to vex a righteous lot no ishmael off no shimri to curse no esau to terri
no rabshekah to rail no herod to perse the people of god no judas to betray a our
in heaven there is peace not for tearm but for ever and ever
thirdly in ven there is plenty of rest without weariness is no work to do but what is pure delight only work of the saints in glory will be to praises and hallelujahs to god for ever and
heaven will be a place of ease and rest to wearie there remaineth a rest for the ple of god heb
tis possible they may as it were here with doing the work god or wearied with suffering persecutions the sake of christ but there remaineth a rest them hereafter
what a sweet expression is art thou troubled and turmoil'd here thou it have rest hereafter
blessed are the dead th die in the lord said the spirit they rest their labours and their works do follow rev
fourthly in heaven there is nty of reward do you here suffer for righteousness sake great is your reward in heaven saith

our saviour mat
do you suffer for christ here you shall reign with christ hereafter glory
the light afflictions of a saint here we work for him an exceeding and eternall weig of glory hereafter
upon this account our blessed saviour calls on us to rejoyce in our sufferings mat
rejoice saith he and be exceeding glade for great is your reward in heaven what we suffer for god we suffer for the kingdom of god and upon that score the saints a said to be counted worthy of the kingom of go thes
the sufferings of this life are worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be in the life to come
do you labour hard he for god and his cause do you spend and a you spent in his service perhaps you may be poorly requited by men but consider heaven is a large recompense of everlasting reward
it said of moses heb
that he chose rather suffer afflictions with the people of god then enjoy the pleasures the seeming pleasures of si for a season
for indeed they are but seeming pleasures which continue but for a season an counted the reproach of christ greater riches them all the honours of egypt
for saith the apostle
he had respect to the recompense of reward moses could see glory to come through all the sufferings of this life
heaven is our great and masters joy where all his faithfull servant

shall be received and rewarded to all eternity
fifthly in heaven there is good company blessed society god and christ and the holy spirit millions of millions of blessed saints and glorious angels
then shall the saints be gathered to their father yea to their fathers and iends who are gone to heaven before them
and is it not a happiness think you to be among our friends do you not think that time well here which you spend in the enjoyment embracements of your friends society whose ve and favour is altogether inconstant and angeable you may be taken from them or they from you in a moment but your friends heaven they are immortall and their love is changeable they and you shall then and there ve for ever and enjoy one another and rejoice ne with another for ever but your dearest iends on earth must die they must leave you your joy in heaven shall no man take from
in heaven there is god your father and christ your head and husband and saviour there even in his humane nature wherein he ffered death on the crosse for you and your god the holy spirit is there yea all your friends
how mightily do children ng to go home to their fathers house or a wife her husband so earnestly should our souls sire to go to heaven our fathers house to christ

our head and husband where there is good pany only and that to all eternity

and then lastly the glory of heaven is stant and permanent in heaven all is safe sure all things continue there fixed and
heaven is an inheritance settled upon saints for ever and sealed unto them by broad seal of christs blood

have shewed you in part what those sions of glory are which the saints shall hereafter come now and must be brief ving a little touch on it already to show what those losses and crosses are which bvers may meet withall here below and first the losses which you may meet withall in world
what are they poor trifles a as it were a little earthly sure it may be such as is not considerable little what those worldly enjoyments are wh possibly thou mayest lose for christs sake thou losest nothing for christ here but wh vanity and emptiness broken cistrens that hold no water
for as one saith well
a wfull of honours or pleasures cannot satisfie one with any solid comfort
thou mayest as soon thy chest with grace as thy heart with go
there is not that in the creature which look for experience tells us a man may at have a house full of gold and yet a heart ful

sorrow they that enjoy the most of the world cannot say they have enough therefore the losse of it is not considerable not to be comparers with the gain of heaven
seconly there is nothing thou losest for heaven but what is the portion of the wicked comforts are wicked mens portions yea and all the portion that ever they shall have either here or hereafter son remember saith abraham to dives being in hell that thou in thy thy good things
they that have their heaven in this world shall have nothing in heaven in the world to come
thirdly thou canst nothing for christ that can be profitable to all the outward good things of this life cannot sanctifie nor purchase one dram of saving grace for thee they may prove share to or be occasions of sin to you or draw you from christ as they did the in the gospel but they will never drive you to christ and commonly they that have most of gold have of grace or rather no grace at all
and as they cannot sanctifie you so they cannot save you they can neither sheer you from the judgements of god here of from the stroke of neither can they preserve you from hell hereafter
rich dives went to hell when poor lozarus was carried unto heaven wordly things cannot purchase heaven if the whole

world would lend you their shoulders th could not lift you up to heaven
fourth there is nothing here below that is certain things under the sun are mutable sublu enjoyments more changeable then the mo inconstant even as the winde certain on in uncertainties and as they are uncerta so they are corruptible and perishing
ch calls them meat that perisheth joh
things which either moths or rust may consu or thieves may steal away from you or they be destroyed by fire which if you do posse while you live yet you must leave them beh you when you die for as we brought noth into the world so it is certain we shall carry thing out of the world
tim


fifthly outward enjoyments are often troublesome they bring many fears many ca much sorrow and vexation there is a car get and a care to keep riches as the wise faith all is vanity so is it also vexation of rit
worldly comforts they are like roses th have sharp prickles as well as sweet flowers
man may have much bitternesse in his least comforts here therefore do not think much part with all things here below for christ thou shalt be no loser by the bargain thou sh receive an hundred fold more in this life and the world to come eternall life mark

come now in the next place in a word to you what these crosses are which believers do oftentimes undergo for the kingdom of heavens sake and they are very small and insiderable also in respect of the glory that follows
the apostles endured as much tribulations for the kingdom of heavens sake as possibly ould be yet what did they think of it we ckon saith st paul that the afflictions of this are not worthy to be compared with the gloly that shall be
for first they are but light our light afflictions
and as they are light so they are or short they are but for a moment our light affliction saith the apostle which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and ternall weight of glory
hence it is that the ints of old were so joyfull in all their tribulations hence they rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer for the name of christ

shall come now to shew you how it is that mansions of glory in heaven will make all our losses and crosses upon earth and his appears further for these reasons
for first you have heard already the glory of the glofied saint in heaven is infinite and durable therefore must needs exceed and make good their losses which as you have also heard are te and uncertain
we use to account more of things which are durable and lasting than those things which are of no certainty

secondly the only yea all the treasures the saints are laid up in heaven and what any care for losing a few triffles so long as treasure is safe if a man lose a few triff yet if he have a safe treasury to go to he soon make good so small a losse
beloved all things you do enjoy here are but triffles but things which you shall enjoy hereafter in hven are no lesse then a treasure a rich trsury the of god himself into which he hath been treasuring up for his from the foundation of the world
might much larger herein but will conclude all word or two of application
is it so then that those mansions of glory pared by christ for believers in heaven abundantly recompense and make good all losses and crosses which believers meet with in the world the beseech you set your fections upon things above and not on things low
you see we live in slippery times we not say that any thing is certain here labour to be sure of something hereafter
if canst not keep thy earthly inheritance then bout to get an inheritance in heaven

secondly for must be brief if there be glorious mansions in heaven then labour to pare your souls for heaven
but how shall we this may some say answer these five way


wouldst thou prepare thy self for heav

be fruitfull then in well doing alwayes abounding in the works of the lord be sure to get that work done which god sent you into the world to do growing in grace is going to heaven and grace here will make you fit and meet for glory hereafter


would you prepare for heaven labour to purge your selves then from all sin by being unpotted in the world for as heaven is a place of happiness so it is a place of holiness into which nothing that is unclean can enter it is only the in heart that shall see god mat


would you prepare for heaven then get selves into a posture of readinesse to leave he world and go to heaven every day that may up and be gone when ever death calls you so that when death comes you may nothing to do but to die
death will not when he cometh if ye are not fit to die ye not fit for heaven death will not carry that to heaven that is not ready when he comes
you are not ready to die when ever death let me tell you ye are not fit to live in world
you know not at what hour christ come or send his messenger death for you be alwayes ready for heaven because is alwayes ready for you
when the came they that had oil in their grace in their hearts they went in to the riage but for those that wanted oil the door

was shut against them and they were shut from the
they that have la without oil profession without grace shall enter into heaven


would you prepare for heaven then your title to heaven cleared and confirme you what man is there that having purch a great estate that will be so foolish as get a sure title to what he hath purchased we are strangers and pilgrims as all our fa were but heaven that's our home our our fathers house our inheritance should we then labour to make that sure to souls and having made that sure labour in the next place to keep up your evide
first keep your evidences for heaven and fair for satan will endeavour to blot
secondly keep them safe the devil wi them from you if he can and if ye lose evidences what have you to shew for hea
if your writings be lost how will you get inheritance then whatsoever you do of heaven for first assurance of he will take off your hearts from the world rance of those things above will make you to part with all things here below co you in all your tribulations and bear up hearts under all discouragements as it did vids jobs and pauls
evidence for heaven lie warm at your hearts when naturall hea

yes when you lie upon your death beds they ill be a sweet taste to your souls when you eel no taste or comfort in meat or drink assuance of heaven will comfort you when all ings fail you assurance of heaven will preare you for all changes it will fit you for your eat change
assurance of life eternall will onquer the grave for you and unsting death you it will make you sing yea to triumph the way to heaven over death and the grave
they that have heaven assured to them have more joy and gladness put into their souls than ll the world besides
assurance of salvation will ngage you to trust god for all things and evience god to your souls it will make you to love nd delight in him fearfull to offend carefull to lease him
thirdly assurance makes men uspicious of themselves they that are assur'd hat they shall stand will be sure to take heed hat they do not fall they that shall be saved ill labour to work it out with fear
fourthly ssurance makes the soul humble the higher the oul is in assurance the lower it will be in humiity
but how shall we know that our assurance or heaven is right take these following rules


right assurance will make you more holy every man that hath this hope purifies himself as god is pure
right assurance for heaven will ngage your souls to be holy in all manner of conversation having therefore these promises

dearly beloved cleanse your selves from all thinesse both of the flesh and spirit cor


right assurance will make the soul to to the end receiving the end of your the salvation of your souls
but how shall get this assurance
by having a godly row for sin wrought in thy soul
christ gives to none but to the weary

examine your he and lives by comparing them with the word god

assurance is obtained by a holy and carefull use of the ordinances of in joining both the end and the means togeth
it will make you as carefull to use the means confident to expect the end of your faith the vation of your souls
it doth not feed men vain hopes that they shall escape hell thou they live in sin and go on in the broad way leads to destruction
they that would come heaven must be carefull to use the they must walk in that strait and narrow unto holinesse and righteousnesse which on leads unto life and salvation

and lastly is it so then that godlines is great yea it is the best gain hath god made thee the lines are fallen to thee in a pleasant place hast a goodly heritage psal
it is enough hast all though it may be thou hast but little the world yet thou hast a propriety in god is thine thy portion is christ he is thy jes thy all labour then to be conformable to

godliness is gods likeness
hath god given you ace god hath done more for you than if he nd given you a thousand worlds
are others ch and art thou poor have others plenty of old and silver and hast thou little or none ar all onsider hath not god given thee that which is finitely better than all the gold and riches of he world faith that is more precious than gold that perishes wisdom that is better than bies yea all things that can be thought of are ot comparable to grace
if grace be thy portion lory will be thy portion and thou hast more use of content than if thou hadst all the world or thy portion without grace
what though ohers be richer than thee yet thou art better than thers
the righteous is more excellent then his neighr are others had in honour and art thou depised let me tell thee if thou hast the favour of god thou hast more honour then all the world give
are thy troubles greater nor others conder god seeth them good for thee thou canst or tell how to be without them it is good for me saith david that have been afflicted they that ave endured the most of afflictions here will be nd to be the happiest people in all the world reafter for through them we enter into glory hrough many tribulations we must enter into the kingm of heaven
unto which kingdom the lord his infinite mercy bring us all
amen

finis

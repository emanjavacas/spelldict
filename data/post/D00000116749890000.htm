a letter to a member of the house of commons on a proposal for regulating and advancing the

sir

have read and here give you my thoughts of the proposal you sent me relating to the first it convinces me that without the

experience and information of practical heads men of the best understanding cannot form laws and methods for improving our trade and navigation if what this honest clothier for so take him to be hath offered was improv'd by a law think it would establish and advance the of england more than all the laws made these hundred years
thus far am of the proposer's opinion as it relates to the working part but doubt he is short in his method for preventing the exports of wooll

his expedients for balancing as he calls the exports of from england and ireland seem such as

should think our friends in ireland will think reasonable
there is only two things that want explanation first whether six pence a pound should be charged on that would be equal to a prohibition the commodity not being of value to bear it the other thing to be explain'd is whether this duty should be charg'd by our parliament here or by the parliament of ireland

believe all nations in the world that have heard of our constitution think us the happienst people under heaven the way to keep us so is to secure

our brethren in ireland the right they have to the same constitution
now think the soul of our constitution is that no english man is bound by any law made where he hath not a representative
both kingdoms hold parliaments let us be careful of parliaments by our supporting theirs we secure our own but if either kingdom makes laws for the other we invade the rights of english men by denying them their representatives where laws are made to oblige them

have often admir'd the wisdom of the romans in making the privilege of a roman universal through their whole conquest
the poorest mechanick though in a kingdom governed by their own laws not those of rome yet a roman had the privilege of being try'd according to the roman constitution why should not we that have a better foundation than heathen rome be as good men that is as careful of the rights and liberties of our nation

let us not then consent to have any thing imposed on english men they are that we would not indure our selves
am sure we should not submit to a law made in ireland and

we have nothing to justifie our making laws for them but force which though it may be a good attendent to support righteous laws yet cannot think it a good authority to make them so that are not
the british of ireland hold by the same tenure we do by supporting the annuity of our younger brother we secure the inheritance to our selves
am afraid advancing the power of our parliament to the breaking the rights of another may turn upon our selves
confess my self a votary to parliaments and would therefore have nothing done that might weaken their constitution

own we have reason to the last degree to look to our woollen manufactory and should rather part with all the other trade and commerce of the nation than that yet that should go and my life too rather than my hand should join in that act which breaks in upon the rights and liberties of english men
whilst we preserve that it is our own fault if we secure not our trade and navigation and why should not we by justifiable methods oblige ireland to serve us in both

am humbly of opinion there are ways and room enough to make that island equally profitable to us with all our foreign plantations but then it

must not be by driving out the english in my weak judgment
it hath been always the mistake of england in not giving incouragement for more of our nation to plant there perhaps a thousand families might have grown to a strength that would have prevented the frequent rebellions that have cost the lives of hundred thousands of english men
we must for our own sakes keep ireland out of irish and foreign hands and that we cannot do but by our own people
it would be unnatural to them and dangerous to our selves to establish them in slavery and it is so where men are governed by laws they have no hand in making
the infallible author teacheth us better doctrine where he bids us so

speak and so do as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty that is our right may no hand invade it
am

sir your obliged servant finis

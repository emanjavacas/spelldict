¶Imprinted at London, in Fleetestreate, beneath the Conduite, at the Signe of S. Iohn Euaungelist, by Hugh Iackson.
Do you well to wit that thys Booke profyteth greatly to euery Surgion, for to know in what signe, or in what degree of the signe, the sunne and the moone sitteth euery day in any of the twelue signes, and not only it is profytable to Surgions, but also to Phisitions and to al that vse to giue medicines or laxatiues, or to vse any Bassions, or cutting, or letting of blood.
For as the Sunne passeth through al the twelue Sygnes by the space of a yeare, abyding in a signe thirtie dayes, righte so doth the Moone passe through all the twelue signes, that in thyrty dayes, aabydynge in a Sygne three score howers.
And as the Moone among all Planettes is next the earth in course, so shee hath most effecte of working in these earthly thinges after the disposytion of the nature of the sygns that she hath her course in.
And therefore it is ful necessary truely, to know the state, the course, and the nature of the moone, for thereby a man may know when it is good to begin manye dyuers thinges, when it is not good.
And also what weather is most likely to fal, after the nature of the signs, whether drye or moyst, hote or colde, there shall follow after the nature of the sygne that shee is in.
In dyuers coniunctions of Planets that is ioyned therewith, and therefore naturally in order, purpose me to declare shortly in the sixt Chapiter, the nature and the state of euery signe that shee passeth by.(·.·) ¶Here followeth the Table of this present Booke.

¶Here beginneth the fyrste parte of this Booke, that sheweth dyuers causes how the Pestilence may be ingendred.
Capitulo. i. COn&sydering that thys treatise is very needfull and necessarye agaynst the sicknesse of the pestilence, and for a common wealth health of the Queenes liege people, Thomas Moulton doctour of Diuinitie, of the order of the Frere Preachers, the which for to gather moueth me for diuers causes, the one is prayers of myne owne bretheren.
And another is compassyon that haue of the poore people, that was is destroyed euery day therby, for defaute of helpe.
And the fourth cause that mooueth the most of all, pure conscience, for euery christen man, woma~, is bound by the lawe of conscience, and they know their euen christen in great perril, or that is lykely to fal to great mischiefe, to helpe them if he maye by his wit wyth his trauayle, and with hys goods.
And these foure causes mooued me to compounde and to gather this treatise, and to set it in printe so in english, that euery man both learned and lewde, riche and poore, maye the better vnderstand it, and do therafter.
And so euery man, woman, and chylde to be their own Phisytion in time of neede, agaynst the vengeance and corruption of the pestilence, that now is reigning with other diseases many mo, and this treatise for the pestilence is deuyded, and parted in .iii. partes, and consequently insueth the seuen dayes with the Planets, with the natures and expositions of the xii. signes, deuyded by the .xii. months of the yeare, with the remedyes for many dyuers other diseases that hurteth and greeueth the body of man.
And the fyrst parte of this booke telleth dyuers causes how the pestilence may be gendred.
The seconde part telleth how man, woman and childe, shall preserue and keepe themselues from the pestilence, if so the man woman or chylde be cutable, that falleth therein.
The thyrd parte telleth the remedye, helpe, and medicine agaynst the pestilence.
In the fyrst part say of this treatyse, as tolde, be shewed dyuers causes, which may be the grounde of this Pestilence that nowe reigneth, fynde by the treatinge of fower Doctoures, the fower Pillers that vpholdeth holy church, that is to saye S. Auste~, S. Ierom, S. Gregory, S. Ambrose, where they speke of this matter, they say, that syn that raygneth among the people, and namely that sinne that reigneth among head men, the gouernours of the church, and of the law, is cause of the Pestylence Vengeaunce, taken for synne.
Hereof fynde ensample and Fygure in holy Wryt, in the seconde booke of Kinges, in the .xxiii.
There sheweth holye Writ openlye, that for the sinne of King Dauid, God sent vnto him his Prophet, and gaue him choyse of thre things, whether that he had leuer that GOD should sende vpon him for his sinne, and of his people, hunger seuen yere, or else he had leauer that hee shoulde sende vpon him pursute of enemies, and to be ouercome of them thre moneths, or yet that he had leuer that he should sende vpon him Pestilence three days three nights.
And than King Dauid truly chose Pestylence, so that from that tyme, that he had chosen thus pestile~ce, or it was none of the day, there was dead. xxvii.M. of his people.
And then King Dauid saw that vengeaunce was taken for his sinne by pestylence, mourningly with great sorrow great compassyon of heart, he cryed God almyghtye mercye, and when he had done, anon the pestylence seaced.
And for synne that raigned in the people, hydyous pestilence hath bene taken, as was shewed on Ierusale~, as telleth Vincent in speculo Historiali, Eusebius telleth the same.
Therefore euery man in what degree or what state he be, put away sinne thorough hartily sorrow, and very contricion, asking of good mekely mercy and forgiuenes entyrely, and amending their lyfe, then he putteth away the cause of pestilence, that in case hys vengeance taken for sinne, and sothlye, sauing we ought not to deeme lightly of Gods priuities, this maye be wel one cause of that hydeous pestilence, that now is reigning.
¶And they say generally in thys realme, and truth it is that many tokens are shewed, that men likely deme that this sinne is cause in part of this pestilence, as the corrupt ayre and the venime thereof, the whyche was caused by a co~iunction of Saturn and Iouis, the which Planets their working within fewe yeares, and the malyce of thy complection, and of other sinne, this lefte in the ayre and beneath, the which malice and venime hath his respecte and his influence more in the complection of man then of beast, in as much as the working of ye co~iunction and of other sinne was more principally in the sin of mankynd, then in the sin of another maner of beast.
But the working of other coniunctions dyuers are before hand had their working in the signes of other beastes, thir influence in ye co~plections of the~.
And therefore the malice of the coniunctions was cause whye that the morel fell of such beast, more then of other that time, but this coniunction aforesayd, the which was wrought more principally in the sinne of mankynd, more then of any other, whose venime and malice yet reigning, is the cause of the corruptio~ of the ayre, the which ayr corrupt, is cause of the Pestilence that now is reigning, but neuerthelesse if so that it bee impossyble by: all Phylosophers, that the Elemente of the Ayre, should in hys owne kynde, and in his owne substaunce be corrupt or else infecte, sythen it is symple and cleane is hys substance, wrought without any venome or corruption.
Neuertheles yet by the way of vaporous fumosytyes and humors the which that are corrupt and drawen from the earth beneath, by vertue at tractife of the bodies that bene aboue, minged with the ayre, so by accidentall cause is the ayre corrupt and in part cause of this pestile~ce.
But than thou mayst meue against me, say that if so were that the venemous ayre, and the corruption thereof should be cause of pestilence: or else man, woman, and child, shuld be infect therby, that it semeth euery man, woman and child, should be infect corrupt by the pestilence.
In the countrey there ayre corrupt is reigning, sythen the ayre in such a place is co~mon to al manner of men.
To this answered Auicen in his Canon in the part there he treateth, De cura februm: that if all the pestilence ayre be reygning in a countrey, if it be common to all the inhabitantes of that countrey, yet there shall none be infect therewith, but they that be repleat, and ful of corrupt humours, the which corrupte humoures haue their respect, and acording to receiue the corruption and the venime of the ayre, else in what countrey, or Cittye that such ayre were corrupt or venomed, in al manner of men that receiueth that ayre in the same countrey, or in the same cittye, should be venomed and dead therby, ye see wel and know well, that the Element of the fyre, hath no predomination nor will not bren, but matter that is combustible, and according to receiue fyre.
On the same wyse the Elemente of the ayre that is pestilence corrupt, in fecteth neyther man, woman, nor chylde, but such as haue such venomyd corupt humours within them selfe disposed to the same, the Pestylence thereof in such tyme that such pestilence ayre raignech in.
After dyuersity of venemous humours and corruption in men reigning.
And through the working of that venemous pestilence ayre or diuers sicknes and perillous gendred in man, woman, and chylde.
And this alteracion in kynd, is wrought by the malice influence of the coniuction aforesayd, the which malice of coniunctio~, is likewise to be cause of many other wonderfull alteracions betwixt King and King, Lord and Lorde, man and man, woman, and woman, father sonne, brother and brother, and many other.
Also it is lykely to bee cause of deposing of Lordes out of Lorshippes, and inhaunsing and inhighing of knaues.
And Emperoures of mighty men, spoyling and destroying of Kyngdoms and Lordships.
And also it is lyke to be cause of great fyres, great mists and great water by land.
Also it is lykely to be cause of many wonderful tokenings of great winds, many other wonderful things.
Also destroying of many citties, and principally of the Sarisins sect, and of many other wonderfull sicknesse.
Also the Sismy of holye Churche is lykely to cease, and dyuers states to ende, and therwith many things is lykely to fall, by the iudgement of Astronomy, ye which will not wryte for dyuers causes.
But knowe it well all manner of menne, that these thinges, rehearse not as thinges told by prophesy, but as conclusions following and showing by Astronomy, and also by Astrology, for as declareth Ipocras in his Booke, that he made (De Epidimia) there shall neuer Phisytion be true in working ne sure Practisor of Phisicke, but he work and practise by rules of Astronomy, for Ipocras sayeth, that it is impossible yt a man shall cure a sicknesse, but if he know the cause of hys sicknesse, there is some sycknesse that is caused by mouing and working of the bodyes aboue, the which a man may not know without Astronomy and Astrology, than it seemeth well that it is impossible to a man to cure sicknesse generally, but he can of Astromye and of Astrology.
For as fynde in Lybro Interprecationem, all the fower Elements and al other things beneath, that bene compound of them, are gendred by the course of the planets aboue, and all the lyuely bodyes beneath haue in parte, there being their heale, the sicknesse by the mouing of the bodyes aboue.
¶Here followeth the seconde parte that sheweth how man shuld preserue and keep him from the Pestylence.
THe second parte of this Treatyse is howe thou shalte gouerne and preserue thy selfe from the mallice of the Pestilence ayre, and from the venime corruption that is gendred thereby, the which partye is principall cause of this pestilence that now is reigning.
The fyrst and the principall preseruation there agaynst, is this.
To gouerne thee wel and wiselye, and for to flie al that may gender anye Feuer or Ague.
Fyrst, thou needeth to keepe thee seuerally from all manner of excesse and outrage of meate and drinke, and namely from all manner of Feuores meates, as Gose, Doue, Byrds, Malards, Venison, Lampray, Scate and Eeles.
And also other Feuores meats, eate no great meate, no Onyons, nor leekes, nor garlike, nor no fruite.
For all these gathereth and ingendreth vnkyndlye heates, and so bringeth a man to an ague, he be in any wyse of nigh disposytion thereto, and vse no Bathes nor Stues, sweat not to much, for all openeth the pores of a mans bodye, and maketh the venomous ayre to enter, and for to infect the blood, the spiritual members of man, for to destroy al lyuely spirits in man.
Also keepe thee from haunting of lechery, for that both openeth the pores, and destroyeth the kynde naturall, and also enfeebleth the spirituall members, and the liuely spyrytes of man.
Also in the tyme of pestilence, in no wyse suffer to greate thirst, and if thou thirst, looke thou drink but mesurably, and not but for to slaken thy thirst, and namely such drinkes as wil abate thy heate, as is Tisan water mingled with vyneger, or water of Borage, water of let use, water of Roses, water of Scabious, water of Turmentill, water of Diten mingled in euen portions, or else by them selfe.
For these drinkes if the Pestylence reigne in the heate of the sommer bene profytable, and soueraynly to them that bene colorike of complection, for they be hoater and dryer the~ other, also to slepe on afternones and when thou shalt go to bed, shut thy dores and thy wyndowes close, and in an earthen pan full of Charcole fyre, cast this powder made of these things, of Lorell leaues, dryed Rosemary, and dried Frankensence, of ech of them a like much, cast half page duplicate] page duplicate] a sponeful of this powred in the fyre.
Also vse fyre in thy chamber all the tymes of the day and of the night, of these things, as fyre of Ienoper and if yu may not get this Ienoper, make the fyre of cleane dry Ashe wood and vse to cast in the fyre alwaye Frankense~ce, Storax, Calamint, Lapdanum, and the fumosities of these and the smoke if the aire be corrupt, of the vertue actractiue of ye liuely spirites, and the spiritual members outward by the vaynes of the hearte, and so inuenomes it, these hasteth a man to his death.
But if the nature of the Pestilence be gendred betwixte the thigh and the body, it is a tokening that it commeth from infection of the liuer, than if the matter appere in ye scher beside the priuy members, bleede on the foote in the same side, on the vaine that is betwixt thy great toe, and the nexte toe, for if the botch be drawing thether.
And thou blede on the arme, the matter the~ wil draw vp agayne to the lyuer, and so to the hart that is perrillous.
And if the botch be more outward to the syde, and farther fro~ the preuy members, blede the~ on the vayn betwene the anckle and the foote, the heele, or else on the vayne that is vnder the ankle that is called the Sophem: or else loke yt thou be soone ventused wt a ve~tosing, best beneth the botch, but that is very paynful.
Neuertheles in case that the vayn may not be taken or else that the vayne may not bleed, it must needs be suffred, in such perrill may thou be.
If the matter appeare in the clensing part of the head consyder wel on what syde it appeareth, and bleede on the vayne, or on the arme the which vayne lieth next the Cardiacle, the which Cardiacle lyeth in the midst of the arme, righte in the bouth of the arme, or else blede on the vayne that is on the hande, that is betwixt the thombe and the nexte finger, or else be ventosed betwixt the shoulders.
But take good heede, that when so euer thou haste bled of anye of these vaynes, take good heede that thou sleepe not after thy blood letting of .xiii. howers.
If thou be riche and may well spende, then it were good to haue this Pomamber, euermore in thy hand, hold it to thy nose that thou may receyue the sauour and smel therof, for co~forting of the brayne, (and of all other Spiritual members, the which thou shalte make thus, take Lapdanum, pured one ounce storax, calamint, disolued Roses, Cloues, Maces, of ech one three halfepeny wayght, make the~ in pouder, that ought to be made in pouder, fyue sponeful of oyle debay, an ounce of Virgin waxe, and dissolue them, and when they be dissolued, put all together and myngle them well, vnto they be cold, make thereof a ball the quantitie of a walnutte, and that is called the Pomeamber, the sent or the smell thereof will comforte the lyuely spyrites in man, and if thou rule thee thus as haue taught thee, thou may by the grace of god and by his gouernance preserue thy selfe from the Pestylence.
And here followeth the thyrd parte that sheweth a man be taken with the pestilence, what remedy and medicine is best therfore.
HEre the thyrd parte of this treatise, telleth what is agaynst this sicknesse of the pestylence, that reigneth among the people, and what medicine is best therefore.
Auicen in his Canon on the parte, there hee treateth De dura februm, there is no sicknes that falleth in kind but there is medicine in kynde for it.
Therfore if so be it be taken in due tyme, than if thou shalte fall into this sicknesse, looke that thou be letten blood, as haue told.
And if there be any feuer, or any ague annexed thereto and the corrupt blood be drawne awaye, on this bleeding as haue tolde.
(And the princypall members ventused,) the heart ought then to be comforted with good Letwers, or with colde water stilled, the which Letwers be these, that wil withdraw vnkindlye heates, as conserue of Vyolets, conserue of Borage, conserue of Buglos drawn with suger, decoct with water of Turmentill, water of Endiue, Water of Roses, water of Borage, mingled by euen portion.
And then take these euery daye, euery houre of the day, with water of Turmentil, water of Scabious, water of Vyolets, or else water of Endiue.
Also it were needefull to haue this water distilled of these herbs, of Detan of Scabious of Turmentill, of Vyolets, of Endiue, and Letise, and for to drinke these mingled wt whyte wytte of Gascan, or else of Rochell witte, and namely, the whilst that vnkindly heate reigneth.
Also it were needefull to haue water of Roses, and Byttayne to washe thy temples withall, and thy pulse withal, of thy Arme and thy hands.
And also it were needeful to take of the last, that is to say of Rose, and of and put thereof in a saucer of pewter, or in a siluer pece, chause it of little, and a linnen Cloth .iiij. wide, and were it therein.
And the thou arte in thy great heate of the agrie, lay the linnen cloth were in the water vpon thy temples, vpon thy forehead, and another vpon thy lyuer.
Take also two other clothes lapped and were on the same wyse, and laye in euerie armehole one, and thys practysyng shall doe thee great ease, whether thou bee curable shal lyue, or vncurable, and shall die.
But the moste nedeefull thyng of all, if so he that this were in any wise aforesayde, is for to drawe the botch by craft away fro~ the clensyng place a great space from the hart.
And that shall tell the how, in all my practisyng in Phisicke this .xviij. yeare, wyft it neuer fall but twyse, and that was not long of the medicine.
And one other tyme but of other defautes the which will not wryte, at thys tyme, though it will expell, and vorde it.
And looke in the tyme of pestilence that thy codmares be alway freshlye washen, and after the washing, loke that they be dipped in the fyne water of Roses, and on the same wyse the kerchefe that thou lappest thy heade in on nightes, and let it drye by the fyre: and not by the pestylence ayre.
And when thou layest thee downe to sleepe, lay vnder thy head and vnder the ende of thy pillow that is toward thy vysage, Rosemary, Isope, Souerayn mynts, Perial, Rial, Lorel leaues, put in thy mouth Maces, and Cloues, or else Nutmegges, looke euery day yt thou take of fyne Treacle proued the quantity of a beane, and a half.
Also bere in thy purse these maner of spyces, Maces, Cloues, Duybybes, Canel, or else Cynamon, and chewe thereof, and eate therof all the tymes of the day.
¶And if thou be a poore man, and maye not intende to the costes of these thinges.
Take then euerye daye fastinge, myne syppes in fyne vyneger of whyte wyne, or else of read wyne, and drinke to them a saucer full of Vyneger, or thou passe out of thy house or place.
Also one of the best gouernaunce of all, is in blood letting, for thou shalts vnderstand that a man is in spirytuall members principall, that is for to say, the hart, the liuer, and the brayn, and euery one of these hath his place geuen him by kynde, by the which he may auoyde al such superfluities, and cleare himselfe.
The heart hath his clensing place in the arme hole.
The cleansing place of the lyuer, is betwixt the thigh and the body.
The cleansing place of the brayn, is vnder the eares of the eare rootes, and the throate.
Then this sicknesse of the pestilence commeth thus, when the poores of a man are open, then fyrste entreth the venemous and the corrupt ayre, and as soone as it hath maistry, and mingled with mans blood, then runneth it to the heart, that is roote ground of mans lyfe, for to destroy mankind, and for to infect and destroy all lyuely spirites in a man, and so fynallye for to kill and flea him, but the hearte and the cleane blood, flyeth all that is noyous, contrarious vnto kynd.
And in as much as in him is expelled all such manner of corruption, and venemous from him, to his clensyng place to the armehole: But than for that place is sometyme stopped that it may not out, and it passeth then all the principall member, nexte that is the lyuer for to destroy it.
And then it doth as the heart doth in hys kynde.
And expelleth it from him to his clensing place, betwixte the thigh and the bodye, for it is also spared in case, and stopped it maye not out, but passeth the meates and the vaynes vnto the thyrd principall member, that is the brayne, but then he would expel it to his clensing place that is vnder the eares, and it maye not in case out, therfore the stopping and the sparing of the meates and poores and for thicknesse of the foule and corrupt blood, and the venemous matter is moouing, that is mingled therewith, and thus long tyme the matter is mouing or it resteth in any place, sometyme twelue howers, and sometyme .xxiiij. howers, and somtime more sometyme lesse, after the degree and the gentlenesse, the greatnesse of the sicknes corruptions and venemous that be gendred.
But the~ at the last somtime within .xxiiij. hours, it passeth not out of ye clensing place, nor at no other place thorough bleding, then it festures in some place and cast a ma~ into an ague maketh a botch in some of the three cleansing places, or else nexte to them on some vaine, ye shall well wit that a botche groundeth him euermore and setteth him on a vayne, and letteth the blood that than it may not haue his kynde lye course by the vayne as he shoulde haue, but it is infect thereby.
And so all the principall and spyrituall members are infect, and thus sleieth men.
IN these seuen planets thou oughtst to know that the Sonday hath his doing vnder the Sunne.
that all the true act and operation, ought to be made vnder this Planet and is best it be made on his proper day of the Planet, and the houre proper exempte.

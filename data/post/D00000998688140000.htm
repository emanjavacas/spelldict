my lord

that have preferred so slender a volume to your honorable patronage is no more than

the subject of it which is honor erects as your lordship is known of the first and greatest of those that challenge a concernment therein yet not more eminent by that of your blood then of the inward noblenesse of your vertues whereof the world hath received unmatchable testimonies
these reasons as they oblige me to this presentment so cannot but hope will also plead pardon for the trouble it brings a long with it and that once obtained am

assured of the preservation of this imperfect essay under the powerfull protection of your lordships name of the infinite honorers whereof none is more ambitious to be known such than

my lord your honours most humbly devoted matt

to the reader

reader

the unhappy causes of the present neglect of this most noble knowledge are of so high nature as will not endure to be named the ill consequents in the imminent degenerateness of this age so manifest that they need not
in this declining condition of honour nothing is more requisite then the means of its

preservation amongst which this being one and that not inconsiderable gave me occasion of busying my self in this design

such bookes as have beene already publisht by persons eminent in this kinde are of large bulke and some of them too tedious to the most ingenious student
the more they comprehend the less apt for memory especially when enlarged with tedious impertinencies and doubtlesse more difficult for the apprehension of every reader to which method that is most discernable in brevity is the most excellent help
that which have herein followed is to treat first of the degrees of honour and then of armory and that although concisely yet hope so clearly and fully that any person of ordinary

capacity may hereby be able to blazon a coat of the greatest difficulty the only care being in observing the termes given to things born and the manner of posture and position
some errors have escaped both the press and thegraver which the reader may at his leisure rectifie by the errata at the end so let him peruse seriously and censure modestly and then shal wish him farewell

of honor in generall and of its particular divisions
the heraulds of former ages have many of them not onely divided the nobler sort of men into severall degrees but distinguished likewise the inferiour rank into four forms but as in some other things in that also shall forbear to follow their method as not altogether so pertinent to the intentions of this compilement
it is but an easie caution in me when know not how few shall by my best demerits not to stumble into the hazard of disgusting many by a rash enterprise in a weak endeavour considering especially the present temper of the world

the great and wise disposer of all entities hath contriv'd every thing into such a method as in every particle of the creation is discover'd a most excellent harmony in which that of the degrees and honorary distinctions is as admirable as any and this is the intended scope of this
some he created to honor and some to dishonor a difference and

variety in all things that by a rule of contraries they might the better display themselves
some men he hath richly adorn'd with excellency and elevated them with the sublimary glories of honor nobility and greatness and others again in the same light they shine hath he obscured with contraries of meanness ignobility and indigency
of the latter shall onely say that for them to spurn at the more honorable because themselves are debased to an inferiority is to kick dirt in the face of that infinitely just and wise god of our creation
the first being the intended concernment forbear any farther discourse of the latter

nobility saith sir john fern is thus defined

vir nobilis idem est quod notus ac per omnium or a vulgatus a gentleman or nobleman is he which is known and through the heroical vertues of his life talked of in every man's mouth
in short amongst all men it is defined a certain eminence of some above the rest

this is by the same author distinguished into three species nobility supernaturall nobility naturall and nobility civill or politicall
supernaturall as in the heavenly hierarchies or sacred principalities and that there are orders

and degrees amongst them we must believe or renounce our christianity but leave the further discovery thereof as too sublime to more mature and deliberate contemplations

the second is nobilitas physica or naturall nobility consisting in the great variety of naturall creatures obvious to our human senses

as for example among the planets the sun is the most noble among the elements fire among the plants the cedar among flowers the rose of metalls gold of jems the diamond of fish the dolphin of birds the eagle of beasts the lion and amongst men the king

the last is nobility civill or politicall which onely relates to mankind and though some have distinguished the generality of a into two divisions onely the noble and ignoble the gentry and commonalty yet either part are again subdivided according to the policy of civill government as well as the providence of divine ordination

when first this distinction came amongst us is by some thought uncertain but for my part not
for doubtlesse it hath been continued from the first encrease of mankind in the world for if there were kings and governors certainly other distinctions vertue being still admired and honored and some signall put

upon it and dignitas nobilitas idem sunt dignity or preferment to power is that which makes a man noble

and that there were kings long before the floud as mr selden that excellent master of antiquity is of opinion is evident by those words he inserts which signifie that adam after the propagation of mankind was esteemed

nor onely the father but governor in a kind of royall or monarchicall power during his life and seth his son succeeded him in the like

the jews called such as were in the state of nobiles among them ben ish or filii viri or

the sons of great men and the sons of men of common rank they tearmed sons of men by filiihominis

and the scripture in many places distinguishes men thus as in that of the psalm as

well the sons of great men as of men of common rank both rich and poor together
and this distinction of men hath descended to us with so much severity that our saviour himself gave example in his practise and rule in the charge he left us for it in these words speak not evill of dignities and many other the like
and the civill law hath formerly been so severe in the preserving this distinction that gentle or noble were prohibited the marrying

with the ungentle or ignoble as the ignoble were debarred from any honour or dignity to hinder the evill of introducing mongrell and mechanick dispositions in the and consequently such impostumated humors as is commonly the thereof even among the greatest nobility

the law commanded that in case a guardian being a person of honor having the tuition of a child under age and should marry him to the daughter of an ignoble person it was an injury done to the whole family a penalty should be inflicted upon the guardian the reason for though the husband cannot be ennobled by the wife yet the issue of that male is debased and a mongrel and primogenitus est totius geniturae

quasi splendor gloria and the glory of children are their parents

civill nobility is an excellency of dignity and fame placed in any nation people or blood through the virtues there shewed forth to the profit of that as sir john fern defines it

this he divides into three so ts of tions cities and families

these last are by the greeks termed undefined span alphabet in latin nobiles ingenui and generosi in

french nobles in the empire among the spaniards hiidalgo and gentilhome or gentilhombre and in the old saxon ardel

aristotle maketh four kinds of civill nobility

viz divitiarum generis virtutis disciplinae

cicero attributes the crovvn of generosity to the virtuous and therefore is understood to allow of no other nobility and diogenes was so

cynicall as to term nobleness of blood a vail of lewdness a cloak of sloth and a vizard of cowardice and what would he have said had he liv'd in our age

but to lay by these and many other divisions the philosophy of latter times have refined civill nobility into a triple division

the first by blood the second by merit the third by blood and merit which last without doubt must receive the estimation of the most

honorable
see sir johu fern and mr segar in his honor military and civill
and also by place in the
and bartholus

in the court his words are omnes

principi ideo nobiles cùm nobilitas idem sunt

nobility of blood saith sir john fern is a nobility drawn from the first house and continued through the virtues of those succeeding which the laws and customs of nations have permitted the progeny and kindred to challenge as their inheritance though for no excellency in themselves that enjoy it
and this is the nobility which boetius takes notice of

when he saith nobilitas est quaedam laus proveniens de parentum

now as nobility by blood and merit is justly esteemed the most honorable so certainly this the least the glory they shine in being but the reflection of their ancestors and not their own proper rayes

neither are dignities and discents of blood

enough to ennoble us for whatsoever is not within us cannot justly be called ours but rather the graces and goods of fortune
genus proavos quae non fecimus ipsi vix nostra vaco

and certainly the honor atchieved by an ancestor livs in his family as his and to the memory of his vertues and example of theirs which ought doubly to oblige them to care first in keeping that tenderly which their ancestors purchased so difficulty and to shew themselves the true heirs of such noble spirits in their due imitations of those renowned vertues

therefore it is but vain for a man to boast that he can derive the foundation of his honor from the renowned catalogue of worthy ancestors and himself degenerate from their heroicall virtues for at the best they blaze but another's honor and their own shame and may quickly be answered as hermodius was by iphierates who upbraided him with the stain of so base a parent my house taketh beginning in me but thine taketh end in thy

self

and our nation hath produced too many that deserve the saying of lycurgus whose soldiers bragged much of the nobility of hercules being derived to them he told them hercules's nobility would avail them nothing except they did those things whereby hercules became noble

the second is nobleness of proper virtue

atchieved by merit which is certainly to be esteemed above the other for a country's safety dependeth upon counsell and courage of the virtuous when the boastings of an authentick stock where vertues fail do add nothing to the relief of a in time of need

the romans attired their knights with a ring for faithfulness a buckle for stedfastness and a bracelet for industry as signes of vertue not of sloth the appropriated priviledge of succeeding nobility

and in all nobility author quo primum in signia profecta sunt

homo novus fuit the first atchiever in any stock whatever was a new man ennobled for some demerit sir john fern
and all men will judge him that was the originall of a family more honorable than him that succeeded him two or three descents not adding to that honour by any merit of his own

now these two qualities meeting in one man is it that maketh the perfect gentleman and such a man ought to be preferred before all

others in the receiving of dignity office or rule in the

wherefore by the laws of arms antiently these seven circumstances were regarded in the chioce of a captain or leader his age his virtues his faith or allegiance his knowledge in martiall discipline his authority his good fortune and lastly his blood and gentry
and antiently none were admitted into the inns of court but who were gentlemen of blood be their merits what ever as the foundations of some of do yet shew
therefore it is the best patrimony a father can leave his son to bequeathe him the glory of his merits with the state of gentility and the best honor the son can do to the deceased parent is to continue his name in that estate which his ancestors left him and by imitating the virtues that obtained it to preserve it without a stain

which consideration hath been the occasion to stir up many generous spirits to a noble contention and commendable emulation to exalt

the worthiness of their familie's fame

what those virtues are that must thus ennoble men sir john hath taken too much care think in demonstrating for whose sake shall take as little first he tells you of all the cardinall virtues and then what they are which am so confident as to believe every man understands that knows any thing but shall take up this conclusion as that from them as a true fountain these rivers must flow for there is such a connexion and chain of affinity in these virtues that none may be severed from the rest and that man may be truly said to be virtuous though like as the body is conserved by the nourishment of the four elements or complexions so that the extinguishment of any one of them is destruction to the body yet the constitution of that body is generally tearmed from the predominancy of some one of them that is most erninent in him so the vertues of a man may be esteemed from the paticular discovery of someone more eminent
but if we will make any difference in the merits of atchievment it may be best done in short by taking notice onely of prudence and fortitude from whence that generall opinion of the world that merit was onely by the pike or pen is derived

and though it has ever been a dispute to which of these the precedency should be allowed yet think a little reason will decide it for though there hath been so much of honor allowed in all ages to prudence yet we ever

found the first succession of honor was from the atchievments of fortitude as in the example of the roman statues and at this day the publick example of the shield whereon all both civill and military do illustrate their atchievments which should be enough to end that controversie though some have been very violent in a dispute to prefer the doctor to be before the knight

to obtain estate of gentility by learning and discovering the secrets of heaven is very honorable certainly but to atchieve it by service in his soveraign's wars the defence of the church king and country is of all most excellent and worthy
in which case war is permitted by the law of god taught us by the law of nature and commanded by the laws of all nations

sir william segar when he speaketh of the

nobility allowed to prudence disposeth it in the second place and sir john fern speaking of learning gives it the same onely of all under that genus when the degree of the doctor of divinity differenceth he saith it excelleth all other degrees in learning in four respects first the excellency of the subject it treateth of secondly for the dignity of the matter treating of things beyond reason of philosophy or the reach of human wisdom thirdly the excellency of the end whereunto it is ordained lastly the worthinesse of the author's authority receiving it not from mortall men as all other sciences but from the spirit of god

now a man may be ennobled by leters patent

from his prince though he have not the superior titles added as by the example of jo de king ston who was by patent from richard the second receiv'd into the state of a gentleman as you may see at large in mr selden's titles of honor

as also in another example of hen


by the word nobilitamus creates bernard angeuin a burdelois a gentleman and a latter of james to a hollander

which examples makes him divide honor into nativa and dativa
there were codicilli in the empire by which men were entitled to the honors of nobles

and there have been edicts made in france

for the like ennobling of centry the form whereof mr selden's book sets forth at large

there is a whole title de honorariis condicilliis

in theodosius his code and some laws concerning them as antient as constantine

there is another kind of nobility and that

is called nobilitas adoptiva a gentility arising from adoption when a gentleman of blood and for some speciall affection though neither allyed to his blood or a gentleman otherways adopteth a stranger to be his son and constituteth him to succeed as well in his estate of gentry as to his name and possessions

an example of the like also of great antiquity

in salustius tiberius his formulari

where the greatest part of a gentle family assembling do by consent adopt a stranger that hath well deserved of them to be of their family as if he were descended of a male from among them creating him a gentleman to be reputed de domo agnatione ipsorum and granted him also their arms and limited the whole honour to him and the heirs of his body

but this creation cannot make him a gentleman by birth as it is in spain a proverb the king cannot make an hidal go he may be nobilis but not generosus which mr selden defines to be qui bono genere ortus non degenerat which the dutch have the word for which is in english

but this word generosus hath been in use amongst

us but since the time of hen
since when it hath bin constantly used for a gentleman of what sort soever if he had no title above it the word gentleman being before generally used in the like nature in writs pleadings and the like though they were latine

this word gentleman did first rise from the word gens or gentes which the christians in the primitive times used for all such as were neither jews nor christians which our english translators turn gentiles as the french payens for pagans the dutch heyden or heydenen for heathen
so afterward the same word and gentiles was used in the empire for all such as were not cives romani or provincials

but it is more reasonably resolved that the word gentleman is derived from this origination

that the northern nations framing their words out of latin to make up their provincial or roman tongues so esteemed the word gentilis by which they found themselves styled

in the latine that they now made it in those tongues a distinction or note of honor for such of them as were of more eminent quality ambitious it seems to be honored with that very name with which the romans had before in scorn expressed them
by which means became generally a word amongst the provincialls for nobiles

so that from the word gentil homme

gentilhombre which we received from the french for till the normans we had it not we made out this word gentleman which was before called aedel

this nobilis or gentleman as before we find is a generall denomination for all that come under the notions of honor for indeed it is our vulgar genus for those also that are distinguished by higher titles but to those that are not more properly the species whereof shall a little further look into

of the doctor of divinity spake before the next is the doctor of law which hath also held a dispute of precedency with the knight but to lesse purpose than the other the same reason that held in the major must of necessity in the minor
besides admit the great benefit

and necessity of laws in a for the preserving of peace yet we must acknowledge that the peace which produced those laws was the effect of the sword and neither is peace able to protect those daws nor those laws peace without the assistance of military authority

and so necessary is the profession of arms

that no no city no publick society can subsist without it

aristotle when he speaketh of the constitution of a city in the first place calleth soldiers the true citizens and at the same time faith ea respublica tyrannidem quae fortes saptentes minimè honorat

plato in the institution of his commonwealth appoints one sort of men far more excellent then the rest whose office should be the taking up of arms for the defence of the other citizens to which he allowed many privileges and that they should be more honorable than any other state of people
sir john fern determines thus in artibus militaribus vel in actu indiffer enti data paritate militum

doctorum semper praefertur miles doctori sic de singulis de gradu in gradum

and the same author understands this rule to extend also to the serjeant at law as to the doctor at law

neither can any way derogate in other respects from the honor due to a doctor at law for they are to be preferred in the second place

below a knight that is next the doctor of divinity out of the respect due to the law it self and what respect hath always bin given to it you may see by these of the fathers quid enim

sunt regna nisi latrocinia remotâ quae est legum effectus

and again justitia regentis est utilior

fertilitas solatium pauperum haereditas filiorum sibimetipsi spes futurae beatitudinis
this doctor as well as the doctor of divinity hath for his honor many ceremonies and tokens of honor appropriated to his creation or commencement

as first a book in token of his learning

secondly a habit which is called biretrum bis rectum
thirdly a ring to shew how he is espoused to philosophy and science
fourthly in token he is a doctor he must sit in a chair which hath been thus described it ought to be in the forepart should be painted a of great strength noting labor and love to work and to finish on the hinder part two virgins called care and vigilancy on the right side a well girded carrying in his arms things of small value to signifie the mean estate of wealth and on the left a man running away to shew that the study of science requires a volunary exile from all relations
the fifth ensigne is a girdle about his loyns with these words take this girdle and gird thy loyns with a bond of faith so that thy body may be adorned with all vertues that thou mayst seem before god and man perfect in thy degree

lastly a kiss with these words take the

kiss of peace in token thou shalt ever seek to preserve the bonds of concord in thy faculty

the next place amongst these honors is due to the doctor of physick which being the very perfection of naturall philosophy and from the necessity of it in a is allowed the name of liberall and not mechanicall science
to this profession also is admitted the bearing of arms but in that case the herauld ought always to be carefull to have regard in the designment to the
which bearing of arms is the badge of all honor as in its due place shall be set forth

neither are the rest of the liberall sciences debarred from the like priviledges according to the excellency of the professors
to which is adjoyned poetry which among antients

hath been honored with the style of sacred and poets called prophets by the title of vates

st austine give them this character poetae

theologi dicti fuerunt cùm de diis immortalibus multa scriberent quales orpheus musaeus linus

how they have been honoured of princes is evident in every chronologie amongst which that of alexander is most with homer will sleep with honor will wake homer is a fit companion for alexander
the ensigne usually given to a poet laureat is the swan signifying pureness of style the bird of

venus and consecrated to the muses and sometimes a pegasus as to michael drayton see his tombe in westminster

to this must joyn and indeed should give the precedency to that of painting than

which none hath received more honour in the world though too mechanically slighted amongst us which hath been the reason we have not arrived to that excellency that some other kingdoms have done in it for is the true spurre to perfection

this hath been for its sublimity reckoned with much honour among the liberall sciences by many princes nay pliny calls it plainly a liberall art whose reasons not his own onely

but modern times have approved much reason there is to give it that honour since its performance is by the exact engagement of geometry arithmetick perspective and indeed all points and species of natural philosophy besides the remembrance of the great estimation it was in amongst the grecians whose kings many of them were proud in professing the art

and then the law amongst the romans that no man should undertake it but such as were gentlemen because the brain of a clown must be too durty and muddy to arrive at excellency in it
they were also to be of estate that the labouring for a might not take them off from industrious study for perfection

other examples that princes have given of their delight in it is declared in the ingenuity of francis and emanuel kings of france and

many germane princes since
under which genus wish the ingenuity of our nations like as others would also comprize that species of graving an art too noble to be so much slighted as it is amongst ingenuous men
history also being

esteemed a witnesse of time a light of truth a mistris of life and a messenger of antiquity deserves from its country the gratefull return and reward of its merits

in generall if any person be advanced by

lawfull commission of his prince to any office dignity or publique administration be it either ecclesiasticall military or civill so that the said office comprehends in it dignitatem vel dignitatis titulum he ought to be matriculated into the rank of gentility

in the state ecclesiasticall are patriarchs primates archbishops and bishops all which by custom of the realme and royall grants of princes are invested barons and admitted to the high court of parliament but more of that in its due place
also are admitted to the state of gentility vicars generals guardians of spiritualties deans of cathedralls called episcopi chancellours treasurers and chauntors in every episcopall sea so sir john ferne as also doctors provosts deans and governours of all collegiate assemblies

in the military or marshall government the high constable marshall admiral major general treasurer of the army guardians of frontiers

the master of the horsemen or grand essquire the master of artillery the colonel captain and provost and indeed all that receive commission from their prince

in the civill or politicall estate the chancellour president treasurer judges justices of the secretaries of state mayors provosts and baylifs of incorporate cities and towns
and since from the seat of royalty and majesty all honours do flow it is no reason this fountain should by any restriction be limited neither is it for as before in the discourse of gentility by patent it is signified so there is another sort of gentility made by the prince which as it is by patent ought to have taken place there but being by purchase only and not of merit is esteemed of all the most inferior and therefore to be set in the lowest degree

the king saith sir john ferne may also create a gentleman and give him to

bear although he be unworthy of the same but saith he again est haec quaedam fucata nobilitas non ver a nec essentialis it is but a counterfeit nobility so that this gentility brings the purchaser little more then the shadow of honour to shroud him from the name of plebeian and these gentlemen by the strictnesse of the laws of honour are excluded from the priviledges

of gentility

then saith sir wil segar a simple subject being a gentleman by the prince's grant and does not exercise the qualities beseeming

that dignity ought to be deprived of his title

this consideration made sigismond the emperour answer one soliciting for such honour can said he make thee rich or exempted with priviledges but without virtue or noble desert it lieth not in caesar's power to make a gentleman
and the retort of a gentleman to a knight which my self knew was not amisse being to the same purpose who said it was more honour to be a gentleman and no knight then to be a knight and no centleman the knight being then a knight meerly by purchase without any desert at all in him too many whereof are in our nation
privileges due to gentility
now since others as sir jo
fern and sir wil segar have been so punctuall in discoursing the priviledges due to gentility cannot but touch upon it a little before passe to the next degree of noblenesse which is the esquire
the priviledges as they have laid them down are these

pro honore sustinendo if a churl alias pesant do detract from the honour of a gentleman he hath a remedy in law actione injuriarum but if by one gentleman to another anciently combate was allowed


in crimes of equall constitution a

shall be punished with more favour then a common person provided the be not heresie treason or excessive contumacy


the many observances and ceremonious respects that a gentleman is and ought to be honoured with by the ungentle


in giving evidence a gentlemans attestestation

is to precede a clown's


in election of magistrates and officers by vote the suffrage of a gentleman shall take place of an ignoble person

a gentleman ought to be excused from base services impositions and duties both reall and personall


a gentleman condemned to death ought

not to be hanged but beheaded and his examination taken without torture


to take down the of any gentleman deface his monument or offer violence to ensigne of the deceased noble is as to lay buffits on the face of him alive and punishment is due accordingly

the clown may not challenge a gentleman to combat quia conditione impares

many others there are but it would be too

tedious to insert them referr the reader to sir john ferne his glory of generosity

for the protection and defence also of this civill dignity they have discover'd three lawes provided the first jus agnitionis the right or lawes of discent for the kindred of the father's side the second jus stirpis for the whole family the third jus gentilitatis a

law for the descents in noble families
which tully esteemed the most excllent of which law a gentleman of blood and perfect possessing virtue was only priviledged

to the making of which gentleman perfect in his blood was required a lineall descent on the part of his fathers side from atavus abavus proavus avus and pater and as much on his mothers line then is he not only a gentleman of blood perfect but of ancestors too
the obscurity and neglect of which laws hath introduced other sorts of gentlemen amongst us which are men taking the style of gentleman being neither of blood nor which style only serves to hurry them to an unruly pride when indeed it is but rude and false honour and is by sir john ferne termed apocryphate and debarred of all priviledges of gentility
these gentlemen nomine non re he calls such of the students of the law grooms of the soveraign palace sons of churls made priests or cannons and such as have received degrees in the schools or born office in the city so that by that they are styled by the title of master yet have no right to
as to the student of the law sir john fern allowes him the best assurance of his title of gentleman of all these irregular and untriall gentlemen as he terms them for so much as in some acts of parliament he is named with the title of gentleman yet he saith that he is also debarred from all honor and priviledge of the law of armes

but those students were antiently by customs of the inns of court as shewed before to be weeded out of the societies if by chance any were crept in and none to be admitted but gentlemen of

by which excellent rule the younger sonns of gentlemen would have the priviledges and benefit of that study to maintain and support them as it is in the empire of russia and many other nations when as now every clown that can but pick up so much money at the plough tayle as shall fit his son up for that study receives the benefit and the gentry of the nation frustrated of that support which causes so much decay amongst them that younger sons of gentlemen being thus destitute of imployment are commonly the objects of much pity either for the suffering or doing much evill and the in generall much prejudiced by the insultancy of such mungrell spirits in eminent preferments which they too often come to more by insinuated favour than reall desert and indeed not in that case only but in church preferments also and by this means is it that so much corruption and abuse is the daily leprosie both of the civill and ecclesiasticall state

the romans were so carefull of the preservation

of honor that they had a custom by which the children of noble persons unprovided for should be maintained out of the common treasury which custom though all ages have most infinitely applauded our nation

hath so absolutely exploded that the gentry are in all cases hindred as much as may be of all preferments that should give it them without burthen to the but it is to be hoped succeeding times will produce better manners

of the esquire
the division of these dignities of honour was antiently but into twelve parts but the addition of knight baronet hath made them thirteen the six first only noble as the gentleman esquire knight bacheler knight banneret knight baronet and baron the other seven princely and are allowed crowns and coronets as the viscount earl marquesse duke prince king and emperour
sir john ferne placeth the viscount in the first division but think improperly in regard of his coronet
of the lowest of these enough is said the next is the esquire according to my intended method

the esquire or escuyer is called in latine armiger but more antiently scutiger from the office of bearing a shield as an attendant upon a knight and were militaris ordinis candidati in the field because they served not as knights bachelers nor bachelers which was

then a distinction
the etymology of the word will something signifie as much being from scutum

in latin and undefined span alphabet in the greek which is a shield from the antient way of making it in leather
armiger nuncupatus est qui domini sui bajulat ipsisque cingit saith sir henry spelman in his glossarium
neither came this title in

honorary amongst us till the reign of richard the second though the title as to office was much antienter amongst us yet the antientest mention of it is in

order vitalis speaking of william earl of hereford and odo earl of kent in the time of the conqueror
nam armigeros suos immodicas praedas facientes

dr argentre president of the parliament of

rhemes speaks thus of them esquires are qui scutums ducibus aut patronis praeferebant posteriùs et strateres qui dominos in equos tolleren equos regerent
is qui primus inter coeteros gradus nobilitatis
and verstegen tells us the teutonick word was which is a

but some have since gotten another distinction for the title which is that they are gentlemen bearing arms and armories in testimony of nobility or race from whence they are come

sir edward cook

in his exposition upon the statute of hen
chap
of additions saith that the word esquire armiger or scutiger in legal understanding is derived ab armis quae clypeis gentilitiis honoris insignia gestant
in which sense as a name of estate and degree it was used in divers acts of parliament before the making of that statute and after also

but by this the honour of the title is lost and every gentleman of shall have as great a share in it as themselves which in truth hath not been since the dividing the gentility into these two divisions when this title of esquire was made a legall and appropriated addition

of these there are four sorts by creation

by birth by dignity and by office

esquires by creation are sometimes made by patent as one jo de kingston was by king richard as mentioned before being received into the state of a gentleman and made an esquire

and sometimes by the giving of a collar of ss by the king as an ensigne of the title
eúmve saith sir henry spelman argentatis calcaribus donaverit
which silver spurs were given by the king as the gold was to the knight to difference the honor from whence they are called

there is commonly given to him also an addition to his paternall coat or a new coat if he owned none before which is due to the descendents onely of his body not related to any of his line besides and the eldest son of that

is ever an esquire

esquires by birth are the eldest sons of knights and their eldest sons successively

sir john ferne and sir henry spelman call all esquires that being the sons of lords are not allowed the title of lords but sir henry spelman

again propriè natalitio jure armigeri dicuntur equitum auratorum filii primogeniti

ex ipsis haeredes inperpetuum masculi

those by office are such as bearing high offices in the commonwealth or kings palace have not the augmentation of knighthood or lordship
such are the sergeants at law

sheriffs escheators the sergeant of every office in the court
but these are only the possessors of that dignity it dying with them and not only so but if he lose his office that is a gentleman by office he lo seth his gentility also

and this ennobling by office was also among the saxons and hath so continued among them saith mr lambert if a churle so thrived that he had fully five hides of land of his own a church and a kitchen a and a gate a seat a severall office in the kings hall then was he the theynes right worthy
amongst which sort of esq those four of the kings body are the principall which he saith are to be esteemed above the elder sons of knights
and indeed in all processions of state

they go before the master of the all judges or sergeants at the law

of knighthood in generall and of the knight bacheler
of the distinctions by knighthood there are many in other parts of the world but in england only these knights batchelers knights of the bath knights bannerets and knights baronets and knights of the garter

the word knight as mr selden saith coming from the saxon which signified puer or servus as dienaknecht is yet among the dutch for a
so tenants by knights service were called milites or chivalers

because their service was military
knights saith mr cambden who of our english lawyers are termed also in latin milites and in all nations almost besides took their name of horses
the italians call them cavalari the french chevaliers the germans kutters and our britans in wales margagh all of riding
englishmen only term them knights by a word that in old as also of the german signifieth indifferently a servitour or minister and a lusty young man
hereupon it cometh that in the old written gospels translated into the saxon we read for christs disciples christs leorning knights
and elsewhere for client or vassal
and bracton our ancient civill lawyer maketh mention of rad cnyhts that is who had their

lands with this condition that they should serve their lords on horseback and so by cuting off a piece of the name as our delight is to speak short this name of knight remained with us
but whence it came that our countrymen should in penning the laws and all writings since the norman conquest's time term those knights in latin milites that is souldiers was transferred unto those that conversing near about the princes person bare any of the great offices in the prince's court or train

but with us conceive those were first so called who held any lands or inheritances in fee by this tenure to serve in the war for those lands were tearmed knights fees and those that elsewhere they named feuditary that is tenants in fee were hete called milites that is knights as for example milites regis milites archiepiscopi cantuar
milites comitis rogerii comitis hugonis for that they received those lands or mannors of them with this condition to serve them in the wars and to yield them fealty and homage whereas others who served for pay were simply called solidarii from whence the word soldier and servientes

this title comming to be a reward or degree

of honor is thought to be in imitation of the equestris order in rome to which men were onely advanced for extraordinary virtue and notable merit who onely were admitted to beautifie the caparizons of their horses their

armor with gold from whence they were called equites aurati

in which time all sorts of men were distinguished in their degrees by some garb or habit as some by their clothes some by cutting their hair
the roman knights also were allowed to wear a chain of gold and therefore called torquati from manlius torquatus who wore the first obtained by him in a victory in france which is by us yet imitated in the collar of by which it is easily collected that the true institution of it was a reward of honor and valour not sloath and riches
and therefore all men thus ennobled ought either to be deserving by action before or by endeavour and good service after and to be else esteemed unlawfull possessors of that honor at what rate soever purchased

the first account of ceremonies that we

have at the creating a knight is in the example of king alfred knighting his grandson athelstan and after the continuance of them it seems grew more precise and customary by feasts giving of robes arms spurs and sometimes horse and arms untill our later times produced the new yet usuall ceremony of a stroak over the shoulder with a sword with these words sois chivaler au nom de dieu by the king or some by his commission though the spur hath lately been observed also

another manner of creation there hath been also among the saxons before the conquest

which was by sacred ceremonies shew'd by one

ingulphus that lived in the time of the conquest by a solemn confession a vigil in the church receiving of the sacrament after an offering of the sword on the altar and redemption of it then the bishop abbot or priest putting it on him made him a knight with many prayers called benedictiones ensis

to this order or degree of honor an infant may be admitted though he be a ward and

then till a late act of parliament ordained otherwise his wardship was free both of person and estate but now their lands are not
and there were feudall laws for and at the making the eldest son of a lord a knight as there was also for the marrying of the eldest daughter as in the charter of king john which was mony raised on the tenant
but any man in the order of priesthood is debarred the honor of knighthood of the sword cùm eorum militia sit mundum carnem diabolum
so sir john fern

though find that antiently they have been allowed it but not without first laying aside their spirituall cures and applying themselves to a secular life
so matthew paris dei natalis johannem de gatesden clericum multis ditatum sed omnibus ante expectatum resignatis quia sic oportuit baltheo cinxit militari
and then the persons that gave this honor were sometimes subjects without any superior authority granted to them as well as soveraignes though long since it hath been an appropriated

priviledge of the crown
landfrank

archbishop of canterbury made william the second a knight in his fathers
but the name of bacheler added to it seems not to

have been till the of the third

sir john fern also tells of ensignes that anciently were marks of knighthood as a ring on the thumb a chain of gold and gilt spurrs
all which tokens of his honor he was as carefully to preserve as a captain his banner which according to the rules of arms then if he once lost basely in the field he was of flying any more again till he had regained the same or another from the enemy

to which end it was carefully to be provided

that such men as were endowed with this honor should have these accomplishments he ought to be faithfull and religious just in his engagements valiant in his enterprises obedient to his superiors expert in military affairs watchfull and temperate charitable to the poor free from debauchery not a boaster with his tongue ready to help and defend ladies especially widows and orphans and he ought to be ever in a readinesse with horse and arms and to attend the command of his soveraign in all wars both civill and forrain the neglect where of is a crime as great as to fight against him and merits at the least a shamefull degrading and formerly when the king hath been to make a knight he sate gloriously in his state arrayed in cloth of gold of

the most precious and costly and

crowned with his crown of gold and to every knight he allowed or gave a hundred shillings for his harnessements

and knights in this manner dubbed made

this esteem thereof that in it consisted the guerdon of their virtue and valour the praise of their house and family the memoriall of their stock and linage and lastly the glory of their name

there are many priviledges belonging to that dignity and mr selden speaks of a law that a man was to be punished with the losse of a hand that should strike a knight yet he sayes he remembers no example of the practise of it which think is the greater honor to the dignity as being a shame that any such law should be the guard of a man so honored with arms and appropriated to the sword
against a knight in the war runneth no prescription
the office of a coroner in former times being honorable none were capable of it but a knight

by antient custom none were admitted to

the house of parliament but who were milites gladiis accincti

many other priviledges there were appropriated to them according to the rules of honor and custom of the nation as well as requisites in them which more at large may be understood in sir will
segar's honor military

and civill

where is to be found the severity in degrading them
when if any knight at any time had been corrupted with mony by his prince's enemy or committed any other notable fact against loyalty and honor he was apprehended and caused to be armed from head to foot and on a high scaffold in the church he was

placed and after the priests had sung some funerall psalm as though he had been dead first they took off his helmet to shew his face and so by degrees his whole armor and then the heralds crying out this is a disloyall miscreant with many other ignoble ceremonies he was thrown down the stage with a rope
this he mentions to have been about the time of king arthur
we have many examples of latter times also of degrading knights for dishonorably absenting from the service of the king and other treasons with which seising on all that he had except one horse ne qui dignitate factus est eques cogatur pedes incedere for in all countries the title is related to a horse from serving on horseback and also by

the cutting off their spurrs from their heels taking away his sword reversing his and the like as in the degrading of sir ralph gray
see more at large sir william segar mr selden and sir john fern

figure the creation robe of a knight of ye garter

it is ever to be observed that when the word knight is found without any addition of distinction it is meant by the knight batcheler
of the order of the bath the first that are taken notice of is in who gives an account of made by henry the fourth but mr selden is of an opinion they were long before

mr upton in a manuscript which mr bish a gentleman much deserving of honor from our english gentry hath since very illustrated and published takes notice of this order in these words creantur modis creantur in alio modo milites per balneum qui modus multùm observatur in anglia in regnis
he lived in the time of henry the sixth

the honor is invested with a great deal of noble ceremony as is seen by the example of henry the seventh when he sent writs to divers lords and gentlemen to come up to the making henry his second son knight of the bath ad ordinem militia suscipiendum

juxta antiquam consuetudinem in creatione usitatam

when one is to be made a knight of the bath he comming up to the court is very

nobly received by the officers and nobles of the court where he hath two esquires appointed to wait on him who convey him to a chamber where is to be musick before he commeth to the tubbs then they uncloath him and put him naked into the bath where if

there be any other knights of the order in the court they come in their order and salute him and after discourse concerning the order they sprinkle some of the water on his shoulder and so depart
then the esquires convey him to a bed where he is dryed and then he putting on his clothes they put over them a long gray coat like a hermit's weed with long sleeves and a hood then the knights return to him again and lead him to the chappel where he receives a cup of spiced wine and with that salutes the knights who after leave him there onely with his esquires and priest where he performs a vigill till almost day with prayers and offerings
after this and some repose in his chamber the next morning where are robes provided for him the knights wait on him again and do service to him in his making ready one giving him his doublet another his breeches another combes his head
then with musick he is brought to the hall in the court on horsback accompanied with those knights and esquires where the marshall meets him
then the king comming to the hall commands a lord to put on his right

spur and making a crosse upon his knee rises up and kisses him and so another the left
then the king puts the sword about him himself and smiting him on the shoulder says be a good knight and kisses him
then with the musick he is conducted again to the chappel where he goes to the altar and performs some ceremonies maketh protestation for the performance of the orders of knighthood
then the king's cook comes to him with a knife in his hand to demand his fee and tells him that if he do any thing against the orders of chivalry he will cut his off from his heels
then he is habited in a blew gown with maunches open like a priest and so led again to the hall

the particular manner is more at large set down by sir william segar in his honor military and civill and cambden's britannia
they are distinguished ordinarily by the wearing of a red ribbon cross the left shoulder as knights of the garter by the blew
and have this priviledge above all knights their sons are free from wardship as in the example of the heir of sir thomas wise of essex which was a cause in chancery and the heir victor

of bannerets

this was antiently an order in france and excert that in england they are not created by parent not the title hereditary the same the creation is almost the same with theirs by the solemn delivery of a banner

charged with the arms of him that is to be created and cutting or tearing off the end of

a pennon or streamers to make it square into the shape of a banner are called by some equites vexillarii

sir william segar relates the ceremony thus he is led between two other knights into the presence of the king or generall with his pennon of arms in his hand and there the heralds

declare his merit for which he deserves to be made a knight banneret and thenceforth to display a banner in the field
then the king or generall causes the point of his pennon to be rent off and the new made knight returns to his tent the trumpets sounding before him

a banneret thus made may bear his banner display'd if he be a captain and set his arms thereon as other degrees above him

and although the knight baronet be an honor given by patent and made hereditary

yet by decree of king fames it is established

that all such bannerets as shall be made by the kings majesty his heirs and successors under their standard display'd in an army royall in open war the king personally present for the tearm of the lives of such bannerets shall for ever take place and precedency as well before all other bannerets as the younger sons of viscounts and barons as also before all baronets but not otherwise

and this order was of so great estimation

that divers knights bachelers and esquires served under them which title it seems in many antient writs hath been barronets as in a patent to sir ralph fane a knight banneret under edward the sixt he is called barronettus for bannerettus which title of baronet was not amongst us till king james

of baronet

the title of baronet was erected by king james in the ninth year of his reign he made diverse on the day of may whose patents were all of one form without any difference at all the or argument being for the propagating a plantation in ulster

in ireland to which the aid of these knights

was ordained the words run thus ex certa scientia mero nostris ordinavimus ereximus constituimus creavimus quendam statum gradum dignitatem nomen titulum baronetti anglice of a baronet infra hoc regnum nostrum angliae perpetuis temporibus duraturum
their aid was the maintenance of thirty soldiers in that province for three years
their titles were to descend to the heirs male of their body and to take place before all knights bachelers knights of the bath and knights bannerets the other degree before specified being afterward made and that the name of baronet in all writs commissions and style should be added to his surname and that the addition of sir should precede in all mentionings of his name as the title of lady and madam to the wives of them and their successors and that they should take place according to the priority of the date of their patents inter se and so to their successors
in which patents also the king did engage for himself and successors that there should be but two hundred of them made and that there should be never any degree of honor established that should take place between the baronet and baron and if for want of heirs male the title in any should fall there should never be any created in their room but that the title should diminish to the honour of them remaining and be by that means reduced to a number

and afterward a commission was ordained

under the great seal for filling up the number who had instructions also enacted among which they that desired to be admitted into the dignity of baronets must maintain the number of thirty in ireland for three years after the rate of sterling a day and a years pay to be paid in at the passing of the patent to the exchequer

and again that they must be of good reputation and descended of a at least by the father's side that bare arms and have also a certain yearly revenue of one thousand pounds de claro
they were to take bond also for the true payment of that maintenance and to appoint one particular treasurer for it that it might not come into the king's exchequer

after this many being made it was also ordained

by the king that they and their descendents being of full age should be knighted and that they should in a canton or inescutcheon as they pleased bear the arms of ulster which is argent a sinister hand and gules

there are many other orders of knighthood almost in every nation some appropriated to the country and some of more excellency as is that of the garter whereof in another place shall speak with the rest but these titles have an estimated honor

due to them greater or lesse according to

the quality of the creator for the knight made by the king shall be preferred before a knight made by a prince of meaner title
so all emperors kings and princes acknowledging no lawfull superior may make knights as also some as the state of venice and genoa the popes also sometimes do make knights calling them after their own names as chevaleri de san pedro san paulo
and so much for knights may serve in this place

of barons

this word baron is very variously interpreted

as first that it comes from the word baria in greek which signifies authoritas gravis
bracton interprets it robur belli
again saith sir henry spelman the word baro is the same in latine with vir whose derivation is from vi force and from thence sunt alii potentes sub rege qui dicuntur barones id

est robur belli

and taking of it in that sense we now understand it sir henry spelman calls him cliens

feodalis and vassallus capitalis
hujusmodi sunt saith he qui pagos urbes castra vel eximiam ruris portionem cum jurisdictione acceperunt rege

figure the creation robe of a baron

this word is a generall notion in england to all lords of the great council of parliament as it is in naples and lumbardy where all those lords that are called titulati are in generall styled barons thus dignitas baronalis stat ut genus
this word was used by the

danes in the stead of thane which was among the saxons a title of honor and being next the king he was called the king's thane

and in the laws of william the first instead

of the earl king's thane and middle thane of the saxons times the title of count or earl of baron and of valvasor are used

by which we understand it to have been though not in the same name yet notion a feodall honor of great antiquity sir henry spelman says they were such as had not onely castles towns or great parts of countries in their jurisdiction but they had their valvasores minores conceive for there were then valvasores majores minores milites libere tenentes
which should signifie an honor of command in the

in france germany and italy baronem

vocant qui merum mistumque imperium habet in aliquo castro ex concessione

and it hath been a common opinion that every earldom in times past had under it ten barons and every barony ten knights fees holden of him but those knights fees say other authors were uncertain for number

however we find many barons created in

the times after the comming in of the normans that held both of knights service and of the crown in chief which were either spiritual or temporall and it is certain that all honorary barons from the conquest till the latter time of king john were onely barons by tenure

these spirituall barons were distinguished from the temporall thane in the time of the saxons by holding their lands free from all secular service excepting trinoda necessitas as it was called which was assistance in war in building of bridges and castles
which continued till the fourth year of william the first who then made the bishopricks and abbies

subject to knights service in chief by creation of new tenures and so first turned their possessions into baronies and thereby made them barons of the kingdom by tenure
that all bishops abbots priors and the like that held in chief of the king had their possessions as baronies and were accordingly to do services and to sit in judgment with the rest of the barons in all cases but cases of blood from which they are prohibited by the

this honor of baronady is of three kinds

by tenure by creation and by writ

barons by tenure are the barons spirituall as said before which are reputed peers of the realm and were ever first in nomination and take place on the prince's right hand in parliament and have been capable of temporall

and some of them are accounted count palatines in their jurisdictions

and by tenure temporall which are such as hold their honor castle or mannor as the head of their barony per baroniam which is grand serjanty
by which tenure they ought

to be summoned to parliament
see bracton lib
fol

but he is no lord of the parliament untill he be called by writ to the parliament

these barons by renure in the time of the conqueror and after were very numerous and his time as conceive distinguished into majores minores and summoned accordingly to parliament the majores by immediate writ from the king the others by generall writ from the high sheriff at the king's command

but these had also another distinction which was the first were called onely barons by tenure then and the last tenants in chief which were after quite excluded the parliament as mr cambden says in the reign of henry

the third by a law made that none of the barons should assemble in parliament but such as were summoned by speciall writ from the

king

and that king edward the first summoned always those of antient families that were most wise but omitted their sons after their death if they were not answerable to their parents in understanding

but mr opinion is that not long after the grand charter of king john the law for excluding all tenants in chief was made

from whence came that other dignity of barons by writ the king summoning whom he pleased though he were but a private gentleman or knight as many seculars priors abbots and deacons also all which have been fince omitted that held nothing of the king in chief or grand tenure
this title of baron by writ is by some esteemed onely temporary pro termino parliamenti but that cannot be for the ceremony of his admittance signifies more than a titular or temporary honor which is this he is first brought by the at arms in his soveraign coat to the lord chancellor between two of the youngest barons who bear the robe of a baron there he shews his prescript which the chancellor reads then congratulates him as a baron and invests him with those robes and sends him to take his place
then the writ is delivered to the clerk of the parliament and he by the garter shewed to the barons and placed in the house and from thence is this title allowed him as hereditary

since these two sorts of barons in the time of richard the second hath another been established which is barons by patent and indeed more usuall in our latter times than those by

writ
he first created john de beauchamp steward of the houshold baron of kiderminster to him and his heirs males of his body

and this comming afterwards to be the onely

way of creation they had commonly creationmony granted them as sir ralph botiller who had one hundred marks granted him annuity out of the county of lincoln

some of those minores have yet remained to our memories as the barons of the cinque ports barons of the exchequer and some others which are called barons yet have not the honor such are those that were created by count palatines as the baron of kinderton and some few others
as concerning the descent of this honor and the extension of it it many times descends to heirs female as when there is no speciall entail on the heirs male yet then no husband of that heir female shall enjoy the style and honor in right of his wife unlesse he have issue by her as it was decreed by henry the eighth in the case of mr wimbry for the style of the lord talboyes

neither shall any honor of barony by tenure be conveyed with the of any place from whence the title is derived without licence immediate from the king but all such as shall without is absolutely forfeited and stopt and returns again into that great fount ain

of honor the crown

now though this dignity be not allowed

the princely distinction of a coronet yet is he as a lord of the parliament reckoned among the peers of the realm and priviledged amongst them in all these things as first in all

trialls of criminall causes he is not tried by a jury but a bench of peers

if for treason he be indicted and shall stand mute he shall be convicted but not prest but if it be for felony his standing silent shall not

convict him

upon any tryall of peers the lords that are to give verdict are not like a jury put upon their oaths but upon their honor

a peer of the realm is not to be empannelled

in any jury but what concerns the king's enquiry

neither are they to be arrested by any warrant

of justice of peace either for the peace or good behaviour

neither is he to be put upon his oath upon any appearance he shall make in court but his honor to be esteemed as binding

and whereas all burgesses of the commons

house are sworn to supremacy the barons of the of parliament are not with

many other priviledges

but it is to be noted that by these are onely meant to lords of the parliament not to the sons of dukes marquesses or earls during the life of their fathers
nor to any baron of another kingdom in this though under

the same allegiance who are not triable out of their own kingdome unlesse they enjoy some honor in this

the form of creating a baron is in this manner
the king sitting in state in the first the hetalds by two and two and their garter principall king alone proceed bearing in his hand the patent of creation next to him a baron bearing the robes and then the person to be created followeth betwixt two other barons
being entred the chamber of presence they make their obeysance to the king three times
garter then delivereth the patent to the lord chamberlain of the houshold and he to the king and the king to one of his principall secretaries of state who readeth it and at the word investimus the king putteth on him the baron's robe so soon as the patent is read it is to be delivered to the king who gives it him that is created
then he returning thanks for his great honor withdraws in the same manner he came in the trumpers sounding and so he goes to dinner
where after the second service is gone up the garter with the rest of the heralds cometh neer the table where first pronouncing largesse with a loud voyce he declareth the king's style in latin french and english and then standing somewhat further off pronounceth largesse again with the style of him that is newly created

in which form was william cecill created

lord burghley
of febr
elizab

of the viscount
this word in latin is which is interpreted from the office of the person who was one cui dominus hoc est comes committit vices suas sive gubernationem castri saith sir john ferne

the title is derived from the same order in france which there were only first substitutes to earls till getting themselves first in power got also to have the title honorary and hereditary between the earl and baron it being the same word which signifieth our sheriffe and began not with us till about the
year

of henry the sixth who then created john lord beaumont viscount beaumont by letters patent

though sir john fern tells us of it in the time of henry the first and king stephen and though the elder sons of dukes are styled earls during their fathers life time so the eldest sons of marquesses are styled by their fathers vicounties and baronies and called lords and the younger sons saluted with lord yet it is by only

to this degree is allowed a surcoat mantle

hood and a circulet without either flowers

or points as in the discourse of armory shall

be seen and is created with the same ceremony those above him are

of the count or earl

the next precedency is an earl called in latin comes and thence is an english word count which word comes we have from the example of the romans amongst whom

they used it for the title of sundry offices

coke defines them thus dicuntur comites

quia comitatu five societate nomen sumpserunt qui etiam dici possunt consules a consulendo
but john of salisbury who writ in the time of henry the second says thus comites dici participatione

and the word earl we had from the saxons from whence till we borrowed the word honor we used the word earl for gentle or noble and ethel which was sometimes abridged to el so that of it was and by abbreviation earl which the dutch called eorle

amongst the germans they have the word grave for it as palsgrave landgrave reingrave from the word gerefa by abbreviation gereve and grave as also reve from whence our shierreve or shirriffe as some do

abbreviate it
which word in the teutonick signifies a disposer or director

others have that the word with the saxons was erlig and ethling and used for the

same office of ealderman was before and the

word ealderman which now is writ alderman was transferred to a lower degree who used the word also thegon or thaine for baron as said before
but the word ealderman and ethling it seems did only signifie them according to civill power and the word heretoga from whence hertshog for their military power the former word being no more then

senior or senator

this title of ealdermen continued for duces principes comites untill canutus reign when

the word earl was brought in and the other lost as to that honor

what the jurisdiction of the ealderman in those times was and how absolute or large is to me yet uncertain though large it was doubtlesse because of the severall offices that were under them but as it hath remained since the conquest we find more reasonable satisfaction
their possessions were sometimes the whole territories they derived their title from and sometimes not but some particular or place in it
we find also that both it and thane were honorary and feudall titles

upon the coming in of the normans this word was turned into comes or count since when it hath remained
and this word in the empire was given to quotquot comitatu principis

erant to all that were admitted to society of the prince
so the styled them

in warre commilitones in the court comites

the dignity is of divers kinds for an earl

acknowledging no superior is equall to a prince

this title as it continues since the conquest is either locall or personall
locall as from the denomination of some county or other territory and personall that hath its being in some great office as and the like

those locall are also simplices and palatine

which last retain the same constitution the saxons time allowed them which is juraeregalia or merum mixtum imperium and could make barons under them as those of chester lancaster the bishopricks of durham and ely

hugh lupus had the county palatine of

chester given him by the conquerour ita liberè ad gladium ipse rex tenebat angliam ad coronam
who governed the county forty years he created eight barons and built the abbey of chester

lancaster was made a palatinate by edward the third as says sir william segar and had

barons chancery and seal and so had the bishopricks of durham and ely
the office of those barons being to sit in councell and judgment with the earl

to the county palatine of chester been chamberlains who supplied the place of chancellor justices before whom the

causes that should else belong to the king's bench and common pleas are triable a baron

of the exchequer a sheriffe and other offices proportionably to those of the crown at westminster which being since reserved in the crown is given to the prince of wales when he is created
this county had this honor conceive out of regard to the great trust was reposed in the first earl which was to subdue and keep in order the british or welch after the conquest

of those that are not palatine we find their creation also as ancient as the conquest william theconqueror made alan fergent thenduke

of brittaign earl of richmond by a patent

queen maud created geoffry of mandevile earl of essex aubrey de vere earl of oxford she made earl of cambridge on condition that if he could not enjoy it to chuse oxford barkshire wiltshire or dorsetshire and others of king stephen who is said to have wasted the crown by the many of them that he created
the manner of their ancient patents may be seen in mr selden at large in his titles of honor the modern patents may be also seen there and in sir william segar's honors military and civill
where we find that many times in their patents they had rents annuall granted them and sometimes lands for the supportation of the title
to this degree belongeth a surcoat mantle hood and coronet of gold with points not flowers called

figure the creation robe of a marquesse

circulus aureus a sword and cap of honor
which hath continued ever since edward the sixt being only before but per cincturam gladii
which law was first also used by king john to william de ferrers earl of derby
that personall in england is only of england
the first of these that we find is thomas of mowbray earl of notingham made earl marshall or marescallus angliae for life and after to him and his heirs males of his body by richard the second
but since the
of elizabeth the office hath been only for life again to whom belongs as an ensign of his authority a rod or staffe of gold enamelled at each end with black

of the marquesse

this word marquesse at the first was used to all earls and barons that were lords marchers or lords of frontires and came afterward into a title of speciall dignity between that of duke and earl beginning in the time of richard the second who created robert de vere earl of oxford marquesse of dublin per gladii cincturam circuli aurei suo capiti positionem the form of the patent was then and many ages since very various but it is now regulated to one method which is the same in a manner with that of earl

only the word marchio is put in the place of comes the ceremony of creation much at one and the title hereditary the annuity

money in their patent is forty marks

and here by the way cannot but observe one note of mr seldens that john beaufort earl of somerset modestly refused to be made marquesse of dorset by henry the fourth because the title was then so strange and new in the kingdome

the marquesse is honored with a coronet of gold flurred the points and flowers of equall height whereas of the earls the pearled points are much longer then the flowers
his mantle also doubled ermine as is the earls also but the earls is but of four and the marquesses is of five the doubling of the viscount is to be understood to be but of miniver or plain white fur so is the barons the barons of two the of three doublings

of the duke

this word says sir henry spelman was nomen officiale a title of office afterwards honorary and since feudall and hereditary
he is said to be called duke ducendo from

his leading an army imperiall whom the saxons called hertshog but they are since only dignities given by kings and princes to

figure the creation robe of a duke

men of great blood or excellent merit this title hath been of ancienter standing in the empire and other countries but the first that we find in england is of the black prince created duke of cornwal by edward the third

his father
by which creation according to the tenure of his patent the sons of the kings of england are dukes of cornwall neither is there any creation required for this honor though there is for prince of

where by the way one note is proper to be understood that as he was here created without any ceremony except the girding with a sword so in all other degrees of honor where a lesser degree is conferred on a person of a greater there needs nothing but meer patent without any ceremony of creation
but john son to edward the third being created duke of lancaster had a cap of furre added to the ceremony and succeeding times have had the sword crownet and verge of gold a surcoat mantle and hood and a ducal cap doubled ermin but not indented and is honored with the style of gratious and excellent

these if they be of royall line are reputed

as
it is also allowed that a duke tantum shall take place before any lord that is both marquesse and earl but a duke that is marquesse or earl besides shall precede him

the duke marquesse and earl at their

creation have a sword put over their shoulders which the and baron have not

this title is of neer relation to the other

but not found in any place save in the house of austria the addition of which word arch is from the greek word archos which is as much as princeps in latin
so he taketh place of all other dukes and he is allowed a surcoat a mantle and a hood of crimson velvet at his creation he hath also a chapeau or ducal cap doubled ermin indented with a coronet about the same and an arch of gold with an orbe and verge of gold

of these titles the duke marquesse and

earl are esteemed princely especially the two last these also are allowed to bear their crests with helmets the beaver directly forward whereas a gentleman knight and baron bare them with half the beaver seen

figure the creation robe of the prince of wales

the prince

the next and first immediately subordinate to the crown amongst these radiant stars is the prince who in england onely is the prince of wales the of the king
these in the saxons time were called clitons and clitunculi from undefined span alphabet that is illustrious

but since it hath been a title of creation for honor to the rising sun there were none created in the nation but the king's eldest son who are in all nations honored above all other subjects and amongst some as in spain have been called king's during the life of their fathers

because of his so neer a relation to the crown that if the father dye he is ipso rex there being no interregnum though he be not crowned

in a statute of the second of henry the fourth it is provided that the prince may give his honorable liveries of signes to the lords or to his meniall gentry and that the said lords may wear the same as they wear the kings livery and that the menials of the prince may wear the same as the king's menials but this hath been since abridged

so likewise by a statute of the
of edward

the third chap
it is declared that to compasse or imagine the death of the kings eldest son and heir is crimen laesae majestatis high treason as also to violate the wife of the king's eldest son

and again see coke
part

the prince shineth with the beams of his father and is holden to be one person with him

yet doth he acknowledge a reverence not only as to a father but soveraign and to that

purpose continues that motto which the black prince took up ick dien serve

he is called princeps quia principalis in strenuitate post regem saith sir william segar
the first that we read of in england was edward eldest son of henry the third and after him the eldest son of the king hath been ever by patent and ceremonies of instalment created prince of wales earl of chester and flint being born duke of cornwall
the prince or first born of the king in france is called the dauphin in spain infanta
there are in other countries princes by creation as the prince of piemont the prince of orange and many others but these are also now become hereditary and in some countries all the royall line are styled princes

when he is created he is presented before the king in princely robes who putteth about his neck a sword a cap and coronet over his head a ring on his

middle finger a verge of gold in his hand and his letters patents after they are read

his mantle is once more doubled then the dukes and his coronet of crosses and flowers de luce and his cap of state doubled indented

the king

the king is the next and in our nations the highest being subordinate to no sublunary power as those of spain portugall

and other kingdoms of europe and other parts of the world are
he is the true fountain from whence all these rivulets and swelling streams of honor spring

he is called rex from whence the word rego came and king amongst us from the saxon word koning and kuning
to say any thing of the originall of the government here were in vain for it is unknown onely may say that none can produce any thing to assure any government before it and what spake in the beginning concerning the first

institution of it universally is sufficient besides these times have said enough to that purpose

he hath ever bin of great reverence amongst

these kingdoms of europe the very title carrying divinity in it being of heavenly institution

ordained by god himself the bond of peace and the sword of justice

he is god's vicegerent and to be obeyed accordingly both in church and state if good he is a blessing if bad a judgment
he is styled pater patriae caput reipub and for that the protection of his subjects lies in his breast the militia is annexed to his crown and the sword as well as scepter put into his hand

he hath power of pardoning where the law

condemns even

the things that belongs to justice and peace are annexed to the crown nor can they be separated

the parliament in the behalf of henry the

eighth writ thus to the pope his royall majesty is the head and the very soul of us all his royall majestie's cause is the cause of us all derived from the head upon the members his griefs and injuries are ours we all suffer equally with him

mr camden speaks thus of him the king

is the most excellent part of the commonwealth next unto god he is under no vassallage

he takes his investiture from no man he acknowledges no superior but god

in england france spain denmark and

other kingdoms they are styled kings dei gratia by the grace of god

which hath been an antient custom in these nations in the same or the like words as in

the style of king ethelbald ethelbaldus divina

dispensatione rex merciorum an


kenulphus dei misericordia rex merciorum
beoredus largiente dei gratia rex merciorum

ego edwardus dei gratia rex anglorum

ego wilielmus dei beneficio rex anglorum

and the kings of england since by a bull

from rome in the time of our obedience to the pope have been styled defenders of the faith and by act of parliament of henry the eighth to whom that bull was sent had the title of supream head of the church of england annexed

as the king of france is styled rex francorum christianissimus the king of spain rex catholicus or catholica majestad catholick majesty and the emperor defender of the church

it is the manner of kings also to write in

the plurall number which is god's own style as mandamus volumus facimus
and indeed in the scripture we often find them called gods and in that sense may be styled divi or dii quia dei vicarii dei voce judicant

mr selden speaks thus upon this subject man as a civill creature was directed to this form of subjection as if the sole observation of

nature had necessarily led the affections of men to this kinde of state
whence it is also that while others of the most curious

in philosophy tells us of angells and the supream

heavens being immediately governed by the maker of all things of the planets and other stars being ruled by the sun and the separated souls and the aire being subject to the moon they add together that upon earth kings are in like sort of government as if naturall reason had first ordained them on earth by an unavoidable imitation of the creator's providence used in that institution of government in the ayr starrs and heaven
neither do the antientest gentiles speak of those elder times than with clear supposition of monarchy even in the infancy of the world
and though divers of the chiefest states of the old grecians were in their most flourishing times democracies or optimacies yet the more antient states there were in every place monarchies as is expresly noted

by pausanias
they are honored in all salutations not onely with kissing the hand but bowing the knee also in acknowledgment of their superiority to all

some are of opinion that this kind of salutation came first to rome from the old customes of the asiatick kingdoms
for when the persians meet you may know whether they be equall or not for in salutation they kisse each other but if one be somewhat inferior they kisse onely the cheek but if one be more ignoble he falls down adoring the other and passing by one another he turns his back as

unworthy to look him in the face that is so much above him in honor

the ceremonies at his coronation are many and in england more than any other countries as the annoynting with oyl the sacred consecration which is to no other kings but france sicily and jerusalem and his crown fell on his head with many religious ceremonies which spain portugall aragon and navar have not besides the ensignes of regality which are a ring to signifie his faithfulnesse a bracelet for good works a scepter for justice a sword for vengeance purple to attract reverence and a diadem triumphant to blazon his glory
the ceremony of anointing every one almost understands to have been an
institution as old as the law of god almost for though we find no speciall command in the law delivered for it yet we find examples of it in a continued succession from god's own people and that with the holy oyl with which none by the command in the law were to be anoynted but the priest which oyl never wasted

and that this hath been no innovation

among us is proved by mr selden who makes it appear to be of above a thousand years standing before it was either in the empire or france

though they have had it in france a long

time and they say by divine institution
upon us for their authority the miracle of a dove that brought a vial of holy oyl from heaven to anoynt king clovis the

first about five hundred years since christ which oyle they say hath never wasted

it was the saying of thomas becket archbishop of canterbury inunguntur reges in capite etiam pectore brachiis quod ficat gloriam sanctitatem fortitudinem
kings are annointed on the head to signifie their glory on the breast to their sanctity on their arms to their power
he is crowned with an imperiall crown the crown set on his head by the archbishop of canterbury a prerogative to that see as it is in spain to toledo in france to rheims and in swethen to upsalia

but this imperiall crown hath not been long in use among us though our kings have have had imperiall commands as over scotland ireland man and other yet of ireland they were but lords untill the year of henry the eighth he being notwithstanding as absolute a monarch over it when he was but

lord of ireland as when he was styled king

the crowns formerly were but the same in a manner with that of an earl now

neither is it to be found that any such thing as a diadem was in use at all till the time of constantine great the distinction before being some kind of chaplet or which

is most certain a white silk fillet about the brows which was an ordinary way to distinguish them as have my self seen statues of the emperor with such a kind of fillet about the head

from whence is that which we read that alexander the great took off his white diadem to cure the madness of seleucus
the first that was crowned with this kind of imperiall crown floryed and arched was henry the third say some but others henry the first and indeed it is left disputable to me so by me to others
however it is very probable and plain that the antientest ensign of regall authority was the scepter which is every where spoken of both in the scriptures and profane stories

there is another ensign of their authority which is a globe with a cross in use amongst us ever since edward the confessor which is placed in the left hand as is seen in most of their coyns the cross denoting his faith and the globe his empire both by sea and

land as it is said of justinian who was the first emperor that ever had it

at the coronation of the emperor it is carried by the count palatine of the rhine where they call it pomum imperiale

this power dignity and state hath been enjoyed by the female sex as heirs descending by the common right of inheritance and not

onely in our parts but many others as at this day in swethen when there is not the least punctilio of a diminution in respect of the sex
besides for an addition to the honor of a king there is the same state allowed to a queen during the life of her husband as to a queen absolute almost and is allowed a crown
she is called queen from the saxon word cuningine as king from cuning onely by variation of the gender as it was their manner in such cases

she is permitted to sit in state at the king's

right hand and to keep a court distinct from the king although she be but the daughter of an earl
but this was in the time of king edgbert prohibited and so for a long time continued by reason of eadburgh who poysoned her husband king brithick of the
and if she be the daughter of a king superior to her husband she may retain the

dignity of her father's daughter and in this case the daughter hath preceded the mother

and although in these latter times our monarchy hath been reduced under the circumference of one crown imperiall no others having any other substitute governors crowned yet formerly both scotland and ireland had king's distinct whilst they acknowledged homage to the crown of england as also the isles of man and wight

the kings of man were first subject to the

kings of norway then to the crown of england and after to the kings of scotland and since again to the kings of england
dominus

hujus insulae rex vocatur cui fas est corona aurea coronari
the lord of the isle is called king and it is lawfull for him to be crowned with a crown of gold

henry the second allowed with the same honor

roderig of conaght to be king paying a homagery tribute

the lord beauchamp earl of warwick under henry the sixth was in the like manner crowned king of the isle of wight
which is enough in this place as to the dignity of a king

of the emperor

the originall of this title as it was long amongst the romans denoted onely a generall of an army and not till the time of julius caesar translated to an honorary title who being made perpetuall dictator took also that of imperator into his title which hath continued in his successors untill this day and became superior to the title of king that before was but substitute under it being

yearly created in january and ended in september
which great change hapned upon the victory of caesar against pompey at the battle of pharsalia

this title was onely taken up to supply that of king which had not long before been

thrown out by brutus and was supposed by the usurper to be yet fresh in their memories and odious amongst them and it was long after before they used the title of king though their power were as much and the ceremonies and ensignes of regality the same and the emperor's throne at rome was

called sedile regni
but at last it grew to be as one and then the emperor of rome having subjected under his jurisdiction many kingdoms thought it however a title of more eminence and so retained it
and though the title has not been so generally appropriated

to our crown yet our kings have been styled emperors and this realm of england called an empire
so have the kings of spain and france

but it is more peculiarly allowed or assumed by the emperors of germany who suppose that they have a right to the government of the whole world

this empire after it was divided to constantinople and rome and then again that constantinople had lost it to the turks it was removed to germany and in the reign of otho the third the election granted to seven princes of germany the archbishops of mentz trevers cullen the count palatine of rhine the duke of

saxony the marquesse brandenburgh and the king of bohemia then called duke of bohemia

he hath had also the superiority allowed him by all secular princes and whereas other princes of regall authority are crowned with but one crown he is with three the first of iron which he receives of the bishop of cullen at aquisgrane the second of silver which he receives at modena from the bishop of millan the third is of gold wherewith he is crowned at rome by the pope

and in latter ages the title of king of the romans is given to the heir or him that is made or chosen heir of the empire and he is crowned and jura regalia given him though not so absolute as not to have a dependence on the empire
see mr selden part
chap
the ensignes of his imperiall dignity are a crosse a launce and a sword a scepter a mond and a crown and he is styled

the emperor of russia is not crowned but is adorned with a rich cap of purple neither is the greek sultan but vested with a mighty rich tulipant
but there though

the emperor have no diadem yet the sultanesse is adorned with a rich crown or diadem

thus have run through all the degrees of honor and with as much brevity as so copious a theam would allow of and for matter of precedency think the method have taken will save me the labour and am

unwilling to trouble the brains of the ingenuous reader with an unnecessary prolixity onely as to offices of state because have omitted them altogether shall set down their places as in princely solemnities they are to be disposed
in which those of the crown are to precede all other of the nobility that are not except the blood royall

as the lord chancellor
lord treasurer
lord president of the privy councel
lord privy seal

these six also are placed next the lord privy seal thus according to their state of dignity that is if he be a baron to sit above all barons if an earl above all earls

lord great chamberlain of england
lord high constable of england
lord marshall of england
lord admirall of england
lord great master or steward of the king's house
lord chamberlain of the king's house

so the king's principall secretary being a

baron of the parliament hath place above all barons and if he be of a higher degree according to the former rule

the spirituall nobility are thus placed

the archbishop of canterbury
the archbishop of york

bishop of london
bishop of durham
bishop of winchester

the two first are placed according to ancient dignity and the three last by act of parliament and the rest of the bishops to take their places according to the seniority of consecration
segar lib
cap

by an act of parliament an

hen
see the act in mr selden's titles of honor
so all men serving near unto the prince's person either civil or military are allowed a precedency in pari dignitate and themselves according to his seniority of place
as to their precedency otherwise dukes marquesses earls viscounts and barons are to take their places according to the antiquity of their title and their ancestor's creation and their wives accordingly

a duke's eldest son takes place as a marquesle but beneath him and his wife beneath a marchionesse and if she be the daughter and heir of a duke she shall go before all

duke's eldest sons wives and however are equall to a marchionesse but to go beneath them and the younger sons of dukes are in equall degree with an earl but to go beneath him and marquesles eldest sons and their ladies to take place accordingly

so the eldest son of a marquesse as an earl and the younger as viscounts and their ladies and sisters to take place accordingly as before

an earl's eldest son takes place as a youngest viscount and the younger as barons their wives and sisters accordingly viscounts eldest sons as barons and their youngest sons to take place with barons eldest sons above

knights baronets by an act of king james and above all bannerets but those made by the king himself under the stander and all knights batchelers

of women

now lest should be thought malitious to a sex owe much honor to before conclude shall take some short observations more then already have
and first that although they are not allowed to sit in parliament yet do they enjoy almost all priviledges

due to the other sex

the honorable feminine dignities are

princesse dutchesse marchionesse countesse vicountesse and baronesse
which are either by creation by descent or by marriage

this honor by creation as it is rare amongst us so it is more rarely taken notice of though

many examples have been as richard the second created margaret countesse of norfolk into the title of dutchess of norfolk see the charter in mr selden
anne bullen was created marchionesse of pembrook by hen
limited to her and the heirs males of her body to be

begotten with of twenty five pounds per annum and the ceremony of mantle and coronet

the lady finch was by king james created vicountesse of maidston to her and her heirs of her body with speciall clause that her heirs male should have a voice in parliament and afterward she was likewise made countesse of winchester

of these titles thus conferred sir john

fern takes no notice though else he discourses largely enough

by descent we have continuall examples when any daughter of an earl or vicount shall continue a virgin or marry an esquire she shall retain that honor that springs from her father's blood take place according and be saluted by the title of lady

which word lady came from hleafdian or leafdian by contraction in the teutonick and so lafdy and thence lady as from

laford lord
the word laf signifying bread

and dian serve
it seems from that they called those persons that for their quality could entertain others and distribute corn and bread to their neighbours by that title

and of old though in the empire and here the word dominus was used in generall for salutation amongst men of all sorts yet domina onely to persons of honor amongst

women as the widows of all tenants in chief and daughters and heirs of all knights

the heirs females of any count or baron

shall enjoy both the estate divided and titles too if they be to be divided and they shall be enjoyed by their husbands if they marry in the right of their wives

so that if there be two or three or more sisters to share the estate and the honors and dignities inherent be enough they shall enjoy every one one as in the case of the earldom of pembrooke in the time of edward the third and now the lord darcy of the north by the same right enjoys the title of the lord conyers
but this holds not when the title is held by jus gladii or knight's service or if the honor be in any castle or place onely it cannot be divided but falls and dissolves in the crown or left to the disposing of the king
and again if the estate of honor and dignity be not descending to the heirs generall but entail'd to the heirs male it cannot be the inheritance of a daughter as many times it is

but we may understand this the better by that more eminent demonstration of high offices of the kingdom which descending by inheritance on the heirs generall have been challenged by the husbands of heirs female in right of their wives the failing as in the case of the duke of buckingham in the time of henry the eighth challenging the

office of of england

the office of lord steward descended to blaunch daughter of hen earl of lancaster in whose right joh of gaunt her husband enjoy'd it
so the office of earl marshall descended to the house of norfolk by an heir female afterward being forfeited by treason was conferred to the lords howards of arundell
and in this and all such descents where there are not dignities enough to allow a partition to all the sisters but the honor shall be undividable it shall descend to the eldest or be disposed by the king to which he please

and for ennobling by birth these rules are observed that if a gentleman knight or baron do marry a wife of ignoble parents she shall enjoy the title name and dignity of her husband for saith sir john fern let the wife

be shining and glorious with the dignities of her husband whereas on the contrary if a gentlewoman of blood and shall marry a francklin yeoman or the like that

is ignoble having no his condition is no whit advanced by marriage in point

of honor although let him be inferior to her

whom she shall marry yet she shall retain the honor state and dignity she was born to

but there is this law for them to walk by too that is si mulier nobilis nupserit ignobili desinit esse nobilis that is if a marry with an ignoble her nobility is extinguished for she is under the power of her husband and ought not to be in a condition above him for example whereof a case is cited of one ralph hayward esquire and the lady anne

powes widow of the lord powes

but am of opinion that being onely an acception in court by the adversary of the party this is not to be understood but in case the person such a noble:woman shall marry be no gentleman and that she hath received the honor she enjoyed before from the right of a former husband and not by descent of ancestors for the words of judge

coke run thus si mulier nobilis nupserit ignobili desinit esse nobilis eodem modo quo quidem constituitur dissolvitur that is if a shall marry an ignoble husband she ceases to be noble and in the same manner her honor was constituted it is dissolved

so as by the laws of the nation an adulteresse forfeiteth her dower so also her honor of nobility if she commit adultery either as a wife or widow or else having received honor from her deceased husband and shall so put him out of her mind as to subject her self to

another by which act she wipeth both the name and memory of the former from her she hath the sentence of forfeiture against her
so sir john fern in his glory of generosity fol
yet the law is thus curious in preserving the memory of vertue in the honor of its reward that if a woman of noble blood do marry a churl or clown and have issue by him she being an heir that issue shall have liberty of bearing her
but sir john fern says onely for life and that on a lozenge shield which is the feminine bearing with the difference of a

one note more think proper in this place which is if a french spanish or german woman be married to any peer of this realm or other gentleman and be not denizoned by

the laws of the nation she cannot claim the priviledges or titles of her husband nor have dower or joynter from him

and thus much think sufficient in this place as to the honor of women and if have said too little wish could have said more if too much beg their pardons but refer my self to the law

in the next place should proceed to the display of armory by which the infinite number of persons are distinguisht by an innumerable variety of different ensignes that do illustrate and appropriate their dignity and honor but by the way have stumbled on another theam which though it be not

so much concerned in honor yet the kingdom is much concerned in it as a power and though need not say much yet cannot passe by it and say nothing

of a parliament
some not altogether knowing of that true constitution of a parliament may be apt to think that its authority is onely supream in this nation
but let such understand that from this argument if there were none other it is disproved that nothing can be made greater or more excellent than the thing that makes it propter quod unumquodque tale est illud majus tale
and such creatures as shall aim at a superiority to their creator are to be esteemed like those angels that by the same spirit attempting the same pride precipitated themselves from everlasting liberty to eternall chains

this great council did arise from the antient custom of not onely the saxons but all nations in the world almost who have had examples of their king's summoning the chief peers and nobles to consult in weighty affairs
which councel among the saxons was called which was a

meeting of the chief prelates and peers to deliberate about and to consent to what

laws the king should enact and advising in matters of state giving judgement upon suits or complaints in the same court as is understood of the time of king ine of west sexe about
years after christ

and again of king ethelbert his ordaining

decreta judiciorum juxta exempla romanorum cum consilio sapientum
and when edwin king of northumberland was perswaded to be a christian he consulted cum principibus

consulariis suis
he called to councell his princes or ealdermen and counsellors

and again king eldred an

in festo nativitatis beatae mariae all the nobility of the kingdome were summoned by an edict from the king as well bishops and abbots as all of the rest of the lords and chief counsellors thanes and ealdormen to come to london to a or great councel to consult about affairs of the whole kingdome as ingulphus his words are

and again in the time of edward the confessor

the parliament sate at london rex omnes magnates in which parliament the king attaches earl godwin for that he had kil'd his brother alfred and upon his pleading and submission the king refers him to the judgement of the court who a long while debating it to no purpose at last leofricus consul cestriae probus homo quoad deum seculum saith the author spake thus earl godwin is a gallant person and a man next

the king of the best birth in the land and it cannot be denied but by his counsell or design alfred was slain therefore my opinion is that he with his son and all we twelve earls that are his friends and kindred do present our selves humbly before the king loaden with as much gold and silver as every man can carry betwixt his arms to offer it up with supplication for an expiation of the crime
which being consented unto and done the king considering the reference he had made to the court ratified their act and his pardon

by which we see their meetings was at the kings summons their power only deliberative in giving legall force by consenting to what he should think fit to make a law and to advise de arduis reipub not that this force given by them is to be understood otherwise than that because it was enacted by their consent it was the more binding over them their consent otherwise being no whit binding over the soveraign's will in the enaction for it was his volumus that made it and let their consultations rise to never so powerfull votes and results be the thing what it would his nolumus buried it in oblivion which custom ever continued as a true prerogative of the crown
nay avisera le roy which is but the king will consider of it was enough to throw a bill out of the house
nothing enacted by them though by a generall consent

of both houses of lords commons being of any force and that not only before but after the commons were brought in which find to be about the time of edw
his third year of inauguration

an
dom
who in the
year of his reign confirmed the magna charta made by henry the third though mr selden is of opinion the first summoning of the commons was in the
year of henry the third

the style of the statutes running after this manner the king hath ordained and established these acts underwritten
first the king willeth and commandeth that signifying the power of enacting to force and penalty was derived from the volumus of the king not the vote of the lords and commons their consent only making it of more vigour against themselves

if it were an act of indulgence or relief to

the it run thus our lord the king of his speciall grace and for the affection that he bears unto his prelates earls and barons and others of his realm hath granted that
and sometimes our soveraign

lord the king hath granted and commanded at the instance of the nobles of this realm
no mention at all being made of the consent of the lords and commons

then afterwards thus they run our lord the king by the counsel of his prelats earls barons other great men nobles of his kingdom in his parliament hath ordained

an

edward the first
and so along in other statutes the commons not at all mentioned in the enacting any statute but as thus in the beginning of edward the third at the request of the commons of this realm by their petition made before him and his councel in the parliament by the assent of the prelates earls and barons untill the
of this kings reign in a statute of labourers find the commons not mentioned and then the power of ordination given to the statute still by the king as thus it is ordered by our lord the king by the assent of the prelates farls barons and other great men and all the commons of the realm summoned to this parliament

and in one act of the same king the style runs thus the king of his own will without motion of the great men or commons hath granted and ordained in ease of his people

and then to signifie the constitution of the

commons in parliament see the
of edward the third where the statute runs thus the king at his parliament at the request of

the commons and by the assent of the prelates dukes earls and barons and other great men there assembled hath ordained and at the prayer of the commons
in which style most of the statutes run untill henry the eight

and for provision of the choyce of the commons in a statute of the
of hen
is set down the form of writ by which they are summoned where it is also enacted that the

knights of the shires for parliament hereafter to be chosen shall be naturall knights or otherwise

such naturall esquires or gentlemen of the same county as shall be to be knights

and every knight that is elected ought to be a resident of the place for which he is elected and every man that is an elector ought to have forty shillings of within the said county and for the security of it the sheriffe hath power to put them to an oath

upon the evangelist and the election ought to be betwixt the hours of eight and nine in the forenoon and so of burgesses

the form of the writ is this rex vic salutem quia nostri pro quibusdam arduis ur gentibus negotiis nos statum defensionem regni nostri angliae ecclesiae anglicanae concernent quoddam parliamentum nostrum westm

die novemb proxim futur teneri ordinavimus ibidem magnatibus proceribus domus regni nostri colloquium habere tractare tibi praecipimus firmiter injungentes quod facta proclamatione in proximo tuo post receptionem hujus literis nostris tenend die loco predicto duos milites gladiis cinctis magis idoneos discret com praedict electionem illam in distincte

apertè sigillo tuo sub sigillis eorum qui electioni illi bis in cancellaria nostra locum certisices
and still before they came up to the house

they signed indentures to be true and faithfull to their king and country and the service thereof upon a penalty even to the last long parliament of eternall infamy

and in the third of queen elizabeth it was enacted in full parliament for the safety of the queen's majesty her heirs and successors and the dignity of the imperiall crown of england for the avoiding both of such hurts perills dishonor and inconveniencies as have before time befallen that not only all persons should take the oath of supremacy upon divers penalties in that act specified but also every knight citizen and burgesse of the parliament should take the said oath before he entred into the said house or had any voyce there else he should be deemed no knight citizen or burgesse for that parliament nor have any voyce but shall be to all intents constructions and purposes as if he had never been returned nor elected for that parliament and shall suffer all pains and penalties as if he had presumed to sit in the same without election return or authority
and by king james the oath of allegiance was added
yet notwithstanding all this limitation upon the commonalty parliaments in england were ever esteemed since magna charta the greatest liberty of the subject none else indeed being dreamt of

and as it is as great a flower of the crown to summon parliaments as foedera bellum

indicere to make war and leagues which is so absolute that it is resolved by all the judges of

the land that the king may before he is crowned if by descent the crown be his right summon a parliament or within age as was seen in king henry the sixth who summoned divers parliaments in his
years of his reign yet was not crowned till the eighth
he being then essentially king

without any ceremony or act ex post facto and coronation but a royall ornament

so the priviledges of parliament and of the by parliament are as great for though we thus see the great prerogative of a king yet many things there are which a king in his own kingdome cannot do without a parliament by the laws by which he hath

bound himself as the making any man hereditable or the altering the common law or customs of the realm though by his absolute

authority he may commit any man to prison during his pleasure

therefore every during the time of the parliament is priviledged from

all disturbance of arrest for debt or the like and the servants of any parliament man as much as the kings are

and to this parliament for the further security of the good of the were ever admitted certain judges of the land though they had no vote which sate on woolsacks that as the clergy in spiritualties

so the judges of the law in things of the law were to advise and determine when any difficulty did arise
that what laws should be enacted might be answerable to the will of god and not repugnable to the customs of the land

and in our latter times all acts of parliament though made by the king have this style by the consent of lords and commons notwithstanding the civill law saith quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem the will of the king is the power of the law

the end of honor

the analysis of armory
have with as much brevity as so copious a theam would admit run through all the distinctions of honor
in the next place shall with as great a contraction lay down the emblems of those distinctions and atchievements due to nobility and the reward of virtue in the methodicall rules of armory
bearing of arms at this time being the only externall distinction of degrees and qualities amongst all civill societies and
from whence we received this custom is uncertain if especially we look to the producing of it into rule and form as it is from imitation sir john fern is of opinion that we did borrow it from the egyptians meaning from their hieroglyphicks

others will have that the first institution of these honorable differences was amongst the israelites but however it is not much material to this discourse to be too inquisitive of the

originall in that kind since succession of time hath converted it into another custom which may be for ought know in imitation of the romans who were accustomed upon triumphs or festivalls to produce the statues of their ancestors as the pedigree of their generous race

which statues were not as some may imagine erected from the voluntary phansie of the parties represented as is the leaving our pictures behind us when we dye to our progeny so might every phlegmatick mechanick do but they were such as were for some heroick act allowed as a publick reward of virtue which was customary amongst them
and truly although every good subject ought to be alwayes prepared alike to offer his body and mind unto the service of the without hope or expectation of mercenary reward honor or glory yet is honor a necessary perquisite to a crown and being in it self a true spur to generosity
out of which respect the romans joyned the two temples of honor and virtue in such a manner that no man could enter into that of honor without first passing through the other of virtue

sir john ferns opinion is that the first that imployed these ensignes in this nature was alexander the great so to distinguish those

that had done any memorable acts that they might urge an emulation in their fellow souldiers

it is said of epaminondas and othraydes that being ready to dye they wrote their glorious exployts upon their shields themselves to give to others to follow their when they were dead
believes that charls the great was the first that put them into this methodicall order which doubtlesse could not be if as sir john fern saith also that julius caesar constituted an office of feciales
but find it in another author to be instituted by numa when he made warre upon the fidenates a people of latium

however it is a generall opinion amongst our most judicious heralds that the bearing of arms as a badge of honor amongst us was not till about the time of henry the third although many coats have been in some writers of much longer standing as that of hugh lupus earl of chester in the time of the conqueror a woolfs head errased of gilbert de gaunt earl of kime long before barry of
or az over all a bend gule
which are of by sir john fern but how authentick his authority might have been to him to cause his insertion or his to others know not but shall be bold to insert one which may chance carry some weight with it which shall raise from a noble family in the

north the family of the hiltons whose antiquity not only by an ancient pedegree which have seen taken out of the office but by the records of the tower doth produce the noblest descent that know any family in england the pedegree is too large to be inserted in this place else would do it however shall extract some notes from it that may signifie as much

the first that find recorded of the family was sir william hilton knight who marrying the daughter of sir john grisly knight a family long since think extinct had issue adam hilton which adam living in the time of king athelstan gave to the monastery of hartlepool a pix or crucifix which was in weight twenty five ounces of silver and caused his armes to be engraven on it arg two barres azure which are yet seen upon the gate of hilton castle in the bishopr of dur where they lived with a moses head for creast the gate and the chappel which is very stately for its structure and bignesse are the only parts remaining of the ancient building
he gave unto the same monastery a cope vestment with the stole and the like gift unto the two monasteries of whitby and gisbrough with fifty seven ounces of silver to make censors
they were five descents before the conquest and hath now the nine and twentieth descent surviving
in which line were twenty four knights eighteen whereof were in a continued succession

but leave this nicety to more criticall judgments to determine the thing having for authority custom sufficient to make it a law within it self without the derivation of any originall institution
former ages having esteemed the laws of heraldry with as great a veneration as any in the nation as indeed it ought still to be and more especially in these and all such times as ours the court of heraldry being not onely the to honor but the best record of families and inheritances though the gentry of this land are too dull to know it since hath been hereditary as it hath ever since the time of lewis according to the account of sir john fern and guillim as by one instance shall declare if a man being an orphan and by such times as ours have been the records of what estate did rightly belong to him and from his ancestors may be burnt plundered or otherwise embeselled and by such spirits as such times do plentifully afford have been obtruded from his right and hath nothing to plead for it this office being the just record of his pedigree would produce an evidence sufficient though from many generations his misfortunes have descended more particularly of the office in another place

as for the progresse of armory have pitcht upon the most methodicall course could disposing it into severall divisions

and to every division adding its varieties as in the succeeding scutcheons will appear that have crowded many severals into one scutcheon is to contract the generall into lesser bulk

the form of placing the devices of arms on escutcheons is from the antient shields and therefore called an escutcheon from the word scutum
they are also called coats of arms from the custome of the antients embroidering their devises on the coats they wore over their arms
for the form or rules for the shape of shields there can be none for any form that a shield may be devised into may be taken for the shape of an escutcheon
and next for the rules of blazoning there are not many but every thing to be called according to their denomination excepting such as by antiquity have continued other names then our vulgar language doth now give
and again observing a method from their severall postures and positions in the shield which gives a severall tearm and must be very carefully regarded for the adding or diminishing the least punctilio makes the coat so much another thing that should another man own it he could not be question'd for it

and although sir john fern gives this definition of it blazonia est recitatio vel commemoratio alicujus virtutis quempiam sub quibusdam

abunde vere laudare aut decorum dicere yet our latter times have prescribed a rule of avoiding in any case of blazoning as much as may be multiplicity of words especially such as are impertinent this is also

called martialling a coat though that is a word by some esteemed onely to be used when many coats are disposed or quartered in one shield

iterations of words are also to be avoided and in blazoning a coat the field must ever be first exprest and then the charge and in that what possesseth the greatest part or nearest the center of the shield first

as for the diversity of kinds of blazon though by no greater authority than custom of some men there is three made by colours

and metals pretious stones and planets the manner of blazoning thereby making a distinction betwixt private gentlemen persons ennobled with dignity and royall families

fenne jacynth dragon's head

sanguin sardonix dragon's tail

but this is onely a fantastick humor of our nation and for my part shall avoid it as ridiculous being no where in the world used but here and not here by any judicious herald
that insert it it is to leave it to those humors that will make use of it

for the order according to the antient rule have first begun with metalls and colours to which have adjoyned the the parts of the escutcheon distinction of families bordures and crooked lines because from them the honorable ordinaries receive a various form and nomination
then have set down in one escutcheon all the ordinaries which are afterward in an order beginning with one particular followed in their varieties
then all dead things in their order living and verdent according to their position and posture also those that are composed of some kind of celestiall things as the sun moon and stars all kind of martiall things or mechanick or the most part of what is usually born in our english armory

in the of arms there is by all observed a different value as first that the metalls are allowed a precedency to colours so also is there by some understood to be more of worth in one colour then another yet for

my part am of opinion that it is so little as not the taking notice of onely for other mens opinions sake will touch at it

first of the metals every judgment will be ready without any argument to give gold the preheminence

figure

as for the colours think they are thus to be esteemed in point of priority sables gules azure verd purpure and some do introduce tenne but it being a bastard colour is exempted especially amongst english armory onely reserved for abatement of honor except in one or two examples of things
thus have placed the colours though contrary to the rules of some as guillim placeth yellow in the third place green in the fourth

sir john fern allows gules the third honor and placeth sable in the fifth

mr guillim bringeth in also another colour called murrey or sanguin but never saw it used in an english coat onely this and tenne are appropriated to the abatements of honor therefore to be set apart from the rest think properly
the next in order is furrs which may be of one colour alone or more than one which furrs are supposed to have been the doublings of mantles

figure

the first of these may seem to go all under

the name of ermins but they are distinguished by various names according to their colours as if as the first it be white powdred with black it is ermin if black with white ermines if yellow with black as the erminoys if as the fourth black with yellow pean if white with black and one red hair erminites
by which it is understood how precise a man ought to be in the blazon or tricking a coat when so small a difference as the colour of one hair shall make a coat another thing

the next is called vayre or verry this being of argent and azure is termed vaire onely but if any other colours then must it be blazoned verry of such colours as for example ermin and gules by the name of gressey of darbyshire
the next is potent by some
the colours whereof must be blazoned
the last is but of two counters if called countercomponed but if more then checky
if any of which be in a bordure you must say a border purflew of such a furre blazoning the furre and the colours
now by the way mr guillim doth hint one rule in blazon concerning the field which is the surface of the shield which ought to be well observed for propriety of speaking which is not to say he beareth a field or or arg but the field is or or arg else he beareth or or arg gules or the like

these furres are often born in bordures also which are in the next place to be treated of

and here in one escutcheon have placed the bordures and in the severall quarters the differences of brethren

figure

of bordures if it be plain you must say a bordure gules or the like
if it be charged with beasts then it is blazoned a bordure enurney of such beasts if of birds enaluran of such birds if of flowers verdoy if of dead things entoyre as of bezanti mullets or the like

the plain or simple bordures have also their varieties according to all their crooked lines
which shall shew shortly after

for the charged bordures here is exemplified nine distinct
in the first is a bordure or and gules the second a bordure purflew of vayre the third quarterly composed of ermin and checky or and azure the fourth gobbonated or and sables the fifth sables entoyre of eight bezants the sixth or a bordure gules charged with three bendlets sables the seventh azure enaleuron of eight martlets or the eighth quarterly the first gules enurney of three lyoncels passant guardant or the second azure verdoy of as many flowerdelis the third as the second the fourth as the first which with a field argent was the of henry courtney earl of devonshire marquesse of exon
this may be blazoned short by england and france
the ninth is a bordure gules diapred entoyre enurney enaleuron and verdoy
this kind of bordure may be of any two or other set number of these also
now to the intent that might descend to the posterity with safety and free from dissention of strife distinctions were invented which have here set down to the number nine

by which differences the bearer is understood of what degree or line of consanguinity

he is if he be of the second third or fourth house and what brother of that house by charging his coat with the difference appertaining and if a younger brother of a younger house then by charging the difference of the house with difference of line of fraternity there being so much care taken for the preserving the honor of the entire coats that the eldest son of the first house during the life of his father so of the rest cannot bear it without his distinction and for this reason hath

the nephew of the first the father being dead been always preferred before the uncle of the second and taketh place before him

by the way also we are to take notice that if all the brethren die without issue and leave sisters behind as they are of the lands and estare so shall they be of the also without any distinction at all to either of them because by them the name of the house cannot be preserved they being all reckoned but as one heir
again if they be not heirs they are not admitted to the bearing of the for saith sir john fern arma non transeunt ad agnatos affines
yet their husbands are admitted to adjoyn the arms of their wives families in the sinister side of their escutcheons with their own but if they have none of their own then not at all

now there is none of those signs but are

sometimes born in arms as charges of the coat but when they are distinctions it is easily known by their singularity either of place position or diminutive proportion

there is a care to be observed concerning the parts of the escutcheon as to the preheminence of location for all charges which are here marked thus figure

a the dexter chief
the precise middle chief
the sinister chief
the honor point
the fesse point
thenombril point
the dexter base
the precise middle base
the sinister base



there are severall crooked lines to be observed also wherewith all the ordinaries are many times made different and various which are these

figure

invecked
ingrayled
wavy nebule
embattaild or crenelle indented dancette



of these lines the two first differ onely in this that the points of the ingrailed line are turned into the field and the other contrary into the ordinary that those lines do make
the two last are both one secundùm quale onely differing secundùm quantum the one being onely wider and deeper then the other
and when any of these ordinaries are drawn withthese lines the blazoner is to say a bend chief pale or what it is invecked ingrayled wavy or the like but if plain then onely to name the ordinary with its colours according to the following examples

figure

a crosse
a chief a pale
a bend
a fesse
an inescutcheon
a cheveron
a saltyr
a barre
the last of which ordinaries may easily be mistaken for the same or at least a diminutive of the fifth but it is not and they are distinguished by the space they possesse in the field and also by this difference the barre hath liberty all over the field with its diminutions the fesse onely one proper place
these ordinaries according to leigh do possesse these proportions of the field

crosse containeth uncharged the fifth part but charged the third

the chief the third part

the pale the third part

the bend the fifth uncharged but charged the third

the fesse the third part

the innescut the fifth part

the chever the fifth part

the saltyr the fifth uncharged but charged the third

the barre the fifth part

of these ordinaries some have their diminutives as the barre a closset a barralet the bend both dexter and sinister the dexter hath a bendlet garter single and double cottises and a ribbon the sinister bend a scarp and a a cheveron hath its cheveronels

and here now shall desire to be excused for digressing from the method of other men especially mr guillim and first to take notice of some other forms near relating to the ordinaries for their shape and proportion on which are oftentimes rewards and additions of honor placed in coats as also the abatements of honor for misdemeanor and dishonorable actions that afterwards may not have any thing to interrupt a

methodicall proceeding in the rest

the first of which are those on which most commonly additions are given which are these

figure

the first is a bordure spoken of before
the second a quarter
the third a canton
the fourth a gyron
the fifth a pile
the sixth two flasques
the seventh two flanches
the eighth two voyders which saith leigh is the way of bearing a reward given to a woman

the ninth is ernoin an inescutcheon gules named also a scutcheon of pretence

on any of these may an addition of honor be placed according to the pleasure of the prince or the fancy of the herald that is left to the designing
which reward remains to the posterity of the atchiever and none of the descendants of his family but his own line may bear it
in which manner have seen the arms of a kingdom given to a private subject nay and sometimes to a stranger as in the example of sir henry st george norroy king of arms who upon an embassie into sweden was honored by the king of the swethes with the addition of the arms of swethen in a canton
the marquesse of exeter gave the arms of england in a bordure as in the escutcheon of bordures is seen in the eighth quarter being given him by henry the eighth

now the laws of honor having by a continued succession of time maintained and refined these rules of nobility for the encouragement of brave and generous spirits so foreseeing the pronenesse of all men being apter to fall and decline from the vertues and bravenesse of their ancestors and to bury the honor of the deceased purchasers in the dust than to improve the talent of renown time hath entrusted them with as a correction to such there is provided a method of degrading them from or giving diminutions

of disgrace to the arms of such as the example of the succeeding escutcheon demonstrates

figure

the first according to mr guillim's rules is a delph tenne due to him that revoketh a challenge
the second is an inescutcheon reversed sanguin for deflowring a maid or widow
the third is a point dexter for too much boasting his martiall acts
the fourth a point in point sanguin due to a coward
the fifth a point champion tenne to him that killeth his prisoner

the sixth two gussets sanguine for adultery

the seventh a gore sinister tenne for him that flies from his colours
the eighth a point plain sanguine for telling lies to a soveraign or generall
the ninth the whole coat of arms reversed and proper onely to a traitor
but there is another stricter punishment also for treason as sir john fern sir william segar and the civil laws relate which is that though he have many sons then living his arms are for ever taken away unlesse by some extraordinary service his successors do regain the honour of them and wipe away the stain for eorum memoria destrui debet says the law
and in the same manner are those other stains of abatement so rivetted to their shield when once by the soveraign authority placed there that neither the immediate possessors nor succeeding owners with their greatest force or the teeth of time are able to tear it away but by vertuous demeanor to ingratiate the same hand that put it on to wipe it off

pitty it is those rules have not been exactly observed in our latter ages such a severity would doubtlesse be a means to affrighten many that are enclined to these abominable enormities to apply themselves ingenuously to a gentle obedience and plausible demeanor

for if not for loyalty honor or the punishment of other laws yet rather then leave so great a proclamation of their to be both a plague upon their fames and a leprosie on their posterity they would cautiously flye from such senslesse carelessenesse

now having thus laid down the as well as the additions of honor am brought by my method to the main body of this generall work of armory which is the variety of bearing the ordinaries and after the accidents more common as of birds beasts fishes plants mechanicall things
and for the first as in my estimation very reasonably the most honorable begin with the crosse and its various kinds of bearings being more numerous by much than any of the other ordinaries
this hath its position in the greatest and most eminent parts of the shield and therefore it is much to me that mr guillim and others should place it last of all the ordinaries
the crosse if uncharged possesseth the fifth part of the field but if charged the third
the varieties have placed in two shields as first in this

figure

in the first quarter is azure a plain crosse or the coat of the sheltons of norfolk
the second is gules a crosse crossed upon three grees or by the name of jones in denbyshire
the third or a pattec sables fimbriated gules
the fourth arg a crosse wavy voided sable by the name of duckenfield in devonshire
the fifth a crosse moline pierced lozenge or which was the of molaneux of

this piercing a crosse is alwayes known from a charge on it by the colour of it for if it be the same with the field then it is supposed the appearance of the field through it and is sometimes square sometimes round and sometimes but if it be not the colour of the field then it is a charge and receives another blazon as hereafter will appear

the sixth example is azure a crosse patonce or which leigh saith was the arms of king edgbert this differeth but little from the crosse flory flurry or fleury as by the next you see
the seventh is arg a crosse flurry gules
the eighth gules a crosse avelane or
the ninth azure a crosse potten fitched or the coat armour of ethelbert king of the as saith guillim
the second escut cheon represents as many as have exprest in the first and those as strange

figure

the first is a crosse formy flory
the second is a crosse bottony
the third a crosse couped or charged with a pellet in the fesse point or center
and by these next examples is seen that the crosse is many times divided into more then two parts and sometimes all over the field as in this fourth which is or a crosse triparted flurry gules
the fifth azure a crosse arg

the sixth is quarterly gules and vert four pheons arg in crosse their points meeting in

fesse
by which example may be seen that many times severall things are born formed into this or any other ordinary

the seventh is azure a crosse resarcelled or
which saith sir john fern is as it were sewed together again after a voiding
the eighth is gules a crosse crossed or pierced all over the field which is the arms of the earl of tholouz
the last is argent a crosse voided couped sables by the name of woodnoth
sometimes one crosse is charged with another which differeth from a crosse fimbriated thus the sise of the frimbria is much narrower then that appearance of the crosse that is surmounted of another as mr guillim saith but sir john fern saith it is not a crosse fimbriated when the uppermost is also charged
the next of these ordinaries to be exemplified is the chief which is variously born thus

figure

the first gule a chief argent by the name of worksley
the second tenne a chief shapernette ermine
the third vert a chief crenelle argent charged with a file azure
the fourth gules a chief argent surmounted of another or which saith sir john fern is a double addition of honor

the fifth gules or a chief azure filleted in the nether part argent now sometimes this ordinary is honoured with an augmentation

which very rarely are any of the rest as in the next example

the sixth is or two barres azure a chief quarterly azure and gules on the first two flowerdelys or on the second one lyon passant guardant of the last the third as the second the fourth as the first which is the coat armour of the earls of rutland
and this is also sometimes charged with other ordinaries as in this seventh example which is barry of six per pale in a chief paly of six per fesse all or azure between two cantons gyronny of the first and second an inescutcheon argent joyning to the chief
the eighth is sables a bend and chief or
the last is gules two barres and a chief indented or by which is seen that this ordinary is sometimes also formed of the crooked lines as all the rest are
the pale doth not only vary its form as the rest with crooked lines but hath its diminutives too as in this example

figure

the first is gules a pale or the coat armour of the lord hinkley
the second azure a pallet argent which possesseth the half part of a pale
the third is or an endorse gules which is the fourth part of a pale
the fourth is argent three pallets wavy
the fifth azure a pale radiant rayone or
the sixth argent three pallet gules in a chief azure a barrulet dancettee or

the seventh is argent on a pale sable three crosse pattees or within a bordure engrayled

of the second by the name of crowch

the eighth paly of six argent azure fretted with a barrulet in fesse gules a chief and base of the same
the ninth argent on a pallet sable a fesse gules and two barrulets of the second quarterly pierced of the first
the bend is an ordinary drawn of two lines from the dexter to the sinister base and sometimes from the sinister chief to the dexter base and have both their diminutions and are varied as the rest as oft as the variety of crooked lines can do it

figure

the first is argent a bend engrayled sables

by the lord fitzwater earl of sussex

the second is argent a bendlet gules which possesseth half the bend and according to the rule of some should begin its upper line in the precise corner of the dexter chief whereas the bend begins above it as much as below it
the third is or a garter gules which ought to contain but the third part of the bend and derive its lines as the bend doth
the fourth is gules a cost or cottis or which containeth the fourth part of a bend
the fifth is or a ribbon gules this containeth but the eighth part of a bend and is couped at the ends
the sixth is argent a bend sinister vert this bend meeting in the same field with the dexter bend seems to make a saltyre but they do not and care must be taken in the blazon of it to begin first with that which lies next the and then to say the one surmounted of other
the divisions of this are first a scrape as in the seventh which is argent a scarpe azure
the eighth is or a battune gules which is most commonly couped at each end as the ribbon is which is commonly the stain of a when he is admitted the bearing the armour of his father's line but it is not to then in mettle but by bastards of

last which for its variety have inserted as rare is azure a bend double dancette

argent by the name of lorks

if there be more then one of these ordinaries in a coat they are to be blazoned thus if two bendlets if more bendy of so many as it is and sometimes a bend with its diminutives meet in one field as in this of sir edmund boyers of camberwel in surrey which is or a bend vayre between two cottizes gules

figure

and sometimes these cottizes are born without any bend between them as in the example empald of john marsham of hornsplace in the county of kent esquire which is or

a lyon passant in bend gules betwixt two bendlets azure

and this manner of empaling is a way that a man joyns his wife's coat with his and wish these coats might so come together
now proceed to the fesse according to my promised method
and first in its place and genuine nature as in the first quarter here which is verry of or and vert a fesse gules by the name of duffield

figure

the fecond is or a fesse dancette sables the proper coat of sir thomas vavasor

the third argent a fesse and canton gules by the name of woodvile

the fourth or a fesse between two cheverons sables by the name of lisle
the fifth by the name of blyton is gules a fesse sable argent indented par fesse point in point between three owls head errased of the third
the sixth is vert on a fesse argent a barre sable charged with four cheverons between three spades of the second
the seventh sable a fesse wavy argent between two stars of the second given to that honorable person sir francis duke by queen elizabeth for his service at sea
the eighth is sables a fesse at each end or which have very rarely seen
the ninth or a fesse nebule betwixt three trefoyls slipt gules
thus you see a variety of bearing this ordinary yet it shews not any diminutives changeth its place in the field which two only properties belong to the barre and it only so differs from this in specie
as for the escutcheon born as an ordinary find very little variety only sometimes it is called an inescutcheon which is when thus born which is ermin an inescutcheon gules by the name of hulgrave

figure

and sometimes an escutcheon as when more then one is in the field as thus in the second which is argent three escutcheons sable by sir john loudham of suffolk
sometimes these are charged only with augmentations of honor and sometimes the field is charged with other ordinaries promiscuously with these as in the third which is or a barruler between two barres gemels gules three escutcheons vayre by the name of gamolle

and sometimes these escutcheons are charged

also as in the last which is or three escutcheons barry of six vayre and gules

the cheveron containeth the fifth part of the field and is not so confined to one place but may be born in another and also more then one in a field but if above two they are called cheveronels guillim

figure

the first example is a cheveron gules belonging to the lord's staffords
the second is or a cheveron in chief azure

there are divers other accidents incident

to this ordinary as transposition coupings voidings and reversing besides it hath its diminutives for example the third is ermin a cheveron cooped sable by the name of jones

the fourth is azure a cheveron engrayled voided or by the name of dudley
the fifth argent a cheveronel vert of which there can be but three in a field
the sixth is vert a couple close argent which containeth the fourth part of a cheveron and is not born but by payres except a cheveron be between
the seventh is sables a cheveron rompe or betwixt three mullets by the name of sault
the eighth is azure three cheveronels brased in the base of the escutcheon and a chief or by the name of
the ninth is gules three cheveronels reversed or
the saltyre is an ordinary formed of a fourfold line two from the dexter chief extending towards the sinister base and two towards the dexter base from the sinister chief meeting in fesse by couples in acute angles in the nature of that which we usually call a saint andrews crosse

figure

the first is argent a saltyre gules by the ancient and noble family of the gerrards of lancashire
the second is azure a saltyre quarterly quarter'd or argent the arms of the episcopall sea of bath and wells
the third is gules a saltyre or surmounted of another vert by the name of andrews

the fourth is sables a saltyre argent in the fesse point an inescutcheon or charged with a crosse gules and this though we should allow colour upon colour and metall upon metall to be false herauldry yet is good

the last being the charge of a distinct scutcheon it being of pretence and of another family

the last of these ordinaries is the barre which though it is allowed the honor of a particular ordinary yet in my opinion is but a diminutive of the fesse however differs only in this that it hath the liberty of the field and taketh place any where which the fesse cannot this also hath its diminutives being subdivided into a closette and barrulet

figure

first of the barre as in the first quarter of this scutcheon azure three barres wavy by the name of

the second argent three barres and a canton gules by the name of fuller

the third gules two barres and a chief indented by the name of hare
the fourth is or a closset sanguine this is the one of the barre
the fifth is sables a barrulet argent this containeth the one fourth part of the barre
the sixth beareth gules on a cheveron arg three barres gemmels sables these are called gemmells when they are placed in couples at a near distance and more than two in the field in even number
the seventh is ermin three barres couped gules charged with six escollups shells or three in the first two in the second and one in the last by the name of sabridge court
the eighth is barry of ten or and azure in a canton gules a chaplet argent by the name of holms of
the ninth is barry of six on a chief between two party per bend dexter and sinister two pallets or and azure over all an inescutcheon arg which was the of mortimer earl of march
thus have run through all the ordinaries with their varieties of barring in their due order according to their usuall terms of proper blazonry
in the next shall shew some other forms of charges framed of such like lines in the escutcheons and then proceed to shew all the partings counterchanges

figure

first then as in this shield there is or an orle azure by the name of bartram lord of bothall
the second is or an orle of three pieces
the third argent an orle engrayled on the inner side gules
the fourth is or a double tressure flory
the fifth is sables a fret or by the lord mautravers now quartered by the earl of arundel

the sixth vert or this with the

distinction of a second brother in a third house is the of sir george whitmore late lord mayor of london

in the three last are a a lozenge and a mascle
the pile is an honorable bearing though not to be reckoned among the ordinaries as some would have it this hath divers ways of bearing and is free to any place of the field but its property is to issue from the middle chief and extend with an acute angle almost to the middle base and then is termed plainly a pile but if otherwise you are to distinguish as this quarterings will demonstrate

figure

the first argent a pile gules this belonged to sir john candoys in the time of edward the third

the second is or three piles meeting near in the base of the escutcheon azure by sir george brian
the third is argent three piles one issuing out of the chief between two other transposed sables by the name of huls
the fourth is argent a triple pile flory on the tops issuing out of the sinister base in bend sables by the name of wroton
the fifth is argent a pile in bend issuing out of the dexter chief in pale sables cottised engrayled argent
and here in the same scutcheon for their nearnesse of form have inserted the gyron with its varieties
as in the sixth gules a gyron issuing out of the dexter point or
the seventh is argent two gyrons gules
these do always meet in with their points and therefore is needlesse to name the place onely naming their number and colour
the eighth is gyrony of eight pieces or and azure a canton ermin by the name of octon

the last is gyrony of twelve argent and sables and so are they always to be blazoned gyrony of so many if they be more then two
these must confesse should properly

have been placed among the
but my digression is excusable since it is so near concerned as the single gyron belonging properly to that place and then that the are so near in a concordancy as the next discourse must bring them in which is to describe the partitions and according to the disposition of every ordinary and first of the partitions as in the first next example

figure

the first in this example is party per crosse arg and gules by sir henry cock of hertfordshire

and here is to be noted that though the mettle be more honorable yet if the colour possesse the dexter part or chiefest part of the field that is first to be named

and by the way must here observe that some will have this to be blazoned quarterly but certainly improperly unlesse the quarters were charged for why should this ordinary above all the rest be denyed the priviledge of partition which all have but the chief that in its propriety is formed but of one line the second quarter bears party per pale a bend argent and gules by sir geofry chaucer
the third party per bend or and vert by the name of hawly
the fourth party per cheveron sables and argent by the name of aston
the fifth party per fesse or and azure
the sixth party per pile in point or and sables
now the difference betwixt this and the pile alone is that the lines meet at the very base of the escutcheon and others short and sometimes this is changed by a reverse as in the next example which is the seventh party per pile reversed or gules and sables which is very rare for the distinction of the field into three colours as the last is also
the eighth is party per saltyre ermine and gules
the ninth is party per pale and base gules argent and sable

the are thus first party per pale or and gules three roundalls counterchanged

figure

the second is party per cheveron unde three panthers bends erased sab and or by the name of smith of norfolk
the third is pally of six a as many all argent and gules which is a quartering of that honorable gentleman the lord strafford
the fourth is barry of six party per pale indented argent and gules

the fifth is barry pily of eight pieces gules and or by the name of holland

the sixth is or and sables
the seventh is paly of six argent and gules on a chief as the field as many crescents all
the eighth is barry of six argent and sables indented one in the other
the ninth is barry bendy arg and sables
thus have run through all the bearings of the ordinaries both plain and in their variety together with the partitions and shall now as concisely lay down all the ordinary bearings as well of natural and celestial things as all sublunaries of beasts birds fishes vegetables and artificials in the best method can according to the blazon of leigh guillim and others the best could consult in this study
of celestialls
as for celestialls shall skip over some of them as angells cherubims and the like because they are obvious enough to every man's judgment when ever they are met with as some of these examples are also

figure

the first of these quarterings shews the example of gules an increscent or by the name of descus
the second azure the sun in its full glory by the name of st cleere
the third is azure the moon decrescent proper where the difference from the first is from the contrary position of them which is the same in the firmament and by this rule any man at the first sight may know in what state the moon is though he never saw an almanack

the fourth is azure a moon in her complement proper

the fifth or the sun eclipsed sables
the sixth is argent the moon in her eclipse sables
the seventh azure a ray of the sun issuing out of the dexter corner of the escutcheon proper by the name of aldham
the eighth is gules a chief argent at the lower part thereof the rayes of the sun issuing out of a clowd proper by the name of lesone of northamptonshire
the ninth is azure a comet or streaming proper
and unto these have added one more escutcheon of the like bearings because of the rareness of them

figure

the first is azure jupiters thunderbolt in pale or enflamed at both ends proper shafted and winged argent
the second argent a proper issuing out of two peteet clowds in fesse azure
the third gules a chief argent over all an escarbuncle of eight and florette or which saith guillim was the of the earls of anjou of whom was geoffry plantagenet
the fourth is or six enflamed proper

the fifth sables a bend or between six fountains proper by the lord sturton

the sixth argent a cheveron sables between three flames of fire proper
the seventh is sables a star of eight points or between two flanches ermin and a canton of ulster by sir john hubbart of norfolk
the eighth party per bend crenelle pointed the one in the other argent azure four crescents by couples enterlaced counterchanged
the ninth ermin on a chief sab three crescents arg

of beasts

next of beafts as in my opinion the most proper to order as the more noble creatures though confesse it is contrary to mr guillims method
and of those in the first place lions as the principall of them which are diversly born and from their severall postures receive a severall character of blazoning which is cautiously to be observed as well as in other things and it is not difficult for any indifferent genius without much discourse which would but make up a tedious

prolixity to little or no purpose when verbum sapienti sat est is a proverb in every man's mouth

figure

the first example is of azure a lion rampant argent being the of roger de montealto who was a benefactor to
the second is or a lion sayliant gules

the third is gules a lion passant guardant or which being the of the dukes of aquitane was joyned with the coat of the kings of england by the of henry the

second being before two lions the posture and colours one then indeed called leopards as they are most properly so called where they are not of royall bearing if they be more then one in a field and guardant as would have it this same single lion passant guardant onely the colours contrary as or a lion passant guardant gules says the welch petegree was the of roderick the great prince of wales in the year
by which account hath gained a great antiquity

the fourth example is of lions passant and not guardant which is gules two barres ermin in chief a lion passant party per pal or argent by the name of hill of norfolk
the fifth is gules a lion seiant argent
the sixth is or a lion couchant
gul
the seventh is azure a lion dormant or
the eighth is or a lion rampant regarding coward sables
the last is gules a lion issuing out of three corners of the field and meeting under one head in fesse or which was the of edward crouchback earl of lancaster
lions are sometimes with the tail elevated over the head sometimes with the tail forked and sometimes you shall meet with which is half lions passant and rampant and sometimes heads erased or couped but if cabossed then they are ever leopards heads as in these examples

figure

the first azure on a chief or a rampant issuant out gules languid and armed of the first by the name of markham
the second is azure three passant guardant or languid and armed gules by the name of hammon of acris in kent
now the french are so severe that they will not allow the tearms of lion to any either whole or demy that are guardant but think without reason

the third is or out of the midst of a fesse sable a rampant naissant

gules languid and armed azure

where it is proper to take notice that if it be armed or languid by any other colour than the body unlesse gules it is a blemish to it but gules signifying blood addes to it
so it is an abatement if it be without tongue teeth or claws
the fourth is verry argent azure on a pale gules three leopards heads or by the name of ockould
the fifth is azure three leopards heads cooped or
this coat is in the walk under lincolns inne chappel and think is very rare
the sixth is azure a cheveron betwixt three lions he ids erased ermin crowned or the of worthy benefactor of pauls sir paul pindar
the seventh is sables three lions tails erased argent by the name of cork
the eighth is gules a cheveron betwixt three lions paws erected and erased within a bordure argent in a chief of the second an eagle displayed sables by the name of brown
the ninth is sables two lions paws one issuing out of the dexter the other out of the sinister point of the escutcheon in cheveron arg armed gules by the name of frampton

there is one rule more that hath been by some both antient and modern heralds observed concerning the blazoning of lions which is that if above one lion be in a field

they must be termed lyoncels that is because the spirit of a lyon is full of majesty and admits no in one territory
but they make two exceptions to this generall rule that is when any ordinary parts them and when it is the coat of a monarch to which last must concede from his argument which is propter regiae maejestatis dignitatem
but for the former it cannot alwayes hold according to their own argument without an absurd contradiction
as for example mr guillim blazons a coat thus a fesse wavy betwixt three lyons passant whereof three is but one barred from the other
but must be forc't to beg pardon and to accuse him again and by it lay down one exception more in the coat of wickombe he blazons thus two lyoncels rampant combant
when as in ordinary reason according to his own argument too being in a fighting posture they deserve the name of lyons
as should be bold to blazon my own coat being the same only the colours contrarily disposed as azure two lyons combatant or languid and armed gules

confesse where find them indorsed as in that which he believes to have been the arms of achilles at the siege of troy think it much reason to blazon them lyoncels
for other examples of beasts shall only adde one more which is

first argent a mount proper a stagge lodged gules by the name of

figure

the second arg a stagge tripping armed and unguled or by the name of holms
the third is vert a stagge stripping proper or by the name of gilsland
the fourth is argent an unicorn seiant sab armed and unguled or by the name of harling
the fifth azure a stagge at gaze gules
the sixth is vert a fesse between three bucks in full course or by the name of robertson

the seventh is argent a lyons head erased gules by the name of gowis this is the most honorable bearing of the heads or limbs because it is said to be torn off from the body

the eight is gules three unicorns heads couped argent
the last is gules a cheveron betwixt three bulls heads cabossed argent armed or by the name of baynham

of birds
the second sort of the most noble sensitives are foules of the ayr all which shall comprise in a very short example
only by the way this note is to be observed that as have disposed them all into an order so are they in degrees of excellency in armory
and again when any quick things are born it is most commendable when born in the most generous and noble action or the most proper to its nature

figure

of these the first is sables a swan with her wings expansed arg membred or within a bordure engrayled of the same by the name of moore
the second is ermin an eagle displayed gules armed or
the third is sables a goshawke arg perching upon a stock fixed in the base point of the shield of the second armed jessed and belled or

this was the coat armor of that reverend dr cocks bishop of ely in queen maries and queen elizabeths times
the eighth is gules two wings inverted and conjoyned or
the last is or on a bend sables three estridge feathers passing through as many escrowls of the first
many other birds as well as beasts are used in the infinite variety of coat armour but by the observance of these examples they will be all understood

of fishes
mr leigh observes this general rule in blazoning of fishes that all fishes that are born feeding should be in blazon vorant or devouring because they swallow without chewing and that what they devour should be named

these are as beasts born in divers postures as nayant which is swimming upright embowed extended endorsed trianguled and fretted
as in this following demonstration

figure

the first is argent three eeles nayant in pale sables by the name of ellis
the second is sables three salmons hauriant argent by the name of salmon
the third is azure a dolphin nayant embowed argent by the name of

the fourth argent two barbels hauriant

respecting each other by the name of

the fifth gules two pikes hauria ntendorsed or
the sixth three trouts fretted in triangle arg by the name of troutback
the seventh is arg two lobsters clawes in saltyre the dexter surmounted of the sinister gules by the name tregarthick
the eighth is arg a cheveron engrayled betwixt thre crevices gules
the ninth is sables a fesse engrayled betwixt three welkes or by the name of shelly
thus are all manner of as well as others
and some times reptibles and insects all manner of flyes and grashoppers but their blazon is obvious enough to every mans judgement that can distinguish one from another when he sees them therefore it would be but an unnecessary intrusion in this place

vegetables

shall not need here hope to run over all parts of philosophy and diviniry and to tell what trees are and their natures for as they are not discourses pertinent to this place so mr guillim as well as my self might have every ingenious man as knowing as himself in it or at least and

to none other do submit my endeavours
shall only trouble the reader with their various bearing in the examples of some few which will direct to all others

figure

of the parts of mans body
there are sometimes whole figures of mans body born in coat armor as for example the arms of sevil in spain which is or a king enthronized on his seat royal azure crowned and sceptred and invested of the first the doublings of his robe ermine
the arms proper to the episcopal see of salisbury is az the virgin mary with her son in her right arm and a scepter in her left hand all or

but the like of these are very seldom seen only the leggs armes hands and other desected members are often met with as in

these following examples have demonstrated

figure

the first is gules a saracen's head erased arg environed about the temples with a wreath of the second and sables by mergith of wales
the second is arg a fesse gules betwixt three hearts vulned distilling drops of blood on the sinister side proper

the eighth is arg a cheveron gules betwixt three periwigs sab
the ninth is barry nebule of six pieces az arg as one chief of the second three eyes gul by delahay
if those drops are charged distinctly in any field as sometimes they are and sometimes the field all over you are to blazon them differently according to the colour as if sanguine then gutte de sang which is drops of blood
if arg then gutte de aue drops of water
or gutte de or drops of gold

az gutte de lermes drops of tears

vert gutte de vert drops of

of artificiall things
having thus cursorily run through these examples yet hope sufficiently enough for the satisfaction of an ingenuous reader now come to the artificiall varieties of bearing in
which since they are as numerous almost as the conceits of ingenuity must be excused from inserting the infinite examples of them yet shall propose some and let the eye of the observing student make up the defects of the rest as it may well do

figure

figure

as first arg a tower triple towered sab chained transverse the port or by the name of oldcastle

the second or a castle towred gules

the port displayed of the field leaved arg

and here is to be noted that it is never blazoned a castle but when it extendeth it self crosse the whole field and sometimes you shall find a single tower not turretted as the first in the coat of sir richard mansfield
the third is gules three single arches arg their capitals and pedestals by the name of arches
the fourth or a bridge of three arches in fesse gules masoned sables the proper on it a fane arg by the of trowbridge of trowbridge

the seventh or a pillar sables enwrapped with an adder arg by the name of
the eighth is arg three battering barwayes proper headed az armed and or by robert earl of lyndsey
the ninth azure three murthering chainshots or this is quartered by the earl of cumberland
there are many other things born as tiltspears sometimes with penoncels and sometimes without drums fifes trumpets cannons bows arrows and the like but their blazon is easie to every eye that knows any thing of armory

of maritine things
of things belonging to the sea have these examples
the first gules three pieces of masts cooped with their tops arg by the name of cromer

sanguine gules

and thus much think sufficient to be said of the examples of charges in
in the next place am to shew the differences of helms which distingnish in some part the honor of the bearer in his degree
the crowns and differing more particularly the highest

degrees of nobility shall also exemplifie in the conclusion of this discourse and hope shall raise in some measure a relation to the old proverb finis coronat opus

of helmets
the differences of helms is always exprest when the crest is given and by this difference a gentleman is known in his degree by his hatchment as much as these following examples

these helmets are sometimes called cask and timbers by the french helenum by the romans cassidem by the greeks galeam a covering for the head in time of war and our manner of bearing crests on them is from their ancient fancy of adorning their helmets with some kind of monstrous device as the head or mouth of a lyon the paws or horns of certain beasts to appear more terrible
and that which we call mantle is not as some doe ridiculously suppose the vestment which they usually had to wear over their atms in war or as some would have it to secure their shield from weather but from this originall that princes and chief commanders used to adorn their helmets according to their qualities with rich buckles studs and circlets of gold garnished with rich and costly stones and on

the top or crests of them wreaths of corded

being the liveries of their ladies and mistrisses as also some curled of hair and those cordons like waving scarfs dangled down behinde them on the cruppers of their horses the ends being fairly tasselled and enriched many times with pearls and precious stones and thus especially they rid upon dayes of triumph

but in germany and many other places where the laws of honour and armory are severely obsetved a mean gentleman or new atchiever is

not permitted to bear helm mantle or crest but by special favour

figure

the first differs from the
in that it is a side

standing helmet with the beaver close which is for all esquires and gentlemen

the second is the common fashion of knights which is a helmet standing direct forward with the open without guards
the third is a guardevisure which is proper for all persons of the nobility beneath a duke and above a knight
the fourth is the helmet of persons executing soveraign authority which is a helmet which is full forward which belongeth also to princes and dukes
in this manner are all degrees obviously differenced to every mans judgement in all hatchments
and if they be above the degree of a knight that these do not distinguish to particulars then they are also understood by their and crowns

of crowns and coronets

figure

the first whereof is the crown of the empire of germany which is but little different from that of england in the second which is emperial too
the third is that coronet of the prince which is the same with the kings only the arches mound and crosse wanting

the fourth is the crownet of an archduke

which is the same with a duke the arch only added

the fifth is a crownet floral only proper to a duke
the sixth is the crownet of a marquesse which differs thus it is of leaves and points the leaves or flowers above the points
the seventh is proper to an earl which hath points and flowers but the points are above the flowers
the eighth is due to a viscount which is a circulet or coronet pearled and neither flowers nor points
the last is the form of that crown which is found to be in fashion in the time of william the conqueror
which have inserted to shew the difference betwixt the crown imperial of england then and now

as to the antiquity of these crowns or diadems as notes of regality finde not any where a just authority to assure me of their origination but that there were crowns long before tragedies were in use is to me very evident though sir william segar is of opinion the use of them came from thence

yet that the use of them in these parts of the world might come from the giving of crowns in triumph and lawrels or wreaths for vertue is very probable which was a thing very frequent and of very great antiquity among the romans and hath continued

and been exercised in the empire since the translation to germany and that with much ceremony as in the example of joannes crusius his receiving the laurel as stratsburgh an

see mr selden his titles of honor where it is at large fol

which custom hath since been in these parts and indeed long before that time were crowns given to poets here as witnesse the example in st mary overies church where one john gower a poet in richard the seconds time hath a statue crowned with ivie mixed with roses but since it is more commonly used of laurel
though the crown of laurel or bayes was first appropriated to him that triumphed for victory in the field
at which time distinctions of crowns were observed according to the variety of merit
as corona muralis this was due to him that was first seen upon the wall of the enemy
corona castrensis for him that made a breach in the castle of the enemy the first a crown embattail'd or made with battailment being of gold the other of towers and then they had corona navalis garnished with for service at sea made of gold too

then corona ovalis of myrtle for victory gotten with little hazard corona obsidialis which was made of grass for him that had preserved an army besiged
corona civica for him that saved a citizen from the enemy made of oaken

boughs corona olivaris of olive leavs for victory in the olympick games and corona populea for young men that were found industrious and studious in the exercises of vertues
but find that amongst these rewards of honor the crown made of ivy called corona hederalis was only appropriated to the poets and here we see the great encouragement given to vertue which was an age doubtlesse when it was much exercised in all its species
when vertuous moderation received an estimation in the minds of young nobility before voluptuousnesse
and honor more aimed at by steps of vertue than the engrossing parsimoniousnesse or expending profusenesse of the and unsatisfying uncertainty of riches doubtlesse a most noble age
and why should any man make himself so concern'd in the true honor of his creation as to set himself so little before the irrational as the examples of ou idle and age do too often demonstrate whilest all men naturally are ambitious of honor and why should not any man blush to be seen reaching at it that is only the recompence of vertue till by some virtuous testimony he hath declared his desert certain am no generous and noble spirit ever breathed in any age that did not present some opportunities of exercising virtue in one degree or other and the reward in some measure is ever a concomitant

to heroick and ingenious merit
or should it in some case fail the truly generous soul though it misse its reward yet it thinks it honor to have deserved honor and satisfies it self with that encouragement

thus have given a succinct account of all manner of bearings
some will here expect that should now lay down rules to discover the worth of the atchiever by the nature of the atchivement as guillim and others have
it may be conjectured how far a is more or lesse honorable by of worth in the thing born but farther from thence to a of the quality of the merit for which that was a reward is altogether uncertain
therefore for conclusion shal instance one escutcheon of examples more which think though not difficult to blazon not easily reducible to any such judgement yet the families well known of noble and descent
the first is sab a crosse engrailed or in the dexter cant on a mullet arg an inescutcheon of ulstre the addition of a knight baronet being the of sir tho peyton of knolton in knight and
the second is ermin on a chief azure three lyoncels rampant or
the atchivement of sir anthony aucher of in
the third is barry of twelve or and sable by sir james and sir thomas thynne of long leak in wiltshire

the fourth is arg on a cheveron sab three or between three peelets charged with as many martlets of the first all within a border vert by anthony hammon of st albons in esq

figure

the fifth is arg on a bend az three heads cabossed or
on an escutcheon of pretence arg a cheveron sab betwixt three ravens by thomas stanley of cumberlow in hertfordshire esq the paternal coat his right by descent with the distinstion of the third house

of the earls of derby the escutcheon of pretence as by match with the daughter and heir of sir james enyon of flower in northamptonshire

where observe that although a man marry the daughter and heir of a yet he hath not the power of quartering it but only to empale it or bear it thus in an of pretence the liberty of quartering being in the heir who enjoyes both their coats by right of blood
observe also that if any thing be thus hid by an addition either canton or escutcheon of pretence it is notwithstanding to be nominated that no detriment be to the coat

the sixth is gules three barbed arrows arg headed or by edward hales of tunstal in kent esq

the seventh is arg a cheveron between three milrines sab by roger james of rigale in surrey esquire
the eighth within a bordure bezanty sab arg an imperial eagle by the family of the killigrews in cornwall
the ninth arg a fesse ermines between six mullets sab by steven penckhurst of buxsted in sussex esquire
and now hope have not passed by any one thing that can be called pertinent to this discourse without some touch perhaps satisfactory enough to any indifferent contemplation

the end of armory

the orders of knighthood in most places of christendome and in particular first of the order of st george in england

figure the creation robe of a knight of ye garter

as to knighthood in generall enough hath been already discoursed in the first part of this treatise
come now to speak of the severall otders and especially those that are called soveraign amongst which must needs esteem that of the garter or st george in england to be as noble as any in the world not from that epidemick humor of most writers because it is of my own nation but for the excellency of it self especially in that according to the articles of its foundation none are to be admitted to the honor but such as are peers of the realm

for the first occasion of the erecting these soveraign orders of knighthood above the more common was that as all honors were instituted for the reward and encouragement of deserving persons so these for persons of more eminence or more excellent merit to receive a character that might in a higher nature

than ordinary blazon their merit to the world

and that order or fraternity must needs be esteemed of greatest honor where the king shall submit himselfe to the badge of it
this order of the garter we find to be instituted by edward the third after a return from the warrs against the french and scots with eminent victories
the occasion sir william segar says was but slight alluding as conceive to the story of the king's taking up the countesse of salisburies garter which he wearing on his own leg caused a jealousie in the queen
and from thence received the motto life hony soit qui mal pens evill to him that evill imagines
but am of opinion that this humor arose from the french stories only who would be apt enough to endeavour an abatement of the honor of it lest its glory should appear too illustrious in the eye of the world and or eclipse their then blazing star

and that we may a little examine the truth let us observe the ridiculousnesse of the coherence of these merry scandalizers
first they differ in their time as shall appear anon then concerning the lady they take notice of to make up the pretty romance the mistake is very great and plain for in some places they say it was the queen's garter and if so what needed then the motto but most commonly they say it was the countesse of salisburies

whom they name sometimes alice and sometimes joan when her name was katherine and mistris and after wife to the black prince

son of the said king as is well observed in heylyn's history of st george

by which froysart's error must appear very perspicuous who was the first and most eminent author of this mighty fable

mounsier favin in his theater of honor quotes froysart and polydore virgil for the like account
but am apt to collect another reason from mr selden's discourse an authority that think needs no apology and to think edward the third being to engage a field

gave st george for the word long time before the of england in which battail he gained a great victory which was about the year
and at his return in the year one thousand three hundred and fifty established thisorder to the honor of st george which agrees with the black book of windsor that chronologizes it on the three and twentyeth day of april in the year one thousand three hundred and fifty being the three and twentyeth of that king's reign

and understand not but that the addition of the gartet might be after added to the ensignes of the order for the firstensign together with the robes was the crosse of saint george yet in use amongst them

and some do adde that the garter was from a martiall rise also as that a

upon the left leg was a mark given to some of the eminent commanders with promise of enriching it on those that performed honorably in the charge

for the account of the time according to other authors it is left disputable
mr selden takes notice of some of the french authors that affirm it to be erected in anno
yet after his victories as in the relations of the same froysart and thomas of walsingam and polydore virgil to whom favin subscribes

will have it in an

yet in another place he sets it down in the year one thousand three hundred and forty four
oportet mendacem memorem esse

and one other observation collect from some of these authors that the order was established before either of these passages only as a seminary to draw other knights of the world into these parts which caused the french king to do the like the same year of another order by way of prevention this is averred by some
which is conceive by other circumstances a mistake upon a just or turnment proclaimed by the said king edward about the year one thousand three hundred forty and four in all places beyond the seas to be held at windsor about which time he caused to be built a very large round table for the entertaining of such princes and persons of great quality as should repair thither when the earl of salisbury was so bruised at

the justing that he dyed
at the news of which meeting the french king sodainly after did the like to obstruct the concourse of great soldiers and honorable personages that this would have produced

the patron of this order is st george who suffered martyrdome at nicomedia and was

buryed at lydda in capadocia according to dr heylin but mr selden sayes he suffered at lydda under diocletian about the of christ one hundred and ninty
whose fame was so great in the world that many temples were built to his name as that of justinian in armenia and in venice the chief church for the grecians jo
eucaitensis built a monastery

to the honor of st george in the time of constantine
into which the emperors after were wont to make a solemn procession every saint georges day
in carinthia there is an order of knighthood of st george in very much esteem
and eusebius speaks also of another

order of st george among the greeks whose ensign is a red crosse with this motto sub hec signo vinces begun by constantiue the great

when first it came into this nation is by the best antiquaries left disputed but that he hath been long honored as of england is proved by all and by mr selden before the conquest the three and twentyeth day of april being constantly celebrated to his memory

and it is no marvail saith the same author

that so warlike a nation should chuse to themselves the name of such a souldier saint known by the particular name of tropheophorus and of greater eminence in both the eastern and western churches then any other

the soveraign of this order is the king of england the number of the fellowship is twenty six besides the soveraign of which when any of them dye the place is to be supplyed by another elected by the soveraign with the consent of the fraternity as it was antiently chosen and estalled at windsor but since it is referred to the entire disposing of the king
they have many articles confirmed to which all that are enstalled subscribe and have an oath to which they swear that to their power during the time they shall be fellows of the order they will defend the honor quarels rights and lordships of the soveraign and that they will endeavour to preserve the honor of the said order and all the statutes of it without fraud or covin
quinam perjurati the officers of the order are a prelate which is alwayes the bishop of winchester a chancellor register a king of arms called garter and an usher called the black rod added by henry the eighth

their habit is a cassock of crimson velvet and a mantle of purple velvet lined with

white sarcenet on the left shoulder whereof is an escutcheon of george embroydered within a garter with the motto the escutcheon is argent a plain crosse gules

above all about the neck they wear a collar of the order weighing thirty ounces of gold troy weight composed of garters and knots enamel'd and with roses red and white and since the coming in of king james there hath been an intermixture of thistles
at this collar hangeth the image of st george on horseback enriched with precious stones
and about the left leg they wear a garter enamelled and enriched with gold pearl and stones of great value with the same motto of hony soit qui mal pens
for their ordinary ensign they wear a blew ribbon over their left shoulder and another on their left leg and a star of silver embroy dery on the same side of their cloak with the scutcheon of st george in the center of it
and sometimes at their ribbon a george also and then they wear it about their necks
their feast is yearly at windsor castle on st georges day
in which place upon the foundation of it was a church erected with dean and prebends as also thirteen poor aged gentlemen established to be maintained with stipends by the name of knights of windsor who had appointed to them robes of cloath according to the manner of the order which were to pray for the order

of the knights of the round table in england
it is said by many writers that the order of the was inftituted in imitation the round table but can give no great assurance of it only believe it probable enough the beginning of them both agreeing also in some kind of analogy
this of the round table for so much as is remaining in history appears to me to have been the most noble in the world either before or since for ought yet can understand
and pity it were the memory of it should perish as it is almost being buried in the metamorphosis of ridiculous fables and by that means only with the shadowie reputation of a romance in the minds of many and indeed most men

it was erected by king arthur who reigned in the year of our redemption
and conquered norway scotland and so much of france that he was crowned king of paris as both ours and the french annals testifie
of this king many fabulous things have been writ but we may collect so much from the more serious as may assute us that without doubt many noble and beyond ordinary heroick acts were

performed by this generous prince
which caused the society of this order to shine with so much the more splendor than the ordinary stars of this sublunary world insomuch that it is recorded in some chronologies that at one time summoning them to a meeting at a place in wales called carlion or carlignion there resorted to him ten kings thirteen earls and many barons and other persons of great quality that were of the fraternity

this have also in sir william segar and in

a very antient chronicle which have seen my selfe in manuscript in that country which was much the same with the relations have since met with of this order

and that these kings were not petty kings must be understood since there was at that time no heptarchy or provincial kings but all monarchies much in the same nature as they have been in our ages
this king is generally reported by chronologers and some of them solid too to be taken alive from the earth or at least miraculously disposed of invisibly but this is a riddle too great for me to unfold
many of them this fable conjecture from an epitaph that merlin writ on him hic jacet arturus rex quondam rex{que futurus
which very thing to my judgement must make clear that he was buryed which is their argument that he was not

the order or fraternity however was certainly in very great repute in the world and being only a banquet of honor could not but whet the emulations of all generous spirits for none were admitted to it but such as had shewed their merit by some eminent exploit

their place of convention was winchester where they had their round table and at the feast of pentecost they alwayes met and feasted
so saith sir william segar in whose orders of knighthood the articles of this order are set down but others are of another opinion and tell us that windsor castle was the most peculiar place where a round table was erected

for their meeting being a castle built by the same king and the records of the place shew us as much though winchester may sometimes have been the place according as the time of

the kings being in progresse or keeping his court accidentally there as sometimes it was at carleon and sometimes in the north

knights of st andrew in scotland

the scots ever since the reign of hungus

the pict have received st andrew for their
who as it is reported in their

histories making war on the english saw in the skie a bright crosse of st andrew which is in the shape of the saltire and in that battail after gained a very great victory
from which time ever since they flye that crosse in their banners
and from thence erected the order of st andrew
but find nothing in favin aubertus mereus or the scotch writer that can satisfie me in what time it began
only it was refined by james the fifth
who being honored with the garter from england the toyzon d'or from the emperor and st michael from france celebrated the festivals of them all and setting up their several

arms with their orders about them over the gate of erected his own also with the order of saint andrew in the midst which order is ensigned with a collar of rue and thistles with a medal of st andrew hanging at it and this motto nemo me impune

of the golden fleece in the empire

this order of the toyzon d'or was instituted by philip duke of burgundy an

upon his expedition to the holy land in memory of gideon who with three hundred men

fought against and overthrew a mighty army

of the midianites as favin is of opinion
which perchance may be true he marching upon a great enterprise with a smal army might do it to raise courage and emulation in his commanders

the patron is st andrew the soveraign

the dukes of burgundy the number twenty four besides the soveraign all of noble blood
their habit is a cassock of crimson velvet and over it a mantle of the same lined with white which openeth on the right fide and is turned upon the left over the shoulder embroydered round about with a bordure of flames fusils and fleeces and a hood of crimson velvet on their heads

the collar of the order is of gold wrought with flames fusils and fleeces which they are bound to wear alwayes upon a penalty
the power of making new is in the soveraign only
and who ever enters into it renounces all other orders of knighthood unlesse the soveraigns be emperors kings or free princes
to the order belongs a chancellor a treasurer register and a king of armes called toyzon dor
at the collar hangs a golden fleece
and formerly there was an impresse peculiar to it which was an instrument to strike fire with his motto ante ferit quàm flamma micet

the emperor charles the fifth being afterwards soveraign as duke of burgundy did much increase the order

the severall orders of knighthood in france
knights of the star

this order find of very great eminence

in france called the star of the sea and sometimes also of the virgin mary
it was instituted by king robert an
and himself and succeding kings were of the fraternity
their ensigne was a star which they wore was their hoods or caps
but this order in time grew so common and distributed so immeritorioufly

that charles the seventh as at it commanded every yeoman of his guard to wear a star in like manner which the knights seeing presently left it off and so the order fell

knights of st michael

jn the stead of the knighthood of the star the same king charles erected the order of of st michael as some suppose but more truly lewis the eleventh at amboys an

upon the occasion of a vision as their historians relate of the archangel's appearance on orleans bridge as their tutelar against the english

at which time the famous amazon joan of france lived who did many heroick exployts leading an army her self in the field against the english
for which the english after having vanquisht her much to our disparagement think in revenge caused her to be burnt for a witch in the of orleans in which place is since a conduit erected to her memory

this order of monsieur st michael archangel is of thirty six knights and a soveraign which is the king
the cognisance of the order is a collar of gold made of

and knots with the image of st michael pendant at it which collar ought to weigh two hundred crowns in gold and not above nor under

for the wearing of this collar there was a very strict article as that every man that did not wear it every day was to cause a masse to

be said and to pay seaven shillings six pence turnoys of forfeiture except in arms and then they were permitted to wear only the image of the angel on a chain or ribbon the motto of the order is immensi tremor oceani

to this order is established a herald called mon st michael a treasurer a chancellor and a register
their habit according to the constitution of henry the second of france was his doublet hose shooes scabbard and feather all white a surcoat with sleeves of cloth of silver over it a mantle of the same turned up over the left shoulder and tyed over the right embroydered with a bordure like the collar
over his shoulder lay a hood of cloth of silver spreading over his back the tippet hanging down before and over all the collar

knights of the holy ghost or st esprit
to this order of st michael did henry the third in honor of on which day he was chosen king of poland institute the order of chivaleir du benoist sante esprit joyning both this and the other into one an

as they continue to this day

in this discourse of this order by monsieur favin is set down the oathes ceremonies pensions accompts and all the duties all which should insert would be too for my intention
the manner of their procession to

court and many other particulars is set down concerning them in sir william segar

their robe is like that of st michael only of black velvet embroydered all about with gold and silver of and knots of gold between sundry cyphers of silver and flames of gold seamed garnished also with a mantle of green cloth of silver wrought over with the same manner of embroydery with the mantle both lined with orange coloured sattin
the great mantle they wear turned up over the left shoulder and open on the right their hose and doublet white and black bonnets with white plumes the collar over all wrought in the same manner as the embroydery
they have a crosse hanging at it with a dove in the center of it as in another place shall be described

of the order of the gennet

this by the annals of france is reckoned the first order that ever was instituted in that country
but have not given it the first place because it is now extinguished and

its essence only remaining in the chronologie of fame
it was ordained by charles called

the tyrant before his usurpation called charles martell seneschall or high steward of france
who in a battel against the moores gaining a victory had amongst many other spoyls a great number of genets skins and some of the beasts in memory of which victory he instituted this order about the year of our lord
the number was to whom he gave collars of gold made of a triple chain enterwoven with enameld red roses at the end whereof hung a gennet of gold enamelled black and red upon a terrasse or bank of flowers fairly enamel'd this continued till king robert and then the star of the sea eclipsed it

these knights saith aubertus meraeus had other ensignes appropriated also as a ring after the manner of the romans and certain habits for the body
about which time or not long after charlemain created another order called of the crown royall but that was not so much in esteem being only for a reward of service in friezland the governour of the country having the power of creating the knights

knights of the broomeflower and also of the ship
lewis the ninth in his time instituted two orders of knighthood one called of the broomeflower in the cod and the other of the ship called also of the crescent or half moon
the first he instituted at his coronation and it continued till the end of the reign of charls the fifth and extinguished with his life
the collar of the order was composed of cods of broomeflowers intermixed with lozanges enamelled with and at it hung a crosse formy flory with this motto exaltat humiles
the other of the ship he erected upon the occasion of the second voyage into egypt to encourage the nobility that went with him
the collar of the order was enterlaced with double scallops and double crescents interwoven with a meddal hanging at it with a ship enamelled under sayl

this king lewis returning from his voyage

against the turks an
brought home with him a troop of knights called of st lazarus to whom he gave large possessions but afterwards this order fell again and their revenues were given to the knights

of malta untill the time of henry the fourth who instituted that of and revived

that of st lazarus

there are many other ancient knighthoods recorded in france but as they were of lesse esteem so are they also out of date and shall only name them most of which were more private orders and had subjects for their soveraigns there was of the porcupine of

the thistle of bourbon of the croissant of anjou of the ermin of britagne
of which examin monsieur favin his theatre of honor

there was also an order of the dog and cock appropriated to the family of monmorency and another of de la dame blanke al escue verd or the order of the fair lady of the green field instituted by jean de boucicaut marshal of france under charles the sixth who were sworn unto divers articles as that they should assist all ladies and gentlewomen wronged in their honors or fortunes answer challenges of armes supply one anothers necessary absence that if any lady or gentlewoman required aid of any of them and after any knight or esquire should challenge him he should first right the lady and then perform the or if a chalenge preceded such other accident it was at their pleasure which to undertake first and many more such which would be too tedious for this place
they are at large in mauchaut sieur de roman ville his history of boucicat

of military orders in spain
of the order of the lilly

this order was erected in by garcia the sixth of the name surnamed naiera in honor of the virgin mary and upon a miracle so great as might make this lilly one of the primest flowers in her little garden

the substance of it this the king having been very sick in the extremity of his disease sent to st saviour de leyra and other places of devotion that prayers and interercessions might be made for his recovery in which time was discovered in the city of naiera where ordinarily he kept court the image of the virgin mary issuing out of a lilly holding her son berwixt her arms
and suddenly after the discovery of this the king recovered his health and many other miracles were done on diseased people in that place as supposed by vertue of the virgin mother whom

they tearmed the lilly of the vallyes
in honor whereof the said king erected this order and made himself soveraign of it and his sucessors after him
these knights did wear

on their breasts a lilly embroydered in silver and on festivall dayes a double chain of gold interlaced with letters after the manner of the gotish letter with an oval meddal hanging at it with a lilly enamelled

knights of san jago or st james

this was erected by the resolution of gentlemen being either barons or men of

great quality that jupon the conquering of their country by the arabians retired into the mountains of asturia and residing there made an engagement of war against the moors agreeing upon religious rules of knighthood yet reserving to themselves liberty of marriage but this order favin speaks to be erected by alphonso the ninth an


and that it was confirmed in by pope alexander the third

their governor is called great master their feast is on day when they meet in very great magnificence having very great revenues their ensign a red crosse shaped like a sword with an escollop's shell on it in imitation

of the badge of the pilgrims that go to jerusalem and to the sepulchre of st james the apostle

now the great master of this order hath alwayes neer him thirteen knights where ever he goes for his aid and councill and so all the other orders in spain

of the order of calatrava

this was begun an

in imitation of

that of st jago by don sanctio the third king of toledo and it takes it name from the place of its establishment their habit is a black garment and on the breast thereof a red crosse they have many great priviledges and possessions in spain the form of their crosse is set down in the end of this discourse which if we will believe monsieur favin and aubertus maereus is quite another then that which sir william segar describes

knights of alcantara

these also derive their denomination from the place of their institution and

living under the same orders with those of calatrava doe wear the same fashioned crosse only the colour is green

they have a very glorious church at alcantara in castiglia upon the river tago endowed

with rich possessions where their great meetings are

these were first of the order of st julian

called the order of the ferainando the second king of and gallicia being the first great master


knights of the band

sir william segar attributes the originall of this ordsr to alphonso king of spain an

but favin sets it down in an


from the testimony of don antonio de guevara bishop of mondognedo but by the same person alphonso the eleventh of which order that it might receive the more reputation he enrolled himselfe and his son
and yet as favin sayes none were to be admitted but younger brothers and mean gentlemen of poor and slender sufficiency who must have been ten years followers of the court or at the least had fought three times against the moors

they wear a red scarfe or ribon crosse the left shoulder like our knights of the bath the breadth of three inches
their articles are too many to be inserted here
sir william segar and favin have them at large

avis in portugal

there was an order in portugal erected in the year
called avis by alphonso

the first who were seatrd in the city ebora and so called from the virgin mary being patronesse of the city
they had a great master and were called fratres and the place of their convention was called frieria
their ensign is the same crosse with calatrava vert and in the centre of it a

of the order of jesus christ
since in the year
was erected another order of more esteem amongst the portugals called of jesus christ by dionysius king of that country and nephew to alphonso the tenth of castile to which order was given much of the revenue of the knights templars that lay in that countrey the kings of portugal are ever the soveraigns of the order to this day the ensign of the order is a red crosse surmounted or intersected with another white on a black vestment and they have many priviledges and articles amongst them

of this order was don pantaleon brother to the portugal embassadour who was beheaded at july


knights of montesia

this order was much about the time of those of calatrava and received their

name from the place of their residence in valentia and do wear for their ensign a plain crosse gules

this order was established in the year

and had much of the revenue of the knights templars also setled on them

knights of redemption these knights called of redemption were erected by james king of aragon upon the conquering the islands of majorica in the year
their articles are many but the chief is they are to redeem prisoners from whence their title is derived their habit is a white garment with a black crosse and their governour is alwayes resident at barcco na

d'espuella orada or of the goldeu spnr

there is another order in spain of far more honor called espuella orada
which was created with much ceremony as bathing like our knights of the bath then being laid on a rich bed after brought to the chappel or church where he performs his vigils confesses and supplicates for power to observe the duty belonging to the order then his gold spurs are put on and a

sword girt about him and the sword being drawn is delivered into his right hand in which posture standing he takes an oath never to refuse to dye in defence of his law king and country
and then receiving a kisse from all the rest of the order in testimony of the amity betwixt them he is compleat

other orders there are there as that of cavaleri armadi cavaleri alarde and some more antient as the order os the dove or holy ghost in castile of st saviour of mont real in aragon but these are either out of date or of low reputation

knights of the annuntiation
this order saith sir william segar was erected about the same time with that of st michael but how shall engage my faith to this article know not for find much uncertainty in the relation the institution of st michael being in an

according to his own account and of the annuntiation an

besides there is a greater error yet in computation for monsieur favin who hath some reason in this case to be understood aud hath been esteemed authentick affirms it to be by amedis the fifth called also the green or verd whom he chronologizes to live in an

which makes a vast difference and again aubertus maereus in his symbola equest
ordinum gives the honor of its birth to amedis the sixth earl of by which must confesse so great an uncertainty appears as affrights me from any conclusion but that by their general defacto am assured such an order was
and that in memory of amedis the fifth who most couragiously defended rhodes against the turks where he took the bearing of gules a plain crosse argent which the dukes of savoy have continued till this day

this order was first called of the snares of

love from the receiving from his lady the favour of a bracelet made of her hair into and it was constantly celebrated on st maurices day who is of savoy

he composed it to consist of fifteen knights comprehending himself a chief master
the place of their celebration is the church of pietra in the castle of bellies unto which at the institution of this order was given certain lands for the maintenance of fifteen chaplains and continually every knight at his death gives to the church an hundred florins

and one other article was that at the funeral of every knight ceremoniously performed at the castle of pietra every knight of the order should wear black whereas their mourning was a white gown and leave off the collar for certain dayes and that at the enterment of the soveraign every knight according to

their seniority in order should offer up his collar

every knight was sworn to wear this order dayly and to accept of no other
and that no person stained with reproach or dishonor should be admitted or if found so after to be degraded

of these past knighthoods these four of the garter in england the toyzon in burgndy

st michael and of st esprit in france and this of the in savoy are the most honorable and yet in being

of the knights templars
this order as it hath been most famous in the world though now extinct think ought to be preserved with an honorable memory
it was erected in a pious design perpetrated with a glorious fame though extinguished in an ignoble and injust stratagem of the devil the pope and the king of france

its first rise was from an accident of certain

gentlemen meeting in the holy land some say nine an

who hearing of the great disturbance of the country by the incursion of turks and swarmings of pickaroons engaged a confederacy with the hazzard of their lives to suppresse them
which resolution being known was so approved of by the patriarch that he commanded accommodation for them in the temple neer the sepulchre
and the king of jerusalem appointed them all appertinencies for so religious an enterprize
from whence they received the name of
and thus going on with much resolution and courage many christians came in to thrir assistance and

many brave exploits were performed by them insomuch that in nine years time they had erected such a structure of honor as set all the world at gaze and establisht their countrey in a happy peace
for a reward whereof pope honorius at the suit of the patriarchof jerusalem prescribed unto them a peculiar order of life and distinguished their order by wearing a white garment and pope eugenius added a red crosse after which prosperity they elected a head whom they called great master

yet not long after this jerusalem and a great part of the countrey was lost for want of supply from other parts of christendome
however they still made war upon the turks for
years and added new breath to the trump of fame purchasing large revenues to the order in most kingdoms of europe being the exercise of love in all christian princes and of emulation in every heroick spirit insomuch that vitriacus gives this character of them they were saith he leones in bello agni mansueti

in domo in expeditione milites asperi in ecclesia vel ut eremitae monachi inimicis christi duri feroces christianis autem benigni mites

but this great glory could not shine for ever without an eclipse nor such favorites of fortune live without envy as well as emulation and their fall was so much the more sodain and violent by how much their fame

was higher
for in england france and almost all parts of christendome was it at an instant as it were and in one very day by sentence of pope clement the first to satisfie the the base avarice of philip de beau the roy of france totally disolved and supprest

the pretence was upon certain articles exhibited against them which have been by all the world almost not only adjudged false but

ridiculous
as that they used pagan ceremonies in the election of their great master that they lost the holy land when they alone endeavoured to preserve it that they held some heretical opinions that they worshipped an image apparelled in a mans skin and that they drunk mans blood to confirm their oath of confederacy

when indeed itwas most certain that the crime for which they suffered was their vast wealth and their fidelity to the patriarch whom they owned before the pope cause sufficient to set the one to solicite and the other to grant a monstrous doom which they suffered under for what will not pride and avarice do

the great master himselfe and sixty others of the order were commited to the mercy of fire in paris at one time and the rest persecuted if not executed in most places all of them dying without any acknowledgement of any one allegation and with the same christian and heroick spirits they had lived in

and by the account of favin a french writer and one think in this not too impartial there was at twice after one hundred or above burned to death in paris all dying with innocence in their mouths and in the same place many after

but as such notorious evils are ever the ushers of god's infinite judgements it was not far off here for the two knights imployed in the accusation were one hanged and the other slain in a short time after
how the revenues prospered in the hands of the new possessors know not or the possessors in the enjoyment of them but believe like those of church lands in this nation and the account of stories and traditions have seen and heard in particular of it makes me with confidence say very unfortunately

many of their territories and castles in some places were given to an order of knighthood called the joannites knights of saint john of jerusalem and particularly in england who were after knights of rhodes and lastly of malta being conferred by act of

parliament how taken from them cannot say and in vienna by order of a great councel

of the order of st john of jerusalem rhodes and malta

some have been of opinion that this order was originally from the time of the holy war an

when by the conduct

of one called peter the hermit robert duke of normandy son to william the conqueror godfrey duke of lorrain and some other noble persons jerusalem was from the saracens being called knights of st john baptist and of jerusalem
but it is more certainly related that certain christians going to visit the holy sepulchre obtained leave of the caliph of egypt to build a little cottage to live in by it paying a due tribute for their liberty as for their own residence and for the entertaining such as should adventure to joyne with them in their devout life which monsieur favin relates to be neopolitans
after this their number so encreased that they built another to entertain women more large and stately and enlarged their oratory and another for men in the nature of a colledge or hospital where they established a rector or master and from the

great charity among them their religious life and good deeds to pilgrims they were called brethren hospitallers of st john baptist of jerusalem

and upon the conquest of the ciry they had great franchises granted them and large revenues with liberty to mannage armes

and were instituted to be knights of st john an

and for their distinction they wore a black garment with a white ankerd crosse with eight points but in war they wore a red coat of arms with the same white crosse see the example of the crosses at the end of this discourse

after their successe in the holy war grew very famous and that they had done very great exploits almost over all palestine in the year they wonne the city of rhodes from the turks
and as valiantly maintained it against them afterwards who four times it in vain and the fifth time also was taman himself repulsed with the losse of mahometans
but being constantly oppressed and not encouraged with any reliefe from the christians of other parts after three moneths siege they lost it and ever since have remained in malta

into this order no man was admitted but he was first to approve himself a gentleman before the rector
the son of a moore was not to be admitted nor of a jew or mahometan though the son of a prince and a christian

himselfe and they were sworn to fight for the christian faith to do justice defend the oppressed relieve the poor persecute the mahometans live vertuously and protect widows and orphans

of knights teutonicks

this order of the teutonici was founded by an almain who remaining in jerusalem after the taking of it gave great and liberal entertainment to all christians that came to him and in a short time had drawn such a resort that from thence arose a fraternity that bound themselves under certain articles and elected a great master or governor every man of that association apparelling himself in white with a black crosse pattee voyded with a crosse patonce
which fraternity afterwards grew a very great order and purchased a noble fame but jerufalem being taken by the turks again they removed and pitcht their settlement in ptolemaida and that being also taken by the saracens they retired to germany and engaging a war against the prusians they got great victories and having the emperours grant for enjoying what by the sword they wonne with expence of some blood they purchased great revenues in prusia and

built many illustrious with churches and some cathedrals establishing bishops to them whom they enjoyned to wear the habit of the order this was about the year
frederick the second being then emperor

the chief church appropriate to this order

is marcenburg
the knights besides their large possessions are lords of livonia and they have a governour which they still call the great master

knights of st sepulcher

this was antiently an honorable knighthood but it is since extinguisht and nothing but the memory of it remaining and that inclusively in those of malta
the ensign

of the order is yet extant amongst them as a relique of antiquity which is a double crosse as it were two conjoyned gules as segar relates but favin speakes as that their crosse was a crosse in each canton of the same a small crosse plain being the same as the armes of the kings of jerusalem and from this originall that godfrey of bullein gave great goods to especially in his last will and testament by which also he ordained that himself and the successors kings of jerusalem should be buryed in their cathedrall church

which was joyning to the sepulchre that their patriarch should have the prerogative of crowning them
and baldwin his immediate successor establisht them an order of knighthood being before put regular chanons appointing

the patriarch of jerusalem their great master thus favin relates

knights of st mary

these were a religious order erected by

certain gentlemen of and madona for which they obtained a licence of pope urban but with mony only calling themselves knights of st mary but were commonly called cavaleri de madona and indeed properly enough for whereas they professed to fight against infidels they lived allwayes at home in peace plenty and ease for which they gained the heroick character of fratres gaudenti or brethren

their habit was very rich and on it they wore a crosse like that of st john of jerusalem

knights of st lazaro
the knights of st lazaro challenge a great antiquity so high as st basil they had great possessions and honorable reputation but like the knights templars were suddenly eclipsed and had as absolutely been smothered in the funeral croud of obscured honor had not pope pius quartus a little revived them
this order does own obedience to a great master also and are engaged to the observance of many articles especially they are to be of lawful birth and gentlemen by double descent and of christian parents to wear a green crosse in the manner of a crosse pattee fimbriated as sir william segar describes but aubertus maereus otherwise as is exemplified hereafter

of the knights of the bear called also of st gall

in the year
the emperour frederick

the second going in pilgrimage to the abbey of st gall gave great priviledges in

acknowledgment of their assistance in pulling down the emperor and establishing him
whereupon also he established an order of knighthood called of the bear which knights were yearely to meet at the abbey of st gall on the
of october where all new knights were to receive the order from the abbot

this order he called of the bear in honor of st ursus that was martyred at soleure
unto this order he gave a collar and of gold at which hung a figure of a bear enamelled sable

of the order of the elephant

in denmark is a military order called of the elephant and also of the blessed virgin mary who have for their collar a chain of gold interwoven with elephants and spurs and at it hangeth a meddal of the virgin

mary encompassed about with rayes of the sun at the neather part whereof hangeth another circle enclosing three nayles which term symbola omnia christianae
who was the founder is left the elephants are figured with castles on theis backs which some doe suppose to be the or designment of christernus


of the order of mantua

jn mantua some fryers doe report to be some of the bloud of our saviour kept with a piece of the spunge in which he received the vinegar and gall
which reliques they say doe daily work extraordinary miracles

in honor of which bloud vincentio de gonzaga fourth duke of mantua did institute an order of knighthood calling them knights of the bloud of our saviour jesus christ making himself the great master of the order which was confirmed by pope paul the fifth

the originall of it was about the year
when he created fifteen knights giving them collars composed of ovals of gold some the length one way others another in one of which were these words domine probâsti and in the other flames of fire flashing about a crucible or full of sticks of gold and at the same hangeth before another large oval wherein are designed two angels standing upright holding a chalice and pix crowned on the table of it are seen enamelled drops of blood and about this oval is this inscription nihil sto triste recepto

knights of st stephano
this order was erected in the year
by cosmo duke of florence ordaining amongst them such articles almost as those of the order of malta their residence is pisa where the said duke erected a church to the honor of the order and is himselfe the great master

other orders of knighthood there are and have been in the holy land and other parts as of st thomas apostle st katherine of mount sinai of the white eagle in polonia of the swan in cleveland the brethren in livonia of st blase in armenia of st john of acres and of st gerian which was instituted by frederick to which order none were admitted but germaine gentlemen
but these are all or most of them out of date and not so considerable as to trouble an ingenious brain with in this place
favin and others have discoursed enough of them to which if the reader be desirous of further knowledge refer him
there is also another order called of the white dragon in germany erected by the emperour sigismond upon a resolution of extirpating heresie and

schism throughout all his dominions who had for their ensign a white dragon and in swethen another which is called of the seraphins who had at their institution appointed them collars of seraphins heads intermixed with crosses
and now if have not been too tedious in this discourse of knighthood have hope said enough and conclude with the description of the severall forms of their crosses before mentioned

the first is of st esprit the second of st michael the third of calatrava the fourth of st john of jerusalem the fifth of st lazarus

the sixth of the teutonicks the seventh of st andrew the eighth of the sepulchre the ninth of christus avis

and so take leave of knighthood and in the next place only cursorily run through the antiquity of heralds and the inns of court and chancery with their foundations for which last though not very pertinent to my businesse yet may expect an excuse since it hath nor yet been any way done

the end of knighthood

of heralds

the word herald saith verstegan

is derived from the saxon and by abbreviation and herald which in that language signifies the champian of an army and growing to be a name of office it was given to him that in the army had the charge of challenging to battail or combat

sir henry spelman cals him nuncius sacer and speaking of the signification of the word

says quidam enim herault some doe write herault that is dominus celsus an eminent lord some herold which is an old lord and some heral hoc est says he ministrum an officer of an army which last he supposes the most proper

these are officers of great antiquity saith dune mensis who writes that they are as ancien as kings and were tearmed of the romans caduceatores
and doubtlesse thee ection of our heralds was in imitation

of them though their authority be not so great with us as it seems theirs was whose office was established by numa pompilius and a

colledge or hostell erected of twenty wise and reverend men per quos fiebat ut justum indiceretur bellum ut foedere fides pacis constitueretur ordering that it was and should be unlawfull to take armes against an enemy without their consent and appointment

which fecialians when the popular estate was changed into a monarchy again wore the coats of arms of purple and scarlet fringed with gold and an eagle of the same embroydered thereon and the emperors name then reigning and they had one principall which was called by the people pater patratus whom they ever reverenced as sacred and it was a rule or law among them that fecialium sacra violare nefas erat

since when as the office now is they have been esteemed as embassadors and sometimes have been made so however are the messengers of princes and great monarchs and what

ever their message have been priviledged in the same degree with embassadors and not only in our parts but all over the world have been in being though not as now in regular office ever since there have been kings

in every city of greece as saith ulpian the interpreter of demosthenes they were called ceryces and had in much honor of all men

and maintained out of the publique treasury

in rome and most other places they carryed as ensignes of their office rods in imitation of the poeticall fiction of mercury

who is styled the herald of the gods those of rome wreathed with two serpents and the ancient druides of wreaths of vervine imitating the same

in france where a long time this office hath been in much honor not only

st dennis the principal king of arms but the other heralds and pursevants are to be of noble and mountjoy to be of three descents as well of his fathers as of his mothers side of noble linage and

their office or colledge is in the church of st anthony the lesse in paris
and they are allowed the priviledge of entrance into any prince's court and an injury offered to them is a publique injury in all parts of the world
but do not finde they were in this and establishment till the time of

philip de valloys
the revenues of them in france was very great as to mountjoy in particular

lands in free tenure and pound per annum stipend as favin relates
and the others pound per annum stipend besides other profits and they are many besides their priviledges are very great which in the same author are at large set down in which author cannot but observe the ridiculousnesse

of their humor in the christening of their pursevants for they call it christening and the ceremony is performed with the powring a pot of wine on their heads they name them at their own pleasure and some they call telltroth chearfulnesse loftyfoot and the like

but to come neerer to our own concernment think to proceed with the same office in our own nation where they are now in lesse esteem confesse then they have been in former ages yet have ever been honored with messages between potentates for matter of honor and arms
ceremoniarum ministri as in the coronation of kings and queens enstalment of princes and creation of noble dignities of honor in triumphs justs combats marriages christenings interments and to attend all solemn assemblies of state and honor and by some of them ought the proclamations of all great matters of state to be promulged causes of chivalry and gentility are referred to their care as in the right of bearing of arms in shields scutcheons targets banners penons coats and such like correcting of arms in visitations and observing descents and pedigrees of noblemen and gentlemen

they are the protonotaries griffiers and registers of all acts and proceedings in the court of the high and lord marshall

of engiand or of such as have their authority and in their books and records they are to preserve to perpetuall memory all facts and memorable designments of honor and arms
they have been long establisht in england but find not that they were incorporated into a collegiate society till richard the third's time when they were incorporated by charter and placed at coleharbor from whence they often removed untill they became setled where now at this time they are placed by the honorable endeavour of that illustrious family of the howards formerly dukes of norfolk and earls marshals of england the house being before called darby house
which was established to them in the time of king philip and queen mary and in these tearms incorporated by the names of garter king of arms of england clarenceux king of arms of the south parts and the heralds and pursevants for ever and to have and use a common seal to purchase lands to sue and be sued by

edward the sixth in his third year granted them many priviledges viz
in these words forasmuch as sundry records and testimonies of great antiquity and of no lesse credit have now lately reduced to our perfect knowledge the kings of armes heralds and of arms elected as persons vertuous and for their good qualites knowledge and experience to serve in the affairs of the

have been alwayes heretofore by emperors kings and princes of christian realms upon most worthy and just considerations not only maintained and supported as well with yearly stipends and pensions as daily profits advantages and commodities sufficient to the necessity of the decent and convenient living of them and theirs in honest state
which daily profits advantages and commodities are now lately much decayed to their hindrance especially in this our realm but also have been by the said emperors kings and princes enriched and adorned time out of mans memory with divers kinds of priviledges liberties and franchises as among others that they and every of them be free exempt quite and discharged not only from subsidies dismes fifths tenths reliefs contributions taxes profits grants benevolences and generally from all other manner of charges as well in time of war as peace in all such realms and dominions wherein they made their demour but also in all market towns and all other places from tolls fines customes impositions and demands and aswell from watch and ward in all cities towns and castles borroughs and villages and from the election or appointment to any office of mayor sheriff bayliffe constable scavenger or any other publick office in citties towns castles and villages whatsoever
and forasmuch also as we understand all kings of

arms heralds have alwayes heretofore from the beginning of the office of arms enjoyed and do presently enjoy all and singular the priviledges liberties and franchises aforesaid with many other in all christian realms without any disturbance or molestation we therefore considering the same and earnestly minding as well the advancement of the said office of arms as the quiet and honest supportance of our servants and ministers thereof do of our speciall grace certain knowledge and meer motion by the advice and consent of our most dearly beloved uncle edward duke of somerset and our protector of our realms and dominions and subjects and of the rest of our councel by these not only confesse and generally approve give grant and confirm to the said kings heralds and to every of them and their successors for ever for us and our successors all and singular the premises before recited although here not recited as have been of honorable antiquity upon just to them granted by emperors kings and right famous memory heretofore but especially by these presents pardon utterly for us and our heires release the said kings of arms heralds aswell all sums of money and demands whatsoever assessed

the inns of court and chancery in their order
first it is to be understood the four colledges or innes of court may be tearmed collegia jurisconsultorum that is colledges of lawyers
the romans did call such houses diversoria ordained to entertain strangers which in our english are called inns and have been acknowledged with us in england to be the residing houses of the noblest peers viz oxford inn warwick inn ely inn and now called oxford house warwick house and ely house somewhat according to the french whose houses of nobility in paris are called hostels in latine hospitium in english inns
in london and thereabouts there are fourteen two serjeants innes four innes of court and eight innes of chancery

the most antient inne of court and wherein serjeants of law had their first residence was sometimes over against saint andrews

church in holborn and was known by the name of serjeants inne which afterwards came to be the scroop's who then were have since continued barons of this land and it was called scroops iune which is called by another name the possession being likewise altered out of that family

and although the innes of the serjeants be somwhat antient for time as also of modern age too yet it must be granted that in respect of some others they must be respected but of a noval foundation
yet forasmuch as they are receptacles and lodging places of the most reverend judges and grave barons of the exchequer and other judge in office and serjeants at law they are by way of decency to be reckoned in the first rank
that hostel or inne which now is commonly called serjeants inne in fleetstreet was sometime a messuage appertaining unto the dean and prebends of york
and afterwards purchased by the judges and serjeants at law that lived in the reign of king henry the eighth for a place of residence for them in tearm time
and that other called serjeants inne in chancery lane was somtimes a mesluage belonging unto the bishops of see of ely as appeareth by records

in these said houses or innes of court commonly called serjeants inne the reverend judges of this land and the serjeants at law

have for many years lived and have been lodged within the same being in very deed although several by distance of place yet held to be but one entire society or confraternity by the name of brethren

the arms of these two innes of judges and serjeants
first gules two garbs in saltyre or bands azure
the second or an ibis proper which is a bird neer the colour of a jay
next to the two serjeants innes in order are the four innes of court that is to say

inner temple
middle temple
lyncolns inne
grayes innne

and first of the two houses or societies which are called by the name of temples or the templars inne the middle temple beareth for distinction
argent on a plain crosse gules the holy lamb
the said two temples or the templars inne are of any other of the innes of court the the most renowned and famous for antiquity they were at the prime and in their original but one entire foundationand body

but in processe of time became divided at first founded by a religious and devout order of souldiers called templarii that is to say templars

which knights within the kingdome of england purchased to themselves certain lands in fleetstreet bordering upon the shore of the river thames and thereon wit hin a short time built a large edifice and withall a round synagogue like unto a chappel or temple as it is now standing and was by heraclius patriarch of jerusalem anno dom
dedicated to the service of god in which place these templars by the space of one hundred years lived in great honor and opulency enjoying large possessions and those situate in the best places of the realm the like they had in other places the prelate of which order was ever a baron of england

now after the suppression of these knights templars their colledge or hostel came to the hands of thomas plantagenet earl of lancaster who being attainted for disloyalty and treason the same became invested to the crown
and afterwards the earls hugo le dispencer earl of chester obtained the possession of the same house who for the like transgression was justly attained also and then it came to damare de valence earl of pembrook the lusignian family in france who lodged therein but for a small season so that

in the reign of edward the third the sages and worthy professors of the common laws of this realm obtained a long lease of this house for
per annum
a third part whereof called the outward temple one doctor stapleton bishop of exeter in the dayes of king edward the second procured for a residing mansion to him and his successors bishops of that see and it was called exeter inne and so continued untill the dayes of queen mary when the lord paget her principal secretary of state and obtained the said third part called exeter house to him and his heirs and did the same
after whom the said house or the third part of the said templars house came to thomas late duke of norfolk and was by him conveyed to sir robert dudley knight al
sutton earl of lieoester who bequeathed the same to sir robert dudley knight his son and lately came by purchase to robert devoreux late earl of essex that dyed in the reign of the late queen elizabeth and it is called to this day essex house

and not to omit what is written touching the antiquity of the coat of arms belonging to this house it is warranted by the same was and yet is to be seen purtraicted in an old manuscript written many years since concerning the foundation of that order and which manuscript now

is or of late was in the custody of the right honorable lord william howard a lover of nobility and honorable arms

it is to be understood that before the order of knight templars assumed to themselves the said coat armour they now wear that they did embrace as to them appropriate this ensign a horse galloping with two men on his back

the which ensign was usually engraven on their signet or common seal it hath been conjectured that the significancy thereof was that the originall of this order began in poverty and want so that when they were to undertake any expedition of christian service they were enforced for want of ability to ride two of them upon one horse but it is more truly conceited that the same was rather an of love and charity and was a true hieroglyphick of an ingenious disposition and of a kindnesse used amongst noble and freehearted souldiers whereof none were of greater note then this order
who being professed and honorable spirits when they should come to the rescue of a christian souldier who might happen to be wounded or sick and comfortlesse in the

field they would relieve him and set him behinde one of them upon his own horse and by that means conveigh him to some place of safety where they should likewise take some speedy course for his relief
neither was this work of chariy only practised by the christian knights in those ages but it was used by the very infidels and pagans who also usually were exercised in the same works of charity as may be observed and read out of the famous and renowned poet ariosto who relates that reginaldo and fernand two knights charlemaine did fight together and each of them was mortally wounded and therefore they agreed to adjourne the combate till another day
and that during the space of the parly reginaldo's palfrey strayed away and could not be found whereupon fer nand proffered reginaldo a part of his horse to ride upon and willed him to mount up behind him with assurance he would convey him safe to the place he desired which reginaldo accepted and fernand performed this history is writ by ariosto in the italian language and not unworthy observation to this intent

the knights templars took their originall about the year of grace and upon this occasion many noble

men who were religiously bent obliged themselves by speciall vows to serve christ as regular cannons in chastity and obedience and to renounce their own proper will for ever

the first of that order was hugo paganus and godfrido de sancto hadomaro
their habit was prescribed by pope honorius to be a white habit and after by order from pope eugenio these knights had their first habitation appointed them by baldwin king of jerusalem neer unto the holy temple there they were ever after saluted by the names of knights templars
this order in processe of time did grow so universally great that many great and townes of christendome received their order of the knights templars as well in this our nation as in other parts where they enjoyed fair revenewes and large possessions for in england this university called the temple was the feat and habitation of divers knights of that order
but it hath of late by the princely donation of king james our late soveraign been confirmed to the professors of the common law under the great seal of england

the society of said the inner temple hath lately assumed to themselves a pegasus

whereof in particular spare to relate any more for the same is vulgarly known to all

to the inner house was also appropriated divers learned legists from time to time which in number continuance and gifts of nature did exceed every other of the said innes of court and therefore was anciently tearmed inner temple boun pleader
which continueth to this very day and it is withall much esteemed of beautified and graced with a special garden plot famous for its situation neatnesse and nearnesse of the river
the ensign is azure a pegasus argent
lincolns inne

this house owning a right to the arms as well as name of the lacyes earls of lincolne have set up over the gate the lyon rampant purpure committing a great mistake in that if sir john fern's account of that familie of the lacyes be true which hath passed for authentick for he tels us that or a lyon rampant purpure was his right but it was only a quartering and not the paternall coat for his first and principall bearing was party per crosse gules a

bend sables over all a file or three labels arg and this was the proper coat of those lacyes the other was the coat of the lord nigeld or neal baron of halton

this society of lincolnes inne the next for antiquity and ancient ally to the middle tenple is situate in a street or lane known formerly by the name of and now chancery lane being once the mansionhouse of a gentleman called william de havershall treasurer to king henry the third who for disloyalty to his soveraign was by the said king attainted of treason so that thereby his house and lands became annext to the crown
and thereupon the king gave this house to ralph de nova villa vulgo nevill chancellor of england as appeareth by an ancient record who also was bishop of chichester and kept his habitation or place of abode in that place

this house came afterwards to the hands of henry lacy earl of lincoln by reason whereof it was called lincolns inne and keepeth the style to this day
this earl henry deceased in that house about the year of our lord
neverthelesse this house did afterwards continue to the bishops of chichester untill the of king henry the eighth and the interest thereof came by conveyance to justice gullyard and other feoffees who during his life and after him his posterity held

it untill the reign of the late queen elizabeth and then sir edw gullyard knight to whom the same did successively descend by inheritance sold the same with the inheritance thereof to the benchers and society thereof

there is no memory of any florishing estates of the students and professors of the common lawes resident in this colledge until the reign of king henry the sixth when it appeareth by the rolls and remembrances of that house that the same became somewhat to be famous
but now of late time this house hath been much enlarged and beautified with ranks of goodly edifices and also with a fair and goodly chappel
the first of the chiefest buildings thereof was begun at the cost of sir thomas lovell knight then or before a fellow of that society who erected that fair into chancery lane of brick and free stone whereupon is engraven the arms of lacy earl of lincoln together with his own
the said chancery lane is so called for that king edward the third in the fifteenth year of his reign annexed the house of covents by patent to the office of chancery now called the rolls

grays inne

this house was sometimes the abiding mansion of the noble family of gray from whence the name of the house is deduced
it is situate within the mannor poorpoole a prebendary antiently belonging to the cathedral church of st paul london
in the reign of king edward the third the gentlemen students of that society as is confidently affirmed took a grant of this house from the said baron gray who lived in those dayes
and it is held probable that the grayes armes have been anciently by this fellowship maintained and are still taken up and kept as the proper and peculiar ensigne of that colledge or house and thus the same is found portraited

these inferior courts being nurseries and are entituled inns of chancery
and first for this thavies inne it is probable that the house by all conjecture is the most ancient of all others of that nature and it doth in that regard challenge the precedency in this rank

this house was in the raigne of king edward the third as is by to be found

the dwelling and mansion house of one john thavye citizen and armourer of london and was by the then apprentices of the law held of him at a certain rent annual as by a record yet to be seen in the husting courts of london doth appeare and may be verified for antiquity but since that time the house hath been purchased by the benchers or the antients of lincolns inne which about the raign of king henry the seventh to the end that there might be entertained in that place a society of students practisers and professors of the common laws of this realm
and this house still retaineth the name of the said thavies who was the first owner of it as is before mentioned

this house was sometime the mansion of sir william furnivall in the raign of king richard the second as by record appeareth

he was afterwards lord furnival his heir general married to sir john talbot created earl of shrewsbury by king henry the sixth by reason whereof this mansion house came to

the family of the earls of salop and afterwards of later years in the raign of queen elizabeth the same house was by the benchers or the ancients of lincolns inne purchased for the serting into the same a society of students of the common lawes from george lord talbot earl of salop as by sundry deeds in the possession of the late right honorable gilbert earl of shrewbury doth appear

this house was in the thirteenth year of the reign of king henry the sixth a messuage belonging to one john mackworth then dean of the cathedral church of lincoln and in that time in the holding of one lyonel bernard who next before the conversion thereof into an inne of chancery dwelt there
and it hath ever since retained the name of bernards inne or bernards house

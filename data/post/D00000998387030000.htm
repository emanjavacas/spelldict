The true Tragedie of Richard Duke of Yorke, and the good King Henry the Sixt.
Enter Richard Duke of Yorke, The Earle of Warwicke, The Duke of Norffolke, Marquis Montague, Edward Earle of March, Crookeback Richard· and the yong Earle of Rutland with Drumme and Souldiers, with white Roses in their hats.
Whilst we pursude the horsemen of the North, He slilie stole awaie and left his men: Whereat the great Lord of Northumland, Whose warlike eares could neuer brooke retrait, Chargde our maine battels front, and therewith him Lord Stafford and Lord Clifford all Brake in and were by the hands common Souldiers slain.
Lord Staffords father Duke of Buckhingham Is either slaine or wounded dangerouslie, cleft his Beuer with a downe right blow: Father that this is true behold his bloud.
Mont And brother heeres the Earle of Wiltshires Bloud, whom encountred as the battailes iod. Rich.
What is your grace dead my L· of Summerset? Norf.
And so do prince of Yorke, Before see thee seated in that throne Which now the house of Lancaster vsurpes, vow by heauens these eies shal neuer close.
This is the pallace of that fearefull king, And that the regall chaire? Possesse it Yorke: For this is thine and not king Henries heires.
York Assist me then sweet Warwike and wil: For hither are we broken in by force.
Weele all assist thee, and he that flies shall die.
Staie by me my Lords, and souldiers staie you heere and lodge this night: War.
And when the king comes offer him no Violence, vnlesse he seek to put vs out by force.
Rich Armde as we be, lets staie within this house? War.
The bloudie parlement shall this be calde, Plantagenet Duke of Yorke be king And bashfull Henrie be deposde, whose cowardise Hath made vs by words to our enemies.
Then leaue me not my Lords: for now meane To take possession of my right.
Neither the king, nor him that loues him best, The proudest burd that holds vp Lancaster.
Ile plant Plantagenet: and root him out who dares? Resolue thee Richard: Claime the English crowne.
Enter king Henrie the sixt, with the Duke of Excester The Earle of Northumberland· the Earle of Westmerland and Clifford the Earle of Cumberland withred Roses in their hats.
King Looke Lordings where the sturdy rebel sits, Euen in the chaire of state: belike he meanes Backt by the power of Warwike that false peere, To aspire vnto the crowne, and raigne as king.
And thine Clifford: and you both haue vow'd reuenge, On him, his sonnes, his fauorites, and his friends.
Patience is for pultrouns such as he He durst not sit there had your father liu'd? My gratious Lord: here in the Parlement, Let vs assaile the familie of Yorke.
know you not the Cittie fauours them, And they haue troopes of soldiers at their becke? Exet.
Far be it from the thoughtes of Henries hart, To make a shambles of the parlement house.
Cos of Exeter words, frownes, and threats, Shall be the warres that Henrie meanes to vse.
Thou duke of Yorke, descend my throne, am thy soueraigne.
For shame come downe he made thee D. of York.
And shall stande while thou sittest in my throne? York.
Why? he is both king Duke of Lancaster And that the Earle of Westmerland shall mainetaine.
You forget That we are those that chaste you from the field And slew your father, and with colours spred, Marcht through the Cittie to the pallas gates.
No Warwike remember it to my griefe, And by his soule thou and thy house shall rew it.
Plantagenet of thee and of thy sonnes, Thy kinsmen and thy friendes, Ile haue more liues, Then drops of bloud were in my fathers vaines.
Vrge it no more, least in reuenge thereof, send thee Warwike such a messenger, As shall reueng his death before stirre.
Wil ye we shew our title to the crowne, Or else our swords shall plead it in the field? King.
What title haste thou traitor to the Crowne? Thy father was as thou art Duke of Yorke Thy grandfather Roger earle of March am the sonne of Henrie the Fift who tamde the French And made the Dolphin stoope, and seazd vpon their Townes and prouinces.
Talke not of France since thou hast lost it all.
Lord protector lost it and not I, When was crownd was but nine months old.
You are olde enough now and yet me thinkes you lose, Father teare the Crowne from the Vsurpers head· Edw.
Good brother as thou lou'st honorst armes, Lets fight it out and not stand cauilling thus.
Ah Plantagenet why seekest thou to depose me? Are we not both both Plantagenets by birth, And from two brothers line allie discent? Suppose by right and equitie thou be king, Thinkst thou that will leaue my kinglie seate my father and my grandsire sat? No, first shall warre vnpeople this my realme, and our colours often borne in France And now in England to our harts great sorrow Shall be my winding sheete, why saint you Lords? My titles better farre than his.
know not what to saie my titles weake, Tell me maie not a king adopt an heire? War.
Then am lawfull king For Richard The second in the view of maine Lords Resignde the Crowne to Henrie the fourth, Whose heire my Father was, and am his.
York tell thee he rose against him being his Soueraigne, made him to resigne the crown perforce.
Suppose my Lord he did it vnconstrainde, Thinke you that were preiudiciall to the Crowne? Exet.
No· for he could not so resigne the Crowne, But that the next heire must succeed and raigne.
Plantagenet for all the claime thou laist, Thinke not king Henry shall be thus deposde? War.
Tush Warwike Thou art deceiued? tis not thy Southerne powers of Essex, Suffolke, Norffolke and of Kent that makes thee thus presumptuous and proud, Can set the Duke vp in despight of me.
King Henrie be thy title right or wrong, Lord Clifford vowes to fight in thy defence.
Maie that ground gape and swallow me aliue, Where do kneele to him that slew my father.
Doe right vnto this princelie Duke of Yorke Or will fill the house with armed men, Enter Souldiers.
And ouer the chaire of state where now he sits, Wright vp his title with thy vsurping bloud.
Confirme the crowne to me and to mine heires And thou shalt raigne in quiet whilst thou hu'st.
What wrong is this vnto the Prince your son? War.
How hast thou wronged both thy selfe and vs? West.
Be thou a praie vnto the house of Yorke And die in bands for this vnkingly deed.
In dreadfull warre maist thou be ouercome, Or liue in peace abandon'd and despisde.
They seeke reuenge, and therefore will not yeeld my Lord.
Not for my selfe Lord Warwike but my soone, Whom vnnaturallie shall disinherit.
But be it as it maie: heere intaile the Crowne To thee and to thine heires, conditionallie, That here thou take thine oath, to cease these ciuill Broiles, and whilst liue to honour me as thy king and Soueraigne.
Plantagenet embrace him? King And long liue thou and all thy forward sonnes.
Accuist be he that seekes to make them soes, Sound Irumpets.
York My Lord Ile take my leaue, for Ile to Wakefield To my castell.
What patience can there? ah timerous man, Thou hast vndoone thy selfe, thy sonne, and me, And giuen our rights vnto the house of Yorke.
Art thou a king and wilt be to yeeld? Had beene there, the souldiers should haue tost Me on their launces points, before would haue Granted to their wils.
The Duke is made Protector of the land: Sterne Fawconbridge Commands the narrow seas.
And thinkst thou then To sleepe secure? heere diuorce me Henry From thy bed, that Act of Parlement Be recalde, wherein thou yeeldest to the house of Yorke.
The Northen Lords that haue forsworne thy colours, Will follow mine if once they see them spred, And spread they shall vnto thy deepe disgrace.
Gentle sonne Edwarde wilt thou staie with me? Quee I, to be murdred by his enemies.
When returne with victorie from the field, Ile see your Grace, till then Ile follow her.
Poore Queene her loue to me and to the prince Her sonne, Makes hir in thus forget hir selfe.
Come cosen of Exeter staie thou here, For Clifford and those Northern Lords be gone feare towards Wakefield to disturbe the Duke.
York Howe nowe sonnes what at a iarre amongst your selues? Rich.
No father, but a sweete contention, about that which concernes your selfe and vs, The crowne of England father.
The crowne boy, why Henries yet aliue, And haue sworne that he shall raigne in quiet till His death.
But would breake an hundred othes to raigne one yeare.
And if it please your grace to giue me leaue, Ile shew your grace the waie to saue your oath, And dispossesse king Henrie from the crowne.
An oath is of no moment Being not sworne before a lawfull magistrate.
Henry is none but doth vsurpe your right, And yet your grace stands bound to him by oath.
Then noble father resolue your selfe, And once more claime the crowne.
Yorke saist thou so boie· why then it shall be so.
Edward, thou shalt to Edmund Brooke Lord Cobham With vvhom the Kentishmen vvill vvillinglie rise: Thou cosen Montague shalt to Norffolke straight, And bid the Duke to muster vppe his souldiers, And come to me to Wakefield presentlie.
And Richard thou to London strait shalt post, And bid Richard Neuill Earle of Warwike To leaue the cittie, and with his men of warre, To meete me at Saint Albons ten daies hence.
My selfe heere in Sandall castell will prouide Both men and monie to furder our attempts.
My Lord, the Queene with thirtie thousand men, Accompanied with the Earles of Cumberland and Westmerland and others of the House of Lancaster are marching towards Wakefield To besiedge you in your castell heere.
Cosen Montague post you hence: and boies staie you with me.
Sir Iohn and sir Hugh Mortemers mine vncles, Your welcome to Sandall in an happie houre, The armie of the Queene meanes to besiedge vs. Sir Iohn.
Shee shall not neede my Lorde, weele meete her in the field.
father, with fiue hundred for a need, womans generall, what should you feare? York.
Indeed, manie braue battels haue woon In Normandie when as the enimie Hath bin ten to one· and why should now doubt Of the like successe? am resolu'd Come lets goe. Edw.
Alarmes, and then Enter the yong Earle of Rutland and his Tutor.
Oh flie my Lord, lets leaue the Castell, And flie to Wakefield straight.
Chaplin awaie, thy Priesthood saues thy life, As for the brat of that accursed Duke Whose father slew my father, he shall die.
Tutor Oh Clifford spare this tender Lord, least Heauen reuenge it on thy head: Oh saue his life.
Clif Soldiers awaie and drag him hence perforce: Awaie with the villaine.
How now, what dead alreadie? or is it feare that Makes him close his eies? Ile open them.
So lookes the pent vp Lion on the lambe, And so he walkes insulting ouer his praie, And so he turnes againe to rend his limmes in sunder, Oh Clifford kill me with thy sword, and Not with such a cruell threatning looke, am too meane a subiect for thy wrath, Be thou reuengde on men, and let me liue.
In vaine thou speakest poore boy: my fathers Bloud hath stopt the passage where thy wordes shoulde enter.
Then let my fathers blood ope it againe? he is a Man, and Clifford cope with him.
Had thy brethren here, their liues and thine Were not reuenge sufficient for me.
Or should dig vp thy forefathers graues, And hang their rotten coffins vp in chaines, It could not slake mine ire, nor case my hart.
The sight of anie of the house of Yorke Is as a furie to torment my soule.
Therefore till root out that curssed line And leaue not one on earth, le liue in hell therefore.
neuer did thee hurt, wherefore wilt thou kill mee? Clif.
But twas ere was borne· Thou hast one sonne, for his sake pittie me, Least in reuenge thereof, God is iust· He be as miserablie slaine as I. Oh, let me liue in prison all my daies, And when giue occasion of offence, Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.
Plantagenet come Plantagenet, And this thy sonnes bloud cleauing to my blade, Shall rust vpon my weapon, till thy bloud Congeald with his, doe make me wipe off both.
Yorke Ah Yorke post to thy castell, saue thy life, The goale is lost thou house of Lancaster Thrise happie chance is it for thee and thine, That heauen abridgde my daies and cals me hence, But God knowes what chance hath betide my sonnes: But this know they haue demeand themselues, Like men borne to renowne by life or death: Three times this daie came Richard to my sight, And cried courage Father: Victorie or death.
And twise so oft came Edward to my view, With purple Faulchen painted to the hilts, In bloud of those whom he had
Oh harke, heare the drums? No waie to flie: No waie to saue my life? And heere staie: And heere my life must end.
Come bloudie Clifford rough Northumberland dare your quenchlesse rie to more bloud: This is the But, and this abides your shot.
I, to such mercie as his ruthfull arme With downe right paiment lent vnto my father, Now Phaeton hath tumbled from his carre, And made an euening at the noone tide pricke.
My ashes like the Phoenix maie bring forth bird that will reuenge it on you all, And in that hope cast mine eies to heauen, Skorning what ere you can afflict me with: Why staie you Lords? what, multitudes and feare? Clif.
So cowards fight when they can flie no longer: So Doues doe pecke the Rauens piersing tallents: So desperate theeues all hopelesse of their liues, Breath out inuectiues gainst the officers.
Oh Clifford yet bethinke thee once againe, And in thy minde orerun my former time: And bite thy toung that slaunderst him with cowardise, Whose verie looke hath made thee quake this.
will not bandie with thee word for word, But buckle with thee blowes twise two for one.
Hold valiant Clifford for a thousand causes, would prolong the traitors life a while.
Hold Clifford doe not honour him to much, To pricke thy finger though to wound his hart: What valure were it when a curre doth grin, For one to thrust his hand betweene his teeth, When he might spurne him with his foote awaie? Tis warres prise to take all aduantages, And ten to one, is no impeach in wanes.
York So triumphs theeues vpon their conquered Bootie: So true men yeeld by robbers ouermatcht.
Braue warriors Clifford Northumberland Come make him stand vpon molehill here, That at mountaines with arme, And parted but the shaddow with his hand.
Was it you that reuelde in our Parlement· And made a prechment of your high descent? Where are your messe of sonnes to backe you now? The wanton Edward and the George? Or where is that valiant Crookbackt prodegie? Dickey your boy, that with his grumbling voice, Was wont to cheare his Dad in Or amongst the rest· where is your daing Rutland? Looke Yorke? dipt this napkin in the bloud, That valiant Clifford with his rapiers point, Made from the bosome of thy boy.
And if thine can water for his death, giue thee this to drie thy cheeks with all.
Alas poore Yorke: But that hate thee much, should lament thy miserable state? prethee greeue to make me merrie Yorke Stamp· raue and fret, that maie sing and dance.
What: hath thy fierie hart so parcht thine entrailes, That not a teare can fall for Rutlands death? Thou wouldst be feede see to make me sport.
So: hold you his hands, whilst doe set it on.
I, now lookes he like a king? This is he that tooke king Henries chaire, And this is he was his adopted aire.
But how is it that great Plantagenet Is crownd so soone, and broke his holie oath, As bethinke me you should not be king, Till our Henry had shooke hands with death, And will you impale your head with Henries glorie, And rob his temples of the Diadem Now in his life against your holie oath? Oh tis a fault too too vnpardonable.
Off with the crowne, and with the crowne his head, And whilst we breath, time to doe him dead.
She wolfe of France but worse than Wolues of France: Whose tongue more poison'd than the Adders tooth: How ill beseeming is it in thy sexe, To triumph like an Amazonian trull Vpon his woes, whom Fortune captiuates? But that thy face is visard like, vnchanging, Made impudent by vse of euill deeds: would assaie, proud Queene to make thee blush: To tell thee of whence thou art, from whom Twere shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shamelesse.
Thy father beares the type of king of Naples Of both the and Ierusalem Yet not so wealthie as an English yeoman.
Hath that poore Monarch taught thee to insult? It needes not, or it bootes thee not proud Queene, Vnlesse the Adage must be That beggers run their horse to death.
Tis beautie, that oft makes women proud, But God he wots thy thereof is small.
Tis that makes them most admirde, The contrarie doth make thee wondred at.
Thou art as opposite to euerie good, As the Antipodes are vnto vs, Or as the south to the Septentrion.
Oh Tygers hart wrapt in a womans hide? Hovv couldst thou draine the life bloud of the childe, To bid the father his eies withall, And yet be seene to beare a womans face? Women are milde, pittifull, and flexible.
Bids thou me rage? why novv thou hast thy vvill Wouldst haue me weepe? vvhy so thou hast thy vvish.
For raging windes blowes vp a storme of teares, And when the rage the raine begins.
These teares are my sweet Rutlands obsequies, And euerie drop vengeance as it fals, On thee fell Clifford and the false French woman.
Beshrevv me but his passions moue me so, As hardlie can checke mine eies from teares.
That of his the hungrie Cannibals Could not haue tucht, would not haue staind with bloud But you are more inhumaine, more inexorable, ten times more then Tvgers of Arcadia.
This cloth thou dipts in bloud of my sweet boy, And loe with teares wash the bloud awaie.
Keepe thou the napkin and go boast of that, And if thou tell the heauie storie well, Vpon my soule the hearers will sheed teares, I, euen my soes will sheed fast falling teares, And saie, alas, it was a pitteous deed.
Here, take the crowne, and with the crowne my curse, And in thy need such comfort come to thee, As now reape at thy tvvo cruell hands.
Clifford take me from the world, My soule to heauen, my bloud vpon your heads.
Had he bin slaughterman of all my kin, could not chuse but weepe with him to see, How inlie anger gripes his hart.
What weeping ripe, my Lorde Northumberland? Thinke but vpon the wrong he did vs all.
Open thy gates of mercie gratious God, My soule flies foorth to meet with thee.
Off with his head and set it on Yorke Gates, So Yorke maie ouerlooke the towne of Yorke.
After this dangerous fight and haplesse warre, doth my noble brother Richard fare? Rich.
cannot ioy be resolu'de, Where our ght valiant father is become.
see him beare himselfe, As a heard of neat, So our valiant father, Me thinkes tis enough to be his sonne.
Edw. the opes her golden gates, And takes her farewell of the glorious sun, doe see three suns? Rich Three glorious suns, seperated by a racking Cloud, but in a pale cleere shining skie. they ioine, embrace, and seeme to vowde some league inuiolate: are they but one lampe, one light, one sun, In this the heauens doth figure some euent.
thinke it cites vs brother to the field, That we the sonnes of braue Plantagenet Alreadie each one shining by his meed, May ioine in one and ouerpeere the world, As this the earth, and therefore hence forward, Ile beare vpon my Target, three faire shining suns.
Oh one that was a wofull looker on, When as the noble Duke of Yorke was slaine.
When as the noble Duke was put to slight, And then pursu'de by Clifford and the Queene And manie souldiers m:, who all at once Let driue at him and forst the Duke to yeeld: And then they set him on a molehill there, And crownd the gratious Duke in high despite, Who then with ares began to waile his fall.
The Queene euing he did weepe, Gaue a handkercher to wipe his eies, in the bloud of sweet young Rutland By rough Clifford who weeping tooke it vp.
Then through brest they thrust their bloudy swordes, Who like a fell at the butchers feete.
Then on the gates of Yorke they set his head, And there it doth remaine the piteous spectacle That ere mine eies beheld.
Sweet Duke of Yorke our prop to leane vpon, Now thou art gone there is no hope for vs: Now my soules pallace is become a prison.
Oh would she breake from of my breast, For neuer shall haue more ioie.
cannot weepe, for all my breasts moisture Scarse serues to quench my burning hart: cannot ioie till this white rose be dide, Euen in the hart bloud of the house of Lancaster.
Richard· bare thy name, and Ile reuenge thy death, Or die my selfe in seeking of reuenge.
His name that valiant Duke hath with thee, His chaire and Dukedome that remaines for me.
Nay, if thou be that princely Eagles bird, Shew thy descent by gazing gainst the sunne.
For chaire, and dukedome, Throne and kingdome saie: For that is thine, or else thou wert not his? Enter the Earle of Warwike, Montague with drum, ancient, and souldiers.
How now faire Lords: what sare? what newes abroad? Rich.
Ah Warwike? should we report the balefull N, at each words deliuerance stab poinyardes In our flesh till all were told, the words would adde More then the wounds, Ah valiant Lord the Duke of Yorke is slaine.
Ah Warwike Warwike that Plantagenet Which held thee deere: I, euen an his soules redemption, Is by the ne L. Clifford done to death.
And now to adde more measure to your woes, come to tell you things since then befalne.
After the bloudie fraie at Wakefield fought, Where your braue father breath'd his latest gaspe, Tidings as swiflie as the post could runne, Was brought me of your losse, and his departure.
then in London keeper of the King Mustred my gathered flockes of friends, And verie vvell appointed as thought, Marcht to saint Albons to entercept the Queene Bearing the King in my behalfe along, For by my scoutes was aduertised, That she was comming, with a full intent To dash your late decree in parliament, Touching king Henries heires and your succession.
Short tale to make, we at Saint Albons met, Our battels ioinde, and both sides fiercelie fought.
But whether twas the coldnesse of the king, He lookt full gentlie on his warlike Queene That robde my souldiers of their heated spleene.
Or whether twas report of his successe, Or more then common feare of Cliffords rigor, Who thunders to his captaines bloud and death, cannot tell.
But to conclude with truth, Their weapons like to lightnings went and came.
Our souldiers like the might Owles lasie flight, Or like an idle thresher with a Fel gentlie downe as if they smote their friends.
cheerd them vp with iustice of the cause, With promise of hie paie and great rewardes, But all in vaine, they had no harts to fight, Nor we in them no hope to win the daie, So that We fled.
The king vnto the Queene Lord George your brother, Norffolke and my selfe, In hast, post hast, are come to ioine with you, For in the marches here we heard you were, Making another head to fight againe.
How farre hence is the Duke with his power? And when came George from Burgundie to England? War.
Some fiue miles off the Duke is with his power, But as for your brother he was latelie sent From your kind Aunt, Duches of Burgundie With aide of souldiers gainst this needfull warre.
Oft haue heard thy praises in pursute, But nere till now thy scandall of retire.
Nor now my scandall Richard dost thou heare, For thou shalt know that right hand of mine, Can plucke the Diadem from Henries head, And wring the awefull scepter from his fist: Were he as famous and as bold in warre, As he is famde for mildnesse, peace and praier.
know it well Lord Warwike blame me not, Twas loue bare thy glories made me speake.
But in this troublous time, whats to be done? Shall we gothrow away our coates of steele, And clad our bodies in blacke mourning gownes, Numbring our Auemaries with our beades? Or shall we on the helmets of our foes, Tell our deuotion with reuengefull armes? If for the last saie and to it Lords.
Why therefore Warwike came to find you out, And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Attend me Lords, the proud insulting Queene, With Clifford and the haught Northumberland And of their feather manie mo proud birdes, Haue wrought easie melting king like waxe.
He sware consent to your succession, His oath inrolled in the Parliament.
But now to London all the crew are gone, To frustrate his oath or what besides May make against the house of Lancaster.
Now if the helpe of Norffolke and my selfe, Can but amount to
thousand, With all the friendes that thou braue earle of March Among the louing Welshmen canst procure, Why via, To London will we march amaine, And once againe beide our foming steedes, And once againe crie charge vpon the foe, But neuer once againe turne backe and Rich.
I, now me thinkes heare great Warwike speake: Nere maie he liue to see a sunshine daie, That cries when Warwike bids him stay.
Lord Warwike on thy shoulder will leane, And when thou faints, must Edward fall: Which perill heauen forefend.
No longer Earle of March but Duke of Yorke The next degree, is Englands royall king: And king of England and shalt thou be proclaimde, In euery burrough as we passe along: And he that casts not vp his cap for ioie, Shall for the offence make forfeit of his head.
King Edward valiant Richard Montague Stay we no longer dreaming of renowne, But forward to effect these resolutions.
The Duke of Norffolke sends you word by me, The Queene is comming with a puissant power, And craues your companie for speedie councell.
Enter the King and Queene Prince Edward and the Northerne Earles, with drum and Souldiers.
Welcome my Lord to this braue town of York Yonders the head of that ambitious enemie, That sought to be impaled with your crowne.
Doth not the obiect please your eie my Lord? King.
Euen as the rockes please them that feare their wracke.
Withhold reuenge deare God tis not my fault, Nor wittinglie haue infringde my vow.
Clif My gratious Lord, this too much lenitie, And harmefull pittie must be laid aside, To whom do Lyons cast their gentle lookes? Not to the beast that would vsurpe his den.
Whose hand is that the sauage Beare doth licke? Not his that spoiles his young before his face.
Whose the lurking serpentes mortall sting? Not he that sets his foot vpon her backe.
The smallest worme will turne being troden on, And Doues will pecke, in rescue of their broode.
Ambitious Yorke did leuell at thy Crowne, Thou smiling, while he knit his angrie browes.
He but a Duke, would haue his sonne a king, And raise his issue like a louing sire.
Thou being a king blest with a goodlie sonne, Didst giue consent to disinherit him, Which argude thee a most vnnaturall father.
And though mans face be fearefull to their eies, Yet in protect on of their tender ones, Who hath not seene them euen with those same wings Which they haue sometime vsde in fearefull flight, Make warre with him, that climes vnto their nest, Offring their owne liues in their yongs defence? For shame my Lord, make them your president, Were it not pittie that this goodlie boy, should lose his birth right through his fathers fault? And long hereafter saie vnto his child, What my great grandfather and grandfire got, My carelesse father fondlie gaue awaie? Looke on the boy and let his manlie face, Which promiseth successefull fortune to vs all, Steele thy melting thoughtes, To keepe thine owne, and leaue thine owne with him.
Full wel hath Clifford plaid the Orator, Inferring, arguments of mighty force.
That things euill got had euer bad successe, And happie euer was it for that sonne, Whose father for his hoording went to hell? leaue my sonne my vertuous deedes behind, And would my father had left me no more, For all the rest is held at such a rate, As askes a thousand times more care to keepe, Then maie the present profit counteruaile.
Ah cosen Yorke would thy best friendes did know, How it doth greeue me that thy head stands there.
You promisde knighthood to your princelie Vnsheath your sword and straight doe dub him knight.
Edward Plantagenet knight, And learne this lesson boy· draw sword in right Prince.
My father by your kingly leaue, Ile draw it as apparant to the owne, And in that to the death.
Mes. Royall commaunders be in readinesse, For with a band of fiftie thousand men, Comes Warwike backing of the Duke of Yorke.
And in the townes whereas they passe along, Proclaimes him king, and manie flies to him, Prepare your battels, for they be at hand.
would your highnesse would depart the field, The Queene hath best successe when you are absent.
Do good my Lord, and leaue vs to our fortunes.
Good father cheere these noble Lords, Vnsheath your sword, sweet father crie Saint George.
Pitch we our battell heere, for hence wee will not moue.
Edward Now peue Henrie vvilt thou yeelde thy crovvne, And kneele for mercie at thy soueraignes feete? Queen.
Go rate thy minions proud insulting boy, Becomes it thee to be thus malepert, Before thy and lawfull soueraigne? Edw.
am his king and he should bend his knee, was adopted hee by his consent.
For as we heare you that are king Though he weare the Crowne, Haue causde by new act of Parlement To blot our brother out, and put his owne son in.
Crookbacke here stand to answere thee, or any of your sort.
Twas you that kild yong Rutland was it not? Clif.
What saiest thou Henry? wilt thou yeelde thy crowne? Queen.
What, long tongde War dare you speake? When you and met at saint Albones last, Your legs did better seruice than your hands.
I, then twas my turne to flee, but now tis thine.
No nor your manhood Warwike that could make you staie.
Northumberland Northumberland, wee holde Thee reuerentlie Breake off the scarse can refraine the execution of my big swolne Hart, against that Clifford there, that Cruell
Clif Why kild thy father, calst thou him a child? Rich.
like a villaine, and a trecherous coward, As thou didst kill our brother Rutland.
But ere sunne set Ile make thee curse the King.
Haue doone with wordes great Lordes, and Hear me speake.
prethe giue no limits to my tongue, am a king and priuiledge to speake.
My Lord the wound that bred this meeting here Cannot be cru'd with words, therefore be still.
Then executioner vnsheath thy sword, By him that made vs all am resolu'de, That Cliffords manhood hangs vpon his tongue.
What saist thou Henry shall my right or no? thousand men haue broke their fast to daie, That nere shall dine, vnlesse thou yeeld the crowne.
If thou denie their blouds be on thy head, For Yorke in iustice puts his armour on.
If all be right that Warwike saies is right, There is no wrong but all things must be right.
Whosoeuer got thee, there thy mother stands, For well wot thou hast thy mothers tongue.
But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam, But like a soule mishapen stygmaticke Markt by the destinies to be auoided, As venome Todes, or Lizards fainting lookes.
Iron of Naples hid with English gilt, Thy father beares the of a king.
As if a channell should be calde the Sea; Shames thou not, knowing from whence thou art deRiu'de, to parlie thus with Englands lawfull heires? Edw.
wispe of straw were worth a thousand crowns, To make that shamelesse know her selfe, Thy husbands father reueld in the hart of France And tam'de the French, and made the Doiphin stoope: And had he macht according to his state, He might haue kept that glorie till this daie.
But when he tooke a begger to his bed, And gracst thy poore sire with his bridall daie, Then that bred a showre for him Which washt his fathers fortunes out of France, And heapt seditions on his crowne at home.
For what hath mou'd these tumults but thy pride? Hadst thou beene meeke, our title yet had slept? And we in pittie of the gentle king, Had slipt our claime vntill an other age.
But when we saw our summer brought the gaine, And that the haruest brought vs no increase, We set the axe to thy vsurping root, And though the edge haue something hit our selues, Yet know thou we will neuer cease to strike, Till we haue hewne thee downe, Or bath'd thy growing with our heated blouds.
And in this resolution, defie thee, Not willing anie longer conference, Since thou deniest the gentle king to speake.
Sound trumpets, let our bloudie colours waue, And either victorie or else a graue, Quee.
Hence wrangling woman, Ile no longer staie, Thy words will cost ten thousand liues to daie.
Sore spent with toile as runners with the race, laie me downe a little while to breath, For strokes receiude, and manie blowes repaide, Hath robd my strong knit sinnews of their strength, And force perforce needes must rest my selfe.
Smile gentle heauens or strike vngentle death, That we maie die vnlesse we gaine the daie: What fatall starre malignant frownes from heauen Vpon the harmelesse line of Yorkes house? Enter George.
Come brother, come, lets to the field againe, For yet theres hope inough to win the daie: Then let vs backe to cheere our fainting Troupes, Lest they retire now we haue left the field.
How now my lords: what hap, what hope of good· Enter Richard running.
Ah Warwike why haste thou withdrawne thy selfe? Thy noble father in the thickest thronges, Cride still for Warwike his thrise valiant son, Vntill with thousand swords he was beset, And manie wounds made in aged brest, And as he tottering sate vpon his sleede, He his hand to me and cride aloud· Richard commend me to my valiant sonne, And he cride Warwike reuenge my death, And with those words he tumbled off his horse, And so the noble Salsbury gaue vp the ghost.
War. let the earth be drunken with his bloud, Ile kill my horse because not she: And here to God of heauen make a vow, Neuer to passe from this bloudy field Till am full reuenged for his death.
Lord Warwike bend my knees with thine, And in that vow now ioine my soule to thee, Thou setter vp and puller downe of kings, vouchsafe a gentle victorie to vs, Or let vs die before we loose the daie: George.
Then let vs haste to cheere the souldiers And call them pillers that will stand to vs, And hiely promise to remunerate Their trustie seruice, in these dangerous warres.
Come, come awaie, and stand not to debate, For yet is hope of fortune good enough.
Brothers, giue me your hands, and let vs part And take our leaues vntill we meet againe, Where ere it be in heauen or in earth.
Now that neuer wept, now melt in wo, To see these dire mishaps continue so.
Alarmes, and then enter Richard at one dore and Clifford at the other.
Now Clifford for Yorke young Rutlands death, This thirsty sword that longs to drinke thy bloud, Shall lop thy limmes, and slise thy cursed hart, For to reuenge the murders thou hast made.
Now Richard am with thee here alone, This is the hand that stabd thy father Yorke· And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland And heres the heart that triumphs in the dthes, And cheeres these hands that slew thy and brother, To execute the like vpon thy selfe, And so haue at thee.
They fight, and then enters Warwike and rescues Richard then exeunt omnes.
Oh gratious God of heauen looke downe on vs, And set some endes to these incessant griefes, How like a mastlesse ship vpon the seas, This woful battaile doth continue still, Now leaning this way, now to that side driue, And none doth know to whom the daie will fall.
would my death might staie these ciuilliars! Would had neuer raind, nor nere bin king.
Margret and Clifford chide me from the fielde, Swearing they had best successe when was thence.
Would God that were dead so all were well, Or would my crowne suffice, were content To yeeld it them and liue a priuate life.
Enter a souldier with a dead man in his armes.
Sould Il blowes the wind that profits no bodie, This man that haue slaine in fight to daie, Maie be possessed of some store of crownes, And will search to find them if can, But stay.
Me thinkes it is my fathers face, Oh tis he whom haue slaine in fight, From London was prest out by the king, My father he came on the part of Yorke And in this conflict haue slaine my father: Oh pardon God, knew not what did, And pardon father, for knew thee not.
Lie there thou that foughtst with me so stoutly, Now let me see what store of gold thou haste, But staie, me thinkes this is no famous face: Oh no it is my sonne that haue slaine in sight, monstrous times begetting such euents, How cruel bloudy, and ironious, This deadlie quarrell dailie doth beget, Poore boy thy gaue thee lif too late, And hath thee of thy life too sone.
King Wo aboue wo, griefe more then common griese, Whilst Lyons warre and battaile for their dens, Poore lambs do feele the rigor of their wraths: The red rose and the white are on his face, The fatall colours of our striuing houses, Wither one rose, and let the other flourish, For if you striue, ten thousand liues must perish.
How will my mother for my fathers death, Take on with me and nere be satisfide?
How will my wife for slaughter of my son, Take on with me and nere be satisfide? King.
How will the people now misdeeme their king, Oh would my death their mindes could satisfie.
Was euer son so rude his fathers bloud to spil? Soul.
Was euer father so vnnaturall his son to kill? King.
Ile beare thee hence from this accursed place, For wo is me to see my fathers face.
Ile beare thee hence let them fight that wil, For haue murdered where should not kill.
K. Hen. Weepe wretched man, Ile lay thee teare for tear, Here sits a king as woe begone as thee.
Awaie my Lord to Barwicke presentlie, The daie our friends are murdered, No hope is left for vs, therefore awaie· Enter prince Edward.
Oh father flie, our men haue left the field, Take horse sweet father, let vs saue our selues.
Awaie my Lord for vengance comes along with him: Nay stand not to expostulate make hast, Or else come after, Ile awaie before.
Hen. Naie staie good Exeter for Ile along with thee.
Heere burnes my candell That whilst it lasted gaue king Henry light· Ah Lancaster feare thine ouerthrow, More then my bodies parting from my soule.
My loue and feare glude manie friendes to thee, And now die, that tough commixture melts.
Impairing Henry strengthened misproud Yorke The common people swarme like summer flies, And whither flies the Gnats but to the sun? And who shines now but Henries enemie? Oh Phbus hadst thou neuer giuen consent, That should checke thy fierie steedes, Thy burning carre had neuer scorcht the earth.
And Henry hadst thou liu'd as kings should doe, And as thy father and his father did, Giuing no foot vnto the house of Yorke and ten thousand in this wofull land, Had left no mourning Widdowes for our deathes, And thou this daie hadst kept thy throne in peace.
For what doth cherish weedes but gentle aire? And what makes robbers bold but lenitie? Bootlesse are plaintes, and curelesse are my woundes, No waie to flie, no strength to hold our flight, The foe is mercilesse and will not pittie me, And at their hands haue deserude no pittie.
The aire is got into my bleeding wounds, And much effuse of bloud doth make me faint, Come Yorke and Richard, Warwike and the rest, stabde your fathers, now come split my brest.
Thus farre our fortunes keepes an vpward Course, and we are grast with wreathes of victorie.
Some troopes pursue the bloudie minded Queene, That now towards Barwike amae, But thinke you that Clifford is sled awaie with them? War.
No, tis impossible he should escape, For though before his face speake the words, Your brother Richard markt him for the graue.
Edw. Harke what soule is this that takes his heauy leaue? Rich.
See who it is, and now the battailes ended, Friend or foe, let him be friendlie vsed.
Who kild our tender brother Rutland And stabd our princelie father Duke of Yorke.
From off the gates of Yorke fetch downe the Head, Your fathers head which Clifford placed there, Insteed of that, let his supplie the roome.
Bring forth that fatall skrichowle to our house, That nothing sung to vs but bloud and death, Now his euill boding tongue no more shall speake.
Say Clifford doest thou know who speakes to thee? Darke cloudie death oreshades his beames of life, And he nor sees nor heares vs what we saie.
Oh would he did, and so perhaps he doth, And tis his policie that in the time of death, He might auoid such bitter stormes as he In his houre of death did giue vnto our father.
Tis hard, when Clifford cannot foord his friend an oath.
By this know hees dead, and by my soule, Would this right hand buy but an howres life, That in all contempt might raile at him.
Ide cut it off and with the issuing bloud, Stifle the villaine whose inst inched thirst, Yorke and young Rutland could not satisfie.
but he is dead, off with the traitors head, And reare it in the place your fathers stands.
And now to London with triumphant march, There to be crowned Englands lawfull king.
From thence shall Warwike crosse the seas to France And aske the ladie Bona for thy Queene So shalt thou sinew both these landes togither, And hauing France thy friend thou needst not dread, The scattered foe that hopes to rise againe.
And though they cannot greatly sting to hurt, Yet looke to haue them busie to offend thine eares.
First Ile see the coronation done, And afterward Ile crosse the seas to France To effect this marriage if it please my Lord.
Edw. Euen as thou wilt good Warwike let it be.
We here create thee Duke of Clarence and girt thee with the sword.
Warwike as my selfe shal do vndo as him pleaseth best.
Let me be Duke of Clarenco, George of Gloster For Glosters Duke dome is too ominous.
Come lets take our stands vpon this hill, And by and by the deere will come this waie.
But staie, heere come a man, lets listen him a while.
From Scotland am stolne euen of pure loue, And thus disguisde to greet my natiue land.
No, Henrie no It is no land of thine, No bending knee will call thee Caesar now, No humble sus sues to thee for right, For how canst thou helpe them and not thy selfe? Keeper.
marrie sir, here is a deere, his skin is a Keepers fee· Sirra stand close, for as thinke, This is the king, king Edward hath deposde.
My Queene and sonne poore soules are gone to France and as heare the great commanding Warwike To intreat a marriage with the ladie Bona If this be true, poore Queene and sonne, Your labour is but spent in vaine, For Lewis is a prince soone wun with words, And Warwike is a subtill Orator.
He laughes and saies, his Edward is instalde, She weepes, and saies her Henry is deposde, He on his right hand asking a wise for Edward She on his left side crauing aide for Henry.
What art thou that talkes of kings and queens? Hen.
man at least, and more cannot be, And men maie talke of kings, and why not I? Keeper.
but thou talkest as if thou wert a king thy selfe.
And if thou be a king where is thy crowne? Hen.
My crowne is in my hart, not on my head.
My crowne is calde content, a crowne that Kings doe seldome times enioy.
And if thou be a king crownd with content, Your crowne content and you, must be content To go with vs vnto the officer, for as we thinke You are our quondam king, K. Edward hath deposde, And therefore we charge you in Gods name the kings To go along with vs vnto the officers.
Gods name be fulfild, your kings name be Obaide, and be you kings, command and Ile obay.
Enter king Edward, Clarence and Gloster, Montague, Hastings and the Lady Gray.
Brothers of Clarence and of Glocester This ladies husband heere sir Gray At the battaile of saint Alkones did lose his life, His lands then were seazed on by the conqueror.
Her sute is now to repossesse those lands, And sith in quarrell of the house of Yorke The noble gentleman did lose his life, In honor we cannot denie her te. Glo.
Edw I, so will, but yet Ile make a pause.
is the wind in that doore? Clarence see the Lady hath some thing to grant, Before the king will grant her humble lute.
He knows the game, how well he keepes the wind.
Ed. Widow come some other time to know our mind.
May it please your grace cannot brooke delaies, beseech your highnesse to dispatch me now.
Ed. Lords giue vs leaue, wee meane to trie this widowes wit.
For you will haue leaue till youth take leaue, And leaue you to your crouch.
Ed. Come hither widdow, howe many children haste thou? Cla.
You shall haue foure and you wil be rulde by him.
Were it not pittie they shoulde loose their fathers lands? La.
Edw. Ile tell thee how these lands are to be got.
Ed What seruice wilt thou doe me if grant it them? La.
Glo. Naic then widow Ile warrant you all your Husbands lands, if you grant to do what he Commands, Fight close or in good faith You catch a clap.
Why stops my Lord, shall not know my taske? Ed.
The match is made, shee seales it with a cursie.
Ed Staie widdow stare, what loue dost thou thinke sue so much to get? La.
My humble seruice, such as subiects owes and the lawes commands.
No by my troth, meant no such loue, But to tell thee the troth, aime to lie with thee.
To tell you plaine my Lord, had rather lie in prison.
Then mine honestie shall be my dower, For by that losse will not purchase them.
Heerein your highnesse wrongs both them and Me, but mightie Lord this merrie inclination Agrees not with the sadnesse of my sute.
Please it your highnes to dismisse me either with or no.
Ed if thou saie to my request, No, if thousaie no to my demand.
Then no my Lord, my sute is at an end.
Ed Her lookes are all repleat with maiestie, One waie or other she is for a king, And she shall be my loue or else my Queene.
Tis better said then done, my gratious Lord, am a subiect sit to iest withall, But far vnfit to be a Soueraigne.
Sweet widdow, by my state sweare, speake No more then what my hart intends, And that is to enioie thee for my loue.
And that is more then will yeeld vnto, know am too bad to be your Queene And yet too good to be your Concubine.
Your grace would be loath my sonnes should call you father.
Thou art a widow and thou hast some children, And by Gods mother being but a bacheler Haue other some Why tis a happy thing To be the father of manie children.
Brothers you muse what talke the widdow And haue had, you would thinke it strange If should marrie her.
Well, ieast on brothers, can tell you, hir Sute is granted for her husbands lands.
And it please your grace, Henry your foe is Taken, and brought as prisoner to your pallace gates.
Edw. Awaie with him and send him to the Tower, And let vs go question with the man about His apprehension.
I, Edward will vse women honourablie, Would he were wasted marrow, bones and all, That from his loines no issue might succeed To hinder me from the golden time looke for, For am not yet lookt on in the world.
First is there Edward, Clarence and Henry And his sonne, and all they lookt for issue Of their loines ere can plant my selfe, cold premeditation for my purpose, What other pleasure is there in the world beside? will go clad my bodie in gaie ornaments, And lull my selfe within a ladies lap, And with sweet Ladies with my words and lookes.
Oh monstrous man, to harbour such a thought· Why loue did scorne me in my mothers wombe.
And for should not deale in hir astaires, Shee did corrupt fraile nature in the flesh, And plasle an enuious mountaine on my backe, Where sits deformity to mocke my bodie, To drie mine arme vp like a withered shrimpe.
To make my legges of an vnequall size, And am then a man to be belou'd? Easier for me to compasse twentie crownes.
Tut can smile, and murder when smile, crie content, to that that greeues me most.
can adde colours to the Camelion, And for a need change shapes with Protheus And set the aspiring Catalin to schoole.
Can doe this, and cannot get the crowne? Tush were it ten times higher, Ile pull it downe.
Enter king Lewis and the ladie and Queene Margaret, Prince Edward and Oxford and others.
Welcome Queene Margaret to the Court of France It sits not Lewis to sit while thou dost stand, Sit by my side, and here vow to thee, Thou shalt haue aide to repossesse thy right, And be at proud Edward from his vsurped seat.
humblie thanke your royall maiestie, And pray the God of heauen to blesse thy state, Great king of France that thus regards our wrongs.
From worthy Edward king of England My Lord and Soueraigne and thy vowed friend, come in kindnes and vnfained loue, First to do greetings to thy royall person, And then to craue a league of amitie, And lastlie to confirme that amitie With nuptiall knot if thou vouchsafe to grant That vertuous ladie Bona thy faire sister, To Englands king in lawfull marriage.
And if this go forward all our hope is done.
And gratious Madam, in our kings behalfe, am commanded with your loue and fauour, Humblie to kisse your hand and with my tongue, To tell the passions of my soueraines hart, Where same late entring at his heedfull cares, Hath plast thy glorious image and thy vertues.
King Lewes and Lady Bona heare me speake, Before you answere Warwike or his words, For hee it is hath done vs all these wrongs.
Because thy father Henry did vsurpe, And thou no more art Prince then shee is Queene.
Then Warwike disanuls great Ioha of Gaunt That did subdue the greatest part of Spaine And after Iohn of Gaunt wise Henry the fourth, Whose wisedome was a mirrour to the world.
And after this wise prince Henry the fift, Who with his prowesse conquered all France From these our Henries lincallie discent.
Oxford how haps that in this smooth discourse You told not how Henry the sixt had lost All that Henry the fift had gotten.
Me thinkes these peeres of France should smile at that, But for the rest you tell a pettigree Of three score and two yeares a sillie time, To make prescription for a kingdomes worth.
Why Warwike canst thou thy king, Whom thou obeyedst thirtie and eight yeeres, And bewray thy treasons with a War.
Can Oxford that did euer fence the right, Now buckler falshood with a pettigree? For leaue Henry and call Edward king.
Call him my king by whom mine elder Brother the Lord Aubray Vere was done to death, And more than so, my father euen in the Downefall of his mellowed yeares, When age did call him to the dore of No Warwike no, whilst life vpholds this arme, This arme vpholds the house of Lancaster.
Queene Margaret prince Edward and Oxford to forbeare a while, Till doe talke a word with Warwike.
Now Warwike euen vpon thy honor tell me true; Is Edward lawfull king or no? For were loath to linke with him, that is not lawful heir.
Such it seemes As maie beseeme a monarke like himselfe.
My selfe haue often heard him se and sweare, That this his loue was an eternall plant, The whereof was fixt in vertues ground, The leaues and fruite maintainde with sun, Exempt from enuie, but not from disdaine, Vnlesse the ladie Bona quite his paine.
Your grant or your denial shall be mine, But ere this daie must confesse, when Haue heard your kings deserts recounted, Mine eares haue tempted iudgement to desire.
Then draw neere Queene Margaret and be a Witnesse, that Bona shall be wife to the English king.
Henry now liues in Scotland at his ease, Where hauing nothing nothing can be lose, And as for you your seife our quondun Queene, You haue a father able to mainetaine your state, And better twere to trouble him them France.
My Lord ambassador this letter is for you, Sent from your brother Marquis Montague.
like it well that our saire Queene and mistresse, Smiles at her newes when Warwike frets as his.
What hath your king married the Ladie Gray And now to excuse himselfe sends vs a post of papers? How dares he presume to vse vs thus? Quee.
King Lewis here protest in sight of heauen, And by the hope haue of heauenlie blisle, That am cleare from this misdeed of Edwards.
No more my king, for dionours me, And most himselfe· if he could see his
My father came vntimelie to his death? Did let passe the abuse done to my neece? Did impale him with the regall Crowne, And thrust king Henry from his natiue home, And most vngratefull doth he vse me thus? My gratious Queene pardon what is past, And henceforth am thy true
will reuenge the wrongs done to ladie Bona And replant Henry in his former state.
Yes Warwike doe quite forget thy former Faults, if now thou wilt become king Henries friend.
So much his friend, his vnfained friend, That if king Lewes vouchsafe to furnish vs With some few bands of chosen souldiers, Ile vndertake to land them on our coast, And force the Tyrant from his seate by warre, Tis not his new made bride shall succour him.
Then at the last am You shall haue aide: and English messenger returne In post, and tell false Edward thy supposed That Lewis of France is sending ouer Maskers To reuell it with him and his new bride.
Bona Tell him in hope heele be a Widower shortlie, Ile weare the willow garland for sake.
Tell him my mourning weedes be laidle aside, And am readie to put armour on.
Tell him from me, that he hath done me wrong, And therefore Ile vncrowne him er'e be long.
But now tell me Warwike what assurance shall haue of thy true loyaltie? War.
This shall assure my constant loyaltie, If that our Queene and this young prince agree, Ile ioine mine eldest daughter and my ioie To him forthwith in holie wedlockes bandes.
Withall my hart, that match like full wel, Loue her sonne Edward shee is faite and yong, And giue thy hand to Warwike for thy loue.
It is enough, and now we will prepare, To leuie for to go with you.
And you Lord Bourbon our high Admirall, Shall waft them safelie to the English coast, And chase proud Edward from his slumbring trance, For mocking marriage with the name of France.
from Edward as mbassadour But returne his sworne and mortall Matter of marriage was the charge he gaue me, But dreadfull warre shall answere his demand.
Had he none else to make a stale but me? Then none but shall turne his iest to sorrow.
was the that raisde him to the crowne, And Ile be chiefe to bring him downe againe, Not that pittie Henries miserie, But seeke reuenge on Edwards mockerie.
Enter king Edward the Queene and Clarence and Gloster and Montague and Hastings and Penbrooke with souldiers.
What thinke you of our marriage with the ladie Gray? Cla.
My Lord, we thinke as Warvvike and Levves That are so slacke in iudgement· that theile take No offence at this suddaine marriage.
Suppose they doe, they are but Levves and Warvvike and am your king and Warvvikes And will be obaied.
And shall, because our king but yet such Sudden marriages seldome proueth well.
Edw. Yea brother Richard are you against vs too? Glo.
Not my Lord, no, God that should Once gaine se your highnesse pleasure, twere a pittie to sunder them that yoake so wel togither.
Edw. your skornes and your dislikes aside, Shew me some reasons why the Ladie Gray Mare not be my loue and Englands Queene? Speake freelie Clarence, Gloster Montague and Hastings.
My Lord then this is my opinion, That Warwike beeing dishonored in his embassage, Doth seeke reuenge to quite his iniuries.
And Levves in regard of his sisters wrongs, Doth with Warwike to supplant your state.
Suppose that and Warwike be By such meanes as can best deuise.
But yet to haue ioind with France in this Alliance, would more haue strengthened this out Common wealth, gainst stormes, Then anie bred marriage.
Let England be true within it selfe, We need not France not any alliance with them.
For this speech the Lord Hastings wel deserues, To haue the daughter and heire of the Lord Hungerford.
And what then? It was our will it should be so? Cla.
I, and for such a thing too the Lord Scales Did well deserue at your hands, to haue the Daughter of the Lord Bonsield and left your Brothers to go seeke elsewhere, but in Your madnes, you butie brotherhood.
Edw Alasse poore Clarence is it for a wife, That thou art Why man be of good cheere, will prouide thee one.
Cla. Naie you plaide the broker for your selfe, That you shall giue me leaue to make my Choise as thinke good, to that intent, shortlie meane to leaue you.
My Lords doe but right and you must Confesse, before it pleasd his highnesse to aduance My state to title of a Queene, That was not ignoble in my birth.
Edw. Forthcare my loue to vpon their frownes, For thee they must obay, shall And if they looke for fauour at my hands.
No letters my Lord, and such without your highnesse speciall pardon dare not late.
We pardon thee, and as neere as thou canst Tell me, What said Lewis to our letters? Mes.
Go tell false Edward thy supposed king, That Lewis of France is sending ouer Maskers, To reuill it with him and his new bride.
But what said Lady Bona to these wrongs? Mes. Tel him she, in hope heele proue a widdower shortly, Ile weare the willow garland for his sake.
She had the wrong, indeed she could saie Little lesse.
But what saide Henries Queene, for as heare, she was then in place? Mes.
Tell him quoth shee my mourning weeds be Doone, and am readie to put armour on.
He more incensed then the rest my Lord, Tell him quoth he, that he hath done me wrong, And therefore Ile vncrowne him er be long.
Ed Ha, Durst the traytor breath out such proude words? But will arme me to preuent the worst.
my good Lord· theare so in friendship, That young Prince Edward marries Warwikes daughter.
What saie you brother Richard will you stand to vs? Glo.
my Lord in despight of all that shall Withstand you For why hath Nature Made me halt downe right, but that Should be valiant and stand to it, for if would, cannot runne awaie.
Edw. Penbrooke go raise an armie presentlie, Pitch vp my tent, for in the field this night meane to rest, and on the morrow morne, Ile march to meet proud Warwike ere he land Those stragling troopes which he hath got in France.
But ere goe Montague and Hastings You of all the rest are neerest allied In bloud to Warwike therefore tell me, if You fauour him more then me or not: Speake truelie, for had rather haue you open Enemies, then hollow friends.
Trust me my Lords all hitherto goes well, The common people by numbers to vs, But see where Sommerset and Clarence comes, Speake suddenlie my Lords, are we all friends? Cla. Feare not that my Lord.
And welcome Summerset hold it cowardise, To rest mistrustfull where a noble hart, Hath pawnde an open hand in signe of loue, Else might thinke that Clarence· Edwards brother, Were but a fained friend to our proceedings, But welcome sweet Clarence my daughter shal be thine.
And now what rests but in nights couerture, Thy brother being careleslie encampt, His souldiers lurking in the towne about, And but attended by a simple guarde, We maie surprise and take him at our pleasure, Our skouts haue found the aduenture verie easie, Then crie king Henry with resolued nundes, And breake we presentlie into his tent.
Why then lets on our waie in silent sort, For Warwike and his friends God and saint George.
This is his tent, and see where his guard doth Stand, Courage my souldiers, now or neuer, But follow me now, and Edward shall be ours.
All· Warwike, a Warwike Alarmes, and Gloster and Hastings shes.
Richard and Hastings let them go, heere is the Duke.
The Duke, why Warwike when we parted Last, thou caldst me king? War.
When you disgraste me in my embassage, Then disgraste you being king, And now am come to create Duke of Yorke how should you gouerne anie kingdome, That knowes not how to vse embassadors, Nor how to vse your brothers brotherlie, to your selfe from enimies.
Well Warwike let fortune doe her worst, Edward in mind will beare himselfe a king.
Then for his minde be Edward Englands king, But Henry now shall weare the English crowne.
Go conuaie him to our brother archbishop of Yorke And when haue fought with Penbrooke his followers, Ile come and tell thee what the ladie Bona saies, And so for a while farewell good Duke of Yorke.
What followes now, all hithertoo goes well, But we must dispatch some letters to France To tell the Queene of our happy fortune, And bid hir come with speed to ioine with vs. War.
thats the first thing that we haue to doe, And free king Henry from imprisonment, And see him seated in his regall throne, Come let vs haste awaie, and hauing past these cares, Ile post to Yorke and see how Edward fares.
Lord Hastings· and VVilliam Stanly Know that the cause sent for you is this.
looke my brother with a slender traine, Should come a hunting in this forrest heere.
The Bishop of Yorke be friends him much, And lets him vse his pleasure in the chase, Now haue priuilie sent him word, How am come with you to rescue him.

What Counsell Lords, Edward from Belgia With hastie Germaines and blunt Hollanders Is past in safetie through the narrow seas, And with his troopes doe march amaine towardes London, And manie giddie people follow him.
Oxf. Tis best to looke to this betimes, For if this doe kindle any further, It will be hard for vs to quench it out.
In Warwike shire haue true harted friends, Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in warre, Them will muster vp, and thou sonne Clarence shalt In Essex, Norfolke and in Kent Stir vp the knights and gentlemen to come with thee· And thou brother Montague in shire, Buckingham and Northampton shire shalt finde, Men well inclinde to doe what thou commands, And thou braue Oxford wondrous well belou'd, Shalt in thy countries muster vp thy friends.

Faire Lords take leaue and stand not to replie, Farewell my soueraigne.
Edw. on the shamefast Henry And once againe conuaie him to the Tower, Awaie with him, will not heare him speake.
And now towards let vs bend our course To meet with Warwike and his confederates.

See brother, where the surlv Warwike mans the wal. War.
vnbid spight, is spotfull Edward come! Where slept our scouts or how are they That we could haue no newes of their repaire? Edw.
Now Warwike wilt thou be sorrie for thy faults, And call Edward king and he will pardon thee.
Naie rather wilt thou draw thy forces backe? Confesse who set thee vp and puld thee downe? Call Warwike patron and be And thou shalt still remaine the Duke of Yorke.
had thought at least be would haue said the king.
but thou art no Atlas for so great a waight, And weakling, Warwike takes his gift againe, Henry is my king, Warwike his subiect· Edw.
prethe gallant Warwike tell me this, What is the bodie when the head is off? Glo. Alasse that Warwike had no more foresight, But whilst he sought to steale the single ten, The king was finelie fingerd from the decke? You poore Henry in the Bishops pallace, And ten to one you'le meet him in the Tower.
Edw. Tis euen so, and yet you are olde Warwike still.
Enter Oxford with drum and souldiers al Oxf. Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster.
The Gates are open, see they enter in, Lets follow them and bid them battaile in the streetes.
No, so some other might set vpon our backes, Weele staie till all be entered, and then follow them.
Two of thy name both Dukes of Summerset, Haue solde their liues vnto the house of Yorke And thou shalt be the third and my sword hold.
Edw. Traitorous Montague thou and thy brother Shall deerelie abie this rebellious act.
And loe where George of Clarence sweepes Along, of power enough to bid his brother battell.
Et tu Brute, wilt thou stab Caesar too? parlie sirra to George of Clarence.
Sound a Parlie, and Richard and Clarence togither, and then Clarence takes his red Rose out of his hat, and throwes it at Warwike.
Father of Warwike know you what this meanes· throw mine infamie at thee, will not ruinate my fathers house, Who gaue his bloud to lime the stones togither, And set vp Lancaster.
Thinkest thou That Clarence is so harsh vnnaturall, To lift his sword against his brothers life, And so proud harted Warwike defie thee, And to my brothers turne my blushing cheekes? Pardon me Edward for amisse, And Richard doe not frowne vpon me, For hence forth proue no vnconstant.
Welcome Clarence and times more welcome, Then if thou neuer hadst deserud out hate.
Now Warwike wilt thou The towne and fight? or shall we beate the Stones about thine eares? War.
Why am not coopt vppe heere for defence, will awaie to presently, And bid thee battaile Edward it thou darest.
Yes Warwike he dares, and leades the waie, Lords to the field, saint George and victorie.
Ah, who is Come to friend or foe, And tell me who is victor or Warwike? Why aske that? my ma bodie shewes, That must yeeld my bodie to the earth.
And by my fall the conquest to my foes, Thus yeelds the Cedar to the ax edge.
Whose armes to the princelie Vnder whose the slept, Whose top branch ouerpeerd Ioues sreading tree.
The wrinkles in my browes now with bloud, Were likened oft to sepulchers.
For who liu'd king, but could his graue? And who durst smile, when Warwike bent his brow? Lo now my gloe smeerd in dust and bloud, My parkes my my mannors that had, Euen now forsake me and of all my lands, Is nothing left me but my bodies length.
Ah Warwike, Warwike cheere vp thy selfe and For thears hope enough to win the daie.
Our warlike Queene with is come from And at landed all traine, And mightst thou then would we neuer flie.
Which then would not flie nor haue now, But Hercules himselfe must yeeld to ods, For me wounds receiu'd, and manie moe repaid, Hath robd my strong knit news of their strength, And spite of needes must yeeld to death.
Thy brother breathd his last, And at the pangs of death heard crie And saie, commend me to my valiant brother, And more he would haue spoke and he said, Which sounded like a a vault, That could not distinguisht for the sound, And so the Montague gaue vp the ghost.
What is pompe, rule, but earth and dust· And liue we how we can, yet the Sweet rest his soule, she Lords and your selues, For Warwike bids you all farewell to
Oxf· Come noble Summerset lets take our horse, And cause retrait be sounded through the campe, That all our friends that remaine aliue·, Maie be awarn'd and themselues by flight.
That done, with them weele post vnto the Queene And once our fortune in Ex ambo.
Thus still our fortune vs victorie, And gts our temples with The bigboond traytor Warwike hath breathde his last, An heauen this daie hath smde vall, But in this cleere and brightsome see a blacke suspitious cloud appeare That will with our glorious sunne Before he gaine his be es, mean those powers which the Queen hath got in Fra~ce Are landed, and meane once more to menace vs. Glo. Oxford and Summerset are sled to And likelie if she haue time to breath, fact on will be full as strong as ours.
We are aduertisde by our louing friends, That they doe hold their course towards

Come lets goe, for if we slacke this faire Bght Summers daie, sharpe winters our hope for haie.
Enter the Queene, Prince Edward Oxford and Summerset drum and souldiers.
Welcome to England my louing friends of Fra~ce And welcome Summerset and Oxford too.
more haue we spread our sailes abroad, And though our tackling be almost consumde, And Warwike as our maine mast ouerthrowne, Yet Lords raise you that sturdie post, That beares the to bring vs vnto rest, And and as willing should For once with carefull mindes guide on the sterne, To beare vs through that dangerous gulfe That heretofore hath swallowed vp our friends.
And if there be, as God forbid there should, Amongst vs a timorous or fearefull man, Let him depart before the battels ioine, he in time of need intise another, And so withdraw the souldiers harts from vs.
will not stand aloofe and bid you fight, But with my sword presse in the thickest thronges, And single Edward from his strongest guard, And hand to hand enforce him for to yeeld, Or leaue my bodie as witnesse of my thoughts.
Women and children of so high resolue, And Warriors faint, why twere perpetuall Shame? Oh braue yong Prince, thy Noble grandfather doth liue againe in thee, Long maiest thou liue to beare his image, And to renew his glories.
And he that turnes and flies when such do fight, Let him to bed, and like the Owle by daie Be hist, and wondered at if he arise.
My Lords, Duke Edward with a mighty power, Is hitherwards to fight with you.
thought it was his pollicie, to take vs vnprouided, But here will we stand and fight it to the death.
See brothers, yonder stands the thornie wood, Which by Gods assistance and your prowesse, Shall with our swords yer night be cleane cut downe.
Lords, Knights gentlemen, what should say, My teares gainesaie, for as you see, drinke The water of mine eies.
Henry your king is prisoner In the tower, his land and all our friends Are quite distrest, and yonder standes The Wolfe that makes all this, Then on Gods name Lords togither cry saint George.
Alarmes to the battell, Yorke flies, then the chambers be discharged.
Then enter the king· Cla Glo. the rest, make a great shout, and crie, for Yorke for Yorke and then the Queene is taken, the prince, Oxf. Sum. and then sound and enter all againe.
Edw. Lo here a period of tumultuous broiles, Awaie with Oxford to Hames castell straight, For Summerset off with his guiltie head.
Now Edward what satisfaction canst thou make, stirring vp my subiects to rebellion? Prin.
Speake like a subiect proud ambitious Yorke, Suppose that am now my fathers mouth, Resigne thy chaire· and where stand kneele thou, Whilst propose the selfesame words to thee, Which traytor thou woudst haue me answere to.
That you might still haue kept your Peticote, and nere haue slolne the Brh from Lancaster.
I· thou wast borne to be a plague to men.
Lasciuious Edward and thou periurd George And thou mishapen Dicke, tell you all, am your better, traytors as you be.
Hold Richard hold, for we haue doone too much alreadie.
Glo Why should she liue to fill the world with words? Edw.
What doth she swound: make meanes for Her recouerie? Glo Clarence excuse me to the king my brother, must to London on a serious matter, Ere you come there· you shall heare more newes.
The Towerman, the Tower, Ile root them out Exit Gloster.
Ah Ned speake to thy mother boy? ah Thou canst not speake.
Traytors, Tyrants, bloudie Homicides, They that stabd Caesar shed no bloud at all, For he was a man, this in respect a childe, And men nere spend then furie on a child, Whats worse then tyrant that maie name, You haue no children Deuils, if you had, The thought of them would then haue stopt your rage, But if you euer hope to haue a sonne, Looke in his youth to haue him so cut off, As Traitors you haue doone this sweet young Edw. Awaie, and beare her hence.
Naie nere beare me hence, dispatch Me heere, heere sheath thy sword, Ile pardon thee my death.
Wilt thou not? Then Clarence doe thou doe it? Cla By Heauen would not doe thee so much ease.
Cla. Didst thou not heare me sweare would not do it? Queen.
I, but thou vsest to forsweare thy selfe, Twas sinne before, but now tis charitie.
the Diuels butcher, hardfauored Richard Richard where art thou? He is not heere, Murder is his almes deed, petitioners For bloud he nere put backe.
So come to you and yours, as to this prince.
Ex. Edw. Clarence whithers Gloster gone? Cla Marrie my Lord to London, and as gesse, to Make a bloudie supper in the Tower.
He is sudden if a thing come in his head.
Well, discharge the common souldiers with paie And thankes, and now let vs towards London, To see our gentle Queene how shee doth fare, For by this hope shee hath a sonne for vs. Exeunt Omnes.
Lord should saie rather, Tis sinne to flatter, good was little better, Good Gloster and good Diuell, were all alike, What scene of Death hath Rosius now to act? Glo. Suspition alwaies haunts a guiltie mind.
The birde once limde doth feare the fatall bush, And the haplesse maile to one poore birde, Haue now the fatall obiect in mine eie, Where my poore young was limde, was caught kild.
Why, what a foole was that of That taught his sonne the office Of a birde, and yet for all that the poore Fowle was drownde.
Dedalus my poore sonne Icarus Thy father Minos that denide our course, Thy brother Edward the sunne that his wings, And thou the gulfe that swallowed him.
Oh better can my brest abide thy daggers point, Then can mine cares that tragike historie.
persecutor am sure thou art, And if murdering innocents be executions, Then know thou art an executioner.
Hen. Hadst thou bin kild when first thou didst presume, Thou hadst not liude to kill a sonne of mine, And thus prophesie of theo.
That manie a Widdow for her husbands death, And many an infants water standing eie, Widowes for their husbands, children for their fathers, Shall curse the time that euer thou wert borne.
The owle sikt at thy birth, an euill signe, The night Crow cride, aboding lucklesse tune, Dogs howld and hideous tempests shooke down trees, The Rauen rookt her on the Chimnies top, And chattering in dismall discord sung, Thy mother felt more then a mothers paine, And yet brought lesse then a mothers hope, To wit· an vndigest created lumpe.
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree, Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast borne, Thus haue we swept suspition from our seat, And made our footstoole of securitie.
Come hither Besse and let me kisse my boie, Young Ned for thee, thine Vncles and my selfe, Haue in our armors watcht the Winters night, Marcht all a foote in summers skalding heat, That thou mightst the crowne in peace, And of out labours thou shalt reape the gaine.
Glo. Ile blast his haruest and your head were laid, For yet am not lookt on in the world.
This shoulder was ordaind so thicke to heaue, And heaue it shall some waight or breake my backe, Worke thou the waie, and thou shalt execute.
Edward, Clarence and Gloster loue my louelie Queene, And kisse your princely nephew brothers both.
The dutie that owe vnto your, Maiestie, seale vpon the rosiate lips of this sweet babe.
And that loue the fruit from whence thou Sprangst, witnesse the louing kisse giue the child.
To saie the truth so Iudas kist his maister, And so he cride all haile· and meant all hae. Edward.
Nowe am seated as my soule delights, Hauing my countries peace, and brothers loues.
What will your grace haue done with Margaret· Ranard her father to the king of France Hath pawnd the Cyssels and Ierusalem And hither haue they sent it for her ransome.
Edw. Awaie with her, and hir hence to France And now what rests but that we spend the time, With stately Triumphs and mirthfull shewes, Such as befits the pleasures of the Court.
Sound drums and Trumpets, farewell to sower annoy, For heere hope begins our lasting ioie.

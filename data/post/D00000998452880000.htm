DIALOGVE between Custom and Veritie concerning the vse and abuse of Dauncing and Minstrelsie.
The night is past, and the daie is at hand, let vs therfore cast away the workes of Darkenes, and let vs put on the ar+mour of light, so that we walke honestly as in the day, not in gluttony and drunkennes neither in chambering and wantonnes, nor in strife and enuyng: but put ye on the Lord Iesus Christe, and take no thought for the flesh to fulfil the lusts of it.

To the godly and faithful Ministers of Christe and Prechers of the Gospel.
Maister Robert Crovvley and Maister Thomas Brasbridge, grace and peace from God the Father through Christe Iesus our Lord be multiplied.
THe benefits which God hath mercyfully powred vpon vs (moste vile wretched sinners) are multitude innumerable, in value inestimable, so that the slender capacitie of our weake wits is not able throughly to comprehend them.
Much lesse the féeble voyce of our stambring tongs woorthyly to declare them.
Among which manyfolde and rich graces: this is to be reconed of gretest price, that he hath blessed vs with the comfortable wrood and glad tidings of our eternall saluatio~, fréely purchased vnto vs by his welbelooued sonne our onely saueour Christe Iesus, and hath by the princely authoritie of his woorthy Minister our moste gracio{us} Quéen brought in again, established, and these thrée and twentie
yéeres continued the same (God graunt that long it may abide, florish and fructifie amo~g vs for all which his vnspekable blessings, he requireth nothing of vs but that we cheerfully take the cup of sal+uation, and giue harty thanks vnto our loouing Lord, and yeeld dutiful obedience vnto the diuine precepts of our gracious God.
But alas who truely performeth these: Is he a grateful receiuer, which reiecteth such a bounteful gift? Dooth he performe loyall obedience, which stubburnly rebelleth against his Lords lawful commaundement? Is not the comfortable message of our happy reconciliation vnto God onely by Christe Ies{us}, despitefully conte~ned of many? Doo not ye moste parte rebelliously in déed resist the perfect law of the Lord? And how then can we be laid dutifully to render vnto our heauenly father that which in respect of his great bountefulnes he may rightly chalenge? As truely as the Lord liueth: vnthankful ingratitude is abbomination vnto the Lord, and stubburn rebellion as the sinne of withcraft.
Why then doo we not dayly and hourely euen euery moment tremble and quake for
feare lest his heuy vengeance terrible wrath fall vpon vs disobedient children, for these and the like sinnes which wée haue vngodly committed But the holy conteine a large volume, and the whole law co~sisteth of many precepts, so that perfectly to draw foorth and in liuely colours to expresse ye manifolds and gréeuous offences which we moste wickedly haue co~mitted against the testi+monies of the highest, dooth require a lon+ger discourse then purpose to prefix or set before this short treatise Yet that we may partely beholde ye euil fauored deformities filthy staines yt abound euen among them yt account them selues moste handsome and beawtiful. let vs look as it were by a glimpse into the cleere mirrour of the pre woord of the Lord.
The almightie Iehoua spake vnto his serua~t Moyses and gaue him this commaundement to deliuer vnto the childre~ of Israel.
for it is a signe between me and you in your generations that ye may knowe that the Lord doo sanctifie you.
Ye shall therfore kéepe the Saboth, for it is holy vnto you.
Héer are two forcible reasons added to the co~maundement, to mooue the people of Israell diligently to obserue the Saboth.
First for that it is a sure signe of their sanctification that they being defiled by the lothsome flithynes of sinne, are sanctified by the Lord and made plesant in his sight.
Secondaryly for that they which pollute the holy Saboth shall suerly dye.
These ought to be sufficie~t to cause men to kéep holy the Saboth day, either for profit, in respect of all worldly things incomparable: or for death, not withstanding all mans deuises ineuitable But wherin consisteth the right vse of the Saboth? and what is it truely to keep holy the Saboth day? If we wil (as we ought) vse and obserue it according to that exquisit order which the Lord hath prescribed in his Sacred woord: we must not doo ye thing that pleaseth our selues: we must not speak our owne woords:
we must not doo after our owne imagination, neither seek our owne wil·
we must keep our selues that we doo no euil in the Lords holy day.
But it is not inough to eschew euil: but we must also doo good.
rest, we must holde greatly of the things that pleaseth the Lord, and kéep his couenaunt,
we must stick to the Lord to serue him to looue his name, to be his serua~ts to fulfil his couena~t, to giue him ye honor.
Now if this straight line be laid to our crooked liues, and this iust rule to our vn+ruly behaueour: oh how far out of square shall we be found? For when doo we more practise our vain pleasures: Whe~ doo we more after our owne wicked immagination? When doo we more séek our owne froward wil? When doo we more speak our owne filthy corrupt woords? When doo we exercise more euil then on the Lords day? As for other dayes euery man in his vocation (if he haue any natu+rall care to maintain him self and his familie) wil apply his worldly businesse, he wil not let a char.
But the holy Saboth is so vnholyly spent, as if it were consecrated to the abhominable idole of fleshly pleasure, rather then to the true seruice of the almighty God: for if there be any match made for the triall of any mastrie, or méeting for meriment (as they terme it) either betwéen town town, or neigh+bour neighbour, or if there be any kéep+ing
ales, either for ye maintenance of the Church, or for some that are fallen into decay.
When must these be tried or doon but vpon the Saboth day? If any go about with a pewter or rather pilfering game (because by offering a shewe of profit, it priuily robbeth men) when must it be played but vpon the Sabaoth day? And who more to be blamed for this then such Iustices vnder whose licence they doo it? is this ye way for Magistrates to showe them selues men fearing God, to giue men licences wheby they may re+belliously break Gods co~maundements them selues,
and be wicked instruments to cause others to doo the same? Let such knowe that the Lord shall iustly lay to their charge, that their hands haue béen chéef in this trespasse.
Moreouer wheras many Minstrels liue idlye moste parte of the wéek when they should woork, doo not they by wicked abuse of their instruments prouoke the people to vnhallow the Lords holy day, by deuelish dauncing the Nurce of much naughtines, and doo not to to many of all degrees with tooth and naile endeuor to vpholde this Idole of wanton
plesure, which prouoketh Gods indigna+tion? The youth doo seruice vnto it with their bodyes, they commit filthy fornication with it, being before maried vnto their husband and head Christe Iesus in Baptisme.
The elder sort offer sacrifice vnto this Idole, so~e wheat, some mault, some Barley, ome other victualls, some money, and by these meanes shew them selues shamelesse Bandes to maintaine their Children and seruants in this spirituall whoordome, béeing by dutie bound to bring them vp as Chaste Virgins, and vndefiled members of Christe.
The auncients or Officers (some of them) are present at this Idole seruice and by their presence (it may be also by their woords promising them aid, and by their déeds giuing them some maintenaunce) incourage these Idolaters to continew and go forwarde in their abhominable seruice, being appointed of God (to whom they shall yéeld and account) for the punishme~t of them that doo euil.
for the suppressing of vice, which should haue the spirit, and pray with Dauid.
turne away mine eyes lest they beholde vanitie, and quicken thou me in thy way.
where GOD by good Magistrates hath quite thrown down this Idole,
sharply reprooued the Idolaters, and iustly banished thamnuz (I mean vain minstrilles) The women mourn lament for him, so that of all sorts to to many conspire to maintain this wanton and fleshly Idola+trie.
The like might be said of diners other abuses, which reign amo~g vs, wher+by the Lords Saboth is greatly prophaned, but for breuitie sake omit them.
Now as we defile the holy Saboth by dooing that which we ought not to doo: so we co~mit the same offence by leauing vndoon ye which we should doo.
For we should holde greatly of ye thing that pleaseth the Lord.
but few regarde it, few professe it, few name it.
We should fulfil his Couenaunt and kéep it, but few doo it, few know it, few read it.
we should stick to the Lord to serue him, but who performeth his seruice? who acknowled+geth it? nay who fléeeth not from it? who yeeldeth not him self as a bondslaue to obay sinne? We should looue his name, but is it not of the greater parte contemned, spited, and hated in the faithful Chri+stians? We should giue him the honour,
but how shamefully doo we dishonor him by drawing sinne togither as it were with Cart ropes? Farre of then are wee from rightly obseruing the Saboth day.
And shall not the consideration of our great disobedience in transgressing this diuine law for euery one of vs to say wt Dauid.
saw the transgressors was gréeued because they kept not thy woord, feare is come vpon me for the wicked, that forsake thy law.
For if that man of God, the holy Prophet was so touched with gréef, and striken with such a feare for the wickednes of other: how much more ought we to be greeued at the very hart, and to be astonied for fear of Gods iust iudgemens, which hang ouer our heads, and are redy to fall vpon vs (but that his endlesse mercy as yet striueth with his iustice) for our owne manifolde and greeuous transgressions,
euen of this precept? For the Lord hath threatned to poure out his wrathful indignation vpon such as polute his Saboth.
If we wil not be obedient vnto him to hallowe it: then shall he set fire vppon the gates of our Cities and townes and it shall burn vp our houses and no man shall be able
These and far more gréeuous threats vttered by him that is able to bring them to passe, should be fearful and terrible vnto our giltie consciences, and should perforce driue vs to remooue (as much as in vs lyeth) all occasions which the subtle enemies of our saluation doo offer to break this commaundement of the Lord Neither is it sufficient to haue regarde of our selues onely, but we are bound by the rule of Christian charitie to seek one an others welth, the which hath been as a spurre to prick me forwarde to attempt this meanes to reclaime some if it maybe, from the shamefull abusing of the Saboth, which is doon by heathnish dauncing and vain Minstrelsie.
But it may peraduenture be thought an vnaduised enterprise and néedlesse woork, for me to attempt the publishing of any thing in print touching this argument seeing other before haue bothe taken in hand, and prosecuted the same.
Vnaduised: because may seem to forget that they haue diligently labored heerin.
Needles: for that the matter is alredy throughly handled, as in other la~guages so especially in our tung for the
To this answer, that am neither forgetful of other mens painful trauail heerin: neither yet dooth their dilige~t discoursing heerof cause me to leaue this mine attempt as a thing néedlesse.
Nay it did rather incourage me, stirre me forwarde to take this little paines that haue be+stowed héerin for the infectious contagion of sinne in generall, and this speciall kinde of poysonable plague of ye deuilish abuse of daunsing and disordered minstrelsie, hath infected as it were ye whole Realme, and run in a manner ouer all the body, almoste fro~ top to toe in times past: but there hath béen a moste souereign medicine prescribed, composed of diuers manners of hearbs of great vertue, gathered out of sundry gardens.
mean many good and graue collected out of the woord of God, and writings of learned men bothe Christian and heathnish, beeing vnited and knit togither of such singuler operation that it purgeth the infected, and preserueth the whole and serueth for all complexions, if they wil receiue it.
This hath been with great diligence labour by diuers godly Preachers
in their Sermons, and some in writing, applyed vnto the infected, and infinit numbers the spirit of God woorking inwardly togither with the outward applicatio~ héerof, haue béen clene purged from this noysome disease, many wel amended, though it stick so deep in the bo+nes of many that it wil hardly out of the flesh.
co~sidering with my self the great commoditie ye redoundeth to the Church of God generaly, and as it were sensibly féeling the helth that hath been restored to many by these meanes, was incouraged to minister this medisine (according to that small skil wherwith God in mercy hath indued me) as occation was offered, in teachi~g.
But seeing many stomackes so quesie that they could not brooke and digest it, many also so full with surfeting by excesse of worldly plesures and fleshly delights, that they would not at all receie it: studied with my self in what sorte might deal, that they might accept it At the last remembering that some delight in prose and some in verses: addressed my self to comprehend this argument in vearses (though not pleasant to the eares of such as delight in va+nitie:
yet hope (by Gods woorking) pro+fitable to the harts of such as reioyce in Veritie that thereby some might taste how good and holsome this medicine is, and if may be that one kinde of meat diuersly dished, may prouoke diuers mens appetites to taste of it, and one bit may another, so that they may féed wel of the same.
Now that if may be certenly knowen, that minister the same that they doo: haue referred the readers to the same gardines and borders, from whence they gathered the seuerall herbes wherof this compound is made, so that not the substance: but the manner of dressing of it is altered.
And if this may be a meane to ad, though it be but one, to the nu~ber of them which by their diligent labor haue been restored: haue my desire, and the perfect recouery of one disordered person beeing reclaimed from the vnchristian prophaning of the Sabboth by the wicked practises before mentioned: shall reioyce me more, then all the scoffing taunts of curious braines shall make me sory, for my plaine and simple handling heerof, the which is doon partely of set purpose for the capacitie of the ignorant,
that they might reap the more profit to their better instruction.
And dout not but either the graue sentences of heathenish men wil mooue some euen for shame lest they should be woorse then heathens, or the godly sayings of christians wil perswade them, or the diuine maiestie of ye testimonies of Gods woord constraine them to renounce these vaine delights of the flesh, and delight them selues in the holy exersises of faithful christians.
But that it may take the better effect: haue thought good (in some respect) to follow the godly practise of ye Apostle Saint Paule,
who after he had certain yéeres preached the gospel among the gentiles: went vp to Ierusalem and declared to them that were chéef of ye Apostles that gospel which he had preached among the Gentiles, lest by any meanes he should run or had run in vaine, not that the Apostle douted of the doctrine which he had taught, or that the certentie of faith dependeth vpon the concent of men: but that he had a brotherly looue towards the babes in Christe, which had scarcely tasted of sound doctrine, that his painfull
preaching might be more profitable vnto the~, he sought to take away the stum+bling blocke which the deceiuers false teachers had cast in their way to hinder their edificatio~, namely that the doctrin which he taught was co~trary to the doctrine of the Apostles.
This was a great te~ptation to ye weak co~sciences of yung christians, to hear that the chéefe doctors and principall pyllars of the Church did disagre, and dissent in doctrin, Paul ther+fore by conferring with the Apostles, and therby making it manyfest that their doctrine was all one, and that it was a deuilishe lye which was bruted abrode by the seducers touching the contrarietie of his doctrine with Peters the other Apostles: taketh away that let whereby Sathan craftily went about to stay the the frée course of the gospell.
For when this was apparaunt his former laboures perished not as fruteles, and he might goe forward with the more frute.
In like manner dealeth this subtil serpte~ in this cause haue in ha~d, for he would bear the simple folke in ha~d, that this heathnish dauncing and vaine piping hath not béen gainsaid but of late, and that by yung heads; which haue
little learning, and that such, which for age are more graue, and for knowledge are of more sound iudgement doo either holde with, or at the least not against the same: and so would kéep them in practise stil.
Therfore to redresse this mischéef, and to prooue that the Deuil héerin speaketh of him self béeing the father of lyes and that that which hath béen alredy taught either by preaching or writing, or heerafter shalbe touching these abuses may become more profitable to the ignorant people: thought good to dedicate this my simple labour vnto you (good Maister Crowley and Maister Brasbridge of whome the one for his olde age beeing found in the way of righteousnes, is to be honored as a reuerend Father: the other in respect of that which he hath doon towards me, is of mée to be reuerenced as a liberall Maister, and bothe for your singuler knowledge to be heard of all men, as learned Maisters in Israell.
For dout not but many, when they shall sée your learned consents héervnto, wil imbrace that which héertofore they haue reiected without due consideration or diligent examination of the
Especally it shall confirme many of your natiue contrie men, which are by Gods mercyful gifts reclaimed from those fleshly vanities, when they shall perceiue that you (the godly fame of whose effectuall faith soundeth among vs) approoue that which they haue receiued of their owne pastours.
therfore not douting of the matter (for certainly knowe that such abuses are not tollorable, nor yet fearing the proofe of it, for am throughly perswaded that it is sufficient for such which are not contentious· but onely that it might be more profitable to our countrie where these abuses are ouermuch vsed) craue your godly consents héer vnto, and desire to publish it vnder the protection of your names, who are wel knowen to be careful furtherers of all godlynes.
Which God graunt (if it be his wil) that ye may long be to the great aduauncement of his glory, the singuler profit of his Church, and the continuall quiet and comfort of your owne consciences.
To the Readers of this tretise, Robert Crowley wisheth the direction of Gods spirit.
YOu haue heer (deer Christia~s) the labours of Thomas Louell (a faithful minister of Chrste, and disposer of Gods secrets) vveerin he hath shevved himself godly, painful, and learned.
Godly, in seeking to set foorth Gods glory, in suppressing (yea rather rooting out) of vice, and aduauncing of vertue: in laboring to reduce the Saboth or dayes of rest, to their right vse: in striuing to stoppe the cours of vvanton youth in Christians· in discharging the office of a good Pastor, not only in ministring of spirituall foode to the sheep of his ovvne folde: but also in vvriting, vvhich may be profitable to the vvhole flock that Christe hath bought vvith so deere a price.
Painful he hath shevved hi~self, in that he hath doon this in a dialogue or talk betvveen tvvoo, vvherin is obiected, and fullie aunsvve+red vvhatsoeuer the fleshly minded is or
can be able to obiect agai~st that vvhich he taketh in hand to teach.
Yea, and further, he hath doon it in (vearse, vvheri~ is much more difficultie then in prose) that therby the carelesse mindes of vvanton perso~s, might be mooued to read or hear, that vvhich othervvise they vvould neuer regarde.
Learned he hath shevved him selfe in that he hath confuted all obiections, and confirmed his ovvne asser+tions, by sufficient aucthoritie of holie scriptures, and also by the iudgeme~t, both of ecclesiasticall and profane vvriters, yea, and by the lavves and constitutions made in generall counsailes, and in our ovvne parliaments also.
Receiue thankfully therfore these (our brothers) labors so godly, so painfull, and so learned.
Imbrace veritie, vve he not maried to custome: but to Christ.
He neuer said, am custom: But thus he hath said.
Let vs therfore vvalke in him: that vvhen our iourney shalbe ended: vve may enter vvith him into that endles rest, vvherof
And liue vvith him in that endles life that he hath prepared for vs, vvhich God for his mercie sake graunt vs all to doo.
WHe~ beholde ye discord great bout things of sundry kinde: one thi~g aboue ye rest there is that runs oft in my minde.
Some fréend therfore seek to finde, to him the same to showe: And it discust betwixt vs two, the truthe therof to knowe.
Ah fréend, wel met for one wisht, a matter to dissolue: Wherof greatly stand in dout, and oft in minde reuolue
If my small skil in any wise, to you may profit bring: In honest cause it shall not want, therfore declare the thing.
But first your name doo demaunde, and that the truthe be tolde: Euen as you think herein and that, you nothing doo with holde.
the trueth therfore tel: And hate all lyes and flatterie, though few doo like me wel:
For to discourse my cause you are, the chéefst that could be found: For Custome I, and you the trueth, therof shall search the ground.
The knot that would haue vntied is in the great dissent: Of men conscerning dauncing, which hear in haue right iudgement.
Your cause is hard to be discust, and trueth therin to tel: Gets many foes of all degrées, Dauncing they like so wel.
Yet sith that trueth is great, and dooth preuaile in spight of all: Confirme thy cause, if thou haue ought, confute the same shall.
In this conflict and battel fearce, in front shall Scripture be: As Armor strongst that thou therwith, dismaid, the rest maist flée.
Did leap and daunce before the Arke, as sacred Scriptures tell.
Veritie, That noble king and man of God, before the Arke did spring: With dauncing leapes, with all his hart but for no worldly thing.
But praisd the Lord, which had him set, on royall seat as King: And eke because the mightie Ark, they back again did bring.
And Micol, which this humble king, did rashly scoffe and scorne: Had this rewarde, that of her womb, no Childe at all was born.
When Dauid Victor did return, and great Goliah kild: With songes the women with daunce, did méet him in the féeld.
They sung daunst and musick made, not for their fleshly lust: But for to sée that Giant quaild, and lye now dead in dust.
Which did before blaspheme their God, and sore their harts afright:
the women daunced and ioyd: When Iewes did paue the sea as land and nothing them annoyed.
The cause of mirth, as was before, for that the Lord did saue: His owne, and did his foes all drown, with waters surging waue
Likewise when Iephtha Captain stout, with triumph home did fléet: His daughter sole, with Timbrell shril, and daunces him did méet.
To Iewes a common vse it was, to ioy at victory.
But what to that Saint Luke to vs, dooth showe in Gospel plain: When the lost Childe and prodigall returned home again? His parents made great mellodie, glad daunsing eke was heard: déem therfore that men may mirth and plesant daunce regarde.
Ah, wher's the parent that dooth daunce, or mirth for his cause make: To sée his sonne leaue his lewd life, and wicked waies forsake? Our custome is clene contrarie, we laugh and mery be; To sée them wanton, proud, vnchaste, and liue in lechery.
And practice that which dooth vs make, to stinck before the Lord: For which, except we doo repent, we shall be clene abhord.
The woord of God you wrest a wry, to make your cause séem right: From it flée, and for defence,
Gods Gospell and his woorthy woord, neither wrest nor wring: But as the text wil teach all those, that wil attend reading.
Turn to the bookes, weigh wel ye woords where these recorded be: That the truthe hearin haue tolde, moste plainly shalt thou sée.
The~ dauncing dames delight falles down in Gods woord hath no stay: Now let vs heare what reasons reach, too saue the same can say.
First reason saith that daunces neat, cause many men to catch, faithful wife, with whome too liue, yf they can wisely watch.
woorser way who can deuise, an honest Spouse to choose: Then at such foolish fantasies, where lewd life they doo vse? Gods book bid'th man vse other meanes
That she haue better qualities, then traces fine to tread.
if viewed he doo minde: In honest sort let him demaund, chaste mariage may them binde.
Her Parents paths eke let him prye, what life they long haue led: What law they looue, how they haue, their tender babes vp bred.
Let parents in this case consent, so better may they thriue: wary way he ought to woork, which dooth begin to wiue.
her fit to be thy mate: Of sacred scriptures counsaile learne, This cause they doo debate.
Where one by dauncing dooth obtain, a spouse that may him make: Twenty doo make deer fréends their foes while wiues they rashly take.
For making one, and that by chaunce, let many not be mard: Let men therfore those honest meanes, in wedding, wiues regard.
Again, while they doo tread their trace, and lightly leap about:
While Silla they doo séem to shun, in Charibd they doo fall: While thoughts they flee, euil déeds they doo to stil to sinne are thrall.
But hée that sinne by sinne dooth séek, out of his minde to thrust: Walkes not the way he ought to tread, if that in God he trust.
If foolish fancies thou shalt finde, thy soule sore to assault:
Salue of the sacred Scriptures séek, which put such foes to flight: Vse godly games and modest mirth, and that in seemly sight.
So shall these hellish sinnes so fearce, no holde in thy hart haue: And solace eke thou maist thy self, if honest mirth thou craue.
Our youthful race how shall we run, wil lusty Lads reply: On Saboths, Feasts and holy dayes, if you lay dauncing by?
All day like stones in stréet? With tripping toyes, and footing fine, we wil eche other méet.
Six dayes of seuen the Lord hath left, our worldly woorks to plye: And on the seuenth from them to cease, and onely to him hye.
On this day if we leaue the Lord, and sinne doo exercise: What may we plead to claime a place, or parte in Paradice? The Maister wil his Seruant mark, the Father wil his Childe: In transitory trade, that they of them be not beguilde, But how they serue the Lord of Lords, his Saboths to obserue: And lawes to learn, they pas not though their soules for euer sterue.
If Maister, man, Parent or Childe, the dredful doome doost minde: To seek and serue the Lord make haste, while heere thou maist him finde.
goodly sight it seemes to me, and plesant to the eye:
At tune of Tabret, pipe or harp, or Rebecks mery note: They trip on toe, and turn it trim, and shout with shrilling throte.
with iumps and comely grace: They mery make them selues, and all the people in that place.
What godly eye can it delight, what pleasure in it dwel: Which is the line that leads to vice, and hedlong vnto hel.
While men with maides in wanton vnseemly oft doo turn: Their harts blinde Cupid oft dooth cause daunce, with Venus games to burn.
Thus flames of looue incensed are, the effect is yet behinde: Which to obtain, by secret meanes, they showe eche others minde.
If that his mate doo séem to like, the game that hée would haue: He trips her toe and clicks her chéek, to showe what he dooth craue.
Such filthy woords, that they may seem, chaste harts to rauish clene.
While many fondly view this fact, before which liued chaste: Return corrupt, and vnto sinne, with great desire haste.
So dauncing wherof you doo deme, much pleasure to arise: Doth purchase payne and many plunge, Into great miseries.
Though such effects for lack of héed, and wit to some doo chaunce: The sober, wise, and wary take, no harme at all by daunce.
So preaching and the sacraments, of things by chaunce which come: Yf you esteme you must reiect: for death they are to some.
Admit there may a man be found, so fenced with vertues force, (Like phenix rare, and swan so black) whome dauncing cannot worse.
For silie soules where is your care, which Sathan cannot shun: while one doth stand shall number fall
Of things that chaunce how oft they chaunce men iudgment ought to take: And things wherof euil oft doo come, they ought cleane to forsake Some things there are, yt which to kéep the Lord commaunded straight: And vnto mans saluation, are counted of great waight.
Of this sorte are the sacraments, and preaching of gods woord: For wanton dauncing dooth appéere, no precept of the Lord.
Concerning things indifferent, (while they do good) them vse: But if much sin of them do spring, then should we them refuse.
Though often dauncing some mislike, somtime vse it they may: At whitsontide for churches welth, ells youth will nothing pay.
we ought abhorre it ay: And chéefly at that feast we ought, no silthie sporte to play.
That we wit good might be inflamde, and vices might be brent.
When we the flesh should mortify, shall we put sinne in vre? For this abuse, the wrath of God to féel we may be sure.
And though the Lord wil haue an house, where people may frequent: By euil that it maintaind should be, is far from his intent.
But what to God we consecrate, must godly be alway: Men ought prouide by honest meanes, that Church doo not decay.
And they which wil no peny pay, if dauncing be denayd: To daunce, and not for Temples sake, to giue they may be said.
think if dauncing quite were doon, that many seruants might If so they weuld, giue more to Church, yet be in better plight.
At that feast men may mery be, in sober honest wise: But ought to flée such heathnish sportes, wherof much euill dooth rise.
Christmas is a mery time, good mirth therfore to make: yung men and maids togither may, their legs in daunces shake.
Wée se it with some gentlemen, a common vse to be: At that time to pruide to haue, some pleasant minstrelsie.
To loose vs out of sathans bands, from syn to make vs fre.
Then filthie dauncing is no mirth, for children of the light: Suche fleshly lusts frequented are of children of the night.
And that our time we haue euil spent, Sufficient let it be: Like wantons, drunkards, gluttons, and in lusts, Idolatrie.
If men of countenaunce and welth, haue play at Cardes and Dice: And heathnish dauncing in their house, and eke a sea of vice.
(As some men haue) they showe them selues contemnors of Gods woord: Because they practise that which is forbidden by the Lord.
For which contempt, the Lord their ioy, To heuines shall turn: Their mirth to mourning chear, yf him To serue they wil not learn.

So godly blessing to proceed, and deuilish blasphemy: Out of one mouth in no wise ought, this sinne dooth God deny.
But this doo minstrels clene forget, some Godly songs they haue: Some wicked Ballads and vnméet, as companies doo craue.

Where one by minstrels godly songs dooth learn an honest race: To run, ten times so many learn to practise sinne a pace.

Again what office to instruct haue they? not publikely In Church, they are not of the woord
Ne doo they vse the order of priuate instruction: Where by all men eche other teach Christes true religion.
For that is fréely to be doon, without respect of gain: But gain remooue, and to instruct the minstrels take no pain.
Sith publique office they haue none, instruction to vse: And priuate order, as it should be they séem to refuse.
And seeing many more by them are hurt, then taught aright: Directly conclude in them men should not so delight.

The maid possessed with the spright, of diuination: Said, Paule and other taught the way,
And that they were the seruants of the moste high God abooue: And so they were, this many might, haue moou'd the trueth to looue.
Yet Christe the deuils to silence put, and cast them out of man: And would not suffer them to speak, what they did knowe him than.
Paule cast the spright out of the maid, and took it gréeuously: That she (though true it was indéed) of them did testify.
The learned yéeld this reason, why Christe and his Seruant Paule Cast out the deuil because he sought héerby no good at all.
But craftyly he went about, by telling trueth to get: Credit with men, the better to insnare them in his net.

The deuil the same is now, as then, his purpose is all one: In minstrels singing godly songs, he long about hath gon.
Therby such credit he hath got, that now say what he wil: Though handy wicked blasphemous, the same he may say stil.
For wanton and lasciuiouse rimes, are cloked vnder mirth: And blasphemies go vncontrolde, though they be Sathans breth.
And why? forsooth because these men, some Godly songs doo sing: All must be good nothing refused,
Thus Sathan by permission, his purpose hath obtaind: Because so long vncasten out, in men he hath remaind.
These mischéefs therfore to redresse, the course of them to stay: Is sathan to cast out of men, this is the redy way.
The Lord for this, this meane hath left, the preachers with the woord: Must sharply Sathanists rebuke, the Magistrates with swoord, If these togither ioyned be, the deuil for feare wil quake: And out of men run to the Swine, and haste to hellish lake.
The cause why men remain possest, as yet with this foule sin: Is men to execute their charge, straine curtu~e to begin.
The yunger post it to the olde, the olde with custome drownd: For vertue vice, for mirth doo take oft Sathans deadly sound.
The minister, that magistrates should first begin, doo look: The magistrates, by ministers
But nether strike So Sathan hath his pleasure and his will: His whistle doth deceiue the birds, and them for euer kill.

If this could sinck into our heads, and take root in our hart: It would constrain vs, wittingly not from Gods law to start.
But mens eares are dul to hear, their harts more hard then stone: Nothing can pearce their lothsome liues to cause them to bemone.
God make vs fleshly harts (not woorks of flesh to put in vre) And therin print his holy lawes, for euer to indure.
If all things you doo bear in mimde, which rehearsed haue: think you wil, to prooue my cause,

Me, for that which is sayd and prooued, let no man rashly spight: Not gainst right vse, but the abuse of things hath been my fight.
God graunt his spirit may quicken vs, good frute our trées may bring: We may not fall in firye lake, where dooth no mercy spring.
God graunt our noble Quéen may reign long time with happy dayes: To purge out clean all popish dregs, to godlines great staies.
That godly magistrates may strike, and good lawes straightly vse: That deuilish sin they sharply scourge, that men may vice refuse.
And that bothe Prince and magistrates, and Subiects by Gods grace: After this life may rest in heauen, all Christians dwelling place.

[Figure: The Art or crafte of Rhetoryke. [leaf motif] [leaf motif] [leaf motif] [leaf motif] To the reuerende father in god his singuler good lorde the lorde Hugh Faryngton Abbot of Redynge his pore client and perpetuall seruaunt Leonarde Cockes desyreth longe prosperouse lyfe with encreace of honour.
COnsyderynge my speciall good lorde how great ly and how many ways am bounden to your lordshyp and among all other that in so great a nombre of connynge men whiche are now within this region it hath pleased your goodnes to accepte me as worthy for to haue the charge of the instruction bryngynge vp of suche youth as resorteth to your gramer schole fou~ded by your antecessours in this your towne of Redynge studied a longe space what thyng myght do next the busy diligent occupienge of my selfe in your sayd seruyce to the whiche bothe conscience and your stipende doth straytly bynde me that myght be a significacion of my faithfull and seruysable hart which owe to your lordeshyp agayne a long memory bothe of your singuler and beneficiall fauour towarde me: and of myn industry and diligence employed in your ser uyce to some profite: or at the leest way to some delectacion of the inhabitauntes of this noble realme now slouryshynge vnder the most excellent victorious prynce our souerain Lorde kyng Henry the. viii.
And whan had thus long prepensed in my mynde what thynge myght best those out: non offred it selfe more conuenyent to the profyte of yonge studentes (which your good lordshyp hath alwayes tenderly fauoured) and also meter to my {pro}fession: than to make som proper werke of the right pleasaunt and persuadible art of Rhetorique whiche as it is very necessary to all suche as wyll either be Aduoca tes and Proctours in the law: or els apte to be sent in theyr Prynces Ambassades or to be techers of goddes worde in suche maner as may be moost sensible accepte to theyr audience and finally to all them hauynge any thyng to purpose or to speke afore any companye (what someuer they be) So contraryly se no science that is lesse taught declared to Scolers which ought chiefly after the knowledge of Gramer ones had to be instructe in this facul tie without the whiche oftentymes the rude vtteraunce of the Aduocate greatly hindereth and apeyreth his clie~tes cause.
Likewise the vnapt disposicion of the precher (in orderyng his mater) confoundeth the memory of his herers and briefly in declarynge of maters: for lacke of inuencion and order with due elocucion: great tediousnes is engendred to the multitude beyng present by occasion wherof the spe ker is many tymes ere he haue ended his tale: either left almost aloon to his no litle confusio~: or els (which is a lyke rebuke to hym) the audience falleth for werynes of his ineloquent language fast on slepe. wyllynge therfore for my parte to help suche as are destrouse of this Arte (as all surely ought to be which entende to be regarded in any comynaltie) haue partely translated out a werke of Rhetorique wryten in the Latin tongue: and partely compyled of myn owne: and so made a lytle treatyse in maner of an Introductyon into this aforesayd Science: and that in our Englysshe tongue.
Remembrynge that euery good thyng (after the sayeng{is} of the Philosopher) the more comon it is: the more better it is.
And furthermore tru stynge therby to do som pleasure and case to suche as haue by negligence or els fals persuacions be put to the lernyng of other sciences or euer they haue attayned any meane knowlege of the Latin tongue.
whiche my sayd labour humbly offre to your good Lordeshyp as to the chyefe maintener nouryssher of my study besechynge you thoughe it be ferre within your merites done to me to accepte it as the fyrst assay of my pore and simple wyt which yf it may fyrst please your Lordshyp and nexte the reders trust by the ayde of almyghty god to endyte other werkes bothe in this faculty and other to the laude of the hygh godhed of whome all goodnes doth procede and to your Lordshyps pleasure and to profyte and delectacion of the Reder. [leaf motif] WHo someuer desyreth to be a good Oratour or to dyspute and commune of any maner thynge hym behoueth to haue foure thinges.
The fyrst is called Inuencion for he must fyrst of all imagin or Inuent in his mynde what he shall say.
For he must haue wyt to deserue iuge whether tho thynges that he hath founde in his mynde be conuenient to the purpose or nat.
For ofte~tymes yf a man lacke this property he may aswell tell that that is against hym as with hym as experience doth dayly shew.
The thyrde is Disposicion wherby he may know how to order and set euery thynge in his due place leest thoughe his inuencion and iugement be neuer so good he may happen to be counted (as the comon prouerbe sayth) to put the carte afore the horse.
The fourth last is suche thynges as he hath inuented: and by Iugement knowen apte to his purpose whan they are set in theyr order so to speke them that it may be pleasaunt and delectable to the audience so that it may be sayd of hym that hystories make mencion that an olde woman sayd ones by Demosthenes syns hath ben a como~ prouerbe amonge the Grekes [undefined span alphabet] which is as moche to say as (This is he) And this last {pro}perty is called among lerned men (Eloquence.
Of these foure the moost difficile or harde is to inuent what thou must say wherfore of this parte the Rethoricieus whiche be maisters of this Arte: haue writen very moche dilige~tly.
Inuencion is comprehended in certayn places as the Rhetoricieus call them out of whom he that knoweth ye faculty may fetche easely suche thynges as be mete for the mater that he shall speke of which ma ter the Oratours calleth the Theme and in our vulgare tongue it is called improperly the Anthethem.
The theme purposed: we must after the rules of Rhetorique go to our places that shall ano~ shew vnto vs what shall be to our purpose.
IN olde tyme there was greate enuy betwene two noble men of Rome of who~ the one was called Milo the other Clodius which malice grew so ferre that Clodius layd wayte for Milo on a season whan he sholde ryde out of the Citie and in his iourney set vpon hym and there as it chaunced: Clodius was slayne where vpon this Clodius frendes accused Milo to the Cenate of murder.
Tully whiche in tho days was a great Aduocate in Rome sholde plede Miloes cause.
Now it was open that Milo had slayne Clodius but whether he had slayn hym laufully or nat was the double.
So than the Theme of Tullies oracio~ or plee for Milo was this that he had slayne Clodius laufully and therfore he ought nat to be punisshed for the confirmacion wherof (as dothe appere in Tullies oracion) he dyd brynge out of places of Rhetoryque argumentes to {pro}ue his sayd Theme or purpose.
And likewyse must we do whan we haue any mater to speke or comun of.
As if sholde make an oracion to the laude prayse of the Kynges highnes: must for the Inuencyon of suche thynges as be for my purpose go to places of Rhetorique where shall casely finde (after know the rules) that that desyre.
Here is to be noted that there is no Theme but it is conteyned vn der one of the foure causes or for the more playnnes foure kyndes of Oracions.
The fyrste is called Logycall whyche kinde we call properly disputacio~.
The fourth Iudiciall and these thre last be properly called spices or kyndes of oracions whose natures shall be declared seperately hereafter with the crafte that is required in euery of them.
All themes that perteine to Logike either they be simple or compounde.
As yf a man desyre to know of me what Iustice is.
Or if disputacion be had in company vpon religion and wolde declare the very nature of religion my theme shulde be this simple or one thynge religion.
But yf it be doubted whether Iustyce be a vertue or nat and wolde proue the parte affyrma tyue my theme were now compou~de that is to say Iustice is a vertue for it is made of two thynges knyt and vned togither Iustice and vertue.
Here must be noted that Logike is a playn a sure way to instruct a ma~ of the trouth of euery thynge that in it the natures causes partes effectes of thynges are by certayne rules discussed serched out so that nothing can be {per}fectly {pro}perly knowe~ but by rules of Logike which is nothing but an obserua cyon or a dylygent markynge of nature.
whereby in euery thynge mannes reason dothe consyder what is fyrste what last what proper what improper.
If thou enquire what thig Iu stice is whereof it cometh what partes is hath what is the office or effect of euery parte than hast thou dilige~tly serched out the hole nature of Iustice handeled thy simple theme accordyng to the precept{is} of Logicians to whom our auctour leueth suche mas to be discussed of the~ how beit somwhat ye Rhetoricia~s haue to do with ye simple theme asmoche as shall be for theyr entent he wyll shew hereafter.
For many tymes the oratour must vse bothe diffinicions diuisions.
But as they be in Logike playne and compendiouse so are they in Rhetorike exte~ded paynted with many figures ornament{is} belongyng to the science.
Neuertheles to satisfie the reders mynde to alleuiate the tediousnes of serchynge these places wyll open the maner and facion of the handelyng of the theme aforsayd as playnly as can after the preceptes of Logike.
First to serche out the perfite knowlege of Iustice: go to my fyrst place on fetche from Aristotle in his the Diffinicion of Iustice which is this.
Iustice is a morall vertue wherby men be the werkers of rightfull thynges (that is to saye) whereby they bothe loue also do suche thynges as be iust.
This doe: serche the causes of Iustice (that is to say) from whens it toke the fyrst begynnyng and bycause that it is a morall vertue: and Plato in the ende of his Dialogue Meno~ concludeth that all vertue cometh of god: am assured that god is the chief cause of Iustice: declaryng it to the worlde by his Instrument ma~nes wyt whiche the same Plato affyrmeth in the begynnyng of his lawes.
The Diffinicion and cause had: come to the thyrde place called partes to knowe whether there be but one kynde of Iustice or els many.
And for this purpose fynde that Arystotle in the fyfte of his Ethikes deuideth Iustice in two speces or kyndes.
One yt he calleth Iustice legitime or legal an other that he called Equite.
Iustice legall is that that consysteth in the superiours whiche haue power for to make or statute lawes to the iferiours.
And the office or ende of this Iustice is to make suche lawes as be bothe good and accordynge to right and conscience tha~ to declare them whan they are made publisshed as they ought to be to se that they be put in vre for what auaileth it to make neuer so good lawes: yf they be nat obserued and kept.
And finally that the maker of the lawe applye his hole studie mynde to the welthe of his subiectes and to the comon profyte of them.
The other kynde of Iustice whiche men call Equitie is where by a man neyther taketh nor gyueth lesse nor more than he ought but in gyuynge taketh good hede that euery ma~ haue accordynge as he deserueth.
This Equitie is agayne deuyded into Equitie distributyue of comon thynges Equitie Commutatiue.
By Equitie distributyue is distributyd and giuen of comen goodes to euery ma~ accordyng to his deseruyng{is} and as he is worthy to haue.
As to deuide amonge suche as longe to the Chyrche of the Chyrche goodes after the qualitie of theyr merytes: and to them beynge Ciuil persones of the comon treasour of the Citie accordynge as they are worthy.
In this parte is comprehended the punyshment of mysdoers and trangressours of the lawe to whome correccion must be distributed for the comon welth according to theyr demerites after the prescripcions of the lawes of the contrey made determined for the punisshment of any maner of transgressour.
Equity co~mutatiue is a iust maner in the chaungynge of thyng from one to another whose offyce or effect is to kepe iust dealynge in equytie as byenge sellynge all other bargaynes lawfull.
And so are herewith the spices of Iustice declared theyr offices which was the fourth last place.
Our auctour also in a great worke that he hath made vpon Rhetorike declareth the handelynge of a theme symple by the same example of Iustice addynge two pla ces mo whiche are called aines and contraries on this maner.
what is Iustice? vertue whereby to euery thynge is gyuen that that to it belongeth.
what is the cause thereof? Mannes wyll consentynge with lawes maners.
How many kyndes? Two. whiche? Commutatiue Distributiue for in two maners is our medlynge with other men eyther in thynges of our substaunce wares or in gentyll and cyuyle conuersacion.
what thynge is Iustice commutatiue? Right and equitie in all contractes.
How manyfolde is Iustyce dystrybutyue? Either it is comon or priuate.
The comon is called in latin Pitas but in englysshe it may be moost properly named good order which is the crowne of all ver tues conceruynge honest and ciuile conuersacyon of men togither as the hedes with the meane comonalty in good vnity and concorde.
Pryuate or seuerall Iustice dystrybutyue is honest and amyable frendeshyp conuersacion of neighbours.
what are the offyces? To do for euery man ryche or pore of what estate so euer he be and for our contrey for our wyues chyldren and frendes that that ought to be done for euery of them.
Affynes or vertues nigh to Iustice are constancy lyberalytie temperaunce.
And this is the maner of handelynge of a symple Theme dialecty call.
But yet let nat the reder deceyue hym selfe and thynke that the very perfyte knowlege is shewyd hym all here.
And that whiche hath be~ shewed now: is somwhat general and briefe.
More sure and exact knowlege is conteined in Logike to whome wyll aduise the~ that be studiouse to resorte to serche euery thynge in his owne proper facultie.
EUery Theme compounde: eyther it is proued trewe or fals.
Now whether thou wylt pu or improue any thyng: it must be done by argument.
And yt any Theme compounde: be it Logicall or Rhetorycall it must be referred to the rules of Logike by the~ to be proued trew or fals.
For this is the dyfference that is betwene these two sciences that the Logician in dysputynge obserueth certayne rules for the settynge of his wordes being solicitous that there be spoke~ no more nor no lesse than the thynge requyreth that it be euin as plaily spoke~ as it is thought.
But the Rhethorician seketh about boroweth where he can asmoche as he may for to make the symple and playne Logicall argumentes gaye delectable to the
So than the sure iugement of argumentes or reasons must be lerned of the logician but the crafte to set the~ out with pleasaunt figures and to delate the mater belongeth to the Rhetorician.
As in Miloes cause of whome was made mencion afore.
logician wolde briefly argue who so euer violently wyll slee an other may lawfully of the other be slayne in his defence.
Clodius wolde vyolently haue sain Milo wherfore Clodius might laufully be slayne of Milo in Miloes owne defence.
And this argument the logicians call a Sillogisme in Dar whiche Tully in his oracion extendeth that in foure or fyue leues it is scant made an ende of nor no man can haue knowlege whether Tullies argument that he maketh in his oracyon for Milo be a good argumente or nat and howe it holdeth excepte he can by Logyke reduce it to the perfecte and briefe forme of a Sillogisme takynge in the meane season of the Rhetorycyans what ornamentes haue ben cast to for to lyght and augment the oracyon and to gyue it a maiestie.
The places out of whome are founde argumentes for the prouynge or improuynge of compounde Themes are these folowynge.
Diffinicion lyke Cause contrary Partes OF the places of argumentes shall be spoken hereafter.
For as touchyuge the~ in all thynges the Rhetorician Logician do agre.
But as concernynge the crafte to fourme argumentes whan thou hast fou~de them in theyr places that must be lerned of the Logician where he treateth of the fourme of sillogismes es and inductions.
THe vse of an oracion demonstratiue is praise or dispraise whiche kynde or maner of oracion was greatly vsed somtyme in comon accions as dothe declare the oracions of Demosthenes and also many of Thucidides oracions.
As yf a man wolde prayse the kynges hyghnes or dysprayse some yll persone it must be done by an ora cion demonstratiue.
The seconde kynde of an oracion demonstratiue is: where in is praysed or dyspraysed nat the persone but the dede.
As if a thefe put hym selfe in ieopdy for the safegarde of a true ma~ against other theues and murderers the {per}son can nat be praysed for his vicious lyuyng but yet the dede is worthy to be commended.
Or if one shulde speake of Peters denyeng of Christ he hath nothyng to disprayse yt person saue onely for this dede.
The thyrd kynde is: wherin is lauded or blamed nother person nor dede but some other thing as vertue vice iustice iniutie charite enuie pacience wrathe and suche lyke.
The partes of an oracion prescribed of Rhetoriciens are these.
Of the whiche partes mencyon shall be made herafter in euery kynde of oracions for they are nat founde generally in euery oracion but some haue oo partes and some lesse.
GEnerally the Preamble nat alonly in an oracion demonstratiue but also in the other two is conteyned and must be ched out of thre places that is to say beneuolence attencion to make ay to be knowen whiche the oricians call Docilite.
Beneuolence is the place whereby the herer is made willyng to here vs and it is conteyned in the thynge that we speke of them whom we speke to in our owne persone.
The easyest and moost vsed place of beneuolence consysteth in the offyce or duety of the person whan we shew that it is our duety to do that we be about.
Out of this place is fet ye p~a~ble of sait Gregory Nazazene made to the praise of saynt Basyll where he saith that it is his his duety to prayse saynt Basyll for thre causes.
For the great loue and frendeshyp that hath ben always betwene them and agayne for the remembrau~ce of the moost fayre and excellent vertues that were in hym and thyrdely that the chyrch myght haue an example of a good and holy Bysshop.
Trewly by our authours lycence me thynketh that in the preamble Nazazen doth nat only take beneuolence out of the place of his owne persone but allo out of the other two wha~ he sheweth the cause of his duetye for in praysynge his frende he dyd but his duetye.
In praysynge vertues he cam to the place of beneuce of hym that he spake of as touchyng the example that the chyrche shulde haue it was for theyr profite and concernyng the place of beneuolence taken of them that he spake to.
But our authour regarded chiefly the principall proposicion whiche was that saynt Gregory Nazazene was bounde to praise saint Basyll.
lyke example of beneuolence taken out of the place of office or dutie is in the oracyon that Tully made for the Poete Archias whiche begynneth thus.
My lordes that be here iuges yf there be in me any wyt whiche knowe is but small or yf haue any crafty vse of makynge an oracion wherein dee nat but yt haue metely excercysed my selfe or yf any helpe to that science cometh out of other lyberall artes in whome haue occupied al my lyfe surely am bou~de to no man more for them than to Archias whiche may lawfully if may do any any profite by them chalenge a chiefe por cion for hym therin.
Out of this place dyd this same Tully fetche the begynnyng of his fyrste epistle in whome he wrytethe to one Lentule on this maner: do so my deutie in al poyntes towarde you and so great is the loue and reuerence that bere vnto you that all other men say that can do no more and yet me semeth that haue neuer don that that am bounde to do eyther to you or in your cause.
We may also get beneuolence by reason of them whome we make our oracion of: As yf we saye that we can neuer prayse hym to hyghly but yt he is worthy moch more laude and prayse.
And so taketh sait Nazianzene beneuolence in his sayd oracion for samet Basile.
Also of them afore whome we speke as if we say it is for theyr profyte to laude or prayse the {per}son.
And that we knowe very wel howe moche they haue alwayes loued hym and that he ought therfore to be prai sed the more for theyr sakes.
The maner is also to get vs beneuolence in the preface of our oracion by pynchyng and blamyng of our aduersarie.
As doth Tullie in the oracion that he made for one Aulus Cecinna wherin he begynneth his proeme thus If temerite and lake of shame coulde as moche preuayle in plees afore the iustices as doth audacite and temerarious boldenesse in the feldes and deserte places there were no remedie but euen so muste Aulus Cecinna be ouercome in this matter by Sextus Ebucius impudence as he was in the felde ouercome by his insidious audacite.
man may also fetche his proeme out of the nature of the place wher he speketh as Tullie dothe in the oracion made for Pompeius for the sendynge of hym into Asie agaynst kynge Mithridates of Pontus and kynge Tigraues of Armenie on this maner: howe be it my lordes and mai sters of this noble citie of Rome haueal tymes thought it a synguler reioyse to me if myght ones se you gadred to gyther in a co~pany to here some publique oracion of myne and agayne iuged no place to be so ample and so honourable to speke in as this is.
Or he may begyn at the nature of the tyme that is than or at som other cyrcum staunce of his mater as Tully taketh the begynnynge of his oracion for Telius at the tyme this wise.
If so be it my lordes iuges any ma~ be now present here that is ignort of your lawes of your processe in iugement{is} and of your customes surely he may well mar uell what so heynous a mater this shulde be that it onely shulde be syt vppon in an hygh fecst daye whan all the comonaltye after theyr olde custome are gyuen to the sight of playes ordeined after a perpetual vsage for the nones for them all maters of the law laid for the tyme vtterly a part.
He began also an other oracion for one Sert{us} Roseius out of the daunger of the season that he spake in.
One may besyde these vse other maner of prohemes whiche by cause they are nat set out of the very mater it selfe or els the circumstaunces as in these aforsayd they are called peregrine or strau~ge prohemes.
And they be taken out of se~tences sole~pne peticions maners or customes lawes sta tutes of nacyons contreys.
And on this maner dothe Aristides begyn his oracion made to the praise of Rome.
Demoshenes in his racyon made against Eschines toke his preface out of a solempne peticien besechynge the goddes that he might haue as good fauour in yt cause as he had sou~de in all other maters yt he had done afore for the comon welth.
In like maner beginneth Tully the ora cion that he made for one Murena also the oracyon that he made vnto the Romaynes after his retourne from exyle.
He begynneth also an other oracyon whiche he made as touchynge a lawe decreed for the diuision of feldes amonge the comunes out of a custome amonge them on this wyse.
The maner and custome of our olde faders of Rome hath ben. &c.
And this is the maner of prefaces in any oracion whiche is also obserued in the making of epistles how beit there is farre lesse crafte in them than is in an oracyon.
There is yet an other fourme maner to begyn by insinuacion wherfore it beho ueth to know that insinuacion is wha~ in the begynnyng yf the mater seme nat lau dable or honest we find an excuse therfore.
Example Homere in his Iliade describeth one Thersites that he was moost foule and euyll fauored of all the Grekes that came to the batayle of Troye for he was both gogle eyed and lame on the one legge with croked and pynched shulders and a longe pyked hede balde in very many places.
And besyde these fautes he was a great folysshe babler and ryght foule mouthed and ful of debate and stryfe artynge alwayes agaynste the heddes and wyse men of the armye.
Nowe if one wolde take vpon hym to make an oracio~ to the prayse of this losel whiche mater is of litle honesty in it selfe he must vse in stede of a preface an insinuacion.
That what thynge poetes or commune fame doth eyther prayse or dispraise ought nat to be gyuen credence to but rather to be suspecte.
For ones it is the nature of poetes to sayne and lye as bothe Homere and Uirgile which are the princes and heddes of al poetes do witnesse the~ selfe.
Of whome Homere sayth that poetes make many lies and Uirgile he saith: The moost part of the sene is but oeceyte.
Poetes haue sene blake soules vnder the rthe poetes haue fayned and made many lyes of the pale kyngdome of Plato and of the water of Stigie and of dogges in hell.
And agayne co~mune rumours howe often they ben vayne it is so open that it nede nat to be declared.
wherfore his trust is that the hearers wyll more regarde his saynge than fayned fables of poetes and fleyng tales of lyght folkes whiche ar for the more parte the grounders of fame rumours.
An example may be et out of the declamacion that Erasmus made to the prayse of folysshenes.
An other example hath the same Erasmus in his second booke of Copia which is this: Plato in the fyfte dialogue of his communaltie wyllethe that no man shall haue no wyfe of his owne but that euery woman shalbe commune to euery man.
If any man than wolde eyther prayse or defende this mynde of Plato which is both contrarie to Christes religion and to the commune lyuynge of me~ he myght as Erasmus teacheth begynne thus.
knowe very well that this mater whiche haue determyned to speke of wyll seme vnto you at the fyrste herynge nat onely very straunge but also right abhominable.
But that nar withstandynge yf it wyll please you a litle while so deferre you iugement tyll ye haue herde the su~me of suche reasons as wyll brynge forthe in the cause double nothynge but that shall make the trouthe so euydent that you all will with one assent approue it knowlege that ye haue ben hitherto maruelously deceyued in your oppynyon and somdele to alleuiate your myndes ye shall vnderstande that am nat my selfe authour of the thynge but it is the mynde saynge of the excellent moost highly named philosopher Plato whiche was vndoubted so famouse a clerke so discrete a man and soo vertuouse in all his dedes that ye may be sure he wold speke nothig but it were on a right perfyte ground and that the thynge were of it selfe very expedient thoughe peraduenture it shewe ferre otherwise at the fyrst herynge.
In all prefaces of preambles must be good heed taken that they be nat to ferre fet nor to longe.
These affectuouse wordes reioyce am sorye uleruaile am glad for your sake desire sere pray god and such other lyke be very apre for a preface.
THe herers shall be made attent or diligent to giue audience yf the orarour make promyse yt he will shew them new thynges or els necessary or profita ble or yf he say yt it is an harde mater that he hath in handelynge or els obscure nat easy to be vndersta~d except they gyue right good attendaunce. wherfore it is expedyent that yf they wyll haue the percepcion of it that they gyue a good care.
But as concernyng the newnesse or profyte of the mater it maketh nat all onely ye herer to gyue a good cre (which thynge is called attencion) but also maketh hym well wyllynge for to be present whiche is beneuolence.
DOcilite whereby we make the mater playne easy to be perceyued is nat greatly required in this kynde of oracion for it in belonging properly to derke and obscure causes in whiche we must myse that we wyl nat vse great ambages or to go (as me~ say) rou~de about the bush but to be short and playne.
Of narracion whiche is the seconde {per}te of an oracion.
The Narracion or tale wherin {per}sones are praysed is the declaryng of theyr lyfe doynges after the fashion of an historie.
The places out of the whiche it is sought are: The persones byrthe.
IN his byrthe is consydered of what stocke he came what chau~ sed at the tyme of his natiuite or nighe vpon as in the natiuite of Christe shepeherdes hard angelles synge.
In his chyldhode are marked his bryngynge vp and tokens of wysdome co~mynge: As Horace in his fourthe Satire sheweth how in his chyldhode his father taught hym by examples of suche as were than lyuynge to flee from vice and to gyue hym selfe to vertue.
In adolescencie is considered where to he than gyuethe hym selfe: As in the fyrst comedie of Tere~ce one Simo telleth his seruau~t Sosia that though all yonge men for the more parte gyue them selfe to some peculiare thynge wherin they sette theyr chiefe delyght as some to haue goodely horses some to cherysshe houndes for huntyng some are gyuen onely to theyr bookes his sone Pa~philus loued none of these more one tha~ an other and yet in al these he exercised hym selfe mesurably.
In mannes state and olde age is noted what office or rule he bare among his citisens or in his co~trey what actes he dyd how he gouerned suche as were vnd him howe he spered what fortune he had in suche thyng{is} as he went about.
Example here of is in Saluste whiche co~pareth to gether Cato and Cesar sayng that both theyr stocke age eloque~ce were almoost lyke egall theyr excelle~cie greatnes of spirite wytte was also lyke egal lyke fame worshyppe had they both attayned howe be it nat by a lyke waye.
Cato had gotte~ hi~ a name for his {per}fight vpright lyuynge.
The tother wanne moche bruyt by gy uynge large gyfres by helpynge suche as were in dystresse and by forgyuyng of tres passes done agaynste hym.
Cacons fame dyd sprede because he wold neither be forgyuen of none offence neither forgiue non other but as any man had deserued so to cause him to be delt with.
In the one was grat refuge to suche as were in mysery: the other was fore pushment per to mysdoers euyll transgressours law.
Briefly to conclude it was all mynde and pleasure to labour diligently night and day in his frendes cau ses to care lesse for his owne busynes th for theyrs to deny nothing that was wor thy to be asked his desyre was euermore to be in warre to haue a great hoost of me vnder his gouernaunce that by his noble and hardy faicies his valyantnes myght be the more knowen and spred abrood.
Co~traryly all Catons study was on tem perau~ce and to do in no maner other wyse than was conuenient syctynge for suche a man as he was and chiefly he sette his myne to seueryty he neuer made no com parison with the riche man in richesse nor with the myghty man in power.
But required with the hardy ma~ in boldnes with the temperate in moderacion with the good man in innocency iust dea ling.
He cated not for the name it was suf ficie~t to hym to haue the dede so the lesse he cared for glorye the more alwayes he opteyned.
Many suche comparisons very profitable for this inte~t are also in Plu tarche in his boke of noble mennes lyues.
goodly eusa~ple of this place is in the oracion that Hermola{us} Barbarus made to the emperour Frederike and Marimilian his son which for bicause it is so long let it passe.
like ensample is in Tullies oracon that he made to the people of Rome for Pompeyus to be sente agaynst
Some there be that deuide the landes of persones into thre noes of goodes begyunynge the narracion at them whiche thynge our author doth nat greatly commende but raher in rehersyng of any per sones dedes yf there can nat be kept an order of historie and many thynges must be spoken.
It were after his mynde best to touche fyrst his actes done by prudence next by iustice thirdely by fortitude of the mynde and last by temperaunce and so to gather the narracion out of this foure catdinall vertues.
As if one shuld praise saint usten after that he hath spoken of his pa rentele and bryngynge vp in youthe and is come to the rehersale of his actes they may be conueniently distributed into the places of vertues.
suppose (sayeth he) that in hym that shulde be a hed capitayne ouer a great army ought to be foure thynges.
Here is to be noted that in rehersynge any persons actes we may haue our chief respecte to some peculiare and principall vertue in hym enlargynge and exaltynge it by amplificacio~ in maner of a digressio~.
Our author in this worke maketh no mencyon of the last place that is dethe and suche thynges as folowe after but in an other greater work he declareth it thus vrtefly.
The dethe of the persone hathe also his praises as of suche whiche haue ben slayne for the defence of theyr contrey or prince.
very goodly ensample for the handelynge of this place is in an epistle that An gele Policiane writeth in his fourth boke of epistels to Iames Antiquarie of Laurence Medices howe wysely and deuoutly he dysposed hym selfe in his dethe bed and of his departynge and what channced at that tyme.
And so to conclude an oracion Demonstratiue wherein persones are lauded is an historycall exposicion of all his lyfe in order.
And there is no difference betwene this kynde and an history saue that in histories we be more briefe and vse lesse curiositie.
Here all thynges be augme~ted and coloured with as moche ornamentes of eloquence as can be had.
Confirmacion of our purpose and confutynge or reprouynge of the contrarye whiche are the partes of contencion are nat requisite in this kynde of oracion for here are nat treated any doubtefull maters to whome contencion perteineth.
Neuer the lesse somtyme it happeneth (how beit it is seldome) that a doubte may come which must be either defended or a the leest excused.
THe frenche men in olde tyme made myghty warre agaynste the Romaynes and so sore besieged theym that they were by compulcton constrayned to fall to composicion with the frenche men for an huge summe of golde to be payed to theym for the brekynge of the siege but beynge in this extreme misery they sent for one Camillus whome nat very longe afore they had banisshed out of the citie and in his absence made hym dietatour which was the chiefest digintie amonge the Romaynes and of so great auctoritie that for the space of the monethes for so long dured the office moost co~ueniently he might do all thyng at his pleasure whether it concerned deth or no nor no ma~ so hardy ones to say nay against any thyng that he dyd so that for the space he was as a kynge hauynge all in his owne mere power.
Now it chau~ced that while this summe was in payenge nat fully wayed Camillus of whome said afore that being in exile he was made dictatour came with an army and anone bad cease of the payment that eche party shulde make redy to bataile and so he vainquisshed the frenche men.
Now yf one shulde praise hym of his no ble faites it shuld seme that this was done contrary to the law of armes to defait the frenche men of the raumsom due to them sys the compacte was made afore wherfore it is necessary for the orator to defe~d this dede to proue that he did nothynge contrary to equitie.
One apparent whiche is a comon sayenge vsuped of the pote. osus a virtus qui in hoste requirat.
That is to say who will serche whether ye dede of enemy against enemy be either gile or pure valiantnes· But for that in warre law is as well to be kept as in other thinges.
The other is of a more stronge assurau~ce whiche Titus Liuius writeth in his fyfte boke from the buildynge of Rome where he reherceth this history now menetoned and that answere is this that the co~pacte was made to paye the foresayd raunsome after that Camillus was created dictatour at what time it was nat lawfull that they whiche were of ferre lesse auctoritie ye had put them selfe holy in his hande shuld entermedle them with any maner of treatise without his licence that he was nat bounde to stande to theyr bargayne.
The whiche argumente is deducte out of two circumstaunces whereof one is the tyme of the makynge of the compacte and the other the persons that made it which two circumstaunces may briefly be called whan and who.
Likewise yf an oracion shulde be made to the laude of saint Peter it behoueth to excuse his denyenge of christe that it was rather of diuine power and wyll: than otherwise for a confortable example to synners of grace yf they repe~t.
This is the maner of handelynge of an oracion demonstratiue in whiche the person is praised.
The author in his greater worke decla reth the facion by this example.
If one wolde praise kynge Charles he shulde kepe in his oracion this order.
Fyrst in declarynge his parentele that he was kynge Pipines sone whiche was the fyrste of all kynges of Frannee named the moost christen kynge and by whom all after hym had the same name and Nephien to Martell the moost valiauntest prynce that euer was.
Nexte his bryngynge vp vnder one Peter Pisane of whom he was instructe bothe in Greke and Latin.
Tha~ his adolessencie whiche he passed in excercise of armes vnder in his fader in ye warres of Acquitaine where he lerned also the Sarazynes tongue.
Beynge come to mannes state now kynge of Fraunce he suvdued Aquitayn Italye Swauelande and the Saxones.
And these warres were so fortunate that he ouercam his aduersaries more vy aucto ritie and wisdom than by effusion of blode.
Also many other notable examples of vertue were in hym in that age specially that he edifted the vniuersitie of Paris.
Here may by digressio~ be declared how goodly a thynge lernynge is in Prynces.
Here may be also made comparison of his vertues in warre and of other agreynge with peace in the whiche (as his history maketh mencyon) he was more excellent.
For his chiefe delyte was to haue peace and agayne he was so gentyll and so mercyfull that he wolde rather saue uyn suche as had don hym great offence: and had deserued very well for to dye tha~ to dystroye theym thoughe he might do it conueniently.
Besyde this he was so greatly enflamed in the loue of god and his holy chirch that one Alcuine a noble clerk of England was continually with hym in whose prea chynge and other gostely communicacion he had a chiefe pleasure.
His olde age he passed in rest and quyetenes fortunately saue for one thyng that his sonnes agreed euyll betwee them.
After his decease reigned his son holy saint Lewes and so the folowynges of his dethe were suche that they could be no better and a very great token of his good and vertuouse lyuynge.
For yf an yll tree can brynge furthe no good fruite what shall we suppose of this noble kynge Charles of whome cam so vertuouse and so holy a son: Truely me thynketh that hither may be nat inco~ueniently applied the sayenges of the gospell by theyr fruites you shall know them.
WHan we wyll prayse ay maner of dede the moost apte preamble for that purpose shall be to say that the mater perteyneth to the commodities of them whiche here vs. Example.
WHan the Romaynes had expelled theyr kynge whome the hisioriciens call Tarquine the proude out of the citie and sully nacted that they wolde ne uer haue kynge to reigne more ouer them.
This Tarqum{us} went for aide and socour to the kynge of Tuscaye whiche whan he could by no menes entreat the Romains to receiue agayn theyr kyng he cam with all his puissaunce against the citie there long space besieged the Romaynes by rea son wherof great penury of whete was in the citie the kynge of Tuscay had great trust that continuynge the siege he shulde within a litle lenger space compell the Ro maynes thrugh famine to yelde the~ selfe.
In the meane season a yong man of the citie named Gaius Mucius came to the Senatours and shewed them that he was purposed yf they wolde gyue hym licence to go surthe of the citie to do an acte that shuld be for theyr great profite and welth whereupon whan he had obtained licence priuely with weapo~ hyd vnder his vesture he cam to the Tuscans campe gate hym among the thickest ingh to the tent where as the kyng sat with his chaunceller payenge the sowdiis the wages.
And bicause that they were almoost of lyke apparell also the chaunceler spake many thynges as a man beynge in auctoritie he de nat tell whether of theym was the kynge nor he durst nat aske leest his demaunde wolde haue bewrayed hym for as for language they had one nothyng was different for bothe Tuscains Romains were all of Italye as in tymes past Englande hathe had many kynges though the language people were on.
And thus beynge in doubt whether of them he myght steppe vnto by chaunce he strake the chaunceller in stede of the kynge and slew hym wherfore whan he was taken and brought before the kynge for to punysshe his hande that had failed in takyng one for an other and agayn to shew the kynge how he cared for his menaces he thrast his hande into the fire which at that time was there prepared for sacrifyce there in the flame let it brenne nat ones mouynge it.
The kynge greatly marueylynge at his audaci tie hardy nature co~mended hym greatly thereof and bad hym go his way free: For the whiche (as though he wolde make the kyng a great amendes) he fayned that. iii. C. of the noblest yonge men of Rome had conspyred to gyther in lyke maner euery one after another vnwar{is} to slee hym and all to put theyr bodies and liues in hasard tyll tyme shulde chaunce that one myght acheue theyr entent.
For fere whereof the kynge furth with fell at a pointement with the Romaines and departed.
The yonge man afterwarde was named Sceuota whiche is as moche to say in Englyssh as lefte ha~ded.
For as haue reherced afore he brente his right hande so that he had lost the vse therof.
IF any oratour wolde in an oracyon commende this dede he myght conueniently make the preface on this facion.
THere is no doubte my lordes maysters of Rome: but that the reme~braunce of Seeuolaes name is very pleasant vnto your audie~ce whiche with one act that he dyd endewed your citie with many and greate commodytees. &c.
This maner of preface is moost conue nyent and best annexyd to suche maner of oracyons demonstratiues.
Neuer the lesse it is lawfull for vs to take our preface (yf it be our pleasure) oute of some circumstaunce as out of the place that our oracion is made in or out of the tyme that we speke in or els otherwyse accordynge as we shall haue occasyon As Tullie in the oracyon that he made for the restitucyon of Marcus Marcellus in the whiche he praiseth Cezare for the callyng home of the sayd Marc{us} marcellus out of exyle he taketh his preamble out of the tyme and Cezares persone begynnynge thus.
THis daye my lordes Senatoures hath made an ende of the longe scilence that haue kepte a great while nat for any fere that had but part for great sorow that was in me partly for shanie this day as sayd hath taken away that longe scilence ye and besyde that of newe brought to me lust mynde to speke what woulde and what thought moost expe dient like as was afore wont to do.
For can nat in no maner of wyse refrayne but must nedes speke of the great mekenes of Cezare of the graciousnes that is in hym so habu~dant and so great withall that neuer afore any suche hath ben wont to be sene or herde of and also of the excellent good moderacio~ of all thynges which is in hym that hathe all in his owne mere power.
Nor can nat let passe his excelle~t incredible and diuine wisdome vnspoken of afore you at this tyme.
IN this kynde we vse but selden hole narracions oneles we make our ora cion afore them that know nat the history of the acte or dede whiche we be aboute to prayse.
But in stede of a narracion we vse a proposicion on this maner.
AMonge all the noble deedes Cezare that ye haue done there is non that is more worthy to be praysed than this re stitucion of Marke Marcell.
THe places of confirmacion are honesty {per}fite lightnes or hardines of the dede.
For after the proheme of the oracion and the narracion than go we to the prouynge of our mater.
And next that it was nat all only ho nesty: but also profitable.
Thirdely as con+cernyng the easines or difficulty the praise therof must be considered parte in the doer part in the dede.
An easy dede deserueth no great praise but an harde and a ieoper+douse thynge the soner and the lighther it is acheued the more it is to be lauded.
The honesty of the cause is fet from the nature of the thynge yt is spoken of which place lieth in the wytte of the oratour and may also be fet out of the philosophers bo kes.
It is also copiosely declared of Rhetoriciens and very compe~diously handled of Erafmus in his boke entituled of the maner and crafte to make epistels in the chapitre of a persuadyng epistle.
The profyte of the dede or the commoditie may be fet at the circumstaunce of it.
Circumstan~ ces are these what was done who dyd it whan where it was done among whom by whose helpe.
As if one wolde praise Seeuolaes acte of the whiche mencion was made afore he may. whan he cometh to the places of contencion shew fyrst how honest a dede it is for any man to put his lyfe in ieopardy for the defence of his countrey whiche is so moche the more to be commended that it cam of his owne minde and nat by the instigacion of any other and how profitable it was to the citie to remoue so strong and puissaunt an enemy by so good and crafty policy what tyme the citie was nat well assured of all mennes myndes that were within the walles considerynge that but a lytle afore many noble yonge men were detecte of treason in the same busines.
And than also the citie was almoost destitute of vitailes all other commodities necessary for the defence.
Likewise easynes or difficultie are conteyned in the circumstaunces of the cause.
As in the example now spoken of what an harde enterprise it is for one man to entre into a kynges armye and to come to the kynges pauilion in the face of his souldiers to aduenture to slee hym.
COnfutacio~ is the soilyng of suche argumentes as maye be induced agaynst our purpose which part is but lytle vsed in an oracion demonstratiue.
Neuer the lesse somtyme may chan~ce a thyng that must be either defended or els at the leest excused.
As yf any man wolde speke of Camillus dede wherby he recouered his contrey and delyuered it from the handes of the Frenche men.
Here must be declared that the bargayne made afore was nat by Camillus violate.
The places of confutacion be contrary to the places of confirmacion.
THe co~clusion is made of a brief enumeracion of suche thynges that we haue spoken of afore in the oracion in mouynge of affections.
In delectable thinges or suche thinges that haue ben well doue we moue our audience to reioice thereat and to do lyke.
In sad thynges and heuy to be sory for them.
In yll and peruerse act{is} to beware that they folowe nat them to theyr great shame and confusion.
Of an oracion demonstratiue whereu are praised neither persones nor actes but some other thynges as religion matrimony or suche other.
[leaf motif] THe best begynnyng wyll be if be taken out of some high praise of the thynge.
But a man may also begyn otherwyse eyther at his owne perso~ or at theyrs afore whom he speketh or at the place in the whiche he speketh or at the season present or otherwise as hath afore ben specified and here must we take good hede that yf we take vpo~ vs to praise any thynge that is no praise worthy than must we vse insinuacion excuse the turp tude either by examples or by argume~t{is} as Erasmus doth in his epistle prefired afore his oracion made to the prayse of folisshnes of the whiche haue let passe the tra~stacio~ bicause yt epistle is so~ what long.
IN this maner of oracio~ is no at racion but in stede therof the Rhe toriciens all only propose the ma ter.
And this proposicion is in the stede of the narracion.
very elega~t example is in the oracion that Angele Policiane made to the laude of histories whiche is this.
Among all ner of wryters by whom either the Breke tongue or the latine hath ben in floure and excellence without doubte me semeth that they dyd moost profyte to mankynde by whom the excellent dedes of nacions princes or valant men haue ben truely descriued and put in cronicles.
Likewise yf a man praise peace shewe what a commodiouse thynge it is he may make suche a proposicion.
AMonge all the thynges whiche pe teine to ma~nes commoditie of what someuer condicion or nature so euer they be non is so excellent and so worthy to ad in honour and loue as is peace.
The same yt were in the other (of whome mencion was made afore houesty profite easynes or difficulty.
Honesty is considered in the nature of the thynge also in the persones that haue excercysed it and the inuenters thereof.
As in the laude of matrimony be considered the au tour thereof whiche was god hym selfe the antiquite that it was made in the fyrst begynnynge of the worlde and continued (as reason is) to this hour in great honour and reuere~ce.
The persones that haue vsed it were bothe patriarches as Abraham.
And (whiche thyng was fyrst proposed) the nature therof is suche that without it: man shulde be like vnto beest oneles all generacion shuld be put aparte.
And the commau~dement of almighty god nat regarded who bad man and woman shulde engender multiply.
Examples may be taken out of Policians oracio~ made to the laude of two oracions of Erasm{us} one to the laude of phisike and an other to the laude of matrimony.
THe periode or conclusion standeth in the briefe enumeracion of thinges spoken afore and in mouyng the affections as hath ben aboue expressed.
AN oracio~ deliberatiue is by the which we persuade or dissuade any thyng by the whiche we aske or whereby we exhort any man to do a thynge or els to forsake it and this kynde of oracion is moche in vse nat onely in ciuil ematers: but also in epistels.
WE may begynne our oracion in this kynde euyn lyke as we dyd in an or a cion demonstratiue but moost aptly at our office or duety leest some men wolde thynke that we dyd it more of a priuate affection for our owne commoditie and plea sure: than for any other mannes profyte.
And in this maner Salust in his boke of Catheline bringeth in Cezare beginnyng an oracion.
ALl men my lord{is} Senatours which syt concellynge vpon any douvtfull mater must be voyde of hatred frendshyp anger pitye or metye.
For where any these thynges bere a rule mannes mynde can nat lightely perceyue the truthe.
Or els we may begyn at the greatene of the mater or daunger of the thyng tha we speke of as in the fyfte boke of Lus· Camillus maketh the preamble of his cion thus.
MY maysters of this Citie of Ardea which haue ben alwayes myne olde frendes and now (by reason of myne exyle out of Rome) my new neighbours and citizens.
For thank you of your goodnes you haue promysed that it shuld so be and on the other side my fortune hath constray ned me to seke som new dwellynge out of the citie where was brought vp enhabited.
wolde nat that any of you shulde thynke that am now come amonge you nat remembrynge my condicion and state but the como~ reopardy that we be all now in wyll compell euery man to open and shew the best remedy that he knoweth for our socoure in this great fere necessity.
Nat withstandynge this a man may take his begynnynge otherwyse after any of the facions afore recited if he lyst.
Tully in the oracion wherin he aduised the Romaynes to make Pompey theyr chiefe capitaine against Withridates and Tigranes kynges of Ponthus Armeny taketh in the preface beneuolence from his owne persone shewynge by what occasion he myght laufully gyue councell to the Romaines by cause was electe Pretor of the citie. we may also touche our aduersaries in the preface or els we may touche the maners either of som seuerall persons or of the commons in generall.
As in the oracion that Porci{us} Chato made agaynst the sumptuouses of the women of Rome thus begynnynge.
IF euery man my lordes and maisters of this citie wolde obserue and kepe the ryght and maiestye of a man agaynst his owne wife we shuld haue ferte lesse encombrance now with the hole thronge tha~ we haue.
But now our fredome and lybertie is ouercome within our owne dores by the importunatnes of our wyues so auacitie taken therof here troden vnder the fete and oppressed in the parliame~t house: And bycause we wold nat displease no ma~ his owne wyfe at home: here are we now combred with all gathered to gyder on a hepe and brought in that takynge that we dare nat ones open our lyppes against them.
we may also begyn at the nature of the tyme that we speke in or at the nature of the place or at any other circumstaunce or thynge incident.
As Lus in the. ix. boke of his fourthe decade agaynste the feestes that the Romaynes kept in the honour of the ydolyssh god Bacchus begynneth his oracion at prayenge on this wyse.
THe solempne makynge of prayers vnto the goddes was neuer so apte nor yet so necessary in any oracion as it is in this whiche shall shew and admonysshe you that they be very and ryght goddes whom our elders haue ordeyned to be wor shypped adoured and prayed vnto.
Briefly in all prefaces belongynge to racions deliberatiues the office of the per sone: and the necessytye or commodytye of the matter that we treate of are consydered. [leaf motif] The narracion.
IN oracio~s deliberatiues we vse very seldome narracions but for the more parte in stede of them we make a brief pro posicion co~teinyng the su~me of our etent.
As now adayes nothing is so necessary as to labour to brynge these dissencions that be in the chyrche to a perfecte vnity concorde that accordyng to Christes sayng{is} there be but one shepeherde and one tolde.
Neuertheles we vse somtyme briefe narra cons wha~ yt som thyng hath ben don all redy of yt that we giue our cou~ell vpo~ as in the abouesayd oracion yt Tult made for Po~pey where he maketh this narracion.
GReat very perillous warre is made bothe agaynst your tributours and also the~ that bothe co~federate with you: by you called your felowes whiche warre is moued by two ryght myghty kynges Withridates Tigranes. &c.
After this maner is a narracion in the oracio~ yt Haniball made to Scipio is co~teined in the x. boke of ye.
decade of Liui{us} right proper elegant without any preface begynnyng his narracion thus.
If it hath ben ordeyned by my fortune and desteny that whiche first of all ye Carthaginors began warre with the Romayns which haue almoost had the victory so often in myne ha~des shuld now com of myne owne mynde to aske peace.
am glad that fortune hathe prepared that shulde aske it of you specially.
And amonge all your noble landes this shall nat be one of the leest that Haniball gaue ouer to you to whom the goddes had gyuen afore the vyctorye ouer so many capitains of the Romayns that it was your lucke to make an ende of this warre in the which the Romayns haue had farre mo euyll chaunces tha~ we of Carthagene.
And whether it were my desteny or chau~ce yt ought me this skornfull shame.
which began the warre wha~ your father was Consull and after ioyned bataile with hym whan he was made Ca pitayne of the Romayns army must now come vnarmed to his son to aske peace of hym.
It had ben best for bothe parties yf it had pleased the goddes to haue sent our fore faders that mynde that you of Rome wolde haue ben content with the Empyre of Italy and we Carthaginoys with Affrike.
For neither Scil nor Sardinia can be any suffice~t amendes to either of vs for so many naues so many armies so many and so excellent capitaines lost in our warres betwene vs but thynges passed may soner be blamed than meuded. of Carthagene (as touchynge our parte) haue so couetyd other dominions that at lengthe we had busines ynough to defende our pos sessions.
Nor the warre hath nat ben only with you in Italy or with vs onely in Affryke: but at the pleasure of fortune somtyme here and som there in so moche that you my maisters of Rome haue sene ye sta~ derdes and armes of your enemies harde at your walles and gates of the citie.
And we on the other syde haue herde the noyse out of your campe into our citie.
After the narracion ought to folowe immediately the proposicion of our councell or aduise.
As after the narracio~ of Haniball afore reherced foloweth the proposicion of his purpose thus.
THat thynge is now entreated while fortune is fauourable vnto you that we ought moost to abhorre and you surely ought aboue all thynges to desyre that is to haue peace.
And it is most for the pro fyte of vs two whiche haue the mater in handelyng that peace be had.
And sure we be that what so euer we agree vppon our cities wyll ratifie the same.
Next foloweth the confirmacion of tho thynges yt we entende to persuade which must be set out of the places of honesty pro fite casines or difficulty.
As if we will per suade any thynge to be done we shall shew that it is nat only honest laudable: but al so profytable easy ynough to perfourme.
Or if we can nat chose but grau~t that it is harde yet we shall shew that it is so honest a dede so worthy praise besydes so great co~modity wyll come therof that the hardnes ought in no wise to fere vs: but rather be as an iustigacion to take the thynge on hande remembrynge the greke prouerbe.
Scisnoa ta nasa that is to say all excellent co~me~dable thyng; be hard of difficulty.
In honesty are co~prehe~ded all vertues as wysdo~ iustice due loue to god to our parentes liberality pity consta~ce temperance.
And therfore he that wyll for the co~ fyrmyng of his purpose declare proue yt it is honest co~mendable yt he ente~deth to persuade hym: behoueth to haue perfyte knowlege of ye natures of vertues.
And al so to haue in redy remembrau~ce sentences bothe of scripture of philosophy as oratours poetes besyde these examples of historyes for garnyssshyng of his maters.
As co~cernynge the place of vtilitie we must in all causes loke if we may haue any argume~tes wherby we may {pro}ue that our cou~cell is of suche necessity that it can nat be chosen but they must nedes folow it for tho argume~tes be of farre greater stre~gth than they yt do but onely proue the vtility of ye mater.
But if we ca~ haue no suche necessary reaso~s tha~ we must serche out argume~tes to {pro}ue our mynde to be {pro}fitable by circu~stances of the cause.
In like maner to persuade a thyng by the easines therof or dissuade it by the difficulty of the thing we must haue respect to possibility or i~possi+bilite for these {pro}ues are of strenger nature tha~ the other he yt wyll shew yt a thyng may be done easely: must presuppose ye pos+sibilite therof.
As he on the other side that wyll {per}suade a thyng nat to be done yf he shew manifest yt it is impossible argueth more stro~gely tha~ if he could but only {pro}ue difficulty in it for as sayd many thyng; of difficulty yet may be the rather to be taken on hande that they may get the~ that acheue them the greater fame and prayse.
And these argumentes be fet out of the cir cu~stances of ye cause yt is to say the time the place the doers the thynge it selfe the meanes whereby it shulde be done the cau ses wherefore it shulde be done or nat the helpes or impedime~tes that may be therin.
In this purpose examples of histories are of great efficacy.
The confutacion is the soilynge and rellyng of other me~nes sayeng{is} that haue or might be brought against our purpose wherefore it consisteth in places contrary to the places of confirmacio~ as in {pro}uyng the sayenges of the contrary part neither to be honest nor profitable nor easy to performe or els vtterly impossible.
The conclusion standeth in two thynges that is is to say a briefe and compendiouse repetyng of all our reasons that we haue bronght for vs afore and in mouyng of affections.
And so dothe Ulysses conclude his oracion in the. xiii. boke of Ouides metamorphosy.
Of the thyrde kynde of oracions called Iudiciall. [leaf motif] ORacions iudiciall be that longe to controuersies in the lawe and plees which kynde of oracion in olde tyme longed onely to Iudges men of law but now for the more parte it is neglecte of them though there be nothynge more necessarye to quicken them in crafty and wyse handelynge of theyr maters.
In these oracions the fyrste is to fynde out the state of the cause whiche is a short proposicion conteynynge the hole effect of all the controuersies.
As in the oracion of Tulli made for Milo of ye which made mencion in the begynnynge of my boke.
Milo slewe Clodius lawfully whiche thynge his aduersaries denyed and yf Tully can proue it the plee is wonne.
Here must be borne away that there be thre maner of states in suche oracions.
The thirde iudiciale and euery of these hathe his owne proper places to fet out argumentes of them wherefore they shall be spoken of seuerally.
And fyrste we wyll treate of state coiecturall whiche is vsed whan we be certayne that the dede is done but we be ignorant who dyd it and yet by certayne coniectures we haue one suspecte that of very lykelyhode it shulde be he that hathe commytted the cryme.
And therfore this state is called con iecturall bicause we haue no manifest {pro}fe but all onely great lykelyhodes or as the Rhetoriciens call them coniectures.
THere was a great contencion in the Grekes army afore Troye betwene Ulisses and Aiax after the dethe of Achilles which of them shulde haue his armour as nexte to the sayd Achilles in valiauntnes.
In whiche controuersye whan the Grekes had Iuged the sayd armour vnto Ulisses Aiax for very great disdayne fell out of his mynde shortly after in a wode nygh to the hooste after he had knowen (whan he cam agayne to hym selfe) what folyssh prankes he had played in the tyme of his phrenesy for sorow shame he slewe hym selfe.
Sone vpon this dede cam Ulisses by whiche seynge Aiax thrust thrughe with a swerde: cam to hym and as he was about to pull out the swerd the frendes of Aiax chau~ced to com the same way which seynge theyr frende deed and his olde enemy pullyng out a swerde of his body they accused hym of murder.
For of truthe Ulisses was nat gylty in the cause.
Neuer thees the enuye that was betwene Aiax and hym: made the mater to be nat a lytle suspect specially for yt he was fou~de there with the sayd Aiax alone wherefore the state of the plee was coniecturall whe ther Ulisses slew Aiax or nat.
THe preface is here euyn as it is in other oracions.
For we begyn accor dyng to the nature of the cause yt we haue on ha~de either in blamyng our aduersary or els mouynge the herers to haue pity on our client.
Or els we begyn at our owne {per}one or at the prayse of the Iuge. &c~.
THe narracio~ or tale is the shewynge of the dede in maner of an historye wherein ye accuser must craftly enterme~gle many suspicions which shall seme to make his mater {pro}uable.
As Tulli in his oracion for Milo where in his narracion he intendeth by certayn co~iectures to shew yt Clo dius laye in waite for Milo he in his sayd narracion handeleth that place thus.
In the meane season wha~ Clodius had knowlege that Milo had a lawfull neces ry iourney to the city of Lauine ye. xiii. day afore the kalendes of Marche to poynte who shuld be hed preest there which thing longed to Milo because he was dictatour of that towne: Clodius sodaynely the day afore departed out of Rome to set vppon Milo in a lordeshyp of his owne as after was well perceyued.
And suche haste he made to be goyng that were as the people were gadered ye same day for mas wherin also he had great adoo hym selfe very necessarye it had ben for hym to haue ben there yet this nat withstandyng all other thynges aparte: he went his way whiche you may be sure he wold neuer haue done saue onely that he had fully determined to preuent a tyme and place conuenient for his malicius ente~r afore Miloes comyng.
In this pece of Tullies narracion are entermengled fyrst that Clodius knew of Miloes goynge whiche maketh the mater suspecte yt Clodius went afore to mete with him for this was well knowen afore that Clodi{us} bare Milo great grudge and malice.
Next is shewed the place where as Clodius met Milo whiche also gyueth a great suspicion for it was nygh Clodius place where he myght sone take socour the tother was in leest assurau~ce.
Thyrdly that he departed out of the city what tyme it had ben most expedient ye also greatly requisite for hym to haue ben at home.
And that again maketh the mater suspect for surely he wold nat (as Tully hym selfe saieth) in no wise haue ben absent at suche a busy tyme onles it had ben for som great purpose and what other shulde it seme tha~ to ce Milo.
As surely euident it was that they buckled to gyther and this was well knowen that Milo had a necessary cause to go furth of Rome at that tyme.
Contra ryly in Clodius coulde be perceyued non other occasion to departe than oute of the citie: but of lykelyhood to lye in wayte for Milo.[leaf motif] The proposicion.
OUt of the narracion must be gaderyd a briefe sentence wherein shall stande the hole pithe of the cause for Rhetoriciens put incontinent af ter the narracion diuision which is a part of contencion dothe bryefly shew wherin the controuersy doth stande or what thinges shall be spoken of in the oracion.
Setunction is whan we shew wherein our aduersaries and we agree and what it is whereupon we stryue.
As they that pledyd Clodius cause agaynst Milo myght on this maner haue vsed setunction.
That Milo slewe Clodius: our aduersaries can nat denaye but whether he myght so do lawfully or nat is our controuersy.
Distribucion is the proposicion wherein we declare of what thynges we wyll speke of whiche yf we propose how many they be it is called enumeracion but yf we do nat expresse the nombre it is called exposicion.
Example of bothe is had in the oracion that Tully made to the people that Pompeyus myght be made chiefe capitayne of the warres agaynst Mithridates and Tigranes where after the preface and narra cion he maketh his proposicion by exposicion thus.
Fyrste thynke it expedyent to speke of the nature kynde of this warre and after that of the greatnes thereof and than to shewe how a hede or chiefe capytayne of any army shulde be chosen.
whiche last membre of his exposicion he agayne distributeth into foure partes thus as foloweth.
TRuely this is myne opinion that he whiche shall be a gouernour of an hoost ought to haue these foure propertyes in hym.
The fyrste is that he haue perfyte knowlege of all suche thynges as longeth to warre.
The seconde is that he be a man of his handes.
The thyrde that he be a man of suche auctority: that his dignity may cause his souldiers to haue hym in reuerence and awe.
The fourth is that he be fortunate and lucky in all thynges that he goeth about.
Tully in the oracion for Milo proposeth all onely shewynge wherin the contro uersy of the plee dyd stande on this maner as foloweth.[leaf motif] IS there than any thynge els yt must tryed and iudged in this cause saue this: whether of them bothe beganne the raye and entended to murder the tother No surely.
So that yf it can be founde that Milo went about to distroye Clodius than he be punysshed therefore accordyngly.
But yf it can be proued that Clodius was the begynner and layed wayte for to slee Milo and so was the sercher of his owne dethe and that what Milo dyd it was but to defende hym selfe frome the treason of his enemy and the sauegarde of his lyfe: that than he may be delyuered and quyt.
THe confirmacion of the accuser is fetched out of these places wyll and power.
For these two thynges wyll cause the persone that is accused to be greatly suspect that he had wyll to do the thyng that he is accused of and that he myght well ynoughe brynge it to passe.[leaf motif] To proue that be had wyll therto: you must go to. places.
The one is ye qualite of the persone the other is the cause that meyd him to the dede.
First to loke what is his name or surname and if it be nough ty to saye that he had it nat for nothynge: but that nature had suche pryue power in men to make them gyue names according to the maners of euery person.
So Tulli in his ora cion made for Lucius Flaceus to unproue the witnes that was brought against him by Brekes layeth vnto them the lightnes of theyr contrey.
This (sayeth Tulli) do say of the hole nacion of Brekes.
grau~t to them that they haue good lernyng and the knowlege ot many sciences.
Nor denye nat but that they haue a pleasant and marueylouse swete speche.
They are also people of high and excellent quicke wyt thereto they be very facundiouse.
These suche other qualities wherein they booste the~ selfe greatly: wyll nat repyn agai~st it that they here the maistry therein.
But as concernyng equitie and good conscie~ce requisite in berynge of recorde or gyuyng of any wytnes also as touchynge faithfulnes of worde and promyse: truely this nacion neuer obserued· this property neither they knewe nat what is the strength auctoritye and weight therof.
After that to loke on his kynred as yf his father or mother or other kynne were of yll disposicion for as the tree is: suche fruite it bereth.
On this wyse dothe Phillis cntwyte Demophon that his father Theseus vncurteysly and trayterously lefte his loue Ariadna alone in the desert yle of Naxus contrary to his promise stale from her by nyght addynge Heredem patria perfide frandis agis.
That is to saye vntrew and false forsworne man thou playest kyndely the fathers heyre in deceytable begylynge of thy true louer.
After that we must loke vppon the se whether it be man or woman that we accuse to se yf any argume~t ca~ be deduct out of it to our purpose.
As in men is noted au dacity women be comonly tymerouse.
As in Therence Simo speketh of his son Pamphilus sayeth vnto his man called Sosia how couldest thou know his condicions or nature afore whyle his age and feare and his maister dyd let it to be knowen.
am a woman a yong maiden milde gentyll both by nature yeres.
After these folow stre~gth of body or agi lity quicknes of wyt out of whiche may be broght many reaso~s to affyrme our pur pose.
So Tulli in his oracion for Milo wyllynge to proue yt Clodius was the begynner of the fraye sheweth that Milo (whiche was neuer wont but to haue men about hym) by chaunce at that tyme had in his company certayne Musiciens and maydens that wayted on his wyfe whom he had syttynge with hym in his wagen.
Contraryly Clodius that was neuer wo~t afore but to tyde in a wagen to haue his wyfe with him: at that tyme rode furth on horsebacke.
And where as afore be was alwayes accustomed to haue knaues quenes in his company: he had than non but tall men with hym (as who shulde say) men piked out for the nones.
To this is added forme as to assay yf we can haue any argument to our purpose out of the per sones face or countenance so doth Tully argue in his oracio~ agaynst Piso sayeng.
Seest thou nat now thou beest? doest yu nat now {per}ceyue what is mennes co~playnt on thy visage? there is no~ that co~plaineth that wote nat what Surrien of theyr flocke whiche be but newly crepte vp to ho nour out of the donghyll is now made con sull of the city.
For this seruile colour hath nat deceiued vs nor hery cheke balles nor rotten fylthy tethe thyne iyes thy browes forhed hole cou~tenau~ce which in a maner doth manifest me~nes co~dieto~s na ture it hath deceiued vs.
This done we must consyder how he hath be~ brought vp yt we accuse among whom he hath lyued whereby how he gouerneth his houshold assay if we ca~ pyke out of these ought for our purpose.
Also of what state he is of fre or bond riche or pore beryng office or nat a man of good name or otherwise wherin he deliteth moost which places do expresse ma~nes lyuyng by his lyuyng: his will mynde as wold declare more fully saue that in introductions men must labour to be short and agayne they are suche that he that hath any perceyuyng may sone know what shall make for his purpose how to set it furthe.
And therfore this shall suffyse as touchynge the qualitie of the person.
If we bere away this for a generall rule (that what maketh for the accuser euermore the contrary) is sure staye for the defender yf he can proue it or make it of the more lykelyhood.
As Tully in defendynge Milo layeth to Clodius frendes charges that he had non about hym but chose~ me~.
And for to clere Milo he she weth the contrary that he had with hym syngyng laddes and women seruantes that wayted on his wyfe whiche maketh it of more likelyhood yt Clodius went about to slee Milo: than Milo hym.
The cause that moueth to the mischiefe lyeth in two thynges.
Natural impulsion is angre hatred co etyse loue or suche other affections.
So Simo in Therence whan he had sayd that Dauus (who~ he had poynted to wayt vppon his sone Pamphilus) wolde do all that myght lye in hym bothe with hande and fote rather to dysplease hym: than to please Pamphilus mynde.
Simo made aunswere by raciocinacion sayenge doest thou aske that? mary his vngracious and vnhappy mynde is the cause therof.
Oenon in Ouides epistles ioyneth to gyther qualitie and naturall impulsion sayenge.
Thynke you that she that was caried awaye of a yonge man and hote in loue was restored agayn a mayde? Tulli in the oracion for Milo amonge other argume~tes bryngeth in one against Clodius by naturall impulsion of hatred she wynge that Clodius had cause to hate Milo fyrst for he was one of them that la boured for the same Tullyes reuocacyon from exyle whiche Tulli Clodius maliciously hated.
And finally bycause the sayd Milo accused hym and cast hym afore the Senate and people of Rome.[leaf motif] Raciocinacio~ is that cometh of hope of any commodity or to any discommodity.
As Tully argueth in his oracion for Milo agaynst Clodius by raciocinacion to proue that it was he that layde wayt for Milo on this maner.
IT is sufficient to proue that this cruell and wicked beest had a great cause to slee Milo yf he wolde brynge his maters that he we~t about to passe and great hope if he were ones gone nat to be letted in his pretenced malyee.
After raciocinacion foloweth comprobacion to shewe that no man els had any cause to go there about saue he whome we accuse nor no profite could com to no man thereof: saue to hym.
These are the wayes whereby an oratour shall proue that the persone accused had wyll to the thynge that is layd to his charge.
TO proue that he might do it: ye must go to the circumstance of the cause as that he had leyser ynough thereto and place conuement and strength withall.
Also you shall proue it by signes whiche are of meruaylouse efficacye in this behalfe wherefore here must be noted that sygnes be eyther wordes or dedes that either did go before or els folow the dede.
As Tully in his oracion now often alleged argueth against Clodius by signes goynge afore the dede as that Clodius sayd thre dayes afore Mi+lo was slayne: that he shulde nat lyue thre dayes to an ende.
And that he went out of the city a lytle afore Milo rode furth with a great companye of stronge and myscheuous knaues.
Signes folowynge are as yf after the dede was done he fled or els whan it was layed to his charge: he blusshed or waxed pale or stutted coulde nat well speke.
The contrary places (as sayd afore) long to the defender saue that in signes he must vse. ii. thinges absolucion inuercio~.
Absolucio~ is wherby the defendour sheweth that it is laufull for hym to do that what the aduersary bringeth in for a signe of his malice.
man is founde couerynge of a dede bo dy therupon accused of murder he may answere that it is laufull to do so for ye pre seruacion of his body from rauons other that wolde deuoure hym tyll tyme he had warued people to fetche and bury hym.
Inuereion is wherby we shew that the signe whiche is brought agaist vs: maketh for vs.
As wolde nat haue taryed to couer hym yf had done the dede my selfe: but haue fled and shronke a syde into some other way for feare of takynge.
THe co~clusion is as haue said afore in briefe repetynge of the effecte of our reasons in mouynge the Iudges to our purpose.
AS state coniectural cometh out of this questyon (who dyd the dede) so whan there is no doubt but that the dede is done and who dyd it many tymes controuersy is had whether it hath ben done laufully or nat.
And this state is negociall or iuridiciall whiche con teyneth the right or wronge of the dede.
As in the oracyon of Tully for Milo the state is iuridiciall for ope~ it was that Clo dius was slayn and that Milo slew hym but whether he kylled hym laufully or nat: is the controuersy and state of the cause, as haue afore declared.
The preamble and narracion as afore. [leaf motif] THe confirmacion hath certayn places appropred thereto but here must be marked that state negociall is double absolute assu~ptyue.
State negociall absolute is whan the thynge that is in controuersy is absolutely defended to be laufully done.
As in the oracio~ of Tulli for Milo the dede is styfly affirmed to be lawfully done in seyng Clo dius seynge that Milo dyd it in his owne defence for the law permitteth to repell violence violently.
The places of confirmacion in state ab solute are these nature law custome equi ty or reason iugeme~t necessity bargayne or couenant.
Of the whiche places Tul ly in his oracion for Milo bryngeth in the more parte to gyther in a clustr on this maner.[leaf motif] IF reason hath prescrybed this to lerned and wise men and necessity hath dryuen it into barbarous and rude folke custome kepeth it among all nacions and nature hathe planted it in bruite beestes that euery creature shuld defende hym selfe and saue his lyfe and his body from all violence by any maner of socour what meanes or way so euer it were.
you ca~ nat iuge this dede euyll done except you wyll iudge that whan men mete with theuys or murderers they must either be slayne by the wepons of suche vnthryfty and malicious persones: either els perysshe by your sentence gyuen in iugement vpon them.
State assumptiue is whan the defence is feble of it selfe but yet it may be holpeu by some other thynge added to it.
And the places longynge to this state are grauntynge of the faute remouynge of the faut or (as we say in our tongue) layeng it from vs to an other tanslatynge of the faue.
Brauntyng of the faut is whan the per son accused denteth nat the dede but yet he desyreth to be forgyuen it hath. ii. places anneryd to it purgacion deprecacio~.
Puxgacion is wha he sayeth he dyd it nat maliciously: but by ignora~ce or mishap whiche place Cato vseth ironiously in Sa lust thus.
My minde is that ye haue pyty with you for they that haue don amysse be but very yonge men and desyre of honour draue them to it.
Deprecacio~ is wha~ we haue non excuse: but we call vpon the Iustices mercy.
The handelynge whereof Tulli wryteth in his boke of inuencion thus.
HE that laboreth to be forgyue~ of his faut must reherce (yf he can) som benefytes of his done afore tyme and shew that they be farre greater in theyr nature than is the cryme that he hathe commyted so that (how be it he hath done greatly amysse) yet the goodnes of his fore merites are farre bygger and so may well oppresse this one faut.
Nexte after that it behoueth hym to haue refuge to the merytes of his elders yf there be any and to open them.
That don he must retourne to the place of purgacion and shewe that he dyd nat the dede for any hate or malyce but either by folysshnes or els by the entisement of som other or for some prouable cause.
And than promise faithfully that this faut shall teche hym to beware fro~ thens forth and also that theyr benefytes that forgyue hym shal bynde hym assuredly neuer to do so more but perpetually to abhorre any suche offence and with that to shewe some great hope ones to make them a great reco~pence pleasure therfore agayne.
After this let hym (yf he can) declare som kynred betwene the~ hym or frendshyp of his elders amplifye the greatenes of his seruice good harte towarde them yf it shall please them to forgiue this faut adde the nobility of theym that wolde fayne haue hym delyuered.
And than he shall soberly declare his owne vectucs and suche thynges as ve in hym perteynyng to honesty prayse that he may by these meanes seme rather worthy to be auauticed in honour for his good qualities than to be punished for his fall.
This done let hym reherce some other that haue be forgyuen greater fautes than this is.
It shall also greatly auayle yf he can shewe that he hathe in tyme afore ben in auctoritie and bare a rule ouer other in the whiche he was neuer but gentyll and glad to forgyue them that had offended vu derneth hym.
And than let hym crtenuate his owne faute and shew that there folowed nat so great damage therof and that but lytle profyte or honesty wyll folowe of his punysshment.
And finally than by comon places to moue the iudge to mercy pitic vpon hym.
The aduersary must (as haue shewed afore) vse for his purpose contrary places.
Some Rhetoriciens put no mo places of deprecacion than only this that is here last reherced of Tulli that is to do our best to moue the iustice to mercy and pity.
Remocion of the faute is whan we put it from vs and lay it to another.
THe Uenecians haue commaunded certayue to go in ambassade to Englande and thereuppon appointed theym what they shal haue to bere their charges whiche money assigned: they can nat get of the treasouter: At the daye appoynted they go nat whereupon they are accused to the Senate.
Here they must ley the fau from them to the treasoucer which dispatched them nat accordyng as it was ordey ned that he shulde.
Tra~slacion of the faut is whan he that co~fesseth his faut sayeth that he dyd it: mo ued by the indignacion of the maliciouse dede of an other.
Hynge Agamennon which was chief capit ayne of the Grekes at the siege of Troye whan he cam home was slayue of Egist{us} by the treason of Clitenestra his owne wyfe which murder his son Orestes seynge whan he cam to mannes state reuenged his fathers dethe on his mother slew her whereupon he was accused.
Here Orestes can nat deny but he slew his mother: But he layeth for hym that his mothers abhominable iniury co~strayned him thereto by cause she slew his father.
And this is the handelynge of confirmacion in state assumptiue.
The conclusions in these oracions are lyke to the conclusions of other.
STate legitime is whan the controuersy standeth in definicion or contrary lawes or doutfull wrytynges or raciocinacion or translacion.
DEfinicion (as Tully wryteth) is whan in any wrytynge is some worde put ye significacio~ wherof requireth exposicion.
Lawe may be made that suche as forsake a shyppe in tyme of tempest shulde lese theyr ryght yt they haue either in the shyppe or in any goodes within the same vessell that they shal haue the shy the goodes that abyde styll in her.
men to be in a lytle crayer of the whiche vessell the one man was both owner and gouernour and the other: possessour of the goodes.
And as they were in the mayne see they espied one that was swymmynge in the see and as well as he coulde holdyng vp his handes to them for socour wherupon they (beyng moued with pitie) made towarde hym toke hym vp. within a lytle after arose a greate tempest vpon them and put them in suche ieopardy that the owner of the shyp (which was also gouernour) lepte out of the shyp into the shyp bote and with the rope that tyed the bote to the shyp: he gouerned the shyp as well as he coulde.
The marchant that was within the shyp for greate dispayre of the losse of his goodes wyllyng to slee him selfe: threst hym selfe in his owne sword but as it chaunced the wounde was neyther mortall nor very greuouse but natwithsta~dyng for that tyme he was vnable to do any good in helpyng the shyp against the impetuousnes of ye storme.
The thyrd man (whiche nat longe afore had suffered shyp wracke) gate hym to the sterne and holpe the vessell the best that laye in hym.
At lengthe the storme seaced and the shyp came safe into the hauen bote all.
He yt was hurt (by helpe of chirurgiens) recoue red anon.
Now euery of these thre chale~ge the shyp good{is} as his owne.
Here euery man layeth for hym the lawe aboue reherced and all theyr controuersy lyeth in the expoundynge of thre wordes abydynge in the shyp and forsakynge the shyp what we shal in suche case call the shyp whether the bote as part of the shyp: or els the shyp it selfe alone.
Fyrst in few wordes and playne to declare the significa cion of the worde to our purpose and after suche maner as may seme resonable to the audience.
Nere after suche exposicion to declare and proue the sayd exposicion true with as many argumentes as we can.
Thyrdely to ioyne our dede with the exposicion to shew that we onely dyd obserue the very entent of the lawe.
Than to refell the exposicion of our aduersaries to shew that their exposicion is contrary to reason and equitie and that no wyse man wyll so take the law as they expounde it and that the exposicion is neither honest nor profytable and to couster theyr exposicion with oures and to shew that oures conteyneth the veritie and theyrs is falce.
And than serche out lyke examples either of greater maters or of lesse or els of egall maters and to manifest by th that our mynde is the very truthe.
Contrary lawes are where the tone semeth euidently to contrarye the other.
As yf a law were that he who~ his father hath forsaken for his so~ne shall in no wyse haue any porcion of his fathers goodes.
And an other law that who so euer in tyme of tem pest abydeth in the shyp: shall haue ye shyp and goodes.
Than pose that one whiche was of his father so abiecte and deuyed for his chylde: was in a shyp of his fathers in tyme of sore wether whan all other for feareof lesynge them selfe forsoke the shyp gate them into the bote: he onely abodc and by chaunce was safe brought into the hauen wherupon he chalengeth the vessell for his where as the party defendant wyll lay against hym that he is abdicate or forsaken of his father and so can nat by the law haue any parte of his goodes.
Here must he say agayn for hym that this law alleged doth all only priuate fro~ theyr fathers goodes suche as be abdicate yet wolde chalenge a part as his children but yt he doth nat so but requireth to haue the shyp nat as a son to his father: but as any other straunger myght seyng the law gyueth him the shyp yt abideth in her in time of necessity.
And so the handelynge of this state either to deny one of yt lawes shew that it hath ben afore anulled or els to expounde it after the sence that is mete to our purpose.
Doubtfull writynge is where either the mynde of the author semeth to be contrary to that that is wryten which som call wry tynge sentence or els it is whan the wor des may be expounded dyuers wayes.
MEn say it is a law in Caleys that no straunger may go vppon the towne walles on payne of dethe.
Now than pose that in tyme of warre the towne beynge harde besieged an alien dwellynge in the towne getteth hym to the walles amonge the soudiers doeth more good than any one man agayn.
Now after the siege ended he is accused for transgressyng of the law which in wordes is euidently against him.
But here the defendaunt must declare the wryters mynde by circumstaunces what straunger he dyd forbyd and what tyme· and after what maner and in what intent he wolde nat haue any straunger to come on the walles in what intent his mynde might be vnderstanden to suffre an alien to go vpon the walles.
And here must the effect of the strau~gers wyll be declared that he went vp to defend ye towne to put back their enemies.
And therto he must say that the maker was nat so vndiscrete vnreaso nable that he wolde haue no maner of excepcion which shuld be to the welth {pro}fite or preseruacion of the towne.
For he that wyll nat haue ye law to be vnderstande~ ac cordyng to equitie good maner nature entendeth to proue the maker therof either an vniust man or folyssh or enuiouse.
The accuser contraryly shall praise the maker of the law for his great wisdom for his playne writyng without any maner of ambiguity yt no strau~ger shulde p~sume to go vpon the walles reherce ye law word for worde tha~ shew som reasonable cause that mouyd the maker of the law that he wolde vtterly that no straunger shulde ascende the walles. &c. Era~ple of the seco~d.
Man in his testame~t gyueth to two yonge doughters that he hathe two hu~dred shepe to be delyuered at the day of theyr maryage on this maner.
wyll that myne executoures shall gyue to my doughters at the tyme of theyr maryage euery of theym an hundred shepe suche as they wyll.
At the tyme of maryage they de maunde theyr cattell whiche the executours deliuer nat of suche sort as the mayde~s wold ·wherupo~ the co~trouersy ariseth.
For the executours say they are bounde to delyuer to euery of them an hundred shepe suche as they that be the executours will.
Now vere standeth the dout to whom we shall referre this worde they to the doughters or to the executours.
The maydens say nay thereto but that it was theyr fathers mynde that they shulde haue euery of theym an.
C. shepe suche as they that be the doughters wyll.
The handelyng of doutfull wrytyng is to shew yf it be possible that it is nat wryte~ doutfully by cause it is the comon maner to take it after as we saye that it may sone be knowen by suche wordes as partely go before that clause {per}tly folow that there be few wordes but if they be considered so alone they may anon be taken doubtfully.
And first we shal shew if we can yt it is nat doubtfully wryten for there is no reasona ble ma~: but be wyll take it as we say.
Tha~ shal we declare by that that goeth afore foloweth that it is clerly eum as we say that yf we consider the wordes of the~ selfe they wyll seme to be of ambiguity but seynge they may by the rest of the wrytynge be euident ynough they ought nat to be ta ken as doubtfull.

Take here of our gracious lorde god this lytle treatice that here is offred called the Lanterne of lyght conteynynge. xiij. chapyters.
GOd that is good hym selfe fayre in his Angels mer+uelous in his sainctes merciful apon synners haue mercy on vs nowe and euer and gyue vs grace to holde ye way of trought in these dayes of great tribulacyon for now many that semed to be stable in vertue fallen from theyr holy purpose dreding losse bodely paine:
as Chryst sayd That thabu~dau~ce of wyckednes shall coole the charite of many for Sathan hath nowe destroyed thys worlde by hys leuetenaunt Antechryst that men be borne aboute in diuers doubtes as waues of the see wredchy+dly diuided in diuers opinions one agaynst another.
But seynt Paule dyd sette one accorde amonge the chisten people saynge ther is but one Lorde that all men shulde loue and dred one faythe that all men shulde kepe and byleue with out varyenge
and one Baptyme that all men shuld haue stedfastly holde without defouling.
Alas howe is this vnyte broken that men vnruled walken after their lustes as bestes in ye corne: truly the wycked man that Christ spake of hath
done thys dede for he hath sowen faves cokle vpon the sede of god.
Thys wycked enemye is Antechriste that cloutyth hys lawes as rotten Ragges to the clene cloth of Christes gospell.
And waketh in malice as Iudas chylde why for Simon slepith and taketh non hede.
thou wycked man is there any othere man that may saue soulles than Iesu Chryst god said by the mouthe of Moyses shall smyte and shall hele and there is none that can delyuer or rydde from my hande
who hathe the keyes of Dauid to open heuen gates and none othere closyth to close and then none othere openeth sayncte Iohn sayeth holy and true Christe hath the keye of Dauid that openeth whiche castith downe and than no man reyseth who reyseth and than no man castyth downe.
Iob sayeth whan the Lorde god hathe dystroyed there may none other buylde
when the Lord god castyth in pryson ther may none other delyuer or quyte hym of his bondes.
And therfore in the vertue of this name Iesu sta~deth al ma~nes saluation as it is wrytten in thactes of thaposteles.
There is none othere name vnder heuen geuen but thys name Iesu whereof we may saued be for alonely in the vertue of thys name Iesu is the remyssyon of synnes as it is wrytten Luce .xxiiij.
It behoued to be prechyd amonge the people penaunce remission of synnes in the name of Iesu art thou nat then a wycked man a a cruell beste the son of perdicion And Antechrist hym
selfe that pretendest in the in thy me~bers to blesse to cursse to bynde to vnbynde besydes this name Iesu people wtout no~bre folowynge the thy deuyded lawes ben deuided fro~ Christe Ihu~ and go with the blyndefolde into hell for euermore and thys is great sorowe so ferforth that Chryst maketh lame~tacyon and mournyng ther vpon saynge Iohi~s. v.
haue come in the name of my father and ye haue not taken me when another shall come in hys owne name him shall ye take and thys is Antechryste.
And seyncte Iohn~ Crisostome vpon these wordes of the gospel Mathei. xxj.
For who that wyll not receyue Christ in payne of synne he is co~pelled constrayned to receyue Antechrist and ther+fore in this tyme of tribulacion hydeous darke+nes let vs seke the Lanterne of lyght wherof the prophet spekith.
for as fer as ye light of this La~+terne shyneth so far darknes of syn cloudes of te~ptacyon of the fende vanyssheth away may not abyde.
And euermore when thys Lanterne lighteneth into an herte it purgyth it cle~sith it fro~ corrupcion it swagyth healyth gostely sores as the wysema~ sayth that nether herbe nor plaster hathe heled them but Lorde thy myghty worde that heleth al thynges.
For truly Lord whe~ thou dyed apon ye crosse thou dydest put in thy worde the spryt of lyfe
gauest to it power of quickenyng by thyne owne precious bloud as thou said thy self.
The wordes that spake to you bene spryte and lyfe. &c.
DEre Brother in Christ helpe me with your prayer to almighty god: for seinct Iames saith The busy praier of a right wyse man is moche worthe.
Ye haue desyered me to take thys trauayle apon me whiche is full chargeous to me but as towarde our swete Lorde god nothynge is impossyble as Chryste sayde and in thys fayth.
The Lorde god hym selfe wyrcheth all our workes in vs fayle we not then god in good leui~g.
And he may not faile to geue vs suche wysdom as is nedefull to vs to tempre our tonge gyue vs true organ redy speche in edefyeng of our neyghbour for without the helpe of ye spirite of god our labour were but lost as Christ said yt it was not we yt coulde~ speke profitably but the spirite of the fa+ther yt speketh in vs for thapostels other holy me~
that trauayled in dedly letters meked the~ selfes as simple ydiottes: as Hierom sayd that prechers vnlerned bene sent for to preche yt the faith of the true beleuers shuld be trowed to be brought in (not by ma~nes vertue) but by ye spech doctrine of god.
what suffren we what here we vnlerned me~ arisen catche heue~.
Ryght as trough incarnate that is Christ in manhede chosith simple poore ydiottes to hys prechynge so agaynwarde Antechriste is for to chase stourdy and doble men hauynge the wysdom of thys worlde for to preche his falsehede.
Haue we then ful faythe in our lorde Iesu with perfyte lyuynge and this Lorde throughe your prayer shal lead this warke after his owne pleasure and brynge it to a perfyte ende to hys honour and glory and to profyte edificacyon of his faythefull seruauntes.
TO speake generally yf ye demaunde me who is Antechrist aunswere and say that he (whose lyfe and doctryne is contrary to Christes:
is an Antechrist as seyncte Iohn~ said forsothe nowe bene many Antecristes.
And ther+fore sayth seynct Austen. who that lyueth contrary to Chryst) is an Antechrist be thou with+in or be thou without be thou high or be thou lowe be thou spu~all (as they call it) or be thou temporal be thou riche or poore Pope or page or of any degree thou canst rekene yf thou lyue contrary to Christ thou art but chafe wherof Christe speketh sayeng that the chafe shal brine with fyer that may not be quenched.
soull that is but chafe shall euer suffre and neuer bye as ye prophete sayth.
Ysa. ix. Euery proude soule that ryseth in swellynge agaynst god
and euery body defouled in Glottony Lechery shal be into swellynge mete of the fyre that shall euer brenne him with most greuous payne.
Six synnes there be agaynst the holy goste that toke the wretched soull in to thys chafe but for asmoche as no daunger is feared but it be fyrste knowen therfore we shall name them vn+to you in thys lytle treatice for the lernynge of the small vnderstanders.
The fyrste is presumpcyon yt is the bolnynge or swellynge of a proude spirite without dred of godes ryghtwysnes and of thys synne all maner of malyce and wretchydnes taketh rote that reygneth in mankynde amonge lerned and leude
for the wyseman sayth that he that dredeth not can not be iustyfyed or made ryght+wyse.
For sothe saye in whome thys synne of presumption hath no lordeshyp in hym the deuyll is ouercome for he that dredeth the lorde shall do good thynges and agayne but yf thou holde thy selfe continually in the drede of god thy house shalbe sone tourned vpsydowne
that is thy body and soull shalbe tourned from god into the deuelles seruyce.
The seconde syn is Dysperacyon or wanhope that is ouer lytle trust of godes mercy.
Seynct Austyne saythe that the drede of godes ryghtwysnes and hope of hys mercy bene .ij. yates of lyfe for by them we entren here into grace
Our Lorde is wel pleased apon them that drede hym that trust in his mercy and againwarde presumpcion disperacion bene .ij. yates of deth by the which me entren into sinne inco~brance after into payne of hel.
My litle so~nes these thynges wryte to you that ye synne not in the synne of dyspayre but yf it so be that any of you haue synned we haue an aduocate agaynste the father Iesu Chryste our iust Lorde and he is the purchaser of mercy for our synnes not only for ours but for the synnes of all the worlde.
Iesu is for to say a sauyour for he hathe plenty of medecyne to saue al mankynde yf they wyll take thys medecyne and be saufe.
For seyncte Gregory saythe He sleyth him selfe that wyll not kepe the byddynges of hys leche.
The thyrde syn is Obstinacy or hardnes of hert that wyl not be contrite for co~punction nor softe with pyte nor moued with prayer nor feared wt thretteni~ges it settith not by betinges but vnkynde agaynste all the workes of God vnfaythefull in councell ferse and woode in Iugement vnshamefast in synne hardy in peryll a Cowarde in manhode folehardy agaynste god forgetfull of tyme paste neclygente in tyme presente and inprouydente for the tyme to come and shortely to saye
thys is the synne that neyther dredyth god ne shameth man for thys synne one Lynconln~ teacheth a medecyne
sayenge that an harde hert wolde be brayed in a morter of stone with an heuy pestle: thys morter is the bodye of Chryste penetrate and wounded in hys passyon the pestle is the drede of dampnacyon that foloweth after the synne.
thou harde harted wretche nygh+the to the bodye of Chryste and for drede of dampnacyon confyrme the to hys passyon. &c.
The .iiij. synne is fynall Impenitence that is he that wyll neuer be penitent or sorowfull for hys synne but contynually leadeth hys lyfe after the lustes of hys fleshe ouercommen with the deuell the worlde and the fleshe for no man dothe very penaunce to god but he that fully leuyth that syn for the whiche he suffreth penaunce thus sayth Sayncte Austyn but for they holden moche worshyp to blase theyr name in erth they maken a fayned shryfte to a pryste taken parte of sacramentes they buylde churches with other ornamentes and fynde prystes to rede and synge they releuen the poore nedy
and amenden places that be peryllous but euer more they lye harde tongeled as froste in olde custome and synne.
To these vnrepenta~t or impenitent persones speketh Gregory most sharpely in hys Pastoralles vpon Mathewe whether is not the lyfe more then mete and the body more than cloth here thys doctour sayth.
He yt geueth mete or clothe to the poore nedy and is polluted or defouled in wyckednes of bodye and soule the thynge that is moste he geueth to synne and the thynge that is lefte
he geueth to ryghtwysnes hys goodes he geueth to god but hym selfe to the deuel for he settyth more pryce by worldly rychesse then he dothe by bodye and soull and loueth moste that god loueth leste wherfore he is tourned to hate: god hathe gyuen vnto man .v. precyous gyftes the leste of them is wordly goodes better then these is mannes bodye that god hathe endowed with kyndely strength and graunted hym reason to vse thys worlde hym selfe to chastyce clothe or fede aboue these twayne is mannes soull that berythe godes image and hys lykenes.
Lorde what proffyt were it to wyn thys worlde and brynge thy soull vnto dampnacyon and the body is a lothesume careyn when the soule is departed therfrom.
But godes grace passeth these .iij. for where hys grace fayleth no wysdome auayleth.
Loke well that these thynges be not myspente nether worke thou any of them besydes theyr ordre but that the streynght all to one ende to wyn vnto the promyse and gyfte of god that is the blesse perdurable.
whether dyspisest thou the ryches of the goodnes of god and patience and longe abydyng of thy god.
Knowest thou nat that the good+nes of god ledyth the or dryuith the to penaunce truly after thyne hardnes and thyne vnrepentaunt herte thou treasourest to the wrathe in the daye of wrathe and reuelacyon of the ryght+wyse iugement of god that shall yelde to eche
The .v. synne is Enuy agaynste thy brothers grace as when thy neyghbour is wyse well gouerned praysed or borne vp ryche welthy stronge fayre or vertuous in great abundaunce of grace then thys enuyous man sklaundreth vpbreydeth repreueth dispyseth hatith hin+dreth scorneth pursueth to defoule his brothers grace
man walkynge in the hygh waye and dredynge the Lorde is dyspysed of hym that walketh in the wronge way whan Iesu Christ had cast out a deuel from a man that was dombe as it is wrytten in the gospeles of.
Luce. xj. Anone thys man began to speke to puplysshe thys myracle amonge the people.
Than the Scrybes and Pharysees enuyous sectes that were a false religyon sclaundred Chryste saynge that he dyd thys myracle in Belzebub prynce of deuelles.
Belzabub is to say a god of Flyes or elles a god that maketh dyscorde.
Lorde sythen they durst saye thys of Chryste hed of al mannes soull howe moche warse (yf warse may be) shall they auenture to saye of hys poore seruauntes prechers the truth of hys lawe but Prelates and Fryers in these dayes ben accombred with thys synne agaynste the holy goste and shamefully sclaundren her symple brether ye trauaylen through Christes holy lawe to cast yuel maners from theyr soules prechynge the gospell to Chrystes intente to tourne the people to vertuous lyuyng they say
Thys man hathe eaten a flye that geueth hym lore of godes lawe thys is more foly to eate a flye then be a god and chase these flyes thus haue they brought theyr malice aboute to sclau~+der for heretyckes that speke of god so dryue they the people from ye fayth that they dare not wyrche ne speke for sclaundre.
But truly they be not wordye Chryste that feare barkynges of these houndes for none is worthy to be with his Lorde that shameth his seruyce in well or in woo and suche men shewe them selfes traytours to god that with theyr deuelysshe la~gage defamen theyr brethern and sayenge that the fende may and wyll make wyse hys members that serue hym in synne but so wyll not Christ hys beloued seruauntes that lyuen in clennes to serue hym in vertue.
praye the who harde euer a fouler blasphemy certaynly thys dyspyte stretched into the godhede to be ponysshed in the daye of iugemente for goddes lawe teachethe forbede hym not that can doo well but yf thou mayst doo well doo it.
The preste shulde not be letted to preache the truth neyther the people to speke of theyr beleue as it is taught in the booke of Numeri. vi.
where it is wrytten that Heldad and Medad prophesyed al be it that they were not lycenced by Moyses.
Iosue the Duke and minister of Moyses grutched agaynst these men and complayned on them to Moyses.
And Moyses sayde to Io+sue. why arte thou so enuyous towardes me who may lete or withdrawe that all the people
This maner of doynge is also confyrmed in the gospel of our lorde Iesu Chryste.
Master we haue seen a man castynge out deuelles in thy name that foloweth not vs and we haue forbydden hym.
Alas se then howe dare our bysshhopes for shame offende agaynste these both godes lawes and doke theyr prestes on euery syde geuynge them charge on payne to do pryue the~ theyr offyce yt they preach not the treuth.
And Seyncte Ierom co~mendyth in prestehode prechynge the gospel blessyng the people before the sayeng of masse.
And Seynct Paull sayth that Christ sent hym to preche not to baptyse.
So by this it apereth that prechynge the gospel is the hyghest feruyce that may be done to god.
But here the enemyes of trouth obiecten and leyen for the~ this text of Seynct Paule.
How shall they preche but yf they bene sente with thys texte they blynden moche people cuttynge the sentens frome the wordes.
For they be sente bothe of god and of the bysshopes for to do that offyce as the Mayster of the sentence sayeth in hys .iiij. boke and the .iiij. and .x. Distinctyon.
It is thoffyce of a deken to preche the gospell then by the more stronger reason it apperteineth to a preste.
For Seincte Ierom and Seyncte Bede accorden together sayenge. ryght as thapposteles is the forme of bysshops
But Chryste gaue charge bothe to these bysshopes and also to these prestes sayenge.
And Christe Iesu assygnynge .lxxij. dysciples sent em to preche.
Howe shall these bysshopes maynteyne these constitucyons agaynste god and holy saynctes.
It shalbe more sufferable to Sodom and Go~mer than to thys people that thus dyscorden godes ordenaunces.
The syxt synne is fyghtynge agaynste treuth that man knowith that is as when trouthe is tolde to the gyltye that is not dysposed to be amended then he maketh blynde and vngrounded reasons with sutle sophisticall damnynge the truth agaynst hys owne conscyens with a bolde face hauynge no shame as the prophete Ieremie sayth.
The face of an harlot is made vnto the and thou woldest not be asshamed.
But as Paule sayth Ryght as Iambnes Me~bres agaynste standen Moses in the syght of Pharao so these agayne standen treuthe as men corrupte in theyr owne concyens.
And yf thou wyll knowe what these me~ be aske of.
Seynct Peter and he wyll tell the for he clepethe them by theyr names in hys epystle where he sayeth that they bene mayster lyers that shall brynge in amonge the people sectes of perdicyon that is of losse and deth though ye rysen with Lucyfer and maken your nestes amonge the sterres.

Take to the the vesselles of a folysshe sheparde for lo shall suffre Antechriste to be reysed by in erthe the whiche shall not visite them that be forsaken nor seke them that be scatred nor hele them that be seke.
thou folysshe pastor Antechryste Antechryste god saythe thou arte an ydoll hauynge a bysshops habyte.
But neyther vertue spirite lyfe ne dede that longyth to a bysshop.
For Paule sayth that he whiche hathe not the spirite of Chryste he is not his ser+uaunte al be it that he haue ye outwarde tokens And therfore sayth seynct Iohn~ the .v.
angell powred his crwette vpon the sete of the beste and his realme is made darke and they byten theyr tonges to gether for sorowe and they blasphemyd god of heuen for ther sorowes and theyr woundes and they dyd no penaunce for theyr dedes that is to meane Archebysshopes and Bysshopes bene the sete of the beste Antechrist for in them he sytteth reygneth ouer other people in the darkenes of his heresye and in thys they delyten them magnifyenge with theyr tonges ther false ordenau~ces the which is sorowe to them that bene of true vnderstandyng and thus they put abake godes lawe for prechyng of Christes gospell yt which bene sorowes to them gendrynge synnes in theyr soules that
And beyng thus wounded shall neuer do medefull penaunce of dedes for the whiche they shalbe dampned.
quake hugely am aferde: but dare not be styl left peraduenture the sentens fal on me that the {pro}phete sayeth. wo to me:
The well the begynnynge and the cause of all ruine and myschyefe is the courte of Rome.
Nowe by thauctoryte of god one accorde of holy saynctes shewyth an open conclusion sadly grou~ded in true beleue that in the courte of Rome is the heed of Antechryst and in archebysshopes and bysshopes is the body of Antechrist but in these patched and clou+ted sectes as Monkes Chanons and Freers is the venemous tayle of Antechriste these .iij. partyes be verefyed of thapostle Iude sayng. wo to the~ that walketh in the way of Cayne (these bene false possessioners) And wo to them that bene shade out for mede in the errour of Balam: these bene myghty nedlesse beggers and wo to them that haue perysshed in the contradiccyon of Chore.
Howe this Antechrist shalbe distroyed god hym self teacheth by the prophete Danyel:
sayenge that thys Antechrist shalbe dystroyed without hande that is without the power of man.
Christ shall sle Antechryst with the spiryte of hys mouthe (that is with the holy worde of his lawe) and the lorde shall dystroye hym with the shynynge of his comyng that is with tournyng of mennes hertes
by grace to his lawe a litle before his danie· But god taught more playnly this lord to Iob. Lo (sayeth god) the hope that Antechryst hathe in riches and in worldly fauour shall brynge hym to nought and all men saynge he shalbe throwen downe hedlyng.
So that all the people shall make waylynges vpon him with greate lamentacyon cursynge waryenge dampnyng him with al his false ordenaunces &c.
Capi. v. BVt nowe at the laste we shall brynge to mynde holy Dauid the kynge that had geue~ to him the full spirit of prophecye and he seynge the co~mynge of Antechrist his lyuynge and his fall marketh .v. hydeous assaultes that he shall haunte agaynst the seruauntes of god Psal.
The first assaulte of Antechrist is his constitucions as the prophete sayth.
Lord suffre thou to ordeyne a law maker vpon ye people in payne of theyr synnes for that they consent not to the trought that is thus to meane Antechryste vsith falce lucratyfe or wynnyge lawes as ben absolucions indulgenses pardones priuileges
all other heuenly treasure that is brought into safe to spoyle ye people of their wordly goodes and pryncipally these newe constitucions by whose auctorytie Antechryste interditeth churches someneth prechers suspendith receyuers: priueth them theyr benefice cursyth herers and taketh away the goodes of them that furtheren the prechynge of the trought ye thoughe it were an angell of heuen.
But yf the prest shew the marke of the beste that they haue properly tourned into a newe name callynge hit a speciall lettre of lycence for the more blyndynge of the people.
Antechryste vexeth the people ouermyghtely in huntynge the people on mawmetry and doynge of Idolatry but euer Antechryst maketh the~ to wene that they gone on pylgremage.
And therfore he is warned of god by the prophete sayenge.
wo to you that sayen good is yll and yll is good puttynge lyght into darkenesse and darkenesse into lyght.
And thus dothe Antechryste whan he translateth vertues into vices and vices into vertues as pylgremage in+to outrage and outrage into pylgremage and for this wawarde intent god despyseth Antechrist with all blyndefelde people and lateth al theyr myspended goodes in theyr most tribulacion.
The .iij. assaulte of Antechrist is inquificio~ as ye prophete sayth that Antechrist enquyreth secheth and harkeneth where he maye fynde
any man or woman that wryteth lerneth redith or studyeth goddes lawe in theyr mother tonge: to leade theyr lyues after the pleasynge wyll of god.
Anon he catcheth them in hys sensures and after smyteth as he may moste hurte them but he shall not make thys inquisicion after the multitude or greatnesse of hys wrathe.
For god shall refrayne or abrydge the power of his malice so that he shall nomore do than god wyll suffre him yt knoweth the mesour of his dedes to proue his seruauntes by the fornays of penau~ce acceptable.
And Antechryst with these me~ thus herted in malice inexcusable.
The .iiij. assaulte of Antechrist is persecucyon as the prophete sayeth.
That Antechrist sittyth in the ease of thys worlde with ryche men in theyr dennes.
But the poore meke symple and lowly them he espyeth and pursueth he ouerlepeth and ouerronneth rauesshynge them bothe bodely and gostely.
For god sayth vnto Iob that hath a truste and a trowynge that Iordan may flowe into his mouthe.
And therfore he ma+keth hys dwellynge place in the herte of the see as our Lorde sayeth by hys prophete
that Antechryste maketh hys boste and sayeth by hys prophete.
haue sytten in the chayre of god in the hert of the see whan thou arte but man no god.
But euer in fatte countres walowynge ha+bundyng of worldly goodes there is Antechrist with his clerkes buyldyng theyr nestes.
And yf thou loke witterly aboute thou shalt fynde the~ amonge woodes and waters as seyncte Iohan
sayth yt he sawe out of the mouth of the dragon that is the heed of Antechryst
out of the mouth of the beste that is the body of Antechrist and out of the mouth of the false prophete that is ye tayle of Antechryst.
Thre vnclene spirytes to haue passed out in the maner of frogges syttynge in holes by the water brynke purchasen of the grounde aboue on the erthe besyde them but that that is vnderneth them they woll not her thankes neyther lose ne lese it.
iij. vnclene spirites crokyng in Couetyse Glotony and Lechery betoken Antechryste with hys .iij. partes for they purchasen of lordes that bene aboue them moch parte of theyr good with the tonge of flattry and fayned Ipocresy and of the commoners aboute them they wylen in theyr handes moche parte of theyr catayle but that they haue wonne they holden faste agayne thauctoryte of goddes lawes.
And with these rycheses they noryshen wylde stourdy lawles men that pursuen them that woll ought say agaynste this cursyd synne.
But in thys persecutyon the prophete comforteth the seruauntes of god sayenge.
God is our refuge and our vertue god is our helpe in trybulacions the whiche haue ouer moche or passyngly founden vs wherfore we shall not drede whylles that men lyuynge after thys worlde bene troubled and hylles shullen be borne ouer into the herte of the see yt is to say.
True men shall not be abasshed though proude flesshly men be comforted to An+techriste and helpen him in hys persecutyon.
as the prophete sayth. whan Antechryst saith that he auayleth not in these forsayde tourmentes than he executyth hys malyce agaynste Christes chosen as saynct Iohn~ sayth.
That the beste of the erthe shall geue power to the beste of the see for in this tyme of execucyon.
The vicious parte of the lay se from the highest degree to the lowest shall consent to execute the wyckednes of the vicious parte of the clergy.
They shal shede out innocent bloude and no man shall dare bury theyr bones for they shall caste theyr fleshe to fowles of the ayer and theyr careyns to bestes of the erthe.
Than sayth the prophete that whan Antechryste weneth he hath lordeshyp ouer al the seruau~tes of god reysynge vpon them guiues of diuerse tormetry then shal he fal to open repreue for euer more The full tyme of Antechriste dureth .iii. yeres and an halfe but that the gospell doth remytte and elles shulde nat all fleshe be made saue thys tyme was fygured vnder Ely the prophete.
there shewyth the story that the raine was stopped .iij. yeres and .vj. monethes seynct Iames bereth wytnes of this thinge in his canon epystle.
The flyenge of Da+uyd from kynge Saule marketh this tyme who so taketh hede and rede that boke to ye last ende.
Also the lesynge of Hierusalem dyscloseth thys tyme as Iosephus telleth.
nombre also i~ time and tymes and halfe a time and this is .iij. yeres and demy as saynt Hierom declareth in his boke seyntes of the myghtye Macabeus vnder thys tyme made clene theyr Temple wherfore saynte Iohan in his Apocalipse often times reherseth thys nombre whan he speketh of Antechryste.
And Chryste kepeth thys nombre for the tyme of his prechynge out take that leste by vertue of hys passyon sayncte Iohn~ Crysostom vpon Mathewe ca.
saythe by thre yeres and .vj. monethes the sacryfyce of goddes praysynge that shulde be in mannes mouthe the sacryfyce of ryghtwysnesse that shulde be in mannes workes and the sacrafyce of peace that shulde be in tretynge of Chrystes body shalbe taken awaye from all faythfull through stronge woodnesse of Antechryste then shall all true chrystiane fle the face of Antechryste so that none shall nowe entre into the churche to doo due seruyce to theyr god after thys the people shall tourne with all theyr myght bothe chrystiane and Iewes to the kepynge of goddes lawe and doynge of vertuous penaunce as Paule wytnessynge sayth.
Blyndnes fell by parte in Israell vnto the tyme that plentye of hethen gentles shulde entre into chrystendom.
And then in thende of the worlde that is after the destruccyon of Antechryste al Israell shalbe made saue.
No man loke after Enoke and Ely in persone for than they maye lyghtelye
be begyled but in spyrite and in vertue nowe they be come: to make mennes hertes redy afore christes home to whome be glory nowe and euer.
¶What is the churche only appro+pried to god with theyr names lykenesis and condicions.
TO spek of holy church Fyrst we take grounde of the gospel where Chryste sayeth.
That ye gattes of hel shal not preuayle nor haue myght agaynst holy church vpon this texte Lyre sayeth.
That the church is not in me~ by way of power or dignite spirituall or temporall for many Princes and high Bysshopes other of lower degree: state and dignite are founden to be apostates or haue gone backe from the fayth wherfore the churche standeth in those persons in whome is knowynge and very confessyon of fayth and trouth.
But for the more clere declarynge of this matter and auoydynge of obiections that may be put forth we shall vnderstande yt ther bene .iii. churchis of the which goddes lawe ofte maketh mencyon:

The fyrst churche is called a lytle flocke as Chryste sayeth.
Drede ye not my lytle flocke hit pleaseth your father to gyue you a kyngdome and thys churche is cleped the chosen nombre of them: that shalbe be saued as it is wrytten that the sonnes of wysdome bene the churche of ryghtwysemen
and the nacion of them is buxoume to god and louyng to hys euen christen.
This church is called a clene mayden as Paule sayth.
Chryste hath chosen hym a glorious churche hauynge neyther spot nor wemme or any suche other
but that thys churche may be holy and vndefouled to thys accordeth Lyncoln~ sayenge that holy churche of god is a chaste virgin christes glorious spouse without spot or bleyne.
The .iij. tyme thys churche is called chrystes spouse of thys mariage Paule beryth wytnes saynge.
haue maryed you to one man: that is not to an auoutrer
but to a laufull man Christ Iesu that may present you to god a clene chaste mayde at the day of dome and thus we say in the dedycacyon of the materiall churche.
Thys day holy churche a glorious spouse is maryed to Chryst her souerayne.
This churche is lykened to a woman with chylde as Chryste sayeth.
Thys churche is lykened to a woman clade in the sonne as sayncte Iohn~ in Thapocalips sayeth sawe a wounderfull syght and that was a woman clade in the sonne Thys churche is also lykened to Peters lytle

The trees that beren fruyte bene good lyuers here in erthe.
The fruytes of these trees bene good workes of saynctes the tree of lyfe is the sayncte passynge all saynctes our lorde Iesu Chryste.

Thys is holye churche onely propred to god that serueth hym in vertue nyght and daye but howe euer we speken in dyuers maners or lykenesse of thys holye churche they teachen not elles but this one name that is to saye the congregacyon or gadrynge to gether of faythefull soules that euer more kepen faythe and trought in worde and dede to god and man and reysen theyr lyfe

And to thys entente Cryste lykened mannes soule to a woman with chylde for in her trauayle she hathe stronge paynes but whan she hathe borne the chylde into thys worlde she hathe no mynde of her payne for Ioye of the chylde.

These be ye gronynges of mannes soull that longeth in harte after Chryste her spouse tyll she haue brought forthe her selfe a chyld of god into blysse perdurable than for ye greatnes of godes rewarde ye more she suffred ye more is her Ioye for so sayth seynct Paul yt the passions of this time bene as no paynes in re+garde to ye glory yt is to come yt shalbe shewed in vs for tha~ we shalbe endowed with .iiij. dowe+ryes in our bodyes.
Of the which seynct Paull spekyth sayenge that the body that is sowen in corrupcyon shall ryse without corrupcion in this church of god at ye day of dome.
And this dowre is cleped immortalite or vndedlynes yt body that is sowen vnworthy shall ryse in glory: and this dowry is called clerenes that body that is sowen in infyrmyte or instablenes shall ryse in vertue thys dowry is called Agilite or swyftenes.
That body that is sowen bestiall shall ryse spirituall and this dowry is called subtylite.
But there bene other foure dowryes of substanciall medes with the which we shalbe
The first dowry is called im+possibilite the seconde is tuicion the .iij. perpetuall charyte the .iiij. is fruytion.
Or after this maner to speke more playnly: the first is knowlege without errour the seconde is mynd without forgettynge the thyrde is wel without co~tradiccyon: and the .iiij. is thus of the godhede and loue of god euerlastynge.
what a woundrefull ioye is thys where the soul shalbe fedde wt the syght of the godhed: certes this is ioye without wrechydnes rest without busynes mirthe without heuynes surety endeles of al discorde lotheles.
This wytnessith the pro+phet Ysaye seynct Paule in his epistle sayth yt bodely yie hath not sene ne eare hath herde ne hert of man thought: what thynges they be that god hathe ordeyned or prepared to them yt loue him.

Euangelistes ben there hygh in blysse yt walken with Christ and wryt his wordes.
Apostelles sent into all the worlde and Christes discyples to preche the gospell turnyng Iewes hethen me to Christes lawe there they sitten on seetes vpon .xij. trones and shallinge with Chryste in the dome the xij. tribz of Israel Math.
There ben marters that shede there bloude suffered paynes to enlarge theyr ioye and for they passed by fyre water they haue founde refresshynge to theyr soules also ther be co~fessours yt opened christes lawe to thys worlde and neyther for felony ne for shame wolde neuer deny that blissyd lord ther ben virgins in body and soull that kept the~ in clennes from luste of fleshe.

But thus we seien to amende our deuotion that we myght haue that blysse in mynde take a parte among these saynctes.
But saynct Iohan when he was ledde in spirite sawe in heuen a wonderfull syght and for to chere mankynde in erthe he left it wrytten in his boke that is to say.
Sainct Iohan sawe a woman clade in the sonne and mone vnder her fete and a crowne vpon her hed of the .xij. sterres this woman betokeneth mannes soull as we toke wytnes of Christ before and certayne thys was a blyssedfull syght to se the church in her weddynge clothes the sonne
that thys churche is cladde in is that moste worshypfull garnement our saluacyon that excellent and moste commendable lyuerey our redempcyon that holy and moste precious cloth our chrystendome and our relygion for thys Chryste betoke vs when we were baptized as Paule sayeth.
All ye that be baptyzed ye be clade Chryste Iesu the son beryth lyghtnesse of our baptym for certayne propertyes that it hath of the sonne other lyghtes borowe there shyni~g bothe mone sterres in theyr due course and elles they ben ouerleade with darkenes that may not comforte to nyght ne day.
So all mannes warke in worde and dede borowith there lyght at Chryste.
Iesu for he is the sonne of ryghtwysnesse as Mardoche saythe in the spyryte of god
that is to saye Lyght and son is vpsprynge to vs and meke lowly men vphaunsed in hys saynctes ye boke declareth what thys is to meane
lyght is vpsprongen to rightnesse that wandren in darkenesse of his lyfe and thys is our lorde Iesu Chryste that of hys owne mercy hathe shewed the people.
And thys we rede of true beleue in the story of our blessed Lady yt is to say Mary a virgyn hathe borne the souerayne sonne of richtwisnes that is

that shynen in thys crowne ben the .xij. artycles of the comon crede that is to say.
Thus shulde that soull be arayed that is chosen to be Chrystes spouse and worthyly is holy church lykened to a woman for a woman bryngeth forth bothe sonnes and doughters of her wombe but not without helpe and the wor+chynge of mannes sede.
So our mother holy churche bereth in her bely soules to be borne to the blysse of heuen but neuer without ye helpe and worchynge of the grace of our lorde Iesu Chryste
as the gospell wytnesshyth sayenge. without me ye may do nothynge that is to say medefully or thankworthy.
Here some men obiecten and sayen that the gospell is not of auctorytie but inasmoche as the church hath auctorysed chanonised it for they sayen.
No man knowith suche wordes to be gospel but as the church hath determyned in her determinacyon this conclusion semeth to smacke heresy
by the wytnes of saynct Austen sayeng on this wyse.
Heresy is false teachynge contrary to holy writ ful hardely defended most because of worshyp worldly wynnyng sithen al these ben fou~den in this forsayd obiection it is full suspect of heresye for it is wrytten from the begynnynge that god ordeyned man to be hed and lorde ouer the woman.
And agaynwarde the woman to be vnderloute subiect vnto ma~.
This great sacrament of knyttyng to gether a man his wyfe betokeneth the knyttyng to geder of Christ his church shal not than mannes
soull vnderloute to Christ in worde dede in this spirituall maryage more perfictly tha~ this woman can or may in the sacrament of fleshe saynct Iamys distroyeth this obiection sayeng
that god hath wylfully of his owne wyl gotten vs through the word of truth that we may be sum begynnynge of his creature and thys creature is one passynge creature holy churche that was chosen in the tyme of grace by the wa+ter of clensynge by Christes bloude of agayne byenge and by the vertue of the holy goste hallowyng were it not agaynst reason.
Ye and open heresy to maynteyne that the worde of god that hath gotten this creature holy churche
shulde not be of auctoryte without auctorisyng of thys creature holy church wherfore this conclusyon approued we graunt of beleue yt the churche is vnderloute to Christ his word in .iiij. maners.
Fyrste as the mone to the sonne the churche is fayre as the mone.
The seconde as therth to the fyrmament of whome it is made plentuous or watrede as dewe comythe downe from the fyrmament and tourneth not thether agayne.
But watrethe therth and makethe hit plentuous of fruytes so the worde of god norysshethe holy churche and makethe hit to brynge forth good fruytes.
of whome it is quyckened for it is the spyryte that quyckeneth and geueth lyfe.
maner as the bodye to the heed if whome it is gouerned for god the father hathe made hys sonne Chryste the heed
Chryste is the heed of the body of the church and euery chosen man and woman is called a son or a doughter of the churche
but all to gether ben the fullbody of thys church as sainct Paule sayth. we many ben one body in Chryste Iesu forsothe eche of vs ben others members but some chylder of this woman ben symple laborers and for that they parten and deuyden their true labour or trauayle therfore they represe~te the good loue of the holy goste and these dreden the lorde and walken in the wayes of hys commaundementes as the {pro}phete sayth.
Blessed be all labourers that drede the lorde walken in hys wayes for thou shalt lyue by the labour of thyne handes thou arte blessed and wel shalbe to the and this is the lowest estate that we cal comons some of these womans chyldren taken materiall swerde and ben made ministers of Chrystes godhed hauynge power and drede into wrathe and vengeans of them that done yuell and praysyng of them yt done wel and so by thauctoryte of saynt Iohan baptyst in the gospell of Chryst.
Principes it apperteyneth to the order of knyghthode to defende goddes lawe to mainteyne good lyuers and to iustifie or punyshe misdoers and thys is cleped the seconde state in holy church but some chyldre of this woman styren into hygh order of presthode ben ministers of Christes manhede
and these haue wytte and wysdome to open to the people the way of truthe and thys estate representeth the seconde person in trynyte that is the wysdome of ye father our lord Iesu Christ For sayncte Austyn sayth.
Knyghthode represe~tyng the power of the father is the vyccar of the godhede and presthode representynge the wysedome of the son is the vyccar of the manhede.
And these knightes techynge vnto vs the drede of goddes ryghtwysnes that punyssheth obstinate and open synners turnynge from his lawe in shrewdnes of theyr hertes and prestes techen vs by way of offyce ye loue that god hath to hys people that forgeueth them all theyr synnes when they come to hym and do very penaunce than helpe prestes with sacramentes to please god and wynne his loue for Paule monesshyth the prest Tymothy and in him al other prestes to take good intent to .v. thynges
Awake thou preste in busy prayer prayenge for the people deuoutly.
Trauayle ye prest in the lessons of holy writ studieng goddes lawe only.
The thyrde is this Do thou the worke of the gospell prechyng goddes lawe truly.
Vpon these .iij. estates standes the church that is appropryd to god and by the vertue of Chrystes incarnacion hit growith in mede to come to blysse.
Chryst Iesu toke flesshe and bloude in the maydene wombe and was borne bothe god and man to annex our kynde to hys godhed for when he toke our manhede he graunted vs his godhed.
And in this tyme in specyall maner he first gaue ernest to thys churche after thys was Chryste Iesu daptysed in Iordan and tempted thryse of the fende to lerne vs mekely to suffre temptacyon and toke the deth vpon the crosse by cruell iugemente of the Iewes.
And than the churche was trought plyght to Chryste cleped by name hys fayre clene spouse and as she had grace by deuocyon of fayth so she had worthynes of this name.
But when thys church is gon to heuen and restyth in blysse with Christ her spouse than is thys maryage fully sacred with deyntes euerlastynge delytes. whyles this lyfe dureth in erthe thys churche is cleped militant.
And when she slepeth in Purgatory then is she cleped the church slopande.
But when she restith of all her trauayle then she is cleped the churche triumphant.
true soull here in thys lyfe fyghteth agaynste the waues of synne to fle thassaultes of these .iij. enemys the fende the worlde and the wanton flesshe in purgatory she clenseth her selfe from rust corrupcyon.
But in heuen she holdeth the towre the victorye of all her enemyes and hath wone the crowne of lyfe that god hathe graunted to his louers. &c.
THe seconde church dyuerseth from thys for it is co~mynge to gether of good yll in a place that is hallowed far from wordly occupacyon for there sacrame~tes shuld be treated and goddes lawe both red and preched.
in this place our gracious god hereth our prayer in a specyall maner and bowyth his eare to his seruaunt in fourme as he grau~ted Salamo~ sayeng.
Myne eyen shalbe open and myne eares shalbe lyfte vp to the prayer of the~ that hathe iustely prayed in thys place and this is cleped a materyall place but it is made by ma~nes crafte of lyme timber stone with other necessaryes that lon+geth therto for mannes profyt thys place is made but not so man for the place.
And thys Chryst marketh in the gospel for man shuld not be begyled sayenge that the sabot is made for ye man not man for the sabot for man by vertue of goddes word hallowith this place but this place may not hallowe man.
The place halloweth not the ma~ but ye ma~ halloweth the place.
Alas then what wodenes is this to bost of holy places and we our selfes vicious foles.
Lucyfer was in heue~ which is ye most holy place but for
synne he fell into hell the place myght not holde hym.
Adam was in paradyce the moste mery place and for his syn was dryuen thens the place myght not defende hym.
Thou that arte not in heuen nor in paradyce but in thys wretched worlde where wenyst thou to fynde a place to hallowe the that leuyst not thy synne.
Be thou seker as god is in heuen it wyl not be for god is in no place fayre seruyd but there as his lawe is fayre kepte of hys people.
Adam that was the more worthy was made without paradice in the vnworthyer place Eue that was the lesse worthy was made within paradice in the worthyer place moche people demeth a medefull warke to make amendes agayne with curious buyldynges and many fayre musters in the church but Ierom forbedeth this thyng to be done and dampneth hit vtterly for greate syn nowe in this tyme of Christes gospell sayenge.
Many buylden walles pillers of the church they vnder putten with shyninge marble stones ye beames glystern all in golde the aulters ben dyuersly arayed with precious stones but of ye ministers of god ther is no choyse.
No riche man bye to me the temple in Iury bordes lanternes sensers pannes cuppes morters and such other made of golde for than these thynges were approued of the lorde whan prestes offred hostes and blud of bestes was remyssyon of sinnes though all these thynges went afore in fygure neuertheles: they be wrytten to vs into whome the endes of
Nowe truly Chryste our poore lord hath hallowed the house of ye churche of our pouertye bere we the crosse of Chryste riches accompte we as clay.
Vpon this writteth a great clerke sayenge that suche men semen to tourne the breade of poore men into stones and in that they ben more crueller than the deuyll that asked stones to be tourned into brede.
vanyte of all vanytees and nomore vanite tha~ asmoch madder ye church shineth in walles: she nedeth in the poore her stones she lappeth in golde and her owne sonnes she forsaketh naked of the charges expe~ces of the nedy is made a vayne seruys to the yes of ryche men.
But our newe fayned sectes in thys be moste to blame that maken great buyldynges there leste nede were as Monkes Chanons and Fryers No~nes Systers spytlers for people shulde drawe to parysshe churches and here the worde of god ther as god hath lymyted and elles they ben to blame.
Lorde what meaneth these waste places of these hyd Ipocrytes but to tell men by theyr synagoges where Satans sete is there lurken to gethers many rauysshynge wolues yt spoylen the people with theyr falce sines for reasons of holy wryt declared of doctours shulde teche you of this great defaulte yf that ye wyll amende.
But here me dredeth as Paule fayeth that the god of this worlde that is called Mammon hathe caste hys pouldre afore your eyen and blent your gostely lyght
may not knowe the gospell to the true vnderstandynge and that one payne of your greate synne tyll this sentence be fulfylled eche corruptible or eche worke that is rotten in ye rote shall fall in the ende and he that is founder of suche vngrounded worke shall fall and worthe to nought therwith in the last ende.
God pla~ted neuer these sectes in neyther of hys lawes neyther approued such maner of lyfe.
Chryst in his lyfe pulled them vp by the rotes that were i~ his dayes as Asseys Saduceyes Pharysees and dampned theyr ordenaunce and sayd when they growe agayn in Monkes Chanons Fryers that they shulde be drawen vp agayne by the rote as the gospell wytnessyth where Chryste sayde.
That eche plante that my father of heuen hath not pla~ted shalde rent vp by the rotes.
For all synneful inuencyons in man or in place that is amonge the people of the whiche god is not auctor though it growe fast for a tyme it shal be distroyed.
The fyrst reason that we shal make is shewed in thys maner.
These sectes ben ded from thys worlde as they saye in worde yf thys be sothe then shall they haue poore cotes of mournynge to tell in dede that thys dethe is true in them and in theyr workes and fle the maner of thys worlde in suche sterynge vanyte is as Paule teacheth in hys pystle vnto the Collosenses sayenge.
Ye that ben dead from the maners of thys worlde
your lyfe is hyd with Chryst in god therfore mortefy ye
and make ye deed your members that vpon the erthe the which ben fornicacyon of your members vnclennes of foule desyres with corrupte lykynge of flesshely lustes and foule couetyce of your hertes and auarice of gredy gatherynge whiche is seruice of ydolles and very ydolatry.
For these thynges comethe the wrathe of god vpon the sonnes of mysbeleue yf ye sectes for+sake thys lore the wrathe of god shall sone assayle you.
The seconde reason that we maken agaynste suche buyldynges is sayde thus busynes aboute suche costely buyldynges with many afolde worldly occupacyons to reparell them when they payren and to holde them vp.
In the same fourme bryngethe in neclygens of gostelye maners quenchynge of vertues and good thewes.
That holye monke that sued the steppes of Iesu Chryst and wolde not vary from the gospell to blame these sectes that gon awaye se (sayde he) that maye not be seen without great sorrowe many after that they be entred into the knyghthode of Chryst that is to forsake thys worlde and wilfully suffre payneful lyuynge efte they be drowned in worldly couetous and ben wrapped with worldly nedes and busynes they reuen vp walles but they ben neclygent in good thewes.
what profytith it to haue hye temples and the walles all gylte with golde where the spyryte of god wantethe.
Forsothe god hathe no delyte in suche wretched synful sectes.
But god wyll that our temples the which ben our soules to be honored with holy vertues laste to thende in good workes.
The thirde reason is myghty and stronge that spryngeth with other in goddes lawe that suche as parte them by them selfe from common lyfe of other men shulde be algates in thys waye as strangers that ben far from home pylarymes in there pylgremage.
we haue here no dwellynge place or cite but we seken that is to come.
Lord howe dare these sectes for shame with poore mennes goodes and pyllage of lordes defende this foule apostacye agaynste theyr god holy saynctes tell the lewde people by wordes of ypocresy that thus they do to god worshyp and this is doble wyckednes for Bernard{us} sayeth. we that ben in pylgremage of thys worlde as abiecte outcast shulde make no waste houses for to dwel in as lordes of this worlde but lytle cottes to serue in and sone to leue them go to blysse
we seruen in a strau~ge contrey we trauelen in a straunge countre.
The fourthe reason and the last is full lyuely and on this maner.
Godes lawe chargeth on all wyse to loue thy neybour as thy selfe but this loue is lest made knowen by good ensample of worde and dede in what thynges may these sectes profyte that reuersen here Christes rule and geuen ensample to their neybour in proude and in false couetice shewen them rychest and most wordly in mete cloth in curious buyldynge but thys forbedyth the
doctour Bernarde whome we haue ofte rehersed forsothe (sayth he) lowly houses and poore refraynen the couetyse of other and we owen rather to meruell the greate workes of god in the syght of heuen than in the sight of buyldyng of mannes handy worke and moche more we shulde meruayle the great workes of god than ye werkes of dedly men that duren but a whyle
all holy saynctes accordynge in thys that our churche materyall that is ordeyned for pharysshens where they come to geder shalbe made with vertuous meanes and in an honest measur.
But on all sydes it must be flede that in thys church ther shewe no pryde nor outrage passinge the bondes of pouertye neyther in stone timbre nor lede neyther in glasse lyme nor playster neyther in bell lampe nor lyght neyther in chalice boke nor vestyment neyther in steple seetes nor payntynge nor in other ornamentes that longen to thys churche.
And diligently thys must be kept that they bowe to pouertye to eschewe vayne glory of thys worlde and gloryfye the crosse of god.
But thys worde of Christes crosse is foly to hym yt shulde be dampned that tenten to signes as commyn hoorys and lesen the vertue of theyr soules.
Paule co~mendythe the commynge of Chryste and the lowe mekynge in hys manhode.
Ye owen to knowe the grace of our lorde Iesu Chryste for whan he was riche in all thynges he was made poore in man for vs that ye shulde be ryche in gostely
Christe that blameth all wanton meanes in the seruyce of hys people wyll not authoryse it hym selfe ne defende it in hys owne house as saynct Math.
That when Ihu~ went out of the temple theyr p~ized him his dyscyples for to shewe him the buyldynge ther+of and the curious worke in stones wenyng thus to please theyr mayster in seyng so fayre a temple.
But Chryste that had an inwarde syght howe the deuelles brekynge hys lawe went a way with doleful chere and taught his discyples of thynges to come howe thys temple shulde be distroyed and bad hym beware that no man be gyle them and sore Chryste wept vpon thys cyte for mannes buyldynge stode full stronge both body soul that he had made to his owne dwellynge place were fall from kepynge of his lawe in to the swolowe of stynkynge synne.
But scrybes and phareseis were in cause of this greate myschefe as Mathewe saythe wherfore Chryste warned them as hys greatest enemyes all ther folowers to the worldes ende Christ sayth Math.
wo to you scrybes and phareseys that clensen clene all that is outwarde but certes within ye ben replete with muche raueyne and vnclennes ye bylden the toumbys of holy {pro}phetes wonderly honoren there graues and ye sue your fathers steppes in pursuynge of ryghtwyse bloude and these sectes doo the
ye edders whelpes howe shall ye flee the iugement of hell thus saythe our lorde Iesu Chryste wherto make ye shrynes to saynctes yet ye drawen hangen brenne them that holden the way of Chryst and wandren after thys holye saynctes and you shewe not in your outwarde dedes ye done thys slaughter in worde and wyll as phareseys with bysshopes in the thyrde houre foriudged our lorde with there tonges and after knyghtes after the syxte houre hanged hys bodye vpon the crosse.
So these sectes gone before to smyte the people with tonge and after knyghtes of herodes house bene full redy to make an ende but the cause of thys pursuyte ben two vycyous extremytees.
One is temporall possessyon ye wrongefully standeth in prestes handes.
The othere is synnefull beggerye of myghty men with huge byldynge of many waste places and nedes they muste be amended by charyte of god for to saue theyr soules.
For tho that maynteyne these .ij. outstrayes bene full of many sclaunders by teachynge of the deuyll of hel lest his retynewe forsake them for than we shall fynde peace in erthe whan we kepe Christes ordenaunce and care nought though thou be slaundrede and thou leade a iuste and perfyte lyfe to righten this mysse put to thyne hande thynke what Christ behitith Marc.

He shall make hys soull safe in the blysse of heuen. {trefoil}.·.{trefoil} Of good and euyll comynge to this materyall churche.
AFter th{is} we shal speake of two dyuerse partyes that comen to gether to thys churche bothe of good and yll. Fyrst we taken for our grounde Christes holy gospell where he spekythe in a parable to his owne dyscyples.
The realme of heuen is lyke to a net that is sent in to the see gatherith to geder of al the kynde of dyuerse fysshes and whan thys net was full of fysshes the fysshers drewe it to the lande they syttynge besyde the see brynke chose the good into theyr vesselles the yuell they sente out and kept them agayne in the see.
This parable is thus to meane after ye wyt of Ihu~ Christ.
Seconde churche here in erthe is lyke to a net senden into the see for as the see ebbith and floweth.
So thys churche nowe ryseth and falleth to prayse for as the tempestes of the see ben hydeous perylous for the nette.
So Pryde that wauith in thys worlde is full noyous to Chrystes church.
Of beawty of fortune of goodes of grace all day men bolnen in hyenes of herte.
→The see water is full bytter and full frowysshe in the castynge and thys worlde is full
of enuy that is full bytter for to tast with hate as the soote that none vnnyth can acorde with other and ouer the see cometh greuous stormes with pyryes that greuen sore.
→And in thys worlde ryseth wrath with anger of herte that doth moche tene
in the see no grasse may growe neyther as farre as it maye flowe but it wastyth all the grounde maketh it naked without fruyte.
And in this worlde is vicious slowthe that stroyeth vertues in body and soule
and maketh man foltyd in hys wyttes in euery parte where so euer he streche: the see ay purchaseth with his waues wynnith of grounde that he neghith and is not apayed of the termes that god hathe sette yf it myght scape.
→And in this worlde is couetyse of them that purchasyn with wrong theyr neyboures grou~de catteles with sleyght cautyls of ma~nes lawe.
Thus they wynnen more and more and wyll not wysely spende theyr owne neyther thanke god in due fourme tyll they be caught in the fendes snare.
The see belchith vp moche fylthe and castyth from it moche corrupcyon and that is full abhomynable and lothely to loke vpon.
→And in thys worlde is lechery that defouleth body and soull
it tourneth the precyous temple of god into the lodge of grysely deuylles the people that haunteth this wretched syn ben maden as bestes without lawe and in thys bestely co~dicyon they fyghten as bestes without reason there they walken and twynen away
The see fell sythes with his great tempestes drowneth man and also vesselles loseth them or they come to londe. {trefoil}
And in thys worlde is glotony that drowneth the wyttes of the people tyll that they be vnreasonable can not knowe when they haue wronge.
Certes excesse of meate and drynke sleyth many mo than dothe the swerde.
For in diuers meates drynkes gredyly taken at meales is none heale but sickenes as the wyse man sayth both body and soul we must espye to fle these perelles that ben in thys greuous see and draw this net in water of wisdome by vertuous lyuynge to the hauen of helth with cordes yt ben of very mekenes with pacience and with long abydyng saylynge with loue charyte in holy spede good occupacyon largynge our handes i~ dedes of mercy pyte yt poore nedy may be our bedmen ledyng our lyfe in discrete measure in what yt we shall take or leue clad in clennes chastite.
And than shal Christ be al our comforte where euer we be by londe or water as he hathe grou~ded by his gospel Mat.
sayeng shalbe wt you in wele wo tyl this world be brought to an ende.
The fysshes swymmen in this water be al the people that be in this world both good yuell in euery degree of eche state or dignyte.
But as the great fysshes eaten ye smale so might+ty ryche men of this world deuouren the poore vnto ye bare bone eatynge the morselles that the best lyketh as the wyse man sayth Eccle.
The huntyng or the pray of the lyon is ye fylde as in wyldernesse so the fedynge of rychemen ben poore nedy.
And when the sonne shyneth warme in a mery season the great fysshes drawen nyghe the ayre dryuen downe ye small and yf ther come any hayle storme or any colde weder these great fysshes fallen to ground and putten aboue the smal.
So whan ryche me~ seen any worldly wynnyg they rysen hye aboue the clowdes in vauntyng of theyr riches and also lacken the symple co~myns seye that they may not paye wherfore do they entermete them they ben but very beggers but whan there a charge to the countre as taxis or any other payme~t than the ryche man fallyth downe and fayneth hym selfe nedy and magnifyeth the poore man that wonneth besyde them sayenge he is a preuy man and hydeth moche ryches.
The {pro}phete sayth i~ spirite how ryche e~m wasten the poore nedy he taketh ye voyce of great mone maketh his mournyng to hys god.
Lorde what shalte suffre men to be made as fysshes that swymmen in the see as they were crepyng bestes that haue no leder here in erthe and iugement is made ye crueller agaynseyng the mightyer wherfore the law is al to torne and iugement commeth to no perfyt ende for nought hathe the wycked wretche myght to ouercome the wyse man and therfore passeth forth amonge mankynde weywarde iugemente
that distroyeth peace but for that fysshes ben ryght quyuour and quycke in plenty of the water dreden not the hydeous waues whether they rysen hye or low.
In this place they shalbe taken as to syanyfye the true beleue of mannes herte.
And to thys wytte spekith Christe in hys gospell and steryth vs to pray.
For sothe (sayth Christ) which of you asketh my father a fysshe whether nowe shall he geue them for a fysshe an adder? nay playnly.
Chrisostome sayth vpon this texte that this fysshe is mannes fayth and after this we shulde pray to our father that is in heuen that he wold stable vs in true beleue and in the articles therto for than we shalbe dysposed in the water of tribulacyon to do and suffre as pleasith god ioyenge for this beleue and though there seme peryls of dethe conscience shall nothynge abasshe for socour is kept for al faythful in the tresure of Christes passyon.
The fysshers that drawen thys forsaid net are sent afore ye dome that shullen weyght+ly do goddes message and brynge all folkes by fore the face of godallmyghty in to the vale of Iosophat.
The lorde god sayth that he shal gather to geder al folkes he shal lede them into the vale of Iosophat ther he shall make with them a ryghtwyse reckenynge vpon hys people Israel that is his owne heritage and than shall Christe with his sayntes departe the yll from the good Chryst chesith the good of his churche into the vessell of blys but the uyel are casten out into the chymnye of fyre ther shalbe
wepynge for bytternes of smoke and gnastyng of tethe for quakynge of colde.
NO man descriuith these two partyes veryliche from other wandrynge in this seconde churche for lykenes that they vsen and also they haue in com+mon many heue~ly thinges.
For our lorde hath in his churche labourers aboute hys vynetre both fasters prayers and also wakers almysdoers ben in thys churche with preachours and reders of lessons and syngers trauelen here also with ministers of sacrame~tes with studyers in goddes lawe men that maken loue dayes and lyke seruauntes hathe the fende in the thyrde churche but they doo theyr seruyce in a straunge maner neuertheles they ben harde to knowe.
Therfore we shall marke them howe wonderfully they varyen in these forsayd conditions certes fasters in Christes churche absteyne them from lustes for to temper the coragis of the rebell fleshe kepe theyr body clene chast subiecte to there soule.
Thy body leuyth of thy soule the soule hathe her lyuynge of the god the body liueth ryghtfully after the soule whan the soule lyueth after god god is our souerayne good and our soule a great good:
that lyueth bytwext the souerayne good and our body a lytle good for it is goddes creature therfore it is cleped a lytle good forsothe the soule is not debytrice to lyue after the flesshe but euen on contrary wyse ye fleshe must nede be mortyfyed and whan thou leuest soule desires than thy flesshe is mortyfyed.
But fasters i~ ye sendes church fasten for vngrou~ded causes.
Some fasten for ipocresye sheweth them rufull to the people suche Christ blameth by his gospel clepith them sorowfull hypocrytes Math.
For all the vayne praysyng of mannes mouth they haue receyued all theyr mede.
Some withdrawen from theyr wombe bothe mete and drynke to spare theyr purse.
And Gregory saythe that thys fastynge is for theyr sachell and not for god and this is a carefull fastynge to payne our flesshe and lese our mede as the wyse man sayth Eccle.
He sawe vnder the sonne a nother yuel that is full ryue and commen amonge the people a man that god hathe gyuen ryches with catell and moche worshyp and nothynge fayleth hys lyfe of all that he desyeryth but then wantyth grace and power to eate or to take hys parte therof but a man that is a straunger shall deuoure hit after hys day but thys is a vanyte and great wretchednes.
Some fasten for a medycyne to gete them bodyly helth neyther for god nor for theyr soule but for to clense theyr beawtye.
Abstynence of body is clere to god whan the mynde fastethe from vyces what profytyth hit to tere the bodye with hungre whan the mynde within swelleth with pryde.
what fastynge is thys to withdrawe lyflode and to be wode in enuy or foole hastyte.
Lo whan ye fasten ye make stryfe and debates amonge your selfes.
Thys is not the fastynge that chose say the god the Lorde and sythen the fende neuer eatythe ne drynkyth neyther is lapped in precyous clothes yet he shalbe euer in payne for them lackyth charyte.
Than is thys an euydence that all suche fasters bene members in the fendes churche in folowynge theer fathers prayers that bene in Chrystes churche prayeng with deuocyon with al theyr strength of herte and of mouthe accordynge knockynge with a perfyte dede after helpe of god of mercy and forgyuenesse of tyme myspended and after grace and gouernaunce for tyme that is present and for good contynuaunce of tyme that is to come fresshely bryngynge to mynde the kyndenesse of theyr god howe he hathe ruled them in thys lyfe and kepte them from myschyefe as thoughe he had no mo but one so he saueth all that louen them.
That they thynken of foule synnes and fele that they haue done bothe wyttyngly and wylfully agaynste goddes wyll they haue ben recheles on his seruices and that them rueth sore and whan they thinken on this world howe sodenly it passeth
and of the tourmentes of hell that dampned soules shall suffre and on the blysse that god hath ordeyned for his trewe seruauntes anone they fynden a wasshynge well that spryngeth from theyr herte and renneth forth from theyr eyen by many warme stremes
Than we fynden rendles of waters when we wepen for all our synnes to wasshe clene bothe body and soule and clense the~ from corrupcyon.
But prayers in the fendes churche maken muche noyse mumlynge with theyr lyppes they rekkenen what so that men prayse fast theyr fayned occupation as Chryst sayth in hys gospel.
This people worshyppeth me with theyr lyppes but theyr herte is farre awaye from me.
Lorde whan thy body is in the churche thyne herte be in the worlde or cumbred with vnclene thoughtes with fantasyes and thy tonge with mynstrelsy on lewde iangelynge thy wytte ouercome with seculer nedes.
Suppose not this vayne man that he may take any thynge of the lord he may in no wyse be herde in prayer that suffreth his herte to slepe in synne and efte god sayeth by Ysaye in generall wordes to wycked synners. wha~ ye haue multiplyed your prayers shall not here you graciously and the cause why is thus for your handes be ful of bloude that is your workes be ful of syn that partyn you and me atwyne thus sayth the lord god but wete ye welye vycyous prestes that gone
from the lorde in vycyous lyuynge and wyll not folowe hys holy steppes but tarynge them from day to day therfore your prayers ben dispysed as Christ sayth yt can not lye. Mat.
wo to you scribes and pharyses ypocrites that eaten the houses of wedowes by longe prayers for thys thynge ye shulde take the larger iugement.
Vpon thys sayth Crisostome the sleyght or the wyles of ypocrytes women may not only knowe bycause of theyr relygyon they wyl sone bowe to the~ for they be nesshe.
Thys doctour makyth two specyal causes why they drawen to wydowes howses.
One is for women yt ben wedded vnder the power of mannes daunger dare nat geue these worldly goodes wtouten cou~sayle of their husba~des.
And other wedowes ben ful of pyty to geue when they be petiously asked haue no man to werne the~ this dede for her good is at her owne wyll for thys ende these flaterynge glosers most haunten wedowes howses.
Christe wyssheth them wo warneth our prestes that they forsake thys synneful maner for it is a cursyd dede to hyde synne vnder paynted relygyon and clothe wyckednes vnder ypocresye tyll it be trowed for very pety and in the armour of Ihu~ Chryste.
They done the fendes workes of hell whan they largen there longe prayers as nettes that bene sprede abrode and with crafte they catchen awaye the goodes of these sely wydowes.
These wydowes we shulde vnderstande both for woman and for me~ that wanten wysdome of Iesu Christ yt which
For Iesu nowe here delytyth but in them that louen his lawe. wakers that ben in Christes church waken in vertue deuout prayers and auoyden all dyuyses for they wyll not be negligent but holden and waken there inwarde eye that faythfully seeth the workes of god then riseth vp.
newe man fourmed after god shineth them in these thre vertues rightwyse+nes truthe and holynes.
This is wakynge to goddes worshyp to theyr owne saluacion to {pro}fyte of theyr euen christen.
Thys watche so chaseth ye fende yt he fleeth from all such wakers hath no might for to noye body ne soule as the wyse ma~ sayth.
The holsome watche of honesty shal make the flesshe melte from syn and busy thought in this fayre watche shal dryue awaye vnleful dremes.
Certes the thought of the fore knowynge turneth awaye the wyt from syn a great infirmite makyth a sobre soull.
But wakers in the fendes churche vsen a foule flesshly watche for euer they ben slombryng when any good dede is gone is ouercome with slepe yt bryngeth them to myschyefe for ye wyseman sayth.
Howe longe shalt thou slepe thou shlowe man whan shalt thou ryse fro~ thy slepe? Thou shalt nappe a lytle whyle thou shalt slumber a lytle whyle thou shalt knyt thy handes to geder tyll thou fall into dead slepe and than shall come to the nede as a wayfayrynge man and pouertye shall stele to the as an armyd man
Than men nappen whan they co~senten to do the fendes stirynge whan they wyrchen openly yt the fende desyreth in ye syght of the worlde than they ben in slombrynge.
But whan they maynteyne boldly what euer they done amys than they ben in deed slepe waken in theyr synnes changynge the nyght vnto ye day as horys theues trauelyng from place to place to reuel to rout assayeng wher with yt they may leue tokenes of theyr syn. Almesdoers in Christes church releuen i~ due tyme wt the plenty of theyr catel them yt suffren nede as saynct Paule sayth.
Loke yt your habundau~ce fulfyll the nede of other for ye thus doynge shallen receyue the blessyng of god as ye {pro}phete sayth.
Blessed be he that taketh hede on ye nedy poore.
Not vpon the couetous man the proude but vpon ye nedy and poore that is to wyte those that asken constrayned with nede take~ thyr almes with shame geuyng tha~kes to god lyue poorely ther+by.
First they seken godes wil done it to his worship.
The seco~de of true goten good clerely in theyr co~science.
The .iij. yt they knowe theyr brother lyue in gracious lyfe.
The .iiij. yt he suffreth nede wtouten any fayning for yf any of these faylen they lese both good mede.
But almysdoers in the fendes churche feden many wretches as stronge styffe beggers yt strykes ouer ye lande groners without cause than neden not of theyr good ye to mynstrels
iuglers and other vayne iapers that they delen largely theyr goodes to cleppen it an almes but trewe men seynge all a mys goodes thus spended for it draweth them to heuen as a boket into the well and yf they do any thynge there as nede is anone they seken vayne glory: lese all there mede.
For saynct Isodor sayth. whan the poore man is fedde bycause of vayne glory than is the worke of mercy tourned into synne as Christ saith Luce.
yf thyne eye ben aweywarde all thy body shalbe derke thyn eye is thyn entent that shuld rule thy co~science and this body is thy worke of entent taketh his lyght.
Than it is thus to meane whan thyne ente~t is not wel ruled thou getest no mede what euer thou do prechours that ben in Chrystes churche commen frely amonge the people as Chryste came from the toure of heuen and gaue this charge to hys discyples.
Paul chose rather to be deed than any man shulde auoyde hys glorye for mede that myght be geuen or taken agayne the gospel of Iesu Christ and these preachours prechen to edifyethe people in vertues as Christe commaunded on holy thursday to hys discyples afore the styenge Mathewe vltimo.
Ye goynge forth into all the worlde preche ye the gospell to eche creature that is to eche ma~ that is chefely eche creature and they lyuen vertuously them selfe after their prechynge for to streyght theyr holy wordes with the spiryte of life whan they geuen a true
ensample in dede after theyr sayenge and thys is the techynge of Iesu Chryst in the gospell of sayncte Mathewe.
Loke your lyght shyne so afore men of this world that they may se your good workes and gloryfye not you but your father that is in heuen of whome commeth all your grace.
But prechers in the fendes churche prechen vnder colour for to take gyftes.
But Gregory reproueth them sayenge. who so euer preche for goodes of this worlde or to make a gatheryng for such an heuenly office vndowtedly they pryuen them selfe from the mede that is to come of euerlastynge rewarde and they prechen cronycles with poyses and dremynges and many other helpeles tales that ryght nought auaylen.
They clouten falshed to truthe with moche vngrounded mater tarynge the people from true beleue that they may nat knowe it and these preachers waueren aboute in many flesshely lustes as Iude saith.
These ben spottes in theyr meates feastynge and fedynge them selfe withouten drede worshyppynge the persones of men for they wolde haue wynnynge reders in Christes churche reden holy lessons and tenden to theyr redynge with medefull deuotyon as Iierom saythe.
So rede thou holye wryt yt euer thou haue in mynde yt tho wordes yt thou redyst ben goddes law yt co~mau~ded it not only to be rede but also yt the readers shuld kepe it in theyr workes: what {pro}fiteth it to rede thynges to be done not to fulfyll them in dede? as a clene myrrour of life the lesson of holy wryt is
to be reade had that all that is good may be made better that this yuel may be amended these reders reden dystynctly yt is treatable openly in scripture withouten interrupcyon or any faynyd intermission without corruptynge or ouerhippyng of letter worde or sillable they shal accorde in charyte do all thynges in ordre.
But reders in the fendes church Iangle theyr lessons as iayes chatteren in the cage and wote not what they meane stryuing with them for nought eche agaynst other for rules of ther ordynall and many vayne questions and if they vnderstanden the lesson whan it is reade or any parte of godes lawe whan it is declared sone they treden it vnder the fote and haten it in theyr workes as Ieremy the prophete sayth in wytnessynge agaynst all suche howe may ye saye (saythe Ieremy) we bene wyse and the lawe and the lawe of the lorde is amonge vs. Certes the false style of the scrybes hathe wrought opyn lesynge and your wyse men bene confounded and aferde and caste in theyr owne snare they haue throwen abacke the worde of the lorde there is no wysdome leaste amonge them and efte god saythe by Ieremy to the veyne reders.
Cursyd be he that dothe the worke of god fraudulently that is to or disceyuable.
Onely in goddes seruyce that man do no fraude that wakyth full busyly in study of good dede and neyther boweth to medes of bodylye thyng nor seketh the wordes of mannes lewde
praysynge nor loketh after the fauour of a fou+les iugement.
Syngers ben in Christes church that syngen heuenly songes with theyr swete melody pleasen god at the full
Suffre ye the worde of god to dwell plenteously amonge you in all maner heuenly wysdome encresynge you in vertue techynge and monestynge your selfe in psalmes and ympnes gostely songes syngynge in grace with feruent deuotion in your hertes to your god and what euer ye shal do in worde or worke do ye that thyng perfytly in the name of our lorde Iesu Chryst yeldynge thankynges to the fader by the same Iesu Christe.
And sythen he is bothe god and lorde and kynge of all the worlde.
The prophete Dauyd counseyleth vs that we shulde synge wysely.
For he that is occupyed in heuenly desyres though his tonge be styll make no noyse.
He syngeth a songe sayth sayncte Austyne that lyketh god best.
Ananye Azarye Mizael also so~gen blessed songe to the lorde in suche maner song when they weren in Babylon in the bournynge surneys.
But syngers in the fendes church broken curyous notes that is but a puffe of wynde As sayth sayncte Bernarde wysely to please the people with lykerous voyce and fyll theyr eares with veyne de~ne.
But se what sainct Gre+gory saith which accordith with saynct Barnard whan fayre glosyng voyce is sought parfyte lyfe is forsaken and the people is ledde into
My people sytten afore the and heren thy wordes but they do not after them whan there backe is tourned for the prestes turnen them in songe of theyr mouth and the hertes of the people folowe theyr prestes auarice and is to them as a songe of musyke that is songen busyly and meryly with a lusty sounde and they heren the sermons but they kepen them not sayth the lorde god and efte god sayth by hys {pro}phete Amos.
Do away from me the pryde of thy chauntynge and shall not here ye songe of thyne harpe.
Lord what may this meane that prestes in theyr churche gyue them selfe thys moche to songe and so lytle to prechynge and in fewe places or none of the newe testamente shullen we grounde thys maner of songes neyther among our doctours but efte they ben char+ged to preache ye vnder great payne and all gates that they haue good wyll to do that they may that the people were truly taught to lede a sober lyfe.
Therfore Gregory in hys decree smyteth them with a curse that busyen them in the courte of Rome aboute suche syngyng where shuld be vsed the office of prechynge mynisters of sacramentes that ben in Christes churche be thynken them full besyly of the great worthynes.
Howe these sacrame~tes co~mmen of Christ and of his holy passyon taken of his blessed body for treasour of his churche and they ben salue and medycyne for all the sycke members wol shewe theyr great sores to goddes prestes
of wyse discrecyon and vse these sacramentes in theyr kynde.
As saynct Paule techeth Christ (sayth he) is offered our paske that noryssheth vs with his sacrame~tes and therfore make we vs mery in this gostely foode not in angre and tene of malyce and wyckednes.
But in the fayre pured past of clennes and of trouthe.
These two vertues techen vs to clense body soule whether that we shulde geue or receyue ye seuen sacramentes baptysme confermyng penaunce ordre Christes body Matrymony and ye last anoyntynge.
These helpen vs in this fightynge churche agayne the seuen dedly sinnes that ben vij. cruell deuylles.
The fyrst is Lucyfer that raignyth in his malyce ruleth ouer the chyldren of pryde.
The fourthe is clepyd Abadon the slowe ben his retynewe.
The fyfte deuyll is Mammon hath vnder hym the auarous and the couetous.
The syxt is called Belphagor that is the god of glotons.
The .vij. deuyll is Asmodeus that ledeth with him the lecherous.
But tho .vij. sacrametes casten out these deuylles from the seruauntes of god that receyuen them medefully and stablen them in .vij. geftes of the holy goste.
But mynysters in the fendes church mynystren these sacramentes and treten them vnworthely and al suche both lerned and lewde ben Iudas gostely chyldren for he toke the sacrament at Christes holy souper where Christe dealed his body in
brede as other aposteles dyden dranke with them his blode in wyne but with a vicious conscience wherfore the deuyll entred in them he betrayed hys lorde.
Thus it is with ye fendes chyldren whan they receyue the sacramentes they gone to them vnworthyly and so to theyr dampnacyon.
Some with polluted handes and with a stynkynge careyne as Parisens sayth and rehersyth Austyne.
He that is on the nyght a louer of Lechery and on the morowe a sacrar of the vyrgyns sonne god tourneth away hys eares from such mennes prayers.
Many faythfull doctours forbeden straytly to take any sacramentes of suche prestes handes but nowe it is and euer shalbe to the worldes ende.
Fooles fynden conuentycles that hasten them to hell some that ben as symondes heyres that sellen these sacrame~tes and some be redy with theyr money as chapeme~ in afayre to bye of these mar+chans marcha~dyse meryte as ther wene but both the byers ye sellers deserue endeles payne Some sayen haue here my money for christenynge of my chylde.
Some sayen haue here this money and assoyle me of my synnes.
Some sayen haue here this money and synge for me a masse.
Some sayen haue here thys money for thou hast made this maryage.
Some sayen haue here thys money and sacra me to prestehode.
Some sayen haue here thys money for thou haste ofte vysyted me.
Some sayen haue thys money and good syr pray for me.
theyr suffrages where euer they fynde theyr chapemen that wol pay largely therfore.
Saluator? or godes law or the Actes of the aposteles where suche marchandyse is dampned.
Forsothe when Symon Magus had seen that by touchyng of ye aposteles handes the holy goste was geuen to the people he proferyd them money saynge.
Geue to me also this power yt who so euer touche with my handes may receyue the holy goste.
Thy money be with the for vs take it thy selfe to thy dampnacion for thou trowest the gyfte of god to be sette to sale for money there is no parte ne lot to the in thys sermon of god.
Than these that we haue marked afore in this ben the very heires of Simon for they wene whan they haue money to graunt to the people these gostely gyftes and Symon is dampned and all hys folowers: howe moche more these cursed takers? For yf saynct Peter had taken thys money he had geuen leue to vse symony.
But Peter forsoke and blamyd thys man and put a rule that shall laste and cursethe and dampneth bothe gyuers and takers for bothe partyes bene symonyake.
Ones Iudas made a couenaunte with the Iewes for thryttye plates and solde hys mayster Iesu Chryste betrayenge hys bodye into theyr handes whan he came chefely to dye and hys dethe was our redempcyon therfore hys
name is cursed Iudas and well worthy for his false trayne.
But his chyldren do moche more were that sellen the sacramentes and that for lesse pryce that ben vndedely and mowt not suffer neyther any profyt cometh of ye sale but vengeaunce here or elles wher.
Alas whan woll these wretches be ware? Studyers in Christes church studyen day and nyght in the lawe of the lord as the prophete sayth.
Blessed be that ma~ that hath his wyll in the lawe of the lorde for he shalbe as a tree that is wisely plantyd besyde the course of waters that shall geue frute in hys due tyme and his lefe that is his vertue shall not fall away but all thynge that he shall do in grace shullen be welthy. well is them that so may studye to fynde these precyous vertues to make fayre their owne soule with the flowre of holy wryt.
Than Christ wyll take his restynge place in the chambre of theyr co~sciences for the wysema~ saith.
And therfore saynct Ierom cou~seyleth in his prologe vpon ye byble.
sayth Ierome that thou haue thy study thy mynde amonge the lessons that ben in holye wryt.
Busy ye nothyng elles to seke set thyne herte in holy studye and pursue after with all thy myght thou shalt fynde it in short whyle more sweter than the honycomb as the wysema~ sayth.
Haue thy thought in goddes hestes and in his co~maundementes be thou most busy and he shall graunte an herte to the and a luste of
But studyers in the fendes churche studyen in theyr maden lawes all for ryches for pryde and for theyr worldly worshyp.
Yea so ferforthe that vnneth any man is fou~den that abydeth in goddes law clene without medelynge but draweth them to mannes lawe for that smatcheth wynnyng and theyr they studyen sad and sore.
But at theyr last ende this shalbe theyr payme~t as god saith by Ieremy.
Cursyd mote that man be that settyth his fayth in man and puttyth hys truste and strength in mannes maden ordynaunces and suffreth theyr herte to departe away from hys lord god.
Certes this ma~ shalbe as a brome that groweth in wyldernes and he shall not se in inwarde syght whan that good of the soul shal come to them but he shall dwell in drynes in the londe of wyldernes thus sayth the lorde god.
Such men sclaundren Christe that is bothe god and man and hath halowed his bothe lawes with hys precyous dethe and put in them the spyryte of lyfe by quyckenynge of his blode to rere soules from deth and brynge them agayne to lyfe as the gospell telleth.
where Christe sayth. who so euer beleueth on me yea thoughe he be deed neuertheles he shall lyue agayne both in grace and glory.
But this is not in ma~nes lawe that may geue this power.
Than is this afoule sclau~dre of these wayward fooles that thus studyen in ma~nes lawe and if it were the and therfore suche frowarde thoughtes departen their soule from god.
From the leaste vnto the moste all studyen vnto couetyse that is to vnderstande of them that ben in the fendes churche ferre from the preacher all worke gyfe therfore they shullen fal amonge them that fallen they shall fall in tyme of vysitacyon sayth the lorde god.
God rehersyth thys sentence agayne for we shulde take hede therto.
But for they wol not amende their studyes and tourne theyr thoughtes to god.
Therfore god wyssheth them wo and saythe this by the prophete Mycheas. wo to you that thynke ye thyng that is vnprofytable and wurchen euyl in your studyes.
In ye morowe lyght Peacemakers in Christes churche mouen men to reste that Christ behyte to his dyscyples whan he was amonge them.
My peace (sayth Chryste) geue you my peace leue with you.
His peace he lefte with vs whan he wente to heuen his peace he shal geue vs wha~ the world shall haue his ende hys peace he be+toke vs to helpe vs in this world his peace he grau~ted to vs to solace vs in blisse he hath left vs his peace to be our trusty clothyng for if we be clade therin we shal ouercome our enemyes he shal graunt vs his peace we shalbe suer to reigne without ende without any enemyes he hath left vs his peace that we deme not falsely of our neyghboure in thynges that ben vncertayne he shall geue to vs hys peace whan he shall make open the preuytees of mannes herte and than shalbe praysynge to euery man of hys god after he hathe deserued.
hath lefte amonge vs peace that we shulde loue togeder hatynge synne and louynge vertue for thus he loued vs for there is no charyte but yf synne be hated rented vp by the rootes in vs and in all other than shall Chryste geue vs full peace where we may neuer dyscorde.
Thus sayth sayncte Austyn vpon the same gospell that is afore rehersed.
Nowe grounde we it in our mynde these Peacemakers for they wold haue thys very peace among them standen armed at all pecys for dreade of theyr enemyes in ye armour of Iesu Chryst.
That saynct Paule techeth to the Ephesyans in ye syxth chapiter wher he rehersyth syxe armours that armen the soule fyue for to defende with the syxt for to assayle.
The fyrste is a gerdle of chastite ther+by may we knowe that Paule vsyth the wyt of the soule leueth bodyly armour.
This gerdle gerdeth vp in theyr hynden saueth chastyte peace the body fro~ Lechery in these thre degrees.
In maydens it kepyth virginite in wed+ded trew matrimonye in wydowes co~tynence yt is fro~ bodyly vncle~nes.
Take ye this gerdle in goddes name yt ye may standen {pro}fyte in ye peace of your soul agayne al flesshely stirrynges.
The seconde armoure is an haberyon of ryghtwysnes that is thykke mayled for falshoode shulde not entre for to greue god or man or trouble thys trewe peace.
The thyrde Armoure is a legge harneys and shoynge of affectyons in the gospel of Iesu Chryst and than they ben dysposed to make peace amonge men not
as the worlde askyth but that they stonde sure and perfytely in all aduersyte with Chryst and hys gospel to the deth day.
The fourth armour is a shelde of fayth in which they shullen quench al the fendes brenning darth that ben his temtacyons.
Certes there may no dedly dyntes stele in that man that hath the shelde of trewe beleue hangynge in his herte.
Therfore he ledyth hys lyfe in peace and quarte fro~ al gostely syckenes.
The fyfte armoure of the soule is an helme of helthe that is cleped trusty hope for it berethe of strokes that ye fende throwith at ma~nes soule with two dispicious gynnes.
But who that hathe the helme of hope thoughe strokes lyghten on them they shall in no wyse braste this palet ne synke into the soule therfore he lyuethe peacebly in hope of goddes mercy.
The syxt armoure of goddes knyghtes with whiche they done assaile is the swerde of the spirite that is goddes worde with this swerde Iudith the wedowe smote Holofernes and cut his heed from the bo+dy in sauynge of her people.
And in this swerde Ihu~ Christe assayled the fende of hell. whan Christ said.
For thys swerde is full sharpe and byteth on bothe sydes for it partyth at one stroke ye soule and body a sondre and it departyth in this lyfe vertue from synne and it shal departe at domes+day ye good from the yuel in this swerde kynge Solomon gaue true iugemente and dyuyded
God geue vs grace to take thys swerde of kynge Salomon with Iudyth and with Iesu Chryste and than theyr is no doute for al that taken this swerde and stande on this armour Christ our captayne blessyth them and clepyth them hys chyldren.
Blessed be al these peace makers (sayth Christ) for they shalbe cleped the sonnes of god.
And efte Christ sayth Loue ye your enemyes do ye well to them that haten you and pray ye for your pursuers and your sclaunderers that ye may be the sonnes of your father that is in heuen.
But peace makers in the fendes church confedre them to geder in a false peace after the maner of this worlde yt Christes gospel dampneth where he sayth.
But to sende a sharpe swerde to smyte synne from mannes soule and this these synnefull wretches throwen vnder fete faith trouth rightwysnes they counten at no price for they ouer leden the cou~tre after theyr owne lust.
haue (saythe he) sorowed on wycked men seynge the peace of synners but Prestes and knyghtes of this some ben moste to blame.
Prestes that shulde be gostely leches and reconsyle the people by good counseyle to theyr god and hele them with hys lawe what with couetyse and many flesshly lustes these prestes ben so blynded that they knowe no wysedome for Iob askynge this question.
wher wysdome may be fou~de anon he answeryth with ye spirite
These wordes of great sorow to them that ben gylty. who that is fedde with plesures or lustes of this present lyfe without any doute that man is departed from the vnderstandynge of euerlastynge wysedome.
And sithen these prestes be geuen to this flesshely lustes they faylen gostely syght and wysedome to ransake any gostely syckenes or to serche aboute the perell of a wounde and yet they ben presumpteous to pro+fer false medecyne vndertake great cures for to make men hole but they hurten them moche sorer than they were before as ye lorde moueth by his {pro}phete Ieremy.
These prestes helydden the contrycyon of my people with shenshyp or with shame that is with foule symony as we rehersed aforne.
Peace peace whan theyr was no peace they ben worthy to be spent yt haue done abhominacyon moch rather in thys cofasyon they ben not confunded for they haue not ben ashamed of theyr owne felony.
Thus sayth the lorde god and efte he sayth from the preachours that commeth defoulynge vpon all the erthe.
These thynges sayth ye lorde wyll ye here the wordes of these preachours yt prechen desceyuen you.
They speken ye visyon of theyr herte but not of ye lordes mouth they sayen to tho that blasphemen me.
The lord spekyth that peace shalbe to you and they haue sayde to eche man that walkethe in shrewdnes of his herte theyr shal come none yll vpon hym.
Yuyll prestes ben cause of ruyne decaye of the people no wounder for wha~ the lyght is quenched that shulde shyne in prestes tha~ is theyr moche stynke with wickked fauour and blyndnes that cumbrith ye leder the folower into the derkenes of hell as ye gospell wytnessyth. whan the blynde ledith the blynde fall they not tha~ both into the dyke or lake? yes playnly.
The former blynde is ye prest yt wantith vnderstandyng for you haue the lettryne fayle in good lyuyng than he is a blynd prest of whome Christ spekith as the commen glose sayth aboute nought he bostith the knowyng of godes law yt distroyeth ye lore with his wycked workes.
The other blynde is man wo+man yt trusten in such prestes to lede them in the way of lyfe bryng them to saluacion.
But Christ hath iuged both these partyes to fal into ye dungyon.
Of such prestes co~meth debate in all the world yt distrobleth very peace cryeth open vengeaunce.
And these prechours ben no prechours but only in name as a luschborne is clepid apeny is nought worth.
Knyghtes also ben to blame yt mysusen theyr power wyl not rede is goddes lawe neyther lerne theyr office.
Here ye knyghtes vnderstande ye knyghtes for power is only of the lorde and strength cometh of them that is hyest that shall aske rekennynge of all your workes and shal serche fully the inwarde of your thoughtes.
For whan ye were mynysters of godes realme neyther ye demed ryght+fully neyther kepte ye his lawe neyther ye
walked in the way after goddes wyll but ye strayed all away as yf it were wylde lyons in oftyn takyng of moch meate that styryth you to moch drynkynge than ye lyggen longe in cowchis that draweth you to Lechery sometyme to spousebreche and other foule vnclennes and of this commethe stryuynge and fyghtyng euer anon that bryngeth you to enmyte and hate of eche othere.
Howe shulde ye knyghtes maynteyne peace whan ye forsake it in your selfe for with your greuous tirannye oppression extorcyon your awe is lawe. who dare say nay but as ye woll your selfe.
But wete you well thys is the voyce of them that shalbe dampned as the wyse man sayth.
Our strength our power be it to vs the lawe of ryghtwysnes.
Here ye therfore howe dredfully it folowith ye sentence sayd afore if that ye wyl not amende you.
Ferefully and sone it shall shewe to you that most harde iu+gemente shalbe to them that lorden or that holden lordeshype ouer poore bretherne mercy is graunted to them that ben lowe in herte mighty men myghty shullen suffre turmentry forsothe the Lorde shal not withdrawe the person of any man neyther he shalbe ashamed of any mannes greatnesse for he hathe made bothe small and great and chargith ne one ne other forsothe to the stronger is made stronger crucyacyon in payne.
Thhese forsayde prestes and knyghtes throughe such vicious dedes leden ye commennes on theyr rynge and bolden them in synne so that all this worlde is set in errour in batayle
But nowe be co~men to the preste the wordes that god hath sayde by the prophete Ieremy to teache his chosen seruau~tes.
Al these ben aduolterers and a company that breken the lawe they haue stretched forth theyr tonge as a bent bowe to shutte lesynge no trouth eche man at other they ben comforted in the erthe for they gone from yuell to yuel and they haue not knowen me sayth the Lorde god eche man from his neybour kepe them selfe full wysely and in his owne brother he may haue no truste for eche brother in dysseyte shal begyle othere and the man shall scorne hys brother and they shall not speke truth forsothe they haue taught theyr tonge to speke lesyng and for they wolde done wyckedly they haue sore traueled they haue forsaken in trechery to knowe me saythe the lorde god wherfore these thynges sayth ye lorde of hostes.
Lo shall wele them to geder and shall proue them what shall elles do from the face of my people an arrowe wou~deng is theyr tonge for it spekyth gyle and he spekyth with his frendes peace with his mouth but pryuely he layeth for hym spyes to disceue them.
Nowe whether shal they not vysyte vpon these thynges saythe the lorde god or shall not my wyll be venged vpon suche a folke? as yf he wolde
shalbe venged for as theyr wyl is to go from me so my wil is to be venged vpon the~ when se my tyme but happely here some woll saye god woll not take vengeans on hys christen people god woll not lese that he dere
To the fyrste we answeren by the mouthe of god.
your fathers (sayth he) haue forsaken me and gone after goddes for to do them seruyce and worshyp them also but they haue forsaken me and not kepte my lawe.
But ye also done moche werse than euer wrought your faders.
Lo eche of you walketh after the shrewydnes of his euyl herte that he here not me sayth the lorde god and shall cast yrou away out of this erthe into a lande that is vnknowen to you and to your fathers and there ye shal do auarice to alyen goddes that shal gyue no rest neyther nyght ne day.
And to ye seco~de we answeren as Christ sayth in his gospel.
Frende howe entrest thou hether not hauynge thy brydale clothes he waxt domb.
Take this wretch bou~den hande and fote sende him into vttermost darkenes their shal be wepyng and gnastynge of tethe vnderstande thou by this frende both man and woma~ that hath taken christendome and holdethe the name but they wanten in theyr lyuynge the workes of treue beleue therfore Christ wardeth them in to the payne of hell.
How ye good of ye seco~de church accordyth with the first churche.
Ca. x. HEre shal we tel howe the good of the seconde church accordeth with the fyrste churche appropred to god Faythe Hope Charite as we haue sayde aforne knytten togeder god and man in one heed of this church.
Thys knotte is knytte so sekyrly that it shall neuer more fayle neyther here ne elles where as the wyseman sayth.
For to make this thre folde corde we must haue thre lynkes eke the~ forth perfyte tyll this corde be wrought by whiche this church shalbe drawen vnto the holy Trynite.
These ben the fyrst thre a chast body a clene soule and goddes truly dysposed than it shalbe eked with good holy thought a perfyte dede more ouer we must large forth shryfte of mouthe sorowe of herte amendes makynge after this it askyth prayer fastynge almysdede than must we put to nombre weyght mesure.
Also we must eke this worde wt minde wyll reason and helpe forth to thende with Faythe Hope Charite than we shal neyghe to our god thorough grace mercy ryghtwysnes tyll we se god in Trynite Fader Son holy Goste.
Euery me~bre of this churche helpith yt it may to wyrche one parte of this corde for the co~men {pro}fyte as sayncte Austen saythe.
Holy churche is a ferme of all ryghtwysenesse that is to say a comen accorde of al good thinges and thys churche prayethe in commen and
For without felowshype of thys generall churche baptisme may not profyte neyther the dedes of mercye but it be that the paynes of hell be lesse all the members of a man trauelyn in theyr ordre eche for to socoure othere none for to hyndre but for to do theyr co~myn helpe to the profyte of the body.
Thus it is of the members that ben in Christes churche for it is a godly body that growith with theyr me~bers theyr one fayleth an othere helpeth tyll the corde be made.
Some haue fayre eloquence to preche it to the people.
Some haue pety and releuen theyr nedy neybours Some tenden vertuosly to minister sacramentes.
Some styen hyely to rest in heuenly thynges or lykynges but all suche thynges ben in co~men to them that shalbe saued as the prophete sayth.
Lorde am partener of all them that fere or dreden the and of all that kepe thyne holy commaundementes.
Thus teacheth also the commen crede in an artycle of the sayth yt must nede be grau~ted whiche is the communion of saynctes.
For what that euer be done in Rome or in any other places yf that thynge be couenable in the syght of god than it is couenable to all these members that seruen god in vertue to helpe them to their endelesse ioye as we haue sayde afore
Christ sayd to Peter and in him to all his folowers to the and to all suche as thou arte shal gyue the keyes of ye realme of heuennes is this church here in erthe.
Ierom sayth and the mayster of the sentence reherseth this.
All mynisters of the church in bysshopes and prestes haue the iudiciary power as saynte Peter had but therfore Peter specyall toke of god this power that all men may vnderstande that who so euer departeth them from vnyte of stedfast fayth and felowshyp of this church he may neyther be assoyled fro~ bondes of his synnes neyther he may entre into ye blysse of heuen.
Se nowe here both leryd lewde how prayers ben in co~myn and all other suffrages to thys gostely church.
whence cometh tha~ this out crye that is set on broch sale kene in euery church to sell these gostely thynges with suffrages and soyleme~tes many yeres of pardon? a plenarye indulgence pena et culpa but moch rather it shulde be sayd a glorie et pecunia.
Certes they come from byneth of the fendes temptynge ben borne all about of his cursyd members to poyson the people in mysbeleue as sainct Ierom sayth and parte them from goddes felowshyp by wytnesse of saynct Austen dryue them to theyr endeles payne as we haue sayd aforne.
BVt for that we repreue these synnes thys yuell parte grutchyth and pursueth with strong hande to pryson and to slee therfore muste we lerne thys lore of Chrystes holy gospell.
and haue pursued you haue sayde all yuell agaynst you lyeng for me ioye ye and be ye mery for your mede is moche in heuennes.
And also saynct Peter sayth. whan that ye suffren any thynge for ryghtwysnesse.
Blessed mote ye be saynt Paul affirmeth this sentence yt goddes seruau~tes shullen haue payne in this lyfe to kepe them in vertue.
All that euer wol lyue mekely in Chryst Iesu shal suffre persecucyon.
And saynt Luke sayth of ye wordes of Paule in dedes of ye aposteles.
By many tribulacions it behoueth vs to en+tre into the realme of god.
Many ben the tribulacions that fallen to the ryghtwyse fro them al whan tyme cometh god shall delyuer them.
Christ behyght the maner of lyfe to his owne discyples and gaue them co~forte that they shulde haue a gracyous delyuerance for than shall blysse be moche the sweter whan they comyn therto.
Truly say vnto you ye trouth that ye shulde sorowe and wepe forsoth the worlde ioye ye shulde be full heuy and after this your heuynes shalbe tourned into ioye and your ioye shalbe sekyr that no man shall take it from you and for this
ioye shulde sauour well to them that ben his louers he sendith them tribulacion as saynt Gre+gory sayeth.
God shewith to his chosen sharpe+nes in this iourney lest by hap yf they delyted them in this dedly way they myght forgeyte thynges that ben in ye heue~ly cou~tre tribulacions yt brisen vs downe in this wretched world they constrayne vs to go to god that they light+ly myght be da~pned for ye eyen that synne closyth payne maketh open many that haunten theft with many other synnes if they were lame blynde or croked of godes visitacyo~ they shuld cesse serue theyr god do penau~ce ful trewly as Crysostome sayth.
The soule is a spirite (sayth he) and dredeth spu~all paynes of the flesshe.
And therfore saynctes dyspysen the paynes of this worlde drede ye last iugement where spyrytes ben tourmented forsothe the flesshe can not drede gostely paines to come but he dredith in this life to suffre any paines ther+fore ye yuel cessen not to do syn but if iugement of the flesshe constraynen them to be styll for this cause ye lorde shal sende vpon his seruau~tes sore punysshyng to theyr flesshe other tribula+cions.
The lust of ye flessh may be sweled from ye couetynge of yuell. we muste nede breke the nut yf we wyl haue the cornell we must nedes suffre trauell yf we desyren reste.
So must we nedes suffre payne yf we wyll come to blysse.
He is a false cowarde knyght ye fleeth hydeth his hed whan his mayster is in ye felde beten amonge his enemyes but our lord Ihu~ Christ was of
the Iewes and after dyed in the felde on the mounte of Caluarye to pay our raumsome he toke his deth for that he was nothynge gylty and hys body whan it was offered made at the full for redempcyon of mankynde.
Forgete thou not the kyndenes of thy borowe forsothe he hathe geuen for the his life.
This borowe is our lorde god that without mede came from heuen in to this worlde to borowe his people in takynge of flesshe blode of the virgyn mary he shewed vs grace and kyndenes both in worde and wyrchynge.
But in geuynge his lyfe he leyd his bo+dy in pledge yea to the deth he woll not spare to suffre extreme payne so moche he loued his people yf that fayth be in vs thys maye not be forgoten.
Some forsaken synnes and suen Chryste in vertue and this is a great kindenes though they styen no hyer.
Some do wake in abstynence and studyen holye lessons thys is than a greatter kyndnes yf thou fle from syn.
Some ben redy whan they ben called of the holy goste to suffre dethe for Iesu Chryste and wytnes of his lawe and whan they haue cle~nes in lyuynge this is the greatest kyndenes as the gospel sheweth.
greater loue or charite may no man haue than to lese his lyfe for hys frendes soule we were dere and leffe to god whan we toke the baptysme but we haue moch dere worthyer whan we done the workes that god hath bydden in his lawe without any grutchynge and yf we maynteyn this
not go therfro neither become rennegates for ye paynes yt may fal but thinke on Christes passyo~ that swageth al heuynes tha~ we ben most dere worthy and worthy hyest meryte therfore saynct Paule sayth to the Galathies.
Fere be it to me to make any glorye but in the crosse that is the passyon of our lorde Iesu Christe by whome this worlde is crucyfyed to me and am crucyfyed to the worlde.
Some ben not crucifyed to the worlde but the worlde is crucyfyed to them for they despisen the world but the worlde not them.
Some ben crucyfyed to the worlde but not so the worlde to them for though the worlde despysen them they dispysen it not againe.
Some ben neyther crucified to the world ne the worlde to them for neyther they dispyse the worlde ne the worlde them.
But in the thyrde fourth degre bene tho yt shulde be dampned therfore we shuld vnderstande that some suffren payne for to saue the people and so dyd Iesu Christ whan it myght not saue the~ selfe shewed his great kyndenes.
Some suffren payne to purge them of theyr synne that they haue done i~ time afore cryen god mercy.
Some suffren payne to kepe them from syn that they shulde be combryd with if no payne were but some suffren payne for they haunten syn and for they maken none ende.
Ioyne than the crosse of Chryst vnto our bare flessh that our parte may be founden amonge these holy saintes
that wylfully forsoke them selfe and ioyed in trybulacion as saynct Iames sayth.
My brethern hope ye all ioye whan ye haue slyden amonge dyuerse temptations knowynge that ye prouynge of your fayth wyrchyth pacience forsoth pacience hath a parfyte worke that ye mowe be perfite in soule and hole in body and in nothynge faylynge.

Of these ten co~mau~+deme~tes ye fende fayneth his accion to troble the good of ye church sende them to pryson here it semeth spedyer to tell ye fendes cautyles yt he vseth in his me~bers agaynst godes heftes as ye cloude in ye day so marrith he ma~nes wites.

Agayne this co~mau~dement ye fende hath leyde two snares in them he catcheth ye people yt they may not scape: but ether they must grau~ten to his wyl or elles they shuld to prison The first is cleped obedyens yt the fende chalengeth chiefly for to be done to him or to his leef tenauntes as to prelates or to prestes that ben his officers asken this obedyence what euer they co~mau~den ye symple me~ obey to the~ hye low.
Al this world crieth loude after this obe+dience: sayen what euer thy souerayn biddeth: yu shalt obey therto.
Here we grau~ten of beleue yt we owen obedyence to our soueraynes yt techen vs to knowe god drede him ye whether they that ben ministers in the spu~all parte or officers
in the temperalty we must obey to them in that they obey to god and lerne vs obedyence for thus is wryten.
No whether wyl the lorde brent offerynges or sacryfyces and moch better it is to take to lawe tha~ to offre ye fatnes of rammes for it is as the syn of wytchcrafte to fyght agayne god as ye felony of Idolatry: not to consent to goddes worde for this cause therfore that thou hast cast awaye the worde of the lorde the lorde hath cast ye away that thou be no longer kynge.
Moch better is obedyence than sacryfice of fooles for yuell folkes wote not what they done.
And saynct Paule teacheth an open rule of this maner of obedience with the cause of souerantye and knyttyth them both to geder.
Obey ye (sayth he) to your soueraynes vnderlowte ye to them and the cause why is this.
Forsothe they waken perfyttely as for to yelde a rekenynge for your soules yf thys cause be taken away obedyence cessyth there also as the philosopher sayth whan the cause cessyth the spede therof shal also cesse.
But saynt Peter teacheth obedyence that we shuld done to lordes that in more larger maner than we owen to ye clergy.
Seruauntes (sayth he) be ye subiectes in all drede to your temporall lordes not only to good and easy lordes that is to say in loue but also to tyrantes yt is to say in pacyence but fendes lymmes faynen them to be on Chrystes syde and to do corrections after Christes wil seyn they aske obedyenee to amende soules
whan they do thys thyng in dede that they here speken than we shal obey to them and elles we shall answere as Peter sayde to prestes bysshopes of the law.
Yf ye prelate or the Lorde bydde any thynge that accordeth with goddes wyll obey thou then to them yf they bydde the contrary to god and to hys lawe than say thus must rather obey to the lorde of the soule than to the lorde of the body.
wil ye drede them that slayne ye body forsoth they may not slee the soule but rather drede ye hym that may slee bothe body and soule into hell thus say to you drede ye him.
And yf we passe this rule in doynge of obedyence than we were vnbuxum to god and folowers of Lucyfer.
The seconde trappe of the fende is clepyd pylgremage but moch rather it shulde be sayed the outrage of fooles.
The payntours makith an ymage forged with dyuers colours tyll it seme in foles eyen as a lyuely creature that is set in the church in a solempne place fast bounde with bondes for it shulde not fall.
Prestes of the temple begylen the people with the foule syn of Balaam in there open prechynge they sayen that goddes power in wyrchyng of his miracles
lowyth downe in one ymage more than in a no+ther and therfore commyth and offrith to this: for here is shewed moche vertue.
Lorde howe dare these fe~des for drede thus blaspheme theyr god and vse the synne of Balaam that goddes lawe hath dampned? Sithen Christ and his discyples forsoken this the welthe of this worlde and lyueden a poore lyfe as our beleue techith: why gadren ye prestes rychesse with your painted ymages to make your selfe worldy ryche in spoylynge of the people and yet ye done moche worse and for ye and your consentours thus doynge bene very Idolatrers
This people (sayth he) sayeng them selfe to be wyse they bene mad fooles for they haue chaunged the glorye of god that maye not be defouled into the lykenes of mannes image that maye be defouled.
And Paule saythe when they knewe the ryghtwysnes of god they wolde not vnderstande that they that done suche thynges bene worthy of dethe not onely the doars but also they that consenten to the yuell doers for god saythe thou shalte neyther worshyp ne lowte them for thou shalte neyther do sacryfyce to image ne offerynge and that meaneth god when he sayth thou shalt not worshyp them with no godly worshyp but yf they be paynted truly as nye as man maye to brynge to mynde as Gregory sayth the passyon of Iesu Chryste
But sayncte Austen sayth vpon all wyse they haue deserued to erre
that seken god not in bokes but in paynted wowis he also sayth thou shalt not vowe to these ymages thou shalte not seke these ymages thou shalt not swere by them neyther knele to them ne kysse the~ neyther put fayth ne Hope ne truste in one ymage more than in another and thus menyth god whan he saythe thou shalt not loute them.
Fyrst we ben pilgrimmes when that we ben borne as the commyn glose sayth vpon Genesis.
Euery cytezyne of the heuenly countre is a pylgreme of thys worlde for all tyme of thys present lyfe and whan we trauelyn sore to kepe goddes hestes tha~ we done our pylgrimage as the prophete sayth.
Lorde thy commaundementes weren my songes in tyme of my pylgrymage.
The seconde tyme we ben pylgrymes when we gone to the churche as it is wrytten.
Tu solus peregrinus es in Ierusalem, &c, whan we done in the churche in fourme as god hathe taught vs than we done our pylgrymage.
The thyrde tyme we ben pylgrymes when we vysyte the nedye and whan we delen almysdede we done our pylgrimage.
Go thou forthe anone into stretes and wayes and brynge in to thyne house these thre maner of people poore feble poore blynde poore lame.
The fourth tyme Prestes bene pylgrymes that studyen holye wryt tyll they haue plenty in theyr mynde
of this heuenly wysedome and than they hyen them fast about in all the brode worlde to dele this gostely treasour amonge the wyttles people that is in poynt to spyll for hunger in wantynge gostly teachyng as it is wrytten.
Dere frende thou doste ryghtfully what euer thou doste into our brethern and namely into pylgremes that prechen the gospell and bene apayde where they come with poore symple lyflode.
The fyfte tyme tho ben pylgrymmes that wonnen in a towne where is neyther preste ne lorde to teche them neyther to rule them and than they gone vnto the place where they may be taught and ruled vnder gouernaunce.
There is no other pylgrymage that maye please god out take this that we haue sayd and all holy wryt berythe wytnesse for whan the body is layde in graue and the soule forth passyth to blysse or to payne wether that it be than the syxte pylgremage is ended.
Thou shalt not take the name of thy god in vaine.
Forsoth say vnto you not to swere in any wyse neyther by heuen for it is the trone of god neyther by the erthe for it is the stole of his feete neyther by Ierusalem for it is the cyte of a greate kynge neyther by thyne heed for thou mayste not make a heare whyte or blacke forsothe be your worde ye ye and nay nay with herte and mouth accordyng agaynst this co~mau~deme~t
the deuyll in hys members constraynen men to swere and leyen there handes on bokes than he puttyth them to open shame and if they leue his byndyng he sayth by lawe they ben relapse and than they shalbe brent.
And thys is an hydeous clowde vpon this schynefull day to payne men for kepyng of goddes co~maundeme~tes.
Christ hath taught that thynge that is of more perfection that thyng that is of infyrmyte he hath suffred: that thynge that is superstycyous he hath cutte away it is of perfeccyon not to swere in any maner it is of infyrmyte for to swere constrayned but it is of superstycyon to swere vaynly.
Swerynge is no vertue but payne of synners eyther of the~ that wyll not gyue credens but yf men swere or elles of them that sweren withouten cause.
And therfore Crisostome blameth prestes for they bryngen forth bokes to compell men to swere vpon them askyth this question.
whether is not he that settyth an house on brenning gylty of this brennynge? whether is not he that bryngeth a swerde with yt which man slaughter is done gylty of this manslaughter? So they yt bryngen forth bokes on whiche me~ forsweren them ben gylty of this swerynge and he sayth.
Yf the people wyll saye the sothe without any othe wherto shulde they swere? And yf they supposen they wolde say false why shulde they be compelled to forswere them selfes? and the greatnes of synne standyth greatly and chyeftly
in suche ordynaryes eyther secler or spu~all as this doctour proueth nought exceptynge purgacion without such othes and of this sweryng cometh wyckednes and goddes greuous vengeance as the wyseman saythe.
Aman moche swerynge shalbe fulfylled with wickednes and vengeaunce shal not go from his house.
Yet enmyes pursuen agayne this co~mau~deme~t sayen that Christ him selfe swore his sayntes also.
Swere by this boke thou obstinate ma~ or elles thou shalt to pryson thou shalt swere in our courte bycause of thyne infyrmyte as saynctes hath taught when thou arte constrayned to thys we seyen that Ihu~ Christ forbedyth on al wyse sweryng by any of these .iiij. thynges yt he hym selfe reherseth that is to say heuen or erthe: Ierusalem or by thyne owne hed wha~ these foure ben out taken with al yt is in heuen ye shal not grou~de your vicious sweryng tyll that heuen befallen.
Thou shalt swere compelled we grau~ten wel a fore a iuge if elles me~ wyl not trowen vs but neyther on bokes shulde we swere neyther by goddes creatures but after the fourme that god hath taught by Ieremy ye {pro}hhete Ieremy. iiii.
The lorde lyueth is to mene by god or by thyne holy dome or by thy trouth.
The fyrst is trouth in the conscience of them that swerith without any gyle.
The seconde that it be done in dome to exclude al ma+ner
The thyrde that it be in ryghtwysnes and in no maner of deceyte ne hindrynge to our neybour ne dyscordyng to ye ryghtwysnes of god but we may in no cause swere by bokes as we haue sayde afore neyther by lyfely creatures as by sayntes or by any such other.
For the wiseman saith Custome not thou thy mouth to swere by names of sayntes for Chrisostome sayth.
He that sweryth by a creature doth ydolatry he that swereth by creatures synneth double folde ye though it war so that sweryng were leful ones for he swerith a nother tyme for he makytst him selfe a false god for what so euer it be that a ma~ sweryth by yt thyng he ma+keth his god lorde how mony me~ women ma+ken the~ false goddes sythen welnye all this worlde hath custome to swere by one saint or by another.
Certes these forsaid enemyes ben cause of this blasphemus sweryng what with theyr sclau~dres somtyme with their sore punysshing freyl people cannot stande but yelde them to this fe~des temptynges.
In six dayes thou shalt wyrche do all thyne owne werkes forsoth the seuenth day is the saboth of the lorde.
Thy son thy doughter thy seruau~t thyn hande mayden thy beest thy strau~ger yt is wtin thy gates.
In six dayes god made heue~ erthe the see al thynges yt ben in the~ he
Therfore god blyssed the day of the saboth and made it holy.
Agayne this commaundemente the fende in his members gyueth leue to chapeman to bye and sell.
And vytellers of the countre holden commen marketes yet se thou more what synnes a gaynste this hefte of god great fayres of the yere for the most parte ben sette on the saboth day by the fendes councell.
God toke full hydeous wreche vpon the chyldren of Israell when they wrought seruyle worke vpon the saboth daye as it is wryten.
Halowe ye my holyday forsothe it is holy to you who that hath defouled it he shalbe deed he yt doth any seruyle werke ther+in hys lyfe shall perysshe from the myddes of his people.
And so for gatherynge of styckes on the saboth day a man at goddes byddynge was stoned to the deth.
Therfore Nemias a ma~ that dreade god wyl suffre none to bye ne sell on the saboth day within the gates of Ierusalem ney ther aboute the walles and charged all vytellers that they shulde ceasse and yf they wolde not take hede they shulde fele his handes for he thought for to warre on them as on goddes enemyes but yf they wolde obey to god in halowyng of his saboth day.
This processe is wry+ten in the boke of Neemias in the laste chaptre.
Lo howe streytly the Iewes kepten goddes byd+dynge and god smote them with bodely payne wha~ they dyd forgete.
But chrysten men maken theyr bost howe they be more parfyte in seruyce
of theyr god then euer were the Iewes who that euer mekely proueth his worde in dede tha~ may he say boldely that this tyme of grace is of more parfeccyon by vertue of the sacrementes and fredome of the gospell than was Moyses lawe and thou a more parfyte man in kepynge this perfeccyon but thou be in apostatate in brekyng goddes heftes than is thy payne moch the more as paule sayd to the Romaynes Ro.
Forsothe thou standest in the fayth nyl thou be proude ne bere the neuer the hyer but abyde thou mekely in the holy drede of ye lorde.
Forsoth syth that the lord sparyd not ye kynde+ly or naturall braunches that is to say the Iewes that he chose to be his kyndely heyres beware leste be hap he spare not the that camest out of the hethen stocke and arte planted in by grace of Christ and of his gospell.
Se now thyne apostasy thou vnkynde wretche and the falsenesse that thou vsyst agaynst Christes gospel.
Iesu entred in to the tempell of god and he cast out all sellers and byers in the tempell and ye bordes of money makers and he tourned vpsydowne the chayres of them that solden doues and sayd vnto them as it is wryten.
Christe forbedyth the layte the vsynge of theyr marchandyse eyther in towne or in churche on the holydaye and he dampneth more streytly among these vicious prestes byenge of theyr benefyces and
sellynge of theyr sacrame~tes as ye doctour do sayth vpon the same gospell they ben sellers of doues that sellen spu~all thynges though they crye not with there mouthes neuerthelesse they sayen with Iudas.
what wyl ye geue and wyll betraye hym to you? Thus cryen our Monkes other bastarde religyon that sellen as they may take therfore: their habyte theyr suffrages and other prestes done also wyckedly that treten deuyne seruyce and suche ben nowe multiplyed in the church of god therfore where as thou wenest that the house of prayer is ther shalt thou redely fynde a denne of many theues.
Forsothe al that entren not by the dore that is Christ but by money or by seculer fauour: they ben nyght theues day theues that entre in by a broken wall vnwetynge Iesu Chryste for he proueth not theyr dedes and that is vnknowynge.
For that is the churche nowe all to broken downe whan the vnable is auaunced to the churche benefyce eyther for prayer eyther for pryce eyther for vndewe seruyce sythen our lorde Iesu Chryste sayde to his dyscyples that one of them was a deuyll and mente it by Iudas be not these apostates that done as yuel as he worthy to be clepyd deuylles by the same reason they be great questyoners askers of the lawe but they wolde not do so moche as put therto theyr fynger and they bepen charge on othere more than they may bere.
They bene prayfers of sayntes and nothynge theyr folowers they bene herers of the lawe but
nothyng the doers they bene alwaye lernyng and neuer wylbe parfyte.
Thus they bosten in the lawe with worshyp and with wynnynge but by brekynge of the lawe they done dyspyse theyr god.
worshyp thou thy fader and thy mother that thou mayste be longe lyuynge on the erthe the whiche the lorde god shal gyue to the and it sueth of thys commaundement that they that worshyppen not there parentes shullen haue shorte lyfe here in erthe and after the londe of myschyefe.
And therfore Thobye. taught hys sonne a lytle afore hys dyenge.
Sonne bery thou my bodye and thou shalt haue worshype to thy moder all the dayes of her lyfe.
Thou owest for to haue in mynde what parell and howe many she hathe suffred in her wombe for the.
Some counten it no synne to take from theyr parentes suche thynges as they haue bycause they bene theyr chyldren.
But certes thys synne passeth thefte and more it greuyth god as the wyseman saith.
Prouerb. xxviij. who that with+drawyth any thyng from his fader and moder and sayth it is no synne he is pertener of man slaughter for worshyp of our pare~tes standeth in worde and dede bothe to teche and to rule them yf they be lewde or poore and it longeth to these pare~tes to gouerne wel theyr children: ordeyne not only for the~ ye goodes of this world but moch rather dyspose theyr lyfe towarde the blisse of heuen as the wysema~ sayth prouerb.
xxiij. wyll thou withdrawe techynge from the chylde for though thou bete him with a yerde he shal not dye theron.
Thou betyst them with a belesse and thou shalt delyuer hys soule from hel he yt sparyth the yerde hatyth his chylde forsoth he that loueth them woll teche them besyly for a wyse chylde gladdeth the fader and afeltyd childe is ye sorow of his mother against this co~maundemet the fende with his me~bers what with ypocrytes that is fayned holynes what with blynde pyte that regnyth in the seclers he hath encombred Christes churche with moch worldly mucke and euer lad our mother with temporal possessions that she may not ryse to heuenly co~templacyon therfore theyr owne chyldren waxen wylde wanten and wyl ney+ther take awe ne lawe alas this is a greate sorowe but our father that is in heuen to whome nothynge is hyd seynge his sonnes so frowarde: is steryd all to wrathe though yt he abyde longe and differ his vengeaunce sufferynge from day to day yf that they wold amende for he forbade to prestes of the olde lawe to take such possession amonge other trybes but holde them payde of his parte for he wolde be theyr herytage for they shulde prynt thys lore and neuer go therfro.
Thre times it is rehersed though ones myght haue suffysed.
And Christ in his gospell twyse forbedyth his prestes to haue thys
And also in hys techynge that enemyes shulde not say who may lyue as Christ dyde? And neuertheles Gregory sayth.
Our lorde Ihu~ Christ somtyme with wordes somtyme with dedes techyth vs. Forsothe his dedes ben co~maundeme~tes for when he doth any thynge styl in that he maketh knowen to vs what we shall do and notwithstandynge that Christ forbedyth suche possessyons by worde to his prestes.
And if enemyes wil not accept god in his both lawes neyther obey to theyr father for his worde ne for his dede to whome heuen erth hell knelen on theyr knees but standen styll obstynate as yuel wyly traytours to clense theyr mother holy church owyth not to take of this foule corrup+cyo~.
Then shullen we ley forth holy sayntes yt speken of this matter and saye whether they wolde accorde to wordes that they haue sayde and so ryse vp to goddes worde by these sayntes.
The churche owyth not to take tho thynges that ben profered to her of hym that hathe none heyre.
Therfore who that euer wyll make the church his eyre seke he another that may take it but on no wise sayth Austen but by the mercy of god he shall fynde no man.
From ye tyme that the church grewe in possessions she hathe lessed or dwyned in vertues but Bernarde for+bedyth these possessyons to be in prestes handes
and spekyth vnto Eugeny the Pope in these wytty wordes.
Chalenge thou these possessions by a nother reason but thou may not chalenge them by the aposteles ryght.
Howe myght the apostele gyue that he had not? that he had he gaue besynes vpon churches no whether secler lordshyp? here what he saith neyther lor+dyng in ye clergy: but made in fourme to the profyte of the flocke and not only in mekenes trowe thou this to be sayd but also in trouth of dede.
Kynges of the erthe lorden ouer them forsothe ye not so.
It is playne to the aposteles that this lordshype is enterdyted howe darist thou than take thys lordshyp vpon yt eyther lordynge apostle hede eyther apostle hede to lordshyp? Playnly thou arte forbodden the one for yf thou wylt haue both thou shalt lese both yt is to say ye presthode thy lordshyp or elles thou shalt ben except of this nu~bre of ye which god pleyneth him.
They haue bene prynces but haue not knowen the~ nowe yf auayle to raygne without god than hast thou ioye but anemptyst god when prestes holden this enterdityng hear they then ye lordes crye he yt is more among you be ye made as ye youngers he yt is the forgoare be he made as the master.
Seculer lordshyp is forboden but ministryng seruyng is boden. wel we weten of beleue yt god his law bene euyn accordyng to gedre these with them than lay besides your poysons and
your hethen tales: with al other ma~geled lawes confirme you to god to clense ye church bryng it agayn to ye former estate lyue ye on christes parte ye lordes might haue ther lordship agayn.
But yet ye maken pursute with money greate showres sayen that saint Siluester toke this possession saynt Swithune saynt william with many other saintes.
To this we seyne that Siluester with such other folowers weren saintes.
To this we seyne in this talkynge of temporall possessyons as was Peter for sakynge Christ Paul pursuyng ye church of god.
Peter Paule dyd very penaunce suffreden deth for Christes sake yf these men dyd the same thus ben they very sayntes.
Exo. xx. Thou shalt not kyll or slee neyther in malice with pursuynge neyther in worde with backbytynge neyther with dede in vnlefull shedyng of bloude.

gloton hathe hys herte on hys wombe wanton man on hys lechery couetous man on hys wynnynge Any garde on his holdynge.
In all creatures that bene occupyed vnder heuen in mannes vanytees there is nothynge hyer than mannes herte there is nothynge founde lyker to god wherfore god sekyth nothynge of the but thyne herte.
Agaynste this commaundement the fende with his cautylles moueth dyscorde in ye hertes of them that bene wedded tyll the desyre haue departyd the one from the other.
Than the man fayneth a cause to go from the woman and in thys they ben accursed as the wyseman saythe Prouerb .xviij.
he sekyth occasyons that wol go awaye from his frendes at all tymes he shalbe acursed and worthy rebuke.
Neuertheles a fole wyll not receyue the wordes of techynge but yf thou say to hym such thynges as his hert desyreth and therfore he rennythe forthe in wodnes of his herte for to procure a diuorce betwene hym and his wyfe he comyth anone to the churche that is cleped lawles not for the churche but for the offycers for they ben lawles.
Anone he chusythe hym a notarye and payeth hym hys wages to make hym an instrumente of hys forged lesynges than goyth he to the maysters that sytten on theyr seates with furred hoodes and fonde heddes and gyuethe them money greate plentye and prayeth them to be his aduocates that thys dyuorce wer made for he wylbe redy at the lawles day to brynge forth his twelue handes afore the iuge
syr Symont and make good with all the courte that he hath no ryght to the woma~ that he wedded for dedes done afore than syr Simont geueth dome to dyssolue trewe wedlocke and authoryseth lechery to these bothe partyes for to lyue in horedome from that day forthwarde and sendythe them forthe at the dores departed eche fro other.
For matrymony a man shall leue father and mother and he shall holde him to his wyfe and they shalbe twayne in one flesshe that is for theyr dwellynge shalbe to geder.
Also they bene not than twayne but one flesshe that is by vertue of the sacrament wherfore that thynge that god hath ioyned ma~ may not departe.
say forsothe to you that who so euer hath lefte his wyfe excepte for the cause of fornycacyon and yf he wedde another he is a lecherour and who that weddyth this woman that this man hathe lefte he ledyth his lyfe in lechery as longe tyme as he holdeth her sythen that god ioyneth neuer but in lawefull maner how dare ye pursue this dyuorce in a lawles church? Saynt Paule sayth to the Romayns in ye seconde chapytre. whosoeuer synneth without lawe shal perisshe without the lawe.
For they weren blynde and knewe not the lawe they myght happely the easelyer be excusyd: but now they sayen they knowe the lawe and done full hardely agaynst the lawe they haue not excusacyon.
Be thou tourned from thyne owne wyll and obey thou to goddes wyll and than (sayth Bernarde) thou shalt neuer come in hel and therfore whyle thou arte hole and sounde~ wauer not aboute in thoughtes of dyuerse errours from god and from vertue.
Bryse downe not only such vnleful couetyse but also al super flue vnstable thoughtes and suffre them not on any wise to growe to dede ne to custome.
And thys semeth to be the sentence of the prophete where he sayth.
Blyssed is that man that shall holde and hyrt his youngelynges at the stone as the werkes of man bene his yongelynges or sonnes or doughters after the gostly sence so tho thoughtes of the inwarde man bene hys yongelynges.
Than he hyrtyth hys yongelynges at the stone of ryghtwysnes wha~ he dystroyeth theyr soden crepynges in thynkynge of the lyfe of our lorde Iesu Christe.
For soth this is a specyal remedy to with holde wicked thoughtes desyres and wylles that they flowe not to depely withinforth neyther that they flee to fer without forth and such traueyles thryuen tho yt god hath chosen: for they wyl not in any dysease be ouercome neyther co~sente to these cautyles of ye deuyl by which he enprysoneth goddes seruauntes for they kepen these .x. foresayd co~maundeme~tes but saynt Hyllary sayth.
This propartye hath Christes churche whan that it is pursued it floryssheth whan it is brysed downe it growyth: whan it is dyspysed it profyteth whan it is hurte it ouercommyth
whan it is blamed it shyneth and then it sta~deth most strongly whan it semyth in mannes eye to be ouercommen.
Thys churche is a trewe soule as we haue sayde afore some that ben tendre feble for to suffre cryen with abachuc and sayen to god.
Lorde howe longe shal crye and thou shalt not here me? Lorde tyll whan shall call vpon the thus suffrynge stronge trybulacyon and thou shalt not make me saufe? why haste thou shewed me wyckednes and traueyle and suffrest thefte agaynste me and vnryghtwysnesse? why beholdeste thou these dyspysers and arte styll? the wycked man defoulynge him yt iuster than he? Saynte Ierome saythe in hys prologe that these bene the wordes of mannes impacyence and settyth an ensample of a sycke man swellynge in the feuers and askynge colde water sayenge to hys leche suffre wo am all to tourmentyd am full nye dede howe longe shall crye (leche) and thou shalt not here me? The wytty and the moste mercyfull leche answeryth to him wote in what tyme it behouith me to gyue to the that thou askyst haue no ruthe on the nowe for thys mercy were cruelty and thyne owne wyl makyth agaynst the.
Also our lorde god knowynge the weyght and the measure of hys mercye sometyme he heryth not the cryer anone that he maye proue and more stere hym to praye and as examyned
by the fyre that he maye make hys seruaunte bothe iuster and purer to receyue grace and mede. →: {trefoil}: ¶What is the fendes church with her propertyes.
TO speke of the thyrde churhe enpropryed to the deuyll the whiche is the nombre of them that bene encombryd to serue hym after hys tysynge agaynst goddes hestes.
Fyrste we shall take our grounde of ye prophete Psalmo.
These bene they that strayen away after theyr owne desyers walkynge in the waye that ledyth them to hell neyther they wylbe gouerned by law ne by grace neyther they wyl for drede ne loue cesse and go from synne by+cause thys worlde is full of lustes and proferryth hys louers a ioye sone passynge but they that traueylen after blysse here they suffren payne therfore fooles withouten nombre ioyen with thys worlde as Chryste saythe in hys gospell.
Entre ye by the strayte gate for large is the gate and brode is the waye that ledythe to dampnacyon and many entren therin.
the gate and streyt is the way that ledyth to lyfe and fewe theyr bene that fynden it: For saynt Iohan sayth.
All the worlde that is all tho me~ and women that ben ouercome with this worlde ben set in malyce that is brennyng in the fyre of foule couetyse for all thyng that is in this worlde eyther it is ye couetyse of eyen other elles it is the couetyse of the flesshe or elles it is the pryde of thys lyfe and therfore thys churche is grounded vpon the deuyl in the grauel of false couetyse.
The roote of all euylles is couetyse the which some desyrynge haue erryd from trewe byleue and haue ioyned them selfe to many sorowes the rerynge vp of this church is in glotony and lechery as the wyseman sayth rehersyng the wordes of them that shalbe dampned.
Go we (saye the fendes lymmes) fyll vs with precyous wyne and oyntementes and suffre we not the flowre of our fayre bewty to passe awaye from vs crowne we vs: with rosys of iolyte or that they walken away there may be no medowe but yf our lechery passe therby none of vs may be lotles of our lechery euery where leue we tokyns of our gladnesse.
The helynge of thys churche is pryde and hyenes of life as the pro+phete sayth.
haue seen the vnpetyous the wycked man enhaunsed vp lyfted as the cedres trees of Lyban and they bene the hyest trees of the worlde but as smoke ryseth sodynly and sone vanyssheth to nought so they proude ben praysed for a tyme and than they
fallen away and we weten not wher they become of the busynes and occupacion that dwellers of this church vsen spekyth the prophete.
Nyght day wyckednesse shal compasse aboute thys churche vpon theyr walles and trauayle in myddes of it and vnryghtwysnes Okyr.
Iuglynge and Trechery hath not stynted in the wayes of her.
Of thys church with his maner of buyldyng spekyth Christe in his gospell.
who that heryth my wordes and dothe them not is lyke a folysh man that hath buylde his house vpon the grauell of couetyse and mysbeleue and rayne of glotony and lechery came downe on this churche and ferly thys forsayd synnes fallen in to this church and dryuen it downe and the fall of her was great: for she fell from grace and glory to payne mischefe without ende as saynt Austen sayth.
For soth that is not the body of the lorde that shall not be with him withouten ende for ypocrytes ben not sayde to be with hym though they bene seen to be in his church.
Certes the deuyl is hed of all wycked whiche ben on some maner hys body to go with them in to ye tourment of euerlastynge fyre for whan they token baptysme they hyghten fayth trouth to kepe goddes co~maundementes as the {pro}phete saythe spekynge in the parson of the generall churche Psal.
Lorde haue sworne and ordeyned to kepe thy commaundementes and vpon this couenaunt Christe toke him to his mariage with the ryng of stedfast fayth he sacred the holy spousayle
but nowe they leue this chast loue our lord Ih Chryste in brekynge of this couenaunt and haue chosen an hore mayster the fende that is a spouse breker and lyggeth in auoutre with her like spoyles.
Forsothe euery soule it is Chrystes spouse or elles it is an aduoulteresse of ye deuyl for Christ and the deuyll may in nowise rest to geder in the bed of mannes soule for they ben so contrary that what so euer the one byddyth that the other forbyddeth.
Christ sekyth saluacion the fende dampnacyon Christe loueth vertue the fende loueth synne Christ gatheryth to geder and the fende scateryth abrode.
what pertycypacion is ther of ryght wysnes with wyckednes? what felowshyp is there of lyght with darkenes? what co~munyon is there of Christ with bely al? or what parte is ther of a faithful ma~: with an vnfaythful ma~? or what co~sent of ye temple of idoles with ye church of god? Certes none for eche of these agayne sayen other after there owne wyrchyng.
Nowe shall we tell what they ben that dwellen with the fende for to serue him in hys church that is the temple of idoles. waryours cursers chyders sclaunders and blasphemers ther bene vylayne spekers lyars glosers backbyters mottrars swerars and forswerars there ben also mychers robbers extorcyoners tyrantes and oppressers there ben vntrwe tyllers vnfaythfull seruauntes rechelesse hyred men rebell dyscyples and vnprofytable

There ben all tho men that bosen ther brestes pynchen theyr belyes partyn ther hosys: crakowyn there shoys: al disguysers of theyr garnamentes.
There ben tho that sterchen or poppen theyr faces that brydelen ther hedes with gyg halters yt setten aboue honykombes with moche other atyrynge to make them selfe sale kene to synne and setten abrode there pappes to catche men with theyr lymes yardes.
There ben false lawe makers goddes lawe haters offynders of customes distroyers of vertue and auctours of syn in this churche also bene mawmotres heretykes idolatrers sortylegers enchau~tours arriolers charmours rerers of the deuyl al tho yt trowen yt helpe may come of vsynge godes worde that we clepyn writtes only hangyd or borne on ma~: or yt they ben medycynable to body or soule so honged or so borne there ben marchau~des chapmen vytellers: vynteners tauerners: chau~gers byers: sellers yt vsen dysceyte: in weyght nombre or measure there bene in this church vsurers okerers: iuryours quest mongers and all false wytnes berers there ben

Thys churche whan it is beten it waxeth harder whan it is blamyd it waxeth the duller whan it is taught it is ye lewder whan it is done well to it is the shrew+der and than it fallyth downe and cometh to nought whan it semeth in mannes eye moste stronge to stande saynt Austen saythe.
Chrystes church pursueth yuell lyuers in charyte by way of amendement.
But the fendes churche pursueth the church of Chryste in malyce by way of sclaunder and sleynge and thys cayme that false enuyous man slewe his brother Abell that blyssed and symple innocent man as the fyfty expositours sayen in a prologe on this Psalme.
That Cayme was the begynnynge of Babylon and Antechryste shalbe the ende and Abell was the begynnynge of Ierusalem and Chryste shalbe the ender.
Forsoth Ismael pursued Isaac but not so Isaac Ismaell Esau pursued Iacob but not so blyssed Iacob cursed Esau for by counsell of hys moder he fled in to Mesopony from the wrathe of hys brother tyll that it was swaged.
Thus our moder holye churche counseyleth her chyldren to fle from the malyce of the fendes church tyll that it be slaked.
Forsoth yf the fendes churche shall pursue you in thys cytee
flee ye tyll another but thys must be done by dyscrecyon for hurtynge of our brothers conscyens.
Chryste pursued not the Iewes but the Iewes Iesu Chryste hethen men slewe the apostelles but not the apostelles hethen men se nowe frowardnes of thys worlde that hathe bene from the begynnynge. whan Isaye the holy prophete prophecyed and preched vnto the people they wolde not here is wordes ne suffren hym on lyue but the people that rysen after hys dethe radde hys bokes and sayden yf we hadden lyued in hys dayes he shulde not haue bene dede and yet they slewen Ieremye that with the spyryte of god tolde thynges to come and taught them very trouth his successours token hys bokes and radde them in there temples and hym for an holye man but they slewen Ezechyel and other mo than the Iewes maden fayre the tombes of these prophetes as were scrybes and pharyses and sayd in ypocrysy yf they had ben in their dayes they shulde not haue ben slayne but they gaue the counsell that Christ shulde be deed the hed of all sayntes with most dyspytyous deth.
The fendes churche in these dayes praysen aboue the clowdes Chryste and his holy sayntes with wordes and with sygnes but they pursuen to the deth the louers of hys lawe.
Ryght as ye done nowe so dyd your fathers to the prophetes in theyr dayes.
And therfore wo to you hell houndes for Chryste sayth in thys worlde ye ben ryche
fatte fed laughynge in pursuynge of eche other wepe ye and make ye sorowe for your payne is moche in hell.
these shall haue a dredefull day whan they be arrayned at the barre of iudgemente whan Chryste shall rere vp hys crosse the baner of hys passyon.
The great day of the lorde is nygh and fast besyde and hyeth towarde wounders faste it shall not longe tary in that day shalbe troubled he that is strong and myghty for the voyce of the lorde is bytterful to the dampned.
That day is a day of wrath a day of trybulacion.
That day is a day of hungre and ire of extremyte and wretchydnes That day is a daye of darkenes and of thycke smoke.
That is the day of the trumpe and of hydeous noyse for than they shall se theyr iudge aboue them styrred to wrathe than shall they se hell open bynethe them and aungelles on the ryghtsyde hastynge them to hell sayntes approuynge goddes dome and all the worlde accusynge and theyr owne conscyens as opyn as a boke in the whiche they shall rede theyr owne dampnacyon.
These wretches beholdynge the greate glory of them that they dyspysed in thys worlde than shall they saye these wordes.
These bene they whome we some tyme had in scorne and in hate and derisyon we wytles dampned hell houndes beleuyd that theyr lyfe had bene woodnes and madnes and supposyd that theyr ende had ben without worship howe nowe they ben counted
among the sonnes of god and they taken theyr lotte amonge his sayntes therfore we haue erred from the way of trouthe and the lyght of ryghtwysenesse lyghted not to vs we bene wery of the waye of wyckednes and dampnacyon what profyte hathe our pryde done to vs? or great auaunte or bost of rychesse what hath it gyuen to vs? all tho thynges bene passed from vs as a shadowe.
Than the iudge shall saye vnto them with a sterne chere.
Go ye awaye from me ye cursed lymmes into the fyre of hell euerlastynge that is ordeyned to the deuyll and hys aungelles.
Than may the soule saye to the bodye these wordes.
Come on thou cursed careyne come and go with me am compelled to come agayne to the that we may go to geder eyther to others shame to take our ioyes as we haue deseruyd payne for euermore.
That thynge that we loued nowe it is gone from vs and all that we hated is come vpon vs nowe is ioye tourned into sorowe and our myrthe into wepynge nowe is our laughter tourned into mournynge and all our game into weylynge nothynge abydeth to vs but fyre hote brennynge water colde chyllynge wormes and edders toodes and snakes euer gnawyng euer dyenge and neuer dede darkenes palpable (that is so thycke that it may be felte) wantyng the syght of all comeforte seynge al thyng that may dyscomforte fyre intollerable drede vntellable qua+king of ye fendes felowship alway discorde wont

Turne the agayne turne the agayne: thou synnefull soule: turne the agayne tourne agayne that we may beholde the forsothe god knowyth thy mysgouernaunce and wyll not forsake the yf thou wylt turne agayne as he sayth by the prophete Ieremye forsothe thou haste do fornycacyon with many louers neuer+theles tourne thou to me saythe the lorde and shall receyue the and take the to grace.
In thys god showith howe moche he louyth vs for whan we forsaken hym he forsakyth not vs.

And thus saythe kynge Dauyd to Abner. whan Abner had sende messengers to kynge Dauyd to entreate hym of fryndshyp kynge Dauyd answered to the messangers as spoken vnto Abner wyll gladly make frendshype with the but this one thyng tell the forsoth thou shalt not se my face tyll thou shalt brynge with the Michol and so commyng thou shalt se

And Mychol is to say whan it is declared the water of all than is this thus to mene ye that desyren in all your herte to fynde and haue the mercy of god and se his gra+cyous face in blysse ye must haue water of very penaunce from your herte with ful contrycyon of wyll neuer to tourne to syn yf that ye wol be true no more breke this couenaunt: god wol not that ye be dede but ye ye haue euerlastyng lyfe.

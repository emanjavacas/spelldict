SWEETLY INDEVORING WITH HIS blunt persuasions to botch vp a Reconciliation between and
Compiled by lawfull art, that is to say, without witch craft, or sorcery: and referred specially to the Meridian and pole Artichocke of Nomans Land: but may serue generally without any great error, for more Countries then Ile speake of.

TO THE NEW MARTIN, AND THE MISBEGOTTEN HEIRES OF HIS body: his ouerthwart neighbor, and so foorth following the as farre as Will Solnes stuttring pronunciation may stumble ouer at a breath: To all Whip Iohns, and Whip Iackes: not forgetting the Caualiero Pasquill, or the Cooke Russian, that drest a dish for Martins diet, Marforius and all Cutting Hussnufs, Roisters, and the residew of light singred younkers, which make euery word a blow, and euery booke a bobbe: Perceuall the of England, wisheth grace to the one party, of the other Parish: and peace stichd vp in a Gaberdine without pleat or wrinckle, to the other party of this Parish.
Would it had bin PERCEVALS hap, to haue com to the beginning of a friendly feast, or to the latter ending of so dangerous a fraye.
And thought had bin faire for it at the first: for plodding through Aldersgate, all armed as was, with a quarter Ashe staffe on my shoulder, and an emptie belly vnder my northern belt, spied me, a large P. with a wide mouth like a porradge pott, and being quicksented thrust forward on the trale, and found it was Papp.
But cannot tell, what the goodere came into my minde, but somewhat it was, that persuaded me to trie before tasted, and looke before licked: And though my would haue straight fell into acquaintance, by reason of some auncient familiaritie betweene a western fellow, and a whitpot: yet bearing a braine as well as a belly, stood sauntring ouer it, like a whelp that had scalded his mouth with lapping vp hotte water Grewell: till found that it was no meat indeed for PERCEVALL, but rather a bone for MARTIN to digest, if his stomach wold serue him: for though the first ladlefull had a smacke as soft as pap, the next morsell, a taste as sweet as a fig, and so forth: yet see he that was Cooke and Cater, thought to feed MARTIN with these nunchio~s, as men feed Apes: with a bit a boxe on the eare.
Why but soft maisters, faire plaie and no snatching: is your feasting turned to a fray? put vp, put vp your weapons, and be some wiser then some.
They were neuer tall fellows of their hands that were such hacksters in the street: nor euer prooued old wringers indeed, that sell out at their belly mettall.
Go to MARTIN, go to: know a man is a man, though he haue but a hose on his head (& thou hast a close house on thine) but the greatest quarrellers meet often with their
Putcase thou hadst a good cause (as alas am a plaine fellow and not giuen to swearing) yet a couple of these late Roysters would marre ten MARTINS, at the cracking of a stage Iest.
They haue plaguy Clubfists, the one with his the other with his Country Cuffe, would quickly make a blew MARTIN.
And you on the other side: what neede all this stir? this banding of kilcowes to fight with a shadow? If were at home, within the precinctes of mine owne domination, would charge you in Gods name and the Queens, to put vp your whinyards, you are men inough, able to deale one to one at handigripes, come cut and long taile: why should you offer to take the adua~tage of the higher ground? Truly, truly, will present you at the law day for a ryot, though be neither side man for this Meridian, nor Warden, but to ward my selfe as walke.
There is more danger in breaking the Queenes Maiesties peace, then you are aware of.
That mad companion MARTIN, you know, plaies least in sight, and serues you, as Aeneas serued Turnus, to make him fight with a mist in steed of a man: he doth but send his picture, to make triall of your affection towards him, as (my boy at home saies) Heliogabalus did, to search the humors of the Roman Senate.
If you had vsed his Image somwhat more gentlie, within this space, hee would haue appeared in his likenes, incarnated or incased in some knaues skin or other warrant you: beare with one grosse terme, so as make no custome of it.
Come on therfore MARTIN and the rest, house your selues in the next Tauerne, will set my selfe (not a knaue betweene two honest men) but as a good fellow, betwixt the shadow of MARTIN, and the naturall shape of your selues, to trie whether can stint this, Hold my dagger from your throat, or no.
Yours if you like me: mine owne if you strike me.
P. P. P. HE was a tender harted fellow, though his luck were but hard, which hasting to take vp a quarrell, by the high way side, betwéen a brace, of Saint Nicholas Clargie men: was so curteously imbraced on both parties, thas he tendered his purse for their truce, and swapt away his siluer for Copper retaile.
Such copsmates would be examined, if it were but for Alcumist: such a kind hart Chronicled, if it were but for a foole.
All this wind shakes none of my Corne, quoth Perceuall, whereupon Gossip Reason the chiefe actor in the pageant of my braine, and high speaker in the Parlament of my deuise, began this motherly, and well powdered tale.
The medling Ape, that like a tall wood cleauer, assaying to rend a twopenny billet in two péeces, did wedge in his pettitoes, so fast, betwéen the two clefts, that he stucke by the féete for a saie: and remained foorth comming at the discretion of those, whose occupation he enchrochd vpon before he was frée: Short though were his prentiship, did he not pay for his learning? Tush Perceuall, hath no felicitie in these captious Intergatories.
And therefore good swéete Tenant Reason, speake plainely, and say Landlord mine (giue euery man his right) he that thrusts his finger betwéen the barke and the trée, is like to be pinched: Counterfet Martin, or Counter Martin, let them fight or be frinds, with a knaues name: encounter not them, they be like Gins, they carry fier in their harts, and death in their mouths.
If they get thée within their reach: thou must come to knokham faire, and what bewtéene the block the béetle, be thumpd like a stockfish, now gandmer are not these your examples moralized? Pithy stufe to kéepe a man from crossing the bowling Alley, for feare of a broken shin.
Or it moues me as much as the fatherly rebuke of an old stander, moude that vniuersity post, which séemed to take the wall of a Senior.
cannot though you should bind me to such a stubborn post, as that graue student met with in the darke, but carry one bucket of water, when heare the bels ring backward, and the fire runne forward.
They were in a fault, where the fire first began': but first and last, helpe, quench all; or else these high flying sparks will light on the heads of vs all, and kindle in our bedstraw, if other folkes lodging be no better then mine.
Well fare London yet, for a policie besides water (which they put in practise too lately, the more was the pitty:) pull downe the houses burning, lest they catch hold on their neighbors.
That tricke would aske a long pole and a hoke, and my quarter stafe is too short, except a man stood on tiptoe.
But now remember my selfe, neuer will ouerstraine my strength, nor play at hand ouer head so high, but where may féele sure footing.
Giue me my spectacles, that may sée whether dreame, or whether these sights be all in good sadnes, which behold, sometime these madcaps be at a fray: sometimes at a feast: it makes no matter whether it be plaine dealing or iugling, take them at the best, and sit downe to their banket.
And sith Martin and his brood hath furnished the first course, with sundry dishes, saweed them throughly: and againe his heauie frinds Pasquill, Marforius, and the fresh Cater of late, haue counter coursd him, with messes somewhat hoat of the spice: (for the Pay had corns of long Pepper as big as a hatchet:) follow like a plaine dunstable Groome, with salt and spoones on a trencher.
Indéede you say true, Sal sapit omnia: and seruice without salt, by the rite of England, is a Cuckholds sée, if he claime it.
Go to then, and take salt to your soppes, least sorrow attaint them.
Make brine for your bull biefe, that it may sucke out those swelling corrupt affections that remaine some what rancke in the flesh.
As for my spoons, those brought, that my companions might haue one slap at the Spoone meat, wherein Martin boasted his Cookery: and the other set out their skill.
They had néede be large long Spoons (say you) if come to féed with such whipsters.
Let me alone, for my actiuity, at the dish meat, and a long arme, though my scoope be the shorter.
Perceuall, you are somewhat a mery man, as well as the rest, according to your homely Countrey fashion.
Mary sir, there is somewhat in it beside true working, and a Gods name, quoth the that checkt his wife, for hopping about the house, and telling what the schollers of Oxford paid for their good cheare: when he no sooner stept ouer the threshold, but fell into the same tune and taking; and about they went.
My Masters be ware of Martins circle, for if his frinds or his foes chop into it vnawares, they are like to daunce after his pipe, and set themselues vpon a miry pinne, (for so doth he) till his vnderpinning will faile him, doubt.
Come on Martin, put out (as the passenger said to the Miller) not a knaues head, no kéepe in, thou art wiser then so, yet if wind doe not faile thée, thy late Customers, which play more sacks to the mill, haue brought greists or iests at least wise to be ground.
If thy mill stones be not worne too blunt, for want of pecking, there is picking meat for thée: make meale of it, and take large tole to the enriching of the Tolbot thou talkest off.
Martin me thinks the clacke of thy mill, is somewhat noisome to the whole countrey, thou liuest in; either thou art well set en worke, or else, thou hast wind at will to thy sailes.
pray thée make once an auricular confession, tell me in mine eare: is the desire of Reformation so déeply imprinted in thine hart, as the terme is often printed in thy papers? Is it conscience or lucre, that spurgals thy hackney pen, to force it take so high a hedge, as thou leapest at? haue séene as mad a trick as this, when a Rancke rider hath put his horse to a hedge, and lay in the ditch for his labor.
Thy foming mealy mouth betokeneth stomacke, and yoong vnbridled fits, for all that fatherly countenance, graue vizard which sometimes thou vsest to plead the cause of thy Reformation vnder.
No no, you vse the nostrils too much, and to many vnseasoned frumps, to come of that raze, that sincerely in time of superstition required Reformation.
Whow? go about to disgrace thée? No no come but by the way of intreaty, as it were with a becke to admonish thée, that thou putst the wrong foote before, and therefore pull backe.
Yet beare with me, if doubt whether all be gold that glistereth, sith Saint Martins rings be but Copper within, though they be gilt without, sayes the Goldsmith.
Idle termes came neuer from Saint Paul, nor reprochfull taunts from Michaell: yet S. Paul, no doubt, was mery in his daies: and the Archangell, you know, was at controuersie with the Diuell.
Here againe whow? nay if trot so heauily, am neither for Martins riding, nor these thrée new mery mens reading.
Gape Martin that may sée thy age, but take héed, thou bite me not: thought so: the marke is not out of thy mouth, for thou hast a Colts tooth in thine head still: if thou wilt haue it drawne by fowle means, these Roisters haue béetles to knocke it out: if gently, let me be thy tooth drawer, haue a kind hart of mine owne, and that name hath béen good at such a practise heretofore.
Take héede Martin, a horse may ouer reach in a true pace, and thou play the foole though thou shouldst haue a good matter in hand.
As for my part, come not to take any part, am none of those, which loue fending and proouing, if can part you but for the time present, am at my Iourneies end.
Let the higher officers examine the cause, and find the fault (if al be true thou talkest of) where it is: yet (as a wel bearded Poet taught a Quéene to speake in a Latine Enterlude) Etsi causa repetentis bona, Mala sic perentis est.
Out vpon thée Perceuall, what gibberish is that? what, what, latine in the mouth of a plaine fellow? Nay wot néere, but it hath left behind it a wale in my throate like a strange bodylouse in an vnknowne pasture.
Wel Martin, Sustine pronunc, stand by a trice, but looke you depart not the court, in paine of mine Indignation.
Thou shalt perceiue that like a good sempster, can cut euen by a thréed, and part this quarrell without partiality.
If vse indifferency, call me not Iohn Indifferent now, for my good will: or if lay my helping hand, to the cure of such a broile, without breach of peace, or danger of riot; say not thou as an olde Pasquill said being in a traunce of that famouse and modest Clarke Erasmus, that hang houering in the mid way betwixt heauen and hell: He no doubt, misused, for fancie sake the memory of a good man deceased: and thou in so saying shouldst mistake the good meaning of one wel Disposed.
Stand by say, till thy turne comes about againe, Now, my Countrey men on the other part, make your appearance, thinke not skorne that Perceuall, is somewhat in your tops, my sirname is one that is but poorely regarded in England, bicause Peace hath béen long plentifull: but yet one that may speake with some authority, as long as our most roiall holds the sterne (which God grant long she may.)
That faire, and fairest flower, in our garland, if she should faile: then were it high time for Perceuall and all to put vp their pipes, or else in stéed of the soft violine, learne to sound a shrill trumpet.
Well then, let a poore mans tale be hard amongst you.
Martin is the man and the marke you shoot your forked arrowes at: if you strike his face, you can raise no skin, for his forhead is brasse: nor fetch vp his blood, bicause he is giuen to blush no more the~ my black dog at home: welfare a faire face vpon an ill paire of shoulders yet: if you pearce his hart, you can doo him little harme, for he is liude like a Cat: strike his toong, the biternes of the same, will trace out the Author of the wound, like the fish Torpedo, which being towchd, sends her venime alongst line and angle rod, till it cease on the finger, and so mar a fisher for euer.
Fie, fie, will you vpon a spléen, run vpon a Christen body, with full cry and open mouth? Though indéed cannot blame you, sith his procéedings were so vnchristianlike, if you tooke him for a Monster, or a Maddog: and so went about to worme him: but am afraide such a carelesse curre, is cureles: wormeséede and reasons will doo him no good: and for other remedies that might come by insicion, his wormeaten Co~science refuseth, (as Dionysius did the hands of his Barbar, for feare lest mistaking his beard, he would haue cut his throat) and therefore kéeps him out of your Clutches.
Yt were good to kéepe such a Cur in awe, but alas hurt him not, for a dogs mouth is medicineable, (they say:) Verum est, if he bite not where he should licke, am answered.
But here is such likening Christianfolks to dogs; that cannot away with it.
Shall we haue neighbors children, lie skufling in the kennel together by the eares like bride well birds? it is as good as a beare bayting for them, which loue neither, to sée either Nouze other so bedlemlike.
Neuer a beadle sturring? nor at hand to put his staffe in the mouth of the beare, or pull off these dogs? This will proue foule play: whosoeuer get the victorie, Seu vincas, seu vincêris, maculêre necesse est si: the rest was at my fingers end: but fare well it, since it is gone: Beare with my shittle remembrance.
doe not thinke, though Martin and you be of diuerse Parishes, but you be all of one Church, saile all in one ship, and dwell all in one
Nay you are all good subiects, or else would the woorst were curbd with a checkthong, as bigge as a towpenny halter, for halting with a Queene so good and gratious.
All this hart burning betwéene you, is but about the bounds of the Parish, and the limits of the Church lands.
Let the yoouth be content to be infourmed of the Mearstones, by the Auncientry of the Parish: and not continew such bustling, backbiting, with facing defacing one another to the vttermost: this is Spight, and not Spirit, or if it be, it is some spightfull Spirit.
It were enough to entitle those Browne sectaries of the Blacke Prince, with the name of traytors, and not to cast them like squibs wild fire within your owne hatches, and the body of your owne
Mary who began (say you:) Martin cald traytor first, he spake lauishly, and must heare as knauishly.
Now the blood is vp; he that hath most gall in his garbage, thinks to win the goale.
And he that hath most toong powder hopes to driue the other out of the field first.
could tell these eager younsters, how they might be euen with their Aduersary: giue faire words for foule: Doe good against euill: and heape hoat burning coales vpon his head.
That is a sentence sooner belieud bicause it is scripture, then put in practise, for all it is true.
Such a Deane, such a Doctor, slips within the compasse of treason cries Martin.
Another, takes him by the nose with a paire of pincers, and puls him ouer the pumpes into the same puddle.
Wot you what the little wagges saide, when they had béene telling many precious miracles of and the diuell? We shall speake so long of the diuell in iest, that he shall come amongst vs in good earnest: God warrant vs, and therewithall, crost themselues, for it was in the old time: would we could blesse vs from him, this newe time.
But am afraid, there will be so much talke of traitor, so long vse of such bugs words, that some of our Hussnuffs, and Marprelats will prooue their words master, yet will no bodie: am none of these tuft mockadoo for Qui mocchat, moccabitur, quoth the seruingman of Abington.
And, as who shoulde say, they that named Rebels oftenest with a breath, were the soundest winded subiects: who can tell that? Not I: but sure am, that the boy which gréeted his father with a letter clapt full of commendations, commendations, and nothing but commendations, prooude as untoward a sonne, as he that directed his superscription to his most obedient parents.
If Menippus, or the Man in the Moone, be so that he beholds, these bitter swéete Iests, these railing outcries: this shouing at Prelats to cast them downe, and heauing at Martin to hang him vp for Martilmas biefe: what would he imagine otherwise, then as that stranger, which séeing a Quintessence (beside the foole the Maid Marian) of all the picked yoouth, straind out of an whole Endship, footing the Morris about a May pole.
And he, not hearing the crie of the bounds, for the barking of dogs, (that is to say) the minstrelsie for the fidling, the tune for the sound, nor the pipe for the noise of the tabor, bluntly demaunded, if they were not all beside themselues, that they so lipd and skipd without an occasion.
Backe with that leg Perceuall: Nouice as thou art, dost thou thinke that we are some, all mad? Alas am a stranger, cannot tel what your horse play meanes.
Learne, learne to vnderstand the occasion of those actions: Their words are common? for euery vseth them at the Old Bayly, that hath had any skill in his miniken Handsaw.
can tell who was acquainted with an olde sooker, that caries such Potticall verses of the State of Flanders, in a linnen bag (though they be no baggage neither) as would make a man thinke vpon driuing out sides, and taking of parts as long as he liues.
My selfe drinking hand to hand with the founder of them: for lacke of a nutmeg, he gaue me a great and a lesse, to grate in a spice bole, and this was the powder.
Orgia turbantem natum dum mactat Agaue, Insana, insanum Penthea, credit aprimi.
Had not he a long wind that sowpd vp these two at a draught? and a good head that carried them away without staggering, togither with their Appurtenances? Mad was the mother kild hir wood sonne, &c.
That liquid Poet, had askt himselfe the question, who was in the fault, that two factions were at daggers drawing, till they were like to draw all to an vprore, he answers like a slie slaue; Ambo. for that was his meaning, though he whéeld about, séeking to declare his mind, with a Far Fetched Simile.
But (say you) there is no reason in it, that we should stand bound to the good crcept Martin were bound to the peace.
Yf he snarle like a cur at vs, why should not we prouide a Bastinado for him? and he making an assault, to mount ouer our parke pales: why may not we haue one cast in his Orchard, and a fling at his Medlar trée? Mary sirs, for feare the Cudgell fall downe againe vpon a mans owne Costard.
If a swift running streame haue frée passage along the kennell, fare well it, you shall neuer heare worse of it: but stop it, Hercules like where it finds no way, it will make one: and so set the next neighbors medowes all on a floate.
When he began to skold first, you should haue betooke him to an Ostler, to walke, while you had cald an officer to chamber his toong.
So if you had done, his owne poison would haue festered in his owne flesh.
Prid and venime, if they had so ranckly possessed his hart, they would haue set his owne skin a strute, and burst his hide before this time.
sée the vaine is vp in the forhead, and Martin shall haue as good as he brings, or else a frée schoole of skolds shalbe set vp for the nonce.
that M. Th. Cicero might rise againe, a little before his turne, sée railing made a profession, Slaunder set in a Shrine, and honored with the slaughter of many ripe wits, in stéed of a sacrifice: how would he blame England now, (as he blamed Athens when he liude) for erecting Chappels in honor of that dishonorable cowple: Reproch and Impudency: or as he checkd his Countrey men the Romans, which had builded an altar to the Agewe, and a monument to the remembrance of Cursed Fortune.
cannot tell what Spirituall Chappels, and Inuisible altars our men set vp now a daies, but am sure, one of the Largest Churches in England is like to fall on his maribons, and so mar the fashion of his bones, that it may be cald Allstones here after.
Had Martin walkd that way he might haue espide a great hole a miserable maime in the body of that Church.
It is an ill wind that blowes no man to good they say: yea but the Prophet Aggeus would haue giuen counsaile to repaire such a place of praier: if Martin himselfe crie Hauocke at it, beléeue him not, Aggeus was a great deale the honester man, although while he liude he was no saint.
Where was I? my iourney lies not that way: was about to say that the Printers had hard luck if they lost by these matches that are made of late against Martin.
Whose states when looke vpon, am ready to crie at as a Countrey man of mine did, when trauersing London stréets, he spide a Iacke an apes, in a gaie cote, sit mooing on a Marchants bulke: Good Lord what knacks are made for money, now adaies? Speake a blooddy word in a Barbors shop, you make a forset: and good reason too, Cap him sirra, if he pay it not.
Speake a broad word or vse a grosse tearme amongst huntsmen in chaze, you shall be leasht for your labor: as one that disgraceth a gentlemans pastime and game, with the termes of a heardsman.
And is there no penaltie to represse such lauish ouer reachers as offer legends of lies to the presse? Martin, he put those lies into print vnlawfully, which he coind in hugger mugger: others opposite to his humor will haue their lies lie open manifestly, if it be but to shew that they dare put in for the whetstone, and make as lowd lies as Martin the forman.
But who is the father of such fruit, or the sower of such séede? False witnes, lying was forbode by Moses Law, but is taken vp now for a custome, of one lewd Customer, and hath got Chapmen that will neuer lay it downe, except they make their end as tedious to the indifferent Reader, as his beginning was odtous to the peaceable hearer.
He that catcheth euery flying tale by the end, may chance to take a frog for a fish, and doo as the boy, that bit a snake by the head instéed of an éele. Heresay is too slender an euidence to spit a mans credit vpon, or to broach a mans Conscience with kitchin termes or any thing, nothing comes amisse to Perceuall.
sée neighbors how you croud backward, thinking belike to ride vpon my Crupshoulders: am no Ape Carrier, pray you defile not my shéeps russet Coate, with your dirtie shoes yet: this home made Karsey, and my plain spéeches may haue as much wooll (I dare not say so much wit) as is in your double pild veluet.
Blessed are the (I say:) so are neither the bréeders nor fauourites of discord.
Cursed are the malitious inuentors of slanders; and so are neither the renewers nor continuers of Concord.
so some of those companions ply the bore, to bore a shadowe, and beate their knuckels against a bare wall, and to get a sure card on their side, either calles for Iustice, and séekes to incense our noble Queene against the other.
Indéed confesse some of them haue great cause so to doo, but what then? Let hir imperiall Maiestie alone, by hir gratious leasure, and wisedome, she will prepare a boisterous snuffle, for such boisterous Iaddes, as will be wincing.
Slow to wrath, and slower to punishment, and alwaies like Elizabeth, she peaseth the sword of Iustice, with an vpright hand: when season serues, she will strike, and yet deuide so equally, that she hurts not one heire of an naturall subiect.
No doubt she is the naturall mother of this Iland (if Salomon himselfe were Iudge) that is so tender ouer hir Sonnes and subiects.
And they on the other side, stepdames, and most vnnaturall parents, that would haue their children dismembred cut off in middle.
Againe, those children be chaunglings, that in stéede of sucking the milke, would sucke the blood of their nourses.
Dost thou beléeue there be any Fairies then Perceuall? cannot tell whether there be Fairies, but am sure there is a foule Diuell that brings foorth changeable coured vrchins, which can glister like a glose worme neare gold, looke pale and wan vpon Lead, and browne vpon Iron: tell me now, whether is such a one a Chaungling, a Horselech, or a Chamelaeon? their Law: set downe your staffe, and pause a while, this heauie fardell hath bred a stitch in my short ribs.
But well remembred, Crier, make an, yes, for Martin to come into the Court.
sir, doo you stand vnder my sléeue, and sée you not? pray God haue not a foole at mine elbow, the Diuell you haue, quoth his heauy frinds.
thinke the mad slaue, hath tasted on a that he walkes so invisible.
haue had conference Martin, with these ruffe Roisters that challendge thée at all weapons, from the forrest bill, to the bodkin.
They séeme to blame a certaine Pipe of Pistling, that hath tooke the tip of thy toong and a vaine of lauish iangling, that hath made thy palate rise out of socket.
Their téeth water at reuenge, and are sharpe set on edge: thy selfe was the grindstone of their wits, and now if they cannot come at the faire, to hold thy nose to the grindstone, they sweare to chop thy Relickes and hacke thine hackle as small as fewell to the fire.
perceiue, and they would faine be on thy Iacke for thy sawcines, that thou art principall picker of the quarrell.
Martin, honor gray heares, during thy nonage: or else looke for dishonor and dotage if thou canst get any competent yéers on thy backe, before thou procurest a hempen chaine aboue thy shoulders.
Be thou a yoong boy, or a stale Batchelar, (vnmaried thou art by thine own Protestation) learne to reuerence those two ornaments of a Age and Authority.
Barre this pert bearding of men reputed honest for their behauiour, and honorable both for their calling and counsaile: Leaue thrumming thy Pibauld Iestes with Scripture, Iron and Clay will not be tempered togither.
Thy pamphlets which thou sendest into the broad world, may well be Pistles, but certainely they be no Gospels.
The word of God is sufficient to worke the will of God, néede not thy friuolous medleis, thy humane traditions, or additions, either to qualifie the vertue, or disgrace the enemies thereof, which thou pretendest, being thy selfe, doubt, an archenemie to the same.
Aske the Printer is he haue not a merier booke: this fellow is falne so low into his dumps, that there is no sport in reading him.
Let me gape and stretch my selfe a little, and then hay we ye.
find that in euery trade and occupation, there is a better and a worse, as there is in euery warpe of fish, a great and a lesse.
There is a Shomaker, there is a Cobler: a Tailor, and a Botcher: a Marchant, and a Broker: a Haberdasher and a Pedlar: a Mason and a Dawber: a Minstrell and a Fidler: a Parson and a Uicar: a Minister and a Curat: there steps me in a third tricksie, neat, nimble, spruse Artificer into euery one of these occupations: and like a prickeard Mule will be of another distinct kind from either dame or fire.
One standing all vpon his pumps pantables, will be aboue a Shomaker.
Another mounts vpon a loftier Shop bourd then a Tailor, and wil be none otherwise termde then a shaper of garments forsooth.
Stand thy ground Perceual, neuer run through such a rableme~t of Craftsmen forward, and backeward, am windles to follow thée so fast ouer ouer so many trads.
haue thy meaning at one word, as well as at an hundred.
Then sir if you be of such a sodaine conceipt, follow me step by step, from these handicrafts to matters of Religion.
Some of conscience study to reforme their owne liues, looke first into their own bosome: others to the intent that all the world might suppose, that nothing were amisse at home, like bad huswifes flie abroad, and search out publike imperfections, to busie their heads about.
Some againe endeuor to practise, without a multiplying of words openly: others beare a ready toong in their heads, but bray them in a morter, they will neuer be mortified in déeds: Some earnest protestants are precise in correcting their owne corrupt affections, and in aduertising their brother kindly of his faults as they fall: he goes for my money.

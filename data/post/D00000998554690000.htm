Translated out of Frenche, for the common benefite, into the vulgare tongue by I. S. Imprinted at London in Bacon house, by Christopher Barker, printer to the Queenes most excellent Maiestie.
To euery Christian Reader, and namely to the Lady Anne Bacon, now wife to Sir Nicolas Bacon Knight.
Trust (Madame) the alone names of Dauid and Beza, which is the honourable title of this litle booke, will not alone procure it a reuerende welcome into your hands, but withall against all men will both warrant and defend the translators price to be woorth his labour, as that which will recompence his fewe spent houres, with the much profite and pleasure of many.
For, besides the co~mon helpe it brings to all, for more cleare understanding and expounding those eight psalmes: it is singularly medicinable to wounded and cast downe consciences, who after their labor some combate with sinne, profitable humiliation there through, nay againe by these sweete Meditations with ioy, finding happie issue of their
And this, as it was my simple iudgement vpon first reading, euen so is it my comfortable experience vpon reading and reading againe.
Which was one thing that made me, among others, to thinke of you, good Madame, as to whose tender conscience it might be welcomly applyed.
But what neede that holy Prophet, and this reuerend Pastor, this my worde of poore credite? It is as if the least Pleiade would affoord some poore helpe of light to Sunne and Moone: must learne therefore to come downe, and know mine owne place, acknowledging my selfe to borrowe or begge both light and credite from them, if may be vouchsafed but the fauour of a stammering trucheman to so worthy an Hebrew, and to such a Frenchman.
Vpon both whose warrantise (as it were) a double voucher, wholy relye and rest secure for sufficient approofe of the matter of my translation.
Nowe a worde or two for this dedication, wherein my choise was not so much to content my selfe, but to goe rather as neere as possible to the continuance of the Authours own verie meaning.
He first purposed it to a Ladie, preuented by her death, gaue it yet to a Ladie, that to a Ladie Anne Bacon, wife to that Lorde late of great honour, for euer of Christian fame, Sir Nicholas Bacon Knight, father to Sir Nicholas Bacon Knight, husband to this Ladie Anne Bacon.
Being therfore by this meanes still continued in the selfe same ne of the Ladie Anne Bacon, wife also to
Sir Nicholas Bacon, and that in the same house, so néere, as from fathers wife to sonnes wife: halfe presume vpon, and yet humbly crane leaue of that learned Ladie Anne Bacon, to whom the Authour did first appropriate it, that as shee was once one with the father, and by him hath déere pledges: So shée will not thinke this any impropriation, but in her good affection to all that house, suffer them to receiue by her the honour of some particular interest with her in so sweete a labour of the Authour: who in his Epistle makes most honourable memorie of her husbande, and giues testimonie of good reputation to her sonne.
Although therefore, confesse my selfe of verie duty to loue al that good Brotherhoode, first for their loue to the trueth, with other agreeable vertues of wisedome and true honestie, and then for that loue which it pleaseth euery one of the~ (I wote not howe without my merit) kindly to beare me: yet in giuing this to their eldest brothers wife, and so to them all, neither giue them nor pay them ought, but yéeld them their owne, and which might not haue giuen to any other, vnlesse beyond the right of a translator, would haue taken vpon me to translate that into a strange familie, which seemes as a very heirloome properly belonging to Bacon house.
So wishing you (good Madame) most happie going forward in a simple hearted profession of Gods Eospell to the good ensample of your owne houshold, and a shining
light among your neighbours: the least of them, beseech the Lorde Iesus to blesse you and Sir Nicholas, together with his mease of religious brethren, so as growing in faith and loue, they may be a fast holding bundle of brethren in Christ, who keepe you all euer his, and one anothers.
To my lady, the lady Anne Bacon, widowe of the deceased Syr Nicolas Bacon Knight, Lord Keeper of the great seale of England.
MAdame, among other bookes of holy scripture, that of the Psalmes wel deserueth to bee singularly recommended to vs.
It is nowe some time, since hauing bestowed some payne in translating and expounding the same, gaue my selfe also to take some more libertie of dealing with them by way of meditating vpon that subiect, choosing (as it were for an assaye) the seuen Psalmes called some time Penitential, because they were appointed to such as after hauing satisfied open and canonical penaunce, were reunited to the body of the Church: wholy doing it for my particular
After this, beeing required by a great vertuous princesse, to frame for her some forme of prayers: tooke them afresh into my hands, polishing them ouer, and that with hope of publishing them: which being letted by the sodayne decease of that Lady, reserued them among my papers as things of no great price: where they had lyen still, had not bene the comming of master Anthony Bacon your sonne, into these partes: whom when sawe to take pleasure in this litle piece of woorke, and againe knowing by the latin letters wherewith it hath liked you to honour me, the great and singular, yea extraordinarie graces wherwith God hath indewed you, and whereof acknowledge a very paterne in your said sonne: perswaded my selfe that it should not be displeasing
to you, if this small volume carying your name vpon the browe, were offered to you, in testimonie of the honour and reuerence beare to the vertue of you and yours: hoping withall that this estate of widowehode whereunto it hath pleased God to call you by decease of that right vertuous and of right renowmed Lord, my Lord Nicolas Bacon your husband, most worthy Keeper of the seale of England, you might perhaps therein finde some consolation, after the reading of those great and holy doctors Greeke and Latine so familiar to you, for your better confirming in the meditation of spiritual things, and in this constancie and Christian patience wherewith God hath so beautified you, that in you is verily acknowledged that Christianly high minded courage which
sawe in these partes shining in the deceased, of very happy memorie, Syr Anthony Cooke Knight, during those great calamities publique to the realme, and particular to him his whole familie.
See the ground of my purpose, which if it may please you to take in good part, which very humbly craue, it may be perhaps an occasion of proceeding in this busines, our Lord ayding, whom beseeche, Madame, that increasing in you his greatest graces, he will preserue you and all your verie noble familie, long in all holy and perfect prosperitie.
ALas poore wretch most caytife creature, which art neuer more reasonles then when thine own blinde reason carieth thee, and when thine owne too too vnruly will doeth driue thee.
What way wilt thou chuse in this maze of manifolde pathes, wherein thou wert borne, and through which thou hast wandered vagabondlike till nowe? Thy first path of infancie, what better name can giue it then brutish simplicitie, which fooles call Innocencie, a way full of foule vncleannes, and an heape of miseryes, amo~g which this is one of the greatest,
that the infant can neither foresee miseries comming, nor throughly conceiue them beeing present.
From this path whither entredst thou oh vnhappy? Ahlas, into that wilde desert of youth, a desert say, well tracked and throughly beaten euery way, in which neuerthelesse there was neyther right waye nor path, and yet notably haunted with most mischieuous witches.
There found vanity that old sorceresse, she would needes be my guide, offering me at our first acquaintance a thousand co~tentations in appara~ce, but more vayne the~ winde in effect.
There did those two wilde beasts, Ouerweening Ambition, make themselues so tame familiar with me, as was by by at their becke, so farre forth as to followe them into a sea that had neither bottom nor
shoare, where they did their best to make me dwell still remedilesse, all (quoth they) to bring me to the true felicitie: in steade whereof was betrayed into the haudes of pleasure, that nice decked strumpet, and withall the most stinking and daungerous that euer was in the world, inticing and interteining infinite wayes all them which doe but looke at her, and which more is, she bewitcheth the~ in such sort with her cuppe, that sodainely their conscience becommeth lulled a sleepe, all iudgement lost, yea very sense it selfe astonished, and then loue wee our woe, loathe our weale, what is most foule, seemes most fayre, what is most hurtfull, seemes most profitable, and that which is most sowre, seemes most sweete, yea oftentimes it bringeth to foule death
and shame, and a thousand woes weale away: and this is all the felicitie to be hoped for.
Oh most happy man which balkest this streight, and singlest thy self farre from such so vnhappy feloweship.
haue done yet worse then al this, for, going foorth of the wildernes, am entred into an other cou~trey peopled with farre worse folke then the former: for hitherto haue rather bene deceiued then a deceiuer, and that erred, proceeded not so much of malice, as of ignorance.
But from thencefoorth in steade of hauing learned by mine own harme nowe gaue my selfe ouer to doe much worse, applying my selfe to couetousnes, enuie, deceit, and at once, to euery kinde of vice, perswading my selfe that this was the true and neerest way to happinesse.
And when sometimes my conscie~ce reproued me, sought by al meanes to make my self beleeue yt vice was vertue, couetousnes was nothing but good husbandrie to prouide for my selfe and my meany, enuie was nothing with me, but a desire to haue of things about me as other me~ had, al deceit was faire cunning good skil: at a word, concluded that being in this world, must do after the facions of other men, vnto whose example framed my selfe throughout.
But poore wanderer, what hast thou founde in the ende of this so ill a way? verily all the contrary to thy weening.
Nowe then howe blessed is that person which busieth not himselfe to folow such a way of folke giuen vp to all vice, bringing toyle to our body, torme~t to our conscience, and final destruction
both of body and soule! For whither doth such a custome of ill doing thrust vs by litle litle?
Certainly euen to this point, that wee lose all feeling of God, all remorse of conscience, of ignorant wee become wicked, of wicked we become mischieuous to the vttermost, and finally we become scorners of God and of euery good thing.
Oh most great God, is it possible that dust ashes being now become so infirme a creature, so changeable, so very nothing worth, yea worse then nought, should so doate in presumption, as not only not to quake at the least aduertisement of his own conscience, being awakened of it self or by any the least meane in the world: but also to set him selfe against thee, to shut his eare against the voyce of thy threatnings, to pluck out his
owne eyes, that he might not perceiue thy horrible iudgements, to harden his heart against thine almightie puissaunce? Oh most good God, patience it selfe, thou louer of men, in so much as thou diddest not spare for their sake thine onely sonne equall to thee, yea one selfe God with thee, can it come to passe, that this creature, despising thy goodnes in calling him when hee fleeth, thy patience in bearing with him when he rebelleth, thy liberalitie in making him a partner of thy so great and incomprehensible blisse euerlasting, when he gaue himselfe to most vaine vanitie, should so far forget himself, as to reiect thy goodnes, to make a mocke at thy patie~ce, to trample vnder his feete such a treasure? Yea Lorde, alack, all this is but too true: and which is more,
those which bee guyltie of these crimes, be such as thou hast aduanced highest.
But my God, retire my feete from those crooked wayes wherein haue gone too farre already: and since thou hast put in me the desire of blessednesse, shewe me also the ready addresse thereunto, giue mee a will to follow it, and strength to pursue it, euen till may attaine it to thine honour and glorie.
Now then poore creature, abused by thy selfe, and mislead by others, hearken at the last what the Lord will teach thee, Blessed is that man which taketh pleasure in the Lordes law, and which meditateth thereof dayly and nightly: what say I, Thy law Lord? why, that is it which astonisheth me, which condemneth me, which killeth me, as
wherein there is neuer a commandement which carieth not my death sentence withall.
For, howe many creatures haue set in thy place? oh golde and siluer, thou hast occupied a great part of my heart and of mine hope: ye honours and worldly pleasures, haue bene the god which haue adored: oh abused heart, thou hast bene the altar wheron haue bene set vp so many idoles as thou hast passionate affections, whereunto thou hast thralled thy selfe.
The whole course of my inordinate life hath bene a continuall dishonour of thy precious name.
Howe many times haue sworne vntruly and bene disloyall? Who can reckon the leasings which make me faultie euen before my neighbours? When haue ceased from mine owne works to do thine? Thy
worde (Lord) what deafe eare haue giuen it, and howe haue practised it? Holy Baptisme wherewith thou hast vouchsafed to honour me, hath it not bene a thousand times by me dishonoured, polluted, and villanously abused? how vnworthily haue presented my selfe to thy holy boord! How oft haue lyed vnto thee! And can boast of any obedience towardes them where owe it, since haue so litle feared to disobey thee? If in thy sight, iust Iudge, hee bee a murtherer which sayth to his brother Racha, if he bee an adulterer which castes a looke at his brothers wife with a lusting eye, then howe can cxempt my selfe from either of these crimes? And yet neuerthelesse according to thy most iust lawe, there is no atonement for blood among men: howe
then shall compound for so many murders towardes thee, thou iudge of the verie thoughts? If lust alone without any further act doe make me an adulterer, and if no adulterer haue any part in the kingdome of heauen, poore creature that thou art, what shall become of thee? If it be not onely simple thieuerie, but, which more is, flat sacriledge, to withholde goods consecrated to thy glorie, (according as thou hast committed them vnto vs from aboue to be thy stewards of them) how may bee dispensed withall, hauing shut mine eares least should heare the poore, closed mine eyes that might not see him, locked vp my bowels that they might not be touched with compassion towards so many my poore brethren? What say I, my brethren? Nay rather
towards thee thy self, Lord, hungring, thirsting, and being naked in their person.
Thee say, oh thou great and eternall sonne of God, which hast made thy selfe of no reputation, that thou mightest aduaunce man so high with thee, which vouchsafedst to be come poore to the end to enrich him with eternall treasures, which didst subiect thy selfe to all our weaknesses, that thou mightest make vs inuincible: at once, (oh depth of bountie) thou disdaynedst not to hang naked on the crosse, to enter into the house of death, to the end to cloth me againe with glorie, and to bring mee into the true paradise of euerlasting life.
To be short, who is it but man that holdeth thy truth in vnrighteousnes, that is a lier, and a falsifier, and that is borne with lust: And
wouldest thou, Lord, that should search life in thy lawe, which is the verie soliciter, witnesse, iudge, and executioner of the deadly sentence agaynst me? All this notwithstanding (oh Lord) there will seeke life, since that so is thine ordinance, and there shall find it, since thou hast spoken it.
Thy law is good because it is giuen by him that is only good: it is holy, for it is made by the holie of holies.
From that which is good cannot proceede that which is ill: death commeth not properly by the lawe, but through sinne: sinne commeth of the sinner, and not from thee, who doest hate and forbid that which is naught.
If a sicke man would freat himself to death against the Physitio~, whose were the fault? The lawe then iudgeth me because it findes me guiltie: good Lord,
cleare mee againe, and make mee guiltles by thy law of faith, that the lawe of workes (which amaseth me, condemneth me, slaieth me in my self) may assure me, absolue me, and quicke~ me by him that hath fulfilled it for me, became euen curse it self for my sake: For, Lorde, it is thou which strikest and curest, which leadest to graue bringest back again: Grau~t me through him the spirit of sanctification, which may fit mee vnto thy seruice, create in me the will and the power to doe, pearce mine eares that in hearing may heare, giue me eyes to see, grau~t me feete to walke in thy wayes: Then Lord, being wholy changed, shall not heare thy worde for facions sake, but shall therein take all my pleasure, shall eate say with a good appetite of this quickening
foode, for shall finde a good smacke in it: shal digest it, and neuer thinke my selfe satisfied with it: Day and night shall not cease to applie all mine vnderstanding thereunto, that more and more may be nourished and susteyned in the full enioying of that true, absolute, and eternall felicitie.
In meane while, Lorde my God, shall be idle, and finde leysure to do nothing, but onely to occupie my thoughts in contemplation? Not so: for though he be nothing lesse then idle which exerciseth that part of him selfe receyued from thee, to knowe thee and consider thee in thy word and in thy workes, and that no mans actions can be conducted but by the good discourse and resolution of the spirit: yet forasmuch as man was created
at the beginning, and since that time againe made a newe creature by thee the second time, to be a singular instrument in thine hande, it is necessarie that his soule beyng taught by thee, shoulde imploye it selfe, and that instrument which thou hast giuen it, in such actions as are agreeable to thy will, and in that vocation, for which thou hast created it.
If then the idle body be guyltie in thy sight, as by good right the workman may finde fault with that toole, which wil not abide to be handled, yea he may marre it and breake it: what shalbe thought of that toole, that wil occupy it selfe as it listeth, and when the workman would vse it, it will not be stirred? and when you woulde handle it of one side, it will turne it selfe quite awke? Be this farre from mee my
For rather will be not an instrument of a dead matter, but shall haue a naturall liuely strength in me,
To be short, shalbe as a faire fruite bearing tree, planted by thine hand in thy house, grafted vpon that right and kindly liue, shooting vp to heauenward, my fresh greene braunches garnished with fruites proceeding from thy grace,
which will alway water mee at the roote, and will preserue from frostes, heates, windes and other tempestes, so as from them shall rather gather fresh forces to yeelde plenteous fruite: whereas finners shall bee drye at the roote.
And if they make any gay shewe for a while, yet in the turning of an hande they come downe
either by themselues, or striken by thy furie, and shalbe rooted out, so as no man shal perceiue their place, neither shal they be good for ought, but to bee burned and brought to nought: And yet do some wrong to compare the~ to trees, rather are they thornes, bryers and brambles, which thou doest fagot vp together in their time, to be thrust in the fire: yea rather yet shall they be as dust small chaffe, which shall go into the winde, when thou shalt fanne thy floore, and shalt locke vp the good grayne in thy garners.
And albeit this difference be not manifest through the co~fusions of this worlde, but contrariwise the wicked men seeme surest planted, hyest promoted, and most florishing, yet shal not this vayne shewe be durable, but the true iudgement of
their estate shall shewe it selfe, so soone as thy iustice appeareth to set in order all that is disordered: and it shall then he clearely discouered in deed what they are, when that great day shall come, so dreadfull to the wicked, which shall not know whither to turne them, and so longed for by thy poore seruants, to whom being gathered together from all coastes, thou shalt doe iustice and reason of so many wrongs and violences receiued, wiping away their teares, and graunting them that felicitie which they so much desire.
Nowe then my soule, sith the francke bountie of thy God hath drawen thee forth of these straying paths of destruction, to the ende to leade thee in the true and only way of blessednesse: take good heede not to forsake it, but followe on thy
course liuely, suffer not thy selfe to be mislead by any inticements, nor to be dismayed by any threatnings, holding fast alwayes this conclusion in thine heart, as well agaynst flatteries as against terrifyings, to wit, that howsoeuer the matter fall out, since that God is God Iudge of the world, they which go streight cannot misse to be blessed, standing alwayes in the good grace and fauour of God: and the wicked contrariwise must needes perish.
AH, woe is me more then miserable wretche, assayled, pressed, outraged on all sides, wounded mortally by my conscience, pearced through and through by the touch of infinite trespasses, and nowe at brincke of that deepe dungeon of despayre, in my body euerwhelmed with euils, plunged in sorrowes, in which torment nothing more can be founde that may adde to my torme~t: what shall doe, what shall saye, whither shall goe? what may finde in my selfe but the subiect of suffering, and the cause of that suffer, and who shall succour mee from els where? If looke into heauen, see there my iudge: The
sunne, that great eye of the worlde, which hath seene me so often to offend his maker and mine, doth summon me, and seemes to giue light to the worlde for none other purpose but to behold me whilest endure these my merited paynes.
The night which seemes to couer all things els with her darkenes, alas, what doth she witnesse against me? Forsooth me seemes, she hath doubled her darkenes in a loathsome detestation of that which in glimpse of her accustomed obscuritie shee hath bene forced to perceiue in me: It yrketh the earth to beare so vnhappie a creature, and already shee openeth yt great throat of her gulfe to swallow me in, and to redemau~d my selfe to her selfe, as hauing too much abused that earthly matter which shee ministred to my maker
All that norishment which receiue fro~ other creatures, is giuen me onely to entertaine me in this extreme torme~t.
Death it selfe recules fro mee, lest she might giue at ye least some senselesnes of dolor to this miserable body, by dispatching it at once out of ye way.
As for me~, they be either mine enemies, or els such friends as haue no might to giue me remedie: whither shal go the~? what shal say? what shall doe? will euen goe streight to thee, eternall: For what good shal it do me to runne away from him that is euery where? Who ca~ hide me from before him, which seeth euen that that is not? what creature, though it could, yet durst vndertake my quarrel wt thee? if it should vndertake, what would ensue, but their ruine and mine?
And my disease being incurable to all others saue to thee, to whome should haue recourse but to thee? Nowe then, eternall God, more great then greatnes it selft, behold him that is lesse then nothing, vnlesse the greatest ill bee something.
creator of man, beholde thy creature quite disfigured: louer of man, beholde him that hath conspired with thine enemie against thee: perfectly good, behold him that is conceiued and borne in vice: beholde the drye wood to the consuming fireward, and shall it yet be so hardy as to speake? His miserie constrayneth him to seeke remedie: thy goodnes declared in thy promises, and verified by so many experiences, doeth open his mouth to cry before thee, Reproue me not in thy wrath, correct me not in thine anger.
God, which hast sayde, that the waye not to bee iudged, is to iudge our selfe, beholde this vnhappie man, that acknowledgeth before thee thine Angels, before beauen earth, that my least fault of a thousande is worthie of thy wrath so dreadfull, that none can beare it, because there is none thy match.
And what emboldeneth mee then after this sort: Thy goodnesse, thy pitie, thy compassion, which is so much the greater as it stretcheth it selfe vpon the vnworthie, there most aboundeth, where there is most sinne.
Lorde, suffer mee, though dust and ashes, to bee, not bold in my selfe, but assured in thee.
euerliuing God, haue learned in thine house by thee, and in my selfe by thy grace, how thou hast an anger of a most gentle father, and a
am worthte of this, but be seeche thee turne it from me, for it destroyeth: refuse not the other, because it buyldeth vp: for thou chastisest whome thou louest.
Nowe then Lorde, smite, but keepe in the violence of the blowe.
And to speake in a worde, eternall God, haue pitie on me.
For who hath neede of grace, but the guyltie one? Who beggeth comfort, but the afflicted: or physicke, but the sicke?
And againe, who can raise the poore man ouerwhelmed vnder the burden of sinne, beaten downe flat vnder thy puissant hande, crushed bones and all, cast away in his own conscience, but thou, great God, who by thine onely word giuest being to all that is: Confirme then that which remaynes of thy nature
and being in me, or rather worke a newe, that which otherwise goeth away is vndone.
And howe long, my God, wilt thou suffer mee thus to languish: How long shall cry without being relieued: Howe long shall wayte for thy mercie? Suffer, Lord, that the vehemencie of dolour may vse this laguage, submitting it selfe yet wholly to thine onely good and thrise good pleasure.
eternall God, say, turne againe to mee that countenance, which with one looke can reuiue the dead: Lay forth that great compassion to heale my saynting soule: for vpon thine onely grace it is that ground my request.
God, thou knowest what a desire haue to be an instrument of thy glory, and to employ whatsoeuer
it may please thee to make mee to publish thy prayses.
Alas, Lord, my sinnes thus sending me to death, shall they be able to hinder this my purpose that comes of thee? For, being dead and lying in the dust, loe all my purpose broken off, my memory shall forthwith bee taken quite away, my tongue shall speake no more of thee, my mouth shal cease to haue any being: To be short, this poore corps being fordone, wherein shall it serue either thee, or my neighbours? Moreouer Lorde, if do not onely dye, according as is thine ordinance for all men to dye once, but also that dye as one smitten in thine ire, Oh my God, my God, howe can remember thee in that last necessitie? How can call vpon thee at my greatest neede? To speake at once, what shal
become of me wofull creature, going to a Iudge that condemneth mee, yea euen already executeth his sentence vpon mee? Oh God, preserue mee from this woe of woes, and giuing me againe for this time life to this poore body, assure my poore soule by witnessing vnto it, that thine anger is ceassed, to the ende that death when it shall come, be not a messenger of terror, but rather may bring tydings of felicitie forthwith to be enioyed.
Alas Lorde, as thou hast now had an eye, and straightly marked our sinnes, which thou doest nowe make me throughly to feele: so consider this poore creature now changed, condemning that which hee hath too long approoued, yea iudging himselfe, which is the very meane not to be iudged of thee: for
so it pleaseth thee, sith thou hast testified it both by thy word and by effect.
ye nightes, heretofore witnesses of a thousand thoughtes wickedly imagined, and of the vnhappy sequele of those thoughts, be ye now witnesses of my waylings.
And thou my bed, a bed earewhile of rest very ill employed, be thou throughly moystened nowe, and swimme thou with my teares.
Oh thou sunne, whose light haue heretofore so much offended, (and howe could feare to offend thee, being so desperatly bolde as to despise thy maker and mine, looking into the depth of heartes, and to assay to put out his light in me?) thou Sunne, say, whose
brightnes am vnworthie to beholde: mine eyes being iustly punished, can no more see thee, being soaked out and drawen drye by the teares that they haue shead: they be, saye, quite worne with yrkesomnes and heauines, whereof they bene witnesses that vexe mee.
But what, shall perish then? Is there no more hope? Am quite without recouery? No, no, my God: For whence comes this bewayling of my sinnes? This hatred of my self? This confidence to call vpon thee? this desire to amend? From whe~ce springs it, that speake yet, and can call thee my God? Certainely it is thy grace: For whence comes any good, but fro thee? mightie God, howe be thy wayes incomprehensible! May it be thine yre which should quiet me, or mine heauinesse
that might cheare mee? Or can my death bee the occasion of my life? No, no, my God, this benefite proceedes no whitte of any worke of mine, but Lord, in working againe him that as much as in him laye, hath vndone himselfe, thou shewest thy selfe to be the same that madest all things of nothing, and canst pul light out of darkenesse.
Grance then commeth from thee vnto mee, to driue my selfe out of my selfe, that so againe may finde my selfe and all my weale in thee.
You then mine enemies, which weened to haue cast mee flatte and quite to the grounde, shall you dare now to shewe your faces any more? Thou malicious Sathan, the first author of all ill, what gaynest thou to haue throwen me lowe, vnlesse it be that thereby my victorie against
thee is more notable? For, thou seeest, maugre thy malice, that God will triumphe vpon thee by my feeblenesse.
Oh, and out vpon my selfe the most dangerous enemie to my selfe, yeelde thy selfe to him, against whome the more thou hast resisted, the more neere thou camest to thy destruction.
You cursed men, whose trade is to doe ill, and you which haue so persecuted mee, stand no longer in feare of you.
For the eternall God, which seemed to haue cast mee off, and to deliuer me into your handes as one vtterly reiected, hath heard my deepe sighes accompanyed with teares:
The euerliuing God hath heard my prayers, the eternall will perseuere to heare my supplications.
enemies which haue bene so presumptuous, goe their wayes with shame: see them already quite forlorne, they shalbe fayne to leaue their vngratious enterprise to their reproche, a chaunge so much the more wonderfull, as it commeth to passe suddenly and beyonde all expectation.
OH my God, where shall that true felicitie bee found, which vngracious men weene to finde? Certainly man findes it not within him selfe.
For who is he that can saye, hee is without sinne in his soule? And where there is sinne, doubtlesse there is malediction also.
for the body, what man is so brutish, that can perswade himself, the most soueraigne good shoulde fall into a lumpe subiect to so many euils and miseries within and without, bringing it at length also to death? This felicitie then is out of our selues, and we must begge it from otherwhere.
And from whe~ce? To seeke it among beastes were more then beastlike, and consequently much lesse will it be founde in the senselesse creatures.
golde and siluer, so highly valued with men of no value for wit, how ca~ you make a man happie, sith your best seruice to a man standeth in leauing him, to passe to another, that tarying wt him, you bring him nothing but care to keepe you, feare to lose you, and an vnsatiable desire to hoarde you? Thou foode, whose taste holdes
not the space of halfe a foote in all mans body, and cannot be felt, but while it is in loosing, which canst not nourish but with thine owne corruption, which art most commonly the instrument of maladies, and finally of death, canst thou bring blisse to a man? You celestiall circles turning about endlesly, is it true that mans happy or vnhappy state hanges vpon your influences? How senselesse were he yt so would thinke, sith you your selues must suffer cha~ge? And being such as you are, you send vs to ye knowledge of one farre greater, vpon whom you your selues depende.
You spirituall creatures so excellent, shal it be you yt shal furnish vs of this goodly felicitie? You be happie in deede very puissaunt creatures, yet but creatures, therefore also vnable to repaire
ye image of God in me, (without which must remaine vnhappie) as to say trueth, it is not your woorke, but for God alone: neither were you created to bestow on me yt which you haue not your selues receiued, but by ye free goodnes of him that is greater then you, then all things else.
And if find none elsewhere, neither aboue, nor belowe, yt can giue me in part or in whole, that which seeke, should bee so deuoyd of vnderstanding, as to thinke yt can giue it to my selfe? Shal find blessednes in corruption, iustice in vnrighteousnesse, life in death? For what am Lord in my self but corruption, but vnrighteousnes, but death? Alas then, shal perish? For out of al doubt, death is ye wages of sinne.
But ye case so stands, God, that no euill is incurable to the Almightie.
He which hath drawen all things out from nothing, can he be hindered to make againe his owne work? He that caused light to come out of darknesse, shal not he bring againe fro~ death to life? Yes certainly, otherwise death being ye stro~ger, might thrust God out of his seate.
Nowe then, Lord, my disease being past cure of all creatures, come to thee, who canst doe all that thou wilt: and who hast shewed yet more excellent testimonie of thy goodwil in sauing man, then thou diddest of thy might in creating him.
Thy might surely was witnessed by a meane wel becomming thee, when thou madest all of nothing, framing man to thine image and likenesse: and this same infinite power appeares clearely in the conseruation of all thy creatures.
is all this in comparison of that worke, mans Redemption?
Blessed then is he, not simply whome thou hast created, (for man turned this blessing of creation into an assured curse by ill vsing it but rather is he blessed, whome thou hast ransommed through such a great goodnes of thine, as euery way excels.
For lesse vnworthy of thy gratious bou~tie is hee, which yet hath no being, then is the sinner: And thou contentedst not thy selfe (O great deapth of goodnesse) to restore to sinnefull man that blisse which hee had lost, but thou gauest him a farre better: For hauing created him such a one, as by sweruing from his perfection (as in deede hee did) might fall also into sinne, death, and curse, thou finally makest him such a one by redemption, as hee can neyther sinne
straunge thing, great and chiefe master worke of God! Al wretchednesse comes by sinne, and yet none comes to happines, but hauing passed first and formost by sinne: not that blisse comes out of sinne, but because mercy presupposeth miserie, pardon a fault, and quickning a former death.
But whence comes this pardon? From thy selfe, Lorde, and from thy pure bountie.
And howe? euen by quitting me my transgressions, by couering my sinnes, and by not reckoning vy mine iniquities: yet must thy iudgement be satisfied euen wholy and to the vttermost.
Here beholde againe a depth of wisedome and goodnes: For howe great is that secret, nowe manifested by effect, where pardoning all, thou yet punishest all, and
we hauing payed nothing, yet finde our selues to haue wholy satisfied thee? Iudgement is become mercy to vs: out of malediction thou drewest blessing, death hath brought foorth life.
All this was thy doing, God, infinitely great and euen so good: for who also coulde haue done it, but thou? thou hast done it, because it pleased thee, for, who knewe thee, who loued thee, who gaue vnto thee first? That Emmanuel conceiued by the holie Ghost, hath fully repaired in himselfe this poore nature conceyued in iniquitie.
The suertic that ought nothing, hath payd for our discharge.
Wherfore then troublest thou thy selfe poore conscience? That corruption wherein thou art, is blotted out in
The obedience of the acceptable one, with the fulnesse of his obedience, hath filled euen til it ouerflow againe, this want of righteousnesse, which thy Creator requireth of thee.
The suffrings of the iust of al iustes are thine acquittance.
Beholde thy life and thy felicitie: there is none elsewhere, there is, saye, none other Iesus, that one and onely name of saluation.
What remaynes then, but that cheerefully without glosse, and vnfaynedly acknowledging thy selfe to be in death, thou receiue this life by a liuely faith, liuely, say, whose effects may shewe themselues.
For besides that God can not bee deceyued, hee is no sauiour of deceyuers.
The God of trueth hateth all falsehood: and who doth wash himselfe,
to the ende to returne to ye filth? Is pardon giuen that we should sinne more hardily? Doeth light bring vs into darkenesse? And as no fitter example of all this may bee, then my selfe: euen so will publish it,
to the ende that may serue for a mirrour and paterne to others.
Alas, in what paine was I? Were not all my bones dryed with heauinesse? Was there euer sommer drought more partching, then this heate, which hath vtterly marred mee? Howe oft haue bene ouerwhelmed with anguish, not able to vtter one worde? How often on the other side,
haue cryed and howled all the day long? And not without cause, my God, for daye and night felt the terrible weighing strokes of thine hande, a burden intolerable for any
But howsoeuer tossed tormented my selfe, where found remedy at length? Hearken hereto euery one, and thou my soule forget it neuer.
So long as sought to excuse my selfe, and couer my faultes in all or any part: So long as went about to counterbalance my faultes with my payne, so long as spurned against the spurre, my mischiefe grewe still: haue therefore learned a farre other waye.
come to thee, eternall God, my Iudge and my aduerse partie, haue confessed all, haue suppressed nothing in silence, nor disguised any of mine iniquitie: and according as did purpose it in my self, euen so haue done: condemning my selfe found absolution, summoning my selfe was dismissed.
Nowe then, all ye not hautie and high looking ones, but whome God hath vouchsafed grace to taste his goodnesse in afflictions, aboue all in the combats of conscience, searche for this onely and most assured remedy.
Haue recourse to him which smiteth you: the meane to finde him is prayer.
Let not your vnworthines hinder you, but rather let it driue you so much the neerer him.
With God he is counted worthie, which confesseth himselfe vnworthie.
Yf sinne displease thee because it is sinne, and that thou desirest his grace, knowe that already thou art halfe heard: For, true sorowe to haue offended, desire to come before him, and an affection to cry him mercy, be so many messengers whereby he inuiteth thee first, and so many testimonies that
Come then and enter, but with an heart stricken downe, with an head bowed low, and thou shalt feele all thy torment vanish away, all thine anguishes flee as farre from thee as euer they were nigh thee: that flood of euils which had couered and swallowed thee, shall voyde it selfe.
Shortly, in steade of this miserie thou shalt receyue the true peace which the worlde can neither giue, nor take away, and the true repose of conscience, euen the very anchre and earnest peny of that durable blessednesse to followe.
Certainely my God, this is true, for, knowe it by experience, and shall learne it more and more, hauing thee for my Protector, giuing mee euery day new arguments to praise thee, by continuall assistance of thy
as agayne on my part thou onely art, and shalt be my refuge and recourse.
Learne this lesson hardily of mee, thou, whosoeuer desirest to knowe the right way, and bee content to take mee thy guyde in this behalfe.
Beware you take not the bit in your teeth, nor kicke like mule and horse: for so doe beastes voyde of vnderstanding, and thou seest them gayne nothing by so doing, saue that they are bitted so much the more roughly, and spurred more sharpely, till they come to some order:
Euen so will it befall him which will not profite by such chastisements from God, waxing obstinately opinionate in his euil, which shall bring sorowe vpon sorowe:
whereas on the contrary, who so will haue recourse to God, bowing vnder his puissaunt hande, shall bee compassed with his goodnes.
you louers of righteousnes, you which by Gods grace giue your selues to vprightnes, vp, cheare vp your selues with mee to honour God eternall, witnes ye by your sonnets of prayse, that the issue of afflictions, on their behalfe which can make profit by them, is ioy and consolation to the glory of that great God, which chastiseth his owne for their good, and punisheth the hard harted with al rigour after their demerits.
Eternal (for to who~ shall addresse my selfe but to thee who art as puissaunt to heale as to smite) giue me leaue to bewray my complaint: not to playne me of thee, who doest nothing but well, and whose ire, confesse haue pulled vpon me, for my trespasses: but to beseech thee, that according to thy promises thou wilt not vse against me that iudgement which thou reseruest for such as thy fury and most fearefull indignation will quite destroy: But rather thy fatherly maner of chastising howe rough and sharpe soeuer it may seeme to this flesh.
And thou wotest well Lord, that crye not as doe those delicate
ones, which make much of a litle, and crye loude for a small griefe: For it is euen deepe to the quicke that the keene heades of thine arrowes shot off at mee, haue pearced: It is in very great earnest, that thy mighty hand is (as it were) setled vpon me.
Regard, Lord, this poore body which hath no whole part: Respect these poore grynded bones: for in deede how might they stande, or haue any being before thine angry face? And all, Lorde, neuerthelesse most iustly, since the whole cause thereof is in me who haue so much offended thee:
confesse and auow that it is so, and loe, the spring of all sorrowes and torments wherein am sowsed ouer head and eares, vtterly ouerwhelmed vnder this loade, a loade farre to heauie and altogether
together insupportable, if thou doest not sustayne and staye me.
Those killing blowes which thou gauest mee, haue bred corrupt matter, such as putrifyeth my poore carkase, which euen smelles of the fruites and hyre of my folye, poore senseles man that was, when thus rebelled against thy will.
But, beholde my God, will not stiffen my necke, bowe both body heart vnder thy strong hande,
drawing my legges after mee, parched and broyled as am through heauines and languishing.
Alas, my reynes howe they burne, To be short, my God, what shal saye?
am altogether made up into sorrowe, am brayed as in a morter, am ground as it were in a myl, so as can not hold, but cry, or roare rather.
But my Lord, (for know thou allowest mee for thy seruaunt though neuer so miserable) for all this thou art my retraicte, my longing is after thee alone, without searching succour elsewhere.
My gronings direct the~selues to thee, albeit thorough mightye griefe my seely forlorne heart had with it self a thousand wandering discourses, and my force so farre forth fayled me, as lost my sight.
And yet a greater griefe, when as my wretched plight should rather haue moued the very stones to compassion.
They which in former tymes had called them selues my friendes, and whose part thought it to partake my calamities, they stand stone still in stead of running vnto mee: yea my next of kinde most vnkindely with much a
to whose wish cannot dye soone ynough, lay snares for mee, desiring nothing but my death, not ceasing in meane while to slaunder me, and to assay al meanes of trapping me.
All this notwithstanding, thou knowest, Lord, that haue not skirmished againe with them, rendring euil for euil either in deede or worde,
but haue passed ouer all this geare as if had bene deafe not hearing a whit of it, neither haue replyed no more to them then a dumbe man which had neuer vse of tongue: answered nothing,
but apposed onely silence to al wrongs: not that had not iust defenses ynowe, but had rather referre all to thee, protector of Innocents, reuenger of the oppressed: knowing
full well, that silence and patience please thee woonderfully well.
Nowe then, eternall, God, it is thou alone on whome.
Lord, thou art my God, and therefore wilt not, knowe, leaue mee vnanswered: For,
(quoth to my selfe) is it possible for thee to indure that these mischieuous ones which assay to hinder the effect of thy promises, that these vnkinde men which assayle thee in setting thus vpon my person, should haue matter to glad them against me? Make speede then to me my God, otherwise goe in danger neuer to bee restored, being ouerwhelmed with dolours, which accompany me day and night.
For my part, am alwayes ready to acknowledge my trespasses, the payne whereof cary with me, tormented in body, and frighted in spirite.
Mine enemies quite contrary, enemies, say, without all colour of cause, strengthen themselues, and beare their heads higher and higher, fiercely and brauely against mee, who, alack, did neuer ought to them but well,
and against whome they thus band themselues for none other cause, but for that doe not as they doe, but rather loue that which is good, howsoeuer otherwise be a sinner.
but keepe thy selfe neere this poore creature, which calleth vpon thee, Lorde, from whome alone wayte for
make speede to ayde me in the extremitie of my necessitie.
God, which hast set before vs in one and selfe same person of Dauid, a very maruaylous example of sinne and repentance, and of thy compassions: giue mee vnderstanding and good consideration of his waylings, well to apply them to mine owne vse and thy glorie.
What is it then, that Dauid sayth, beyng wakened by the voyce of thy Prophet Nathan? God, God? And darest thou name this most sacred name, thou mischieuous mouth of so mischieuous a
man? hauing polluted thy self with so many adulterous kisses, foule mouth, vndertakest thou to name it thou enemy of al vncleannes? Thou trayterous tongue agaynst thy faithfull seruant Vriah, canst thou pronounce this word, GOD, who is most true? Yee handes embrued with many murders, presume you so farre as to followe that bolde tongue, heauing vp your selues towarde him, whome you haue so shamefully profaned? Thou heart, guiltie of the whole lawe broken at one blowe, art thou so hardie as to addresse thee to him, who hath already iudged thee? king, so many wayes periured against him, that of a poore shepheardly boye, promoted thee aboue the throne of all this worldes monarches: Thou hypocrite towardes him, who hath performed
formed thee infinitely more then euer hee promised thee: wretched man, which hast trampled vnder feete the couenant of eternall life, to make an adulteresse of a chaste wife: vnhappie man, who hast layd that most pretious name open to the blasphemies of infidell nations: thou ingrate, which hast rendred to thy loyall seruant death for his wages: thou vnworthy one, that, where thou owedst to thy people all iustice, hast shewed them the way to all mischiefe: liuest thou yet, speakest thou yet? darest thou call vpon thy God yet? Yea, my God, so great is thy patience, that it giues me heart againe, not to name thee by waye of complaynt against mine enemies, as in some other Psalmes haue done: but euen my selfe to bee mine owne accuser
In summe, what can he, or what wil he saye, who was once thy deare Dauid by thy more then most liberall bountie, but nowe is nothing like Dauid, through his owne more then most detestable ingratitude? In summe, say, he sayeth,
Haue pitie on me, God of mercy: and what maner of pitie? True it is, Lorde, that thy mercy is alwayes infinite in it selfe, but such is the multitude of my trespasses, that surely me thinkes one onely mercy woulde not bee ynough for mee: wherefore beseeche thee, vnfolde here all the store of thy compassions, that may feele them.
Alas, haue not nowe to treate for the wiping out of some petie blot, or prancke of youth: but my foule filthinesses pollutions
be so vile, so stinking, so farre cankered within mee, euen to the very soule of my soule, that, although with one word thou canst al things, yet doe perswade my selfe, that as may saye, it is not with once fairely touching that this my blotte wil away, so great is my rebellion, but must bee rubbed and rubbed againe, washed and rynsed, before can bee cleansed from so great and festered a pollution.
dissemble not, set no glosse on the matter: acknowledge mine iniquities, euen such as they are: my wickednesse continually presents it selfe before my poore spirite: me thinkes doe euen still see with mine eyes that poore woman bayning her selfe: mee thinkes see Dauid troubled in spirit, and while he resisteth his conscience, to
receiue thine enemie and his owne into his bosome, yeelding himselfe his willing captiue: mee thinkes yet see those, whome did vse in that businesse, alack, too too obedient seruants were they to so euill a commandement: see, woe is me, the filed and defiled bedde whereat once imbraced both sinne and death: see thee thou disloyall and murderous heart, and thou trayterous hand whereby those two murderous letters, and that at seuerall times were written, not with ynke, but with the blood of that poore guyltlesse seruant: see the poore people, for whome thou oughtest to haue layde forth thy life, nowe like a forlorne heape thrust foorth to the enemies sworde: see thee, my loyall seruant, ouerthrowen on the grounde, hathing thee in thy blood
shedde in his seruice, that betrayed thee to death: heare (as it were) a peale in mine eares of the horrible blasphemies co~ming from infidell mouthes, which my selfe haue opened: see that gaye marriage, vnder vayle whereof weened to vayle my adulterie, discouering it yet in meane while euen by that very meane before thee, Lorde, and before men.
Ahlas, what can perceyue in the least of these foule crimes, but thy wrath, thy iudgement,
For what get hereby, that being the King, men dare arraygne or iudge mee according to the tenour of the lawe against blasphemers, adulterers, and murderers? It is thou, and none other, with whome haue to doe: for it is thou
properly that haue offended, before whose eyes and tribunall seate that is come to light, which so carefully cloaked before men: neyther is to bee feared, least being thrust downe to hell by thee, any man might rightfully saye, Thou hast vnspoken thy promises made to mee, or that thy worde were not assured: for, it is that haue falsed my faith, and made my selfe most vnworthy of thy grace: yea verily, and for my condemnation, and thy iustification, what neede it come to reckoning vp of those faults? From the moment, my God, of this poore creatures conception, euen already had coruption catched holde: from that time, saye, that my mother hauing conceyued mee, did giue mee liuing heate in her wombe, vice was come within
me, as the roote which sithence hath brought foorth those sowre and venemous fruites,
in steade of that synceritie and puritie which thou requirest not onely outward, but to be resident in the hidden spirite and heart: and yet there was no want in thee, most good and gentle God, that this vntowardnesse was not corrected, sith thou taughtest me thy wisedome, and that not after a common customarie facion, but learning me apart, and making my spirite capable of thy most rare and exquisite mysteries, such as thou reuealest not to euery one.
what is to be done? Behold on the one side a thousande maledictions, which haue notably deserued: on the other part an infinite deapth of thy mercies, whereof thou hast giuen mee sure
For it is not in vayne, nor by mans inuention, that in solemne sacrifices, blood is sprinckled with hysope.
haue bene wet therewith, Lord, by chy commaundement, but returning to my foule vncleannesse, am verely become leprous within: And therefore Lord, take that very hysope, which is the sacrament of the liuely power force of that sacrifice so long looked for, and wash me with the true blood of Christ, which shalbe shedde in the ordayned time, for cleansing of all iniquitie.
Washe me, sprinckle me, and rubbe me on all sides with this hysope this blood, the alone very meane to doe away the loathsome and leprous blotte of sinne: so shall become neate and white as snowe, whereas nowe am thus vile and
Alacke, you so many delights and heauenly contentments, which were wont to reioyce my conscience, causing me to finde rest in the middest of all dolours, where are you nowe? Lord, restore them to me, making me to heare thy voyce of absolution for my sinnes, comforting my poore conscience mortally wounded, and soundly setting together and knitting my bones, which are broken all to shiuers.
My God, turne away that eye and looke which is so terrible and insupportable, when thou wilt consider sinnes, and chiefely my sinnes so great and so many: Rather wipe them away Lorde, let not one of them remayne, so as they may neuer come in accompt before thee.
Lord, thou haddest once by thy singular bountie changed mee and renewed me by the great and onely grace of thy spirite, hauing framed mine vnderstanding to know thee, my iudgement to approue thee, my will to loue thee, and to take pleasure in thy commaundementes so pure holy: At once, thou haddest made me a newe creature.
But into what darkenesse haue turned this light? haue marred all, haue destroyed and ouerturned all, and therefore, God, beginne againe as it were anewe thy worke: be the creator of this inwarde man nowe the second time,
spreading forth thy force such as may pearce to the bottome of me, that thou mayest forme in me (as it were) a newe soule, detesting all sinne, giuen to whatsoeuer is good and right.
wote well, am altogether vnworthie that thou shouldest lay any hand againe to me: but, my God, reiect me not, neither depriue mee of all that feeling which thou haddest once giuen me, and whereof thou didest neuer as yet wholy bereaue me.
For know and beleeue my selfe to bee of the nomber of those whome thou wilt not loose, though haue deserued to be quite cut off.
Rather my God, in steade of taking quite from mee all that residue which thy goodnesse hath yet left mee, restore mee that againe, whereof my sinnes haue spoyled me, and settle mee once more in the assurance of my saluation, that most vnspeakeable pleasure and ioye which thou bestowest vpon thy children.
Nowe for so much as thou hast layde on my shoulders this so weightie, and withall so honourable a charge of gouerning thy people, may it please thee henceforth to impart me of thy stre~gth, and those speciall graces necessary to such a calling, wherein is requisite that haue wisedome, skill, high courage and constancie, and generally euery other vertue, not alone for mine owne vse, but also for the conduct of this folke committed to mee.
Then in steade of such lewde examples haue giuen, shall not spare to shewe foorth both in deede and worde the right way to others, and shalbe thine instrument to fetch home to thee those that runne riote the furthest out.
God, God, who onely canst and wilt deliuer out of the
bondes of sinne and death, haue pitie on this murderer embrued with innocent blood, and guyltie of a thousand deaths, and vouchsafe this mouth the grace to sing howe true thou art in thy promises.
Oh, that thy mercy, Lorde, woulde open this mouth which my sinnes haue shut vpon me: for what haue sinners to doe to speake of thee? But remooue this stoppe, and then not hauing any other meane to recognise so great a benefite, but such as can adde nothing to thee, who art in thy selfe absolutely perfect, to wit, the sacrifice of thankesgiuing,
shall prayse thee with full mouth, according as thou hast giuen me maruailous great occasion.
For as to those sacrifices which smoke vpon thine altar, Lord, it is not in them, where thou
wilt haue vs staye: There must be another maner of oblation to appease thine ire, and a price of better value for my ransome, yea these my faultes being not of the nomber of those, for which thou hast ordayned those ordinarie sacrifices.
It is thou, Lorde, which must prouide that price in thy good season, wherunto alone holde me confidently, offering thee yet in meane while that selfe same thing,
which thou hast giuen mee, and the which knowe thou of thy grace doest not reiect, but doest rather receiue it in so good part, as without it all outwarde seruice displeaseth thee, to witte, a spirite throughly humbled by sense of sinne, an heart contrite, brayed, and grounde with apprehension of thy iust iudgements.
What more my God? wilt thou for this indignation which thou hast co~ceyued against my misdeedes, that this worke which haue begunne by thine ordinance, should remayne vnfinished? Shall thine owne mountaine of Sion, thy holy dwelling Ierusalem bee left thus vnperfect, because Dauid made himselfe vnworthy to laye to his so foule handes? No, Lorde, thy good pleasure can not bee of that minde.
This buylding was ordayned of thee, because thou so wouldest:
also Lord, thou shalt finishe it, as in trueth it is thy worke, and not of men.
Then both I, who haue thus grossely fayled, and my people whome thou hast chastised by taking thy Spirite from their king, shall all see the effect of thy mercy,
that is to saye, thy seruice well and rightly set vp, the oblations made as appertayneth, the altars smoking according to the rule by thee ordayned, euen a most certaine testimonie of that fauour which thou shalt haue shewed to thy poore seruant Dauid, and to thy people.
Eternal God, it is now high tyme for thee to heare the prayer of thy poore desolate Church, whose distresses sithe they force her not to speake, but to cry with a full voyce, let not her crie vanish in the aire, but come to thee, who art euery where to heare such as call to thee.
The darke day of affliction is come: alas, cast vpon mee thy looke of compassion, that may scatter this most thicke darknesse.
Pardon, my God, my rude vnmannerlinesse, and beare with mee that in this pressing neede once more pray the bending of thine eare, and thy speede to make mee feele howe
thou hast heard me, answering mee by the experience of thy bountie and mercie.
Alas, time was when was faire florishing vnder thy fauourable gentlenesse, now am not so, my good dayes are past, as a smoking vapour: haue bene mightie and in flower of my stre~gth against all aslaultes within and without, abiding still fast by meanes of thine vnderpropping and stay: nowe my bones are cracked and weare into dust, as if they had bene seared and burned like lime in a kilne.
That wonted courage so stoute against Sathan and his complices, is now withered as haye, and dryed like grasse cut down by the mower.
had, alas, so good an appetite and fedde my selfe hungerly with that so nourishing, so sweete, and so
delicate viande wherewith thou didest furnish vs from aboue, and dranke in so great draughtes of that so precious and well relised liquor of thy quickening water: Nowe finde a dearth of this bread, and the small remaine that haue therof, goeth downe with mee against the stomacke, so low am brought, and haue lost my taste.
The ayre was wont to resounde from East to West, those sonnets of gladnesse, whereof thou didest minister to mee both the matter and the making.
Nowe the heauens and the earth doe ring of my lamentable cryes, woe begone that am lying on the ground,
and languishing like her that hath nothing left, but the skinne bounde to the bones.
worlde where was not lodged in palaces most beautifull and princely, which thou haddest so well founded, buylded, and trimmed for mee: in which tooke pleasure to see thee in thy great beautie, and to be recreated with thy most cleare and cheerefull voyce, (in deede a heauenly happinesse:) Nowe nothing is to be seene but ruines, in which hardly can discrye some appearance of that which hath bene: euery where are horrible desertes, hydeous caues, wherein nothing is heard but the howlings of shricke owles, night rauens, and such like dolefull and vnlucky blacke night birdes.
And poore soule, wandring through thickest of this desert, hauing no rest day nor night, dwell all alone, hatching my griefes at a
venture vnder couert of such small retraict as may light vpon.
yet in steade that my desolation shoulde cleaue the heart of the most hardened, and mooue the fellest of them, if not to relieue me, at least not to persecute me further.
see nothing but enemies rounde about mee, and what maner enemies: First, that great deuouring Lyon, which hath spoyled, torne, and swallowed so many of my poore children from the beginning of the worlde: Then those Inchanters which by their coloured wordes and reasons, in very deede vnreasonable, set together by their bibble habble, haue suborned very many of my childre~, yea, some of the best wittes of my companie.
masking like pastours, paunches belching out sacriledges, deuouring, God, thy people as bread, smallowing vp the poore widowes and orphanes vnder shadowe of prayer.
What shall say, Lord, of them that are yet worse, to witte, these cursed ones, which gnawe mee within my bowels, these heretiques, murderers, rending in pieces the members from the bodie, whereof thou art head? Very soule quellers, coniured enemies against thy trueth, turners vpside downe of thy right wayes, mouthes for the father of lyes, folke without shame or co~science, rasers vnder the name of buylders: to bee short, the most pernitious enemies that haue.
Alas, this is not all, there is no crime which they laye not to my charge,
not it selfe against mee: am the daughter of peace, and yet charge they me as mother and nource of al hurliburlies that tosse and tomble the world.
Patience is my marke, and yet am accused as a stirrer of all sedition: keepe a schoole of all trueth, yet am condemned as a lyar, and the fountaine of leasings: praye for my very enemies, yet will they needes make me vengeable and irreconcilable.
my blessed children, whose soules by the crueltie of my desperate enemies haue bene thrust into heaue~ through all sortes of torments, and of whom the worlde was not worthie, ioyne your testimonies before the eternal God, vnto the complaintes of your poore widowe mother languishing yet in earth.
ye waters, whose streames haue bene oft stopped, and their hue changed by the poore murdered bodies: ayre, which hast receyued so many of their grones and sighes: yee flames which haue consumed so many martyrs to the trueth: yee smordes, which haue wounded, hewen, and chopt off so many of my members, are ye not sufficient witnesses to me, that complayne not without most iust cause? And yet my God, it is not of thee that thus playne me: for, if looke vpon the faults of my children, confesse, that what rigor soeuer they haue felt, that yet thy mercie surmountes thy iudgement: And considering on the other side, that the wicked doe not hate and persecute me but for thy name, and that thereby am made like vnto my deare
Oh father, so farre am from complayning, that contrariwise this crosse is to me a most certaine and pretious testimonie, that thou chastisest mee as a father, and louest mee with the same loue, wherewith thou louest my spouse, with whome being crucified, am likewise sure to raygne.
To bee short, wherein can deeme my self honourable, but in thy crosse? for, to bee hated of the worlde for thy sake, is a goodly testimonie, that a man is not of the worlde: and to drinke in the cuppe of his Lorde, is one of the greatest honours that the seruant can receiue.
But alas, see and confesse, that what the wicked doe vniustly, thou doest it iustly for the iniquitie of most part of my riotous children, it being a thing
right reasonable, that the bringing into order beginne at thine owne house, and that they which haue least excuse, bee with the first most rigorously chastised.
Moreouer, my God, what cause haue to put on all my wayling weede,
seeing thy holy name so blasphemed, thine house prophaned, robbed, ruined, and brought into ashes, thy glorie giuen into the handes of enemies? Loe why lye on the earth, liuing on the dust in stead of meate, and teares for drinke, through the deepe conceyuing of this most horrible indignation, and this so iust displeasure against mee, whome thou hast thus ouerthrowen, from a state wherein thou hadest superexalted mee, in so much as goe fading away, and lost as a shadowe
at Sunne fall, and am there as cut downe grasse without force or liuelinesse.
But what? yet am not out of heart, mightie and eternall God, when consider that thou art for euer the same, and that it can not be otherwise, but the memorie of thy renoume must be euer durable.
For, this presupposed, albeit thou art not vnderpropped but of thy selfe,
and that nothing may bee put too, or taken from thee: Yet, sith it hath liked thee to chose from out of the vnworthiest creature, to wit, man, a certaine number, which is thy Church, there to make thine infinite glory for euer to shine: conclude with my selfe, that of necessitie (howsoeuer it seemes sometimes otherwise) as thou hast bene cast downe in thy Church, nowe
lying on the grounde, so wilt thou rayse againe thy selfe, in vprearing her, and all for thy great pitie and compassion sake.
In deede, Lord, thou hast so promised, and many a time effected it.
For, into what streights was thy Church brought during that horrible slauerie of Egypt, their pilgrimage in the wildernesse, their calamities befalling them vnder the Iudges, the captiuitie of thine Arke, the renting of Iudah and Israel, the dreadfull destruction by Babel, when there remayned not one stone vpon another: thine holy Temple was made an heape of dust, the sacred vessels were sacrilegiously rauined, caried away, and profanely abused: thy sacrificers murdered, the crowne of Dauid tombled to the grounde, all the lande dyed with blood,
without regarde of age, sexe, or degree: the small residue dragged into bondage among all the nations of the worlde, vnder so many calamities, among the Syrians and Egyptians: and aboue al, when thy temple being reedified, thou departedst out of it, and gauest roome as it were to Idoles in thine owne palaces: and when thy lawe, saye, thy most sacred lawe was so villanously interdicted, torne, and burnt, and as it were, quite abrogated by consent of most part of thy people iustly abandoned of thee? Nowe after this horrible and dreadfull destruction of mine auncient children thus cut off, and when thou gauest mee a newe generation, alas, of what rages and cruelties had experiment for the space of three hundreds of yeeres one after another? Yet euer at mine extremest neede thou didest sende mee Champions, and madest me to finde force in feeblenesse, calme in tempest, felicitie in misery, life in death: Thou didest, say, euermore cause mee to see what differe~ce there is betwene that fatherly rodde wherewith thou correctest thy children to saluation, that yron barre wherewith thou dashest thine enemies past all recouerie.
Egypt, Niniue, Babel, and this loftie image of the monarchies teared by my ruines, and cymented with my childrens blood, are nowe come downe, while yet thy poore Sion standes and speakes.
Thou, God, euermore most like thy selfe, nowe that thou seest me more streyghted then euer, shewe that thou hast set boundes to my miseries, as thou didest in olde time to
Rayse vp some Iosuahs, and Esdras, some Nehemiahs and Constantines, which may reare againe thy rased palaces, taking pitie on our ruines and sackinges.
Aboue all, Lord, sende vs some Aarons and some Esdras, hauing thy spirite in their heart, and thy worde in their mouth, as true instruments of thy power, to rayse againe this thy spirituall buylding which is throwen to the grounde, and so disfigured, as with much a doe can a man tracke out so much as the very auncient foundation: And blesse, Lorde,
the hande and the labours of thy faithfull workemen, so as in steade of so many peoples at this day reuolted from thee, some forced by Mahomet, others seduced by false pastors, profaning the chayre
all may bee brought backe againe to thee, in such wise, that thy glory may shine more then euer,
and thy heauenly Sion, that workemanship of thine owne very hande, may be lifted vp againe to her former brightnesse.
Heare, mightie God, the prayer of thy poore desolate daughter,
Giue me matter to couche in my recordes this most excellent deliuerance, to the ende that the memorie may dure without ende, and that this people beyng throughly renewed,
may haue occasion to magnifie thy prayse from father to sonne.
Bring againe that golden worlde, wherein one may saye with better speede then euer, that thou,
eternall God, being set in thy high throne, aduaunced aboue the heyghtes of heauens, hast cast thy cheerefull gracious eye vpon the earth,
giuing eare to the grones of thy languishing captiue Church, and of thy poore children looking for nothing but the slaughter.
Gather againe together, Lord, the sheepe wildly straying and scattered through the wildernesse, full of hungerbitten and starke wood Lyons and Tygers.
Vnite againe to thee the realmes which Sathan hath withdrawen, sith thou art King of kings, to whome all glorie, puissaunce, and magnificence belongs.
Let thy name be called on, and thy prayse proclaymed in Ierusalem in sight and knowledge of all the worlde.
Well then, haue bene afflicted a thousande and a thousande sortes, my course hath bene cutte in two, my dayes haue bene, as it were shortened:
haue bene constrayned to beseeche my God, that he would not plucke me away with such violence, and that he would suffer mee to finish my rare: But considering the eternitie of my God, for euer himselfe, this chaunge doeth no longer amaze mee, knowing that my foundations are layde farre more surely, then if they were buttrised by the heauen or by the earth:
For, though the earth be substantially setled by the maruailous power of him that layde the foundation, and that this heauenly frame, the very workemanshippe of the eternall God, hath neuer yet swerued among so many, so violent, and
continuall reuolutions, yet al within measure and compasse so exquisite,
as none can amende: Neuerthelesse must all this geare passe away one daye, it being so determined: and this goodly shewe shall vanish as wee see a garment by litle and litle waxe old and weare away.
But thou, mightie God, absolute in thy selfe, hast neyther ende nor beginning, but exempting thy selfe from all chaunge, thou declarest thy power in the varietie of thy workes.
And for so much as am stayed vpon this thy permanent power, vnchangeable good will, assured, saye, vpon that throne, whereof thy Sonne my redeemer hath taken possession, to make mee his coheire through the mercy, integritie, obedience, satisfaction and
merite wherewith he purchased me the celestiall kingdome: am certainly resolued, that this stayednesse will vpholde mee, and that through all the tempestes, by which it pleaseth thee to leade mee, for the manifestation of thy bountie and power in conseruation of thine, shall yet arriue in that eternal hauen, wherein all we, whome thou allowest for thy seruantes, though neuer so vnprofitable, beyng borne age after age, and whome thou shalt acknowledge for true children of Abraham, Isaak, and Iacob, with whom thou contractedst the couenant of eternall life, shal haue our dwelling worlde without ende, Amen.
My poore soule, fall not flatte downe, vexe not thy selfe out of measure: the burden of thy sinnes presseth thee sore in deede, but bee not for al that, quite ouerwhelmed: thou art thrust downe so low into ye deepest deepes, yt thou hadest neede cry lowde for to bee heard of him, which dwelleth in the hyghest heights: And the euer burning hell fire is not farre from that lake, whither thine iniquities haue plunged thee, so as thou mayest, as it were, perceiue the Echo of their cryes desperat howlings, which be there caft without al hope of euer co~ming forth.
But the Lord which bringes euen to the borders of hell his best
beloued, when they forget themselues, knowes also howe well to bring them backe again.
Goe no further then downward, but lift vp thine heart together with thy crye, and saye not in thy selfe, God hath reiected mee from before him, for, such la~guage God likes not.
Thou cryest vnto God, and wherefore, but onely because hee hath awakened thee? For loe, what he cryeth in thine eares: My people, what haue done to thee? or wherein haue grieued or yrked thee?
my God, what shall answere thee hereto? He which receyueth the offence, goeth first about to excuse him: The Iudge falleth a beseeching of the guyltie partie: and what can say, my God, but that can not comprehende that which thou doest for me, who could not so
much as haue any being, hadest not thou made mee? And after thou hadest made mee, either forgat all that thou hadest done for mee, or els the remembrance thereof representing vnto mee mine vnthankefulnesse, astonisheth my sense, and stoppeth my mouth.
Rather thou thy selfe Lord, declare vnto me what thou hast done for mee, so as may neure forget it.
Thou madest mee of nothing in the person of my first father, and is it not somewhat to be made somewhat of nothing? Thou hast facioned mee in my mothers wombe, thou hast taken mee from thence, as it were by thine owne proper handes: thou hast suckled, nourished and brought mee vp, by raysing vp vnto mee such as did it according to that will and habilitie, which thou gauest them.
this infancie, from howe many harmes didst thou defend me? In so much as owe thee euen so many liues, as haue passed dayes and houres, minutes and moments: and yet during all that age, neyther could knowe my selfe, whereby to know how much ought thee, nor yet thee, whereby to thanke thee for it.
What other thing then did stirre thee to do well by me, but onely thy goodnesse? Passing further on in yeeres, mine vnworthinesse grewe on together with mine age, and thy largesse on the other side grewe so much the more, hauing bestowed abundantly on mee not onely witte, health, and so many other giftes of vse in this life, which also thou bestowest liberally sometime on thy greatest enemies: but thou hast imparted to mee the knowledge of thy
sauing health by thy deare Sonne our Lorde Iesus Christ: Thou comfortedst me in a thousand afflictions, thou hast borne with mee in tenne thousande sinnes, thou hast vpholden me in innumerable temptations: shortly, thou neuer ceasedst by thy bountie to fight against my malice, and against my rebellion by thy patience.
Loe, what thou hast done to me, Lorde: Nowe what is it that haue done againe? Alas, my God,
if enter into this deapth of ripping vp mine iniquities, whereof any one sufficeth to make me guiltie of eternall death, surely am quite vndone.
can then doe nothing else, but beseeche thee to heare my cries: and thou wilt do it, Lorde.
For, Lorde God, who coulde euer haue abiden before thee, if thou, hadest
taken the lawe on his sinnes? Take heart againe, my soule, for thy Iudge is the fountaine of compassion, otherwise there were none order to serue and beseeche him, but all in vaine.
It is true, thou hast lauished out his riches, but thy God is as riche, and as farre from nigardlinesse as euer: Thou hast thralled thy selfe to sinne and death, but thy God hath redeemed thee with a more then sufficient ransom: Saye rather with that poore vnthrift,
goe to my father: hee will receiue thee without casting thee in the teeth, yea rather he will reioyce of thy returne, hee wayteth to embrace thee with his mercy.
Doe not as did Adam, who ranne away from his face whome hee had offended: Should the sicke man flee the Phisition? Whither shoulde a poore
body goe, but to him that will and can helpe him? Hee hath giuen his Sonne for thee, and will he nowe reiect thee? Weenest thou that Iesus Christ, who hath bought thee so deere,
wil now lose thee? Waite for his grace rather, and if hee be slowe to reache his hande, consider that thou slackest much more thy turning to him.
Doubt not of his wil, sith both in his worde, and in his dealing towardes thee, thou hast yet more cleare and euident testimonies thereof, then thou hast of his might.
Be rather in thy warde, watching alwayes, without being weary or slumbering,
vntill he appeare as the dawning of the day, chasing away the darkenesse wherein thou art plunged.
example and aduise, goe we all my brethren to that great eternall God, ioyning together with the acknowledgement of our faultes, hope, which neuer disappoynteth them that haue it, being setled vpon his infallible trueth.
If our sinnes bee innumerable, his mercie is infinite towardes the repenting, beleeuing, hoping, and praying.
Will wee haue any other proofe hereof, then that incomprehensible loue, wherethrough this good father was mooued, euen not to spare his sonne? Then this infinite loue of this great shepheard, which made himselfe of none accompt, to enriche vs? Who hath charged himself with al our sinnes, not one except? Who was obedient for his poore Israel, that is to saye, his elect, euen to that death of the
crosse? embrace thee with both mine armes, Iesus Christ, which hast reconciled me to the Father, assuring me by thy Spirite, of the comfort of my saluation in thee, and so fast embracing thee, receiue the pledges of life and euerlasting blisse.
Eternall God, listen to my prayer, hearken to my request, heare mee, for thyne assured trustines byndeth thee to holde that which thy goodnes hath promised: And what can alleadge herein, but thyne owne selfe? for not alone,
poore and woe begone sinner that am, but no man aliue going about to debate his cause with thee, as though he had right on his side, shal be found righteous.
Wherefore, in stead of pleading condemne and iudge my self: bring thee nothing of myne owne but iniquitie, and craue that which is thyne, to wit, grace and mercy.
my God, thou seest, alas, my piteous estate: myne enemyes and thyne pursue me for life, which already lyeth as is were in the dust, at their mercy: am euen nowe in the darkenes of death, yea am as a Carion long since dead and stinking.
Alas, my spirit is so perplexed, that it cannot resolue nor winde it selfe out.
Both vnderstanding and hart are quite lost within me: wherupon bethought mee of so many auncient testimonyes and experiments which haue had of thy benignitie and fauour from mine infancie, and stayde my selfe vpon consideration of the high workes of thy handes, euen true euidences of thine infinite wisedome and bounty together, towardes the very least of thy creatures: and namely beheld
in my spirit thine high actes on behalfe of thy welbeloued,
This incouraged me, my God, to stretche foorth myne handes to thee: this say,
strengthened my poore conscience to addresse it selfe to thee, yea with more burning desire, then euer the most parched ground gaped for the moysture of thy rayne.
But what is to be done? Euen forthwith haste thee, answere me eternal God,
for ca~ endure no longer: Beholde me dead, lying in the dust of the graue, vnlesse thou shew forth that cheerefull eye which with one onely looke can reuiue the dead: without the sound of thy most gentle voyce, am cast away: make it then to sounde and sound agayne in mine eares, in mine heart, for
am of ye number of those to who~ thou hast bound thy selfe, no whit, alas, for any merit of mine, but thine only free mercy.
am, say, one of those by thy grace, to wit, of those which hope for yt which thou hast promised, giuen them grace to beleeue: without this wot not where to become, nor which way to turne me.
And therefore, high God, prepare my selfe to thee, that thou mightest teache me which way to holde:
thou seest howe mine enemies hemme me in: deliuer me, eternall, who alone canst and wilt do it, for so much as haue no refuge but vnder thy couert.
Alas, weened with my selfe to haue seene many trim starting holes: agayne am tempted to assay infinite meanes.
Hence from mee, thou vnwise wit, foolish wisedome, vnreasonable reason, and all ye passions which can doe nought but cary me headlong on mine owne heade.
It is thou, Lord, that will hold, hold fast for my God: consequently,
And because can neither vnderstand this will, nor take pleasure to followe it when haue vnderstood it, teach it me, Lord, and leade me in it, not alone to knowe it, but also to practise it, Let thy good spirit be my loads man in the right way,
and not that tempting spirit, nor yet flesh and blood.
Vp nowe then my poore spirit hitherunto desolate: comfort thy selfe, for the eternall will drawe comfort forth of him selfe to reuiue
shee, because it hath pleased him that his name should be called vpon in thee, and according to his infinite bounty will deliuer thee out of all anguishes.
Doeth Sathan amase thee? hee hath vanquished him for thee.
Doth the corruption of thy nature astonish thee? the sonne of God making him selfe man hath fully sanctified it for thee.
Doe thy sinnes affright thee which be fruits of this corruption? He hath borne them all vpon the tree, and hath payd for thy discharge: which more is, his righteousnesse is thine, sith he himselfe is thine.
Art thou afrayde of men, sith God is for thee? Doth death affray thee? it is vanquished and turned into an entry of life.
Beholde then all thine enemies scattered, behold quite vnder foote, all such as
afflicted thee within and without, because the Lorde alloweth thee for one of his seruants and houshold.
Amen. [leaf motif] Imprinted at London in Bacon house by Christopher Barker, Printer to the Queenes most excellent Maiestie.

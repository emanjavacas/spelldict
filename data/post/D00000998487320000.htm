That is to say, a godly and learned Exposition of
other moe Psalmes of the princely Prophet Dauid: beginning with the
Psalme, being the last part of the first Tome, or one halfe of the booke of Psalmes.
Written in Latin by the reuerend Doctor Victorinus Strigelius: professor of Diuinity in the Vniuersity of Lipsia in Germanie.
continue forth thy louing kindnesse to them that know thee: and thy righteousnesse vnto them that are true of hart.
Hope thou in the Lord and keepe his way, and he shall promote thee: that thou shalt possesse the land, when the vngodly shal perish thou shalt see it.
AT LONDON, Printed by P.S. for Matthew Lownes, and are to be sold at his shop vnder S. Dunstons Church in the West.
To the Right Reuerend father in God, Richard by Gods prouidence Bishop of London; To the Right Honorable Sir Richard Saltonstall Knight, Lord Maior of London; and to the Right worshipful his Brethren the Aldermen and Sheriffes of the same City: grace, mercy, peace and plenitude of temporall and eternall beatitude in the sacred Trinity.
OUR Lord and Sauiour Christ Iesus (right reuerend Father in God, honorable Lord, and right worshipful Patrons) as hee rightly called himselfe the way, the truth, and the life of all faithfull beleeuers and good liuers, and was so in deed: the way by example not erring; the truth, by promise not failing; and the life by reward neuer ending: so on a time ascending up a certaine hill (after he had in a prolix sermon instructed his Disciples, and a multitude of others his followers in the way, truth, and life of perfect blessednesse vpon earth, and the fruitfull effects thereof in the life euerlasting) said vnto them; yee are the salt of the earth, the light of the world: As it might well seeme attributing the first title salt of the earth vnto his disciples, as they which (with the table of the Testament) deliuering sincere doctrine, it (with the pot of Manna) ministring the sacraments by Christs institution (seasoning the soules of Gods seruants) and (with Aarons rod) executing discipline vpon disordered liuers within the Church: And by the second title, light of the world, fully attributing vnto temporal magistrates (as to the learned in the lawes divine humane) the light of righteousnes, sword of truth, and ballance of iustice, with iudgement to cherish the good and punish the euill liuers in the common wealth.
And so making of both a blessed and happy coniunction or incorporation of good gouernement, hee added hereunto this rare and notable conclusion, citty that is set on a hill cannot be hid: signifieng thereby a Citty so gouerned, is a right Hieropolis or sacred Citty; and a kingdome so administred is a right Hierarchia or sacred principalitie, knowne, beloued of friends; feared and made famous among enemies both neare and far off.
Such in truth (blessed bee the true omnipotent and immortall God) hath been the happy state of this citty of London, yea and whole kingdome of England, though low insituation, yet high in acceptation with God and good people of all nations: vnto which as a poore member thereof God be my witnes, defender, Iudge, and reuenger) haue alwaies wished well in goodwill, goodworde, and good workes (to my poore power,) so eleuen yeares nowe past signified the same specially by translating the learned Vrbanus Rhegius his godlie exposition vpon the
Psalme, intituled the Solace of Sion and ioy of Ierusalem; and dedicating the same vnto the then Right Honorable Sir George Barne Knight, Lord Maior of this Citty, who thankfully accepted my good wil therein.
For it carried this credit with it, Her foundations are vpon the holy hils, and holy, innocent and the best members of this our Church and common wealth have profited thereby doubt not: But nowe if there bee any vnholy, nocent and bad persoyet remaining, either within or without the gates of that Hierusalem or vision of peace, (as God which once promised to search it doth best see; for man seeth not as God seeth.
(whereof too many haue found as can conuince) pray to God humbly and hartely these either speedely (if it be his heauenly holy will) to conuert by doctrine and discipline in the church; or (if so they will not bee conuertible) at his good pleasure, in his iustice and iudgement, to subuert them perseuering in their malignities inflexible.
In the meane time with all humble and hartifull duty commend this my present poore labour to the aduancement of Gods glory ineffable, hir maiesties continuall honour, and your honours and worships fauorable protection; first as vnto that Aaron whose sincere doctrine with example of life, and discipline as your rod (which God long make to bud and blossome in blessednes,) and consequently as vnto that Mercury which tuning this my harp in right concord of goodwil (as deliuer it may sende the sweete solace thereof from your sincere brests, not vnto an earthly Apollo to regratifie you with an earthlie scepter, but to the heauenly Iehoua, who may best rewarde you with all abundance of heauenly happines in the life euerlasting, which God for his sonne Christs sake grant vnto your honors and worships.
At my poore house in S. Brides parish in fleetstreet, this
Your honorable good Lordships, and worthy worships, humble poore Orator.
Psalme or Song of Dauid demonstratiue touching the wonderfull mercies of God towardes his Church, in respect of his pormises, graces, and victories which he giueth her: and it is exhortatorie: that his Church should therefore prayse God for euer.
THIS Psalme is a glorious and plentifull prophecie, touching the resurrection and triumph of Christ in his ascension, touching his gift of the holy ghost, his gathering of the Church by the ministry of the Apostles, the destruction of the Iewish policy or state, and the benefits of his new and euerlasting kingdome.
And like as the fine verses of Poets do edifie, vttered from a sincere and sacred brest: So no doubt of it, Dauids penne in the writing of this Psalme was filled with spirituall ioy, which exceedeth all capacitie and consideration of man: For he vseth not a simple kinde of phrase describing the magnificence of Christes kingdome, but most with figures hee describeth euen as it were the triumphant pompe of this King: For he frameth his beginning of impracation or cursing, and of gratulation or reioycing: For hee curseth the enemies of Christ; but he reioyceth at the welfare of the godly ones.
The declaration of the Psalme comprehendeth the description of the pompe, The Lord commeth and bringeth with him his hoast of them which preach the Gospell: Out of these are described the Apostles and Bishops as it were Princes of prouinces or countries, which do comfort and refresh these countries afflicted and persecuted: The Lord ascendeth vpon high, hee leadeth in his triumph the captiues, hee distributeth his gifts vnto his soldiours and people, and threatneth punishment vnto his enemies: The people go before, and one commeth after which singeth the song of triumph.
This is almost the scope of this Psalme: which let the godly ones reade not so much for the wonderfull and delectable diuine excellencie of eloquence wherewith it aboundeth. [leaf motif]The Psalme and Exposition thereof.
[Ver&se. Let God arise, and let his enemies bee scattered; Let them also that hate him flee before him.
[Ver&se. Like as the smoake vanisheth, so shalt thou driue them away: and like as the waxe melteth at the fire, so let the vngodly perish at the presence of God.
LIKE as the next Psalme following describeth Christ humbled upon the Crosse; and (by reason of our sinnes) sirtuing with most bitter sorrowes: in this Psalme setteth forth Christ risen from death to life and gloriously sitting at the right hande of his Father: He beginneth then with the effects of the most ioyfull resurrection of Christ; namelie by the destruction and scattering abroad of his enemies, and by the reuiuing or restoring of his church: as if he said, when Christ was dead and buried, not onlie the blind and raging Iewes leaped for ioy, but also the Deuill and his companions, namelie sinne and death, triumphed at full, as if Christ shoulde so for euer remaine in the graue.
But this graund guide of life the third daie rising againe had a glorious triumph ouer the Iewes, and the whole kingdome of the Deuill, often times repeating that saying of the Prophet Osea cap.
death will be thy death, graue will be thy destruction.
For although the stubborne and vncurable Iewes carried stately mindes as then, and resisted the Apostles with a malignant countenance: yet in the xl. yeare after Christes resurrection, they suffered grieuous and iust punishmentes for their outrages.
And the kingdome of the deuill, sinne and death is so broken and crushed in peeces by Christ, that it can bring no danger vnto the godlie ones: Let vs therefore with S. Paule sing this triumph song
death where is thy sting, graue where is thy victory? The sting of death is sinne, and the strength of sinne is the Law: But thankes be to God which hath giuen vs victory, through our Lorde Iesus Christ.
And what is more elegant then the describing of these enemies which he here vseth, comparing them unto smoke and ware? Great is the pride of smoke when it bursteth out of the top of the chimney and his spreading heat couereth the ayre.
So an Image of waxe maketh both a terrible shew of grauitie of hardnes; but as the smoke which séemeth to pearce the verie firmament is scattered by the wind here and there: and as the image of ware laide to the fire melteth quite awaie: So the enemies of the Gospell and of the Church (by the breath of Christes mouth, which is both winde and flame) are either healed, or taken vtterlie awaie and destroied altogether: So in like maner, Athanasius compared Iulian the Apostat vnto a little cloud, whome the Sunne within a while after should so driue away and vanquish, that no man should sée anie trace therof more: With these debasings and downfalles of the enemies of the gospell and of the church agreeth that sentence of Isay ca.
Feare ye not the reproch of men; neither be yee afraide of their rebukes. verse
For the moath shall eate them vp like a garment, and the worme shall eat them like wooll.
[Ver&s. But let the righteous be glad and reioyce before God: Let them also be merry and ioyfull.
An other effect of Christs resurrection, is the reuiuing or restoring of his Church: for as Saint Paule saith, Rom.
The kingdome of God is not meate and drinke, but righteousnesse, peace and ioy in the holie Ghost.
It is indéed Righteousnesse, as thus: frée remission of sinnes, reconciliation with God, and free acceptation vnto life euerlasting.
It is Peace thus: Tranquillitie of heart rising from faith, hope a good conscience.
Finallie, it is Ioy, thus: Consolation, which is the vanquisher of all feares and doubtings: All these benefites are the effects of Christs passion and resurrection, which saint Paule acknowledgeth, Phil.
He hath not yet attained vnto, but he tooke (he saide) the right course whereby he might attaine vnto this reach of wisdome.
The same thing let vs also confesse and craue of God, that hee would illumine and increase in our hearts this light acknowledging the benefites of Christ.
[Ver&se. sing vnto God, and sing praises vnto his name: magnifie him that rideth vpon the heauens, as it were vpon an horse: praise him in his name, yea and reioyce before him.
Not only in the heart (saith Dauid let true knowledge of Christ shine, whereto is ioyned spirituall ioy, but let the toong also magnifie this Lord risen from death to life, and raigning for euer: who though he be the sonne of Dauid after the Sencalogie, yet is hee declared the Sonne of God by his rising from death to life, and by sending his holie spirit, as in Rom. cap.
it is said, This Lords diuinitie vnited to his humanitie, and his victorie, triumphes, and benefits, see that ye honor (saith Dauid and in them rest and sweetlie repose your selues For he doth not thumpe nor thunder it out, but is carried faire and softlie, and suffereth suters to haue easie accesse vnto him.
Let no man therefore be driuen from him, but let all and euerie one come vnto this Lord, trusting in his most swéete promise, who saith, Matth.
Come vnto me all ye that labour, and are laden, and will refresh you.
And where he saith, Magnifie him that rideth vpon the heauens, that maie be vnderstoode, Make your way before him, and is spoken as touching our true repentance not fained with amendment of life: for the first step vnto health is, To know the disease, and seeke a Phisition.
But contrariwise, it is a heauie signe, if the minde being sicke, know neither the disease, nor looketh for phisicke.
Let vs therefore acknowledge our maladies, namely, sin and death, and let vs craue to haue right medicine laide to these miseries by the phisition and sheepheard of our soules, euen the sonne of God, who came therefore into the world, to saue sinners.
[Ver&s. He is a father of the fatherlesse, and defendeth the cause of the widowes: euen God in his holy habitation.
Although the Church is doubtlesse in the world a widowe, and an Orphane (for she is both of enemies cruellie persecuted, and of false friends forsaken) yet the sonne of God leaueth her not without defence and succour, but partly nourisheth her with inward consolation (which is called here, His holie habitation, and partly he prouideth for her some resting place for succor, and giueth her Halcion daies, that she may happily naurish and bring up her birds.
Hither to pertaineth that notable saying of the sonne of God, Ioh.
ver. will not leaue you comfortlesse, but will come vnto you: will aske my father, and he shall giue you another comforter, euen the spirit of truth, which shal abide with you for euer.
And whatsoeuer is true touching the whole bodie, the same may in like maner bee applied of all the members thereof: For to let passe the examples of other Orphnaes, and speak of my selfe, surely euen me (who haue beene left an Orphane euen from the verie thirde yeare of my age) hath Christ the sonne of God succoured and helped, not onely with things necessarie for my bodie, as meate and drinke, defence from harme, good health, and honest residence or dwelling place among men, &c. but also vnto these adding greater benefites, as for example, bringing me out of the kingdome of darkenesse, and translating me into the kingdome of this sonne of God, wherein wee haue by his blood full remission of our sinnes: To the end therefore a publique testimonie of my thankfulnesse may appeare, giue vnto this father of Orphans, Iudge of widowes causes, so great thanks as my mind is able to conceiue for his cherishing and mainteining of mee so manie yeares, and for his benefits necessarilie bestowed vpon me, both for, my bodie and soule which in the life to come euerlasting, shall more feruently commemorate, and magnifie his name therefore.
[Ver&s. He is the God that maketh men to bee of one mind in an house, and bringeth the prisoners out of captiuity: but letteth the runnagates continue in scarcenesse.
is called not without cause, The euerlasting father, because in all ages by the ministerie of his worde and sacraments, hee regenerateth many vnto life euerlasting, whom the Church fostereth and bringeth vp, and so is shee made of a barren or solitarie woman, a mother of manie children: according to the prophesie of Isay.
Reioyce barren that diddest not beare, breake foorth into ioy and 'reioyce, thou that diddest not trauell with childe, for the desolate hath mo children then the married wife hath.
Of this consolation the godlie ones haue néede, least they take offence at the small number of true beleeuers, and the great number of other sectes.
Also this Lord in time conuenient setteth Captiues at libertie, that is, not in such sort as we thinke, but in his meruailous prouidence, as in the Psalme it is saide, The Lord knoweth how to deliuer his holy one, verse
And the prison out of which we are deliuered, as S. Paule saith Cor.
For the godlie ones for most part are tossed with inwarde and outwarde stormes of calamities, and at length getting out of the great stormes of trouble do see their wished hauen: But the vngodlie ones and disobedient persons hee despiseth as the base gotten children of this worlde, neither chasteningnor comforting them till they come to vtter destruction.
[Ver&se God, when thou wentest forth before the people: when thou wentest through the wildernes: [Ver&se The earth shooke, and the heauens dropped at the presence of God: euen as Syna also was moued at the presence of God, which is the God of Israell.
[Ver&se Thou God sentest a gratious raigne vppon thine inheritance: and refreshed it when it was weary.
Hitherto hath hee made the hearer or learner attentiue and docible, as in beginnings it is a thing vsuall: nowe goeth he to the height of the cause, namelie into the place mentioning of Christ and the Gospell, and compareth the publishing of the lawe, with the propagation of the gospell, where he saith, When thou publishedst the lawe, the earth was in one place moued, and the heauens dropped at thy presence: But now that the gospell by preaching is spread abroad of the Apostles, all the whole earth is moued: as in Haggias the Prophet it is said cap.
Yet a little while wil shake the heauens, the earth, the sea, and the drie land, &c. and a gracious raine is powred vpon all parts of the world, where by the Church is gathered both from among the Iewes and Gentiles, and is watered as it were the inheritance of God.
And what is there more sweete, then that the preaching of the Gospel is not onely compared vnto thunder, but vnto raine also? For like as the earth bringeth forth fruit, partlie made warme with the heate of the sunne, and partly watered with raine and waters: So the Church is refreshed and recreated of the holie Ghost by the ministerie of the Gospell.
Let no man therefore kéepe backe this raine from his Orchardes, but let euen all our furrowes, and glebe landes receyue the same with great desire: That is, let our hearts without loathing and surfetting heare the doctrine of the Gospel, that they may take thereby most ample fruit and profite.
The Gospell is the power of God vnto saluation for al that beleeue.
Further, more Christ is here called the God of Sinay, of Israel, by reason of the testimonies of his manifestations or appearings made in mount Sinay, and in this people: For the pollicie or gouernment of Moyses was no other thing, but a storehouse of diuine appearences and witnesses.
[Ver&s. Thy congregation shall dwell therein: for thou God of thy goodnes hast prouided for the poore.
Christ is our sheepheard because hee teacheth vs, comforteth, gouerneth and defendeth vs, healeth vp our woundes, and finallie carieth vs lying as it were vpon his shoulders; not pretermitting anie kinde of dutie which a faithfull shéep, heard might vse, or is able to bestowe upon sillie and weake shéepe: Let vs therefore remember in our dailie prayer that we are the shéepe of this shéepheard, and let vs run for succour vnto him; and let vs craue helpe, gouernement and defence of and from him: But touching this purpose haue spoken sufficiently inough in the xxiii.
[Ver&se. The Lord gaue the word; great was the company of the Preachers.
saith, The lawe was giuen by the ministry of Angels, but the preaching of the Gospel was immediatly published by the sonne of God, and commended to his Apostles as an excellent gift and treasure of great price.
For although the world outraglouslie despise the preachers and teachers of the Gospell, and iudgeth them as Paule saith
as gasing stockes vnto the worlde: yet in verie truth, the chiefest and greatest blessing vppon earth is, when men may heare the preachers and teachers stirred vp by God to aduance and set forth the doctrine of the Gospell, wherein true acknowledgement of God and prayer vnto him are shewed, which are the consolation of mens mindes and direct rules of good life.
[Ver&se Kings with their armies did flee and were discomfited: and they of the houshold deuided the spoile.
giueth charge vnto the Apostles and to the teachers of the gospell, That they haue salt in themselues; that is, to retaine the puritie of doctrine, and to be at vnitie and concord amongst themselues.
Christ in his agonie praieth, that, God would sanctifie vs in his truth: and make vs to be one in him: For the chiefe ornaments of Gods church are purity of doctrine, and concord of teachers: So in this place the Psalme affirmeth, that the Apostles shoulde be all of one minde, and not trouble their godlie consent with Ambition or other foolish
But how rare a thing such concord is amongst the other teachers, not onlie ancient histories, but also the examples of this age sufficientlie declare.
Eusebius bishop of sorrowed in seeing Basill to prosper, and oppressed him what hee could.
Betwéen Epiphanius and Chrysostome there was such a contention and controuersie, that Epiphanius in heate of anger said, Thou shalt not die Chrysostome within thy iurisdiction.
And Chrysostome made and answere, That Epiphanius should not return aliue into his country.
To these cursings or gainsayings the euent it selfe answered.
For Epiphanius sayling into the Ile of Cyprus died before he came thither: Chrysostome not long after was banished his Country.
S. Hierome framed his inuectiue against Ruffinus with whom hee liued manie yeares most louinglie and most familiarlie.
But why do recite olde examples, séeing this our age aboundeth with such examples? For like as with Epaminundas prince of Thebes the liberty or freedome of his country was also buried, and vtterlie extinguisht: euen so, when D: Luther departed this life and was buried, then also ceased the concord of teachers.
For nowe, Some not with learned speach co~tend: But with euil tearms their cause defend; as the Poet Ennius saith.
And the teachers, like vnto Cadmeys brethren, striue one against another with hatred, ambition and slanders.
Therefore more are the subtle deceits of false brethren to be feared, then the enterprises and practises of our enemies.
But cut short this complaint, and beseech God to cure our wounds and to restore vnto his Church a godly and prosperous concord.
And further it is not indeed a thing obscure to consider why the Apostles and Bishoppes are here called Kinges with their hoasts because they fight the battels against the Diuels and their instrumentes; and are furnished not with brasen péeces, but with the word and prayer.
For the sonne of God armeth and setteth forth his soldiours with a mouth and wisedome, which all the enemies are not able to resist, Luke
The weapons of our warfare are not carnall, but mighty to cast downe holds, which bringeth to captiuity euerie thought vnto the obedience of Christ, and hauing ready the vengeance against all disobedience, &c. Finally, they of the houshould That is, the spousesse or church of the son of God.
[Ver&se Though ye haue line among the pots: yet shall ye be as the winges of a Doue, that is couered with siluer wings, and her feathers like gold.
He compareth the teachers of the gospell vnto Doues of diuers colours, because of the diuersitie of giftes: For one excelleth in the knowledge of languages, an other hath the giftes of interpretation, another iudgeth right soundlie the controuersies touching opinions.
Finallie, The holie ghost giueth vnto euery one some gifts, for the building vp of the church as S. Paule saith,
He also here alludeth vnto the simplicitie of Doues, as Christ saith, Matth.
For the Doue is without gall, hurteth not with her bill, and hath harmelesse clées.
Furthermore, like as Goshawkes and kites do assault and deuoure sillie Doues: So tyrants practise all meanes they can vtterlie to subuert all godlie teachers.
The Church therefore is an hoast of doues, which are laide open for all the weapons of tyrants.
But if anie man in this place had rather applie the mixture of siluer and golden colour, vnto that shewe which polished or bright shining armour, and warlike furniture hath, with Ensignes and weapons displaied in tents where fields are fought.
[Ver&se When the almighty scattered Kings for their sake: then were they as white as snow in Salmon.
This verse admonisheth the Reader of two thinges: The first touching the vocation of ministers, concerning which in
it is saide, How shall they preach except they be sent? And in
Christ saieth, Pray ye vnto the Lord of the haruest, that hee would thrust forth workemen into the haruest.
Let vs therefore acknowledge, that the ministers which deliuer sound doctrine, are the excellent and singular giftes of God, and as it were the mothers own brests wherewith she giueth vs sucke.
Secondlie, let vs learn what is the effects of the gospell: namelie to restore light by driuing awaie most filthie darkenesse, such as are heathen and popish errors: Therefore S. Peter compareth
the scriptures propheticall vnto a lanterne with a candle giuing light in a darke place.
Thy word (O Lord) is a Lanthorne vnto my feete, and a light vnto my steps.
For without this light men doe wander in greatest darknesse of error, and in the ignorance of the chiefest matters.
For no man (except Gods word first giue him light) knoweth the essence will of God; no man rightly repenteth him, neither doth any ma~ rightly call vpon God, Except he follow the guide and good gouernment of Gods word.
Let vs then walke in the light while wee haue light, least the darkenesse do oppresse vs.
[Ver&se As the hill of Basan, so is Gods hill; euen an high hill as the hill of Basan.
[Ver&se Why hop ye so ye high hils? This is Gods hill, in the which it pleaseth him to dwell: yea the Lord will abide in it euer.
The first effect of the gospell, as said, is a light shewing the true acknowledgement and prayer unto God: The other fruit is fatnes, that is a consolation to bee opposed against sinne and death: For they which are destitute of this fatnesse they must néeds waxe leane: that is, he plunged into desperation.
For Philosophicall consolations are nothing but idle pratings and and do heale the scarres onely but not the wounds: wherefore séeing Philosophie may confesse her darkenesse, and acknowledge her leanenesse, let vs seeke for the fat hill bringing forth effectual and wholesome remedies for our sorrowes.
And such a hill is the true Church, which embraceth and professeth the doctrine deliuered from God, and shewing consolations healing the wounds of the heart.
The third effect or fruit of the Gospell, is, that they which with saith and good conscience embrace this doctrine, professe the same, and practise to propagate or aduance the same, are made according to the saying in the
of saint Iohns Gospel, The Temples and dwelling places of God: Namelie, If anie man loue mee he will keepe my worde, and my Father will loue him, and we will come vnto him and make our dwellings with him.
But in other sects doth not God dwell, but he hateth and detesteth them, yea though they he high hilles, that is, though they excell others in dominions and politicall glorie.
Of this doctrine and consolation haue we now need especiallie, least our minds taking offence, and being carried awaie with admiration at the power and successe of the Turkish nation, do decline or start away from God: And let not us iudge by fortune (but by the worde of God) which is the true Church of God, and let vs become remaine Citizens of the same yea although all feares, and all daungers shoulde hang ouer our heades.
[Ver&s. The Charets of God are twentie thousand, euen thousands of Angels: and the Lord is among them as in the holie place of Sinay.
The multitude of the people is the honour of the Prince.
So here he addeth vnto this victorious king an excéeding great train, namely the church of the Fathers, Prophets, and Apostles, and these remnants now in the olde age of the Church: for they go before the chariot of Triumph; we sillie soules follow the same, and yet are we fellowes and companions of this glorious triumph, then which benefite nothing may bee thought better or more wishfull.
[Ver&s. Thou art gone vp on high, thou hastled captiuitie captiue, and receiued gifts for men: yea euen for thine enemies, that the Lord God might dwell among them.
Like as Paulus Emilius ascended vp into the Capitoll to giue thankes vnto Iupiter, led Perscus as his prisoner in the triumph, and gaue vnto his owne associates large giftes of spoyles: so the sonne of God is ascended into heauen, and in his triumphant pompe gloriousslie shewed his prisoners the princes of darkenes tied in Chaines, and dealt most ample benefites vnto the Apostles, and to the vniuersall Church.
But séeing this verse of all other in this Psalm shineth like a precious stone of rare vertue, let the waightines of all the wordes be most diligentlie considered.
And first indéede let the article touching Christes ascension into heauen be vnderstoode according to the declaration of the godlie olde rule.
Eius est ire venire qui aliquibus locorum terminis circumscribitur, eum in quo erat deserens locum ad eum vbi non erat, veniat.
Ceterum verbi diuinitas vniuersa implens nullis locorum terminis concluditur, sicut nihil est vndediseedat, it a nihil est quo veniat, &c.
It is for him to go and come, who is prescribed for certaine places limited, and forsaking that place wherein he was, that he may come thither where hee was not: but the Godhead of the worde filling all places, is not prescribed to any limits of places: for as it is not material from whence it departed, so is it not materiall whither it commeth.
And so speaketh Cyprian in his rehearsall of the Créed.
Ascendit ad coelis non vbi verbum Deus, antea non fuerat, quippe qui erat semper in coelo, manebat cum Patre; sed vbi verbum caro factum antea non sedebat.
That is: He ascendeth vp to the heauens, not where God the worde was not before, because hee was alwayes in heauen, and remained with the Father, but where the worde become flesh, fate not before.
Thou hast led captiuitie captiue That is: thou half redéemed mankind, or reduced him into his olde libertie and dignitie when he was holden captiue of the Diuell, that Lord of death and sin; as in the
to the Hebrewes, it is said; And hast led thy enemies captiue in the triumph, according to that notable saying extant in the
Spoyling the Principalities and powers, hast made a shew of them openly, and hast triumphed ouer them, &c.
So often then as feare of death and dangers of hell do rush togither vpon vs, and the deuill with innumerable sleights assaulteth vs, let vs be conuerted in minde and thought vnto this triumph, and let vs craue that this captaine and conquerour would treade downe sathan vnder our feete, and would giue vs victorie against sin and death.
The speciall gift of this triumph is, The holie Ghost powred out with a manifest light vpon the Apostles, and their scholers: Touching this gift, saint Peter in the
He being exalted at the right hande of God, receiuing the promise of the holy Ghost from the Father, hath poured out this which yee nowe see and heare.
the excéeding great goodnes of God, powring out his spirit vpon all flesh.
Without whose diuine grace in man, nought well hee doth, nor well he can: As the Church singeth godlilie.
And although Paule applieth this particle vnto the ministerie of the Gospel, which is the instrument of the holie ghost, yet may it bee rightlie applied vnto all gifts necessarie for the bodie and the soule: amongst which is not the last gift the stabilitie of his Church, and subduing of his enemies, which are so brideled and restrained by Christ.
that they cannot outrage nor hurt so fore as they would.
Whereas then all the world is not full of Turkish tyranie, and beastly cruelty, but that as yet there is a holie seede; that must not we ascribe and attribute vnto humane enterprises and defences, but vnto the triumph of the sonne of God.
But so great is the plentie and abundance of effect in this little verse, that it can not bee considered or described with anie eloquence, do therefore passe on to the rest which remaine in this Psalme.
[Ver&s. Praysed bee the Lord dayly, euen the God which helpeth vs, and powreth his benefits vpon vs. [Ver&s. He is our God· euen the God of whom commeth saluation: God is the Lord by whom we escape death.
Séeing Gospell is a witnesse of the crosse, hee comforteth the Church burdened with the crosse, by reason of our confession, and the remnants of sinne.
But a speciall consolation is the promise of Gods presence and helpe in calamities: Also his mitigation and deliuerance from the same.
And it is a speciall deliuerance: whereas by Iordan, that is, by the miseries of this life the sonne of God leadeth vs into the land of Canaan, that is, into the life euerlasting.
But the whole doctrine touching causes and remedies of humane miseries is elsewhere plentifullie expounded.
For we do not now write of places, but we interpret Psalms, and least this Commentarie appeare too much in matter, we are contented with the direction of those places which are extant in all mens hands.
[Ver&s. God shal wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalpe of such a one as goeth on still in his wickednes.
[Ver&s. The Lord hath said will bring my people againe, as did from Basan: mine owne will bring againe, as did from the deepe of the sea.
[Ver&s. That thy foote may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies: and that the tongue of thy dogges may be red through the same.
He addeth vnto the description of the triumphant pompe a prophecie touching the destruction of the Iewish nation for their blinde obstinacie, striuing setting themselues against the Gospel: And this prophecie agréeth with the saying of Christ, Luke.
All those things shall come vpon thee, because thou hast not known the time of thy visitation.
Nowe indéed it is sufficientlie apparant that the Iewes (for their contempt of Christ) hauing lost their kingdome and priesthoode, do wander in perpetuall banishment, and are the most miserable persons of all others vppon whome the sunne shineth.
And although the greatest multitude of the Iewes be with tragicall punishments oppressed, yet notwithstanding out of this skum of mankinde God hath culled or picked out some remnantes, as in the
Iewes were conuerted vnto Christ: and in the next yeare after the resurrection of Christ, Paule the apostle was conuerted: And there is extant in the
a prophecie touching the downefall of the Chruch of the Gentiles, and of the conuersion of the Iewes.
[Ver&se It is well seene, God, how thou goest, howe thou my God and King goest in thy sanctuary.
[Ver&se The singers go before, the minstrels follow after: in the midst are the Damsels playing with the timbrels.
He returneth vnto the triumphant pompe, whose ornament was musicke: For the greeke [undefined span alphabet] hath his name [undefined span alphabet], that is, by the description of a figs leafe, and the foote Iambus in verse.
For nothing is more swéete then victorie, and the foote Iambus is most speciallie applied vnto the following of enemies which are led captiues in the triumph.
And what maner of song, the people both going before and also following the chariot ought to sing, S. Paul in the
there prescribing the rule of spirituall musicke teacheth vs at large.
[Ver&se Giue thankes Israell, vnto God the Lorde in the congregations from the ground of thy hart.
This little verse is short, but it admonisheth the Reader touching the greatest matters: God will not haue vs to serue him with the sacrifice to Ceres shut vp in close place of vs.
No man lighteth a candle, and afterwards putteth it vnder a bushell: But he will haue the church to bee a visible congregation and to haue honest meetinges publikelie, wherein the preaching of the Gospell maie sound and hee heard touching the sonne of God.
And therfore doth he with a meruailous power saue, yea and shall preserue his church in honest congregations: and he wil haue euerie man to helpe and maintaine the preseruation of these publique méetings, that the ministery of teaching maie bee preserued.
There will God haue a common praier and thankesgiuing to be made, there will hee haue confession to be shewed: which kind of doctrine euerie man may embrace.
And he biddeth vs to take the doctrine of the church not out of the cesterns of mans traditions, nor out of Aristotles Ethickes, but out of the holie and sacred fountaines of Israell, that is, from the Prophets and Apostles: for all other sectes without the true church, do onelie teach a particle of the law, touching externall and ciuill duties, and some of them do bring with them other worshippings of Idols.
But they are altogether ignorant of the sonne of God and of his gospell, that is the promise of the free remission of sinnes, also of our reconciliation, and of our inheritance of life euerlasting to be giuen vs by faith in the sonne our Mediator.
But the Church draweth out of the welspring of Israel the sound, perfect and vncorrupt doctrine of the law and the gospell, and the pure knowledge of the sonne of God for vs crucified and raised from death to life.
[Ver&se. There is little Beniamin their ruler, and the Princes of Iuda their Counsaile: The princes of Zabulon and the princes of Nephthaly.
Although the world do iudge the Apostles to be miserable wandring persons, and hateth and curseth them as gasing stocks, the ofscourings of the world,
yet the holie ghost adorneth these ministers with the most praise worthy title of princes: For the Apostles haue the testimonie of the holie ghost, that they do not erre in doctrine: These Captaines do other teachers and preachers in the church followe; vnto whom no credit must bee giuen, except their confession do agrée with the foundation of the Apostles as S. Paule saith
And are built vpon the foundation of the Prophets Apostles, Iesus Christ himselfe being the chiefe corner stone.
But why doth he here saie There is little Beniamin their ruler Certes, it may signifie that only of all the Apostles; Paul being borne of the tribe of Beniamin, a great and good part of the Church should be gathered out of Europe and Asia: stand not to be precise, touching the speciall dignitie of anie apostle, but reuerence them al as the instruments of God sounding forth the preaching of the gospell throughout all the world: And yet cannot this bee denied that Paule himselfe with a liuelie voice witnesseth of himselfe, and letting passe most vpright testimonies of others: He did greater thinges then the other Apostles, like as he himselfe not vntruly glorieth, Let vs therefore giue thankes to God for this excellent Organ or instrument, and like little hounds let vs licke vp the crums falling from Paules table, which are full of excellent words and sentences.
[Ver&se. Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee: Stablish the thing (O God) that thou hast wrought in vs.
First, in this verse let the misterie of the Trinitie be well marked: For like as in
Psal, the persons of the godhead are discerned, where he saith in the
Therefore God euen thy God hath anointed thee with oyle of gladnes aboue thy fellowes, So in this place is the Messias cléerelie and perspicuouslie distinguished from the eternall father.
Here he saith Thy God hath sent forth strength that is, thy eternal father (from whom thou art sent to publish and preach the gospell and to redéeme mankind) hath instituted and ratified thy kingdome: it shall therefore stand immoueable, and shall not be weakened by anie force, neither shall it by anie meanes possible be remoued out of place.
Of this consolation stoode the church in neede when Diotlesian and the other tyrants ruled and raigned, who seemed to doe what they could vtterlie to race out the name of Christ from the of all posteritie: For writers when Dioclesian raigned there were euerie daie at the least xx. godlie persons put to death in the Cittie Alexandria, for profession of the gospell.
And now also in this olde age of the church, the Church likewise needeth the same consolation: For from the East the Turkish tyrant assaulteth her, and from the West parts the Pope armed and fortified with the defence and cruelty of manie kings vexeth her.
What is then remaining where with we maie defend our selues from this Turkish and Popish outrage, but this most strong wall Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee: Stablish the thing God, that thou hast wrought in vs: For seeing God is the guide and giuer of this kingdome, doubtlesse he will be also the effecter and worker in vs, and he only will be the foundation thereof.
Neither indéed let this praier and promise be vnderstood onelie touching the whole bodie of the Church, but let it also bee applied unto euerie particular member; and let it alwaies sound in our mindes, eares and tongues.
Seeing God thou hast translated vs out of the kingdome of darkenesse into the kingdome of thy light, and that these beginnings of life euerlasting are diuers waies assaulted, partely by the Diuell, partly by the world, and partly of our own flesh (in which word comprehend our wandring opinions and affections) humbly beseech thee that thou wouldst establish that benefit thou hast begun in vs, and defend vs against our enemies domesticall and externall.
For as he that buildeth anie thing doth not onlie frame the foundations, but goeth forwarde in setting vp the whole building whatsoeuer it be: So God will not haue vs begin our conuersions and turnings vnto him, but much more will he haue our saluation to bee perfected by him: for as it is said,
It is God that worketh in vs the will and the deed euen of his good pleasure, to the ende some acceptable seruices may be done vnto him.
[Ver&s. For thy temples sake at Ierusalem: so shall kings bring presents vnto thee.
He foresheweth hereby, that some kings and princes shall be associates of the true church, nursing fathers of them which teach and learne in the same, and shall surely be made members of life euerlasting.
For although Religion do bring forth Riches, as one saith elegantlie, yet the daughter like an vnthankefull Stockedoue hath deuoured her mother.
For the Bishops in some ages haue not béene so vpright or sincere, as that their estate of life might agrée with their calling: that is, they taught not the Gospel soundlie, nor administred the Sacraments rightlie: no, they cared not for edifying the people with true doctrine, but became stately Lords in kings courts, and being ordained to sacred busines, they intermedled themselues with prophane matters nothing agreeable to their calling.
Therefore both of these are best, Meane wealth, and meane pouertie, in such like persons.
[Ver&s. When the companie of the spearemen, and multitude of the mightie are scattered abroad among the beastes of the people: (so that they humblie bring peeces of siluer) and he hath scattered the people that delight in warre.
He addeth vnto this prophecie of the calling of the Nations a heauie effect, touching the kingdom of Antichrist, whose chiefest members, and as it were twinnes at one birth borne
yeares agone, are the Pope and Mahomet: These hee compareth vnto mightie strong Bulles treading vnder foote the true doctrine, and true worshippings of God, for to establish their owne power.
Against these is this Verse, as if we in our time should now say: God restraine and ouerthrow the practises of these, least the true knowledge of thy most holie name be extinguished in mankind: For thy name, for thy name sake, God do thou this, that thou bee not blasphemed: Helpe vs God our Sauiour, and for the glorie of thy names sake deliuer vs, and be mercifull vnto our sinnes for thy names sake, least at any time the Gentiles do say vnto vs: Where is nowe thy God? Psal.
[Ver&s. Then shall the Princes come out of Egypt: The Morians land shall soone stretch out her hands vnto God.
This is a notable prophecie touching the calling of the Gentiles: and haue often elsewhere saide, that the Reader is to be put in minde of the chiefest matters, so often times as the Prophets doe make mention touching the calling of the Gentiles.
For first, this calling is a notable testimonie implying that saying of saint Paule, Rom.
For if so great force or effect were not procéeding from the louing sauour and mercie of God, he would not haue receyued into fauour nations polluted with Idolatrie, lusts, and other most filthie and foule sinnes, which are partlie so filthie, and partlie so flagitious, that they seeme euen filthie to speake of them.
Secondlie, the same calling of the Gentiles witnesseth that the promise of the Gospel is vniuersall, pertaineth vnto all persons that do trulie call vpon God: for in God there is no courtlike respect of persons, but God is indéede equall to the equall: that is to them which trulie repent, and flie vnto the Mediator.
Touching this consolation mo things are spoken by Paul, Rom.
Finally this selfe same vocation of the Gentiles refuteth the Pharisaical opinion, which imagineth that ceremonies are righteousnes before God: for the Gentiles are by God receyued into fauor without Circumcision, and other ceremonies of Moses.
[Ver&s. Sing vnto God, yee kingdomes of the earth: sing prayses vnto the Lord.
[Ver&s. Which sitteth in the heauens ouer all from the beginning: lo he doth send out his voice, and that a mightie voyce.
[Ver&s. Ascribe ye the power vnto God ouer Israell: his worship and strength is in the cloudes.
The Epilogue or latter part of the Psalme is an exhortation: for he exhorteth all degrées of men vnto Thankesgiuing: As if he said, séeing the benefits of this king are so great, meet it is that hee bee honoured and magnified with all speech and writing: sing prayses vnto God that is acknowledge yee his wisedome, righteousnesse and mercie: It is Mercie, that we are not consumed, and brought into nothing, nor cast away amongst the Diuels after our first fall.
It is Righteousnesse, that there is no forgiuenes of sinnes without an equall recompence and redemption equiualent.
This when no creature is able to pay, it is decreed by his wonderfull wisedome that his sonne should pay the ransome for vs.
For God declineth not from his righteousnes, and yet by his wonderfull wisedome doth hee temper his righteousnesse with mercie.
might indeed iustlie destroy thee, but will not exercise the furie of my wrath: because am God and not man, the holy one in the middes of thee.
Neither indéed here must passe with silence the particle containing a testimonie of the efficacie of the Gospell.
He shal send out his voyce, and that a mightie voice.
The preaching of the Gospel shall not be a vaine sound of spéech: but it shall be as saint Paule saith most swéetlie.
The power of god vnto saluation for al that beleeue: and the ministerie of the spirit of life, &c. [Ver&s. God wonderfull art thou in thy holy places: euen the God of Israel, he will giue strength and power vnto his people: Blessed be God.
In conclusion, he teacheth that Gods Church is by marueilous meanes gouerned, preserued, and defended; as in the
it is said: The Lord hath chosen vnto himselfe the man that is godlie.
For when we seeme to bee weak, then are wee strong.
For, the power of God is made strong in our infirmitie.
And to let passe other things: In quietnesse and hope consisteth our strength, &c.
Psalme of Dauid: a Figure of Christ, persecuted by his enemie.
THis Psalme is memorable in the writings of the Euangelists and Apostles.
cap. citeth three verses out of this Psalme: And Peter the Apostle speaking of the punishment which Iudas the traitor had, vseth in
Rom. speaketh of this psalme in many wordes: And it is a prophecie touching the passion of Christ, and the horrible punishments of the Iewish nation; and of the proper worship appertaining to the Church of the new Testament.
But it is a threefold Meditation vpon the passion of the Sonne of God: one of instruction, an other spiritual, the third of example or imitatio~.
The instructiue meditation, is to read much and often the interpretations which are extant in the Euangelists, touching the passion of this Lord, and to confer them with the histories of the Prophets; that this conference of the histories and prophecies might confirme in our minds an assent, whereby we might embrace this article.
But whereas in histories wee must not onelie looke for the euentes, but much more the causes of the euents must bee sought for this meditation comprehendeth also a consideration of the causes, for which the Messias was made a sacrifice and Redeemer.
For it is needefull that the causes of so great a matter bee neither slender nor fained, but great and weightie causes, which we shall thorowly beholde when God shall be all in all.
Now let vs diligently learne the elements which are deliuered in the worde, and let vs craue of God that hee would gouerne with his holy spirit, our purpose vndertaken touching the greatest matters.
And although some vnlearned persons fondly dispute, yt God seeing he is omnipotent, could restore mankinde into his ancient liberty and dignity by other maner of means: yet let vs so hold it determined yt god doth not any way decline fro~ his righteousnes which thing sith so it is, God must not only haue his place of mer+cy, but also of righteousnes attributed vnto him, touching his secret prouidence in the redeeming of mankind.
As therefore the immense mercy of God would not beholde the vniuersall death and destruction of our nature, according to that saying of Ieremy, Lament.
It is the mercy of the Lorde that we are not consumed: So the eternall and vnchangeable righteousnesse of God required a satisfaction for the offence and for the punishment.
For the Law of God which is a rule of iustice in God, discerneth good and euill, and bindeth the reasonable creature to become conformable to that rule, and denounceth horrible destruction vnto all thinges which are contrary to that rule.
Wherefore seeing the ransome pacifieng the wrath of God, and satisfieng the righteousnesse of God, could neither bee paide by Angels nor by any other creature, because the malice of sinne is infinit, and no creature is able to endure the wrath of God, it is by Gods wonderfull wisedome decreed; that the second person of the Godhead which is called the word should take vpon him the nature of man, and should satisfie the lawe of God for the fault and punishment in mankind: That is, that he, which knew no sinne, should take vpon him to redeeme vs from sinne, that by him we might bee made the righteousnesse of God.
In this decree, with admiration whereof the very Angels stand amazed at, do shine the righteousnesse and mercie of God: also the vnspeakeble humility and loue of God towardes vs.
For there is no remission of sinnes graunted, without recompence and satisfaction made.
For, thinke, pray you, howe great the force of Gods wrath is against sinne, when he could not be pacified with any other sacrifice, but by the passion and death of the immaculate Lambe: And we indeed by the greatnesse of this remedie may esteeme the greatnesse of our sicknesse and sore.
For, as Hippocrates saith, vnto extream diseases we must lay extreame remedies.
Againe, how great mercy is there in God not sparing his only begotten sonne, but giuing him for vs all, and giuing vs with him all things also? The sonne of God adorning and amplifieng this mercy saith, Iohn
So God loued the world that hee sent his onely begotten sonne, that euery one which beleeueth in him should not perish, but haue life euerlasting.
Notably therefore saith Clement B. of Alexandria: Man is beloued of God: For, how should he not bee beloued, for whose sake the onely begotten sonne of God was sent from the bosome of his father? What shall say of the humility of the Sonne, turning vpon himselfe the reproches of other men, and for the loue he bare towards his church, for whose sake he put on the shape of a seruant and was by all meanes tempted, like as we are tempted (except with sinne onely) that he bring and repossesse this his spousesse into her ancient liberty.
Pontanus telleth, that in his time there was a cettaine wife carried away by the Pirates of Tuneta, and when her husband heard of this matter, hee leapt into the sea, and besought the Pyrats with great desire, that they would also carry him away with his wife: they maruailing at the faith and mind of the man, tooke him also with them, and when they arriued at Tuneta, and had openly shewed their prize, they declare vnto the King a rare and memorable acte; who though he were a Prince barbarous and enemy to Christianity, yet merueiling and perceiuing the vertue of the man, did set him and his wife both at liberty, and commaunded them to bee registred as of the number of those which were the guard of his person.
So the sonne of God leaped from high and heauenly beatitude into the sea of our mischiefes and miseries, and of free became bondman, of rich poore, that by his virtue and power hee might obtaine liberty for vs, and coopt vs into the society of heauenlie blessings: Let vs therefore be ashamed of our pride and impatience, wherein we disdaine to suffer some sorrowe to profit the Church thereby.
The spirituall meditation of the passion of the sonne of God consisteth in Feare and in Faith: Feare is to tremble with acknowledgement of Gods wrath against sinne, whose speciall testimony is the death of the sonne of God.
For although the threatnings added vnto the Law, and horrible examples of punishments and feares of conscience doe shew the iudgements of God destroying contemptuous persons: yet if we looke well into this glasse of Christ crucified, wee shall see a far more euident signe of Gods horrible wrath, For, seeing God could not be pacified with the obedience of anie creature, but did decree that his Sonne should be the propitiator or attonement maker in his bloud, as S. Paule saith: Assuredly me must confesse that great, earnest, and vnspeakeable is the wrath of God against sinne.
And least this acknowledgement of Gods wrath should leaue in our minds the stinges or darts of seruile feare, which is a sorrowe without faith, and a grudging against God, and a horrible fleeing from God, as was in Saule and Iudas, let faith take roote in vs, whereby the hart is stirred vp in the acknowledgement of Gods mercie promised for his sonnes sake.
For, seeing God hath not spared his only begotten sonne, but giuen him for vs all, surely it cannot otherwise be, but with him also he will giue vs all thinges: Therefore spirituall meditation, is not only to knowe the history touching the passion, and to beleeue the same; but also to feele in our hart sorrowes and consolations.
The exemplary or imitatiue meditation of Christes passion is to follow the humility and patience of Christ, as S. Peter saith, Pet
Christ suffered for vs leauing vs an example, that wee should follow his steps.
And although none of vs in this our imbecility or weakenes is able to follow the example of Christ, yet notwithstanding let there bee some lineaments agreeable in vs with this Image of imitating Christ.
[Ver&se Saue me God, for the waters are come in euen vnto my soule.
[Ver&se sticke fast in the deepe myre, where no grounde is: am come into deepe waters, so that the flouds runne ouer mee.
[Ver&se am weary of crying, my throate is drie: my sight faileth me, for waiting so long vpon my God.
SOme men do merueile whie the Euangelistes write, That the sonne of God was grieued with sorrow and vexed in mind, when he was in the Orchard: seeing it seemeth a thing vnméete for a strong, graue and constant person, to weepe and waile and ware pale with feare of death, as women vse to do.
For of Hercules addressing to cast himselfe into a burning fire, Seneca saith thus.
Quis sic triumphans laet us in currustetit Victor? Quis illo gentibus vultu dedit Leges tyrannus? quanta paxobitium tulit Vultus petentis astra, non ignes erant, Who did so ioufull victor triumph make? What Tyrant with such austere countenance? Prescribed lawes to Nations for their state, How great a peace toth' skies did him aduance, No fiers they were.
But let vs knowe, that Christ vare upon him a greater burthen then Hercules did: for he was not in anguish and veration of minde for death onelie, and for thinking vpon the tormenting of his bodie, but he felt the wrath of God to bee turned vpon him against mine, thine, and all mens sinnes.
This féeling of Gods wrath sore vexed and grieued his most sacred breast.
For although euerie creature groneth and moneth when it is burthened aboue the abilitie of bearing the same, yet the greatnesse of this burthen, expressed in Christ not onelie teares, but also drops of water and blood mingled togither, which the Grecians call [undefined span alphabet].
Therfore omitting disputations, let vs tremble with feare in acknowledgement of Gods wrath against our sinnes, and with the Prophet Isay let vs saie: Surely he hath borne our infirmities, and caried our sorrowes, &c.
He was wounded for our transgressions, hee was broken for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was vpon him, and with his stripes we are healed.
[Ver&s. They that hate me without a cause are mo then the haires of may head: they that are mine enemies and would destroy me guiltlesse are mightie: paide them the things that neuer tooke.
The former thrée verses contained a description of feares inwardlie in his heart: This verse setteth forth his outward enemies: As in truth for most part alwayes inward feares, and outward fightings and hostile inuasions do méete togither.
But we are admonished by this saying They that hate me without cause, &c.] that we suffer not as murtherers and theeues, &c. but like vnto Christians, &c.
And there is a notable ardent affect in the particle without a cause: As if he had said, They hated me not only as one neither guilty of sin, nor hurting them, but also most feruentlie coueting to do them good, yéelding with great humilitie, and taking vpon my selfe the punishments which they temselues deserued, not séeking any reuenge, but rather with great sorrow deploring or bewailing their wilfull obstinacie and destruction: For this great good will, and full of sorrow and lamentation for them, and earnest desire to do them good, do beare this hatred.
Let Teachers, or Preachers consider this figure, and let them know that it is a common disease almost in all mankinde to be vnthankfull, and let them for their great good will and great benefits suffer with patience to haue euill will, hatred, reproches, and other mischiefes rendred them; like as all Hystories are full of examples of vnthankfulnesse: The Citie of Athens kept Miltiades in prison almost euen to his verie death: and banished Aristides, Themistocles, and Cimon, who had well deserued of the same Citie.
Finallie, there is an infinite number of such, whose examples maie admonish vs, that we for Gods cause be carefull to do well, not for reward of man, and that we be not dismaid when mens indeuours and duties are not answerable to our good will and deseruings.
And that particle must we diligently consider, where he saith: paide them the things that neuer tooke That is, he hath peformed our duties: for euerie bond is cancelled and made voide when the debt is paid: neither is it materiall whether he that oweth the debt do pay it, or an other for him.
Then this our Redeemer tooke quite away, or rather frustrated our obligation wherein wee were bound to the curse of the lawe and euerlasting punishments, because he performed for vs the dutie by vs owing to the lawe, according to that saying, Galat.
Christ being made a curse for vs, redeemed vs from the curse of the lawe.
[Ver&s. God thou knowest simplenesse: and my faultes are not hid from thee.
How great humilitie was that, where Christ prostrating himselfe before his father did beare his wrath, as if he had polluted himselfe with the most heinous sins of all men? This is no Rhetoricall spéech nor vaine amplification, but indeed such was the sorrow of Christ taking vpon him the wrath of God, as if he himselfe had committed these our sinnes.
But who can at full declare the greatnesse of this humilitie? Where the sonne of God yéeldeth himselfe as a guiltie person in so great and grieuous sinnes.
Him that knewe no sinne made hee sinne for vs, that by him we might bee made the righteousnesse of God.
Iustice is more beautifull farre, then the morning or the euening starre.
For there is nothing better nor more excellent then the congruencie with the whole law, which is a rule of righteousnesse in the will of God: Contrariwise, nothing is more filthie then sinne wherewith God is horriblie angrie: For the Sonne of God taketh and turneth vnto himselfe this deformitie, and bestoweth vpon vs his obedience, that by his meanes wee might be righteous before God.
But the excellencie of this purpose in God, can neither the eloquence of Angels, nor of men, sufficientlie disclose or manifest vnto vs: do therefore exhort the reader, to consider the same diligently, and to giue thankes vnto Christ Iesus the sonne of God for his wonderfull humilitie and seruent love towards vs. [Ver&s. Let not them that trust in thee Lord of hostes bee ashamed for my cause: let not those that seeke thee be confounded through me, Lord God of Israel.
[Ver&s. And why? for thy sake haue suffered reproofe: shame hath couered my face.
The sonne of God in this verse applyeth his sacrifice vnto the Church: for it belongeth unto the Priests dutie, not onelie to offer some thing, but he must haue therwith a mind to pray for him touching whom the sacrifice is made, and testifying that for his sake he performeth this obedience.
Therefore that these wordes in this place, and in the
cap. ver. of S. Iohn, are recited by Christ the son of God, we are faithfullite to remember: (saith he) do sanctifie my selfe for them, that euen they also might be sanctified in the truth.
pray not for them onelie, but for all those which shall beleeue in me for my wordesake.
Here doth Christ openlie affirme that his sacrifice is effectuall, not onlie for his Apostles, but for all them that embrace the gospell.
But this application must we firmelie take holde vpon by faith, and wee must beleeue that the fruite of this sacrifice perteineth vnto vs, and that by meanes of this sacrifice the wrath of god is vnfainedlie pacified towardes vs, yea, that we are receiued into gods fauour, heard and saued by him.
We are freely iustified by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Iesus, whom God hath ordained our propitiator (or mercifull Sauiour,) by faith in his blood.
So (saith he) is he thy mercifull Sauiour, when thou beleeuest that by means of his sonne Christes death, god is pacified with thee.
This doctrine of application let vs for euer, and with speciall care remember.
[Ver&s. am become a stranger vnto my brethren: euen an aliant vnto my Mothers children.
[Ver&s. For the zeale of thine house hath euen eaten mee: and the rebukes of them that rebuked thee are fallen vpon mee.
The worde zeale signifieth a displeasure in vs driuing awaie the iniurie from that which we loue, or striuing that the person whom we loue be not taken awaie form vs: As when Sampsons wife was taken from him, euen he a man of most mightie courage, conceiued great sorrowe and displeasure, that for the loue he bare to his wife, he woulde either plague and scourge the Philistians, or else haue her to him home againe.
Also by this zeale are manie motions or rather passions of the minde intermixed in men like as Virgill saieth: Mixta est Insania luctu, Euen with verie mourning mood, is mixed motion mad or wood: And the Poet Ouid, with notable wordes describeth this mixture of affections, where hee saith: Cor dolet atque it a mixtus abundat amor.
The heart of louers sorroweth sore, and loue abounds by mixture more.
So Scipio was in person present, at thrée battles where he saine his country ouercome.
These ouerthrowes brought him both great sorrow and enflamed his anger to restore the ancient glorie of this countrie and to subdue or represse Annibal.
This great affection or rather passion did Christ feele in suffering aduersitie, which he must and would needes beare to restore the glorie of his eternall father, and to deliuer his Church, which he loued feruentlie, and knew the would not be otherwise deliuered except the himselfe should be made a sacrifice for her.
verse: The zeale of thine house hath euen eaten me: That is, consumeth me; in that hasard my life for deliuerance of the congregation which loue: and to vanquish and ouercome those reproches wherewith God is agréeued, which bring me great sorrow and prouoke my anger against the balsphemous person.
[Ver&se wept and chastened selfe with fasting; and that was turned to my reproofe.
[Ver&se put on sackloth also; and they iested vpon me.
[Vere&se They that sit in the gate speak against me: and the drunkards make songs vpon me.
Well it is said by Augustine: Bona conscientia mihi mea causa opus est, sedbona fama opus est propter proximum.
had néed in anie my cause to haue a good conscience; but haue néede of a good name, by reason of my neighbor: For although a guiltlesse conscience maie well scorne lying reportes, so far as to the effect of the cause apperteineth, because the knoweth that Truth at length wil haue ye victory ouer sclanders: yet ye vertu+ous or noble mind is sore grieued with the lewd iudgments of men, and had rather suffer great punishments in the bodie, then to heare the poisonfull backbitings stickled on with popular and plawsible arguments.
Wherefore, séeing Christ was tempted by all means as we are tempted (except sinne onelie) let vs not maruell that his most sacred brest was vexed and disquieted touching the peruersitie of mens iudgements, which are more fleeting then the flowing streames: For looke whither fortune leadeth, thither listeth the will of men.
And the thing it selfe sheweth that enterprises are ballenced or ratified by the euents: For if anie man haue once good successe in anie thing, hee is by and by counted a wise man: But if the world go awrie with him, then euerie man reprehendeth him.
But omit to be here longer disputing vpon a thing so manifest: whereof wee see dailie example in our life time.
[Ver&se But Lord make my praier vnto thee, in an accceptable time.
[Ver&se Heare me God in the multitude of thy mercy: euen in the truth of thy [Ver&se Take me out of the mire, that sinke not, and let me be deliuered from them that hate me, and out of the deepe waters.
[Ver&se Let not the water should drowne me, neyther let the deepe swallowe me vp: and let not the pit shut her mouth vpon me.
[Ver&se Heare me Lorde, for thy louing kindnesse is comfortable: Turne thee vnto me according to the multitude of thy mercies.
[Ver&se And hide not thy face from thy seruaunt, for am in trouble, hast thee, and heare me.
[Ver&se Draw nigh vnto my soule and saue it, Oh deliuer mee because of mine enemies.
Christ teacheth vs by his example, which is the gate, the tower, and altar for the godlie ones, whereunto they maie safelie runne for refuge, when they are tossed with diuers stormes in this life: For as Salomon saith, Prouerbs cap.
The name of the Lord is a strong tower, &c.
That is, true praier, whereunto the iust person fleeing is deliuered.
So often therefore as all maner feares and dangers fall vpon vs, let vs not séeke after vnlawfull remedies for our sorrows, ut let vs craue of God inward consolation and deliuerance or mitigation of calamities according to Gods prouidence.
He that obeieth and submitteth himselfe to this rule, hee in verie deede shall finde, by proofe that praier vnto God is not a vaine sound, but obtaineth greater thinges then anie man dare aske or looke for.
Ioseph when he was in prison, wrongfullie cast (vpon the sinister suspicion of adultery) doubtlesse asked not of God in his praier the second roome or place in dignitie next to the king, neither gold nor riches; but onelie defence of his life and good name, and the bringing of him againe into his Country, out of which through the vngodlie and wicked practise of his brethren he was banished: But he obtained of God not onelie wished benefits, but also thinges greater then those: for of a seruant, and in déede a captiue or prisoner, he was made the chiefest counsellor and gouernour of the most flourishing kingdome of Egypt; yea, and succoured his father Iacob with all houshold, and kept them in greatest penurie and famine fo foode.
So when Daniell was cast among the Lions, he desired not of God to be a gouernour of countries, nor to haue deuine giftes of reuelations touching greatest matters; and yet was hee so by God deliuered, that he afterwards ruled and gouerned the whole country of Susian, and enioyed the gift of Gods wisedome reuealing hidden mysteries: namelie the sure and certain decription of time appointed for the comming of the promised Redéemer, and the historie of the church or congregation of Christ, and gouernements of kingdoms euen vnto the verie end of the world.
Let these examples of Gods promises stir vs vp vnto praier, and let not the cogitation of our vnworthines discourage vs: Séeing Daniel and all the holie ones euen from the verie beginning of the worlde made their praiers vnto God, not in confidence of their owne worthinesse, but in the confidence of the mercie promised for Christes sake; and for this Lordes sake (who saith, Iohn
Verely, verely say vnto you, whatsoeuer you shall aske my father in my name hee will giue it you they are heard, and obtaine their petitions.
Wee poure out our prayers before thee, not in our righteousnesse, but in thy manifold mercies, heare vs for the Lords sake.
verse of this psalme before recited: Heare me Lorde, for thy louing kindnesse is comfortable; according to the multitude of thy mercies, turne thee vnto me.
Let vs therefore set against out vnworthinesse the preceptes and promises of God: Thou God hast commanded praier to bee made, and wilt of vs in this maner be worshipped and honoured: acknowledge then that am bound to obay thy commandement.
For although am vnworthie, yet thy commandement and thy will is worthie, whereunto yeeld; thy promises worthie whereunto agree, and repose my full trust in the same.
Wherfore make my praier vnto thee, not trusting in my worthinesse, but in the worthinesse of the name of thy sonne Christ Iesus, and of God the father which commandest and promisest performance of that which pray for.
[Ver&s. Though hast knowne my reproofe, my shame, and my dishonour, mine aduersaries are all in thy fight.
[Ver&s. Thy rebuke hath broken my heart, am full of heauinesse: looked for some to haue pitie on mee, but there was no man, neither found anie to comfort me.
[Ver&s. They gaue mee gall to eate, and when was thirstie, they gaue me vinegar to drinke.
He addeth vnto his prayer a complaint of the falsehoode of his friends, and euill reioycing which his enemies haue at his calamities.
Seeing then that there is likelie familiaritie betwéene the head and the members, let vs not maruell if the same thing chance vnto the Church: for the in her calamities is both forsaken of her friends, and cruellie assaulted of her enemies.
Like as certaine yeares agone we haue séene (not without great sorrow) manie examples thereof.
But admit it be so, that we speake not of the Church: shall say how much Dauids prophecie (here describing the last act of Christs passion) liketh me.
How Christ the sonne of God hanging vpon the Crosse, when he had first tasted the Vinegar giuen him by the Souldiours, cried out, It is finished; and bowing his head, gaue vp the spirit.
This consonancie of this prophecie which Dauid hath, and that Hystorie of saint Iohns Gospell maie confirme vs against the venemous doubting which some haue touching the certainite of the doctrine from God deliuered vs.
For séeing the euent answereth not in breadth, but in streitnesse vnto the predictions or foretellings of the Prophets: it is not to be doubted, that the whole doctrine of the Prophets is true, and procéeding from God.
[Ver&s. Let their table bee made a snare to take themselues withall: and let the things that should haue beene for their wealth, be vnto them an occasion of falling.
[Ver&s. Let their eies bee blinded that they see nor: and euer bow downe their backes.
[Ver&s. Powre out thine indignation vpon them: and let thy wrathfull displeasure take holde of them.
[Ver&s. Let their habitation be void: and no man to dwelt in their tents.
[Ver&s. For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten: and they howe they may vexe him, whom thou hast wounded.
[Ver&s. Let them fall from one wickednesse vnto another: and not come into thy righteousnes.
[Ver&s. Let them be wiped out of the booke of the liuing: and not be written among the righteous.
[Ver&s. As for me when am poore and in heauines: thy helpe God shall lift me vp.
HItherto, the first part of the Psalme, (namelie a prayer full of most sorrowfull affections) is expounded: Nowe followeth the second part, wherein Christ reckoneth vp against the blasphemous Iewes dire and grieuous matters: When we read this cursing, let vs tremble with feare in all our bodie, and let vs scare the wrath of God which is bent against the contempt of the Gospell: for, If God spare not the naturall branches, how much lesse will he spare the wilde branches? Rom.
And the first degrée of punishments for despising the Gospel is furie and blindnes, which wickedly corrupteth the natiue meaning of the worde.
The impudencie and sawcinesse of the Iewes of late dayes is knowne in peruerting the sayings of the Prophets: As when they interpret the
ca. of Isay, they imagine that the Prophet speaketh there of Ezechias king of Iuda.
With the same face do they bragginglie striue that the same Prophet in the cap. preacheth not of the Messias or Sauiour that was to come, but of the Iewish people.
So where they busie themselues vpon the ninth chapter of Daniel, then peruert with their horrible ignorance and impietie, the race of the kings of the Persians, so as by all meanes they do but trifle out the prophecie of Daniel.
Finallie, the vniuersall writing of the Prophets, which was sometime a table furnished for this people with most wholesome meates, is now by their blasphemies no other thing but a snare and offence of falling, as in this
The second degree of punishment, is perpetuall thraldome, and most miserable; for although now and then they haue put in practise with warres to recouer their Countrey, and restore their Church and policie, yet by Gods prouidence being ouerthrowne, they acknowledged themselues but to rol the stone with Sysiphus, to play at the dice vpon a broken boord, that is, to be vtterly consumed with vaine contention.
The third degree is the wrath of God which they cannot by anie meanes escape.
The fourth degree, was the most sorrowfull destruction of their gouernement, and of their Temple.
The fifth degree is, that sins are punished with sinnes: for they are euerie day more then other become like mad dogs, howling, stirring vp and heaping vp sinnes and offences.
The sixt and last degree, is the depriuing of them of the life, and righteousnesse euerlasting.
For according to that saying of saint Iohn: He that beleeueth not in the Sonne hath not life, but the wrath of God resteth vpon him.
This plague God vouchsafe thou to turn quite away from vs. [Ver&s. will praise the name of God with a song: and magnifie it with thanksgiuing.
[Ver&s. This also shall please the Lord better: then a bullocke that hath hornes and hooffes.
THe thirde and last part of this Psalme is a thankesgiuing, which instructeth the reader touching the abrogation of Moses ceremonies: The Prophet saith here, Hee will not offer vnto God the blood of Bulles and Calues, but the true signification of thankfulnes, wherewith God is more pleased and delighted, then with the Ceremonies of Leueticall sacrifices.
Well do the Lawiers say: Cessante ratione legis, cessareipsam legem.
When the reason or cause of the lawe ceasseth, then also ceasseth the verie law it selfe.
And the speciall reason or cause for which the Lord God ordained these ceremonies, was that they should be tipes or figures of one onelie sacrifice taking away the sinnes of the world.
When this sacrifice was once offered, then by good right and reason ceased the Leuiticall sacrifice.
But what time the Leueticall priesthood flourished, the slaughter and sacrificing of beasts without faith and morall obedience pleased not God anie thing at all.
For it is not inough to do the workes by God commanded, except they be done in such order, as the wisedome of God hath ordained.
Nowe then it appeareth plainlie, that Faith is the foundation of all worshippings, according to that saying of saint Paule, Rom.
Whatsoeuer is not of faith is sinne, The second and next degree is morall obedience, which containeth loue and other vertnes, according to the commaundements The third degree is the vse of ceremonies, which (as said) please not God, except there be first a foundation laid, that is, a Pediator acknowledged, and that remission of sinnes bee had for his sake, reconciliation to God, and morall obedience begun anew in the heart of man.
This order of workes doe manie Sermons if the prophets lay open vnto vs: As Isay saieth, Cap.
Seeke ye iudgement and relieue the oppressed, &c. Againe, the same Isay in the
Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of Rammes, &c? Hee hath shewed thee man what is good, and what the Lorde requireth of thee, surelie to doe iustly, and to loue mercie, and to humble thy selfe to walke with thy God, ver.
When yee did eate, and when yee did drinke, did yee not eate for your selues, and drinke for your selves? Thus saith the Lord of hostes, execute true iudgement, and shewe mercie and compassion euerie man to his brother, oppresse not the widow nor the fatherlesse, the stranger, nor the poore, and let none of you imagine euill against his brother in your heart, verses,
and &c. [Ver&s. The humble shall see this and bee glad: seeke ye after God and your soule shall liue.
The chiefe blessings which the reasonable or sensible creature hath, are Wisdome, righteousnesse, and ioie in God.
These blessings being lost by Adams transgression, Christ againe by his passion and resurrection hath restored vnto vs: For he died for our sinnes and rose againe for our righteousnesse, that is, through his obedience which he performed in suffring his death he deliuered the church from euils; namely from Gods wrath, the curse of the lawe, sinne, euerlasting death, and the tyrannie of the deuill.
But if he had remained still in death, and in the graue, (which was a thing impossible) he had not restored those blessings vnto vs, which are opposed and set against most grieuous euils.
To the end therfore, that deliuerance should not be onelie the remoouing of euill from vs, but also the placing of benefits for vs: he rose againe from death the third daie, and making his glorious triumph, and beginning his euerlasting kingdome in vs, he restoreth vs vnto righteousnesse and life euerlasting: as Daniel in the
verse saith, Seuenty weeks are determined vpon thy people, and vpon thy holy citie, to finish the wickednesse, to seale vp the sinnes, to reconcile the iniquitie, and to bring in euerlasting righteousnesse, &c.
But although this destinction of the effects of the passion and resurrection of Christ seeme vaine vnto manie men: yet notwithstanding seeing the Apostle S. Paule so often speaketh hereof, (and speciallie in the
That may knowe him and the vertue of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his afflictions and be made conformable vnto his death, &c. let vs without feare of cauilling follow the speech or saying of Paule, and let vs know that we must consider both the merit and efficacie of Christ crucified, and risen from death to life: Like as Paul in
These are not spoken to corrupt the article of iustification, wherein we discerne wiselie imputation from gifts, and expreslie do affirme that we haue remission of sinnes and reconciliation with God, and imputation of righteousnesse for the onelie obedience and merit of Christ: but so that the full and whole benefit of Christ be not thereby obscured: which is not onelie imputation, but also a reuiuing and raising againe from death to life and glorie euerlasting.
To be briefe: it is one thing to speake of the article of iustification, and an other thing to speake of the whole kingdome of Christ, which containeth (as the ancients do speake) graces priuatiue and positiue; that is, not onelie deliuerances from euils, but also restorings vnto or giftes of euerlasting blessinges.
But so often as wee dispute of these matters, in Churches and Schooles, let vs follow Paules rule which biddeth vs,
To deuide the word of truth aright: and not indirectlie to confuse or separate the members from the bodie against the Analogie of the faith, and against the simple and natiue meaning of euerie article.
The Article of iustification admitteth no copulatiue, because of the exclusiues so often repeated: Freely, without workes, without law, in the seede, not in the seeds: And the Article touching the kingdom of Christ cannot be expounded without coupling together grace, and the gifte by grace: neither doe these striue betweene themselues, because when wee seeke for consolation in feares of conscience, we do not dispute of giftes, but we are troubled touching remission of sinnes, and reconciliation with God, which is onelie obtained by faith for Christes sake, whome in his bloudshedding, God hath ordained our mercifull redeemer and Sauiour.
This is not the wisedome of vaine and secure minde, but of the godlie ones, who are mortified and quickened, yea brought downe into hell, and againe are plucked as it were out of the iawes of hell.
[Ver&se For the Lord heareth the poore, and despiseth not his prisoners.
[Ver&se Let heauen and earth praise him; the sea and all that moueth therein.
[Ver&se For God will saue Syon, and build the cities of Iuda; that men may dwell there and haue it in possession.
[Ver&se The posterity also of his seruants shall inherit it; and they that loue his name shall dwel therein.
These last verses in this Psalme need no long decalration, or interpretation: for they exhort euerie creature to the aduauncing of the honour of God, and of his sonne our Lord Iesus Christ: and they promise stabilitie vnto the Church, according to that saying Matth.
The gates of hell shall not preuaile against her: Wherefore sith it needeth not to make long commentaries vpon matters so euident; conclude the exposition of this Psalme; And beseech God to seale in the hartes of manie men the natiue meaning of the articles of the Christian faith, Amen.
Psalme of Dauid: to put him in rememberance for his deliuerance.
SHort indeede is this Song, but long is the effectuall conclusion thereof; For it teacheth that by three Engins the walles of Faith are mightely shaken, whereof, the first is greatnesse of temptation and calamities.
The second is multitude or concourse of tempests or stormes: and the third is the long continuance of these.
For, whom doth not greatnesse ouercome, him the same multitude of calamities do weaken and bring low; but whome neither of these twaine doe ouermaster, yet euen him doth long looking for helpe vtterly discourage.
These all may be plainely seene in Iob, as it were in a looking glasse: when worde was brought to this most holy man Iob of the losse of all his substance and death of his children, whom his house slew when it fell vpon them: Hee was so far from impatience, not shewing any token thereof, that hee euen as it were praised God with a notable verse saying, cap.
If wee haue receiued good thinges of the handes of the Lord, why should we not also suffer euill thinges? The Lord hath giuen, the Lord hath taken away, as it hath pleased the Lorde, so is it come to passe: blessed therefore be the name of the Lord.
But this so holy man when hee could not bee remooued from his purpose with greatnesse of calamities, at the verie last of all, being vanquished and sore broken with concourse of aduersities and with the long continuance thereof, cryed out cap.
Let the day perish wherein was borne, and the night, when it was said, there is a man child conceiued, &c.
He therfore that standeth let him take heed he fall not.
For the diuell knoweth a thousand sleights wherewith the wals and towers of faith (except they be by God defended) may easilie be raced and ouerthrowne.
And seeing there is much danger in delay: This Psalme three times rehearseth a praier vnto God to hasten his helping hand.
Hast thee God, &c. Hast to helpe me Lord, v.
Thou art my helper and my redeemer (O Lord) make no long tarrying.
For althought it is not in our power to prescribe God anie certaine meane or certaine time of deliuerance: yet after a sort, we must craue, that God woulde euen at the very first instant (according to his prouidence) deliuer his church, and the godly ones which are exercised in greatest miseries: This indeed is not only to aske and seeke, but also to knocke: Or as the lawyers vse to say, to cite God peremptorily: And such a searching for finding, and knocking for opening, according to that most sweet saying ceaseth to our most wishful desires: Aske and ye shal haue seeke and ye shall find, knocke and it shall be opened vnto you.
Thus much for the Argument of this Psalme. [leaf motif] The Psalme and Exposition thereof.
[Ver&s. Haste thee God to deliuer mee: make hast to helpe me, God.
[Ver&s. Let them be ashamed and confounded that seeke after my soule: let them bee turned backeward and put to confusion that wish me euill.
[Ver&s. Let them (for their reward) be soone brought to shame: that crie ouer me, there, there.
LIke as when we take an oath (which is a kinde of taking God to witnesse in calling vpon him) we craue that God woulde bee witnesse of our promise, and a iust Iudge in punishing the partie which breaketh promise: So in euerie our praier, wee must craue of God, that he would confirme the worke that he hath begun in vs: and that hee would destroy the workes of the diuell and his instruments: As when we recite these wordes, Hallowed be thy name we do not onelie craue that the glorie of God maie bee made more excellent, both by the true doctrine, and by good examples: but that also all wicked opinions in Religion, and lewde examples in life, (by reason wherof the name of God amongst ye nations is blasphemed) might euerie where be vtterlie extinguished.
So in like maner Dauid craueth helpe and defence in a good cause, and the subuersion of his malicious cruell enemies; whose diuelish malice and euill custome in working mischiefe was such, that both their will was groedilie desirous of hurting, their tongue earnestlie giuen to manifest the same, and their hands nights and dayes prepared to shed the blood of the godlie lie ones.
Against these poysonfull Aspes prayeth Dauid here, for their euill successe of their enterprises, and (except they will bee spéedilie conuerted) for their vniuersall destruction.
So let vs craue of God, that hee would with his mightie hand, restrain or vtterlie cut off both Pope and Turke the two strong armes of Antichrist; and that he would not long deferre the execution of his most iust iudgement, but that hee would make haste to punish the enemie, for the glorie of his names sake.
[Ver&s. But let all those that seeke thee bee ioyfull and glad in thee: and let all such as delight in thy saluation, say alway, the Lord be praised.
[Ver&s. As for me am poore and in miserie: haste thee vnto me, God.
[Ver&s. Thou art my helper and my redeemer: Lord make no long tarrying.
Vnto the godlie ones which exercise faith in their dailic calamities and dangers, these speeches of Dauid are not obscure: am poore and in miserie: That is, destitute of mans helpe and defences: Thou therefore, OGod, bee my helper and deliuerer, and that indeed without tarrying helpe and saue me, least perish or be ouercome of the cruell enemie: for thou knowest thine owne creature, out infirmitie is knowne vnto thee.
Thou knowest also that, the Diuell goeth about and seeketh whom he may deuour and destroy,
Wherefore seeing thou art a faithfull God, do not thou suffer vs to be tempted aboue our strenght but giue with temptation an end, that me may be able to endure that thou laiest vpon vs.
ALthough certaine persons too much louers of themselues, do imagine in their mindes that they excell in wisdome and strength the first flower of mankinde: yet notwithstanding the thing it selfe sheweth that the nature of man as it were barren, is at this day more weake and of lesse strength then it was in the beginning.
For most trulie is it saide of the learned ones: In prima eatate mundi regnasse rationem gubernatricem, inuentricem optimarum artium.
Deinde successisse aetatem bellatricem, in qua, armis imperia constituta sunt, quatuor Monarchiae orbem terrarum rexerunt.
That is: In the first age of the world Reason ruled as gouernesse and inuenter of good artes.
After that succeeded the warlike age, wherein by force of armes kingdomes were ordained, and the foure Monarchies ruled and gouerned al the world.
But now in this olde age of the worlde, concupiscence reigneth: for, nature of man being now made weaker, neither studieth for wisdome as they did of olde, neither taken vpon her those toyling labours of warfarre, which strong men did in times past, but as it were weakned in the sinewes, seeketh after delites and pleasures.
This infirmitie of nature in vs doth the diuell more outragiouslie assault at this day, and as it were leaning vpon a bending wall stirres vp Heretikes and tyrants, partlie with craft or guile, and partlie with manifest violence to ouerthrow and vtterlie destroy all the holie ones, yea, and extinguish the name of Christ: whom this foresaid deadly enemie of ours well knoweth shall hereafter not long to come and iudge all people, and giue vnto his Congregation euerlasting blessings, and shall cast away these diuels with all the wicked ones into eternall destruction and torments.
Therefore now greater and more difficult is our necessitie cause, then euer it was at any time in the church, because wee haue against vs the skem and ende of the worlde: that same extreame outrage of the Pope, and of the Turke: who (as D. Martin Luther sayeth) seeke to deuour vs.
And pray you how many trouble the Church now in her olde age, with mouing vnnecessarie or needlesse disputations, and like peeuish olde women dauncing out of order stirre vp a great dust, as the Greeke Prouerbe saith.
And others like wawling Cats running away out of this life leaue an euill smell behind them.
This masse of mischiefes and miseries, Dauid foreseeing to come in his time, craueth most feruentlie of God, that hee would not forsake nor cast away his Church in her extreame olde age, so fowly deformed: but that he would succour and defende her against the Diuell, who in the ende of his tyrannie rageth more cruelly.
Seeing then Dauid foreseeing future stormes and tempestes in his time, made such prayers for the ship which bare the Church, of what minde behooueth it vs nowe at length to bee, who are tossed with the verie same stormes.
But the verie same thing happeneth vnto vs which did to the Apostles, which neither vnderstoode the greatnesse of Christes sorrowes, nor are yet greatlie grieued in minde therewith: no rather are wee ouercome with heauie sleepe, as the Apostles were.
Let vs therefore correct this securitie and negligence, and let vs craue of God, that hee would helpe, gouerne and strengthen vs, least either our carelesse mindes fall headlong into Epicureal contempt of God, or else being oppressed with the burthen of calamities bee vtterlie destroyed with desperation, like as Ely, Saule, and innumerable others were.
[Ver&se In thee orde haue put my trust; let me neuer bee put to confusion: but rid me and deliuer me in thy righteousnesse; encline thine eare vnto me and saue me.
these words are sufficientlie expounded, wil now onelie admonish the reader touching the little worde righteousnesse which is vsed in some places actiuelie, in other some places passiuelie.
The righteousnesse of God manifested in the lawe, is a will wherewith God prescribeth vs to do those things which are right, and after a certaine gladnesse of his resteth well pleased with thinges rightlie done: and will not haue contrarie thinges to be done by anie, but with an vnfeined displeasure repelleth and destroieth them: Touching this righteousnesse· It is saide in the Psalme verse
For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickednesse: neither shall any euill dwell with thee· verse
Such as bee foolish shall not stande in thy sight, for thou hatest all them that worke vanitie. verse
Thou shalt destroy them that speake leasing, the Lord will abhor both the bloudthirsty and deceiptful man.
The righteousnesse of God manifested without the Lawe, touching which both the Law and the prophets do beare witnesse, is the frée remission of sinnes, reconciliation with God, and obtaining unto life euerlasting for Christes sake the mediator.
He therefore craueth in this place to be deliuered in the righteousnesse of God, not indeed legall and actiue, but euangelicall and passiue, as if he saide: Though maie surelie perswade my selfe that am righteous, not indeede by my owne worthinesse, but thy righteousnes, that is for thy sonnes sake imputed vnto me: also craue this addition, namely deliuerance and glorification according to the prouidence of thy wisedome; As it is saide, Rom.
For whome he hath iustified, them also hath he glorified.
That this, interpretation is neither fained, nor forged, the wordes of D. Martin Luther vpon the
In times past (saieth he) when it behooued me to reade and praie that part of the
(Rid mee and deliuer me in thy righteousnesse trembled for feare in all the parts of my bodie, and with all my whole heart betested that saying Deliuer me not thought I) in thy righteousnesse wherein thou art righteous actiuely: Therefore passiuelie must embrace and take holde of thy righteousnesse wherewith am justified.
And a little after that hee saieth, In times past when came to those propositions, (the righteousnesse of God, the worke of God, thy worke, thy righteousnesse) they found me worke inough to deale withall.
Which if they be vnderstood actiuely, they are death, but passiuely vnderstoode, they are life and saluation.
[Ver&se Be thou my strong holde, wherunto may alway resort: thou hast promised to helpe me, for thou art my house of defence and my castle.
[Ver&se Deliuer me (O my God) out of the hand of the vngodlie, out of the hande of the vnrighteous and cruell man.
All men are carelesse in their doings so long as they haue a refuge and humane succours or defences: But when these are once lost, verie manie are drowned in desperation, and crie out with that Tyrant, Desertus ab amicis miser pereo: Wretch that am, forsaken of friend, wretchedly nowe my life do ende.
But amongst these rockes is faith safelie caried and with great care shunneth both of them, namelie, security and desperation.
And neither is she puft vp or swelling proudlie in prosperitie, neither is the discouraged in aduersitie, but howsoeuer fortune fare with her, the beleeueth she hath God for her mercifull defender and deliuerer, and craueth of God helpe and gouernement, and findeth by triall that God doth helpe her according to his promises.
Dauid had a most large kingdome and dominion furnished with wealth, weapons for warre, and hoastes of men: but hee reposeth not anie thing at all the hope of his helpe in these defences: Afterwardes, when hee was banished out of his kingdome hee was not discouraged in minde, but succoureth himselfe with this consolation.
My father and my mother haue forsaken me, but the Lord hath taken me vp.
These matters without some vse or exercise in them cannot be vnderstood.
Therefore is the Church sore charged and burdened with the crosse that faith maie, in exercises of the crosse, encrease and be stronger, which in idlenesse and pleasures is vtterlie extinguisht.
But Dauid here beseecheth God to defend him not onelie against the violence of his enemies, but also against the falshoode of such as he tooke to be his friends.
For a great deale more doe the domesticall friendes hurt a man then outward enemies do.
[Ver&se For thou Lord, art the thing that looke for, thou art my hope euen from my youth.
[Ver&se Through thee haue beene holden vp euer since was borne: thou art he that tooke me out of my mothers wombe, my prayse shall be alwaies of thee.
He annexeth unto the proposition thrée reasons, whereof the first is deriued from Gods promise, the second from a former benefit, and the third from the cause finall.
No doubt of it faith beareth her selfe correlatiuelie to the promise of God: So often then as mention is made of faith or hope, let vs call to minde the promise giuen from God: The same then signifieth this verse, Thou Lorde art my hope, and thou Lord hast promised me helpe and other necessarie benefits.
So as afterwardes hee calleth to minde the benefites done him before time, by reason whereof he conceiueth assured hope of deliuerances in time to come.
Thou (saith he) hast brought me out of my mothers wombe, and hast bestowed vpon mee of thy most bountifull liberalitie manie other benefits.
O. vouchsafe therefore to finish and perfect vp the web of thy good will and working goodnesse, and doe thou neuer forsake me.
Last of all Icraue and looke from thee defence against the violence and guilefull dealings of mine enemies: not to the ende that maie liue all at pleasure, but that maie reuerentlie honour thee in thy benefits, and be a witness of thy true doctrine.
[Ver&se am become as it were a monster vnto many: but my sure trust is in thee.
[Ver&se let my mouth bee filled with thy praise (that may sing of thy glory) and honour all the day long.
He addeth vnto his praier an ardent affect of his state.
The Apostles are counted for gazing stockes in the world: So Esayas the Prophet in his
verse crieth out, Beholde, and my children whome the Lord hath giuen me, are as signes and as wonders in Israell.
These complaintes do signifie how difficult and hard a thing it is for vs to suffer the vnrighteous iudgementes of the world: for some doe condemne vs of heresie, other obiect vnto vs the crime Laesae maiestatis, or as detractors of the supreame authoritie.
But séeing then that godly men cannot without great sorrow endure slanders or reprochfull taunts though vninst, it is needful that they holde fast the expresse consolations against vnrighteous iudgements, so as they map ouercome sorrowe and beleeue that they are not for such vniust iudgements cast away from god, or excluded from the true church.
Let us therefore euermore looke vpon these sayings, viz. Psal.
Let my enemies be confounded, but let thy seruant be glad and ioyfull.
Blessed are you when men reuile you, and presecute you, and say all maner of euill against you for my sake, falselie, vers.
And in such conflicts let the difference betweene the true Church, and of that companie bee knowne, which falsely arrogateth vnto them the title of the Church: when it is most assured that the enemies of the truth are not the Church of God, according to these sayings, Iohn
Ye are of your father the Diuell, &c. [Ver&s. Cast me not away in the time of age: forsake mee not when my strength faileth me.
[Ver&s. For mine enemies speake against me, and they that lay waite for my soule take their counsell togither, saying: God hath forsaken him, persecute him and take him, for there is none to deliuer him.
The first verse is a principall proposition of this psalme, which is not onelie a praier, but also a promise, according to the rule, All praiers of the holie Ghost are promises: But pray you thinke how necessarie a prayer is this: Like as in aged persons all things are more faintlie seene in them: so in this old age of the world, the Church is more weake fuller of wrinckles in her forehead then the hath had before time, because she is not onelie grieued with infirmitie of her age, but is also fore worne and wrecked with punishments which are increased by reason of her sinnes.
And againe the outrage of the diuels both the more ercaede, because they know within a short time their iudgement draweth neare, wherein their filthinesse shall be clearelie and openlie reuealed before all Angels and men.
Let vs therefore craue with most seruent praier, that God would not cast away the remnants of the Church now in her old age, because of her dotings and other blemishes: but seeing he knoweth that olde age had néed to haue quietnes and rest, that he would vouchsafe merciful+lie to succour, help and comfort his Church now in extreame olde age; as he hath promised so to do, Isay.
verse and Heare ye me house of Iacob, and all that remaine of the house of Israel, which are borne of me from the wombe, and brought vp of me from the birth.
Therefore vnto olde age, the same, euen will beare you, vntill the hoare haires: haue made you, wil also beare you.
Let vs with this promise comfort our selues, when in these confusions and ruines of kingdomes we being disquieted, do séeke where the Church shall remaine.
The latter of these two verses is easilie to be vnderstood of them which do consider the hystorie or state of these daies: For, what sleights hath not Sathan exercised by his instruments the Tyrants and Hypocrites of our time, to oppresse and extinguish the light of the refined and purified doctrine? He mooueth seditions, he kindleth ciuill warres, he deuiseth odde formes and orders of fained reformation in religions and opinions of men, hee hath troubled our congregations with vnnéedfull and vnnecessarie disputations.
Finallie, hee hath prepared and practised all manner of meanes which might seeme to tend to the destruction of the truth.
But like as the foming waues dashing and mounting vpon the rocks do with their owne force fall off againe into the sea, when the rocks stand firme and immooueable: so the mischieuous enterprises practises of Sathan (so much as to the effect of the cause appertaineth) haue beene, are, and shall be redounding to no purpose, according to these sayings of Christ our Sauiour.
Behold am with you euen vnto the end of the worlde.
No man shall take my sheepe out of my hands.
[Ver&s. Go not sarre from me, God, my God· make haste to helpe me.
[Ver&s. Let them be confounded and perish that are agaynst my soule: let them be couered with shame and dishonour that seeke to do me euill.
Such perspicuitie there is in this praier, that he which will expound the same with long Commentaries, shall séeme to lights a Candle euen at the midday: Letting passe therefore diligence vnnecessarie and needlesse in this point, come to the verses next following.
[Ver&s. As for me will pacientlie abide alway: and will praise thee more and more.
[Ver&s. My mouth shall dayly speake of thy righteousnesse and saluation: for, know none end thereof.
[Ver&s. will go forth in the strength of the Lorde: and will make mention of thy righteousnes onely.
[Ver&s. Thou God hast taught me from my youth vp vntill now: therefore will tell of thy wonderous workes.
The Church in her olde age promiseth vnto God for his defence and preseruation of her some recompence: namelie, Confession and propagation of the true doctrine: And euen this is specially to be obserued, that thée affirmeth she will not be the aduancer of her owne righteousnesse, but of the righ+teousnes of God, according to that saying
That may be found in him, not hauing my owne righteousnesse which is of workes, but that which is from God by faith in Christ.
This pronounced praise (as else where is often said) attributeth vnto God and his sonne Christ true glorie, and setteth downe firme consolation vnto our consciences, and discerneth the church from other sects which maruaile at nothing, but the figge leafe (that is) a wretched and vncleane hypocrisie of outward works: And truely when reade these verses, it seemeth to me that the holie ghost foreprophesied in them the refining or purifying of the doctrine which in this age hath beene made by the ministrie of the reuerend D. Martin Luther.
For which let vs bee thankfull vnto God, and the same as an excellent gift and treasure of great price, left vs by the power of the holie ghost, faithfullie kéepe, that it may passe and procéed vnto our prosteritie, pure and vncorrupt without anie our default therein.
[Ver&s. Forsake mee not God in mine olde age: when am gray headed, vntill haue shewed thy strength vnto this generation: and the power to them that are yet for to come.
The repetitions in Psalms are not vaine repetitions of the same things, but signes of most feruent affects or motions of the mind.
For what thing is it that with greater force of mind can be craued. of God, then that he would not suffer the Church his spouse now in her extreame olde age (almost dotage, for or by reason of her manifold deformities) to be either forsaken or cast out of his fauour? Wherefore it is not inough that we make these prayers once, but that we do repeate them dailie, yea euerie moment, and truelie for this cause, that there may be a propagation or publishing of doctrine in the posteritie: for like as God graunteth vnto the Halcion bird the quietnesse and calmenesse of the sea to hatch and bring forth their yong ones, so must we pray that God in the ruines and confusions of kingdomes in the latter age of the world, would preserue his church and ministrie, that in time to come there want no publishers of the most mightie workes of God.
[Ver&s. Thy righteousnesse God is verie high: and great things are they that thou hast done: God who is like vnto thee? This ioyfull conlusion which the Prophet here hath, maie more easilie be vnderstoode; if we consider the historie of the Church from the beginning when Adam and Eua had transgressed, and could not be helped by the meanes of anie creature: God of his immense grace and goodnesse published a promise touching the Redéemer which shoulde come: which when these our parentes heard, they vnderstoode that they should bee receiued againe into Gods fauour and brought againe from euerlasting death.
Afterwardes when all mankinde miserablie perished in the vniuersall deluge, God according to his wonted goodnes preserued Noah and his wife and familie, that they shoulde yet scape the daunger of the floud, and remaine the young plantes of the Church.
And that maie for breuitie sake omit particular deliuerances, howe glorious was the bringing and deliuering of the Israelites out of Egypt? And no lesse glorious was the bringing backe againe of the same people from out of Babilon, and the restoring of them into their ancient state.
What shall saie of the church gathered from out of the whole world, by the ministerie of the Apostles? What shall speake of the continuall preseruation and defence of this little flocke against the violence of Tyrants and wicked deceipts of heretickes· And that would not repeat all stories, will co~prehend in briefe (for so purposed) this last restoring of the gospell euen by God effected, (maugre the malice and repugning thereagainst all the gates of hell) to be no lesse worthie of admiration then other deliuerances of the church, mentioned in the histories of the Prophets and Apostles: These and other thinges innumerable when we call to minde, it cannot be otherwise, but we must needes crie out with Dauid in this verse.
Howe great thinges are they God which thou hast done: God who is like vnto thee? [Ver&se. what great troubles and aduersities hast thou shewed me? and yet diddest thou turne and refresh mee: yea and broughtest mee from the depth of the earth againe.
[Ver&se Thou hast brought me to great honour and comforted me on euery side.
The historie of the Church doth speciallie set forth this interchange of temptations consolations.
The church of the people of Israell had some rest, peace, and quietnesse in the time of K. Salomons raigne, but a little while after when the Kingdome was deuided, there followed continuall ciuill warres, vntill the tenne Tribes were by Salmanazar carried a waie into exilement: The two other Tribes had great tryall of diuers changes, calamities and deliuerances euen vntill the comming of our Sauiour Christ.
But the church of the newe Testament, being first grieuouslie afflicted by Tyrantes, next of heretickes, and afterwardes by Antichrist, hath had thenceforth some space of breathing: So let vs not doubt but the Church of this last age tossed and turmoiled with diuers stormes and surging seas, shall hereafter (not verie long to, getting out of these great troubles) desire and attayne vnto the porte of euerlasting life.
[Ver&se Therefore will praise thee and thy faithfulnesse, God, playing vpon an Instrument of musicke: vnto thee will sing vpon the harpe, thou holie one of Israell.
[Ver&se My lips will bee faine when sing vnto thee: and so will my soule whom thou hast deliuered.
[Ver&se My tongue also shall talke of thy righteousnesse al the day long: for they are confounded and brought vnto shame that seeke to do me euill.
Oftentimes in the Psalmes Dauid keepeth these degrees of order, Beleeuing, he is tempted, tempted he prayeth praying he is deliuered, and being deliuered he giueth thanks vnto God: So the Church beholding the destruction of her enemies or their purposes disappointed, with ioyfull minde and mouth magnifieth and praiseth God, who knoweth howe to deliuer his out of temptation.
prayer composed by Dauid as touching the prosperitie of Salomons Kingdom: which was a figure of Christ, and his euerlasting kingdome,
TIS Psalme with great excellencie of wordes preacheth of the person and office or of Christes kingdome, of the calling of the Gentiles, of the worshipping in the newe Testament, and of the Crosse which the Church must beare.
But first, to beginne with all the Iewes must bee refuted, which with a blinde wilfull boldnesse contend that this Psalme must not bee vnderstoode touching Christ, but touching Salomon.
And trulie the first refutation may bee taken from the limits and long continuance of his Kingdome, touching whome the Psalme speaketh: For he expresly affirmeth in verse
That the limits or boundes of his kingdome extend from the rising to the setting of the Sunne, and this King shall rule and raigne verse.
Because therefore it appeareth sufficiently that neither Salomon nor any other King had euer anie Kingdome so largely limited and bounded, and that all and euerie kingdome in the worlde haue their fatall periods: Let vs here then confesse it to be most euident, these things cannot bee spoken of any other King, but of the promised Sauiour Christ Jesus.
Of this Argument such is the perspicuity, that if the Iewes woulde burst themselues with vaine contention therein, they cannot say so much as a word against it.
The second refutation is taken from the stability of peace, touching which it is saide in verse
In his time shall the righteous flourish: yea and aboundance of peace so long as the moone appeareth: And wee knowe that the latter ende of King Salomns raigne was vnquiet and troublesome as the historie of the
maketh mention: Therefore are the commentaries of the Iewish Rabines far wide from the scope of this Psalme.
But least seeme to be too long in a thing so manifest and plain, will be content with the testimonie of the Caldean translation, which interpreteth this Psalme as touching the promised Sauiour, Christ Iesus.
This ground of the matter being thus ordained, wee must thenceforth seeke who is the sauiour: for the Iewes looke for a Guide and a restorer of their kingdome, such a one as Hercules or Cyrus, or Augustus.
And such a one doth Mahomet beleeue that Christ was; and so haue manie heretickes alwaies thought and held opinion, as Somosatenus· Nestorius and others.
And feare that euen this philosophie stirres vp great tumults in the mindes of manie men at this day: But let the godlie ones fully beleeue, wee must so esteeme of God, euen as hee himselfe instructeth vs in his testimonies.
These do affirme that there is not onely in Christ humaine nature, but also the verie diuine essence of the sonne of God, which Saint Iohn calleth, cap.
The worde which is the image of the eternall father.
And that for breuitie sake may omit other testimonies, certainlie this Psalme discerneth Christ from Moses, and other great personages, when he saith that the Sauiour shall liue for euer, and bee alwayes prayed vnto and worshipped, as in the
His name shall remaine vnder the Sunne among the posterities.
They shall feare thee as long as the Sun and the Moone endureth, from one generation to another.
All kings shall fall downe before him: all nations shall do him seruice for euer.
In these words is his eternitie most euidently described: Before the Sunne: that is, before the shining Sunne in the heauens was created, hee was the Sonne of God For the Hebrew Text vseth in this place a notable worde, signifying doubtlesse that the Sonne of God was borne before anie Sunne shined in the worlde.
Againe also it affirmeth manifestlie, that this Sauiour must alwayes bee called vpon, yea, when he is not seene with our eyes.
He speaketh not here then of the gestures of the bodies, which with reuerence is vsed towards them, but by them towardes Christ; and hee speaketh generallie of all good mindes, which do craue of the same our Sauiour Christ, that he would haue mercie vpon vs, and bee our Mediator vnto his father, that he would forgiue vs our sinnes, giue vs his holie spirit and life euerlasting, and bee our defender and helper in the daungers of this life against the furies of the Diuels, and the wicked ones in this worlde.
Such a kind of prayer yeeldeth rightlie omnipotencie vnto the Sauiour, and witnesseth that he is God.
But indeed his kingdom is not a worldlie policie, but spirituall and eternall.
The benefite of the Sauiour pertaineth vnto the vniuersall Church, from the beginning of the world vnto the end of the same.
Now if the kingdome of Christ had bin politike, it should not haue brought anie profit or vtilitie vnto the Fathers and Prophets which haue departed out of this life, before the co~ming of the Sauiour.
Therefore nothing shoulde their prayers and hope differ in this case from the dreame of the golden fish, wherof the fisher reioyced, as Theocritus reporteth, Adde herevnto a most ample promise of the calling of the Gentiles, which should be vaine and ridiculous, if the Iewes onely should carrie all the stately port and beare rule, and the Gentiles bee brought into bondage as their slaues.
But of all others chieflie the sayings of the Prophets confirme this opinion which wee would attaine vnto, because they preach of the death and resurrection of the Sauiour.
Ergo, he shall not haue anie corporall rule or gouern+ment in this life.
These and manie other such like when we read, may we doubt any thing, but that the Iewes and others (dreaming of the kingdome of Christ to be politicall) are wrapped in the greatest error, and blinded in the ignoraunce of the greatest matters? Also manie were woont to aske of vs what were the benefites of Christs kingdom: Touching this question the Psalme maketh answere: That the Sauiour of the worlde shall not giue riches and Countries, but Righteousnesse and Peace.
But Righteousnesse signifieth in this place Forgiuenes of sinnes, and reconciliation with God, or imputation vnto righteousnes, or acceptation vnto life euerlasting: wherewith after our resurrection shall be ioyned full and perfect newnesse inflamed with spirituall motions, such as the lawe of God requireth.
This true righteousnes differeth infinitelie from discipline, which is onely a shadow of outward workes, and a miserable and vncleane hypocrisie, Peace in this place may not bee vnderstoode of a politike peace, which is nothing but a vaine name, as Plato saith: but it must be vnderstood touching the true consolation and tranquilitie of mindes, which is the ouercommer of death.
For true it is which Christ our Sauiour said: Iohn.
In the world you shal haue affliction, but by me Peace.
Be ye of good courage, have ouercome the worlde, ibidem.
Last of all let the sayinges touching the calling of the Gentiles, the worshippings of the newe Testament, and Crosse of the Church, bee considered in this Psalme.
And it witnesseth that the worshipping of God in the new Testament shall not be circumcision or Leuiticall sacrifices, but praiers and thankesgiuings.
He also addeth a particle wherein not obscurely he signifieth the Church shall bee subiect vnto the Crosse: As in verse
Precious (saith he) is the bloud of them in the Lords sight.
Let these seeme to be sufficiently spoken touching the Argument of this
Psalme: Now let vs heare the Prophet Dauid excellently prophecying and preaching of Christ Iesus the Sauior that was and is to [leaf motif] The Psalme and Exposition thereof.
[Ver&s. Giue the king thy iudgements (O God:) and thy righteousnes vnto the kings sonne.
WHat maner of speaker Thucidides was in his Drations, such a one is the Prophet Dauid in his Psalms: so plentifull hee is in copie of matters, that the multitude of his wordes almost are supplied with as manie sentences.
Furthermore, so apt and strict he is in wordes, that a man cannot tell whether the things are with spéech, or the wordes with sentences more beautified.
For pray you consider how many great matters are included in one litle verse.
For first he teacheth what a one God is, namelie a iust iudge, that is allowing things well done, and disallowing and destroying the contrarie.
And surely such a God he is, according to the law: but indéede according to the Gospell, he is not onelie iust in accusing of sin, but also he maketh vngodlie ones become iust. which are just by faith in Christ, as it is said, Rom.
Secondlie, he aduertiseth the Reader touching the mysterie of the Trinitie.
For it is the euerlasting Father which deliuereth out of his power into the hands of his Son, both iudgemeent iustice.
The son receiueth the power deliuered vnto him from according to that saying, Ioh.
The Father iudgeth no man, but hath giuen all iudgement vnto his Sonne, which wee must so vnderstand touching the first comming of Christ, that the father iudgeth not alone, but by his sonne hee iudgeth and maketh his iudgement knowne: For by his Sonne hee maketh his Gospell knowen, preserueth the ministerie, and giueth the holie Ghost.
But touching his second comming, let vs hold fast that notable saying of Augustine cited by Prosperus, Senten.
Although the Father neuer departeth from the sonns, yet is it not saide that hee shall come to iudge the quicke and the dead, but the sonne shall iudge them, because there neither the deitie of the Father, nor of the sonne shall be séene, but that forme or likenes of the sonne which he hath vnited vnto him by the mysterie of his incarnation.
The same forme or likenes in him then shall be Iudge, which stood before the Iudge; the same shall iudge which hath bin iudged, that the wicked ones may beholde his glorie, against whose clemencie they haue grudged.
Such a Iudge therefore shall he appeare, as he may bee seene both of them whom hee shall crowne, and of them whom he shall condemne.
But the Father shall not then appeare, because he tooke not vpon him the shape of a seruant, but vnto his Sonne who was also made Man, hath be giuen all power of iudgement.
Thirdly, this first verse confirmeth the Reader to acknowledge Christ, not onelie to be the son of Dauid after the flesh, but also the verie son of God.
For God giueth not his glorie vnto anie other, as Esaias
Seeing then he deliuereth vnto this Sauiour both his iudgement and his iustice, we must no time doubt but that the Sauiour is trulie, and by nature God.
Fourthlie, this verse teacheth vs what are the benefities of this Sauiour; for iudgement by the phrase of the scripture signifieth a remoouing of euill, and the placing of that which is good, and righteousnes is the following of vertue, the eschuing of vice.
Therefore the benefites of this sauiour, are Deliuerance from sinne, eternall death and tyrannie of the Diuell. the gathering of the Church by the ministerie of the Gospell, the gift of the holie Ghost, defence and preseruation of the remnants of the Church in this life, and finally the rising of the godly ones from death vnto life euerlasting.
You see then what a pithie and profound Orator Dauid is here, and what great efficacie and value euerie worde of his hath.
[Ver&se Then shall hee iudge the people according vnto right, and defend the poore.
There is a diuerse vse of the worde iudgement, and in expounding, to obserue the same varietie it is profitable: somtime it signifieth, The taking awaie of euill, as when it is saide in the
haue done iudgement and iustice, that is, haue eschewed thinges forbidden, and done thinges commanded: in other places it signifieth Gouernement: So the gouernors of Gods people, are called Iudges.
Last of all, to let passe other significations, it is taken for mitigation of extreame law, as in Ierem.
Correct me Lorde in thy iudgement, not in thy wrath, least bee brought vnto nothing: That is, mitigate the paines which haue deserued. do not deale with me according to the exiremitie of the law.
This Grammaticall admonition if we rightlie consider, this second verse is easilie expounded: As if he said, craue of God that he would sende the promised deliuerer, that hee would gouerne his people in his righteousnesse; that is, in abolishing sinne and death; that he would restore vnto his church righteousnesse and life euerlasting: And defend the poore as if he said, Hee will not deale extremelie with suters, or poore in spirit, but he will take vpon him to defend their cause, hee will maintaine them against their accusers, and hee will strengthen them and staie them frée and discharged in iudgement: Hee will also represse the rage of the Deuill, Tyrants and fanaticall persons: and he will mitigate the thraldome of the bodies of his seruantes captiued.
[Ver&se The mountaines also shall bring peace, and the little hils righteousnesse vnto the people.
The mountaines and little hilles are the churches or congregations and their ministers: These bring peace in righteousnesse; that is, they teach, That being iustified by faith wee haue peace with God: For, Who shall accuse the Elect ones of God? shall God, which iustifieth? who is it that shall condemne? is it Christ, who died, yea and rose againe, who sitteth at the right hand of God and maketh intercession for vs? And againe, Iohn.
He that hath my word and bleeueth in him that sent me hath life euerlasting, and commeth not into iudgement, but goeth by death vnto life.
For this righteousnes and peace, let vs giue so great thankes vnto God as the whole scope of our liuelie hart can conceiue, and let vs eschew all contrarie opinions and religions which trouble this peace.
[Ver&se He shall iudge the simple folke by their right, defend the children of the needie, and punish the wrong doer.
These are speaches Correlatiues as the Logicians vse thus to saie.
Now then here bee desribeth the people of this king: and the desecription agreeeth with the saying of Sophonias
will leaue in the midst of thee a needy and poore congregation; yet trusting in the name of the Lord.
tryeth outwarde fightinges and feeleth inwarde feares: Therefore both maner of waies it is a congregation poore and néedefull, not onely because it is destritute of humane helpes, but also because it carieth about in the heart sorrowes and feares rising from acknowledgement of sinne, and the wrath of God: but there is a two fold kind of consolation set downe; one as the Psalme affirmeth, The Sauiour shall heale the woundes of the hart according to that saying, Matth.
Come vnto me all ye which labour and are laden, and will refresh you.
The other in that he threatneth punishmentes vnto backbiters, slanderers, which inflameth mindes of kinges and princes against the Chruch.
This conclusion sith it is necessarie for the vniuersall Chruch, euen then speciallie is it so in the behalfe of poore people and Orphanes, which are made open praies for all backbiters and slaunderers.
[Ver&se They shall feare thee as long as the Sunne and moone endureth: from one generation to another.
To feare God by an vsuall phrase of the scripture, signifieth not onelie to feare the wrath and iudgement of God, but also in a sort to serue or worship God: And the feare of God signifieth all the worship done vnto God, or all the obedience due vnto God.
This verse teacheth vs then that Christ the sauiour is not honoured with expences or outwarde pompe, nor tragedies of captiues, but with duties by vs done, touching which the lawe morall preacheth, and therewith affirmeth that the Church shall not bee vtterlie destroied in this world.
This promise ought to bee acceptable vnto the godlie ones, especiallie when the turkish armies are within their beholding; which practise no other thing but to destroie the preaching of the gospell, and scatter abroad the congregation of Gods Church.
And although some dispute whether the kingdome at Christ be euerlasting, seeing Paule saith,
Then shall the sonne deliuer the kingdome vnto the father: Yet the kingdome of the sonne without all doubting is euerlasting, because in all eternitie, hée raigneth together with the father and the holie ghost, and remaineth the heade of the church: And whereas Paule saith,
That the sonne in the last day of the worlde shall deliuer the kingdome vnto the father; let that be vnderstoode thus: The sonne shall bring vnto the Father the Church gathered throughout all mankinde, and then all the whole godhead shall be seene in presence and shall raigne, not by the ministerie of the gospel, but immediatly or without anie meane.
With this simple vnderstanding let vs be contented, least we séeme to seeke to be more wise then it behooueth vs. [Ver&se He shal come down like the raine into fleece of wool; euen as the drops that water the earth.
There is no doubt but the prophet doth allude in this verse vnto the historie of Gedeon which is recited in lib. Iudicum.
But other interpreters do applie this figure taken out of the history of Gedeon, another waie: For some doe refer it vnto the birth of the son of God borne of the virgne: as the meaning might thus be, Christ like vnto the deaw of heauen was conceiued by the holy ghost in the wombe of the virgin Mary, without all spot of sinne.
This interpretation, though reiect not, séeing it agréeth with the analogy or rule of faith: yet do more allowe the application thereof vnto the kingdome of Christ: For like as grasse reuiueth and refresheth his colour when the deawe falleth vpon it; so our hearts, when we heare the preaching of the gospell conceiue new comfort, which is the beginning and taste of life euerlasting.
Againe also, that similitude maie well bee considered herein which in the same historie is set downe: Before Christ was borne the sinagogue was a fleece of wool wet with heauenlie dewe: Now the drie lande, that is, the Gentiles are watered with this dewe.
What shall saie of the wonderfull and almost incredible victorie of Gedeon? vnto whom Esayas in the
chapter compareth the triumph of Christ: For as Gedeon leaueth forth a slender hoast against the huge multitude of his enemies, and yet by God obtained the victorie: so wee wretched and weake soules following the gouernement and good guide of the sonne of God our Captaine Christ, in the onelie preaching of the gospell which we professe, and with the sparke of faith shining in miseries, doc ouercome most mightie enemies.
Martin Luther set forth in his exposition vppon the ninth chapter of Esay: Hee therefore that will may read thereof in that place.
[Ver&se In his time shall the righteous flourish: yea and abundance of peace so long as the moone endureth.
He repeateth a sermon as it were of the effects of Christs kingdome, namelie righteousnesse and peace: In the Church shall both righteousnesses flourish: the one of Faith, whereby the person is accepted and pleasing vnto God, fréely for the Mediators sake.
The other of a good conscience, touching which let vs hold fast that most swéete saying of Nazianzen.
Nothing so much reioyceth vs as a pure conscience, and a good hope.
&c. that is tranquilitie of the heart rising from faith, hope, and a good conscience.
Nowe consider what a thing it is not to be pluckt away from God, and to be able to haue accesse vnto God, to call vpon him, craue and looke for helpe of him, as in the
vers. of saint Iohn. it is said, If our heart condemne vs not, then haue we boldness towardes God.
But the particle touching the eternitie of peace must not be at a blush, as wee say, but throughlie looked vpon.
For it containeth most sweet consolation, which Isayas expresseth, cap.
in these wordes, The hilles shall be mooued, and the little hilles shall tremble, but my mercie shall not depart from thee, neither shall the couenant of my peace fall away, saith thy mercifull Lorde: That is, though of kingdomes shall shake and terrifie the Church verie sore, yet my couenant that haue made with my Church shall be firme, for euer ratified and vnmooueable.
Let vs be quietlie contented with this league or couenant. yea though the whole world frushed togither fall downe about vs. [Ver&s. His dominion also shall bee from the one sea to the other: and from the flood vnto the worlds end, The kings of Babylon and Persia held in their power verie rich kingdoms: but these kingdoms were included within the limits of Asia; Alexander the great ioined some part of Europe vnto the Empire of Asia: The Romane Empire greatest of all others, was extended no further then Euphrate: Finally, no gouernment in ye whole world was contained in the proper iurisdiction: wherefore seeing Christes kingdome is comprehended within the same boundes wherein the whole world is comprehended, doubtles we must confesse that this kingdome is not a worldlie Empire, like as the Iewes do dream.
But peraduenture some man would ask what maner of kingdom, the kingdom of Christ is? There is nothing that we may so easily expresse.
The kingdome of the Christ in this life; is to kéepe and restore the ministerie of the Gospell: also to gather and reuiue the Church with his worde and holie spirit giuen, and to protect her wonderfullie against the diuels and tyrants, after this life to raise her members vp from death to life, and bring them to his eternall Father.
Out of this description maie be taken the difference of Christes kingdome and a politike kingdome.
Also they differ in obiects, in benefites, in forme of gouernment, glorie, defences, and stabilitie: for, first the politike power gouerneth the part which is moueable, and brideleth the externall members, that they may remaine within their duties: but the kingdome of Christ not onelie gouerneth externall manners, but reprehendeth and healeth the hearts, as in Isay,
Secondlie, the chiefe benefits of politike power are discipline and peace of bodies: but the spirituall and eternall benefits of this kingdome, are righteousnesse and peace of conscience before God.
Thirdlie, they differ in forme gouernment: for other kings and princes chuse fit ministers to beare authoritie in the endued with wisedome and eloquence: but Christ chooseth the foolish things of this world to confound the wisedome of the wise: or as the Psalme, ver.
Out of the mouth of verie babes and sucklings, he hath made perfect his kingdome.
Moreouer they differ in forme of execution, as in defence, and punishments: for the politike power defendeth his subiects with weapons, and punisheth disobedient persons with corporall force, or with the sworde: but Christ by the preaching of the Gospell giueth euerlasting benefits, remission of sinnes, the holie Ghost, and life euerlasting, and punisheth disobedient persons, not with corporall force, but with his worde, namelie lawfull excommunication.
Fourthlie, they differ in glorie: for the glorie of gouernments is in the excellencie of counsell in ciuill or peaceable gouernment, and in valiancie and good successe in warre: but the proper glorie of the Church in this life is, true knowledge of God, prayer, profession of the true doctrine, and perpetuall preseruation of the Church, although shee bee persecuted in some members.
The greatnes of minds in ouercomming or vanquishing all inticements and terrifying torments of the wicked, the ornament of manie vertues wherein the presence of God is perceiued and seene.
Fiftlie, the defences of a politike kingdome are hoasts of men, and riches necessarie in charges of domesticall affaires to maintaine warres abroad: but the Church is not defended with visible helpes, but is gouerned by the sonne of God, and hath the Angels her super intendents or watchmen.
Lastlie, they differ in stabilitie: for all politike gouernements haue their end and limit of time: but of this kingdome there shall bee none end, because the king in eternall, and he giueth vnto his people eternall life, which is here begun, and shall be accomplished after the resurrection.
These things must bee often recited touching the difference betweene Christs kingdome, and politike kingdomes: not onelie to refuse the Iewes, but euen to instruct vs also, least the consolation inuocation vpon the Sonne of God, and our exercises of faith be obscured or darkened with politike imaginations.
For the eyes being bent vpon politike benefits (when they are once gon) do think that the church is but a castaway from god.
This imagination must we refuse, and stedfastlie, beleeue, that true beléeuers are not therfore, cast away from the sonne of God, no though they be in the middes of punishments or torments: for as saint Paule saith, We stand, and reioyce vnder the hope of the glorie of God not onelie, but also We reioyce in tribulations, &c. Rom.
[Ver&s. They that dwell in the wildernes, shall kneele before him: his enemies shall licke the dust.
[Ver&s. The kings of Tharshis and of the Isles shall bring presents: the kings of Arabia and Saba shall bring gifts.
[Ver&s. All kings shall fall downe before him: all nations shall do him seruice.
He amplifieth the maiestie of Christs kingdome: the inhabitants of the wildernes (saith he) shall not onelie be petitioners vnto this king, but euen they also which dwell in faire and sumptuous houses, which are garnishcd with costly works and pictures: and neither shall his friends but euen his enemies also humble themselues and fall down before this Lord.
What shall say of the kings which shall be nursing fathers of Christs kingdome: for in all ages from the first beginning of mankind there haue béene, are, shalbe some magistrates chosen of God vnto euerlasting saluation, and called vnto the societie of the true Church, as Nebuchadnezar, and Euilmerodach in the kingdome of Babylon, Darius Medus, Cyrus, and Artaxerxes with the long, hande so called, in the kingdome of Persia: and Constantine, Valentinian, Theodosius, Charles the great, and certeine other in the Empire of Rome.
All Iurie went out vnto Iohn Baptist, is the figure Synecdoche, (i. part for the whole) so in this verse [All kings shall fall downe before him] the vniuersall particle must be restrained.
For it both not signifie that all kings shal become the friends of Christ, but some cut of all kingdomes.
Now sée pray you, howe great a glorie it may bee, that not onlie obscure and base persons shall embrase the preaching of the Gospel, but euen mightie kings and Monarches: Also vnto those kings which are conuerted to Christ shall nothing be attributed more glorious, then that they are reputed called citizens and members of the true Church of Christ.
[Ver&s. For he shall deliuer the poore when he crieth: the needy also and him that hath no helper.
[Ver&s. He shal bee fauourable to the simple and needie: and shall preserue the soules of the poore.
[Ver&se He shall deliuer their soules from falshood and wrong: deare shall their bloud be in his sight.
This is a most swéet and delectable reason of the former next verses: As if he said, therefore shall they fall down and worship him, because he helpeth them that call vpon him, when they are forsaken of earthlie creatures.
This sentence is greatlie set forth in the example of our first parents.
Adam and Eua after their fall could neither be helped by Angels, their own deuises, nor yet by anie other creature: Here commeth Christ the sonne of God from his secret seat, receiueth offenders into fauour, and giueth them life.
So afterwards followed innumerable eramples of this Lordes benefits besides and without second causes: as when he preserued Noah in the deluge: when he saued Ioseph whom his brethren would haue slain: when he made an open waie for the people of Israell to passe through the red sea: and afterwards performed manie benefits vnto them besides and without all second causes or meanes.
Like as he defended Dauid against Golias, and others: as he saued the
men in the burning ouen: Daniell amongst the Lions, and Ionas in the whales belly: And al men which call vpon God, may declare and speak of some deliuerances which they haue had; when they haue béene manifestlie preserued besides and without second causes.
Furthermore, whereas the church is for most part rent in péeces with discords of opinions and féeleth the crueltie of tyrants; this psalme promiseth her deliuerance from the wicked craft of hereticks, and violence of Nero, Dioclesian and such like tyrants.
But truly when thinke vpon this verse the fable of the Viper and the palme commeth into my minde: For like as the viper is with the palme leaues nourished, and with the same againe destroyed: so Heretikes abusing the scripture are refuted by the testimonies of scripture rightly conferred: as although Samosatenus corrupteth the first chapter of S. Iohns gospel; yet in the course of the same sermon conference of other testimonies he may be euidently refuted or conuinced.
But as vnto Tyrants appertaineth this Psalme in this place doth notably comfort vs; He shall deliuer their soules from falshoode and wrong, &c.
That is, he shall inflame their hearts with ioy and gladnes the vanquisher of death, and shall giue them life euerlasting, according to that saying, Iohn.
And their blood shall be precious, because tyrants shall suffer great iust torments for their crueltie vsed against the godlie ones: and partlie because by this testimonie of their death the truth of Christs doctrine is sealed and confirmed.
But inasmuch as elsewhere haue often spoken touching the punishments for tyrants, and the sufferings of Martyrs, nowe willinglie omit the recitall of them in this place.
[Ver&s. He shal liue, and vnto him shall be giuen of the golde of Arabia: prayers shall be euermade vnto him, and daylie shall he be praised.
We do remember that D. Martin Luther oftentimes said: In the olde Testament there is a notable witnes of the Godhead of the Sauiour promised; which affirmeth that he was called vpon, by this propertie the same sauiour is there discerned from other Prophets.
That most graue witnes was by some complained to be obscured weakned by translating the same inuocation vnto other men.
And for that one cause (saide he) the custome of praying vnto others was to bee disallowed.
But where the Prophet Dauid affirmeth here, that this Sauiour shall liue, &c.
Let that be vnderstoode in that meaning touching which Christ saith, Iohn,
That is, like as of mine owne power do liue, séeing that am consubstantiall with the father, and second person in deitie: so by my merit, and through my effectuall working you shall liue also: for in dying haue destroied death, and in rising againe haue restored life, as in the old godly verse the Church so singeth: Yea will raise vp againe your bodies from death, and these euen counited with your soules, will adorne with gifts agréeable vnto the state of life euerlasting.
[Ver&s. There shall bee an heape of corne vpon the earth, high vpon the hilles: his fruit shall shake like Libanus, and shal be greene in the citie like grasse vpon the earth.
He compareth the fruitfulnesse of the Church or kingdome of Christ vnto the most lightsom flourishing corne, which is answerable to the husbandmans praier and expectation.
For as the thicke growing corne delighteth the beholders: so there is no sight more pleasant then to see the flourishing Churches, wherein vnto the puritie of doctrine preached, the concorde of the teachers is adioined or annexed.
There is a great force in the Nowne Bar: which signifieth most pure wheate: as if hee should say; In the Church of Christ shall not beare sway anie vaine chaffe of humne traditions, which haue no iuice in them: but wheat shall flourish, which with the body of man hath great affinitie: for eue~ as of liuely wheat, the best blood is increased: so the Gospel deliuered without corruption, bringeth to the godly ones firme consolation.
[Ver&s. His name shall endure for euer, his name shall remaine vnder the Sun among the posterities, which shal be blessed through him: and all the heathen shall praise him.
This verse glistereth most clearelie like a notable precious stone throughout the whole Psalme; for it teacheth the reader touching the divine nature and benefits of the sauior, and touching the calling of the Gentils.
It cleerelie affirmeth that this lord hath alwaies bin, as he himselfe saith.
And he vseth the word Linnon the generation of the son from the father eternall.
This our deliuerer went forth before the daies of the world: That is, hee was the sonne of God before he tooke vpon him nature of man.
Let vs beleeue therefore being confirmed with these like testimonies, that the Sauiour is God indeed, and by nature the son of God, light of light, as in the Creed it is said.
But although there be manie descriptions which teach why and for what cause the son was sent: yet the effect of the matter is brieflie in the worde Blessed signified.
And for that by the wanting of any thing, the same may bee better estéemed which we haue, as by darknes light, let vs see what the curse is.
All mankind after our first fall was ouerthrowne with the curse of the law: that is, of gods wrath, of euerlasting death by reason of sin: as Paule saith, Ephes.
We were by nature the children of wrath, euen as others were.
This curse when no creature could take away or blot out, the sonne of God tooke vpon himselfe, both the wrath of God and our punishments, that his father might be at peace with vs. So Paule Gal.
interpreteth the promise giuen to Abraham: In thy seed shal al the Gentiles be blessed.
Christ became accursed for vs, and redeemed vs from the curse, that we might obtaine the blessing of Abraham, Last of all let the particle be considered touching the calling of the Gentiles. in this verse, The posterities shall be blessed in him, and all the heathen shall praise him.
For the calling of Gentiles is a notable testimonie of Paules affirmattion, wherein it is saide, Ro~
Grace oueraboundeth aboue sin: for no man can without some humbling of his mind read the examples of mischief striuing with the first and second table, wherein the Ethnickes wickedlie and filthily with great rashnes and impudencie are defiled Let vs therefore giue God thankes that hee receiueth such castawayes into sauour, and coopteth them into the societie of Christs kingdome.
[Ver&s. Blessed be the Lord God, euen the God of Israel, which onely doth wonderous things.
[Ver. And blessed be the name of his maiestie for euer: and al the earth shall be filled with his maiestie, Amen, Amen.
It liketh me well in this place to set downe the words of D. Luther, expounding the
ca. of the prophet Mic: Like as the deliuerance in the new testament is by many waies greater and more excelle~t then that which was out of Egypt: so are the new miracles by infinite meanes farre greater then the olde: for what might be more wonderfully said, then that son of God take upon him nature of man, and was borne of a virgin? What is more to be amazed at, then when the son of god wrastling, with death and Sathan, suffered himselfe to be ouercome, laieth downe his life before these enemies, and while he is ouercome, conquereth? So a speciall miracle it is, that Christ, dying like a man vpon the crosse, did the third day rise againe from death and (out of the graue closed vp) after this with immortall flesh ascended vnto heauen, and sitteth at the right hand of God: what may be like notablie said, yea or thought of any other miracles in respect of these? Therefore belssed be God, who onelie doth these and other myracles.
Here end the prayers of Dauid the sonne of Ishai.

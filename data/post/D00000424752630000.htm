right worshipful

we your distressed tenants in alvandley do certifie unto you how it hath pleased almighty god to shew his great power in that terrible storm of thunder lightning rain great wind and hail that lighted on us your worships distressed tennants in alvandley the of june
but we are not able to express the terribleness of it in full being too apt to forget like pharoah of old but seeing it hath left such memorable monuments of the destructiveness of it all the beholders have stood amazed at it fetching tears from the eyes of the many having come far to see it and said if it had been attested to them upon oath how destructive it was they could not have believed it had been so till they came to see it

may it please you that after great lightning thunder and rain there arose a great terrible wind which brought with it the great hail in abundance which at the first dash broke all our glass windows that were on the sides of our houses the wind at that instant coming from thence upon us and issued a flashing fire that accompanied with great thunder the hail came with great vioience and had sharp ends and edges like broken ice cutting smiting and driving down all tops of trees and young plants and cut the backs of our kine till blood issued therefrom and bruised the elders and paps and wonderfully affrighted them that they ran as if they had been mad leaping out of their pastures some into pits and were almost drowned some people that were out of doors were ill beaten and bruised ere they could get to shelter themselves that to our knowledge their flesh was as black as pots and scarce able to go
although praised be god he in his infinite mercy spared both man and beast alive which is no small wonder for it killed flying fowl both crows and pyes and other fowl
several of our buildings were shattered and battered by it and the roofs of both thatch and slate torn and uncovered some walls both timber and stone driven down the windmill was blown and driven down nay which is most remarkable it broke strong sound trees of a great substance off in the middle and blew down very many

fruit trees and destroyed all the fruits the which were abundance before the storm was and did so cut and bruise all sorts of fruit trees and other trees that we think they will hardly get recovery the being many of them sharp that they slit the bark of trees as if done with a knife if any apple be left it seems as if it were cut with a knife
all our gardens plants and flowers are destroyed but what were within ground our hedges and quicksets are pill'd so as the leaf and bark is not left
but we may say this is little in comparison of the loss of our corn in every sort of grain which was smitten very terrible viz
wheat rye barly oates pease beans french with our flax and hemp in a word all was by the said storm of hail destroyed so that some have plowed it up where their corn was and sowed it again some have plowed it for summer work and some have turned their cattle into their corn fields and some others let it lie to see what the lord will be pleased to do with it

the of the town that usually hath been let from to and sometimes at the morning after the storm none would have given for it the loss of our meadowing is not a whit behind the rest to the great damage of the town most of the town folk being daries the grass was beaten and battered as if pounded in a mortar so that there is little left and what between the sap of trees corn and grass
our pits and ditches are dyed like tanners
we heard that our neighbouring townsmen were so sorry for us that one said he would if the rest would do likewise give us a load of hay for relief of our cattle
the hail and wind continued about half an hour the were of divers shapes some with sharp ends and edges and like your smiths cynders some say there were of or inches about but we were so affrighted that night we did not regard to measure them but next day there was measured that were inches about and on the friday following which was days after there was found in old thatch hail that was inches about we cannot express our loss sustained by the said wind and hail there was such abundance of it and it beat mightily into our houses that our old corn cheese meat bedding and other houshold goods received great damage by it all the substance of the storm lighted on our village as it afterwards appeared for that way the storm drove it passed by the neighbouring towns the hill being betwixt them and us so they sustained very little loss by it
truly since the great hail in the land of egypt we do not hear that the like hath been seen for thunder hail and fire mingled with it flashing upon the ground as it appeared to many that beheld it and came with such a heideous noise that cannot be express'd betwixt the hail and wind its violence was great being in such abundance that it lay in some places three quarters of a yard deep and beat up the ground and drove it on heaps in some places and after it followed a great damp or mist with a very offensive smell but we desire to give glory and thanks to almighty god that spared our lives and the lives of our cattle when it had been so easie a thing to destroy us when stronger things were destroyed but that he pleased to give a commission to its strong force and no further to proceed
and we humbly pray god that we who have seen and felt his mighty power and all others who only hear of this relation may make a right improvemen of it to the glory of almighty god and our own souls good

and we whose names are hereunto subscribed do humbly conclude that all our losses in the particulars within the precincts of alvanley will amount unto the sum of several and upwards unless god in his infinite mercy find out a way for our relief but it pittys our hearts most of all for our poor widows and fatherless whose whole years profits are destroyed

we whose names are hereunto subscribed shall be ready to attest what is here written for certain truths and no feigned things

[Figure: DROIT ET LOYAL HONI &whbull SOIT &whbull QVI &whbull MAL &whbull &whbull PENSE [Figure: royal blazon or coat of arms] To the right Honorable the Lord Robert Dudley, Earle of Leicester, Baron of Denbigh, Knight of the most noble Orders of the Garter, and of Saint Michaell, one of hir Maiesties moste Honourable priuie Counsell, and Maister of hir Horsse.
THe good acceptatio~ of my Summarie dedicated to your Lordship fiue yeares since (right honorable my singular good Lord) hathe so emboldened this Treatise, growne now to a greater Volume, that it presumeth with assured hope of like acceptance, to present it selfe to your Honor, vnder the protectio~ therof, to venture into the world, and viewe of men: and that the more boldly, being an Historical Discourse of this oure natiue Countrie, setting before our eyes, to our instruction profite, the incredible inconstancie, continuall alterations of this transitorie world, wyth the worthie exploites of our Kings and Gouernors.
What haue performed herein to the common commoditie in searching out the truth: and what varietie of worthy matters haue recouered, with no small coste and care, out of the graue of Obliuion, wherein they haue laine buried, referre to your honorable censure, and the indifferent Reader, not doubting but your Lordship, whiche hath gotten grounded experience by the administration of most weighty affaires, furnished your wisedome wyth diligent reading of sundrie Histories, will bothe vouche safe to accepte this Monument of my affectionate minde with your wonted curtesie, and shield it vnder the autoritie of your name against those, whiche in this age requite honest endeuours with vnhonest speeches.
The Almighty God preserue your Honor, with continual encrease of his benefits, to his glory, and your aduauncement.
AMongst other Bookes which are in this our learned age published in great numbers, there are few, eyther for the honestie of the matter, or commoditie which they bring to the common wealth, or for the pleasantnesse of the studie and reading, to be preferred before the Chronicles and Hystories.
What examples of men deseruing immortalitie, of exploites worthy great renowne, of vertuous liuing of the posteritie to be embraced, of wise handling of weighty affaires, diligently to be marked, and aptly to be applied: what incouragement of nobilitie to noble feates, what discouragement of vnnaturall subiects from wicked treasons, pernitious rebellions, and damnable doctrines: to conclude, what perswasion to honestie, godlynesse, and vertue of all sorts, what dissuasions from the contrary is not plentifully in them to be found? So that it is as hard a matter for the Readers of Chronicles, in my fansie, to passe without some colours of wisedome, inuitements to vertue, and loathing of naughtie factes, as it is for a welfauoured man to walke vp and downe in the hot parching Sunne, not to be therewith sunburned.
They therefore which with long studie, earnest good will, to their great costes and charges haue brought hidden Histories from duskie darkenesse to the sight of the world, and haue bin diligent obseruers of common wealthes, and noted for the posteritie the fleeting manners of the people, and accidents of the times: deserue (at the least) thankes for their paines, and to be misreported of none, seeing they haue laboured for all.
write not this to complayne of some mens ingratitude towardes me (although iustly might) but to shewe the commodities which ensue of the reading of Histories, that seeing they are so great and so many, all men would (as they ought) imploy their diligence in the honest, fruitefull, and delectable perusing of the same, and so to accompt of the Authors, as of men carefull for their Countrey: and to confesse, if neede require, by whome they haue taken profite.
It is now seuentene yeres since (I seing the confuse order of our late English Chronicles, and the ignorant handling of auntient affaires) leauing myne owne peculiar gaines, consecrated my selfe to the search of our famous Antiquities.
What haue done in them before time, the former editions of my Summarie of Chronicles maye wel testifie, but howe farre (be it spoken without arrogancie) haue laboured for the truth more tha~ some other, this last edition wil euidently declare: wherein, that differ from the inordinate and vnskilful collections of other men, it is no maruel, seeing that doe not fully agree with my selfe, as some malitious persons haue fondely charged me: but lette it be considered, that there is nothing perfect at the first, and that it is incident to mankinde to erre and slippe sometime, but onelye the point of fantasticall fooles, to perseuer and continue in their errors.
Wherfore, seeing that the perusing of auncient Records and best approued Histories of all times (not without great difficultie obteined) doe not onely moue me, but for their aucthoritie driue me to acknowledge both mine and other mens errors, and in acknowledging to correct them, truste to obtaine thus muche at your handes, that at the leaste you wil call to remembraunce a moste gentle and wise lawe of the politike Persians, wherein it was enacted, that a man accused to bee in their lawes a trespasser, and founde guiltie of the crime, should not straight waye bee condemned, but after a diligent enquirie and searche of his whole life and conuersation (no slaunder imputed vnto him as of importaunce) if the number of his laudable factes didde counteruaile the contrarie, he was full quit of the trespasse.
The same lawe do wishe the readers of these my Chronicles to put in vre, that if the errors be not so plentiful, as Histories truely alleadged, they wil beare with them: for as promised, so haue tried all matters worthie of immortalitie, by the certaine Touchstone of best allowed Historiographers: and yet notwithstanding, some faults by misprinting haue escaped the correction, whiche easily may be seene and amended by the diligent Reader.
[leaf motif] briefe Description of Englande, Scotlande, VVales, and Cornvvall.
BRitaine, or Brutanne which by two names is cal+led England and Scotland, is an Ilande in the Ocean Sea, scituate right ouer against France: one parte of which Isle Englishmen do inhabite, another parte Scottes, the thirde parte Walshme~, and the fourth part Cornishmen.
All they eyther in language, conditions, or lawes, do differ among themselues.
England (so called of Englishmen whiche did winne the same) is the greatest parte, and is diuided into xl. Counties, which we call Shires: whereof ten (that is to say) Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Southampton, Barkeshire, Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, Somersetshire, Deuonshire and Cornwal, doe conteyne ye first part of that Iland: which part bounding toward the South, standeth betwéene the Thames and the Sea.
From thence to the riuer of Trent, which passeth through the middest of England be. xvj. shyres, wherof the first sixe (sta~ding Eastward) are Essex, Middlesex, Hartfordshire, Suffolk, Northfolke, and Cambridgeshire: the other ten whiche stande more in the middle of the Country are these: Bedforde, Huntingdon, Buckingham, Oxforde, Northampton, Rutland, Leicester, Notingham, Warwike, and Lincolne.
After these there be. vj. which border westwarde vppon Wales as Gloucester, Hereford, Worcester, Shropshire, Stafford, Chester, and Monmouth.
About the middle of the Region lie Darbishire, Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Cumberlande.
Against the same is the Bishoppricke of Durham, and Northumberlande, whiche boundeth vpon the North in the Marches of Scotland.
Winchester hath Hampshire, Surrey, and the Isle of Wight, Salisburie hath Barkeshire, and Wiltshire.
Couentrie and Lichfield hath Staffordshyre, Darbishire, part of Warwickshyre, and part of Shropshyre.
Lincolne which is the gretest, lying betwéene the Thames and Humbre, hath Lincolne, Leycester, Huntington, Bedforde, Buckingham, and the residue of Hartfordshire.
And this is the prouince of the Archbishop of Canterburie, whych is the Primate of all England, wyth Wales.
The Archbishop of Yorke, hath Yorkeshire, Notinghamshire, and a piece of Lancashire.
The Bishop of Durha~ hath the Bishoprike so commonly called, and Northumberlande.
Chester hath Chesshire, most part of Lancashire, Richmonde, part of Flintshire, and part of Denbighshire.
Carlile conteyneth Cumberlande and Westmerlande: and thys is the other Prouince of the Archbishoppe of Yorke, whiche is another primate of England, and was of long time also primate of al Scotland: but these Dioceses take their names of the Cities where those Seas be placed, the chiefe whereof, is London· where in the beginning was the Archbishops Sea, but afterwards transposed to Canterbury, a Cittie in Kente, placed in a soyle amiable and pleasaunt.
London standeth in Middlesex, on the Northe side of the Thames.
That most excellent and goodly riuer hath first the name of Ise, and beginneth in Coteswolde in Glocestershire, about a mile from Titbery, and as much from the high waye called Frosse: and it taketh firste the name néere to Dorcester bridge, where the riuer Tame and the forsayde Ise méete, and so with a maruellous quiet course it passeth by London, and then breaketh into the French Ocean by maine tydes, whiche twice in xxiiij. houres space doeth ebbe and flow more than lx. myles, to the great commoditie of trauellers, by whiche all kindes of Marchandice be easilye conueyed to London, the principal store staple for al co~modities within this realm.
Upo~ ye same riuer is placed a stone bridge, a work very rare and maruellous, which bridge hath (reckning ye draw bridge) xx. arches made of foursquare stone, of height.
lx. foote, of bredth. xxx. foote, distant one fro~ another xx. foote, compacte ioyned togither with vaults and cellers.
Uppon both sides be houses builded, that it séemeth rather a continual stréete than a bridge.
The Ocea~ sea doth bound England, the first part of Brytaine, East South, Wales Cornwal West.
The length of the Iland beginneth at Portsmouth in ye South parte, endeth at Twede in the North, contayning.
Thys Realme aboue other is moste fruitefull on thys syde Humbre: for beyonde it is fuller of Mountaines.
And althoughe to the beholders of that Countrey a farre off, it maye séeme playne, yet it is full of manye hilles, and those for the moste parte voyde of trées, the valleyes whereof be verye delectable, inhabited for the moste part by noble men, who according to auntiente and old order· desire not to dwel in Cities, but neare vnto valleyes and riuers in seuerall villages, for auoyding of vehement windes, bicause that Iland naturally is stormie.
Humbre hath his beginning a little on this side Yorke, by and by runneth Southward, and then holdeth his course Eastward, and so into the maine Sea, greatlye encreased by the Riuers of Dune and Trent.
Trent beginneth a little from Stafforde, running through Darbishyre, and Leicestershire, passing by Litchfielde Notingham on ye right hand, Dune on the left ha~d: so that both those riuers do make an Ileland whiche is called Auxolme, and then ioyning togither on this side Kingstone vpon Hul, a goodly marchaunt Towne, they fall into Humbre: by whiche riuer they may ariue out of Fraunce, Germanie and Denmarke.
England is fruitefull of beastes, and aboundeth with cattel: wherby the inhabitants be rather for the most part grasiers than ploughmen, bycause they giue themselues more to féeding, than to tillage.
So that almoste the third part of the Countrey is employed to Cattell, Déere red and fallowe, Gotes, (wherof there be store in the North parts) Conies, for euery where there is iolly maintenaunce of those kindes of beastes, bycause it is full of great woods: where of there ryseth pastime of hunting, gretly exercised, specially by the Nobilitie and Gentlemen.
Andrew Bourd sayth, there be moe Parkes in England than in all Europe beside.)
Scotland an other part of Brytain, (wherof in this place haue thought good to treate at large, that no further mentio~ of the situation therof might be made hereafter) began sometime at the Hill called Grampius, nowe called Grantsbeyn stretching to the furthest coaste Northwarde, but after the ouerthrowe of the Pictes, it began at the Riuer Twede· and sometimes at the Riuer of Tyne, the fortune of warres altering the same, as it doth al other things.
Therfore the length of Scotland from Twede to the furthest coaste, is estéemed to be
miles: But as Scotland is longer than Englande, so it is narrowe and endeth like a wedge.
For the mountayne Grampius is euil fauoured and craggie, which Tacitus in the life of Iulius Agricola doth remember, pearcing throughe the bowels of Scotland, from the coast of the Germaine sea, that is to say, from the mouth of ye Riuer of Dee to the Irishe sea, euen to the Laake of Lomunde, whiche lyeth betwéene that Countrey and the same hil.
The riuer of Twede (which springeth out of a little hyl, not far beyond Roxborough) is mingled with the Germaine Ocean, ioyning Southward with that Countrey whiche is called the Marches, being the east bounds betwéen England Scotland.
The said riuer of Twede separateth ye Marches from Northumberland, the furthest Countrey of Englande, hauing prospect to the Germaine Sea, the chiefe town wherof is Barwicke, nowe in possession of the English.
The Westerne limit of Scotlande whilom was Cumberlande, whiche the Riuer of Solue deuideth from Annandale.
Next to the Marches Pictlande bordereth, nowe tearmed Loughdean, bounding vpo~ the East, a very hillie Countrey, barren almost of any trées.
The most famous townes of the same be Dunbar, Hadington, Leith, Northberwik, Edenborough, the Kings seate, where also is the Castel of Maydens, a very strong and defensible place.
The same Citie the riuer of Forthea (commo~ly called the Frith) doth water and passe by: whiche being caried into the Germaine Ocean, maketh greate armes or meres, commonly called the Scottish sea: wherein besides other is the Iland of Saint Columbe, by name called Aemonia.
The same riuer agayne deuideth from Loughdean a Countrey adioyning (aboundant of all things) called ye Fife, in whych Country are many townes, as Donfermile, Cupre, but the notable town of Saint Andrewe, speciallye famous for the Uniuersitie, and beautified with the sea of the Archbishoppe and primate of all Scotlande.
On the other side towardes the Irishe side Northwarde, is Nidisdalia, so called of the Riuer that passeth therby, where bee the strong townes of Douglasse and Donfriese.
Upon the South adioyneth Galloway, more aboundaunte of Fodder for Cattel, than of Wheate, wher is the Towne of Candida Casa, now called Whitherne, and the auntient te~ple of Saint Ninian, adourned also with an Episcopal Sea.
In those parts besides the towne of Wighton is a laake of a wonderfull nature, bycause the one side in Winter doeth fréese, and the other not.
By that standeth the Countrey of Caricta, once renoumed, wyth the towne Caricton, whereof perchaunce it tooke the name.
Aboue Caricta towardes the West, is Elgonia (by which name Ptolome calleth the Countrey) bordering vppon the Ocean, wherein is the Laake Lomunde, whiche is very brode and large, contayning manye Ilandes, situate at the foote of the mountaine Grantesbeyn, eyght myles from the Castell of Donbriton, besides the riuer Bodotria, now named Leuinus, entring into the riuer of Glota or Clude.
Here some do contende that the name of Bodotria is not well applyed to Leuinus, bycause it appeareth by Cornel.
Tacitus, that Bodotria Glota haue sundry passages into ye sea, and are clearely dirempte one from the other, as Leuinus and Glota are not: wherfore they iudge rather the riuer nowe called the Frith to be that which of olde time had to name Bodotria, and to proue the same, they adde manye other reasons, whiche here omitte.
But a good space on thys side Grampius riseth the riuer of Taus, the greatest in all Scotland, taking his name of a Laake from whence it springeth, whiche falleth by Atholia and Calidonia by many places, but chiefly by Perthum now called Saint Iohns towne, and lastlye by Dunde, in time past called Alectum, and there breaketh into the Germaine sea, and at the mouth forceth great estuars or armes of the sea, whereof Tacitus maketh mention.
Againste Taus is Anguise, whiche by meanes of that riuer is fertile and prosperous, and is deuided from Fife.
To y^ same vpo~ the North adioyneth Athels, not the barre~nest Countrey, as well for water as for plentie of soyle.
On the other side Arguile sheweth it selfe, whyche being full of laakes, yéeldeth greater plentie of fodder than fruite, whose vttermost bounds stretch so farre, as Ireland is not distante past.
xvj. miles, about which the promontorie or foreland, called Lands hed standeth.
That coast whilom the Silures did inhabite, as Polidor gathereth by these wordes of Plinie in hys
Ireland being situate ouer against Brytain, is distant fro~ the nation of Silures by the shortest cut. xx. myles.
Howbeit, some other, for that it is manifest by the same Plinie in yt same Chapter, and also by other writers, that Brytaine was not in hys tyme well knowen so farre North, suppose he mente not by this, that the Silures shoulde inhabite Arguile, but rather from whence the passage ouer was better known (and as he mighte haue vnderstanding) shortest.
Wher also as wel Tacitus, as Antoninus séeme to place that people.
Betwéene Argile and Olgouia Westwarde lyeth the Countrey of Sterling, so called by a towne there.
Here the forest of Calydonia began on the left side, which within stretcheth farre and broade.
This forrest sometimes bred white Bulles, long maned like Lions, whiche were so wilde as they coulde not be tamed, but bycause the flesh was pleasant and daintie to the mouth, the whole race of them almoste is extinguished.
There likewise is the Castel of Calydone, situate by Taus called Doucheldine.
From a little hil of the forrest ryseth Glota, or Cluid, which by a brode chanel falleth into the Irishe Ocean: for stayed in a manner by the bankes of the mountaine Grampius, it slydeth into the sea by greate tydes, so (as witnesseth Tacitus the Romaines thought it to be another Ilande.
Of that riuer the Dale was called Glotevale, whyche Countrey that Riuer runneth by: and in the same is the Citie of Glasco, a goodlye Uniuersitie.
Agayne towardes the Easte is ioyned the Countrey as Anguish and Merne vppon the Sea coaste, wherein Fordune by situation is verye strong, and for the reliques of S. Palladius the Scottish Apostle famous.
Of the same syde of Scotlande, is the Countrey of Marre, garnished with a Citie called Aberdone, standing betwéene the two Riuers of Dona and Dea, with a Schole also adorned.
Then followeth Morrey, whiche the two notable Riuers doe compasse aboute, called Nessa and Spea.
At the mouthe of thys last Riuer, standeth the Towne of Elgis, aboute the banckes whereof be huge woods replenished wyth all sortes of wilde beastes.
There is a Laake also called Spina, stoared with plentie of Swannes: but in the middle part standeth the broad Countrey of Rossia now called Beane Rozen, stretching to the vttermost angle euen to both the Seas, and the further it goeth Eastwarde, the better it is inhabited.
In the same is a bosome of the Sea, nowe and then so conuenient for Sailers, as co~monly it is called the port of Health, (or the Hauen of Safetie) and the towne Thana.
The breadth of the Iland is very short, for falling into ye forme of a wedge, it is scant.
xxx. mile ouer, which defended with thrée promontories like towers, repelleth the greate waues and surges of the Sea: and inuironed with two gulfes, whiche those promontories doe inclose, the entries be quiet and calme, and the water peaceable.
The straite of that lande is at this day called Cathanes, coasting vpon the Sea Deucalidon.
But y^ same is in euery place ful of good Hauens and nauigable entryes, Laakes, with Marshes, flouds, fountaines, very full of fishe, and mountaines, vpon the tops wherof be pleasant plaines, yéelding great store of grasse, and plentie of fodder for Cattel, wooddes likewise full of wilde beastes.
That part of the land is well sustained with commodities, and therefore the people harde to be vanquished at anye time, by reason the woods and Marshes be at hande for refuge, and hunger eased wyth Ueneson and Fish.
About Scotlande in the Irishe Seas, are xl. Ilandes, of Plinie tearmed Brytanniae, other call them Meuania, other Hebrides.
Manye of these in length at leaste are thirty miles, but in breadth not aboue. xij. Amongest the~ is Iona beautified with the Tombes of the Scottish Kings.
The Ilanders generally speake Irishe, whiche declareth them to take their originall of the Irishe nation.
Beyonde Scotlande towarde the Northe, be the Iles of Orchades, whiche (as Ptolome saith) be. xxx. in number, some lying in the Ducalidon Sea, and some in the Germaine Ocean, the principall of whiche Ilandes is Pamonia, bycause it is a Byshops sea, and is vnder the gouernement of Scotlande.
The Ilanders vse the Gothes spéeche, whiche argueth them to procéede from the Germaines.
They be tall of stature, but verie helthie and lustie of body and minde, liuing very long, although their chiefest foode is fishe, for the lande almost continually beset with colde, in many places is not able to bear corne, and generally almost without trée or bushe.
Beyonde the Orchades standeth Thule, in the Frosen sea nowe called Iselande, to which our marchauntes repaire for fishing once euery yeare in the Sommer.
And thus much haue to say of the scite of Scotlande: nowe of the nature and maners of the people.
The Scottes whiche inhabite in the Southern parte, bée wel nurtured, and liue in good ciuility, the most ciuile, vse the English spéech.
And for that wood there is geason scant, their common fewel is of a blacke stone, whiche they dig out of the Earth.
The other part Northern, ful of mountaines, a very rude and homely kinde of people doth inhabite, which are called the redshankes or wilde Scottes.
They be clothed with a mantel and shyrte saffroned, after the Irishe manner, going bare legged to the knée.
Their weapons are bowes dartes, with a verie brode sword and a dagger, sharp only at the one side.
All speake Irish, féeding on fishe, milke, chéese, fleshe, hauing a great number of Cattell.
The Scottes differ from the Englishe in lawes and customes, bicause they vse the ciuill lawe as almost other Countryes doe.
In certain other conditions they be not farre vnlike, but their language is one, their habite complexion like, one corage in battel, and in the Nobilitie one desire and pregnancie in hunting.
The countrey houses be narrow, couered with straw réede, wherein the people and beasts do lodge togither.
Theyr towns besides S. Iohns towne are vnwalled, which is to be ascribed to their animositie hardinesse, fixing all their succor helpe alway in the valiancie of their body.
For to whatsoeuer Art they do apply themselues, they easily profite in the same.
But the ydle and such chiefly as shun and auoyde labour, liue in great pouertie, yet wil not sticke to boast of their nobilitie and gentrie, as though it were more séemely for the honest to lacke, than comely, (by exercise of some honest Arte,) to get their liuing.
Wales the third parte of Brytaine lyeth vppon the lefte hande, whiche like a Promontorie or foreland, or an Isle (as it were) on euery side is compassed with the maine Sea, except it be on ye Southeast part with the riuer of Sabrine, commonly called Seuern, which diuideth Wales from England, although some late writers affyrme Hereford to be a bound betwéene Wales and England, and say that Wales beginneth at Chepstow, where the riuer Wey (augmented with an other riuer called Lugge· passing by Hereforde, doth runne into the Sea, whiche riuer ryseth in the middle of Wales out of that hil (but vncertayne whether oute of that Spring that Sabrine doth,) for euen to that place there goeth a great arme of the Sea, which passing through the land westward, on the right hand leaueth Cornwal, and on the left Wales: whiche Topographie or description, althoughe it be newe, yet thought good to follow.
Therefore Wales is extended from the town of Chepstow, where it beginneth almost by a straight line a little aboue Shrowsburie, euen to Westchester Northward.
Into that part, so many of the Brytaines as remayned aliue after the slaughter and losse of their countrey, at the length being driuen to their shiftes, did repayre, as auntient writings report, where partly through refuge of the mountaines, and partly of the wooddes and marishes, they remained in safetie: which part they enioy euen to this day.
That land afterwards the English men did cal Wales: and the Brytaines the inhabitants of the same, Walshmen: for amongs the Germaines, Walshman, signifieth a stranger, an alien, an outborne or strange man, that is, suche a one, as hath a co~trarie la~guage from theirs, for Wal in their tongue is called a stranger borne, as an Italian or Frenchman, which differ in spéech from the Germaine.
Therefore Englishmen, a people of Germanie, after they had wonne Brytaine, called the Brytaines, whiche escaped after the destruction of theyr Country, after their Country maner, Walshmen, bicause they had an other tongue or speach besides theirs: and the la~d which they inhabited Wales, which name afterward both to the people and country did remaine.
By this meane the Brytaines with their kingdome loste their name.
But they which affirme that name to be deriued of their Kyng or Quéene, without doubt be deceyued.
The countrey soyle towardes the Sea coast, in other places in the valleys and playnes, is moste fertile, whiche yéeldeth bothe to man and beast great plenty of fruite and grasse: but in other places for the most part it is barraine lesse fruitful· bicause it lacketh tillage: for whych cause husbandmen doe liue hardly, eating Oten cakes, drinking Milke mixt with water.
There bée many towns strong Castels, foure Bishoprickes, if the Bishopricke of Hereford be counted in England, as the late wryters declare.
The firste Bishopricke is Meneue, so called of Meneua, which at this day they call Saint Dauids, a Citie very auntient, scituated vppon the Sea coast, and boundeth Westwarde towarde Irelande.
An other is Landaffe, the thirde Bangor, and the fourth Saint Asaph, which be vnder ye Archbishop of Canterbury.
The Welshme~ haue a language fro~ the Englishmen, which (as they say yt fetch their pedigrée fro~ ye Troians) doth partly sounde of the Troian antiquitie, and partly of the Gréeke.
But hewsoeuer it is, the Walshemen doe not pronounce their speache so pleasauntlye and gently as the Englishmen doe, bicause they speake more in the throate: and contrariwise, the Englishmen rightly following the Latines, do expresse their voice somewhat within the lips, whiche to the hearers séemeth pleasaunt and swéete.
And thus much of Wales, the thirde part of Brytaine.
Nowe followeth the fourth and last part of Brytaine named Cornwal.
This part beginneth on that side which standeth towarde Spaine Westward: Toward the Easte, it is of bredth foure score and ten miles, extending a little beyond S. Germains, which is a very famous village situate on ye right hand vppon the Sea coaste, where the greatest bredth of that Countrey is but. xx. miles: for this parcel of land on the right hande is compassed with the coast of the maine Sea: and on the left hand with that arme of the sea, which (as before is declared) parteth the land, and runneth vp to Chepstow, wher the Cou~try is in forme of a horne: For at ye first it is narrow, and then groweth broder a little beyonde the sayd town of S. Germain.
Eastward it bordreth vpo~ Engla~d: West, South, North, ye main sea is rou~d about it: it is a very barren soile, yéelding fruite more through trauel of ye tillers husba~dme~, than through the goodnesse of the ground: but there is greate plentie of Lead Tin, in the mining digging wherof doth specially consist the liuing and sustentation of the inhabita~ts.
Their tong is far dissonant from English, but it is much like to the Walsh tong, bicause they haue many words co~mon to both tongs: yet this difference there is betwéen them, when a Walsh man speaketh, the Cornish ma~ rather vnderstandeth manie words spoken by the Walshman, than the whole tale he telleth, whereby it is manifest, that those thrée people doe vnderstand one another, in like maner as ye Southern Scots doe perceiue and vnderstand the Northern.
But it is a thing very rare and maruellous, that in one Iland there should be such varietie of spéeches.
Cornwal is in the Diocesse of Exceter, whiche was once worthy to be counted the fourthe parte of the Iland, for the contrariety of the language.
Afterwards the Norma~s, which constituted a kingdome of al those thrée parts, reckened Cornwal to be one of the Counties or shires of the Countrey.
Thus much of the particular description of Brytaine, that the whole bodie of the Realme (by the members) maye be the better knowne to some peraduenture that neuer heard the same before.
The forme of the Ilande is Triquetra, or thrée cornered, hauing thrée corners, or thrée sides: two whereof, that is to saye, the corner toward the Easte, and the other toward the Weast (both extending Northwardes) are the longest.
The thirde side whiche is the South side, is farre shorter than the other: for the Ilande is greater of length than of bredth.
And as in the other two partes is conteyned the length, euen so in ye last, the bredth, in which place the bredth beginneth: and so continuing from the Southe parte to the North, it is but narrowe.
The first and right corner of which Iland Eastwarde, is in Kent, at Douer and Sandwich.
Fro~ whence to Callais or Boloigne in Fraunce, is the distance of xxx. myles.
From this Angle, which is against France, to the thirde Angle, which is in the Northe in Scotlande, the maine wherof boundeth vpon Germanie, but no land séene, (and there the Iland is like vnto a wedge euen at the verye Angle of the lande in Scotlande,) the lengthe is seauen hundred myles.
Againe, the length from this corner at Douer in Kent, to the vttermoste parte of Cornewall, being S. Michaels mount (whiche is the West parte or West Angle) is supposed to be thrée hundered myles.
From this lefte Angle being the West part and the vttermost part of Cornwal, which hath a prospect towardes Spaine, in which parte also standeth Irelande, scituate betwéene Britaine and Spaine to the North Angle in the further part of Scotland, in which parte the Iland doth end, the length is eight hundred miles, in whych part there be very good hauens, safe harboroughes for shippes, and apte passages into Ireland, being not paste one dayes sayling: but the shorter passage is from Wales to Waterforde, a towne in Irelande vpon the Sea coast, muche like to that passage betwéene Douer and Calays, or somewhat more: but the shortest passage of all, is out of Scotland.
From this last Angle to Hampton, which is a Towne vpon the Sea coast, with a hauen so called toward the South, and therfore called Southhampton, betwéene the angles of Kent and Cornwall, they doe measure by straight line the whole length of the Ilande, and doe saye, that it contayneth.

WHere it is recorded by the sacred and most auntient Historie, that after the vniuersal floud, the Isles of the Gentiles were diuided by the posteritie of Iapheth the sonne of Noah, wee doubt not but this Isle of Brytaine was also then peopled by his progenie, the Historie of whom, as it is to be wished and appertine~t to this purpose, so sith it is irrecouerable, not onely vnto vs, but also to other nations, thinke it better to say nothing therein, than to set downe here Samothes, Magus, Sarron, Druys, and Bardus for his successours, which are vpholden and boulstered onely by the credite and authoritie of a newe smal pamphlet falsely forged, and thruste into the worlde vnder the title of the auntient Historian Berosus.
For that is the censure of al the best learned, as concerning our co~mon Berosus, which at his first appering, about one hundred yers since, was partly suspect by Lodouicus Viues, afterwarde conuinced to be fabulous by the lerned Gas.
Varrerius, in a seueral treatise, and now vniuersally reiected of all skilful Antiquariesas, a mere fable vnworthy the name of Berosus.
Therefore dare not grounde the beginning of our Historie vppon the credite therof, vnlesse woulde be preiudicial to the trueth wherevnto leuel al my endeauour.
hope it shal bee sufficient in this Historie for the Brytaines time, to follow the authoritie of the receiued Brytish Historie, which Geffrey Archdeacon of Monmouth translated out of the Brytishe tong about.
yeares since, beginning with Brute, who after the progenie of Iapheth seemeth to be firste discouerer, namer, and Ruler of this land.
Yet before we enter into the History of Brute, it shal not bee impertinente to note here that where as Pomponius Mela me~tioneth that one Hercules killed Albion a Giant aboute the mouth of Rhosne in Fraunce, manye learned men haue iudged the saide Albion to haue ruled here, (sith the Greeke monume~ts do always cal this Isle ALBION, and after his deth that Hercules came hither, Lilius Giraldus writeth.

yeares since, as Solinus reporteth, plainelie proued that Vlisses the renoumed Graecian in his tenne yeares trauailes, after the sacking of Troy, arriued in this our Countrey.
And thus much is founde only in approued Histories as co~cerning Britaine before the arriuall of Brutus. (·.·) The race of the Kings of Britaine since Brute: and in the margent are placed the yeares beefore Christe his byrth, when euerye Kyng beganne their raignes, til Cunobelinus, in whose time Christ the Sauiour of the world was borne, and then followyng, the yeares from Chryste hys byrth are placed.
BRute the sonne of Siluius, the sonne of Ascanius, the sonne of Aeneas, after the death of hys father, being banished into Gréece, deliuered there the remna~t of the Troia~s from ye long captiuitie, wherin they were deteined vnder the Grecia~s, with whome he departed thence for to séeke some habitation: and associating to hymselfe Corineus wyth hys Troians whome he founde in the waye, after a long and weary iourney, and manye notable actes atchieued in Aquitaine, he arriued in this Ilande, whyche was called Albion, at a place nowe called Totnes in Deuonshire, the yeare of the world.
wherein he first began to raigne, and named it Brytaine, (as some write) or rather after his owne name Brutaine, as Aethicus that wonderfull Philosopher (a Scithian by race, but an Istrian by Countrey) translated by Saint Hierome aboue a thousand yeares past, termeth both it and the Iles adiacent Insulas Brutannicas.
And for more proofe of this restored name, not only the saide Philosopher (who trauelled through many landes, and in this lande taught the knowledge of mynerall workes) maye be alleadged, but sundry other, as the Sybils Oracles, who in the name of the Brytaines is written with y. that is the Gréekes little u. whyche Oracles althoughe they were not the Sibils owne worke, as some suspecte, yet are they very antient indéede, and that they might séeme more auntient, vse the moste auntient name of Countreys and peoples.
And some Englishe writers aboue an hundred yeares since, vsually doe name it Brutan, and not otherwise, through a large historie of thys lande, translated oute of Frenche.
Brute builded the Citie of newe Troy, now called London, he stablished therein ye Troian laws, gaue ye vttermoste Westerne parte of the Realme to his companion Corineus, of whose name it was called Corinea, and to thys day Cornwal.
Iohn Harding sayth, that Brute bare Gules two Lions rampant endorced Ore.
Also a Banner of a Uertdian of Golde fichule crowned and entronized, that were Aeneas armes when he entred the land of Latins.
Iohn Hanuil in Archinis, and Nicholas Vpton, saith he bare Ore a Lio passant Gules.
When hys death approched, he diuided the whole Ilande among his thrée sonnes, whiche he had by Innogen his wife, Locrine, Camber, and Albanact.
Unto Locrine he gaue the middle parte betwéene Humber and Seuern, whiche of him was called Loegria· To Camber he gaue all the region beyonde Seuern, which of him tooke the name of Cambria, and is now called Wales.
To Albanact he gaue all the lands beyond Humber, whyche of his name was called Albania: after whiche partition he deceassed, when he had raigned.
LOcrine, the eldest sonne of Brute raigned. xx. yeares: hée chased the Hunnes· whiche inuaded this realme: and pursued them so sharpely, that many of them with their Kyng were drowned in a riuer whiche then parted Englande and Scotland.
And forsomuch as the king of Hunnes, named Hu~ber, was there drowned, the riuer is til this daye named
This king Loctine had to wife· Guendoline· daughter of Corineus, Duke of Cornwall, by whome he had a son named Madan· He also kept as Paramour, the beautifull Lady Estrilde, by whom he had a daughter named Sabrine.
And after the death of Corineus, hée putte from hym the sayde Guendoline, and wedded Estrilde: but Guendoline repayred to Cornwall, where shée gathered a greate power, and foughte with King Locrine, and slewe hym.
She drowned the Lady Estrilde, with hir daughter Sabrine in a Ryuer, that after the young maydens name is called Seuerne.
GVendoline the daughter of Corineus and wife to Locrine (forsomuch as Madan hir son was too yong to gouerne ye lande) was by common assent of all the Brytaines, made ruler of the whole Isle of Brytaine, whiche she well and discretely ruled, to the comforte of hir subiectes. xv. yeares, and then left the same to hir sonne Madan.
MAdan, the sonne of Locrine and Guendoline· was made ruler of Brytain: he vsed great tiranny among his Britons: and being at his disport of hunting, he was deuoured by wild Wolues, when he had raigned. xl. yeres.
One olde pedigrée saith, he builded the city of Madan· now of the riuer Don called Doncaster.
MEmpricius, the son of Madan, being King, by treason slue his brother Manlius after whose death he lyued in more tranquilitie, he fell in slouth, so to lechery, taking ye wiues daughters of his subiects: lastly, became so euil, that he forsooke his wife and concubines, and fell to the sinne of Sodomie with beasts, whereby he became odible to God man.
And going on hu~ting, he lost his company, was destroyed of wilde Wolues, wherof the land was then ful, when he had raigned. xx. yeares.
EBranke, ye son of Mempricius, was made ruler of Brytaine, he had. wiues· of whom he receyued. xx. sons, and. xxx. daughters: whyche· were sente by their fathers to Alba Siluius, the fourth King of Albanois· in Italy· to be marryed to the Albanes.
This Ebranke firste after Brutus attempted to inuade Fraunce wyth an armye· Iacobus Bergomas sayeth in hys sixte of hys Chronicles, and Iacobus· Lessabeus in the description of Henault affyrmeth the same, and that he was driuen backe by Brunchildis Lord of Henault with no small losse of his men.
Assaracus the second sonne of Ebranke, with the rest of his yonger brethren
at the least, by the aide of Alba Siluius, co~quered all Germanie, which was then no great matter, for then Europe was very smally inhabited, saue only about the Sea coasts, as Dalmatia, Italie, and the coasts of France, as in reading the histories may easily be séene how the East people at sundry times came swarming into Europe.
Of these brethren had Germanie the name, Germanis fratribus, that had subdued it.
Ebranke was a founder of many Cities (sayth Bergomas as Alcluid in Albania (now Scotland) whiche is after Hector Boetius, Dunbretaine, but other thinke the same to be cleane destroyed.
He made also the Castel of Bamburgh: in the. xxiij. yeare of his raigne he builded Kayrbranke, nowe called since by the Saxons, Euorwike, nowe corruptely Yorke, wherein he builded a Temple to Diana, set there an Archflame, and was there buryed when he had raigned. lx. yeres.
Iohn Rouse sayeth he builded Caior Manour after it was called Bellositum, at length Caior Bossa, Rhydichen, and Oxenford, of a certaine Forde, which Iohn Leiland calleth Isis, in Englishe Ouse, and saith it is namely called Oxforde for Ouseforde.
the eldest son of Ebranke, succéeded in the kingdome, and for that his father had receyued suche a repulse at the hands of Brunchildis Lord of Henault, he, in reue~ge thereof inuaded Henault with a great army in the Fennes and Marshlande at the mouth of the Riuer Scaldis (of olde time named Stadus and encamped him selfe vppon the Riuer Hania, where betwéene Brutus and Brunchildis, was foughten a strong battaile in that place, which to this day is called, Estam bruges, of the station and campe of Brutus, as Iacobus Lessabeus writeth in hys description of Henaulte.
This Brute of his lustie courage was surnamed Gréeneshielde, he raigned. xij. yeares, and was buried at Yorke.
LEill the sonne of Brute Greeneshielde, béeyng a louer of peace, builded Carleile and repaired Carleon, whych was since by the Romaines reedified, when a legion of Souldiors was sent thither, and by them named The City of Legions, nowe called Chester, of the auntient buyldyng wyth vaultes and towers, eche house like a Castell, whych sometyme hadde béene of greate pleasaunce.

and was named Cohors miliaria, that is to saye, a companye of a thousand and moe souldiours.
This band is the head of all the legion: whensoeuer they muste fight, these beginne the battaile, are first set in order in the front of the battell.

These ten bands make a ful and perfect legion, contayning.
King Leill in the ende of his· raigne fel to slouth and lust of the body, by mean wherof ciuill strife was raysed, and not in hys dayes ended.
He raigned. xxv. yeares, and was buried at Carleile alias Chester.
RVdhudibras, alias Cicuber, the sonne of Leil, builded Caergant, of the Englishemenne called Canterbury, (that is to saye, the Courte of the Kentishemen Caierguent, nowe Winchester, and Caersepton nowe called Shaftisburie, wherein hée builded thrée Temples, and placed in the same Flamines.
BLadud the sonne of Rudhudibras, who had long studied at Athens, broughte with him foure Philosophers, to kéepe Schoole in Brytaine: for the whiche he builded Stamforde, and made it an Uniuersitie, wherein hée had greate number of Scholers studying in all the seauen liberall Sciences: whiche Uniuersitie dured to the comming of Saint Augustine.
At whiche time the Bishoppe of Rome interdited it for heresies that fel among the Saxons and Brytons togither mixt, so sayth Harding.
He builded Caier Badon or Bathe, and made there a Temple to Apollo, and placed there a Flamine: he made also the hote Bathes, and practised hys Necromancie: he decked himselfe in feathers, and presumed to flie, but by falling on his Temple, he brake his necke, when he had raigned. xx. yeres.
He builded Caier Lair vpon the Riuer Sore, now called Leycéster, and made there a Temple of Ianus, placing a Flamine to gouerne the same.
He had thrée daughters, Gonorel, Ragan, Cordeile, whyche Cordeile for hir vertue and wisedome towardes hir father, succeded him in the kingdome.
When he had raigned xl. yeares he deceassed, and was buryed vnder the channell of the Riuer Sore, wythin Leicester.
Thys vault vnder the earth was builte in honour of Ianus Bifrons.
There all the Workemen of that Citie, when the solemnitie of the daye came, begun al things that they had to do the yere folowing.
COrdila, ye yongest daughter of Leire, succéeding hir father, was sore vexed by hir two nephues, Morgan of Albanie, Conedagius of Camber and Cornwal who at the length toke cast hir in prison: where she being in dispayre of recouering hir estate, slewe hir selfe, when she had raigned. v. yeres, and was buryed at Leicester in Ianus Temple, by hir father.
MOrgan, the eldest sonne of Dame Gonorell, claymed Brytaine, and warred on hys nephewe Conedagius, that was King of Camber (that nowe is Wales) and of Cornwall: but Conedagius mette with Morgan in Wales, and there slewe hym: whyche place is called Glamorgan till this daye.
He builded a Temple of Mars at Perche, that now is Saint Johns Towne in Scotlande, and placed there a Flamine: He builded another of Minerua in Wales, whyche now is named Bangor.
The thirde he made of Mercurie in Cornwall, where he was borne.
He raigned. xxxiij. yeares, and was buryed at newe Troy.
RIuallo, sonne of Conedagius, succéeded his father, in whose tyme it rained bloude thrée dayes: after whyche tempest ensued a greate multitude of venemous Flies, whych slewe muche people: and then a greate mortalitie throughout this land, which caused almost desolation of the same.
This Riuallo raigned ouer this whole Iland. xlvj. yeares, and then deceassed, and was buryed at Caierbranke, that nowe is Yorke.
GVigustus, sonne of Riuallo succéeded in the Kingdome of Brytaine who raigned quietly, but was a common drunkard, wherof followed all other vices.
When hée had raigned. xxxviij. yeares, hée deceassed, and was buried at Yorke.

IAgo or Lago, Cousin of Curgustus, raigned. xxv. yeares: for his euil gouernement he dyed of a Litargie, and was buryed at Yorke.
Iohn de Vigney, in his Booke named The Moralization of the Chesse, sayeth, that the same game of the Chesse, was deuised by Xerxes the Philosopher, otherwise named Philometre, to reproue and correcte the cruell minde of a filmous Tyrant called Elmerodach Kyng of Babilon (as is supposed) about the yeare before Chrystes byrth.
GOrbodug raigned thrée score and thrée yeares, and was buryed at newe Troy.
FErrex with his brother Porrex, ruled Brytaine fiue yeres: but it was not long ere they fell at ciuill discorde for the soueraigne dominion, in whyche Ferrex was slaine, and Porrex afterwardes by hys mother, whose name was Idoine, was killed in his bed.
Thus cruelly was the bloude and house of Brute destroyed, when this realme by the space of
After this the realme was diuided with ciuil warres, for lacke of one soueraigne gouernor, vntil Dunwallo reduced the same into one Monarchie.
MVlmutius Dunwallo, the son of Cloten, Duke of Cornwall, reduced this Realme into one Monarchie, being before by ciuil warres and dissention seuered and broughte into diuers dominions: he was the firste that ware a crown of golde: he constituted good lawes, whyche long after were called Mulmutius Lawes.
These lawes holy Gildas wrote oute of the British spéech into Latine.
He gaue priniledges vnto Temples, and ploughes, and beganne to make the foure notable wayes in Brytaine.
In newe Troy he builded a greate Temple called Templum Pacis, which some suppose to be Saint Paules, some Blackwell Hall, and wythoute doubte, the olde worke of Blackwel Hall now remayning, was the Jewes Synagogue.
He raigned. xl. yeares, leauing after him two sonnes, Belinus and Brennus.
He was buryed in the Temple of Peace whiche he had builded.
BElinus and Brennus, sons of Mulmutius and Cornouenna, diuided this whole Isle of Brytaine betwene them.
Unto Beline the elder brother was appointed Englande, Wales, and Cornwall.
This Brennus, a yong man, desirous of glory and dominion, raysed warre againste Beline.
But in conclusion, by ye means of their mother, they were accorded, and Brennus being wholly giue~ to ye study of wars, left hys cou~try to yt gouerna~ce of his brother, we~t into Fra~ce amo~gest ye Galles, where for his excelle~t qualities he was greatly estéemed, made of them theyr soueraigne Captaine, with who~ he passed into Italie, sacked Rome, and expelling the Tuscanes, builded Millain, Brescia, Como, Bergamo, Vincenza, Trent, Verona, whiche he called after his owne name Brenona.
After this (as writeth Trogus Pompeius, abridged by Iustine, hée raised an hoste of
When Sosthenes sawe how they wasted the Countrey and villages, he mette them with hys host of Macedones well appointed.
But by reason they were fewe, and their enemies manye, they were soone put to the worser.
Wherefore while the Macedones being beaten, kept them within the walles of their Cities, Brennus like a conquerour, against whom no man durst shew his head to make resistaunce, foraged al the Iles of Macedone.
And from thence as though those booties and spoyles séemed too base and simple in his eye, he tourned his minde to the Temples of the Goddes immortall, malapertlye scoffing that the goddes were riche, and ought to departe liberally to men.
Therfore he toke his iourney towards Delphos, setting more by ye gain of the gold that had ben offered to the Goddes, than by theyr displeasure.
The Temple of Apollo at Delphos, is situate in ye mount Parnassus, vppon a cliffe on euerye side falling stéepe downe.
There the confluence of men hath made a populous Cittie.
Moreouer both the Temple and the towne are enclosed with the stéepenesse of the rocke.
The middle part of the rocke inwarde is in fashion like a Theatre, by meanes whereof when men make any shouting, or any Trumpet is sounded, the same breaketh redoundeth in such wise vpon the stones from one to another, that the Echo is herd double and treble, the noyce resounding farre lowder than it wente forth.
The whyche causeth the ignoraunt to stande in more feare, thinking it to be the presence of the Godheade.
In the winding of the rocke, almost to the toppe of the Hil, there is a little playne, and in the same a déepe hole into the ground, which serueth to giue Oracles: Out of the which a certaine colde breath ascending vpwarde, stirreth the mindes of the Prophetes into a madnesse, and so compelleth them to giue aunsweare to such as come for counsayle.
In the same place therefore, there are to be séene many and riche gifts of kyngs and peoples.
Wherefore when Brutus came within the view of the Temple, he was in doubt a greate whyle, whether hée wer better to attempt the matter forthwith, or giue his souldiours that nights respite to rest them.
Euridanus and Thessalonus, who for conetousnesse of the praye, hadde ioyned themselues with him, willed to cut off al delay, while theyr enimies were vnprouided, where as by giuing them that nights respite, theyr enimies should perchance get both courage and succour: but the common souldiours of the Frenchmen, when after long penurie, they founde a Countrey replenished with wine, and all other kind of victuals, they dispersed themselues in the fields, making hauock of al things like conguerours, by which meanes the Delphians had respit to lay for themselues, and manned the towne by the helpe of theyr neyghbours, or euer the Frenchmen coulde be called from the wyne Fat to their standarde.
Brennus had thréescore and fiue thousand chosen footemen of the best in al his hoste, where as the Delphians were in al but.
In disdayne of whiche small handful, Brennus to the entente to sharpen the mindes of his men, shewed them all, what a riche and plentiful pray they shoulde haue.
The Frenchmen being by this vouching of their Captaine, or rather by theyr owne beholding, stirred vp, and also wounded with the wine they had poured in the day before, without respite of any da~ger ran to the encounter.
On the contrarie part, the Delphians putting more truste in God than in their owne strength, resisted theyr enemyes, and what with stones, and what with their weapons, threw the Frenchmen (as they scaled,) headlong from the top of the mountain.
While the two partes were thus striuing one with another, sodainely the Priestes of al the Temples, and the Prophetes, wyth theyr haire aboute their eares, &c. like men straught out of their wittes, came running into the forefront of the battaile, crying out, that while they were al making their supplications to God for ayde, they met a yong ma~ of beautie and personage, far excelling any mortal creature, and in his companie two Uirgins in armour, wherefore they besought them, séeing the Gods did garde their standarde, they shoulde not sticke to dispatch their enimies.
And there with all they forthwith perceyued that God was present on their side.
For both a piece of the mountaine being broken off, by a sodaine earthquake, ouerwhelmed the French hoste, and the thickest of theyr enimies (not without gret slaughter,) were opened and put to flight.
In the necke whereof there ensued a tempeste, with hayle, thunder, and lightning, consuming as manye as were anye thing sore wounded.
The Captaine Brennus himselfe not being able to abyde the smarte of his woundes, toke sworde and killed himselfe.
Beline in the meane time bothe in ciuill iustice and also Religion, greatly encreased his Realm.
He made thrée Archflamines, whose Seas were at new Troy, Kayrbranke, Kayrlegion.
He finished the foure greate wayes begon by his Father: he subdued and made tributarie vnto him Denmarke.
In newe Troy he made the Hauen, whiche at this day retayneth the name of hym, called Belines Gate: And as Iohn Lelande wryteth, he builded the Towre of newe Troy.
He maryed hys daughter Cambria, vnto a Prince of Almaine called Antenor, of whome these people were called Cymbri, and Sycambri.
Finally, after he had raigned with his brother and alone xxvj. yeares, he dyed: and after the Pagan manner, with great pompe was burned, and his ashes in a vessell of brasse set on a hygh Pynacle ouer Belines Gate.
He builded Carlheon vppon the Riuer Vske, which since by a legion of the Romanes there placed, was named Caerlegion, now cleane destroyed.
I. Rouse saith he builded Caier Werithe, that is Longcastra: He subdued Denmarke, compelling them to continue their tribute, and in his returne home, mette with a fléete of Basdenses comming from the parts of Spaine, which were séeking for habitations, bycause their Countrey was so populous, and not able to sustaine them, to whom the king graunted the Isle of Ireland to inhabite, and to holde the same of him as their soueraigne Lord: But the Scottes write, that Spaniards arriued before this time in Irelande.
This Gurgunstus builded Porchester and Warwicke in the middle of the Realme, (sayth I. Rouse.
prince sober and quiet, who had to wyfe a noble woman named Mercia, of excellent learning and knowledge.
She deuised certaine lawes, whych long time among the Brytaines were greatlye estéemed, and named Marcian Lawes.
This prince raigned. xxvj. yeares, and was buryed at new Troy.
CEcilius the sonne of Guinthelin and Marcia, raigned. vij. yeares (as the Scottes write.)
In the first yeare of hys raigne, a people called Picts, arriued here in Brytaine, and possessed those partes, whiche now be the Marches of bothe Realmes Englande and Scotlande.
KImarus succeded Cecilius, who being a wilde yong man, liuing after his owne luste, raigned but thrée yeares, and was slaine as he was hunting of wilde beastes.
ELanius, called also Danius, was king of Brytaine nine yeares.
MOrindus, the bastarde sonne of Danius, beganne to raign in Brytaine: he foughte with a king who came out of Germanie, and slewe him wyth all his power.
Moreouer, out of the Irishe Seas in hys time came forthe a wonderfull monster, whyche destroyed muche people: Whereof the king hearing, woulde of his valiaunt courage, néeds fight with it, by whom he was clean deuoured when he had raigned eight yeares.
GOrbomannus, eldest sonne of Morindus, raigned eleauen yeres: a Prince iuste and religious: he renued the Temples of his Gods, and gouerned his people in peace welth.
Our Englishe Chronicle saith, he builded bothe the townes of Cambridge and Grantham: but séeing that Cambridge in auntient Chronicles is called Grant (as it is also Grantchester, Cairgrant, and Grantbridge) it was an easie matter (as Grammarians knowe) to translate Grantham into Cambridge, and so ascribe the building of bothe Townes to him that builded but one of them.
ARchigallo, brother to Gorbomannus, was crowned kyng of Britaine: he was in conditions vnlike to his brother: for he deposed the noblemen, and exalted the vnnoble.
He extorted from men their goods to enriche his treasurie: for which cause by the estates of the Realme he was depriued of his royall dignitie, when he had raigned fiue yeares.
ELidurus, the thirde sonne of Morindus, and brother to Archigallo, was elected King of Brytaine: a vertuous gentle Prince, who gouerned his people iustly.
As he was hunting in a forrest, by chaunce he met with his brother Archigallo, whome moste louingly he embraced, and found the meanes to reconcile him to his Lordes, and then resigned to hym hys royall dignitie, when he hadde raygned fiue yeares.
ARchigallo, thus restored to his royall estate, ruled the people quietly and iustly tenne yeares, and lyeth buryed at Yorke.
ELidurus aforenamed, after the death of his brother Archigallo, for his pietie and Justice, by the generall consent of the Brytaines was again chosen King.
But he raigned not passing two yeares, but that his yonger brethren, Vigenius and Peredurus raysed warre againste him, tooke him prisoner, and caste him into the Tower of newe Troy, where he remayned during their raigne.
VIgenius and Peredurus, after the taking of their brother, reigned togither seuen yeares.
Vigenius then dyed, and Peredurus raigned after alone two yeres.
He builded ye town of Pickering in the North parts of Yorkeshire.
ELidurus, the thirde time was made king, who continued his latter raigne honourablie and iustlye: but being sore brused with age and troubles, he finished his life, when hée had nowe lastlye raigned foure yeares, and was buried at Carlile.

Finally, he dyed, leauing after hym two sonnes Androgius and Theomantius: who not being of the age gouerned, their vncle Cassibelan obtayned the Crown.
London toke the name of Lud, and was called Ludston: He was buried nere to the same Ludgate, in a Temple which he there ilded.
CAssibelanus, the sonne of Hely, after the deathe of his brother Lud, was made gouernour of Brytaine, which ruled xix. yeares.
In the. viij. yeare of his raigne, Iulius Caesar coing vnto that parte where Caleys and Boloigue now stand, determined to make warre into Brytaine, which vntil that time remained vnfrequented and vnknown of the Romains.
His quarrell was, bicause ye in the wars of Fra~ce, he perceyued the Frenchmen to haue much succour and ayde from thence: And bycause he could not vnderstand nor learn the greatnesse or state of the Ila~d, neither what nations they were whiche inhabited the same, nor what lawes, customes, or kinde of gouernemente they vsed, nor yet what Hauens they had, able to receyue any number of ships, he sent Caius Volusenus before with a Galley, to discouer as muche as hée coulde, concerning those matters, who within fiue dayes after retourned to Caesar, declaring such things as he had learned by coasting alongst the shore, for he durste not for feare of the Brytaines stirre out of his Galley.
In the meane space there came Embassadours from many Cities of the Isle, and deliuered him Hostages, with whom he sent Comius of Arras, charging him to exhort and perswade the reste of the Cities and Countyes to do the like.
lxxx. ships, sayled into Brytaine, where at the first being wearied with an harde and sharpe battayle, and after with sodaine tempest his nauie almost destroyed: he retourned againe into Fraunce, there to winter his men.
his Nauye being newe rigged and encreased, he passed the Seas againe with a greater armye, but whiles hée went towards his imies on land, his ships lying at Anker, were driuen on the sands, where they stacke fast: or else throughe beating one against another, with force of the tempest, they were destroyed, so that. xl. were lost, the other with muche labour were saued.
In the meane space Saeua one of Caesars soldiours, with foure others, who before in a small vessel were conueyed to a rocke neare the Isle, and by ebbing of the Ocea~ being for saken, a greate number of Brytaines fell on a fewe Romaines, and some of his companions (though but fewe) found meanes to returne by boate, but Saeua remained with out fear in ye midst of his enimies first with his speare he rested them, after with his sword he alone foughte against many of them, and when he was both wearie wou~ded, and had lost his helmet and shielde, with two light harnesses, he ranne to Caesars tents, and asked pardo~ of the Emperor for his ouerboldnesse, who not onely forgaue him, but honored him with the Office of a Centurion.
Upon land Caesars horssemen at the first encounter were vanquished, Laberius Durus the Tribune slaine in a place now called Chesto~ wood neare vnto Rochester, (as saith the Chronicle of Wygmore.
At the second conflict, not wtout great daunger of his men, he put the Brytaines to fight, from thence he went vnto the riuer Thamis, on ye further side wherof Cassibelanus with a great multitude of people was kéeping the banks, who had set all the sayde bankes, and al the shallow places, vnder the water with sharpe stakes, euery one of them as big as a ma~s thighe, bounde aboute with leade, and driuen so fast into the bottom of the riuer, that they can neuer be remoued, (so saith Bede, and Asser, who affirme that in their times the sayde stakes were easilye perceiued to remaine as aforesayd.
But Cassibelanus and his Brytains not being able to resist the violence and force of the Romaines, hid themselues in woods, with sodaine eruptions oftentimes inuaded them: but in the meane time London their strongest Citie submitted it selfe, deliuered hostages to Caesar, who at their request placed Ma~dubratius to be their gouernour, whose Father called Imanentius, being chiefe Lord or ruler of the Trinobants, Cassibelane had before slaine, wherewith Mandubratius fled, and comming to Caesar, not only submitted hymself, but also was a great meanes (as many doe write) for Caesar to subdue the rest: yet did Cassibelane sende messengers to the foure Kings that ruled in the quarters of Kente, that with al theyr puissance they shold set on the Romaines that lay next the~: their names wer Cingetorex, Caruilius, Taximagulus, Segonax, who obeying his requeste were discomfited, and Cingetorex taken, wherewithal Cassibelane being dismayed after many losses, was constrayned to giue pledges, and to agrée that Brytaine shoulde become tributarie to Romaines.
Then Caesar like a conquerour, with a great number of prisoners sayled into Fraunce and so to Rome, where after his retourne out of Brytaine, he consecrated to Venus a surcotte of Brytayne Pearles, the desire wherof partly moued him to inuade this Countrey: shortlye after he was by the Senate slaine in the Counsel house.
Iohn Lydgate, Iohn Rouse and others write, that Iulius Caesar builded in this lande the Castels of Douer, of Canturburie, Rochester and the Towre of London, the Castell and towne of Caesars Burie, taking his name after Caesar, the which is now called Salisburie.
He also edifyed Caesars Chester, that now is called Chichester, and the castel of Excester. &c Caesar in his Commentaries fayth, the Brytons coyne was of brasse, or else rings of Iron sized at a certaine waight, in steade of money: they thoughte it a heynous thing to taste a Hare, a Hen, or a Goose: they clothed themselues in Lether: they dyed the~selues with woade, which setting a blewish colour vpon them, made them more terrible to beholde in battel: they ware theyr haire long, and shaued all partes of their bodyes, sauing the head and vpper lippe: they had tenne or twelue wiues a piece, common with themselues, speciallye brothers with brothers, and parentes wyth theyr children, but the issue that came of them was accounted his that firste maried the mother.
Theomantius, the sonne of Lud, and nephew to Cassibelan, succeded in the Realme of Brytaine, and raigned quietlye xxiij. yeares: he was buryed at London.
OCtauius Augustus desiring to be like Iulius Caesar hys Father (for so he alwayes tearmed him) prepared an expedition in Brytaine, but being come forwarde into Fraunce, vnderstanding that the Panonians lately subdued, rebelled, he tourned his power againste them, and altered his minde as touching our Countrey.
THe fourthe yere after, he opened the Temple of Ianus at Rome, fully determining to inuade Brytaine, but when he had marched on his way, as far as Ariminum Ambassadors of Brytaine met him, humbly suing for peace, submitting themselues vnto his obedience and protection.
Wherfore he stayed again to settle some troubles then raised in Fraunce.
THe yeare following, bycause the couena~ts betwéen hym and the Brytains could not be agréed vpon, he made prouision for a thirde expedition into thys Ile, but an actual rebellion in Biscay and Sauoy him then also.
But shortly after Ambassadours came from Brytaine to Rome intreating for peace, swearing filthily in the Temple of Mars, offering giftes in the Capitoll to the Gods of the Romaines: and submitted part of the Ile vnto Angustus.
Now the Brytaines beganne first to pay tolles and tribute without grudging, for all wares which they traded, whiche were for that time, Iuorie boxes, tonges, ouches, other trinckets of amber and glasse.
And all here were so quiet, that one bande of souldiours and a fewe horsemen were sufficiente to kepe the Ile in the Romaine possession.
CVnobelinus the sonne of Theomantius raigned king in Brytaine. xxxv. yeares, and was buried at London.
In the xiiij. yeare of hys raigne Christe our sauioure was borne in Bethlehem of Iuda.
From this place following, the yeares from Christ his byrth are placed in the Margent.
WHen Caesar Augustus the seconde Emperoure, by the will of GOD hadde stablished moste sure peace throughe the Worlde, our redéemer Iesu Christe, verye God and man, was borne in the. xlij. yeare of the raigne of Augustus, he began to preache the. xv. yeare of Tiberius, and suffered his passion the. xviij. yeare of the same Tiberius, according to the Prophecies.
But here is to be noted, that the first yere of our Lord hath but seuen days, after some computation, for he was borne the. xxv. day of December, the first of Januarie following, began the second yeare.
This man was valiaunte, hardie, wealthie, and trusted muche in his strength.
And for that he thought the Romains had their tribute wrongfullye, he of great courage denyed to pay the same.
Wherefore Tiberius the Emperour purposed to come hither in person, but death preuented him.
Aruiragus, or rather (as the Brytaynes tearme him) Monrigus, the yongest sonne of Cunobelinus, and brother of Guiderius was ordayned King of Brytaine: he slew Hamon neare to a haue~ of the sea, threw him gobbet meale therin, it is now called
He stre~gthned the Castell of Douer, and also the Castle of Richbourgh, neare vnto Sandwich in Kent.
ALbeit the Brytaine Historie doth here place Aruiragus, yet it is probable yt Cunobelinus as yet liued, for about, yeares after Christ: Admimus the sonne of Cunobeline banished out of Brytaine by his Father, was receiued into protection by Caius Caligula the fourth Emperor, who was the~ set forwarde with greate preparation againste Brytaine, but when he came into the partes of Holland against Norffolke hée stayed, writing vaunting letters to ye Senate, that al Brytain was yéelded vnto him, bycause Admimus had so done.
Afterwarde as though he would immediately fight a fielde, he cast his men into battayles, and squadrons vppon the sea coaste, disposing all hys Engines in most warlike manner (no man knowing what he ment): this done he hymselfe in a Gallye launched into the sea, and immediately returning, he caused the Trumpets to sound to battayle, sodainly commaunded them to gather cockles and muscle shelles, and therewith to fill theyr helmets, saying they were spoyles due to the Capitoll, and in these spoyles he greatlie triumphed, as thoughe he had subdued the Ocean.
He rewarded his souldiours, and retourned to Rome, after he had built a hygh watche Towre in token of his victorie against the sea, the ruines wherof are great remaining in Holland, but ouerflowed by the water, and is to thys daye called the Brytons house, in remembrance of this ridiculous expedition against Brytaine, by the persuasion of Bericus banished out of Brytaine.
CLaudius the Emperoure dispatched Aulus Plantius wyth an army into Brytaine, wher after dinerse conflicts whe~ he had receyued part of the Bodunni into hys tuition· and hadde slaine Cataracus and Togodumus sonnes of Cunobeline, therby had made the Brytains more eagre to reue~ge, he sent for Claudius himselfe, who with great preparation and Elephants, came into Brytanne to his army, then encamped nere the Thames, with which he passed ouer into Essex, fought with the Brytanies, obtained the victorie, tooke the chiefe Cittye of Cunobeline, and all weapons from the Brytaynes, and so retourned to Rome the sirthe month after he sette forth from thence, where hée triumphed, surnaming hys sonne Brytanicus: to whiche triumphe he permitted not onely the presidents of prouinces, but also certayn banished prisoners to repayre to Rome: and amidst the spoyles taken from the Brytains, he fixed on the top of hys Pallace a crown of gold beset with stemmes and foreparts of shippes, in token he had vanquished the Brytish Ocean.
He behaued himselfe verye courteously towards diuerse of his friendes, in so muche that when Plantius (a notable man) who in his voyage whych he made into Brytaine atchieued diuers notable actes, and shold triumph for the same, the Emperour himselfe accompanied him, and (the vse being suche that with his triumph he shold go vp into the Capitoll Claudius gaue him the preheminence· and went on the left hand.
At this time Vespatian who was after Emperor, was sent by Claudius into Brytain, wher he fought times with the Brytaines, subdued to the Romane Empire two worthy nations, aboue
OStorius was appointed lieuetenaunt in Brytaine for the Romans who at his first entry in the beginning of Winter assayleth the Brytaines, purposeth to pen them vp and include the~ with riuers fortificatio~s, wherfore ye Ioeni made an insurrectio~, which whe~ he had pacified wt some slaughter, he marched against ye Gangi, for raging al the Cuntries as he passed, but was forced by new tumults to tourne from them against ye Brigants, who~ with some slaughter, promise of pardon, he pacified.
The~ he made prouisio~ against ye Silures which inhabited bearing the~selues bold vpon ye puissa~ce of Caratacus a valiant Brytain, who being skilful of y^
Countrey, remoued ye war into Shropshire, wher he fortified amo~gst craggie mountaynes a place strong by situation, where neuerthelesse the Romanes preuayled.
The wise daughter, and brethren of Caratacus were taken, and he flying to Cartisma~dua a q. ruling in Yorkshire, was by hir deliuered captiue to his enemies.
ix. yeares after the warres began, who sending him to Rome, was ther in open assembly brought before Claudius, with his wife, daughter, brethren, and friendes, and such spoyles as had bin taken fro~ him, wher he (nothing dismayed in spirit or countenance,) spake after this sort to Claudius: If my moderation of prosperous successes had bin corresponde~t to my state and nobilitie, might haue come to this Citie, rather a friende than a Captaine: neyther you haue disdayned to admit me into league, being descended of noble parentage, and soueraigne ouer many nations.
This present state of mine, as it is villanous toward me, so it is honorable to you.
had horsse, men, money, munition, what wonder is there, if had lost them vnwillingly? For if you will rule and raigne ouer all, of necessitie all must come into slauerie: if had yéelded at the first, neyther my fortune nor thy glorie had bin renoumed, the obliuion of me had ensued immediately after my execution: but if you saue my life, it shall be an euerlasting example of your clemency.
At these words Claudius remitted his offence, graunted him life, the Senate adiudged Ostorius worthy to triumph: but in the mean time the inhabitaunts of to reuenge Caratacus captiuitie intercepted discomfited certain bands of ye Romans, amidst which new wars, Ostorius tired we trauel, departed this life.
CLaudius sent Didius to supply the place of Ostorius nowe departed, but in the mean time ye Silures fought fortunatly against the legions which was vnder the conduct of Manlius Valens.
In this time war brake out betwéene Cartismanda Q· of the Brigants, Venutius hir husband, whom she refused, matched hir self with Vellocatus his Esquire: wherevpon Venutius fauored of the people, assayled hir territory, and she succoured by ye Romains, after she had intercepted by trechery Venutius brother allies, fought with him.
Wher after a sharp fight, she by the ayde of ye Romaines, preuayled, as also Caesius Nasica did wt his legion against the Brytans in an other place: for Didius vsed others in these matters, bicause he was aged, onely kept y^ which others had heretofore conquered.
CLaudius being now poysned by Agrippina his wife, Nero hir son obteyned ye Romain· Empire· about the.
yeare of his raigne Verennus was appointed lieutenant here, who died within ye first yere of his gouernme~t, saying y^ he would haue subdued prouinces, had he suruiued but. ij. yeares, but about this time great slaughter was here of the Romaines.
SVetonius Paulinus was the~ sent hither, who at his arriual purposing to subdue Anglesey, whither many Brytains had we drawne the~selues, he invessels wt flat kéeles ferried ouer his footme~, bringing ouer his horseme~ by some fourdes, wher as on ye shores stood closely togither great nu~bers of Bryta~s, among the~ women gadding vp down frantickly in mourning wéedes, their haire hanging about their ears, shaking firebra~ds: ye Druydes also casting vp their ha~ds toward heaue~ thundred out cruel execrations, wt which vncomely sightes ye Romaines at first stoode dismayed, but after encouraged by y^
Generals perswasion· they brust in among the~, made greate slaughter, got ye possession of ye Ile, felled down ye woods· co~secrated to supersticious vses: two Citties belo~ging to y^
of their people slaine, the whole Ila~d reuolted, to the Romanes reproch, the slaughter was co~mitted by a woma~, being foretold the~ by many strange signes toke~s.
For in y^ court was heard a noise wt much slaughter.
In the Theatre a greate tumulte and muche wondering, when there was no man ther, that either spake or mourned.
Besides, in the riuer of Thames certaine houses or buildings were séen.
The Image of the goddesse Victoria in the Temple of Camulodunum tourned hir backe as though she had yéelded to hyr enimies: the women ranne as madde here and there, saying, and singing, Destruction is at hande.
Finally, betwixt the Iland Fraunce, the Ocean sea appeared as it flowed with bloud.
The occasio~ of this war was a co~fiscation of the Brytains goods, which being remitted by Claudius the Emperoure, Decianus Catus then Procurator of the Ile, saide that it ought to haue bene renued.
To this cause was added, that wheras (against theyr wils Seneca had lent them fourtie Sestercies vpon great vsurie) he now wyth greate force and all kinde of violence compelled them to paye all the whole summe at one payment, and also persuaded them to make warre on the Romaines.
Bunduica of Brytaine, a woman of noble byrth, not onely wyth muche honour ruled amongst them, but also was the soueraigne in theyr wars, had in déed a stomack more ma~ly than womanlike: who hauing gotten togyther an armye of
men, gotte hir vpon hyr seate made of Marrishe turues, after the manner of the Romaines, and being a tall woman, of comely shape, and seuere countena~ce, sharp voice, with yealowe haire hanging downe to hyr skyrtes, Ponticus Virunius saith to hir thyghes) she ware a great chayne of golde, and hadde on hyr backe a coate of sundrye colours, a playted Kirtle.
Whe~ she was thus apparelled, and had in hir hands a gret speare, she spake vnto them to this effect.
First she commended libertie, shewing them, how pouertie wyth libertie, was farre better than great riches in miserie and bondage: on the other side, wyth great eloquence shée declared the mischiefes and calamities they suffered at the handes of the Romaines, who exactyng Tributes of paymentes, so oppressed them, that muche better it were once to dye, than long to lyue in suche extreame slauerie.
Secondly, she reproued them, for not expelling their enimies, as their forefathers had done Iulius Caesar, Claudius, and Caligula: And againe, she praised them for their present readinesse to helpe hir, and recouer their auntient state.
Thirdly, she disabled the Romaines, for that they were fewe, combred with armoure, and so faint of courage, that they had rather fight a far off, than encounter with them by hand strokes: she co~mended the Brytaines, to be more in nu~ber, of greater valor, and farre more able to abide hunger, colde, thirste, raine, winde, heate, &c. shée added the vantage of the place, as being at home, where the Wooddes and Ryuers, Lakes, and all other things were well knowne to euery one of them.
Lastly, she exhorted them to shewe themselues as Dogs and Wolues among fearefull Hares and Foxes: wherewithall, she let out of hir lap a quicke Hare, thereby to learn the euent of hir enterprice.
The Hare hauing a prosperous passage, all the multitude gaue a greate showte, and Bunduica clapping hir handes, gaue thankes to hir Gods, that she ruled not the Romaines, as did Nero, (who, though hée were a man, yet was in déede but a woman, for that he sang and playde on the Harpe) but the Brytans, who estéemed it better to be Warriours than Ploughmen, who, as they had all things in common, so had they both wiues and children, and that hauing a kingdome amongest suche a kinde of people, she prayed their deuine aydes agaynste a spitefull and wicked kinde of men, if they were to be called men, who vsed hote bathes, dainty fare, wine, ointmentes, laye in softe beds, and were vassalles to such a wanton Minstrel as their Emperor Nero was.
Bunduica hauing spoken these and suche like amongst hir people, with all hir hoste she sette forward agaynste the Romains, who at that time were without head or gouernor, for that Paulinus was gone with his army into Anglesey, (as is before rehersed,) which is an Iland nere Brytaine, by meanes whereof Bunduica tooke two of their Cities, and committed the notable slaughter before remembred.
She exercised all kinde of crueltie on suche men as shée tooke.
As for the noble women that she gat, she hanged them vppe, and cutte off their paps, and sewed them to their mouthes: besides this, she stretching their bodies oute at length, thruste sharpe stakes cleane throughe them: al which things were done in despighte, when they sacrificed and feasted in their Templas, but specially in the woodde called Andates.
Paulinus, who had now subdued Anglesey, hearyng of the foresaide slaughter, returned to Brytaine, yet woulde hée not aduenture the fortune of battaile with them, fearing theyr number, but when he wanted victual, and that his enimies approched, he was compelled to abide the battell Bunduica· who had in hir army
men, was hir selfe placed in a Chariot, and ordered hir men at length: but Paulinus coulde not stretche his company so long, for that they were not of any suche number, but at length he deuided his army into thrée partes, so that at one time they mighte fighte in sundry places, exhorting them not to be abashed at the multitude of their enimies, for bothe they and their forefathers, hadde wyth lesse number atchieued greater matters, and gotten greater victories.
Adding, that now was the time to play the men, to enioy that in quiet, which before their auncestours had woon, and recouer that whiche they had loste, or else to liue for euer in misery and shame.
Againe, he shewed what crueltie their eyes had séene, by those barbarous people, to suche as they had ouercome, exhorting them in reuenge thereof to fighte manfully, and there was no doubte but the Gods (who were alwayes fauourable to such as had suffered crueltie) woulde helpe them: and better it were to die fighting valiantly, than with reproche to be taken, and die in their enimies handes like Dogges.
Finally, (sayeth he) whether we liue or dye, Brytaine shal be ours, for, though the other Romaines lose it, yet shall our bones continually kéep it.
When he hadde thus spoken, the signe of the battel was giuen, and ech part prepareth himselfe: the Brytaines with great and strange noise, the Romaines in silence came to neare, that they might throwe their dartes to them: and perceiuing their enimies to approche, with greate violence, rushed in amongest them, and brake their a~raye: but after being compassed with the multitude of their enimies, the battel waxed doubtfull.
The lighte harnessed men beganne to smite eache other, and those of heauy armoure togither with the horsemen encountred, and the Romaine Archers foughte againste the Britishe Chariots.
This encounter was made in thrée seueral places, and was foughte with greate courage on bothe sides.
At the laste the Romaines departed Conquerours, many were slaine in the battaile, and many were taken.
Greate numbers whych escaped, prepared to fight againe, but in the meane space Bunduica died of a dissease which she had, and they mourned, and buried hir verye honorablye.
Tacitus saith, that Prasutagus King of the Iceni, a Prince of greate wealth, appointed, that Caesar and his owne twoo daughters shoulde inherite his landes, hereby thinking all his life to be more quiet: and being deceassed, his wife and daughters shoulde be the more safer by meanes of such protection, but it fell oute farre otherwise, for the Centurions gat his Realme, theyr seruauntes spoyled hys house, beat hys wife, and deflowred his daughters: besides, the chiefest men of his lande were displaced of their inheritaunces, and handled extremely.
In reuenge whereof, Bunduica raysed the warre, and committed the slaughter before remembred, and at laste hir army once ouerthrowne by Paulinus, being afraid to fall into hir enimies hands, she poisoned hir selfe.
Policletus then a seruannt of Nero, was sente hither to suruey the state of Brytaine, who discharged Paulinus Suetonius of the gouernement.
PEtronius Turpilianus was sent into Brytaine as a manne easie to be entreated, and being not altogither acquainted with offences of the enimies, was the readier to receiue the~ to grace: who setting matters in their former staye, and attempting no further, deliuered the Prouince vnto Trebellius Maximus.
Trebellius being both and too sluggishe, and also vtterly vnacquainted with experimentes of armes, ruled the prouince· with a certaine mildenesse of gouernement.
Nowe had the barbarous people also learned to wincke at inticing vices, and the ciuil warres of the Romaines then happening, was a cloake to his cowardise: but there presentlye arose discorde betwéene Roscius and Caelius, legates of the. xx. legion, when the souldiors (accustomed to be employed in expeditions) gaue themselues to lasciuiousnesse: wherevppon Trebellius tooke his flighte, and hid hys head, to auoyde the furie of the army, and in moste base and beastly maner, gouerned (as it were) by entreatie, so as they mighte séeme to haue compounded, that the souldiours shoulde liue in all libertie, and the Generall at hys safetie.
This time for a yeare and halfe there was deadly ciuil war amo~g the Romaines for the Empire, betwéen Galba, Otho, and Vitelius.
VEctius Volanus, then was sent hither by Vitelius, he did not vse any discipline or correctio~ in Brytaine, so as there continued the like slouth and cowardise in the souldioures, toward their enimyes, and the Campe still as full of wantonnesse, sauing that Volanus was a good and milde man, and thereby made himselfe beloued where hée shoulde haue béene feared.
In this time Vitelius aduaunced many Souldioures in the Brytaine legions, and Herdonius Flaccus broughte vnto hym
The Brytans séeing ye Romaines thus encombred with ciuil war, began to trouble them, wherefore Volanus would send no succour to Vitelius at his commaundement, when Vespasian warred againste him for the Empire, and all the Brytaines fauored Vespasian.
WHen as (with the rest of the world) Vespasian had recouered Brytaine, the~ were there placed great Captaines, and notable armies, the enemyes hope abated, and Petilius Cerealis broughte greate feare vppon the Brytaines.
The Citie of the Brigantes (which was accounted one of the greatest of the lande) beyng by hym assayled, he hadde manye encountres, and some not withoute slaughter, whereby hée eyther conquered or assayled a greate part of their country.
Iulius Frontinus a man as worthye and valiaunt as was possible, tooke then the charge vpon him, subdued the nation of the Silures, being both valiant warlike notwithstanding the valor of the enemy and difficulties of the places.
This was the state of Brytaine, and course of the warres, whych Agricola found arriuing in the middest of Sommer, the Souldiors euen then beginning to retire to their strengthes, and the enimye searching for his most aduantage.
The Citie of the Ordouices fewe dayes before hys arriuall almoste wholly defeated a company lying vppon their bordures.
This beginning stirred vp the prouince, seruing for an example to them, who coueted the warres, and yet desired to sée what was in their newe Gouernor.
Agricola, although the Sommer were nowe well spent, the bandes dispersed all aboute the prouince, the souldiours had determined to reste for that yeare, the time being late and incommodious to commence the warre, thinking it woulde be better to manne the péeces moste suspected: yet he determined neuerthelesse to preuent daunger, and gathering togither the Standards of the Legions, with a few of his forraine aides, for that the Ordouices durst not take the field, marched foorth agaynste them hymselfe in the vauwarde of his armye, that others might take like courage in the same danger, and put almoste that whole nation to the sworde: then followyng hys good successe, he inuaded Anglesey, (whiche Suetonius had before attempted) causing certaine Brytaines that serued him, and knewe the shallows and maner of swimming, wyth horse and harnesse to passe ouer into the Isle on a sodaine, wherewith the inhabitauntes were so amazed (who feared nothing bycause they sawe no nauie) that they submitted the Ile vnto him, immediately.
Nowe hauing some quietnesse, and perceyuing that warre would little preuaile againste the Brytaines, if they were iniuriouslye handled, he purposed to cut off al causes of quarrel, and first reforming his owne familie, did nothing partially, onely respected the vertue of men, loosened tributes, and behaued himsefe moste honourably.
When the Sommer beganne, he assembled his armies, trayned his souldioures, forrayed the enimies Countries with sodaine inuasions to their greate feare, and yet so fauorably, as many Countries willingly yéelded vnto him, and suffered Castelles to be builte among them.
The Winter following he spente in ciuill administration, counsayling the people priuately, and helping them publikely, to builde houses, Temples, and Courte houses.
He procured noble mens children to study liberall Sciences, and then beganne the Brytaines to conforme themselues to Romaine fashions and attyre.
The thirde yeare he discouered people in the Northe hitherto vnknowne, euen as farre as Tau, terrifying the people, and placing fortresses moste wisely to the annoyaunce of the enimie, The fourth Sommer he employed getting those Countries whiche hitherto he had passed throughe, euen to the Edenborough Frith, and Cluid, the narrowe space betwéene the whych waters he fortified.
The fifth yeare by Sea he discouered and vanquished further nations in the North, and placed garrisons in the coast towarde Irelande, wherevnto he also aspired, and to that end reteyned an Irish Prince with him, that was driuen oute of his Country by ciuil dissention.
But in the Sommer whiche beganne the sixt yere of hys gouernement, he searched the Hauens by a nauie for that purpose sent to the Sea, fearing leaste all those nations beyonde had vnited themselues and kept the passages by land: but afterward he marched forward, his nauie coasting with his army by land, so as sometime in the same Campe, he had horsemen, footemen, and Seamen, lodged togither.
It was reported by suche as were taken prisoners, that the sighte of the nauie much astonied the Brytaines as men from whom all refuge was cutte off, the secrets of their Seas being discouered, wherefore determining to trie it with hand blowes the inhabitantes of Calidonia with greate preparation, although the reporte thereof were greater (as it often hapneth in vnknowne matters,) of their own accorde, assayled some Castelles, and séeyng themselues rather to bée assaylantes than defendauntes, putte the Romaines in some doubte: wherevpon the pretending pollicie, aduised to retire on this side Bodotria, rather than to be driuen thereto by force, when as in the meane while, Agricola knowing that the enimye woulde charge hym in seuerall troupes and companyes, and fearing to bée ouermatched and couped in wyth number, or deceyued by the ignoraunce of the place, diuided his army into thrée battailes, and so marched forwarde: whiche order marked by hys enimyes, made them alter their purpose, and in the night killing the watch, brake in vpon the ninth legion, halfe asléepe and halfe afrighted, which (as they tooke it) was the weakest, so the fighte continued within the Camp til it was day light, at which time the Romaines began to gather courage, and the Brytaines were discomfited, so as, hadde it not bene for the woodes and bogges, that victorie had ended the whole strife, after which battaile the Romain souldiors grew to be of hautie corage, crying out to pierce the country of Calidonia, that they might finde oute the vttermoste portes and boundes of Brytaine.
The Romaynes on the other side, ascribing the prayse of this victorie, not to the prowesse of the Romaine souldioure, but to Fortune, and the wilinesse of their Capitaine, vsed al meanes possible, to hearten vppe and arme their Youth: bestowing their wiues and children in of safegarde, and by sacrifices and holy assemblyes vnite all their Cities togither, vpon these resolutions they remoued.
In the beginning of the next Sommer which was y^. viij. yere of his charge, Agricola seding his fléet before him, which often put a land and spoyled the Countreys, thereby causing a great and vncertaine feare: himselfe with a picked army, whervnto he added of the valiantest Brytains, came to y^ mountain Grampius, whereon his enimies had encamped, (for the Brytaines nothing quailed by the successe of the former encounter,) and expecting nothyng but a reuenge, or bondage, learning at length, that common daunger is only to be resisted with common consent, by leagues and embassages hadde stirred vppe the mindes of all the Cities aboute.
Nowe were there to be séene in armes thirtie thousande and vpwarde, vnto whiche number, the Youth, and all such as were of strong and lustie yeares, euery man bearing his tokens of prayse about him, continually repayred from al sides.
When amongest manye other Capitaines, Calgacus a man bothe in nobilitie and valor aboue the rest, spake to the assembly in this manner: As often as behold the causes of this warre, and oure necessitie, my minde gyueth me greate hope, that this day and youre mutuall consent shal be the beginning of libertie to all Brytaine, for, euerye one of you hauing tryed seruitude, and hauing no other land nor sea, whiche can saue vs (the Romaines nauie being at our elbowes) the verye warre and weapons whyche are the honoure of the worthy, muste be the onelye safetie of the
With these and manye suche reasons drawne from the calamitie of their future seruitude, the pride tira~ny of their Gouernoures, the fickle friendship of the strangers, seruing in their enimies Campe, ready to change vpon anye highe occasion, and the presente remedye of all misery, whyche, as he sayde in the beginning, was onely valiancie, he so stirred vp all mens mindes, that they applauded his Oration after theyr manner, with songs and diuers kinde of noyses.
This Oration being ended, as also Agricola hys spéeche to hys Souldioures, the twoo armies beganne to Agricola placed hys battayles in this order: he made his mayne battayle of the straungers (his aydes) whiche were in number· viij. thousand, on eche side wherof, for wings he placed hys horssemen to the number of thrée thousande, and his legions he caused to guard the trenches of his Campe, that if it were possible, the victorie mighte be gained without the sheading of Romaine bloude, or if his maine battel were broken, they might be gathered againe, and the fighte restored by hys legions.
The battaile of the Brytaines (to terrify their enimies, as also to make their brauest shew,) stode on higher ground, so as their vawarde beyng come vppon the playne, the reste were on the foote of the hill, their Chariots, in the meane tyme, galloping vp and downe the fielde, making greate showtes and cries.
Then Agricola perceyuing the number of his enimes to bée greater than his owne, and fearing to be charged bothe on the face and of his battayle at one time, and that manye thoughte necessary to haue the legions aduannced forwarde, remayned notwythstanding, firme in his firste resolution, causing his battaile to be somewhat drawn in lengthe, himselfe alighted from his horse, and stoode on foote before his Standerdes.
The first fighte was with shotte of Arrowes and during whiche time, the Brytaines, both skilfully and couragiouslye with their huge Swordes small Bucklers, eyther bare or brake the Romaines shotte, and answered them with an infinite number of the like, vntill Agricola was perswaded by bandes of Holanders, and Brabanders, that the matter mighte be broughte to swordes and whiche kinde of fight they re acquainted withall, by long haunting the warres, and the same was very incommodious for their enjuries, bearing but small shieldes, and vnmeasurable Swordes: For the pointlesse Swords of the Brytaynes, were for a throng, and where they wanted roomth.
Wherefore the Holanders strake thicke togither, and thrust them ouer the Bucklers, wounding them in the faces, and hauyng broken that battell, passed forward towarde them whiche kepte the hill, whiche séene by the reste of the Romaine bandes, they partelye moued by enuye of the others glorye, and partelye by of their owne courages, cutte in péeces those that they firste encountred, leauing notwythstanding, some halfe deade, and others not touched, for haste, to obtaine a perfecte victorie.
In the meane whyle, the troupes of the Brytaine horsemenne, dydde take their flighte, but the Chariots putte themselues among the foote bandes, whyche kinde of fighte, (at firste) séemed somewhat terrible to their enimies, but it long serued not their tournes, being assayled wyth a thicke prease of their ennimyes, and the grounde not commodious for the Chariots, nor their ryders all of the beste.
So as at the laste, theyr Chariot horses, coursing vppe and downe the field without guiders, manye of their owne company, as they fled for feare from one place to an+other.
The Brytaines, whiche al this while kepte the hill, came not to ye fight, making little reconing of the smal number of the Romaines, beganne by little and little to descend, entending to hem them in, in the middest of their conquest, which surely they had done, if Agricola, suspecting the same, hadde not dispatched foure companies of horsemen (whiche he kept for all sodaines) to encounter with them, who, the more fiercely they assayled, so much the more sharply repulsed them, and sent them to flight: wherevpon the deuise of the Brytaines turned to their owne harme.
Moreouer, by Agricola his co~mandement the wings of horsemen were taken from the front of his battel, were made to charge vpon the battel of his enimies, standing ouer against them.
Then might you beholde in the open field, a gréeuous and lamentable spectacle, some folowed the chace, some tooke prisoners, and after killed them to take others.
Now the enimies as euery one thoughte beste, fledde, some in heapes and armed fledde from a smaller number: other, thoughe vnarmed, tarryed and were slaine: euery where laye weapons, rcasses, and lymmes, out of the ground all bloudy: sometime the vanquished approching neare to Woodes, woulde make hed, and entrap the héedlesse followers, so as, if Agricola hadde not caused certayne lusty bandes in the manner of a search, and also diuers horsemen· leauing their horse where the Wooddes were thicke, and other on horsebacke, where the Wóoddes would suffer, to raunge them all aboute, there might haue béen some detriment receiued by too much hardinesse· But when the Brytaines sawe themselues pursued in order of battaile, they tooke againe their flight, not in companies, as before, nor tarrying one for an other, but here and there, euen as men glad to escape, sought long, and by wayes.
There were slaine of the Brytaines about tenne thousand: of the Romaine army, thrée hundred and fortie, among whome Aulus Atticus, Capitaine of aband, whom the heat of his youth, and corage of his horse broughte into the hands of his enimies.
That night the victors made mery wyth the spoyle, but the Brytaines wandering vppe and downe, men and women lamenting togither, reléeued, and fetcht awaye their hurte men, assembled togither the whole, forsooke their houses, and for anger sette fire on them, choosing themselues lurking places, which straite they forsooke againe· sometime· conceyuing good hope, whyche straighte waye quayled agayne: and some were knowen to kyll theyr wyues and chyldren, as thoughe they hadde therein taken compassion vppon them· The nexte daye made the victorie more manifest, in which there was nothing but silence, the hilles being then forsaken, and also the houses smoking a far off.
Agricola sendyng abroade his espialles, coulde finde no ennimye to make wherefore Sommer being too farre spente to procéede any further in the warre, he hadde his Souldioures into the coastes of the and there taking hostages, caused his nauie to coaste aboute Brytaine, whiche at laste arriued at the Hauen called· Trutulensis, afterwarde hauing bestowed his souldioures in their wintering places· departed Brytaine, and lefte the prouince in quiet to his successor.
Diuers affirme, that about this time, the Gospell of Christe our sauiour was first preached in this Iland.
Simon borne in Cana Galilei, who for his feruent affection to his Maister, the greate zeale hée tooke by al meanes to the Gospell, was surnamed Zelotes, he hauing receyued the holy Ghoste from abone· trauayled and then through Mauritania and all Lybia, preaching the Gospell.

Gospel dled in Brytaine by Ioseph of Ahia that bled the body of Christe. writing against the Jewes of those times· sayth· The Brytaines inhabita~ts of places vnknown to the Romaines, yet did obey and were subiect to the kyngdomes of Christ.
William of Malmesbury, in his Book of the Antiquities of Glastenburie, alleageth Freculphus to wryte in his second Book and fourth Chapter, as followeth: Philip the Apostle, preaching the worde of God in Gaule (nowe called Fraunce chose oute. xij. amongest his Disciples, whome hée sent into Brytaine to preache the word of life, and vpon euery one of them, he most deuoutly stretched out his right hande: ouer these he appointed for chiefe, his deare friende Ioseph of Aramathie, that buried our Lord.
These (saieth Iohn Capgraue, who alleageth Melkin and Merlin came into this lande the yeare of Christes incarnation,

For confirmation whereof, Kyng Henry the second hauing diligently perused the Priuileges and Charters, which he caused to be presented and read, not only of William the first, of William the seconde, and Henry the first his Grandfather: but also the Charters of the Princes his predecessours, of more antient time, to wéete, of Edgar, Edmond, Edward, Elfred, Bringwalthius, Kenthwin, Baldred, Ina, Arthur, and that noble man Cudred, and many other Christian Kings beside, also of Kenewalla, sometyme a Heathen and Pagan Kyng, concerning the house of Glastenburie· found, that in some of those Charters it is called the Mother of Saintes, of some other, the Graue of the Saints, and that the sayde place was firste builded euen by the very Disciples of Christe themselues, and by them dedicated to oure Lorde, as the firste place whiche he chose to himselfe in this Realme: al which the foresaid King Henry established by his Charter.
MArius sonne of Aruiragus, an excellent wise man, was ordayned King of Brytaine.
At this season Rodrike King the Pictes, (whiche were people of Scythia accompanyed with the Scots inuaded Brytaine, spoyled the country with sword fire, against whom Marius with his knights asse~bled in al hast, gaue the~ sharp battel, wherin Rodrike was slain, with a great number of his souldiors vpon Stansemore, in token of which victorie, there was a stone not far from Carleile erected, with this inscription, In token of Marius victorie.

DOmitianus the Emperor se~t Salustius Lucullus into Brytaine, whom he shortly put to death, for that he suffred certaine lawes to be called Lucullen, after his name.
What Lieutenants were in Brytaine for the time of Nerua Traiane, find not recorded: but when Adrian was possessed in the Empire, Iulius Seuerus gouerned here vnder him, who~ Adrianus called out of Brytaine, to war against ye Jews, came hither himselfe in person, pacified the tumults, reared a wall, which shoulde separate the barbarous from hys subiects, and returned to Rome.

You required that we should send you the Romain Imperial laws, ye you might vse the~ in your kingdom of Brytaine, but those laws we may disproue, not the lawes of God.

There remayneth in the Churche of Saint Peter vpon Cornhil at London, a Table, wherein is written, that Lucius fou~ded the same Church to be an Archbishops sea, and made it the Metropolitane and chiefe Churche of hys Kingdome, whych so endured the space of
Ioseline of Fornes, in his booke that he wrote of the Brytish Bishops, saith, that Thean, who was first Archbishop of Lo~don, in the time of Lucius, builded the said Church of S. Peter in a place called Cornhil in London, by the aide and help of Ciran, chief Butler to King Lucius, also that Clauus, the seco~d Archbishop there, builded a Librarie to the same church adioyning, conuerted many of the Erwydes (learned men in the Pagan Law) to the Christian faith.

COmodus after his father Antonius Philosophus succeded in the Empire with most cruel tyranny.
In his time the Northerne Britains burst in through the wall, forrayed the Countrey, and slew the Romaine Generall with his souldiours, wherfore Vlpius Marcellus was appointed here a careful vigilant Captaine: he sore annoyed the Brytains, which were enemies to the Romain state, and purchasing enuie by his vertue, was shortly dismissed· Then Ceronnis who ruled all vnder Comodus, appointed certaine men of base estate to gouerne the Romain enemies here, wherewith the souldiours being gréeued, sent.
chosen men out of theyr number to Rome, who accusing hym before Comodus to compasse the Empire, for his sonne was deliuered vnto them, who immediatelye mangled hym and slew his wife with his two sonnes.
Comodus the~ sent Holnius Pertinax into Brytain, and surnamed himselfe Brytanicus, thervnto perswaded by flatterers, when the Brytaines were so euill affected toward him, that they woulde haue nominated some other Emperour against him, and namely Pertinax: but these tumults were appeased by the Wisdome of Pertinax, to his great danger, for he was slaine in tumulte, and left among the dead, whiche iniurie he after seuerallye reuenged, sued for his discharge, being afterwarde preferred to the Empire.
Clodius Albinus was then sente hyther by Comodus· who at the first so greatlye estéemed of him, that he honored hym with y^ title of a Caesar· which Clodius refused: but afterwards when a false rumor was dispersed, yt Comodus was slain, he made an Oratio~ to the legions of Brytain, impeaching yt gouernement of Emperours, and preferring the Senate, wher+vpon Commodus being sharpned againste hym, sente Iunius Seuerus to rule héere, and shortly after Comodus was slaine. slaine.
iij. months was slaine throughe the of Didius Iulianus, who enioyed the Empire two monthes, and the practice of Clodius Albinus, which then returned into Brytain, and (as it séemeth) recouered his former gouernement.
SEuerus after the death of Pertinax was saluted Emperor: he immediately slewe Didius Iulianus, and bycause he feared Clodius Albinus with his Brytain legions, he created him Caesar, and partaker of the Empire, and sente Heraclitus to gouerne this Ile: but after he had subdued Niger who also vsurped the Empire, he moued warre against Albinus, who passing hence into Fraunce with the Brytish army, encountered with Seuerus neare Lions, and was there slaine.
Henceforthe Seuerus quietly enioyed the Romaine Empire, made sharp wars into the Easterne partes of the world, with great glorie.
But returning to Rome, he vnderstoode of a war raysed in Brytaine.
Wherefore he hasted hyther with his two sonnes Bassianus and his arriuall peace was offered, whithe he refused, and leauing his yonger sonne Geta to gouerne the prouince, (being the hyther part of the Ile) he with Bassianus hys eldest sonne entred into the Northe, and passed y^ further parte of thys Ilande without any resistaunce: yet by ambushes, difficultie of the way, other inconueniences, he lost.
men, and then returned, enforcing the enemies to conclude a league, and yéelde some parte of theyr Countrey.
At conclusion of which league, when he and his sonne rid to treate with the Caledontans or Northern Brytains, Bassianus his sonne drawing his sworde in the sighte of the enemie, was ready to haue slaine him, and had done it, had not some of the company made an outcry: yet this fault was remitted.
After this league, the Brytaines of the North resorted to the Emperours Courte, wher Iulia, Seuerus wife, obiected to a woma~ of Brytaine, the wife of Argentorix the Caledonian, that the Brytish women accompanyed wyth men dishonestlye, quoth the Brytishe woman, we satisfy the naturall luste in better sorte than you Romaynes, for we accompanye our selues openly wyth the beste menne; and you committe adulterie closely wyth moste vyle persons.
But after this league there was a generall reuolte of the Brytaynes againste the Romaines, which yet was pacifyed with great slaughter, and then he builte a Wall of Turfe, to inhibite the Northern Brytaines, from whence when he retourned, at the nexte lodging, a blacke Moore that serued him, a notable scoffer, mette him wyth a Crowne of Cypres: hée moued with the colour of the man and the Cypres (whiche was then vsed at all burials,) as with signes of euill lucke, commaunded the manne to be sente awaye, wherewyth he cryed: Thou haste bene all in all, and hast banquished all, and now of a couquerour be thou a GOD.
Then commyng to the Citie of Yorke (as it is supposed,) he was by mistaking brought to the Temple of Bellona: blacke beasts also being ordayned· for sacrifice, followed him home to hys Pallace: which things these then dyd acco~pt to be ominons.
Shortly after he departed· out of this life at Yorke, partly through sicknesse, and partly through griefe conceiued of hys sonnes euill demeanoure.
At his last gaspe he vttered these words: found the state troublesome euery where, and leaue it quiet euen to the Brytaines.
Herodian writeth, that in these wars of Seuerus against ye North Brytains, he founde their Country full of watry Marishes: by those marishes did the Britains swim and skirmish with their enemies, being couered with water vp vnto the Nauell, not caring that men saw the priuie partes of theyr naked bodyes.
Neyther dyd they knowe the vse of apparel, but accustomed to compasse theyr bellyes and neckes onely wt Iron, which they estéemed an ornament token of riches, as other barbarous people supposed of Gold.
They paynted their bodyes with diuerse pictures and formes of beastes, and therefore ware no garmente, leaste the painting should be hidden, being a nation very valiaunt, and warlyke, gréedy of slaughter, and content only with a small target, a speare, and a skayne hanging by their naked sides, ignoraunt of the vse of shyrtes of mayle and helmets, for they reckned ye same comberous vnto them, when they shoulde swimme ouer the lakes &c.
gréetious disease came vpon Seuerus, being sore appalled with age, so that he was constrained to kéepe his chamber and sende Antonius vnto the warres: but Antonie not regarding the businesse of Brytaine, endeauoured by all meanes he coulde, to winne the hartes of the souldiours vnto hym, deprauing hys brother, to the intente they shoulde only aide him to the attayning of the soueraintie.
The long maladie of his Father, caused him to perswade Phisitions to rid the olde man out of the worlde, vntil that Seuerus, being consumed, ended his life, who was the moste famous of all Emperours in war like affayres: For none other had obtayned so many victories and conquests, either ciuil against his aduersaries, or for rayne against the barbarous nations.
Thus deceased he, after he had gouerned the Empire the space of xviij. yeares, leauing his sonnes for successours in the same: vnto whom he left also greate aboundaunce of riches, as none of his previcessours had before hym done.
When Antony had gotten the supreme authoritie, he put to death the Phisitio~s, bycause they obeyed not his commaundemente in hastnyng hys Fathers deathe: and slewe all his owne, and brothers bringers vp and instructers, for that they wente about to reconcile them, leauing none aliue, that was eyther of dignity, or had reuerenced his Father.
The Captaines of the army, he enticed, to perswade the souldiours to proclayme him only Emperour: imagining dayly manifold mischiefes against his brother: but he could not win the souldiours good willes.
Wherefore Antony, hauing taken truce with the Britans, remoued towardes his mother and brother.
Their mother laboured to bring them to agréement, wherein also, manye prudente Counsellours earnestly trauelled.
Antony thereby was enduced, rather of force, than good will; to counterfaite loue.
Empire with equal honour, launched out of Brytaine, and sayled with the reliques of theyr Father toward Rome.
For when they had burned the bodye (as was the custome of the Romaines) they carryed the ashes, (intermedled with pleasaunt odours, in a Boxe of Alabaster) to Rome, that it mighte be ther enterred amongst the monuments of other Princes.
Themselues led thus their army, as conquerors of Brytain, passed ouer ye Ocean vnto the next coaste of Fraunce, and so hasted towards Rome.
When they were entred into Rome, all the people crowned with Laurel, receyued, and the Senate welcomed them.
And nexte vnto them followed the Consuls, bearing the vessel with Seuerus reliques.
Whiche vessel, the people, after they had saluted the newe Emperour, did reuerently worshippe.
The Emperours Consuls being thus accompanyed wyth Princely pompe, the saine into the Temple, where the deuine monuments of Marcus· and other Emperors, are séene.
After they had finished the solemne sacrifise, and according to ye auntient vsage, celebrated the Funerall ceremonies, both the brethre~ departed into the Emperiall palace: which they deuided betwéene them, closed vp all backe dores, and priuie posterns, mette togither only at y^ outter gates.
They chose besides eyther of the~ vnto himselfe a soundry guarde, neuer came togyther vnlesse it were sometime for a little whyle to be séene of the people.
Neuerthelesse, firste of all, they accomplished the due Funerals of their Father.
For the Romaines accustome to consecrate with immortalitie, such Emperours; as at theyr death, leae eyther children, or successoures in the Empire behinde them.
And those which are endued with that honor, they canonize ongst the Gods.
There is through the Cittie, a certaine· dolefull lamentation, mixed with fearefull
And they vse to enterre the dead corpse very sumptuously.
But then, they haue an Image, made as like the deade Emperour, as may be.
The same, within the Porche, of the Emperial Pallace, they lay in a gret and high bed of Iuorie, couered ouer with cloth of gold.
The same Image looketh very pale, like a diseased patient.
About the bed on eyther side, a great part of the day, do certayne persons sit.
That is to wit on the left side, the Senate, clothed in blacke garments: and on the right side, many matrones.
None of these are séene to weare any ouches, or chaynes of golde, but being clad wyth thinne white vestures, they shew the countenaunce of mourners.
And thus doe they continue the space of seauen dayes: during the which, euery daye the Emperours Phisitions do repayre vnto the bed, and, as though they had felt the patie~ts Pulses, declare that he waxeth more sicke than before.
Finally, when it séemeth that he is deceased, certain of the most noble and worthye yong men, of the orders of Knightes and Senators, doe take vp the bedde on theyr shoulders, and cary it through the stréete, called Sacra via, vnto the olde market place, where the Romain magistrats are accustomed to render vp their Offices.
There on both sides, are certaine stages made with steppes, vppon the whiche, on the one side, is a queare of Boyes, being noble mens sonnes, and on the other side are many beautiful women, singing Himnes and Ballades, in prayse of the deade Emperour, measured with diuerse lamentable verses.
When these are finished, the yong men do take vp the bedde againe, and beare it out of the Citie, into the fielde called Campus Martius, in the broadest part whereof, there is erected a Towre foure square, with sides of equall height builded of great Timber, like vnto a Tabernacle.
The same within forthe, is filled wyth drye chippes, and Réedes: And on the outter side, it is hanged wyth Arras clothes of golde, and decked with· Images of Iuorie, and sundry painted pictures.
Within it also, is another lesse Towre, but like in forme, with doores and Portals opened.
And ouer that, the third and fourth, with many other roomes ascebdubg continually, vntill they retche vnto the highest, which is lesse than all the other.
man maye compare thys building vnto Towres, whyche are sette in hauens, wyth fire on the toppes, to directe shippes whiche sayle by nighte on the Seas, into theyr perfecte portes.
Nowe when they haue putte the bed in the seconde Tabernacle, they gather all kyndes of spices and perfumes, wyth diuerse odoriferous fruites, Hearbes, and iuyces, the whyche they throwe on heapes in the Tabernacle.
Neyther is there anye Nation, Citie, or Person, whyche excelleth in honoure, or dignytie, but at that tyme, wyll to the vttermoste of hys power, most honorablye celebrate the laste Funeralles of the Emperour.
When they haue couched a greate heape of Spices togither, and stuffed the building therewyth, all the Romayne Knightes doe ride aboute the Towre, with a iuste course and order too and fro: Chariots are also drawne aboute, wherein manye doe sitte, clothed in purple, representyng the persons of all noble men being Magistrates and Captaines of Rome.
The Ceremonies being throughly ended, the successour in the Empire, taketh a brande of fire in his hande, and fireth therewith the Tabernacle.
After whome, all other that are present, doe throwe fire likewise into the same.
And immediately, all the building being filled with those drye stickes and spices, beginneth to burne vehementlye.
Then out of the highest and leaste Towre, as out of a hygh stéeple, is let forth an Eagle, the which they beléeue, doeth beare the Emperours soule into Heauen.
And from thencefoorthe is that Emperour worshipped as the other Gods.
From this time to the raigne of Dioclesian, for the space of.
yeares, there is nothing recorded in our Histories hythereto published concerning Brytaine: but where as it is manifest that the soueraintie of Brytain rested in ye Romain Emperours al that space, wil set them here downe successiuely.
After Seuerus, Bassianus surnamed Antonius Carracalla, murdering his brother Geta, succeded in the Empire.
Hée was cruel to his people: he founded the Bath in Rome, which is called Antonians: he was out of measure giuen to sensualitie, and carnal concupisence in so much, that he espoused his mother in law Iuba· He was murdered by Martialis when he had gouerned by yeares.
Seuerus Alexander, who was slayne by his souldiours here in Brytaine, in a vyllage called Sicila, but other save in Fraunce. xiij. yeares.
tyrants, of the which Lollianus Posthumius, Victorianus Tetritius, as it is supposed, Brytaine from Gallicinus.
In whiche time Bonefus a Brytaine borne, but brought vppe in Spaine, fearing least he shold be executed bycause the Germaines had burnte certaine vessels in the Rhene, whereof he had charge, vsurped the Empire with Proculus at Colen· and woulde haue exempted from the Romaines, Brytaine, Spaine, and part of Fraunce: but being baquished by Probus in a long and sore battaile, he stangled himselfe: some sedition was then raised in Brytaine, and appeased by Victorinus a Moore, by whose motion Probus had made him regent of Brytain, whiche was causer of this trouble.
Thys Probus permitted the Brytaines and others, that they might haue vines and make wine.
After he had raigned fine yeares, he was slaine by the souldiours.
CAius then succéeded him, with his two sonnes Numerianus, and Carinus, to whiche Carinus he assigned Brytaine Gaule, (called Fraunce Illiricum, Italie, and Spaine, but all thrée within thrée yeares space lost their liues.
VAlerius Dioclesianus was then chosen Emperour, who adioyned Maximianus vnto hym in lyke gouernement.
Aboute thys tyme, holy Alban for professing Christ, being ledde from the Cittie of Verolamium, vnto Holmehurst, where nowe the towne of Saint Albans is builded, suffered martyrdome, who is specified to be the first Martyre of Brytaine: and shortly after to the number of one thousande Christia~s, were martyred at Lichfielde, where Amphabole, instructer of Alban, was taken, broughte to Verolamium, and there tormented to death.
Carausius was appointed to be admirall of the Brytaine Seas, whyche were sore troubled by the Pyracies of the Franckes and Saxons: but when he had oftentimes apprehended the Pirates, and neyther reserued the prizes, or was accountable for it, neyther to the Emperours, nor his deputies, it was suspected that of set purpose he permitted these Rouers to haue recourse through those Seas, to the ende hée mighte rifle them, and inrich himself.
Maximianus therfore sent part of his armye to suppresse him, in which were manye of the Thebane legion, who in thys iourney were slayne, by his commaundemente, and made martyres bycause they professed Christ.
Carausius vnderstanding of the preparatio~ made against him, passed out of Gaule into Brytaine, where bringing the Countrey to hys obeysaunce, he vsurped the Roabe of an Emperour: wherevppon they whiche were sente to surprise him, retourned to Maximianus, who then was encombered with newe warre in Gaule agaynste the Peasantes.
In the meane time Carausius built shippes in Brytayn, intercepted certayn co~panyes of souldiours, assembled a gret number of barbarous people with spoyle, with hope of who~ he purposed to trouble the sea coastes of Gallia Spaine.
Holland (also then holden by certayne Frankes reuolted to Carausius.
THen purposed Maximianus the seconde tyme to make warre agaynste Carausius, but by stormye weather, and wante of Pilotes, hée was enforced to deferre hys purpose, leauyng the gouernement of thys Ile to Carausius.
Shortlye after, the two Emperours elected two Caesars, Valerius Maximus and Constantius Chlorus, to which Constantius they committed the recouerie of Brytaine.
Hée immediatelye passing through Gaule hytherwarde, sodaynely surprised Gesseriacum, nowe called Bullen, (whiche Carausius had manned,) and so stopped the Hauen, that it could stande Carausius in no stéede.
Then building shippes to passe ouer hither, he first assayled luckily the Hollanders, whiche had reuolted to Carausius: and then staying for conuenient winde, he houered a while on the sea coaste, and in the meane tyme Carausius was traytorously slayne by Alectus his familiar friende.
ALbertus then vsurped the Empire here in Brytayne, agaynste whome Constantine wyth hys former preparation made readye for warre, and launched out in haste, thoughe the winde was contrarie: Whyche when hys souldiours vnderstoode, they sette out also wyth side windes out of the Seyne and other Ports, in suche foggie and mystie weather, that they passed by Alectus Nauie, then honering for them aboute the Ile of Wighte, not séeing one the other.
The Romaines as soone as they landed burnte theyr shippes, determining either to winne, or lose their liues, which when Allectus vnderstoode, he left the shore, and prepared himselfe for battaile with his Mercenarie barbarous souldiours, in which he was slaine, by Asclepiodatus Lorde greate maister of the Emperours house.
In thys fight none of the Romaynes perished, but here al the fielde was with deade bodyes of the enimies, among whom lay Alectus himselfe, without any Imperiall ornamentes, and scantly knowen.
Other Romaine souldiours also whiche had loste theyr companye in the myste, arriued at London, slewe in the Citie greate number of barbarous people whyche escaped from the battaile, and purposed to haue sacked London.
Then when Constantius came a lande, the Brytains with their wiues and children flocked vnto him, and submitted themselues ioyfully, being nowe deliuered out of a long thraldome.
Thys expedition of Constantius into Brytain, is ascribed by some to Maximianus, into which error a false inscription of the Panegirike hath led them.
ASclepiodatus· as is before touched, recouered Brytaine, he belayde the Citie of London with a strong siege, wherein was Liuius Gallus the Romaine Captaine: and ere it long, by Knightly force and violence, entred the Citie, and slew the forenamed Gallus, neare vnto a brooke there at that daye running, into whiche brooke he threwe him, by reason wherof, it was called in Brytish Nant Gallon, since in the Saxon tongue Gallus or Wallus brooke: and thys daye, the stréete where the brooke ranne, is called Walbrooke.
COill after Asclepiodatus toke on him the Kingdome of Brytaine.
COnstantius bega~ his Empire with Gallerius, the Empire was deuided betwéen them: so that Constantius shoulde possesse Affrica, Italie, Fraunce, and Brytaine: Gallerius shoulde haue Illirica, Asia, and the East partes: whiche done, they substituted vnder them two Caesars.
Co~stantius holding himselfe content with the dignitie of Augustus, refused to sustaine the trouble whiche he shoulde haue endured through the administration of the affaires of Italie and Affricke: hée sought by all meanes howe he mighte enriche the people of the Empire.
He abolished the superstition of the Gentiles in his dominions, so that afterwarde Brytaine felt no persecutions.
The yeare following he passed out of Fraunce hyther against the Pictes, at whiche time his sonne Constantine, who then serued Galerius, perceyuing his destructien to be compassed, posted to his Father in al haste, howghing killing the post horsses, whych way so euer he passed, that he mighte not be pursued, and came to his Father the verye houre that he wente aboorde to come into Brytaine: but Constantius as soone as he came to Yorke, sodainely sickned, and perceyuing his daye to drawe neare, when he was asked to whome hée woulde leaue the Empire, aunswered, to Constantine, and shortly after departed.
COnstantine surnamed the great, sonne of Constantius by Helena, first consecrated, hys Father being nowe deade, and with so great sorrowe and sheading of teares, solempnized his burial, that the souldiours hoping he would resemble hys Father, saluted him Emperour at Yorke against his wil: but when the Romaine Senate had confirmed hys election with theyr consent he willingly accepted it.
And the yere folowing setting the affayres of Brytaine in order, he passed hence wyth manye Brytaines, firste agaynste the Frankes whome he vanquished, then agaynste Maxentius an Usurper, whome he slewe: and afterwarde agaynste Licinus who named hymselfe Emperour, whome also he subdued.
He establyshed the Gospell in hys Empyre, and after hym all Emperoures were Christians.
In the firste beginnyng of hys raygne, hée was worthye to haue bene compared wyth the beste and chiefest Princes of the Romaines that euer were: and at the ende thereof, to be resembled to such as were of the meaner sort.
He was much giuen to purchase prayse and fame by feates of cheualrie: hée had good fortune in battaile, and yet not so good, but that his industrye excelled it farre.
After he had repressed the ciuill warres, he vanquished the Gothes in diuerse places: and wanne greate memorie of prayse among the Barbarians: He applyed himselfe wholly to the studye of the Liberal artes: he endeauored to gayne the loue of the people, through his well deseruings, séeking the same by his great liberalitie.
The Cittie whiche he builte, he made it able to compare (in manner) with Rome it selfe.
And as he made prepation for battaile against the Parthians, he died at Nicomedia.
Eusebius writeth that Constantine was baptised firste in the last dayes of his life in Gracia, in the Cittie of Nicomedia, of the Bishoppe there.
Also Sozomenus Theodoritus write, that he was baptized in his latter dayes a little before his death, when he wist he should dye, in the xxxj. yere of hys Empire.
He left behinde him thrée sonnes, to witte Constantinus Constans, and Constantius, to succéede him in the Empire.
Helen ye mother of Constantine the great at Ierusalem fou~d the Crosse on the which Christ suffered his passion, she repaired the Citie of Ierusalem, and adorned it with manye fayre Churches.
About this time Octauius whom Constantine had left gouernour· in this Ilande, rebelled, against whom Constantine sent Traherne wyth a legion of Romaines, who (after diuerse conflictes) was slaine.
Gratianus surnamed Funarius, was at this time gouernour of the Romaine legions here.
COnstantinus beganne his Empire and raigne ouer Brytain: wt him his Father Constantine had appointed by his laste will, that hys two brethren Constans and Constantius shoulde participate and haue theyr portion of the Empyre, but not long after, when Constantinus attempted warre agaynste hys brother at Aquileia, and demeaned hymselfe vnaduisedlye therein, he was slayne, and then was the Empire reduced vnder the gouernement of the two brethre~ only.
COnstans then ruled Brytain, which he administred with greate iustice: but after when he fayled of hys health, he associated vnto him in stéede of friendes, euil desposed perso~s to assist him, throughe whose euill counsell he declyned into horrible vices, by meane whereof, waxing scant tollerable of the inhabitantes of the prouinces, he was slaine by Magnentius who vsurped the Empire in France, Spaine, Brytaine also as some write.
COnstantius then had the regiment of Brytaine, who sent hither a Spaniarde called Paule, a notarie by profession, to bring out certaine men of warre whiche had conspired wyth Magnentius: but he vpon false surmises grieuously molested the guiltlesse, fettering and manacling whome hée pleased.
Wherevpon· Martinus, then lieuetenant in Brytaine, being moued with compassion, desired hym to forbeare the harmelesse: but he was so rigorous, that he also charged Martinus himselfe of conspiracie with Magnentius and was earnest to bring him before the Emperour: wherevppon Martinus drawing his sword at him, and bycause he coulde not slaye him, he sodainely slewe himselfe, and Paule embrued with bloud, haled a gret company (linked in chaynes) to the Emperours presence, which were eyther banished, executed, or attainted.
Constantius after this appointed Iulianus to gouerne Gaule (or Fraunce at whiche time greate spoyle was made in Brytaine by the Scottes and Pictes, wherefore Iulianus busied with warre against the Almains, sente Lupcinus hyther with an armye, in whose absence Iulianus vsurped the Empyre: whereof when Constantius hearde, he retourned from the warre (against the Parthians, against Iulianus, and dyed in the way.
IVlianus (called the Apostata began his raign ouer Brytain the Empire, a ma~ séen passing wel in the Liberal scie~ces, but an earnest aduersarie of Christian religion: he banished Palladius a gret and honorable person into Brytain, vpon a suspition: he sent Alipius who had bin lieuetenaunt of Brytaine to repaire Ierusalem, but terrible flashes of fire issuing out of the Earth, when they layde the foundations, enforced them to leaue theyr purpose.
This Iulian, with great preparations made war vpon the Parthians, he spoyled Assiria, and retournyng from thence a conqueror, he was slaine by hys enimies, as he preased vnaduisedly into the battels.
After him succéeded in the Empire Ieninian, and held it. ix. monthes.
The Pictes, Scottes, Attacots, and Saxons, grieuously molested the Brytaines.
Nectaridius who had the charge of the Sea coastes here, was slaine by them, and Bulchobandes a greate Captain was enclosed by them: wherfore after diuerse Captaines; Theodosius was sent hither, who discomfiting the +nimie, and recouering the spoyle, entred triumphantlye into London, and the next yeare we~t into the North, suppressed the enemies, recouered the prouince, and repaired Cities fortresses: hée oppressed Valentinus an Hungarian, who being banished hither, practised new tumults, deliuering him to Dulcitus to be executed, without any enquirie of his confederats, bycause he would not renew the tumult: whiche done, he returned to Rome.
Shortly after Valentinian sente hither Fraomarins (which he before had ordayned king of the Buccenobats in Germanie to be marshall of the Almaines whiche serued in Brytain.
He to the entent he might better repaire the decayed state of the Empire, made Theodotius a copartener with him in it.
MAximus a valiaunt worthy man was shortly after forced here in Brytain to take the Empire vpon him, who passed into Fraunce, and immediately al the Germaine legions and Romaine souldiours reuolted vnto hym from Gratian, so that hée being destitute of men of warre, fledde to Lyons, where he was slayne by treason: for Maximus gaue out that Gratians wife was comming to hir husbande, whiche Gratian intierly louing hys wife, lightlye credited, and therfore accompanyed wyth a few, wente forthe to méete hyr: but in the Coache where he supposed to haue founde hys wife, was Andragatius a desperate man, who leaping out of the Coache killed Gratian.
Then Maximus created his sonne Victor a Caesar, and vsed some crueltie against Gratians Captaines.
Valentinian being herewith terrifyed, sent S. Ambrose vnto him to treate a peace, which he accepted, and Theodotius permitted him to vse the title of Augustus.
Then he setled himselfe at Trier in Germanie, empouerished the Countryes rounde about hym, executed certaine Hereticks called Priscillianists, and then entred into Italie, breaking the peace, and thought to haue intercepted Valentinian, but he with his mother fledde to Theodotius, and persuaded him to take reuenge of Maximus.
In the meane time Maximus came to Aquileia, all Italie and Affrica submitted themselues vnto him, when sodainelye Theodotius comming from Constantinople, moued warre against him, corrupted his souldiours with brybes, and after one or two skirmishes enforced Maximus to flye to Aquileia, where his owne souldiours deliuered him to Theodosius, by whose commaundement he was shortly after beheaded.
Andragatius also who kept the Seas, vnderstanding this, drowned himselfe, and Victor the sonne of Maximus was slaine in Fraunce by Arbogustes.
The Brytaines which serued him retourned into Fraunce, and setled them in the Countrey there, which is now called Brytaine, so was Brytaine recouered againe to the Romaines Empire.
Uirgins, whiche were sente into Brytaine to be married to Conon and hys Knyghtes, were slaine and martyred of the barbarous people being on the sea.
But, as some write, by Attila King of the Hues. HOnorius, the sonne of Theodosius, succéeded in the Empire, in whose time Pelagius, a Brytaine borne, disparckled the venome of his faithlesse Doctrine very farre abroade, holding, that a man might liue well without the help of the grace of God: vsing héerein the ayde of Iulianus of Campania, who was intemperately stirred with the losse of his Bishoprike, to whome Saint Austen, and other Fathers also haue answered in most ample maner, but yet they would not be amended thereby, but being conuicted of their falsehoode, they rather would encrease it by defending and maynteyning it, than amend it by returning to the truth.
This time Marcus was chosen Emperoure by the Souldyoures in Brytaine, fearing the inuasion of the Vandales, but immediately they slewe him, and elected Gratianus, whome also they murthered within foure monethes.
Then Constantine, a Souldiour of base estate, onely vpon confidence of his name, was elected héere Emperoure, who passing hence into France, with all the youth of Brytaine, gote all the men of warre there to take part with him.
Honorius sent therefore Sarus to withstand him, who in a foughten field slew Iustinian, Constantines Captayne, and so pursued Constantine, that he made him take Valentia, wherein he sharply beséeged him, vntill Gerentias with his Brytaines, and Edebrichus with the francks raysed the séege.
Then Constantine fortifyed the Alpes, and Rhene with Garrisons, sent Constans his sonne (whome of a Monke he had made a Caesar with a great Armie into Spayne, where he tooke, and afterward slew certayne noble personages to Honorius, and returning to his Father, left Gerontius to gouerne Spayne.
Constantius himselfe then craued pardon of Honorius for vsurping the Empire, saying, that he did it by compulsion, which when Honorius heard, he so wel liked, that he sent an Imperiall Roabe vnto him.
In these troubles, Brytaine was greatly endangered by Pictes and Scottes, and sued to Honorius for succoure, but he sending them only Letters, willed them to looke to their owne state.
Shortly after Constance, that was Monke, was slayne by Gerontius his owne Captayne, at Vienna in France: and Constantine himselfe being beséeged at Arles by Honorius Souldiers, entred into holy orders, and fled into the Church, thinking thereby to saue himselfe, but was drawen out from thence, and slayne.
Gerontius who had trayterously killed his Maister, was besette rounde aboute with Spanyards in his Lodging, wherefore he first slew Allanus his tryed friend, then Nunichia his wife, and lastly himselfe, and now Honorius recouered Brytaine.
In his time (saith Beade Rome was destroyed of the Gothes, the
yeare after it was buylded: after which time the Romanes left to rule in Britaine, after almost
The Romanes dwelt within ye french, which as we haue sayd, Seuerus drew ouerthwart ye Iland at ye South part, which thing may appeare by ye Cities, Temples, Bridges, paued stréetes to this day remayning, notwithsta~ding they had in possession, vnder their dominio~ y^ farther parts of Britaine, and also the Ilands which are about Brytaine.
By meanes (as is afore sayd) ye Romanes had vsed to tra~sport with them ouer into France the floure of al the youth of Brytaine, to serue the~ in their foraigne warres, their men of warre were consumed, was not now able to defende the~selues against the inuasions of their enimies: wherevpon many yeares togither they liued vnder the oppression of two most cruel Nations, the Scottes, Pictes, which were of ye circuite of Britaine, but deuided from the lande of Britaine by two armes of the Sea, running betwixt them, of the which one from the East Sea, the other from the Weast, runneth in farre and wide into the land, though they may one reake to the other.
In the middle of the East créeke, there is a Citie builded called Guidi.
Aboue the Weast créeke toward the right hand standeth a Citie called Alcluith, which in their language is as much to say, as the Rocke Cluith, for it standeth by a Floud of the fame name.
The Britaines then being thus afflicted by the said nations, sent their Embassadors with Letters vnto Rome, with lamentable supplications, requiring of them ayd and succour, promising them their continuall fealtie, so that they would rescue the~ against ye oppression of their enimies: wherevpon there was sent vnto them a legio~ of armed souldiers from Rome, which comming into the Iland, encountring with the enimies, ouerthrew a great number of them, draue the rest out of the frontiers of the countrey, so setting them at liberty, frée from the miserie with which they were before so gréeuously ouercharged, counselled them to make a wall betwéene the two Seas, which might be of force to kéep out their euill neyghbours: and yt done, they returned home with great triumph.
But the Britaines building y^ wall which they were bid to make, not of stone as they were willed, but of turffe, as hauing none amo~g the~ that had skil therin, made it so slender, y^
This wall they made betwene ye two said armes or créekes of the Sea, many miles long, that where the fence of the water lacked, there by the help of ye trench they might kéepe their country from y^ breaking in of their enimies, of which péece of worke, there remayneth euen vnto this day most assured tokens yet to be séene.
This trench beginneth about two miles fro~ the monastery of Abercuring, in a place which in the Pictes language is called Penuahil, and in English is called Panwell, and running out Westward, is ended by the City of Alcluith.
But the former enimies, whe~ they had once perceiued yt the Romane Legion was returned home againe, forthwith being set on land by boates, inuaded the borders, ouercame ye countrey, as it were beate downe all before the~: whervpon Embassadors be sent again to Rome, beséeching the~ they would not suffer their miserable countrey to be vtterly destroyed.
Againe, there is sent another legion, which co~ming vpon a suddaine, made a great slaughter of y^ enimies, chased the~ ouer into their own country.
Then ye Romanes told the Britaines, yt it was not their ease to take any more such trauellous iourneys for their defence, and therefore bade the~ to practise their armoure themselues, and learne to withstand their enimies.
They builded vp a Wall of hard stone from Sea to Sea, right betwéene the two Cities, whiche there were made to kéepe out the Enimie, in the selfesame place where Seuerus before had cast his Trench with publike and priuate charges: the Brytaines also putting too their helping handes, they then builded it eyght foote broade, and twelue foote high, right as it were by a line, from East, to Weast, as it doth to this day appeare, which being perfected, they giue the people straight warning to looke well to themselues, they teach them to handle their weapen, and instruct them in warlike feates.
Also by the Sea side Southward, where their Shippes lay at harbor, least their Enimies should land there aboutes, they made vp Bulwarkes along, one somewhat distant from another, and this done, bid them farewel, as minded no more to returne.
At this time almost all the treasure of Brytaine was hidde vnder ground, or transported ouer into France.
As soone as they were gone, the Scottes and Pictes hauing intelligence that they had made promise they woulde come no more, they taking heart of grace, returne agayne to their businesse: and first, all that was without the wall, they tooke for their owne.
After that, they giue assault vnto the wall, where the Britaynes were with Graples pulled downe, and otherwise so assaulted, that they leauing both the Cities and the wall also, were dispersed and put to flight, the enimies following, killed and slayed more cruelly, than euer they did before, wherevpon being driuen out of their owne houses, and possessions, they fall a robbing and spoyling one the other of them, so farre foorth, that all the whole Countrey was brought to that exigent, that they had none other sustenance, but that they gote by hunting, and killing of wilde Beastes.
THeodosius the yonger, sonne of Arcadius, succéeded his Uncle Honorius, and appoynted Valentinianus his Cousin, Emperour in the Weast partes.
At this time, Timotheus héere in Brytaine, vnder a pretence of Religion, and great continencie, drew many into a dangerous Heresie.
Chrisanthus, the sonne of Byshop Martian, a Consull of Italy, was made Uiceroy, and Lord Deputie of Britayne: he was afterward made Bishop of Constantinople.
Now the poore remnant of the Brytaines directed letters to Aetius, whereof this was the beginning: To Aetius thrice Consull, the mourning of the Brytaines.
In the processe of which Epistle, they thus set foorth their pitifull estate.
The barbarous enimie driueth vs vpon the Sea: the Sea agayne vpon the enimie: betweene these twayne riseth two manner of deathes, eyther we are killed or drowned And yet for all their suite, they could obtayne no ayde of hym, as he whiche had then both his hands full of businesse and battayle at home with Bleda and Attila, Kings of the Hunnes.
The Pelagian Heresies being brought in by Agricola, the sonne of Seuerianus, a Pelagian Bishop, about this time did fore corrupt the faith of the Brytaines, but the Brytaines béeing neither willing to receyue their lewde Doctrine, as blasphenrous againste the grace of God, neyther able to refute their wilie and wicked persuasions, they deuised this wholsome counsell, to séeke for ayde of the Bishops of France, against these their spirituall enimies.
And they calling a common counsell, consulted among themselues, whome of them all it were best to send to help their neighbours fayth.
By the assent of them all there was chosen two woorthie Prelates, Germanus Altisiodorensis, and Lupus, Bishop of the Citie Trecassa, whiche shoulde passe ouer into Britaine, to confirme them in the Faith, whiche with readie obedience, accepting the commandement of the Sinode, tooke shipping thitherward, and had prosperous windes, which set them ashore in place where they themselues desired.
Thither a great multitude of people being assembled, receyued the Priestes of God, and the word of God was preached by them, not onely in their Churches, but also in the open stréetes, and in the Countrey, in such sort, that in all places both the sound and faithfull were confirmed, and they that before swarued out of the right faith, were amended.
The Authoures and head professors of this heretical error, lay lurcking all this while, and much spited to sée the people dayly to fall from them.
After long aduisement vsed, they take vpon them to trie the matter by open disputation, which being agréed vpon, they come foorth richly appoynted, gorgeously apparelled, accompanyed with a number of flattering fauourers.
The people were present both to sée and iudge the matter.
The parties were farre vnlike of condition: on the one side was the faith, on the other mans presumption: on the one side méekenesse, on the other pride: on the one side Pelagius, on the other Christ.
First of all Germanus and Lupus gaue their aduersaries leaue to speake, which vaynely occupyed both the tyme and eares of the people with naked words, but after the reuerend Bishops poured out their words co~firmed with scriptures, out of the Gospels and Apostles.
Thus the vanitie of Heretikes was conuicted, and falsehoode confuted, so that at euery obiection, they were forced to confesse their errour, not being able to aunswere them: but after their departure, the Heresie began againe to reuiue.
Wherefore Germanus returned into Britaine with Seuerus, banished the Heretiques with banishment, and restored the faith.
THe Brytaines continued in doubtfull Warre with the Scottes and Pictes, sometime bearing away the victorie, sometime leauing it to the enimie.
But considering the ambitious minds of men, and fearing least some should vsurpe the Kingdome at home, while they were deteyned with warres abroade, thought good to appoynte ouer them some King: and so with one consent they elected Vortiger.
VOrtiger raigned in Brytaines, in whose time hunger more preuayling against the Brytaines, droue many of them to yéeld themselues vnto the hands of their enimies.
Other there were, which could neuer be brought therevnto, but from the hils and brakes where they lurked, many tymes inuaded their enimies, as trusting so much the more in the help of God, how muche the lesse hope they had of ayde of men, and by such meanes, first of all both resisted and ouerthrew them, which many yeares togither had liued by the spoyle of the Countrey, whereby for the time they drewe homeward with shame ynough, contending not long after to returne.
The Pictes then, and long time after, kept them selues quiet at home, saue onely they would now and then make inuasions into the land, and driue away booties of Cattell.
After that they drew to a quietnesse, there ensued such plentie of graine, as neuer was séene the like before, as farre as any man could remember, whereof the people grew to loose and wanton liuing, whereof all manner of lewdenesse followed, specially crueltie, hate of truth, and loue of lying, in so much, that if any were gentler and more giuen to truth than other, the other would worke him all the hurt and spite they could: this did not only the seculars, but also the Cleargie, and the heads thereof, giuing themselues ouer to drunkennesse, pride, contention, enuie, and such other, casting from them the yoke of Christ.
In the meane season a bitter plague befell among them for their corrupt liuing, consuming in short time such a multitude of people, that the quicke were not sufficient to burie the dead: and yet for all that, the remnant remayned so hardned in sinne, that neyther their friendes death, nor feare of their own, could cure the morrein of their soules, which dayly perished through their sinfull liuing: whereby a greate stroke of Gods vengeance ensued vpon the whole sinnefull Nation: for being now infested againe with their old neighbours the Scottes and Pictes, they deuised with themselues what was best to do, and where they might séeke reskue to withstand and repell the feare of the Northren nation: and they agréed all with their King Vortiger, to demand ayd of ye Saxons beyond the Seas, which thing doubtlesse (sayth Bede was done by Gods owne appoyntmente, that the people mighte be thereby plagued, as by the ende it manifestly appeared.
The people of the English or Saxons, being sent for of the sayd King into Brytaine, landed héere in thrée long Shippes, and by the Kings commandement, are appoynted to abide in the East part of the Land.
And the Isle of Thanet was giuen to them, they to defend the Countrey like friendes, but in déede, as it proued afterwarde, minding to destroy the Countrey as enimies.
Wherefore encountring with ye Northerne enimie, the Saxons had the better, whereof they sending word home into their Countrey, as also of the fruitefulnesse of the Land, the Saxons sente ouer a greater Nauie and number of men better appoynted for the Wars, which being now ioyned with the former band, drew to a stronger Armie than all the power of the Brytaines was able to ouercome.
These by the Brytaines were allowed a place to dwell among them, with that condition that they should warre for them against their enimies, for wages of the Brytaines.
These Saxons, English, and Iuits, that came from beyonde the Seas, were thrée of the strongest nations in Germany.
That is, the Saxons, English, and the Vites, or Iuites.
Of the Iuites, came the people of Kent, and the Ile of Wight, and they in the prouince of Weast Saxons, are called of Iuites, right ouer against the Ile of Wight.
Of the Saxons (that is of that Region now called old Saxons descended the East Saxons, the South Saxons, and the Weast Saxons.
Of the English, descended the Easte English, the Mercies, and the Northumbers.
The chiefe Captaines of the Saxons are sayd to haue bin two bréethren, Hingest, and Horsus: this Hingest prepared a great banquet, appoynting his Daughter Rowan as some write) to attend at the table, to the ende she might delight the Kings eye as he sate: which thing was not done in vayne, for as the King was alwayes desirous to behold the beautie of Women, so was he straight wayes taken with the beautie and elegant behauiour of this mayden, and without farther delay, desired to haue hir to his Wife, and woulde compell hir Father to consente therevnto, who in his heart was willing ynough withall, but for a subtiltie sayd nay, alleaging that so base a mariage was not méete for the King, and holding himselfe as agréeued and not willing.
All Kent was giuen him for a reward, to consent therevnto, in which countrey, all equitie and iustice was decayed, vnder gouernement of one called Gnorongus, who notwithstanding was subiect vnto Vortiger, as all the rest of the Princes of the Iland were.
For the loue that Vortiger bare to Rowayne the Saxon, he was deuorced from his lawfull Wife, by whome he had thrée sonnes, for which déede, welnéere all the Britans forsooke him.
Vodine Archbishop of London, a man of singular deuotion and good life, by the aduise of Vortimer, wente to Vortiger, and sayd to him, that he had not done as a Christian Prince, in departing from his lawfull wife, and taking another woman, whose Father was an enimie to the Christian fayth, and also wente aboute to conquere the Crowne of Britaine: Then sayde Vortiger, was not wise when brought the Saxons to help me against mine enimies, but was more vnwise, when was taken with the mordinate lust of the daughter of Hengist: knowe that mine Empire will bée terrible, except repent me with spéede and turne to God.
Hengist hearing Vortiger make this lamentation, blamed him, for that he beléeued the perswasions of a profane man, of fayned life (as he tearmed him) and forthwith slewe the good Archbishop Vodine, and many other Priestes, and Religious persons.
All the Churches in Kent were polluted with bloud, the Nunnes, with other religious persons, were by force put from their houses and goodes, and constrayned to polution of their bodies.
The Britaines considering the dayly repaire of the Saxons into this Realme, shewed to their King the ieoperdy that might thereof ensue, and aduertised him of the danger, but all was in vaine: for Vortiger, by reason of his wife, bore such fauoure to the Saxons, that he woulde in no wise heare the counsell of his subiects, wherefore, they with one minde depriued him of his royall dignitio, when he had raigned sixe yeares, ordeined to be their king Vortimere his eldest son.
VOrtimere pursued the Saxons, and by his martiall knighthoode fought against them foure battailes, besides diuers skirmishes, vntill at length he was poysoned by the meanes of his stepmother, after he had raigned vj. yeares.
The first battel, He~gest Horse fought with Wirtigerre (or Vortimer as others haue) was in a place called Aeglestrop, notwithstanding that Horse was slayne in this battell, yet Hengest caried away ye victorie.
The second battell Hengest Eske fought with ye Britaines, in a place called Crecanford.
Of the Britaines many perished by the sword, the rest of the~ abandoned Kent altogither, and with great feare fled vnto London.
The third battell Hengest Eske fought with the Britans néere vnto a place called Weppedes fleete, that is to say, ye Fleete of Wepped, where they slew xij. Dukes or Captaynes of the Britaines, with many other, where as on the part of y^
Saxons, there was one only man slaine, whose name was Wepped.
The fourth battell was fought by Hengest Eske against the Britaines, who obtaining the victory gote an innumerable spoile, in whiche battell the Britaines fledde from the Angles.
VOrtiger obteined againe the Kingdome, and shortly after Hengest, which was chased into the Ile of Thanet, entred the land with a number of Saxons, but when he hearde of the great assembly the Britaines had made against him, he treated for peace, which in fine was co~cluded.
Shortly after Hengest (by a guile which before he had deuised) bid his son in law, iij. C. of his Nobles vnto a feast or banquet, where when he had ouerlaid his guests with ouermuch Wine, he fel to quarelling, with taunting talke, pinched euery one of the~, and straight fel to fighting, wherthrough the Britaines were slaine euery one.
The King was taken prisoner, and forced to giue for his ransome, Kent, Sussex, Suffolke, Northfolke.
This murther of the Britans, was on yt plaine of Salesbury.
Then Hengest began his dominion ouer Kent, Vortiger, fled into Wales, builded there a Castel, of which building, lo~g let of ye same, and of his Prophet Merlin, Geffrey Monmouth, and others speake many things.
Great co~panies of ye Saxo~s dayly flocked into this Iland, grew so strong, y^ the people of y^
Countrey which sent for the~, stoode in great feare of their puissance, for those Saxons had taken league with the Picts, began to turne their force vpo~ the Britaines: and to be short, the fire once kindled in yt lands of the Paganes there, tooke iust reuenge of y^ wickednes of the people, raging first vpo~ the Cities Countrey next adioyning, after from the East sea to the Weast, ouerwhelming all the whole Iland without resistance: both publike priuate houses were ouerthrowne to ye grou~d: the Priests were slaine standing at the altare: the Bishops with their flocke were murthered, without respect of their dignity, nor there was any that woulde bury the slaine: some of the miserable leauings being take~ in the hilles, were there killed: other being sterued with hunger, were faine to créepe out of their caues, buy their victuall at their enimies ha~ds with sale of their libertie for euer, if yet they were not killed out of hand: other fled ouer the Seas with an heauie hearte: other tarying stil in their cou~trey in feare of death, lacke of foode, liued ful miserably in ye Mountaines, woods, Cliffes.
Aurelius Ambrose, and Vther (bréethren of Constantine yt was before slaine in France landed with a Nauie of Ships at Totnes, made war vpon Vortigerne, and buried him in his Castell in Wales, when he had secondly raigned vj. yeares.
was ordeined king of Britaine, in whose time, the Britaines by little little began to take strength and courage vnto the~, comming out of their caues in whiche they lucked before, and with one consent, calling for heaue~ly help, that they might not for euer be vtterly destroyed, they had then for their Captaine a Romane, called Ambrosius Aurelius, a gentle natured man, which only of all the bloud of the Romanes remayned then aliue (his parents being slayne) whiche bare the name of King of the Countrey.
This man being their Captayne, they assembled themselues togither, and prouoking the victors to the fighte, through Gods assistance atchieued the victorie, and from that day forward, now the men of the Countrey, now the enimie had the victorie, vntill the yeare that Bathe was beséeged; where they gaue their enimies a greate ouerthrowe, which was about the xliiij. yeare of their comming into the land: but of this we shall speake more héereafter.
This Ambrosius caused the Churches to be repaired, whiche had bin spoyled by the Saxons.
He caused the greate stones to be sette on the playne of Salesburie, whiche is called Stonehinge, in remembrance of the Britaines that were slaine and buryed there in the time of Vortiger, at the banquet and communication of Hengist with the Saxons.
Saxon named Cella, with his thrée sonnes, and a company of Saxons, landed in the South part of Britaine.
Saxon named Porth, landed with his two sonnes, Byda and Meagla, at an Hauen in after whome the Hauen is named Portesmouth.
The third Kingdome of the East Saxons, began in Britain, vnder Duke Vffa.
VTher Pendragon, so called, for that he caused alwayes a Dragon to be borne before him in his battels, was crowned King of Britaine: he vanquished Otta and Oza at Windgate by Coquet Riuer.
He was enamored vppon Igren, the Dukes Wife of Cornewall, and to obtayne his vnlawfull lust, made warre vpo~ hir husband Goilen, and slew him in battell at Duvilioc.
ARthure the sonne of Vther borne in Cornewall, at the age of fiftéene yeares was crowned King of Britaine, as some say at Caerleon, other at Winchester: one old namelesse pamflet saith at Cilicester, by Dubritius Archbishop of Legions.
This Citie of Cilicester in British is called Caier segent, and was scituate néere Reading.
It was so called, for that Constantius, the sonne of Constantine the great dyed there: his Sepulture might once haue bin séene there besides the Citie, as the Letters engranen on it in stone did declare.
He tooke to Wife Guinouer, Cousin to Cador Duke of Cornewall, and Daughter to the King of Biscay.
Of this King there be many fabulous reportes, but certayne, he was a Prince (as Malmesberie saith) more worthy to haue aduancement by true Histories, than false Fables, being the only proppe and vpholder of this his Countrey.
In the beginning of his raigne, Lotho and Conradus his allies, enuying his prosperitie, made Warre against him, but he valiantlye vanquished them with their Pictes and Scottes, at his pleasure, and appoynted them a Gouernoure named Anguisell.
He fought twelue fieldes against the Saxons, and alwayes bare away the victorie, of whiche, the last was fought at Bath, where by his owne prowesse and manhoode, he vanquished nine hundred.
Afterward he raysed the séege which the Saxons had planted about Lincolne, and slewe them in great numbers.
Thus hauing abated the rage of the Saxons, and reduced his Countrey to quietnesse, he constituted the order of the round Table, into which order, he only receyued such of his nobilitie as were most renowmed for vertue and chiualrie.
This round Table he kept in diuers places, but especially at Cairleon, Winchester, and Camalet in
There is yet to be séene in Denbigh shire, in the parish of Llansanan, in the side of a stonie hill, a place compasse, wherein be foure and twentie seates for men to sit in, some lesse, and some bigger, cut out of the maine Rocke by mans hand, where children and yong men, comming to séeke their Cattell, vse to sitte, and play: they commonly call it Arthures round Table.
So hauing established all things well at home, he with his nobilitie made an expedition into Norway, where he atchieued sundry notable, and maruellous exploytes, and subdued the same, with all the Regions thereabout, to Russia, placing the limite of his Empire in Lapland.
He caused the people of those Countreys to be Baptised, and receyne the Christian Religion.
He also obtayned of the Pope to haue Norway confirmed to the Crowne of this Realme, calling it the Chamber of Britaine.
Then sayling into France, he forced Frolo (Gouernoure there for the Romaynes to flighte, and afterward in Combate manfully slew him.
Shortly after, he addressed deadlye Warre againste Lucius Hiberus, who claymed a Tribute of Arthure for Britaine, and had assembled greate powers to ouercome Arthure, but Arthure encountring with him, after a long and bloudye fighte, discomfited his Armie, killed him, and sente his body to the Senate of Rome for the Tribute.
While Arthure was thus valiantly occupyed in his warres beyond the Seas, and had conquered thirtie Kingdomes (such as they were in those days) Mordred to whome he had committed the gouernement of Britaine, confederating himselfe with Cerdicus first King of the Weast Saxons, trayterously vsurped the Kingdome, of which treason, when relation came to Arthure, he spéedily returned into Britaine, and at Richborow néere to Sandwich, gaue battell to him, and wanne the fielde.
Anguisell of Scotland, Gawin and Cador were there slayne: then pursuing him into Cornewall, gaue him battell there agayne by the Riuer of Alaune, of some histories called Cablan, where Mordred was slayne.
And Arthure béeing deadly wounded, was conueyed to Glastenburie, where he dyed, and is buryed, after he had most victoriously gouerned this Realme sixe and twentie yeares.
COnstantine, kinsman to Arthure, and sonne to Cador Duke of Cornewall, was ordeyned King of Britayne, and raigned thrée yeares.
Thys man was by the two sonnes of Mordred gréenouslye vexed, for they claymed the Lande by the righte of theyr Father, but after many Battayles, they fledde, the one to London, the other to Winchester, whyche Cities they obteyned, and tooke them: but Constantine followed, and subdued, and tooke the foresayde Cities, and one of the yong men hée founde in an Abbey at London, and slewe hym néere the Aulter cruelly, and buried hym nigh Vter Pendragon, at Stonehinge.
The other young manne hée founde at Winchester, and slewe hym, flying into the Churche of Saincte Amphibalus.
Aurelius Conanus, a Britayne, raysed mortall warre against Constantine the King, and after sore fight slew him in the field, when he had raigned thrée yeares, and was buryed at Stonehinge.
Vrelius Conanus, Nephew to Arthure, was Crowned King of Britaine.
He cherished such as loued strife and dissention within his Realme and gaue light credence to them which accused other, were it right or wrong.
He emprisoned by strength his Uncle, whiche was right heyre to the Crowne.
The Kingdome of Northumberland began first in Britaine vnder a Saxon named Ida.

MAlgo pulcher Canonus of Northwales, beganne his raigne ouer the Britaynes, and gouerned them fiue yeares.
This Malgo was in proportion of body, greater than all the Dukes of Brytaine, but he delighted in the soule sinne of Sodomie.
He slewe his first wife, and then tooke to wife his owne brothers daughter.
This man loued ciuill Warre, and was odible both to God and to his subiects.
They moued the Saxons (being accompanied with King of Ireland to make warre vpon Careticus, in such wise, that he was sayne to take the Towne of Cicester, where they assaulted him so sore, and fired the Corne, by tying fire to the wings of Sparrowes, that he with his men fledde from thence into Wales: by whiche meanes, he lefte a great part of his dominion, and ended his life, when he had raigned thrée yeares.
This Gurmund burned vp the land of Britaine from Sea to Sea, and the more part of that Ile called Leogrea he gaue to ye Saxons.
The Britaines gaue place, and fled into the Weast parts of Cornewall, and Wales.

Peters Church at Rome.
After which time the Brytaines were called Walshmen, whiche name was giuen them by the Englishmen, or Saxons, who vsed to call all men Walshmen, that be straungers vnto them.
NOw are we come to ye time wherin God (who for ye sins of the people translateth kingdomes) dispossessed the Brytaines of theyr auntient habitation, rule of this land, who by the victorie of Saxons were enforced, eyther to miserable seruitude, or driuen into the Westerne partes of the Ile, now called Wales Cornewall, (where they now inhabite,) or else to their countrymen the Brytains in France.
But the Saxons enioying the fertile soyle of this Realme, parted it in processe of time into seuen kingdomes: Kent, Southsex, Mercia, Northumberla~d, and whych the learned call the Heptarchie of the Saxons, of which kingdomes, purpose (for auoiding of confusio~) to treat seuerally, setting down the limits of these Countries, with the succession, actes, and ciuil battayles of their pettie Kinges, vntil the time that this Heptarchie, or gouernement of seauen, was reduced to a Monarchie, or regiment of one.

And to the end he would haue acquaintance with forraine Princes, he made affinitie and alliance with the King of Fraunce by marrying of his daughter Berta, a Christian woman, to whom he permitted to vse the lawes and rytes of hir Countrey, and to haue a Bishoppe, whose name was Letardus, to remaine with hir, for hir better instruction in the lawes of GOD.

Fre~ch· and agrée to haue all one lawe and like customes: besides this, the chast and vertuous life of Letardus the Bishop, and the other French whiche came with the Quéene, chaunged the Kings minde vnto the knowledge of Christ, whereby it came to passe, that afterwards he did so sone giue place to ye preaching of Augustine.
At thys time (saith Beade the Brytaines being at quiet, little regarding the stormes paste in theyr fathers dayes, and hauing respect onely to the present prosperous éstate in the which they then liued, were so set to breake all good orders of truth and iustice, that scante anye token or remembraunce thereof remayned, but onelye in a fewe, among many other of their doings, which their own Historigrapher Gildas, doth lame~tably set forth in writing, (he sayth of them thus) that they neuer toke care to preache the Gospel of Christe vnto the Angles and Saxons, which inhabited the land among them.

For in thrée yeares before, it had not rayned in all those quarters, whereby a famine destroyed the people by heapes, in somuch that diuerse tymes fortye or fiftie in a companye, béeing famished for hunger, woulde goe togyther to some rocke or Sea bancke, and caste themselues all downe, eyther to be killed with the fal, or drowned in the Sea: but on the same day they receyued Baptisme and Faith, there fell a plentifull shoure of rayne, wherewith the Earth flourished againe.

CEadwall a valiaunt yong manne of the Weaste Saxons, being banished from hys Countrey, came wyth an hoste of men and slewe King Edilwach, wasted that prouince, cruelly murdered and spoyled euery where.
And soone after Ceadwall was driuen out by two Captaines of the Kings, Bertham and Anthun, which from that tyme dyd holde and kéepe the Dominion of that prouince: the chiefe of whyche two, was afterwarde slayne of the same Ceadwall, (being then King of the and the prouince subdued: and the latter was slaine by Ina.

VFfa the eight fro~ Woden, first king of East Angles, raigned vij. yeares.
REdwaldus the tenth from Woden, as men write: this is he that for the fauour of Edwin, killed Edelfride king of Northu~berland.
The same Redwalde was by y^ perswasion of Edwyne baptised, but after by his wiues cou~sel he fell fro~ the fayth agayn, but his sonne Dorwaldus in pure and vncorrupted Christianitie was slaine by the heathen Rochbert.
SIgebertus being broughte vp in Fraunce, when he fled the enmitie of Redwald, was there baptised, wherevpon after his retourne comming to the Crowne of the East Angles, and desiring to followe the godly order whiche he had séene in Fraunce, set vp a Schole to bring vp children, by the helpe and ayde of Byshop Felix, whom he toke out of Kent for that purpose, appointed them maisters and teachers, after the manner of Kentishmen.
This Felix in Burgonia, was made Bishop of Dunmock, now called Donwich, an auntiente Citie, sometime of great fame, gouerned by a Maior and thrée Baylifes, nowe soare decayed and wasted by the Sea: he satte Byshop xvij. yeares and was buryed at Ramsey.

ANna the sonne of Guido, succéeded Egrieks, and was lykewise slaine by the furie of Penda.
Etheldred daughter to Anna, founded the Churche of Saincte Peter in the Isle of Ely.
Athelhere brother to Anna succéeded, and bothe he and Penda were slaine by Oswinus Kyng of the Northumbers, and that deseruedly, bycause he hadde ayded Penda against his owne brother, and his kinsman.
Adelwaldus hys brother succéeded hym with like fortune, and left the Kingdom to Aldulfus, Elohwoldus and Hisberna, sonnes of the same Athelhore.
EThelbertus his sonne, whome Offa Kyng of Mercies deceitfully slewe: he was buryed at Hereforde.
Uery few men of might did raigne after him in by reason of the violence done by the Mercians, vntill S. Edmond.
EDmonde raigned xv. yeares, in whose time Hinguar and Hubba began Danes, entring the Prouince of the Northumbers, raged ouer all the same, and made great spoiles.
Hinguar hauyng gotten a great pray, left Hubba, and wyth his nauy sayled into arriued at a certaine Citie thereof vnawares to the Citizens, sette it on fire, and slue both man, woman and childe.
This wicked Hinguar tooke Edmonde King of that Prouince, in a Uillage then called Heglisdune, neare to a Wood bearing the same name, where this holy Edmond being constant in the Christian Faith, was first by the Pagans beaten wyth battes, then scourged with whips, he still calling on the name of Iesus: hys aduersaries in a rage shotte him ful of Shaftes, and then smote off his heade: after whiche time the Angles ceased to raigne in the but the same was possessed by Danes, til a fiftie yeares after, that Edward the sonne of Etheldred did expulse the Danes, and ioyned that Prouince, and also the to hys Kingdome of the

ERchenwine, the eighte from Woden, from whome all the Saxons deriued their genealogies, first erected this Countrey to a Kingdome, which neuerthelesse he held as Feodarieto the kings of Kent, who were as yet the very soueraines of the whole country fro~ Thamis to Humber.
And as we haue specified, Vortiger yéelded season to He~gest for his deliuery, when y^
Péeres of the Brytains were slain on Salisburie playn, and he taken prisoner.
SLedda the sonne of Erchenwine, succéeded his father in the gouernement, and to establishe the state more sure, married Ricula the daughter of Ermenrich King of Kent, and enioyed hys gouernemente so quietly, that he ministred small matter to Historiographers.
SEbert the sonne of Sledda by Ricula, ruled this kingdome after his father.
The seconde yeare of hys raigne, by the perswasion of Ethelbert hys vncle, and preaching of Miletus first Byshoppe of London, he embraced Christianitie, and was baptised by Miletus, and (immediately to shewe himselfe a Christian,) builte a Churche to the honour of Saint Peter, on the West side of London, in a place, whiche bycause it was ouergrowen with Thornes and enuironed wyth Waters, the Saxons at that time called it Thorney, and nowe of the Monasterie and West scituation is called Westminster.
In this place long before was a Temple of Apollo, (as Sulcardus writeth,) whyche being ouerthrowne wyth an Earthquake, Eucius builte a Churche for the Christians, Sebert (when he had raigned thirtéene yeres) dyed, and was entombed in the Church which he builte, with his wife Acthelgod, whose bodies many yeares after, in the the time of Richarde the seconde, were translated from the olde Churche to the newe at Westminster: and there enterred.
SErred, Sewarde and Sigbert, sonnes of Sebarte, ioyntly (as it séemeth) then ruled Eastsex· men wickedly giuen, irreligious, and deadely enemies to the Christian profession: who presumed contemptuouslye to the Table of the Lords Supper, beyng not Baptised: and bycause Miletus woulde not permitte them to be partakers of the Christian Sacramente, they expelled hym from his Sea at London, but shortly after Serred encountring with the West Saxons, was slaine with both his brethren by king Kinegls.
SIgebert surnamed the little, sonne of Sewarde succéeded in this kingdome, and lefte the same to Sigebert his kinsman.

Thys Cittie of Ithancester, stoode on the bancke of the riuer Pante, that runneth by Maldune in the hundered of Dansey, but now that Citie is drowned in Pante, so yt nothing remaineth but the ruines of the Citie in the sayde riuer.
In y^ good procéedings of King SIGEBERT, he was slain by a kinsman of his owne, vpon none other occasion, but for that he vsed too muche clemencie towardes his enimies, as the murtherers themselues confessed.
Swidhelin sonne of Sexbald, succéeded then in this regime~t, who was baptized by Ced in Rendlesham in

SElred (whom other call Colred peaceably after Offa raigned in Essex thirty yeares, and at length was slaine.
SVthred after Selred was slayne, raigned in Eastsex: but Egbert King of the the verye yeare that he conquered Kent, subdued also this Suthred, and annexed Essex to hys Kingdome: yet London with the Countrey confining about it, came not in subiection to the but obeyed the King of Mercia, as long as that Kingdome continued.

PEda the sonne of Penda succéeded in part of the Kingdome being preferred by the gift of Oswin, whose daughter hée had taken to wife, on condition he shoulde embrace Christianitie and forsake Idolatry.

Through yt treason of his wife he dyed sodainly, when he had raigned after hys Father.

EThelred brother to Vlferus succéeded in the kingdome of the Mercians: hée obtayned a Byshoppes Sea to be in the Citie of Worcester· Bosellus was firste Bishoppe there: Egwinus was the second.
This Egwinus, by the helpe of Kenredus King of Mercies, founded the Monasterie of Euesham, in a place then called Eouesham, of the shepherdes fielde and house, purchased by the saide Bishop.

EThelbalde raigned in continuall peace many yeares, and then by the procurement of Beruredus, was slaine of hys own subiects.
Unto this Ethelbald, Boniface, ye seco~d Bishop of Verche in Holland, after Archbishop of Mens vpon the Rijne, an English ma~born, who was afterward martyred, sent an Epistle, of the whiche will here sette downe a péece to be séene, for that it sheweth partlye the state of that time, and serueth for example in time to come.
TO his most deare Lorde, and to be preferred in the loue of Christ aboue all other kings of England, Edbaldus, Boniface Archbishoppe, the Germaine legate, perpetual helth of charitie loue in Christ.
We acknowledge before God that we did reioyce to heare of your prosperitie, your Faith and good workes: and we be sory when we heare any thing that goeth against you, eyther in successe of warre, or in danger of your soule, for we haue heard, that you forbid thefte and robbery, that you loue peace, defende the widowe and the poore, for the which we giue God thanks: but in that you refuse lawfull marriage, which if it were to the preferring of chastitie, it were co~mendable: and sith you wallow in leacherie and adultery with Uirgins consecrate to God, it is both shamefull and damnable, for it doth confounde your renowme, bothe before God and man, placing you among Idolators, bicause you violate the temple of God.
Wherfore my deare sonne repent, and remember how filthy a thing it is, that thou who by the gifte of GOD raygnest ouer so many nations, shouldest to the great displeasure of GOD, make thy selfe a bonde slaue to thyne owne fleshly lust.
Wée haue hearde also that the more parte of noble men and people of the Mercians, by thyne euill example haue left theyr lawfull wiues, and haue defiled the wiues of other, and also Uirgins, whiche howe farre it differeth from all good order and honestie, let the lawes of straunge nations touche you: for in the auntient Countrey of the Saxons (where was no knowledge of God) if eyther a mayde in hyr fathers house, or being married to an husband, were become an aduoutresse, she shoulde be strangled by hir own hande closed to hyr mouth, and the corrupter shoulde be hanged vpon the pitte where the aduoutresse was buryed.
If shée were not so vsed (hyr garmentes being cutte awaye downe to the the chaste matrones dyd scourge and whip hyr, and pricke hyr wyth kniues, and so was sent from Towne to Towne, where other freshe and newe scourgers or whippers did méete and whippe hir, vntyll they hadde killed hyr.
Likewise the Womedeans, who are the moste vncleane kinde of people, hadde thys manner of vsage wyth them, that the husbande beyng deade, the woman togyther wyth the deade bodye shoulde caste hyr selfe headlong into the fiered stacke or pile of woodde prepared for the burning of theyr bodyes.
If therefore the Gentiles (not knowing GOD) hadde so greate zeale to chastitie, howe muche the more (my deare sonne) it is to be required at thy handes, who arte a Christian and a King.
Haue therefore compassion of thyne owne soule, and spare the greate number of people, that by thy Fatherlye· example yet may beware to offende God, for whose soules thou shalt giue an accompte.
Consider also, that if the Englshe nation, despising lawfull matrimonye, doe encrease by aduoutrye, (as the Frenche men, Italians, and also the verye Pagans do caste in our téeth and vpbrayde vs withall,) of suche coniunctions and copulations, shall spring vppe a peakishe dasterdely people, which shall despise God, wyth theyr wicked qualities vndoe the Countrey, as it came to passe to the Burgundians, the people of Prouance, and the Spaniardes, whom the Sarazens haue many yeares assaulted for theyr sinnes whiche in times past they had committed.
Besides this, it is told vs, that you take away priuileges of Churches, and thereby giue euill example to your noble men to do the like, but praye you remember howe terrible vengeaunce God toke vppon the Kings your predecessours, whiche committed suche offences as we rebuke you for.
wicked spirit came vpon Colredus your predecessoure, whiche was a defiler of Uirgins, and a breaker of ecclesiasticall Priuileges, for sitting royally among his barrons at a dinner, the Diuell plucked away his soule without confession of his sinnes.
Osredus king of the Northumbers, whiche was guiltie of the same crimes, that with a vile death he loste both kingdome and life in his lusty yong age.
Also Charles king of Fraunce whiche ouerthrewe Churches, and altered the Churche money to hys owne vse, was consumed with a long torme~t and fearefull death.
It followeth therefore my deare beloued sonne, that with Fatherlye and earnest prayers we beséeche you that you will not despise the Counsel of your Fathers which diligently do admonishe your highnesse, for nothing is more commodious to a good king, than willinglye to amend such faultes when he is warned of them, as Salomo~ sayth, who so loueth discipline, loueth wisdome: therfore my déere son, declaring our aduice, we beséech you by the liuing God, by his sonne Jesus Christ our Lord, and by hys holy spirit, that you will remember how transitorie this present life is, and howe shorte and momentane the pleasure of this filthie fleshe is, and how vile and shamefull a thing it is, that man shall leaue euill examples vnto his posteritie for euer: beginne therefore to frame your life in better wayes, and amend the errors of your youth, that you may obtayne prayse with men in this life, and eternall glorie in the life to come: we wish your Highnesse well to fare, and to encrease in all goodnesse.
Ethelbald was slayne at Secgeswald, and was buryed at Hrependune.

This woman thought not that it had bin K. Aelfred, who had made so many battels against the Danes, and gotte~ so manye victories.
For God did not onely vouchsafe to giue him victorie ouer his enemies, but also to be wearied of the~ in the sight of his owne people, to the ende he should knowe there is one God of all, to whom all knées shall bow, and in whose hands the hearts of kings consisteth.

And after that he had by battayle conquered Scotlande: hée made one Constantine king of Scottes vnder him, adding this Princely word, that it was more honoure to hym to make a King, than to be a King.
He made seuen coyning mintes at Canturburie, foure for the King, two for the Archbishoppe, and one for the Abbot: at Rochester.

ELdrede succéeded Edmunde his brother: for hys sonnes Edwyne and Edgar were thoughte too yong to take on them so great a charge.
He tooke on him but as protector, but afterwardes he was crowned at Kingstone.
This Eldred had the earnest fauour of the commons, bycause he was a great maintayner of honestie, and also most abhorred naughty and vnruely persons: for his expertnesse in feates of armes, he was much commended, whereby he quieted and kepte in due obeysaunce the Northumbers and Scottes, and exiled the Danes.
He placed the Bishoppe of Cornewal at Saint Germaines, where it continued tyll the time of Edward, nexte before the conquest, in whose time it was translated to Excester.

For whyche acte, and for bannishing Dunstane, he became odible to hys subiectes: and of the Northumbers, and people of middle Englande, that rose against him, was depriued, when he had raigned four yeres.
He dyed and was buried in the new Abbey of Winchester.
EDgar the peaceable, brother to Edwyne, was crowned at Bathe.

He chastised ye great negligence, couetousnesse and vicious liuing of the clergie, and broughte them to a better order.

King Edgar raigned sixetéene yere, was buried at Glastenburie By his first wife Egelslede (as some doe write) or by a religious votarie, as some other doe write, he hadde issue Edward surnamed the martyr, who succéeded after his Father.
Of his wife Elfrith daughter to Ordgarus, Duke of Deuonshire, he receyued another son named Ethelrede, a daughter named Wolfrith.
EDward the sonne of Edgar was crowned at Kingstone by y^ handes of Dunstan Archbishoppe of Canturburie, and Oswalde Archbishoppe of Yorke.
This man might well be compared to his Father for his and gentlenesse, so that he was worthyly fauoured of all men, except onely of hys stepmother, and other of hir aliaunce, whyche euer bare a grudge against him, for so muche as she desired to haue y^ gouernaunce of the realme for hir owne sonne Ethelred.
This Edward while he was hu~ting in a forest (by cha~ce) lost his companie, and rode alone to refresh himselfe at the Castell of Corffe, where by Counsayle of his stepmother Elfrede, he was traytorouslye murthered· as he satte on hys horsse, when he had raigned thrée yeares.
Elphred did after take great penaunce, and builded two monasteries of Nuns, Almesburie Warwel: in which Warwel the after liued a solitarie life till she dyed.
ETheldrede commonly called Unready, the sonne of King Edgar, by his seconde wife Elphrede, was crowned at Kingstone.
But bycause he came to the Kingdome by wicked meanes, and by killing his brother, he coulde neuer get the good wyll of the people, who had conceyued an ill opinion of hym: of thys arose ciuill warres within the Realme, and often dissention and discordes, as well of the Nobles as of the common sort.
a great part of the Citie of London was brent, which Citie at this time had most building from Ludgate towarde Westminster: and little or none where the harte of the Citie is nowe: except in diuerse places was housing that stoode without order: so that manye Cities, as Canturburie, Yorke, and other in Englande, passed London in building: but after the Conquest it encreased, and nowe passeth all other.

Galleys came vp to London, whiche they attempted to breake into, and to set on fire, but they were repulsed, not without their greate detriment and losse by the Citizens, wherevppon they being driuen with furie, leauing London, set vpon Eastsex and Kent, by the sea coastes, brent Townes, and wasted the fields, without respect of sex or age killed al· wasted with fire sword al what they may not carry away.
King Etheldred caused al the Danes in England to be slayne, vpon the day of Saint Brice.
The same yeare Spote founded a Monasterie at Burton vppon Trent.
Swayn King of Denmark with agret army inuaded Engle~d with fire and sword.
they fought a great battell at against Vlfekettel Carle of
Archbishoppe Elfegus woulde not yéelde to them he was first imprisoned there, after carried to Grenewiche, and there stoned to deathe.
Christes Churche is spoyled and brent: the Monkes with all other men are nine of euery ten being put to death, the tenth suffered to liue in miserie: the number of them that were left aliue was four Monkes, and of lay people eight hundred, so that y^ number slaine was
poundes, and at the last after diuerse ouerthrowes giuen to the me~ of this Iland, they possessed the same, and putte king Etheldred to flight, constrayning him to liue in exile among the Norma~s.
This Etheldred had two wiues, Ethelgina an Englishe woman, and Emma a Norman: of the first he had two childre~, of which sauing of Edmonde who succéeded hym in the kingdome, it were nothing to our purpose to speake.
Of the seco~d that was Emma, sister to Richard Duke of Normandie, there were borne two sonnes, to witte, Edward and Alured.
And that do here (contrarie to that is commonly vsed·) set Edward before Alured as elder brother, am moued therevnto by no smal aucthoritie, which haue taken out of the historiographers of that age, out of Gemeticensis· a most writer of Genealogies, and one other author, who in hys Commentarie written in praise of Emma the Quéene, affirmeth that Edwarde was the elder brother, whom doe the better beléeue, bycause it is not like, that he séeing the things wyth his eyes, shoulde mistake the matter, especiallye writing to the Quéene, who was mother to them both.
Swanus in the meane time subdued al Englande, and the people for feare yelded vnto hym on euery side, ouer whome most cruelly he tryumphed.
But not long after he departed this life at Geynesburge and left Canutus his sonne, successour in the Kingdome.
Etheldrede hearing that Swanus was dead, leauing in Normandie with Duke· Richard his sisters sonne, Emma his wife, and the children that he hadde by hyr, returned with al spéede into Englande with Edmunde his sonne by hys firste wife, being then at ma~s state, by the trustinesse of his own men, and the ayde of the Normans, moued warre against his enimie.
Canutus finding himselfe vnable to matche with him, went into Denmarke, minding to returne hither immediatly againe.
Etheldred being contrarie to his expectation thus restored to his kingdome, shewed great crueltie vpon the Danes that remained in England, sparing neither man nor woman, yong nor old.
Therefore Canutus being very desirous to reuenge the same, prepared a new armie, and came into England against Etheldred with al spéede he could, raging wide and side with fire and sword.
Etheldred in the meane season, whether by sicknesse or for sorrow, dyed, when he had raigned eight and thirtie yeares, and was buryed in the North Ile of Paules Church in London aboue the high Aulter.
EDmond the sonne of Etheldred by his first wife, succéeded in the Kingdome, who (whether it were for the greate strength of his body, or for that he alwayes vsed to go in armour) was surnamed Ironside.
He had sixe battels against Canutus King of the Danes at Penham hard by Gillingham in Dorcetshire.
He put the Danes to flight after that at Shirestone.
He held euen hand with them in the field, notwithstanding that the Englishmen at the first beganne to flée, by the policie of Edricus Duke of Lincolne, and of Merce, who cryed runne away wretches, Edmond your King is slayne.
After this, King Edmond came to London, to deliuer the Citizens, whome part of the enimies had beséeged as soone as he was gone from thence.
He had made a ditch also round about the Citie, where the Riuer of Thamis doth not runne.
The Danes fléeing, the King followed them, and passing ouer Brentford, he vanquished them with a notable victorie.
The rest of ye Danes which remayned with Cnute (whiles Edmond rested him, and set his matters in order) did againe beséege London, both by water and by lande, but the Citizens stoutely withstoode, and repulsed them, wherefore they shewed their anger vpon the Countrey of the Mercies, spoyling Townes and Uillages with robbery, burnings, and murther, and caryed their pray to the Shippes whiche they had gathered togither in the Riuer of Medway, which runneth by Rochester, from whence they were driuen by the King, who taking the foorde of Brentford before them, put them to flight, and slew a great number of them.
The sixt and last battell was at Essendone in Essex, néere to Rochford, in which battell Edmond had gote the victorie, but Edrike agayne playing the Traytor, greate slaughter of the Englishmen was made, there the honor of Englande was ouerthrowen, and Edmonde wente almost alone on foote to Glocester, where hée gathered a newe force to set vpon his enimies, but Cnute pursued him as he fledde, and hauing prepared their armies, both the Kings themselues attempted to fight hand to hand for the right of the kingdome in the Ile of Olania in Seuerne, in the which Combate, they both being wéeryed, fell to a couenant to deuide the same, so that the one halfe of the Kingdome shoulde be vnder Canutus, and the other halfe vnder Edmond, which Edmond not long after dyed at Oxford, whereas it is saide he was slayne by the treason of Edrike of Straton, and was buryed at Glastenbury, leauing Edmonde and Edwarde his children very yong.
This Edrike was not long vnrewarded according to his desertes, for hymselfe making vaunt thereof vnto Canutus, then being at Baynardes Castell in London, sayde in this wise, Thus haue done Canutus for the loue of thée, to whome he answered, saying: and thou shalt dye as well thou art woorthy, bycause thou art giltie of Treason against God and me, in that thou hast slayne thine owne Lord and King, which was ioyned to me in league as a Brother, his bloud be vpon thine owne head: and straight wayes, least there should be any tumulte, the Traytor was in the same Chamber tormented to death with firebrands and linkes, and then his féete being bounde togither, he was drawne through the Stréetes of the Citie, and cast into a ditch, called Houndes ditch, for that the Citizens there cast their dead Dogges, and such other filth, accompting him woorthy of no better buriall.
CAnutus the Dane, taking an occasion, bycause in the couenant that was co~cluded concerning ye deuiding of the Realme, no assurance was made for the Children of Edmond, he chalenged all England to himselfe alone by law as they call it, of growing to, which was a most easie thing for him to do, bycause there was no man that durst erect himselfe as patrone to defend the childrens right and title, and by this suttle and craftie interpretation of the couenant: the Dane gote the Monarchie of England and slew the brother of Edmond, and conueyed the children farre away out of England, least they should at any time be brought againe and receiue their right.
Some say, they were sent to a certayne man that was a Prince in Swethland, there to be dispatched out of the waye: and that the Prince vnderstanding they were Kings children, spared them, co~trarie to the credit and trust that was committed vnto him: which appeareth to be true, in that the same foraigne Lord kept and brought vppe the children honourablye, the yongest of whiche whose name was Edwarde, did afterwardes marrie Agatha, the daughter of Henry the fourth, Emperour of Rome, of whome he had many children, of whiche we shall speake héereafter.
And the other, which was ye elder brother, whose name was Edmond, dyed without children.
In the meane season Canutus, bycause he had no heire that lawfully might succéede him in his kingdome (for Harold Swaine were begotte~ of a Concubin) partly that he might establish in time to come the kingdome that he had gotten vnto his owne kindred yt came by lawfull succession: and partly that he might purchase to himselfe the friendship of the Englishmen, and of the Normans, procured to haue giuen him in marriage Emma, the widow of King Etheldred, who at that time was with Edward and Alured hir sonnes in exile with Duke Richard in Normandy, whiche mariage séemeth to be made euen by Gods prouidence, who had determined to restore the common wealth in England, whereby, as by the law and title of recouerie, and returne out of exile, the monarchie of all England, which the Danes had taken from the Englishmen, and had possessed sixe and twentie yeares and more, did returne againe to the Englishmen that were the right heires.
For Emma concluded mariage with the Dane, vpon condition that the Kingdome of England should remayne vnto none other but to the Children that were begotten of hir, if any of them did remaine aliue: by reason of this mariage, shortly after she did beare Canutus a sonne of his owne name, commonly called Hardycanutus.
This second name was giuen him bycause of his great courage, like as his brother Harold was named Harefoote, that is to say, lightfoote, bycause of his notable swiftnesse of foote.
By this affinitie and aliance, the Danes became of the more strength and power.
He kept Englishmen in his seruice so long as he liued.
He subdued the Scottes whereby he was King of England, Scotland, Denmarke, and Norway.
After that, he went to Denmarke, and so to Rome, and returned againe into England, where he kept good iustice all his life, and did many charitable déedes.
He founded the Monasterie of Saint Edmondesbury, restoring the donation which Edmond King of the West Saxons had giuen to Saint Edmund the King and Martyr, who lyeth there buryed.
He appoynted to be King of Norway Swanus his sonne (as was sayde) by Alfgine daughter to Althelme Duke of Northampton, and his Lady Vulfrune: but other said, he was a Priests sonne &c.
He also appoynted his sonne Hardycanutus by Emma, to be King of Denmarke, and deceassed at Shaftesburie when he had raigned twentie yeares, and was buried in S. Swithens at Winchester.
HArold for his swiftnesse called Harefoote whome Canutus had by a Concubine Alice of Hampton, a Shomakers daughter (affirming himselfe to be sonne of Canutus and Alfgina the Earle of daughter) slept not vppon the occasion and oportunitie offered, but vsing the force of the Danes that dwelt in England, inuaded the Realme, while his brother Hardycanute gouerned in Denmarke.
He tooke from his mother in law Emma, the most parte of the riches and treasure that Canute his father had left hir, and then with consent of the great Lords began to raigne, but not so mightily as his Father Canutus did, for a more iust heire Hardycanutus was looked for, wherevpon the Kingdome was deuided, the North part to Harold, and the South to Hardycanute.
Edward and Alfred sonnes to King Ethelred, with many Knightes, came out of Normandy, to sée their mother at Winchester, whiche sore troubled the mindes of many greate men, who bare more fauour to King Harold.
Especially Godwine Earle of Kent, feigning to receiue Alfred as a friend, came to méete him, but in the end put him in prison, parte of his companye he put in fetters, and after put out their eyes.
Of some he caused their skinne to be plucked ouer their eares, chopping off their hands and féete.
Some he commanded to be solde, and diuers were murthered at Gilforde.
Quéene Emma hearing of this dealing, she sent hir sonne Edward backe againe into Normandy.
After this, Alfride was conueyed to the Ile of Eely, where his eyes being firste plucked out, he was deliuered to the Monckes to be kept prisoner there, where shortly after hée departed this life, and was buryed in the South Ile of the West part of the Church.
Bycause Hardycanutus delayed to come ouer being sent for, he was vtterly reiected, and Harold, who before was King of the Mercies and Northumbers, was chosen King of all England, who shortly after expelled his mother in law Emma out of the Realme.
He raigned thrée yeares, dyed at Oxford, and was buryed at Westminster, and after at Saint Clements without Templebarre at London.
HArdycanutus the lawfull begotten sonne of Canutus and Emma as soone as he had gotten his fathers Kingdome, fetched home his mother out of exile: and in reuenge of displeasure that was done to hir, and of the murther of his brother Alured, he commanded the carkas of Harold to be digged out of the earth, and to be throwen into the Riuer of Thamis, where by a Fisher it was taken vp, and brought to the Danes, who buryed it in a Church yard, which they had at London.
Which done, the King appoynted eyght markes to be payde to euery Sayler in his name, twelue markes to euery Pilote or Maister, which tribute was to be payd of al England, so gréeuous, that scarce any was able to beare it.
Shortly after, he sent for Edward the sonne of Etheldred, his brother of the mothers side, to come into England, and embraced him with all loue and fauour.
Being at a mariage feast pleasantly drincking with the Bride other persons, in the middest of his cups he fell suddaynely downe to the ground so remaining dumbe, departed this life the third yeare of his raigne, was buried by his father at Winchester.
EDward borne at Islip besides Oxford, the sonne of Etheldred, whom Hardycanutus had sent for into England, was Crowned at Winchester.
This Edward for his excelle~t holynesse, is vntill this day called Saint Edward who so soone as he had gotten his fathers kingdome, of his owne frée will released the tribute of
pound, called Dane gelt, which the English people, euen from the very beginning of the reigne of the Danes, was compelled to pay to their Kings euery yeare.
He was also the chiefe author and cause, that the law which we call the common Law, was first brought vp, being gathered togither out of the lawes and ordina~ces of four nations, which were receiued when the Island was subiect to diuers regiments gouernances, to witte, of the Mercies, of the West Saxons, of the Danes, of the Northumbers.
He was hard to his mother, bycause she was hard to him in his minoritie, and also suspected with Alwine Bishop of Winchester, whome he put in prison, by counsell of Roberte Archbishop of Canturbury: but after his mother had purged hirselfe, Alwine was deliuered, and Robert the Archbishop conueyed himselfe out of England.
He tooke to wife Edgitha, the daughter of Earle Godwine, who bycause she brought him forth no children, neyther was there any hope that she should beare any, whe~ he did sée that many did gaye after y^ kingdome, he began to be carefull for one that should iustly succéede him, and therfore following the reason of y^ commo~ law, he sent for home into England his Nephew Edward, the sonne of king Edmond his brother, who by reason of his lo~g absence out of the Countrey, was co~monly called ye outlaw.
This is that Edward, the sonne of King Edmond surnamed Ironside, which remained aliue, whome Canutus when he had gotten England, had sent into Swethen with his brother.
Uncle, came againe into England, and brought with him Agatha his wife, Edgar, Margaret and Christian his children, borne in Panonia, in hope of the kingdome, where he liued but a while.
Thus S. Edward being disappoynted, both of his Nephew and his heire, for that Edward the outlaw was both by néerenesse of bloud, and by lawfull succession right heire vnto the Kingdome, withoute delaye pronounced Edgar the outlawes sonne, and his greate Nephew, to bée heire of the Kingdome, and gaue him to surname Adeling, which name in those dayes was peculiar onely to Kings Children, which were borne in hope and possibilitie of the Kingdome: for thys worde Adeling, in the English tong, is as much to say, as Prince, or Lorde, the contrary of which word is· Vnderling, that is to say, a seruanor or bondman: or according to the Walche spéech, Adeling signifieth heire: but bycause this Edgar was but yong of yeares, and within age, by his testamente he made Harold the sonne of Godwine (a stoute man both in warre and peace) Regent, vntill the yong Edgar should be of age to receyue the Kingdome, and that then he should be made King: which thing Harold with a solemne oth promised to sée so performed and done.
Notwithstanding, he like a Traytour (by force of armes) immediately after y^ death of Edward, refused the name of Regent, and pronounced himselfe King, whiche thing shortly after brought destruction both to himselfe, and to all England.
Eustace Earle of Bullogne, which had to wife Goda, sister to King Edward, arriued at Douer, where one of his men quarelling aboute his lodging, slewe one of the Townesmen, in reuenge whereof, not only the quareller, but other of his company, and many of the Towne were slayne, whiche doing so muche offended Godwine Earle of Kent, that he assembled a great power, wherewith he marched toward Glocester, where the king then lay, vnto whome he sent messengers to denounce warre, except he would deliuer Eustace and his fellow Normans and Bolognians, which held a Castell in the dominions of Kent.
After this, Godwins armie entered into Glocester, but it was there agréed, that at a day appoynted, the King and Earle Godwine should méete at London: and thus departing for the time, the King increasing his armie, ledde the same to London, and Godwine with his power came to Southwarke on the other side of the Riuer Thamis: but there bycause his armie by little and little stipped from him, he fledde, and the King forthwith pronounced him, with his fiue sonnes, to be banished, who straightwayes with his wife, and two of his sonnes came to Thorney, where his Shippe being laden with Golde, Siluer, and precious things, he sayled towarde Flanders: his other sonnes tooke Shippe at Bristow, and sayled into Ireland.
In the next yeare, Harold and Leofwine, sonnes to Earle Godwine, returning out of Ireland, entred Seuerne, arriued with many Shippes in Somerset and Dorsetshires, spoyled many Townes in the Countrey, slew many people, and returned with pray, then they sayle about Portesmouth. &c. Earle Godwine landed in Kent, gathered a power, sayled to the Ile of Wight, wasting along the Sea coastes, till his sonnes Harold and Leofwine came with a Nauy, which being come togither, they take their course vp the Riuer of Thamis, came to Southwarke, and there stayed for the Tide, and then weyed vp Anchor, and finding none that offered to resist them on the Bridge, they sayled vp by the South side of the Riuer, and his armie by land, placing it selfe vppon the banckes side, made shew of a thicke and terrible battayle.
After this, the Nauie turned toward the North shore, as though it would haue compassed in the Kings Nauie: but they that were with the King, and with Godwine, abhorred to fight againste their owne kindred and Countreymen, wherefore a peace was made, Godwine with his sonnes were restored to all former honor, and the Normans were banished the land.
As William of Malmesbury writeth, a certayne yong woman being terribly diseased, by reason of humors gathered about hir necke into great swelling kernels, came to King Edward, who with his right hand dipped in water, handled hir necke, and forthwith ye hardnesse did breake, the wormes with the matter ranne out, and all the noysome dwelling asswaged, so that she was perfectly hole, and faire skinned ere the wéeke were ended: and they that knewe his life, sayd, he had oft cured this plague in Normandy.
This Edward raigned thrée and twentie yeres, sixe monethes, and odde dayes.
He was buryed on the day of the Epiphanie, in the Abbey of Saint Peeter in Westminster which he had newly builded.
In the same day Harold the eldest sonne of Godwine Earle of Kent, and brother to Edgitha the Quéene, hauing obteyned fayth of the nobilitie, tooke the Crowne.

But in the meane season England began to be tossed and turmoyled with warres within and without: for the disheriting of the right heire is alwayes wont to be the beginning of ciuill warres.
day of Aprill, a Comete appeared, not only to the people of this land, but also in other parts of the world seauen dayes.
Toftus enuying (as men said) the prosperitie of his brother, stirred vp troubles in the Realme, for he ioyning himselfe to Harold the King of Norway, assaulted England in warlike sort, both by sea and land.
Whose attempt whiles Harold of England prepared to withstand, William Duke of Normandy, who notwithsta~ding he was a Bastard, was of kinne to Saint Edward in the thirde and fourth degrée of consanguinitie, séeing a conuenient time and occasion offered to take the Kingdome in, gathered a Nauie of
Shippes, and came into England with a very well appoynted armie, alledging, that by all right and title it was due to him, by the gift of King Edward his kinsman, and also by the couenant that was made, and by othe established betwixt Harold and him.
Harold notwithstanding he was bare of men, by reason of the battel that he had fought against Toftus, and the men of Norway, yet hearing of Williams comming, wente straightwayes againste him.
Both armies being broughte into aray, the battell was fought, wherin great slaughter of Englishmen was made, and the Normans gote the victorie, especially by meanes of their wodden bowes and arrowes (which the Englishmen had not then in vse) for Duke William commanded his men, that some of them should shoote directly forwarde, and some vpward, by reason whereof, the arrow shot vpward, destroyed the English as they stouped, and the arrow shot directly afore hand wounded them that stoode vpright: and King Harold himselfe (valiantly fighting) was shotte through the braynes, whereof he dyed, when he had raigned nine monethes, and was buryed in the Priorie of Waltham which he had founded.
This battell was fought at Hastings in Sussex, vppon the fourtéenth day of October being Saterday, in the yeare of oure Lord
This was (saith Mathew Paris the dolefull destruction of this swéete and pleasant land, the Kings whereof (meaning the Saxons at their firste comming, with barbarous countenance and gesture, in warlike sort, prouoked all men to malice and hatred towards them, who ouercame al men by warre and subtiltie: but after they had receyued the Christian faith, and by little and little applyed their diligence vnto Religion, they neglected the exercise of armour, for the Kings did change their habite, and some at Rome, and some in their owne Countrey, sought to change their temporall Kingdomes for euerlasting Kingdomes: and many which all their life time embraced worldly things, did yet distribute their treasures vnto all the workes of mercy: but afterwards when charitie waxed colde, all their studie and trauaile of Religion slaked, and then came the destruction of the inhabitants: first at the comming of the Danes, and now in the expulsing of the Englishmen by the Normans: for the noble men giuing themselues to gluttonie and lecherie, did not goe to the Church in the morning as Christian men vse to doe, but lying in their Chambers dalying with Women, did heare the Priest hastilie rattle vp diuine seruice.
The Clerkes also that had taken orders, if one had learned but his Grammer, euery one wondered at him.
All men generally gaue themselues to drinking and gulling, and spent both day and night in such exercises till they vomited.
The Saxons ware their garmentes to the midde knée, their heare rounded, and their beardes shauen (all saue the ouerlip) their armes adorned with golden bracelets, and their skinne paynted and printed.
Thus endeth the Reigne of the Saxons, who were first sent for by Vortiger, about the yeare of our Lord.

thousand sixe and sixtie yeare it vvas, as vve do reade, When that a Comete did appeare, and Englishmen lay dead: Of Normandie Duke William then to Englandvvard did sayle, And conquerde Harold vvith his men, and brought this Land to bale.
[Figure: WIlliam Duke of Norman die, surnamed Conquerour, Bastarde sonne of Robert the sixte, Duke of that Duchie, and Coosin germane vnto King Edward on the mothers side, beganne his dominion ouer the Realme of England, the fourtéenth day of October, being Saterday, in the yeare of our Lord
After the battayle at Hastings, Duke William came to London, where with great ioy he was receyued, both of the Cleargie and people, and was proclaymed King.
When the Citie of London was thus yéelded vnto him, he tooke his iourney towardes the Castell of Douer, to subdue that, and the rest of Kent also: which when the Archbishop Stigand, and Egelsin the Abbot of Saint Augustines (being as it were the chiefest Lords and gouernours of all Kent did perceyue and consider, that the whole Realme was in an euill state, and that whereas in this Realme of England, before the comming of the foresayd Duke William there were no bondmen, now all, as well noble men, as the common people, were without respect made subiecte vnto the perpetuall bondage of the Normans, taking an occasion by the perill and danger that their neighbors were in, to prouide for the safegard of themselues and their Countrey, they caused to assemble at Canterbury all the people of the Countie of Kent, and declared to them the perils and dangers imminent, the miserie that their neighbours were come into, the pride and insolencie of the Normans, and the hardnesse and griefe of bondage and seruile estate: wherevpon all the people rather choosing to end their vnfortunate life, than to submit themselues to an vnaccustomed yoke of seruitude and bondage, with a common consent determined to méete Duke William, and to fight with him for the laws of their Countrey.
And y^ foresayd Stigand the Archbishop, and the Abbot Egelsin, choosing rather to die in battell, than to sée their nation in so euill an estate, being encouraged by the examples of the holy Machabees, became Captayne of the armie.
And at a day appoynted, all the people met at Swanescombe two miles west from and being hidden in the woods, lay priuily in wayte for the comming of the foresayd Duke William.
And bycause it can not hurt to be very wary in such cases, they agréed before hande, that when the Duke was come, and the passages on euery side stopped, to the end he should no way be able to escape, euery one of them, as well Horsemen as footemen, should beare boughes in their hands.
The next day after, whe~ the Duke was come into the fields and territories néere vnto Swanescombe, and saw all the Countrey set and placed round about him, as it had bin a stirring mouing wood, and that with a meane pace they approched and drewe néere vnto him, with great discomfiture of mind he wondered at that sight.
And as soone as the Captaynes of the Kentishmen sawe that Duke William was enclosed in the middest of their armie, they caused the trumpets to be sounded, their banners to be displayed, and threw downe their boughes, and with their bowes bent, their swords drawne, and their speares and other kinde of weapons stretched forthe, they shewed themselues readie to fight.
Duke William and they that were with him, stoode (as no maruell it was) sore astonied, and amazed, and he which thought that he had already all England fast in his fist, did now dispaire of his owne life.
Therefore on the behalfe of the Kentishmen were sent vnto Duke William the Archbishop Stigand, and Egelsin Abbot of Saint Augustines, who told him their message in this sort: My Lord Duke, behold the people of Kent commeth forth to méete you, and to receiue you as their liege Lord, requiring at your hands the things which pertayne to peace, and that vnder this condition, that all the people of Kent may enioy for euer their antient liberties, and may for euermore vse the lawes and customes of the Countrey, otherwise they are ready presently to bidde battell to you, and them that be with you, and are minded rather to die héere altogither, than to departe from the lawes and customes of their Countrey, and to submit themselues to bondage, whereof as yet they neuer had experience.
The Duke séeing himself to be driuen in such a straight and narrow pinch, consulted a while with them that came with him, prudently considering, that if he should take any repulse or displeasure at the hands of this people, which be the key of England, all that euer he had done before, should be vndone againe, and of no effect, and all his hope and safetie shoulde stande in danger and ieopardy: not so willingly as wisely he granted the people of Kent their request.
So when the couenant was established, and pledges giuen on both sides, the Kentishmen being ioyfull, conducted the Normans (who also were glad) vnto Rochester, and yéelded vp to the Duke, the Earledome of Kent, and the noble Castell of Douer.
Thus the antiente liberties of Englande, and the lawes and customes of the Countrey, whiche before the comming of Duke William out of Normandy, were equally kept throughout all England, do (through this industrie and earnest trauell of the Archbishop Stigand and Egelsin Abbot of Saint Augustines remayne inuiolably obserued vntill this day, onely in the Countie of Kent.
After this, Duke William wasted Sussex, Hampshire, Southery, Middlesex, and Hertfortshire, not ceassing to burne Townes, and sley the people, till he came to Barkehamsteed, where the Archbishop Alredus, Wolstan Bishop of Worcester, Wilferus Bishop of Hereford, Clito Edgar, the Earles Edwine and Morcare, and euery one of the noble men about London came to him, and giuing pledges, submitted themselues, and sware fealtie to him, with whome also he made a league, neuerthelesse permitted his army still to burne Townes, and to take spoyles.
There was at that time an Abbot of Saint Albons called Fretherike, who hearing of the comming of Duke William into Hartfordshire, caused the woods betwixt London and Saint Albons to be felled, that no man could eyther ride or go that way for them: and thus the Abbot kept his Monasterie, that Duke William might not come there, but was fayne to coast ouer to the Castell of Barkehamsteede, who there, vnder suretie, sent for Frederike Abbot of Saint Albons, and demanded of him why such felling of woods was made about him, more than in other places: Frederike answered and saide, if the Spirituall men through this land had done their indeuour, it shoulde not haue bin in thy power to haue entred the land so farre: for the Spiritualtie is of great power.
Duke William answered, and may liue and reioyce, shall loose their power, and make it lesse, and specially will beginne with thée.
The Abbot thought he had said too farre, and (as soone as he might) departed home, called a Chapiter of his bréethre~, tolde them of Duke William, tooke his leaue of them, and went to Eely, and neuer returned.
Then Duke William toke much of the liuelode of Saint Albons.
At Christmasse he would be crowned at Glocester, at Whitsontide at Westminster, at Easter at Winchester: these feastes he kept with great royaltie, but he made his co~mons bare, and himselfe riche.
He was proude of port, and had a great belly, balde heade, and a bigge man in all the parts of his body, he was a good Archer, and right fewe might bende his bowe.
Whe~ Christmasse approched he marched with al his army to London, that there he mighte be crowned King, which was there done on Christmasse daye by Aldred Archbishoppe of Yorke, and not by Stigande of Canturburie bycause he came not lawfully by that dignitie: then he receyued homage, othe of fidelitie, and pledges of the nobles, and commaunded that in euery towne and village a bel should be roong euery nighte at eight of the clocke, and y^ all people should then put forth theyr fire and candle, and goe to bed, which order was obserued through this realme during hys raigne, and the raigne of William his sonne.
The Historiographers of that time accompted the yere to beginne at Christmas, after which accompt then began the yeare
but after the accompt of England now obserued, the yeare beginneth not til the.

Isabel the Quéene being perswaded that the Earle of Leicester too muche fauoured the olde King hyr husbande, through the subtile deuise of hyr scholemaster Adam Tarleton Bishop of Hereforde, appointed that Thomas Gornay, and Iohn Maltrauers Knightes, hauing receyued him into theyr custody, should carrie him about whether they would, so that none of hys well willers shoulde haue accesse vnto him, or vnderstand where he made any long abode.
These brought him out by nighte from Kenilworth, and firste he is brought to the Castell of Corfe, then to Bristow, where for a season he was kept shut vp close in the Castel, vntil suche time as it was vnderstoode of by certaine, Burgesses of the same Towne, who for the deliueraunce of the said Edward, conueyed, themselues ouer Sea: whose determination béeing knowne to his kéepers, in a certaine darke night they conueyed him thence to Berkeley.
These tormentours forced him to ride bareheaded: when he woulde sléepe they would not suffer hym: neyther when he was hungry would they giue him suche meate as liked him, but suche as he lothed.
Euerye worde he spake was contraried by them, giuing out moste slaunderously, that he was madde.
And to conclude, in all matters that they coulde imagine, they were contrarie to hys wyll, that eyther by colde or watchyng, or vnholesome meates, or melancholy or other infirmitie, he myght languishe and dye.
But contrariwise, thys man being of a good disposition by nature, stoute to suffer, and patiente throughe Gods grace to abyde griefes, hée endured all the wicked deuises of hys enymies.
For as touching poysons whiche were ministred to him, by the benefit of nature he dispatched them away.
These Cha~pions (as sayd) bring the olde king towardes Barkeley, being guarded with a rabble of Helhoundes, along by the graunges belonging to the Castell of Bristow, where that wicked man Gerney making a crown of Hey, put it on hys heade, and the souldiours that were aboute him mocked him, saying, Tprut, auaunt sir King, making a kinde of noise with theyr mouthes, as though they had farted.
These doubting to meete some of hys friendes, bent theyr iourney ouer the Marish grounds, lying by the ruier of Seuerne.
Moreouer diuising by all meanes to disfigure him that hée mighte not be knowen, they determined to shaue as well the heare off hys heade as also off his bearde, wherefore comming by a little Water whiche ranne in a ditche, they commaunded him to alighte from his horsse to be shauen: to whome being set on a Molehill, a Barbour came with a Bason of colde Water taken out of the ditch, to who~ Edwarde sayd, shall haue no warme water? the Barber answered, this wyll serue: quoth Edward, will ye or nil yée will haue warme water: and that he might kéepe his promise, he beganne to wéepe and to shed teares plentifullye, (as it was reported by William Byshop, to sir Thomas de la More knight.)
At length they came to Berkeley Castel, where Edward was shutte vppe close like an Ancher.
Isabel his wife taking it grieuously that hir husba~ds life was thus prolonged, made complaint to Adam Bishop of Hereforde, fayning that she had certayne dreames, the interpretation whereof she misliked.
In like sorte the Bishop being in hys conscience guiltie of treason, stoode in feare the like feare also stoke the heartes of other for the same offence, whom the Diuer had gathered together to that effect.
Wherfore it séemed good to many of great dignity bloud, as wel spiritual as temporal, yt al such fear should be taken away by ye death of Edwarde, whervppon letters were sent to hys kéepers, blaming them for suffering him to enioy so much libertie, nourishing him so delicately.
Moreouer there is a priuie motion made to them, that the death of Edwarde woulde not be misliked vnto them: and in this pointe, the great deceyte of Sophisters stoode in force, set downe by the Bishoppe of Hereforde, who wrote thus: Edwardum occidere nolite timere bonum est: Kyl Edward do not feare it is a good thing.
or thus: To seeke to shed king Edwards bloud, Refuse to feare counte it good.
Thys saying is to be resolued into two propositions, whereof the first consisting of thrée wordes, to witte, Edwardum occidere nolite, and the seconde of other thrée, that is, Timere bonum est, do séeme to perswade very subtilly: but the receyuers of the letters not being ignorant of the Sophistical writing, chaunged the meaning thereof to thys sense, Edwardum occidere nolite timere, and afterwarde ioyned these wordes bonum est.
Nowe when the olde king was broughte to the Castell aforesayde, he was very curteouslye receiued by Thomas Lorde Barkeley, but after the tormentors had receyued letters concerning the gouernemente of the Castell, Thomas Lord of Berkley is commaunded to departe from thence, wherefore taking his leaue with sighes, he goeth to his other dwelling places.
After this the olde king was shutte vp in a close Chamber, where with the stincke of the deade carkasses layde in a celler vnder him, he was miserablye tormented manye dayes, in suche sorte, that he was well nyghe suffocated therewith: and that the paine was almost intollorable, it appeared by the complainte he made on a certayne daye at the Chamber windowe, certayne Carpenters then working on the righte side thereof hearing the same.
But these tyraunts perceyuing that this woulde not force hys death, one night being the xxij. of September, they came rushing in vppon him, as he laye in his bedde, with greate heauye as muche in weyghte as xv. menne coulde beare, wherwyth they oppressed and smoothered hym, into whom also they thrust a plummers yron, being made redde hotte vp into his bowels, throughe a certaine instrumente like to the end of a Trumpet, or glister pipe, put in at hys fundiment, burning thereby his inward partes, prouiding thereby least any wound being founde in the kings bodye, they might be caused to aunsweare it.
In this sort was this stoute King oppressed, crying with a lowde voyce, so that many as well within the Castell as without heard it, perceyuing it was the cry of one that suffered violente deathe, which caused many of Berkeley (as they affirmed) to take co~passion thereof, and to pray for the soule of him that was then departing.
Isabel and the Bishop, that their tyrannye mighte be hid, outlawed and banished Thomas Gournay, and Iohn Maltrauers.
Thomas fléeing into Marcels, thrée yeares after being known was taken and brought towards Englande, and was beheaded on the Sea, least he shoulde accuse the chiefe doer.
This yeare died Charles king of Fraunce the thirde brother, whiche was brother to the Lady Isabel Quéene of Englande, mother to King Edward the thirde, by whose deathe the succession of the Kingdome of Fraunce came to the said Edwarde: but it was vsurped and possessed by Phillip de Valoys vncle to the sayde Charles; who dyd intrude himself by force.
King Edward married Phillip the Earles daughter of Heynalde, at Yorke the fiue and twentith of Februarie: shée was sisters daughter to Phillippe de Valoys aforesayde.
Parliament was holden at Northampton, in whiche shameful peace was made betwixt the Englishmen and Scots; so that Dauid, the sonne of Robert Bruis, scarce seuen yeres olde, married Ioan of the Tower king Edwardes sister, at Berwike, the twelfth of July.
Also the king made the Scottes, charters, the tenour whereof was vnknowen to the Englishmen: but al was done as it pleased the olde Quéene, Roger Mortimer, and Iames Dowglas.
The Scottes made manye tannting times against the Englishmen, for the fond disguised apparel by them at that time vsed, amongst the which was fastened vppon the Church doores of Saint Peter towardes Stangate, Long beardes hartlesse, Painted hoodes vvitlesse, Gay coates gracelesse, Makes England thriftlesse.
In a Parliament at Salisburie, the K. made thrée Erles, Iohn of Eltam his brother Earle of Cornewal, Roger Mortimer Earle of the March, and Iames Butler of Ireland Earle of Ormond.
From this Parliament the Earle of Lancaster, ye Lord Wake, Henrie Beamonde, Earle Marshal, and other noble men did absent the~selues, not being far off fro~ thence in armour, for the whiche the King was highly displeased: notwithstanding in Sommer following they submitted themselues vnto the Kyngs mercy, séekyng his fauour.
Certaine men of this land, to y^ intent to try what friends they had in England, craftily deuised that Edward the second king of England was aliue in the Castell of Gorffe, but not to bée séene in the daye time, and therefore they vsed manye nightes to make shewes and maskyng wyth dauncing vpon the towers and Wals of the Castel, which being perceyued by people of the countrey, it was thoughte there had bin some great king vnto whom they dyd these greate solemnities: this rumour was spredde ouer all Englande, to witte, that the olde King was aliue, whence it came to passe, that the Earle of Kent sente thyther a Fryer Precher, to trye the truth of the matter, who (as it was thought) hauing corrupted the Porter of the Castell with rewardes, is let in, where he lay all the day in the Porters lodge verye close, and whe~ night was come, he was willed to put on y^ habit of a lay ma~, and then was brought into the Hal, wher he saw (as he thought) Edwarde the Father of the king sitting royally at supper with great maiestie.
This Frier being thus perswaded, returned againe to the Earle of Kente, and reported as he thought, what he saw: whervpon y^
Erle saide and affirmed with an othe, that he would indeauoure by all the meanes he coulde to deliuer his brother from prison.
The same yeare at the earnest request of some, the king held a Parliament at Winchester, where by procurement of the olde Quéene, and Roger Mortimer, the sayde Earle of Kent, and manye other noble men and religious persons, to witte, the prouincials of the white Carmilit Friers, and of the blacke Preaching Friers, and Frier Richarde Wliten were accused of conspiracie, touching (as it was sayde) the deliuerye of the Kings Father, which matter although it were but deuised fantasie and a méere lye, yet the sayde Earle for certaine confessions whyche he made, and for certayne letters which were founde about him, was there beheaded.
The other, to wit, y^ prouincials of the Predicants Carmilites, were banished: but the Bishop of London, was set at libertie.
Robert de Taunton Priest, and some certain Carmilite Friers and predicants, were condemned to perpetual prison.
The death of the sayde Earle was the lesse lamented, bycause his familye and seruauntes had aboue measure afflicted the commons, in taking vp things (as they trauayled,) at the Kings price, paying nothing or verye lyttle for it.
There was a Parliament holden at Notingham, where Roger Mortimer was in suche glorie and honoure, that it was without all comparison.
No man durst name him any other than Earle of Marche: a greater rowt of men wayted at his héeles, than on the Kings person: he would suffer the King to rise to him, and would walke with y^
King equally step by step, chéeke by chéeke, neuer preferring y^
King, but would go formost himselfe with his Officers: he greatly rebuked the Earle of Lancaster, cousin to the Kyng, for that withoute hys consent hée appointed certayne lodgings for Noble men in the Towne, demaundyng who made him so bolde, to take vppe lodgings so nighe vnto the Quéene, wyth whyche wordes the Conestable béeyng greatelye feared, appoynted lodging for the Earle of Lancaster one myle oute of the Towne: and lykewise were lodged the Earle of Hereforde, Iohn de Bohune of Estsex, highe Conestable of Englande, and others.
By whyche meanes a contention rose among the Noblemen, and greate murmuring among the common people, who sayde, that Roger Mortimer the Quéenes Paragon, and the Kyngs Mayster, sought all the means he could to destroy the Kyngs bloude, and to vsurpe the Regall Maiestie: whyche reporte troubled muche the Kyngs friendes, to wéete, William Mountacute, and other, who for the safegarde of the Kyng, sware themselues to be true to his person, and drew vnto them Robert de Hollande, who hadde of long tyme béene chiefe kéeper of the Castell, vnto whome all secreate corners of the same were knowne.
Then vppon a certayne night, the Kyng lying without the Castel, bothe he and his friendes were brought by Torchlight through a secrete waye vnder ground, beginning far off from y^ said Castell, til they came euen to the Quéenes Chamber, whyche they by chaunce found open: they therfore beyng armed with naked swords in their ha~ds, went forwards, leauing the King also armed without the dore of the Chamber, least that his mother should espie him: they which entred in, slew Hugh Turpinton Knighte, who resisted them, Mayster Iohn Neuell of Horneby giuing him his deadly wound.
From thence, they went toward the Quéene mother, whome they found with the Earle of March, readie to haue gone to bedde: and hauing taken the sayde Earle, they ledde him out into the Hall, after whome the Quéene followed, crying Bele fits, bele fits, ayes pitie de gentil Mortimer, Good sonne· good son, take pitie vpon gentle Mortimer, for she suspected that hir sonne was there, though she saw him not.
Then are the keyes of the Castell sent for, and euery place with all the furniture is yéelded vp into the Kings hands, but in suche secret wise, that none without the Castell, except the Kings friends vnderstoode thereof.
The next day in the morning very early, they bring Roger Mortimer, and other his frie~ds taken with him, with an horrible shout and crying (the Earle of Lancaster then blind, being one of them that made the shoute for ioy) towards London, where he was committed to the Tower, and afterward condemned at Westminster, in presence of the whole Parliament on Saint Andrewes euen next following, and then drawne to the Elmes, and there hanged on the common gallowes, whereon he hung two dayes and two nightes by the Kings commandement, and then was buryed in the Grey Friers Church.
He was condemned by his Péeres, and yet neuer was brought to answere before them, for it was not then the custome, after the death of the Earles of Lancaster, Winchester, Glocester, and Kent, wherefore this Earle had that law him selfe, which he appoynted for other.
The causes of his death laid against him were these.
First, that he was consenting to the murthering of the Kings father.
Secondly, for that he had receiued a great summe of money, whereby the Kings honor was greatly abated at Stanhope Parke, where he gaue a signe vnto the Scottes that they should flie.
Thirdly, for that he caused certayne auntient déedes and Charters to be brent, wherein the King of Scots stood bound vnto the King of Englande: and especially for that he had caused a to be made betwixt the Kings sister, and Dauid the sonne of Robert le Bruis.
Fourthly, that he had vnprofitably consumed a greate deale of treasure which he found in the kings treasurie, and in the treasurie of the Earles of Winchester and Glocester.
Fiftly, for appropriating vnto himselfe the wardes and mariages of all England.
Sixtly, for being an euill counseller to the King, and to the Quéene mother, and for being ouermuch familiar with hir.
There died with him his friends Simon de Burford Knight, brother to Sir William Burford that was Justice, Iohn Deuerell Esquier, who was desirous to haue made open confession of the Kings fathers cruell death, but he could not be suffered.
King Edward, the Bishop of Winchester, Wil. Mountacute, and very few others passed ouer Sea, like as they had bin Merchants, hauing with hym scarse xv. horsemen.

The xv. of June was borne vnto king Edward, his first sonne at Wodstoke, who was after named Edwarde the blacke Prince.

This Sir Iohn Pultney, builded the Colledge in London, called Saint Laurence Pultney, and little Alhallowes, a Parish Churche in Thamis streete, and also the Carmelite Friers Church in Couentrie.

In the beginning of August, Edward Bailioll, sonne and heire to Iohn King of Scottes, came into England, which Edward had bin before that time banished out of Scotland.
At his comming, he declared what right he had in the Kingdome.
Henry Beawmont Earle of Bohune, Gilbert Vmfreuill Earle of Angus, Dauid Earle of Athels, Richard Talbot, Ralph Baron of Stafford, Fulx Fitz Williams, with many other noble men, affirming they had right of inheritance in Scotland, desired licence and ayde of the King of Englande, to recouer the sayd Kingdome and landes due to them, but the King hauing regard of the peace lately made, and also for his sisters sake Quéene of Scottes, woulde not suffer them to leade an armie through his lande, wherefore the sayde Lordes getting a Fléete of Shippes, entred the Sea, and sayling toward Scotland, landed at Kinkehorne, where the Earle of Fife, and Robert Bruse, Bastard sonne to Robert Bruse, with tenne thousand Scottes resisted them néere vnto Dunfermeling, but the Englishmen put them to flight, and slew many.
Afterward, to wéete on Saint Lawrence day, they had a sore conflict at Gledesmore, where two thousand Englishmen ouercame fortie thousand Scottes.

During this séege, the Scottes sought many wayes to remoue the same, leuying a great army ouer all Scotland· but comming to the séege, they could not bring their purpose to effect, yet still prouoking the Kings army to battell, wherevpon at length the two armies appoynted to fight, and setting out vpon Halidowne hill, there commeth forth of the Scottes Campe a certayne stout Champion of greate stature, who for a facte by him done, was called Turnebull: he standing in the midst betwixte the two armies challenged all the Englishmen, any one of them to fight with him a Combate: at le~gth, one Robert Vene Knight, a Nonffolke man, requesting licence of the King, being armed, with his sword drawne, marcheth toward the Champion, méeting by the way a certayne blacke mastife Dogge, which wayted on the Champion, whome with his sworde he suddaynely strake, and cut him off at his loynes, at the sight whereof the mayster of the Dogge slayne, was much abashed, and in his battayle more warie and fearefull: whose left hande and head also afterwarde, this worthye Knight cut off.

Phillip Quéene of England did beare hir second sonne named Wyllyam, at Hatfielde, who shortlye after dyed.
Aboute the feast of the Epiphany, the King and the Archbishoppe returned out of Scotland, to the buryall of Iohn of Eltham, Earle of Cornewall, brother vnto the King, who deceassed at Berwike in the moneth of October, and was buryed at Westminster.
At whiche time, the King kepte a Parliamente at London, whiche beganne on the Monday after Saint Matthies day: and on the firste Sundaye in Lente, hée made hys eldest sonne Edwarde Earle of Chester, and Duke of Cornewall.
He made also sixe other Earles, Henry of Lancaster (sonne to Henry Earle of Lancaster Earle of Darby, Hugh Audley Earle of Glocester, William Bohune Earle of Northhampton, William Montacute Earle of Salisburie, William Clinton Earle of Huntingdon, Robert Vffurd Earle of Suffolke, to the which Robert he at that time gaue the manor of Base court, in the parish of Saint Giles without Cripplegate of London, commonly called to this day the Barbicane, bycause in old time ye same had bin a Burgekening, or watchtower for the Citie.
The same day, the King made twentie Knightes, to wéete, Sir Edward Mountacute, Thomas Somarton, Sir Isle, Sir Darcy Richard, Sir Damuory, Sir Iohn Poultney, Sir de Mere, Roger Banant, Roger Hilary, Sir Bolingbroke, Sir Butterell, Sir Simon Swanland, William Scotte, William Basset, Robert Sodington, William Zoustes, Sir Cogshall, Roger Sangrauile, Thomas de la More mine Authoure, and Iohn Strache.
In the same Parliament it was enacted, that no wooll growing within the Realme of England, should be transposed out of the same, but that it should be made into cloth in England, and that all Fullers, Weauers, and Clothworkers of euery degrée, being sufficiently instructed, and cunning in their arte, from what Countrey so euer they came into England· should receyue and enioy certayne priuiledges, yea and moreouer should liue at the Kings charges out of the Exchequer, vntill they had prouided commodiouslie to liue by their art.
Although this Statute séemed at the beginning to be nothing profitable, yet in short time the arte of clothing increased so much thereby, that it was twentie times more vsed than before.
Also it was enacted, that no man should after that time buy any cloth that was made beyond the Sea, and that none should weare any Furres, but such as might dispend one hundred pound by yeare.
Sir Iohn Poultney Draper, the of October· After the feast of Saint Michaell, a Parliament was holden at London, and a Connocation was assembled by the Archbishop, wherein the Cleargie graunted a tenth for thrée yeares, and the commons a fiftenth, in consideration of the Kings warres which was hote in Scotlande, and also to resist the French King, who made great bragges, and shewed great crueltie, for he outlawed, slew, and emprisoned all Englishmen, and confiscated the goodes and Cattayles of all that were found in his Kingdome of France, threatning, that he would be reuenged for his friendes the Scottes.
Moreouer, he left not so muche as one Towne or Castell in the Counties of Aquitayne, or of Poyters, that was not seized into his handes: wherevpon King Edward sente into Brabant, to take vp all the woolles whiche Merchants had brought thither, and made sale thereof for readie money.
He also wrote Letters to the French King, exhorting him, that he woulde continue his olde amitie.
Sir Walter Many béeing the Embassadour for the King of Englande, and desirous to reuenge the bloud of two Englishmen that were slayne comming a lande for freshe water, in a certayne Islande, called the Ile of Agnes, nigh vnto Flanders, he caused all that hée founde in the sayde Island to be put to the sworde, and tooke prisoner the Earle of Flanders brother, who was Captayne of the Ile. Certayne of the Island men béeing fled into a Church, were brent to the number of thrée thousande, with the Church and all, by the Welchmen.
The warres thus as aforesayde begonne betwixte the two Kingdomes, the rumour thereof came vnto the Court of Rome, wherevpon the Pope sent two Cardinalles for the reformation and ordering of the peace betwixte the two Kingdomes, who comming to Westminster, declared before the King the cause of their comming, wherevnto the King answered, that although without all reason they dyd séeme to restreyne hym of right and equitie, for that hée ought to succéede into the Kingdome of hys forefathers, the whyche hys aduersarie Phillip de Valoys dyd denye hym, expelling, murthering, and emprisoning hys people, and taking away the Dukedome of Aquitayne, and Earledome of Poyters without cause, maynteyning the Scottes and other Rebelles agaynste hym, yet these iniuries notwithstanding, hée was contented if they coulde take order for the quiet enioying of Aquitayne and other fées belonging vnto hym, whiche hys predecessoures did enioy.
Moreouer, for the dismissing of all ayde that the French King shoulde gyue vnto the Scottes at any tyme of Rebellion, for the which he offered his money, and also the mariage of his eldest sonne, and also to resigne all suche rites and interest that he hadde to the Kyngdome of France.
The Cardinalles béeyng greately comforted with this aunswere, departed, hoping that all warres were nowe ended.
They tooke with them Iohn the Archbishoppe of Canterburie, Richarde Bishoppe of Durham, and Geffrey Lorde Scrope, who altogyther wente on message with the Kynges aunswere to the Frenche Kyng, hauing full authoritie to treate and conclude peace.
These béeing so reasonable offers, coulde not pacifye the furious minde of the Frenche King, who reposed greate trust in the Scottes, hopyng by them, and through theyr meanes, quite to dispossesse, and to disherite the King of England of all the title he had.
The King caused to confiscate all the goodes of the Lonibards, and also of the Monkes of the order of Cluny, and Cisteaux through the whole Realme.
The King tooke wooll, to a certaine number of Sackes, at a low price in euery Countrey: the number that was set vpon Staffordshire, was sixe hundred sackes, price nine markes the sacke of good wooll: but nothing was payde.
Secondly, for the halfe, in whose hands soeuer it were founde, as well Mercha~ts as other.
And the third time the King tooke a fiftenth of the comminalty, to be payde in wooll, price of euery stone (contayning fourtéene pound) two shillings.
The King appointed also all the Corne and glebe lands to serue for his warres.
About Saint Margarets day, King Edward, with Quéene Philip his wife, and a great army passed the Seas with a Nauie of
The fourth of October, fiftie Galleys well manned and furnished, came to Southampton about nine of the clocke, and sacked the Towne, the Townesmen running away for feare, by the breake of the next day they which fledde by helpe of the Countrey there about, came againste the Pirats, and fought with them, in the whiche skirmish were slayne to the number of thrée hundred Pirates, togither with their Captayne a yong Souldioure the King of Sicils sonne.
To this yong man, the French King had giuen whatsoeuer he got in the Kingdome of England, but he béeing beaten downe by a certayne man of the Countrey, cried Rancon, notwithstanding the husbandman layde him on with his clubbe, till he had slayne hym, speaking these words, yea (quoth he) know well ynough thou art a and therefore shalt thon dye, for he vnderstoode not his spéech, neyther had he anye skill to take gentlemen prisoners to kéepe them for their raunsome: wherfore the residue of those Gennowayes, after they had set the towne a fire and brent it vp quite, fledde to their Galleyes, and in theyr fléeing certaine of them were drowned.
After this the inhabitantes of the towne compassed it about with a strong and great Wal.
The King still mayntayning his warres in Fraunce on the euen of the Annuntiation of our Lady· galleyes· approching to the towne of Harwich they cast fire therein, the force whereof by a contrarie winde was stayd, so that no gret harme was done thereby.
Furthermore, in the same yeare about the feaste of Pentecost, certaine Pirates of Normandie and shipped in Gallenes and Pinaces, made a shew on the sea about Southampton, as they woulde haue come alande, and threatned sore to spoyle the towne againe, but perceyuing the townesmen ready to resist them, they returned to the Ile of Wight, but entred not, being put backe by the inhabitauntes, wherevppon they sayled about the sea coastes, séeking to lande in places lesse defended, and after came to Hastings, where they brente fishers cotages with theyr boates, and slewe many men.
Also they made greate shewes many times against the Ile of Thanet, Douer, and Fulkestone but in those places they did little harme, excepte to poore fishermen: thence they sayled about to the hauens of Cornewall and Deuonshire, doing in all places much harme to the fisher men, and suche shippes as they founde vnma~ned they fiered.
At length they entred Plimouth Hauen, where they brent certain great shippes and a great parte of the towne: these were met by Hugh Curtney Earle of a knight of foure scoure yeares olde, being accompanyed with manye souldiours of his Countrey, who hauing lost at the firste fronte a fewe of his men whiche were slaine by the quarrels of the French, ioyned to fighte wyth them hande to hande, and slaying many of the Pyrates vpon drye lande, chased the residue which fled to take their Galleys, and being not able to come nigh them by wading, they ere drowned in the to the nu~ber of fiue hundred being brought to the King lying in Brabant, that diuers Parts of Englande were spoyled with the Pirates, hée declared to his friends, to wit the Marques of and a cere Cardinall, what great causes he had to reuenge himself vpon them, and in the end, was aunswered by the Cardinal as followeth.
The kingdome of Fr (sayde he) is compassed about with of lke, whiche can not be broken, by all the strength of the kingdome of Englande, wherefore my Lorde king, you must stay for the comming of the Dutchmen, and other your friendes and confederates, the greater part wherof you now

Saint Matthy king Edwarde beganne to ryde with Banner displayed, and twelue thousand men of armes, against the Frenche King, burnyng Townes and Castels wheresoeuer he came.
In the first night being verye darke, Geffrey Lord Scrope one of the Kings Justices, led one of the Cardinals, to wit Bertrand de Mount Fantyne, of the title of our Ladie, vp into an high Tower, shewing hym the whole lande about towarde Fraunce, for the compasse of fiftéene leagues, to be in euery place on (saying these wordes,) sir, doth not this sien threed wherwith Fraunce is compassed, seme to you to be broken: the Cardinall aunswering nothing, fel downe as deade for sorowe and feare.
In thys sort king Edward made into France dayly, continuing the space of fiue wéekes, and caused armye to trauell in such sort, that they destroyed the whole, Countrey of Cambray, Tourney, and Landenewe· excepting those Cities which wer sword to him wt churches and Castels.
The inhabitauntes of the Countrey fledde, neyther was there anye man that durst resist his enterpryses, althoughe the Frenche King had gathered greate armies within the Walled Cities, himself lying in the stro~g Towne of Saint Quintines, what time the Brabanders had determined to returne home againe, and were entred into theyr iourney, being forced there vnto, partlye by wante of victuals, and partlye by the coldnesse of Winter whyche· grew on fast.
The French king vnderstanding thereof, beganne to moue himselfe with hys armye towarde the campe of the king of England, who gladly loking for his comming, called back again the Brabanders, hauing receyued letters fro~ the Frenche King, that he woulde ioyne battayle against hym, he sent him worde back againe, that he woulde stay for him thrée dayes, wherefore on the fourth daye the Kyng loking for the Frenche Kings comming, whiche woulde come no nearer them than two miles off, breaking bridges and felling of trées, that the King of Englande mighte not followe hym, he fled to Paris, wherevpon king Edwarde returned by Hanonia in Brabrant, where he continued almost the whole Winter.
In this Winter time king Edwarde grewe into greate friendshippe with the Flemmings, who prepared themselues at all times to shewe their selues as good subiectes vnto him, swearing to doe homage and fealtie, vppon condition that he would call himselfe King of Fraunce, and in token thereof would from thence forth giue armes with Flouredeluces, for otherwise they durste not obey him, for feare of the Popes curse, which was to be layde vppon them, if at any time they rebelled against the King of Fraunce.
Wherefore by the coll of his friends, the Flemmings, and consent of his noble men, he agréed there vnto, and tooke vppon him both the name and armes of the King of France.
He also toke Flaunders vnder his gouernement, the people wherof long after in all matters were to him obedient, as vnto the King of Fraunce Conquerer.
As touching the title and and armes aforesayde, the Frenche king sayde to certayne Englishmen sent vnto him, our cousin (quoth he) doth wrongfully beare quartered armes of England and Fraunce, whiche matter notwithstanding doth not much displease vs, for y^ he is descended from the weaker side of our kin, and therfore as being a Batcheller we woulde be content to graunt him licence to beare part of our armes of Fraunce: but wheras in his seales and letters patents he nameth hymself as well King of Englande, as of Fraunce, and doth set the firste quarter of his armes with Leopardes, before the quarter of Liles, it doth grieue vs very muche, making apparaunt to the beholders, that the little Islande of Englande, is to be preferred, before the great kingdome of France.
Unto whom sir Iohn of Shordich knighte made aunswere, that it was the custome of men in those dayes, to set the title and armes of theyr progenitors, before the armes and title of the righte descending of their mother: and thus of dutie and reason (sayde he) doth my Lord the King of Englande preferre hys armes.
King Edwarde being thus busied, the Mariners of the Cinque Ports, embarked themselues in Pinaces and smal beates wel appointed, who after the feast of S. Hillarie arriued at Bononie vpo~ the sea coast, the weather being so cloudie and darke that they could scarsely be perceyued to be in the hauen, they brent in the lower towne nintéene galleys and four great shippes, and twentie small boates with all theyr tackling, and all suche houses as were scituate nyghe to the sea cost, amongst which was one great house full of dares, sayles, weapons, and other necessaries, sufficiente to furnish ninetéene galleys, and men for the~: at ye length in a skirmish betwixt the townes men and the Englishmen, many of the land men were slaine.
About the beginning of Februarie king Edwarde returned into Englande, came vnto Gaunt, where the Quéene lay in childbed of hir fourth sonne named Iohn he helde a Parliament at Westminster· wherein the Temporalty granted hym euery ninth fléece of Wool, euery ninth lambe, and euery ninth sheafe of all sorts of corne, and the cleargie gaue him a newe tenth.
Immediatety after Easter, the Earles of Salisburie and Suffolke, being accompanyed but with a fewe men, gaue an assault to the Towne of Lile in Flaunders, which Town was confederate with the French King, but they chasing the Fre~ch men too far within the gates, the Percolices being let fal, they were beset with a multitude of men of armes, and being taken, they were conueyed into Fraunce, fettered and shackeled with yron, although they had orne to be true prisoners: they were drawen in a Cart through the middest of euery Citie, Towne, Uillage and Hamlet, with greate shoutes and cryes, rayling on them: and at length béeing brought to the presence of the French King, he woulde haue most shamefully slaine them, had he not bin otherwise perswaded by the counsel of the King of Boemia.
King Edward kept his Whitsontide at Ipswich, for that he intended from thence to take his passage into Flaunders, but being certified that the French king had sent a great Nauie of Spanish ships, and also the whole fléete of Fraunce, to stoppe his passage, he caused his ships of the Cinque Ports and other to be assembled, so that he had in his fléete great and small.
Wherefore on the Thursdaye before the matiuity of Saint Iohn Baptist, hauing a prosperous winde, he began to sayle, and the nexte daye in the euen of the sayde feaste they escried the French Fléete lying in Swine Hauen.
Wherefore the King caused all his Fléete to come to Ancker.
The next day being the feast of S. Iohn Baptist, in the morning, the French Fléet deuided themselues into thrée parts, and remoued themselues as it were a myle, approching towards the kings Fléete.
Whiche when the king perceyued, about nine of the clocke hauing the winde and sunne on his backe, set forwarde and met his enimies as he woulde haue wished, wherewithall the whole fléete gaue a terrible shoute, and a showre of arrowes out of long woodden bowes so powred downe on the French men, that thousandes were slaine in that méeting, at length they closed and came to hand blowes, with Pikes, Powle swordes, and some threw stones from the toppes of shippes wherewith many were brained.
The greatnesse and heigth of the Spanish shippes caused many English men to strike many a stroke in vaine: but to be short, the French shippes being ouercome, and al the men spente of the firste parte, the Englishmen entred and tooke them.
The French shippes were chayned togyther in suche sort, that they coulde not be separated one from another, so that a fewe Englishmen kepte that part of the Fléete: wherfore they set vpon the second ward, and with greate difficultie gaue the charge, whiche being done, was sooner ouercome than the firste, for that the French men leauing their ships, many of them leapt ouer borde.
The Englishmen hauing thus ouercome the first and seconde parte of the Fléete, and now hauing night drawyng on, partly for want of light, and partly for that they were wearie, they determined to take some rest till the next morning, wherefore that night xxx. shippes of the thirde crewe fled awaye, and a greate shippe called the Iames of Deepe thinking to haue carried away a certaine ship of Sandwiche, belonging to the Prior of Canterburie, was stayde: for the Saylers so stoutely defended themselues by the helpe of the Earle of Huntingdon that they saued themselues and theyr ship, from the Frenchmen.
The fight continued al the night, and in the morning the Normans being ouercome and take~, there wer found in the shippe aboue.
Moreouer the king vnderstanding that xxx. ships were fledde, hée sent fortie ships well appointed to followe them, ouer the which he made Iohn Crabe gouernour: but what good spéede he had is not knowen.
In the firste companye of shippes that were taken they founde these conquered shippes, the Denise, the George, the Christopher, and the blacke Cocke, all whiche ships were taken by Erenchmen at Sluce, and carried into Normandie.
The number of shippes of warre that were taken, was about.
barges: the number of enimies slaine and drowned were aboue fiue and twentie thousande and of Englishmen about foure thousand, among whom were foure Knightes, sir Thomas Mortimer the Kings cousin, sir Thomas Latimer his son, sir William Butteler of Seortkorne, and sir Thomas Poynings.
About the same time the Scots came with a great power into Englande, burning and spoyling all the Marches by fire and sworde, and when they were returning wyth a great bootie of Cattayle, they were neuer withstoode by the Nobilitie of the Marches, but the common people wold not suffer them so to passe, set vpon them, toke theyr bootie from them, and slewe manye of them, and toke more than.
Scots of good reputation, whome they kept from raunsome, for the whiche fact the Noble menne of the Marches were highly displeased.
About Lammas certaine French Pirats gaue an assault to the Ile of Wight and sodainly entred it, but sir Peter Russel Knight, méeting them with the people of that Ile, put them backe again, and made them to flée, staying manye of them, in the which skirmish the sayde knight was wounded wherof he dyed.
These Pirates sayled the~ce toward the coast of Deuonshire, and comming to Teygnemouth, they sette fire on the Towne and brent it: from thence they sayled towardes Plimouth, which towne was so defended, that they coulde not hurte it, but burnt the farmes and fayre places nigh adioyning, and toke a knight prisoner, whom they caried with them.
The same yeare king Edward besieged Turney, but vpon entreatie made by the Frenche, a truce was taken from Michaelmasse til midsommer, wherfore the king comming to Gaunt in Flaunders, stayed there, looking for money out of England, which came not.
King Edwarde with eight of his men, fayning that hée woulde ride abrode for his pleasure, secretly came into where taking shippe, after he had sayled thrée dayes and thrée nightes, on Saint Andrewes day at night aboute the Cock crowing, he entred the Tower of Londo~ by water, being wayted on by the Earle of Northampton, Nicholas Ca~tilopo, Reignalde Cobham, Giles de Bello Campo, Iohn de Bello· Campo Knightes, William Killesby and Phillippe Weston Priestes: earely in the morning, he sent for his cha~cellour, treasurer, and Justices then being at London, and the Bishop of Chichester being his Chauncellour, and the Bishop of Couentrie his Treasurer, he put out of office, minding also to haue sent them into Flaunders, to haue ben pledges for money he owed there: but the Bishoppe of Chichester declared vnto him what daunger might insue to hym, by the Canons of the Churche: whervpon the King dismissed them out of the Tower: but as concerning the high Justices, to witte, Iohn Lorde Stoner, Robert Lord Willowby, William Lorde Scharshel, and especially Nicholas Lord Bech, who before that time was Lieutenant of the Tower of London, and sir Iohn Molens· Knight, with certaine marchaunt men, as Iohn Poultney, William Pole and Richard his brother, and the Chauncellours chiefe Clearkes, to witte, Maister Iohn de Saint Paule, Michael Wathe, Henrie Stafforde, and certaine of the Exchequer, as Maister Iohn Thorpe, with many other moe, the king commaunded to be imprisoned, some in one place, some in another, neyther woulde he suffer them to be discharged thence, til hée were throughlye pacified of his anger conceyued for not sendyng the money whiche shoulde haue serued at the siege of Torney.
This yeare about Christmas, Henrie Bishoppe of Lincolne, and Geffrey Lord Scrope, chiefe Justiciar to the kyng and his chiefe Counseller dyed at Gaunt.
King Edwarde kept his Christmasse at Gildforde, and after that a great Justing at Reading.
Also at Candlemasse hée kept a greate iusting at Langley, for the honor of the noble men of which he trayned vp there in feates of war.
He made Robert de Boursier Knight Lord Chancellour of Englande, and Robert Parnike Knighte Treasurer, the one to succéede the other.
Also he sent out Justiciars that shoulde set in euerye shire, to enquyre concerning the collectours of the tenthes and fiftéenthes, and of wools, and to ouersée al officers.
And bicause the Citie of London would not suffer that any such officers should set as Justices within theyr Citie as inquisitours of suche matters contrarie to theyr liberties, the King prouided that those Justices shoulde holde theyr Sessions in the Tower of London, to make inquisition of the domages of the Londoners: but bycause the Londoners woulde not aunswere there, vntill theyr liberties were fully confirmed, neyther anye suche confirmation coulde be had eyther of the King, or his Chauncellour touching Writs and Charters in the Towre, there rose thereof suche a greate tumulte, that the Justicies appointed there to sit, fayned that they woulde holde no session there, till after Easter.
Wherevpon the king being highly offended for the sayde tumult, and desirous to know the names of them that had raysed it, coulde not vnderstande but that they were certaine meane persons, who claymed theyr liberties: wherevpon the King being pacified of his troubled minde, forgaue all the offences committed by the Londoners, the Justices breaking vp all theyr sitting touching the sayde place.
This yeare within the quindene of Easter a Parliamente was holden at London wherein the Earles and nobles of the Realme, with the commons and others, amongst other things requested, that the Charter called Magna Carta, and Carta Foresta, with all other liberties béelonging to the Churche and kingdome should be obserued, and that the officers and chiefe Rulers of the Kings house shoulde be chosen by the Péeres of the Realme, in the Parliament: but these peticions the king would not confirme, nor could not abide to heare talked off.
About the beginning of the moneth of Julye, Kyng Edwarde receyued letters from Lodowike Duke of Bauarie, vsurper of the Romaine Empyre, in the whyche pretendyng friendshippe betwixt him and Phillip the French King, hée signifyed that those warres whyche the King of England had begonne in Fraunce, did greately mislike him, and therefore desired that there shoulde be concorde and amitie betwixte the Kings of both Realmes, the whyche to bée performed, he offered to bestowe some labour, requestyng Kyng Edwardes letters of aucthoritie thereof to treate and to conclude a truce for one yeare or twaine, towarde the ende of whiche letter, he addeth these wordes: The deputation, and Lieutenauntship whiche we gaue vnto you, we do for and sundry causes reuoke again.

To the which letters, king Edwarde wrote an inscription, in sorte as followeth.

King Edwarde gaue the Earledome of Cambridge to Iohn Lord Henault, vncle to Quéene Phillip, and after kept his feast of Saint Katherine at Newcastel, and his Christmas also.
Untill this time Dauid king of Scottes threatned to leuie an armie and to enter the lande, wherevpon king Edwarde entred Scotland, and followed after Dauid, who fled before him beyonde the Scottish sea, wasting and spoyling al as he went, except Castels and Marishes, in the which the Scottes togither with Dauid theyr king hyd themselues.
And William Mountacute Earle of Salisburie, hauing gotten a greate fléete, entred an Iland belonging to Scotlande, where most victoriouslye he conquered it, and the same Ile being called the Ile of Man, the kyng gaue it to the Conquerour franckelye and fréely to be possest, and caused hym to be called and crowned king of that Ile.
Then King Edward returning towards the south parts, kept solemn torneymentes at Dunstable, beyng accompanyed wyth
The same yeare was a Parliamente at Westminster, wherein the Archbishoppe of Canterburie was reconcyled to the King, before whom the Archbishoppe sware that althoughe the Kyng by hys counsell and consente hadde done homage to the French King for the Dukedome of Aquitaine, and the Earledome of Poytowe, yet he neuer consented therto as to be anye hurte or preiudice to the Kyng, or that by hys counsel he myghte incurre fauoure, or séeke to please the French King, but for that presente tyme he thoughte it beste to be done, both for the obtayning of peace and also for the profit of the Kyng and Realme.
After this Parliament the king commaunded Florences of golde to be made at the Tower of London, that is to saye, the peny of the value of sixe shillings eight pence, the halfe penye of the value of thrée shillings foure pence, a farthing worthe twentye pence.
In a Parliament at Westminster, in the moneth of May, the religious men that were possessours of Lands, graunted to the king, towards the maintenaunce of his warre, al their iewels and plate, as wel siluer as gold, horsses, carts, wagons, whervpon the kings treasure was notably enriched.
The same yeare auctoritie was giuen to the kings escheters, to enquire and certifye the Counsell of al such persons, which helde of the King any landes in Capite, or by any other fée, to the value of one hundred shillings, and that the names of all suche shoulde be enrolled and giuen vp for recorde.
Also certaine other were put in aucthoritie to signifie howe many sufficient and able were in euerye shire: also what other sufficient men were able to beare armour for the defence of theyr Country, and to sée them practised with suche kinde of weapon wherein they had beste skill: and being thus assembled in all parts of the Realme, speciallye suche as were of lawfull age, commaundemente was giuen out, that they shoulde be readye at the Kyngs commaundemente to fyghte agaynste theyr enimies.
King Edwarde and his nobles perceyuing the derogation that was done to the realme by such reseruations, prouisions and collations of benefices, as the Pope practised here in England, wrote to him, requiring him, that sith the Churches of Englande had bene founded and endued by noble and worthy men, to the ende the people might be instructed by people of their owne language, and that he beyng so farre off, coulde not vnderstande the defaultes, yet hys predecessours and he, more than had bene vsed, by diuerse reseruations, prouisions, and collations made to diuerse persons, some straungers, yea and some enimies to the Realme, whereby the money and profits were carried forth, theyr cures not prouided for, according to the founders mindes, they therefore vpon due considerations therof signifyed to him, that they coulde not suffer such enormities any longer, and therefore besought him to reuoke such reseruations, prouisions and collations wholy, to auoyde suche slaunders, mischieues, and harmes, as mighte ensue, and that the cures might be committed to persons méet for the exercises of the same: beséeching him further, wythout delay to signify his intention, sith they ment to bestow their diligence to remedie the matter, and sée that redresse might be had.

Many being called to ayde the King against the Scots, but not being ready, they contributed their money, wherewith the king might hyre souldiours in place of them that remayned at home.
King Edward caused to be called togither a great many of Artificers, to the Castell of Windsore, and began to builde an house whiche was called the Rounde Table, the floure wherof, from the Center or midde point into the compasse, was an hundred foote, and the whole Diameter.
The same time Phillip de Valoys king of Fraunce, buylded a Rounde Table in his Countrey, to the ende he mighte allure the menne of Warre of Germanie and Italie, and so to kéepe them from the Kyng of Englandes Rounde Table.
Kyng Edwarde in succour of Iohn Mountfort Duke of Brytaine, and of his wife and children, who then remayned in the kings custodie, sent the Earles of Northampton and of Oxforde, Hugh Spencer and Richard Talbot Knightes, and maister William Kilesby Clearke, euerye one of them hauing vnder them many me~ of armes and archers, into Britaine, who entred in despight of al theyr enimies whych resisted them, making many conflictes.
They toke as well walled Townes as other, with diuerse Fortresses and Castelles, both by assaulte and surrender, by whiche meanes they had the whole Countrey vnder theyr subiection, conquering till they came to the Towne of Morleis, where Charles de Bloys mette them wyth a greate armye.
Therfore in the Champion grounde nygh vnto Morleys the two armyes made greate and moste stoute battayle, wherin the worthinesse of both sortes dyd full well appeare: for they fought so stout on both sides, that in the first conflict it chaunced as the like had not bene séene: for the chiefe Captaines, Charles de Bloys, to whom the Frenche king hadde giuen the Dukedome of that Countrey, and William de Bohune Earle of Northamton, who for the defence of ye right of Iohn de Mountfort, naturall heire and Duke of that lande, the king of Englande had made a generall ouer the army of the English men, who foughte so long wyth hande strokes in the fielde that daye, that no manne but a lyar coulde giue more prayse to the one than to the other.
Thrée tymes that daye they beyng wearied on both sides, wythdrewe themselues to take breathe, and then fell to it again with Speare and shielde, and sworde and Targe, but in ye ende the right worthy and stoute Charles de Bloys, his men fléeing away, was also forced to flée himselfe, wherevppon after many slaine on both sides, the victorie fell to the Englishmen.
King Edwarde sente ouer Henrie Earle of Darbie, son to the Earle of Lancaster his cousin, with more than fiue hundered men of armes, amongst whom was the Earle of Penbroke and Walter de Many, with manye Archers, into Gascoigne, with Ralph Baron of Stafforde, Seneshal of Gascoigne, who being come thyther, the sayde Earle made fiftie Knightes of his armye, and after wanne manye walled Townes and Castelles, making many worthy skirmishes, and at length won the towne of by assaulte, to the kéeping wherof they appointed Ralph Stafford, afterward they appointed thrée iourneys toward other townes, as especially to Brigerecke (so called for the strength thereof, and also called the Chamber of Fraunce and also to ye town of Saint Iohn de Laruel, and to many other greate and strong townes well fortified, which with great toyles and diuerse daungerous assaultes they wan: where the Earle of Darbie and his souldiours vndermining the Towers and Wals of the sayde towne, were very sore assaulted by them whiche defended.
Thus he Conquered Cities, Townes, Castelles and Fortresses, to the number of one hundred and fiftie, bringing a greate parte of Gascoigne vnder subiection, euen to Tolouse, vnto the whiche Citie he did no domage, neyther to the inhabitantes therof, but that he made them wonderfully afrayde: as certaine of them tolde me, (sayeth my aucthour,) their fear was such, that the religious people were constrayned to beare armour, and the Prior of the Carmelite Friers of our Lady of Tolouse, hauyng a Banner of our Ladye in Golde set in a fielde of siluer, displayed the same, prouoking thereby many to take armour.
About the second sonday in Lent, the Earles being fully fraught with bootie, prisoners, gold and siluer, they returned towardes Burdeaux, where Iohn de Valoys eldest sonne to the French king, being accompanyed with a great number of hyred Dutche souldiours, besieged the Towne of Agnlowne, and the Captaines thereof the Earle of Stafforde and other so entrenched the same Towne, that without greate daunger, the Englishmen coulde haue no accesse vnto them: but the Earle of Darby bet awaye them that besieged the Citie, and soones new victualled the same, notwithstanding they were not able to raise the siege, bycause they hadde so entrenched themselues without the towne, who refusing to fight in the fielde, would aunswere, that they came not to pitch a fielde, but to besiege a Town: wherefore they continued the same siege vntil the decollation of Saint Iohn, but vnderstanding then that the King of England chaced his Father Phillip very sore at Grecie, and fearing, that he shoulde come verye late to the ayde of hys Father, he gaue vppe the siege, setting all his tentes on fire, and fled in the darke, but the Earle of Stafforde wyth hys power pursued them, cut off theyr tayle, tooke a greate manye of theyr horsses, and prisoners, and retourned.
After this certaine bowmen are mustered in England, appointed to be sente ouer sea, who commyng ouer, are layde in garrison fordefence of the Countrey.
Also twenty thousande sackes of Wooll are graunted to the king.
Moreouer Geffrey de Harecourte a Norman, came to the King, requiring ayd against the French king, who wrongfully withhelde hys landes from him: at his first comming he did fealtie, and sware homage to king Edward, but afterward he reuolted.
Thomas of Hatfielde the Kings Secretary, by meanes of the Kyngs letters to the Pope was admitted Byshoppe of Durham, and when certaine of the Cardinalles sayde, that the sayd Thomas was a light person, and a lay man, the Pope answered, truly if the king of England at this time had made his request for an Asse, he should haue obteined it.
The same yeare dyed Adam Tarleton, Bishop of Winchester, that had bin long time blind, after whome succéeded William Edendon, Treasourer of England.
This man founded the Monasterie of Edendon, the religious bréethren whereof were called Bonhomes.
The same yeare dyed Henry Earle of Lancaster, father to Henry Earle of Darby, and was buryed at Leycester, in the Monasterie of Channons, the King, and both the olde and yong Quéenes being present, with Archbishops, Bishops, Earles and Barons, in manner of all the lande, whose sonne was then in Gascoigne doing chiualrous actes.
This yeare, the Scottes to the number of thirtie thousande, William Dowglas being their leader, entred into Westmerland, and brent Carelile, Penreth, with many other Townes, wherefore the Bishop of Carelile, with Thomas Lucy, Robert Ogle, and a great number, compassed them in the night season, and with lightes and noyse so disquieted them, that they neuer durst go out for victuals, nor giue their bodyes to sléepe, but at the last Alexander Stragan stoutely prepared to go out for victualles, whome the Bishop and Robert Ogle mette, and with a speare thrust him through the body, so that the Scottes were soone after ouercome and slayne.
This yeare was the first co~gregating, and first Custos or gardian of the fraternitie of the Grocers in the Citie of London elected.
The Earle of Northampton, and the other Lordes in Briteine committed certayne Castels wonne by them in Briteine, to the safekéeping of faithfull Captaynes and Souldioures, and then returned into England.
King Edward prepared to make a voyage into Normandy, his Nauie being readie to transport him from Portesmonth and Porchester, with the Earles of Northampton, Arundell, Warwike, Harecourt, Huntingdon; Oxenforde, and Suffolke, the Bishop of Durham, and Mayster William Killesby Clerke, euery one of these leading a great armie of Souldioures, well appoynted, were embarqued, and wayted for the winde, from the first of June, to the fifth of July, and then hauing a good winde, they beganne to make Sayle with the number of one thousande Shippes of burthen and Pinaces, and on the thirtéenth day of July, they landed at Hogges in Normandy, where on the shore of the Sea, King Edwarde made his eldest sonne Knighte, and also Prince of Wales, and immediately the Prince made Knightes, Mortimere, Montacute, Rose, and other.
That night the King lodged in the Towne of Hogges, and the next day the Towne was brent by the Armie.
The night following, King Edward lodged in Mercels, where he stayde fiue dayes, during whiche time, all the Countrey, with the Towne of Barbefleete, was by his men consumed with fire.
From thence they departed to Veloygus, which they set a fire: then they went to Senet combe de Mount, whiche is nigh the Sea, and to Garantam, thence to Serius, and to Saint Lewes, passing along vnto the Towne of Turney, wasting all with fire, and that night the Kyng lodged at Carmalin, then to Gerin, being a Religious house belonging vnto Cane, leauing nothing behinde them vnspoyled.
Afterward they made an assaulte, and entred the Citie of Cane, making their entrance by a Bridge whiche was strongly defended.
There was slayne an hundreth thrée and fortie Knightes, among the whiche was the Earles of Ewe, and Camberlin de Tankeruill, with dyuers other Captaynes, whyche were sente into England, and the Lady Abatesse of Cane: and of them of the Citie, were slayne aboue one thousande thrée hundred.
At this Citie the armie remayned sixe dayes, and the spoyle thereof they solde to those Marriners whiche followed the coast as the King went.
Then they wente to the Monasterie in the Towne of Toward, a very strong thyng, and well defended.
Afterwarde, they came vnto Argons by nighte, burning still as they wente, till they came to the Citie of Licens, where they founde the Cardinalles of Clarimount, and of Naples, and one Archbishop, who offered the King a treatie of peace, and there the King continued thrée dayes, refusing to treate of peace.
Then they wente to Lestentnoland, and to the Towne of Briue, and lodged at New Burge, and after at Selelefe vpon Sayne, and there the Welchmen amme through the water of Segan, and béeing resisted by the inhabitantes, they slewe many of them.
Then they passed nigh to the Towne and Castell of Pount Darch, béeing strong places, and not sautable.
Thys nighte he lodged at Lury vpon Segan, nigh vnto the good Towne of Louars, whiche they did burne.
After, they passed by the Towne and Castell of Gaylon, whiche they tooke, and brente, and lodged at Lingeuie, whiche is nigh the good Towne and Castell of Vernon, whiche they touched not, and there they first entred into France, and the same night they brente the Castell of Roche Blanche, whiche standeth on the other side of Segan, and lodged at Fremble vpon Segan.
After that, they passed by the Towne de Maunt, lodging that night at Oporne.
On the nexte day they passed to Frigmas, and the nexte daye to the good Towne of Poecie, where béeyng a Bridge to passe ouer the Riuer of Segan, the Frenche had spoyled it, but the Kyng caused it to bée reedifyed: and the nexte daye they came vnto Amias, where were thrée greate Armies appoynted to kéepe the King from passing that way: but hée making a greate conflicte with them, slewe thrée hundreth of them at the firste charge, put the residue to flighte, and spoyled their Tentes, burning thrée hundreth and two Cartes and· Wagons lade~ with Crossebowes, Quarels, Armor, victuals: the King staying there two dayes, they went to Gresile nigh vnto Pountoys, then to Antell: the next day they passed by the Citie of Wenneys, which they touched not, and so by at the water of Some where they lodged.
The next day they wan the Towne of Poys, and brent the Castell.
From thence they went to Aregnus, then to Achen, where they lodged.
The next day they came to Noell vpon the Sea side: the Frenchmen of Dabuile and the Countrey came to the frdes side to hinder their passage, with whome the King had a sore conflict, but the enimies were put to the worsse, and more than two thousand slayne, and the Towne of Croytoy taken and brent, and aboue thrée hundred Germanes slayne.
The next day they followed the King on the Riuer of Some, and on the banckes side where the King with his host were lodged, came trauelling Phillip de Valoys the French king, with the Kings of Boheme and Malegre, leading an army of men innumerable, deuided into eight great battels.
King Edward sent to the French King, offering him frée passage ouer the Foorde, if he would come and choose a place apt to fight a field in: but this Phillip would not fight, but went to another place of passage.
On the morrow King Edward remoued to Cresifield, where ye armie of the French King met him.
The King therefore set his sonne the Prince of Wales to gouerne the vaward: The middle warde the Earle of Northampton: The third he tooke to guide himselfe.
The army of the Frenchmen were deuided into nine troupes.
The French King commaunded his banner called Oliflam to be set vp, after which time it was not lawfull vnder payne of death to take any man to saue his life.
This banner, that it might differ from his standard, had in it Lillies of gold very broade.
On the other side, King Edward commanded his Banner to be erected of the Dragon, which signified fiercenesse, and crueltie to be turned against the Lillies.
These armies being thus appoynted, stoode in the fielde from one of the clocke, vntill the euening.
Aboute the Sunne setting, after the armies had iusted, they beganne by sound of Trumpettes to giue signe of battayle, but they themselues felt the force of the English Archers, and as for their Quarels, they fell short a great way.
Moreouer, their footemen being placed among their owne horsemen, were by them (when they were gaulled with the English shotte of arrowes) ouerrunne and troden vpon, that a great outcrie was made as it were to the Starres, and the whole forme of the array was broken, and they fighting with the English armed men, are beaten downe with Poleaxes.
In this so terrible a bickering, the Prince of Wales being then but sixtéene yeares olde, shewed his wonderfull towardnesse, laying on very hotely with Speare and Shield.
This battell dured thrée partes of the night, in the which time the Frenchmen gaue fiue great assaultes againste oure men, but at the length they being conquered, ranne away.
On the morrow, there came four armies of fresh Souldioures to the French side, and making semblant as though their part had suffered no harme, they come against the Englishmen, and gaue them a fresh battayle.
On the other side, the Englishmen withstoode them very stoutely, and after a sharp conflict they forced their foes to flie, and in chacing of them togither with them that were slayne in the conflict, they slew thrée thousand men in the sayd two dayes.
There were slayne in the battayle of Crecy, the Kings of Boheme and of Maiorica, the Archbishop of Zanxinus, the Bishop of Noyone, the Dukes of Lorayne, and Burbon, the Earles of Alanson, Harecourt, Awmarle, Sauoy, Nois, Mountbilliard, Niuars, and of Flanders, with the graund Priour of the Hospitall of France, and foure thousand men of armes, beside common souldioures without number.
The third day after, King Edward passed by the Abbey of Mounteney, and the next day they came to the Towne of Mountney, and from thence to the Nunrie of Saint Ioce, and after they passed ouer a Foorde, and came to Newcastell, where they stayde two dayes, and from thence they came to Caleis, which presently they entrenched to beséege, being the fourth day of September.
The French King in this meane time sent a number of Genoways, and other hired Souldiours, vnto Dauid King of Scottes, earnestly requesting him that he would inuade England with all his force: wherefore about the seauenth of October, he with a mightie power entred England, passing along by Berwike, which was strongly defended by the Englishmen, and so ranging ouer the Forrest of Alnewike, they wonne a certayne Mannour place called Luden, belonging to the Lord Walter Wake, who yéelded himselfe on condition to be ransomed, where Selby a Knight, béeing desirous by law of armes to saue his life, he was taken, which when it was knowne to Dauid, he commanded him to be slayne: but Selby intreated for him, that he mought bée brought aliue to the presence of Dauid, who hauing obteyned his request, he falleth downe before Dauid, requesting his life for raunsome, but he was agayne adiudged to dye.
The malice of the Tirant was suche, that he commaunded two of the children of the poore Knight to bée strangled in sight of their father, and afterwarde himselfe béeing almost madde for sorrow, was beheaded.
From thence the Scottes passed forwarde, wasting along the Countrey, wherein were many Farmes belonging to the Monasterie of Durham, and comming within two miles of Durham, they tooke certayne of the Monkes, which they kept prisoners for their raunsome, making couenant with the residue for a certayne summe of money and corne to redéeme theyr Mannoures from spoyling.
The Englishmen of the Marches fléeing before the face of the enimie, William de la Zouch, Archbishop of Yorke, Uizegerent to the King in the Marches, calling togither the Bishop of Carelile, the Earle of Anguise, the Lord Mowbrey, the Lord Percy, the Lord Neuell, and other of the North, with all their ayde, togither with the Archers of Lancashire, went towards the armie of the Scottes, and on the euen of Saint Luke, mette them at a place called Bewre Parke, Neuels Crosse.
The Scottish Nation not accustomed to flée, withstoode them stoutly, and hauing Headpéeces on their heads, and Targets on their armes, preasing sore vpon the Englishmen, they abode the brunt of the Archers: but the men of armes which were in the forefronts, gaue their enimies many deadly woundes.
The Marshall of the Scottes, Earle Patrike, who had the charge of the rereward, when he perceyued his men to be beaten downe, he fledde away with other that were priuie to his cowardlinesse: he being fled, the residue of the Scottes continuing faithfully with theyr King, stoode about him like a round Tower, kéeping hym in the middle, who so continued till there was scarse fortie of them left aliue, of the which not one of them coulde escape away.
At length, Dauid their King béeing taken prisoner by Iohn Copland, the residue aboute him béeing taken or· slayne, the Englishmen pursued the chace after them whiche were fledde, slaying and taking them as farre as Prudihow and Corbridge.
In this great battayle were taken Dauid de Bruse King of Scottes, the Earle of Mentife, the Earle of Fife, the Lorde Maleolin Fleming, the Earle Wixton, William Dowglas, William de Lemingstone, Walter de Halliburton, Iohn Dowglas, Dauid de Anade, Iohn de Saint Clere, William Mowbray, Dauid Fitz Robert, William de Ramsey, Adam Moygne, Iohn Stewarde, Roger de Kirkpatrike, Iohn Hume, Wil. Morrey knights, Iames Sudelflour, Iames Loren, Henry Delker Baronets.
There were slaine in this battell the Earle of Morife, the Earle of Straterne· also Alex. Stragy, Iohn de Haliburton, Hen· de Ramsey, Naso de Ada~ Nilkenson, Thomas Boid, Iohn Stiward, Allen Stiward, Dauid Delahay, Edward Kethe, Iohn Crawford, Iohn de Kindesey, Philip de Maldre~, Hen. Ramsey, Alex. Morey, Hum. de Boys, Gil.
Inchmarten, Robert Maltallent, and his brother Humfrey Kirkepatrike, Iohn Strange, and Patrike Hearing Knightes.
There were many slayne in the chase, but there were no more coate armours found in the mayne battayle than we haue reckned.
The prisoners were conuayde to London about Christmas, Dauid le Bruce except, which might not trauell by reason of two deadly woundes in his head with arrowes, but the seconde of January he was brought vp, and conuayed from Westminster to y^
Tower of London, in sight of all the people, and there lodged in the blacke nouke of the sayd Tower, néere to the Connestables gard, there to be kept.
While these things were done in England, the King was busied at the séege of Calleys, which Towne is scituated in the marches of Artoys, being closed aboute with a double wall, and a double ditche, hard on the shore of the Englishe Sea, right ouer against the Castell of Douer.
And there is longing to the same Towne an Hauen, wherein Shippes may lie very safe withoute danger.
This Towne was sometime with the Castell thereof very strongly built by the force and valiantnesse of the Romanes, for after that Iulius Caesar had broughte all France vnder his subiection, hée built Calleys in Artoys, and the Castell of Chipstowe in Venedocia, or Southwales, and the Castel of Douer in Kent, what time he had conquered Britayne.
King Edward cast a ditch aboute his Camp, and layde his Nauie of Shippes against Caleis Hauen, to the intente that the Frenchmen should make no inuasions vpon his Souldioures, neyther they within receyue any victualles by water.
The Norman Pirats at sundry times tooke fiftéene of his Shippes, whereof some of them they caried away for their owne occupying, the other they brent, and Sir Thomas Haclut, with Sir William Borton Knights, as they were sailing into England, were taken prisoners on the Sea.
King Edward hauing fortified the séege, lay without giuing any assault, knowing that it was not possible to fight with his enimies without great losse of men, considering the deapth of the ditches, and heigth of the walles: neyther woulde he erect any engins againste the Towne, for there wanted firme grounde where vpon to place them.
Besides that, if he should beate downe the walles, yet were the ditches so déepe, and full of salt water, let in on euery side, that they were able to withstande all the world, with little strength and defence.
On that side of the Towne on which the Bolloners were wont to victuall Caleis, that is along on the Sea side, and especially when the Shippes could not be suffered to passe by Sea, but alongst the shore with small boates, the Earle of Northampton made a Rampire, wherewith he kept away and beate backe such boates, and afterwarde when the Admirall of France had purposed to come with his Shippes of warre to fight against our English Shippes that lay at the séege, thinking that in the meane time whilest they were a fighting, the small Boates should passe to Caleis with victualles, the sayd Earle of Northampton méeting with him valiantly, put him to flight.
This séege during in such sort, from the feast of the Natiuitie of our Lady, and all the whole winter, with a great part of the sommer, and still waxing stronger and stronger, on Monday next before the feast of Saint Iames, the Frenche King came to the Castell of Gysnes, with his eldest son Iohn, and the Kings sonne of Boheme, and a great power, to haue remoued the séege from Caleis.
Also the Emperour (promising by oth, that he would remoue the séege eyther by warre or peace, or at the least, he would victuall them that were beséeged) came with his armie towards the English Camp, and lodged scarse a mile from thence, requesting by messengers a treatie of peace.
He sent the Duke of Detenes, and the Earles of Bulone and Darminake, who parleing with the Duke of Lancaster, and the Earles of Northampton and Huntington, touching a truce, could not obteyne their consente, whervpon after they had exercised a little warlike iusting, they returned to their Tentes.
The second day following, the French King offered the King of England a day of battell, which the King on certayne conditions accepted very gladlye.
In the meane season, they which were beséeged, made knowne their state to the French King, by signes and tokens, for at his first comming, they within the Towne set vp his auntient on the chiefest Tower of the Castell, and also they set out Banners of the Dukes and Earles of France, and a little after the shutting in of the euening, they made a great light on the toppe of one of the highest Towers, which was towards the armie of the Frenchmen, and therewithall they made a greate shoute and noyse wyth Trumpets and Drommes: the second night they made the like, but somewhat lesse: the third night a very small fire, giuing forth therewith a sorrowfull voyce, signifying thereby that their strength touching the kéeping of the Towne, was quite spent and done: and the same night they tooke in all their flagges and antients, except their Standart.
At the last, the day of battayle drew on, against which tyme, there came out of England and Dutchland, toward the helpe of King Edwarde, seauentéene thousande fighting men, wherevpon the French King betimes in the morning of the second day of August, making fire in his Tentes, he fledde, whose tayle the Duke of Lancaster, and Earle of Northampton cutting off, they slewe and tooke many of them.
When they of Caleis perceyued thys, they tooke their Standart downe, and with greate sorrow cast it from the Tower downe into the ditch, and on the Saterday following, Iohn de Vienna their Captayne, a man very skilfull in warlike affayres, opening the gates of the Towne, came out to the King of England, sitting on a little nagge, for that he being lame on his féete could not well goe, with an halter about his necke, with the other burgesses and souldiours following on foote, bare headed, and bare footed, hauing halters about their neckes.
The Captayne comming thus before the King, offered him a warlike sword, as vnto the chiefest Prince of armes amongst all Christian Kings, and as one that had taken that Towne from the mightiest Christian King by noble cheualrie.
Then he deliuered to him the keyes of the Towne.
Thirdly, he requesting of him pitie, asked pardon, and deliuered him the sword of peace, wherewith he should giue right iudgement, spare and forbeare the humble and lowly, and chasten the proude harted.
The King receyuing that which was offered him, sente the Captayne with fiftéene Knightes, and as many burgesses into England, enriching them with large giftes.
The common sort of people, and such as he found in the towne, being somewhat refreshed with the Kings almes, he commanded to be safe conducted to the Castell of Guisnes.
After the taking of the Towne of Caleis, the Souldiours at the Kings commandemente tooke the Mannour of Markes, and of Hoy, and with great difficultie they built in them Fortes, setting in order where walles wanted Hoggesheads filled with stones against the enimies, whilest the walles were a building within.
Immediately after the taking of Caleis, there began in those partes a generall pestilence of the Flix, co~ming fro~ the East partes, into many other partes of the world, wherevpo~ it came to passe, that a great multitude of people died.
This pestilence gaue occasion y^ certayne Cardinals were sent on ye behalfe of the French King, to craue a truce from that time, vnto the feast of Saint Barnabe next following, which was agréed vpon on the
The truce being take~ as afore is said, K. Edward built a Castel at Risbanke, betwixt ye towne of Caleis, and the Haue~s mouth, to the intent to kéepe off all ye enimies force of ships fro~ the said towne: and he made Captaine of the towne Sir Iohn Mongomery, and thence conueying the Quéene his eldest sonne, with a great company of noble men, he tooke hys iourney towardes Englande by water, and béeyng on the Sea, he was beaten with suche a Tempest, that hée lost many of his Shippes, and hardly escaped himselfe, notwithstanding he came on land the fourtéenth of October, and came to London.
This peace being made, it séemed through England as a new Sommer had followed, bycause of the plentie of all things, for there was no woman of any name, but she had some of the prises of Cane and Caleis, or of other Cities beyonde the Seas, whereof the matrones being proude, did bragge in French matrones apparell.
At the feast of Easter, Iames Dowglas, who was taken at Durham in the warres, and brought to London wyth the King of Scottes, was licenced to departe home agayne, swearing to the King peace and fealtie, who afterwarde liuing peaceably in the marches, and being requested by William Dowglas to ride a hunting with him, was by him comming behind his backe most trayterously slayne.
After Easter, the King held a Counsell, wherein it was decréed that none of his seruantes should take vp any victualles of any man against his will, nor but that he payde for it ready money, vpon payne to be punished and banished the Courte, Richarde Talbot high Stewarde of the Kings house being appoynted to fée execution of that Proclamation.
The Earle of Ments was racked, areigned, and conuicted, for that contrary to his faith and homage sworne to the King of Englande, he did againe beare armes agaynste him, and for that fact he was drawne, hanged, and quartered.
To this Counsell came two Earles and two Clearkes sente from the Princes electours, signifying that their election was made to the King, for the dignitie of the Kingdome of Almayne.
These messengers the Kyng receyued with due honour, but aunswered them, that hée woulde not take so great honour vppon hys shoulders, vntill hée had the Crowne of France, due vnto him, in peaceable possession.
little after Easter, there were great Justings holden at Lincolne by the Duke of Lancaster, where were presente many Ladyes, with the Countesse, and also certayne messengers sente from the King of Spayne, for the Lady Ioane, daughter to the King, that should be maryed to their Mayster the Kings sonne, whome hir husbande méeting, she dyed of the great Pestilence, so that he followed hir to the graue.
The same yeare, King Edward with his eldest sonne the Earle of Warwike, and the Bishop of Winchester went to Caleis, from whence the King sente the Duke of Lancaster to Denemere, to receyue in his behalfe fealtie and homage of the Earle of Flanders thing was by the sayd Earle perfourmed.
There beganne amongst the East Indians and Tartarians a certayne Pestilence, which at length waxed so generall, infecting the middle region of the ayre so greatly, that it destroyed the Sarasins, Turkes, Sirians, Palestinians, and the Gretians, with a wonderfull, or rather incredible death, in so much that those peoples béeing excéedingly dismayde with the terrour thereof, consulted amongst themselues, and thought it good to receyue the Christian Faith and Sacramentes, for they had intelligence that the Christians whiche dwelte on this side the Gréekish Sea, were not so greatly (more than common custome was) troubled wyth sicknesse and mortalitie.
At length this terrible slaughter passed ouer into those Countreys which are on this side the Alpes, and from thence to the partes of France which are called Hesperia, and so by order along into Germany and Dutchland.
And the seauenth yeare after it beganne, it came into England, and first beganne in the Townes and Ports ioyning on the Sea coastes, in Dorsetshire, where, euen as in other Countreys, it made the Countrey quite voyde of inhabitantes, so that there were almost none left aliue.
From thence it passed into Deuonshire, and Somersetshire, euen vnto Bristowe, and raged in suche sort, that the Glocestershiremen woulde not suffer the Bristowmen to haue anye accesse vnto them, or into their Countrey by anye meanes: but at length it came to Gloceor, yea and to Oxforde, and London, and finally it spread ouer all England and so wasted and spoyled the people, that scarce the tenth person of all sortes was lefte aliue: when Church yardes were not sufficiente and large ynough to burie theyr dead in, they chose certayne Fields appoynted for that purpose.
Gualter Mayny, Lord of Mayny, borne in Cambray, who serued in company of Henry Duke of Lancaster in his great actes of Gaseoyne and after this time made Knight of the Garter in England, hauing a respect to the danger that might fall in time of this Pestilence then begonne in England, if the Churches and in London might not suffise to bury the multitude, he purchased a péece of ground called Spittle Croft (for that it belonged to the Mayster and bréethren of Saint Barthelmewes Spittle) conteyning thirtéene acres and a rodde, without the barres of Weast Smithfield and caused the same to be enclosed, and dedicated by Ralph Bishop of London, in the which place in the yeare following, was buryed more than fiftie thousand persons, as is affirmed by the Kings Charters which haue séene, and also by an inscription fixed on a stone crosse in the same place.
And in memorie thereof, the same Gualter Mayny caused vpon the same grounde a Chappell to be builded, and after founded the same to be an house of Charterhouse Monkes.
Also about the same time, one Iohn Cory, procured of Nicholas Prior of the Church of the Holy Trinitie néere vnto one tost of ground néere vnto East Smithfield, for the buriall of them that dyed, that it mought be called the Church yard of the Holy Trinitie· which ground he caused to be enclosed, and dedicated by Nicholas Northbroke Bishop of London, in the which place· King Edward the third, by consent of the sayd Prior and Couent, founded the Abbey of Saint Mary of Grace in the yeare
placing therein an Abbot and Monke of the order of Cisteaux, whiche were white Monkes, and named the place Eastminster.
All sutes and pleading in the Kings Bench, and other places, for a season ceassed.
Uery fewe noble men dyed, among whome departed Iohn Mountgomery, and his Lady: the Lord Clisteles Captayne of Caleis dyed at Caleis, and was buryed in the white Friers at London.
Of the common people, togither with Religious and Clearkes, there dyed an innumerable sorte, for no man but God onely knewe how many.
There dyed from the first of January, to the first of July, in the Citie of Norwich
There was buryed in the Church and of Yermouth, in one yeare
men and women, before which time the Personage there was worth
markes by yeare, and afterwardes was scarse worth fortie pounde the yeare.
This note was certified to King Henry the seauenth, in the of his raigne, and the same is written on the gates of the Church of Yermouth.
This great Pestilence began at London about the feast of All Sainctes, in y^ yeare
What time this Pestilence had wasted all England, ye Scots· greatly reioycing, mocked sware by the vile death of y^
Englishmen, but y^ sword of Gods wrath departing fro~ thence, slew co~sumed the Scots in no lesse nu~bers, than it did the other.
It also wasted the Welchmen, and within a while passed ouer into Ireland, where it destroyed a great nu~ber of English people that dwelt there, but suche as were right Irishmen borne, y^ dwelt in the hilly countreys, it scarcely touched, so that few of the~ died therof.
This plague co~tinued sometime in one place, sometime in another, vntill the yeare of our Lord
The same yeare for a truce or finall peace to be concluded, the B. of Norwich, the Earle of Northampton, the Earle of Stafford, Richard Talbot, Walter Mayny Knightes, sayled ouer the Sea into France, whom y^
Frenchmen met peaceably, but they would not agrée to a nall peace, vnlesse that Caleis were restored to the~ againe, which would not be granted: and the truce whiche was taken for a yeare was so continued.
But the Earle of Flanders, who would not in any case receyue conditions of peace, vnlesse the French King were quite forsaken, notwithstanding his solemne oth, not long after entred into Flanders with a great power of Frenchmen, burning and killing where euer he came: but the people of the Countrey with a few Englishmen withstoode him stoutely, and gaue him a sore skirmish, in the which, beside that many Frenchmen were slayne, the Earle himselfe was forced to flie, for the whiche worthy acte, many Knightes were made, amongst the which was Iohn de Filebert, and English man.
In the feast of the Natiuitie of Saint Iohn, the Quéene was purified at Windesore, where were solemne Iustes, and running at the Tilt, at the which, Dauid King of Scottes was present, and the Earle of Ewe, the Lord Tankeruill, Lord Charles de Valoys, and many other Strangers captiues, who by the Kings licence were permitted to runne also at the Tilte, at the which pastime the price of the field was adiudged to the Earle of Ewe.
After in Sommer season, these Strangers passed their time in hunting, in the company of the King, and other nobles of the Realme, at Claringdon in Wiltshire nigh Salisburie, and in diuers other Forrestes.
Whiles the King was thus occupyed, the Frenchmen notwithstanding the truce, entred the marches of Britaine, but the sonnes of Sabater, with a few other, who went out a forraging, tooke Thomas Dagworth Knight, a man of great experience, who but with a few men, to wéete, sixtéene armed men, entred the woodde against these robbers, and inuaded them, slaying to the number of thrée hundred, but at the length being stricken fiue times in the face with Quarels, all his men being first slayne, he himselfe was thrust through the body with a sword.
persons of Sealande, and Hollande, comming through Flaunders vnto London, sometime in the Church of Saint Paule, sometyme in other places of the Citie, twice in the day, in the sighte of all people, from the loynes, vnto the héeles, couered in lynnen clothe, all the rest of their bodies being bare, hauing on theyr heades hats with red crosses before and behinde, euery one in their right handes a whip with thrée cordes, eache corde hauing a knotte in the middest, beat themselues on theyr bare bloudie bodies going in procession, foure of them singing in theyr owne language, all the other aunswering them.
The same yeare the Earle of Lancaster, the Barons of Stafforde and Greystocke, also the heires of the Lordes Percy and Neuel, and the Lord Burniual, with Barthelmew Burwash, and diuerse other, about the feast of passed ouer sea into Gascoign, to delay the furious vprore that Iohn de Valoys sonne to the French king had made in that dukedome; greatly spoyling and wasting the same.
Also the kings counsel ordained, that none of the kings Justices during the time of their offices, shoulde receyue any fée, gift, or reward of any man, except it were of the king himselfe.
Also thys yeare in the Countie of Oxforde, nyghe vnto a towne called Chippingnorton, there was founde a Serpent hauing two heades, and faces like women, and being shaped after the newe tyre of that time: another after the manner of the old attyre, and it had great wings, after the manner of a Flyndermouse or Bat.
About the feast of kyng Edwarde beyng accompanyed with the Earle of Lancaster, and Southfolke, and diuerse others, passed ouer the seas into Flaunders, and the~ce leading his armie towardes Fraunce, the French men made meanes vnto him to renewe their truce: and nowe the Earle of Flaunders submitted himselfe the thirde time vnto the kings mercie and dominion.
Then the king returning toward Englande, to solemnizate the translation of S. Thomas the Confessour and Bishoppe of Hereforde, dyd wyth his presence and Nobilitye honoure the same, to the greate expences of Nicholas Cantulupus Baron, and cousin to the sayde Saint Thomas: during whiche feaste and solemnitie, it was signified to the King by the Secretaries of Emericus of Padua, who was a féed manne to the king of Englande, that on the fourtéenth day of Januarie nexte comming, Geffrey Cherney Knight, and manye other Frenche men shoulde be receyued into Caleis, vnto whom the sayd towne was solde by the sayde Emericus: but the Towne beyng presentlye rescued by king Edwarde, the sayde Emericus of Padua with other Genoways co~tinued in Caleis, beyng maintayned there at the costes of the Frenche king againste the king of Englande, when he besieged it, who also after the yéelding of it to the King of England, being pardoned bothe of life and lymme, from thenceforth continued and dwelte as a féed man of the kyngs in the sayde Towne for the defence thereof.
At that tyme the sayde Geffrey was Lorde of Matas, a man more skylfull in warfare than anye Frenche man in Fraunce.
Wherefore he was greatelye estéemed, euen to the time of his death.
This craftie deuiser indeuored by his letters, wherin he made promise of large giftes of golde, and other sophisticall perswasitions, quite to subuert the fayth and loyaltie of the sayde Emericus.
Finally, thys craftie deuiser agréed with this false man, that for twentie thousande French crownes he shoulde lette in the Frenche menne to the Towne, and as muche as laye in hym, delyuer vppe to the Frenche menne both the Towne and Castell.
This bargaine being most traytorously, made by othe and breaking of ye Sacrament betwixt them, yet all this notwythstanding, he wrote letters vnto the Kyng touching the state of the whole matter, but verye priuilye, howe that hée was readie to shewe friendshippe to the Frenche menne, yet meanyng to make frustrate theyr purpose, whereby they shoulde be conuicted of breakyng the truce, and also manye of them shoulde be taken to bée raunsomed, wherefore kyng Edwarde spéedilye passed ouer, beyng accompanyed wyth hys eldest Sonne, the Earle of Marche, and a fewe other, commyng before the tyme appoynted for the yéeldyng of the Towne certayne dayes.
Therefore hée beyng come to Callayes, hée sayde certayne men of armes wythin the Uaultes whyche were betwixte the outter gate and the inner parte of the Castell, buyldyng a thinne and stender Wall before them newelye sette vppe, not made of Playster, but of matter, whyche ioyned to the other Wal, craftilye deuised and made like the olde worke, so that no manne woulde Judge that that anye were enclosed therin.
Also he caused the maynepostes of the drawe bridge to bée sawed almoste in sunder, yet in suche sort, that horssemen mighte ryde ouer it: and for the purpose he hadde a greate stone, whiche was layde vppe in a hole made in forme of an Arche, beyng in the foreparte of the hangyng ouer the Bridge, in whyche hée appoynted a Faythfull Souldiour should bée in the tyme to throwe downe· the sayde stone vppon the Bridge, that wyth the fall thereof, the Bridge beyng halfe cutte in two, should be broken in sunder, and so that hole where the stone was layde, shoulde bée wrought in suche sorte, that hée wythin shoulde perceiue throughe the hole howe manye dyd enter in were made priuie to this practise, neyther did many knowe of the kings presence or of the prince of Wales, who when they had wroughte thys feate, secretely conueyed themselues into the Towne.
The daye before the tyme of delyuerie of thys Towne, Geffrey Cherney fifteene of his faithfullest menne wyth the ga parte of the golde whiche was to be payde, who shoulde also the faythe of Emericus, and the order of the Castell, who searching euery where, in euery Tower and corner whiche they could finde open, coulde perceyue nothing contrarie to theyr lykyng, wherevpon on the next day in the morning, they set vp the French kings standerde in the highest Towre of the Castell, and the auntientes also of Geffrey, and of other Lordes vpon other Towers and places.
Then the people of the Town who kept common watch and warde, not knowing of this secrete deuice, were gretly terrifyed therwith, in so muche that they taking weapon in hande, beganne to giue a charge against the Castell: by and by the French men who hadde entred the day before, toke Thomas Kingstone, then fléeing awaye, quite ignoraunt of that whiche was deuised, and forceably they set him in the stockes.
Then certaine of them being sent out to the French men their companions and maisters, who laye without in ambushes shewed them the auntients and standerd set vp, and all to be well, euen as they woulde haue it, hastning them forwarde to come to the defence of the Castell, againste the townes men: wherfore they rysing from their lorking places, aduaunced themselues in pride and bragging, and came by heapes in at the gates of the Castell.
The townes men perceyuing this, had muche adoe to forebeare their handes from them, had not their chiefe leaders withdrawen them from it, least some daunger should haue happened to them that laye hid: by and by those that laye hid closed vnder the Arches of the Walles, prepared themselues to breake out vpon their enimies.
In like sorte also he that with the great stone man shut vp in the hole, after that he sée so many entred in· éeming that his fellowes were sufficient to ouerthrowe with that great stone put to his custodie hée brake the drawe bridge, by the whiche the enemies had entred in, but being once in, coulde not goe that waye out againe: when the stone was thus downe, and had discharged the thing for the which it was layde vp, the French men deceiued by that pollicy, they wer enclosed safe ynough.
At the noyse of this stone and the bridge that brake, these armed men of whom before spake, breaking downe their counterfaite wall, behinde the which all the deceyte was hyd, they presently set themselues in order to inuade the French men, bidden to a bitter breakfast.
The conflict was sharp for a good season, but at the length the enimies being ouercome, yéelded themselues to the plesure of the conquerours.
They which were without and had not entred, as soone as they perceyued theyr companions to be deceyued, fled, after whome the king with scarce sixtéene men of armes and as many Archers followed a pace, the runnawayes not knowing what company woulde followe them: many in thys chase were wearied, and many moe slaine, and in a small time the king ouercame daungerous and great labours: but at length, when it was vnderstoode by them that fledde, howe fewe there were that chased them, fourescore armed men turned them against the king.
dare not ascribe thys boldnesse of the king in chasing of his enimies, to hys wisedome, but only to the of his minde, the whiche is wel knowen through Gods grace to be brought to good effect by his meanes, though the daunger were neuer so gret: for when he perceyued that the French men had turned the~selues to withstande him, he caste away the scaberde of hys sword, and comforting his men about him, setting them in good order, exhorted them to play the men lustily.
The Archers being placed in the Marche against the sides of the enimies stoode on dry Hilles, which were compassed aboute with and foggie places, that neyther horssemen nor footemen might approch them, but they should rather be drowned in mud than come néere to hurt them: these also did the king comfort, saying to them (doe well you Archers) play the men lustily, and knowe that am Edwarde of Windsor.
Then the presence of the king, and necessitie of the matter, styrred vp theyr hartes to doe well: the Archers vncouering theyr heades, stripping vp theyr sléeues, bente themselues to bestow theyr arrowes in such sort that they might not be loste: and as the French men drewe towardes the~, they saluted the~ after with their arrowes.
The armed men of both partes stoode in order to fighte vppon a long and narrowe causewaye, the bredth whereof was not able to receiue scarce twentie men of armes in a fronte, hauing on both sides thereof the Marishe, in the whiche the Archers were placed, who gauled and wounded theyr enimies on the sides, fléeing as thicke as hayle.
The kyng and his men before, wyth the Archers on the side, slewe and tooke a greate manye: and manye of them stoode stoutlye to it, till at the length by the comming of the Prince of Wales, the Frenche were putte to flighte: after a long chase in pursuing the enimies, they returning backe againe to Caleis, numbred those which were fledde, as well as those whiche were taken, and they founde, that for the taking of the Castell (as the prisoners reported) there came a thousand men of armes, and sixe hundred armed men, but they which serued, were aboue thrée thousand: among the~ which were taken, was Geffrey Charney and his sonne, Edwarde de Renty, Robert Danquile, Otto de Gulo, the Baron of Martingham, Baldyne Saylly, Henrie de Prees, Garinus Baylofe, Peter Renel, Peter Dargemole, Eustace de Riplemount and manye other, Lordes, Knightes, and Baronets, who were chased and ranne away with theyr auntientes, as the Lorde de Mountmarice, also Laundas, who maried the Lady Saint Paule Countesse of Penbroke in England· also ye Lord Fenas, the Lorde Planckes, and another Eustace de Replemount.
There were slaine in the skirmish the Lord Henrie de Boys, the Lord Archibalde, many others, whose names the Conquerors were not able to certifie.
Thus by pollicie and deuised treason the aucthours therof came to death and destruction: neither Eustachius himselfe escaped scot frée fro~ the snares, for he within a while after being taken by the French men, was burned aliue with a hotte yron, and degraded fro~ the order of Knighthood by the cutting off his héeles, and depriuing of his tong by alsitio~: afterward, he was ha~ged vp, and laste of all beheaded and quartered, receyuing iust punishment for his treason and false forswearing.
This yeare the Lord giuing a rash enterprise vpon his enimies, was taken prisoner in Gascoign.
Not long after king Edwarde prepared to make a voyage into France, but the Earle of Lancaster, returning out of Gascoigne, signied that there was a truce taken by him, by reason whereof the passage prepared by the king was layde aside.
This yeare on Saint Georges day, the kiug held a great solemne feaste at his Castel of Windsor, where he had augmented the Chappell which Henrie the firste and other hys progenitors kings of England had before erected of eight Canons: he added to those eight Chanons, a Deane, fiftéene Chanons more, and. xxiiij. poore and impotent Knightes, with other ministers and seruauntes, as appeareth in his Charter, Dated the two and twentith of hys raigne.
Besides the king, there were other also that were contributors to the foundation of this Colledge, as followeth.
Al these togither with the King were clothed in gownes of Russet, poudered in gartiers blew, wearing the like garters also on their right legges, and mantels of blewe, with scutcheons of Saint George.
In this sort of apparell they being bareheaded, heard Masse, which was celebrat by Simon Islipe Archbishop of Canterburie, and the Bishops of Winchester and Excester, and afterwardes they went to the feaste, setting themselues orderlye at the Table for the honoure of the feast, which they named to be of Saint George the Martyre, and the chosing of the Knightes of the Garter.
In the Sommer following, variaunce rysing betwéene the fléetes of Englande and Spaine, the Spaniardes besette the Brytaine Sea, with foure and fortie great ships of warre, with the whiche they sonke ten English ships comming fro~ Gascoigne towardes Englande after they had taken and spoyled them, thus their former iniuries being reuenged, they entred into Sluce in Flaunders.
King Edwarde vnderstanding hereof, furnished his nauie of fiftie shippes and Pinaces, forecasting to méete wyth the Spaniardes in theyr returne, hauing in his companye the Prince of Wales, the Earles of Lancaster, Northampton, Warwicke, Salisburie, Arundale, Huntington, Glocester, and other Barons and Knightes with their seruauntes and Archers, and vpon the feast of the decolatio~ of Saint Iohna, about Euensong time, the Nauies met at Winchelsea, wher the great Spanish vessels surmounting our shippes and foystes, like as Castels to cotages, sharply our men, ye stone quarels flying fro~ the the tops, sore cruelly wounded our me~, who no lesse busie to fight alofe with launce and sword, with the foreward manfully defende themselues, at length our archers perced theyr Arbalisters with a further retch tha~ they coulde strike againe, and thereby compelled them to forsake their place, and caused other fighting from the Hatches to shade themselues with tables of the ships, and compelled them that threwe stones from the toppes, so to hyde the~, that they durst not shew theyr heads, but tumble down: then our men enfring ye Spanish Uessels with swords Halberds, killed those they met, wtin a whyle make voyd y^ vessels furnish them wyth English men, vntil they being beset with darknesse of the night, could not decern the. xxvij. yet remayning vntaken: our men cast ancker, studying of the hoped battayle, supposing nothing finished, whilest any thing remayned vndone, dressing the wounded, throwing the myserable Spaniards into the Sea, refreshing themselues with victualles and sléepe, yet committing the vigilant watche to the armed bande.
The night ouerpassed, the Englishe men prepared (but in vaine) to a new battayle, but when the sunne began to appeare, they viewing the seas, coulde perceyue no signe of resistaunce, for xxvij. shippes fléeing away by nighte, lefte xvij. spoyled in the euening, to the kyngs pleasure, but agaynste theyr wil.
The King returned into England with victorie and triumphe, the King preferred there.
noble ympes to the order of Knighthoode, greatlye bewayling the losse of one, to witte sir Richard Goldesborough Knight.
Thys yeare Phillippe de Valoys Frenche Kyng, deceased, and hys eldest Sonne Iohn was crouned.
Two hyred souldiours of the Kyng of Armenia, came into Englande, into the presence of the King, where they shewed the letters of the aforesayde King of Armenia, wherein it was signified that the one of them, to witte, Iohn de Viscount, a man borne in Cipres, had charged the other, that is Thomas de la Marche, a Frenche man borne, and bastarde sonne to Phillippe late King of Fraunce, saying that the sayde Thomas shoulde haue receyued of the Turkes a certaine some of Golde, for the betraying the armye of the Christians vnto the Emperour of the Turkes: and for the proofe of this slaunder, this Iohn chalenged a combat wyth the sayde Thomas, to be tryed by the iudgement of Edward King of Englande, and that by him (as by a moste worthy Prince,) all strife shoulde be ended.
For this therefore were these two worthy souldiours appointed to fight, which they performed within the listes of the Kings Pallace at Westminster, on Mondaye nexte following after the feaste of Saint Michael, where Thomas, in declaration of hys innocencie, in that he was accused of, ouercame his enimye, but yet killed him not, for he could not, bycause he was not able to wounde hym beyng so armed· with anye kynde of piercing weapon, except it were in hys face, whiche was bare.
For after that they hadde runne at the Tilte, and foughte on foote, as they were striuing togither on the grounde, wyth certaine prickes bothe shorte and sharpe, then called Gadlings, being closed in the ioyntes of hys righte Gauntlet, the sayde· Thomas strucke the sayde Iohn in the face, and sore wounded hym: but on the other side Iohn hadde no suche shorte kinde of weapon, wherewyth hée myght hurte Thomas face, and therefore cryed out aloude moste horribly, whervpon by the kings commaundemente the combatte was ended, and the victorie adiudged to Thomas, who gaue the sayde Iohn, being thus ouercome, to the Prince of Wales for a Captiue, and offered by his owne armoure to Sainte George, in Sainte Paules Churche at London, wyth greate deuotion.
These matters beyng thus finished, the Cipres· man is manumitted and fette at libertie as a frée man againe.
And Thomas thinking boldely to goe into the presence of his brother the Frenche King, toke hys iourney thyther, and at his comming, founde the sayde King and the nobilitie of Fraunce, greatlye offended, and in indignation against him, for that he agréed that the combat shoulde be tried before the King of England.
Wherefore Thomas thinking secretly with him+selfe howe to winne the false friendship of his brother, being desirous to shewe that therein hée hadde done well, among all other things he greatelye praysed the nobilitie of Edwarde and his worthy fame spredde ouer al the worlde, and also the iustice whiche he vsed in iudging, not accepting the person of the manne of Cipres, (yea thoughe he loued the Kyng himselfe verye well) neyther suffered him to be preferred before me, whiche am a Frenche manne, and brother, and friende to thée my Lorde Kyng of Fraunce· iudge ouer the sayde King Edwarde my aduersarie.
Also the Earle of Ewe hyghlye praysed the King of England, for that hée hadde receyued greate comforte and commoditye at hys handes during the tyme of hys Captiuitie in Englande, shewing also howe farre that good Kyng hadde banished enuie and hatred from hys hearte, who at a time of iustyng, beyng in the fielde at that exercise, and the Kyng also, was commaunded by the Kyng hymselfe to beare awaye the price and pricke from them all.
These commendations did the Frenche Kyng enuie at· and for indignation, he moste wickedlye commaunded the setters forthe of those prayses to be beheaded.
And for to colour the matter the better, he fayned that the Earle vsed too muche familiaritie with the Quéene his wife, and that his brother was guiltie of treason againste the king of Fraunce, bycause he committed his cause and the combat to be tryed by the iudgement of the king of Englande.
After he had thus murdered his brother, he tormented his wife to death by famine, who was daughter of the noble King of Boheme, lately slaine in battayle by Geffrey.
William Edington Bishoppe of Winchester, and treasurer of England, a wise man, caused a newe coyne called a Groate, and halfe Groate to be coyned, but these were of lesse wayght than the pence, called Esterlings, by reason wherof victualles and merchandice became the dearer thorough the whole realme.
After the Octaues of the Purification of our Lady, in a Parliament holden at Westminster, Henrie Earle of Lancaster was created Earle of Lincolne, Leicester, Derby, Grosmount and Ferrers, and Duke of Lancaster, vnto whome also was giuen great priuiledges, suche as neuer any Erle had before his time.
Also Lionel of Antwerpe the kings sonne is made Earle of in Irelande, Iohn of Gaunte his brother is made Earle of Richmonde, and Ralph Baron of Stafforde, is made Earle of Stafforde.
In the Lent following Walter de Maine, and Roberte Herle Captain of Caleis, rod into France, making gret praes and doing great domage, brought away gret store of beasts, shéepe, and swine, so that at Caleis a fat Cowe was scarcelye solde for sixtéene pence sterling.
About Easter the Duke of Lancaster departing from Caleis marched alongst the Sea coastes of Artoys, and Picardie, brent the suburbes of Bulloign, but assaulting the Town he preuayled not, for that only the ladders were too short.
Therefore he wasted the Cities of Tirwin, and the hauen, also the Townes of Fauconbridge and Staples, and in the same hauens he brent aboue.
After this brenning the Champion Countrey, he rode vnto Saint Omers, and winning by force manye Fortresses, with a great pray and many prisoners he returned to Caleis.
About the feast of Saint George things prospered wel in Gascoine, for the Marshal of France, with a greate number of armed men spoyled the Countrey about S. Dangel, where Edmond Rose a Norffolke man was Captayne, who with the garison, valiauntly encountred the enimies, flew many of them, and toke the sayde Marshal and manye other nobles of Fraunce, chasing aboue
The same yeare the Spanish shippes by a treatie of peace came into Englande, where the last yeare they were restrayned, but nowe a truce was taken for twentie yeares, betwixt England· and Spaine, and a truce betwixt Englande and Fraunce for one yeare, whiche the French men brake, by reason of taking the Castel of Guisnes, as in the next yeare shall be shewed.
About this season the old coine of gold was changed into a new, the olde Noble was worth muche aboue the taxed rate of the newe, and therfore the Marchauntes boughte the olde and conueyed them out of the Realme to the greate losse of the king and kingdome, to the whiche there was a remedie prouided, by the chaunging of the stampe.
About the beginning of Januarie, the French men béeing occupied about y^ repayring of ye wals of Guisnes town, being afore that time destroyed by the English men, some me~ of armes of Caleis vnderstanding their doings, deuised how they might ouerthrow the work, it was done in this sort.
There was an Archer named Iohn Dancaster, in prison in the Castel of Guisnes, before that time take~, who not hauing wherwith to pay his raunsome, was let lose, with condition that he shoulde worke there amongst the French men.
This fellow chaunced to lye with a Laundres, a strumpet, and learned of hir where beyond in the principal ditch, from the bottome, there was a· Wall made of two foote broade stretching from the bottome to the brimme of the ditche within forthe, so that being couered with Water it coulde not be séene, but not so drowned, but that a man going alofte theron, shoulde not be wette paste the knées, it beyng made for the vse of Fishers: and therefore in the middest it was discontinued for the space of two foote: and so the Archer (hys Harlot shewyng it to hym,) he measured the heygth of the Wall wyth a thréede.
These things thus known, one day slipping down from the Wal, he passed the ditche by that hydden Wall, and lying hidde in the Marish till Euening, came in the night neare vnto Cale· where tarrying for the cleare daye, he then wente into the Towne (for else he might not:) here he instructed them that were gréedie of praye and to scale the Castell, howe they might enter the same· they caused ladders to be made to the length by the Archer appointed.
Thirtie me~ conspyring togither, clothing themselues in blacke armour without any brightnesse, they went to the Castell by the guiding of the sayde Iohn de Dancaster, and clyming the Wall with their ladders, they slewe the watchmen, and threwe them down headlong beside the Wall: after this, in the Hall they slew many whom they founde vnarmed, playing at the Chesse and Hazarde.
Then they brake into the Chambers and Turrets vpon the Ladyes and Knightes that laye there asléepe, and so were made maisters of all that was within: and shutting all their prisoners into a strong Chamber, being bereft of all their armour, they toke out the English men that had bin taken the yeare before and there kept in prison, and after they hadde relieued them well with meate and drinke, they made them guardens ouer them that had them in custodie: and so they wanne all the Fortresses of the Castell, vnknowen to them that were in the Towne, (appointed to ouersée the repayring of the broken Wals) what had happened to them within the Castell.
In the morning they commaunded the workemen in the Towne to cease from theyr workes, who therevppon perceyuing that the Castell was wonne, streyghte wayes fledde, and the newe Castilians· suffered the Ladyes to depart on horssebacke, wyth theyr apparell, writings, and Munimentes, where they oughte to holde theyr fées: and the same daye there came from Caleis to theyr ayde suche persons as they sente for, by whose ayde they kepte the Castell: and aboute thrée of the clocke there came two Knightes, sente from the Earle of who demaunding a truce, willed to know of them that were thus entred the Castel, who they were, to whom they belonged, and by whose aucthoritie they kept the Castell so taken in the time of truce, wherevnto they aunsweared, that being intruded, they woulde not declare to any man theyr purpose, til they had tryed a longer possession: and therefore on Saint Mawrice day, the Abbot (the King being busie in Parliamente,) the French men being sente from the sayde Earle of Guisnes, declared, how in preiudice of the truce, the sayd Castel was taken, and therefore by right of mutuall fayth it ought to be restored vnto them.
The king aunswered, that without hys knowledge that enterprice was made, and therefore hée gaue commaundemente to his subiectes, that none of them shoulde deteyne the Castell of Guisnes, but deliuer it vnto the lawfull Lordes thereof.
The messengers being returned home, and reporting what they had done, the Earle of Guisnes commeth to the Castel, demanding of them within, as at other times, in whose name they kepte it.
Who constantly affirming that they kepte it in the name of Iohn Dancaster, he required to knowe if the same Iohn were the King of Englandes liegeman, or woulde obey him: who answearing that he knewe not what messengers hadde bin in Englande, the Earle offered for the Castle, besides all the treasure founde in it, many thousands of Crownes, or possessions for exchaunge, and a perpetuall peace with the king of France.
To this they aunsweared, that before the takyng of that Castel they were English men by nation, but by theyr demerites bannished for the peace of the king of Englande, wherefore the place which they thus helde, they would willingly sell or exchaunge, but to none sooner than to theyr naturall king of Englande, to whom they sayde, they woulde sell their Castel, to obtaine their peace: but if he would not buy it, then they woulde sell it to the King of Fraunce, or to whome soeuer would giue most for it.
The Earle being thus shifted of from them, the king of Englande boughte it in déede, and so had that place whyche he greatlye desired.
This Fortresse was wont to stoppe vppe the passage into the higher Countrey, gyuing to some greate suertye from the Forragers, that were to issue forth of Caleis.
The Counsell of Fraunce therefore wishing to haue that Castell agayne, or to builde another of like vtilitie, for the defence of the Countrey thereaboutes, they sente for Geffrey Charney latelye redéemed out of Englishe Captiuitie, with aucthoritie to builde and fortifye as followeth.
To them that trauayle from Guisnes to Caleis there was a place on the lefte hande strong, but decayed, hauyng a Churche, in which certaine Nunnes were resident, and it was called Lalbastie: this place was so neare to Guisnes, that the Englishe menne standyng without the gate of theyr fortresse might shoote to it.
Thys Monasterie of Nunnes mighte easilye be made defensible, for it hadde high Wals like a Castell, and a highe Towre, and verye large for a stéeple, and beyng scituate in a marishe grounde, it mighte with small labour be compassed with a ditche.
This place the Englishe men hadde spared for deuotion sake, vntil that the forsayde Geffrey, in breache of truce, wyth a mightye power besieged Guisnes, and remoued the Nunnes from the Churche, making a Castell of the Church, and fensing the Walles with rampire and ditch: and this was about Pentecoste, in whiche season the Waters not impeaching hym, his people myghte worke in the Marishe.
They wythin the Castel therefore being besieged, were vnneth able to come abroade wyth theyr boates by the ditches that were ful of Water, and by the Marish vnpassable and also full of Water, neyther they of Caleis coulde victuall them by anye manner of meane, by reason of the siege, and wardyng that was kepte at Lalbastie.
They that were thus besieged oft times sailed out and fought with the~ of Lalbastie, but slue very few, sometime with arrows, sometime wt other weapons: at length, vpon a day appointed, the Calisians, with the~ of Oye Markes on the one part, and they within Guisnes on the other, met, set on their enimies, slew many, and chased many away, and finally set fire and brent vp Lalbastie, and dismanteling the walles, made all plaine with the grou~d.

and Bachelers, to the number of fiue hundred, whose coatearmours were brought away: the number of commo~s were not compted.
There were take~ the Lord of Brusebeke, sonne of the Marshall Bertram, also Tristram de Maleis, also the Lord of Maletret, the Uicount of Comaine, Geffrey de Graues, William de la Vall, Charles Darchesill, Iohn de Bause, and other Knightes, with Bachelers, aboue
This armie of the Frenchmen, vnder the conduct of the sayde Marshall, of purpose deuised by him, was so besette on the backehalfe, with the stéepenesse of a Mountayne, that flie they could not, to the end that hope of flight being take~ from them, their courage to fight might ye more encrease.
There were many of those Knightes surnamed of the Starre, who in their profession had conspired neuer to turne their fearefull backes to their enimies, of which number of Knightes, there were among them slayne and taken, numbred xlv.
From that dangerous encounter few escaped vnhurt, and among other, the foresayd Walter Bentley Captayne was sore wounded, who commanded thirtie archers to be condemned, for that in the greatest heate of the fight they fledde.
The Earle of Stafford also entered into Gascoigne, where encountering with a greate armie of the Frenchmen that were issued forth of the fortresse of Gagent, he discomfited, tooke, and chased them: about the Natiuitie of our Lady there was taken that valiant Knight· Gaude, and seauen Knightes of the Starre.

Whilest these things were a doing by Sea and Lande, Otto, sonne to the Duke of Brunswike, the French Kings féed man, sent letters to the Duke of Lancaster, being returned out of Spruce, by the tenour whereof he accused him, affirming, that as he returned out of Spruce by Colein, he malitiouslie informed the Coleners, that the sayd Otto went about by stealth to haue taken him prisoner, and to haue presented him to the French King, adding héerevnto, that bycause he neuer meant any such taking of him, he was ready in declaration of his good name, by a singular Combate onely in the French Kings Court, to proue the Duke of Lancaster a lyar touching the sayd Article.
The Letters were not sealed, and therefore, least it might haue bin thought follie to haue giuen credite to the letter, deliuered by a seruant, the Duke sent vnto Otto two Knightes to learne the cause of the chalenge, and to demaund thereof his letters patentes, sealed with his seale of armes, which Knightes accomplishing the effect of their iourney, and returning with spéede, the Duke sent to the French King for a safe conduct for himselfe and his men, and with much ado obteyning it, he went to Paris, where in the listes, in presence of the French King, the King of Nauarre, and the Duke of Burgoigne, and many Péeres, and other of the Realme of France, he mounted on his stéede in séemely wise, readie in all signes, without default, to trie the Combate, and so stayde till his aduersarie was readie, and the voyce of the Herault and Canton to be had by their common othe, for the assurance of his word, and to obey the Law.
On the contrary parte, the sayde Otto scarcely was set on his Horse, was not able decently to set on his helmet, nor to wéelde his Speare (or else he fayned) whose vnablenesse béeing perceyued by the French King, the King of Nauarre, and other, the Kyng tooke the quarrell into hys handes, wherevpon Otto was commaunded first to departe the listes, and so wente hys way, but the Duke abode still within them.
After this, by commandement of the Frenche King, Otto sware that he should neuer after that day appeach the Duke of Lancaster of that Article: and so from thence the Duke returned home by Zeland.

for the desire of peace, sent the Cardinal of Bononi to Caleis, to heare the treatie of the finall peace betwixt the Kingdomes of England and France, to whome repaired the Counsellours of both Realmes, with full authoritie to treate and constitute the conditions of the same peace, and at length they agréed vpon this poynt, that the King of Englande should resigne all his right that he had to the Realme of France, and remitte it to the French King, and should haue therefore the Dutchie of Aquitayne, and the Counties of Artoys and of Guisnes, for him and his successors Kings of England, without that he should holde the same of the French King in any manner of wise.

The Englishmen requested that these sayd dominions should be absolutely, and without any condition restored to the King: answere also was made to the reason of the Frenchmen, touching the oth of their King and themselues, whereby they were bound to conserue the integritie of the honour of their Kingdome, to wéete, that the Pope for the benefite of peace might assoyle them from the saide othe, and this as to certayne articles premitted, it shoulde be very well done: but yet nothing was done that might be offorce to the furthering of the peace.

On Saterday they trauayled through a great wind and dust, leauing on the lefte hande a great poole of freshe water, béeing in compasse aboute thirtie leagues, and is called Casibon.
They came to a Towne called Silony, whiche was yéelded to the Prince, and therefore neuer touched: and the Prince was lodged that night at a good Towne called Canet.
On Sonday the eyght of Nouember, they passed the water of Sandey, partly at the Foord called Chastel de Terre, and partly ouer a Bridge, and so trauayled betwixt high hilles, vnto the great Citie of Narbon, whereof that Countrey taking his name, is called Gallia Narbonensis.
This Citie was very strong, and well walled, hauing in it a great Cathedrall Church: also, a notable Castell, belonging to the Bishop, and a very strong Tower for the Earle of the same Towne.
It had also a Suburbe called a Borough, much bigger, and better built, than the Borough of Carkason.
Betwixt the Borough and the Citie, there runneth a water called Ande, comming from Carkason, and runneth into the Greekish Sea.
Betwixt the Citie and the Borough are two Bridges of stone, and the third of timber, built with storehouses for diuers Merchandises.
The Prince was lodged in the house of Carmelite Friers.
On Tuesday the Borough béeing set on fire, the army passing to the water side, wente ouer it in diuers places.
From thence, they went and lodged at the Towne and Castell of Ambion.
On Wednesday they trauelled an euill iourney, and hurtfull to the Horsse for lacke of water.
On Thurseday, Theodorike Dale, Porter of the Princes Chamber, was made Knight: thence the Army passed by a good towne called Vlmes: the middleward passed vnto the good Towne of the Earle of Lile, called Arnile, where they lodged that night.
The Prince lay at the Friers Minors, where was greate abundance of Muskadell, béeing prouided for the Countesse of the Ile, which was all spoyled.
This daye also, the good Towne of Pipions was destroyed, with the Castell thereof called Redote.
On Friday, the army passing by a long stonie way, lodged at Lamian.
On Saterday, returning backe towarde Gascoigne, they lefte on their right hand the great poole of Esbone, and Carkason, and all the iourney that they wente before, and the rereward lodged at a good Towne called Abier, and the middleward at where a Castell béeing defended, withstoode them a season, but at length was wonne, and the Prince lay beyonde the Bridge, by a faire running water, on both sydes whereof, the Countrey was spoyled with fire, togither with the good Towne of Pesaunce, where the vawarde was lodged y^ night.
On Sonday they trauelled a· long iourney, bycause the Prince should be lodged in the great Abbey of our Lady de Prolion, where in seuerall Cloysters, did liue Predicants, wherevnto, the Prince was deuoutely receiued.
In y^ day, the army set on fire ye towne of Lemeins, where there was far greater Couents of Religions, than at Carkason.
Also, they brent the faire Towne called Falanges, vnto which towne belonged xxj. Windmilles.
They brent also the townes of Vnlard, Serre, with all ye whole Cou~trey lying theraboutes.
On Monday the middleward lodged at the good towne called Dealpuhbon, which long time was defended, but at length gotten by force, the Castell whereof yéelded, vnto the which Towne and Castell, the Prince co~manded that no harme should be done by fire.
On Tuesday earely passing ouer ye riuer of Beseile, they entred into a cou~trey which was broade.
About one aclocke, they came before a great Abbey called Bourgbon, where the Earle of Fluxens with great ioy receyued the Prince, he being newly escaped out of prison from Paris, where he had laine by the space of two yeares: and the said Earle remained from that time faithful to the Prince.
This day they rode in the Lordships and seigniories of the same Earle, by the Townes of Masell and Colmon, and on the right hand they passed by the greate Towne of Saint Canole, and the high Castel called Hautripe: but on this day they brent nothing for reuerence of the foresaid Earle and his Uineyards, but passed agayne ouer the water of Arage, leauing also Tolous as they did at the first: but then one mile on the left hand, and now four leagues on the right, and the middle ward was lodged in the great Towne of Mermount, which togither with the Castell was brent.
On Wednesday, they passed by the Castell of the Earle of Flux· called Mounthane, at the foote whereof, all the horsemen passed ouer the great water of Geround, and there tooke the Towne and Castell of North, then leauing the Riuer of Gerond on the left hand, and so passed vnto the towne of Marconaw, which they tooke: then they returned ouer the Riuer againe, and tooke the strong Towne of Carbone.
On Friday word was brought to the Prince that the French were vp, and had gathered a great force, which they had deuided into fiue great battels, being in the field not far from them, wherevpo~ our men set themselues in battayle aray, about one mile from the place where they lodged, and béeing now readie to fight, some one of the Souldioures by chance start a Hare, wherevpon a great shout was made, which the enimies hearing, they sente out fortie light Horsemen, to sée what was the cause thereof, who drawing nigh to the English armie, and perceiuing them to be set in battayle aray, returned backe againe, and declared what they had séene: wherevpon presently the whole armie of Frenchmen fled with great feare.
The same day, Barthelmew Burwash, Iohn Chandos, and Iames de Audley, with xxiiij. light horseme~, were appointed scoutes, comming to y^ tayle of y^
Knightes gentlemen, amongst whome, they toke the Erle of Romeme, also they slewe many Carters and Wagoners.
On Saterday they marched to the Castell of Oradrie, in which Castell the Prince lodged, and in the morning they brent it.
On Sonday the two and twentith of Nouember, about euening, they perceyued that theyr enimies were on the other side of ye gret Hil harde by the great towne of Gemount, so that the English men being sent out. lx. lyghte horssemen, and certaine bowmen vnto the righte hande of the towne called Auremount, where finding.
menne of armes of the Conestable of Fraunce, they chased them out of the Towne, and slewe and toke many: the middle Warde lodged at Auremount, and the Uawarde at Colimont.
Earelye in the morning the Wagoners being commaunded to remayne in the Towne of Auremount, all the residue being deuided into troupes, went into the fielde, wayting for the comming of theyr enimies, all in vaine: for the Prynce taking the Towne of Gamount, was tolde that his enimies fled away at midnight.
On Twesday the armye lodged in the fielde, and for lacke of Water, their horsse were faine to drinke Wyne, whereof it came to passe, that the nexte daye their horsses were so drunke they coulde not goe right forth, and many of them dyed.
On Saint Katherines daye, wyth muche a doe they came to Water, and leauing the Towne of Florence on theyr righte hande, they passed to the greate towne called Silard, and the middle warde was lodged at a Towne called Realmount, which they toke by maine force, and therefore brent it.
On Fryday they trauayled a long iourney, by Walled townes and strong Castels, the middle warde lodged at Serde.
On Saterday they passed ouer a certaine Water with great difficultie, and through woods, till they came to a good Towne called Mesin.
On Sondaye the Prince rested, and toke homage and othes of the Townesmen.
Monday Sainte Andrewes daye trauelling a long iourney, they came to the Towne of Tolows, where were thrée Castels.
On Twesday the prince trauelled to the Castel of Melan, wher he lodged.
On Wednesday the Prince came to Regla, wher his horsses and Wagons passed throughe the riuer of Gerond.
In thys towne of Regla, the Prince appointed diuerse Barons and suche like to Winter in diuerse places of the Marches, to the intente they shoulde kéepe the inland parts of Gascoigne against the French men.
The Prince of Wales touching these matters aforesayd, and for other considerations also, caused a newe coyne of golde to be made in Gascoigne, being busied himselfe aboute the repayring of such things as were decayed and throwen downe.
And in this season, there sprang vp a foolish fantasie in the French mens heades, that the King of Englande was come into Normandie, the cause of which rumour rose vppe, for that the Duke of Lancaster, after that he had fortifyed the strong places belonging to the King of Nauar, whiche were in the Ile of Constance and other places, did direct his iourney towardes Brytaine, whereof he was newly made chiefe Captaine.
Another cause was this, Phillippe brother to the King of Nauar, came into England, and earnestly craued ayde of the King, against the Frenche King, who kept hys brother in prison, that he mighte by force of armes restoare all such lands vnto him as were wrongfully withholden from him, wherevpon hée offeryng to doe homage and fealtie, he hadde (of the Kings appoyntmente,) Miles Stapleton, a manne of great integritie, and in martiall affayres very skilful, him (I say) the king appointed to be his faithful felow.
These men with two thousande men well appoynted trauelling throughe Normandie, toke townes and Fortresses, burning diuerse of them, passing along tyll they came to a Castell nine leagues distaunte from the Citie of Paris: neyther did they theyr trauayle, vntil they hadde forced theyr enymies to enter into a yearelye truce.
By this meanes a great report and no lesse fear filled the heartes of all French men, whiche report at length came to the eares of the Prince lying at Regla, wherefore he gathering all the power he had with him in hys Dukedome, to the intent to méete hys Father, whiche he muste doe by trauelling through Fraunce, he came at length to Brugetat, where he was certifyed that the Earle of Armenia, woulde after his departure haue spoyled the Countrey, and for that intent had prouided a greate bande of men: wherefore hée sent backe to the gouernour of Gascoigne, vnto Barnarde de Libret, and other.
From thence the prince went into France, through the coastes of Barny and Lymon, stil encouraging his men against their enimies, sending before him Iohn Chandos, Iames Dawdeley, and other complices, to trye out the state of their enimies countrey, least perhappes some crafty ambushment might sodainely assaulte our men, afore they were ware.
He himself remouing his campe euery day, and now being entred into Pictauia, his espies broughte worde that the French king had gathered a greate armye, beyng now in Aurelian, who also knewe of the Princes comming, for he sente out espies to discouer our armye, amongst who~ Griffin Micco of Chambly, petie Captaine of two hundered men, méeting with other espies, came to his coaste: for oure espies toke thirtie of the~, and slew the residue, so that there was not one of them lefte to carrye worde what was become of theyr fellowes.
Our espies procéeded towardes Romerentine, where méeting with the Lord Crone and Lord Brisgande, they sette vppon them and slew them, their chief Captaines being forced to flée to a castle, and hauing taken their lodging in a town, the prince commanded that on the morning a great assault should be giuen to the~ of ye Castell.
The day folowing our men being al armed, passed through the ditches, came vnto ye wals of the Castel, some applied to scale ye wall with ladders, some burne the gates, and entring, slew a gret many of the chief men, but ye Lords before named fled vnto the principal tower of ye castel: but ye prince determined not to depart, til they that were besieged, were eyther taken or yéelded: at length the Castell being vndermyned, the men besieged, with all humilitie yéelded vp the Castell.
After this the spies declared that the Frenche King was come downe to Turon, to prouide armies to go against the Prince, of the which tydings the Prince being gladde, he pighte his tentes againste the Frenche King, but could not passe the riuer of Leger, by reason of greate floudes, and the Frenche King hadde broken all the bridges, to the intent there shoulde be no passage betwixte the Prince and the Duke of Lancaster, whose armyes might wel euerye nyght perceyue eache others fiers in the Campes: but the Prince folowing alongst the riuer of Legers Eastwarde, he pyghte hys tentes neare vnto Turon, where loking for the Frenche Kyng foure dayes, hoping to fighte with him, for that hée was distaunte but one league off, he vnderstoode that the Frenche King was retyred backe to Blamia, ten leagues off: passing ouer by a Bridge the Riuer of Legers at a place vsed betwixt two strong Townes, and so towarde Poyters.
This retyring of the Frenche king certifyed, the Prince returned backe, intending to haue mette him in his waye, whych he coulde not doe: yet crossing ouer all, as he imagined the nerer way, he sette vpon the tayle of his enymies, and cut fro~ them the Earles of Inyni and Winters, and also the Marshall of Burgonie, these being take~, died, as was thought, through the great toyle they had taken: night drawing on, our men gaue themselues to reste in a wood, intending the next day to take theyr iourney towarde Poiters, and by the waye they were certifyed that the Frenche King, with greate prouision prepared himselfe to battayle, and drew nigh to our tents: the Prince therefore committed the vawarde of the armye to the Earles of Warwick and Oxford, the middle ward was guided by the Prince, and the rerewarde was led by the Earles of Salisburie and Suffolke.
In all the whole armye of the Prince there was not aboue foure thousande menne of armes, one thousande armed souldiours, and two thousand Archers.
The pompous nobilitie of the French men drewe nygh, greatly disdayning the small company of the Englishe men, for they had in number eight thousande fighting souldiours, they had also seuen auntients.
At this matter a gret many of our men murmured, bycause of late, a great part of our army was sent to defende Gascoigne.
There was among the French men a certaine Scotte called William Douglas, a man of great force and practise in the Warres: this manne did the French king make Knight, and bycause he knewe he woulde be a deadly enimie to the English men, he gladlye hearkned to his aduices.
This William was Captain ouer two hundred Scottes: these men vnderstoode wel that it was the custome of the Englishe men in those dayes to fighte on foote, in which point they followed the Scottes, and the Scots also prouoked the French king and other French men to fight in like maner.
The French king obeying his foolish counsel, gladly agréed vnto his sayings, wherevpon he sente lighte horssemen into the Cittie, that they shoulde suffer no man to make any chase, but only.
horssemen well appointed to come out againste the Archers, in the beginning of the conflict, and to runne them ouer and to treade them vnder theyr horsse féete: but these performed not that whiche was commaunded them, as it appeared by the sequele thereof.
The armies being set in a readinesse on both sides for to fighte early on Sonday in the morning, which was notable fayre, beholde there came the Cardinall of Petragoren, and charged the prince, in the name of God who was crucified, that it mighte please him to deferre the warre for a tyme, both for ecclesiasticall peace, and also for the sparing of Christian bloud, and to the ende there might be a treatie had of peace, the whiche he promised shoulde be performed wyth great honour on both sides.
The Prince neyther feared nor refused peace, but modestly agréed to the request of this Father.
All this day nowe being appointed for the obtaynyng of peace, the army of the French men encreased by the number of a thousande men of armes, and also of other.
On the morrowe after, the Cardinall came againe from the Frenche king, in his behalfe to request a truce, which should endure for one whole yeare, the whiche the Prince denyed, yet at the importunate sute of that Cardinal, he graunted a truce to continue till Christmasse next comming.
Therefore the Cardinall returning to the Frenche King, requested him of pledges for the truce, but the Marshall Dawdenam, Geffrey de Charney, Douglas the Scot, perswaded him that by common reason it coulde not come to passe that the English men shoulde at that time preuayle, and especially, bycause they were but fewe, and in a straunge Countrey, wearyed out miserably with their toyle in trauel, therefore not ableto indure so great a number of the French men of Fraunce, who stood in defence of theyr own lande.
The Prince of Wales being certified, that the Captaines of the French, wold haue no kind of peace, but such as they could get by force of armes, calling his men togither, he made to them an Oration first in generall, and then to his Archers as followeth: your ma~hoode (saith he) hath bin alwayes known to me, in great da~gers, which sheweth yt you are not degenerate fro~ true sons of English men, but to be descended from the bloude of them which heretofore were vnder my fathers dukedome, his predecessors kings of Englande, vnto whome no labour was paineful, no place inuincible, no ground vnpassable, no Hil (wer it neuer so high) inaccessible, no tower vnscaleable, no army inpenitrable, no armed souldiour, or whole hostes of men was formidable.
Their liuely couragiousnesse tamed the French men, the Ciprians, the Siracusians, the Galabrians, the Plestinis, and brought vnder the stiffe necked Scottes, and vnruely Irish men, yea and the Walsh men also, which could wel indure all labour.
Occasion, time, and daungers, maketh of feareful, verye strong and stoute, and doeth manye times of dull witted men make wittie: honour also, and loue of the Countrey, and the desire of the rich spoyle of the French men, doth stirre you vp to follow your fathers steps· Wherefore follow your auntients, and wholy be intentiue to follow the commaundement of your Captaines as well in minde as in body, that if victorie come with life, we may still continue in firme friendship togither, hauing alwayes one will, and one minde: but if enuious Fortune (whych God forbidde) shoulde let vs at this presente, to runne the race of all fleshe, and that we ende both life and labour togither, be you sure that your names shall not want eternall fame and heauenly ioy, and we also with these gentlemen our companions, wyll drinke of the same cuppe, that you shal doe, vnto whom it shal be an eternal glorie and name, to haue wonne the nobilitie of Fraunce: but to ouercome (as God forbid) is not to be ascribed vnto the daunger of time, but to the courage of the men.
Hauing spoken these words, he perceyued that there was a Hill harde by, whiche was planted on the toppe with hedges and ditches, the inside whereof was very playne, and a pasture fielde on the one side thereof, with manye roughe bushes, and on the other side it was all planted with vines, and the residue was playne, in the top wherof he did imagine the armye of the French to lye betwixt our men and the Hil.
There was gret and lowe vallyes, and a péece of marish ground.
One company of the Prince finding out a narrowe passage, entred the valley and toke the Hyll, where among the bushes they hidde themselues, taking the aduantage of the place.
The fielde wherein our men laye, to witte, the vawarde and middle warde, was deuided from the playne where the Frenche armye laye, with a long hedge and ditche, the one ende whereof dyd reache downe to the Marishe aforesayde: that of the Hyll nexte the Marishe, the Earle of Warwicke kept, Captaine of the vawarde.
In the vpper part of the hedge, toward the hanging of the Hil, there was a gret gap, from the whiche a stones cast stoode our rereward, ouer the whiche the Earle of Salisburie was Captayne.
Oure enymies perceyuyng oure Princes auntiente to bée displayed, and ofttymes to bée remoued from place to place, and by reason of the Hill to be some time quite out of sighte, they iudged that the Prince fledde, yet Douglas the Scotte and Marshal de Clarimount, sayde that it was not so, but Marshal Dawdenam being deceiued in his owne opinion, thought otherwise, crying out still to followe and chase the Prince now fléeing, and with him also Douglas, to the inte~t to get preferment and a worthy name of his new warfare: but Clarimount to washe awaye the euill opinion whiche was conceyued of him touching his fidelitie, was the more vehement to perswade them forwarde, for vnto them the charge of the vawarde was deputed: before these went out, as the fashion was, certaine to chase and to iuste, againste whom certain that wer vnder the Hill of our vaward came to méete Marshal Dawdenam, who staying to sée the end of the iusting, kept himselfe from encountring.
In the meane time Clearimount thinking to come out by the gap in the hedge, and so to come at the backe of our vawarde, and to compasse them in, met with the Earle of Salisburie, who perceyuing his comming and purpose, suspected his whole intent, and so they whiche gouerned our rereward, making haste to take the gap, and kéepe the enimie from passing that way, sustayned the first charge of the battayle.
Then began a terrible méeting betwixte the armed menne, who laide on loade with swordes and speares, neyther dyd the Archers slacke theyr duetie, but lying in safe trenches, start vp aboue the ditche and shot ouer the hedge, preuayling more with their arrowes, than they did that fought in armes: thus our rerewarde slaying the enimies, who came stragling to the gap, and the vawarde which lay on the hanging of the Hil, towarde the Marish, being gouerned by the Earle of Warwicke, were alwayes readye and met with the French men, beating them downe.
The Archers of the vawarde were placed in the Marishe, out of daunger from the horssemen, yet for al that they did preuaile there somewhat, for ye horsemen were appointed to no other purpose but to ouerrunne the Archers.
The Earle of Oxforde considering the discommodity that might ensue therof, departed from the Princes ward, and leading with him the Archers, sette them on the one side of the French men, commaunding them to shoote at yt hinder partes of the horsses, by meanes whereof the horsses being gauld and wounded, fel to tumbling with them that sat on their backes, or else turned backe and ran vpon them that followed after, making great slaughter vpon their own maisters.
The horssemen being thus beaten backe, the Archers retyred towardes the place from whence they came, shooting gauling the sides of the French men which fought right ouer against them: by this time the force and heate of the battayle beganne to be in prime, when as the Earles of Warwicke and Salisburie, like fierce Lions endeuored of purpose which of them shold dung the land of Poyters most with French mens bloud.
Nether was the wise Counseller Thomas Dassord of Suffolke ydle at that season, who righte worthylie in all his actes behaued himselfe, being experte and skilfull in actiuitie.
For he continually running from ward to warde, and into all troupes and companies, comforted styrred them vp with good words to doe well, hauing a gret regarde that the youthfull sorte of lustie souldiours beyng to bolde vppon their good heartes and courage, shoulde not without regarde go out too farre, and placed the Archers at sundry times to great aduantages, and oftentimes as leasure would suffer him, he woulde encorage vp the minds of the souldiours.
Clarimount was slaine, William Dowglas also being wounded fledde, hauing with him a fewe Scots of hys bande, with Archebald Dowglas hys brother: our men retiring, put themselues in good array, and our vaward and ioyned themselues togither, by and by there marcheth forth a newe armye of the French men, the whiche the eldest son of the French king, Dolphin of Vienna, brought forth.
The order and array of this army was more terrible fierce than the shewe of that which was last oppressed, yet for al that coulde not it make our men afrayde, who were sharp set, and very desirous of honor, also of reuenge, both for themselues, their fellowes, whiche a little before were slayne and wounded.
And therefore boldely they goe to it on both sides, makyng showts and noyses, crying out, Saint George to borrow, or Saint Denis be for vs. Within a while they were come to fight man to man, euery man readye to dy, fight now to saue theyr lyues, neither doth ye Lion make the Wolf afraid, or the Tegre is more terrible to the simple beast, than our lusty gentlemen were to their enimies, who chaced them, slew them like as the Wolues chace kil Shéepe.
And though that this battel withstood our men more than the firste, yet, after they had lost a great many of their men, they had suche a deuise, that they saued manye, and yet, not by running away, but by a faire retreate, whiche the Frenchmen are accustomed to vse.
But our men considering, that the victorie of the field was doubtful, as long as the French King mighte be in presence wyth his armye, who lay there halfe hid in a Ualley, they woulde not afterward, when they had chaced any that fled, go out of the field, but the worthy man Maurice Barkley, son of Thomas Barkley, had no regard there vnto, who for ye space of two houres togither with his men, neuer spared, but wold be stil in the forefront of the battayle, inuading his enimies wt the firste, This Maurice being in ye midst of y^
Dolphens guard sowed blowes among them, first with a speare, than with a sword, at length he being al alone compassed wt the multitude, forely wounded, he was taken prisoner.
In the meane time our me~ carryed those which were wounded of their camp, laide the~ vnder bushes hedges out of y^ way, other hauing spent their weapons toke y^ speares swords fro~ them who~ they had ouercome: the Archers lacking arrowes, made hast to draw them fro~ pore wretches y^ were but halfe dead: there was not one of the~ all, but eyther he was wounded or quite wearied with gret labor, except.
me~ who kéeping yt chief standart, wer appointed to méete y^ French king.
The Dolphin being thus put to flight, one came to y^
Frenche K. sayd, my Lord K. the field is fallen to the English men, and your eldest son hath withdrawen himself: vnto who~ y^
Fre~ch King answered with an othe, y^ he would not y^ day forsake y^ field vnlesse he were taken or slain, so by y^ means carried away by force: wherfore the auntiente bearers are co~ma~ded to march forwards, after who~ followed two gret co~panyes of armed me~ into a wide fielde, shewing themselues to our men, struck a gret feare into their heartes, in so much y^ they were out of hope to conquire any more.
The whyche thing a ma~ of great wisedome standing by ye prince signified wt a howling voyce, (saying alas we poore wretches are ouercome,) but the prince hauing a great trust and saith in Christ, checked him, saying, thou liest thou dastardly fellow, for thou canst not say yt we can be ouercome as lo~g as liue.
Captain de la Buche, a noble man in al affayres, as soone as he perceyued the armes of the French King, marching forth of their tentes, asking licence of the Prince departed awaye with lx. souldiours, and a hundred Archers, whom many of our men thought to haue fled away: wherfore our souldiors (excepting the chiefe Captaines) being quite out of hope of victorie, committed the~selues wholy to the mercie of God.
Then the Prince co~manded his Auntient bearer sir Walter Woodland, to march foreward toward his enimies, and wt fresh men he ioyned battayle with ye gret army of the French king: by by they sounde their trumpets, one giuing answere to another, they made suche a noyse y^ the Wals of Poyters sou~ded wt the Eccho therof like a wood, in such sort y^ a man would haue thought y^ the hils had bellowed out to ye valleys, that ye clouds had giue~ forth a most terrible thu~der, to ye which ther wa~ted no cruel lightnings, whylest the ayre shone on ye bright armour spears dashing against shining harneis.
The~ came on the cruel co~pany of crosbowme~, making a darknesse in y^ with yt multitude of quarels which they shot, against who~ came a worthy co~pany of English bowmen: out flyes also Darts of Ashe which met wt the enimy afar off: but ye Fre~ch army being ful of diuers troups, many armed me~ defe~ding their brests with their shields, procéede forwarde againste their enimies: wherefore oure Archers hauing emptied their quiuers in vain, being armed only with swords and Targets, are fayn to encounter with them that were laden with armour.
Then bestirreth hymselfe the worthye Prince of Wales, cutting and hewing the French men with a sharp sword.
In the mean time Captain de la Buch marcheth a compasse about, vnder the hangyng of the Hil, which he with the Prince a little before forsoke, and priuily compassing about the fielde, at the length commeth close vnder the place where the Frenche Campe laye, from thence he ascended to the toppe of the Hill that waye, whiche the French men had beaten with theyr trauayle, and so sodainely breaking forth vnloked for, and shewing by the ensigne of Saint George that he was our friend, the Prince with great courage giueth a freshe charge on the French armye, being desirous to breake their ranckes, before the captaine aforesayde, shoulde set on the side of the battayle.
The Prince lustilye encountring with his enimies goeth into the middle of the throng, and where he séeth most companye there hée layeth aboute hym on euerye side.
In the meane time on the other side, his friends which serued with Captaine de la Buche, were at the backes of the enimies, beating down and killing without pittie, and the Archers also placed for the purpose shot so thick, wounding the backes and sides of the French men, in suche sorte, that the forme of the battayle was quite spoyled, neyther could they put themselues in order or array any more.
This was the courage of the Prince, who at the lenghth thrusteth thorough the throngs of them, that guarded the Frenche Kyng, then shoulde you sée an auntient beginne to nod and stumble, the bearers of them to fall downe, the bloud of flaues and Princes ran mingled togither into the waters whiche were nigh.
In like sort the Bore of Cornwal rageth, who séeketh to haue none other way to the French Kings standard, tha~ by bloud only: but when they came there, they met wt a of stout men to withstand them, the English me~ fight, the Frenche men also lay on, but at length Fortune making hast to turne hir whéele, the Prince preaceth forewarde on his enimies and like a fierce Lion beating down the proud, he came to yéelding vp of the French Kyng.

In the kalendes of September, the Frenchmen tooke the Ile of Wight, sauing the Castell, which Sir Hugh Tirell kept manfully.
After taking of the said Ile, the Frenchmen entring their Galleys againe, coasted the Sea strond, till they came ouer against the Towne of Winchelsea, and vnderstanding that the Abbot of Battaill was come thither to defend it, they sent to him, that he should redéeme the Towne: the Abbot answered, that he néeded not redéeme the thing which he had not lost, the Frenchmen then requested there might be sente forth to fight ma~ to man, or a more number, to trie the matter in view of armes, but the Abbot answered, he was a Religious man, and therefore not lawfull for him to admitte anye suche petition, and that he came not thither to fighte, but to defend the Towne Countrey.
These things being heard, the Frenchmen supposing that the Abbot and his people wanted courage, they assayled the Towne with such instruments of warre as cast forth a farre off, whereof they had plentie, not ceassing from noone till euening: but by the prowesse of ye Abbot, and such as were with him, the French preuayled nothing.
In the meane time, whilest they were busie thus at Winchelsea, they sent part of their company vnto Hastings, where finding the towne almost emptie, they brent it.
The Frenchmen perceyuing they could do no good at Winchelsea, departed from thence, and left it as they found it.
The same yeare, the Frenchmen comming vp at y^ towne of Rotingdon in Sussex, néere to the Towne of Lewes, where the Prior of Lewes, with a small companie met them, and by a multitude of Frenchmen that came vpon him, he was taken, and ledde to their Shippes, with two Knightes, to wéete, Sir Iohn Fallesley, and Sir Thomas Cheynie, and a Squire, called Iohn Brokes.
There died in this battayle almost an hundred Englishmen: the Frenchmen therefore with all their Nauie returned home, being
Galleys, eyght Caruales of Spayne, and certayne Barkes: streightwayes therefore as they came to land, some of them went vnto the séege, that was about Arde, and by treason, which alwayes is familiar to them, the kéeper of that Castell being an Almayne, to wéete, the Lord of Gunney, deliuering to them the Towne, they streight got the Castell also, for the which the same kéeper being taken by Sir Hugh Caluerley, kéeper of Caleis, was sent into England, and committed to prison.

There was graunted to the King of the Cleargie two tenthes to be payde that yeare, with condition, that from thenceforth the King should not extort from his subiectes by such petitions or demaundes but liue of his owne, and continue his warre, for as it was aunsweared there, his owne goods pertayning to the crowne, sufficed both to the finding of his house, and mayntayning of his warres, of the same were bestowed by fitte ministers, and for the kéeping of the money, two Citizens of London were appointed, William Walworth, and Iohn Philpot.
The English men hearing of a number of Spanishe shippes to remayne at sluce for wante of winde, assembling a great companye of armed men, and a great nauie, meant to take the seas, their chiefe Captaynes were Thomas of Woodstocke Erle of Buckingham, the duke of Brytaine, the Lord Latimer, the Lord Robert Fitz Walter, sir Robert Knowles, and many other valiaunt personages, who being entred the Sea, tasted Fortune disfauourable, for by a tempestuous winde that rose, theyr shippes were scattered in sunder, theyr mastes are broken downe, theyr sayles rent, and many of the small vessels that were victuallers were drowned, at length, the shippes got togither againe, and arriued in Englande, and being nowe rigged are eftsoones freight with men, and to the Sea they go.
About y^ same time, sir Hugh Caluerley making a iourney towards Bulloign, found a Barge in y^ hauen of ye town, y^ bare ye name of the towne, another that was the French Kings a xxvj. other vessels more and lesse, all the which with a great part of the suburbes of Bulloigne, he caused to be dispoyled, taking with him whatsoeuer was there to be desired, with certayne prisoners: he droue afore him also a gret bootie of shéepe and beastes, whiche he founde pasturing néere the towne, which might well serue to victuall Caleis for a great time: he recouered the same day the castel Marke, of which through negligence before had bin lost.
The English fléete whereof we spake, returned without any great good successe, they toke an eyght Spanish shippes in the Brytish coastes neare to Brest, and more had take~ if there businesse had bin so well done, as was pretended: and therefore the fléete returned home, so tossed with stormes and contrarie weather, and after with intestine discorde, that it séemed there wanted among them gods fauour.
The Lorde Percy (this fléete remaining for the mending of his shippes, whilest the other were abrode) went now to the sea, wyth a great ship and some smaller vessels, and méeting with fiftie ships laden with French wares and marchandize, of whiche some were of Flaunders, some of Spaine, he set on them al, who beholding his bolde enterprice, and thinking that he hadde some ayde at hande gaue ouer to make resistaunce, and so xxviij. escaping by flight.
xxij. yéelded themselues to the sayd Thomas Lord Percy Sir Hugh Caluerley with a power secretly armed, wente to the towne of Staple, where the fayre was then, to the which were come manye Merchauntmen from Bulloigne, Mutterel, Amience, and Paris, where he falling on them that were vnarmed, slewe many, toke many to be put to their ransomes, sacked al the goods, and set fire in the town, so that it was wholy consumed, few places excepted.
This done, he returned to Caleis with his men in safetie, bringing from that faire wares which turned to the greate profit of the Calisians many yeares after.
The men of Winchelse and Rie, gathered a gret number of people togither, and imbarqued themselues towardes Normandie, desirous to requite ye losses which before they had receiued, and so in the night arriuing in a Town called Peters Hauen, entred the same, slaying so many as they met, those whom they thinke able to pay raunsome, they carry to their shippes: they spoyled the houses with the Churches, where they founde many rich spoyles which sometime had bin by the French men fet from Ric, and especially the belles and such like, which they shipped, set the rest on fire, and the~ they land at Wilet, not far from thence, wher they practised ye like cheuance, so with theyr riche spoyle returned home.
About the same time Iohn duke of Lancaster requested ye ye mony granted to the K. by ye cleargie laitie; might be co~mitted to his custodie, affirming yt he would kepe ye enimies of from the coastes of England, by the space of one yeare with yt mony, moreouer bring to passe some further great commoditie, to whose importunate petitio~ the Lords, although against theyr willes agréed.
They appoint therfore ye firste day of Marche to méete in counsel, in which euery of those shold go forth on this iourney: least ye sea should in ye mean time want those y^ shold kéepe it, there wer. ix. ships hired of the~ of Baion, to defend ye sea land fro~ incursions of the Fre~ch others.
These ships being furnished with sufficie~t nu~bers of armed me~, wein a short time coasting ye seas, met the nauy marchandice of ye Spaniards, entring battayle with them, in short time take. xiiij. of their ships laden wt wines other marchandize, returne to England ioyfully: vnto sir Robert Knowles captain of Brest, they giue the firste fruites of theyr pray, an C. tunne of their beste wines as they passed by him homewardes.
In the meane time Henrie ye bastard, calling himself King of Spain, hearing y^ they of Baion, had done such harme vnto his people, that the D. of La~caster had prepared a gret nu~ber to enter ye sea, he was sore afraid, thinking ye he minded not only to defe~d the sea, but rather to séeke his kingdome, which by right of his wife ye lawful inheritour of Spaine, he ment to chalenge: wherfore ye said Henrie co~manded a nauie to be prepared of al his land yt he might stay the said D. from entring his country, if he might, to take him prisoner, which happily they had done, if ye king of Portingale wt almost an inumerable nu~ber had not entred ye kingdome of Spain, ye self same time yt the bastard Henrie prepared him selfe against ye D. but the D. deferring his iourney from day to day, they y^ wer appointed captains ouer the nauie we certain me~ of war, got the~ to ye sea, there to stay for the Dukes comming, estéeming it more glorious to liue on the sea by prayes taking fro~ the enimies, than to liue by spoile of their owne countreymen at home.
When they had certain dayes vp downe the Seas, the Spaniardes met with them with an armed company of men, so that either part in hope of pray ioyned togyther in fighte, but oure menne hauyng the winde and weather contrary to them, lost the victory to theyr enimies, some escaping by flight, and some being taken, amongst the which sir Hugh Courtney a noble Knight was one.
About the same time Iohn Mercer a Scotte, gathering togither no small number of French men, Scots, and Spaniards, set vpon certaine ships of Scaborow, toke them and led them into Scotlande, this he did in reuenge of his Fathers iniurie, who was before taken by the English men, and kept prisoner in the Castel of Scarborow.
Iohn Philpot a Citize~ of London, a ma~ of iolly wit, very rich in substance, considering the want of ye Duke of Lancaster and other Lords that ought to haue defended ye realm, and lamenting the oppressions of the inhabitauntes, hyred wyth his owne money, to the number of a thousand souldiours, the whiche mighte take from the sayde Iohn Mercer both his shippes and goods, whiche he had by reuenge take~, and defended the Realme of England from suche incursions: and it came to passe within a small time, that his hyred me~ toke the sayde Iohn Mercer with all his ships, which he had violently taken from Scarborow, and fiftéene Spanish shippes that were laden with muche riches, and were with hym in ayde at that present.
There was greate ioy made among ye people, all men praysing that worthy mans bountifulnesse and loue towards the king.
The Earles and Barons séeing so laudable an acte, atchieued by Iohn Philpot, tooke it grieuously, althoughe they knewe themselues guiltie, firste they secretly lye in awayte, to do him some displeasure, and after they spake against him openly, saying it was not lawfull for him to doe such things without the counsell of the King and Realme, certayne of the Lordes but the chiefe being Hugh Earle of Stafforde that rehearsed these things thus against him, were aunsweared by the same Iohn Philpot, sir, know (sayth he) that neyther sente my money nor men to the daunger of the Seas, that shoulde take from you, or your fellowes, the good renoume of Chilualrie, and winne it to me, but being sorrowfull to sée the peoples myserie, in my Countrey, whych nowe through your slouthfulnesse, of the most noble Lady of Nations, is brought to lye open to the spoyling of euerye vilest nation, when there is not one of you that doth put hys hande to the defence thereof.
haue therefore set forth my selfe and mine, for the sauing of my nation and Countrey: the Earle had not to aunswere.

Affirming that al men were made a like by nature, and therefore ought to laye away the yoke of bondage, that they might enioye the wished libertie, &c. too shamefull, sedicious, and damnable to bée taughte, whyche neuerthelesse so pleased the common people, that they cryed hée should be Archbishoppe of Canterburie, and Chauncellour of England.
This rebellion began at Dertford in Kent, in manner as followeth.
The Collectours appointed to gather the foresayd groats or pole mony, comming into the house of Iohn a Tiler, demanded ye same for him, his wife, hys daughter, other hys family: but the Tilers wife denied to pay for hir daughter, saying she was vnder age.
The~ sayd yt Collector, that shal soone wit, and toke the mayde violently, and dishonestly searched whether she were of age or no, wherwith the mother made an outcry, hyr husbande being in ye towne at worke.
When tidyngs came to him, he caughte his lathing staffe in his hande, and ranne réeking home, where he reasoning with the Collectour who made him so bolde, the Collectour being a proude fellow, let flye at the Tiler, but the Tiler voyding the stroke, smote the Collectour on the heade wyth his lathing staffe, that the braynes fell out, where throughe great noyses arose in the streates, and the poore people being glad, euerye man arrayed hym to support this Iohn Tyler.
Thus the commons drewe togither and went to Maidstone, from thence backe againe to Blacke Heath, and so forth to London, and entred the Citie on Corpus Christs day, where they destroyed many goodly places of the nobles and other, as the Sauoy, Saint Iohns by Smithfielde, the Manour of Highburie by Yseldon, and the Temple where the Prentises of law were lodged for the encrease of theyr studie.
They set out of the Tower of London (where the King was then lodged) Simon Sudburie Archbishoppe of Canterburie, Lorde Chauncellour of Englande, Robert Halles Priour of Saint Iohns, and Treasurer of England, William a Frier Minor the Kings confessour, and Iohn Legge a Sergeaunt of the Kings, and beheaded them on the Tower hill: they beheaded diuerse other in manye places, as sir Iohn Cauendishe Lorde chiefe Justice of Englande, the Priour of Sainte Edmundesburie, and other.
Rychard Lions a famous Lapidarie of London, was drawen out of his house and beheaded in Chepe.
They beheaded all men of Law, as wel prentices, and vtter Baresters, as Justices, and al Jurers that they might get into their hands, they spared none whom they thought to be learnes, were it neuer so little, especiallye if they founde anye to haue penne and ynke, they pulled of hys whoode, and all with one voyce of trying out, as they had bin so many Diuels, hale him into the stréetes and cut of his head.
They also beheaded all Flemmings, not sparing anye for reuerence of the church or other place, where they found them: they set thirtéene forth of the Frier Austines Church, and seauentéene out of another Church in London· they tooke two and thirtie in the Vintrie, and many other here there in the Citie and Southwarke, all whiche if they coulde not plainly pronounce Bread and Chéese, but Brot and Caus, lost their heades· They spoyled all bookes of law, recordes, and monuments they coulde méete withall, and set al prisoners at libertie.
The king to pacifie their furie, offered them peace, on condition they woulde cease from burning of houses and slaughter of men, whiche the Essex men toke, and returned home, but the Kentishe men remayned burning and slaying as afore.
Wherevppon the King sent sir Iohn Newton Knight, to Wat Tiler their Captaine, to intreate him to come and talke with him about his owne demaundes: the Knight doing his message, Wat Tiler aunswered that hée woulde come at hys owne pleasure, neuerthelesse he followed softly, and when he came neare Smithfielde, where the king aboade his comming, the same Knighte was sent againe to méete hym, and to knowe his requestes, but Wat Tiler séeing the knight come néere vnto him on horsseback, sayde it hadde become hym better to bée on foote in his presence: the Knighte aunswered that it was no harme, himselfe was also on horssebacke, therewith Watte Tyler drewe his dagger, and offering to strike, called the Knight traytour.
The knighte aunsweared that he lyed, and drew his dagger.
The King séeing the Knighte in daunger, comaunded hym to alighte one foote and to deliuer his dagger vnto Watte Tiler, and when his proude minde woulde not be pacifyed, but woulde néedes runne on the Knighte, there came to the King the Maior of London William Walworth, and manye other Knightes and Esquires, affirming it to be a shamefull reproche if they shoulde permitte the Knyghte to be murdered: Wherevppon the Kyng taking boldenesse vpon hym, commaunded the Maior to arreste the Rebell, whiche Maior being a man of incomparable boldenesse, streyght arrested hym on the head, in suche sorte that he astonyed hym: and forthwyth they whyche attended on the Kyng inuironed the Rebell, and thruste him in, in diuerse places of his bodye· with theyr weapons, and then drewe hym from among the peoples féete, into the Hospitall of Saint Bartholmewe, which when the commons perceyued, they cryed out that theyr Captaine was trayterouslye slayne, but the King rode to them, and sayde, what meane you to doe, am your King, wil be your Captaine, followe me into the fielde, there to haue whatsoeuer ye will require.
They therefore followed hym into the fieldes wythout the suburbes towards Yseldon, and in the meane time the Maior rod into the Citie, raysed the Citizens, and shortly returned with a thousande wel armed men, Sir Robert Knowles being theyr leader.
The King other in hys companye reioysing of this vnlooked for ayde, sodainelye compassed the multitude of the commons wyth fighting men, which commons forthwyth throwing downe bowes, billes, and all other their weapons, fel themselues to the grounde, humbly crauing pardon, which was graunted, and Charters deliuered to the Captains of euery shire, who then departed home.
The rude multitude being thus dispersed, the King made William Walworth Maior, Nicholas Brember, Iohn Philpot and Robert Lande Aldermen of London· Knights in Smithfield· and vpon the said Hil were created the Erles Marshal and Penbroke.
And a little after Nicholas Twiforde, and Adam rmen of London were made Knightes.
Iacke Straw being taken, when at London he shoulde by iudgement of the Maior lose his heade, confessed as followeth.
The same time (sayth he) that we came to Black when we sent for the King, we purposed to haue murdered all the Knights, Esquiers and gentlemen that should haue come with him, and to haue ledde the king royally vsed, vp and downe, that with the sight of him, al men especially the common people mighte haue come vnto vs the boldelye, and when we had got togither an innumerable multitude, we woulde haue sodainly put to death in euery Countrey, the Lords and maisters of the common people, in whom mighte appeare to be eyther counsell or resistance againste vs: and speciallye we woulde haue destroyed the Knightes of Saint Iohns, lastlye we woulde haue killed the King himselfe, and all men that hadde of any possession, Bishoppes, Monkes, Chanons, Parsons, to be briefe, wée woulde haue dispatched: onlye begging Fryers shoulde haue liued, that might haue sufficed for ministring the Sacramentes in the whole Realme, for we would haue made Kings, Wat Tiler in Kente, and in euerye other shire one.
But bycause thys oure purpose was hyndered by the Archbyshoppe, we studyed howe to bring him shortly to hys ende.
Againste the same daye that Wat Tyler was killed, we purposed that euening (bycause that the poore people of London séemed to fauour vs) to sette fire in foure corners of the Citie, so to haue brent it, and to haue deuided the riches at our pleasures amongst vs.
He added that these things they purposed to haue done, as God should helpe him at the end of his life.
After thys confession made, hée was beheaded, and hys heade sette on London Bridge by Wat Tilers and many other.
The principal leaders of the commons were Wat Tiler· the second Iack Straw, the third Iohn Kirkby, the fourth Ale Threder, the fifth Thomas Scot, y^ sixth Ralph Rugge: these and many others were leaders of the Kentishe and Essex me~.

Here thinke good to note some Epistles of Iohn Ball and others, wyth some short notes of their Diuellish demeanor, vnder the colour of zeale and conscience, and so to ende thys matter.
IOhn Bal Saint Marie Priest, wel all maner of men, and biddeth them in the name of the Trinitie, Father, Son, and holy Ghost, stande manlike togither in truth, and helpe truth, and truth shal helpe you: now raigneth pride in price, couetise is holde wise, leacherie without shame, gluttonye without blame: enuie raigneth with treason, and slouth is taken in greate season.
IAcke Milner asketh helpe to turne his Mil aright, hee hathe grounden smal, smal, the kings sonne of heauen he shal pay for all: loke thy Mill go right with foure sayles, and the poste stande in stedfastnesse, with right and might, with skill and with wil, let might helpe right, and skil before wil, and right before mighte, then goeth our Mill arighte: and if might goe before righte, and will before skill, then is oure Mill misdight.
IAcke Trewman doeth you to vnderstande that falsenesse and guile hath raigned too long, and trueth hath bin sette vnder a locke, and falsenesse raigneth in euery flocke, no man maye come trueth too, but hee sings Si dedero: speake, spende, and speede, quoth Iohn of Bathon, and therefore sinne fareth as wilde floude, true loue is awaye that is so good, and Clearkes for wealth wurcheth them woe: God do bote, for now is time.
When these rebels burned the Sauoy, one of them tooke a goodly siluer péece and hid it in his bosome, but another had spyed him and tolde his fellowes, which hurled hym the péece of plate into the fire, saying: we be zealous of truth and Iustice, and not théeues and robbers.
Two and thirtie of them entring the seller of the Sauoy, drunke so muche of swéete Wines that they were not able to come out, but were shutte in with wood and stones that mured vppe the doore, they called and cryed seauen dayes, and were heard of many, but none came to helpe them and so they dyed there.
After a number of them hadde sacked the new Temple, what with labour, and what with wine, they lay down vnder the wals and howsing, and were slaine like swine, and one of them killed another for olde grudge and hatred, and others also made quicke dispatch of them.
Watte Tiler being killed, Iacke Strawe and other theyr principal Captaines hanged, the hope and confidence of the commons decayed, but bycause the mindes of the King and Nobles was yet wauering, séeing the people readie to mischiefe, they graunted to them Charters of manumission and suffered them to departe, the whiche being done, the king caused an army to be assembled from London, and sente into al Countryes that those who were his friendes should make haste to come to hym to London, furnished with horsse and armour, and it came to passe that wythin thrée dayes he had a. xl. thousande horssemen about him in séemely sort armed, he mustered them on Blacke Heath, himselfe ryding on a greate courser, with hys standarde borne before hym, when therefore so myghtye an armye was assembled, the Kyng was aduertised that the Kentishe men had eftsoones conspyred, wherevppon hée forth wyth sette forewarde, but by the mediation of the Nobles and greate men of Kente that vndertooke for them, he was stayde and pacisied wyth them, and then firste Iustices were sente to séeke and inquire of malefactours, and that Countrey became quiet at the sight of them.
Then the Maior of London sitting in iudgement, caused the malefactours to be tryed, as well of the Citie as also of Kente, Essex, Southsex, Norffolke, and Suffolke and other Countryes, that might be taken within the liberties of the Citie, and all those whome he founde guiltie of the foresayde Treason, he caused to hoppe headlesse, among the which were Iacke Strawe, Iohn Kirkesty, Alen Threder, &c. also Iohn Starling of Essex, that gloryed to haue beheaded the Archbishoppe, was beheaded hymselfe.
The king remayned nowe at London, nowe at Waltham, with a greate armye of armed menne, considering what was to be done for the commoditie of the realme.
At length the Counsell thoughte good to sende the Kings commission into euerye shire, for the resisting of the disquieters of the peace of the kyngdome.
These commissions did muche comforte the faythfull subiectes, and troubled the false, for they were nowe compelled to séeke corners, that before toke vpon them to doe all things abroade, lawyers nowe durst come forth of their dennes, and those which before fledde from the tyrannie of the time, looked for that nowe feared iudgement and iustice to bée done on them.
The commons being thus feared, but not in all places alike, they of Essex gathering a newe multitude togither at Byllarica, a village neare to Hatfielde Peuerell, decréed eyther to inioye lybertye gotten by force, or to dye in fyghting for the same, they sente to the Kyng then béeyng at Waltham messengers to knowe if hée thoughte good to permitte them to inioye their permitted lybertie, lyke to theyr Lordes, and that they shoulde not be co~pelled to come to Courts but only to gret Léetes twice in the yeare, vnto the which the King answered thus.
Oh miserable and hateful both to Land and Sea, not worthy to liue: Do yée require to be equall to your Lordes? yée were worthy to be put to moste shamefull death: But fith yée are come as Messengers, yée shall not dye nowe, to the ende yée may declare your answeares to your fellowes: declare to them therfore on the Kyngs behalfe, that as they were Husbandmen and bondmen, so shall they remaine in bondage, not as before, but more vile, without comparison far, vnto thys.
Whilest we lyue, and by Gods sufferaunce shal gouerne the Kingdome with Wit, Strength, goods, we wil endeuour our selues, to kéepe you vnder, so that the duety of your seruice, may be an example for posteritie, and that your matches both present, and that shall succéede, may euer haue before their eies, and as it were in a Glasse, your misery, and to you matter to curse, and feare to commit the like.
When the Messengers were gone, there was sente straightwayes into Essex, Thomas of Woodstocke Earle of Buckingham, and sir Thomas Percy brother to the Earle of Northumberlande, to represse the boldnesse of the sayde commons.
These Commons hadde fortified themselues wyth ditches and carriages: neuerthelesse, although there was a great number of them, with small businesse, they were scattred into the woods, where the Lordes enclosed them, least any of them might escape: it came to passe, that v. C. of them were slain, viij. C. of their horses taken, the other y^ escaped this slaughter, being gotte~ togither, hasted to Colchester, began to stir the townesmen to a new tumult, and when they profited not there, they weut to Sudbury, but the Lord Fitz Walter sir Iohn Harlestone followed them, and slewe as many of them as they list, shut vp the rest in prisons.
The king came to his Manour of Hauering at Boure, after to Chelmesford, where he appointed sir R. Trisilian his Iustice to set enquire of the malefactours, wherfore y^
Essex men séeing the euils y^ hung ouer their heades, there came aboue.
humbly to the King barefooted bareheaded, beséeching him of pardon and mercie.
To whom pardon was graunted, with condition, to delyuer the styrrers of the sayd trouble.
It came therefore to passe, that many were committed to worde, vpon whome, the Iustice charged xxiiij. men of their conscience to say the truth, and many being condemned, were put to execution, by drawing and hanging, nine or tenne being hanged on one beame.
The Iustices that before had sitte in Essex, Kent, London, and other places, for all the multitude that were to be executed, vsed to head the commons, till now it séemed not a kinde of death answerable to so many and manifest crimes.
These things were done in Essex, the King being present: the like by his Iustices was done in other Countreys.
Iohn Ball Priest being taken at Couentrie, was brought to Saint Albons, and there before the King condemned, drawne and quartered, the fiftéenth of Iuly.
He woulde not aske the King forgiuenesse, but vtterly despised him.
About the feast of All Sainctes, a Parliamente was beganne, which endured long, to small purpose, by reason of contention among the Lords, especially the Duke of Lancaster, and the Earle of Northumberland, whose quarrell in the ende was taken vp by the King, and then the Lordes procéeded to treate of the Kings businesse and the Realmes, but they lingered so long in vayne, that nothing was brought to effect, for hearing of the new Quéenes comming to Caleis, the Parliame~t was proroged.
There were diuers of ye Nobles sent to méete the Bride, and she was conuayde with all the glorie of the world vnto Douer, many both of hir Countrey, and also of England, attending on hir.

Also, noble women vsed high attire on their heads, piked like hornes, with long trayned Gownes, and rode on side Saddles, after ye example of the Quéene who first brought that fashion into this Land, for before, women were vsed to ride astride like men.
The solemnitie of the mariage being ended, the Parliament is now begon againe, in which, many articles are proponed and decréed, to wéete, of admitting Strangers to sell personally their wares, without impeachment of the Merchants of Englande: of the abrogating of Fires, and siluer garnishing of girdles &c. of the price of Wines, that is, that the Tonne should not excéede sixe Markes &c. William Vfford Earle of Suffolke, in this Parliament, ing elected by the Knightes of the Shires, to pronounce on their behalfes the businesse of the Realme, the very day and houre in which he should haue executed the businesse he had taken in hand, as he was going vp the staires that ledde vp into the Chamber where all the Nobilitie of the Realme sate, he sodeinly fell downe, and among his mens handes that were about to holde him, he yéelded vp the ghost, although being very merie, and féeling no euill, a little before, as euen at that instant he had entred Westminster Hall, of whose sodeine death, not onely all the Nobles of the Realme were greatly amazed, but all the meaner sort, for in all his life time he had shewed himselfe amiable to al men.
After his death, the Parliament was ended, after the Merchants of England had granted to the King a subsedie, the customes of wooll for foure yeares next ensuing; whiche the commons called Le Mtot.
In this Parliame~t, the Lords and commons requesting it, Sir Richard Scrope Knight was ordeyned as the man which in excellent knowledge and inflexible iustice, had not his like for his calling in this realm.
Edmond Mortimer Earle of March, departed this life in Irelande, after he had brought that land all in manner vnto peace quietnesse, hauing gouerned it most nobly wisely.
About the feast of S. Iohn Ante port latine, all the nobles of the Realme were called to London, and other that of custome were wont to be called, although y^
Lent before ther had bin another Parliament, as before we haue shewed, in which, by the petition of the Knightes of the Shires, Iohn Wraw Priest, that was leader of them that did rise at and Burie, was adiudged to hanging and drawing, though many beléeued that he woulde haue bin redéemed with money.
The xxj. of May was a great Earthquake in England at nine of the clocke, fearing the hearts of many, but in Kent it was most behement, where it soncke some Churches, and threw the~ downe to the earth.
There followed also another Earthquake the xxiiij. of May in the morning before the Sunne rising, but not so terrible as the first.
Sir Richard Scrope is depriued of the Cha~cellorship, which he had gouerned lawdably, Rob.
There arriued in a great tempest, a Shippe called a Carike, at Sandwich, an huge vessell, and so fraught with riches, that she might haue furnished the want of al the land, if the enuie of the inhabitants would haue permitted, but y^
Mercha~ts of Lo~don hauing much old wares, as frutes, spices, oyles, such like, they co~pounded with ye Ienewayes to forsake y^
Hauen, to passe ouer into Flanders, so for y^ couetousnes of a few, y^ whole Realm susteined great hindera~ce.
About the feast of S. Thomas the Apostle, great raynes and inundations of waters chanced, so that the water rose foure times more in heigth than before, drowning vp Uillages and Cattell, destroying Bridges and Milles.

About the moneth of May, the Bishop of Norwich sayled ouer the Seas into Flanders with a greate power, where he wanne the Townes of Graueling, Brugh, Dunkerke, and Newport.
Whilest these things are thus doing in Flanders, the King of England and his Quéene, with their Bohemians, visited the Abbeys of this Realme, to the whiche, their comming was very chargeable, for they came with an excessiue number, all which came to take, but not to giue.
The Scottes taking occasion of the time, for that a great number were gone ouer with the Bishop of Norwich, entred into Northumberland, and did much hurt to the inhabitants, taking prayes in euery place, and leading away the people prisoners, and carying them into Scotland: they tooke the Castell of Warke vpon the Riuer of Twede, and brent it.
About the feast of All Saincts, a Parliament was holden at London, in which, the halfe fiftéenth was granted to the King by the Laytie, and shortly after the halfe of a tenth by the Cleargie, a portion of which money, the Lords of the North demaunded, bycause in this Parliament they were appointed to defende those partes against the irruptions of Scottes, to whome, answere was made by Sir William Wikeham, Bishop of Winchester, that they were made for that cause, of poore men, rich me~ and Lords, that they might the more franckly kéepe the Scottes, and that the King and Lords of the South partes should be the lesse troubled.
And bycause the Scottes came not to this Parliament, according to couenant, and beside that did displeasures vnto the inhabitants of the North parts, it was decréed by this Parliament, that vnto faithbreakers, faith shoulde be broken againe, and that a chosen power should be sent thither, forth of Englande, vnder the leading of Thomas of Woodstoke, to wéete, a thousand Launces, and two thousand Archers, to restreyne their attemptes.
These things being knowne, the Scottes being afrayde of themselues, in the ende of the Parliament came, and were desirous to entreate of peace or truse, but the Englishmen hauing tried their falsehoode so often times, woulde neyther treate, nor compounde with them, but commanded them to returne home, and warned them to saue their heads as well as they might, and to defend their rightes.
The Scottes being returned, the Lordes of the North tooke vpon them to defende the Countrey, till Thomas of Woodstoke Earle of Buckingham were readie to come with a greater power.
The King tooke the temporalities of the Bishop of Norwich into his hands, bycause he was disobedient to his commandement when he sent to haue stayde him from his iourney into Flanders, and the Knightes that were ouer with him were put in prison, till they were redéemed with gold.
King Richard held his Christmas at his Manour of Eltham, and with him his Quéene Anne.

The night of the Purification of our Lady, great Lightning and Thunder happened, that put men in great feare: and shortly after Iohn Northampto~, otherwise called Combartowne, that had bin the yeare before Maior of London, that with his seditions had filled the Citie full of comber, attempted new troubles, for in contempt of the Maior that was elected for that yeare, Sir Nicholas Brembar Knight, he went vp and down with a multitude of seditious people to gard him, not once, but oftentimes, to the terrour of manie, and when the said Brembar Maior woulde haue withstanded his attemptes, the fauourers of the said Iohn Combertowne were turned into suche a furie, that a Cobler, which in his owne estimation séemed to be Maior, required the voyces of the communalty, for which cause, by the counsell of Sir Robert Knowles Knight, he was drawne out of his house, and committed to prison, as a stirrer of insurrection, which acte for that time staide the commotion of the commons, that were sayd to haue conspired at that time to haue murthered the elect Maior, and many other worthie men.
When Lente aproched, Iohn Duke of Lancaster, with his brother Thomas of Woodstoke, Earle of Buckingham, and an innumerable number of Knightes, Esquires, and Archers, went toward Scotland, but stayde in the North till all the victualles in the Countrey were consumed: he did more hurt to the inhabitants, than the Scottes had done before, at length, about the feast of Easter, he entred Scotland, but did little good.
The custodie of the Castell of Douer was vacant, by the death of Robert Ashtonwald, then was made Connestable thereof Simon Burley.
After Easter, the Nobles came to a Parliament at Salisburie, whither a certaine Irish Frier, of the order of the Carmelites, or white Friers, a Batcheler of Diuinitie, named Iohn Latimer, hasted, and accused the Duke of Lancaster, that he had deuised the Kings death, which Frier, was committed to Sir Iohn Holland Knight, till a day that was assigned him to make proofe of that he had sayde, but the night before the day giuen to the Frier, the sayde Sir Iohn Holland, and Sir Henry Greene, Knightes, put a corde about the Friers necke, and with the same corde tying him by the stones, hanged him vp from the grounde, laying stone of great weight vpon his bellie, till they by tormente had made an ende of his life.
The morrow after, they the Friers body to be drawne through the Towne as a Traytor, that they might put away all suspection, that he were put to death wrongfully: but it is to be wondred at, that neyther Esquire, Yeoman, nor Grome, or any other of meane estate, would harme the Frier, but the Knightes did it themselues, they were Judges, Officers, and Executioners, and this was the fruite of this Parliament, excepte that the King asked and had of the Laitie halfe a fiftéenth, and of the Cleargie halfe a tenth.
About this time, bycause the Scottes ceassed not to do diuers domages to the Northumbers, the Earle of Northumberland Henry Percy, prepareth to inuade Scotland, and to requite domage for domage, which enterprise accomplished, the Earle was no sooner returned, and sent home his army, but that the Scottes came againe, and heaped vp domage vpon domage in the Countrey.
This Sommer, Sir Iohn Philpot, Knighte, and a most noble Citizen of London, that trauelled for the commoditie of the Realme more than all other, and both with expences laide forth, and good affection borne, had oftentimes reléeued the King, departed this life, leauing none behinde him his like in good affections.
About the beginning of August, the Duke of Lancaster went into France, to treate with the Frenchmen of peace, or else of truce to be had, the Duke with his company of noble men remayning long there, when it was thought that he should haue brought glad and ioyfull newes to his Countrey, he returned with knowledge of warres, to followe the beginning of the next Sommer, the truce to endure but the first day of May, and so he returned, after he had spente
Many of the Nobles assembled at Reading, to represse the seditious sturres of Iohn Northampton, late Maior of London, that attempted greate and heynous enterprises, of the whiche he was conuict, hys owne Chapleyne vttering manye thynges that hée wente aboute and hadde deuised as well to the hinderance and harme of the King, as of the Citie of London, and when sentence shoulde haue bin pronounced against him, the King being presente, the wicked man made exclamation, and mainteyned that such iudgemente ought not to passe in absence of his Lorde the Duke of Lancaster, but yet the Justice vsed such words, Iohn (sayth he) the naughtie déedes that are obiected agaynste thée, thou oughtest to refell by battayle, or else by the lawes of the land to be drawne, hanged, and quartered, and when he stoode mute, nor would vtter one word, it was déecréede that he should be committed to perpetuall prison, and his goodes to be confiscate to the Kings vse, and that he shoulde not come within one hundred miles of London during his life, he was sente therefore to the Castell of Tintagell in the confines of Cornewall, and in the meane space the Kings seruants spoyled his goodes, Iohn More, Richard Northbery, and other, were likewise there conuict, and condemned to perpetuall prison, and their goodes confiscate to the King, for certaine congregations by them made against the Fishmongers in the Citie of London.
About the feast of Saint Martine, a Parliament was holden at London, in the whiche nothing was done worth the memorie, but that which still was in hand, and exacting of money of the Cleargie and common people, to mainteine the men of warre.
And besides this, there was a Combate fought in listes betwixte an Esquire of Englande, and one of Nauarre, that had accused the English Esquire, whose name was Iohn Welch, of Treason to the King and Realme, but the effect was, that when he was Captayne of Cherbrugh he forced the wife of this Nauaroys, as the sayde Nauaroys being afterward ouercome, and being readie to suffer death, did confesse, for the which cause, by the Kings iudgeme~t, he was drawne and hanged, although the Quéene and ma+ny other did make earnest intercessio~ to haue his life saued The Parliament was not yet ended when newe came out of the North of the taking of Berwike Castell by the Scottes, the custodie whereof, the Earle of Northumberland, Sir Henry Percy did possesse, by right of his predecessors.
The Scottes by mediation of money, got entrance into that Castel, by one that was put in trust with kéeping of it.
The Duke of Lancaster that loued not the Earle, was glad of this happe when he knew it.
It came to passe therefore by the Dukes procurement, that the Earle was condemned by iudgement of the Lords there present, the which execution was within a short while after releassed.
The Earle of Northumberland, through the Kings fauour restored to his life and possessions, without any long prepareth al furniture of warre to beséege and winne the sayd Castell of the~ that were within it, and after he had gathered a mighty armie, he sodeinly beséeged it, and after he had layne about it a certaine time, it was compounded betwixt them without, and them within, that they within should forsake the Castell, and haue their liues and moueable goodes, and for surrendring the Castell, they should haue of the Earle two thousand markes of English money, and by this meanes did the Earle recouer the Castell foorth of the Scottishmens hands.

Sir Iohn de Vienne that serued the French King, was sent into Scotland with a great multitude of Shippes and men of warre, that ioining with the Scottes, they might all England, and that whilst they draw the power of this Realme that way forth, the Frenche King with his Nauie and army, might the more at liberty enter other partes of the Realme, few or none being left at home to prohibit them their entrie.
The arriuall of the sayd Iohn being knowne in England, the King with all the Nobilitie prepared themselues to make a iourney thither: there came flocking vnto the King such a number of Knightes, Esquires, and Archers, as the like had not bin heard of in those dayes, in so much, as the number of Horsses amou~ted to thrée hundred thousand, as they were iudged.
The King reioyced héereat, as well he might, but the reioycing was shortly darkened at Yorke, by fiercenesse of Sir Iohn Holland the Kings brother, that slew the Lord Ralph Stafford, sonne to the Earle of Stafford, in the way as he went to the Quéene, whose seruant of houshold he was, and greatly in with hir, and he was no lesse beloued of the King, as he that had bin brought vp with him, and bin his playfellow from his tender age, where the King taking greate indiguation, determined to pursue the sayd Sir Iohn Holland: he caused therefore his goodes to be co~fiscate.
But Sir Iohn Holland fledde to Beuerley, there to enioy the libertie of the Church.
The Lady Iane the Kings mother, sente to intreate him for hir other sonne, and his brother, but when the messengers were returned to Wallingforde, and that the mother could perceyue no hope of grace to be gotten in that behalfe of the King, she tooke it heauie, and fell sicke, and within foure or ue dayes departed this life, hir body being seared and closed in Leade, was kept at Wallingford, till the Kings returne forth of Scotland, then to be buried at Stanford, in the Church of the Friers Minors.
In the moneth of August, the King of England with a mightie power entred Scotland, to whose force the Scottes and Frenchmen perceyuing themselues not able to matche, they séeke to get them into the wooddes places where they might be out of the way.
The English army then, the which there hath not bin séene a fairer, stronger, or greater, rideth through the Countrey, that was destitute of inhabitantes, yd of Cattell, wanting victualles, for the land was left desolate (as our men confessed) that they saw not so much as a bird, Owles only excepted.
They found gréene Corne on the grounde, very faire and plentifull, whiche they eyther eate vp with their Horsses, or treade downe with theyr féete, but the enimies fléeing battayle, our men did nothing to be accompted of, but brent the Abbey of Melroys, and the Towne of Edenborough, with such houses as they found by the way.
When our armie was come to Edenborough, and that victualles fayled them, many of them beganne to ware sicke, and some to die for hunger, wherevpon, the King returned with his armie into England.

The Archbishop therefore hauing made the Cleargie priuie, wente to the King, and declared to him that he with his Cleargie of their whole consents and frée willes, had prouided for his vses a Tenth, which graunt the King so thankefully receyued, that hée openly affirmed, that he had rather haue this frée graunt, than any other foure times double, that were constreyned.

He was (as he affirmed) chased out of his Realme by the Tartarians, and for that cause he got great giftes of the Christian Priuces.

He with a greate power tooke the Seas, and landed in Spayne, at the Hauen of Greyne, on the euen of Saint Lawrence, with all his Nauie in safetie.
At the sute of the King of Spayne, King Richard releassed out of prison Iohn Northampton, Iohn More, and Richarde Norburie.
The Londoners fearing y^ comming of the French K. ranne to their walles, pulled downe houses néere about ye Citie.
About Michaelmas, the Nobles came to the Parliame~t at London, with great numbers of armed men, to the ende they might be readie to withstand the Frenchmen who were comming, but through contrarie windes returned.
The King created Robert Vere Marquesse of Irelande, Duke of Ireland.
Not lo~g after this, Michaell de la Pole was by y^
Knights of the Parliament deposed from his Chancellorship, and amerced to pay to the King
Markes, but the King caused this to take small effect.

Robert de Vere Duke of Ireland for sooke his wife, a yong Lady noble faire, borne of the Lady Isabell, daughter to y^ noble K. Edward, maried another that came with Quéene Anne forth of Boheme: she was called in the vulgar tong of hir Conntrey Lancecrona.
The Lordes tooke indignation héerewith, especially the Duke of Glocester, Unkle to ye yong Lady that was forsaken.
The Duke of Ireland studied how to take the Duke of Glocester out of ye way.
Easter was now past, the time, in whiche the Duke of Ireland shoulde haue transported into Ireland, but least there shoulde be too muche sturre in the Realme among the Lords, the King as it were to bring him to the water side, goeth with him into Wales, as not to leaue him, but there to kéepe him, that they might denise how to take away the D. of Glocester, the Earles of Arundell, Warwike, Darby, Notingham, with other.
There were with the~ the Earle of Suffolke, Michaell at Pole, Robert Tresilian Justice, many other, which no more slowly than the D. of Ireland, conspired the death of the said noble me~.
After a great time was passed, the King, as if the Duke of Irela~ds iourney had bin forgotten, returned with him and the other forth of Wales, to the Castell of Notingham, there to treate of the death of the said noble men: there therfore he sent for diuers from Lo~don, whome he knew would be readie to which way soeuer they should be moued: he called thither also all the Sherifes and Justices of the Realme, and there interdited the Lords of many crimes which the King had imagined against them.

This yeare when the realme of England séemed to inioy the chiefest peace y^ might be, by reason of the Kings marriage, the great riches y^ were heaped vp togither by the same, by the reason of y^ truce of.
yeares established the presence of so many noble men as y^ like no forrain realme was able to shew, sodainely all things were troubled and brought into a turmoyle, whiles the King at Plashy in Essex, vpon a sodaine toke his vncle the D. of Glo. by force of armes, he suspecting no such thing, caused hym to be conueyed to Caleis, there to be kept in prison, and caused the Earle of Warwicke to be arrested and imprisoned, the same day that he had bidde~ him to dinner, notwithstanding that he shewed him very good countenance, and had promised him great friendship, beside that he deceiued the E. of Arundale, wt faire words, (who was wel able to haue defended himself, to haue deliuered his friends, the D. of Glocester the E. of Warwick· who notwithstanding he yéelded himself quietly, he sent him to the Ile of Wight, there to be imprisoned vntil y^
And to y^ end there should be no co~motion among y^ co~mons for the imprisoning of the nobles he caused to be proclaymed y^ the apprehension of them, was not for any old displeasure, but for new transgressions committed against y^ k. shortly after he caused y^ said nobles to be indited at Notingha~, suborned such as shold appeach the~ in the next Parliament, to wit Ed Erle of Rutland, T.

And in mean yeseason the Kyng assembled togither to guarde his parson, many malefactors of the Countie of Chester which kept watch and warde both day and night about him.
Then the K. caused a greate and generall Parliament to be summoned at Westminster, when he caused a great Hall to be builded in the midst of the Pallaice betwixte the Clocke tower, and the doore of the greate Hall.
This Parliament began aboute the fiftéenth of September, at the beginning whereof Edwarde Stafforde Byshop of Excester L. chanceller, made a proposition or sermo~, in the which he affirmed that the power of the K. was alone and perfect of it self, those that impeached it were worthye to suffer pain of the law: to this Parliament al the Nobles came with their retinue in armes, for feare of the King: the prelocutours were Knights, in who~ no goodnesse at al could be found, but a natural couetousnesse, vnsatiable ambition, intollerable pride, and hatred of the truth, their names wer Iohn Bushy, William Bagot and Thomas Grene.
These required chiefely to haue the Charters of pardons reuoked dissanulled: and Bushy sayde to the K. bycause we are charged to say what they be that haue committed any offence against your maiestie, regall aucthoritie, we saye that Tho. duke of Glocester Richard E. of Arundale, in the. xviij. yeare of your raigne, haue trayterously compelled you, by mean of the new Archbishop of Canterburie then Lord Chancellour, to graunt to them a commission to gouerne your Realme, and to dispose of the state thereof, to the preiudice of youre maiestie and royaltie.
The same daye was that commission dissanulled with all Articles dependyng therevppon.
Also the generall pardon graunted after the greate Parliament by them procured, and one speciall pardon for the Erle of Arundale were reuoked.
Also there was a peticion made by ye commons, I. Bushy speaking for them, that the generall pardon procured and gotte forthe, the Archebyshoppe of Canterburie then Lorde Chancellor procuring it should be disanulled, and he to be iudged a Traytor for granting to it, wherevpon the Archbishop rose and would haue answered, but the King sayde, to morrow to morrow, but he came not into the Parliament house againe: the King said, that he would deliberate of the commons petition.
Also it was established, that any Traytor conuicted, to stand against the Kings regalitie, should be adiudged worthie to suffer punishment to be appoynted for such offence.
Also it was enacted, that criminall causes from be determined in euery Parliament, and then licence being had to depart, a great sturre was made as is vsed, wherevpon the Kings Archers, in number four thousand, compassed the Parliament house, thinking there had bin in the house some broyle or fighting, with their bowes bent, their arrowes set in them, and drawing, readie to shoote, to the terrour of all that were there, but the King héerewith comming, pacified them.
On the next day, the Prelates were inioyned, vpon payne of losing their temporalities, that they should the same day agrée vpon some procurator, to consent in their names to al things in that Parliament to be dispatched, and the King had these words: Sir Iohn Bushy, bycause many desire that would explane the fiftie persons exempted in y^ general pardon, wil briefely, that what man soeuer desireth this, is worthie of death: first, bicause he fléeth: secondly, bycause haue excepted those that are to be impeached in this Parliament: thirdly, bycause other of their associates hearing the~ oppressed, would be afraide where no feare is.
On the next day, the Archbishop of Canterbury commeth to the palace to appeare in the Parliament, but the King commanded him by the Bishop of Carelile, that he shoulde returne to his house, and from thenceforth he appeared not.
The Prelates made Thomas Percy the Kings Steward of houshold, their procurator, to consent in all things in this Parliament to be done.
Also Sir Iohn Bushy had these words, our soueraigne Lord the King, bycause the second Article in the Parliament is for punishmente to be appoynted for suche as violate the Kings royall authoritie, beséech your grace that you will authorice me by way of appealing, of accusing, or impeaching, with licence to make declaration from one to the rest so often and when to me and to my fellowes it may séeme expedient, and it was graunted, then Bushy had these words: accuse Thomas of Arundell, Archbishop of Canterbury, of thréefold treason.
Frst, of the commission in granting the regiment or gouernement of the Realme to Thomas Duke of Glocester, and to Richard Earle of Arundell at his instance, who rather bycause he was your Chancellour, should haue refused it.
Secondly, for that vnder pretext of that trayterous commission, they trayterously vsurping the iurisdiction of your regalitie, or royall authoritie, held a solemne Parliament trayterouslie in preiudice of your regalitie.
Thirdly, bycause that by the sayde trayterous vsurping, Sir Simon de Burley, and Sir Iames Barnes Knightes, and faithfull lieges to you, were trayterouslie murthered, and put to death, of which things, we your commons demaund iudgement, worthie of so high treason, to be terribly pronounced by you, and bycause the Archbishop is a man of great consanguinitie, affinitie, power, and most politike witte, and cruell nature, for the preseruation of your estate, and the whole Kingdomes, by the petition of this present Parliament, require that he may be put into safecustodie, vntill the finall execution of his iudgemente.
The King héerevnto answered, that for the excellence of his dignitie he would take deliberation till the next morrow, and all other that were put into the same commission, he pronounced them to be his faithfull liege people, and voyd from that treason, and especially Alexander Neuell, late Archbishop of Yorke, and then Sir Edmond of Langley.
Duke of Yorke, Unkle to the King, and Sir William Wikeham Bishop of Winchester, that were put into the same commission, with teares fell downe on the ground before the King, and gaue him humble thankes for that grace and benefite bestowed on them.
Also on Saint Mathewes day, the Earle of Rutland, the Earles of Kent, Huntington, Notingham, Somerset, and Salisburie, with the Lordes Spencer and Scrope, in a sute of redde Gownes of Silke garded, and bordered with white Silke, and embrodered with Letters of Golde, proponed the appeale by them to the King at Notingham, before set foorthe, in the which, they accused Thomas Duke of Glocester, Richard Earle of Arundell, Thomas Earle of Warwike, and Thomas de Mortimere, Knight of the premised treasons, and of an armed insurrection at Haringey Parke, trayterouslie attempted against the King, and putting in sureties for the prosecuting of their appeale.
Richarde Earle of Arundell was arreigned in a redde Gowne, and a Scarlet whood, and forthwith the Duke of Lancaster sayde to the Lorde Neuell, take from hym hys girdle and whoode, and so it was done, and héerewith the Articles of appeale béeing to the sayde Earle declared, with a valiaunt and a bolde mynde, hée denyed that hée was a Traytor, and required the benefite of the pardon, protesting that he would not goe from the fauour of the King and his grace.
The Duke of Lancaster sayde to hym, thou Traytor, that pardon is reuoked.
Also, the Duke of Lancaster sayde, why diddest thou purchase thy pardon, the Earle answered, to escape the tongues of myne enimies, of whome thou arte one, and verily, as farre forth as toucheth Treason, thou hast more néede of pardon than I.
The Earle answered, sée well that these persons haue accused me of Treason, shewing the appealementes· but truely, they all lye, was neuer Traytor, but aske alwayes the benefyte of my pardon, the whyche youre Grace granted to me within these sixe yeares now last past, being of full age, and of your francke good will and proper motion.
Then sayd the King, did so grant it that it should not be against me: then sayde the Duke of Lancaster, then the graunt auayleth not.
The Erle answered, truly of that pardon know lesse than thy selfe, that was then on the further side the Seas.
Then said Sir Iohn Bushy, that pardon is reuoked by the King, the Lordes, and vs his faithfull people: the Earle answered, where be those faithful people? know thée well and thy company how ye are gathered togither, not to deale faithfully, for the faithful people of the Realme are not héere, and therefore the people do lamente for me, and well know that thou hast bin euer false.
And then Bushy and his fellowes cried out, Behold soueraigne Lord and King, how this Traytor goeth about to reyse sedition betwixt vs, and those people that are at home.
Then rose the Earle of Darby and sayde, didst not thou say thus to me at Huntington, where we were first assembled togither to rise, that it was the best afore all things to take the King.
The Earle sayd to the Earle of Darby, thou lyest on thy head, neuer thought of my soueraigne· Lorde the King, but that that was good, and for his honor.
Then sayd the King, didst not thou say to me in time of thy Parliament, in the Bath behinde the White Hall, that Sir Simon de Burley was worthie of death for many causes, and answered, that knew no cause of death in him, and yet thou and thy fellowes didst trayterouslie put him to death, and then the Duke of Lancaster pronounced iudgement against him in this manner: Richard, Iohn, Steward of England iudge thée to be a Traytor, and condemne thée to be drawne and hanged, to be beheaded and quartered, and thy lands, tailed and not tailed, from thée and from thine heires of thy body descending, to be confilcate: then the King for reuerence of his bloud, commanded him only to be beheaded, and then was he ledde to the Tower hill, and there beheaded, and was buried at the Augustine Friers in London.
Also the same day, the King appoynted the Lord Cobham (accused by the commons) to be arraigned.
Also vpon the Saterday, Sir Thomas de Mortimer was sommoned, vpon payne to be banished as a Traytor, within sixe moneths to come to be tried in iudgement: and then saide the King, peraduenture the Earle of March can not take him, and therefore will so long stay for his certificate out of Ireland.

Then the King demanded of him by whome he was allured to ioyne with them, and he answered, by Thomas Duke of Glocester, and the Abbot of Saint Albons, and a Monke recluse in Westminster, and euer besought the King of grace and mercie, and the King granted him life to be led in perpetuall prison out of the Realme, his goodes moueable and vnmoueable to be confiscate, as the Earle of Arundels had bin, and the King commanded that he should be had to the Tower of London, and after, to be conuayde to the Castell within the Isle of Man, vnder the wardship of William Scrope, then Lord of the sayd Ile, to remayne there in perpetuall prison, and on the morrow, the King granted to him his wife fiue

Roger Mortimere Earle of March, and of Vlstar in Ireland, lying there in a Castel of his, there came on him a great multitude of wilde Irishmen to assayle him, and he issuing out, fought manfully, till he was by them hewen to péeces, whose death the King determined to reuenge.
About Candlemas, dyed Iohn of Gaunt D. of Lancaster, at the Bishop of Elyes Inne, in Holborne by London, and was honourably buryed in S. Paules Church at London, his sonne Henry Duke of Hereford being then beyond the seas.
Ships, sayled from Milford Hauen, towards Ireland, and arriued at Waterford on the last day of Maynfrem whence, he marched with his armie of thirtie thousande, to Kilkenny, fourescore miles within the Countrey, and there remayned xiiij. dayes, tarying for Edward Duke of Aumarle.
On Midsommer euen he went from thence toward Mackmore, who remayned amongst the woods with me~, right hardy, and such as séemed but little to feare the Englishmen.
At the entring of the woods, the King commanded fires to be vsed, so that many a house, and many a village was brent, there the King made the Duke of Herefords sonne Knight, with ten other.
Pioners were appoynted to fell the woods, and make wayes for ye Englishmen.
The Irishme~ feared greatly the shot of the Englishmen, but yet with their Dartes they assayled, and slewe diuers as they caught them at aduantage.
The Unkle of Mackmore came in and yéelded himselfe to the King, with a withie about his necke, and many other naked and bare legged, did the like, all which, the King pardoned.
After this, the King sente to Mackmore, promising him, that if he would come in as his Unkle had done, with the withie about his necke, he should be pardoned: but he vtterly refusing, sayd, he would fight to death in defending his right, for he knew the Englishmen wanted victualles, and more than they had brought with them could not be bought for Gold or Siluer.
There was already such scarcitie, that there were some four, some sixe, that had but a small lofe of bread to liue by the day, and some that eate not a grayne in fiue dayes togither.
day of June, toward Diuelin, at what time Mackmore sent a beggar, with notice to the King, that hée would be his friend, and aske him mercy, or else, if it pleased him to treate of peace, to send some noble me~ to him: whervpon the Earle of Glocester was sent, who led with him the reregard wherof he was captayne, being two C. Lances, a M. Archers: betwixt two woods farre from the Sea they mette with the Irish.
Mackmore himselfe rode on a white Horsse, without saddle or other furniture, that cost him (as was sayde) foure hundred Kowes, whiche Horsse he ranne downe the hill, that the beholders reported they neuer had séene Hare nor Déere to haue runne so swiftly.
In hys righte hande he bare a Darte greate and long, whiche he threwe excéeding well.
There the Earle and hée talked a good whyle, aboute the murthering of the Earle of March, and after of other thynges, but agrée they coulde not, and so departed.
The Earle aduertised the King what he had fou~d, which was nothing, but that the enimie woulde crie mercie, so as he might be sure to haue peace without other griefe, otherwise, he would (so long as he liued) defend himselfe: wherefore, the King (in his wrath) not knowing what lette might happen, sware, that he would neuer depart Irelande, till he had him eyther aliue or dead.
The host dislodged for lacke of victualles, they were a thirtie thousands at their comming ouer, that lay then at Diuelin fiftéene dayes, the King forthwith deuiding his armie into thrée partes, sente them out to séeke Mackemore, promising an hundreth Markes to him that could bring him in, which offer was well hearkened vnto, for it sounded well, but he could not be caught: and the same day, Edwarde.
Earle of Rutlande, Duke of Aumarle, Connestable of Englande, arriued with an hundreth Sayle, of whose comming, the King was verie glad, though he indéede had taried long, and mighte haue come muche sooner.
They remayned sixe wéekes at Diuelin, and heard no newes out of Englande, the passage was so dangerous, the winde béeing contrary, and tempestes so greate, at length, came a Shippe with heauie newes, how the Duke of Hereforde, and now by the deceasse of his father Duke of Lancaster, was arriued in England at Rauenspore beside Wadlington, in Yorkeshire, and had beheaded William Scrope Earle of Wilshire, Treasourer of Englande, Iohn Bushy, Henry Greene, and other, and had caused Thomas Arundell, Archbishop of Canterbury, to preach againste King Richarde, who also shewed a Bull procured from Rome, promising remission of sinnes to all those whiche should ayde the sayde Henry in conquering of his enimies, and after their death, to be placed in Paradise, which preaching, moued manye to cleaue to the Duke.
Upon this newes the King being perswaded to make hast ouer, the Duke of Aumarle sayde, it was better to stay till hys Shippes mighte bée brought togither, for there were but an hundreth readie to make Sayle, wherevpon, Iohn Mountacute Earle of Salisburie, was sente with a power, whilest the King going to Waterforde mighte gather hys Fléete, who promised within sixe dayes to haue followed hym.
The Earle of Salesburie landed at Conwey, where hée was soone aduertised, howe the Duke had taken the more parte of Englande, and that all the Lords were got to him, with more than thréescore thousand men.
The Earle of Salesburie caused to sommon the Welchmen, and them of Cheshire, to come to him, so that (wéening the King had bin arriued at Conwey within foure dayes there were come togither fortie thousand men, ready to goe against the Duke of Hereford, where they stayd fourtéene dayes, but when they saw the King came not, they stealed away, and left the Earle of Salisburie in manner alone, so that vnneath he had a C. men with him.
The Duke of Hereford aduanced towards the Earle of Salisburie, who withdrew him into Conwey.
The King through euill counsell stayd after the Earles departure eyghtéene dayes, and then arriued at Milford Hauen, from whence, about midnight following, desguised like a Priest, for feare to be knowne, with thirtéene persons only, who went to Conwey, thinking the Earle of Salisburie had there helde the fielde.
There were with him the Dukes of Excester and Surrey, and the Earle of Glocester, that continued faithfull vnto the last houre.
There were thrée Bishops also, of which, two did not like good men, the Bishop of Lincolne, and Saint Dauids, but the third continued faithfull, that was, the Bishop of Carelile.
He had also two Knightes, Stephen Scrope, and William Fireby, and Ianico, a Gascoigne.
The King rode so warely, that he came to Conwey at the breake of the daye.
Great sorrow and lamentation was made by the King and the Earle at their méeting, for that the Earles host was dispersed and gone, some to the Duke, and some otherwayes.
The Duke of Aumarle, Connestable, and chiefe gouernour of the Kings armie at Milford, immediately whe~ the Kings departure was knowne, he sayde to the Souldiers, let vs shift for our selues maysters, for the King is fledde, wherevpon euery man trussed, and away.
Sir Thomas Percy Steward of houshold, talking with the Connestable, also departed, and tooke their way through Wales.
The Welshmen séeing such disorder, assembled them togither, and spoyled the Englishmen of all their goodes, and sent them packing in their dublets, with white staues in their hands, for there rode héere tenne, héere twentie, héere fiftie, héere an hundred, and so the Welchmen comming downe the Mountaynes, the English lost that they had.
The King had many Horsses of beyond the Sea broode, and great riches in apparell and iewels, which was in the kéeping of Sir Thomas Percy, who with the Connestable came to Duke Henry of Hereford, and more than fiue hundred of their companye, all naked, whome the Welchmen had despoyled, and beaten well.
The King being at Conwey in great discomfort, sent the Dukes of Excester and Surrey, to Henry Duke of Hereford and Lancaster, to know what his meaning was, himselfe remayning still at Conwey in great perplexitie, and with him the Earle of Salisburie, the Bishop of Carelile, Sir William Ferebe Knight, Sir Stephen Scrope mine Author, and another Frenchman, in all but xvj. persons, then was newes brought to the King how his Connestable had demeaned him, and likewise his Steward, that had caused his riches to be brought aland, and going through Wales with it, the Welchmen had taken it.
The King then by the aduise of the Earle of Salisburie departed from Conwey vnto Beawmareis, a ten miles off, and from thence, he went to Carnaruan.
Beawmaris was a strong Fortresse if it had bin manned and victualled.
Carnaruan is a faire Towne, and a strong Castell, but these were vnprouided of all things, so that for fiue or sixe nightes he lay very hard and base, and for victualles, there was none, wherefore he returned againe to Conwey, where he sore lamented his estate.
The Dukes of Excester and Surrey entring the Citie of Chester, which Duke Henry had taken, were brought streight to the Castell to the Duke, who was glad to sée them, and forthwith asked the Duke of Excester what newes, who tolde him from poynt to poynt, what shame and dishonour it woulde be to him, if he dealt so vniustly towardes his Prince, and that through him he were deposed: hée therefore demaunded with spéede: but the Duke of Lancaster was as slow to dispatch him, and tolde hym he shoulde not goe for one wéeke, and that the King was not well aduised to sende hym and his fellow, béeing men of such calling, sith he had other ynow of meaner estate to do the message: so they remayned to their great discomfort.
The Duke of Excester, Duke Henry still kepte in hys company, but the Duke of Surrey was committed to safekéeping within the Castell of Chester.
There is a Castell sixe miles from Chester, called Beston Castell, builded on a Rocke, verye strong by scituation, therein were an hundred men of armes, chosen and able men, but not diligent, for they deliuered it to the Duke, where they might well ynough haue kept it, the ascending is so stéepe: it was victualled for sixe yeares.
There was founde within it Coyne better than an hundred thousande Markes, beside other Jewels, which King Richard caused to be kepte, to the value of two hundred thousande Markes, all which Duke Henry tooke wyth him, and returned to Chester, and there taking counsell of his friendes what was best to bée done, the Archbishop of Canterburie sayde, that sith the Kyng was in Wales, whych was a Countrey strong, by reason of the Mountaynes, so that it was impossible for an Armie to passe wyth bagge and baggage, hée thought it best to sende vnto King Richarde, and to make hym beléeue that hée sought nothing but peace, and a Parliamente to bée made, wherein, those that had offended in putting to death his Unkle the Duke of Glocester, shoulde bée punished, and so from thenceforth the King and the Duke to be good friendes, and that it should be at the Kings pleasure to appoynte the day and place for thys Parliamente, for withoute thys shifte, it shoulde bée vnpossible for the Duke to gette hym into his handes, for hée mighte departe by Sea when hée woulde, hauing retayned at Conwey Shippes for that purpose.
All the other Lords assenting to this counsell, the Duke appoynted the Earle of Northumberland to go to the King with four hu~dred Launces, and a thousand Archers, which Earle, when he came to Flint Castell, had it deliuered to his hands: from thence he hasted to Rudland, which was also giuen ouer to him: then laying vnder a rocke two great embushments of his people, with commandemente to kéepe that passage, he went with fiue other in his company by the Sea coast, till he came before the Towne, and then he sent an Herault to the King for a safeconduct, to come to his presence, to declare his message from the Duke about an agréement, which safeconduct being granted, he passed the water, and entred the Castell of Conwey, where he founde the King, and the Earle of Salisburie.
he declared to them that peace woulde be made if he would be a good Judge and a true, and cause those that should be named, to be tried by iustice at a certayne day of Parliament at Westminster, which he and the Duke should holde togither, and that the Duke might kéepe his place of high Judge as his father and other auncesters before him had done, for the space of one hundred yeares.
Those that he would haue to be tried by the Law, were the Duke of Excester, the Duke of Surrey, the Earle of Salisburie, the Bishop of Carelile, and Thomas Marke, which fiue, had giuen the King counsell to put his Unkle y^
Duke of Glocester to death, and then if it should please him to pardon the Duke his wrath, he would be readie to come to him on his knées to aske him mercie, and so they might goe to London togither, or the one one way, and the other another.
The Earle offered to sweare that all this shoulde be perfourmed, and that the Duke had assured him by oth to stand to it.
The King liking that it should be at his libertie to go eyther in companie with the Duke, or alone vnto London, purposed to take the offer, and so to pretend some excuse for his going alone, after he should méete with the Duke, as lacke of victualles, or such like, and so to take a byway thorough Wales, and there to rayse a power, he accorded to goe to the Duke, and then (Masse being celebrate) the Earle of Northumberlande sware vpon the host, that the Duke should holde all that he had tolde the king.
The Earle hasted the king forwarde to horssebacke, but the King prayed the Erle to go before vnto Rutland, there to prepare dinner.
The erle rode a pace till he came where he mighte sée his people vnder the mountaine, whom he muche commended for obseruing his commaundement.
The King passing the water rode a four miles before he came to the Rock, where when he sawe the ambushes was sore abashed, knowing well he was betrayed by the Earle, for he was in such a place as he coulde not escape.
The Sea beating on the one side, and the Rock kéeping him in on the other, and if he shoulde haue fled backe, they woulde haue caught him, or he could haue come to Conway, for he had not past thrée and twentie in all of his company.
The K. disse~ding the Rocke, the Earle came and knéeling down excused the matter, saying· he hadde caused those people to come to guarde his person, but the king tolde him, fewer wold haue serued, and that it was contrarie to his othe, for he had promised to haue but sixe in his company, and sayde therefore that he would goe backe to Conway, but the Earle aunsweared, that nowe sith he had him, he would leade him to the Duke as he had promised ten dayes since, and so he caused Breade and Wine to bee broughte and offered the king who durst not refuse it, and after leaping on horssebacke againe they rode to Rutlande to dinner, and after to Flinte, where they lay that night.
The Morrow being the two and twentie day of August, the King got him to the Castell Wals, where he beheld the D. with al his host of an hundred thousand men comming by the sands.
there came before that were departed from the army, the Archbishop of Canterburie, sir Thomas Percy and the Earle of Rutland from whom the Duke had taken the office of Conestable, more for a colour, than for displeasure, for they bare the Dukes order, and not the Harte, whyche was the kings, the Archbishoppe entred firste, and after the other with a great traine, they went vp to the dungeon, and then the King came downe from the walles, vnto who~ they did reuerence lowlye on their knées, the King toke them vp, and drew the Archbishop apart, and they two talked lo~g togither, but the Earle of Rutland kept him aloof.
They toke horsse againe, and rode towards the Duke that now approched neare.
The Kyng went vp againe to the walles, lame~ting sore when he saw the Dukes hoste within two bowe shootes of the Castell, who compassed it rounde about down to the sea.
The Earle of Northumberland wente forthe to the Duke, who after long talke, concluded that the duke should not enter the Castel before the King had dyned, for he was fasting: so the Earle returned, and the King was set to dynner, with whome sate his assured friends the Earle of Salisburie, and the Bishop of Carlile, sir Steuen Scrope, and Feribe, they sat long and eate little, for they had no haste to rise.
After dinner the Duke entred the Castel all armed, his Basenet excepted.
King Richard came downe to méete the Duke, who as soone as he saw the King, fell downe on hys knées, and comming neare vnto him, he knéeled the second time with his hat in his hand, and the king then put off his hoode, and spake first, faire cousin of Lancaster yée are righte welcome.
The Duke bowing lowe to the grounde answeared, my Lord, am come before you sent for me, the reason why wil shew you.
The co~mon fame among your people is suche, that yée haue for the space of twentie or two and twentie yeares, ruled them very rigorously, but if it please our Lorde will helpe you to gouerne better.
The Kyng aunswered, fayre cousin of Lancaster, sith it pleaseth you, it pleaseth mée wel.
The Duke spake as yée haue heard to the king, he spake also to the Bishop of Carlile, to sir Stephen Scrope, and to Feribe, but to the Earle of Salisburie he spake not, whereby the Earle perceyued that the Duke hated him deadly.
The duke with an high sharp voyce, bad bring forth the Kings horsses, and then two little nagges not worthe fortie franks, were brought forth, the King was set on the one, and the Earle of Salisburie on the other: and thus the Duke brought the King from Flinte to Chester, where he was delyuered to the Duke of Glocesters sonne, and to the Earle of Arundales sonne that loued him but a little, for he had put theyr fathers to death, who ledde hym strayghte to the Castel.
The thirde day they went to Nantwich, and the next daye to newe Castle, and there the Earle of Warwickes son mette the~, and so iournying forth, the next day they came to Stafford, after they departed to Lichfield, where the K. thought to haue escaped, slypping downe into a Gardaine out of a Windowe of a great Tower, but he was espyed and thrust into the Tower againe: from Liechfielde the Duke went to Couentrie, but before they coulde come thyther the Welchmen did them much harme and slew many of them, and the Englishmen, when they by great chaunce coulde take anye of the Welchmen, they tyed them to their horsse tayles, and drewe them after them, through ways ful of stones, caused them to die miserablye.
The Duke passed from Couentrie to Deintrie, the next day to Northampton, from thence to Dunstable, then to Saint Albons, and a fiue or sixe miles before hys comming to London, the Maior and the Companyes in their lyueries, with greate noyse of Trumpets mette the Duke, doyng more reuerence to hym than to the Kyng, reioycing that God had sente them suche a Prince, that had conquered the Realme within one monthes space.
When the Duke came within two miles of the Citie, the duke caused the hoste to stay, and then said to the commons of the Citie.
My maisters beholde here youre King, consider what yée will doe wyth him.

The same time the Scottes cruelly entred into England, for they supposed all the Lords beyond Humber to be occupyed in the parties of Wales, but the Erles of Northumberlande, Henrie Percie, and his sonne Henrie with the Earle of Dunbarre, (that a good whyle agone hauing forsaken the Scottes, had sworne to be true to the King of England with a number of armed men plentie of archers, sodainly came to resiste the Scottes as they woulde haue retourned home, after they hadde spoyled and brente the Countrey, but nowe vppon a sodayne theyr waye was forelayde, so that they muste néedes abyde and take a place to fighte vppon: they chose therefore a mountaine neare to the Towne of Wollor, called Halydowe Hill, in the whiche they place themselues wyth theyr armed men and Archers, which when our men beheld, leauing the way in which they stoode against the Scottes, they clynie the hill that stoode ouer against the Scottes, and without delaye of time, our Archers placed in the valley, set their arrowes against the Scottes battayle, that they might by some means force them to come downe: on the other side, the Scottishe Archers let flye at our men, who yet after they felt the grieuous waighte, and as it had bin a shower or tempest of the arrowes shotte by the Englishmen, they fledde.
The Earle Dowglas perceyuing his men so to flée, for he was their generall leader, tooke hys Speare, and manfullye wyth a multitude came down the Hyll, trusting doubtlesse in his armour and ye armour of hys complices that hadde bin thrée yeares in makyng, and forced himselfe to runne vpon the Archers, whiche when the Archers sawe, they stepped backe, and shotte so fiercely, that they pierced the armed mens bodies, stroke throughe theyr Helmets, ryued their Speares, and rente theyr armoure wyth lyghte adoe.
Earle Dowglas hymselfe was wounded in fiue places, the residue of the Scottes that were not come beside the Hyll, turnyng backe from the arrowes that flewe, fledde awaye, but theyr flyghte nothing auayled them whilest the Archers followed them, but that they were compelled to yéelde themselues.
Earle Dowglas also was taken, and manye drowned in the Riuer of Tweede, whylest they knewe not the Fourdes, to the number of fiue hundered (as was sayde.)
In thys battayle no Lorde, no Knighte, nor Squire, gaue anye stroke to the enimyes, but onely God gaue the victorie to the Englishe Archers, the Lordes and armed menne béeyng onelye lookers on.
That daye the flower of the Scottishe was taken, to witte, the Earle Dowglas, Murdake the eldest sonne of the Duke of Albanie, that was heyre apparente to the Realme of Scotlande: The Earles of Murrey, Angus, and Orkeney, the Lordes of Mountgomorie, Erskin, and Gram, with manye other Knyghtes· to the number of fourescore, besides Esquires Yeomen, whose number was not knowne.
There were slayne of Barons, the Lord Gordon, the Lord Iohn of Swinton that was false to both the Realmes &c.
Edmond Mortimere which before was taken by Owen Glendouer dewe, now professed to take Owens part against King Henry, and did contract mariage with the daughter of the sayd Owen.
In a Parliament at London which beganne the morrow after Michaelmas day, and lasted seauen wéekes, there was granted to the King a tenth and a halfe of the Cleargie, a tenth of the borough townes, and a fiftéenth of the commo~s through the Realme.
The messengers that had bin sent for Ioane, late wife to Iohn of Mountfort Duke of Briteyne, returned with hir into England, and landed at Falmouth in Cornewall.
The King met with hir at Winchester the seauenth of February, where they were married in the Churche of Saint Swithen.
The sixe and twentith of February she was Crowned at Westminster.
In the Sommer following, by the Townes of Bedforde and of Broklesward, Monsters were séene mornings and euenings to come out of the woods, vnder diuers coulours, in the likenesse and similitude of me~ of warre, which met one with another, and séemed to fight cruell battayles, which although they that were a farre off might sée, yet they that were néere hande could not sée nor finde, whiche thing deceyued· many that coueted to approch come néere.
Henry Percy· the yonger, did sodeinly shew himselfe to be the Kings enimie, vnto whome ioyned Thomas Percy Earle of Worcester, Unkle to the sayde Henry: and to make their conspiracie excusable, they did write vnto the Shires about, that they pretended nothing against the alleageance nor fidelitie which they ought to the King, neyther to gather to any other ende an armie, but only for the sauing of their persons, and for the better gouernement of the common wealth, bycause the payments and taskes graunted to the King for the safe custodie of the Realme, were put to such as they ought not to be, and were vnprofitably consumed and wasted.
Moreouer they complayned, that bycause of the euill slanders which their enimies had made of them, they durst not personally appeare in the Kings presence, vntill the Prelates Barons had intreated for them, that they might be permitted to purge themselues before the King, and bée lawfully iudged by their péeres, so that many that saw these letters, did praise their diligence, extoll their fidelitie towards the common wealth.
But the King being disquieted with these doings, that he might appease the communaltie, he wrote to them, that he maruelled much, that séeing the Earle of Northumberland, Henry his son had receiued the most part of the payme~ts summes granted to him by the Cleargy co~munaltie, for y^ defence of the Marches of Scotland, what occasion they had to make such manifest slanders &c. but the yong Henry Percy puting his co~fidence in the ayd of Owen Glendouerdew, and Edmond Mortimer Earle of March, with the Welchmen, and men of Cheshire, published that King Richard was aliue, and was with them, whom if any ma~ would sée, they should without delay come in armour to y^
Castell of Leycester which declaration made diuers variable motio~s in the hearts of many, caused the~ to wauer.
King Henry considering all things wisely, gathered togither as many as he could, and came sodeinly into the parties where the Rebels kept their rage, and when Henry saw vpon a sodein the Kings banner, and was euen ready to haue scaled y^ towne of Shrewsburie he streightways desisted fro~ the assault of the towne, and said to his men, we must now néedés turne our weapons vpon them that come against vs: ye sée the Kings Sta~dert: neither ca~ we, though we would, séeke any startinghole, stand to it manfully therfore, for this day shall eyther bring vs all to promotion and honor, if we ouercome, or else if we be ouercome, it shall deliuer vs fro~ the Kings malice: for it is a more comely thing to die in battell for the co~mon wealth, than after battell to die by the sentence of condemnation by the enimie: with that,
of the best me~ that wer with Henry, made vow promise to stand by him so long as breath would serue, they tooke the field that was commodious for them, and the King his men lay in the field right against the~.
The bowmen of Henry Percy began the battell, whose arrowes fell not vpon the ground, but vpo~ the bodies of the Kings souldiers, and the Kings archers shot as fiercely against their enimies, so that on both sides many were slaine, and many thousands fledde, thinking the King had bin slaine: but the Earle of Dunbar withdrew the King from the place that he stoode in, which was a good turne for him, for the foresayde Henry Percy, Earle Dowglas the Scot (than whome was neuer man more stoute) raged so, that the Kings Standert was ouerthrowne, and those about it slaine, among whome was slaine Humfrey Earle of Stafford, Sir Walter Blunt the Kings Standertbearer, Sir Nicholas Langford, Sir Iohn Clifton, and the two bréethren Genetels, with many other Knightes Gentlemen, and of the co~mons on both sides about
Henry the Prince was wou~ded in y^ face with an arrow.
In the meane season Hen. Percy, whilest he went before his me~ in the battel, preasing vpo~ his enimies, was sodeinly slaine, which being knowne, the Kings enimies fled, but the Earle Dowglas was take~, and also Tho. Percy Earle of Worcester, with Sir Richard Vernon, and the Baron of Kinderton, and many other were taken.
This battell was fought on Mary Magdalen eue~, néere vnto Shrewsburie, in a place called Old field, alias Bull field.
On the Monday following, were co~de~ned beheaded at Shrewsburie y^
Earle of Worcester, the Baro~ of Kindarton, and Sir Ri. Vernon.
The body of Hen. Percy was deliuered to the L. of Furniuale to be buried, but the King caused the same body to be taken by, and to be reposed betwéene two Milstones in the Towne of Shrewsburie, there to be kept with armed men, and afterward to be headed and quartered, commanding his head and quarters to be caried vnto diuers Cities of the Kingdome.
The Earle of Northumberland with a strong power was comming towards his (as men thought) or at the least towards the King, but the Earle of Westmerland, and Robert Waterton had gathered a great armie, and had entred to méete him sodeinly, but he taking none of them both to be his friends, returned vnto the Castell of Werworth.
When all things were set in a stay at Shrewsburie, the King went towards Yorke, where, when he was setled, hée sent to the Earle of Northumberland, commanding him to dismisse his company, and to come to him, and the Earle at the Kings commandement came to him on the morrow after Saint Lawrence daye, but the King receyued him not friendly, but as one that sued for pardon, and pardoning him of his life, committed him to safe custodie.
The Britons Amorikes, the Lord of Cassels being their leader, inuaded the Towne of Plimmouth, spoyled and brent it, and went their way frée, but immediately the Westerne Nauie, vnder the conduct of William Wilford Esquire, in the coast of Briton, tooke fortie Shippes laden with Iron, Oyle, Sope, and Wine of Rochell, to the number of a thousand Tonne, and in returning backe agayne, he brent forty Shippes, and at Penarch the sayd William arriued with his men, and burned Townes and Lordships the space of sixe leagues, and set the Towne of Saint Mathew on fire, and their Milles about the said Towne.
little before Christmas, the Frenchmen came into the Isle of Wight, boasting that they would kéepe their Christmas there, and when a thousand of the Frenchmen were entred into the Iland, and driuing flockes of Cattell towarde the Sea, sodeinly there came vpon them a company of the Iland men, that forced them to leaue their pray behinde them, and to get them gone (with shame ynough) to theyr Shippes, with no small losse of their men.
In a Parliament holden at London after the Octaues of the Epiphany, the Earle of Northumberland was restored to his former estate and dignitie.
And in this Parliamente was graunted vnto the King an vnaccustomed taske, very heauie and paynefull for the inhabitants, the manner of which taske the grannters thereof would haue to be kept secret for euermore: and vnder that condition only it was graunted, that it should not be any example to them that should come after, and that there should remayne no record thereof, but the same forthwith to be brent.
The Frenchmen about that time came before the Ile of Wight with a great· Nauie, and sente certayne of their men to demaund in the name of King Richard, and of Quéene Isabell, a tribute or subsedie of the inhabitants: who answered, that King Richard was dead, and the Quéene, sometime his wife, was sent home to hir parents, withoute condition of any tribute: but if the Frenchmens minde were to fight, they willed them to come vp, and no man should let them for the space of sixe houres to refresh themselues, but when that time were exspired, they should haue battayle giuen to them, which when the Frenchmen heard, they went away, and did nothing.
The Lord of Cassels in Briteine, arriued at Blacke poole, two mile out of Dertmouth with a great Nauie, where of the rusticall people, whome he euer despised, he was slayne.
There were take~ that day thrée Lords, twenty Knightes of name, and the vplandish people presenting their captiues to the King, returned with their pursses full of gold.
In the moneth of Aprill, the Cleargie granted vnto the king a tenth.
All the sommer following, Owen Glendouerdewe and his Welchmen, robbe, burne, and destroy the Countreys adioyning vnto them: he tooke many captiues, and slew many Englishmen: he layde flatte certayne Castels that he had taken, and some he kept for hys owne defence.
The Flemings and Briteines tooke certayne Shippes of oures laden with Merchandizes, and slew or hanged all the marriners.
The olde Countesse of Oxforde, (mother to Robert de Vere Duke of Ireland, who as we sayde before died at Louaine did cause suche as were familiar with hir, to brute throughout all the parts of Estsex, that King Richard was aliue, and that he should shortly come and chalenge his old estate and dignitie.
She caused many Harts of Siluer, and some of Gold, to be made for badges, such as King Richarde was wont to bestow on his Knightes, Esquires, friends, that distributing them in the Kings name, she might the sooner allure the Knightes, and other valiant men of the Countrey, to be at hir will and desire.
Also, the fame and brute whiche dayly was blazed abroade by one William Serle, sometimes of King Richards Chamber, that the same King Richard was in Scotland, and tarried with a power of French and Scottishmen, caused many to beléeue that he was aliue.
This William Serle had forged a priuie· Seale in the said King Richards name, and had sent diuers comfortable letters vnto such as were familiar with King Richarde, by which meanes, many gaue the greater credite to the Countesse, in so much, that some religious· Abbots of that Countrey did giue credite vnto hir tales, who afterward were taken af the Kings commandement, and emprisoned, bycause they did beléeue and giue credit to the Countesse in this behalfe, and the Countesse had all hir goodes confiscate, was co~mitted to close prison: and William Serle was drawne fro~ Pomfret, through the chiefest Cities of England, put to death at London.
About the feast of S. Iohn Baptist, at the Kings commandement, the Earle of Northumberla~d came to Pomfret, brought with him his Nephues, nephues sonnes, by which doing he mitigated the mindes of many, whiche thought that he had giuen the yong men counsell to rebell.
There came also with him William Clifford Knight, who brought with him that William Serle K. Richards chamberlain, whom we spake of before, who by a wile he had caught and apprehended, by which doing, the King held him excused, and pardoned him, for that he had kept the Castell of Berwike against the Kings will and pleasure.
About the feast of Saint Faith, the King called a Parliament at Couentry, and sent processe to the Sheriffes that they should choose no Knights nor burgesses that had any knowledge in the lawes of the Realme, by reason wherof, it was called the Lay mans Parliame~t.
These piked out Knights and Burgesses, could deuise none other way to reléeue the Kings lacke of money, but to depriue the Cleargie of their temporall lands and goodes: but Thomas Arundell Archbishop of Canterbury made answere, that the Cleargie did alwayes giue the King as much as the Lay people did, considering that they did ofer giue the King tenthes, than the laytie gaue fiftéenes: and moreouer, that more of their Tenants did serue the King in his warres, tha~ of the Tenants of the lay fée: and besides this, they prayed for the prosperitie of the King, and of all them that faithfully serued him.
And whe~ the speker of ye Parliame~t said with a loud voice, that he little regarded ye prayers of the Church, the Archbishop of Ca~terbury answered: then (quoth he) know to what end the fortune of the Realme will come, whe~ the suffrages of ye Church are not set by, wherwith ye Godhead is wont to be appeased: surely that Kingdome neuer co~tinueth stable y^ is voyde of prayer deuotion: notwithstanding, thinke not that thou shalt without punishme~t take away the possessio~s of the Church, for if the Archbishop of Canterburie liue, thou shalte haue euill taking of any thing that is his.
Then the Archbishoppe rose vppe, and knéeled downe before the Kyng, desiring hym to consider howe gratiouslie, and by Gods fauour he had atteyned to the Kingdome· that he would co~sider his first promis, which was, that he would preserue vnto euery man their right and title so farre as lay in him.
He also willed him to remember the oth which he voluntarily made, which was, that he would honor and defend the Church, and Ministers thereof, wherefore he desired him to permit and suffer the Church to enioy the priuiledges and liberties which in time of his predecessors it did enioy, and to feare that King, by whome all Kings doe raigne.
When the Archbishop had said these and like words, the King commanded him to go to his seate againe, and sayde, that his intent and purpose was to leaue the Church in as good state or better than he found it.
And then the Archbishop speaking to the Knightes and burgesses, sayde: you, and such like as you be, haue giuen such counsell vnto our King, and to his predecessors· to confiscate the goodes of the Celles whiche the Frenchmen and Normans did possesse in England, and sayd, that by them he should heape vp great riches, as in déede they were woorth many thousands of gold: notwithstanding it is most true that the King at this day is not the richer thereby of halfe a Marke, for you haue extorted, or at the least begged them out of his handes, and haue appropriated the saide goodes vnto your selues, so that it may be coniectured that your request to haue our temporalities, is not for the Kings profite, but for your owne couetousnesse: for without doubt, if the King (as God forbid he should) fulfill your wicked purpose, he should not be one farthing the richer the next yeare following: and surely, will sooner let my head be cut off, than that the Churche should be destitute of the least right that perteyneth to it &c.
The Cleargie granted a tenth and a halfe, and the commons two fiftéenes, on condition the Lord Furniuall should receyne it to spend in the Kings warres.
The same time such abundance of water brake sodeinly ouer the bankes in Kent, as was neuer séene the like in those partes, whereby were drowned Beastes and Cattell without number: neyther did England only bewayle theyr losses, but also Zeland, Flanders, and Holland, susteyned the like, by the great excesse of waters.
This yeare died William Wikeham Bishop of Winchester, by whose charges and trauell, the Cleargie of England was much encreased, for he builded a notable Colledge in Oxford, for the encrease of learning, where he placed the Warden and his company, to the number of lxx. besides children, seruants, and tenne Priestes, to kéepe dayly seruice, enduing the sayd company with sufficient lands.
He beganne the foundation of a new Colledge at Winchester, and in sixe yeares finished the same, where he placed the like number of Schollers to learne their Gra~mer, and other principles, to be sent afterward to his other Colledge at Oxford.
These two Colledges are called the new Colledges, dedicated to our blessed Lady.
He builded the great body of the Church of Saint Swithens in Winchester, where the Sermons are made, where his body is enterred, a very princely worke: neyther did he for all this diminish any thing of his ordinarie housholde charges, and fedde (as the writing engraued on his Sepulchre sheweth) both rich and poore.
He dyed rich, for beside that he gaue to his kinsefolke and to the poore, he gaue somewhat to euery Church in his Dioces.
He gaue many things to the King, and to his owne seruants, and to his Colledges: neyther do doubt but yt he that thus liued, is now with God, whome beséech to reyse vp many like Bishops in England.
Iohn Leyland writeth (by the reporte of Doctor London that this William Wikeham was borne at Wickham in Hampshire, and was sonne to one William Perot, parishe clarke there, of which place he tooke his surname: and that one Mayster Wodale of Wickham brought him vp at schole, where he learned his Grammer, and to write faire.
After this, the Connestable of Winchester Castell, at that time a great ruler in Hampshire, gote Perot, alias Wickham of and made him his Clearke.
Edward the third comming to Winchester Castell, liked Wickham, and tooke him to seruice, and vnderstanding that he had mind to be a Priest, made him first Parson of Saint Martins in London, and then Deane of Saint Martins le Graund, and then Archdeacon of Buckingham.
He made him also surueyor of his buildings, as of Windsore, Quinborow in Kent, and other buildings.
After this, he preferred him to be bearer of the priuie Sealt, mayster of the Wardes and Forrests, and Treafourer of the Kings reuenues in France, then Bishop of Winchester, Chancellour and Treasourer of England, as it very manifestly (sayth Iohn Leyland appeareth by writing.
The blacke Prince scant fauoured Wickham, wherefore Wickham procured to kéepe the Prince in battell out of the Realme, but at length Iohn of Gaunt Duke of Lancaster, and Alice Peeres, Concubine to Edward the third, caused him to be banished the Realme, and then he dwelled in Normandy and Picardie seauen yeares, Edward the thirde yet liuing, but he was restored about the second yeare of Richard the second, of whome he had a generall pardon.
Aboute the feast of Saint Valentine, the sonnes of the Earle of March were taken out of the Castell of Windsore, and ledde away into Wales to Owen Glendouerdewe, but shortly after were recouered againe.
The Smith that made the keyes, by the which they that conuayde them got into them, had first his hands, and then his head cut off.
The Lady Spencer, Sister to the Duke of Yorke, and widow of Thomas Lord Spencer, before executed at Brestow, being apprehended, and committed to prison, accused hit brother the Duke of Yorke to be chiefe author, in stealing away of the Earle of Marches sonnes, wherefore the sayde Duke was kept by Sir Iohn Pelham in the Castell of Pemsey till the next Parliament.
After the feast of the Purification of our Lady, the King assembled his Barons at London, to treate of the gouernement of the Realme, and to haue ayde of money to be giuen him, but the Nobles would not at that time obey his request.
In the Lent following therefore, the King caused the Cleargie and the Barons to assemble at Saint Albons for the matter aforesayd, but by reason the Nobles stroue against him, there was nothing done, and so departed on Palme sonday.
About the fiftéenth of March, in a fight betwixt the Englishmen and Welchmen, the sonne of Owen Glendouerdewe was taken, and fiftéene hundred with him were taken or slayne.
Henry Percy Earle of Northumberlande, Richard Scrope Archbishop of Yorke, Thomas Mowbray Earle Marshall, Thomas Lord Bardolph, and other, co~spiring against King Henry, assembled togither the Citizens of Yorke, and many other, to stand with them for the commoditie of the Realm.
And to animate the commons to be the readier vnto this businesse, they set articles vpo~ the dores of the Monasteries Churches of the same Citie, written in English agaynste the King, bycause he had put downe King Richard, offering themselues for those articles to liue and die, which caused great number of people to resort to them: but Ralph Neuill Earle of Westmerland that was not farre off, togither with Iohn Duke of Lancaster the Kings sonne, being enformed of these things, gathered an armie with spéede to goe against the Archbishops company, but all was in vayne, for the Archbishops power was farre greater than theirs, wherevpon, the Earle of Westmerland sente messengers, to enquire of the Archbishop the cause of so great an assembly in armour, contrarie to the Kings peace, wherevnto the Archbishop answered, that he tooke nothing in hand against the Kings peace, and he was in armour and munited with men, only for feare of the King, whome he could not safely come vnto to speake, but his purpose (he said) was good and co~modious both for ye King Realme, if happily they would know it: the~ he shewed a scedule, in which ye articles were conteyned, which when the Earle of Westmerland had read, he with word and countenance praysed the Bishops holy and vertuous intent, and promised, that he and his would prosecute the same with the Archbishop.
The Archbishop being glad of this, beléeued the Earles words, perswaded the Earle Marshall, being vnwilling therevnto, to go with him to a place appointed to talke togither, to whome they with like number came, and the writing with the Articles was read ouer: streightway the Earle and they that were with him gaue their assent to these articles, then sayde the Earle being subtiller than the rest, behold the labour that we haue take~ in hand is come to such end as we would haue it, and the people hath now bin long in armour, let some of your me~ beare word vnto the people to go their way home, and to lay downe their armour, and euery ma~ to fall to his occupation, and accustomed labour: in the meane season we, in token of concord will drinke togither, that the people on both sides shall sée it, and without delay, after they had take~ each other by the hands, a Knight was sent on the Archbishops behalfe, to beare word to ye people that it was peace, and to command euery man to lay downe their armour, and to go to their owne home.
The people beholding signes of peace, the Lords drinking togither, being awéeried with the vnaccustomed trauell of war, turned the reines of their bridles homewards, and so it came to passe y^ whe~ the people of ye Archbishops side went away, ye nu~ber of the aduersaries increased as before it was appointed, the Archbishop did not perceiue yt he was betrayd, vntill such time as ye Earle arrested him: he arrested the Marshall also, and many other with him, to all which it was promised yt they should haue no harme, but that promise was not kept, for both the Archbishop the Earle Marshall were beheaded when the King came to Yorke the morrow after Whitsonday.
After this, whe~ the King had punished the me~ of Yorke at his pleasure, he set forth with an armie to pursue the Earle of Northumberland, and Thomas Lord Bardolph, and tooke all maner of munition with him, and an armie of
The Earle of Northumberland perceyuing the Kings intent, gote himselfe to Berwike with thrée hundred horsse, and fro~ thence into Scotland.
The King being bent against the Earle of Northumberland, went to Berwike, from whence the Earle fledde into Scotland, and the Lord Bardolph with him, whome Dauid Lord Fleming the Scotte receyued into alliance.
The King vndersta~ding that the Earle was fled, he commanded them in the Castell to render it vnto him, whiche when they refused to do, the King caused a greate Gunne to be shotte, whiche ouerthrewe parte of a Tower, wherevpon they of the Castell gaue ouer, and submitted themselues to the King, who caused some of them to be beheaded, and the residue to be sent to prisons.
After this, the Castell of Alnewike, and the rest of the Earles Castels, were with small ado rendred to his handes, with which successe, the King being encouraged, went streight into Wales, where contrarywise nothing prospered with him, wherefore he returned, loosing Charets, Cartes, and Wagons to the number of
with his Treasure, so that comming backe to Worcester, he sent for the Archbishop and Bishops, and declared to them his misfortune, desiring the~ to help him: to whome the Archbishop answered, that he woulde talke with the Cleargie in that matter.
In the meane season the Frenchmen came to succour the Welchmen with
Shippes: they in Milford Hauen, hauing lost almost all their horsses for lacke of fresh water.
The Lord Barkley, and Henry Pay burnt fiftéene of those Shippes in the same Hauen.
These Frenchmen beséeged the Towne of Carmarden, and tooke it, graunting to the inhabitants all their moueable goodes, and to goe whether they would.
The same time the foresayde Lorde Barkley, Thomas Swinborne, and Henry Pay, tooke fourtéene Shippes of the French, in the whiche they tooke the Steward of France, and right Captaynes more.
This yeare, all the Weares in Thamis from the Towne of Stanes in the Weast, vnto the water of Medway in the East, by the Maior and communaltie of London, were destroyd, and the trunckes brent, for the which, great plea and discord followed betwéene Thomas Arundell Archbishop of Canterbury, and other Lords and Knightes of the one party, and the Maior and communaltie on the other partie, but the Citizens preuayled by vertue of their Charter and Statutes.
Parliamente beganne, whiche lasted nigh one whole yeare, for after the Knightes of the Parliament had long delayde to graunt to the King a subsedie, yet in the ende being ouercome, they granted the taske demanded.
The Priestes and the Friers that liued of almes, were forced euery one to pay halfe a marke.
Henry Percy Earle of Northumberland, the L. Bardolfe, by the counsell of Dauid Fleming, fled into Wales, for he had declared to them, that the Scottes had conspired to deliuer them vnto their owne King, in exchange for other prisoners, and for this doing of Dauid Fleming, the trayterous Scottes flew him, and reysed such a ciuill warre amongst the~selues, that in the ende they were constreyned to request truce for a yeare, which when they had obteyned, the Scottes sente Iames, the sonne of Robert King of Scottes, being but nine yeares olde, towardes France, there to be brought vp, and to be instructed in the pleasant eloquence of the French tongue, whome certayne marriners of Cley in Norffolke tooke on the Seas, and with him a Bishop, and the Earle of Orkney, to whome his Father had committed him: and they brought him into England, and deliuered him to the King, who forth with burst out into a laughter, and sayde, surely the Scottes mighte haue sente him to me, for can speake French.
The Bishop escaped and fledde, but the Earle of Orkeney, and the sayde Iames the yong ladde, was sent to the Tower of London, where he remayned prisoner till the second yeare of Henry the sixth, whiche was aboue eightéene yeares.
were taken, full of armed men, the rest escaped into Wales, but not long after were taken fiftene Shippes laden with Wine and Waxe.
Whilest the Parliament yet continued, the Duke of Yorke was restored to his olde dignitie, whome many men thought to haue bin dead in prison.
Edmond Holland Earle of Kent, married the Duke of Millaynes daughter in the Priory of Saint Mary Ouery in Southwarke.
Iohn Couentry, and Iankin Carpenter, executors to this Richard Whittington, with his goodes builded Whittington Colledge in London, and a great part of the Hospitall of Saint Barthelmew in Smithfielde.

After Christmasse he called the Nobles of ye realm togither to a Parliament at London, but he liued not to the end therof, for now after the great and fortunate chaunces hapned to him, and being deliuered of all Ciuill diuision, hée was taken with sicknesse, of the which he languished til his appointed houre, during which sickenesse, some euil disposed people laboured to make dissention betwéene the King and the Prince his sonne, by reason wherof, and by the acte of youth, which he exercised more than meanely, and for the great recourse of people vnto him, of whom his Court was at all times more aboundant than the King his father, the King suspected that he would presume to vsurpe the crown, he being aliue: which suspitious iealousie was occasion that he in part withdrewe his affection and singular loue from the Prince.
But when this noble Prince was aduertised of his fathers iealousie, he disguised himself in a gown of blew made full of small Oylet holes, and at euery Oylet the néeble wherwith it was made hanging stil by a thréede of silke.
And about his arme he ware a dogges coller set ful of of golde, and the Tirets of the same also of fine gold.
Thus apparelled, with a great companye of Lordes and other noble men of his Court, he came to the king his father, who at that time laye at Westminster, where at his co~ming (by his owne commaundement) not one of hipanye auaunced himselfe further tha~ the fire in the Hall, notwithstanding that they were greatly and ofte desired to the contrarie, by the Lordes and great estates of the Kings Court: and that the Prince had commanded, to giue the lesse occasion of mistrust to the King his father, but he himselfe only accompanyed of the kings house, passed forth to the king his Father, to whom after due salutation) he desired to shewe the intent of his minde in secrete manner.
Then the Kyng caused himselfe to be borne in his chayre into his secrete chamber (bycause he was deseased and might not goe) wher in the presence of thrée or foure persons, in whom the King had most confidence, he commaunded the Prince to shewe the effect of his minde: Then the Prince knéeling down before his Father, saide to him these wordes, most redoubted Lord and Father, am this time come to your presence, as your liegman, and as your sonne naturall, in all thyngs to obay your grace as my soueraigne Lord and father.
And whereas vnderstand yée haue me suspect of my behauiour against your grace, and that yée feare would vsurpe your Crowne againste the pleasure of your highnesse, of my co~uersation youre grace knoweth that if yée were in feare of any man, of what estate soeuer he were, my duetie were to the endaungering of my life to punishe that person, therby to race that sore from your hearte.
And then howe muche rather oughte to suffer death to bring your grace from the feare that yée haue of me that am your naturall sonne, and your liegeman.
And to that intente haue thys daye by confession and receyuing the Sacramente, prepared my selfe, and therefore moste redoubted Lorde and Father, beséeche you in the honour of God, for the easing of youre harte, heretofore your knées to slea me with this dagger, and at that worde wyth all reuerence he deliuered to the king hys dagger, saying my Lorde and Father my lyfe is not so desirous to mée, that woulde liue one daye that shoulde be to you displeasure· nor couet not so much my life as doe your pleasure and welfare, and in your thus doing, here in the presence of these Lordes, and tofore God at the daye of iudgemente clearelye forgiue you my deathe.
At these wordes of the Prince, the King taken with compassion of hearte, cast from him the dagger, and imbracing the Prince kissed him, and with effusion of teares saide vnto him, my right deare and hartily beloued sonne, it is of trueth that had you partly suspecte, and as now perceyue, vndeserued on your partie: but séeing this your humilitie and faithfulnesse, shall neyther slay you, nor from henceforth haue you any more in mistrust, for no report that shall be made vnto me, and thereof assure you vpon mine honor.

And for dreade hereof, as ofte as it is in my remembraunce, soare repente me, that euer charged my selfe wyth the Crowne of this Realme.
To these wordes of the King the Prince aunsweared thus: Righte redoubted Lorde and Father to the pleasure of GOD your grace shall long continue with vs, and rule vs both: but if God haue so prouided that euer shall succéede you in thys Realme, shall honour and loue my brethre· aboue all menne, as long as they be to me true, faythfull and obediente, as to theyr soueraigne Lord, but if anye of them fortune to conspyre or rebell againste mée, assure you shall as soone execute iustice vppon one of them, as shall vpon the worst and most simplest person within this your Realme.
The Kyng hearing thys aunsweare, was therewith maruellouslye reioyced in hys mynde, and sayde: My deare and wel beloued Sonne, wyth thys aunswere thou haste deliuered me of a greate and ponderous agonye: and beséeche thée, and vppon my blessing charge thée, that like as thou haste sayde, so thou minister iustice equally, and in no wise suffer not them that be oppressed long to call vpon thée for Justice, but redresse oppressions, and indifferently, and wythout delay, for no perswasion of flatterers, or of them that bée partiall, or suche as vse to haue their handes replenished wyth gyftes, deferre not Justice vntill to morrowe, if that thou mayste doe iustice thys daye, leaste (peraduenture) GOD doe Justice on thée in the meane tyme, and take from thée thyne authoritye: remember, that the wealth of thy body and thy soule, and of thy Realme, resteth in the execution of Justice, and doe not thy Justice, so that thou be called a Tyraunte, but vse thy selfe meanely betwixte Justice and mercie in those things that belong to thée.
And betwéen parties do iustice truely and extreamely to the co~solation of thy poore subiects that suffer iniuries, and to the punition of them that be extortioners and doers of oppressio~s, that other therby may take example: in thus doing, thou shalt obtayne the fauour of God, and the loue and fear of thy subiectes, and therefore also thou shalte haue thy Realme more in tranquillitye and reste, whiche shal bée occasion of greate prosperitie wythin thy Realme, whyche Englishmen naturally do desyre: for so long as they haue wealthe and Ryches, so long shalte thou haue obeysaunce: and when they bée poore, then they bée alwayes readye at euerye motion to make insurrections, and it causeth them to rebel agaynst theyr soueraygne LORDE: for the nature of them is suche, rather to feare losing of theyr goods and worldly substaunce, than the ieoparding of theyr liues.
And if thou thus kéepe them in subiection mixed with loue and feare, thou shalte haue the moste peaceable and fertyle Countrey, and the moste louyng, faythfull, and manlye people of the Worlde: whyche shall because of no small feare to thyne aduersaries.
My sonne when it shall please God to call me to the waye decrede for euerye Worldely creature, to thée (as my sonne and heyre) muste leaue my Crowne and my Realme, whyche aduise thée not to take vaynelye· and as a manne elate in pryde, and reioyced in Worldlye honour, but thinke that thou arte more oppressed wyth charge, to puruie for euerie Person wythin the Realme, than exalted in vaine honoure of the Worlde.
Thou shalt be exalted to the Crowne, for the wealthe and conseruation of the Realme, and not for thy singular commoditie and auaile: my Sonne thou shalte be a minister to thy Realme to kéepe it in tranquilitie and defende it.
Like as the harte in the myddest of the bodye is principall and chiefe thyng in the bodye, and seruesh to couet and desire that thyng that is moste necessarie to euerye of thy members, so (my Sonne) thou shalte be amongst thy people as chiefe and principall of them to minister, imagine and acquire those thyngs that maye be moste beneficiall for them.
And then thy people shall be obediente to thée, to ayde and succoure thée, and in al things to accomplishe thy commaundeme~ts, like as thy members laboure, euerye one of them in theyr office to acquire and get that thing that the hearte desireth, and as thy hearte is of no force and impotent without the ayde of thy members so without thy people, thy raygne is nothing.
My sonne thou shalt feare and dread God aboue all things, and thou shalt loue honour and worship him wt all thy hearte, thou shalte attribute and ascribe to hym all things wherein thou séest thy selfe to be well Fortunate, it victorye of thyne enymies, loue of thy friendes, obedience of thy subiectes, strength and actiuenesse of body, honor, riches, or fruitefull generations, or any other thing whatsoeuer it be, that chanceth to thy pleasure.
Thou shalt not imagine that any such thing shoulde fortune to thée, by thyne acte, nor by thy desert, but thou shalte thinke that all co~meth only of the goodnesse of our Lord.
Thus yu shalt with all thine heart, prayse, honour, and thanke God of all hys benefits that he giueth vnto thée.
And in thy selfe eschew al vaineglorie and elation of heart, following the holesome counsell of the Psalmist, (which sayeth) Non nobis Domine non nobis, sed nominituo dagloria~ (which is to say) Not vnto vs Lord, not vnto vs, but to thy holy name be giuen laude and praise.

The Earle was buried head and all, the other hea were the one to Yorke, the other to Newcastell vpon Tine, and there vp.
On the eleuenth of August, the King tooke shipping, and entred the Sea with a thousand Sayle, Enguerant sayth
Sayles, and the third night after arriued at in Normandy, whiche is betwixte Hereflete and of whose comming, all the Cities, and States of th partes being aduertised, were striken with great feare.

He had at his landing in his host· sixe thousande Speares, and xxiiij. thousand footemen, besides Gunners, and other enginars, artificers, and labourers, of whome the King had great abundance.
The King gaue to diuers Gentlemen the order of Knighthoode, and assigned the bearing of his Standarts and Banners to such me~ as he knew to be of great strength and prowesse.
All thing being set in good order and array, the King with all his host ascended to the toppe of an high hill there nigh, and there he rested the next day.
On the sixtéenth day of August, the Duke of Clarence, leader of the foreward, in good ordinance, entred his iourney towarde a Towne called Herefleete, distant from Kede+camp scarcely thrée leagues, where he lodged his host in a field before the towne.
The King at his comming, lodged himselfe nigh to the first warde, not farre from the Towne.
The Earle of Suffolke, Michaell at Poole, Chiefetayne of the rereward, lodged on the other side before the Towne.
Other noble men that had the conduct of the two wings, lodged them, one on the right ha~d, the other on the left.
Forthwith were sent to the Towne, men of armes in great number, to sée the scituation thereof, who shortly returned with a great pray of Cattell, and enformed the King of all his demaundes.
Hereflete is the key of the sée of all Normandy, and is scituate vpon the Sea side, by the Riuer of Seene, betwixte two hilles, and through the middle thereof runneth a Riuer, whiche not farre from the same Towne entreth into the Seane, and from thence, both those Riuers in one descende into the Sea, where as a great and goodly Hauen is, belonging to the same Towne, which Hauen, is garnished with the defence of two faire and strong Towers: and in the same Hauen a right great Nauie of Shippes may ride in safetie: and if the inhabitants of this Towne enclose and képe within the Towne the course of the foresayd Riuer by their sluces, as they may right well do, then the Riuer riseth without the Towne so high, that it forecloseth all entries to the walles, so that no man may approch the towne on that part.
This Towne is also defended with high and thicke walles and towers, and is also enuironed with broade and déepe ditches.
To this Towne also belongeth only two Gates for entries, the one called Calturances, the other Mostrouillier.
In this Towne, besides the inhabitants thereof, for the defence of the same, were foure hundred men of armes deputed in Garrison, amongst whome, were these Lords, Lord Discouteuile, chiefe Captayne of the Towne, Lord Blanuile, Lord Haqueuile, Lord Harmanuile, Lord Eancourt, Lord Gaillard Bos, and diuers other Lords and men expert in warre.
The King commanding the Duke of Clarence to asséege the Towne, he endeuoured to conuey his people ouer the Riuer, in the passage whereof, he had a great skirmish with the inhabitants of the Towne, but at the last his aduersaries being put to flight, recoyled within the walles.
The Duke conuayde ouer the Riuer all his ward and company, and bycause the Riuer deuided the Kings Camp from the Dukes, they ordeyned a ready and sure passage ouer the same Riuer betwixt both the Campes, to the kéeping whereof, certayne Gentlemen were appoynted, so that theyr enimies myghte not endomage them neyther by Water nor Lande.
In this meane time befell a great misaduenture to the Frenchmen that were beséeged, for the Gonnepouder and shotte that was sent vnto them by the French King, was encountred vpon the Sea by the Englishmen, and taken, to their great displeasure and domage.
The King gaue the charge of the fielde to his brother Humfrey Duke of Glocester.
On the same side the Riuer that the King lay, was ye Duke of Yorke, high Connestable of England lodged with his band.
When euery man was placed, ye Towne was so streightly asséeged, that all entries and issues of the Towne were stopped, so y^ they of ye towne were in dispaire to haue any succour from the Realme of France.
Many engins were reysed by the English, which in short time should haue bin the destruction of the walles, if they of the Towne had not the sooner stopped the Riuer of the same towne within, wherby the water gathered reised without the towne betwixt the King and the D. of Clarence, to the semblance of a little Sea, which caused the Englishmen to withdraw their Gonnes, and other engins, whereby at that time the walles were saued.
Then the King caused to be made vnder the water thrée great Mines vnto the walles of the towne, which in like maner had bin the cause of their ruine, if the inhabitants had not countermined them, and letted their purpose.
The inhabitants of the Town perceyuing themselues thus streightly asséeged, as well by Land as by Sea, conuayde all their Shippes within their Haue~, and bound them togither with cheynes, and in the two towers that were made for the defence of the Hauen, they put certaine Garrisons, and armed men, who oftentimes attempted to inuade the Kings Nauie, but at all times they were by his Shippes beaten, and constreyned to recule still within their Hauen: at the last, the Captaynes and inhabitants considering that by such skirmishes (as well vpon the Land as vpon the Sea) they gained nothing, tooke this appointment with the King, that if they were not rescued by the Frenchmen within certayne dayes limited, they shoulde then delyuer into hys handes the Towne, with thirtie persons of the greatest and most noble within the Towne, suche as the King woulde desire, to bée ordered at the Kings pleasure, and all the residue, as well menne of Warre, as the inhabitantes of the same Towne, without armoure, and leauing behynde them theyr goodes, shoulde fréely goe where they woulde, for the suretie of whyche appoyntemente to bée kepte, they deliuered vnto the King twelue of their greatest personages for pledges.
The Captaynes and inhabitants of the Towne séeing their day of appoyntment to approch, and themselues vtterly desperate of any succours of their people, ordeyned to perfourme their couenant at their day prefixed, whiche was the xxij. of September, on which day came Sir Lionell Braquemont, gouernour of the Towne, vnto the King, and knéeling before him, sayd: Most victorious Prince, beholde héere the keyes of this Towne, which after our promis yéeld vnto you, with the Towne, my selfe, and my companie.
Then were brought to the King the Lord Coteuile, the Lord Gangcourt, and other, to the number of thirtie, and all the residue, as well souldioures, as inhabitants, were suffered vnarmed to depart.
The King constitute Captayne of the Towne Sir Thomas Beawford Earle of Dorset hys Unkle, to whome he also committed two thousand souldiers, chosen men of his host.
Then considering that winter drew on, as also the losse of their men, by reason of the Flix then reigning amongst them, by which infirmitie, died Michaell at Poole, Earle of Suffolke, the Bishop of Norwich, the Lord Beawmont, and others, and of the commons to the number of two thousand and aboue.
King Henry created the sonne of Michaell at Poole, Earle of Suffolke, who liued not long after.
After King Henry had remayned at Harefleete fiftéene dayes, after ye deliuerie of the Towne, and of the Towers, he departed from thence towards Caleis, whereof, when his enimies were aduertised, and also by what way he intended to passe, all the people of the Countrey, Cities, and Townes, were maruellouslie oppressed with feare, wherefore they hasted them to defensible places, and other that were apt to warre, tooke them to their horsses, and assembled them togither in great number, with no small companie of footemen, and in all that they might they oppressed the Englishmen.
The Kings host kept an easie pace, without making any hast, and when they approched the Towne of Ewe, their enimies assayled them in the fieldes with great force and noyse, where on both parties it was foughten sore and vigorously: but the Frenchmen reculed to the Towne, where they were in good suretie.
From thence the King departed, and came to a passage of the Riuer of Some, which the Frenchmen call Blankhestoke, or Blanch· tache.
This passage, at the comming vnto it, was fixed with sharp stakes by their enimies, so that they could not passe there, but were constreyned to go farther séeking their passage, vntill they came directly to haue the Citie of Amiens, and the Castell of Gorby on their left side, where they of the sayde Citie began with them a new fight: but they were soone forced by the English to returne to their Citie agayne.
The xix. of October the King passed the Riuer of Some, at the passage of Vienna, and and wente then to lodge him at fro~ whence, he aduanced him towardes the Riuer of Miramont.
In the meane time, the French King, and the Duke of Guyen his sonne, then Dolphin, purposing to resist the Englishmen, came to Roane, from whence, they sent thrée Heraults to the King of England, to giue vnderstanding that he should not escape without battayle: vnto whome the sayde King answered, All things be done at the pleasure of God, will kéepe the right way towardes Caleis: if our aduersaries do attempt to disturbe vs in oure iourney, we thinke they shall not do it without their owne great danger and perill.
From thence, King Henry remoued to a Uillage called Forceuile, aduancing his host towardes the Riuer of Miramont, and the next day they passed by the Cheue, and the King lodged that night at Bonyers lestaillon.
The next day late in the night the King came to a Uillage named Agencourt, Enguerant sayeth Masencelles, where they lodged not distant from the French host the space of two hundred and fiftie spaces.
The Frenchmen fixed their Banners and Standerts with the Banner Royall, whereof the Connestable had the conduct, in the field by them deuised and chosen, which was in the Countie of S. Paule, in y^ grou~d of Agencourt, by whiche the day following, the Englishmen should passe to go to Caleis.
The xxv. day of October, the King of England in the morning very earely set forth his host in array.
He commanded that his Horsses and other carriages shoulde be left in the Uillage where he had lodged.
The order of his field was thus: The middle battell whereof the King was conductor, was set in the midst of the field, directly against the middle battell of his aduersaries.
On the right side was the first battell, and therewith the right wing: and on the left side the last battell, and the left wing.
And these battayles ioyning nigh togither, by the prouidence of God, proued vnto this King a defensible place for his host, for the Uillage wherein he was lodged before, defended his host from all inuasions on the backe, and the field wherein he was, was defended on both sides with two small Riuers.
This noble King was armed with sure and right beautifull armour.
On his head a bright Helmet, wherevpon was set a Crowne of Golde, repleate with pearle and pretious stones, maruellous rich.
In his Shield he bare the armes both of England and France.
And thus armed, he was mounted vpon a goodly great Horsse, and after hym were ledde certayne noble Horsses, with their bridles and trappers of Goldsmithes worke, and vpon them also were beaten the Armes of England and of France.
Thus this victorious King prepared to battell, encouraged his people to the field that approached at hand.
The night before this cruell battell, by the aduise and counsell (as it is said) of the Duke of Yorke, the King had giuen commandeme~t through his host, that euery ma~ should puruey him a stake sharp at both ends, which the Englishmen fixed in the ground before them in the field, to defend them from the oppression of Horssemen.
The Frenchmen had such confidence in the great multitude of their people, and in their great Horsses, that many of their great Princes and Lordes leauing behinde them their Souldiers, Standerts, and other Ensignes, came towards the Englishmen in right great hast, as if they had bin assured of victory.
The battayles of the Englishmen were as large as the field wherein they fought would suffer, which was greatly to their aduantage, for by that meanes their enimies were letted to come vpon them at the sides and backes of their host.
The Frenchmen had ordeyned their battels with two sharpe fronts, like vnto two hornes, which alwayes backward was broader and broader: and these sharp battels set vpon the Englishmens middle ward, intending to haue runne thorough the whole fielde, but the Frenchmen were slayne and wounded by the English Archers, and by the helpe of the stakes which the Englishmen had fixed before them in the grounde, whereby the Horssemen were constreyned to returne, or else to runne vpon the stakes, where many of them were ouerthrowne and wounded, and many both Horsses and men slayne.
The battell and fight encreased maruellously by the space of thrée houres, in all whych time no man was taken prisoner, but innumerable were slaine, vpon whose dead bodyes they that followed were ouerthrowne and slayne.
Thus after a long and cruell battell, there approched no man to battell, but to death, of whome, after that an innumerable company were slayne, and that the victorie remayned to the Englishmen, they spared to sley and take prisoners of the Frenchmen.
In this mortall battell, the noble King of England fought with his enimies as a famished Lion for his pray, receyuing on his Helmet, and other armour, many and greate strokes: at the last, the victorie obteyned, and the greate host of the Frenchmen slayne, taken, wounded, and vanquished, forthwith another host of Frenchmen, no lesse than the firste, supposing the Englishmen now to be wéeried, prepared themselues to begin agayne a newe battayle.
The King of England séeing this second assemble of his aduersaries, sente his Heraults vnto them, commaunding them eyther forthwith to come to battayle, or else immediately to depart: and if they delayed to departe, or if they came to battell, both those of theirs which were already taken prisoners, and also all those that after should be taken, without redemption should be put to death, which message when the Frenchmen had heard, fearing the strength of the Englishmen, and also the death of themselues, of the prisoners taken, with heauinesse they departed forthwith.
Then the King of England being assured of the victory, gaue the greatest laude and prayse to God that might be.
In this battayle were slayne on the French parte, the Dukes of Alaunson, Barry, and Braban, and the Lord of Helly, the Lord Labret chiefe Connestable of France, the Archbishop of Saunce, eyght Earles, an hundred and mo Barons, fiftéene hundred Knightes, and aboue tenne thousand of all estates, whereof scarcely fiftéene hundred were Souldiers or labourers, the rest were of cote armour.
At this battayle were taken prisoners of the Frenchmen, the Dukes of Orleaunce, and of Burbon, Arthure, brother to the Duke of Briteine, the Earles of Vandisme, of Ewe, and Richmount, and Sir Boumeycault, Marshall of France, and many other, to the number of fiftéene hundred Knightes and Esquiers.
And of the English partie were slayne the Duke of Yorke, the Earle of Suffolke, and to the number of an C. persons in the vantgard, and of all estates on ye English partie, were not found dead aboue vj. C. in the field.
When night approched, the K. of England returned with his host into that Uillage wherein they harbored the night before, where he found his Horsses other baggages cariages ye he left there before the field, stolne, caried away by the Frenchmen.
On the day next ensuing, the King with his people entred his iourney towarde Caleis.

Then the King on the xxij. of June, remoued his armie towards Pount large, where he layde his séege on the one side of y^
Towne, by the middle whereof, the Riuer of Seene hath his course, but could haue no passage ouer the riuer to lay séege on ye other side, for ye bridge which was without ye town was defended with a strong Tower, and a Garrison, but King Henry commanded to make Boates of wickers, and those to be closed in Beastes Skinnes, by which Boates, on the fifth of July, the Duke of Clarence with hys companie passed ouer secretly in great number, and then beséeged the other side of the Towne: but bycause the Riuer of Seene diuided his host, whereby if eyther part should haue néede of other, they could not come togither for the Riuer, the King caused to be made so many small square Boates of the wicker aforesayd, that being tyed togither, and cast into the Riuer, he made of them a Bridge.
When the inhabitants and Garrisons perceyued them thus enuironed in all partes, they agréed with the King, that if within fiftéene dayes they were not deliuered from thys séege, they should deliuer to the King the Towne and Castell, and when the day was come, they perfourmed promise: and this was the first Bridge ouer the Riuer of Seene that the King subdued to his power.

Then the plague of famine entred the Citie, so that the people for defaulte of reliefe dyed, that the liuing might scarcely burie the deade, whereby that noble Citie was brought into so muche miserie, that it is not lesse maruayle than pitiful to heare.

The King also sent the Earle of Huntington wyth a power from Maunt, to the Towne of Pontois, by which, if it were taken, he might haue the more sure and easie passage to Paris.
Those whyche were sent, at the entry of the night were come nygh vnto Pontois, where, in a Wood they lefte their horses, and that done, in the darkenesse of the night, they went on foote to the ditches of the Towne, whych then were drye, where parte of them lay on the banks of the ditches, with their Ladders in their handes ready to scale the walles when time shoulde serue, and the residue hyd them in the Uines, where they might be ready to enter the town at the opening of the gates.
At the breake of the daye they of the towne changed their Watche, at the whych change, the es were lefte without Watches for the time.
But the Englishmen séeyng time to accomplishe their intent, their Ladders, and scaled the walles, and by that meanes, entred the Towne: where, some of them forthwyth brake the gate, and made entry for the reste of their company, whiche, when the garrisons of the Town perceyued, as me~ amazed, they turned themselues to flight.
But not long after, they armed them, and assayled their enimies, but to the Englishmens great auayle, the Earle of Huntingdon wt his company set spurres to theyr horsses, and hasted them to the succour of their first company, whereby the Frenchmen as al discouraged and in dispaire to saue the Towne, at the sight of these newe rescues that came to the Englishmen, leauing behinde them all their riches and substaunce endeanoured themselues, to escape by flighte, and so the towne of Pointois, auoyded of all Frenchmenne, was lefte frée to the English, After these enterprises thus atchieued, the king with all his company came to this Towne of Pointois, where he aboade a certaine time, from whence he sent the Duke of Clarence wt a chosen power of men to Paris, to view ye scituation and strength thereof, before which Citie, when he had tarried certaine dayes and had séene all that him liked, and that none of the Frenche men woulde issue out of the Citie, to fight with him, he returned to the King, and assertayned him of al that he had séene.

And bycause the Castell of Bokinvillers had done certaine inhumane cruelties to the Kings landes that bordered thereabout, to the intente to represse theyr malice, the King lodged himself not far from thence, and sent certaine to assault the same Castle, where both the inhabitants and garrisons feared so much the King, that as men desperate of all succours they yéelded both Castel and goods.
And then all the townes, Castels and holdes within a great circuite, without abyding battaile, yéelded them to the King, but that strong and mightie town of Gysors, wherof the Castel is much more defensible, than the Town, would not submit to the King, wherefore on the last day of August the King with all his host toke his iourney thyther, and enclosed the Towne with his pauilions and tentes.
Betwyxt him and them of the Towne, were many sharpe battayles and cruell assaultes, but at all times the Englishmen put the Frenchmen to flight, wherfore the inhabitantes and garisons of the towne and Castel deliuered the same to the King in the xxiiij. of September.
King Henrie returned with his army to Maunt, where he deuided his host into thrée battayles, whereof he deliuered the one to the Duke of Glocester, whome he sente to subdue the Towne of Saint Germaines, which after manye battayles and assaultes, in short time was yéelded to him: the seconde battayle he sent to the Castell of Mount Oye, which in like manner was yéelded: with the thirde battayle, the King in hys owne perfom went to besiege Mewlance, which aboue al other was most strong.
The situation of this town was in a plenteous Ile betwixte two armes of the sea &c. notwithstanding when the inhabitauntes and Garisons sawe the great prouision of the King they yéelded the town; on the last day of October: from thence the Kyng returned againe to Maunt, and sente the Duke of Excester to besiege the Castle of Garde, whiche to him was yéelded the xx· of December.
King Henrie kept his Christmasse in the Citie of Roane, he sent the Earle of Salisburie, to take the Towne of Fresvey· which in shorte time he toke.
The Earle Marshal and the Earle of Huntington, were sente by the Kyng to subdue the Prouince of Shenon· where the Dolphin had deputed a Captaine with a strong power, whiche Captaine mette the two Earles, and gaue them battayle, but the Englishmen remayned conquerors.
And thus those two Earles subdued the prouince of Shenon· without any other great resistaunce.
Whilest these and many other victories wer atchieued, the King continuing in the Citie of Roane, the ambassadors of Charles the French King, of the Duke of Burgoigne, came to the King to treate of peace, where of the King they were right honourably recoyued, and sent with him to the French King and the Duke of Burgoigne· hys ambassadours, wyth full aucthority to conclude this long soughte peace: the principall ambassadour was the Earle of Warwicke, in company of certaine Bishops and other discrete men, accompanyed with a strong power of armed men.
These ambassadors were first brought to the Duke of Burgoigne, bycause hée was next vnto them, and after they toke their iourney vntil they came to the Citie of Troys, where they founde King Charles of Fraunce with the Quéene his wife, and that beautifull Lady Katheren theyr daughter.
And entring into communication of peace with the Kings counsell of Fraunce, the waye of peace was founde betwixt those two Kings by aliance, that is to say, by a mariage to be made betwixt y^ most victorious K. of England· the Lady Katherin daughter to y^
King Quéene of Fraunce: but bicause they perceyued that many things mighte not be done wtout the presence of the kings, as wel for y^ apposition of their seales for ye ratifying of y^ articles of this peace, as for the solemnization of ye matrimony, also y^
King Charles was a man of many yeres, they condescended y^ the K. of Engla~d at a certain day amo~gst them limited shoulde come to the foresayde Citie of Troys· wt as great an armed power as he woulde.
At whiche day appointed, if he fayled to be there, al his co~municatio~ of peace shold be as voyde.
These things thus concluded set down in writing, y^ erle of Warwicke wt his company returned to y^
K. of Englande, to who~ they declared by order what they had done, who was contente in all things to performe their appointments, prepared for his iourney.
He called togither knights, men of armes archers to y^ nu~ber of xvj. M. of the~ the more part were Archers: when the time came that he would depart toward Troys (as he was accustomed) he deuided his people in thrée parts battayles, two wings, and in that maner the. viij. day of May, he entred his iourny toward Troys in Campaine, where he was met by the Duke of Burgoigne accompanyed with manye noble me~, two leagues wtout the town, who~ he receiued wt gret honor due
Then this most victorious king accompanyed bothe of English and Frenchmen of euery estate degrée, entred the resaid Citie of Troys, y^ stréetes wherof wtout any abyding he passed vntil he came to the kings place, wher K. Charles and the Quéene· his wife abode his comming, of whom the was receyued goodly and after a Princely maner.
King of England was thus royally receiued, after the due resolutions on his part made to King Charles the Quéene, he departed from them, and by the Duke of Burgoine and other great estates as well of England as of Fraunce, he was conueyed to his lodges.
The Cittie was deuided into two wherof the one half was assigned to the Frenchmen, Burgonians, and the other halfe to the Englishmen: and bicause that parte assigned to the Englishmen, suffised not to receyue them all within the walles, but that a great part of the~ must be lodged in the suburbes, the King of Englande, bicause hys people on that part shoulde haue frée concourse togither, he caused the wall on that part of the Citie where he was lodged, to be cast down to the ground.
King Charles gaue aucthoritie and power to Isabel his wife and Quéene, to Phillip Duke of Burgoigne, and to certaine other of his Counsell plenarily to conclude the peace with King Henrie, for hym and for his realme of France, vnder such conditions as shold be decréed, also to proue, ratify, co~firme the same, by oth solemnized in the parso~ of K. Charles, without fraude, in al things to be obserued vnto the sayd K. Henrie, his heyres successours, by the sayde King Charles, his heyres and successors, &c.

Then immediately Isabel the Quéene and the Duke of Burgoigne, in the name of King Charles, made a solemne oth vpon the holy Euangelistes, that y^ same Charles his heyres and successours shoulde obserue and kéepe without fraude the peace made betwixt the two Realmes.
And the same othe the Quéene and the Duke of Burgoigne in theyr owne names and for themselues theyr heyres successours, made vnto the King for him his heyres and successours, and after them as many as were there present both of the Kings counsel, and also of the Parliament, as Bishoppes, Lords, Knightes, and commons, made the same othe to the Kyng.
And the. xxiij. and. xxiiij. daye of May the Chauncellour of Fraunce, and many other Lordes, Bishops, Prelates, and noble men gaue the like fayth and othe.

After the death of king Charles, king Henry shal be king of Fraunce peaceably with hys heyres and successours.
And bicause King Charles by reason of his infirmitie is vnable to gouerne the common weale, king Henrie during ye life of Charles, shal rule and gouerne the realme of Fraunce, to the profit honor of the same king Charles.
King Charles in al his writings shal name the same King Henrie our son and heyre of France, during the life of the said king Charles.

And the Quéene his mother at all times during life he shall kéepe in due estate as belongeth to maiestie, &c. with diuerse other Articles which for libertie set not downe in this place.
After the final end and accomplishing of this marriage, couenants and conditions, ratifyed in all partes, King Henrie, accompanyed of King Charles and of his counsel, of the two Quéenes, Isabel and Katherin, and of the Duke of Burgoigne, departed from Troys, and toke his iourney to Paris, and from Paris not many dayes after they all went to laye siege to the Citie of Sens, whiche was to them contrarie, but before the whole hoste were setled in their places, the Captaine Citizens and Garisons submitted their bodyes and Citie with all that they had to the King.
Then they hasted to Monstrean, which Towne they toke by force.
On the xv. of July they went to the Citie of Melune, and inuironed the same with a strong siege, for there were the Kings of Englande, of France, and Scotlande, the Duke of Burgoigne, Bauier, Clarence, Bedforde, and Excester, the Earles of March, Warwicke, Huntington, and Somerset· &c.
This siege co~tinued. xiiij. wéekes and odde dayes, from the feast of Mary Magdalen· to the feaste of All Saintes, not without in a maner euery day a conflict and sore skirmishe, but at length for wante of victualles the besieged, yéelded themselues to the Kyngs of Englande and Fraunce, from whence the forsayde Kyngs with a greate parte of theyr armye wente to Paris.
King Henrie kept hys Christmasse in the Citie of Paris, in the Castle of Saint Anthony.
And after he had holden a Parliamente there, he went to Roane, and therewith hys Normans, and Englishmen helde a Parliament.
And the~ when he had established sure guarde for this Realme of Fraunce Dutchie of Normandie, he passed throughe Picardie to Caleis, and so to Douer, where with his Quéene he landed on Candlemasse day.
The fourtéenth of Februarie Quéene Katherin was Crowned at Westminster, vnto whom the King assigned to hir dowrie.
markes, also he consented to the deliuerie of the King of Scots, who had bin long prisoner in Englande, with condition, that before his departure out of Englande, he shall take to the Duke of Somersets sister, niece to the Cardinal of Winchester.
The. xxij· of March the duke of Clarence· with many other Lords were slaine beyond the Water of Leire in Fraunce, many Lords were taken prisoners, of the which the Earle of Huntington and the Earle of Somerset were principal.
In a Parliame~t at Westminster it was ordayned that no man should profer gold in payment, but if it helde waight, wherfore was ordayned Balances and weightes.
The king suppressed the French houses of religious Monkes and Friers, and such like in Englande, bycause they thought ill of the Conquest ouer Fraunce, theyr· lands were giuen by him and Henrie the sixth, to Monasteries and Colledges of learned men.
The King hauing disposed all thing in order co~cerning the realme of England and the wars in Scotland· leauing in Englande his Quéene, with a greate power to the number (after Enguerant of thirtye thousande, returned into Fraunce, where, after he hadde visited the King and Quéene of Fraunce at Paris, he tooke the Castell of by assault.
And when he heard, that his enimies prepared themselues to battaile, he approched the floude of Loyre, aboute whyche floud it was said his enimies were: but against him came no man.
Wherfore the Kyng ledde his hoste to laye siege to the City of Sens, commonlye called the Kings new Town, whiche Towne for lacke of victualles yéelded themselues and the Town to the King.
Iohn Mortimer brake foorthe of the Tower of London, and beyng afterwards taken, hée was drawen and hanged.

In the Moneth of October, when King Henry had deliuered the Citie of Paris from all annoyaunces, he with his went to the Citie of Meaulx in Brye, to whych City nigh adioyning, is a place called y^
Market of Meaulx, betwixt which two places floweth the riuer of Marne, whiche also enuironeth bothe the same places.
Thys Citie was besieged all the Winter, wherein were so manye, and so greate stormes and flouds of raine, that the kings host was often annoyed with hu~ger colde.
The sixth of December, Lady Katherine Quéen of Englande, broughte forth hir firste begotten sonne in the Castell of Windsore, and his name was gyuen him Henry: for there receyued hym at the Fonte, Iohn Duke of Bedford hys vncle Lord Warden of England, and Henrie the Kings vncle B. of Winchester, and Iaquelyn dutches of Holland that remained then in England.
In the moneth of Februarie the Knights that were in Garison, and the principall of y^
Citie of Mealx perceyuing that the Sommer comming shoulde cause the siege to be more light, and lesse painefull to the Englishmen, and difficil vnto themselues, departed the Citie and wente into that place, that is called the Market of Mealx, as to the more defensible holde· after whose departing the co~mon people hauing none ability to resist the Kings power, yéelded themselues and the Citie to the King.
After this in the moneth of May, when the King had sore beaten the forsayd Market of Meaulx, he constrayned the Frenchmen that were besieged, to condescende vnto certaine couenauntes, and to deliuer the place vnto him: and shortly after were deliuered to the King the towne of Orepy in Valois, the Castle of Pier Pountmeralaw, Offemou~t and many others.
After the rendering of these Townes and Castles the King returned to Paris.
In the moneth of Aprill Katherin Quéene of Englande shipped at Hampton, and sayled ouer into Fraunce with a strong power, vnder the conducte of Iohn Duke of Bedforde y^ kings brother, Humfrey Duke of Glocester, being appointed Warden of England, in the Duke of Bedfordes place: whe~ the comming of Quéene Katherin was knowne to Kyng Henry hir husband, and to Charles king of France, both these Kings, and with them the Quéene of Fraunce, accompanyed with many great Lordes and estates, as well of Englande as of Fraunce, went to méete hir at Boys de Viscenne, wher she was ioyfully receyued of them, as if she had bin an Angell sente from God.
The. xxx. day of May the two Kings of Englande and Fraunce, with theyr Quéenes departed from Bois de Viscenne, and went to Paris: the king of England and his Quéen were lodged in the Castell of Lowre, and the King of France and his Quéene were lodged in the pallace of Saint Paule.
King Henrie hearing that the Dolphen with a great power besieged the Towne of Guisney, he determined to goe himselfe to the raysing of the siege, and so came to the town of Corbeil, and so to Senlis, where he waxed so sicke, that hée was constrayned to tarry and send his brother the Duke of Bedforde, to rescue the~ of Cosney: but the Dolphin raysed hys siege and departed thence.
King Henrie his disease increasing, he departed this life in the Castell called Boyes de Visceme, not far from Paris, on the last of August, in the yeare
when he had raigned nine yeares fiue monethes and odde dayes.
There was present at his death King Charles of Fraunce, and the two Quéenes: but before his death this most prudent King disposed the guarde of the yong Prince his sonne, and the defence of the realme of Englande, to hys brother Humfrey Duke of Glocester, but the custodie of the body of this yong Prince the King, committed to his vncle the Duke of Excester: and the reuenues of the Dutchie of Normandie, he bequethed to his brother Iohn Duke of Bedforde, for the gouernaunce of the same Dutchy and of the Realme of France.
In his life time he reedified his royall manour that then was called Shine, nowe Richmount: hée founded two Monasteries vpon the Thamis not farre from Richmount, the one of Carthusians, whiche he named Bethlem, the other of religious men and women of Saint Bridget, and that he named Sion.
He founded Gartar, principal Kyng at armes of all Englishmen, and also the brotherheade of Sainte Gyles without Creple Gate of London.
Shortlye after hys departing, his bowels were enterred in the Church of Sainte More de Fosses, and his corps well enbaulmed and seared, was closed in leade: and accompanyed with all the Lords, estates, and commons of England, that were there presente, with also many Lords and great estates, as well of France, Normandie, Burgondie, and Picardie, was brought with greate honour to Paris, and set in the Churche of our Ladie, where were done for him right solemne exequies, with distributio~ of mony and great almes to the poore.
From thence he was broughte to Roane, where he aboade long.
When all things necessarie were prepared for the conueyaunce of the deade King into Englande, hys body was layde in a Chariot, whiche was drawen by foure great horsses: and aboue the dead corpes they layde a figure made of boyled hydes or leather, representing his person, as nyghe to the semblaunce of him as could be deuised, painted curiously to the similitude of a liuing creature: vpon whose heade was set an Emperiall Diadem of golde and precious stones: and in his right hand he helde a Scepter royall, and in his lefte hand a ball of gold.
And in this manner adorned was this figure layde in a bedde in the sayde Chariot, with hys vnsage vncouered toward the heauens: and the couerture of hys bedde was of red silke beaten with golde: and besides that, when the body shoulde passe through anye good Town, a Canapie of maruaylous great value, was borne ouer the Chariot, by men of great worshippe.
In this manner accompanyed of the King of Scottes, and of all Princes, Lordes, and Knightes of hys house, he was broughte from Roane to Abeuile, where the corpse was set in the Churche of Sainte
From Abuile, he was broughte to Hedin, and from thence to Menstreull, so to Bulloigne, and to Caleis.
In all thys iourney were many men about the Chariot clothed al in white, which bare in theyr handes torches burning, after whom followed al the housholde seruauntes in blacke, and after them came the Princes, Lordes, and estates of the Kyngs bloud, adorned in vestures of mourning: and after all thys, from the sayde Corpse the distaunce of two Englishe myles followed the Quéene of Englande righte honourably accompanyed.
In thys manner they entred Caleis, from whence after a fewe dayes they departed, and continued theyr iourneys by water and lande vntyll they came to London, where they arriued about the tenth of Nouember, so were conuaied by London bridge through Cheap to the Cathedrall Churche of Saint Paule: vppon the couering of the for moste of the foure horsses that conuayed the Chariot, wer imbrodered the auntient armes of Engla~d: vpon the couerture of the seconde horsse were the armes of England and Fraunce, in one shielde quarterly: vppon the couerture of the thirde horsse was imbrodered the armes of Fraunce, without any maner of difference: and on the fourth horsse were the armes of King Arthur.
When his exequies were solemnized at Saint Paules Church in London, hée was brought from the~ce to be enterred in the Abbay of Saint Peter at Westminster amongst hys noble auncestoures.
Thus thys most victorious and renoumed Kyng entred the way decréed for euery creature, in the floure most lustie time of hys age, to witte but sixe and thirtie yeares olde. ·.· King Henry of Windsor.

Continuing the time of his youth, the gouernance of the Realme was committed to ye Duke of Glocester, and the gard of his person to the Duke of Excester: and to the Duke of Bedford was giuen the regiment of France, who right wisely and nobly ruled the same so long as he liued.
This Henry was of witte and nature simple, gentle, and méeke: he loued better peace than warre, quietnesse of mind than businesse of the world: honestie than profite: rest and than trouble and care: all iniuries that euer happened to him, which were many, he suffered patiently, and reputed them to be worthely sent of God for his offences.
The xxj. of October, Charles King of France passed out of this world, and was buried at S. Denis in France after he bin Crowned King
He was greatly beloued of his people all his life time, and therefore was called Le Roy Charle le biew ame: but yet he had a sicknesse the more part of his raigne, that being out of his witte, he woulde strike all that came néere him: it tooke him first in the Citie of Mans shortly after he had bin in Flanders to reduce the Flemings to obedience.
There was by reason héereof great trouble in France, bycause those that were néere to him in lignage, sought euery one to haue the chiefe gouernement in theyr hands.
When he thus dyed, the Realme was left in miserable state, for people of each strange nation were gouernoures in the Realme.
First, the Englishmen had conquered a great parte, and sought to haue the rest: and the Duke of Burgoigne, with many other great Lordes alied with hym, sought to conquere all, for the yong King Henry of Englande who claymed then to be King of France, and likewise in all the money that was coyned, the Axmes of both Realmes were quartered.
The Crownes that were stamped in the tyme of Charles, and all other money more, were forbidden to be currant, and called to the Minte.
King Henry caused a péece to be stamped called a Salus, worth two and twentie Shillings, and Blans of eyghtpence a péece, and so in no place of France where King Henry was obeyed, any other money was receyued, but suche as had the Armes of France and England stamped on it.
Charles Duke of Tourayne the Dolphin, sonne to King Charles le biew ame, clayming to be right inheritor to the Realme of France, by the auntient Edictes and customes of the sayde Realme as was alledged, proclaymed himselfe King after the deceasse of hys father, notwithstanding, by the agréement made at the marriage of his Sister to the King of England, it was otherwise concluded (as before is recited) and so there were two Kings in France, Henry and Charles, both which striuing for the Crowne, the Realme was in way of perdition.
Parliament at London began the ninth of Nouember, wherin was granted to the King a subsedie for thrée yeares, fiue nobles of euery sacke of wooll that should passe out of the land.
This yeare, the Weast Gate of London (sometime called Chamberlaine Gate was begon to be new builded, by the executors of Sir Richard Whitington, late Maior of London.
King Charles of France began now to aduance himselfe into the D. of Burgoignes lands, and the Connestable of Scotland, accompanied with many Lords, and men of war of K. Charles side, layd séege to the towne of Carnens, but the Marshall of Burgoigne assembled men of warre to raise the séege, with whome went the Earle of Salisburie, a valiant ma~, and now being come togither, fought with their enimies, wan the field, tooke the Connestable, whose sonne was slayne in the field.
Many of K. Charles men were slayne and taken to the number of tenne or twelue hundred good men of warre.
After whiche victorie, the Earle of Salisburie layde séege to Montaguillon in Champeigne, and continued there an eyght monethes before he could haue it rendred, and then caused the same to be rased and throwne downe.
Then the Earle of Salisburie beséeged the Castell of Monnes, which at length was yéelded to him: this Castell he also rased bet downe, which was the strongest place in all Champaigne, it was after repaired by King Charles.
About the same time, the Duke of Burgoigne gaue his sister the Lady Anne in marriage to the Duke of Bedford, and so the alliance was made more strong betwixt the English the Burgonians.
Phillip de Comines writeth, that Iohn D. of Bedford, was Regent in France for the Englishmen, his monethly allowa~ce in that office amounting to
Dukes of Burgoigne, Bedford, Britein, met in ye town of Amiens, there was also the Earle of Richmont, brother to the Duke of Briteine, and many other great Lordes, whiche Earle of Richmont had married the Duke of Briteines eldest sister Margaret, sometime wife to the Duke of Guyen, and Dolphin of France.
These thrée Dukes were fiue or sixe dayes togither in Amiens, in great friendship and reuerence each to other, promising perpetuall amitie to continue.
After this, the Duke of Briteine returned into his Countrey, the Duke of Bedford, (Regent of France, to Paris, and the D. of Burgoigne, to Arras, but within a while after: the Earle of Richmont reuolted to King Charles, vpon some misliking he had conceyued against the Duke of Bedford.
King Charles receyued him ioyfully, made him Connestable of France.
About the same time, the Duke of Bedford caused Crotoy to be beséeged both by water and by land, which after foure or fiue monethes séege, was both Towne and Castell deliuered to the Duke, where he ordeyned Ralph Butler to bée Captayne.
At that time, the Duke of Bedford was obeyed as Regent in all places through Vimeu, Pontieu, and Picardy, from Paris to Reins, Chalons, Troyes, vp to the water of Loyre.
About the feast of Saint Andrew, the Captaynes of King Charles assembled their forces about Le Fere, and Nelle, and tooke by night the Towne of Campeigne, and spoyled the inhabitants of all their goodes.
Shortly after came the Duke of Bedford to Mondidier with twelue hundreth fighting me~, and requested the Lord of Sanenses to lay séege to Campeigne, and he woulde finde him men and money to wage them, wherevnto he graunted, and after fiftéene dayes séege, had the same deliuered.
In the moneth of February, Iames Steward, the yong King of Scottes, who was taken by the Englishmen in the eyght yeare of King Henry the fourth, and had remayned in England prisoner till this time, was now deliuered, and married in Saint Mary Oueryes Church in Southwarke to the Lady Iane, daughter to Iohn Earle of Somerset, Cousin to King Henry.
Sir Iohn Mortimer Knight was drawne to Tiborne, and there hanged and quartered, but his body was buryed in Saint Iohns Church at Clarkenwell.
King Henryes people beséeging the Castell of Dinry in the marches of Normandy, they within compounded to yéeld at a day assigned, if the Englishmen were not fought withall before the same day by the Frenchmen: wherevpon as well King Charles, as the Duke of Bedford, made great leuies of men to kéepe the day appoynted, and héerewith they drew both towards Yury: but when King Charles heard how the Duke of Bedford was comming towardes him with such a puissance, he was counselled to draw backe, and so he did towards Vernole in Perche, whome the Duke of Bedford followed, so that he found his armie néere to Vernole.
And when eyther armie was in sight of the other, they put themselues in order of battell, and the Englishmen made an hedge of their Horsse behind their battell, bycause the French shoulde not strike in among them on the backes: and the Frenchmen ordered themselues in battell array, making a great battell of footemen, in the which, they put the floure and chiefest men.
They appoynted their Horssemen to set on the Englishmen a trauerse, the battayles on foote came vpon and ioyned, where was a sore fight betwixt them, continuing two houres togither, that no man might iudge which way the victorie would encline: but at length, the men of King Charles began to breake, and then the Englishmen began to thrust in among them, and did so much, that they discomted their enimies.
There were slayne the Earle Dowglas, Duke of Turon, Iames Dowglas, Earle of Wighton, Iohn Earle of Boughan, with the Uicount Nerbon, and many other, to the number of tenne thousand (sayth Fabian foure thousande sayeth mine Author (a Frenchman who sayeth, that the Duke of Bedford bare himselfe most valiantly, fighting with an axe so fiercely, as he had the prayse of all other.
The Earles of Salisburie and Suffolke gouerned themselues also right valiantly.
The Lord of Torsy, and other Lords of Normandy, which before had taken part with the Englishmen, this day turned to the French, hoping that the Englishmen shoulde haue lost the battell.
True it is, that the Frenchmen would neuer suffer their King Charles to be present in person at any battayle, but when they thought to pitch a fielde, they sent him into some strong Towne.
By the losse of this battayle fought on the seauentéenth of August, before Vernole in Perche, King Charles was put to great hinderance, so that he was not able in puissance to giue the Englishmen any battayle, hauing ynough to defende and kéepe his Townes and fortresses against them.
The Duke of Bedford returned into Normandy, where he punished many that fledde from him the day of the battayle.
Then went he to Paris, where he found the Duke of Burgoigne, who receyued him, and the Dutches of Bedforde his wife, the sayde Duke of Burgoignes Sister, right ioyfully, and made to them great feast, at whiche feast also were the Earles of Salisburie and Suffolke, the olde Quéene of France, mother to King Charles, and many other greate estates of diuers nations, amongst the whiche, the Duches of Bedford was holden for the most gallantest Lady of all other, and with hir, the Countesse of Salisburie, a very faire Lady.
The Duke of Bedford that had neuer iusted before, iusted there.
The Duke of Burgoigne was a very goodly amiable ma~ of personage, doing excellently well whatsoeuer he tooke in hand, and especially in dansing and iusting he excéeded all other of his Countrey.
At this feast, he became desirous of the Countesse of Salisburie, and some messages passed betwixt them, which came to the Earle of Salisburies eare, whereof he was nothing contented with the Duke, and therfore sought to do him displeasure afterward.
This feast being ended, the Duke of Burgoigne went into his Countrey of Burgoigne, and there tooke to wife the Duches of Neuers, which had bin wife to his Unkle the Duke of Neuers· and had by hir two Children.
She was halfe sister to the Duke of Burbon, but she liued not long with him.
The D. of Burgoigne also gaue his sister the yongest, named Agnes, in marriage vnto Charles de Barbon, Earle of Cleremont, for the which, the Duke of Bedford, and other were wroth, for that he made suche alliance with the enimies without their accord.
This yeare, the Frenchmen repaired the Castell of Mouns in Champaigne, which had bin a little before destroyd by the Englishmen, and now it was well stuffed with victuals and men, which began to make sore war to the Countrey, but shortly after the Earle of Salisburie beséeged the~, and with him Messire Iohn de Luxenburg, who did so much, that the Castell was yéelded to him.
The D. of Bedford, with his wife the Duches, lay for the most parte in Paris, leading there a pleasant life with the Lady whom he greatly loued, and was lodged in ye house of the Tournels, to the Castel Saint Anthony, where he made faire buildings, and his men still made sore warres againste the French, towards the Riuer of Loyre, and other places, vpon base Normandy, and toward the Duchie of Alanson.

Iohn Duke of Brabant hir Cousin german, Cousin gern also to Duke Philip of Burgoigne, and before that, she married to the Earle of Pontioue, son to King Charles le aime, eldest Brother to King Charles now liuing, notwithstanding that she was thus married to the Duke of Brabant, yet was she conuayed by Sir Robersart Knight, and brought into England to the Duke of Glocester, and there married to the sayd Duke of Glocester: and so she had two husbandes aliue at once, Brabant and Glocester, thing thought vnreasonable, both against God, the world, and the Church, for she had bin four or fiue yeares in companie with the Duke of Brabant, but there had fallen some variance betwixt them, and so she was come from him into Henault.
About the last of Aprill began a Parliament at Westminster, wherein was graunted a Subsedie of twelue in the pound of all manner Merchandize comming in, or passing out of this Realme: thrée Shillings of a Tunne of Wine for the tearme of thrée yeares to be holden.
And furthermore it was enacted, that all Merchant strangers should be set to an English host within fiftéene dayes of their comming to their port sale, and to make no sale of any Merchandize, ere they were so lodged: then within fortie dayes following, to make sale of all they brought: and if any remayned vnsold at the sayd fortie dayes end, that then all such Merchandize vnsold, to be forfeyted.
Also, that all Strangers that caried any woolles out of this land, should pay. xliij. shillings four pence for a sacke custome, where the English Merchants and Denisons payde but fiue nobles &c.
After the marriage had bin solemnized betwéene the Duke of Glocester, and Iaqueline Duches of Holland, as is aforesayde, within a moneth after the Duke of Glocester assembled an armie of twelue hundred fighting men at the least, all Englishmen, and taking the Duches with him in co~panie, passed ouer to Caleis, and streight from thence to in Artois, and so into Henault, making no outrage as he passed through Duke Phillips Countreys.
At their comming into Henault, many townes obeyed the~, and other refused to do: likewise were y^
The D. of Burgoigne hearing of this, was sore offended for the iniurie done to his Cousin of Brabant, the dishonor of his Cousin the Duch
Iaqueline, and the euill dealing of the Duke of Glocester, and therefore, to ayde the Duke of Brabant, he appoynted many of his Captaynes, with xij. C. fighting me~ Pickards, to go against the Duke of Glocester.
The Duke of Brabant was a man but of weake complexion, and therefore by the Counsell of Brabant it was ordeyned, that his yonger brother Philip, Earle of Saint Pol, should be chiefe Captayne of the warre, against the Duke of Glocester.
He had a great Armye, as the more part of the Nobles of Brabant, of Henalt, and of Burgoigne, in all,
Piere de Luxenburge, Earle of Conuarson; his néere kinsman, had the leading of the Armie, for himselfe was but yong.
The Duke of Burgoigne had put of his men in garrison within the towne of Braine, in the Countie of Henault, who made sore warre to the Countrey about, but the Earle of Saint Pol, and Conuarson, did come and beséege Braine, continuing afore it twelue dayes before they within yéelded, compounding to departe with bodyes and goodes saued: these hauing wonne Braine, destroyde it vtterly, and that done, tooke the Field with all puissance, which was great: and the Duke of Glocester likewise came into the fielde, so that they approched néere togither, and the vauntcurrers skirmished, but the battayle ioyned not.
The Duke of Glocester had sent his Heraulte, and written to the Duke of Burgoigne, calling him Traytor, and disloyall to the King of England and France, for that he had sente men in ayde against him, and offered him the Combate, wherevnto the Duke of Burgoine aunswered, that hée would accept the Combate, denying that euer he had fayled of his promise, but that the Duke of Glocester had done great wrong to the Duke of Brabant, to haue bereft him of his wife, contrarye to the ordinance of God, and of holye Church, and for other wordes which the Duke had vttered against the Duke of Burgoignes honor, he gaue him the lye, and so farre the matter went in words betwixt them, that the day was appoynted for the Combate, and the Duke of Burgoigne chose for Iudge of the Combate the Emperour of Almayne, and the Duke of Burgoigne sent the Duke of Glocester a safeconduct, to departe safely into England, to prepare himselfe of things necessarie for the Combate, wherevpon, both the Campes brake vp: the Duke of Glocester wente to Mons in Henalt, to the Duches his wife (so tearmed) gaue hir to vnderstand, that he was desirous to trie the Combate with the Duke of Burgoigne: and many other things he told hir, which he performed not, for within four dayes after, he tooke all his power with him, and returned into Engla~d, and left the Duches in Mons, smally acco~panyed with ye people of that Countrey.
Shortly after his departure, the Duke of Burgoigne sent the Lord Lilladam to the Towne of Mens, to receyue Iaqueline the Duches, who being deliuered vnto him, he conueyed hir to Gaunt, where the Duke and she made great semblance of ioy togither, she promising to bée gouerned alwayes by his aduise, but to goe to hir olde husband the Duke of Brabant she would not: and when she espied hir time, she stale away into hir Countrey of Holland, where she was well receyued of many Lordes, and began forthwith to mainteyne warre against Duke Philip of Burgoigne, and sent to the Duke of Glocester for ayd, who sente to hir a thousand fighting men, vnder the conduct of the Lorde Fitzwaters.
The Duke of Burgoigne fearing least Iaqueline would deliuer the Countrey of Holland into the possessio~ of the D. of Glocester, he assembled his power, and wente into Holland, to put the Cou~trey into obeysance.
At his comming thither, Iaqueline, accompanyed with many Nobles of the Countrey, and the Lord Fitzwaters, woulde haue defended his landing, but notwithstanding al the defence they could make, he entred vpo~ the~, there, néere to ye Towne of Brusseils, they ioyned in battaile, the D. of Burgoigne his people against the Englishmen Hollanders, taking ye Duches Iaquelines part: there was a fierce battayle on all sides, but in the end, the Hollanders and Englishmen were all discomfited, and there dyed in that place aboue seauen or eight hundred, besides those that were taken prisoners: the Lord Fitzwater hardly escaped.
After this battell gote by the Duke of Burgoigne, diuers Townes of the Countrey reuolted to him, against Iaqueline the Duches, as Dordrecht, Sericzee, and many other.
Shortly after, the Duke of Burgoigne leauing garrisons in those Townes that obeyed him, to make resista~ce against the Duches that lay in the Towne of Gaunt, hée returned into his Countrey of Flanders and Artoyes, there to prepare such abiliments as were necessary for him to vse at the Combate appoynted betwixt him and the Duke of Glocester.
The Duke of Glocester likewise in England made his pronision of his habilimentes and furniture, but the Duke of Bedforde, brother to the Duke of Glocester, tooke greate paynes to make them friends: and also the counsell of the yong King of England, were nothing content with this variance, doubting least it might be occasion that the Duke of Burgoigne mighte withdrawe himselfe from their amitie, whereby their businesse in France should be hindered.
The Duke of Bedford therefore tooke hys iourney from Paris, to Caleis, and so into Englande, to the ende to agrée the sayde Dukes: he tooke with him the Duches his wife, and not past a four or fiue hundred men.

The Archbishop of Canterbury, with the Prince of Portugale, and other, tooke great labour vpon them to pacifie this variance betwixt the two bréethren, the Protector and the Bishop, in so muche, that they rode betwéene them eyght times, ere they might bring them to any reasonable conformitie, and lastly, they agréed to stande to the rule of the Duke of Bedford, Regent of France, or of such as he would assigne, wherevpon the Citie was set in more quiet, and the Bishop of Winchester wrote a Letter to the Duke of Bedford Lord Regent, as followeth.
RIght high and mighty Prince, and right noble, and after one leuest earthly Lorde, recommende me vnto your Grace with all my heart: and as ye desire the welfare of the King our soueraigne Lorde, and of his Realies of England and of France, and your owne weale, with all yours, hast you hither, for by my troth, and ye tarrie long, we shall put this Land in ieoperdy with a Field, such a Brother yée haue héere, God make him a good man.

BY this our writing ensealed, we grant and wil permit truly, that Thomas Cocke of Londo~ Draper, shal come in good suertie and in safegard to our presence, without any hurt of his person, and so auoyde from vs againe at his pleasure, with al other perso~s assigned at his denominatio~ with him comming in likewise.
The commaundement by the Capitaine of Kent, sent vnto Thomas Cocke aboue sayd.
FOr your instruction, first ye shall charge all Lumbardes strangers, being marchaunts, Venetians, Florentines, and other, this day to draw them together, and to ordaine for vs the Captain.
Brigandines, xij. battaile Axes, xij. Glaues, vj. Horses with saddle and bridle completely harnessed, and a thousande markes of readie money: and if this oure demaund be not obserued and done, we shall haue the heades of as many as we can get of them.
What answere to this demaund was returned finde not, but like it is the same was graunted and performed, for finde not thesaid Captaine and Kentishmen, at their being in the Cittie, to haue hurt any straunger.
In the meane time the King sent notable men to the sayd Captaine and his fellowship, to knowe their purpose and the cause of their insurrection: vnto whom the Captaine answered, that he and his company were assembled there to redresse and reforme the wrongs that were done in the Realme, and to withstand the malice of them that were destroyers of the common weale, and to amend the defaultes of them that were chiefe counsellers to the King, and shewed vnto them the articles of complaints touching the misgouernment of the realm, wherein was nothing conteined but séemed reasonable, wherof a copie was sent to the Parliament holden that time at Westminster, with also one other byll of requestes by them made, of things to be reformed, and to haue answere thereof agayne, but he had none.
The bill of Articles they intituled The complaint of the Commons of Kent, and causes of the assembly on the Blackheath.
Inprimis, it is openly noysed that Kent shoulde be destroyed with a Royall power, and made a wylde forest, for the death of the Duke of Suffolke, of which the Commons of Kent thereof were neuer guiltie.
Item the King is styrred to lyue onely on his Commons, and other men to haue the reuenues of the Crown, the which hath caused pouertie in his excellencie, and great paymentes of the people, nowe late to the King graunted in his Parliament.
Item that the Lordes of his Royall bloud béen put from his dayly presence, and other meane persons of lower nature exalted and made chiefe of his Priuie Counsell, the which stoppeth matters of wronges done in the Realme, from his excellent audience, and may not be redressed as lawe will, but if bribes and giftes be messengers to the handes of the sayde Counsell.
Item, the people of his Realme be not payde of debts owing for stuffe and purueyaunce taken to the vse of the Kings housholde, in vndoyng of the sayde people, and the poore Commons of this Realme.
Item, the Kings meniall seruauntes of housholde, and other persons, asken dayly goods and lands, of empeached or indited of treason, the which the King graunteth anon, ere they so endaungered be conuict.
The which canseth the receyuers thereof to enforge labours and meanes applyed to the death of such people, so appeached or indited, by subtyl meanes, for couetyse of the sayde grauntes: the people so empeached or indited, though it be vntrue, may not be committed to the Lawe for their deliueraunce, but helde stil in prison, to their vttermost vndoyng and destruction, for couetyse of goods.
Item, though diuers of the poore people and Commons of the Realme, haue neuer so great right, trueth and perfite tytle to theyr lande, yet by vntrue clayme of enfeffement made vnto diuers States, Gentles, and the Kings meniall seruauntes in maintenaunces againste the ryghte, the true owners dare not holde, clayme, nor pursue their right.
Item, it is noysed by common voyces, that the Kings landes in Fraunce bene aliened and put awaye from the Crowne, and his Lordes and people there destroyed with vntrue meanes of treason, of which it is desyred, enquiries thorough all the Realme to bée made howe and by whom, and if suche Traytors may be found guiltie, them to haue execution of Lawe without any pardon, in example of other.
Item, Collectors of the. xv. pennie in Kent be greatly vexed and hurte in paying great summes of money, in the Eschequere to sue out a Writ called Quorum nomina for the allowaunce of the Barons of the Ports, which nowe is desyred, that hereafter in the lieu of the Collectors the Barons aforesaide may sue it out for their ease at their owne costes.
Item, the Sherifes and Undersherifes, let to ferme their offices and Bayliwikes, taking great suertie therfore, the which causeth extortions done by them by their Baylifes to the people.
Item, simple poore people that vse not hunting, be greatly oppressed by inditements fained done by the saide Sherifes, Undersherifes, Baylifs, and other of their assent, to cause their encrease for paying of their said Ferme.
Item, they returne in names of Enquests in writing into diuers Courtes of the Kinges not somoned nor warned, where through the people dayly léese great su~mes of money, welny to the vttermost of their vndoyng: make leuie of amercementes called the Gréene Waxe, more in summes of money than can be founde due of recorde in the Kings bookes.
Item, the ministers of the courte of Douer in Kent vexe and arest diuers people through all the Shire out of Castle warde passing their bands and libertie vsed of olde time, by diuers subtile and vntrue meanes and actions falselye fained, taking great sée at their lust in great hurt of the people on all the Shire of Kent.
Item, the people of the saide Shire of Kent, may not haue their frée election in the chosing Knights of the Shire, but letters bene sent from diuers estates to the great Rulers of all the Country, the which enbraceth their tenaunts and other people by force to choose other persons than the common will is.
Item, where as Knightes of the Shire should chose the kings collectors indiffere~tly without any bribe taking, they haue se~t now late to diuers persons, notifying them to be collectors, wherevpon giftes and bribes be taken, and so the collectors office is bought and sold extortionously at the Knightes lust.
Item the people be sore vexed in costes and labour, called to the Sessions of peace in the sayd Shire, appearing fro~ the farthest vttermost part of the West vnto the East, the which causeth to some men. v. dayes iourney, where vpon they desire the saide appearaunce to be deuided into two partes the which one part, to appeare in one place, an other part, in an other place in releuing of the gréeuaunce and intollerable labours and vexations of the said people.
The requestes by the Captaine of the great assemble in Kent.
INprimis, desireth the Captaine of the commons, the welfare of our soueraigne Lord the King, al his true Lords spirituall and temporall, desiring of our saide soueraigne Lorde, and of al the true Lordes of his counsell, he to take in al his demaines, that he may raigne like a King royall, according as he is borne our true Christian King annoynted, and who so will saye the contrarye, we all will liue and die in the quarrell as his true liege men.
Item desireth the said Captaine, that he will auoide al the false progenie and affinitie of the Duke of Suffolke, the whiche béene openlye knowne, and they to be punished after the custome and Lawe of this Land, to take about his noble person the true Lordes of his Royal bloud of this his Realme, that is to say, the high and mightie Prince ye duke af Yorke late exiled from our saide Soueraigne Lordes presence (by the motion and stirring of the traiterous and false disposed the Duke of Suffolke and his affinitie) the mightie Princes Dukes of Excester, Buckingham, and Norfolke, and all the Earles and Barons of this land: and then shal he be the richest King Christen.
Item, desireth the said Captaine commons punishment vpon the false traitors, the which contriued and imagined the death of the high mightful excellent Prince the Duke of Glocester, the whiche is too much to rehearse, ye which duke was proclaimed as traitor.
Upon the which quarrell, we purpose all to liue and die vpon that it is false.
Item the Duke of Excester, our holy father the Cardinal, the noble Prince Duke of Warwike, and also the Realme of Fraunce, the Dutchie of Normandie, Gascoyne, and Gwi, Anioy and Mayne, were deliuered and lost, by the meanes of the sayd traytors, and our true Lords, Knights, and Esquiers, and many a good yoman lost and sold ere they we~t, ye which is great pitie to heare, of the great and gréeuous losse to our Soueraigne Lorde and his Realme.
Item, desireth the sayd Captayne and Commons that all the extortions vsed dayly among the Common people, might be layde downe, that is to say, the Gréene Waxe the which is falsely vsed, to the perpetuall destruction of the kings true Commons of Kent.
Also the kings Bench, the which is too gréefefull to the shire of Kent without prouision of our Soueraigne Lord and his true Counsell.
And also in taking of Wheate and other graynes, Béefe, Mutton, and all other victual, the which is importable to the sayde Commons, without the briefe prouision of our saide Soueraigne Lorde and his true Counsell, they may no longer beare it.
And also vnto the statute of laborers and the great extortioners the which is to say the false traytors, Slegge Crowmer, Isle, and Robert Este.
These bylles when the Counsell had well perused, they did not onely disalowe and condemne them the authors, as proude and presumptuons, but also perswaded the King rather to suppresse those rebels by force, than by fayre promises.
Whervpon the King remoued from Westminster vnto Greenewiche, from whence he woulde haue sent certayne Lordes with a powre to haue destressed the Kentishmen, but the men sayde to their Lordes they would not fight against them that labour to amend the common Weale: wherevppon the Lordes were driuen to leaue their purpose.
And because the Kentishmen cryed out against the Lorde Say the Kings Chamberlayne, he was by the King committed to the Towre of London.
xv. thousand men well prepared for the warre, but the sayd Kentishmen fled the night before his comming into the wood countrey néere vnto Senocke, wherevpon the King returned againe to London, and sent sir Humfrey Stafforde· Knight with William Stafford his brother, and other Gentlemen, to follow the Kentishme~, who finding them at Senock, set vppon the rebels, and fought with them a long time, but in the ende both the Staffordes were slaine with many other of their people.
When Iacke Cade had thus ouercome the Staffordes, he forthwith apparelled himself with the knightes apparell, and after he had refreshed his people, he returned to the Blackeheath, and there pight agayne his fielde, and lay there from the. xxix. daye of June, tyll the first day of July, in which season came vnto him the Archbyshop of Caunterburie, and the Duke of Buckingham, with whom they had a long communication, and founde him ryght discrete in his aunsweres.
Howbeit they coulde not cause him to submit himselfe and lay downe his people.
In the meane while, the King and Quéene hearing of the increasing of his rebels, and also the Lordes fearing their owne seruaunts, least they would take the Captaines part, remoued from London to Killingworth, leauing the Citie without ayde, except onely the Lorde Scales, which was left to kéepe the Towre, and with him a manly and warly man named Mathewe Gowghe.
Then the Captaine of Kent thus houering at Blackeheath, to bring himselfe the more in fame, that he kept good Justice, beheaded there a petie Captayne of his named Paris, for so muche as he had offended agaynst such ordinaunces as he had established in his hoste: and hearing that the King and his Lordes were thus departed, drewe him néere vnto the Cittie, so that vppon the first of July, he entred the Borough of Southwarke, then beyng Wednesday, and lodged him there at the Harte, for he myght not bée suffered to enter the Cittie.
And vpon the same day, the Commons of Essex in great number pight them a fielde vppon the playne of Myles ende.
And vppon the seconde day of the sayde moneth, the Maior called a common Counsell at the Guild hall, to for the withstanding of these rebels, in which assembly were diuers men of sundrye opinions, so that some thought good that the sayde rebels should be receyued into the Cittie, and some otherwise.
Among the which Robert Horne Stockefishe monger then being an Alderman, spake sore agaynst them that woulde haue them enter.
For the which, the Commons were so moued agaynst him, that they ceassed not till they had him committed to ward.
v. of the clocke, ye Captaine with his people entred by the bridge, and cutte the Ropes of the draw bridge a sunder with his sworde, when he was passed into the Citie.
He made in sundrye places thereof Proclamations in the kings name, that no man in payne of death shoulde robbe or take any thing without paying therefore.
By reason whereof he wanne the hartes of the Commons, but all was done to beguile them, after as he came by London stone he strake it with his sword, and said: now is Mortimer Lorde of this Citie, and then shewing his minde to the Maior for the ordering of his people, he returned into Southwarke there abode as he before had done, his people comming and going at lawfull houres when they would.
On the morrowe ye third of July, the sayd Captaine agayne entred the Citie, and caused the Lorde Say to be fette from the Tower to the Guild hall, where he was araygned before the Maior and other the Kings Justices, and Robert Horne Alderman before named should haue bene likewise araygned, but that his wife and other friendes for. v. hundred markes gat him restored to his libertie.
The Lord Say desiring he might be tried by his Péeres, was by the rebels forceably taken from the officers, brought to ye Standard in Cheape, where they strake off his head, pight it on a pole, and bare it before them, and his body they caused to be drawne naked at a horse tayle vpon the pauement from Cheape into Southwarke to the sayd Captaines Inne.
Also a Squier called Crowmer that was then Sherife of Kent, that had wedded ye said Lord Sayes daughter, by commaundement of the Captaine was brought out of the Flete, that was committed thither for certaine extortions that he had done in his office, and led to Mile end without London, there without any iudgement his head was smit off, the Lord Sayes head and his were borne vpon. tj. long poles vnto London bridge and there set vp, and the Lorde Sayes body was quartered.
The same daye the Captaine went vnto y^ house of Philip Malpas Draper Alderma~, robbed his house, taking from thence great substance, returned into Southwarke: on the next morowe he againe entred y^
Citie, and dyned that day in the Parishe of Saint Margaret Patyns at one Cherstis house, and when he had dyned, like an vncourteous guest he robbed him, as the day before he had Malpas.
For which two robberies, althoughe the poore people drewe to hym and were parteners in the spoyle, yet the honest and wealthy commoners cast in their mynds the sequele of this matter, and feared least they should be delt with in lyke manner.
Then the Maior and Aldermen with assistaunce of the Worshipful Commoners, in safegarde of themselues and of the Cittie, toke their Counsell how they might driue the Captaine and his adherents from the Citie, for the performaunce whereof the Maior sent vnto the Lorde Scales, and Mathew Gowghe, then hauing the Tower in their gouernment, requiring their ayde and assistaunce, which they promysed.
On the. v. of July the Captayne being in Southwarke, caused a manne to be beheaded there, and that day entred not the Cittie.
When night was come, the Maior and the Citizens, with Mathew Gowghe kept the passage of the Bridge, and defended the Kentishmen which made great force to reenter the Cittie.
Then the Captayne séeyng this bickering, went to Harneys, assembled his people, and set so fiercely vppon the Citizens, that he draue them backe from the stoupes in Southwarke, or Bridgefoote, vnto the drawbridge, in defending wherof many a man was drowned and slaine.
Among the which was Iohn Sutton Alderman, Mathewe Gowghe a Squire of Wales, and Roger Hóysand Citizen.
This skirmish continued all night tyll nyne of the clocke on the morrowe, so that sometyme the Citizens had the better, and sometymes the other, but euer they kept them vpon the bridge, so that the Citizens passed neuer much the Bulwarke at the Bridge foote, nor the Kentishmen no farther than the drawe Bridge.
Thus continuing the cruell fighte to the destruction of much people on both sydes, lastly after the Kentishmen were putte to the worst, a truce was agréede for certayne houres, during which truce, the Archbyshoppe of Caunterburie, then Chauncellor of England, sonte a generall pardon to the Captayne for him selfe, and an other for his people, by reason wherof, he and his company withdrewe them little and little, and their Captayne put all his pillage and goods that he had robbed, into a Barge, and sent it to Rochester by water, and himselfe went by land and woulde haue entred into the Castle of Quinborow with a fewe men that were lefte about him: but he was there let of his purpose: wherefore he fled into the wood Countrey beside Lewes in Sussex.
The Captayne and his people being thus departed, not long after Proclamations were made in diuers places of Kent, Sussex, and Southerey, that who might take the foresaid Captaine aliue or dead· should haue a thousand markes for his trauaile.
The Copie of the Writ and Proclamation by the King, for the taking of the sayd Cade and his felowship.
HENricus Dei gratia Rex Angliae Franciae, dominus Hibernia, vniuersis singulis custodibus· &c.
For as much as one Iohn Cade borne in Ireland, which calleth himselfe Iohn Mortimer, and in some writing calleth himselfe Captayne of Kent, the which Iohn Cade the last yeare tofore his dwelling in Sussex with a Knight called sir Thomas Dagre, slewe there a woman with childe, and for that cause tooke the gréeth of the Churche, and after for that cause for sware the Kings lande: The which Iohn Cade also after this, was sworne to the Frenche parte, and dwelled with them, which hath nowe of late time, (to the intent to enrich him selfe by robbyng and dispoyling of the Kings liege men, as it is· nowe openly knowne, to bring himselfe to great and high estate) falsely and vntruely deceyued many of the Kings people, and vnder colour of holy and good intentes, made them to assemble with him against the Kings Regalitie and his Lawes, and nought setting by the Kings Grace and pardons grau~ted, not onely to him but to al the Kings subiectes, the which by his deceyt haue assembled with him, the which he with great reuerence receiued on Munday last passed, and so did all that were assembled with him: not withstanding al this, he laboureth now of newe to assemble the Kings people againe, to that intent beareth them on hand, that the Kings letters of pardon graunted to him and them, be not auaileable nor of none effect without authoritie of Parliament: wheras the contrarie is true, as it is openly knowen by that, that the King grauntes from tyme to tyme his Charters of Pardon to such as him lyst, of all manner of crimes and offences both generall and speciall.
The King therfore willeth and commaundeth, that none of his subiectes giue fayth nor credence to the said Informations of the sayde false nor accompany with him in any wise, nor comfort nor sustaine him nor his with victuall, nor with any other things.
But will whosoeuer of the Kings subiectes may take him, shall take him, and that who so euer taketh him and bringeth him quicke or dead to the King or to his Cou~sel, shal haue a thousand markes for his labour truely payde him without faile or delaye by the prouision of the Kings Counsell.
And who so euer taketh any of those that from this day forth accompany with him, shal haue. v. marke for his reward, truely to be paide in maner and forme aboue saide.
And ouer this, commaunding all Constables, Ministers, Officers of the said Shire, that none of them on paine of death take vpo~ them to execute any co~mandement by word or writing sent or· made vnto them by the said Cade, calling himselfe Mortimer Captaine, be it to rere any people or to any other intent: but to arest and make to be arested such as take vpo~ them to bring any such co~maundeme~t by writing or by word.
Et hoc nullatenus omittatis Teste me ipso apud Westminster· x. die Iulij, anno regni.
After which Proclamation thus published, a Gentleman of Kent named Alexander Eden awayted so his time, that he tooke the sayde Cade in a Garden in Snssex.
And there he was slaine at Hothfield· and brought to Londo~ in a cart, there quartered, his head set on Londo~ bridge, and his quarters sent to diuers places in Kent.
King sent his Co~missioners into Kent, rode after himself, caused inquiry to be made of this riot in Cau~terbury, where for y^ same. vitj. me~ were iudged executed, in other townes of Kent, Sussex was dane y^ like execution.
This yeare the Commons also in diuers partes of England, and in Sussox, Salisbury, Wilshire, and other places, didde much harme to many persons, among the which, on the xxix. of June, William Ascoth Bishop of Salisburie, (after he had sayde Masse at Edington was by his owne tenauntes drawen from ye Altar, in his Albe with his Stole about his necke to the toppe of an hill, and there by them shamefully murthered, and after spoyled to the naked skynne: they renting his bloudy shirt, tooke euery man a péece, made boast of their wickednesse.
The day before, his Chariot was robbed, to the value of. x. thousand markes.
Souldiours made a fraye against the Maior of London the same day he tooke his charge at Westminster, at nyght comming from Saint Thomas of Acres, after he had bene at Paules.
The. vj. of Nouember began a Parliament at Westminster, and the first of December the Duke of Somerset which was newly come out of Normandie, was put vnder arest, and his goods by the Commons was foulely despoyled and borne away from the Blacke Eryers.
After which ryot, on the nexte morrowe, Proclamation was made through the Cittie, that no man should spoyle or robbe, vpon paine of death: and the same day at the Standard in Cheape was a man beheaded for doyng contrarie to the Proclamation.
And thus beganne malice to spring between the Lordes of the Lande, and specially against the Duke of Somerset and other of the Quéenes Counsell, for the léesing of Normandie, whereof the chiefe Cittie of Roane was lost or giuen vp by appoyntment the yeare procéeding (as witnesseth Gagwyne, vpon condition that the Duke of Somerset with his wife English souldiours, shoulde with such goods as they might carrie, fréely from the Cittie: For which frée passage he shoulde paye vnto the French king lvj. M. which amount to fourtèene thousand marks sterling.
And also he was bounde to deliuer into the French Kings possession, all Townes and Castels that at that day were in the possession of Englishmen, wythin the Dutchie of Normandie: for performaunce of whiche couenauntes, the Lord Talbot was sent for one of the pledges, and so by one Floquet all the Townes and Castelles were to the Frenche Kyngs vse receyued, Harfleete onely excepted, whereof the Captaine named Curson.
with the assistance of sir Thomas Auringham, in despight of al the French Kings power laide both by Sea and lande, helde the same a full moneth or more, and then for lacke of rescue gaue it vppe by appoyntment.
The sixtéenth of Februarie, King Henrie accompanyed with the Duke of Somerset and many other Lords, tooke towardes the Marches of Wales, for as muche as he was credibly informed, that the Duke of Yorke assisted wyth diuerse other Lordes and men of name, had in those partes gathered a strong power of people, and with them was entring the land, and so helde on his iourney towarde him: but whe~ the Duke had witting of the Kings greate power, he returned from the way which was taken by the Kings hoste, and hasted towardes London·, and when he had receyued knowledge from the Citie, that he might not there be receyued, he went ouer Kingstone Bridge, and so into Kent, and there vpon Brent Heath neare vnto Dertforde, he pight his fielde, wherof the king hauing knowledge, sped him after, lastly came vnto Blacke Heath and there pighte hys fielde.
When both the hostes were thus embattelled, mediation of peace was made betwéene them, for furtheraunce whereof, to the Duke were sente the Bishops of Winchester and of Ely, with the Earles of Salisburie and Warwicke.
To whom it was answered by the Duke, that he nor none of his company entended any hurt to the Kings person, nor to any of hys cou~sayle, beyng louers of the Common wealth· and of him and hys land: but his intent and purpose was to remoue from the King a fewe euill disposed persons, by whose meanes the common people was gréeuously oppressed, and the communaltie greatlye impouerished, of whome he named the Duke of Somerset to be the principal &c.
And further to vnderstande of the Dukes meaning by this his forcible entring of the Realme, (as himselfe pretended) may appeare by certaine letters by him written to the King, and also the Kings aunsweares, to the same, both whiche thinke good here to set downe as finde them recorded.
PLease it your highnesse to co~ceiue, that sith my departing out of this your Realm, by your commandement, and being in your seruice in your land of Ireland, haue bin informed that diuerse language hath bene sayde of me to your moste excellente estate, whiche shoulde sounde to my dishonour and reproch, and charge of my person: howe be it that, aye haue bene, and euer will be, your true liegeman and seruaunt: and if there be any man that wyll or dare say the contrarie, or charge me otherwise, beséech your rightwisenesse to call him before your high presence, and wyll declare me for my discharge as a true Knighte ought to do, and if doe not, as doubt not but shall, beséech you to punishe me as the poorest man of your lande: And if hée bée founde vntrue in his suggestion and information, béeséech you of your highnesse that he be punished after his desert, in example of all other.
Please it youre excellence to knowe, that as well before my departyng out of thys your Realme, for to goe into your Lande of Irelande, in your full noble seruice, as sith, certaine persons haue lyne in awayte for to hearken vppon me, as Syr Iohn Talbot Knighte at the Castell of Holte: Syr Thomas Stanley Knighte in Cheshire: Pulforde at Chester: Elton at Worcester: Brooke at Gloucester: and Richarde grome of your Chamber at Beaumarres: whyche hadde in charge (as am enformed,) for to take me and putte me into youre Castell of Conway, and to strike of the heade off Syr William Oldehall Knighte, and to haue put in prison Sir William Deuereux Knight, and Sir Edmond Malso Knyghte, withouten enlarging, vntyl the time that your highnesse had appointed theyr deliueraunce.
Item, at such tyme as was purposed for to haue arriued at youre hauen of Beaumarres, for to haue come to youre noble presence to declare me your true man and subiecte, as my duetie is, my landing was stopped and forbarred by Henrie Norres, Thomas Norres, William Bulkeley, William Grust, and Bartholmew Boulde, your officers in Northwales, that should not lande there, nor haue victuall nor refreshing for mée and my fellowshippe, as haue written to your excellence here before, so farre for the that Henrie Norres deputye to the Chamberlayne of Northwales, sayde vnto me that hée hadde in commaundemente that shoulde in no wise haue landing, refreshing, nor lodging, for men nor for horsse, nor other thyng that myghte turne to my worshippe or ease, puttyng the blame vppon William Saye Usher of your Chamber, saying and affyrmyng that am against youre intente, and as a Traytoure, as am informed: and moreouer, certaine letters were made and delyuered vnto Chester, Shrewesburie, and to other places for to lette myne entrye into the same.
Item aboue all wrongs and iniuries done vnto me of malice, wythout any cause, beyng in your lande of Irelande, in youre honourable seruice, certayne commissions were made and dyrecte vnto diuerse persons, whiche for the execution of the same, satte in certayne places, and the Juries empaneled and charged, to the whiche iniuries, certayne persons laboured instauntlye to haue me endited of treason, to the intente for to haue vndone me and myne issue, and corrupted my bloude, as it is openlye publyshed: beséeching your Maiestie Royall, of your ryghteousnesse, to doe examyne these matters, and therevppon to doe suche Iustice in his behalfe as the cause requyreth, for mine inte~t is fully to pursue to your highnesse for the conclusio~ of these matters.
COosin we haue séene the byll that yée tooke vs late, and also vnderstand y^ good hu~ble obedience that yée in your selfe shewe vnto vs, as well in worde as in déede, wherfore our intente is, the more hastily to ease you of suche things as were in your sayde Bil.
How be it that at our more leysure we might aunswere you to your sayde Byll, yet we let you wit, that for the causes aforesayde, we will declare you now our intent in these matters: sith it is that a long time among the people hath bene vpon you many straunge language, and in especial anone after your disordinate and vnlawfull slaying of the Bishoppe of Chester, diuerse and manye of the vntrue shipmen and other· sayde in their maner, words against our estate, making manace to our own person by yoursayings, that yée shoulde be fetched with many thousandes, and yée should take vpon you that, whiche yée neyther oughte, nor as we doubt not, yée will not attempt, so farre forth that it was sayde to our person by especiallye we remember of one Wasnes whyche hadde like words to vs.
And also ther was diuerse of such false people, that went on had like language in diuerse of our townes of our lande, whiche by our subiectes were taken and duely executed: wherefore we sente to diuerse of our Courtes and places, to hearken and to take héede if any such manner co~myng were, and if there had bin, for to resist it: but comming into our lande our true subiecte as yée did, our intente was not that ye, nor lesse of estate of our subiectes, nor none of youre seruauntes shoulde not haue bin letted nor· warned, but in goodly wise receyued: howe be it that peraduenture your sodaine comming, without certayne warnyng, caused oure seruauntes to do as they dyd, considering the causes aboue sayde.
And as to the enditement that yée spoke of, we thinke verily, and holde for certaine warning, caused our seruaunts to doe as they did, considering the causes aboue sayde.

During this watch, a great Cou~sell was holden by the Lordes, and a faygned agréement was made, betwéen the King, the Quéene, and the Duke of Yorke with his retinue: for ioy whereof the. xxv. day of Marche a generall Procession was made in Saint Paules Church at London, where the King in Royall habite with his Diademe on his head kept the state, before whom went hand in hand y^ duke of Somerset, the Earle of Salisburie, the Duke of Excester, the Earle of Warwike, and so one of the one faction, an other of that other sort.
And behind the King, the Duke of Yorke led the Quéene with great familiaritie to all mens sightes.
The. xiij. of April there was a great fraye in Fletestreete, betwéene men of Courte and the inhabitantes of the same stréete, in which fray the Quéenes Atturney was slaine.
For this facte the King committed the principall gouernours of Furniuals, Clifforde and Barnardes Inne to prison in the Castle of Hertforde, and William Taylour, Alderman of that warde, with many other, were sent to Windsore Castle the vij. of May.
On Thursday in Whitson wéeke, the Duke of Somerset with Anthonie Riuers and other.
iiij. kept Justes before the Quéene in the Towre of London agaynst thrée Esquiers of the Quéenes.
On the Trinitie Sonday or Munday following, certaine shippes appertayning to the Earle of Warwike, met with a fléete of Spanyardes, and after long and cruell fyght tooke vj. of their Shippes laden with Yron and other Marchandies, drowned and chased to the number of. xxvj. not without shedding of bloud on both partes, for of the Englishmen were slayne an hundred, and many more wounded and sore hurt.
The King and Quéene beyng at Westminster the. ix. day of Nouember fell a great debate betwéene Richard Earle of Warwike and them of the Kings house, in so much that they woulde haue slayne the Earle: and vnneth he escaped to his Barge and went after to Calleis, for he was not long before made Captaine thereof by authoritie of the Parliament.
Soone after, the young Duke of Somerset by stirring of them that hated the Earle of Warwike, was made Captayne of Calleis, and a Priuie Seale direct to the Earle for to discharge him of the Captayneshyp: but the Earle for as muche as he was made by Parliament, he woulde not obey the Priuie Seale, but continued forth in the sayd office.
The Noble Science of Printing was about this tyme founde in Germanie at Magunce by one Iohn Cuthembergus a Knight: One Conradus an Almaine brought it into Rome: William Caxton of London Mercer brought it into England aboute the yeare a.
And fyrst practised the same in the Abbay of Saint Peter at Westminster, after which tyme it was likewyse practised in the Abbayes of Saint Augustine at Caunterburie, Saint Albons, and other Monasteries of England.
In a lyttle Towne in Bedfordshire there fell a bloudie rayne, whereof the red drops appeared in shéetes the which a woman had hanged out for to dry.
In this tyme the Realme of Englande was out of good order, as it had bene of long tyme: for the King béeyng symple and pitifull, was ledde by couetous Counsell.
The King grewe in debte dayly, but payment was not made.
All the possessions and Lordshippes that pertayned to the Crowne, the King had giuen some to Lordes and some to others, such as would begge them, so that himselfe had almost nothing lefte to lyue on, but such impositions as were put to the common people, as Taxes, Tallages, Quinzimes, all which was spent in vayne, for he helde no houshold, nor maintayned no warres, for which misgouernaunce the heartes of the people were turned from them that had the Land in gouernaunce.
The Quéene with such as were of hir affinitie, ruled the Realme as hir lyked, gathering riches innumerable.
The Officers of the Realme, especially the Earle of Wilshire Treasurer of England, for to enriche himselfe, pilled the poore people, disherited rightfull heyres, and did many wrongs.
The Quéene was defamed and sclaundered that the young Prince was not hir sonne but a Bastard gotten in adulterie: wherefore she dreading that he shoulde not succéede his father in the Crowne of Englande, allyed vnto hir all the Knightes and Esquiers of Chestershire, for to haue theyr fauour: she helde open housholde among them, and made hir sonne the Prince to giue a liuerie of Swannes to all the Gentilmen of the Countrey, and to many other through the land, trusting through their strength to make hir sonne King, making priuie meanes to some of the Lordes of England for to stirre the King that he should resigne the Crowne to her sonne, but she could not bring their purpose about.
The. xxj. day of September Richard Earle of Salisburie hauing gathered a well appoynted armie for dread of his enemies, especially of the Quéene, tooke his way towarde Ludlowe, where at that time the Duke of Yorke lay, to the intent that they both together would haue rydden to the King to Colshull in Staffordshire, to haue excused them of certaine articles layd against them by malice of their enemies as they sayd.
Wherevpon those that were about the King, and also the Quéene, who laye at Eglishall, moued him to assemble a great powre, whereof Iames Twichet Lorde Awdley was made chiefe, and had the leading of them into the fielde called Bloreheath néere vnto Mucklestone, by the which the sayde Duke and the Earle must néedes passe, there both hostes mette and fought a mortall battaile, wherin the Lord Audley was slaine with Hugh Venables of Kinderton, Thomas Dutton of Dutton, Richard Mollynes, William Trowtbek, Iohn Legh del Bothes, Iohn Donne of Vtkinton, and Iohn Edgerton of Edgerton Knightes, Richard Donne of Croton, Iohn Duttes Esquiers, and many other of Chestershire, that had receyued the Princes liuerie of Swannes: and there were take~ prisoners the Earle of Salisburies. ij. sonnes Thomas and Iohn, and sir Thomas Harington, which were sent to Chester, but soone after deliuered.
After this discomfiture, the Earle of Salisburie passed forth to Duke Richard to Ludlowe, and thether came to them for Calleis the Earle of Warwike, which all thrée writ a letter vnto King Henry, whereof the tenure is this.
MOst Christian King, right high and mighty Prince, our most dread Soueraigne Lord, after as humble recomme~dations to your high excellencie as will suffice.
Our true intent to the prosperitie augmentation of your high estate, and to the commo~ Weale of this Realme, hath be shewed vnto your highnesse in such writing as wée make thereof.
And ouer that an Indenture signed by our hands in the Churche Cathedrall of Worcester, comprehending y^ proofe of the truth duetie that (God knoweth) we beare to your saide estate, and to the preheminence and prerogatiue thereof, we sent vnto your good Grace by the Prior of the sayde Churche, and diuers other Doctors, and among other, by M. William Lynwood Doctor of Diuinitie, which ministred vnto vs seuerally the blessed Sacrament of the body of Jesus, wherevppon we and euery of vs deposed for our sayde trueth and duetie, accordyng to the tenor of the sayde Indenture.
And sith that time we haue certified at large in writing and by mouth, by Garter King of Armes, not onely to your said highnesse, but also to the good worthie Lordes beyng about your most Noble presence, the largenesse of our sayde trueth and duetie, and our intent and disposition, to serche all the motions that might serue conueniently to the affirmation thereof, and to our perfect suerties from suche inconuenient and vnreuerent ieopardies as wée haue béene put in diuers tymes here before.
Whereof we haue cause to make, and ought to make suche exclamation and complaint, not without reason, as is not vnknowen to all the sayde worthie Lordes, and to all his land, and wil offer vs to your high presence, to the same intent, if we myght so doe without sayd suertie, which onely causeth vs to kéepe suche fellowshippe as we doe in our léefull manner.
And hereto we haue forborne and auoyded all thinges that might serue to the effusion of Christian bloud, of the dreade that we haue of God, and of your Royall Maiestie: and haue also eschued to approche your sayde most Noble presence, for the humble obeysaunce and reuerence wherein we haue, and during our lyfe will haue the same.
And yet neuerthelesse we heare, that we be proclaimed and defamed in our name vnrightfully, vnlawfully, and sauing your high reuerence, vntruely, and otherwise (as God knoweth) than we haue giuen cause, knowing certainely, that the blessed and noble intent of your said good grace, and the righteousnesse thereof is, to take, repute and accept your true and lawfull subiectes, and that it accordeth neyther with your sayd intent, nor with your wyll or pleasure, that we shoulde be otherwise taken or reputed.
And ouer that, our Lordshippes and tenantes bene of high violence robbed and spoyled, agaynst your peace and lawes, and all ryghteousnesse.
Wée therefore, as we suffice, beséeche your sayde good Grace to take, repute, and receyne therevnto our sayde trueth and intent, which to God is knowne, as wée shewe it by the sayde tenor of the same Indenture.
And not apply your sayde blessednesse ne the great righteousnesse and equitie wherewith God hath euer endued your high nobilitie, to ye importune impacience and violence of such persons as intende of extreme malice to procéede vnder the shadowe of your high might and presence, to our destructio~, for suche inordinate couetise (wherof God is not pleased) as they haue to our Landes, Offices, and goods, not letting or sparing therefore, to put suche things in all lamentable and too sorrowfull ieoperdie, as might in all wyse take effecte, by the mysterie of Gods will and power, nor not hauing regarde to the effusion of Christian bloud, ne any tendernesse to the noble bloud of this Land, such as serue to the tuition and defence thereof, ne not waying the losse of your true liege men of your saydo Realme, that God defend, which knoweth our intent, and that wée haue auoyded there from as farre as we may with our suerties, not of any dreade that wée haue of the sayde persons, but onely of the dreade of God of your said highnesse, and will not vse our sayde defence vntil the time that wée be prouoked of necessitie, whereof wée call heauen and earth vnto witnesse and recorde, and therein beséeche God to be our Judge, and to delyuer vs according to our sayde intent, and our sayde trueth and duetie to your said highnesse and to the sayde Common Weale.
Most Christian King, right high and mightie Prince, and most dread Soueraigne Lorde, wée beséeche our blessed Lorde to preserue your honour and estate in ioye and felicitie.
Written at Ludlowe the. x. day of October: R. Yorke, R. Warwike, R. Salisburie.
After their excusation contayned in this letter sent to the King, they withdrewe them, and went into diuers partes beyond the Seas, for the more suertie of their persons.
The Duke of Yorke went into Ireland, where he was honorably receyued: the Earle of Marche, Salisburie, and Warwike, not without great ieoperdie and perill, as well on the lande as on the sea, went to Calleis, and abode there.
Then was a Parliament holden at Couentrie, wherein were attaint of treason, Richard duke of Yorke, Edward Erle of Marche his sonne and heire, Richard Earle of Warwike, Edmond Earle of Rutlande, Richard Earle of Salisburie, Iohn Lorde Clifford, Lorde Clinton, sir Thomas Harington, sir Iohn Wenlocke, Thomas Neuill, Iohn Neuill sonnes of the Earle of Salisburie, Iames Pickering, Iohn Conyers, Thomas Par, William Oldhall, and Henrie Ratforde Knightes, Iohn Bowser, Thomas Cooke, Iohn Clay, Richard Gyton, Robert Browne, Edward Bowser, Thomas Vaughan, Iohn Roger, Richard Grey, Walter, Deuorux, Walter Hopton, Roger Kynderton, William Bowes, Foulke Stafforde, the Lorde Powys, and Alice Countesse of Salisburie, their goods and possessions escheted, and their heires disherited vnto the
degrée, their tenauntes spoyled of their goods, bemaymed and slayne, the towne of Ludlowe longing to the Duke of Yorke, was robbed to the bare walles, and the Dutches of Yorke spoyled of hir goods.
The Earle of Warwike hauing a great Nauie, kepte the narrow seas, and sought with the Spanyards, kylled many of them, tooke their great vessels, with one Carrake of Iene, and got in them great riches.
In this moneth of October, Henrie the yong duke of Somerset, Henry Lorde Roos, and Lorde Audley, with men of Armes sailed toward Calleis, to the intent the Duke shoulde haue bene Captaine there: but when he came to lande, they of Calleis would haue taken him, so that he hardly escaped to the Castle of Gwines: his souldiors were stripped out of their harnesse and let go.
The Lord Audley was taken into Calleis, and the Lord Roos fled into Flaunders, and after returned into England.
Not long after, Richard Lord Riuers was sent to Sa~dwich to kéepe the towne and certaine great ships which lay there at Anker, but when the Earle of Warwike sawe time conuenient, he sent some of his men to Sandwich by night, ye which tooke the Lorde Riuers and Antonie Wooduile his sonne in their beds, led them ouer to Calleis, with al the great ships saue one called Grace de Dieu, the which might not be had away bicause she was broke in the bottome.
Sir Baudwyne Fulford, vndertooke on paine of loosing his head, yt he woulde destroy yt Earle of Warwike, but when he had spent ye King a thousand markes in money, he returned againe.
Then was the Duke of Excester Admirall sent to the sea with a great Nauie for to distresse the Earle of Warwike and his Nauie, he sailing from Sandwiche to Dertmouth, for lacke of victuals and money his Souldiours forsoke him there.
And betwéene Sandwiche and Dertmouth he met the Earle of Warwike comming out of Ireland that had bin there for to speake with the Duke of Yorke, and brought with him his mother that was sled thither for dread, and led hir to Calleis: but the Duke of Excester durst not set vppon the Earle of Warwike, nor the Earle woulde not distresse him, because he was Admirall and of the Kings bloud, but let him passe by.
men were sent to conduct the duke of Somerset fro~ Gwynes into England, but abiding ye wind in ye port of Sandwich, ye Earle of Warwikes men spoyled them of their harnes, killed their captain Mou~ford many other.
The Earles at Calleis, sent to the Archbishop of Caunterburie, and at large to the commons of England certaine Articles in writing, beginning thus: Worshipful sirs, we the Duke of Yorke, the Earles of March, Warwike, and Salisburie, sewed offered to haue come vnto the King our Soueraigne Lords most noble presence, to haue declared there asore him for our dutie to God to his highnesse to the prosperitie and welfare of his noble estate, and to the Common Weale of all his Lande as true liege men, the matters following, that is to say.
In primis the great oppression, extortion, robberie, murther and other violences done to Gods Church and to his ministers thereof, against Gods and mans law.
Item, the pouertie miserie that to our great heauinesse our Soueraigne Lord sta~deth in, not hauing any liuelode of the Crowne of England whereof he may kéepe his honorable housholde, which causeth the spoyling of his sayde liege men by the takers of his sayde housholde, which lyuelode is in their hands that haue bene destroyers of his sayd estate, and of the sayde common Weale.
Item, how his Lawes be partially and vnrightfully guided, and that by them that should most loue and tender his said Lawes, the said oppression and extortion is most fauored and supported, and generally, that al righteousnesse and Justice is exiled out of the sayde land, and that no man dreadeth to offend against the said Lawes.
Item, that it will please his saide good Grace to liue vpon his owne liuelode, wherevpon his noble Progenitors haue in dayes heretofore lyued as honorably and as worthily as any Christian Princes, and not to suffer the destroyers of the sayde land, and of his true subiectes, to lyue thervpon, and therfore to lacke the sustenances that should be belonging to his sayd estate, and finde his sayd houshold vpon his poore commons, without payment, which neyther accordeth with Gods nor mans lawe. Item, how oft the said commons haue bene greatly maruellously charged with taxes tallages to their great empouerishing, whereof little good hath eyther growne to the king or to the said land, and of the most substance thereof the King hath left to his part not half so much, and other Lordes and persons, enimies to the sayd common Weale, haue to their owne vse, suffering all the old possessions that the King had in Fraunce Normandy, Aniow Maine, Gascoyn Gwiene, won gotten by his father of most noble memory, other his noble progenitors, to be shamefully lost or sold.
Item, how they can not cease therwith, but now begin a new charge of imposition and tallages vpon the said people, which neuer afore was séen, that is to say, euery towne, ship to finde men for ye Kings Gard, taking ensample therof, of our enimies aduersaries of Fraunce, which imposition and tallage, if it be continued to heire, heires, and successors, will be the heauiest charge and worst ensample that euer grewe in Englande, and the foresayde subiectes, and the sayde heires successors, in such bondage as their auncetors were neuer charged with.
Item, where the King hath now no more liuelode out of his Realme of Englande, but onely the Lande of Ireland, and the towne of Calleis, and that no King Christened hath such a Lande and a Towne without his Realme, diuers Lordes haue caused his highnesse to write letters vnder his Priuie Seale, vnto his Irishe enemies, which neuer King of Englande did here to fore, whereby they may haue comfort to enter into the conquest of the sayde Lande, which letters the same Irishe enemies sent vnto me the sayde Duke of Yorke, and maruelled greatly that any such letters shoulde be to them sent, speaking therein great shame and villanie of the sayd Realme.
Item, in like wise the King by excitation and labour of the same Lordes, wrote other letters to his enemies and aduersaries in other lands, that in no wise they should shew any fauour or good will to the towne of Calleis, whereby they had comforte ynough to procéede to the wynning thereof.
Considered also, that it is ordayned by the labour of the sayd Lords, that no where victuall nor other thing of refreshing or defence should come out of Englande, to the succour or reliefe of the sayde towne, to the intent that they woulde haue it lost, as it may openly appeare.
Item, it is déemed ought greatly to be déemed, that after that the same Lordes would put the same rule of England, if they might haue their purpose and intent, into the handes and gouernaunce of the sayd enemies.
Item, howe continually sithe the piteous, shamefull, and sorrowfull murther to all Englande, of that Noble, worthie, and Christian Prince Humfrey Duke of Glocester the Kings true vncle, at Burie, it hath bene laboured, studyed, and conspired, to haue destroyed and murthered the sayde Duke of Yorke, and the yssue that it pleased God to sende me of the Royall bloud, and also of vs the saide Earles of Warwike Salisburie, for none other cause but for the true hart that God knoweth we euer haue born, and beare to the profite of the Kings estate, to the Common Weale of the same Realme, and defence thereof.
Item, howe the Earles of Shrewsburie and Wilshire, and the Lord Beaumount, our mortall and extréeme enemyes nowe and of long tyme past, hauing the guiding aboute the most Noble person of our sayde Soueraigne Lorde, whose highnesse they haue restrayned and kepte from the libertie and fréedome that belongeth to his sayde estate, and the supporters and fauourers of all the premysses, woulde not suffer the Kings sayde good grace to receyue and accepte vs, as he would haue done if he might haue had his owne will, into his sayde presence, dreading the charge that woulde haue bene layde vppon them, of the miserie, destruction, and wretchednesse of the sayde Realme, whereof they becauses and not the King, which is himselfe as noble, as vertuous, as rightuous and blessed of disposition, as any Prince earthly.
Item, the Earles of Wilshire and Shrewsburie, and the Lorde Beaumount, not satysfyed nor content with the Kings possessions and his goods, stirred and excited his sayd highnesse to holde his Parliament at Couentrie, where an Acte is made by their prouocation and labour, agaynst vs the sayde Duke of Yorke, my sonnes Marche and Rutlande, and the Earles of Warwike and Salisburie, and the Sonnes of the sayde Earle of Salisburie, and many other Knightes and Esquiers, of diuers matters falsely and vntruely imagined, as they will answere afore almighty God in the day of Dome, the which the sayde Earles of Salisburie and Wilshire, and the Lorde Beaumount prouoked to be made, to the intent of our destruction and of our yssue, and that they myght haue our lyuelode and goods, as they haue openly robbed and dispoyled all our places and our tenementes, and manye other true men, and nowe procéede to hangyng and drawing of men by tyrannie, and will therein shewe the largenesse of their violence and malice as vengeably as they can, if no remedie be prouided at the Kings highnesse, whose blessednesse is neither assenting nor knowing thereof.
We therefore séeyng all the sayde mischiefes, hearing also that the Frenche King maketh in his lande great assembly of his people, which is greatly to bée dreade for many causes, purpose yet agayne with Gods grace to offer vs to come agayne to the sayde presence of our sayde Soueraygne Lorde, to open and declare there vnto hym the mischiefes aboue declared, and in the name of the land to sue, in as reuerent and lowely wise as wée can, to his sayde good Grace, to haue pittie and compassion vppon his sayde true subiectes, and not to suffer the same mischiefes to raygne vppon them.
Requiring you in Gods behalfe, and praying you in our owne, therein to assist vs, doyng alway the duetie of liege men in our persons to our sayd Soueraigne Lord, to his estate, prerogatiue, and preheminence, and to the suertie of his most Noble person, wherevnto we haue euer bene and will be as true as any of his subiectes aliue, wherof we call God, our Lady S. Marie, and all the Saintes in heauen vnto witnesse and record.
In the meane time the Earle of Wilshire treasurer of England, the Lorde Scales and the Lorde Hungerforde, went to Newberie, whiche longed to the Duke of Yorke, and there made inquisition of all them that in any wise had fauoured the sayde Duke, whereof some were founde guiltie, and were drawen, hanged, and quartered, and all the inhabitauntes of the Towne were spoyled of their goods.
From thence the Earle of Wilshire went to Southampton, where vnder colour to take the Earle of Warwicke, he armed fiue gret Caraks of Iene with souldioures, taking victuals of the Kings price without payment, and put a great part of hys treasure into the sayde Caraks, and after sayled about in the sea, and at laste stale into Dutchlande, sending backe againe hys souldiours into Englande.
Then were the Kings priuie seales directed to all Bishops, Abbots, Priours, and other states, to lende the Kyng money, therewith to wage souldiours to kéepe the Sea coasts: but the commons of Ke~t dreading the like vengeance to be taken vpon them, as was done vpon them of Newberie, sent priuily messangers to Caleis, to the foresayde Earles, beséeching them in all haste possible to come to theyr succour, whervpon the said Erles sent ouer into Kent the lord Fawconbridge to know if their déedes woulde accorde with theyr wordes, and anone the people of Kent and other shires adioyning, resorted to the sayde Lorde Fawconbridge in greate number.
When the Earles knewe the wylling heartes of those people, they prepared to come into thys lande, againste whose comming, a long Ballet was fixed vpo~ the gates of Canterburie, made in fauour of the Duke of Yorke and the sayde Earles, beginning thus: In the daye of fast and spirituall affliction, The celestiall influence of bodies transitorie, &c The Erles of March, Warwick, and Salisburie, arriued at Sandwich, where met wyth them Thomas Bourcher, Archebyshop of Canterburie, who with hys crosse borne before him, and a greate number of other people, accompanyed them to London, into the whiche Citie they entred on the seconde of Julye: wyth them came the Popes legate, to treate of peace if néed wer. was a conuocation of the Clergie holden in S. Paules Church· where the sayde Earles being present, the Earle of Warwicke recited the cause of their comming into the lande, with the misgouernements thereof, and then made open othe vpon the crosse of Canterburie, that they had euer borne true faith and alegiaunce to King Henry.
Then the Earles of March and Warwicke, with the Lords Fauconbridge, Clinton, Borser Priour of Saint Iohns, Audley, Burgavennie, Say, and Scrope, the Archbyshop, the Popes legate, the Bishops of Excester, Ely, Salisburie, and Rochester, addressed the~ forth to the King at Northampton, leauing the Earle of Salisbury to be gouernour of the Citie in their absence.
The Lorde Scales and Hungerforde, that before the comming of the Earles, were in the Citie of London, and would haue had the gouernance thereof, went to the Towre of London, and with them the Lordes Vessy, Louel, Delaware, Kendale a Gascoigne: Knightes, sir Edmond Hampden, Thomas Brune Sherife of Kent, Iohn Bruyn of Kent, Geruayes Clyfton treasurer of the King house, Thomas Tyrel, the Dutchesse of Excestex, many other.
Then was the Tower of London besieged both by water and lande, that no victualles might come to them.
And they that were within the Towre cast wilde fire into the Citie, and shotte manye small Gunnes, whereby they brent and slew me~, women, and children, in the stréets: also they of the Citie layde greate Gunnes on the furtherside of the Thamis against the Tower, and brake the Wals in diuerse places.
The King lying in the Friers at Northa~pton, ordayned a strong and myghtie fielde in the Meddowes beside the Nunrie, hauing the riuer at his backe.
The Earles with their power comming to Northampton, sent certaine Byshops to the King, beséeching him to admit y^
Erle of Warwicke to come to his presence, to declare their innocencie, which request being denyed by the Duke of Buckingham, the Earles sent an Heralde of Armes, desiring to haue hostages for his safe comming and going, but he might not be heard.
The thirde time the Erle of Warwicke sent worde to the King, that at two houres after noone he would speake with him, or dye in y^ field.
The Bishop of Hereford, a white Frier the kings Confessour, incouraged the kings parte to fight, wherfore after the battayle he was committed to the Castelf of Warwicke, where he was long prisoner.
The te~th of July at two of y^ clocke after y^
Earles of March Warwicke let cry through the field y^ no man should lay hand vpon the King on y^ co~mon people, but on the Lordes, Knights Espuiers: then both hosts incountred foughte halfe an houre, the Lord Grey that was the Kings vaward breake the fielde and came to the Earles partie, and was a great helpe to them in obtayning the victorie: many on the kings side were flayn, many y^ fled were drowned in ye riuer, y^
Duke of Buckingham, the Erle of Shrowesburie, ye Lorde Beaumont the Lord Egremont were slain by y^
Kings wt many Knights Esquires: ye kings ordinaunce of Guns might not be shot, there was so gret rayne that day: When the field was done, the Earles had the victorie, they came to the King, he being in his tent, said in this wise.
Most noble prince, displease you not though it haue pleased God of his grace to grant vs the victorie of our mortal enemies, y^ which by their venemous malice haue vntxuely stirred moued your highnesse to exile vs out of your land, woulde haue vs put to finall shame and confusion: we come not to y^ intent for to vnquiet ne grieue your sayde highnesse, but for to please your noble person, desiring tenderly the high welfare prosperitie therof, of al your realme, and to be your true liegemen while our liues shall endure.
The King of these words was greatlye recomforted, anone was led to Northampton with procession, where he rested thrée dayes, came to London the sixtéenth of July, and was lodged in the Byshops Pallaice.
The nintéenth of Julye they that were in the Tower of London, for lacke of victualles yéelded and came forth, of the which afterward some were drawn and headed.
The Lorde Scales late in an euening entred a Wherry with thrée persons, and rowing towarde Westminster, there to haue taken Sanctuarie, was descried by a woman, and anone the Wherry men fel on him, killed him, cast hym a lande beside Saint Marie Oueries.
When Quéene Margaret heard that the king was take~, she wyth hir sonne, and eight persons fled, to the Castel of Hardlagh in Wales, and was robbed by the way in Lancashire, of all hir goodes to the valewe of ten thousande markes: from thence she went into Scotland.
The tenth of August Iames King of Scottes besieging the Castle of Rockesborough, was slaine with a Gun that brake in his Campe.
The one and twentith of September the Duke of Somerset came from Gwines into England.
The vitj. of October a Parliame~t was begun at Westminster, vnto the which came Ri. duke of Yorke, that a little before was come out of Irelande, and being lodged in the Pallaice, the Kyng being there, he brake vp the dores of the Kyngs Chamber, so that the King giuing hym place, tooke an other Chamber.
Then the sayde Duke, as right heyre by lyneall descent from Richard the seconde, chalenged the realme, purposing to haue bin crowned on Alhallown day next following, and herevppon sente to the Parliament in wryting hys sayde clayme, title, and pedigrée.

Thys yeare the Duke of Excester was founde deade in the Sea betwéene Douer and Caleis, but howe he came there the certaintie coulde not be knowne.
King Edwarde hauing prepared hys armye, ledde the same to Douer from thence to crosse the seas to Caleis.
The force that passed wyth hym at thys presente was the greatest that euer came into Fraunce, moste of them beyng Horssemenne, all in verye good order well armed.
All the Nobles of the Realme were there, a fewe excepted, they were fiftéene hundered menne of armes very well mounted, and the moste of them barded and richly trapped, after the manner of the Frenche Warres, and well accompanyed with horssemenne of theyr retinue, they were at the leaste fiftéene thousande Archers on horssebacke, and a greate number of ftemenne and others, as well to pitche theyr Tentes, whereof they were well furnyshed, as also to attende vppon theyr and inclose theyr Campe, and in all theyr armye they hadde not one pledge.

When King Edwarde came to Douer the Duke of Burgoigne to helpe his passage, sent.
boates of Hollande, and Seland, called Cuttes, whiche are flatte and lowe, builte verye commodiously for transporting of horsses, but notwithstanding all thys helpe they hadde from the Duke, and all the Kyng of Englande coulde commaunde hymselfe: hée was aboue thrée wéekes in passing betwéene Douer and Caleis, one shippe of Ewe tooke two or thrée of his small passengers, before Kyng Edwarde embarqued, hée sente from Douer to the Kyng of Fraunce, one Heralte alone called Gartera Norman borne, who broughte a letter of defiaunce from the King of Englande, in verye good language and so excellently well penned, that myne Aucthour was perswaded it was neuer Englishe mans doyng.
The contentes whereof were, that the Kyng shoulde yéelde vnto hym the Realme of Fraunce, beyng hys inheritaunce, to the ende he might restore the Cleargye and Nobilitie to theyr auntient libertye, ease them of the greate charges they sustayned and deliuer them of the miseries they were in, whyche if hée refused to doe, he protested what greate mischiefe shoulde ensue thereof, in manner and forme as in suche cases is accustomed.
The Kyng read the letter softlye to himselfe, and afterwarde all alone withdrewe hymselfe into a wardrobe, and commaunded the Heralte to be brought to hyepresence, to whom hée made thys aunswere.
Fyrst that he knewe well that the King of Englande had not passed the seas of hys owne frée motion, but by the perswasion of the Duke of Burgondie, and the comminaltie of England.
Secondelye that the Sommer was nowe almoste paste, and that the Du of Burgoigne, was returned from Nunz, as a man discomifited and vtterlye vnfurnished of all things.
Thirdlye as touching the Conestable (of Fraunce he knew wel (he sayde) yt the intelligence wyth ye K. of England, bycause he hadde married hys niece: but would deceyue the Kyng his Mayster as he him, notwithstandyng all the great benefits that he had receiued of him, which he that rehearsed, adding therevnto that the saide Conestable ment to liue in continuall dissimulation, and entertaine euerye man to make his profit of him.
Last of all he alleaged to the Heralte diuerse reasons to perswade the Kyng hys Mastor to peace, and gaue hym with hys owne hand.
more if the peace were· co~cluded: further ope~ly he gaue him for a present a goodly péece of Crimson Ueluet of thyrtie Elles.

The Kyng of Englande departed from Caleis in companye of the Duke and passed through Bolloigne, and from thence marched to Peronne where the Duke gaue the Englishe men but colde entertaynemente, for he caused the Gates to bée streightly kepte, and woulde suffer but fewe to enter, so that the greatest parte of them lodged in the fieldes.
After they were come to Peronne the Conestable of France se~t to ye Duke of Burgoigndie one of his seruants, by whom hée used himselfe for the wythholdyng of S. Quintins, alleaging that if hée had restored it he could haue stoode hym in in the Realme of Fraunce, for he shoulde vtterly haue loste hys credite and intelligence, but nowe séeyng the Kyng of Englande was come ouer in person, he promysed to doe hereafter all that the Duke shoulde commaunde hym, whereof the better to assure hym, hée sente hym a letter of credite to the declaration of the Duke.
Further hée gaue the Duke hys Faythe in wryting, to serue and sucure hym, hys friendes and confederates, as well the King of Englande as others, against all men none excepted.
The Duke deliuered the Kyng of Englande hys letter, and all the matter of credite, adding somewhat thereto of hys owne heade: for he assured the King, that the Conestable woulde deliuer into his handes both Saint Quintines, and all his other places, whiche the Kyng easilye beléeued, partly bycause hée hadde marryed the Conestables and partlye bycause hée sawe hym in so greate feare of the Kyng of Fraunce, that hée thoughte hée durste not fayle hys promise made to the Duke and hym: and the Duke beléeued also.
But the Conestable meante nothing lesse, for the feare he was in of the Frenche Kyng was not so greate that it coulde force hym thus but he vsed his dissimulation.
The King of Englande reioycyng at thys message sente by the Conestable, departed from wyth the Duke of Burgoigne, towarde Saint Quintins, wherevnto when hée approched, a greate bande of Englishe menne ranne before, thynkyng that the belles shoulde haue bene rong at theyr commyng, and that the Citizens woulde haue receyued them wyth Crosse and Holye Water, but when they drewe néere to the Towne, the Artille shotte, and the ed for the he she bothe on backe and on foote, so that two or three Englishe menne were slayne, and some taken and in thys state returned they in great rage to theyr Campe, againste the Conestable.

Secondly he excused himselfe, for the receiuing in times paste the Earle of Warwicke into his Dominions, saying, that hée dyd it agaynste the Duke of Burgoigne and not him.
Further, he declared that the sayd Duke of Burgoigne had for none other cause called hym into Fraunce, but that by the occasion of hys comming, hée mighte conclude a peace for hymselfe wyth the Kyng: And if happily anye other furthered the matter, it was onely to amende the broken estate of theyr owne affaires, and for their owne priuate commoditie: but as touching the Kyng of Englandes good successe, they were altogither carelesse thereof.
Hée putte hym also in mynde of the tyme of the yeare, alleaging that Winter approched, likewise the great charges he sustained.
Lastlye he sayde, that notwithstanding a great number in Englande desyred Warre with Fraunce, yet if the Kyng Englande inclyne to peace, the Kyng for hys parte would condescende to suche conditions as he doubted not but hée and hys Realme woulde allowe of: finally he demaunded a conduite for certaine Ambassadours, to come well enformed of his maisters pleasure.
The King of England and part of his Nobles liking these ouertures very well, graunted to the Harrault of Fraunce as large a safe conducte as he demaunded, and gaue him foure Nobles of golde in rewarde.

Which fauour and affection, yet after his decesse by the crueltie, mischiefe, and trouble of the tempestuous world that followed, highly toward him more increased.
At such time as he dyed, the displeasure of those that bare him grudge, for King Henries sake the sixt, whom he deposed, was well asswaged, and in effect quenched, in that, that many of them were deade in more than twentie yeares of his raigne, a great parte of a long life: And many of them in the meane season growne into his fauour, of which he was neuer straunge.
He was a goodly personage, Princely to beholde, of harte couragious, pollitique in counsell in aduersitie nothing abashed, in prosperitie rather ioyfull than proude, in peace iust and mercifull, in warre sharpe and fierce, in the fielde bolde and hardie, and nathelesse no further than wisedome would aduenturous, whose warres who so well consider, he shall no lesse commende his wisedome where he voyded, than his manhoode where he vanquished.
He was of visage louely, of body mightie, strong, and cleane made: Howbeit in his latter dayes with ouer liberall dyet, somewhat corpulent and boorely, and nathelesse not comely; he was of youth greatly giuen to wantonnesse: from which health of body in great prosperitie and fortune, without a speciall grace hardly refraineth.
This faulte not greatly gréeued the people: for neyther could any one mans pleasure, stretch and extend to the displeasure of very many, and was without violence, and ouer that in his latter dayes lessed and well left.
In which time of his latter dayes, this Realme was in quiet and prosperous estate, no feare of outward enimies, no warre in hand, nor none toward, but such as no man looked for: the people toward the Prince, not in a constrained feare, but in a willing and louing obedience: among themselues, the co~mons in good peace.
The Lordes whom he knewe at variaunce, himselfe in his death bed appeased: he had lefte all gathering of money (which is the onely thing that withdraweth the hartes of Englishmen from the Prince) nor any thing intended he to take in hande, by which he shoulde be driuen thereto for: his tribute out of Fraunce he had before obtayned: and the yéere foregoing his death, he had obtained Barwike.
And albeit that all the time of his raigne he was with his people, so benigne, courteous, and so familiar, that no part of his vertues was more estéemed: yet the condition, in the ende of his dayes (in which many Princes by a long continued soueraintie, decline into a proude porte fro~ debonair behauiour of their beginning) maruellouslye in him grew increased: so farre forth, that in Sommer the last y^ euer he sawe, his highnesse being at Windsor in hunting, sent for the Maior and Aldermen of London, to him for none other errand, but to haue them hunt be merie with him, where he made them not so stately, but so friendly and so familiar theare, and sent venison fro~ thence so fréely into the Citie, that no one thing in many dayes before, gat him either heartes or more heartie fauour amongest the common people, whiche oftentimes more estéeme and take for greater kindnesse, a little courtesie, than a great benefite.
So deceassed (as haue sayd) this noble King, in that time, in which his lyfe was most desired.
Whose loue of his people, and their entire affection towarde him, had béene to his noble children, (hauing in themselues also as many giftes of nature, as many Princely vertues, as much goodly towardnesse as their age could receiue) a maruellous fortresse and sure armour, if diuision dissention of their friends had not vnarmed them, left them destitute, the execrable desire of soueraintie prouoked him to their destruction, which if either kind or kindnesse had holden place, must néedes haue bene their chiefe defence.
For Richard the duke of Glocester, by nature their vncle, by office their Protector, to their father beholde~, to themselues by othe allegiaunce bounden, all bandes broken that binden man man togither, without any respect of God or the world, vnnaturally contriued to bereue them, not only their dignitie, but also their lyues.
But for as much as this Dukes demeanor ministreth in effect all the whole matter whereof this booke shal intreate, it is therfore conuenient, somewhat to shew you ere we farther goe, what manner of man this was, that could finde in his heart so much mischiefe to conceiue.
Richard Duke of Yorke· a noble man a mightie, began not by warre, but by law so chalenge the Crowne, putting hys claime into the Parliament, where his cause was eyther for right or fauour so farre forth auaunced, that Kyng Henry his bloud (albeit he had a goodly Prince) vtterly reiected, the Crowne was by aucthoritie of Parliamente entailed vnto the Duke of Yorke and his issue male in remainder, immediatly after the death of King Henrie.
But ye duke not enduring so long to tarrie, but intending vnder pretext of dissention and debate arising in the Realme, to preuent his time, and to take vpon him the rule in King Henrie his life, was with many nobles of the Realme at Wakefielde slaine, leauing thrée sonnes, Edward, George and Richard.
All thrée as they were great states of birthe, so were they great and stately of stomack, gréedie ambitious of aucthoritie, and impatient of partners.
Edwarde reuenging his fathers death, depriued· King Henrie, attained ye Crowne· George Duke of Clarence, was a goodly noble Prince and at al points fortunate, if either his owne ambition had not set him against his brother, or the enuie of his enimies his brother against hym.
For were it by the Quéene and Lords of hir bloud which highly maligned the Kings kinred (as women commonly not of malice, but of nature hate them who~ their husbandes loue,) or were it a proude appetite of the Duke hymselfe, intending to be King: at the least wise heinous treaso~ was there laid to his charge, and finally, were he faultie, were he faultlesse, attaynted was he by Parliament, and iudged to the death, and therevpon hastily drowned in a butte of Malmesey, whose death King Edward (albeit he commaunded it) when he wyst it was done, piteously bewayled and sorowfully repented.
Richarde the thirde sonne, of whom wée nowe intreate, was in wit and courage egall with either of them, in body prowes farre vnder them both, little of stature, yll featured of limmes, crooke backed, his left shoulder much hygher than his right, hard fauoured of visage, such as is in states called warlye, in other men otherwise: he was malicious, wrathfull, enuious, from afore his byrth euer froward.
It is for truth reported, that the Dutches his mother had so much a doe in hir trauaile, yt she coulde not be deliuered of him vncut, that he came into the world with the féete forward, as me~ be borne outward, (as ye fame runneth) also not vntoothed, whether me~ of hatred report aboue ye truth, or else y^ nature chau~ged hir course in his beginning, which in the course of his life many things vnnaturally committed.
None euil captaine was he in ye warre, as to which his dispotio~ was more méetely tha~ for peace.
Sundry victories had he, somtimes ouerthrows, but neuer in default as for his own person, either of hardines or politike order: frée was he called of dispence, somewhat aboue his power liberall: wt large giftes he gat him vnstedfast friendship, for which he was faine to pill spoile in other places, get him stedfast hatred.
He was close secrete, a déepe dissimuler, lowly of countenaunce, arrogant of heart, outwardlye coumpinable where he inwardlye hated, not letting to kisse whom hée thought to kill: dispiteous cruell, not for euill wil alway, but ofter for ambition, either for the fuertie or increase of his estate.
Friend foe was much what indifferent, where his aduauntage grewe, he spared no mans death, whose life wythstoode his purpose.
He slewe with his owne handes King Henry the sixt, being prisoner in the Tower, as men constantly said, that without commaundement or knowledge of the King, which would vndoubtedly, if he had intended that thing, haue appointed that butcherly office to some other, than his owne borne brother.
Some wise men also wéen, that his drift couertly conueyed, lacked not in helping forth his brother of Clarence to his death: which he resisted openly, howbeit somewhat (as men déemed) more faintly, than he that were hartily mynded to his wealth.
And they y^ thus déeme, thinke that he long time in K. Edwardes lyfe, forethought to be King, in case that the King his brother (whose life he looked that euill diet should shorten) should happen to deceasse (as in déede he did) while his children were yong.
And they déeme, that for this intent he was glad of his brothers death ye Duke of Clarence, whose life must néedes haue hindered him so intending, whether the same duke of Clarence had kept him true to his Nephew the yong King, or enterprised to be King himselfe.
But of al this poynt, is there no certaintie, and who so deuineth vpon coniectures, may aswell shoote to farre as to short.
Howbeit this haue by credible information learned, that the selfe night, in which King Edward dyed, one Mistlebrooke long ere morning, came in great hast to the house of one Pottier dwelling in Redcrosse streete without Creplegate in Loxdon: and when he was with hastie rapping quicklye letten in, he shewed vnto Pottier that King Edwarde was departed.
By my truth man quoth Pottier, then will my Maister the Duke of Glocester be King.
What cause he had so to thinke harde it is to say, whether he being toward him, any thing knewe that he had such thing purposed, or otherwise had any inkeling thereof: for he was not likely to speake it of nought.
But now to returne to the course of this historie.
Were it that the Duke of Gloucester hadde of olde foreminded this conclusion, and was nowe at erste therevnto moued, and putte in hope by the occasion of the tender age of the yong Princes, his Nephewes, (as oportunitie and likelihoode of spéede, putteth a man in courage of that he neuer intended) certaine is it, that he contriued their destruction, with the vsurpation of the regall dignitie vpon himselfe.
And, forasmuche as, he well wiste, and holpe to maintaine, a long continued grudge and betwene the Quéenes kinred, and the Kings bloude, either partie enuying others aucthoritie, he nowe thought their diuision shoulde be (as it was indéede) a furtherly beginning to the pursuit of hys intent, and a sure ground for the foundation of al his building, if he might firste, vnder the pretexte of reuenging old displeasure, abuse the anger and ignorance of the one partie, to the destruction of the other, and then winne to hys purpose as many as he coulde, and those that could not bée wonne, myght be lost ere they looked therefore: For of one thing was he certayne, that if hys intent were perceyued, he should soone haue made peace betwéene the both parties with his owne bloud.
King Edwarde in his life, albeit that this dissention betwéene his friendes somewhat irked him: yet in his good health he somewhat the lesse regarded it, bicause he thought whatsoeuer businesse shoulde fall betwéene them, himselfe should alway be able to rule both the parties.
But in his last sicknesse, whe~ he perceiued his naturall strength so sore enféebled, that he dispaired al recouerie, then he considering the youth of his children, albeit he nothing lesse mistrusted than that that happened, yet well foreséeing that many harmes might growe by their debate, while the youthe of his children should lacke discretion of themselues, good counsell of their friendes, of which either partie should counsell for their owne commoditie rather by pleasaunt aduise to wyn themselues fauour, than by profitable aduertisement to doo their children good, he called some of them before him that were at variaunce, and in especiall the Lord Marques Dorset the Quéenes sonne by hir first husbande, William the Lord Hastings a noble man then Lord Chamberlaine, againe who~ the Quéene specially grudged, for the great fauour the King bare him: also for that the thought him secretly familiar with the King in wanto~ company.
Hir kinred also bare him sore, aswell for that y^
King had made· him Captaine of Calleis, which office the Lord Riuers brother to y^
Quéene claimed of y^ kings former promise, as for diuers other great gifts which he receiued, y^ they looked for.
When these Lords with diuers of both the parties were come in presence, the King lifting vp himselfe vnderset with pyllows, as it is reported, on this wise saide vnto them.
My Lordes, my deare alies, in what plight lie you sée, By which the lesse while looke to lo liue with you, the more déepely am moued to care in what case leaue you, for such as leaue you, such be my childre~ like to finde you.
Which if they should (that God forbid) finde you at variaunce, might hap to fall the~selues at warre, ere their discretion would serue to set you at peace: ye sée their youth, of which recken y^ onely suertie to rest in your concorde.
For it suffiseth not y^ all you loue them, if eche of you hate other.
If they were me~, your faithfulnes happily would suffise: but childhood must be maintained by mens aucthority, slipper youth vnderpropped wt elder cou~sel, which neither they ca~ haue, but ye giue it· nor ye giue it, if ye grée not.
For where eche laboureth to breake that the other maketh, and for hatred of eche of others person, impugneth eche others cou~sell, there must it néedes be long ere any good conclusion go forward.
And also while either party laboreth to be chief, flatterie shal haue more place tha~ plaine faithfull aduise, of which must néedes insue ye euil bringing vp of y^
Prince, whose minde in te~der youth infect, shal redily fal to mischief riot, draw downe with his noble Realme to ruine, but if grace turne him to wisdome: which if God send, then they y^ by euil meanes before pleased him best, shal after fal furthest out of fauour, so y^ euer at length euil drifts draw to nought and good plaine wayes prosper.
Great variaunce hath there long bene betwéene you, not alway for great causes.
Sometime a thing right wel intended, our misconstructio~ turneth vnto worse, or a small displeasure done vs, either our owne affectio~ or euil tongues agréeueth.
But this wot well, ye neuer had so great cause of hatred, as ye haue of loue.
That we be al men, that we be Christen me~, this shal leaue for preachers to tell you (& yet wot neare whether any preachers words ought more to moue you, tha~ his that is by and by going to the place that they al preache of.)
But this shal desire you to reme~ber, y^ the one part of you is of my bloud the other of mine alies, ech of you with other either of kinred or affinitie, which spiritual kinred of affinitie, if the Sacramentes of Christes Church beare that weight with vs, y^ would God they did, should no lesse moue vs to charitie, than ye respect of fleshly consanguinitie.
Our Lord forbid, y^ you loue togither ye worse for the selfe cause ye you ought to loue ye better.
And yet y^ happeneth, no where finde we so deadly debate, as among the~, which by nature lawe most ought to agrée togither.
Such a pestilent Serpent is ambitio~, desire of vaine glory soueraintie, which amo~g states where he once entreth, créepeth forth so farre, til wt deuision variaunce he turneth all to mischiefe, first longing to be next the best, afterward egall with the best, at last chiefe aboue y^ best.
Of which immoderate appetite of worship, thereby of debate dissentio~, what losse, what sorowe, what trouble hath wt in these few yéeres grown in this Realme, pray God aswel forget, as we wel reme~ber.
Which things if could aswel haue foreséen, as haue wt my more paine the~ pleasure proued, by godes blessed Lady (y^ was euer his othe) would neuer haue won y^ courtesie of mens knées, wt y^ losse of so many heads.
But sithen things passed cannot be gainecalled, much ought we the more beware, by what occasion we haue taken so great hurt afore, that we eft soones fall not in that occasion againe.
Now be those griefs passed, and all is (God be thanked quiet) likely right well to prosper in wealthfull peare vnder your cousins my children, if God send them life and you loue.
Of which two things, the lesse losse were they, by whom though God did his pleasure, yet should the Realme alway finde Kings, and peraduenture as good Kings.
But if you among your selues in a childes raigne fall at debate, many a good man shall perish, and haply he to and ye to, ere this land finde peace againe.
Wherfore in these last wordes that euer looke to speake with you, exhorte you and require you all, for the loue that you haue euer borne to mée: for the loue that haue euer borne vnto you: for the loue that our Lord beareth to vs all, from this time forward all griefes forgotten, eche of you loue other.
Which verely trust you will, if ye any thing earthly regarde, eyther God or your King, affinitie or kinred, this Realme your owne countrey, or your owne suertie.
And therewithall the King no longer induring to sit vp, laid him downe on his ryghte side, his face toward them: and none was there present that could refraine from wéeping.
But the Lordes recomforting him with as good wordes as they could, and answering for the time as they thought to stand with his pleasure, there in his presence, as by theyr wordes appeared, eche forgaue other, and ioyned their handes together, when (as it after appeared by their déedes) their hartes were farre a sunder.
As soone as the King was departed, the noble Prince his sonne drew toward London, which at the time of his deceasse kept his housholde at Ludlowe in Wales, which countrey béeing farre off from the lawe and recourse to Justice, was begon to be farre out of good will, and waxen wylde robbers and reuers; walking at libertie vncorrected.
And for this encheason the Prince was in the life of his father sent thither, to y^ eude y^ the of his presence, shoulde refraine euill disposed persons fro the boldenesse of their former outrages.
To the gouernaunce and orderyng of this yo~g prince at his sending thither, was there appointed sir Anthonie Lorde Riuers, and brother vnto the Quéene, a right honorable man, as valiant of hande as politike in Counsell.
Adioyned were there vnto him other of the same partie, and in effect euery one as he was nearest of kinne vnto the Quéene, so was planted nexte aboute the Prince.
That drifte by the Quéene not vnwisely deuised, wherby hir bloude might of youth be rooted in the Princes fauor, the Duke of Glocester tourned vnto theyr destruction, and vpon that grounde sette the foundation of all his vnhappye building.
For, whom soeuer he perceyued eyther at variaunce with them, or bearing himselfe their fauour, he brake vnto them, some by mouth, some by writing and secret messengers, that it was neyther reason nor in any wise to bée suffered, that the yong King theyr Maister and kinsman, shoulde be in the handes and custodie of his mothers kinred, sequestered in maner from theyr companye· and attendaunce, of whiche euerye one ought him as faithful seruice as they, and many of them farre more honorable parte of kinne than hys mothers side.
Whose bloud (quoth he) sauing the Kings pleasure, was full vnméetelye to be matched with hys: whiche nowe to be as who saye remoued fro~ the King, and the lesse noble to be left about him, is (quoth he) neyther honorable to his maiestie nor vnto vs, and also to hys grace no suretie, to haue the mightiest of his friends from him, and vnto vs no little ieopardie, to suffer oure well proued euill willers to growe in ouer great auctority wyth the Prince in youth, namely which is light of beliefe and soone perswaded.
Yée remember trowe King Edward himselfe, albeit he was a manne of age and discretion, yet was hée in manye things ruled by the bende, more than stoode eyther wyth hys honour, or our profitte, or with the commoditie of any man else, excepte onely the immoderate aduancemente of themselues.
Which whether they sort after their owne weale, or our wo, it were harde wene to gesse.
And if some folkes friendship had not holden better place with the King, than any respect of kinred, they might peraduenture easilye haue betrapped and brought to confusion some of vs ere this.
Why not as easilye as they haue done some other alreadye, as néere of his royall bloude as wée? But our Lorde hath wrought his will, and thankes be to his grace that peril is past.
Howbeit as great is growing, if we suffer this yo~g king in our enemies ha~d, which without his witting might abuse the name of hys commaundement, to any of our vndoing, which thing God and good prouision forbidde.
Of whiche good prouision none of vs hath any thing the lesse néede, for the late made attonement, in which y^
Nor none of vs, beléeue, is so vnwise, ouersoone to truste a newe friend made of an old foe, or to thinke that an hourely kindenes, sodainly contracte in one houre, continued yet skant a fortnight, should be déeper settled in their stomacke, than a long accustomed malice manye yeares rooted.
With these wordes and writings and suche other, the Duke of Glocester soone set a fire them that were of themselues eathe to kindle, and in especial twayne, Edwarde Duke of and Wiliam Lord Hastings and Chamberlain, both men of honour and of great power.
The tone by long succession from his auncestrie: the tother by his office, and the Kings fauour.
These two not beryng eache to other so muche lone as hatred, both vnto the Quéenes parte, in this point accorded togither wyth the Duke of Glocester, that they would vtterly amoue from the Kings company all hys mothers friendes, vnder the name of theyr enimies.
Uppon this concluded, the Duke of Gloucester vnderstanding, that the Lordes whyche at that time were about the King, intended to bring him vp to his coronation, accompanied with suche power of their friends, that it should be harde for him to bring his purpose to passe, without the gathering a greate assemble of people, and in manner of open warre, whereof the ende he wiste was doubtfull, and in whiche the King being on their side, his part should haue the face and name of a rebellion: he secretly therfore, by diners meanes caused the Quéene to be perswaded and broughte in the minde, that it neyther were néede, and also shoulde be ieopardous, the King to come vppe strong.
For, whereas nowe euerye Lorde loued other, and none other thing studyed vppon, but aboute the Coronation and honor of the King: if the Lordes of hir kyndred shoulde assemble in the Kings name muche people, they shoulde giue the Lordes at wixte whom and them hadde bin sometime debate, to feare and suspect, leaste they shoulde gather this people, not for the Kings safegarde, whome no man impugned, but for their destruction, hauing more regarde to theyr olde variaunce, than their newe attonement: for which cause they should assemble on the other partie much people againe for theyr defence, whose power she wiste wel farre stretched.
And of all the hurte that thereof shoulde ensue, which was likely not to be little, and the moste harme there lyke to fall where she leaste woulde, all the worlde woulde put hyr and hyr kyndred in the wight, and saye that they hadde vnwisely and vntruely also broken the amitie peace, that the Kyng hyr so prudentlye made, betwéene his kinne and hyrs in his death bed, and which the other partie faithfully obserued.
The Quéene being in this wise perswaded, suche worde sente vnto hir sonne, and vnto hir brother béeing aboute the Kyng, and ouer that the Duke of Glocester hymselfe and other Lordes the chiefe of his bende, wrote vnto the King so reuerentlye, and to the Quéenes friendes there so louingly, that they nothing earthly mistrusting, brought the King vp in greate haste, not in good spéede, with a sober companye.
Now was the King in hys waye to London gone from Northampton, when the Dukes of Glocester and Buckingham came thither, where remained behinde the Lord Riuers the Kings vncle, intending on the morrowe to followe the King, and be with him at Stonie Stratforde, xij. myles thence, earelye or he departed.
So was there made that nighte muche friendlye cheare betwéene these two Dukes and the Lord Riuers a great whyle.
But incontinent after that they were openlye with greate curtesie departed, and the Lorde Riuers lodged, the Dukes secretely with a fewe of theyr moste priuie friendes, set them down in counsaile, wherein they spent a great parte of the nighte.
And at theyr rising in the dawning of the day, they sente out priuilye to theyr seruantes in theyr Innes and lodgings about, giuing the~ commaundement, to make the~selues shortly readie, for their Lordes were to horssebackewarde.
Uppon whyche messages, manye of theyr folke were attendaunt, when manye of the Lord Riuers seruauntes were vnreadye.
Nowe had these Dukes taken also into theyr custody the Keyes of the Inne, that none shoulde passe forth without their lice~ce.
And ouer thys, in the highe waye, towarde Stonie Stratforde, where the King laye, they hadde bestowed certaine of theyr folke, that shoulde sende backe againe, and compell to returne, anye man that were gotten out of Northampton, towarde Stonie Stratforde, tyll they shoulde giue other licence.
For as much as the Dukes the~selues inte~ded for the shew of theyr diligence, to be the firste that shoulde that daye attende vpon the Kings highnesse out of that Towne: thus bare they folke in hande.
But when the Lord Riuers vnderstoode the Gates closed, and the wayes on euery side beset, neyther his seruauntes nor himselfe suffered to goe out, perceiuing wel so great a thing without his knowledge not begun for naughte, comparing thys manner present, wyth hys last nights chéere, in so fewe houres so great a change, maruellously misliked.
Howbeit, sith he coulde not gette awaye, and kéepe himselfe close he would not, least he should séeme to hyde himself for some secrete fear of his own fault, wherof he saw no such cause in hymself.
He determined vpon the suretie of his own conscience, to go boldelie to them, and inquire what this matter mighte meane, whome as as they sawe, they beganne to quarrel with him and saye, that he intended to set distaunce betwéene the Kyng and them, and to bring them to confusion, but it should not lye in hys power.
And when he beganne (as he was a very wel spoken man) in goodly wise to excuse himselfe, they tarryed not the ende of his aunsweare, but shortly tooke hym, and put him in warde, and that done, forthwyth wente to horssebacke, and tooke the waye to Stonie Stratforde, where they founde the King wyth hys companye, readie to leape on Horssebacke, and depart forwarde to leaue that lodging for them, bycause it was to straighte for both companyes.
And as soone as they came in hys prese~ce, they light adown with all their companye about them.
To whom the Duke of Buckingham sayd, go afore Gentlemen, and yeomen kéepe your roomes.
And thus in goodly aray, they came to the King, and on theyr knées in verye humble wyse salued his grace, whiche receyued them in very ioyous and amiable maner, nothing earthlye knowing nor mistrusting as yet.
But euen by and by in his presence, they piked a quarrell to the Lorde Rycharde Gray· the Kings other brother by his mother, saying, that he with the Lorde Marques his brother, and the Lorde Riuers his Uncle, had compassed to rule the King and the Realme, and to set variance among the states, and to subdue and destroye the noble bloude of the Realme.
Toward the accomplishing whereof they sayd, that the Lorde Marques had entred into the Tower of London, and thence taken out the Kyngs Treasure, and sente menne to the Sea.
All which things these Dukes wist well, were done for good purposes and necessarie, by the whole counsaile at London, sauing that somewhat they must say.
What my brother Marques hath done cannot saye: But in good faith dare well aunsweare for mine vncle Riuers and my brother here, that they be innocent of any suche matter.
Yea my liege quoth the Duke of Buckingham, they haue kept theyr dealing in these matters farre fro the knowledge of your good grace.
And forthwyth they arested the Lord Richard and sir Th. Vaugha~ Knight, in the Kings presence, and brought the king and al back vnto Northampton, where they tooke againe further Counsell.
And there they sent away fro~ the King, who~ it pleased the~, and set new seruaunts about him, such as liked better the~ than him.
At which dealing he wept, and was nothing content, but it booted not.
And at dinner, the Duke of Glocester sente a dishe from his owne table to the Lord Riuers, praying him to be of good cheare, all should be well ynough.
And he thanked the Duke, and prayed the messenger to beare it to his nephew the Lord Richard, with the same message for hys comforte, as one to whome such aduersitie was stra~ge, but himselfe had bin all his dayes in vre therewith, therfore could beare it the better.
But for all this co~fortable curtesie of the Duke of Glocester, he sent the Lord Riuers, the Lord Richarde, with sir Thomas Vaughan into the Northe Countrey, into diuerse places to prison, and afterwarde all to Pomfraite, where they were in conclusion beheaded.
In this wise, the Duke of Glocester toke vppon hymselfe the order and gouernaunce of the yong King, whom with muche honoure and humble reuerence, hée conueyed vpward toward the Citie.
But anone, the tydings of this matter came hastily to the Quéene a little before the midnighte following, and that in the sorest wise, that the King hir son was taken, hir brother, hir sonne, and other friends arrested, and sente no man wist whether, to bée done with God wot what.
With which tydings, the Quéene in great flight and heauinesse, bewayling hir childes raigne, hir friendes mischaunce, and hir owne infortune, damning the time that euer she disswaded the gathering of power aboute the Kyng, gatte hyr selfe in all the haste possible wyth hir yo~ger Sonne and hyr daughters, out of the Pallaice of Westminster, in whiche she then laye, into the Sanctuarie, lodging hyr selfe and hyr companye there in the Abbots place.
Now came there one likewise not long after midnighte from the Lorde Chamberlayne, vnto the Archbishoppe of Yorke, then Chancellour of Englande, to his place not far fro~ Westminster.
And for that he shewed his seruauntes that hée had tydings of so great importaunce, that hys maister gaue him in charge, not to forbeare his reste, they letted not to wake him, nor he to admitte this messenger into his bedde side.
Of whome he hearde that these Dukes were gone backe wyth the Kings grace from Stonie Stratforde vnto Northampton.
Notwythstanding Syr (quoth he) my Lorde sendeth your Lordshippe worde, that there is no feare: for he assureth you that all shall be well.
assure him quoth the Archebishoppe, be it as well as it will, it wyll neuer be so well as we haue séene it: And therevpon, by and by after the messenger departed, he caused in all the haste all his sernauntes to be called vp, and so with his owne housholde about him, and euerye man weaponed, he tooke the greate seale with him, and came yet before daye vnto the Quéene.
About whom he founde much heauinesse, rumble, hast and businesse, cariage and conueyaunce of hyr stuffe into Sanctuarie, chestes, coffers, packes, fardels, trussed all on mens backes, no man vnoccupied, some lading, some going, some discharging, some comming for more, some breaking down the walles to bring in the next way, and some yet drewe to them to helpe to carry a wrong way.
The Quéene hir selfe sate alone alowe on the rushes al desolate and dismayde, whome the Archebishoppe comforted in the beste manner he coulde, shewing hir that he trusted, the matter was nothing so sore as she toke it for, and that he was putte in good hope and out of feare by ye message sent him from the Lord Chamberlaine: Ah wo worth hym (quoth she) for he is one of them that laboureth to destroye me and my bloud.
Madam (quoth he) be yée of good chéere, for assure you, if they Crowne any other King than your son, whom they nowe haue with them, we shall on the morrowe Crowne hys brother, whom you haue here with you.
And here is the greate seale, whyche in likewise as that noble Prince your husbande deliuered it vnto me, so héere deliuer it vnto you, to the vse and behoofe of your sonne, and therewith he betooke hir the greate seale, and departed home againe, yet in the dawning of the daye.
By whiche time, he mighte in his chamber windowe, sée all the Thamis full of boates of the Duke of Glocesters seruauntes, watching that no man shoulde go to Sanctuarie, nor none could passe vnsearched.
Then was there great commotion and murmur, as well in other places about, as specially in the Citie, the people diuersly diuining vpo~ this deling.
And some Lords, Knightes, and Gentlemen, eyther for fauour of the Quéen, or for feare of themselues, assembled in sundry companies, and wente flockmeale in harneys: and manye also, for that they reckoned thys demeanour attempted, not so speciallye against the other Lords, as against the King himselfe in the disturbaunce of his Coronation.
But then by and by the Lordes assembled togither, towarde whiche méeting, the Archbishoppe of Yorke fearing that it woulde be ascribed (as it was indéede) to his ouermuch lightnesse, that he so suddainely hadde yéelded vppe the greate seale to the Quéene to whom the custodie thereof nothing perteyned, wythout speciall commaundement of the King secretely sent for the seale againe, and brought it with him after the customable manner.
And at this méeting, the Lorde Hasting, whose trouth toward ye king, no man doubted nor néeded to doubt, perswaded the Lordes to beléeue, that the Duke of Glocester was sure and fastly faithfull to his Prince, that the Lord Riuers and Lorde Richarde, with the other Knightes, were for matters attempted by them against the Dukes of Glocester and Buckingham, put vnder arest for their suretie, not for the Kings ieopardie: and that they were also in safegarde, and there no longer shoulde remayne than till the matter were, not by the Dukes onely, but also by all the other Lords of ye Kings counsayle indifferently examyned, by other discretions ordered, and eyther iudged or appeased.
But one thing he aduised them beware, that they iudged not the matter too farre forth, ere they knew the trueth, nor turning theyr priuate grudges into the common hurte, yrking and prouoking men vnto anger, and disturbing the Kings coronation, toward which the Dukes were co~ming vp, that they might peraduenture bring the matter so farre out of ioynte, that it shoulde neuer be broughte in frame againe.
Whiche strife if it should happe, as it were lykely, to come to a fielde, though both parties were in all things equal, yet shoulde the aucthoritie be on that side where the King is himselfe.
With these perswasions of the Lord Hastings, whereof part himselfe beleeued, of parte he wist the contrarie, these commotions were somwhat appeased, but specially by that, that the Dukes of Glocester and Buckingha~ wer so néere, and came so shortly on with the king, in none other manner, with none other voyce or semblance than to his coronation, causing the fame to be blowen about, that these Lords and Knights which were taken, had contriued the destruction of the dukes of Glocester and Buckingham, and of other the noble bloud of the Realme, to the end that the~selues would alone demeane and gouern the King at their pleasure.
And for the coulourable proofe therof, such of the Dukes seruauntes as rode with the cartes of their stuffe that were taken (among which stuffe no maruel thoughe some were harneys, which at the breaking vppe of the housholde, must néedes eyther be brought awaye, or cast away) they shewed vnto the people all the wayes as they went, loe héere be the rels of harneys that these Traytours hadde priuilye conueyed in theyr carriage to destroy the noble LORDES withal.
This deuise albeit that it made the matter to wise men more vnlikely, well perceyuing that the intendours of such a purpose would rather haue hadde theyr harneys on their backes than to haue bound them vppe in barrels, yet much part of the commo~ people were therwith very wel satisfied, and sayd it were almoyse to hang them.
When the King approched néere to the Citie, Edmonde Shaa Goldsmith, then Maior, with William White, Iohn Matthew Sherifes, and al the other Aldermen in Scarlet, with fiue hundered Horsse of the Citizens in violet, receyued him reuerently at Harnesey, and ryding from thence, accompanyed him into the Citie, whiche he entred the fourth daye of Maye, the first and laste yeare of his raigne.
But the Duke of Gloucester bare hym in open sight so reuerently to the Prince, with all semblaunce of lowlinesse, that from the great obloquie in which he was so late before, he was sodainly fallen in so gret trust, ye at the counsel next asse~bled, he was made the only ma~, chose and thought most méete, to be Protector of ye King and hys Realme, so (that were it destenie, or were it follie) the Lambe was betaken to the Woolfe to kéepe.
At whych Counsayle also, the Archbyshop of Yorke, Chauncelor of Englande, whyche hadde delyuered vppe the greate Seale to the Quéene, was thereof greately reprooued, and the Seale taken from hym, and delyuered to Doctor Russell Byshoppe of Lincolne, a wise man and a good, and of muche experience, and one of the beste learned menne vndoubtedly that Englande had in hys time.
The Lorde Chamberlaine and some other kepte still theyr offices that they had before.
Nowe all were it, so that that the Protector so sore thirsted for the finishing of that he had begunne, that thought euery daye a yeare, till it were atchéeued, yet durste hée no further attempte, as long as he had but halfe hys pray in his hande: well witting, that if he deposed the one brother, all the Realme woulde fall to the other, if hée either remaynèd in Sanctuarie, or shoulde happily be shortelye conueyed to hys fathers libertie.
Wherfore, incontinent at the nexte méeting of the Lordes at the Counsaile, he proposed vnto them, that it was a hainous déede of the Quéen, and procéeding of greate malice towarde the Kyngs Counsailours, that she shoulde kéepe in Sanctuarie the Kings brother from hym, whose speciall pleasure and comforte were to haue his brother with hym.
And that by hir done to none other intente, but to bring all the Lordes in obloquie, and murmure of the people.
As thoughe they were not to be trusted with the Kings brother, that by the assente of the Nobles of the lande, were appointed as the Kings nearest friendes, to the tuition of hys owne royall person.
The prosperitie whereof standeth (quoth he) not all in kéeping from enimies, or ill vyande, but partly also in recreation, and moderate pleasure, whiche he cannot in hys tenuer youth, take in the companye of auncient persons, but in the familiar conuersation of those that be neither far vnder, nor farre aboue his age, and naythelesse of estate conuenient to accompanye hys noble Maiestie, wherefore, with whome rather, than wyth hys owne brother? And if anye man thinke this consideration (whyche thinke no manne thinketh that loueth the King) let him consider, that sometyme wythout small things, greater cannot stande.
And verilye, it redoundeth greatlye to the dishonour both of the Kings hyghnesse, and of all vs that bene aboute his grace, to haue it runne in euerye mans mouth, not in this realme only, but also in other lands (as euil words walke far) ye the kings brother shold be fain to kepe Sa~ctuary.
For euery ma~ wil wéene, ye no ma~ wil so do for nought.
And such euil opinio~ once fastned in mens hearts, hard it is to wraste out, may grow to more grief tha~ any ma~ can here deuine.
Wherfore me thinketh it were not worst to send vnto y^
Q. for the redresse of this matter, some honorable trustie man, suche as both tendereth the Kyngs weale, and the honoure of hys counsayle, and is also in fauour and credence wyth hyr.
For all which considerations, none séemeth me more méetely, than our reuerende Father héere present, my Lord Cardinall, who maye in this matter doe most good of any man, if it please him to take the payne, which doubt not of hys goodnesse he will not refuse for the Kings sake and ours, and wealth of the yong Duke himself, the kings most honorable brother, and after my soueraigne Lord himselfe, my most déere nephew, considered that thereby shal be ceassed the slaunderous rumor and obloquie nowe going, and the hurtes that thereof mighte ensue, and muche reste and quiet growe to all the Realme.
And if she be percase so obstinate, and so precisely set vpon hir own wil, that neyther his wise and faithful aduertisement, can not moue hir, nor anye mannes reason contente hir: then shall we by mine aduise, by the Kings authoritie, fetche him out of that prison, and bring hym to hys noble presence, in whose continuall companye he shall be so well chéerished, and so honorablye intreated, that al the world shal to our honor and hir reproche perceyue, that it was onely malice, frowardenesse, or follie, that caused hir to kéepe him there: this is my minde in this matter for this time, except any of your Lordshippes any thing perceiue to the contrarie, for neuer shall by Gods grace so wedde my selfe to mine owne wil, but that shal be readie to change it vpon your better aduises.
When the Protectoure hadde sayde, all the Counsayle affirmed, that the motion was good and reasonable, and to the King and the Duke his brother, honorable, and a thing that should cease greate murmure in the Realme, if the mother mighte be by good meanes enduced to deliuer him.
Which thing the Archbishop of Yorke, whom they all agréed also to be thereto most conuenient, tooke vpon him to moue hir, and therin to doe his vttermost deuoire.
Howbeit, if she coulde be in no wise intreated with hyr good will to· deliuer him, then thought he, and such other as were of the Spiritualtie present, that it were not in any wise to be attempted to take him out against hir wil.
For it would be a thing that shoulde turne to the greate grudge of all men, and high displeasure of God, if the priuiledge of that holye place shoulde nowe be broken, whiche had so many yeares bene kepte, which both Kings and Popes so good had gra~ted, so many hadde confirmed, and which holy ground was more than fiue hundred yeares agoe by Saint Peter in hys owne person in spirite accompanyed wyth great multitude of Angels by night so speciallye hallowed, and dedicate to God (for the proofe whereof, they haue yet in the Abbay S. Peters Cope to shewe) that from that time hitherward, was ther neuer so vndeuoute a king, that durst that sacred place violate, or so holy a Byshop, that durst it presume to consecrate.
And therefore (quoth the Archbishop of Yorke God forbid that any man should for any thing earthly enterprise to breake the immunitie and libertie of the sacred Sanctuarie, that hath bene the safegard of so many a good mannes life· And trust (quoth he) with Gods grace, we shall not néede it.
But for any manner néede, woulde not we shold doe it.
trust that she shall be wyth reason contented, and all things in good manner obtayned.
And if it happen that bring it not so to passe, yet shal toward it so far forth do my best, that ye shal al wel perceiue, that no lacke of my denoire, but the mothers dreade and womanishe feare, shall be the lette.
Womanishe feare, nay womanishe frowardenesse (quoth the Duke of Buckingham, for dare take it vpon my soule, she wel knoweth she néedeth no such thing to feare, eyther for hir sonne or for hir selfe.
For as for hyr, héere is no man that wil be at warre with women.
Would God some of the men of hir kinne, were women too, and then shoulde all be soone in reste.
Howebeit, there is none of hyr kynne the lesse loued, for that they be hyr kinne, but for their owne euil deseruing.
And nathelesse, if we loued neither hyr nor hir kinne, yet were there no cause to think that we shoulde hate the kings noble brother, to whose Grace, we ourselues be of kinne: whose honour, if she as muche desired, as our dishonour, and as muche regarde tooke to his wealth, as to hir owne will, shée woulde be as loath to suffer him from the king as any of vs be.
For, if she haue witte, (as woulde God shée had as good will as she hathe de witte) she reckneth hir selfe no wiser, than shée thinketh some that be here, of whose faithfull minde shée nothing doubteth, but verily beléeueth and knoweth, that they woulde be as sorie of hys harme, as hir selfe, and yet woulde haue hym from hir, if she byde there: And we all (I thinke) content, that both be with hir, if she come thence, and byde in suche place, where they maye with their honor be.
Now the~, if she refuse in the deliuera~ce of him, to follow y^ cou~saile of the~, whose wisdome she knoweth, whose truth she wel trusteth: it is ethe to perceiue, y^ frowardnes letteth hir, not feare.
But go to, suppose y^ she feare (as who may let hir to fear hir own shadow) the more she feareth to dely·ner hym, the more ought we feare to leaue him in hir ha~ds.
For, if she caste suche fonde doubts, that she feare hys hurte: then wil she feare, that he shal be fetcht thence.
For· she wyll soone thinke, that if men were set (which God forbid) vpon so great a mischief, the Sanctuarie woulde little lette them: whiche good men myghte (as me thinketh) without sinne, somewhat lesse regarde than they doe. Nowe then, if shée doubte, leaste hée mighte be fetched from hir, is it not likely ynough that she shall sende hym some where out of the Realme? Uerily, looke for none other.
And doubte not, but she now as sore mindeth it, as we the lette thereof.
And if she might happen to bring that to passe, (as it were no great maistrie, we letting hir alone) all the world would say, that we were a wise sorte of Counfailours aboute a King, that let his brother be caste awaye vnder our noses.
And therfore, ensure you faithfully for my minde, wil rather maugre hir mind, fetch him away, than leaue him there, till hir frowardnesse and fonde feare conuey him away.
For verily, sith y^ priuiledges of that place other like, haue bin of long continued, am not hée y^ would be about to breake them.
And in good fayth, if they wer now to begin, would not be he that shoulde be about to make them.
Yet will not saye naye, but that it is a déede of pitie, that such men as the sea, or their euil dettours haue brought in pouertie, shold haue some place of libertie, to kéepe theyr bodies out of the daunger of their cruel creditours.
And also, if the Crown happen (as it hath done) to come in question, whyle eyther parte taketh other as Traytors, wil wel there be some places of refuge for both.
But as for théeues, of whiche, these places be full, and which neuer fall from the crafte, after they once fall therto, it is pitie the Sanctuarie shoulde serue them.
And muche more, manquellers, whom God bad to take from the Aulter and kil them, if their murther were wilful.
And wher it is otherwise, there néede we not the Sanctuaries y^
For if eyther necessitie, his own defence, or misfortune draweth him to that déede, a pardon serueth, whych eyther the lawe graunteth of course, or the King of pitie may.
Then looke me now how few Sanctuarie men there be, whome anye fauourable necessitie compelled to goe thyther: And then sée on the tother side, what a sort, there be co~monly therin of the~, who~ wilful vnthriftinesse hath brought to naught.
What a rabble of théeues, murtherers, and malitious heynous Traytours, and that in two places specially.
The tone at the elbowe of the Citie, the tother in the very bowels.
dare well auowe it, weye the good that they doe, wyth the hurte that commeth of them, and yée shall finde it much better to lacke both, than haue both.
And thys saye, althoughe they were not abused as they nowe bée, and so long haue bene, that feare me euer they wyll bée, whyle menne be afrayde to sette their handes to the mendmente, as though God and Saint Peter, were the patrons of vngracious liuing.
Now vnthriftes riot, and runne in debt, vpon the boldnesse of these places, yea, and rich men runne thyther with poore mens goods, there they buylde, there they spende, and bidde their creditours go whistle them.
Mens wiues runne thyther with their husbandes plate, and say, they dare not abide with their husba~ds for beating.
Théeues bring thither their stollen goods, and there liue thereon.
There deuise they newe robberies, nightlye they steale out, they robbe, and reaue, and kill, and come in agayne, as though those places gaue them not only a safegarde for the harme they haue done, but a licence also to do more.
Howbeit, much of this mischief, if wise men would set their hands to it, might be amended, with great thanks of God, and no breach of the priuiledge.
The residue, sith so long ago wote neare what Pope, and what Prince more piteous than politike, hath granted it, and other men since, of a certaine religious feare, haue not broken it, lette vs take a payne therewyth, and let it a Gods name stand in force, as farre forth as reason wil, whiche is not fully so farre forthe, as may serue to let vs of the fetching forthe of thys noble man, to hys honor and wealth, out of that place, in whych he neyther is, nor can be a Sanctuarie man.
Sanctuarie serueth alway to defende the body of that man that standeth in daunger abroade, not of greate hurte only, but also of lawful hurt· for against vnlawful harmes, neuer Pope nor King inte~ded to priuiledge any one place, for that priuiledge hath euery place: knoweth any man, any place, wherein it is lawfull one man to do an other wrong? That no man vnlawfully take hurt, that libertie, the K. the law, very nature, forbiddeth in euery place, maketh to that regarde, for euerye man euerye place a Sanctuarie.
But where a man is by lawfull meanes in peryll, there néedeth he the tuition of some speciall priuiledge, which is the onely ground and cause of all Sanctuaries: from which necessitie, this noble Prince is farre, whose loue to his King, nature and kindred proueth, whose innocencie to all the world, his tender youth proueth, and so Sanctuarie, as for him, neither none he néedeth, nor also none can haue.
Men come not to Sa~ctuarie, as they come to Baptisme, to require it by theyr Godfathers, he must aske it himself, that must haue it, and reason, sith no man hath cause to haue it, but whose conscience of his owne fault maketh him fayne, néede to require it: what will then hath yonder babe? which and if he had discretion to require it, if néede were, dare say would now be ryght angrie wyth them that kéepe hym there: and would thynke without any scruple of conscience, without any breach of priuiledge, to be somwhat more homely wyth them that be there Sanctuarie men in déede.
For if one goe to Sanctuarie with an others mans goods, why should not the King· leauing his body at libertie, satisfie the partie of his goods, euen wythin the Sanctuarie? for neyther Kyng nor Pope can gyue any place suche a priuiledge, that it shall discharge a man of hys debtes, being able to pay: and with that, dyuers of the Clergie that were present, whither they said it for his pleasure, or as they thought agréed playnely, that by the law of God and of the Church, the goods of a Sanctuarie man shoulde be deliuered in payment of hys debtes, and stollen goods to the owner, onely lybertie reserued hym to get hys liuing with the labour of hys handes, verily (quoth the Duke) thynke you say very trueth, and what if a mans wyfe will take Sanctuarie, bycause she list to runne from hir husband? woulde wéene if she could alledge none other cause, he may lawfully wythout any displeasure to Saint Peter, take hir out of Saint Peters Church by the arme.
And if no body may be taken out of Sanctuarie, that sayth he will byde there, then if a childe wyll take Sanctuarie, because he feareth to goe to Schole, hys maister must let him alone.
And as simple as that sample is, yet is there lesse reason in our case than in that, for therein, thoughe it be a chyldishe feare, yet is there, at the leastwyse some feare, and herein is there none at all.
And verily, haue often heard of Sanctuarie men, but neuer heard earst of Sanctuarie children.
And therefore, as for the conclusion of my mynde, who so may haue deserued to néede it, if they thinke it for their suertie, let them kéepe it.
But he can bée no Sanctuarie man, that neyther hath wisedome to desire it, nor malice to deserue it, whose life or libertie, can by no lawfull processe stand in ieoperdie.
And he that taketh one out of Sanctuarie to doe him good, saye playnely, that he breaketh no Sanctuarie.
When the Duke had done, the Temporall men whole, and a good part of the spiritual also, thinkyng no hurt earthly, ment toward the yong babe, condiscended in effect, that if he were not delyuered, he should be fetched.
Howbeit, they thought it all best, in the auoyding of all manner of rumor, that the Lorde Cardinall should first assay to get him with hir good will.
And therevppon, all the Counsell came vnto the Starre Chamber at Westminster, and the Lorde Cardinall, leauyng the Protector with the Counsell in the Starre Chamber, departed into the Sanctuarie to the Quéene, with dyuers other Lordes with him, were it for the respect of hys honour, or that shée should by presence of so many perceyue that thys errande was not one mans mynde: or were it, for that the Protector intended not in this matter, to trust any one man alone, or else, that if shée finally were determyned to kéepe hym, some of that companie, had happily secrete instruction incontinent, maugre hir mynde, to take him, and to leaue hir no respite to conuey him, which shée was lykely to mynde after this matter broken to hir, if hir time would in any wise serue hir.
When the Quéene, and these Lordes were come togyther in presence, the Lorde Cardinall shewed vnto hir, that it was thoughte vnto the Protector, and vnto the whole Counsell, that hir kéepyng of the Kings brother in that place, was the thing, whych highly sounded, not onely to the great rumour of the people and their obloquie, but also to the importable griefe and displeasure of the Kings royal Maiestie, to whose grace it were as singular comforte to haue hys naturall brother in companye, as it was their both dishonour, and all theyrs and hirs also, to suffer hym in Sanctuarie, as though the one brother stoode in danger and perill of the other.
And he shewed hir, that the Counsell therefore had sent hym vnto hir, to require hir the deliuerie of hym, that he myght bée broughte vnto the Kyngs presence at hys libertie, out of that place, which they reckoned as a pryson, and there shoulde he bée demeaned, accordyng to hys estate, and shée in thys doyng, shoulde both doe great good to the Realme, pleasure to the Counsell, and profite to hir selfe, succour to hyr friendes that were in distresse, and that (which he wiste wel shée specially tendred,) not onely great comforte and honour to the Kyng, but also to the young Duke hymselfe, whose both greate wealth it were to bée together, as well for many greater causes, as also for theyr both disporte, and recreation: which thyng, the Lord estéemed no though it séeme lyghte, well pondering, that theyr youth without recreation and play, cannot endure, nor any straunger, for the coniecture of their both ages and estates, so méetely in that poynt for any of them, as eyther of them for other.
My Lord (quoth the Quéene) say not nay, but y^
it were conuenient, y^ this Gentleman whom ye require were in company of the King his brother: and in good fayth, mée thynketh it were as great commoditie to them both, as for yet a while, to bein the custodie of their mother, the tender age considred of y^ elder of them both, but specially y^ yonger, which besides hys infancie, that also néedeth good looking to, hath a while béene so sore diseased, vexed with sikenesse, and is so newlye rather a little amended, than well recouered, that dare put no person earthly in trust with his kéeping, but my selfe onely, considering that there is (as Phitions say) and as we also finde, double the perill in the recidiuation, that was in the first sicknesse, with which disease, Nature beyng sore laboured, forewéeried and weakened, the lesse able to beare out and sustaine a newe surfette.
And albeit there myght be founde other that would happily doe their beste vnto hym, yet is there none that eyther knoweth better how to order hym, than that so long haue kept hym: or is more tenderly lyke to cheryshe hym, than hys owne mother that bare hym.
No man denyeth, good Madame, (quoth the Cardinall) but that your grace were of all folke most necessarie about your chyldren: so would all the Counsel not onely be content, but glad that ye were, if it myght stande wyth your pleasure to be in such place as myght stand wyth their honour.
But if you doe appoynt your selfe to tarrie héere, then thynke they it more conuenient that the Duke of Yorke were wyth the King honorably at his lybertie to the comfort of them both: than héere as a Sanctuarie man, to their both dishonour and obloquie, sith there is not alway so great necessytie to haue the Chylde to bée with the Mother: but that occasion may sometime bée such, y^
it should be more expedient to kéepe him elsewhere, which in this well appeareth, that at such time as your déerest sonne then Prince, and nowe King, shoulde for his honour, and good order of the Countrey, kéepe housholde in Wales, farre out of your company: your grace was well content there with your selfe.
Not very well content quoth the Quéen: And yet the case is not like, for the one was then in health, and the other is now sicke: In which case, maruell greatly, that my Lord Protector is so desirous to haue hym in his kéeping, where if the chyld in hys sickenesse miscarrie by nature, yet myght he runne into sclaunder and suspition of fraude.
And where they call it a thing so sore agaynst my childes honour, and theyrs also, that he bydeth in this place: it is all their honors thereto suffer him bide, where no man doubteth he shall be best kepte, and that is héere, whyle am héere, which as yet intende not to come forth, and ieoperd my selfe after other of my friendes, which would God were rather here in suertie with me, tha~ were there in ieoperdie with them.
Why Madame (quoth an other Lord) know you any thing why they should be in ieoperdie? Nay verily sir quoth shée, nor why they shoulde be in prison neyther, as they now bée.
But it is trowe, no great maruell though feare, least those that haue not letted to put them in duresse without colour, will let as little to procure theyr destruction without cause.
The Cardinal made a countenaunce to the other Lorde, that he shoulde harp no more vpon that string, then said he to the Quéene, that he nothing doubted, but that those Lordes of hir honorable kynne, which as yet remayned vnder arrest, shoulde vppon the matter examined, doe well ynough: and as towarde hir noble person, neyther was, nor coulde be anye manner ieoperdie.
Whereby shoulde trust that (quoth the Quéene) in that am gyltlesse? as though they were giltie, in that am with their enimyes better loued than they? when they hate them for my sake, in that am so of kynne to the Kyng? and howe farre they be of, if that would helpe, as God send grace it hu not, and therefore as for me, purpose not as yet, to depart hence.
And as for this Gentleman my sonne, mynde that he shall bée where am, tyll sée further: for assure you, for that sée some men so gréedie, without any substantiall cause to haue hym, this maketh me much the more fearder to delyuer him.
Truely Madame, quoth he, and the fearder that you be to deliuer him, the feader bin other men to suffer you to kéepe him, least your causelesse feare might cause you farther to conuey him: and many be there that thinke he can haue no priuiledge in this place, which neyther can haue wyll to aske it, nor malice to deserue it, and therefore, they recken no priuiledge broken, though they fetche him out, which if ye finally refuse to deliuer him, verily thinke they will.
So much dread hath my Lorde his Uncle, for the loue he beareth him, least your grace shoulde hap to send him away.
Syr (quoth the Quéene) hath the Protector so tender zeale, yt he feareth nothing but least he shoulde escape him? Thinketh he that woulde send him hence, whych neyther is in the plyght to send out, and in what place coulde recken hym sure, if he be not sure in the Sanctuarie? whereof was there neuer Tyraunt yet so diuellyshe that durst presume to breake.
And trust God is as strong now to withstand his aduersaries, as euer he was.
But my sonne can deserue no Sanctuarie, and therfore he can not haue it.
Forsooth he hath founde a goodly glose, by which that place that may defend a Théefe, may not saue an Innocent.
But he is in no ieoperdie, nor hath no néede thereof: would God he had not.
Troth the Protector (I pray God he may proue a Protector) troweth he that perceyue not where vnto hys paynted processe draweth? It is not honorable that the Duke byde here: It were comfortable for them both, that he were with his brother, bycause the King lacketh a playfellowe be ye sure.
pray God send them both better playfellowes than hym that maketh so high a matter vpon such a tryfelyng pretext: As though there coulde none be founde to play wyth the King, but if hys brother that hath no luste to play for sickenesse, come out of Sanctuarie out of his safegarde to play with him.
As though Princes as yong as they he, could not play but rth their Peeres, or children coulde not playe but with their kinred, with whom for the more part they agrée much worse than with straungers.
But the childe can not require the priuiledge: who tolde him so? He shall heare him aske it, and he will.
Howbeit this is a matter, suppose he coulde not aske it, suppose he woulde not aske it· suppose he woulde aske to goe out, if say he shall not, if aske the priuiledge but for my selfe, say he that against my will taketh him out, breaketh ye Sanctuarie.
Serueth this libertie for my person only, or for my goods to? Ye may not hence take my horse from me: may you take my child fro me? He is also my ward: for as my learned counsell sheweth mée, sithe he hath nothing by discent holden by knightes seruice, the law maketh his mother his gardaine.
Then may no man suppose take my warde from me out of Sanctuarie, without the breache of Sanctuarie.
And if my priuiledge coulde not serue him, nor he aske it for himselfe, yet sith the law committeth to me the custodie of him, may require it for him, except the law giue a childe a gardaine onely for his goods and landes, discharging him of the safekéeping of hys bodie, for which onely both landes and goods serue.
And if examples be sufficient to obtaine priuiledge for my child, néede not far to séeke.
For in this place in which now be (& which is now in questio~ whether my childe may take benefit of it) mine other sonne (now king) was borne, kept in his cradle, preserued to a more prosperous fortune, which pray God long to continue.
And as all you know, this is not the first time that haue taken Sanctuarie.
For when my Lorde my husbande was banished, and thrust out of hys Kingdome, fled hither, being great with childe, and here bare the Prince.
And when my Lorde my husband returned safe agayne, and had the victorie, then went hence to welcome him home, and from hence brought my babe the Prince vnto his father, when he first tooke him in his armes.
And pray God that my sonnes palace may be as great sauegarde vnto him nowe raigning, as this place was somtime to ye kings enimie.
In which place inte~d to kéepe his brother sith. &c. *Wherfore here intend to kéepe him, since mans law serueth ye gardaine to kéepe the infant.
The law of nature will ye mother kéepe hir child, Gods law priuiledgeth y^
Sanctuarie, the Sanctuarie my son, sith feare to put him in ye Protectors hands yt hath his brother alreadie, were (if both fayled) inheritor to ye Crowne.
The cause of my feare hath no man to doe to examine.
And yet feare no farther than ye lawe feareth, which as learned me~ tell me, forbyddeth euery ma~ the custodie of them, by whose death he may inherite lesse land than a kingdome.
can no more, but whosoeuer he be ye breaketh this holy Sactuarie, pray God shortly send him néede of Sanctuarie, when he may not come to it.
For taken out of Sanctuarie woulde not my mortall enimie were.
The Lord Cardinall perceyuing that the Quéene wared euer the longer the further off, and also that she began to kindle and chafe, and speake more byting words against the Protector, and such as he neither beléeued, was also loath to heare, he said to hir for a finall conclusion, that he woulde no longer dispute the matter, but if she were content to deliuer the Duke to him, and to the other Lordes present, he durst lay his owne body and soule both in pledge, not onely for his suertie, but also for his estate.
And if she woulde giue them a resolute answere to the contrarie, he woulde forthwith depart there with all, and shift who so would with this businesse afterwardes, for he neuer intended more to moue hir in that matter, in which she thought that he and al other also saue hirself lacked either wit or truth.
Wit, if they were so dull that they could nothing perceiue what the Protector intended: truth, if they should procure hir sonne to be delyuered into his handes, in whom they shoulde perceyue toward the childe any euill intended.
The Quéene with these wordes stoode a good while in a greate studie.
And forasmuch as hir séemed the Cardinall ready to departe than some of the remnant, and the Protector himselfe readie at hand, so that she verily thought shée coulde not kéepe him there, but that he shoulde incontinent be taken thence, and to conuey him neither had she time to serue hir, nor place determined, nor persons appointed, all things vnreadie, this message came on hir sodainely, nothing lesse looking for, than to haue him fetcht out of Sanctuarie, which she thoughte to be nowe beset such places about, y^ he could not be conueyed out vntaken, and partly (as she thoughte) it might fortune, hir feare to be false, so wel she wiste it was eyther néedelesse or wherfore, if she should néedes goe fro~ him, she déemed it best to deliuer him.
And ouer that, of the Cardinals faith she nothing doubted, nor of some other Lordes neither, whom she there sawe.
Which as she feared least they might be deceiued: so was she wel assured they would not be corrupted: the~ thought she it should yet make them ye more warely to looke to him, the more circumspectly to sée to his suertie, if she we hir owne hands betooke him to the~ of trust.
And at ye last she tooke ye yong Duke by the hand, said vnto the Lords: My Lords (quoth she) al my Lords, neither am so vnwise to mistrust your wittes, nor so suspicious to mistrust your truthes: Of which thing purpose to make you such a proofe, as if either of both lacked in you, mighte turne both me to great sorow, the Realme to much harme, you to great reproch.
For loe, here is (quoth she) this Gentlema~, whom dout not but could here kéepe safe, if would, whatsoeuer any ma~ say: doubt not also, but there be some abrode so deadly enimies vnto my bloud, y^ if they wist where any of it lay in their own body, they would let it out.
We haue also experience ye the desire of a kingdom knoweth no kinred.
The brother hath bene ye brothers bane: may y^ nephewes be sure of their vncle? Eche of these childre~ is the others defence while they be a sunder, eche of their liues lieth in the others body.
Kéepe one safe both be sure, nothing for the~ both more perillous, tha~ to be both in one place.
For what wise Marchant adue~tureth all his goods in one ship? Al this notwithsta~ding, here deliuer him, his brother in him, to kéepe, into your hands, of who~ shal ask the~ both afore god the world.
Faithful ye be ye wote well, knowe well you be wise.
Power strength to kéepe him if you list, neyther lack ye of your self, nor can lack helpe in this case.
And if ye can not else where, then may you leaue him here.
But only one thing beséeche you, for the trust which his father put in you euer, for the trust ye put in you nowe, y^ as far as ye thinke y^
feare too much, be you well ware that you feare not as far too little.
And therwithall the saide vnto the child, farewel mine own swéete son· God send you good kéeping: let me kisse you yet once ere you go, for God knoweth whe~ we shall kisse together againe.
And therwith she kissed him, blessed him, turned hir back wept, went hir way, leauing ye child wéeping as fast.
Lord Cardinal, those other Lords wt him, had receiued this yong duke, they brought him into y^ star Chamber, where y^
Protector tooke him in his armes, kissed him, with these words: now welcome my Lord euen wt al my very hart.
And he said in y^ of likelihood as he thought.
Thervpon forthwith they brought him vnto the King his brother, into the Bishops Palace at Paules, and from thence through the citie honorably into the Tower, out of ye which after y^ day they neuer came abrode.
When the Protector had both y^ children in his hands, he opened himself more boldly, both to certaine other men, also chiefly to y^
Although know y^ many thought y^ this Duke was priuie to al y^
Protectors cou~sel, euen fro~ the beginning, some of the Protectors friends said, y^ the duke was the first mouer of the Protector to this matter, sending a priuie messenger vnto him, straight after K. Edwards death.
But other againe which knew better the subtil wit of y^
Protector, denie y^ he euer opened his enterprise to y^ duke, vntil he had brought to passe y^ things before rehearsed.
Quéens kinsfolks, gotten both hir sonnes into his owne hands, then he opened the rest of his purpose with lesse feare to them whom he thought méet for y^ matter, specially to the Duke, who being woon to his purpose, he thought his strength more than half increased.
The matter was broken vnto ye duke by subtill folkes, such as were their crafts masters in the handling of such wicked deuises: who declared vnto him that the yong king was offended with him for his kinsfolks sake, if he were euer able he would reuenge them.
Who woulde prick him forward thervnto if they escaped (for they would remember their imprisonment) or else if they were put to deathe, without doubte the yong King woulde be carefull for their deathes, whose imprisonment was grieuous vnto him.
And that with repenting the Duke should nothing auaile, for there was no way left to redéeme his offence by benefites, but he shoulde sooner destroy himselfe than saue the king, who with his brother and his kinsfolkes he sawe in such places imprisoned, as the Protector might wyth a beck destroy them all: and that it were no doubt but he woulde doe it in déede, if there were any new enterprise attempted.
And that it was lykely, that as the Protector had prouided priuie garde for hymselfe, so had he spyalles for the Duke, and traynes to catche him, if he shoulde be agaynst hym, and that peraduenture from them, whom he least suspected.
For the state of things and the dispositions of me~ were then such, that a man coulde not well tell whom he mighte trust, or whom he might feare.* These things and such lyke, beyng beaten into the Dukes mynde, brought him to that point, that where he had repented the way that he had entred, yet woulde he goe forthe in the same, and since he had once begunne, he woulde stoutely goe throughe.
And therefore to this wicked enterprise which he beléeued coulde not be voyded, he bent hymselfe, and went through and determined, that since the common mischiefe could not be amended, he would turne it as much as he might to his owne commoditie.
Then it was agréed, that the Protector shoulde haue the Dukes aide to make him King, and that the Protectors only lawfull sonne should marrie the Dukes daughter, that the Protector should graunt him the quiet possession of the of Hertford, which he claimed as his inheritance, and could neuer obtayne it in King Edwardes tyme.
Protector of his own minde promised hym a great quantitie of the kings treasure, and of his housholde stuffe.
And when they were thus at a poynt betwéene themselues, they went about to prepare for y^
Coronation of the yong king as they would haue it séeme.
And that they myght turne both the eyes and mindes of men fro~ perceiuing of their drifts other where, the Lords being sent for from all partes of y^
But the Protector, the duke after that, that they had sent y^
Lord Cardinal, the Archbishop of Yorke then Lord Chauncellour, y^
Lord Stanley, the lord Hastings then Lorde Chamberlaine, wt many other noble men* to common deuise about the coronation in one place, as fast were they in another place, contriuing the contrarie, and to make the Protector King.
To which Cou~cell, albeit there were adhibited very few, they were secret: yet began there here there about, some maner of muttering among y^ people, as though all should not long be wel, though they neyther wyst what they feared, nor wherefore, were it that before such great things mens hartes of a secret instinct of nature misgiue them.
As the sea without winde swelleth of himself somtime before a tempest: or were it that some one man happily somewhat perceiuing, filled many men with suspition, though he shewed few men what he knew.
Howbeit somewhat the dealing it self made men to muse on the matter, though the Councell were close.
For by little and little, all folke withdrew from the Tower, drew to Crosbies in Bishops gate streete. where the Protector kept his houshold.
The Protector had the resort, the King in manner desolate.
While some for their businesse made sute to them that had the doing, some were by their friends secretly warned, that it might happily turne them to no good, to be too muche attendant about the King without the Protectors appointment, which remoued also diuers of the Princes olde seruaunts from him, and set new about him.
Thus many things co~ming togither, partly by chaunce, partly of purpose, caused at length not co~mon people onely, y^ wound wt the wind, but wise men also, some Lords eke to marke the matter, muse thereon, so farre forth, that the Lorde Stanley that was after Earle of Darbie, wisely mistrusted it, and sayde vnto the Lorde Hastings, that he muche mislyked these two seueral Councels.
For while we (quoth he) talke of one matter in ye one place, little wote we wherof they talke in the other place.
My Lorde (quoth the Lorde Hastings of my life neuer doubt you: for while one man is there, which is neuer thence, neuer can there be thing once moued, that should sound amisse toward me, but it shoulde be in mine eares ere it were well out of their mouthes.
This ment he by Catesby, whiche was of hys néere secrete counsell, and whom he verie familiarly vsed, and in his most weightie matters put no man in so speciall trust, reckening himselfe to no man so liefe, sithe he well wyste there was no man so muche to him beholden as was this Catesby, which was a man well learned in the lawes of this land, and by the speciall fauour of the Lorde Chamberlaine, in good authoritie, and much rule bare in all ye Countie of Leycester, where the Lorde Chamberleynes power chiefely laye.
But surely great pitie was it, that he had not had eyther more truth or lesse wit.
In whom if the Lorde Hastings, had not put so speciall trust, the Lorde Stanley and he had departed with diuers other Lordes, and broken all the daunce, for many yll signes that he sawe, which he now construes all to the best.
So surely thought he, that there coulde be no harme toward him in that Councell intended, where Catesby was.
And of truth the Protector, and the Duke of Buckingham.
made verie good semblaunce vnto the Lorde Hastings, and kept him much in companie.
And vndoubtedly, the Protector loued him well, and loth was to haue lost him, sauing for feare least his lyfe shoulde haue quaiied their purpose.
For which cause he moued Catesby to proue wyth some wordes cast out a farre off, whether he coulde thinke it possible to winne the Lorde Hastings vnto their part.
But Catesby whether he assayed him, or assayed him not, reported vnto them, that he founde him so fast, and heard him speake so terrible words, that he durst no further breake.
And of trueth the Lorde Chamberlayne of verye trust shewed vnto Catesby the distrust that other began to haue in the matter.
And therefore hée fearing least theyr motion might with the Lorde Hastings minishe his credence, wherevnto onely all the matter leaned, procured the Protector hastily to rid him.
And much the rather, for that he trusted by his death to obtayne muche of the rule that the Lorde Hastings bare in his Cou~trey: the onely desire wherof, was the allectiue that induced him to be partner and one speciall contriuer of all this horrible treason.
Wherevpon soone after, that is to wit, on the Fryday the thirtéenth day of June, many Lordes assembled in the Tower, and there sat in Councell, deuising the honourable solemnitie of the Kings Coronation, of which the tyme appoynted then so neare approched, that the Pageantes and subtiltyes were in making daye and night at Westminster, and much vitayle kylled therefore, that afterward was cast away.
These Lordes so sitting together communing of thys matter, the Protector came in amongst them first about.
ix. of the clocke, saluting them courteously, and excusing hymself that he had bene from them so long, saying merily that he had bene a sléeper that day.
And after a little talkyng with them, he sayde vnto the Byshop of Elie: My Lorde you haue verye good Strawberies at your Garden in Holborne; require you let vs haue a messe of them.
Gladly my Lorde (quoth he) woulde God had some better thing as readie to your pleasure as that.
And therwith in all the hast he sent hys seruant for a messe of Strawberies.
The Protector set the Lordes fast in communing, therevpon praying them to spare him for a little while, departed thence.
And soone after one houre, betwéene x. and xj. he returned into the Chamber among them all, changed with a wonderfull soure angrie countenance, knitting ye browes, frowning fretting, gnawing on his lippes, so sat hym downe in his place, all the Lordes much dismayde and sore maruelling of this manner of sodaine change, what thing should him aile.
Then, whe~ he had sitten still a while, thus he began: What were they worthy to haue that compasse and imagine the destruction of mée, beyng so néere of bloud vnto the King, and Protector of his Royall person and his Realme? At this question, all the Lordes sat sore astonyed, musing much by whom this question shoulde be ment, of which euery man wyst himselfe cleare.
Then the Lord Chamberlaine, as he that for the loue betwéene them thoughte he might be boldest with him, aunswered and sayde, that they were worthy to be punished as heynous traytors, whatsoeuer they were.
That is (quoth he) yonder sorceresse my brothers wyfe, and other with hir, meaning ye Quéene.
At these words many of ye other Lords were greatly abashed, y^ fauoured hir.
But ye Lord Hastings was in his minde better content, y^
it was moued by hir, tha~ by any other who~ he loued better: Albeit his hart somwhat grudged, yt he was not afore made of counsel in this matter, as he was of the taking of hir kinred, of their putting to death, which were by his assent before, deuised to be beheaded at Pomfret thys self same day, in which he was not ware yt it was by other deuised, yt himself should be beheaded ye same day at London.
Then saide the Protector, ye shall all sée in what wise that sorceresse, and that other Witch of hir counsell Shores wife with their affinitie, haue by their sorcerie and witchcrafte wasted my body.
And therewith he plucked vp his dublet sléeue to his elbow vpo~ his left arme, where he shewed a werish withered arme, and smal, as it was neuer other.
And thervpo~ euery mans minde sore misgaue them, wel perceiuing y^ this matter was but a quarrel.
For they well wist y^ the Quéene was too wise to goe about any such folly.
And also if she would, yet would she of all folke least make Shores wife of counsell, whom of all women she most hated, as that Concubine whome the King hir husbande had most loued.
And also, no manne was there present but well knew that his arme was euer suche since hys byrth.
Naythelesse the Lorde Chamberlayne (which from the death of Kyng Edward kept Shores wyfe, on whom he somewhat doted in the Kings lyfe, sauing (as it is sayde) he, that while forbare hir of reuerence toward the K. or else of a certayn kind of fidelitic to his friend) aunsweared and sayd: certaynly my Lord, if they haue so heynously done, they be worthie heynous punishment.
What (quoth the Protector) thou seruest me wéene with iffes and with andes, tell thée they haue so done, and that will make good on thy bodye traytour: and therewith as in a great anger, he clapped his fyst vpon the bourd a great rappe.
At which token giuen, one cried treason without the Chamber.
Therewith a doore clapped, and in come there rushing men in harnesse, as many as the Chamber myght holde.
And anone the Protector sayd to the Lord Hastings, arrest thée Traytour: What mée my Lord? (quoth he) yea thée traitour quoth the Protector.
And another let flie at the Lorde Stanley, which shrunke at the stroke, and fell vnder ye table, or else his head had béen cleft to the téeth: for as shortly as he shra~ke, yet came the bloud about his eares.
Then were they al quickly bestowed in diuers Chambers, except the Lorde Chamberlaine, whom the Protector bad spéede and shriue him apace, for by Saint Paule (quoth he) will not to dinner till sée thy head off.
It booted him not to aske why, but heauily tooke a Priest at auenture, and made a short shrift, for a longer would not be suffred, the Protector made so much hast to dinner, which he might not goe to, till this were done, for sauing of hys othe.
So was he brought forth into the gréene besyde the Chappell within the Towre, and his head layde downe vppon a long logge of Tymber, and there striken off, and afterward his body with the head enterred at Windsor beside ye body of King Edward.
maruellous case is it to heare eyther the warnings of that he shoulde haue boyded, or the tokens of that he coulde not voyde, for the selfe night next before his death, the Lord Stanley sente a trustie secrete messenger vnto him at mydnight in all the haste, requiring him to rise and ride awaye with hym, for he was disposed vtterly no longer to byde, he hadde so fearefull a dreame, in whiche him thoughte that a Boare with his tuskes so rased them both by ye heads, that the bloud ran about both their shoulders.
And for as much as the Protector gaue the Boare for his cognisance, this dreame made so fearefull an impression in his heart, that he was throughly determined no longer to tarrie, but had hys horsse readie, if the Lord Hastings would goe wyth hym to ride yet so farre the same nighte, that they shoulde be out of daunger ere daye.
Ha good Lord (quoth the Lorde Hastings to this messenger) leaneth my Lorde thy maister so muche to suche trifles, and hath such fayth in dreames, whiche eyther his owne feare fantasieth, or doe rise in the nightes rest by reason of his day thoughts? Tell him it is plaine witchcraft to beléeue in such dreames, whiche if they were tokens of things to come, why thinketh he not y^ we mighte be as likely to make the~ true by our going, if we were caught and brought back (as friends fayle fléers) for the~ had ye Boare a cause likelye to race vs with his Tuskes, as folke y^ fled for some falsehoode, wherfore eyther is there no peril, nor none there is in déede: or if any be, it is rather in going than byding.
And if we shoulde néeds cost fal in peril one way or other, yet had lieffer y^ men should sée that it were by other mennes falsehoode, than thinke it were eyther by our owne faulte, or fainte hearte.
And therefore go to thy maister manne and commende me to him, and pray him to be merry and haue no feare: for ensure him am as sure of the manne that hée woteth of, as am of mine owne hande.
GOD sende grace sir, quoth the messenger, and went his waye.
Certaine is it also, that in riding towards the Tower the same morning in whiche he was beheaded, his Horsse twice or thrice stumbled with him, almoste to the falling, which thing albeit eache man wote wel dayly happeneth to them to whom no such mischance is toward, yet hath it bin of an olde rite and custome, obserued as a token oftentimes notably foregoing some great misfortune.
Now this that followeth, was no warning but an enuyous skorne.
The same morning ere he was vp, came a Knight vnto him, as it were of curtesie, to accompany him to the Counsell, but of trueth sent by the Protector to hast him thitherwardes, with whom he was of secrete confederacie in that purpose, a meane man at that time, and nowe of great authoritie.
This Knight when it happened the Lorde Chamberlayne by the waye to stay his horsse, and commune a while with a Priest whom he mette in the Tower streete, brake his tale, and sayde merily to him, what my Lorde praye you come on, whereto talke you so long with that Prieste, you haue no néede of a Priest yet: and therewith he laughed vpon hym, as though he would saye, yée shall haue soone.
But so little wist the tother what he mente, and so little mistrusted, that he was neuer merier, nor neuer so ful of good hope in his life, which selfe thing is often séene a signe of change.
But shal rather let any thing passe me, than y^ vaine suretie of mans minde so neare his death.
Upon the very Tower Wharfe, so neare the place wher his head was off soone after, there met he with one Hastings a Pursiuaunt of his owne name.
And of theyr méeting in that place, he was put in remembraunce of another time, in whiche it hadde happened them before to méete in lyke manner togither in the same place.
At whiche other tyme the Lord Chamberlain had bin accused vnto King Edward by the Lorde Riuers the Quéenes brother, in suche wise as he was for the while (but it lasted not long) far fallen into ye Kings indignation, and stoode in great feare of himself.
And for as muche as he now mette this Pursiuaunt in the same place that ieopardie so well passed, it gaue hym great pleasure to talke with him thereof, with whom he hadde before talked thereof in the same place, whyle he was therin.
And therefore he sayde: Ah Hastings arte thou remembred when met thée here once with an heauie hearte? Yea my Lorde (quoth he) that remember well, and thanked be God, they got no good, nor you no harme thereby.
Thou wouldest saye so (quoth he) if thou as much as knowe, whyche fewe knowe else as yet, and mo shal shortly.
That ment he by the Lordes of the Quéenes kyndred that were taken before and should that daye be beheaded at which he well wist, but nothing ware that the Are hung ouer his own heade.
In fayth man (quoth he) was neuer so sorie, nor neuer stoode in so great dreade in my life, as dyd when thou and mette here.
And lo howe the worlde is turned, nowe stand mine enimies in the daunger (as thou mayest happe to heare more hereafter) and neuer in my life so mery, nor neuer in so great suretie.
good God the blindnesse of our mortall nature, when he most feared, he was in good suretie, when he reckened himself surest, he lost his life, that within two hours after.
Thus ended thys honourable man, a good Knight and a gentle, of greate aucthoritie with hys Prince, of lyuing somewhat dissolute, playne and open to hys enimie, and secrete to his friend, easie to beguile, as he that of good hearte and courage forestudied no perilles: a louing man and passing wel beloued: very faithful and trustie ynough, trusting too much.
Now flew the fame of this Lords death swiftlye through the Citie, and so forth further about like a winde in euery mans eare.
But the Protector immediately after dinner, intending to sette some colour vpon the matter, sent in all hast for many substantial men out of the Citie into the Tower.
And at theyr comming, himselfe with the Duke of Buckingham, stoode harnessed in olde yll faring Briganders, such as no man shoulde wéene that they would vouchsafe to haue put vpon their backes, except that some sodain necessitie had constrained them.
And then the Protectour shewed them, that the Lorde Chamberlaine and other of his conspiracie had contriued to haue sodainely destroyed hym, and the Duke, there the same daye in the Counsel.
And what they intended further was as yet not well knowne.
Of whiche their Treason hée neuer had knowledge before tenne of the clocke the same forenoone, which sodain feare droue them to put on for their defence suche harneys as came next to hande.
And so hadde God holpen them, that the mischief turned vpon them that woulde haue done it.
Euery man aunswered him fayre, as though no manne mistrusted the matter, which of trothe no manne beléeued.
Yet for the further appeasing of the peoples minde, he sent immediately after dinner in al hast, an Herault of armes, wyth a Proclamation to be made throughe the Citie in the Kyngs name, conteyning, that the Lord Hastings with diuerse other of his trayterous purpose, had before conspired the same daye, to haue slaine the Lorde Protectour, and the Duke of Buckingham, sitting in the Counsell, and after to haue taken vpon them to rule the King, and the realme, at theyr pleasure, and thereby to pill and spoyle whome they list vncontrolled.
And much matter there was in that proclamation, deuised to the slaunder of the Lorde Chamberlayne, as that he was an euil.
Counsayler to the Kings father, inticing him to manye things highly redounding to the minishing of his honour, and to the vniuersall hurte of his Realme by his euill companye, sinister procuring, and vngracious ensample, as wel in manye other things, as in the dicious liuing and inordinate abusion of hys bodie, both wyth manye other, and also speciallye wyth Shores wise, whiche was one also of hys moste secret counsaile of thys heynons treason, with whom he laye nightlye, and namely the night last past nexte before his death, so that it was the lesse maruayle, if vngratious liuing broughte him to an vnhappy ending, whiche he was nowe putte vnto, by the moste dread commaundemente of the Kings highnesse, and of his honorable and faythfull counsayle, bothe for hys demerites, being so openly taken in hys falslye conceyued treason, and also leaste the delaying of his execution, might haue encouraged other mischieuous persons partners of his conspiracie, to gather and assemble themselues togither, in making some greate commotion for hys delyueraunce: whose hope being nowe by his well deserued death politikely repressed, al ye realm should by gods grace, rest in good quiet and peace.
Now was this proclamation made wythin two houres after that he was beheaded, and it was so curiously indited, and so faire written in parchment, in so well a sette hand, and therewith of it selfe so long a processe, that euery childe might well perceyue that it was prepared before.
For all ye time betwéene his death and the proclayming, coulde skant haue sufficed vnto the bare writing alone, all had it béene but in Paper, and scribled forth in haste at aduenture.
So that vpon the proclayming thereof, one that was scholemaster of Paules, of chaunce standing by, and comparing the shortnesse of the time with the length of the matter, sayd vnto them that stoode about him, here is a gay goodly cast, foule cast away for haste: and a Merchaunt aunsweared him, that it was written by prophecie.
Nowe then by by, as it were for anger, not for couetise, the Protectour sent into the house of Shores wife (for hir husbande dwelled not with hyr) and spoyled hir of all that euer she had, aboue the value of two or thrée thousande marke, and sent hyr body to prison.
And when he had a while layde vnto hyr (for the manner sake) that she wente aboute to bewitch him, and that she was of counsaile with the Lord Cha~berlaine to destroy him: in co~clusion when that no colour coulde fasten vppon these matters, then he layde heynously to hir charge, y^ thing that hir selfe could not denye, that all the world wist was true, and that naythelesse euery manne laughed at, to heare it then so sodainely, so highly taken, that she was nought of hir body.
And for this cause (as a good continent Prince, cleane and faultlesse of himselfe, sente out of heauen into this vicious world for the amendment of mens manners) he caused the Bishop of London to put hyr to open penaunce, going before the Crosse in Procession, vpon a Sonday, with a Taper in hir hande.
In whiche she went in countenance and pace demure so womanly, and albeit she were out of al array saue hir kyrtle onlye, yet wente she so faire and louely, namely while the wondering of the people caste a comely rudde in hir chéekes (of which she before had most misse,) yt hir great shame wanne hir much prayse, among those that wer more amorous of hir bodie, than curious of hir soule.
And manye good folke also that hated hir liuing, and glad were to sée sin corrected: yet pitied they more hir penaunce, ethan reioyced therein, when they considered that the Protector procured it, more of a corrupt intent, than any vertuous affection.
This woman was borne in London, worshipfullye friended, honestly brought vp, and very wel maried, sauing somwhat too soone, hir husband an honest Citizen· yong godly, and of good substa~ce.
But for as much as they were coupled ere she were wel ripe, she not very feruently loued, for who~ she neuer longed, which was happily the thing that ye more easily made hir incline vnto the Kings appetite, when hée required hir. Howbeit the respect of his royaltie, the hope of gay apparell, ease, pleasure, and other wanton wealth, was able soone to pierce a soft tender hearte.
But when the king had abused hir, anone hir husband (as he was an honest ma~, one y^ could his good, not presuming to touch a Kings Concubine) left hir vp to him altogither.
When the King died, the Lord Chamberlain tooke hyr, whiche in the Kings dayes, albeit he was sore enamoured vpon hir, yet he forebare hir, eyther for reuerence, or for a certaine friendly faythfulnesse.
Proper she was and fayre: nothing in hir bodie that you would haue chaunged, but if you woulde haue wished hir somewhat higher.
Albeit some that nowe sée hir (for yet she liueth) déeme hir neuer to haue bene wel visaged, whose iudgement séemeth me somewhat like, as though men should gesse the beautie of one long before departed, by hir scalpe taken out of the charnel house: for now is she olde, leane, withered, and dryed vp, nothing left but riueld skin and hard bone.
And yet being euen such: who so wel aduise hir visage, might gesse and deuise, which parts how filled woulde make it a faire face.
Yet delited not men so much in hir beautie as in hir pleasaunt behauiour.
For a proper wit had she, and coulde both reade well and write, merrie in companye, readie and quicke of aunswere, neyther mute nor full of bable, sometime taunting without displeasure, and not without disporte.
The King would say that he had thrée Concubines, which in thrée diuerse properties diuersly excelled.
One the meriest, another the wyliest, the thirde the holyest harlot in his Realme, as one whom no man could get out of the Church lightly to any place, but it were to his bed.
The other two were somewhat greater personages, and nathelesse of their humility content to be namelesse, to forbeare the praise of those properties.
But ye meriest was this Shors wife, in who~ the King therfore tooke speciall pleasure.
For many he had, but hir he loued, whose fauour to saye the troth (for sinne it were to belie the Diuel) she neuer abused to any ma~s hurt, but to manye a mannes comforte and reliefe: where the Kyng tooke displeasure she would mitigate and appease his mynde: where men were out of fauour shée woulde bryng them in his grace.
And finally, in many weightie sutes she stoode many men in great steade, eyther for none or very small rewardes, and those rather gaye than riche: eyther for that she was content with the déede selfe well done, or for that shée delyted to bée sued vnto, and to shewe what shée was able to doe with the King, or for that wanton women and wealthy be not al wayes couetous.
doubt not some shall thinke this woman to sleyghte a thing to be written of, and set among the remembrances of great matters: whych they shall speciallye thinke, that happilye shall estéeme hir onely by that they nowe sée hir.
But me séemeth the chaunce so muche the more worthy to be remembred, in how much she is nowe in the more beggerlye condition, vnfriended and worne out of acquaintaunce, after good substaunce, after as great fauour with the Prince, after as greate sute and séekyng to with all those that those dayes had businesse to spéede, as manye other men were in theyr tymes, which be now famous only by the infamye of theyr yl déeds.
Hir doings wer not much lesse albeit they be much lesse reme~bred bycause they were not so euil.
For me~ vse if they haue an euill turne, to write it in Marble: who so doeth vs a good turne, we write it in duste, whiche is not worst proued by hir: for at this day she beggeth of manye at thys day lyuing, y^ at this day had begged if she had not bin.
Now was it so deuised by the Protectour and his counsayle, that the selfe daye in whych the Lord Chamberlayne was beheaded in the Tower of London, and aboute the selfe same houre, was there (not without his assent) beheaded at Ponfraite, the foreremembred Lords and Knightes that were taken from the King at Northampton and Stonie Stratforde.
Which thing was done in the presence, and by the order of sir Richarde Ratcliffe Knight, whose seruice the Protectour specially vsed in that counsell, and in the execution of such lawlesse enterprises, as a man that had bene long secrete wyth him, hauing experience of the worlde, and a shrewde witte, short and rude in spéech, rough and boysterous of behauyour, bolde in mischiefe, as farre from pitie as from al feare of God.
This Knight bringing the~ out of ye prison to the scaffold, and shewing to the people about that they were traytours, not suffering them to declare speake their innocency, least their words might haue inclyned men to pitie them and to hate the Protector and his part: caused them hastily wythout iudgement, proces, or manner of order, to be beheaded, without other earthly gilt, but onely that they were good me~, too true to the Kyng, and too nigh to the Quéene.
Nowe when the Lorde Chamberlaine and these other Lordes and Knightes were thus beheaded and ridde out of the way: then thoughte the Protector, that whyle men mused what the matter ment, while the Lords of the Realme were about him out of theyr owne strengthes, while no ma~ wiste what to thinke, nor whome to truste, ere euer they shoulde haue space to dispute and disgest the matter and make parties, it were best hastily to pursue his purpose, and put himselfe in possession of the Crown, ere men could haue time to deuise any way to resist.
But nowe was all the studie by what meane thys matter being of it selfe so heynous, might be first broken to the people, in such wise that it might be well taken.
To thys Councell they tooke diuerse, suche as they thought méetlye to be trusted, likelye to be induced to that parte, and able to stande them in steade eyther by power or policie.
Among whome they made of Edmonde Shaa Knight then Maior of London, which vpon trust of his owne aduauncement, whereof he was of a proude hearte highlye desirous, should frame the Citie to theyr appetite.
Of Spirituall men they toke such as had wit, and were in authoritie among the people for opinion of their learning, and had scrupulous conscience.
Among these hadde they Iohn Shaa Clearke, brother to the Maior, and Fryer Penker; of the Augustine Fryers, both Doctours of diuinitie, both great Preachers, both of more learning than vertue, of more fame tha~ learning.
For they were before gretly estéemed among the people: but after that neuer.
Of these two the tone had a Sermon in prayse of the Protecte before the coronation, the tother after, both so ful of tedious flatterie, that no eares coulde abide them.
Penker in his sermon so lost his voyce, that he was fain to leaue off and come downe in the midst: Doctour Shaa by his sermon lost his honestie, and soone after his life, for shame of the worlde, into whiche he durste neuer after come abroade.
But the Frier forced for no shame, and so it harmed him the lesse.
How be it some doubt many thinke, that Penker was not of counsayle of the matter before the coronation, but after the common maner, fel to flatterie after: namely sith his Sermon was not incontinent vppon it, but at Saint Marie Hospitall at the Easter after.
But certaine it is, that Doctor Shaa was of counsayle in the beginning, so farre forth, that they determined that he should first breake the matter in a.
Sermo~ at Paules Crosse, in whiche he should by the authoritie of his preaching, incline the people to the Protectors ghostly purpose.
But now was all the labour and studie, in the deuise of some conuenient pretext, for whyche the people shoulde be content to depose the Prince, and accepte the Protector for King· In which diuerse things they deuised.
But the thing and the weighte of all that inuention, rested in thys, that they should alledge Bastardie· eyther in king· Edward himselfe, or in his children, or both.
So that he should séeme disabled to inherite the Crowne, by the Dyke of Yorke, and the prince by him.
To laye Burstardie in King Edwarde founded openlie to the rebuke of the Protectours owne mother, which was mother to them both: for in that point coulde be none other colour but to protende that his owne mother was an aduoutresse, which notwithstanding, to further thys purpose he letted not: but the lesse, he woulde that poynt shoulde be losse and more fauourably handled, not euen fully plaine and directly, but that the matter shoulde be touched aslope as thou spared in that to speake al the troth, for feare of his displeasure.
But the other poynt concerning the Bastardie that they deuised to surmise in King Edwardes children, that woulde he should be openly declared, and inforced to the vttermost.
The colour and pretext whereof, cannot be wel perceyued, but if we firste repeate you some things long before done about King Edwards mariage.
After that King Edwarde the fourth hadde deposed King Henrie the sixth, and was in peaceable possessio~ of y^ realm, determining himselfe to marie, as it was requisite both for himselfe and for the Realme, he sent ouer in Ambassade the Earle of Warwicke, with other noble men in his companye vnto Spaine, to intreate and conclude a mariage betwéene King Edwarde and the Kings daughter of Spaine.
In which thyng the Earle of Warwicke founde the parties so towarde and willing, that he spéedilyé according to his instructions without any difficultie, brought the matter to very good co~clusion.
Now happened it, that in the meane season there came to make sute by petition to the king Dame Elizabeth Gray, which was after his.
Quéene, at that time a Widowe, borne of noble bloude, specially by hyr mother, whiche was Dutches of Bedforde, ere she married the Lorde Woodfielde hyr Father.
Howbeit this Dame Elizabeth hir selfe, being in seruice wyth Quéene Margaret, wife vnto King Henrie the sixth, was maryed vnto one Iohn Gray an Esquire, whom King Henrie made Knight, vppon the fielde that he had on Bernet Heath by Saint Albons against King Edwarde.
And little while enioyed he that Knighthoode, for he was at the same fielde slaine.
After which done, and the Earle of Warwicke being in his Ambassade aboute the afore remembred mariage, thys péere Ladie made humble sute vnto ye King, that she might be restored vnto such small landes as hir late husbande had giuen hyr in ioynture.
Whome when the Kyng behelde, and hearde hyr speake, as she was both fayre and of a goodly fauour, moderate of stature, wel made, and very wise: he not only pitied hir, but also waxed enamoured of hir.
And takyng hir after secretly aside, beganne to enter in talking more familiarly.
But that did she so wisely, with so good maner, and words so wel set, that she rather kindled his desire than quenched it.
And finallye, after manye a méeting, muche wooyng, and manye greate promises, she well espyed the Kings affection towarde hyr so greatelye encreased, that shée durste somewhat the more boldely say hir minde, as to him whose heart she perceyned more feruently set, than to fall off for a worde.
And in conclusion, she shewed him playne, that as shée wyste hyr selfe to simple to be his wife, so thoughte she hir selfe too good to be hys Concubine.
The King muche maruelling at hir constancie, as hée that hadde not bene wonte else where to be so stiffelye sayde naye, so muche estéemed hir continencie and chastitye, that hée sette hyr vertue in the steade of possession and riches, and thus takyng Counsayle of his desire, determined in all possible haste mary hir.
And after he was thus appointed, and hadde betwéene them twaine ensured hir: then asked he Counsaile of hys other friendes, and that in suche manner, as they might then perceiue, it booted not greatly to say nay.
Notwithstanding the Dutches of Yorke his mother was so sore moued ther wt, ye she diswaded the mariage as much as she possible might, alleaging ye it was his honor, profite and surety also, to marie in a noble progenie out of his Realme, whervpon depended great strength to his estate, by ye affinitie, and great possibilitie of encrease of his possession.
And that he coulde not well otherwise doe, standing that the Earle of Warwick had so far moued alreadye, which were not likely to take it wel, al his voiage wer in such wise frustrate, his apointments deluded.
And she sayd also, yt it was not Princely to mary owne subiecte, no greate occasion leading therevnto, no possessions, or other commoditie depending therevpon, but onely as it were a rich man that woulde marie his mayde, only for a little wanton votage vpon hyr person.
In which mariage many mo co~mende the maydens fortune than the maisters wisedome.
And yet therin she sayd ther was more honestie than honor in this mariage.
For as much as there is betwéene no Merchaunte and his owne mayde so greate difference, as betwéene the King and this widow.
In whose person, albeit there was nothyng to be mislyked, yet was there (she sayde) nothing so excellent but that it mighte bée founde in diuerse other that were more méetly (quoth shée) for your estate, and maydens also, wheras the only widowhead of Elizabeth Gray, though she were in all other things conuenient for you, shoulde yet suffice as me séemeth to refrayne you from hir mariage, sithe it is an vnsitting thing, and a very blemishe and high disparagemente to the sacred maiestie of a Prince, that ought as nigh to approche priesthoode in cleanesse as he doth in dignitie, to be defouled with Bigamie in his first mariage.
The King when his mother had sayde, made hir aunswere, part in earnest, part in play merily, as he that wyste himselfe out of hyr rule.
And albeit he woulde gladlye that she should take it wel, yet was at a point in his own minde, toke she it well or otherwise.
Howbeit somewhat to satisfie hir, he sayde, that albeit mariage beyng a Spiritual thing, oughte rather to be made for the respect of God, where hys grace enclyneth the parties to loue togtiher, as he trusted it was in hys, than for the regarde of any Temporall adua~tage: yet naythelesse, him séemed that this mariage euen worldly considered, was not vnprofitable.
For he reckened the amitie of no earthly Nation so necessarie for him, as the frie~dship of his own, which he thought likly to beare him so muche the more heartie fauour, in that he disdayned not to marie with one of his owne lande.
And yet if outward aliaunce were thought so requisite, he would finde the meanes to enter therevnto, much better by other of his kinne, where all the parties coulde be contented, than to marye himselfe whom he should happily neuer loue, and for the possibilitie of more possessions, lease the fruite and pleasure of this that he had alredy.
For smal pleasure taketh a man in all that euer he hath beside, if he be wiued against his appetite.
And doubt not (quoth he) but there be as yée saye other, yt be in euery point comparable with hir.
And therfore let not the~ that like them to wedde them.
No more is it reason, that it mislike any man, y^
And am sure yt my cousin of Warwicke neither loueth me so little, to grudge at y^
loue, nor is so vnreasonable to looke yt shold in choyse of a wife, rather be ruled by his eie, than by mine own: as though were a ward y^ wer bou~d to mary by ye appointment of a Gardaine.
would not bea K. with y^ co~ditio~, to forbear mine own libertie in choise of mine own mariage.
As for possibilitie of more inherita~ce by new affinitie in strange lands, is oft the occasion of more trouble tha~ profite.
And we haue alreadie title by that meanes, to so much as sufficeth to get and kéepe well in one mans dayes.
That she is a Widow, and hath already children, by Gods blessed Ladie, am a Bacheler haue some to, and so eache of vs hath a proofe that nether of vs is like to be barraine.
And therefore (Madame) pray you be contente, trust in God she shal bring forth a yong Prince that shall please you.
And as for the Bigamie, let the Bishop hardly lay it in my way when come to take orders.
For vndersta~d it is forbidde~ a Priest, but neuer wist it yet, yt it was forbidde~ a prince.
The Dutches with these words nothing appeased, and séeing the King so sette thereon, that she coulde not pul him back, so highly she disdayned it, that vnder pretext of hir dutie to Godwarde, she deuised to disturbe this mariage, and rather to helpe y^ he should marie one Dame Elizabeth Lucy, whom the King hadde also not long before gotten with childe.
Wherfore the Kings mother openly obiected against his mariage, as it were in discharge of hir conscience, that the King was sure to Dame Elizabeth Lucy, and hir husbande before God.
By reason of which wordes, such obstacle was made in the matter, that eyther the Bishops durst not, or the K. would not procéed to the solemnizatio~ of this wedding, til these same wer clearly purged, the troth wel and openly testifyed.
And albeit that she was by the Kings mother and many other put in good comforte, to affirme that she was ensured vnto the King: yet when she was solemnly sworn to say the troth, she confessed that they were neuer ensured.
Howbeit she sayde his grace spake so louing words vnto hir, that she verily hoped he woulde haue maried hir.
And yt if it had not bene for such kinde wordes, she would neuer haue shewed such kindnes to him, to let him so kindly get hir with child.
This examination solemnly taken, when it was clearly perceyued that there was none impedimente: the King with gret feast and honorable solemnitie, maried dame Elizabeth Gray and hir crowned Quéene that was his enimies wife, many time had prayed ful heartilye for his losse, in which God loued hir better than to graunte hir hir bone.
But when the Earle of Warwicke vnderstoode of this mariage, he toke it so highly that his Ambassade was deluded, that for very anger and disdaine, he at his returning assembled a great puissaunce against the King, came so fast vpo~ him or he coulde be able to resist, that he was fayne to voyd the realme, and flée into Hollande for succour, where he remayned for the space of two yeres, leauing his new wife in Westminster in Sanctuarie, where she was deliuered of Ed. the Prince, of whom we before haue spoke~.
In which mean time the Erle of Warwicke tooke out of prison, and set vppe again King Henrie the sixth, which was before by King Edward deposed, that much what by ye power of the Erle of Warwick which was a wise man, and a couragious warrior, of such strength, what for his lands, his alliance, fauoure with all people, that he made Kings, and put down kings almost at his pleasure, not impossible to haue atteyned it himselfe, if he had not reckened it a greater thing to make a King than to be a King.
But nothing lasteth alway: for in conclusion King Edwarde returned, and with muche lesse number than he had at Barnet on the Easterday fielde, the Earle of Warwicke, with many other great estats of that partie, and so stablie attayned the Crowne againe, that he peaceably enioyed it vntil his dying day: and in such plight left it, that it coulde not be loste, but by the discorde of hys very friendes, or falsehoode of his fayned friends.
haue rehearsed this businesse aboute this mariage somewhat the more at length, bycause it might thereby the better appeare vpon howe slipper a grounde the Protector builded his colour, by whiche he pretended King Edwardes children to be Bastardes.
But that inuention simple as it was, it liked them to whom it sufficed to haue somewhat to saye, whyle they were sure to be compelled to no larger proofe than the~selues liste to make.
Now then (as began to shew you) it was by the Protector and his counsaile concluded, that this Doctour Shaa should in a sermon at Paules crosse signifye to the people, y^ neither king Edwarde himselfe, nor the Duke of Clarence, were lawfully begotten, nor were not the very children of ye duke of Yorke, but begotte~ vnlawfully by other perso~s, by aduoutrie of the Dutches their mother.
And that also dame Elizabeth Lucy was verily the wife of King Edward, and so the Prince and al his children Bastards, that were begotte~ vpon the Quéene.
Sonday after, at Paules Crosse in a greate audience (as alway assembled great number to his preaching) he tooke for his Theame Spuria vitulamina non agent radices alt as.
That is to say: Bastarde slippes shal neuer take deepe roote.
Therevppon when he had shewed the great grace that God giueth secretly infundeth in right generation after y^ lawes of matrimonie, the~ declared he y^ co~monly those children lacked y^ grace, for ye punishment of their pare~ts were for ye more part vnhappy, which wer gotte~ in base, specially in aduoutrie.
Of which though some by the ignorance of the world and the truth hid from knowledge inherited for the season other mens landes, yet God alway so prouideth, that it continueth not in their bloud long, but ye truth comming to light, the rightfull inheritors be restored, and the bastard slip pulled vp ere it can be rooted déepe.
And when he had laid for the proofe and confirmation of this sentence certaine ensamples taken out of the old Testament, and other auncient histories, then beganne he to descend into the praise of the Lorde Richarde late Duke of Yorke, calling him father to the Lorde Protector, and declared the title of his heires vnto the Crowne, to whom it was after the death of King Henrie the sixt entayled by authoritie of Parliament.
Then shewed he that his verie right heyre of his body lawfully begotten was onely the Lord Protector.
For he declared then, that King Edward was neuer lawfully marryed vnto the Quéene, but was before God, husband vnto Dame Elizabeth Lucie, and so his children bastardes.
And besides that, neither King Edwarde himselfe, nor the Duke of Clarence, among those that were secrete in the housholde, were reckened verie surely for the children of the noble Duke, as those that by their fauours more resembled other knowne men than him.
From whose vertuous conditions he sayde also that King Edward was farre off.
But the Lorde Protector he sayd, the verie noble Prince, the speciall paterne of Knightly prowes, as well in all Princely behauiour as in the lineamentes and fauour of his visage, represented the very face of the noble Duke his father.
This is, quoth he, the fathers owne figure, this is his owne countenaunce, the verie print of his visage, the sure vndoubted Image, the plaine expresse likenesse of that noble Duke.
Nowe was it before deuised, that in the speaking of these words, the Protector shoulde haue come in among the people to the Sermon warde, to the end that those words méeting with his presence, might haue bene taken among the hearers, as though the holy ghost had put them in the preachers mouthe, and shoulde haue moued the people euen there to crie, King Richarde, King Richarde, that it myght haue béene after sayde, that he was specially chosen by God and in manner by myracle.
But this deuise quayled, eyther by the Protectors negligence or the Preachers ouermuch diligence.
For whyle the Protector founde by the way tarying, least he shoulde preuent those wordes, and the Doctor fearing that he shoulde come ere hys Sermon could come to these wordes, hasted his matter thereto, who was come to them, and paste them, and entred into other matters ere the Protector came.
Whom when he beheld comming, he sodainely lefte the matter with which he was in hande, and without any deduction thervnto, out of al order and out of all frame beganne to repeate those wordes agayne: this is the very noble Prince, the speciall patrone of Knightly prowes, which as well in all Princely behauiour, as in the and fauour of his vsage, representeth the verie face of the noble Duke of Yorke his father: this is the fathers owne figure, this is his owne countenaunce, the very print of his visage, the sure vndoubted Image, the playne expresse lykenesse of the Noble Duke, whose remembrance can neuer dye whyle he liueth.
While these wordes were in speaking, the Protector accompanied with the Duke of Buckingham, went through the people into the place where the Doctors commonly staud in the vpper storie, where he stoode to hearken the Sermon.
But the people were so farre from crying King Richarde, that they stoode as they had béene turned into stones, for wonder of this shamefull Sermon.
After which once ended, the Preacher gat him home, and neuer after durst looke out for shame, but kepte hym out of sight lyke an Owle.
And when he once asked one that had béene his olde friend what the people talked of him, al were it that hys owne conscience well shewed him that they talked no good, yet when the other aunswered him, that there was in euery mannes mouth spoken of hym much shame, it so strake him to the heart, that within fewe dayes after hée withered and consumed away.
Then on the Tuesday folowing this sermon, there came into the Guild hall in London the Duke of Buckingham, accompanyed with diuerse Lordes and Knightes, more than happily knewe the message that they brought.
And there in the East end of the hall, where ye Maior kéepeth the Hustings, the Maior and all the Aldermen beyng assembled aboute him, all the Commons of the Citie gathered before them: after silence commaunded vppon great payne in the Protectors name: the Duke stoode vp, and (as he was neyther vnlearned, and of nature maruellously well spoken) he said vnto the people with a cleare and a loude voyce in this manner of wise.
FRiendes, for the zeale and heartie fauour that we beare you, wée be come to breake vnto you, of a matter ryght great and weightie, and no lesse weightie than pleasing to God, and profitable to all the Reame: nor to no part of the Realme more profitable, than to you the Citizens of this noble Citie.
For why, that thing that we wote wel ye haue long tyme lacked, and sore longed for, that ye woulde haue giuen great good for, that ye would haue gone farre to fetch, that thing we be come hither to bring you without your labour, paine, cost, aduenture or ieoperdie.
What thing is that: Certes the suertie of your owne bodyes, the quiet of your wynes and your daughters, the sauegarde of your goods: of all whych things in tymes paste ye stoode euer more in doubte.
For who was there of you all, that woulde recken him selfe Lorde of his owne good among so many grens and traps as was set therfore, among so much pilling polling, among so many taxes tallages, of which there was neuer end, oftentimes no néede: or if any were, it rather grew of royot, vnreasonable wast, tha~ any necessary or honorable charge.
So yt there was dayly pilled fro~ good me~ and honest, great substance of gods to be lashed out among vnthrifts, so farre forth that fiftenes sufficed not, nor any vsuall manner of knowne taxes: but vnder an easye name of beneuolence and good will, the Commissioners so much of euery man tooke, as no man coulde with his good will haue giuen.
As though that name of beneuolence, had signified that euery man shoulde pay not what himselfe of his owne good will lyst to graunt, but what the King of his good will lyst to take.
Which neuer asked little, but euery thing was hau~sed aboue the measure, amerciaments turned into fines, fines into raunsoms, small trespasses in misprision, misprision into treason.
Whereof thinke no man looketh that we shoulde remember you of examples by name, as though Burdet were forgotten, that was for a word spoken in hast cruelly beheaded, by the misconstruing of the lawes of this Realme, for the Princes pleasure: wyth no lesse honour to Markam then chiefe Justice, that left his office rather than he woulde assent to that iudgement, than to the dishonestie of those, that eyther for feare or flatterie gaue that iudgeme~t.
What Cooke your owne worshipful neighbour, Alderman and Maior of this noble Citie, who is of you eyther so negligent that he knoweth not, or so forgetful that he remembreth not, or so hard hearted that he pitieth not that worshipfull mans losse? what speake we of losse? his vtter spoyle and vnderserued destruction, onely for that it happened those to fauour him whom the Prince fauored not.
We néede not suppose to rehearse of these any mo by name, sith there be (I doubt not) many here present, that eyther in themselues, or in their nigh friendes haue knowne as well their goods as their persons greatly endaungered, eyther by feyned quarels, or small matters agréeued wyth heynous names.
And also there was no crime so great, of which there could lacke a pretext.
For sith the King preuenting the time of his inheritaunce attayned the Crowne by battayle: it sufficed in a riche man for a pretext of treason, to haue bene of kindred or aliaunce, neare familiaritie or longer acquaintaunce with any of those that were at anye tyme the Kings enimies, which was at one time and other, more than halfe the Realme.
Thus were neither your goods in suertie, and yet they brought your bodyes in ieoperdie, beside the common aduenture of open warre, which albeit that it is euer the will and occasion of much mischiefe, yet is it neuer so mischieuous as where any people fall at distaunce among themselues, nor in none earthly nation so deadly and so pestilent, as when it hapneth among vs: and among vs neuer so long continued dissention, nor so many battayles in that season, nor so cruell and so deadly foughte~, as was in that Kings dayes that deade is, God forgiue it his soule.
In whose time, and by whose occasion, what about the getting of the garland, kéeping it, leasing, and winning againe, it hath cost more English bloud, than hath twice the winning of Fraunce.
In which inwarde warre among our selues, hath bene so great effusion of the auncient noble bloud of this Realme, that scarcely the halfe remayneth, to the great enféebling of this noble land, beside many a good towne ransacked and spoyled by them, that hath bene going to the fielde or comming from thence.
So that no time was there, in which riche men for their money, and great men for their landes, or some other for some feare, or some displeasure were not out of perill.
For whom trusted he that mistrusted his owne brother? who~ spared he that kylled hys owne brother? or who coulde perfitly loue him, if his owne brother could not? What manner of folke he most fauored we shall for his honour spare to speake of, howbeit, this wote you well all, that who so was best, bare alway least rule, more sute was in his dayes vnto Shores wife, a vile and an abhominable strumpet, than to all the Lordes in Englande, except vnto those that made hir their protector: which simple woman was well named and honest, tyll the King for hys wanton lust and sinful affection bereft hir from hir husband, a right honest substantiall yong man among you.
And in that point, which in good fayth am sorie to speake of, sauing that it is in vaine to kéepe in counsell that thing that all men knowe, the Kings gréedie appetite was insatiable, and euery where ouer all the Realme intollerable.
For no woman was there any where, yong or olde, or poore, whom he set his eye vpon, in whom he any thing liked, eyther person or fauour, spéeche, pace, or countenaunce, but without any feare of God, or respect of his honor, murmure or grudge of the worlde, he would importunely pursue his appetite, haue hir, to the great destruction of many a good woman· and great dolor to their husbande and their other friendes, which being honest people of themselues, so much regarde the cleannesse of their house, the chastitie of theyr wiues, and their children, that them were leauer to lease al that they haue beside, than to haue such a villanie done the~.
And all were it that wyth this and other importable dealyngs, the Realme was in euery part annoyed: yet specially ye here the Citizens of this noble Citie, as well for that amongest, you is most plentie of all such things as minister matter to suche iniuryes, as for that you were nearest at hand, sith that neare here about was commonly his most abyding.
And yet be ye the people whom he had as singular cause wel and kindly to entreat, as any part of his Realme, not onely for that the Prince by this noble Citie, as hys especiall Chamber, and the speciall well renowmed Citie of hys Realme, much honourable fame receiueth among all other nations: but also for that ye not without your great coste, and sundrie perils and ieoperdies in all his warres, hare euen your speciall to his parte, whyche kinde myndes borne to the house of Yorke, sithe hée hathe nothyng worthyly acquited, there is of that house that now by Gods grace better shall, which thing to shewe you, is the whole summe and effecte of this our present errande.
It shall not wote well, néede that rehearse you againe, that ye haue alreadie hearde, of hym that can better tell it, and of whom am sure ye wyll better beléeue it.
am not so proude to looke therfore that yée shoulde recken my wordes of as greate aucthoritie as the Preachers of the worde of God, namely a man so cunning and so wyse, that no man better woteth what he shoulde saye, and thereto so good and vertuous, that hée woulde not saye the thing which he wyst he should not saye· in the Pulpet, namely, into the which no houest man commeth to lye, which honorable Preacher yée well remember substantially declared vnto you at Paules· on Sunday last passed, the right title, that the most excellent Prince Richarde Duke of Glocester, now Protector of this Realme hath vnto the Crowne and Kingdome of the same.
For as the worshipfull man groundlye made open vnto you, the children of King Edward the fourthe, were neuer lawfully begotten, for as much as the King (leauing his very wyfe Dame Elizabeth Lucie was neuer lawfully married vnto the Quéene their mother, whose bloud sauing that he set his voluptuous pleasure before his honor, was ful vmnéetly to be matched with his, and the minglyng of whose bloude togither, hath beene the effusion of great parte of noble bloud of this Realme.
Whereby it may well séeme the mariage not well made, of which there is so muche mischiefe growne.
For lacke of which lawfull accoupling, and also of other things which the sayde worshipfull Doctor rather signified· than fully explaned, and which things shall not be spoken mée; as the thing wherein euery man forbeareth to say that he knoweth auoyding displeasure of my noble Lord Protector, bearing as nature requireth a filiall re to the Duches his mother, for these causes before remembred· that is to wit, for lacke of other is lawfullye comming of the late noble Prince Richarde Duke of Yorke, to whose morall bloud the Crowne of Englande and of Fraunce is by the hyghe aucthoritie of Parliament entayled, the ryght and title of the same, is by the inst course of inheritaunce according to the common lawes of thys Lande, and commen vnto the most excellent Prince the Lord Protector, as to the very lawfully· tten sonne of the forere membred noble of Yorke.
Which thing well considered· and the great knightly prowes pondered, with manifolde vertues which in his noble person singularly abound, the Nobles and Commons also of this Realme, and specially of the North part, not willing any bastard bloud to haue the rule of the land, nor the abustons before in the same vsed any longer to continue, haue condiscended and fully determined to make humble petition to the most puissaunt Prince the Lord Protector, that it may lyke his grace at our humble request, to take vpon him the guiding and gouernance of this Realme, to the wealth and encrease of the according to hys verie right and iust tytle.
Which thing wote it well, he will be lothe to take vpon hym, as he whose wisedome well perceyueth the labour and studie both of minde and body, that shall come therewith, to whomsoeuer so will occupie the roome, as dare say he will if he take it.
And that the great wise man well perceiued, when he rex puer est: Wo is that Realme that hath a childe to their King.
Wherefore so much the more cause haue we to thanke God, that this Noble personage which is so righteously intituled thervnto, is of so sad age, and therevnto so great wisedome ioyned with so great experience, which albeithe will be loth (as haue sayd) to take it vpon him, yet shall he to our petition in that behalfe the more graciously if ye the worshipful Citizens of this the chiefe Citie of this Realme, ioyne wyth vs the nobles in our saide request.
Which for your owne weale we doubt not but ye will: and nathelesse harly pray you so to doe, whereby you shall doe great profit to all this Realme beside, in chosing them so good a King, and vnto your selfe special commoditie, to whom his Maiestie shal euer after beare so much the more tender fauour, in howe much he shal perceyue you the ore proue and minded toward his election.
Wherin deare friends what minde you haue, you plainely to shew vs.
When the Duke had sayde, and looked that the people whom he hoped that the Maior hadde framed before, should after this proposition made, haue cryed King Richarde, King Richard, all was husht and mute, and not one word aunswered therevnto: wherewith the Duke was maruellously abashed, and taking the Maior nearer to hym, with other that were aboute him priuie to that matter, sayde vnto them softlye, what meaneth thys, that thys people be so styll? Syr (quoth the Maior percase they perceyue you not well.
That shall wée mende (quoth he) if that will) helpe.
And by and by somewhat louder hée rehearsed them the same matter agayne in other order and other wordes so well and ornately, and naythelesse so euidentlye and playne, wyth voyce, gesture, and countenaunce so comely, and so conuenient, that euery man muche maruelled that hearde him, and thought that they neuer had in theyr liues heard so euil a tale so well tolde.
But were it for wonder or feare, or that eche lookt that other shoulde speake first: not one worde was there aunswered of all the people that stoode before, but all was as styll as the mydnight, not so muche as rowning amongest them, by which they myght séeme to commune what was best to doe.
When the Maior sawe this, hée with other partners of that Councell drewe aboute the Duke, and sayde that the people had not béene accustomed there to be spoken vnto, but by the Recorder, which is the mouth of the Citie, and happily to him they wyl aunswere.
With that the Recorder called Fitz William, a sad manne, and an honest, which was so newe come into that office, that he neuer had spoken to the people before, and lothe was wyth that matter to begynne, notwithstandyng, therevnto commaunded by the Maior, made rehearsall to the Commons of y^ the Duke had twice rehearsed them to himselfe.
But the Recorder so tempered hys tale, that he shewed euery thing as the Dukes wordes, and no parte of hys owne.
But all this noting, no chaunge made in the people, which alway after one, stoode as they had béene men amased, wherevppon the Duke rowned vnto the Maior and sayde: this is a maruellous obstinate silence, and there with he turned vnto the people agayne with these wordes: Deare friendes wée come to mooue you to that thing whiche peraduenture wée not so greatlye needed, but that the Lordes of thys Realme, and the commons of other parties might haue sufficed: sauing that wée sache loue beare you, and so much set by you, that we woulde not gladlye doe without you, that thing in whiche to be partners is your weale and honour, which as it séemeth, either you sée not, or wey not.
Wherefore we require you giue vs answeare one or other whether yée be ininded as al y^
Nobles of the Realm be, to haue this Noble Prince now Protector to be your King or not.
At these wordes the people beganne to whisper among themselues secretely, that the voice was neither lowde nor distinct, but as it were the sounde of a swarme of Bees, tyll at the last in the neather end of the Hall, a bushment of the Dukes seruauntes and Nashfieldes, and other longing to the Protector, with some prentises and laddes that thrust into the Hall among the prease, beganne sodainly at mens backes to crye out as loude as theyr throtes woulde King Richarde, King Richarde, and threwe vp their cappes in token of ioy.
And they that stoode before cast backe their heads maruelling thereof, but nothing they sayde.
And when the Duke and the Maior sawe this manner, they wiselye turned it to theyr purpose, and sayde it was a goodly crye, and a ioyfull to heare, euerye man with one voyce, no man saying nay.
Wherefore friendes (quoth the Duke) since that we perceiue it is all your whole myndes to haue this Noble man for your K. wherof we shall make his grace so effectuall report, that we doubt not but it shall redounde vnto your great we~ale and commodytie: wee require ye that ye to morow go with vs, and we with you vnto his Noble graced, to make our humble request· vnto him in maner before remembred.
And there with the Lords came and the company dissolued and departed, the more part all sad; some with glad femblance that were not very merrie, and· some of those that came thither wyth the Duke not able to dissemble their sorrow, were faine at his barke to turne their face to the wall, while the dolour of their heart burst out of their eyes.
Then on the morrowe after, the Maior with all the Aldermen and chiefe commoners of the citie in their best maner apparelled, assembling themselues together, resorted vnto Baynardes Castell where the Protector lay.
To which place repayred also accordyng to theyr appoyntment, the Duke of Buckingham, with diuerse Noble men wyth him, besyde many Knightes and other Gentlemen.
And therevppon the Duke sent worde vnto the Lorde Protector of the being there of a great and honorable companie; to moue a great matter vnto his grace.
Wherevpon the Protector made difficultie to come out vnto them, but if he first knewe some part of their errand, as thoughe he doubted, and partly distrusted the comming of a number vnto him so sodenly, without any warning or knowledge whether they came for good or harme.
Then the duke when he had shewed this vnto the Maior other, that they might therby sée how little the Protector looked for this matter, they sent vnto him by the Messenger suche louing message againe, and there with so humbly besought him to vouchsafe, that they might resort to his presence, to purpose their intent, of which they woulde vnto none other person part disclose, that at the last he came forth of his Chamber, and yet not downe vnto them, but stoode aboue in a Gallerie ouer them, where they might sée him, and speake to him, as though be woulde not yet come too néere them tyll he will what they ment.
And there vpon the Duke of Buckingha~, first made humble position vnto him on the behalfe of them all, that his grace pardon them, and licence them to purpose vnto his the intent of comming, without his displeasure, without which pardon obteined, they durst not be bolde to moue him of that matter.
In whiche albeit they ment as muche honour to his grace, as wealthe to all the Realme beside, yet were they not sure howe his grace woulde take it, whom they woulde in no wyse offende.
Then the Protector (as he was verie gentle of himselfe, and also longed sore to witte what they ment) gaue him leaue to purpose what him lyked, verily trusting for the good minde that hée bare them all, none of them any thing woulde intende vnto him warde, wherewith he ought to be grieued.
When the Duke had thys leaue and pardon to speake, then waxed hée bolde to shew him their intent and purpose, with all the causes moouing them therevnto as ye before haue heard, and finally to beséeche his grace, that it woulde like him of his accustomed goodnes zeale vnto the realme nowe with his eye of pitie, to beholde the long continued distresse and decaye of the same, and to set his gracious handes to redresse and amendment thereof, by taking vpon him the Crowne and gouernaunce of thys Realme, accordyng to his ryght and tytle lawfully descended vnto him, and to the laude of God, profite of the Lande, and vnto hys grace so muche the more honour, and lesse payne, in that that neuer Prince raygned vppon any people, that were so glad to lyue vnder hys obeysaunce, as the people of thys Realme vnder his.
When the Protector had hearde the proposition, he looked verie straungely therat, answered: that albeit it were ye he partly knewe the things by them alledged to be true, yet such entire loue he bare vnto King Ed. and his children, y^ so much more he regarded his honor in other realmes, about than the Crowne of any one of whiche hée was neuer desyrous, y^ he coulde not finde in his heart in this poynt to enclyne to theyr desire.
For in all other Nations where the truth were not well knowne, it shoulde peraduenture be thoughte, that it were his owne ambitious minde and deuise, to depose the Prince, and take himselfe the Crowne, with which infamie he woulde not haue his honour stayned for any Crowne, in which he had euer perceyued much more labour and payne, than pleasure to hym that would so vse it, as he that woulde not, were not worthie to haue it.
Notwithstanding he not onely pardoned them the motion that they made him, but also thanked them for the loue and heartie fauour they bare hym, praying them for hys sake to gyue and beare the same to the Prince, vnder whom hée was, and woulde bée content to lyue, and with hys labour and counsell, as farre as should lyke the King to vse him, he would doe his vttermost deuoyre to set the Realme in good state, whyche was alreadie in this lyttle whyle of hys Protectorshippe (the prayse gyuen to God) well begunne, in that the malice of suche as were before occasion of the contrarie, and of new intended to bée, were nowe partly by good policie, partly more by Gods speciall prouidence, than mans prouision repressed.
Uppon this aunswere giuen, the Duke by the Protectours licence, a lyttle rowned, aswell wyth other Noble men aboute hym, as with the Maior and Recorder of London.
And after that vppon lyke pardon desired and obteyned, he shewed aloude vnto the Protector, that for a finall conclusion, that the Realme was appoynted King Edwardes lyne should not any longer raygne vpon them, both for that they hadde so farre gone, that it was nowe no suertie to retreate, as for that they thoughte it for the weale vniuersall to take that waye, althoughe they had not yet begonne it.
Wherfore if it would lyke his grace to take the Crowne vppon hym, they woulde humbly beséeche him therevnto.
If he woulde giue them a resolute aunswere to the contrarie, which they woulde be lothe to heare, then must they néedes séeke and shoulde not fayle to fynde some other noble man that would.
These wordes muche moued the Protectour, which else as euerie man may wit, woulde neuer of likelyhood haue enclyned therevnto.
But when hée sawe there was none other waye, but that eyther he must take it, or else hée and hys both goe from it, he sayde vnto the Lordes and Commons: Sith wée perceyue well that all the Realme is so set, whereof wée bée very sorie that they will not suffer in any wise King Edwardes lyne to gouerne them, whome no man earthly can gouerne agaynst their wylles, and we wel also perceyue, that no man is there, to whome the Crowne can by iust tytle appertayne, as to our selfe, as verie ryghte heyre lawfully begotten of the bodie of our most deare father Richarde late Duke of Yorke, to whiche tytle is nowe ioyned your election, the Nobles and Commons of thys Realme, which wée of all tytles possible take for most effectuall: Wée bée content and agrée fauourably to enclyne to your petition and request, and accordyng to the same, here wée take vppon vs the royall estate, preeminence and kingdome of the two noble Realmes, Englande and Fraunce, the one from this daye forwarde, by vs and our heyres to rule, gouerne, and defende: the other by Gods grace, and your good helpe, to get agayne and subdue, and establishe for euer in due obedience vnto thys Realme of Englande, the aduauncement wherof wée neuer aske of God longer to liue; than we intend to procure.
With this there was a great shoute, crying King Richarde, King Richarde.
And then the Lordes went vp to the King (for so was he from that tyme called) and the people departed, talking diuersely of the matter, euery man as hys fantafie gaue him.
But much they talked and maruelled of the manner of this dealing, that the matter was on both partes made so straunge, as thoughe neyther had euer communed with other thereof before, when that them selues wyste there was no manne so dull that hearde them, but hée perceyued well ynoughe, that all the matter was made betwéene them.
Howbeit some excused that agayne, and sayd all muste be doone in good order? And menne must somtyme for the manners sake, not be aknowen what they knowe.
For at the consecration of a Byshop, euerye man woteth well by the paying for his Bulles, that hée purposeth to be one, and thoughe he paye for nothing else.
And yet must he be twyce asked whether he will be Byshop or no, and he muste twice saye nay, and at the thyrde tyme take it, as compelled therevnto by his owne will.
And in a stage play, the people know right well, that hée that playeth the Sowdaine, is percase a sowter, yet if one shoulde know so little good, to shew out of seaso~ what acquaintance hée hath with hym, and call hym by his owne name while he standeth in his Maiestie, one of his tormentors myghte hap to breake his head, and worthy for marring of the play.
And so they sayde, that these matters be Kings games, as it were stage playes, and for the more part, played vpon scaffoldes.
For they that somtime step vp, and play with them, when they cannot playe theyr partes, they disorder the playe, and doe themselues no good.
(·.·) King Richard the thirde [Figure: THe next day, the Protector with a great trayne, went to Westminster Hall, and there when he had placed himself in ye Court of the Kings Bench, declared to the audience, that he would take vppon him the Crowne in that place there, where the King himselfe sitteth and ministreth ye law, because he considered that it was the chiefest duetie of a King to minister the lawes.
Then with as pleasant an Oration as he could, he went about to wyn vnto him the nobles, the merchants, the artificers, and in conclusion all kind of men but especially the Lawyers of thys Realme.
And finally to the intent that no man should hate him for feare, and that his deceitfull clemencie myght get him the good will of the people, when he had declared ye discommoditie of discorde, and the commodities of concorde and vnitie, he made an open proclamation, that he did put out of his minde all enmities, and that he there did openly pardon all offences committed against him.
And to the intent that he might shewe a proofe thereof, he commaunded that one Fogge, whome he had long deadlye hated, shoulde be broughte then before him, who being broughte out of the Sanctaurie (for thyther hadde fledde for feare of him) in the sighte of the people, he toke him by the hande.
Which thing the Commo~ people reioyced at, and praysed, but wise men tooke it for a vanitie.
In his returne homewarde, whom soeuer he met, he saluted.
For a mynde that knoweth it selfe guiltie, is in a manner deiected to a seruile flatterie.
When he had begon his raigne in June, after this mockishe election, then was he Crowned the sixth daye of the same moneth.
And that solemnitie was furnished for the most part, with the selfe same prouision that was appointed for the coronation of his nephew.* Now fell there mischieues thick.
And as the thing euill gotten is neuer well kepte, thoroughe all the time of hys raigne neuer ceassed their cruell death and slaughter, tyl his owne destruction ended it.
But as he finished his time with the best death and the most righteous, that is to witte, hys owne, so beganne he with the most piteous and wicked, meane the lamentable murther of his innocent nephewes, the yong King and his tender brother: whose death and finall infortune hath nathelesse commen so farre in question, that some remayne yet in doubt, whether they were in hys dayes destroyed or no.
Not for that only that Perkyn Werbecke by many folkes malice, and moe folkes folly, so long space abusing the worlde, was as well with Princes as the poorer people, reputed and taken for the yonger of these two, but for that also that all things were in late dayes so couertly demeaned, one thing pretended, and another me~t, that there was nothing so plaine openly proued, but that yet for the commo~ custom of close couert dealing, men had it euer inwardly suspect: as manye well counterfayted Jewels make the true mistrusted.
Howbeit concerning the opinion, with the occasions mouing eyther partie, we shall haue place more at large to intreate, if we hereafter happen to write the time of the late noble Prince of famous memorie King Henrie the seauenth, or percase that Historie of Perkin in any compendious processe by it selfe.
But in the meane time for this present matter, shal rehearse you the dolorous ende of those babes, not after euerye waye that haue hearde but by suche men and by suche meanes as me thinketh it were harde, but it shoulde be true.
King Richard after his Coronation, taking his waye to Glocester to visite in his newe honour, the Towne of which he bare the name of his olde, deuised as he rode, to fulfil the thing which he before had intended.
And for as much as hys minde gaue him, that his nephewes liuing, me~ would not recken that he coulde haue right to the Realme, he thought therfore without delay to ridde them, as though the killing of his kinsmen coulde amende his cause, and make him a kindely King.
Whervpon, he sent one Iohn Greene, whom he speciallye trusted vnto Syr Robert Brakenburie, Conestable of the tower, with a letter and credence also, that the same sir Robert shoulde in any wise put the two children to death.
This Iohn Greene did his errand vnto Brakenburie, knéeling before our Lady in the Tower, who playnely answered, that he would neuer put them to death to die therefore: with whiche aunsweare, Iohn Greene returning, recoumpted the same to King Richard at Warwicke yet in hys waye.
Wherewith he tooke suche displeasure and thought, that the same night he sayde vnto a secréet page of his: Ah whom shall a man trust? those that haue brought vpmy self, those that had wened would most surely serue me, euen those fayle me, and at my commaundement, will do nothing for me.
Sir (quoth his page) there lyeth one on your pallet without, that dare well say, to do your grace pleasure, the thing were right harde that he would refuse, meaning this by sir Iames Tirell, which was a man of right goodly personage, and for natures giftes worthy to haue serued a much better Prince, if he had wel serued God, by grace obtained as much troth and good wil as he had strength and witte.
The man had an high hart, and sore longed vpward, not rising yet so fast as he had hoped, being hindered kept vnder by the meanes of Sir Richarde Ratclife, and sir Wil. Cates by, which longing for no mo partiners of the Princes fauour, and namely not for him, whose pride they wist wold beare no péere, kéepte him by secrete driftes out of all secret trust, which thing, this Page wel had marked and known: wherfore this occasion offered, of very speciall friendship he tooke his time to put him forward, by such wise to doe him good, that al the enimies he had, except the Diuel, could neuer haue done him so much hurt.
For vpo~ this pages words King Richard arose (For this co~munication had he sitting at the draught, a conuenient Carpet for such a counsel) and came out into a Pallet Chamber, on which he found in bed sir Iames sir Thomas Tirels, of person like and brethen of bloud, but nothing of kin in conditions.
Then sayde the K. merily to them, what sirs be yée in bed so soone? and calling vp sir Iames, brake to him secretly his minde in this matter.
Wherfore on the morow he sente him to Brakenburie wyth a letter, by which was commaunded to deliuer sir Iames all the Keyes of the Tower for one night, to the ende he might there accomplish the Kings pleasure, in such things as hée had giuen him commaundement.
After which letter deliuered, and the keyes receiued, sir Iames appointed the nighte next ensuing to destroy them, deuising before and preparing the meanes.
The prince as soone as ye protector left ye name, and toke himselfe as king, had it shewed vnto him· that hée shold not raign, but his vncle shold haue ye crown.
At which word, ye Prince sore abashed, beganne to sigh said: Alas, would my vncle woulde let me haue my life yet, though léese my Kingdome.
Then he that told him the tale, vsed hym wyth good wordes, and putte hym in the beste comfort he coulde.
But forthwith was the Prince and his brother both shut vp, and all other remoued from them, onely one called Blacke Will, or William Slaughter except, set to serue them and sée them sure.
After whiche time the prince neuer tyed hys pointes, nor aught roughte of himselfe, but with that yong babe his brother, lingred with thought and heauinesse, til this trayterous death deliuered them of that wretchednesse.
For Sir Iames Tyrell deuised y^ they should be murthered in their beds.
To the execution whereof, hée appointed Myles Forrest, one of the foure that kept them, a fellow fleshed in murther before time.
To him he ioyned one Iohn Dighton his owne horssekéeper, a bigge, brode· square, strong knaue.
Then al the other being remoued from them, this Miles Forrest, and Iohn Dighton, about midnight (the selie childre~ lying in their beddes) came into the Chamber, and sodainly lapped them vp among the clothes, so to bewrapped the~ and intangled them, kéeping downe by force the featherbed and pillowes hard vnto their mouths, that within a while, smothered and stifled, theyr breath fayling, they gaue vp to God their innocente soules into the ioyes of Heauen, leaning to the tormentors their bodyes deade in the bed.
Whiche after that the wretches perceyued, first by the strugling with the paynes of deathe, and after long lying still, to bée throughly deade, they layde their bodies naked out vppon the bed, and fetched Sir Iames to sée them, which vppon the sight of them, caused those murtherers to burie them at the staire foote, méetly déepe in the ground, vnder a great heape of stones.
Then rode Syr Iames in greate haste to King Richarde, and shewed him all the manner of the murther, who gaue him great thankes, (as some say) there made him knight· But he allowed not as haue heard, the burying in so vile a corner, saying, that he woulde haue them buryed in a better place, bycause they were a Kings sonnes.
Whervpon they say, that a Priest of S. Roberte Brakenburie tooke vppe the bodyes again, and secretly enteried them in such place, as by the occasion of his death, which only knew it, coulde neuer since come to light.
Uerye troth is it, and well knowen, that at such time as Sir Iames Tyrel was in the Tower, for Treason committed against the most famous Prince King Henrie the seauenth, both Dighton and he were examined, and confessed the murther in maner aboue writte~, but whether the bodyes were remoued, they coulde nothing tell.
And thus as haue learned of them that muche knewe, and litle cause had to lye were these two noble princes, these innocente tender children, borne of most royal bloud, brought vp in great wealth, likely long to liue, raigne, and rule in the Realme, by trayterous tirannie taken, depriued of their estate, shortly shut vp in prison, and priuely slain and murthered, their bodies cast God wot where, by the cruel ambition of theyr vnnatural vncle and his dispiteous tormentors.
Whiche things on euery part wel pondered, God neuer gaue this world a more notable exa~ple, neither in what vnsuretie standeth this worldlye wea~le, or what mischiefe worketh the proude enterpryse of an high heart, or finallye, what wretched ende ensueth such dispiteous crueltie.
For first to beginne with the Ministers, Miles Forrest, at Saint Martins rotted away.

But Sir Iames Tyrell dyed at the Tower Hil beheaded for treason.
King Richarde himself, as yée shal hereafter heare, in the fielde, hacked and hewed of his enimies hands; caried on Horsseback dead, his heare in despight torne and tagged like a cur dog.
And the mischiefe that hee tooke, was within lesse than thrée yeres of the mischief that he did.
And yet al the mean time, spent in much paine and trouble outward, much feare, anguishe and sorrow within.
For haue hearde by credible report of suche as were secrete with hys Chamberlaine, that after this abhominable déede done, he neuer had quiet in his minde.
Where he went abroade, hys eyen whirled about, hys bodie painely hys hande euer vpon his hys countenaunce and maner like one, alwayes readie to againe, he toke ill rest a nyghtes, lay long waking and musing, wearied with care and watche, rather slumbred than slept, troubled with fearefull dreames, sodainely sometime stert vppe lept out of his bedde, and ranne about the Chamber, so was his restlesse hearte continually tossed and tumbled with the tedious impression and stormie remembraunce of hys abhominable déede.
For herevpon, soone after, began the conspiracie, or rather good confederation, betwéene the Duke of Buckingham, and manye other Gentlemen against him.
The occasion where vppon the King and the Duke fell out, is diuerse folke diuerse wise pretended.
Thys Duke (as haue for certaine ben enformed) as soone as the Duke of Glocester, vppon the death of King Edwarde, came to Yorke, and there had solemne funeral seruice, for King· Edward, sent thyther in the most secret wise he coulde, one Persall· his trustie seruant, who came to Iohn Warde· a Chamberer of like secrete truste with the Duke of Glocester, desiring, that in the most close and couert manner, he might be admitted to the presence and spéech of hys maister.
And the Duke of Glocester, aduertised of hys desire, caused him in the dead of the night· after al other folk auoyded, to be brought vnto him in his secrete Chamber, whe
Persall· after his maisters reco~mendation, shewed hym, that he had secretly sent to shew him in his new world, he would take such partas he woulde; and vpon hym wyth thousande good fellowes, néede were.
The messenger sente backe with thankes, and some instruction of the Protectors minde: yet mette hym agayne with farther fro~ the D. his Master, within few dayes after at Notingha~: whither the Protector from Yorke, with many Gentleme~ of the Northe Countrey, to the number of sixe hundred horses, was come on his waye to London warde, and after secreat méeting and communication had, departed.
Whe~ce vpon at Northampton, the Duke met with the Protector, himself wt thrée hundred Horses, and from thence stil co~tinued with him partner of all his deuises, till y^ after hys Coronation, they departed as it séemed very greate friends at Gloucester.
From whe~ce, assoone as the Duke came home, he so lightlye turned from hym, and so highlye conspired againste him, that a man would maruell whereof the change grewe.
And surely, the occasion of their variance is of dyuers men diuersly reported.
Some said (heard say) yt the Duke a little before the Coronation, among other thinges, required of the Protector the Duke of lands, to the which he pretended himselfe iuste inheritor.
And forasmuch as the title whiche he claymed by inheritance, was somewhat interlaced with the title to the Crowne, by the line of King Henry before depriued, the Protector conceyued suche indignation, that he reiected the Dukes requeste with many spitefull and minatorie wordes, which so wounded his hart with hatred and mistruste, that he neuer after toulde endure to looke a right on King Richard, but euer feared his owne life, so far forth· that when the Protector rode throughe London towarde his Coronation, hée fayned himselfe sicke, bycause he woulde not ride with him.
And the other takyng it in euill parte, sente him worde to rise, and come ride, or he woulde make him be carryed.
Wherevpon, he rode on with euill will, and that notwithstanding on the morrow, rose from the feast; fayning hymselfe sicke, Kyng Richard said, it was done in hatred and despite of him.
And they saide, that euer after continually, of them liued in such hatred distrust of other, that ye Duke loked to haue bin murthered at Glocester.
But surely some right secrete at that daye deny this: and many right wise men thinke it vnlikely, (the déepe dissembling nature of those both men co~sidered, and what néede in that gréene worlde the Protector had of the Duke· and in what perill the Duke stoode, if he fel once in suspition of the Tyrant) that eyther the Protectour woulde giue the Duke occasion of displeasure or the Duke the Protectour occasion of mistruste.
And verylye, men thinke, that if King Richard had anye such opinion conceyued, he would neuer haue suffered him to escape his hands.
Uery troth it is, the Duke was an high minded man, and euill could beare the glorie of an other, so that haue heard of some that say they sawe it, that the Duke at such time as the Crowne was first set vpon the Protectors head, hys eye coulde not abyde the sight thereof, but wryed his heade another waye.
But men saye, that he was of troth not wel at ease, and that both to King Richarde well knowen, and not ill taken, nor any demaunde of the Dukes vncurteously reiected, but he both with greate giftes and high behestes, in most louing and trustie manner, departed at Glocester.
But soone after his comming home to Brecknocke, hauing ther in custodie by the commaundement of King Richarde Doctor Morton, Byshoppe of Ely, who (as yée before hearde) was taken in the Counsel at the tower, waxed with him familiar: whose wisedome abused his pride to his owne deliueraunce and the Dukes destruction.
The Bishop was a man of gret natural witte, very wel learned, and honorable in behauiour, lacking no wise wayes to winne fauour.
He had bin fast vpon the part of King Henrie, while that parte was in wealth, and naythelesse, lefte it not nor forsooke it in woe, but fledde the Realme with the Quéene and the Prince, whyle King· Edwarde hadde the King in prison, neuer came home, but to the fielde.
After whiche loste, and that parte vtterly subdued, the for his fast fayth and wisedome, not onelye was contente to receiue him, but also woed him to come, and hadde him from thenceforth both in secreate trust, and very speciall fauour, whiche he nothing deceiued.
For he being (as ye haue hearde) after King Edwards death firste taken by the tyrante, for hys truth to the King, founde the meane to set this Duke in his toppe, ioyned Gentlemen togither in aide of king Henry, deuising first the marriage betwéene him and King Edwardes daughter, by which his faith, he declared the good seruice to both his masters at once, with infinit benefite to the realm by ye coniunction of those two blouds in one, whose seueral titles had long enquieted the land, he fled the realme, went to Rome, neuer minding more to meddle wite the worlde, till the noble Prince King Henry the seauenth gate hym home agayne, made hym Archebyshoppe of Canterbury, and Chauncelor of Englande, wherevnto the Pope ioined the honor of Cardinal.
Thus, lyuing many dayes in as muche honor as one man mighte well wishe, ended them so godly, that his death with Gods mercie well changed his life.
This man therefore, as was aboute to tell you, by the long and often alternate proofe, as well of prosperitie, as aduers fortune, hadde gotten by greate experience the verye mother and mistresse of Wisedome, a déepe insighte in pollitique worldly driftes.
Whereby, perceyuing nowe thys Duke glad to commune with him, fed him with faire wordes, and many pleasaunt prayses.
And perceyuing by the processe of their communication, the Dukes pride, now and then balke oute a little bredde of enuie, towarde the glorye of the King, and thereby féeling him easie to fall oute if the matter were well handled: he craftely sought the wayes to pricke him forwarde, taking alwayes the occasion of hys commyng, so kéeping himselfe so close within his bounds, that he rather séemed to follow him, then to leade him.
For, when the Duke firste beganne to praise and boast the king, and shewe howe muche profite the Realme shoulde take by his raigne: my Lorde Morton answered: Surely my Lord, it were for me to lye, for if would sweare the contrarie, your Lordship would not wéene beléeue, but that if y^ world would haue gone as wold haue wished, K. Henries son had had the Crown, not King Ed.
But after that God hadde ordered him to loose it, and King Edwarde to raigne, was neuer so madde that woulde with a deade manne striue against the quicke.
So was to King Edward a faithfull Chaplaine, and glad woulde haue bin that his chylde hadde succéeded him.
Howbeit, if the secrete iudgemente of God haue otherwise prouided, purpose not to spurre against a pricke, nor laboure to sette vppe that God pulleth downe.
And euen there he left, saying y^ he had already meddled to muche wyth the world, and would from that day meddle with hys Booke and his beades, and no further.
Then longed the D. sore to heare what he woulde haue sayde, bycause he ended with the King, and there so sodainely stopped, and exhorted him so familiarly betwéene them twayne, to be bolde to say whatsoeuer he thoughte, whereof he faythfullye promised, there shoulde neuer come hurte, and peraduenture more good than he woulde wéene, and that himselfe intended to vse his faithfull secrete aduise and counsell, whiche hée sayde was the only cause for which he procured of the King to haue hym in his custodie, where he might recken himself at home, and else had he bin putte in the handes of them with whome hée shoulde not haue founde the like fauour.
The Bishoppe righte humblye thanked hym, and sayde in good faith my Lord, loue not to talke much of Princes, as a thing not all out of perill, thoughe the worde be wythout faulte, for as muche as it shall not be taken as the partie meane it, but as it pleaseth the Prince to it.
And euer thinke on Esops tale, that when the Lion hadde proclaymed, that on payne of death, there should none horned beast abide in that wood: one that had in his forhead a bunch of flesh, away a great pace.
The Foxe that saw him run so fast, asked him whether he made all that haste? And hée aunswered, In fayth neuer wote, nor recke, so wer once hence, bicause of thys proclamation made of horned beasts.
What foole quoth the Foxe, thou mayst abyde wel ynough, the Lion meant not by thée, for it is none horne that is in thine heade.
But what and he call it an horne, where am then? The Duke laughed merily at the tale, and said, My L.
warra~t you, neyther the Lio~ nor the Bore shall pike any matter at any thing here spoken, for it shal neuer come to their eares.
In good faith Sir sayde the Bishop if it did, the thing that was about to say, taken as well (as afore God, meant) it coulde deserue but thankes.
And yet taken as wéene it woulde, might happen to turne me to little good, and you to lesser.
Then longed the Duke yet muche more to witte what it was, wherevpon the Bishoppe saide, in good faith my Lord, as for the late Protector, sith he is now King in possession, purpose not to dispute his title, but for the weale of this Realme, whereof his grace hath now the gouernaunce, and wherof am my selfe one poore member, was about to wishe, that to those good abilities whereof he hath alredy righte many, little néeding my prayse: it might yet haue pleased God, for the better store, to haue giuen him some of such other excellente vertues, méete for the rule of a realme, as our Lord hath planted in the person of your grace: and there left againe.
The Duke somewhat maruayling at hys sodayne pauses, saide my Lorde note your often breathing and sodayne stoppyng in your communication, so that to my intelligence, your wordes neyther come to anye perfecte sentence, whereby eyther mighte haue knowledge what your entente is nowe towarde the King, or what affection you beare towarde me.
For the comparison of good qualities ascribed to vs both, maketh me not a little to muse thinking y^ you haue some other priuie imagination, imprinted in your hearte, which you be abashed to disclose, and especially to me, which on my honor do assure you to be as secrete in this case as the deafe and dome.
The Byshop being somewhat bolder, considering the Dukes promise, but moste of all animated, bycause he knewe the Duke desirous to be magnified, and also he perceyued the inwarde hatred whiche he bare towarde King Richard, hée opened hys stomake to the botome, and saide, my singular good Lorde, sith the tyme of my whyche béeyng in your Graces custody, maye rather call it a libertie, then a straight imprisonment, in of ydlenesse mother of all vyces, in reading Bookes and auncient Pamphlets, haue founde this sentence written· that no manne is borne frée and at libertie of himselfe onely, for one part of duty he oweth to his parents, an other parte to his friends and kinsfolkes: but the natiue countrey, in the which he firste tasted this pleasaunte and flattering worlde, demaundeth a debte not to be forgotten, whyche saying causeth me to consider in what case this realme my natiue countrey nowe standeth, and in what estate and assuraunce before this time it hathe co~tinued: what gouernor we now haue, and what ruler we might haue, for plainely perceiue (the Realme being in this case) must néeds decay, be brought to confusio~: but one hope haue, that is, whe~ consider youre noble personage, your iustice and indifferencie, your feruent zeale and ardent loue toward your naturall country, in like maner the loue of your countrey toward you, the great learning, pregnant witte, eloquence, which so much doth abounde in your person, muste néedes thinke this realme fortunate, whyche hathe such a Prince in store, méete and apt to be gouernor.
But on the other side, when call to memorie the good qualities of the late Protector, and nowe called King, so violated by tyranny, so altred by vsurped authoritie, so clouded by blinde ambition, muste néedes say, that he is neither méete to be King of so noble a realme, nor so famous a realme méete to be gouerned by such a tyrant: Was not his first enterprice to obtaine the Crowne begunne, by the murther of dyuers noble personages? Did he not secondarily procéed againste his owne naturall mother, declaring hir openlye to be a woman giuen to carnall affection, and dissoulute lyuing, declaring furthermore hys two brethren, and two nephewes, to be Bastardes, and to be borne in yet not contented, after he had obtayned the Garlande hée caused the two pore innocents his nephewes committed to him, to be shamefully murthered, the bloude of whiche little babes dayly cry to God, from the earth for vengeaunce, what sure tie shall be in this realme to any person, eyther for life or goodes vnder suche a cruell Prince, whych regardeth not the destruction of his owne bloud, then the lesse, the losse of other: but nowe to conclude what· meane toward your noble person, say, affirme, if you loue God, your linage, or your natiue cou~try, you must your self take vpon you y^
Crown of this Realme, both for ye maintena~ce of the honour of the same, as also for the deliueraunce of your natural Countreyme~ from the bondage of such a Tyrante.
And if your self wil refuse to take vpon you ye Crown of this Realme.
The~ adiure you by the faith y^ you owe to God, to deuise some way how this realme may be brought to some conuenient regiment, vnder some good gouernour, whe~ the B· had ended his saying, the D. sighed, spake not of a gret while, so y^ night they co~moned ore.
The next daye the Duke sent for the B. vnto whom he sayd, my L. of Ely· must néedes in hart thinke, and with mouth confesse, that you be a sure friende, a trustie counsaylour and a verye louer of your Countrey.
And sith at our last communicatio~, you haue disclosed the secrets of your hart, touching ye new vsurper of the Crowne, and also haue a little touched the auncement of the two noble families of Yorke and Lancaster, shal likewise declare vnto you my priuie entents and secrete cogitations, and to beginne, when King Edwarde· was deceased; then beganne to studye and with deliberation to ponder in what maner this realme shoulde be gouerned.
perswaded wyth my selfe to take part wyth the Duke of Glocester, whom thought to be as cleane without dissimulation, as tractable without iniurie, and so by my means he was made Protector both of the king and realm, whiche auathoritie being once gotten, he neuer ceased printly to require me other Lords, as wel spirituall as temporall, that he might take vppon hym the Crowne, till the Prince came to the age of xxiiij. yeares, and were able to gouerne the realme as a sufficient king, which thing, when he saw me somewhat sticke at; he then brought in instrume~ts, autentike Doctors, Proctors, and notaries of the law, with depositions of diuers witnesses, testifying King Edwardes children to be bastards, whiche depositions then thought to be as true, as nowe knowe them to be fayned.
When the sayde depositions were before vs read and diligentlye hearde, hée stoode vppe bare headed, saying: Well my Lordes, euen as and you would, that my nephewes should haue no wrong: so praye you do me nothing but right, for these witnesses and sayings of famous Doctours be true: for am onelye the vndubitate heyre to RICHARDE PLANTAGENET Duke of Yorke, adiudged to be the verye heire to the Crowne of this realme, by aucthoritie of Parliament.
Whyche thynges, so by learned men for veritie to vs declared, caused me and other to take him for our lawful vndoubted Prince and Soueraigne Lorde: so agayne by my aide, he of a Protector was made a King, but when he was once crowned King, and in full possession of the realme, he caste awaye his olde conditions.
For, when my selfe sued to him for my parte of the Earle of Herefords landes, which his brother Kyng Edward wrongfully detained from me, and also requyred to haue the office of the highe Conestableship of Englande, as diuers of my noble auncestours before this time haue hadde, and in long descent continued, in this my firste sute, hée did not only first delay me, and afterward deny me, but gaue me suche vnkind wordes, as though had neuer furthered him: al which suffred pacie~tly, but whe~ was informed of the death of the two yong innocentes, Lord my heart inwardly grudged, in so much that abhorred ye sight of him.
toke my leaue of the Court, and returned to Brecknocke to you, but in the iourney as returned, had diuerse imaginatio~s how to depriue this vnnatural vncle.
Frst y^ if list to take vpon me the Crowne, now was the way made playne, and occasion giuen.
For sawe he was dysdayned of the Lords temporall, and accursed, of the Lordes spiritual.
After diuerse cogitations of this matter, As rode betwéene Worcester and Bridgenorth· encountred with the Lady Margaret Countesse of Richmonde, now wife to ye Lord Stanley, which is the very daughter and sole heire, to Iohn Duke of Somerset my grandfathers elder brother: so that she and hir sonne the Garle of Richmond, be both betwéene me the gate, to enter into the Maiestie royall, and getting of the Crowne: and when we had a little comoned, concernyng her sonne; and were departed: then beganne to dispute wt my selfe, whether were best to take vpon me, by the election of the nobilitie and communaltie or to take it by power.
thus standing in ye wauering ambiguitie, considered first, y^ dutie, and pain of a King, which surely think that no mortall men can iustlye, and truely obserue, excepte hée elected by GOD as King Dauid was: but further remembred that if once toke on me the gouernaunce of the Realme: the daughters of King Edwarde and theyr Allies, being bothe for hys sake muche helpned, and also for the greate iniurye done to them muche pytied, woulde neuer cease to barke at the one syde of mée.
my coosin the Earle of Richemonde hys aydes, and kinsfolke, wyll surelye attempte eyther to or to pierse mée on the other syde, so that my life and rule shoulde euer hang vnquiet in of deathe or deposition.
And if the sayde two of Yorke and Lancaster, shoulde ioyne in one againste mée, then were surelye matched.
Wherefore haue cléerelye determyned vtterlye to relinquishe all imaginations concerning the obtayning of the Crowne: For as told you, the Countesse of Richmond, in my returne from the newe named King, méeting me in the high waye, prayed me first for kinred sake, secondly for the loue bare to my grandfather Duke Humfrey; whiche was sworne brother to hir father, to moue the King to be good to hir son, Hencie Earle of Richmonde, and to license him with his fauour to returne againe into England, and if it were his pleasure so to doe, she promised that the Earle hir sonne shoulde marrie one of king Edwards daughters at the appointment of the King, without anye thing demaunded for the sayde espousalles, but only the Kings fauoure, whiche request sne ouer passed and departed, but after seruice called to memorie more of that matter, am bente, that the Earle of Richmonde heire of the house of Lancaster, shal take to wife Lady Elizabeth eldest daughter to K. Edwarde, by the which marriage both the houses of Yorke and Lancaster, maye be vnite in one: when the Duke had sayde, the Bishop Morton, whiche fauoured euer the house of Lancaster, ioyfull, for all his imagination tended to this effecte, and least the Dukes courage shoulde swage his minde alter, he sayde to the Duke my Lord of Buckingham, sithe by prouision, and your inco~parable wisedome, thys noble coniunction is first moued, it is necessarie to consider what persons we shall firste make prie of this polliticke conclusion, by my troth quoth the Duke, we will beginne wyth my Ladye of Richmonde the Earles mother, whyche knoweth where he is in Brytaine, sith you will begin that waye (sayde the Byshoppe) haue an olde friende wyth the Countesse called Reignalde Bray, for whom shall send if it be iyoc pleasure· so the Byshoppe wrode for him to come to Breckeke, who streight came backe with the messenger· where the Dirke and Bishoppe declared what they hadde deuised for the prefermente of the Earle of Richmonde sonne to hys· Ladye land Maistresse: willyng hyr firste to compasse howe to obtayne the good wyll of Quéene Elizabeth, and also of hir eldest daughter: and after secretly to send to hir sonne into Britaine to declare what highe honour, was prepared for him, if he would sweare to marrye the Lady Elizabeth as soone as he was King of the Realme.
Reynold Bray with a glad heart returned to the Countesse his Ladie.
When Bray was gone, the Byshoppe tolde the Duke that if he were in his Isle of Elie he could make many friendes to further their enterprise.
The Duke knewe this to be true, but yet lothe to lose the companie of such a counseller, gaue the Byshoppe fayre wordes, saying he shoulde shortly departe well accompanied for feare of enemies, but the Bishop or the Dukes company were assembled, secretly disguised, in a night departed, and came to Elie, where he founde money and friendes, and so sayled into Flaunders, where he did the Earle of Richmond good seruice, when Reynold Bray, had declared his message to the Countesse no maruaile if she were glad, wherefore she deuised a meanes hold to breake this matter to Quéene Elazabeth then being in Sanctuarie at Westminster, And hauing in hir family a certayne called Lewes learned in Phisicke, nowe hauing opportunitie to breake hir minde vnto him, declared that the time was come that hir sonne should bée ioyned in marriage with Ladye Elizabeth daughter and heyre to King Edward: and that King Richard, shoulde out of all honour and estate be detected: and required him to goe to Quéene Elizabeth, not as a messenger, but as one· that came friendly to visite hir, and as tyme and place should serue, to make hir priuie of this deuise.
This Phisition with good diligence repayred to the Quéene, and when he saw tyme conuenient, he said vnto hir: Madame although my imagination be verye simple, yet for the entire affection beare to you and to your children, am so bolde to vtter vnto you a secrete conceit that haue compassed in my brayne.
When remember the great losse that you haue sustayned by the death of your louing husband, and the great sorow that you haue suffered by the cruell murther of your innocent chyldren can no lesse doe than daylye studie howe to bring your heart to comforte, and also to reuenge the quarrell of you and your children on that cruell tyraunt King Richard.
And first consider what battayle and what mischiefe hath risen by the betwéene the two houses of Yorke and Lancaster, which two families if they may be ioyned in one, doubt not but y^ your line shall be againe restored, to your great ioye and comforte.
You knowe Madame that of the house of Lancaster, the Earle of Richmond is nexte of bloud, and to the house of Yorke your daughters nowe are heyres.
If ye coulde inuent the meane howe to couple your eldest daughter with the Earle of Richemond in Matrimonie, no doubt but the vsurper should bée shortly deposed, and your heire agayne to hir ryght restored.
When the Quéene had heard thys friendly motion, shée instantly besought hym that as he had béene the first inuenter of so good an enterprise, that now he would not desist to folow the same, requrring him further, that he would resorte to the Countesie of Richemond mother to the Earle Henrie, and to declare to hir on the Quéenee behalfe, that all the friendes of King Edwarde· hir husband, should assist and take part with the Erle of Richemond hir sonne, so that he woulde take an othe that after the Kingdome obteyned, to espouse the Lady Elizabeth hir daughter, &c.
After Lewes so spedde his businesse that he made a of this busynesse betwéene the two mothers: so the Ladye Margaret Countesse of Richemond brought to a good hope of the preferment of hir sonne, made Reynold Bray chiefe solicitor of this conspiraoie, geuyng hym in charge secretely to inuegle suche persons of Nobilitie to ioyne wyth hir and take hir parte as he knewe to be faythfull.
This Reynold Bray within fewe dayes broughte to his lure, sir Gyles Daubeney, sir Iohn Richard Guilford and Thomas Rame Esquiers others.
In the meane season the Countesse of Richemond seat Christopher Vrfwike into Britaine to the Erle of Richmond, to declare to him all agréementes betwéene hir the Quéene agréed: but she rementbring that the Duke of Buckingham, was one of the first inuentors of this enterprise sent Hugh Conway Esquier into Britaine with a great sum of money to hir sonne, giuyng him in charge to declare to the Earle the great loue that ye most part of the nobilitie of the Realme bare toward him, wylling him not to neglect so good an occasion offered, but with all spéede to fettle his minde how to returne into Englande, giuing him Counsell to take land in Wales.
When ye Earle had receyued this ioyfull message, he brake to the Duke of Britayne all his secretes, aduertising hym that he was entered into a sure and stedfast hope to obtayne the Crowne of England, desiring hym of helpe towarde the atchieuing of his enterprise, which the Duke promised and after performed.
Whervpon the Earle sent into England Hugh Conway, and Thomas Ram, to declare his comming shortly into England.
In the meane season the chiefe of the conspiracie in England beganne many enterprises, which beyng neuer so priuely handled, yet knowledge thereof came to Kyng Richard, and because he knewe the Duke of Buckingham to bée the chiefe heade and ayde of this commination, he thought it most necessarie to plucke hym from that parte, where vppon he adressed his louing letters to the Duke to exhorte the Duke to come to the Courte: but the Duke required the Kyng to pardon hym, excusing himselfe that he was not well.
King Richard not content wyth this excuse, directed to the Duke other letters wyth checkyng wordes commaunding hym wythout delaye to repayre to hys presence.
The Duke made to the messenger a determinate aunswere, that he woulde not come to his mortall enemye: and immediatelye prepared warre agaynste hym, and by this meanes, Thomas Marques Dorset came out of Sancturie, gathered a great bande of men in Yorke shire, syr Edwarde Courtney and Peter his brother Byshoppe of Excester, raysed an other armie in Deuonshire and Cornewall.
In Kent Richard Calfortle and other gentlemen rayses a comparrie.
But King Richarde in the meane tyme had gotten together a great strength, with whom he remoued from London towarde Salisburie, to the entent he myght set on the Dukes army, the King was starce two dayes tourney from Salisburie· when the Duke of Buckingham accompanyed with a great powre of wilde Welchmen which in the ende forsooke him.
The Duke with his powre marched through the forest of Dene intending to haue passed the ryuer of Seuerne at Glocester, and there to haue ioyned in armie with the Courtneys other Westerne men, which if he had done no doubte but King Richard had béene in great ieoperdie: But before he could attayne to Seuerne syde, by force of continuall raine the riuer rose so high that it ouerflowed all the countrey adioyning, which rage of water lasted.
x. dayes, by which inundacie, the passages were so closed that neyther ye Duke could come ouer Seuerne to his complices, nor they to hym, which time the Welchmen lyngering ydle and wythout money or victuall, sodainly scaled and departed.
The Duke thus left almost alone, was of necessitie compelled to flie, and conueyed himselfe into the house of Humfrey Banister his seruaht beside Shrewesburie, whom he had tenderly brought vp, which whe~ it was knowne to his adherents, euery man shifted for himselfe and fled.
And some of them sayled into Britaine, among the which, were Peter Courtney Byshop of Excester, and sir Edward Courtney his brother, Thomas Marques Dorset, Iohn Lord Welles, sir Iohn Bourchier, sir Edmond Woodvile brother to Quéene Elizabeth, sir Robert Willoughbie, sir Gyles Daubney, sir Thomas Arundale, sir Iohn Cheynie and his two: brothren, sir William Barkerley, sir William Brando~ and Thomas his brother, sir Richard Edgecombe, and Iohn Halwell, Edwarde Pownyngs; &c Proclamation was made and a thousande pound promised to who so coulde bring out the Duke of Buckingham, where vpon Humfrey Banister bewrayed his guest and maister to Iohn Mitton then Sherife of Shropshire, whiche with a stronge powre apprehended the Duke in a little groue adioyning to the manors of Humfrey Banister, and in great haste conueyed him to the Citie of Salisburie, where King Richard than kept his housholde.
This Banister after he had betrayed his maister, his sonne and heire waxed mad and dyed in a Bores stye, his eldest daughter was sodainely striken with a foule leperie, his seconde sonne maruellously deformed of his lymmes and made lame, his yonger sonne in a small puddle was drowned, and he himselfe being of extreme age arraygned and found guiltie of a murther and by his clergie saued.
And as for his thousande pounde· King Richarde gaue him not one farthing, saying that he which woulde be vntrue to so good a maister, would be false to all other.
The Duke after he had confessed all the whole conspiracie vpon the second of Nouember without araignement or iudgement was at Salisburie beheaded.
Whilest these things were thus handled in England, Henrie Earle of Richmond prepared an armie of fiue thousand Britons, and fortie wel furnished shippes.
When al thyngs were prepared, and the day of setting forward was appoynted, which was the. xij. of October, the whole armie hoysed vp sayles and tooke the sea, but toward night the wind turned and so huge a tempest arose that the ships were dispersed a sunder: some driuen into Normandie, some againe into Britaine.
In the morning after when the tempest was asswaged, the Earle approched to the South parte of England, at the mouth of the Hauen of Pole in Dorcet, where he might sée all the bankes full of men of warre, appoynted to defend his arriuall, wherfore he gaue charge that no man shoulde lande, vntil such tyme as the whole Nauie were assembled, but after that he perceyued none of his ships to appeare, he hoysed vp Ankers and away, where he arriued safe in Normandie, and returned by lande into Britaine, where he was soone aduertised that the Duke of Buckingham had loste hys head, and that the Marques Dorcet and a great number of Noble men of England had a little before enquired for hym there.
In the meane season King Richarde apprehended in diuers partes of this Realme certaine Gentlemen of ye Earle of Richmondes faction, amongst whom sir George Browne sir Roger Clifford, and, iiij. other were put to death at London y^ iij. of December.
Sir Thomas Sentlegar which had marryed the Duches of Excester the Kings owne sister and T. Rame with diuers other were executed at Excester.
The. xxx. of December was a great fire at Leaden hall in London, where through was brent much housing and all the stocks for gunnes other like prouision belonging to ye citie.
After this King Richard called a Parliament, in y^ which he attainted the Earle of Richemond, and all other persons, which were out of the Realme for feare, or any other cause as enemyes to him and to their natural countrie, and all their landes and goods was confiscate to the Kings vse, and yet notwithstanding he laid on the people a great taxe.
In this troublesome season, nothing was more maruelled at than that the Lorde Stanley had not bene taken, considering the working of the Lady Margaret his wyfe mother· to the Earle of Richemond, but for as muche as the enterpryse of a woman was of hym reputed of no regarde, or estimation, and that the Lorde Stanley, hir husband had purged hym selfe to be innocent of all attemptes by hir committed, it was giuen him in charge to kéepe hir in some secrete place at home, without hauing any seruaunt or company, so that from thence forth shée shoulde neuer send letter to hir sonne or to any of his friendes, by the which the Kyng myghte bée molested, which commaundement was a whyle put in execution.
This yéere King Richard began the high towre at Westminster, which remaineth yet vnfinished.
Also he caused the body of King Henry the sixte to be remoued from Chertesey Abbey in Surrey and to be buried at Windsor, where he nowe resteth, on the. xij. of August.
of Sep. William Collingborne made a Ryme of. iij. of King Richards Cou~sellers, the Lord Louell, sir Richard Ratclife, and sir William Catesby which was: The Ratte the Catte and Louell our dogge, Rule all England vnder the hogge.
For the which he was drawne fro~ Westmin. to the Towre of London and there on y^ hyll hanged, headed quartered.
King Richard considering y^ concluded betwéene Princes are the cause that their Realmes are fortified with a double power, that is to say, with their owne strength, the ayde of their friendes, practised a league with the King of Scots, which not long before had made diuers incursions roades into the Realme of Englande, and therefore sued to haue a truce or peace concluded.
Wherfore Commissioners were appointed which met at Notingham, there in the end concluded for. iij. yéeres on certaine articles.
This peace thus concluded, King Richard nowe doubtyng his owne people, was continually vexed with feare of the returne of the Earle of Richmond and his complices.
Wherfore, nothing was for his purpose more then once agayne with price prayer, to attempt the duke of Britaine in whose territorie y^
Erle then abode, to deliuer him into his hands, wherfore incontinent he sent certaine Ambassadors to the Duke of Britaine, which tooke vpon them that King Richard shoulde yéerely pay and aunswere the Duke of Britaine of al the reuenewes, rentes and profites of the landes possessions as well belonging to the Earle of Richmond, as to any other noble or gentlema~ which then were in the Erles companie, if he after that time would kéepe them in continuall prison and restrayne them from libertie.
The orators furnished with these other instructions ariued in Britaine but could not speake wt the duke, by reason y^ he being weakned by a long and dayly infirmitie, began to waxe ydle of his remembraunce, for whiche cause Peter Landoyse his chiefe Treasurer, ruled all things at his pleasure, vnto whom the English Ambassadors moued to him their message, offering to him the same rewardes and lands that they should haue offered the Duke.
This Peter faythfully promised to accomplishe King Richardes request, so that he kept promise wyth him, but fortune was so fauourable to the publike Weale of England, that this deadly compact tooke none effect, for Iohn Morton Byshop of Elie soiourning then in Flaunders, was of al this craftie deuise certified: wherfore he sent Christopher Vrswike, to declare to the Earle of Richemond all the deceyt, giuing him charge in all hast possible with his company to retire out of Britaine into Fraunce.
When these newes came to the Earle, he incontinent sent to Charles the French king requiring that he and his myght safely passe into Fraunce, which desire was graunted, and the Earle with the rest dispatched as priuily as mought be into Fraunce, no man susspecting their departure.
After this, the Erle tooke his iourney to Charles the Frenche King, to who~ after great thanks giuen, he disclosed the occasion of his accesse to his person.
After that he required of him helpe and succour, to the intent he myghte returne to the Nobilitie of his Realme, of who~ he was generally called to take vpo~ him the Crowne.
King Charles promysed him ayde, and bad hym be of good comforte, for he assured him that he woulde gladly shewe to him his bountifull liberalitie.
Whiles the Earle of Richemond thus attended on the Frenche Court, Iohn Vere Earle of Oxforde so perswaded Iames Blonte Captaine of Hames Castle, and sir Iohn Forteskewe Porter of the Towne of Calleis that he him selfe was not only set at libertie, but they also leauing their fruitfull offices condescended to goe with him into Fraunce to the Earle of Richemond.
In the meane season King Richard was credibly aduertised what promises and othes the Earle and his confederates had made and sworne, and how by the Erles meanes, all the English men were passed out of Britaine into Fraunce.
Wherefore being in manner desperate, imagining howe to infringe the Earles purpose by an other meane, so that by the mariage of Lady Elizabeth his niece, he should pretend no clayme to the Crowne, there came to his minde a thing not onely detestable, but much more cruell to be put in execution, for he cléerelye determined to reconcile to his fauour his brother wife Quéene Elizabeth, and so by that meanes the Earle of Richemond, of the affinitie of his Nice shoulde bée vtterly defrauded, and if no ingenious remedie coulde bée otherwyse inuented, if it shoulde happen Quéene Anne hys wyfe to departe out of this worlde, then he himselfe woulde rather take to wyfe hys cosin and Nice the Ladye Elizabeth, than for lacke of that affinitie the whole Realme shoulde runne to ruyne.
Wherefore hée sent to the Quéene being in Sanctuarie, diuers and often messengers whiche shoulde excuse hym of all things before agaynst hir attempted, and after shoulde so largelye promyse promotions, not onely to hir but to hir sonne Thomas Marques Dorset, that they shoulde bryng hir (if it were possible) into some wan hope.
The Messengers so perswaded the Quéene, that shée beganne somewhat to in so muche that shée faythfully promysed to yéelde hir selfe to the Kyngs wyll and pleasure.
And so shée first delyuered vnto Kyng Richardes handes hir fyue daughters.
Afterwarde shée sent letters to the Marques hir sonne beyng then at Paris wyth the Earle of Richemond, wylling hym in any wyse to repayre into Englande, where for him were prouided great honours, assertayning hym that all offences on both parties were forgiuen and forgotten: After that King Richarde hadde thus pleased the mutable mynde of Quéene Elizabeth, he caused all hir daughters to bée conueyed into his Palace with solempne receyuing.
Nowe nothing was contrarie to his purpose, that his mansion was not voyde of a wyfe: and first abstayned both from the bedde and companye of hys wyfe: after, he complayned to many of the infortunate barrennesse of his wife.
After this, he procured a common rumor to be published among the common people, that the Quéene was dead.
When the Quéen heard tell that so horrible a rumor of hir death was sprong amongst the communaltie, she sore suspected the world to be almost at an ende with hir, and not long after, howsoeuer it fortuned, the Quéene departed out of this life, and was with due solemnitie buryed at Westminster.
The King thus losed out of the bonds of Matrimony, began to cast a fancie to Lady Elizabeth hys Néece, making much suite to haue hir ioyned with him in lawfull Matrimonie: but bycause all men, and the Mayden hir selfe most of all detested thys vnlawfull copulation, hée determined to deferre the matter till he were in a more quiet case, for all thys season he was oppressed with weighty affayres on euery syde, considering that dayly parte of the Nobilitie sayled into France, other priuily fauoured the Earle of Richmond, amongst the noble men whome hée most suspected, these were the principall, Thomas· Lorde Stanley, Sir Wyllyam Stanley hys brother, Gilbert Talbot, and sixe hundred other, of whose purpose, though King Richard were ignorant, yet he gaue no credence to any one of them, and least of all to the Lord Stanley, bycause he was ioyned in Matrimonie wyth the Lady Margaret, mother to the Earle of Richmond, for when the sayde· Lorde Stanley would haue departed into hys Countrey, the King in no wyse woulde suffer hym to departe, before he had lefte as in hostage in the Courte George Stanley, Lord Strange, his first begotten sonne and heire.
Whyle Kyng Richarde was thus troubled, sodeynely hée hearde newes that the Castell of Hames was delyuered into the handes of the Earle of Richmonde, by the meanes of the Earle of Oxford, and that not onely he, but also Iames Blunt, Captayne of the Castell, were fledde into France, to ayde the Earle of Richmond.
Henry Earle of Richmond obteyning of King Charles a small crue of men, and borowing certayne summes of money of hym, and of dyuers other hys priuate friendes, hée departed from the French Court, and came to the Citie of Roane.
Whyle he taryed there, making prouision at Harefleete, in the mouth of the Riuer of Seyne, for all things necessarye for hys Nauye, tydings were broughte to hym, that Kyng Richarde béeyng wythout Children, and a Widdower, intended shortly to marrye wyth Lady Elizabeth, hys brothers daughter, whyche newes, hée tooke of no small momente, for thys thyng onely tooke away from all hys companyous, theyr hope to obteyne an happye enterprise, by reason whereof, hée iudged that all hys friendes in Englande woulde shrinke from him, yet notwithstanding, Earle Henry of Richmonde, bycause he woulde no longer linger and wéerie hys friendes, lyuing betwéene hope and feare, determined in all hast conuenient to sette forwarde, and caryed to hys Shippes armour, weapons, vitiayle, and all other ordinances expedient for warre, which béeyng done, onely accompanyed wyth two thousande men, and a small number of Shyppes, weyed vp hys Anckers, and in the kalendes of August, hée sayled from Harefleete wyth so prosperous a wynde, that the seauenth day after hée arriued in Wales in the euening, at a Port called Milford Hauen, and incontinente tooke lande, and came to a place called Dale, and at the Sunne rising, remoued to Hereford West, where he was receyued of the people wyth great ioy.
From thence, he remoued to Cardigan, fiue mile from Hereford West, whether came to the Earle Richard Griffith with all his men and power.
After him the same day came Iohn Morgan, wyth hys men.
Then the Earle aduanced forwarde, making no abode in anye place, and sodeynly hée was ascertayned that Sir Walter Harbert, and Rice appe Thomas, were in harnesse before hym, readye to encounter wyth hys Armye, and to stoppe theyr passage, Wherefore he first determined to set vpon them, and eyther to destroye or to take them into his fauour, and after with all hys power to gyue battayle to King Richarde.
But to the intent his friendes shoulde knowe with what he attempted his enterprise forwarde, he sent messengers with letters and instructions to the Ladye Margaret his mother, to the Lorde Stanley and his brother, to Talbot and to other, declaring to them, that he holpe with the ayde of his friendes, intended to passe ouer the riuer of Seuerne at Shrewsburie, and so to passe directly to the Citie of London, requiring them as his speciall trust was in the hope of their fidelitie, that they woulde méete him by the waye with all diligent preparation.
When these messengers were departed, he marched forward towardes Shrewsburie, in his passage there mette and saluted him Rice ap Thomas with a goodly band of Welchmen, which submitted himselfe whole to his order and commaundement.
In the meane tyme the messengers laden with rewardes returned to him the same daye that he entred into Shrewsburie, and made relation to him that his friendes were readie in all poyntes to doe all things for him which they myghte doe.
The Earle Henrie continued his iourney and came to a little towne called Newporte, and pitched his campe on a little hyll adioyning, reposing himselfe there that nyghte.
In the Euenyng of the same day came to him sir George Talbot with the whole power of the young Earle of Shrewsburie, then beyng in warde, which were accounted.
And thus his power increasing he arriued at the Towne of Stafforde, and there paused.
To whome came sir William Stanley accompanyed with a fewe persons.
After that the Earle departed from thence to Lytchfield and lay without the walles in campe all that night.
The next morning he entred the towne and was lyke a Prince receiued.
day or two before the Lorde Stanley hauing in his band almost fiue thousand men, lodged in the same towne, but hearing ye the Earle of Richemond was marching thetherward, gaue to hym place, dislodging him and his, and repaired to a towne called Adrestone, there abiding the comming of ye Earle, and this he did to auoyde all suspition, being afraide least if he should be séene openly to be a fawtor or ayder to the Earle his sonne in law before the day of batiayle, that King Richard which yet did not vtterly put in him mistrust, woulde put to some cruel death his sonne heire appara~t George Lord Strange, whom King Richard had in hostage.
King Richard at this season kéeping his house in the Castle of Notingham was informed that the Earle of Richmond with such banished men as were fled out of England to him, were arryued in Wales, and that all things necessarie to his enterprise were vnpurueyed and very weake, nothing méete to withstande the power of suche as the King hadde appointed to resist him, yet notwithstandyng he sent to Iohn Duke of Norfolke, Henrie Earle of Northumberlande, Thomas Earle of Surrey, and to other of hys trustie friendes, willyng them to muster and viewe all theyr seruauntes and tenaunts, and to electe the moste couragious and actiue persons of the whole number, and with them to repaire to his presence with al spéede.
Also he wrote to Robert Brakenburie Lieutenaunt of ye Tower, commaundyng him with his power to come to his armie to bring with him his fellows in armes T. Bouchier, and sir Walter Hungerford and diuers other Knights Esquiers in whom he had cast no small suspition.
While he was thus ordring his affayres, tidings came that the Earle of Richmond was passed Seuerne, and come to Shrewsburie with out any detriment or encombraunce.
At which message he was sore mooued, and cryed out on them that contrarie to their othe had deceyued him, and in all haste sent out to viewe what way his enemyes kepte and passed: it was declared to the king, that the Earle was encamped at ye towne of Litchfield.
Wherof, whe~ he had perfect knowledge, he hauing co~tinuall repayre of his subiects to him, he inco~tinently made his battayles to set forwarde toward ye way where his enimies (as was to him reported,) intended to passe, and kéeping his array, he with great pomp entred y^ towne of Leycester after the Sunne set.
The Earle of Richmond reysed his Campe from Lichfield to Tomworth, and in the midde way passing, there saluted him Sir Walter Hungerford, and Sir Thomas Bourchier Knightes, and diuers others, which submitted themselues to his pleasure.
Diuers other noble personages likewise resorted to him withall their power.
There hapned in this progression to the Earle of Richmond a strange chance, for he was not a little afrayd, bycause he could not be assured of his father in law Thomas Lord Stanley, whiche as yet enclyned to neyther partie, wherfore the Earle, accompanyed with twenty light horsemen, lingring in his iourney behind his host, in the meane while, the whole armie came before the Towne of Tomworth· and when he for darkenesse coulde not perceyue the steppes of them that passed on before, and had wandred hyther and thither séeking after his companye, he abode in a little Uillage, about thrée miles from his armie, where he tarried all night.
The next morning in the dawning, he returned, and by good fortune came to his Armie, excusing himselfe, not to haue gone out of his way by ignorance, but of purpose: this excuse made, he priuily departed agayne to the downe of Aderstone, where the Lorde Stanley, and Sir William his brother, with their bands, were abiding: then the Earle came to his father in law, in a little Close, where he saluted him and Sir William his brother, and after consulted how to giue battayle to King Richard, if he would abide, whome they knew, not to be farre off with an huge armie.
In the euening of the same day· Sir Iohn Sauage, Sir Brian Sir· Simon Digby, and many other, leauing King Richarde, turned, and came to the Earle of Richmond with an elect companye of men.
In the meane season, King Richard marched to a place méete for two battayles to encounter, by a Uillage called Bosworth, not farre from Leycester, and there he pitched his field, refreshed his Armie, and tooke his rest.
The next day after, King Richard being furnished with men, and all abiliments of warre, bringing all his men out of their Camp into ye playne, ordered his forewarde in a maruellous length, in which he appoynted both horsemen and footemen, and in the forefront he placed the Archers.
Ouer this battayle was Captayne Iohn Duke of Norffolke, with whome was Thomas Earle of Surrey hys sonne.
After this long vauntgard followed King Richarde with a strong company of approued men of warre, hauyng horsemen for wings on both sides of his battayle.
After that the Earle of Richmond was returned from the communication wyth hys friendes, hée wyth all diligence pitched hys Fielde iust by the Campe of hys Enimies, and there he lodged that nighte.
In the morning betime· he caused hys men to put on theyr armour, and apparrell themselues to fight and gyue battayle, and sente to the Lorde Stanley, requiring hym wyth hys men to approche néere to hys armye, and to helpe to set the Souldyers in array: he answered, the Earle shoulde sette hys owne men in good order, whyle hée woulde come to hym in tyme conueniente.
The Earle made hys somewhat single and slender, according to the small number of hys people.
In the front hée placed the Archers, of whome hée made Captayne Iohn Earle of Oxforde.
To the right wing of the Battayle he appoynted Sir Gilbert Talbot to be the leader.
To the lefte wing he assigned Sir Iohn Sauedge, and hée wyth the ayde of the Lord Stanley, accompanyed wyth the Earle of Pembrooke, hauyng a good companye of horssemen, and a small number of footemenne, for all hys whole number excéeded not fyue thousande menne, besyde the power of the Stanleys, whereof thrée thousand were in the fielde vnder Sir William Stanley.
When both these Armyes were thus ordred, and all men ready to set forwarde, King Richard called hys Chiefetaynes togyther, perswadyng them to be valiaunt, &c.
But his people were to him vnfaythfull in his ende, as he was to hys Nephewes, vntrue and vnnaturall in his begynnyng.
When the Earle of Richmond knewe that the King was so néere embattayled, he rode aboute hys armie giuyng comfortable wordes to all men, after the whiche he made to them a pithie Oration, perswadyng them to haue the victorie, for that they were to fyght in a iust quarrell, he had scantlye finished hys saying, but the one armye espyed the other: betwéene bothe armyes there was a great marrishe which the Earle lefte on hys ryght hande, and so doyng, he hadde the Sunne at hys backe, and in the face of hys enemyes.
When the King sawe the Earles companye was passed the marrishe, he commaunded wyth all haste to set vpon them: the terrible shotte on both sides passed, the armyes ioyned and came to hande strokes, at whiche incounter the Lorde Stanley ioyned with the Earle.
The Earle of Oxforde in the meane season fearing least while his company was fighting, they should be compassed of the enemies, gaue commaundement that no man should go aboue. x. foote fro~ the Standard, which commaundement once knowne, they themselues together ceased a litle fro~ fighting: the enemies sodainely abashed at the matter mistrusting some fraude, began also to pause.
The Earle of Oxford bringing all his band together on the one part, set on his enemies freshly: againe the aduersaryes perceyuing that, placed their men slender and thinne before, and thicke and broade behynde, begynnyng agayne the battayle.
Whyle the two fore wardes thus mortally foughte, Kyng Richarde was admonished that the Earle of Richmond accompanyed wyth a small number of men of armes was not farre of, and as he approched to hym, he perfectly knewe hys personage, and béeyng inflamed with yre, he put hys spurres to hys horse and rode out of the side of the range of his battayle, leauyng the vauntgardes fighting, and wyth wrest ranne towarde him.
The Earle perceyued well the King comming towarde him, and bycause the whole hope of his wealth and purpose was to bée determined by battayle, gladlye encounter with him body to body and man to man, King Richarde set on so sharply at the first brunt, that he ouerthrew the Earles standard, and slew sir William Brandon his sta~derdbearer· and matched hand to hande with sir Iohn Cheny, a man of great force and strength· which would haue him, and the saide Iohn was by him man fully ouerthrowne, and so he making open passage by dint of sworde as he went forwarde, the Earle of Richmonde withstoode hys violence and kept him at the swords point longer than his companions thought, which being almost in dispaire of victorie were sodainelye recomforted by sir William Stanley, whiche came to succour with
tall men, at which very instaunt, King Richards men were driuen backe and fled, and he himselfe manfully fighting in the middle of his enimies was flaine.
In the meane season the Earle of Oxforde, with the ayde of the Lorde Stanley after no long fight the fore ward of King Richarde, wherof a greate number were slaine in the chase, but the greatest number yt came to the fielde neuer gaue stroke.
In this battaile died fewe aboue the number of a M. persons, and of the Nobilitie were flaine Iohn Duke of Norffolke, Walter Lord· Ferrers of Chartley, sir Richarde Ratclife, and Robert Brakenburie, liuetena~t of the Tower, and not many Gentlemen moe, sir William Catesby, learned in the lawes of the Realme, and one of the thiefe Counsellours to the late King, with diuerse other were two dayes after beheaded at Leicester.
Amongst them that ranne awaye were· Syr Frauncis Vicount Louel and Humfry Stafforde with Thomas Stafford his brother, which toke Sanctuarie in Saint Iohns at Glocester.
persons, amongst who~ the principal was sir William Brandon his standardbearer.
When the Earle had thus obtained the victorie, he rendered thankes to God, and after in his souldiours for their litie: then the people cryed King Henry, King Henry.
When the Lord Stanley sa the good will of the people, he tooke the Crowne of Kyng Richarde, whiche was founde amongest the spoile in the fielde, and sette it on the Earles head, as thoughe hée had béene elected Kyng by the voyce of the people.
After this, the whole campe remoued to the Towne of Leicester, where he rested two dayes.
In the meane season, the dead corps of King Richarde was as shamefully carryed to the towne of Leicester, as he gorgeouslye the daye before with pompe departed out of the same towne: for his was naked to the skinne, not so muche as one clowte aboute hym; and was trussed behinde a Pursiuant of armes, like a hogge or calfe, the head and armes hanging on the one side of the horsse, and the legs on the other side, and all sprinckled with myre and bloud, was brought to the Gray Friers Church within the town, and there homely buried, when he had raigned two yeres, two moneths, and one daye.
Henrie, Erle of Richmonde [Figure: HEnry the seauenth, borne in Penbrooke Castell, began his raigne the xxij. of Auguste, in the yeare of oure Lorde God.
He was a Prince of maruellous wisedom, policie, iustice, temperaunce, and grauitie, and notwithstandyng manye and greate occasions of trouble and warre, he kept his realme in right good order, for the which he was greately reuerenced of forraine Princes.
On the forenamed xxij. of August, was a greate fyre in of London, in the whiche fire, was brente the Parson of Saint Mildreds, and one other man in the Parsonage there.
King Henry, before his departure from Leicester, sente sir Robert Willoughbey knight, to the Manour of Sherenton in Yorke, for Edwarde Plantagenet Earle of Warwike, sonne and heire to George Duke of Clarence, then being of the age of fifteene yeares, and sente him vppe to the Tower of London, where he was put vnder sure custody.
In the meane season the Kyng remoued towards London, and when he had approched the Citie, on the
of August, the Maior, magistrates, and companies, all clothed in violet, met him at Shoredich· and with great pompe conueyed him through the Citie to Saint Paules Church, where hée offered his thrée standards, one of Saint George, the seconde a red Dragon, the thirde a dun his prayers saide and Te Deum sung, he departed to the Bishoppes Pallaice, where he soiourned a season.
The Sweating beganne the one and twentith of September, and continued till the ende of October: of ye which sicknesse, a wonderfull number dyed, and in London besids other, dyed Thomas Maior, in whose place was chosen William Stocker, who likewise deceased about seauen dayes after, in which space departed other foure Aldermen, Thomas Ilam, Richard Ramson, Thomas Norland, and Iohn Stocker, and then was chosen Maior, Iohn Warde, who continued til the feast of Simon and Iude.
On the euen of Sainte Simon and Iude king Henrie came from Kenington his house, vnto Lambeth, and there dyned wt Thomas Bourcher Archbishoppe of Canterburie, Cardinal of Saint Ciria in Thermis.
And after dinner with a goodlye company of the estates of this Realme both spirituall and temporal, from thence we~t to the Tower of London by land, ouer London bridge, his nobles riding after the guise of Fra~ce, vpon small Hackneys, two and two vppon a Horsse, and at London Bridge ende the Maior of London with his brethren and the Craftes, met and receyued the King, and the King procéeded to Grace Church corner, and so to the Tower.
On the morrowe being the feast daye of Simon and Iude, King Henrie created Thomas Lord Stanley Earle of Darby, Edwarde Courtney Earle of Deuonshire, and Iasper Earle of Penbroke, was created Duke of Bedforde, all at one time in the Tower of London.
On the thirtith of October King Henrie was Crowned at Westminster, and ordayned a number of chosen Archers, being strong and hardie persons, to giue dayly attendaunce on his Parson, whome he named Yeomen of the Guarde.
The seauenth of Nouember beganne a Parliamente at for the establishing of all things, in the whiche he caused to be proclaimed, that al men were pardoned of al offences, and shoulde be restored to their landes and goods, which would submit themselues to his clemency.
After this he began to remember his especial friendes, of whom some he aduannced to honor and dignitie, and some he enriched with possessions and goods: and to beginne, the Lord Chandew of Brytaine, he made Earle of Bath: sir Gyles Dawbeney was made Lord Dawbeny: sir Robert Willoughby Lorde Broke: and Edward Stafford eldest sonne to Henrie late D. of Buckingham, he restored to his dignitie and possessions.
The Parliament being dissolued, the King redéemed the Marques Dorset, and sir Iohn Bourcher, whom he had left as pledges at Paris, for mony there before borrowed.
And sent also into Flaunders for Iohn Morton Byshop of Ely.

In the moneth of May, Charles Duke of Suffolke wedded the Lady Mary the Kings sister, late Quéene of Fraunce.
And héere thinke good to set downe some part of the procéedings of this so oft named Thomas Wolsey Archbishop, his ascending vnto honorious estate, and sodeiue falling againe from the same, as haue bin enformed by persons of good credite.
This Thomas Wolsey was a poore mans sonne of Ipswich, in the Countie of Suffolke, and there borne, and being but a child, very apt to be learned, by the meanes of his parents he was conuayde to the Uniuersitie of Oxford, where he shortly prospered so in learning, as he was made Batcheler of Art, when he passed not fiftéene yeares of age, and was called most commonly through the Uniuersitie the boy Batcheler.
Thus prospering in learning, he was made fellow of Maudelin Colledge, and afterward appoynted to be Schoolemayster of Maudelin Schoole, at which time, the Lorde Marques Dorcet hadde thrée of his sonnes there Schoole, committing vnto him as well their education, their instruction.
It pleased the sayde Lorde Marquesse a·gainst a Christmas season to send as well for the Schoolemayster, as for his children home to his house for their creation, in that pleasant and honourable feast.
Then béeing there, the Lorde their father perceyuing them to right well employed in learning for their time, he hauing a Benefice in his gift, being at that time voyde, gaue same to the Schoolemaister in reward of his diligence at his departure after Christmas to the Uniuersitie, and hauing the presentation thereof, repaired to the Ordinarie for induction, and being furnished of his instruments, spéede to the Benefice to take possession, and being there that intent, one Sir Iames Paulet Knight dwelling there about, tooke occasion against him, and set the Schoolemayster by the héeles during his pleasure, which after was neyther forgotten nor forgiuen: for when the Schoolemayster mounted the dignitie to be Chancellour of England, he sente for Mayster Paulet, and after many sharp words, enioyned him to attend vntill he were dismissed, and not to depart out of London without licence obteyned, so that he continued therewith in the middle Temple the space of fiue or sixe yeares, who lay then in the Gate house next the stréete, which hée reedifyed very sumptuously, garnishing the same all ouer the outside with the Cardinals Armes, with his hatte, cognisances, and other deuises in so glorious a sorte, that he thought thereby to haue appeased his olde displeasure.
Now after the deceasse of the Lorde Marquesse, thys Schoolemayster considering with himselfe to be but a simple beneficed man, and to haue lost his fellowship in the Colledge, which was much to his reliefe, thought not long to be vnprogided of some other help, and in his trauell thereabout, he fell in acquayntance with one Sir Iohn Naphant, a very graue and auntient Knight, who had a great me in Caleis vnder King Henry the seauenth, this Knight hée serued, and behaued hymselfe so discretely, that he obteyned the especiall fauour of his Mayster, in so muche, that he committed all the charge of hys office vnto hys Chaplayne, and as vnderstand, the office was the Treasureship of Caleis, who was in consideration of hys greate age discharged of hys roome, and returned agayne into Englande, and through hys instant labour, hys Chaplayne was promoted to bée the Kyngs Chaplayne, and when hée had once cast Ancker in the porte of promotion, how he wrought, shall somewhat declare.
He hauing there a occasion to be in the sight of the King dayly, by reason hée sayde Masse before hym in hys Closet, and that done, he spe~t not the day in ydlenesse, but would attend vpon those whome he thought to beare most rule in the Counsell, the which at that tyme was Doctor Fox, Bishop of Winchester, Secretarie, and Lord of the priuie seale: also Sir Thomas Louell Knight, a sage Counsellor, Mayster of the Wardes, and Connestable of the Tower: these graue Counsellors in proces of time perceyued this Chapleyne to haue a very fine witte, and thought him a méete person to be preferred to wittie affaires.
It chanced at a certayne season that the King had an vrgent occasion to send an Embassador vnto the Emperour Maximilian, who lay at that present in the low Countrey of Flanders, not farre from Caleis.
The Bishop of Winchester, and Sir Thomas Louell, whome the King counselled and debated with vppon this Embassage, saw they had a conuenient occasion to preferre the Kings Chapleyne, whose witte, eloquence, and learning, they highly commended to the King, the King commanded them to bring his Chapleyne before his presence, with whome, he fell in communication of great matters, and perceyuing his witte to be very fyne, thoughte hym sufficiente, commaunding hym therevpon to prepare hymselfe to hys iourney, and hauing hys depeach, tooke hys leaue of the King at Richmond about noone, and so came to London about four of the Clocke, where the Barge of Graues ende was ready to launch forth, both with a prosperous tyde and winde, without any abode he entred the Barge, and so passed foorth with suche spéede, that hée arriued at Graues ende within little more than thrée houres, where hée tarryed no longer than his post Horsses were prouiding, and then trauayled so spéedily, that hée came to Douer the nexte morning, whereas the passengers were readye vnder Sayle to Caleis, into the which passenger, without tarrying, he entred, and sayled foorth wyth them, that long before noone hée arriued at Calleis, and hauing post Horsses, departed from thence with such spéede, that he was that night with the Emperour, disclosed the whole summe of his Embassage to y^
Emperor, of whom he required spéedie expedition, the which was granted him by the Emperour, so that the next day he was cléerely dispatched with all the Kings requestes fully accomplished, at which time he made no longer delay, but tooke post Horsses that night, and rode towarde Caleis, conducted thyther with such persons as the Emperour had appoynted, and at the opening of the Gates of Caleis, he came thither, where the passengers were as readie to returne into England, as they were before at his iourney forward, in so muche, that he arriued at Douer by tenne of the clocke before noone, and hauing post Horsses, came to the Court at Richmond the same night, where he taking some rest vntill the morning, repayred to the King at his first comming from his bedchamber to this closet, whome, when the King sawe, hée checked him, for that he was not on his iourney: Sir (quoth he) if it may please youre Highnesse, haue already bin with the Emperour, and dispatched your affayres, trust to your Graces contentation, and with that presented the King his Letters of credence from the Emperoure.
The King being in a great confuse and wonder of his spéedy returne and procéedings, dissembled all his wonder, and demanded of him whether he encountred not his Pursiuant the which he sent vnto him, supposing him not to be out of London, with Letters concerning a very necessary matter neglected in their consultatio~, yes forsooth quoth the Chaplayne, met with him yesterday by the way, and hauing no vnderstanding by your Graces letters of your pleasure, haue not withstanding bin so bold vpon mine owne discretion (perceyuing that matter to be very necessary in that behalfe) to dispatch the same, and forasmuch as haue excéeded your Graces commission, most humbly require your Graces pardon: the King reioycing not a little, sayd, we· do not only pardon you thereof, but also giue you our Princely thankes, both for the procéeding therein, and also for your good and spéedie exployte, commanding him for that time to take his rest, and repaire agayne after Dinner, for the further relation of his Ambassade.
The Embassador when he saw tyme, repaired before the King and Counsayle, where he declared the effect of all his affaires so exactly, with such grauitie and eloquence, that all the Counsell that heard him, commended him, estéeming his expedition to be almost beyond the capacitie of man.
The King gaue him at that time the Deanerie of Lincolne.
From the~ce forward he grew more and more into estimation and authoritie, and after, was promoted by the King to be hys Almoner.
After the death of King Henry the seauenth, and in the flourishing youth of King Henry the eyght, thys Almoner handled himselfe so politiquely, that he soone found the meanes to be made one of the Kings Counsaile, and to grow in fauour with the King, to whome, the King gaue an house at Bridewell in Fleete streete, sometyme Sir Richard Empsons, where he kept house for his familie, and so dayly attended vpon the King, and in his especiall fauour, who had great sute made vnto him.
His sentences, and wittie perswasions in the Counsell Chamber, were alwayes so pithie, that the Counsayle as occasion moued them, continually assigned him to be the expositor to the King in all their procéedings, in whome, the King receyued such a leaning fantasie, for that he was most earnest and readyest of all the Counsayle to aduance the Kings will and pleasure: the King therefore estéemed him so highly, that all the other Counsaylors were put from the great fauour that they before were in, in so much, that the King committed all his will vnto his disposition, which the Almoner perceyuing, tooke vpon him therefore to discharge the King of the weightie and troublesome businesse, the King that he should not néede to spare any time of his pleasure for any businesse that should happen in the Counsell: and whereas the other Counsaylours would diuers times perswade the King to haue sometime recourse into the Counsell Chamber, there to heare what was done, the Almoner would perswade him to the contrarie, which delighted him much: and thus the Almoner ruled all them that were before him, such did hys policie and witte bring to passe.
Who was now in hygh fauoure but Maister Almoner? and who ruled all vnder the King, but Maister Almouer? thus he perseuered in fauour, vntill at last in came presents, giftes, and rewards so plentifully, that he lacked nothing that might eyther please his fantasie, or enrich his coffers.
And thus procéeding in fortunes blisfulnesse, it chanced the warres betwéene the Realmes of Englande and France to be open, in so much, as the King béeing fully perswaded in hys most royall person to inuade hys foraigne enimies with a puissant Armye, wherefore it was necessarye that thys royall enterprise shoulde bée spéedily prouided and furnished in euery degrée of things apt and conueniente for the same, the expedition whereof, the King thought no mans witte so méete for policie and paynefull trauayle, as was hys Almoner, to whome therefore he committed hys whole trust therein, and hée tooke vpon hym the whole charge of all the businesse, and brought all things to good passe in a decent order, as all manner of victualles, prouisions, and other necessaryes conueniente for so noble a voyage and Armie.
All things béeyng by hym perfected, the King aduanced to hys royall enterprise, passed the Seas, and marched forwarde in good order of battayle, vntill hée came to the strong Towne of Turwyne, to the whyche hée layde hys séege, and assayled it very strongly continually with such vehemente assaultes, that within short space it was yéelded vnto hys Maiestie, vnto the which place, the Emperour Maximilian repaired vnto the King with a greate Armie like a mightie Prince, taking of the King his Graces wages, which is a rare thing, and but seldome séene, an Emperour to fighte vnder a Kings Banner.
Thus after the King, had obteyned this puissant Fort, and taken the possession thereof, and sette all thynges there in due order, for the defence and preseruation thereof to hys vse, he departed thence, and marched towarde the Citie of Turney, and there layde hys séege in like manner, to the which, he gaue so fierce and sharpe assault, that they were constreyned of fine force to render the Towne vnto his victorious Maiestie, at which time, the King gaue the Almoner the Bishoprike of the same Sea, towards hys paynes and diligence susteyned in that iourney, and when the King had established all things agréeable to his will and pleasure, and furnished the same with noble Captaynes and men of warre for the safegard of the Towne, hée returned agayne into Englande, taking with him diuers noble personages of France being prisoners, as the Duke of Longuile, and Uicount Clarimont, with other, whiche were taken there in a Skirmishe: after whose returne, immediately the Sea of Lincolne fell voyde by the death of Doctor Smith late Bishop there, the which Benefice his Grace gaue to his Almoner, late Bishop of Turney elect, who was not negligent to take possession thereof, and made all the spéede he could for hys consecration: the solemnization whereof ended, he found the meanes that he gate the possession of all his predecessors goodes into his hands.
It was not long after that Doctor Bambridge Archbishop of Yorke dyed at Rome, being there the Kings Embassador, vnto the which Sea, the King immediately presented hys late and newe Bishop of Lincolne, so that he had thrée Bishoprickes in his hands in one yeare giuen hym: then prepared he for his translation from the Sea of Lincolne, vnto the Sea of Yorke, after whiche solemnization done, he béeing then an Archbyshop Primas Angliae, thought himselfe sufficiente to compare with Canterbury, and therevppon erected hys Crosse in the Court, and euery other place, as well within the precinct and iurisdiction of Canterbury, as in anye other place.
And for as muche as Canterbury claymeth a superioritie ouer Yorke, as ouer all other Bishoprikes within Englande, and for that cause claymeth as a knowledge of an aunciente obedience of Yorke, to abate the aduauncing of hys Crosse, in presence of the Crosse of Canterburie: notwythstanding, Yorke nothing minding to desiste from bearing thereof in manner as sayde béefore, caused hys Crosse to be aduaunced, as well in the presence of Canterburie as elsewhere: wherefore Canterburie being moued therewith, gaue vnto Yorke a certayne checke for hys presumption, by reason whereof, there engendred some grudge betwéene Yorke and Caunterburie.
Yorke intending to prouide some suche meanes, that hée woulde bée rather superior in dignitie to Canterburie, than to be eyther obedient or equall to hym, wherefore hée obtayned to be made Prieste Cardinall, and Legatus de Latere: vnto whome the Pope sente a Cardinals Hat wyth certayne Bulles for hys aucthoritie in that behalfe.
Yet you shall vnderstande, that the Pope sente hym thys worthye Hatte of dignitie, as a Iewell of hys honoure and aucthoritie, the whych was conueyed in a varlets budget, who séemed to all menne to bée but a person of small estimation.
Wherfore Yorke beyng aduertised of the basenesse of this messenger, and of the peoples opinion, thought it méete for hys honour, that this Iewell should not be conueyed by so simple a person, therefore caused him to be stopped by the way immediatly after his arriualin England, where he was newly furnished in all manner of apparell, wyth all kynde of costlye silkes, whyche séemed decent for suche an hyghe Embassador, and that done, he was encountred vppon Blacke heath, and there receyued wyth a greate assemblye of Prelates, and lustie gallant Gentlemen, and from thence conducted throughe London with greate triumph.
Then was greate and spéedie preparation made in Westminster Abbey, for the confirmation and acceptance of thys hygh order and dignitie, the whyche was executed by all the Byshoppes and Abbots aboute or nyghe London, wyth theyr rych Myters and Copes, and other ornaments, which was done in so solempne a wise, as had not bene séene the like, vnlesse it had bin at the Coronation of a myghty Prince or King obtayning thys dignitie.
He thoughte himselfe to beare aucthoritie among the temporall power, as among the spirituall iurisdiction: wherefore, remembring as well the tawntes sustained of Canterburie, as hauing a respecte to the aduauncement of worldlye honor and promotion, found the means with the King, that he was made Lord Chancelour of Englande, and Canterburie whiche was Chanceloure dismissed, who had continued in that roume since long before the deceasse of Henrie the seauenth.
Nowe being in possession of the Chancelorshippe, and endued wyth the promotions of the Archebyshoppe, and Cardinall de Latere, hauyng power to correcte Canterburie, and al other Byshops and spirituall persons, to assemble hys Conuocation when he would assigne, hée tooke vpon hym the correction of matters in all their iurisdictions, and visited all the spirituall houses, hauing in euerye Diocesse all maner of Spirituall Ministers, as Commissaries, Scribes, Apparators, and al other officers to furnish hys Courts, and presented by preuention whom he pleased vnto al benefices throughout all thys Realme.
And to the aduauncing further of his legantine, iurisdiction and honor, he hadde Maisters of his Faculties, Maisters Ceremontarum, and suche other, to the glorifying of his dignitie.
Then had he his two great Crosses of Syluer, the one of hys Archebyshopricke, the other of hys Legacie, borne before him whyther so euer he wente or rode, by two of the tallest Priestes that hée coulde gette wythin the realme: And to encrease his gaines, he had also the Byshopricke of Durham, and the Abbey of Saint Albons in commendation: And after, when Doctor Foxe Byshop of Winchester dyed, he surrendred Durham into the Ryngs handes, and tooke to him Winchester.
Then had he in hys hande (as it were in Firme) the Bishoprickes of Bathe, Worcester, and Hereforde, sorasmuch as the Incumbents of them were strangers, and made their abode continually beyond the Seas in their owne Countries, or else at Rome, from whence they were sente in Legation to thys Realme vnto the King, and for their rewarde at their departure, Kyng Henrie the seauenth gaue those Bishoprickes: and they béeing strangers, thoughte it more méete for the assuraunce to suffer the Cardinal to haue their benefices for a conuenient summe of mony payd them yearely, where they remayned, than either to be troubled with the charges of the same, or to be yearely burdened with the conueyance of theyr reuenues vnto them, so that al the spiritual and presentations of these Byshoprickes were fully in hys disposition, to prefer whom he listed.
He had also a greate number daylye attending vpon hym, both of Noble men and worthye Gentlemen, with no small number of the tallest Yeomen that he coulde gette in all the Realme, insomuche, that well was that Nobleman and Gentleman, that coulde prefer a tall Yeoman to his seruice.
Ye shal vnderstande, that he had in his Hall continually thrée boordes, kepte with thrée seueral principall officers, that is to say, a Stewarde whych was alwayes a Priest: a Treasourer a Knight: and a Comptroller an Esquier: also a Cofferer béeyng a Doctor: thrée Marshalles: thrée yeomen Ushers in the Hall, besides two groomes, and Almoners.
Then in the Hal Kitchen, two Clearks of the kitchen: a Clearke comptroller: a Surueyor of the Dressor: a Clearke of the Spicerie, the whyche togither kepte also a continuall messe in the Hal.
Also in hys Hall kitchin hée had of Maister Cookes twoo, and of other Cookes, Laborers, and children of the kitchin, twelue persons: foure yeomen of the Scullerie: and foure yeomen of the siluer Scullerie: two yeomen of the Pastry, with two other Pastelers vnder the yeomen.
Then in his priuie Kitchin a Master Cooke, who went daylye in Ueluet or in Sattin, wyth a Chayne of Golde, wyth two other yeomen and a groome: In the Scalding house a yeoman and twoo groomes: In the Pantery twoo persons: In the Buttrey two yeomen, two Groomes, and twoo Pages: And in the Yewrye lykewise: In the Seller thrée yeomen and thrée pages: In hys Chaundrey two: In the Wafarie two: In the Wardrobe of Beddes, the Maister of the Wardrobe and other persons: In the Laundry, a yeoman, a groome, thirtie pages, two yeomen purueyors, and one groome: In the Bake house a yeoman and two groomes: In the Wood yarde a yeoman and a groome: In the Barne one: In the Garden a yeoman and two groomes: Porters at the Gate twoo yeomen and two groomes: a yeoman of hys Barge: a maister of hys horse: a Clearke of the Stable, a yeoman of the same: the Sadler: the Farrier: a yeoman of hys Chariot: a Sumpter man: a yeoman of his Styrrop: a Muleter: sixetéene groomes of hys Stable, euery of them kepte foure Geldings: In the Almorie a yeoman, and a groome: In hys Chappel he hadde a Deane, a greate Diuine, and a man of excellent learning: a Subdeane: a Repeater of the Quire: a Gospeller: a Pistler: of singing Priestes ten: a master of the Children: Seculars of the Chappell singing men twelue: singing children tenne, with one seruant to awaite vppon the children: In the Reuestry a yeoman, and two groomes, ouer besides dyuers reteiners, that came thither at principal feastes.
For the furniture of hys Chappell, passeth my capacitie to declare, the number of costly ornamentes and riche iewels that were to be occupyed in the same continuallye: there hathe béene séene in Procession, aboute the Hall,
very rich Coapes of one sute worne, besides the riche Crosses and Candlestickes, and other ornamentes to the furniture of the same: Hée had two crossebearers, and two Piller bearers, in hys great Chamber: and in hys priuy Chamber these persons: fyrste the chiefe Chamberlaine, and Uizchamberlaine: of Gentlemen Ushers, besides one in his priuie Chamber, he hadde twelue daylye wayters, and of Gentlemen wayters in hys priuye Chamber he hadde sixe, and of Lordes nyne or tenne, who hadde eche of them two men allowed them to attend vpon them, except the Erle of Darby, who had allowed fiue men: then had he of Gentlemen, of Cup bearers, Caruers, and Sewers beth of the priuie Chamber, and of the great chamber wyth Gentlemen dayly wayters there fortie persons: Ofyeomen Ushers sixe, of groomes in his Chamber eight, of yeomen in his Chamber fiue and fortie daylye: he had also Almose men sometime more in number than other sometime.
There was attending on his borde of Doctors and Chapleines, besides them of his Chappell sixetéene daylye: a Clearke of his Closet: Secretaries two: and two Clearkes of his Signet: and foure Counsellours learned in the Lawe: And for asmuche, as it was necessarie to haue dyuers officers of the Chauncerie to attende vppon hym, that is to saye, the Clearke of the Crowne: a ryding Clearke: a Clearke of the Hamper: and a chafer of the Waxe: then a Clearke of the Checke, as well vppon the Chapleins, as of the Yeomen of his Chamber: hée had also foure footemen whyche were garnished in riche running coates, when so euer he rode in anye iourney: then had hée an Harraulte of Armes: and a Sergeant of Armes: a Phisition: a Poticarie: foure Minstrels: a kéeper of his Tents: an Armorer: an instructer of hys wards: two yeomen of hys Wardrobe of hys Robes: and a kéeper of hys Chamber continuallye in the Court: he had also in his house the Surueyor of Yorke, and a Clearke of the gréene Cloth.
All these were dayly attending, downe lying and vprising, and at meales: he kepte in his greate Chamber a continuall borde for the Chamberers and Gentlemen officers, hauing wyth them a messe of the yong Lords, and an other of Gentlemen: and besides all these, there was neuer an officer, Gentleman, or worthy person, but he was allowed in the house, some thrée, some two, and al other one at the leaste, whiche grewe to a greate number of persons.
Thus of the Checker roll, besides other officers, seruantes, teyners, and futers, that moste commoulye dyned in the Hall.
After that he was thus furnished, he was sente twice in embassade to the Emperor Charles the fifth, for diuers vrgent causes touchyng the Kings Maiestie, it was thought, that so noble a Prince (the Cardinall) was moste méete to be sente: wherefore, being readye to take vppon hym the charge thereof, was furnished in all degrées and purposes, moste lyke a greate Prince: for firste he procéeded forth furnished lyke a Cardinall: hys Gentlemen béeyng verye many in number, were clothed in Lyuerie coates of Crimosin Ueluet of the best, wyth chaines of Golde aboute theyr neckes, and hys yeomen and meane officers, in coates of fine Scarlet, garded with blacke Ueluet a hande broade.
Thus furnished, he was twice sente into Flaunders to the Emperour then lying in Bruges, whom he did most highly, entertain discharging al his charges his me~s.
There was no house within the town of Bruges, wherein any Gentlema~ of the Cardinals were lodged, or had recourse, but that the owners were commaunded by the Emperoures officers, that they, vpon paine of their liues, shoulde take no mony for anye thing that the Cardinalles seruantes diode take of anye kinde of victuall, no althoughe they were disposed to make anye costlye banquets: commaunding forthermore their saide hostes, to sée y^ they lacked no such things as they honestly required for their honesty pleasure.
Also the Emperors officers euery night we~t through the town fro~ house to house, whereas any English Gentleme~ did repast or lodged, serued their liueries for all night, which was done in this maner.
First, the Officers brought into the house a cast of fine Manchet, of siluer two great pots with white wine, and Sugar to the waighte of a pounde: white lights and yellowe lightes of Ware: a boule of siluer wyth a Goblet to drinke in, and euerye night a staffe· torche: This was the order of the liueries euerye nighte: and in the morning, when the same officers came to fetch away their stuffe, then woulde they accompte with the hostes for the Gentlemens costes spent in the daye before.
Thus the Emperoure entertayned the Cardinall and all his traine for the time of his Embassage there.
And that done, he returned into Englande with great triumphe.
Nowe of hys order in going to Westminster hall dayly in the Terme.
Firste, ere he came out of hys priuie Chamber, he hearde seruice in his Closet, and there said hys seruice wyth hys Chaplaine: Then goyng againe to hys priuy Chamber, he woulde demaunde, if his seruants were in a readynesse, and furnished hys Chamber of Presence, and wayghting Chamber, being thereof then aduertized, came oute of hys priuy Chamber aboute eighte of the clocke, apparelled all in red, that is to saye, hys vpper garment eyther of fine Scarlet, or else fine Crimosin Taffata, but most commonlye of fine Crimosin Satten engrayned, hys pillion of fine Scarlet, with a necke sette in the inner side wyth blacke Ueluet, and a Tippet of Sables aboute hys necke, holding in hys hand an Orenge, wherof the substance within was taken oute, and filled vppe againe wyth the part of a Sponge, wherein was Uineger and other Confections againste the pestilent ayres, the whyche hée moste commonlye helde to hys nose when he came among anye preace, or else that he was pestered wyth manye suters: and béefore him was borne firste the broade Seale of Englande, and hys Cardinales Hat, by a Lorde, or some Gentlemanne of Worshippe, right solempnely: and as soone as he was once entred into his Cha~ber of Presence, his two great Crosses were there attending to be borne before hym: then cried the Gentlemen Ushers, going before him bare headed, and saide: On before, my Lordes and Maisters, on before, make waye for my Lordes Grace.
Thus went he downe through the Hall wyth a Sergeant of Armes before hym, bearing a greate Mace of Siluer, and two Gentlemen carying twoo greate Pillers of Siluer, and when he came at the Hall dore, there was hys Mule, being trapped all in Ueluet wyth a Saddle of the same, and guilte styrrops.
When was there attending vpponhym, when he was mounted, hys two and his Piller bearers in like case vppon greate horses, trapped all in fine Scarlet.
Then marched he forward with a traine of noble men and Gentlemen, hauing his footmen four in number about hym, bearing eache of them a guilte Polare in their hands: and thus passed he forth vntill he came to Westminster hall dore, and there lighted, and wente vppe after thys manner into the Chauncerie, or into the Starre Chamber: howbeit, moste commonlye he woulde goe into the Chancerie, and stay a while at a barre made for hym beneath the Chancerie on the righte hande, and there commune sometyme wyth the Judges, and some· time with other persons: and that done, he woulde repayre into the Chancerie, and sitting there vntill eleauen of the clocke, hearing of sutes, and determining of other matters, from thence he woulde dyuers times go into the Starre Chamber as occasion serued.
There he neyther spared highe ne lowe, but iudged euery state accordyng to his merites and desert.
He vsed also euerye Sondaye to resorte to the Courte, then béeyng for the moste parte of all the yeare at Greenewiche, with hys former triumphes, takyng hys Barge at hys own stayres, furnished wyth Yeomen standyng vppon the Bailes, and hys Gentlemen béeyng wythin aboute hym, and landed againe at the three Cranes in the and from thence hée rode vpon his Mule with his Crosse, his Pillars, his Hat and broade Seale carryed afore hym on horsebacke through Thamis streete· vntill he came to Billingsgate, and there tooke his Barge againe, and so was rowed to Greenewiche, where he was receyued of the Lordes and chiefe officers of the Kings house, as the Treasurer, Comptroller, and other, and so conuyed vnto the Kings Chamber: then the Court was wonderfully furnished wyth Noble men and Gentlemen: and after dinner among the Lords, hauing some consultation with the King, or with the Councell, he woulde departe homewarde with the like triumph.
Thus in greate honour, triumph, and glory, he raigned a long season ruling all thynges within the Realme appertayning vnto the King.
His house was alwayes resorted to with noblemen and Gentlemen, feasting and banqueting Embassadors dyuers times, and al other right nobly: and when it pleased the King for his recreation, to repayre to the Cardinalles house, as he didde dyuers tymes in the yeare: there wanted no preparations, or furniture: Banquets were sette forth with Maskes and Mummeries, in so gorgeous a sorte, and costly maner, that it was an heauen to beholde.
There wanted no Dames or Damoisels, méete or apte to daunce with the Maskers, or to garnish the place for the tyme: then was there all kinde of musicke, and harmony, wyth fine voices bothe of menne and chyldren.
One tyme the Kyng came sodainely thither in a Maske wyth a dozen Maskers all in garmentes like Shepheards, made of fine cloth of Golde, and Crimosin Satten paned, and Cappes of the same, wyth Uisars of good visnomy, their haires and beardes, eyther of fine Goldewyre silke, or black silke, hauing sixetéene besides their Drums and other persons wyth Uisars, all clothed in Satten of the same colour: and before hys entring into the Hall, hée came by water to the water gate, wythout any noise, where were layd diuers Cha~bers and Guns charged with Shot, at hys landing they were shotte off, whyche made suche a tumble in ye Ayre, that it was like thunder: It made all the Noblemen, Gentlemen, Ladyes, and Gentlewomen, to what it shoulde meane, comming so sodainelye, they quiet at a solempne banquet, vnder this sorte: First yée shall vnderstande, that the Tables were sette in the Chamber of Presence iust couered, and the Lorde Cardinall sitting vnder the cloth of Estate, there hauing all hys seruice alone: and then was there sette a Lady wyth a Nobleman, or a Gentleman and a Gentlewoman throughout all the Tables in the Chamber on the one side, whych were made and ioyned as it were but one Table, all whiche order and deuice was done by the Lorde Sandes then Lorde Chamberlaine to the King, and by Syr Henrie Gilforde Comptroller of the Kinges Maiesties house.
Then immediately after the greate Chamberlaine, and the sayde Comptroller, sente to looke what it shoulde meane, (as thoughe they knewe nothing of the matter,) they looking oute of the Windowes into the Thamis, retourned againe and shewed hym, that it séemed they were Noblemen and Straungers, arryued at hys bridge, comming as Embassadoures from some forreine Prince: with that quoth the Cardinal, desire you, bycause you can speake Frenche· to take the paines to goe into the Hall, there to receyue them according to their estates, and to conducte them into this Chamber, where they shall sée vs, and all these Noble Personages, beyng mery at oure banquet, desiring them to sitte downe with vs, and to take parte of our fare.
Then wente hée incontinent downe into the Hall, whereas they receyued them wyth twentie newe Torches, and conueyed them vppe into the Chamber, wyth suche a noyse of Drummes and flewtes, as seldome hadde béene hearde the like.
At theyr entring into the Chamber twoo and twoo togyther, they went directlye before the Cardinall where hée sate, and saluted hym reuerentlye, to whome the Lorde Chamberlaine for them saide: Sir, for as muche as they bée Straungers, and can not speake Englishe, they haue desired me to declare vnto you, that they hauyng vnderstanding of this your triumphaunt banquet, where was assembled suche a number of excellent Dames, they coulde doe no lesse vnder supporte of youre Grace, but to repayre hyther, to viewe as well their incomparable beautie, as for to accompanye them at Mumme chaunce, and then to daunce with them: and sir, they require of youre Grace licence to accomplishe the saide cause of their comming.
To whome the Cardinall saide he was very well content they should so doe.
Then went the Maskers, and first saluted al the Dames, and returned to the moste worthiest, and there opened their greate cuppe of Golde filled wyth Crownes, and other péeces of Golde, to whome they sette certaine péeces of Golde to cast at.
Thus perusing all the Ladyes and Gentlewomen, to some they loste, and of some they wonne: and perusing after this maner al the Ladies, they returned to the Cardinal with greate reuerence, powring downe all their Golde so lefte in their Cup, whych was aboue twoo hundred crowns: At all (quoth the Cardinall) and so caste the Dice and wan them, whereat was made a great noise and ioy. Thenquoth the Cardinall to the Lord Chamberlain, pray you (quoth he) that you would shew them, that me séemeth there should be a Nobleman amongest them, who is more méete to occupye this seate and place than am, to whome woulde moste gladly surrender the same according to my duety, if knewe him.
Then spake the Lorde Chamberlaine to them in Frenche, and they rownding him in the eare, the Lorde Chamberlaine saide to my Lorde Cardinall: Sir, (quoth he) they confesse, that among them there is suche a Noble personage, whome, if your Grace can appointe hym oute from the rest, he is content to disclose hymselfe, and to accept your place: with that the Cardinal taking good aduisement among them, at the laste quoth he, me séemes the Gentleman wyth the blacke Bearde shoulde be euen he: and with that he arose oute of hys Chayre, and offered the same to the Gentleman in the blacke Bearde, with his cap in his hande.
The person to whome he offered the Chayre was Sir Edwarde Neuil, a comely Knight, that much more resembled the Kings person in that Maske than anye other.
The King perceyuing the Cardinall so deceyued, could not forbeare laughing, but pulled down hys visar and Master Neuels also, and dashed out suche a pleasaunt countenaunce and chéere, that al the noble estates there assembled perceiuing the King to be there among them, reioyced very much.
The Cardinal eft soones desired his Highnesse to take the place of Estate: to whome the King aunswered, that he woulde goe firste and shifte hys apparell, and so departed into my Lorde Cardinalles Chamber, and there newe apparelled him: in whych tyme, the dishes of the banquet were cleane taken vppe, and the Tables spred againe with new cleane perfumed clothes, euery man and woman sitting stil, vntill the King with all his Maskers came among them againe all newe apparelled: then the King tooke his seate vnder the cloth of Estate, commaunding euery person to sit still as they did before: In came a newe banquet before the Kyng, and to all the rest throughout all the Tables, wherein were serued two hundred diuers dishes, of costly deuises and suttilties.
Thus passed they forth the night with banqueting, dauncing, and other triumphes, to the great comforte of the King, and pleasant regard of the Nobilitie there assembled.
Thus passed this Cardinall his time from day to daye, and yeare to yeare, in suche greate wealth, ioy, triumph, and glorie, hauyng alwayes on hys side the Kings especial fauor, vntil Fortune enuied his prosperous estate, as is to the worlde well knowne, and shall be partely touched hereafter.
This yeare in the moneth of May, were sent out of Englande xij. C. Masons and Carpenters, and thrée hundred laborers to the Citie of Tourney, to builde a Castell there, to chastice the Citie if it chaunced to rebel, and to diminish the garrison that then laye there to the Kings greate charge.

But shortlye after Archibalde Douglas hir husbande wente home agayne into Scotlande wythoute leaue taking: wherefore the Kyng sente for hir to London, where shée was roally receyued and lodged at Baynardes Castell, and there she tarried a whole yeare ere she returned.
The Thamis was frozen, that men with horse and Carts might passe betwixte Westminster and Lambeth.
On May euen was an insurrection of yong persons and Apprentises of London against Aliens: for the whyche fact, tenne payre of Gallowes were made with whéeles to be remoued from stréete to stréete, and from dore to dore, wherevpon diuers yong men were hanged, wyth theyr Captaine Iohn Lincolne a Broker: the residue, to the number of four hundred men, and eleauen women, tyed in ropes al along one after an other in theyr shyrtes came to Westminster hall, wyth halters aboute their neckes, and were pardoned.
Margaret Quéene of Scottes returned into Scotland to the Earle of Anguise hir husbande.

It chanced in the yeare passed, a grudge to breake out betwéene the French King, and the Duke of Burbon, in so much, that the Duke for the safegard of his life, fledde out of the French Kings Dominions, whereof the Cardinall Wolsey hauing intelligence, comprised in his head, that if the King our soueraigne Lord could obteyne him to be his Generall in the warre against the French King, and considering further that the Duke of Burbon was fledde vnto the Emperour to inuite him to a like purpose, wherefore he hauing this imagination in his head, thought it good to moue the King in the matter, and after the King was once aduertised héereof, and conceyuing the Cardinals inuention, at last it came to a consultation among the Counsell; so that it was concluded that an Embassade should be sente to the Emperour about the matter, with whome he was, that the King and the Emperour should ioyne in those warres against the French King, and that the Duke of Burbon should be our Kings Champion and Generall in the fielde, who had a great number of good Souldiours, ouer and besides the Emperours armie, which was not small: and that the King should pay vnto the Duke monethly wages, both for himselfe, and his retinue, in so much, as Sir Iohn Russell lay continually beyond the Seas in a secret place, both to receyue money of the King, and to pay the same monethly to the Duke, so that the Duke began the warres with the French King in his owne territorie and Dukedome, which the King had confisked in his owne hands, being not perfectly knowne vnto the Dukes enimies that he had any ayde out of England, and thus he wrought the French King much displeasure, in so much, as the French King was constreyned to prepare a puissant Armie, and in his owne person to resist the Dukes power, and with force the King droue him to take Pauy, a strong Towne in Italy, with hys host, for their securitie, whereas the King encamped hym wonderously strong, intending to enclose the Duke, that he should not issue forth, yet notwithstanding, the Duke did many times issue forth, and skirmished with the King.
Now let vs returne agayne to the Cardinall Wolsey, who séemed to be sodeinly altered, and to be more French than Emperiall, howsoeuer it came so to passe: but the French King lying in his Camp, sent secretly into Englande a priuie person, a very wittie man, to treate a peace betwixt the French King, and our King: this person was named Iohn Iokin, who was kept as secretly as might be, for he was no Frenchman borne, but an Italian a man of no great estimation in France, and for his subtile witte, elected to entreate of such Embassade as the French King had giuen him in commission.
This Iokin was secretly conuayde vnto Richmond, and there remayned, vntill the Cardinall resorted thither vnto him, where after Easter tearme ended, he kept the feast of Whitsontide very solemnely, in which season, the Cardinall caused diuers times this Iokin to dine with him.
Thus continued this Iokin in England long after, vntill at the last, as it should, he brought to passe the matter that he had in commission.
After this, there was sente out immediatly a restreynt to Sir Iohn Russell, into those partes where he made his abiding beyond the Seas, that he shoulde reteyne that monethes wages still in hys vntill the Kings pleasure were to him knowne, which should haue bin payde to the Duke of Burbon, then wyth hys retinue encamped within the Towne for want whereof, at his day, the Duke and hys were sore dismayde, when they saw there was not ey brought as it was wont to be, and béeing in so danrous a case, and where victualles beganne to be very déere, they imagined many wayes what shoulde the lette, some sayde thys, and some sayde that, so that they mistrusted nothing lesse than the very cause thereof, in so much as at the last, what for wante of victualles, and other necessaries, the Souldyoures and Captaynes beganne to grudge and mutter, and at last, for lacke of victuals, were like all to perish.
The Souldyours being in this extremitie, came before their Captaine y^
Duke of Burbon, and sayd, Sir, we must bée of very force and necessitie constreyned to yéelde vs vp to our enimies, and better it were for vs so to do, than to sterue lyke Dogges.
When the Duke saw their extremitie, he sayde vnto them with wéeping eyes, Sirs (quoth he) yée are both valiant men, and of noble heartes, who haue serued me héere right worthelie, and for your necessitie (whereof am perticipant) doe not a little lament· but shall desire you, as you are noble in heart and courage, so to take patience for a day or twayne, and if succour come not then from the King of England, as doubt nothing that he will deceyue vs, will well agrée that we shall all put oure selues and our liues vnto the mercy of our Lorde, wherewith they were all agréeable: and tarrying the comming of the Kings money vntill the tearme of two dayes were past, the Duke séeing no remedie, called his noble Captaynes and Souldyoures before hym, and wéeping sayde: Yée noble men and Captaynes, sée no remedie in thys necessitie, but eyther wée must yéeld vs vnto our enimies, or else mishe, and to yéelde the Towne and our selues, know not the mercie of our enimies, as for my parte, not for their cruelties, for knowe very well that shall suffer death most cruelly if come in their hand
it is not for my selfe therefore that doe lamente, it is for youre sakes, it is for youre liues, and of youre persons, for so that yée might escape the dang of oure enimies handes, woulde most gladly death, therefore good companyons, and most noble Souldyoures, shall require you all to consider the daungerous miserie and calamitie that wée stande in, to sell liues most dearely, rather than to be murthered Beastes: if yée wyll bée agréeable, wée wyll take vpon vs thys nighte to gyue oure Enimes an assaulte, and by that meanes wée maye eyther escape, or else gyue them an ouerthrowe, and thus it were better to die in the Fielde lyke men, than lyue prisoners in captiuitle and miserie, to the whiche they all agréed, then quoth the Duke, yée perceyue that our enimies Campe is strong, and that there is no waye to enter vppon them but one, and that is so planted wyth Ordinance and strength of men, that it is not possible to atteyne to oure Enimies that wayes to fighte wyth them in Campe.
And also, nowe of late you perceyue they haue hadde but small doubt of vs, in so muche that they haue kepte but verye slender watche, therefore, my deuice shall bée thus: There shall issue out of the Towne aboute the dead of the nighte from vs a number of you that bée of the most delyuerest to assaulte theyr Campe, and they shall gyue the assaulte righte secretly, euen directly agaynste the place of the entrie whyche is very strong and inuincible, youre fierce and valiant assaulte shall be to them of the Campe so doubtfull, that they will turne their strength of the entrie that lyeth ouer agaynst your assaulte, to beate you from youre purpose, then will issue out of the posterne, and come to the place of theyr strength newly turned, and there or they be ware will enter, and fight with them in theyr Camp, and winne their Ordinance whiche they haue newly burned, and beate them wyth theyr owne ces, and then pleased them wonderous well.
Then pared they all that daye for the purposed deuise, kepte them secret and close without anye noyse, or tte off péeces within the Towne, whyche gaue theyr Enimies the lesse of the assaulte, but wente to theyr Tentes, and cowched nothyng mistrusting that afterwarde immediately happened vnto them.
When the tyme came that all men were at rest, the assaylants issued out of the Towne, and there according to their appoyntment, they gaue so cruell and fierce assault, that they in the Camp had as much to do as was possible to resist them· and euen as the Duke declared before to his Souldiours, they within were compelled to turne their shotte that lay at the entrie, against the assaylants.
With that issued the Duke, and with him about fiftéene or sixtéene thousand men, or more, secretly in the night, his enimies being not priuie of his comming, vntill he was entred the fielde, and at his entrie, he tooke all the Ordinance that lay there, and slew the Gunners, then hée charged the péeces against his enimies, and slewe them wonderfully, he cutte downe the Tentes and Pauilions, and murthered many within them, ere they were ware of his comming, so that he wanne the field or euer the King could arise to the rescue, in so much as the King was taken in hys lodging or euer he were harnessed, his Tentes were robbed and spoyled which were wonderous rith: and in the spoyle and search of the Kings coffers, the Duke of Burbon found the league vnder the great Seale of England, newly made betwéene the King of England, and the French King, which once perceyued by him, began to smell the impediment of his money which should haue come vnto him from the King, hauing vpon due search intelligence that all the matter was deuised by the Cardinall of Englande.
The Duke conceyued suche an indignation héerevpon agaynst the Cardinall, that incontinente hée wente vnto Rome, and there intended to sacke the Towne, and to haue taken the Pope, where at the first assaulte of the walles, the Duke was the first man that was stayne, yet notwithstanding; hys Captaynes continued their assaulte, and at the sast wanne the Towne, and the Pope fledde vnto Castell Saint Angell, where hée continued long in calamitie.
All this notwithstanding, which yée haue when newes was brought into England of the taking of the French King, great triumph was made for ioy thereof on the ninth of March.
About such time as Cardinall Wolsey was determined to erect his new Colledges in Oxford and Ipswich, he obteyned licence and authoritie of Pope Clement the seauenth, to suppresse about the number of fortie Monasteries of good same, and bountifull hospitalitie, wherein the King bearing with all his doings, neyther Bishop, nor temporall Lorde in this Realme durst saye any worde to the contrarie.
In the executing of this businesse, fiue persons were his chiefe instruments, who on a time made a demaunde to the Prior and Couent of the Monasterie of Daintrie, for occupying of certayne of theyr groundes, but the Monkes refusing to satisfie their requests, streightway they picked a quarrell agaynste the house, and gaue information to the Cardinall agaynste them, who taking a small occasion, commaunded the house to bée dissolued, and to bée co~uerted to hys new Colledge, but of thys irreligeous robberie, done of no conscience, but to patch vp pride, whiche priuate wealth coulde not furnishe, what punishmente hath since ensued at Gods hande (sayeth myne Authour) partly our selues haue séene, for of those fyue persons, two fell at discorde betwéene themselues, and the one slewe the other, for the which, the suruiuor was hanged: the thirde drowned hymselfe in a well: the fourth béeing well knowne, and valued worth two hundreth pounde, became in thrée yeares so poore, that hée begged to hys dying day: and the fifth called Doctor Allane, béeyng thiefe executor of these doyngs, was cruelly maymed in Irelande, euen at suche tyme as hée was a Bishop: the Cardinall falling after into the Kings gréeuous displeasure, was deposed, and dyed miserably: the Colledges whiche hée meante to haue made so glorious a building, came neuer to good effect: and Pope Clement himselfe, by whose authoritie, these houses were throwne downe to the ground, was after enclosed in a dangerous séege within the Castell of Saint Angell in Rome by the Emperialles, the Citie of Rome was pitifully sacked, and himselfe narrowly escaped with his life.
On the eyghtéenth of June, Henry Fitz Roy, which King· Henry the eyght had by Elizabeth, daughter to Sir Iohn Blunt Knight, was created Earle of Notingham, Duke of Richmond and Somerset, Lieutenant Generall from Trent Northwards, Warden of the East, middle, and West marches, fore aneinst Scotlande.

The eleuenth of February, four Merchants of ye Stilyard did penance at Pawles Crosse, and an Augustine Frier, called Doctor Barnes, bare a Fagot: there was present the Lord Cardinall, with eleuen Bishops, Iohn Fisher, Bishop of Rochester made the Sermon, which was against Martine Luther of Germany, and his doctrine.
truce was taken betwéene Englande and France for a certayne space, and Embassadors were sent into Denmarke, for restoring of their King, but the Danes woulde graunte nothing therevnto; they did so deadly hate hym for hys crueltie.
The xxviij. of Aprill, came to the Court to Greenewiche Mounsire Briond, President of Roane, and Iohn Iokin, which President, before the King and his Nobles, made in the Latin tongue a solemne Oration, the effect whereof was, how dreadfull the warres had bin betwéene the Realmes of England and France.
He declared further of what power the King of Englande was, and what conquest he might haue made in France, the French King being prisoner, whereof he humbly thanked him of his pitie and compassion that he had on them in their necessitie, that he would consente to peace: to the which Oration, Sir Thomas Moore, Chancellour of the Duchy of Lancaster, made answere, saying: that it much reioyced the King, that they first considered, how by hys power he might haue oppressed, and how by hys pitie he had reléeued them, wherefore he would héere after, that for kindnesse they shoulde shewe hym none vnkindnesse, but inuiolably kéepe that league which was co~cluded.
In the moneth of May, was proclamation made against all vnlawfull games, and commissions awarded into euerie Shire, for the execution of the same, so that in all places, Tables, Dice, Cardes, and Bowles, were taken and brent, but when yong men were restreyned of these games and pastimes, some fell to drincking, some to ferretting of other mens Conyes, and stealing of Deare in Parkes, and other vnthristinesse.

After the deliuerie of the French King out of the Emperours bondage, and his sonnes receyued in hostage for the Emperours and the King of Englands securitie, of all such demaundes and requestes as should be demaunded of the French King.
The Cardinall Wolsey lamenting the French Kings calamitie, and the Popes great aduersitie, who yet remayned in the Castell Angell, trauelled all that he could with the King and his Counsell, to take some order for the quietnesse of them both.
At last, it was thought good that the sayde Cardinall shoulde take vppon him the Kings commission, to trauell beyond the Seas in this matter, and by his witte, to compasse a perfect peace among those potentates: wherevpon, he was commanded to prepare himselfe to this iourney, which he tooke vpon him.

Then marched he forwarde from hys owne house at Westminster, throughe London ouer London bridge, hauing before hym all the Gentlemen, thrée in a rancke in Ueluet Coates, and the moste of them greate chaines of Golde aboute their neckes, and all hys Yeomen followed hym with Noblemens and Gentlemens seruants, al in Orenge tawney coates, with the Cardinalles Hat, and a T. for Thomas Cardinall embrodered vpon all the Coates, aswell of hys owne seruants, as of al the reste of Gentlemens seruantes: and hys Sumpter Mules whyche were twentie or more, with all his cariage of Cartes, and other of hys traine, were passed before.
He rode like a Cardinall verye sumptuouslye on hys Mule, wyth his spare Mule and spare horse trapped in Crimosin Ueluet vpon veluet, and stirrops guilt folowing him: And before hym he had his twoo great Crosses of siluer, his two great Pillers of siluer, the Kings broade Seale of Englande, and hys Cardinals Hat, and a Gentlemanne carying hys Ualence, otherwise called his Cloake· bagge, whyche was made of fine Scarlet altogyther embrodered very richly with Golde, hauing in it a cloake.
Thus passed he forth throughe London, and all the waye euerye daye in his iourney he was thus furnished, hauing hys Harbengers in euerye place before, whych prepared lodging for hys traine.
The first iourney that he made, was twoo myles beyond Dertford in Kent, vnto sir Thomas Wiltshires house, and the reste of hys traine were lodged in Dertford, and in the countrey
The nexte daye he marched to Roches, where he was lodged in the Byshoppes Pallaice, and the rest of his traine in the Citie in Strowde.
The third day he rode to Feuersham, and there was lodged in the Abbey, his traine in the towne there, and some in the Countrey
The fourth daye he rode to Caunterburie, where he encountred wyth the worshipfull of the town and Country, and lodged in the Priorie of Christchurch, and all hys traine in the Citie, where he continued thrée dayes, in whiche season there was a greate fayre in the Towne, by reason it was the feast of Thomas of Canterburie.
At whych daye there was a solempne Procession, wherein the Cardinal then went apparelled in hys Legantine Ornamentes, with hys Hat on his heade, who commaunded the Monks and the Quéere to sing the Letany after this sorte, Sancta Maria, or a pro Papa nostra Clemente, the Cardinall knéeling at a Stoole before the Quéere dore all the while the Monks and their Quéere stoode in the body of the church singing the Letany.
The eleauenth of July the Cardinall arriued at Calleis, who was receiued with all the Officers and Counsell of the Towne, the Maior of the Towne, and the Maior of the Staple in Procession, and in the Lauterne Gate, he knéeled and made his prayers: that done, they passed on before vntill he came to Saint Maries Churche, from whence he repayred with a greate number of Noblemen and Gentlemen, béeing Péeres of the Towne vnto a place called the Checker, where he was lodged, and kepte his house as long as he abode in the Towne.
When all his traine and carriage was landed, and euery thing prepared for his iourney, he called all hys Noblemen Gentlemen, beyng seruants vnto him into hys priuie Chamber, where they being al assembled before hym he sayde: haue called you hither to the intent to declare vnto you, that consider the duetie you beare me, and the good will that semblably beare to you, séeing your intendment to further the aucthoritie that haue by Commission, whiche your diligent wil remember hereafter, and therefore meane to declare the same directly to the King.
Secondly, to shewe you the nature of the Frenche men: And thirdely, to instructe you howe and with what reuerence yée shall vse me for the honor of the Kings Maiestie, and then to enforme you howe ye shall entertaine and accompanye the Frenche men when ye shall méete at anye time.
The first poynt ye shall vnderstand, that the Kings Maiestie for certaine waightie affaires, of his Graces hathe for more aduauncement of his royall dignitie assigned me to be in this iorney his lieuetenant, and what reuerence belongeth to the same will tell you, for my parte muste by vertue of my Commission and Lieuetenantship and take vppon me to be estéemed in all honor and degrées of seruice, as to his Highnesse presence is méete and due, and that by me nothyng to be neglected, that to hys royall estate is due and appertinent.
And for my parte yée shall sée me, that wyll not omit one iote thereof.
Therefore bycause that ye shal not be ignorant of your dutie in this case, as one of the chiefe causes of this youre assembly, willing you as you will haue my fauour, and also charge you in the kings name, that ye doe not forget the same in time and place, but that euerye one of you do obserue your duety vnto me accordingly as ye at your return auoide the kings gnation· or obtaine and deserue hys highnesse thankes, the whiche will sette forth, as eache of you shall deserue.
Nowe to the seconde point, the nature of the Frenche men is suche, that at the firste méeting they will be as familiar with you as they had bin acquainted wyth you long before, and commune with you in their Frenche tongue, as though ye vnderstoode euerye worde, therefore vse them in like maner, and be as familiar with them as they be wyth you.
If they speake in their natural tongue, speake you agayne vnto· them in the Englishe tongue: For, if you vnderstande not them, no more shall they vnderstande you: and speakyng merilye to one of the Gentlemenne there, being a Welche manne, sayde, Rice (quoth hée) speake you Welche to them: doubt not but that thy speache shall be more defuse to hym, than hys Frenche shal be to
And thus quoth he againe to them all, lette all youre entertainement and behauior be according to the order of all gentlenesse and humilitie, that it may be reported after your departure from thence, that ye be Gentlemen of right good behauiour, and of muche gentlenesse, and that ye are men, who knowe your dueties to your Soueraigne Lord, and to your Maister, estéeming muche youre greate reuerence.
Thus shall ye not onelye obtaine to youre selues greate commendation and praise for the same, but also aduaunce the honor of your Prince and Countrey: Nowe go your wayes, being admonished of al these pointes, and prepare your selues againste to morrowe, for then we intende (God willing) to set forwarde.
The nexte morrowe, béeing Mary Magdalens day, all thyngs béeing furnished, the Cardinal aduanced out of Calleis, wyth suche a number of blacke Ueluet Coates, as hath béene seldome séene with an Embassador, al the Péeres of Calleis and Guisnes, with al other Gentlemen besides his traine, béeyng garnished in blacke Ueluet Coates and Chaines of Golde.
Thus passed hée forwarde wyth his traine of Gentlemen before him thrée in a rancke, which by supposall endured thrée quarters of a myle or more in length, hauyng his Crosses and all other his accustomed and glorious furniture carryed before him, as haue before rehearsed, excepte the broade Seale, the whyche he lefte in Calleis wyth Doctour Taylour, then Maister of the Rolles, vntil his returne.
Passing thus on hys way, and being scantly rydden a myle, it beganne to raine so vehemently, as lightly had not béene séene the like, whyche endured vntill they came to Boloinge, and ere they came to Sandingfielde, the Cardinal of Loraine, a goodly yong Gentleman, encountred the Cardinall of Englande, and receyued him with great ioy and reuerence· and so passed forth wyth the Cardinal in communication vntil they came nigh vnto the saide Sandingfielde, whych was a place of Religion, standing betwéene the and the Emperours dominions, beyng a Newter, holding of neyther of them.
There awayted for him Le Countie Brian, Capitaine of Pycardie, with a greate number of or Albenois, standyng in arraye in a greate péece of gréene Oates, all in harnesse vpon high horses, passing on with the Cardinall in a wing vnto Bolongne, and so after throughe Picardie· the Cardinal doubted somewhat the Emperour, that he should lay some ambush to betray hym, for whyche cause the French Kyng commaunded them to attende vppon hym for the assuraunce of his person.
Thus rode he vntil he came within one Englishe myle of Bolongne, where encountred hym the Worshipfull Citizens of the Towne of Bolongne, hauing a learned man that made vnto hym an Oration in Latine, vnto the whyche the Cardinall semblably made answeare: And that done, Monsieur de Bees Capitaine of Bolongne with the retinue there of Gentlemen, mette wyth him on horsebacke, and then with al this assembly he rode into the town lighting at the Abbey gate, and from thence conueyed wyth Procession into the Abbey Churche there offered, then went he into the Abbey to hys lodging, and all his traine were lodged in the high and base townes.
The next morning after hée rode to Mutterell Ser Lemere, where he was in like case encountred with the Worshipful of the Towne al in one Lyuerie, hauing a learned man to make an Oration vnto the~ in Latine, whome he aunswered also again in Latine.
And as he entred in at the Gates, there was a Canapie made readie of silke, embrodered with letters Hat euen as his men had on their Coates, and when that he was lighted, his footemen had the same as a Fée due to the office.
Nowe was there made dyuers Pageants for the ioy of his comming, who was called in the Frenche tong there, and in al other places throughe the Realme where he rode or came, Le Cardinall Pacifique.
The nexte daye hée tooke hys iourney towardes Abvile, where hée was encountred wyth diuers Gentlemen of the Towne and Countrey, and so into the towne with Pageants, as he rode thorough the towne, hauing a lyke Canapie borne ouer him, but more richer, and so broughte to hys in thys Towne, he remayned more than eyght dayes, where resorted to him dayly diuers of the Frenche Kings Counsell sitting with him in counsell euerye daye, and continually feasting him and other.
When the time came of hys departing out of the Towne, he rode to the Castell beyonde the water of Some, called Le Chanel de Picqiny adioyning to the saide watch vpon a Rocke, wythin the whyche there was a Colledge of Priests, the scituation whereof was much like vnto the Castel of Windsore, and there he was receiued with solemnne Procession, and lodged that nighte.
The nexte morning the Cardinall rode towarde Amiens, and passing on his way, he was encountred with noble personages, who made to him diuers Orations, whiche he answered extempore.
Afterwarde the Frenche King with a goodly company mette with the Cardinal, embraced eche other: The preace was so thicke, that diuers had their legs hurt with horses.
Then the King and the Cardinall on his right hande rode forth towardes Amiens, euery Englishe Gentleman accompanyed with an other of Fraunce.
The traine of these Princes endured two long Englishe myles, they were nobly receyued into the Towne of Amiens with shot of Guns and costly Pageants, vntil the King had brought the Cardinall to his lodging, and then departed for that nighte, the King being lodged in the Bishoppes Pallaice.
The next daye after dinner the Cardinal rode to the Courte to the King, at whiche time the king kepte his bedde: yet neuerthelesse, the Cardinall came into his bed·chamber, where, on the one side of the bed sate the Kings mother, and on the other side the Cardinal of Loraine, accompanied with diuers other Noblemen of Fraunce, and after a shorte communication, and drinking of a cuppe of Wine, he departed to hys owne lodging.
Thus continued the Cardinall and the king in Amiens, the space of a fortnight and more, consulting and feasting eche other dyuers tymes.
Then the King and the Cardinall remoued to a Citie called Champaine, whych was more than. xx. English myles from Amiens, they were both lodged in the great castel of y^ town, wherof y^
Cardinal had the one halfe assigned him for his lodging· the king the other halfe.
And like wise they denided a long Gallerie béetwéen the~, where was made in the midst a strong wal, with a window a dore.
The King the Cardinal would many times méete at the same window talke: and diuers times they woulde goe into the other at the said dore.
Lord Chancelor of France, with al the kings counsellers, where they toke great paines dayly in consultation, insomuch that y^
Cardinall of England fel out with the Chancelor of France, laying to hys charge, that he went about to hinder the league whyche before his comming was co~cluded, insomuch, that Madam Regent hir self many Nobles of France, with much labor trauel coulde scarcely bring the Cardinal to his former state of communitation, he was in suche a wroth against the Chancelor: by these meanes, he brought other things to passe, that before he could not attaine, whiche was more for feare than for any affection to the matter, he had the heades of the Counsell so vnder his gyrdle.
The next morning after this conflict he rose early about foure of the clocke, and sate him downe to write letters, into Englande vnto the King, commaundyng me of hys Chapleines to prepare hym ready to say Masse, insomuch, that the Chaplaine stoode in his vestures vntill four of the clocke in the afternoone: al which season the Cardinal neuer rose to eate or drinke, nor to make water, but continually wrote, and aboute the houre of foure in the afternoone he made an end, commaunding Christopher Gunner the Kings seruant, without delay to ride Post into Englande with those letters, whome he dispatched away or euer he dranke, and then went to Masse, and said his seruice with his Chapleine, and after went bothe to dinner and supper all at once.
The nexte night after the Cardinall made a great for Madam Regent, for the Quéene of Nauar and other ate estates of Ladies and noble women, and at the middest of the said banquet· the Kings of Fraunce and of Ni· came so day in vnlooked for, and tooke their place in the lowest parte of the The supper and banquet being finished, the Ladyes and Gentlemen fell to dau~cing, and so passed awaye the moste of the nighte ere they departed.
Shortely after the King caused a wilde Bore to be lodged for him in the For rest of Champaigne, and thither the Cardinal rode wyth hym to sée hym hunt· where the Lady Regent with a number of Ladyes and Damoisels were standyng in Chariots, looking on the toyle on the oute side, whyche was pitched there for that purpose: among whom stoode the Cardinal to regarde the hunting in Madam Regents Chariot, and wythin the Toyle was the King with diuers minion Gentlemen of Fraunce readye furnyshed to thys highe and daungerous enteprice of the hunting, the King beyng in his doublet and hozen all of shéepes colour cloth, hauing in his ippe a brace of greate white Greyhoundes, who were armed as the maner there is: and the reste of the Kings Gentlemen being appoynted to hunte this Bore, were likewise in their doublets and hoss· holdyng eache of them in theyr handes verye sharpe Bore speares.
Then the King commaunded the Kéepers to vncouche the Bore, and that euerye person béeing within the Toile should go to a standing, among whome were dyuers Gentlemen and Yeomen of Englande· and incontinent the Bore issued out of his den, and followed with an hounde, came into plaine, where béeing scaled a whyle, and gazing vpon the people, and incontinent pierced by the hounde, he spyed a lyttle bushe standing behinde a banke ouer a ditche (vnder the whiche laye two Frenche Gentlemen) and thither fledde, trusting there to haue defended himselfe, who thrust his head snuffing into the same bushe, whyche caused the two Gentlemen to flye from thence, as from the danger of death.
Then was the Bore by pursuite of Hunters and the hounde, driuen from thence, who ranne straighte to one of the Cardinalles foote·men, a very ta yong Yeoman, who hadde in his handes a line, with the whiche he was faine to defende hymself from the Bore a greate while, the Bore continually at hym with his tuskes, so that he was faine at laste to pitche his Iaueline in the grounde betwéene him and the Bore: the whiche the Bore brake with the force of hys foyning, and with that the yeoman drew hys sword, and stoode at defence, and therewith the Hunters came to the rescue, and putte him once againe to flight, with that he fledde to an other yong Gentleman of England called Maister Henry Ratcliffe, who was sonne and heyre to the Lorde Fitz Walter, who had borrowed by chance of a Frenche· Gentleman a very fine and sharp Bore speare, where with he thruste the Bore in the mouth, and so into the throate. wherevpon the pastime was ended.
The Cardinall passing diuers dayes in consultation, in other matters, expecting the returne of Christopher Gunner, at the laste he returned with letters againe, vppon receite whereof the Cardinall intended to remoue: being then at Masse in hys Closet, he consecrated the Chauncelour of Fraunce Cardinall, and putte vppon hym his Habite, hys Hatte, and Cap of Scarlet, and then tooke hys iourney, returning againe into Englande, makyng suche necessary expedition, that he came to where he was nobly receyued by the Lorde Sandes then Capitaine there, wyth all the retinue of the same.
And from thence he rode to Calleis, where he tarryed the shipping of his stuffe, horses, and aine.
And in the meane time, he stablished there a Marte all nations.
These things and other for the weale of the Towne and Garrison by him perfecte, he tooke shipping ued at Douer the xxiiij. of September, from whence he de to the Courte, the King being in hys Progresse at
Henrie Wiats house in Kent, he wente immediately to hym with whome he hadde long talke, and continued twoo or three dayes there in the Courte, and then retourned to hys house at Westminster.
Such scarcitie of bread was in London, and al England, that many dyed for default thereof: the King of his goodnesse sent to the Citie of his own prouision
quarters, or else for one wéeke there had bin little breade.
The bread cartes co~ming fro~ Stratford toward London were met at y^
Myle by the Citizens, so that the Maior and Sheriffes were forced to goe and rescue the same Eartes, and to fée them broughte to the Markets appointed.
Wheate was then at fiftéene shillings the quarter: but shortly after the Merchants of the Stiliarde broughte from Danske she store of Wheate and Rie, that the same was better cheape to be solde in London than in any other part of the Realme besides.
of October After the beginning of the Terme, the Cardinall caused to be assembled in the Starre Chamber, all the Noblemen, Iudges and Iustices of Peace that were in Westminster hall at that tyme present, and there made to them a long Oration, declaring the cause of his Embassade into Fraunce, and of his procéedings there: among the whyche he saide he had concluded such an amitie, as neuer was heard in the realm before, as well betwéen the Emperour and vs, as betwéene the King our Soueraigne and the Frenche King, with a perpetuall peace, the whyche should be confirmed in writyng, sealed in fine Golde: affyrming further, that the Kyng of Englande should receiue yearly his tribute by that name out of the Dutchie of Normandie, wyth all the costes whyche hée had sustained in the warres: And also, where there was a restraint made in Fraunce of the Frenche Quéenes Dowrie, (whome the Duke of Suffolke had married) for diuers yeres during the wars, it was concluded, that she should not onelye receiue it againe, but also the arrerages that were payed.
This peace thus concluded, there shoulde be suche an amitie betwéene the Gentlemen of eache realme and of Merchants, that it shoulde séeme to al men both territories to be but one Monarchie, &c.
The twentith of October were receyued into London certaine oute of Fraunce, aboute eyghte in number, of the moste noble and worthye Gentlemenne in all Fraunce they were lodged in the Bishops Pallaice in Paules Churchyard· to whome Noblemen resorted, and gaue them dyuers presents, especially the Maior of the Citie of London.
Then they resorted vnto the Courte, béeyng at Greenewiche, where they were receiued by the King.
They hadde Commission to establishe the King in the order of Fraunce, for whome they broughte, for that intente, a collar of fine Golde, with the Michaell hanging thereat, and Robes to the same order appertenant, the whiche was of blewe richly embrodered.
And the King to gratifie the French with the semblable, he sent a noble man of the order here in Englande, with Garter the Harrault into France, to establishe the Frenche King in the order of the Garter, with emblable collar, wyth a Garter and Robes accordyng to the same.
The Embassadors remayning here vntil theyr returne, things béeyng concluded concerning the perpetuall peace vppon solempne ceremonies and othes contained in certain Instruments touching the same, whych was confirmed by receyuing of the Sacrament in Paules Churche of London by the King, and the Graund Maister of France, who represented the King his Maister, and there the instrumentes were with Golde, and the King put his hande therevnto, and the Graund Maister did the lyke: betwéene whome the Cardinall diuided the Sacrament: And that done, they derted, the King rode wyth the Cardinall to Westminster, and there dyned wyth all the Frenche men, passyng the day after with consultation of waightie matters touchyng the conclusion of the saide article of the perpetuall peace.
The King then againe by water to Greenewich, at whose departing it was concluded by the Kings deuice, that al the Frenche men shoulde resorte to Richemonde, and hunt in euerye one of the Parkes there: and from thence to Hampton Courte, and there to hunt, and the Cardinall to make there a supper or banquet, or both to them.
And from thence they should ryde to Windsore, and there to hunt: And after to returne to London, so to Greenewich, there to banquet with the King.
Then was there made preparation of all thyngs for this greate assemblye at Hampton Court: the Cardinall called before him his principal Officers, as Stewarde, Treasorer, Comptroller, and Clearke of hys Kitchin to whome he declared his minde, touchyng the entertainement of the Frenche men at Hampton Courte: his pleasure to them knowne, they sent out Caters, Purueyors and other, the Cookes wrought both night daye in suttleties, the Yeomen and Grooms of the Wardrobes were busied in hanging of the Chambers, and furnishing the same wyth beds of silke and other furniture· there were prouided
beds furnished with all manner of furniture to them belonging.
The daye was come to the French men assigned, and they ready assembled before the houre of their appointme~t, wherefore the officers caused them to ryde to orth, a place and a Parke of the Kings wythin thrée myles, there to hunt the day vntill night, at whyth time they returned againe to Hampton Courte, euery of them conueyed to theyr seuerall Chambers, hauing in them greate ers and for their comforte, remayning there vntil the Supper was ready.
The Chambers where they supped and banqueted, were ordered in this sort: First, the great wayting Chamber was hanged with rich Arras, as none were better than other, and furnished with tall yeomen to serue.
There were sette Tables rounde aboute the Chamber banquet wise couered, a Cupborde was there garnished with whyte siluer Plate, hauing also in the same Chamber to giue the more light, foure plates of siluer sette with greate lightes, and a greate fire of wood and coales.
The nexte Chamber, being the Chamber of Presence, was hanged with verye riche arras, and a sumptuous cloth of estate furnished with many goodly Gentlemen to serue the Tables ordered in maner as the other Chamber was, sauing that the highe Table was remoued beneath the cloth of Estate towarde the middest of the Chamber couered.
Then was there a Cupborde, being in length as broade as the Chamber, with sixe Desks of haight, garnished wyth guilt Plate, wyth lightes one payre of Candlestickes of Syluer and guylte, béeyng curiously wrought, whyche cost thrée hundred Markes, and standyng vpon the same twoo lightes of Waxe burning as byg as Torches to set it forth.
This Cupborde was barred rounde aboute, that no manne coulde come nighe it, for there was none of all this Plate touched in this ba~quet, for there was sufficient besides.
The Plates that hong on the walles to giue light were of siluer and guilte, hauyng in them great pearchers of Waxe burning, a greate fire in the Chimney, all other things necessary for the furniture of so noble a feaste.
The Officers discréetely conducted these Noblemen from theyr Chambers into the Chamber where they shoulde sup, and caused them there to sette downe, and that done, their seruice came vppe in suche abundance both costlye and full of suttleties, and with suche a pleasaunte noyse of instruments of Musike, that the Frenche men (as it séemed) were rapte into a heauenly Paradice.
The Cardinall was not yet come, but they were mery and pleasant.
Before the seconde course, the Cardinall came in booted and spurred, all sodainely amongest them, and bade them Proface, at whose comming there was greate ioy, wyth rysing euerye man from his place.
The Cardinall caused the~ to sit still and kéepe their roumes, and beyng in hys apparell as he rode, called for a chayre and sate in the midst of the highe Table.
Anone came vppe the seconde course, with so many dishes, suttleties, and deuises, aboue a hundred in number, whiche were of so goodly proportion and costly, that think the French men neuer sawe the like, the wonder was no lesse than it was worthy indéede.
There were Castels wyth Images, in the same Paules Church, for the quantitie, as counterfaited, as the Paynter shoulde haue painted it on a cloth or wall.
There were beastes byrdes, and personages, moste likely made and counterfaited, some fightyng wyth Swordes, some wyth Gunnes, and Crossebowes, some vaughting and leaping, some dauncing with Ladyes, some on horses in complete harnesse, iustyng wyth long sharpe Speares, with many moe deuises.
Among al other was a chesse boorde made of spiced Plate, with menne there of the fame: and for the good proportion, and bycause the French meune be verye experte in that playe, my Lorde Cardinall gaue the same to a Gentleman of France, commaunding there shoulde be made a goodly cace for the preseruation thereof in all haste, that he might conuey the same into hys Countrey.
Then tooke my Lord a bole of Gold filled with Ipocrase, and putting off hys Cappe, sayde: drinke to the Kyng my Soueraigne Lord, and next vnto the King your Master, therwith dranke a good draught: and when he had done, he desired the Graund Maister to pledge hym Cuppe and all, the whyche was well worth fiue hundred Markes, and so caused all the bourdes to pledge these twoo royall Princes: then wente the Cuppes so merily aboute, that manye of the Frenche menne were faine to be ledde to their beddes.
Then rose vppe the Cardinall, and went into hys Chamber, to pul off his Bootes, and to shifte hym, and then wente he to supper in his priuie Chamber· and making a verye shorte supper, returned into the Chamber of Presence among the Frenche menne, vsing them so louingly and familiarly, that they coulde not commende hym too muche: and whilest they were in communication and other pastimes, al their Lyueries were serued to their Cha~bers, euerye Chamber hadde a Bason and an Ewer of siluer, a great liuery pot of siluer, some guilt, yea and some chamber hadde two Lyuerie pots wyth Wine and Béere: a siluer Candlesticke, both white and plaine, hauing in it twoo cizes, and a staffe torche of Ware, a fine Manchet and a chete loafe.
Thus was euerye Chamber furnished through al the house: And yet the Cupbords in the two banquetting Chambers not once touched.
Thus, when it was more than time conuenient, they were conueyed to their lodgings, where they rested that night.
In the morning they dyned with the Cardinall, and so departed to Windsore.
After the returne of the strangers from Windsore, which place with the order therof they much commended.
The day approched that they were by the king inuited to the Courte, where firste they dyned, and after and other pastimes by them done, the time of supper came on.
Then was the Banquetting Chamber in the tylte yarde at Greenewiche, to the whyche place these strangers were conducted by the noblest personages in the court, where they didde bothe sup and banquet, the straunge and wonderful deuises of dishes and suttleties whereof, as farre passed the banquet at Hampton Court, as Golde doth Siluer in valewe of waighte for waight.
In the middest of this banquet, there was at the barryers with lustie Gentlemen in compleate harnesse very gorgeous on foote.
And after all this was the moste goodlyest disguysing or Enter lude made in Latine, the Players beyng so riche, and of so strange deuises, that it passeth all comparison.
Thys done, there came suche a number of the fayrest Ladyes and Gentlewomen that bare any brute of beautie in all the Realme in moste richest apparell that mighte be deuised, with whome the Gentlemen of Fraunce daunced, vntil a gorgeous Maske came in of Gentlemen, who daunced and masked with these Ladies.
This done, came in a Maske of Ladyes: these Ladyes tooke eache of them one of the French men to daunce and to maske: these women Maskers spake good French to the French men, which delighted them very much.
Thus was this nighte consumed, from fiue of the clocke vntill thrée of the clocke after midnight, and then euerye man departed to their lodgings.
After all thys solempue chéere, at a daye appoynted, they resorted to the Court to take their leaue of the King and other noblemen: then came they to Westminster vnto the Cardinall, of whom they receyued the Kings rewards, the whyche were these: euerye man of honor and estimation had Plate, some to the valewe of thrée or foure hundred pound, and some more and some lesse, besides other greate gifts receyued before of the King, as gownes of Ueluet with riche Furres, greate chaynes of Golde, and goodlye horses, wyth dyuers other giftes, and the leaste of them had a summe of crowns of Golde: the worste Page amongest them hadde twentie Crownes for hys parte: and beyng thus nobly rewarded, they departed.
Frenche Craer, of thirtie Tunne, being manned wyth eighte and thirtie Feenche menne, and a Flemish Craer of seauen and twentie Tunne, and foure and twentie Flemings, méeting at Margate, the one chaced the other along the riuer of Thamis to the Tower Wharffe of London, where sir Edmond Walsingham Lieuetenaunte of the Tower, stayed them both, and tooke bothe their Captaines and men.
The xvij. of June, the Terme was adiorned to Mihelmasse, bycause of the sweating sicknesse that then raigned in the Citie of London, and there was no such watch at Midsomer, as before time had bin accustomed.
The seauenth of October, came to London a Legate from Rome, called Lawrence Campaius Cardinall, and by the Kings gift, Bishop of Salisburie, who was lodged at Bath Place without Temple barre.
prisoner brake from the Sessions hall at Newgate whe~ the Sessions was done, which prisoner was brought downe out of Newgate in a Basket, he séemed so weake, but now in the end of the Sessions he brake through the people to the Grey Friers Church, and there was kept sixe or seauen dayes ere the Sheriffes could speake with him, and then bycause he would not abiure and aske a Crowner, with violence they tooke him thence, and cast hym agayne in prison, but the law serued not to hang him.
Commissioners were sent some to Oxford, some to Cambridge, some to Louayne, Paris, Orleance, Bonony, Padua, &c. to knowe the opinions of the learned in those Uniuersities, concerning the marriage betwixt King Henry and Quéene Katherine sometime his brothers wife, which marriage séemed to them to bée vnlawfull, as was affirmed vnder the perticular seale of euery Uniuersititie.
In the moneths of Aprill, May, June, and July, Cardinall Campeius the Legate, with Cardinall Wolsey, sate at the Blacke Friers in London, where before them was brought in question the Kings mariage with Quéene Katherine, as to be vnlawfull, where these two Legates sate as Judges, before whome, the King and Quéene were assited and sommoned to appeare.
The Court was platted in tables and benches in manner of a Consistorie, one seate reysed higher for the Judges to sitte in, then as it were in the midst of the said Judges al oft aboue them thrée degrées high, was a cloth of Estate hanged, with a Chaire royall vnder the same, wherein sate the King, and besides him, some distance from him sate the Quéene, and vnder the Judges féete sate the Scribes, and other officers: the chiefe Scribe was Doctor Stephens, and the caller of the Court was one Cooke of Winchester.
Then before the King and the Judges within the Court sate the Archbishop of Canterbury Warham, and all the other Bishops.
Then stoode at both endes within, the Counsellours learned in the Spirituall Lawes, as well the Kings as the Quéenes.
The Doctors of Law for the King, were Doctor Simpson, Doctor Bell, and diuers other, and Proctors on the same side were Doctor Peter, Doctor with others.
On the other side for the Quéene, were Doctor Fisher, Doctor Standish, and Doctor Ridley.
The Judges commanded silence whilest their commisson was red, both to the Court, and to the people assembled.
That done, the Scribes commaunded the Crier to call the King by the name of King Henry of England, come into the Court, &c. with that the King answered, and sayde héere: then called hée the Quéene by the name of Katherine Quéene of Englande, come into the Court, &c. who made no answere, but rose out of hir Chaire, and bycause she could not come to the King directly, for the distance seuered betwéene them, she wente aboute by the Court, and came to the King, knéeling downe at hys féete, to whome she sayde in effect as followeth: Sir (quoth she) desire you to do me iustice and right, and take some pitie vpon me, for am a poore woman· and a Stranger, borne out of your Dominion, hauing héere no indifferent Counsell, and lesse assurance of Frendship: Alas Sir, what haue offended you, or what occasion of displeasure haue shewed you, intending thus to put me from you after this sorte? take God to my Judge, haue bin to you a true and humble wife, euer confirmable to your will and pleasure, that neuer contraryed or gaynesayde any thing thereof, and béeing alwayes contented with all things wherein you had anye delight, whether little or much, without grudge or displeasure: loued for your sake all them whome you loued, whether they were my friendes or enimies.
haue bin your wife these twentye yeares and moe, and you haue had by me dyuers Children, if there be any iust cause that you can alledge agaynste me, eyther of dishonestie, or matter lawfull to put me from you, am contente to departe to my shame and rebuke, and if there be none, then pray you to let me haue Justice at youre hande.
The King your father was in hys tyme of excellente witte, and the King of Spayne my Father Ferdinando was reckned one of the wisest Princes that raigned in Spayne many yeares before: it is not to be doubted, but that they had gathered as wise Counsellours vnto them of euery Realme, as to their wisedomes they thought méete, who thought the marriage betwéene you and me good and lawfull, &c. wherefore, humblye desire you to spare me, untill may knowe what councell my friendes in Spayne wyll aduertise me to take, and if you will not, then youre pleasure bée fulfilled: and wyth that, she arose vp, making a low curtesie to the King, and departed from thence.
The King béeyng aduertised that she was ready to goe out of the house, commanded the Crier to call hir agayne, who called hir by these wordes, Katherine Quéene of Englande, come into the Courte, wyth that quoth Mayster Griffith, Madame, you bée called agayne, on on (quoth she) it maketh no matter, wyll not tarrie, goe on youre wayes: and thus she departed, wythoute anye further aunswere at that tyme, or anye other, and neuer woulde appeare after in any Court.
The King perceyuing she was departed, sayde these wordes in effect: For as much (quoth he) as the Quéene is gone, will in hir absence declare onto you all.
She hathe bene to me as true, as obediente, and as confirmable a wife, as would wish or desire, she hath all the vertuous qualities that ought to be in a woman of hir dignitie, or in any other of a baser estate, she is also surely a noble woman borne, hir conditions will well declare the same: with that quoth the Cardinall Wolsey, Sir, most humbly require your highnesse, to declare before all this audience, whether haue bin the chiefe and first mouer of this matter vnto your Maiestie or no, for am greatly suspected héerein.
My Lord Cardinall (quoth the King) can well excuse you in this matter, mary (quoth he) ye haue bin rather against me, in the tempting héereof, than a setter forward or mouer of the same: the speciall cause that moued me vnto this matter, was a certayne scrupulositie that pricked my co~science, vpon certaine words spoken at a time when it was, by the Bishop of Bayon the French Embassador, who had bin hyther sente vpon the debating of a marriage to be concluded betwéene our daughter the Lady Mary, and the Duke of Orleance; second sonne to the King of France, and vpon the resolution and determination of the same, he desired respect to aduertise the King his mayster thereof, whether our daughter Mary should be legitimate in respect of this my marriage with this woman, being sometime my brothers wife, which once conceyued within the secret bottome of my conscience, engendred suche a scrupulous doubt, that my conscience was incontiently accombred, vexed and disquieted, whereby thought my selfe to bée greatly in danger of Gods indignation, which appeared to be (as me séemed) the rather, for that he sente vs no issue male, and all such issues male as my said wife had by me, died incontient after they came into the worlde, so that doubted the great displeasure of God in that behalfe, thus my conscience being tossed in the waues of a scrupulous conscience, and partly in despaire to haue any other issue than had already by this Lady now my wife, it behoued me further to consider the state of this Realme, and the danger that it stoode in for lacke of a Prince to succéede me, thought it good in releasse of the weighty burthou of my ake conscience, and also the quiet estate of this worthy Realme, to attempt the law therein, whether may, lawfully take another more lawfully by whome God may sende me more issue, in case this my first copulation was not good, without any carnall and not for and displeasure or misliking of the Quéenes person and age, with whome would be as well contented to continue, if our marriage may stand with the Lawes of God, as with any woman aliue, in which poynt· consisteth all this doubt that we go about now to trie, by the learning, wisedome, and iudgement of you our Prelates and pastoures of all this our Realme and domini now héere assembled for that purpose, to whose conscience learning haue committed the charge and iudgement, according to the whiche, will (God willing) be right well content to submit my and for my part obey the same, wherein, after that perceyued my so dtfull, moued it in confession to you then Ghostly Father, and as much as self were in some doubt, you ued me to the counsell of all you my Lords, wherevpon, moued you my Lord of Canterbury, first to haue your ence, in as much as you were Metropolitane, to put this matter in question, and so of all you my Lordes, to which you granted vnder your Seales, héere to be shewed: that is truth quoth the Archbishop of Canterbury.
After that, the King rose vp, and the Court was adiourned vntill another day.
The next Court day, the Cardinals sate againe, at which time, the Counsell on both sides were there to answere: the Kings Counsell alledged the Matrimonie not to be lawfull at the beginning, bycause of the nall copulation had betwéene Prince Arthure and the Quéene.
This matter being very vehemently touched on that side, and to proue it, they alledged many reasons and ilitudes of truth, and being answered negatiuely againe in the other side, it séemed that all their former allegations were doubtfull to be tryed, and that no man knewe the truth.
And thus this Court passed from Sessions to Sessions, and day to day, that at certayne of their Sessions the King sent the two Cardinalles to the Quéene (who was then in Bridewell to perswade with hir by their wisedomes, and to aduise hir to surrender the whole matter into the Kings hands by hir owne consent and will, which should be much better to hir honour, than to stand to the triall of Law, and thereby to be condemned, whiche shoulde séeme much to hir dishonour.
The Cardinalles béeing in the Queenes Chamber of presence, the Gentleman Usher aduertised the Quéene, that the Cardinalles were come to speake with hir with that the rose vp, and with a Skeyne of white about hir ke, came into hir· Chamber of presence, where the Cardinalles were attending, at whose comming, quoth what is your pleasure with me: if it please your Grace (quoth Cardinall Wolsey to goe your Chamber, we will shew you the cause of oure comming: my Lord (quoth she) if yée haue any thing to say, speake it openly before all these fke, for feare nothing that yée can say against me, but that would all the worlde should heare and sée it, and therefore speake your minde.
Then began the Cardinall to speake to hir in Latine, nay good my Lord (quoth she) speake to me in (quoth the Cardinall) good Madame, if it please you, we come both to knowe your mind how you are disposed to do in this matter betwéene the King and you, and also to declare secretly our opinions and councell vnto you, whiche we do only for very zeale and obedience we beare vnto your Grace.
My Lord (quoth she) thanke you for youre god will, but to make you answere in your request, can not so sodeinly, for was set among my Maydes at worke, thinking full little of any such matter, wherein there néedeth a longer deliberation, and a better head than mine to make answere, néede of councell in this case which toucheth me so néere: and for my councel or friendship that can find in England, they are not for my profite: what thinke you my Lords, will any Englishman councell me, or be friendly to me against the Kings pleasure, that is his subiect? nay as for my Counsell in whome will put my trust, they be not here, they be in Spayne in mine owne Countrey: and my Lordes, am a poore woman lacking witte to answere to any such noble persons of wisedome as you be, in so waightie a matter, therefore pray you be good vnto me poore woman, destitute of friends héere in a forrayne region, and your counsell also will be glad to heare: and therewith she tooke the Cardinall by the hand, and le~dde him into hir priuie Chamber with the other Cardinall, where they tarried a season talking with the Quéene, which communication ended, they departed to the King, making to him relation of hir talke.
Thus this case went forward fro~ Court to Court, till it came to Judgemente, so that euery men expected the iu~dgement would be giuen the next day, at which day the King came thither, and set him downe in a Chaire within a dore, in the end of y^
Galery (which opened directly against the iudgeme~t seate) to heare the iudgement giuen, at which time, all their procéedings were openly red in Lattin.
That done, the Kings Counsell at y^ barre called for iudgeme~t, with y^ (quoth Cardinall Campeius wil not giue iudgeme~t till haue made relation to y^
Pope of all our procéedings, whose councel co~mandeme~t in this se wil obserue: the case is very doubtful, also the party defenda~t wil make no answer héere, but doth rather apeale fro~ vs, supposing y^ we be not indifferent, wherefore will ourne this Court for this time, according to the order of y^
Court of Rome, and with y^ the Court was dissolued, no more done.
This protracting of the conclusion of the matter, Henry tooke very displeasa~tly.
Cardinall Campeius toke his leaue of the K. and Nobilitie, returned towards Rome.
Ralph Rowlet Goldsmith was chosen Sheriffe of Lo~don by commons, but y^
King wrote for him, he was for y^ yeare ged, then was chosen Walter Champion Draper.
The day of October, the Dukes of Suffolke and of Nonffolke come to the Cardinall then being at Westminster, to whome then declared that the Kings pleasure was that he should surrender vp the great Seale into their handes, and to depart simply vnto Asher, which was an house scituate nigh vnto Hampton Court, belonging to the Bishopricke of Winchester.
The Cardinall demanded of them their commission that gaue them such, authoritie, who answered againe that they were sufficient commissioners, and had authoritie to doe no lesse by the Kings mouth, notwithstanding, he woulde in no wise agrée in that behalfe, withoute further· knowledge of their authoritie, saying, that the great Seale was deliuered him by the Kings person, to enioy the ministration with the roome of the Chancellor, for the tearme of his life, whereof for his suretie, he had the Kings letters pattents: which matter was greatly debated betwéene them, with many great wordes, in so much, that the Dukes were sayne to depart againe without their purpose, and to Windesore to the King, and made report accordingly, but the next day they returned againe, bringing with them the Kings letters.
Then the Cardinal deliuered vnto them the great Seale, and was content to departe simply, taking with him nothing but only certayne prouision for his house and after long talke betwéene him and the Dukes they departed with the great Seale of England, and brought the same to the King.
Then the Cardinal called al his Officers before him, and tooke accompt of them for all such stuffe whereof they had charge, and in his Galrey were diuers Tables, wherevpon lay a great number of goodly rich stuffe as whole péeces of Silke of all coloures, Sattin, Damaske, Taffata, Grograine, other things.
Also, there lay a thousand péeces of fine Holla~d cloth.
There was layd on euery Table, Bookes, reporting the contents of the same, and so was there Inuentories of all things it order against the Kings comming.
He caused to be hanged the walles of the Gallory on the one side, with cloth of Gold, cloth of Tissue, cloth of Siluer, and rich cloth of Bodken of diuers colours.
On the other side were hanged the richest suite of Coapes of his owne prouision made for hys Colledges of Oxford and Ipswich, that euer was séene in England.
Then had he two Chambers adioyning to the Galerie, the one most commonly called the gilt Chamber, and the other the Counsell Chamber, wherein were set vp two broade and long Tables vpon trestles, wherevpon was set suche a number of plate of all sortes, as was almost incredible.
In the gilt Chamber were set out vpon the Table nothing but gilt plate, and vpon a Cupbord and in a window was set no plate but Gold, very rich: and in the Counsell chamber was all white and parcell gilt plate, and vnder the Table in baskets was all olde broken Siluer plate, and Bookes set by them, purporting euery kinde of plate, and euery parcell, with the contents of the ounces thereof.
Thus was all things prepared, giuing charge of all the said stuffe, with all other remaining in euery Office, to be deliuered to the King, to make answere to their charge: for the order was such, that euery Officer was charged with ye receipt of the stuffe belonging to his Office by Indenture.
To Sir William Gascoine being his Treasurer, he gaue the charge of the deliuerie of the said goodes, and therewithal, with his traine of Gentlemen and yeomen, he tooke his Barge at the priuie staires, and so wente by water vnto Putney, where, when he was arriued, he tooke his Moyle, and euery man tooke their Horsses, and rode streight to Ashere, where he and his family continued the space of thrée or four wéekes, without either beddes, shéetes, table clothes, or dishes to eate their meate in, or wherwith to buy any: the Cardinall was forced to borow of the Bishop of Carelile, plate and dishes &c.
The xxvj. of October, Sir Thomas Moore was made Chancellour of England.
William Tindall, after he had translated the new Testament into English, he caused the same to be printed beyond the Seas.
peace was agréed betwéene the Emperour, and the Kings of England, France, Boheme, and Hungary.
In the moneth of October, the King came to his Place of Bridewell, where he and his Nobles put on their Robes, and went to the Blacke Friers, and began there a Parliame~t, in ye which, the Cardinall was conde~ned in the Premunire.
The eyght of December, was created Thomas Uiscount Rochford Earle of Wilshire: Robert Uiscount Fitz Water Earle of Sussex: and George Lord Hastings, Earle of Huntington, at Yorke Place by Westminster.
The thirtéenth of January, a great fire was in the Uintrie at London.
Cardinall Wolsey after great suite made to the King, was licenced to remoue from Ashere to Richmond, whyche place, he had a little before repaired with great costes, for the King had made an exchange therof with him for Hampton Court.
The Cardinall hauing licence of the King to repaire to Richmond, made hast thither, and lodged there in the Lodge of the great Parke, which was a very pretie house, there he lay vntill the beginning of Lent, then he remoued into the Charterhouse of Richmond, where he lay in a lodging which Doctor Collet made for himselfe, vntill he remoued Northward, which was in the Passion wéeke after, and euery day he resorted to the Charterhouse there, and would sitte with one of the most auntient fathers, who perswaded him to despise the vayne glorie of the world.
Then prepared the Cardinall for his iourney into the North, and sente to London for liuerie clothes for his seruants, and so rode from Richmond to Hendon, from thence, to a place called the Rye, the next day to Raystone, where he lodged in the Priorie, the next day to Huntingdon, and there lodged in the Abbey, the next day to Peterborow, and there lodged in the Abbey, where he abode all the next wéeke, where he kept hys Easter, his traine was in number
persons: vpon Mau~die Thurseday he made his Maundy, there hauing
pore me~, whose féete he washed, gaue euery one xij. d. in money, iij. elles of good Canuas, a paire of shoes, a cast of redde hearings, and iij. white hearings, and one of them had ij. s~.
On Thurseday next after Easter, he remoued to Maister Fitz Williams, sometime a Merchant Taylor of London, and then of the Kings Councell: the next wéeke he remoued to Stamford, the next day to Grantham, the nexte day to Newarke, and lodged in the Castell that night, and the next day also: from thence, he rode to Southwell, where he continued most part of all that Sommer, vntill the latter end of grasse time, and then he rode to Scroby, where he continued vntill Michaelmasse, and then to Cawood Castell, within seauen miles of Yorke, whereof we will speake more héereafter.
The xvj. of May, a ma~ was hanged in chaines in Finsburie field, for murthering Doctor Miles, Uicar of S. Brides.
The xxv. of May, K. Henry commanded the Bishops to call in Tindals translatio~ of the new Testament, and to sée another truly translated to be set forth.
K. Henry vpon occasion of delay made by the Pope in his controuersie of diuorcement, and through displeasure of such reports as he heard had bin made of him to ye Court of Rome, thirdly, pricked forward by some counsellers to follow ye example of ye Germanes, caused proclamatio~ to be made the xix. of September, forbidding al his subiects to purchase any maner of thing from the Court of Rome.
This yeare, Ralph Rowlet was againe chosen Sheriffe for ye co~mons, and he would not take it vpon him, but went to Saint Albons: then on Michaelmasse euen, was chosen Robert Amadas Goldsmith, and the King wrote for him, so that he was excused.
On the morrow, which was Michaelmasse day, was chosen Richard Choppin Tallow Chandler, who was forthwith sworne in the Guild hall, and changed into a Gowne and Cloake of Scarlet, wyth a theine of Gold about his necke, and a Horse being prepared for him ready at ye Guild Hall Gate, he rode to Westminster.
The iiij. and v. of Nouember, was a great wind y^ blew downe many houses and trées, after the which winde followed so high a tide, that it drowned the marshes on Essex side and Kent, with the Ile of Thanet, and other places, destroying much Cattell.
Cardinall Wolsey lying at Cawood, helde there an honourable and plentifull house for all commers, and also built and repaired the Castell, which was greatly in decay, hauing artificers and labourers aboue
persons dayly in wages: and at length being therevnto perswaded by ye Doctors of ye Church of Yorke, he determined to be stauled there at Yorke Minster, the next Monday after Alhallowen day, against which time due preparation was made for the same, but not in such sumptuous wise, as his predecessors before him had vsed.
The day being once knowne vnto the worshipfull Gentleme~ of the Countrey, and other, as Abbots, Priors, hauing notice of his staulatio~, they sent in such prouision of victuall, that it is almost incredible, all whiche was vnknowne to the Cardinall, for as much as he was preuented and disappoynted of his purpose, by the reason that he was arrested of high Treason, as yée shall héereafter heare, so that most parte of this former prouision that spake of, was sent vnto Yorke the same day of his arrest, and the next day following: for his arrest was kept as close as could be, the order of his arrest was thus.
It was appoynted by the King and Counsell, that Sir Walter Walsh Knight, one of the Kings priuie Chamber, shoulde be sente downe with a Commission into the North vnto the Earle of Northumberland (who was sometime brought vp in house with the Cardinall) and they twaine being ioyntly in commissio~ to arrest the Cardinall of high Treason, Mayster Walsh tooke his Horsse at the Court gate, about noone, vpon Alhallowen day, towarde the Earle of Northumberland.
And now haue occasion to declare what happened aboute the same time, which peraduenture signified the troubles following to the Cardinall.
The Cardinall sitting at Dinner vpon Alhallowen day, hauing at his boordes ende dyuers Chaplaynes sitting at dinner, ye shall vnderstand that the Cardinalles great crosse stoode in a corner at the tables end, leaning against the hanging, and when the bordes end was taken vp, and a conuenient time for the Chaplaines to arise, one Doctor Augustine a Venetian, and Phisition to the Cardinall, rising from the table with the other, hauing vppon him a great gowne of boysteous Ueluet, ouerthrew the Crosse, whiche downe along the tappet, with the point of one of the Crosses, brake Doctor Bonars head, that the bloud ran downe, the company there standing, greatly astonied with the chance.
The Cardinall perceyuing the same, demanded what the matter meant of their sodeine amaze, and they shewed him of the fall of his Crosse vppon Doctor Bonars head: hath it (quoth he) drawne any bloud, yea forsooth my Lord (quoth they) with that he cast his head aside, and said shaking his head, Malum omen, and therewith said Grace, and rose from the Table, went to his Chamber.
Now marke the significatio~ how the Cardinal expounded this matter at Pomfret after his fall.
First, ye shall vnderstand that the Crosse which he bare as Archbishop of Yorke, signified himselfe, and Augustine the Phisition who ouerthrewe the Crosse, was only he that accused the Cardinall, whereby his enimies caught an occasion to ouerthrow him: it fell vpon Doctor Bonars head, who was Mayster of the Cardinals faculties and spirituall iurisdictions, was then damnified by the ouerthrow of the Crosse: yea, moreouer, drawing bloud of him, betokened death, which shortly after did ensue.
About which time of this mischance, the same very day and season Maister Walsh tooke his Horsse at the Court as nigh as could be iudged.
Now the appointed time drew néere of his staulation, and sitting at Dinner vpon the Friday next before the Monday, on the which day he intended to be stauled at Yorke, the Earle of Northumberland and Mayster with a great company of Gentlemen of the Earles house, and of the Countrey, whome he had gathered togither in the Kings name, came into ye Hall Cawod, the Officers being at Dinner, and the Cardinall not fully dined, being then in his fruites.
The first thing yt ye Earle did after he had set order in the hall, he comma~ded the Porter at the Gates to deliuer him ye keyes therof, who would in no wise obey his co~mandement, although he were roughly threatned, streightly co~manded in ye Kings name to make deliuery of the~ to one of the Earles seruants: Sir (quoth he) seeing that ye do but intend to set one of your seruants in my place to kéepe the Gates, knowe no seruant that ye haue, but am as able as he to do it, and kéepe the Gates to your purpose (whatsoeuer it be) and also the keyes were deliuered me by my Lord and Mayster, wherefore pray you to pardon me, for whatsoeuer ye shall commaund me to do in the ministratio~ of mine office, shall do it with good will: with that (quoth the Earle) hold him a Booke, co~maunded him to lay his hand theron: thou shalt (quoth he) that thou shalt well and truly kéepe the Gates to the Kings vse, and to doe all such things as we shall commaund, and that ye shal let passe neither in nor out at these Gates, but such as ye be commaunded by vs, and with this oth he receiued the keyes at the Earles hands.
Of all these doings knewe the Cardinall nothing, for they stopped the steire, so that none went vp to the Cardinals Chamber, and they that came downe, could no more go vp againe: at the last, one escaped, who shewed the Cardinall that the Earle was in the Hall, wherat the Cardinall maruelled, would not beléeue him, but co~maunded a Gentleman to bring him the truth, who going downe the staires, saw the Earle of Northumberland, and returned, and said it was very he: then (quoth the Cardinall) am that we haue dined, for feare our Officers be not prouided of any store of good fishe to make him some honourable chéere, let the Table stande (quoth he) with that he rose vp, and going downe y^ staires, he encountred the Earle co~ming vp with all his tayle, and as soone as the Cardinal espied y^
Earle, he put off his said, my Lord; ye be most hartily welcome, so embraced each other: then the Cardinall tooke the Earle by the hand, had him vp into the Chamber, whome followed all the number of the Earles seants.
From thence, he led him into his bedchamber, and they being there al alone, the Earle said vnto the Cardinall with a soft voice, laying his hande vpo~ his arme, my Lord, arrest you of high· Treason: with which words ye Cardinal being maruellously astonied, sta~ding both stil a good space, at the last (quoth the Cardinall) what authority haue you to arrest me: forsooth my L. (quoth Earle) haue a co~missio~ so to do: where is your co~mission (quoth he) that may sée it, nay sir that you may not sayde the Earle: well then (quoth the Cardinall) will not obey your rest.
But as they were debating this matter betwéene them in the Chamber, so busie was M. Walsh in arresting Doctor Augustine at the dore in ye pallace, saying vnto him, go in Traytor or shal make thée.
At the last, M. Walsh being entred the Cardinals Chamber, began to plucke off his hoode, and after knéeled down to the Cardinall, vnto whom the Cardinal said, come hither gentlema~ and let me speake with you, Sir, héere my Lord of Northumberland hath arrested me, but by whose authoritie he sheweth not, if ye be ioyned with him, pray you shew me Indéede my Lord (quoth M. Walsh he sheweth you the truth: well then (quoth the Cardinall) pray you let me sée it.
Sir, beséech you (quoth M. Walsh hold vs excused: there is annexed to our co~missio~ certaine instructions, which you may not sée: well (quoth ye Cardinall) trow ye are one of the Kings priuie Chamber, your name is Walsh, am content to yéeld to you, but not to my Lord of Northumberland without sée his commission: the worst in the Kings priuie Chamber is sufficie~t to arrest the greatest péere of the Realme by the Kings commandement, without any commission, therefore put your commission and authoritie in execution, spare not, will obey the Kings will.
take God to Judge, neuer offended the Kyng in worde nor déede.
Then the Earle called into the Chamber diuers Gentlemen of his owne seruauntes, and after they had taken the Cardinalles keyes from him, they put him in custodie of the Earles Gentlemen, then they went about the house to set all things in an order: the~ sent they Doctor Augustine· away to London with as much spéede as they could, who was boune vnto the Horsse like a Traytor, but it was Sunday toward night ere the Cardinal was conuayd from Cawod, lodged that night in the Abbey of Pomfret.
The next day he remoued towarde Daneaster, and was there lodged at the blacke) Friers.
The nexte day he was remoued to Shefilde Parke, where the Earle of Shrewsburie with his Lady, and a traine of Gentleme~ and Gentlewomen receyued him with much honor, then departed all the great number of Gentlemen that conducted him thether: and the Cardinall being thus with y^
Earle of Shrewsburie, co~tinued there xviij. dayes after, vpo~ whome, the Earle appointed diuers Gentlemen to attend co~tinually, to sée that he should lacke nothing, béeing serued in his owne Chamber, as honourably as he had in his own house, and once euery day the Earle would repaire vnto him, commune with him.
After the Cardinall had thus remained with the Earle of Shrewsburie aboute a fortnight, it came to passe at a certaine time as he sate at his dinner in his own cha~ber, hauing at his boords end a messe of Gentlemen and Chaplaines to kéepe him company, toward y^ end of his dinner, when he was come to eating hys fruites, his colour was perceyued often to change, whereby he was iudged· not to be in good health, where vpon, one of his Gentlemen said, Sir, me séemes you are not well at ease, to whome he answered with a loude voice, forfooth no more am, for am (quoth he) taken with a thing about my stomacke, that lyeth there along, as colde as a whetstone, which is no more but wind, pray you go to the and enquire of him he haue any thing that wil breake winde vpward.
Then went he to the Earle, and him what estate the Cardinall was in, and what he desired: with that, the Earle caused the Poticarie to be called before him, and demanded of him if he had any thing that would breake wind vpward in a mans body, he answered he had such geare.
Apoticary fetched a white co~fectio~ in a fair paper, shewed to y^ erle; who co~manded one to giue ye assay therof before him, then y^ same to be brought to the Cardinall, who receiued it vp al at once into his mouth: but immediatly after surely, he auoided much wind vpward: (quoth he) ye may sée that it was but wind, nowe am well eased, thanke God, so rose fro~ the Table, went to hys prayers: that done, there came on him suche a loosenesse, that it caused him go to his stoole: not long after ye erle of Shrewsburie came into y^
Gallery to him, with whom ye Cardinall met: then sitting down vpon a bench, ye erle asked him how he did, he most lame~tably answered him, thanked him for his gentle entertainment: Sir (quoth the erle) if ye remember, ye haue often wished to come before the king, to make your answer· haue writte~ to ye King in y^ behalf, making him priuie of your lamentation that ye inwardly haue receiued for hys displeasure, who accepteth al your doings therin, as friends be accustoin'd to do in such cases, wherfore wold aduise you to plucke vp your hart, and be not agast of your enimies, doubt not but this your iorney to his highnesse shal be much to your aduancement.
The king hath sent for you that worshipful knight Maister Kingston, with him
of your old serua~ts, now of ye Guard, to the inte~t ye may safely come to his Maiestie: sir (quoth the Cardinal) trow Master Kingston is Co~stable of the Tower, what of that quoth y^ erle, assure you he is elected by ye king for one of your friends: Wel quoth the Cardinal, as God wil, so be it, am subiect to fortune, being a true man, ready to accept such chances as shal folow, there an end.
pray you where is Master Kingston, quoth the earle wil send for hym, pray you so do, th the Cardinal, at whose message he came, as soone as the Cardinal espyed him, he made hast to encounter him, at his co~ming he knéeled to him, saluted him in the kings behalf, who~ ye Cardinal barehaded offered to take vp, said: pray you stande vp, knéele not to me, am but a wretch repleat with miserie, not estéeming my selfe but as a vile vtterly cast away without desert as God knoweth. said Master Kingston with humble reuerence, Sir, y^
King hath him commonded vnto you: thanke his highnes the Cardinall, trust he be in health, yea quoth Maister Kingston, he commanded me to saye to you, that you shoulde assure your selfe that he beareth you as muche good wil as euer he did, willeth you to be of good chéere.
And where report hath bin made· y^ ye should co~mit against hym certain heinous crimes, which he thinketh to be vntrue, yet he can doe no lesse than to sende for you to your triall, to take your iorney to him at your owne pleasure, co~manding me to be attendant vpon you· Therfore sir pray you when it shall be your own pleasure to take your iorney, shall be ready to atte~da~ce: Maister Kingston quoth he, tha~ke you for your newes, sir, if were as lustie as haue béen but of late· would ride with you in post, but am diseased with a flixe that maketh me very weake, but shal wyth al spéede make me ready to ryde with you to morrow.
When night came, the Cardinall waxed very sicke with the laske, the whyche caused him continually to go to the stoole al that night· insomuch, that he had that night stooles: therefore in consideration of his infirmitie, they caused him to tarry al that day: and the next day he tooke his iorney with Maister Kingston and them of the Guard, til he came to an house of the Earle of Shrewsburies called Hardwike hall, where he lay al night very euill at ease· The nexte day he rode to Notingham, there lodged that night more sicke: and the nexte daye he rode to Leicester Abbey, and by the waye waxed so sicke, that he was almoste fallen from his Mule, so that it was night before he came to the Abbey of Leicester, where at his comming in at the Gates, the Abbot with al his met him with diuers Torches light, whome they honourablye receyued and welcommed: To whome the Cardinall sayde: Father Abbot, am come hyther to laye my bones among you, riding so still vntil he came to the of the Chamber, where he alighted from hys Mule, and Maister Kingston led him vppe the stayres, and as soone as he was in his Chamber he went to bedde· This was on the Satterday at nighte, and then encreased sicker and sicker, vntil Monday, that all men thought he woulde haue dyed: So on Tuisday Saint Andrewes euen, Maister Kingston came to hym and bade him good morrowe, for it was about of the clocke, and asked him howe he didde: Sir, quoth he, tarry but the pleasure of God, to render vppe my poore soule into his handes: not so r, quoth Maister Kingstone, wyth the grace of God, yée shall liue and doe verye well, if yée will be of good chéere: nay in good sooth Maister Kingstone, my disease is suche, that can not liue: for haue hadde some experience in Phisicke.
Thus it is, haue a fluxe with a continuall Feuer, the nature whereof is, that if there be no alteration of the same wythin eyghte dayes, either muste ensue excorrition of the or or else present death· and the beste of them is death, and as suppose thys is the eyghte daye, and if yée sée no alteration in me, there is no remedy, saue, though may liue a daye or twaine after, but death muste ensue: Syr, quoth Maister Kingstone, you bée in suche pensiuenesse, doubting that thing, that in good faith ye néede not.
Well, wel, Maister Kingstone quoth the Cardinall, sée the matter howe it is framed: but if hadde serued God as diligently as haue done the King, he woulde not haue gyuen me ouer in my grey haires: but this is the iuste rewarde that muste receiue for the diligent paines and study that haue hadde to doe him seruice, not regarding my seruice to God, but onelye to satisfie his pleasure: pray you haue me moste humbly commended vnto his Royall Maiestye, and beséeche him in my behalfe to call to hys Prince remembraunce, all matters procéeding betwéene hym· and me from the beginning of the worlde, and the progresse of the same, &c, Maister Kingstone farewell, can no more saye, but wishe all things to haue good successe, my tyme draweth on fast, and euen with that he beganne to drawe his speach at length, and his tongue to faile, his eyes béeyng sette· whose sighte fayled hym, then dydde they putte hym in remembraunce of Chryste hys Passion, sed Yeomen of y^ ard stand by to sée him dye, and to of his wor at his departure: and incontinent the clocke stroke eyght, and then he gaue vp the Ghost, and departed this present life, whych caused some to call to remembrance howe he saide the daye before, that at ght of the clocke they shoulde lose their Maister.
Here is the ende and fall of Pride arrogancie of men exalted by fortune to dignities: for in hys tyme he was the haughtiest man in all hys procéedings alyue, hauing more respecte to the honor of his person, than he had to his spirituall profession, wherein should be shewed all méekenesse, a charitie.

King Edward being about the age of sixetéene yeares ended his life at Grenewich on the sixth of July, when he hadde raigned sixe yeares fiue moneths, and odde dayes, and was buried at Westminster.
He was in this his youth a Prince of such towardnesse, in vertue, learning, and al godly gifts, as seldome hath bin sée the like.

The twelfth of July, worde was broughte to the Councell, beyng then in the Tower with the Ladye Iane, that the Lady Marie, eldest daughter to King Henrie the eighte was at Keninghall Castell in Norffolke, and wyth hir, the Earle of Bathe, sir Thomas Cornwallis and other, and also, that the Earle of Sussex, and Maister Henrie Ratcliffe his sonne were mmyng towardes hir: wherevppon, by spéedy Councell it was there concluded, that the Duke of Suffolke with certayne other Noblemen, should go towards the Lady Mary, to che hir vp to the Tower: thys was firste determined: but by night of the same daye, the saide voyage of the Duke of Suffolke was cleane dissolued, by the speciall meanes of the Lady Iane hys daughter, who takyng the matter heauily, wyth wéepyng teares, made request to the whole Councel, that hir father might at home in hir company.
Whervppon the Councel perswaded with the Duke of Northumberlande, to take that voyage vpon him, saying, that no man so therefore, bycause that he hadde atchieued the victorie in Norffolke once already, and was therefore so feared, none durste once lie vp their weapon against him: be that, he was the beste man of warre in the Realme, as well for the ordering of his Campes and Souldicures; bothe in battaile and in their tentes, as also by experience, knowledge and wisdome, he coulde bothe animate his army with wittie perswasions, and also pacifie and alay hys ennimyes pride wyth hys stowte courage, or else to dissuade them if néede were from their enterprise· Finally, said they, this is the short and long, the Quéene will in no wise graunte, that hir father shall take it vpon him: wherefore (quoth they) we thinke it good, if it may please your Grace, it lyeth in you to remedy the matter.
Well quoth the Duke then, since ye thinke it good, and mine will go, not doubting of your fidelitie to the Quéenes Maiestie, whych now leaue in youre custodie: so that nighte he sente for bothe Lordes, Knightes, and other that shoulde goe wyth hym, and caused all things to be prepared accordynglye: then wente the Councell in to the Ladye Iane, and tolde hir of theyr conclusion, who humblye thanked the Duke for reseruing hir father at home, and beséeched him to vse hys diligence, whereto he aunswered, that he woulde doe what in hym laye.
The morrowe following, greate preparation was made, the Duke early in the mornyng called for his owne harnesse, and sawe it made ready at Durham place, where he appointed all his retinue to méete.
The same daye Cartes were laden with Munition and Artillerie, and fielde péeces were set forwarde.
The same forenoone the Duke moued efte soones the Counsell to sende their powers after hym, as it was before determined, the same to méete wyth hym at Newe Market, and they promised they woulde.
He sayde further to some of them: My Lordes, and these other noble Personages, with the whole army that nowe goe forth, as well for the behalfe of you and yours, as for the establishing of the Quéenes highnesse, shall not only aduenture our bodies and lyues amongest the bloudy strokes and cruell of our aduersaries in the open fieldes, but also wée do leaue the conseruation of our selues, chyldren, families at home here with you, as altogyther committed to youre truth and fidelities, whome, if we thoughte ye woulde throughe malice, conspyracie, or dissention leaue vs youre friendes in the Bryars and betraye vs, wée coulde as well sundry wayes foresee and prouide for our owne safegards, anye of you, by betraying vs, can doe for yours.
But nowe vppon the onelye truste and faithfulnesse of youre honors, whereof we thinke our selues moste assured, wée do hazarde oure liues, whyche truste and promise if ye shall violate, hoping thereby of lyfe and promotion, yet shall not God coumpt you innocent of our blouds, neyther acquite you of the sacred and holy othe of allegeaunce made fréely by you to thys vertuous Lady the Quéenes highnesse, who by your and our enficement is rather of force placed there, than by hir ownséeking and request.
Consider also, that Gods cause, whyche is the preferment of hys worde, and of Papistes entraunce, hathe béene (as yée haue here before alwayes layde) the originall grounde wherevpon ye en at the firste motion graunted your goodwils and conts therevnto, as by your handes writing appeareth, and inke not the contrarye, but if yée meane deceyte, thoughs not forthewyth, yet hereafter God will reuenge the same.
can saye no more, but in thys trouble some tyme wysh you to vse constant heartes, abandoning all malice, enuye, and priuate affections: and therewithall the firste course for the Lords came vp, wherefore the Duke shut vp his talke wyth these wordes, not spoken to you in thys sorte anye mistruste haue of youre of whyche alwayes haue euer hitherto conceiued a trusty confidence, but haue put you in remembrance thereof what chance of variance so euer might grow amongst you in mine absence, and this pray you, wish me not worse good spéede in this iorney, than ye woulde haue to your selues.
My Lord, saith one of them, if ye mistruste anye of vs in this matter, your Grace is farre deceyued, for whyche of vs can washe hys handes cleane thereof? and if we shoulde shrincke from you as from one that were culpable, which of vs can excuse himselfe to be guiltlesse? therefore herein your doubt is too farre caste.
praye God it be (quoth the Duke:) let vs go to dinner: and so they sate downe.
After dinner the Duke wente in to the Quéene, where his Commission was by that tyme sealed, for his Lieutenantshippe of the army, and then tooke his leaue of hir, and so didde certaine other Lordes also.
Then as the Duke came through the Councell Cham+ber, he tooke his leaue of the Earle of Arundale, who prayed God be with his Grace, saying, he was sorie it was not his chance to goe with him and beare him companye, in whose presence he could finde in hys hearte to spende hys euen at his féete: then the Earle of Arundale tooke Thomas Louell the Dukes boy by the hande, and saide, farewel gentle Thomas with al my heart.
Then the Duke, with the L. Marques of Northampton, the Lorde Grey, and dyuers other, tooke their Barge, and went to Dirham place, and White hall, where that night they mustred theyr men: and the next day in the morning the Duke departed with the number of
And as they rode thorough saith the Duke to the Lorde Grey, the people preasse to sée vs, but not one sayeth God spéede vs.
The same daye sir Iohn Gates and other went oute a the Duke.
By this time worde was broughte to the Tower, that the Lady Mariae was ed to Castell in Suffolke· where the people of the Country almoste wholly resorted to h: that
Edmond sir Edward Hastings, and the Windsore, with were Quéene Marie
About this time, sixe ships well manned, that were to lye before Yarmouth, and to haue taken the Lady Mary if she had fled that way, were by force of weather driuen into the Hauen, where one Maister Iernigham was raysing power on the Ladye Maries behalfe, who hearing thereof, came thither, wherevppon the Captaines tooke a boate and wente to the Shippes, but the Saylers and souldiors asked Maister Iernigham what he woulde haue, and whether he would haue their Captaines or no, and he said yea, Mary saide they, ye shall haue them or we will throwe them into the bottome of the Sea, but the Captaines saide forthwith, that they would serue Quéene Mary willingly, and so broughte forth their men, and conueyed with them their great ordinaunce: Of the commyng of these Shippes the Ladye Mary was wonderfull ioyous, and afterwarde doubted little the Dukes puissaunce: but when newes therof was broughte to the Tower, eche manne there beganne to draw backward, and ouer that, word of a greater mischiefe was broughte to the Tower, that is to saye, that the Noblemens tenaunts refused to serue their Lords against Quéen Marie.
The Duke thoughte long for his succoures, and wrote somewhat sharplye to the councell at the Tower, in that behalfe, as well for lacke of men as of munition, but a flender aunsweare had he againe: And from that time forward, certaine of the Councell, to wéete, the Earle of Pembrooke, and sir Thomas Cheyney Lorde Warden, and other, sought to gette oute of the Tower to consulte in London, but coulde not yet.
The sixetéenth of Iuly, being Sonday, Doctor Ridley Bishoppe of London, by commaundement of the Councel, preahed at Paules Crosse, where he vehementlye perswaded the eople in the title of ye Lady Iane, late proclaimed Quéene, nd inueyed earnestly againste the title of Lady Mary, &c.
The same sixetéenth of Iuly, the Lorde Treasurer was ne oute of the Tower to his house in London at nighte, and rthwith about seauen of the clocke the Gates of the Tower vpon a sodayne were shut vppe, and the kayes borne vp to the Lady Iane, which was for feare of some packing in the Lorde Treasurer, but he was fetched agayne to the Tower, about twelue of the clocke in the night.
The xviij. daye, the Duke perceyuing, that the succours promised came not to him, and also, receyuing from some of the Councell Letters of discomforte, he returned from Bury backe agayne to Cambridge.
The ninetéenth of July, the Counsell, partelye moued with the right of the Lady Maries cause, partly considering, that the moste of the realme, was wholy bent on hir side, changed theyr minds and assembled themselues at Castel, where they communed with the Earle of Pembrooke, and immediately with the Maior of London, certaine Aldermen, the Sheriffes, Garter King at Armes, and a Trumpet, came into Cheape, where they proclaymed the Ladye Mary daughter to King Henry the eyght, and Quéene Katherine, Quéene of Englande, Fraunce and Irelande Dofendor of the Faith, &c. and the same night the Earle of Arundele the Lord Paget rode in poste to Quéene Mary.
The xx. of July, Iohn D. of Northumberlande, hauing sure knowledge, y^ the Lady Mary was by the nobilitie others of the Councell remayning at London proclaymed Quéene: aboute fiue of the clocke the same night, he with suche other of the Nobilitie as were in his company, came to the Market Crosse, and callyng for an Harrault, hymselfe proclaymed Quéene Mary, and among other he threwe vppe owne Cap, and wythin an houre after he had Letters from the Councell (as he said) that he shoulde forthwith his army, and not to come within tenne myles of London· if he did, they woulde fight wyth hym, the rumour was no sooner abroade, but euerie man departed.
And short+lye after, the Duke was arrested in the Kings Colledge one Maister Slegge Sergeant at Armes.
At the laste, let+ters were brought from the Councell at London, that al shoulde goe eche his way: Wherevpon the Duke sayde them that kepte him, yée doe me wrong to withdrawe my libertie, sée you not the Counsels letters wythoute exception, that all men shoulde go whither they would.
At which wordes, they that kepte hym and the other Noblemen, sete them at libertie, and so contynued they for that night, insomuche, that the Earle of Warwicke was readye in the morning to haue rode away, but then came the Erle of Arundel fro~ the Quéen to ye Duke into his Chamber, who went out to méete him, as soone as he saw the Earle of Arundale, he fel on hys knées, desired hym to be good to him for the loue of God, co~sider (saith he) haue done nothing but by the co~sents of you and all the whole Councell: My Lorde (quoth the Earle of Arundale am sente hither by the Quéenes Maiestie, and in hir name doe arreast you, and obey it my Lorde (quoth he) beséeche you my Lorde of Arundale (quoth the Duke) vse mercy towardes mée, knowing the case as it is, my Lorde (quoth the Earle) yée shoulde haue sought for mercie sooner, muste doe accordyng to my commaundement, and therewith he committed the charge of him, and of other to the Guarde and Gentlemen that stoode by.
The xxv. of July, the Duke with other were brought vp to the Tower of London, vnder the conducte of Henry Earle of Arundale, and thus was the matter ended without bloudshed, whiche men feared woulde haue brought the death of many thousandes.

Wherevnto was aunsweared, that as co~ncerning the firste, the greate Seate, (whiche he layde for hys warrant)· was not the Séale of the lawful Quéene of the Realme) nor passed by aucthoritie, but the Seale of an Usurper, and therefore coulde be no warrant to hym.
As to the second, it was alleadged, that if anye were as déepely to bée touched in that case as hymselfe, yet so long as no atteynder were of recorde agaynste them, they were neuer the lesse persons able in Lawe to passe vppon anye tryall, and not to bée chalenged therefore, but at the Princes pleasure.
After whyche aunsweare, the Duke vsed fewe wordes, but confessed the inditement, by whose example· the other prisoners arraigned with him did the like, and therevppon had iudgement.
And when iudgement was gyuen· the Duke said, beséech you my Lords all to be humble futers to the Quéenes Maiestie, and to graunte mée foure requestes, whyche are these· that maye haue that death whyche Noble haue hadde in tymes paste, and not the other· Secondartly, that hir Maiestie will be gratious to my chyldren, whyche maye hereafter doe good seruice, consyderyng, that they wente by my commaundement, who am theyr father, and not of their own trée willes.
Thyrdlye, that maye haue appoynted to me some learned manne for the instruction and quiet of my conscience.
And fourthlye, that shée will sende twoo of the Councell, to commune wyth mée, to whome will declare suche matters as shall be expedient for hir, and the common weale: and thus beséech you al to pray for me.

And on the one and twentith of December, beganne throughout England the Church seruice to be done in Latine, as was enacted by the last Parliamente, and as the same had bin left in the last yeare of King Henry the eyght.
In the beginning of the moneth of January, the Emperour sent a noble man called Ecmondane, and certayne other Embassadors into England, to conclude a marriage betwéene King Phillip his sonne, and Quéene Mary of Englande.
The fourtéenth of January, D. Stephen Gardener Bishop of Winchester, Lord Chancellour of England, in the Chamber of presence at Westminster, made to the Lordes, Nobilitie, and Gentlemen, an Oration very eloquent, wherein hée declared that the Quéenes Maiestie, partly for amitie, and other waightie considerations had, after muche suite on the Emperours and Prince of Spaynes behalfe made, determined by the consent of the Counsell and Nobilitie, to match hir selfe with the sayde Prince in most godly and lawfull matrimonie, and declared further, that she should haue for hir ioynter thirtie thousand Duckets by the yeare, with all the lowe Countrey of Flanders, and that the issue (if there happened any) betwéene them two lawfully begotten, should bée heire as well to the Kingdome of Spayne, as also to the sayde lowe Countrey.
He sayde therefore that they were all bound to thanke GOD that so noble, worthy, and famous a Prince would vouchsafe so to humble hymselfe as in thys marriage to take vppon hym rather as a Subiect, than otherwise, for the Quéene and hir Counsell shoulde rule all thynges as dyd before, and that there shoulde bée of the Counsell no Stranger, neyther to haue the custodie of anye Fortes or Castels &c. nor beare anye rule or office in Quéenes house, or in all Englande, with other Articles there by hym rehearsed, wheree hée sayde the Quéenes pleasure and request was, at lyke good Subiectes for hir sake, they woulde most inglye receyue him with reuerence, ioy, and honoure.
The next day, the Lord Maior of London, with his bréethren the Alderme~, were sent for to the Court, and to bring with them fortie of the head commoners of the Citie, vnto whome before the Counsell, the Lord Chancellour made the like Oration, desiring them to behaue themselues like good subiects with all humblenesse and reioycing.
The purpose of this marriage was so gréeuously taken of diuers men, that for this and for Religion, they in such sort conspired against the Quéene, that if the matter had not broken out before the time by them appoynted; men thought it would haue brought much trouble and daunger.
The xxv. of January, Sir Iohn Gage, Lord Chamberlayne, certified the Lord Maior of London, that Sir Thomas Wyat with certayne other Rebels were vp in Kent aboute Maydestone, wherevpon, great watche was kepte, and that night the Lord Maior rode about to peruse the same, and euery night after two Aldermen did the like: in the day time the gates of the Citie were warded by substantiall Citize~s.
The xxvij. of January, the Lord Treasurer came to the Guild hall from the Counsell, to request the Citizens to prepare fiue hundred footemen well harnessed, to go agaynste Wyat, which was granted, and made ready the same night, and on the morrow were deliuered to their Captaines, and sent to Grauesend by water.
The xxix. of January, the Duke of Norffolke, with the Captayne of the Gard, and other souldiers, and the Captaine and Souldiers that were sent from London, minded to assault Rochester Castell, where Wyat and his people lay, but before the setting forward of these men, the Duke sent Mayster Nory an Herault vnto Rochester with the Quéenes Proclamation of pardon to all such as would desist from their purpose, who comming to the bridge, woulde haue gone through into the Citie, but they that kept the bridge would not suffer him till that the Captayne came, who at the last granted the same to be read the Citie, but holding a Dagge against him, cryed speak softly, or else they would shoote him thorough, so that they would not suffer the people to heare the Proclamation, which béeing ended, each man cryed they had done nothing wherefore they should néede any pardon, and in that quarrell which they had taken in hande, they would lyue and dye: neuerthelesse at the last Sir George Harpar receyued the pardon outwardly, and béeing receiued vnder the Duke of Norffolkes protection, came on forwarde againste the Kentishmen, and euen as the company were set in a readinesse, and marched forward toward the Bridge, Brette béeing Captayne of the fiue hundred Londoners, of which, the more parte were in the turned himselfe aboute, and drawing out his sword, sayd these or like words: Maysters, we go about to fight against our natiue Countreymen of England and our friends, in a quarrell vnrightfull, and partly wicked, for they considering the great and manyfolde miseries which are like to fall vpon vs, if we shall be vnder the rule of the proude Spanyards, are héere assembled to make resistance of their comming, for the auoyding of so great mischiefes and inconueniences likely to light, not only vpon themselues, but on euery of vs and the whole Realme, wherefore thinke no English heart ought to say against them, much lesse by fighting to withstande them, and therefore and others (meaning such as were in that ranke with hym) will spende our bloud in the quarrell of this worthy Captayne Mayster Wyat, and other Gentlemen héere assembled: which words once pronounced, each man turned their Ordinance agaynst their folowers, and therevpon cryed a Wyat a Wyat, of which sodeyne noyse, the Duke, the Captayne of the Gard, and other béeing abashed, fledde forthwith: immediatly came in Mayster Wyat and hys company on horssebacke, rushing in amongst as well the Garde as the Londoners, and sayde, so many as wyll come and tarrye wyth vs, shall be welcome, and so many as wyll departe, good leaue haue they, and so the Londoners, parte of the Gard, and more than thrée of the retinue, wente to the Campe of the Kentishmen, where they still remayned.
At this discomfiture, the Duke lost eyght péeces of brasse, with all other munition and Ordinance, and himselfe with few other hardly escaped.
The last of January, Wyat and his company came to Dertforde, and the next day they came full and whole to Greenewich and Depeford, where they remayned Thurseday, Fryday, and the foorenone of Satterday.
On the Fryday which was Candlemas day, the most parte of the housholders of London, with the Maior and Aldermen were in harnesse, yea this day and other dayes the Justices, Sergeants at the Lawe, and other Lawyers, pleaded in harnesse.
In this meane time, Henry Duke of Suffolke, Father to the Lady Iane, fléeing into Leycestershire and Warwikeshire with a small companye, in diuers places as he went made Proclamation agaynst the Quéenes marriage with the Prince of Spayne &c. but the people enclined not to him.
The first of February, Proclamation was made at London, that the Duke of Suffolke was discomfited, and fled with his two bréethren.
And also, that Sir Peter Carow, with his vnckle Sir Gawyn Carow and Gibbes, were fledde into France, and further, that the Quéene did pardon the whole Camp of the Kentishmen except Wyat, Harpar, Rudstone, and Iseley, and that who soeuer could take Sir Thomas Wyat, except the sayde foure persons, should haue an hundred pound Lands to hym and his heires for euer.
The same day in the afternoone being Candlemas euen, the commons of the Citie assembled in their Liueries at the Guild hall, whether the Quéene with hir Lords and Ladyes came riding from Westminster, and there after vehement wordes against Wyat, declared that she meant not otherwise to marrie, than the Counsell should thinke both honourable and commodious to the Realme, and that she could continue vnmaryed, as she had done the greatest part of hir age, and therefore willed them truly to assist hir in repressing such as contrarie to their duties rebelled.
When she had done, vnderstanding that many in London did fauour Wyats part, she appoynted Lord William Howard Lieutenant of the Citie, and the Earle of Pembroke General of the Field, which both prepared all thyngs necessarie for theyr purpose.
In the meane season, to wéete, the third day of February, about thrée of the clocke in the after noone, Sir Thomas Wyat and the Kentishmen marched forwarde from Depeford towards London with fiue Ancients, béeing by estimation about two thousand, which their comming so soone as it was perceyued, there was shot off out of the white Tower sixe or eyght shotte, but missed them, sometime shooting ouer, and sometime short.
After knowledge thereof once had in London, forth with the Draw Bridge was cut downe, and the Bridge Gates shutte.
The Maior and Sheriffes harnessed, commanded each man to shutte in their shoppes and windowes, and to be ready harnessed at their dores, what chance soeuer might happen.
By this time was Wyat entred into Kentstreete, and so by Saint Georges Churche into Southwarke.
Himselfe and part of hys company came in good aray downe Barmondsey streete, and they were suffered peaceably to enter Southwarke without repulse, or anye stroke stricken, eyther by the inhabitants, or of any other: yet was there many men of the Countrey in the Innes, reysed and brought thither by the Lorde William and other, to haue gone against the sayd Wyat, but they all ioyned themselues to the Kentishmen, and the inhabitantes with their best enterteyned them.
Immediatly vpon the sayde Wyats comming, hée made Proclamation that no Souldyour shoulde take anye thyng, but that hée shoulde pay for it, and that hys commyng was to resist the Spanish Kyng. &c.
At the Bridge foote he layde two péeces of Ordinance, and beganne a greate trenche betwéene the Bridge and hym.
Hée layde one other péece of Ordinance of Sainte Georges, and one going into Bermondsey streete, and one other toward the Bishop of Winchesters house.
On Shroue Tuesday the sixth of February, Sir Thomas Wyat remoued out of Southwarke, towarde Kingston Bridge, which was done vpon this occasion.
The nighte before hys departing out of Southwarke, by chance as one of the Lieutenants men of the Tower named Thomas Menchen rowed with a Sculler ouer against the Bishop of Winchesters place, there was a waterman of the Tower staire, desired the sayde Lieutenants man to take him in, who did so, which béeing espyed of Wyats men, seauen of them with Harguebusses, called to them to land agayne, but they would not, whereupon, each man discharged their péece, and killed the sayd waterman, which forthwith falling downe dead, the Sculler with much payne rowed through the Bridge to the Tower wharffe with the Lieutenants man, and the dead man in his boate, which thing was no sooner knowne to the Lieutenant, but that euen the same night, and the next morning, he bent seauen great péeces of Ordinance Euluerings, and full against the foote of the Bridge, and against Southwarke, and the two Stéeples of Saint Oliues, and Saint Mary Oueryes, besides all the péeces on the white Tower, one Culuering on Diueling Tower, and thrée Fauconets ouer the Water gate, which so soone as the inhabitants of Southwarke vnderstoode, certayne both men and women came to Wyat in most lamentable wise, saying, Sir, we are all like to be vtterly vndone and destroyed for your sake, oure houses shall by and by bée throwne downe vpon our heads, to the vtter spoyle of thys Borough, with the shotte of the Tower, all ready bente and charged towardes vs, for the loue of God therefore take pitie vppon vs: at whiche wordes hée béeyng partly abashed, stayde awhile, and then sayde: pray you my friendes bée contente a whyle, and will soone ease you of this mischiefe, for God forbid that you or the least héere should be killed or hurt in my behalfe.
As he marched towards Kingstone, he met by chance a Merchant named Christopher Dorell, whome he called, saying, Cosen Dorell pray you commend me vnto your Citizens the Londoners, and say vnto them from me, that when libertie and fréedome was offered them, they woulde not receyue it, neyther woulde they admitte me to enter within their Gates, who for theyr fréedome, and the disburthening of theyr gréefes, and oppression by Strangers, would haue franckely spente my blond in that their cause and quarrell, but nowe well appeareth theyr vnthankefulnesse to vs their friendes which meaneth them so much good, and therefore they are the lesse to bée moned héereafter, when the miserable tyrannie of Strangers shall oppresse them, and so hée wente forwarde.
This daye by nighte hée came to Kingstone, where the Bridge was broken, and kepte on the other syde by two hundreth men, wherefore Wyat caused a two péeces of Ordinance to be layde on the ende of the Bridge, whiche so feared them on the other syde, that they durst not abyde, then caused hée thrée or foure of hys Souldyers to leape into the Thamis, and to swimme to the other syde, who lewsed the Westerne Barges whyche there lay tyed, and so brought them ouer, and by that meanes he passed the water: it was woonderfull what paynes hée tooke himselfe comming on foote amongst them, neyther dyd they stay anye whitte all that nyghte, but came almost to Brayneforde or euer they were discryed by the Quéenes scoutes, who there by chaunce méeting Brette and hys companye, Brette sayde to the scoute, backe villayne, if thou goe farther to discouer any thing héere, thou shalte dye out of hande, the scoute returned in great hast.
The same day in the afternoone, were two men hanged on a Gibbet in Paules Church yard by Marciall law, the one being seruant to the Duke of Suffolke, and late Sheriffe of Leycester, the other a Baker, one of the white coates sent out of the Citie agaynste Wyat, and the same day came tidings that the Duke with his bréethren were taken.
The same day towards night, there was laden tenne or twelue Cartes with Ordina~ce, as Billes, Pikes, Speares, bowes, arrowes, powlder, shotte, shouels, mattockes, baskets, and other munitions, two one Sacre, thrée Fawcons, and a Fawconet, all which stuffe stayde in Paules Church yard.
The same night also aboute of the clocke, a Trompetter went about, and warned all horssemen and men of armes to be at Saint Iames field, and all footemen also to be there by sixe of the clocke in the next morning.
The Quéenes scoute vpon his returne to the Court, declared Wyats béeing at Brayneforde, whiche sodeyne newes, made all in the Courte wonderfullye afrayde, Drommes went through London at four of the clocke, commanding all Souldiours to armour, and so to Charing crosse.
Wyat hearing that the Earle of Pembroke was come into the fields, he stayde at Knightes bridge vntill day, where his men being very wéerie with trauell of that night, and the day before, and also partly féebled and faint, hauing receyued small sustenance since their comming out of Southwarke restlesse.
There was no small ado in London, and likewise the Tower made great preparation of defence.
By tenne of the cloke the Earle of Pembroke had set his troupe of horssemen on the hill in the high way aboue the newe bridge, ouer against Saint Iames: his footemen were set in two battels, somewhat lower, and néerer Charing Crosse, at the lane turning downe by the bricke wall from Islington ward, where he had set also certayne other horssemen, and he had planted his Ordinance vpon the hill side.
In the meane season, Wyat and his company planted his Ordinance vppon a hill beyond Saint Iames, almost ouer against the Parke corner, and himselfe after a few words spoken to his Souldyers, came downe the old lane on foote, hard by the Court gate at Saint Iames, with four or fiue auntients, his menne marching in good array.
Cuthbert Vaughan and a two antients turned downe towarde Westminster.
The Earle of Pembrokes horssemen houered all this whyle without mouing, vntill all was passed by sauing the tayle, vpon which they did set, and cut off: the other marched forward in array, and neuer stayd or returned to the ayde of theyr tayle: the greate Ordinance shotte off freshly on both sydes: Wyats Ordinance ouershotte the troupe of Horssemen.
The Quéenes Ordinance, one péece strake thrée of Wyats company in a rancke vpon the heads, and slaying them, strake through the wall into the Parke: more harme was not done by the greate shotte of neyther partie.
The Quéenes whole battayle of footemen standing still, Wyat passed along by the wall towardes Charing Crosse, where the sayde Horssemen that were there, set vppon parte of them, but was soone forced backe.
At Charing Crosse there stoode Sir Iohn Gage Lorde Chamberlayne wyth the Garde, and a number of other, béeing almost a thousande, the which vppon Wyats comming, shotte at hys companye, but at the last fledde to the Court gates, which certayne pursued, and forced wyth shotte to shutte the Court gates against them.
In thys repulse, the sayde Lorde Chamberlayne and others were so amazed, that manye cryed Treason in the Courte, and hadde thought that the Earle of Pembroke, who was assaulting the tayle of hys Enimies, hadde gone to Wyat, takyng hys parte agaynst the Quéene: there was running and trying out of Ladyes and Gentlewomen, shutting of dores and windowes, and suche a shriking and noyse, as was wonderfull to heare.
Wyat wyth hys menne marched still forwarde all along to Temple Barre, and so thorough Fleetestreete, tyll hée came to the Bell Sauadge, an Inne nigh vnto Ludgate, wythout resistance, hys menne goyng not in any good order or array.
It is sayde, that at Strand, certayne of the Lorde Treasurers hand, to the number of thrée hundreth men, whereof, the Lorde Chidioke Powlet his sonne was Captayne, met them, and so going on the one side, passed by them going on the other side, without any thing saying to them.
Also this is more strange, the sayde Wyat and hys company passed along by a greate companye of harnessed men whiche stoode on both sides the stréetes, without anye withstanding them.
And as he marched forward through Fléetestréete most with their swords drawne, some cryed Quéene Mary hath graunted oure request, and giuen vs pardon, other sayde, the Quéene hath pardoned vs, thus some of Wyats men came euen to Ludgate and knocked, calling to come in, saying there was Wyat, whome the Quéene had graunted to haue their requestes, but the Lorde William Howarde stoode at the Gate, and sayde auant Traytor, thou shalt not come in héere.
Wyat a while stayde, and rested hym vppon a stall ouer agaynste the Bell Sauadge Gate, and at the last séeing hée could not gette in to the Citie, and béeing deceyued of the ayde hée hoped for, returned backe agayne in array towards Charing Crosse, and was neuer stopped, till hée came at Temple barre, where certayne Horssemen which came from the fielde mette them in the face, and then beganne the fyghte agayne, tyll Clarensus an Herraulte came and sayde to Mayster Wyat, Sir, you were best by my counsell to yéelde, you sée thys daye is gone agaynste you, and in resisting, you can gette no good, but bée the death of all these your Souldioures, to youre great perill of Soule: perchance you maye fynde the Quéene mercifull, and the rather, if yée stint so greate bloudshead as is lyke héere to bée.
Wyat héerewyth béeyng somewhat astonyed (although hée sawe hys menne bente to fyghte) sayde well, if shall néedes yéelde, wyll yéelde me to a Gentleman, to whome, Sir Mawrice Barkeley came streight, and bade hym leape vp behynde hym, and another tooke Thomas Cobham and Wyllyam Kneuet, so carryed them behinde them vpo~ their horsses to the Courte then was taking of menne on all sides.
It is saide, that in thys conflicte one Pikeman setting his backe to the wall at Saint Iames, kepte seauentéene horssemen off hym a greate tyme, and at the laste was slaine.
The whole number on bothe sides slaine at thys battaile passed not fortie persons, as farre as coulde be learned by them that viewed the feld, but there were many sore hurte.
The noyse of women and children, when the conflicte was at Charing Crosse, was so greate, that it was hearde to the toppe of the white Tower, and also the great shotte was well discerned there out of Saint Iames fielde, there stoode vpon the Leades, the Marques of Northampton, sir Nicholas Poines, sir Thomas Pope, Maister Iohn Seimer and other.
About fiue of the clocke, Thomas Wiat, William Kneuet, Thomas Cobham, two brethren name Mantels, and Alexander Bret were broughte by sir Henrie Ierningham by water to the Tower prisoners, where sir Philip Deny receyued them at the Bulwarke, and as Wiat passed by he saide, goe Traitor, there was neuer suche a Traytor in Englande, to whome sir Thomas Wiat turned and saide, am no Traitor, woulde thou shouldest well knowe, thou arte more Traitor than I, it is not the point of an honeste man to call me so, and so went forth, when he came to the Tower Gate, sir Thomas Bridges Lieuetenant tooke in through the Wicket, firste Mantele, and saide: Ah thou Traitour, what hast thou and thy companye wrought? but he holding down hys head saide nothing: Then came Thomas Kneuet, whome Maister Chamberlaine Gentleman Porter of the Tower tooke in: Then came Alexander Bret, whome sir Thomas Pope tooke by the bosome saying: oh Traitoure, howe couldest thou finde in thy hearte to worke suche a villany, as to take wages, and being trusted ouer a bande of men, to fall to hir enimyes, returning againste hir in battell: Bret answered yea, haue offended in that case: Then came Thomas Cobham, whome sir Thomas Poines tooke in, and said, alas Master Cobham, what wind headed you to worke such treason, and he aunswered, oh sir was seduced.

Castell in forme as followeth: Sir William Kirkandie, sometime of Graunge Knighte, for as much as the Quéenes Maiestie my soueraigne Lady, vpon the earnest request of hir deare coosin y^
King of Sots, your soueraign Lorde, made to hir highnesse by his regent nobilitie, and states of this realme, after al good meanes vsed to haue reduced you to dutifull obedience of his authority by treatie, which hither to you haue not duely hearkened vnto, to the only hinderaunce of the vniuersall peace in this realme, by withholding that his highnesse Castle, meaning as it séemeth, to reserue the same for a receptacle of forraine forces, to the manifest daungers both of this realme, and of my soueraignesse, and therefore necessarie to remoue so perilous a daunger to both the realmes, for which consideration hir Maiestie hath sente hir ayde and succours of men, ordinaunce and munition, vnder my charge and leading, for the repugnation and recouerie of the sayde Castel, to the saide Kings vse and behalfe, and therefore according to hyr Maiesties commandement and commission, this shal be in due manner to warne, require and summon you, that you render and deliuer the saide Cascell, with the whole ordinaunce, artillerie, munitions, Jewels, housholde stuffe and such other implements within the same, to me and the vse and behalfe of the King your soueraigne, and his regent in his name, immediately after this my letter of Summons, or knowledge of the same, shall come to you, which if you obey, as of duetie you oughte, then shall in hir Maiesties name enterpone my selfe to trauaile with the regent, counsel, and nobilitie here, for ye safetie of your liues &c. Otherwise if you continue in your former obstinacie, abyding the Canon, then no further to looke for grace or fauour, but you and the rest within that Castell to be pursued to the vttermost, and holden as enemies to hir maiestie, your owne soueraigne Countrey· Giuen at Edenburgh by me sir Willia~ Drurie Knighte, generall of hir Maiesties forces nowe in Scotland, this xxv. of April.
The Lord Grange Captain of ye Castell, notwithsta~ding this somona~ce, refused vtterly to yéeld y^
Castel, who thervpo~ receiued such answere fro~ ye general, as stoode not to his contentation.
Herevpon were the Pioners set in hand to caste trenches, and to raise mounts in places conuenient, to pla~t the ordinaunce vppon.
And then began the siege of the Castell in fiue places, where were erected
The first was for the regent called the King mount.
The fifth by Maister Thomas Sutton Maister of the ordinance in the Northe parte of Englande.
Englishmen· and of Scottes fiue hundred, there was also one with another péeces of Artillery
They within spared not to bestow such as they had, as wel at ye pioners as souldiours, in so much ye diuerse were hurt, and some before the trenches and mountes might be brought to perfection, but they within escaped not frée, especially after that the trenches and mountes were brought in state to defende the assaylants, who watching and warding in the trenches, answered them within the Castell very roughly.
On the xvij. of May, began the battery of the Castell, so that there were xxx.
Canons shotte off against the same, and so well bestowed at Dauids Tower, that by the ruines therof then and after, the force of the English Canons were easte to be séene.
The xviij. xix. and xx. of May, the Canons and Demy Canons were not ydle, but the xxj. the whole battery began on each side the Castell, from the trenches and mounts very hotly, and still they within ceased not to make answer againe with their artillery, killing and hurting diuers both English and Scottes, but such was the diligence of the English Gunners, that they displaced the Ordinance in the Castell, and stroke one of their chiefe Canons iust in the mouth, whereby the same was broken in péeces.
The xxvj. of May, the assault was giuen at scauen of the clocke in the morning to the Spurre, which by the hardy manhoode of the assaylants was wonne, and was no sooner entred by the Englishmen, but that the Generals Ensigne was shewed, and spread vpon the front and toppe thereof, to the great discomfort of them within the Castell.
In the meane time, whilest these were appoynted to giue the assault thus to the Spurre, there were certayne Englishmen and Scottes commaunded to make a countenance of an assault at the West side of the Castell, whereby those that assaulted the Spurre, might the more easily obteyne their purpose, but they rashly aduenturing farther than they had in commandement, were beaten backe and repulsed, with xxviij. or xxx. of their company slayne and hurt.

Causes of deliuerie of the Castell were these: Lacke of water: the well within the Castel was stopped and defiled by the ruines of the Castell: the other well without the Castell could not serue them, for that there was a mount made to hinder them.
Another water there was which was vnknowne to them which were without, and was taken from them when the Spurre of the Castell was taken, out of the which they were wont to haue a pint a day for euery Souldiour.

Now by the grace of God, and through conference wyth good and learned Ministers of Christ his Church, do vnderstand and acknowledge the same to be most damnable, and detestable heresies, and do aske God, héere before hys Church, mercy for my sayd former errours, and do forsake them, recant and renounce them, and abiure them from the bottom of my heart, professing that certaynely beléeue That Christ tooke flesh of the substance of the blessed virgine Mary.
That a Christian man may be a Magistrate, or beare the sword and office of aucthoritie.
That it is lawfull for a Christian to take an othe.
And further confesse, that the whole Doctrine and Religion established and published in this Realme of England, as also that which is receyued and preached in the Dutch Church héere in this Citie, is sound, true, according to the word of God, wherevnto in all things submit my selfe, and will most gladly be a member of the said Dutch church, from henceforth vtterly abandoning and forsaking all and euerye Anabaptisticall errour.
This is my faith nowe in the whiche do purpose and trust to stand firme, and stedfast vnto the end, that may so doe, beséech you all to pray with me and for me, to God the heauenlye father in the name of his sonne our sauiour Jesus Christ.

The seauentéenth day of July, the Quéenes moste excellent Maiestie, being on y^ riuer of Thamis, betwixt hir Highnesse Mannour of Greenewiche and Detteforde, in hir priuie Barge, accompanyed with Mounsier Schemere the French Embassadour, the Earle of Lincolne, and Maister Uizchamberlaine, &c. with whom she entred discourse about waightie affaires: it chanced, that one Thomas Appletree a yong man and seruant to Maister Henrie Carie, with two or thrée children of hir Maiesties Chappell, and one other named Barnard Acton, being in a Boate on the Thamis, rowing vp and downe betwixte the places afore named, the foresaide Thomas Appletree hadde a or Harquebuze, whych he hadde thrée or foure times discharged with Bullet, shooting at randone very rashly, who by greate misfortune shot one of the Watermen, being the seconde man nexte vnto the Bales of the saide Barge, labouring with hys Oare, (whyche sate wythin sixe foote of hir Highnesse) cleane throughe bothe hys armes: the blows was so greate and gréenous, that it moued him out of his place, and forced hym to crye and oute piteouslye, supposing hymselfe to be slaine, and saying, he was shot thorough the body.
Daggers thrust into him, the Quéenes Maiestie shewed such noble courage as is moste wonderfull to be heard and spoken of, for beholding him so maimed, and bléeding in suche sorte, she neuer bashed thereat, but shewed effectually a prudent and magnanimous heart, and moste curteouslye comforting the pore man, she had him be of good chéere, and saide, he shoulde want nothing that mighte be for hys ease, commaunding him to be couered till suche time as he came to the shoare, till whyche time he laye bathing in his owne bloude, whiche might haue bin an occasion to haue terrified the eyes of the beholders.
But suche, and so greate was the courage and magnanimitie of oure dread and soueraigne Ladye, that it neuer quayled.
To be short, Thomas Appletree and the rest were apprehended and broughte before hir honorable Counsel, who with great grauitie and wisedome employed their times very carefully, and with greate diligence examined the saide Appletree and his companions, and finding the case moste hainous and wicked, iustlye pronounced againste hym the sentence of Death, and commit him to the Marshalsea in Southwarke, from whence the Tuisday following he was brought throughe the Citie with the Knight Marshalles men, ledde vp to the Tower Hill, and so to Radcliffe vppe to Blacke wall, and so downe to the water side, where was a Gibet: set vppe, directly placed béetwixte Dertforde and Greenewiche, for the execution of this male factour, who in déede very pitifully bewayled the offence hée had committed, and as well in prison as by the way prepared himselfe very penitently and willingly to offer his body to the death.
Thus verye godlye he purposed to finishe his miserable and wretched life, and so prepared himself to ascend and goe vppe the Ladder, and being on the same, he turned himselfe, and spake to the people as followeth: Good people, am come hither to die, but God is my iudge, neuer in my life intended hurte to the Quéenes most excellent Maiestie, nor meant the harme of anye creature, but praye to God with all my heart, long to prosper and kéepe hir Highnesse in health, who blesse and defende hir from all perilles and daungers, who prosper hir in all hir affaires, and blesse hir moste Honorable Counsell, gyuing them grace to doe all things to the glory of God, and the benefite of thys realme: But of all things, am moste sorie for my offence, and wofully bewaile the same: and more, am penitent and sorie for my good Maister, Maister Henrie Carie, who hathe béene so gréeued for my fault, suffering rebuke for the same: woulde to god had neuer bin borne that haue so gréeuouslye offended him.
And wyth that the teares gusht oute of his eyes verye faste.
This saide, he perswaded all men to serue God, and to take an example by hym, and euerye night and morning moued them deuoutly to say the Lords prayer.
And as the executioner had put the roape about his necke, the people cryed, stay, stay, stay, and with that came the righte Honorable sir Christopher Hatton Uizchamberlaine to hir highnesse, who enquired what he had confessed, and being certified, as is before expressed, he vayled his bonet, and declared, that the Quéenes Maiestie had sente him thither bothe to make the cause open to them how haynous and gréeuous the offence of the said Thomas Appletree was, and further to signifie to him hir gratious pleasure: and so continued his message, as ye may reade it printed by it self, and annexed to this discourse.
Whyche, when he had declared, the Hangman was commanded to take the roape from his necke.
Appletree being come downe from the Ladder, receiued his pardon, and gaue God and the Prince praise, for so greate a benefite as he had by hir most gratious bountie receiued.
This done, Maister Uizchamberlaine said: Good people pray for the Quéenes Maiestie, and then was this prayer saide, whyche is vsually read (for the preseruation of hir Maiestie) in the Church: Almightie and euerliuing God, the Lord of Lordes, and King of Kings, whyche doest from thy throne beholde all the dwellers of the earth, moste hartily we beseeche thee with thy fauour to beholde our moste gratious Soueraigne Lady Queene Elizabeth, &c. Wherevnto all the people ioyfully accorded to saye, Amen, trying.
Thus was the dead man restored to life, and broughte backe to the Marshalsea againe, euen as he was led thence to the place of execution, where he by the way moste ioyfullye prayed for the securitie of the Quéenes Maiestie.
The mercifull message of the Quenes Maiestie, sent by the right Honorable Sir Christopher Hatton, to the place where Thomas Appletree shoulde haue suffered for hys action, set downe worde for worde so neare as coulde be gathered.
MAi&ster Carie, hir moste excellent Maiestie is pleased to send me to deliuer hir commandment to you touching this man nowe héere presently to dye.
And first, thinke it not oute of purpose to notifie his offence to these good people, whereby he is not onely worthy this punishment: but in iudgement of forraine nations, and by censure of forraine lawes, should be delyuered to the tormentors, to endure suche torture, as the qualitie of hys offence in so high a case by good pollieie shoulde condignely deserue.
And to speake of this facte, suche it was, and so fearefull, as my heart quaketh, and my eyes can not refraine teares, to repeate it againe amongest you.
(God for hys mercies sake shielde and defende hir moste excellent Maiestie, that moste mightily hathe digested the notable daunger.)
And so will tel you of this tragedie in course as it fell out.
It liked hir Highnesse, in respecte of the greate heate, to take the ayre of the water, where in graue and waightie negotiation, she passed the time in discourse with the French Embassador by y^ space of an houre or two.
In hir returne it pleased hir to take dyuers pauses, and the rather, bicause she earnestly read a Booke, wherein it séemed for recreations sake she tooke some delight.
By meanes whereof, (euen as it pleased God wth his holy hande, as it were, to directe hir safetie) she commaunded the Bargemen to slacke their labour, and slowly to passe on, where, if they hadde hasted but two strokes more, they had brought hir Royal person to the shotte it selfe.
These wordes were scarcely spoken out by hir Maiestie, but this Caitiue moste vnhappily (I muste saye moste diuelishly) discharged his Arquebuze, stro~gly charged with Bullet, into the Barge where hir Maiestie was.
(God that hath defended hir, thou most mightie God euer vouchsafe to kéep hir.)
With this blowe the seconde man to the bayles of the Barge, wythin sixe foote of hir Royall person, was stricken down from his seate, and wou~ded through both his armes, whiche hir Maiestie beheld, and kingly handled this cause, as euen straight will tell you.
My Lordes of hir Maiesties Counsel dispersed abroade in their affaires, hearing of this moste perilous aceidente, returned to Courte, wyth suche spéede, as the waight of such a cause might moue them to do, and there with feareful and louyng applausure towarde hir Maiestie, did moste holily thanke our God for his singular help in the preseruation of oure moste deare and righteous Soueraigne.
That done according, with their loues, and dueties of seruice to God, hir Maiestie, and this whole estate: after deliberate and moste graue consultation of the cause, they al moste humbly on their knées besoughte the Quéene, that this slaue mighte suffer, not this death, but tenne thousande deaths, (if so it were possible in nature to doe) for his so rash and fearefull offence.
Suche, in déede, mighte the offence haue bin, whiche God for his mercies sake hathe moste fauourably forbidden, that it mighte hane rought vp to Heauen, and shoulde moste miserably not onely haue plagued this hir owne lande, but all the true seruants of God dyspersed through Christendome: our Religion, and true faith in Jesus Christe, whyche wée enioye wyth vnspeakable comforte of frée conscience, mighte hereby haue suffred confusion, and persecution of bloude, and vengeance amongst vs. Our peace, and secure estates, encreased with excéeding wealthes, and nourished with most swéete quietnesse of life by thys hir moste happy gouernement, and raygne of twentie yeares, might hereby haue bin turned to blouty warres, the fruites whereof is burning and spoyling of houses and goods, rauishing and destroying of wiues and chyldren.
And what vengeance soeuer the worlde can bring forth, the same shoulde haue fallen on vs, saye on vs, then the most miserable men in the worlde.
And therefore heare me praye you· Let vs acknowledge before God wyth all humble thankefulnesse these vnspeakable benefites, whych we haue enioyed, and still shall doe, while God vpholdeth hir blessed life and state amongest vs: The losse and lacke of whome, can not but bring on vs all these calamities, and ten thousande moe; whyche cannot foresée.
If then by these, and al other benefites, whyche you possesse, féele, and taste of, you finde how inestimable and pretious a Jewell thys our déere Soueraigne is for vs, and amongest vs, what plague, forment, or punishment, could suffise you for reuenge on him, that by anye meanes shoulde depriue you of suche heauenly and worldly felicities, as dayly by hir holy hande are ministred amongest you? But will meddle no further wyth these matters.
knowe you thanke God for them, and wyth true and faithfull obedient heartes, wyll euer serue hir moste excellent Maiestie, whome he hathe made hys Minister to distribute al these blessyngs into your bosomes.
And now, if it please you, you may wyth maruell heare the Message come of.
bryng mercie to thys manne, the gratious pardon of oure most deare Soneraigne, who with hir mercifull eye, beholdyng the clearenesse of this mannes heart, frée from euill thought, and consequentlye from prepension of any malicious fact against hir persto~, vouchsaseth to put him from the
notable action of compassion procéeding from a heauenlye minde, and so farre different from the common nature of man, forced into a fearefull iealousie of lisse of life, as hath neuer bene read nor hearde of.
If casually a man suffer hurte in the fields by an arrowe shot by chance at rouing markes, how reuengefully y^ party offended will follow his processe of felonie, haue oft séene, and the law doth well allow it.
If in the Court the meanest man strike his felow with his fist so that he bléede, he is to loose the same hande.
Many other examples may be giuen you, both touching the casualitie in this mans fact, touching the place, and presence, wherein it chaunced to bée done.
But our Quéene looketh neyther on hir prerogatiue, on power of hir lawes, nor on the perill of hir person, but with the nobilitie of hir hearte, the daunger onely done to hir self, doth as you heare, fréely pardon it.
And in the sacred word of hir kingly estate protest it vnto you, she hath firmly auowed that she had rather haue suffered, the wou~ds the Bargeman now hath, ten folde, than the meanest of vs all, or of any subiectes, should suffer the slaunder of so tyranous or trayterous a fact, yea· or of the prepension, or forethought of so horrible a treason toward hit, thoughe it were in facte neuer executed.
Wherein to all our singular comfortes, it pleased hir wt moste princely affection and earnestnesse, graciouslye to affirme, that neuer Prince had better, nor more kinde true subieas.
God for his mercie direct vs euer to be so, with our due gratefulnesse to sacrifice at hir kinglye féete oure bloude and liues for hir seruice sake, when occasion shal cal vs thereto.
One other thing finde hir Maiestie troubled with, y^ is, the sorrow this noble yong Gentleman, M. Henrie Carie hath suffered in continuall grieft of his hart for the offence of his man, who through the vaine iealousie of some euill disposed persons, hath likewise borne some slaunder of the cause.
But it suffiseth to cleare him, that no intente of malice, nor forethought of this fact· is found in the partie himselfe.
His conuersation besides with excéeding faith and diligence in hir highnesse seruice, will euer deliuer him, as a most acceptable Gentleman frée from this and al other euil in the sight of hir Maiestie and all the worlde.
shall not néede therefore to speake of him, for hys cause néedeth none excuse.
Here may you behold the rare goodnesse of our great and gracious Mistresse, full of religion and pietie, Justice and mercie, Temperance and magnanimitie (and that cannot but tell you) of the most constant and noble courage that euer liued: the proofe wherof (the cause heard, whereat was present) leaue to your iudgements.
Hir Maiestie taking prospecte out of the vales of hyr Barge, at the very instant did sée the man stricken, and behelde his fall, and hearde as it were, his deadly who~ she immediately commaunded to be taken vp, and then beholding him all embrued with bloude, commaunded hys woundes to be lapped vp with a scarffe of hir owne, and so with hir most constante and amiable countenaunce, continued hir entertaynement of the Ambassadoure, as thoughe there had bene no such matter.
Afterwardes the man began to fainte, hir highnesse then commaunded a cloke to be put on his bodye, with other suche necessarie reliefes as~ were there presentlye to be hadde, without alteration of countenaunce.
Beholde this kinglye hearte, and courage of magnanimitie, séeing, as it were, the presente death of the next to hir, neyther feared hir owne life, nor was dismayed with this treasonable chaunce.
Hereof howe muche wée maye reioyce, want witte to tell you.
But in one worde, hir highnesse, that with hir singular wisedome and policie hath preserued hir Empire these twentie yeares in moste ioyfull peace, wyth thys courage magnanimitie will (no doubt) as mightily defende vs in the moste cruell wars.
God therefore euer blesse hir, and let vs with oure handes stretched vp to Heauen, and oure eyes fixed on the seate of God, praye for hir long life, and moste prosperous raigne ouer vs. Thomas Appletree· receiue thy life from hir most excellent Maiestie, and pray to God on thy knées for hir all thy dayes to come.
And so the people being moued to prayer for hir Maiesties moste happy escape, and for the blessing of God to lengthen hir dayes for many any many yeares, he fell on hys knées with great deuotion amongest them, and so departed with excéeding ioy to the people, and a thousand blessings on him selfe.
Shippe called the thrée halfe Moones, manned with xxxviij. men, and well fenced with munitions, sette from Portesmouth, towarde Ciuill a Citie in Spaine, but falling into the streightes, were taken by the Turkes, putte in their Galleys, their clothes torne from their backes, and then set to the Ores· where their fare was scant of bread, vnholesome water, and plentie of stripes.
Nigh to the Citie of being a Hauen Towne, vnder the dominion of the Turkes, there is a Roe very fencible, where into the Turkes doe customably bring their Galleis on shoare euery yere in the Winter, and there do trimme them against the Spring time.
In whyche roade there is a prison, wherein the Captiues and suche prisoners as serue in the Galleis are putte for all that time, vntill the Seas be calme and passable for the Galleis, euery prisoner laden with yrons on their legs.
Into whiche prison these Christians were putte, and faste warded all the Winter season, but ere it was long, the Maister and the owner, by meanes offriendes were redéemed: the reste abyding whyle they were all throughe their yll vsage and worse fare: myserablye starued, sauing one Iohn Fox, who being somewhat skilfull in the Crafte of a Barber, by reason thereof made great shift in helping his fare now and then with a good meale, till at the last God sente him fauour in the sight of the kéeper of the prison, so that he had leaue to go in and out to the Roade at his pleasure, paying a tertayne stipend vnto the kéeper, and wearing a locke about his legge, which libertie likewise sixe more had vpon like sufferance, who, not being suspected to start aside, had libertie to go in and out at the sayd Roade, and to returne agayne at night.
in the Winter season, the Galleis comming to their accustomed harborough, and being discharged of all their Mastes, Sayles, and other such furnitures, and all the maysters and marriners of them being lodged in their owne homes, there remayned in the prison of the sayd Roade
Christian prisoners, who had bin taken by the Turkes force, and were of sixtéene sundry Nations, among the which, there were thrée Englishmen, whereof, one was named Iohn Fox of Wodbridge, another William Wickney of Portesmouth, and the third Robert Moore of Harwich, which Iohn Foxe hauing bin thirtéene or fourtéene yeares vnder their gentle intreatance, minding his escape, tooke good heart vnto him.
Not farre from the Roade, at one side of the Citie, ther was a certain victualling house which one Peter Vnticaro a Spanyard had hired, this Peter had bene prisoner aboue
yeres, neuer practised any means to escape, but kepte himselfe quiet, vntill now that this Iohn Fox vsing much thether, brake one to another their minds concerning the restreynt of their libertie, so that this Iohn Fox opening vnto this Vnticaro the deuice which he minded to practise, made priuie one more to their intent, which thrée debated of this matter at suche time as they coulde méete togither, in so much, that at seauen wéekes ende they had concluded how the matter should be done, who making fiue more priuie to their deuise, determined in thrée nightes after to accomplish their purpose, wherevpon the same Iohn Fox, and Peter Vnticaro, and the other sixe, appoynted to met altogither in the prison the laste day of Dece~ber, where this I. Fox certified the rest of the prisoners of their intent, deliuered vnto them a sort of files, whiche he had gathered for that purpose, charging them to be readie discharged of their prons by eight of the clocke on the next day at nighte.
On the next day at night this Fox his other sixe companions came al to the house of Peter Vnticaro, and when it was time to put in practise their deuice, sent the sayd Peter to the Maister of the Roade· in the name of one of the maisters of ye Citie, who desired him to méete him there, promising him, that he could bring him backe againe, wherevppon the kéeper agréed to go with him, willing the warders not to bar the gate, saying he would turne agayne with all spéede.
In the meane season the other seue~ had prouided them of suche weapons as they could.
The kéeper nowe being come vnto the house, and perceyuing no light, nor hearing any noyse, suspected the matter and returned backwarde, but Fox sta~ding behind a corner of the house, stepped forth to him: who perceyuing it to be I. Fox (sayde Fox what haue deserued of thée, that thou shouldest séeke my death? thou villaine (quoth Fox) hast bin a succour of many Christians bloude, and therewith he lift vp his sword and stroke him so mayne a blowe, as therewithall he claue his heade, so that he fell deade to the grounde: then Peter and the rest came forth, and went toward the roade, wherinto they entred softly: where were sixe whom one of them asked, who was ther, quoth.
Fox and his company all friendes, which when they were wythin, fel on the sixe men and dispatched the~ quickly.
They Fox barred the gate, and planted a Canon against it, and entring into the Gaylers lodge, they founde the Keyes of the prison by his beds side, and there they had better wepons than before.
In this Chamber was a Chest, wherein was muche treasure all in Duckets, whiche Peter and two more opening, stuffed themselues so full as they coulde, betwéene their shirts and theyr skinne, which Fox would not touche, but said he sought for his and their libertie, and not for mony.
Now these eight being armed wt such weapons as they liked, comming to the prison, Fox opened the gates dores called forth all the prisoners, whom he set, some to ramming vp the gate, some to the dressing vp of a Galley, the best in the roade, called the Captain of Alexandria· wher into some carried mastes, Sayles, Ores other furniture.
At the prison were certaine warders, who~ Fox and his co~pany slew, in the killing of whom, there were eight Turkes, which got the~ to the top of the prison, vnto whom Fox his company were fain to ascende by ladders, where they found a hote skirmishe, for some of them were slayn some wou~ded: Peter Vnticaro the other two that had armed the~ with the Duckets were slaine, as not able to welde themselues, being pestered with the weight of the treasure.
Amongst the Turkes was one thrust through, who fell of from the top of ye prison wall, made such a noyse, yt the inhabitantes there about, came and dawed him, so yt they vnderstood y^ case, how the prisoners were occupied, wherewith they raysed bothe Alexandrîa, whiche laye on the West side of the roade, and a Castle whiche was at the Cities ende nexte the roade, also one other fortresse whiche laye on the North side, so y^ now they had no way to escape but one· which by mans reson might séeme impossible to be a way for them.
But to bée short, the said Galley being trimmed vp, whereinto euerye man leaped, they hoyste vp sayles yéelde themselues to ye mercie of God, in whose hande is both wind and weather: now being on flote and out of y^ safetie of y^ roade, the two Castels haue ful power vpon the same, but suche was the worke of God for their deliueraunce, y^ no one of them was touched we xlv. shot which came thu~dring about their ears, thus sayling are soone out of the Canons reach, the Turkes hauing no Gallyes trimmed to make after them.
Whe~ the Christians were safe out of the enemies coast, Iohn Fox willed them all to be thankefull vnto almightie God for theyr deliuerie, and most humblye to fall vppon their knées, him to ayde them vnto their friendes lande, &c.
After which prayers made to God, they felt to labour with the oare, striuing to come to some Christian land, but the winds were diuers· and victuals fayled them, so that eyght of them dyed by famin, to the astonishment of all the rest: but it fell out that vpon the xxix. day after they set from they fell on the of Canadie, and landed at Gallipoly, where they were well cherished by the Abbot and Monkes there, who caused them to stay while they were well refreshed and eased.
When they thought good, hauing leaue to depart from thence, they sayled along the coast till they arriued at Tanento, where they sold their Galley, and deuided the price, man hauing a part thereof.
The Turkes pursued the Christians, and scoured the Seas where they could imagin that they bent their course, and the Christians had departed from thence on the one day in the morning, whe~ seauen Galleis of the Turkes came thither that night, as it was certified by those who Fox and his company fearing least they shoulde haue bin met wyth.
And then they came a foote to Naples, wher they departed asunder, euery man taking him to his next way home, from whence Fox toke his iourney vnto Rome, where he was wel entertayned of an Englisheman, who presented his worthy déed to the Pope who rewarded him liberally, and gaue him letters to the King of Spaine, where he was well entertayned of him, who for his worthy enterprise, gaue hym in fée twentie pence a daye: from whence being desirous to come into his owne Countrey, he came thyther at such time as he conueniently could whiche was in the yeare of our Lorde.
and being come into England, went vnto the Courte, shewed all his trauaile vnto the Counsell: who considering that he had spent a great part of his youth in shraldome and bondage, to him their liberalitie to maintayn hym in hys age, to their great honors, and encouragement of all true harted Christians.

The great clocke bell in the Palaice at Westminster stroke of it selfe againste the hammer wyth shaking, as diuerse clockes and Bels in the Citie and elsewhere did the like the Gentlemen of the Temple being at Supper, ranne from the Tables and out of theyr Hal with theyr kniues in their handes, a péece of the Temple Church fell downe, some stones fell from Pauls Churche.
And at Christes Churche in the Sermon while a stone fell from the toppe of the Church whiche killed out of hand one Thomas Grey an Apprentice, an other stone also brused his felowe seruaunte named Mabel Eueret, so that she liued but foure dayes after: diuerse other were sore hurt with running out of the Church: diuerse chimneyes in the Citie part of them fell downe the houses were so shaken.
This Earthquake continued in or about London not passing one minute of an houre, and was no more felt: but Eastwarde in Kent and on the sea coast it was felt thrée times.
As at Sandwich at sixe of the clocke, the land not only quaked, but the sea so foamed, that the shippes tottered.
At Douer also at the same houre was the like, so that a péece of the Cliffe fel into the sea with also a péece of the Castle wall there.
péece of Saltwood Castle in Kent fell downe, and in the Church of Hide the Bels were harde to sounde.
péece of Sutton Churche in Kent fell downe, the Earthquake being there bothe and felte.

Northeast, a very great mistor fog, muche like vnto the sea: and the forme of a cloude in the fashio~ of some gret Castel, with flags, streames thereon, as it were standing in the Sea, whiche presentlye vanished awaye.
In whose stéede, and in néere the same place, appeared another cloud which altered into the likenesse of a great Argosie, furnished with Mastes, and other necessaries, hir sayles séeming ful of winde, made hir way on the Southweast of the Castel, hauing streamers and flags very warlike, with two boates at either sterne.
There incontinent appeared againe the forme of a Castel, and behinde the same came folowing on the Southweast side, another greate Argosie, furnished as the firste.
This being past, there appeared thrée or foure Galeis with their Mastes and flags in warlike sort, hauing boates at their sternes, and thereby appeared other small clouds to the number of xij. which altered into the proportion of the sayde Castels, and one following another, as soone as any of them vanished other came in their roomes, thys continued the space of an houre.
Shortly after the sightes in ye ayre aforesayde a worthy Gentleman in the Countrey writ to a right good gentleman in ye Court, y^ there was séen vpon a downe called Brodwels Downe, in Somersetshire, lx. personages all clothed in blacke, a furlong in distance fro~ those ye beheld them, after their appearing, and a little while tarying, they vanished away, but immediately, another stra~ge company in like maner colour and number appeared in the selfe same place, and they encountred one another, and so vanished away.
And the thirde time, appeared that number againe all in bright armour and encountred one another.
so vanished away: iiij. honest me~ which saw it, reporting ye same abrode, wer examined therof, before sir George Norto~, to whom they that those things they had séene were true, as here before is rehersed: Moreouer it is credibly told of many honest men, that fiue miles from Blonsdon in Wiltshire, a crie of houndes was hearde in the ayre, the selfe same day that the ste Earthquake was, and the noyse was so great that was de, that they séemed three or foure score couple, where ke the

The xiij. of June about sixe of the clocke in the mornyng at Shipwesh, within Bothel Barony in Northumberland, there happened a tempest of lightning thunder, after the which, of a sodayne came a great shoure of hayle stones, amongst ye which wer stones of diuers shapes, maruellous to behold.

Whiche Monster brought into the world no other newes, but an admiration of the deuine workes of God.

N. &c.
And considering also it is founde, that these sectaries hold opinion, that they maye before any Magistrate ecclesiastical or Temporall, or any other person not being professed to be of their sect, by othe or otherwise denye any thing for their adua~tage, so as though many of the~ are wel knowen to be teachers spreaders abroade of these da~gerous and damnable sects, yet by their own co~fession they cannot be condemned.
Therfore hir Maiestie being very sorie to sée so greate an euill by malice of the Diuell, to be brought into this hir realme, by hir Bishops and ordinaries, she vnderstandeth it very requisite, not onely to haue these da~gerous Heretickes sectaries to be seuerely punished, but that also all other meanes be vsed by hir Maiesties royall authoritie, which is giue~ hir of God to defe~d Christs Church, to roote the~ out from further infecting of hir realm, she hath thought méete and conueniente, and so by hir proclamation, commaundeth that all hir officers and ministers Temporall, shall in all their seuerall vocations, assist the Bishops of hir Realme, and all other persons ecclesiastical, to searche out all persons duely suspected to be eyther teachers, or professors of the foresayde damnable sectes, and by all good meanes to procéede senerelye againste them, beyng found culpable, by order of the lawes eyther ecclesiastical or Temporall, and that also searche be made in all places suspected, for the bookes and writings mayntayning the sayds Heresies and sectes, and them to distroye and bu~rne, &c. as more at large appeareth by the sayd proclamation, giuen at Richmond the third of October, and proclaymed at London on the nintéenth of October.

an alarum to the counties of england and wales
with the oath of abjuration for ever abjur'd
our nation which long since hath lost the lustre and now at last strugleth for the life and being thereof
our many temporal miseries are reducible to two principal heads

daily


decrease of trading

increase of taxes so that every hour the burden groweth weightier and the back of our nation weaker to support it


tis sad to see in cloathing countreys what swarms there are of poor people the true objects of charity if any were as able to give as they worthy to receive reliefe for they would worke and can worke yet cannot worke because there are none to imploy them

as for the sea which is the land of it returneth small benefit for since dunkirk was ours more to the credit than profit of our nation the fire of is removed out of the chimney and scattered about the house not lesse destructive but more diffusive so that our merchants could better guard themselves against that single staple of pirates than many lesser ones sprung since every where the cause why rich men will not as poor cannot adventure

our second misery is increase yea superfetation of taxes so long as so numerous an army is maintained for though some of their soldiers will preach gratis conscientious to tahe nothing for that which they know is worth nothing yet none will fight at so cheap a rate


some will say that what the soldier receiveth with one hand he returneth with another expending his pay in victuals cloathes whereby coin by circulation is continued in our countrey
this deny for some grandees greatned by the times have made their moneyes over in banks beyond the seas which are put into mortmain or a dead hand whereby no profit accreweth to our commonwealth
others having gotten the estates of lords live after the rate of yeomen whose discretion therein is to be commended for proportioning their expences for fear of afterclaps rather according to their original than present condition


the increase of taxes must inevitably cause the ruine of our nation for though still there be wealthy men left as they shew it in their cowardise and fear to engage for the general good yet they grow thinner every day whilst such as are left no root of their own rather than they will wither will turn suckers on the stock of others
so that the greatest happinesse rich men can promise to themselves is only to be last devoured though the comfort of the latenesse will not countervail the sadness for the certainty of their destruction
indeed it is miraculous that our nation hath subsisted so long and few there are that would believe that the whole candle of our english wealth could last so long as we have beheld it burning in the socket but now giving the last blaze

if god be not mercifull and men discreet to prevent it


passe we from the sad malady to the sole remedy thereof say sole not exclusively of divine miraculous power but according to humane apprehension and this is a free and full parliament
indeed is a tautologie like a reasonable man who if not reasonable is no man as the other if not free no parliament
but the late frequent forces put on partiaments hath made the needlesse epethite become necessary to expresse what kinde of parliaments we desire
not such in which every word must be spoken under correction of the sword but wherein every member without feare of violence to interrupt or dissolve them may follow the dictates of their owne judgement and conscience

nor ought a parliament only be free from force but also from any abjurations or previous engagements
let them take heed of renouncing any thing save what is simply sinfull in it selfe as the forsaking of the world flesh and divel as was solemnly promised for them in their baptism
but it is bad to be busie with other especially of the royall family


look backward and we may say with david the vows of the lord are upon us mean on so many of us as are of fifty years of age
the oath of supremacy not to mention the covenant is the eldest brother to whom the inheritance

of our consciences doth belong


look forwards it limiteth gods providence which is an hainous offence we know not what a day month year may bring forth
this age hath the least reason of any to meddle with the of such oathes which in a short but thick time hath seen so many strange things that now nothing is strange unto us
have we not seen cromwell from a private gentleman gradatim ascend to be protector of three nations and by his courage and wisdome without any right a more absolute power was possessed by and larger tribute paid unto him than to any king of england
his son and successor counted bad by many for his goodnesse and mild spirit for eight months was congratulated by the most considerable persons of our nation
now if some twenty years since an oath had been tendred unto us to abjure the family of cromwels from ever having the supream magistracy in our nation such an oath would have seemed safe but yet it was not lawfull to take it because none knew what was in the womb of teeming time though utterly improbable to our beliefe


besides the imposers of this oath may miss the mark they propound to themselves viz assurance of their own and discovery of the opposite party for many now pass not for the taking or breaking of any oath and assurance of such is hard in keeping and indeed

not worth the having
other will behold the oath as temporary and expiring with the power of the imposers
as for the conscientious indeed eefusing it out of pure principles of piety it is a barbarous act for persons in power to turn executioners to strangle tender consciences whose cordial fear of an oath should be encouraged


as the parliament must be free no vassal but enfranchised from the sword so must it be full no cripple but entire and compleat in all the members thereof
our land hath lately groaned under the most grievous monopoly as ever was or can be when a handfull of men have grasped to themselvs the representing of a whole not to say nation most of them being but burgesses who though equal in votes are not equal in their representation with the knights of the shires
if they presume that the rest excluded by them far more considerable for birth estates number love of the people and what not are virtually included in them it is an intollerable presumption
that what pertaineth to all should be handled by all is a truth so clear and strong that they must offer a rape to their owne reason that deny it
such also is this maxim vnrepresented unconcluded so that if so few have in them the notion of a parliament it is a bare notion indeed especially seeing this handfull of men were say the cavaleers dissolved by the death of the king dissolved said cromwell by his sword dissolved

say some great ones by an act of their owne entred into the iournall book of the parliament dissolved must their own consciences say by their voluntary accepting of elections in later parliaments


now the members of a free and full parliament the onely hope of humane help ought thus to be qualified


let them be godly and indeed and not in the canting language of the times

men of estates who will be tender in taxing others as striking them thorough themselves whilst such who bear nothing care not how much they burthen others as if paying were as easie as voting and money as free as words

men of spirits no dull souls all the sparks of whose activity are quenched in their own flegm


no gainers by the continuance of the army
demetrius the was no foole what ever else he was so sticking for the shrine of

diana by which craft he got his gain


men of moderation a quality not opposed to diligence but to violence not unactiving men but regulating their activity


this their moderation must appear in considering all interests seeing there be no two interests in the nation so contemptible which if united and twisting their discontents together cannot draw trouble on all the rest
especially the sectarian though presented believe by their party through a multiplying glasse are considerable on a politick score of their numbers and pious account of their conscience for though many of them carry the later in their purses who when they finde the moisture of profit to fail them will fall off like leaves in autumn yet can not be so uncharitable but to believe that many of them having the heat of their affections above the light of their judgements follow erroneous consciences besides having gone loose so long they must needs swell if hardly girded a suddenÂ·


this moderation also must be used by all other persons to work themselves to be if not pleased contented with the decisions of a

free parliament
all must sit down losers save such alone who can plead that they have been no sinners in our nation
the grand designe must be to have none or if that be impossible as few as may be utterly ruined
confesse two hungry meals makes a third a glutton and such who have long fasted from their detained estates will be not onely greedy but ravenous to recover them
yea such will shrewdly plead that they now expect moderation from them who never used moderation to them
however in such a general danger men must depose their animosities labouring first to reconcile their spirits then their perswasions the later being at lesse distance than the former
and men must divide where they cannot get the whole seeing few will pity his starving who will eat no bread at all because he can recover but halfe of his own loafe


it will be objected that such a full is still but an empty parliament having no house of lords therein but know if both hands of a man be bound no hope of liberty from himself but if one be untied it may do the brotherly office to unloose the other let us be content to row in a sculler till we can get a pair of oars
and such surely is the ingenuity and publick spiritnesse of the peers that laying aside personal interest which upon debate may appear more they wil suspend their

rights immunities and priviledges and submit all to the determination of a to acquiesce therein


god give our nation seasonably to understand their own strength that the wars begun may be ended amongst our selves before forreigners become the arbitrators of our differences who will demand great wages for little work yea and turn their own paymasters thereof
and may that great general whose intentions long have stood in the dark to our nation whilst our nations desires were all the while in light to him understand that vox populi is vox dei and interpret that god calleth unto him by the declarations of all counties to be chiefly instrumental in asserting our liberties and we shall have cause for ever to blesse the day of his nativity yea to erect a statue better than gold of gratitude in onr hearts unto him

indeed had providence fixed our nativities under the duke of muscovy whose list is his subjects law we would because we must work our selves patiently to the obedience of his power
but seeing god hath given us with paul to be acts
though also with the centurion we have given great summs not to obtain but contrive this freedome let us not tamely loose our and vigorously endeavour their preservation


the story is wel known of the old woman who having but a small parcel of wood would leasurably roast her goose stick by stick till her wood was all burnt aud her goose still raw
if the severall counties singly engage one after another all will be overthrown and nothing effected as to our releife
let the two and fifty shires of england and wales with the city of london which eminently is two and fifty more be all as one and unanimously advance the worke and not do as they dealt with poore cheshire using it as ioab did vriah putting him forward on action then falsely retreating from him and leaving him a prey to his enemies
but hope our old shipwracks will be new to us documented by former nocuments to steer a surer course for the general good


there is no english man so inconsiderable but he may at the least in a single capacity be contributive to the happinesse of his native countrey the wise with their brains the rich with their purses the learned with their pens the strong with their persons all with their prayers
and if now they suffer this opportunity which god puts into their hands to slip thorough their fingers they may hereafter have more yeares to bemoane their folly

than minutes to amend their misery it being better now to say we will not than three yeares hence to say we cannot pay our taxes

finis

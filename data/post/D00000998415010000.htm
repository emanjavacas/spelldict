AN EPISTLE IN THE PERSON OF CHRIST TO THE FAITHFVLL soule, written first by that learned LANSPERGIVS, and after translated into English by one of no small fame, whose good example of sufferance liuing, hath and wilbe a memoriall vnto his countrie and posteritie for euer.
Doe heere present to thy charitable regarde (most curteous and Christian reader.)
spirituall writen to the faithll soule, in the person of Christ himselfe; ich letter beeing first penned in Latine by learned Lanspergius, (who for his iustly deserued to bee called Iustus was erwards translated into our vulger tongue some one, as it seemeth of no vulger sorte; ose stile sheweth him to be of so good minde iudgment, (as his labours might rightlie challenged better grace fortune,) then published (as once they baue bin) without face, (but not without blemish of a multie of the Printers escapes,) that which is der the~ either of the other, to be in such sort ressed, as very few and almost none of the le presse came to their designed vewe. nes whereof can rightly resemble this more blessed then fortunate Epistle to going from the Caldeans to Ioseph, his cloake flinging away from his wife, or to Dauid barefooted and flying from the face of his Sonne
And on the other side, can no les fitlie compare the wanton louewrit toies (wit which the amorous of this humorous age a so much assotted) to the Idolatrous Chaldans, to Iosephs vnchaste and wanton mistr and to the vnrulie and wicked Absalon, (notwithstanding all their vanities) follow for a soone vading time, with all worldlye fuours, hauing plentie of Patrones to Fauorites to receaue and read them, and many by a great many (God knowes) doo too too much reckoning of them.
For cer if it be truely said that in the sacred scriptu and in all other good and Godly writers, talketh and speaketh vnto the readers.
Th is no doubt but the diuell in like manner spketh or talketh with such indiscreete wa timers, as doo spend the precious accompt time, allotted them in this life to winne in reading prophane aud pernitious babments, which doo draw (the more is the tie) an infinite companye to the bottomlesse of hell.
Take therefore vppon thee bech thee (friendly Reader) for thine owne e, to patronize this poore pamphlet, being as ere but a handfull of good and healthfull Read them often and retaine the~ aies in thy remembrance, and (which shall thy greater auaile.)
Put them duly by al meanes thou maiest in perfect execution: hall vice bee loathed, and vertue beloued, selfe benefited, the writers and translators uailes well recompenced, God glorified, labours most happely imployed.
HEnce Venus idle ympes, hence, hence in haste, Here is no place for Cupids fancies blinde: All wanton eyes and eares which are vnchaste, Are here vnlike their bace content to finde: For only such as vertue haue imbraste: May here learne how to loue, to liue, to dye, And after death to scale the loftie skye.
WHo so in quiet calme of conscience cleare, Haue vewde with sound aduise worlds wauer ioi
And seene the snares, the cares, the sorry cheare, The hopes, the haps, the feares the great annoyes: Which daylie doo to worldlie mindes befall, And fortune glad, and sad would daunt withall· Let them draw nere this Pamphlet to peruse, And they shall see the lawes of perfect loue: How sinne to shun, and Godlie life to chuse, Which done: If they the weedes of vice remoue, And the seedes of vertue here in grace, They may well hope in heauen to haue a place.
soueraigne God, why mortall limmes, Vpon thee didst thou take: slyding downe from toppe of skye, earth thy dwelling make.
That earthly man, whom error foule, had fondly led a stray: By me might learne how be to heauen, might take the readie way.
What forced thee, who alway wert, from euery sinne so pure: Such grieuous paines, aud death with all, so gladly to endure.
The loue bare to man that him, whom sinne had clogged so: Our blood (by clearing well) might make, aboue the stars to goe. CHRISTIAN.
Why be thy armes so spred abroad, and out so farre? And whats the cause (sweet Christ) thy feete, so close conioyned are.
Cause euerie where from euery coast, diuers nations call: And in one faith, with stedfast league, do conioyne them all.
But why with bended dost thou, so bend thy likewise: And so on earth Fast fixed cast, thy countenance and eyes.
monish men, that they may shun, with peuish pride to swell: And humbled necks, with sacred yoake, to daunt and gouerne well.
Why is thy body naked so? and wherefore is thy hue: So dry and leane? and all thy limmes so stiffe and starcke to vew? CHRIST.
would that ryot of the world, should hatefull seeme to thee: And that thou wouldst feele hunger, thirst, and pore estate with me.
But whitish veyle thy slender loines, doth compasse round about: Doth hidden part admonish ought, resolue pray this doubt.
Learne thou hereby that bodies chaste, doo greatly me delight: And that loath that lawles loue disclose foule thinges to sight.
What doo thy blowes, bespettinges, taunter, and cruell scourgings tell: With Crowne of and (of the Crosse) the other torments fel. CHRIST.
That he must suffer each offence, and offer no annoy: Which quiet peace aboue the stars, desireth to enioy.
Life is but short, the labour light, most wished is the pay: The benifit is infinite, which neuer shall decay.
But now if great rewards doo not, at all with some preuaile: Yet let them feare the banishment, of euer during Gayle.
The quenchlesse the vglie darke, which neuer shall abate: The gnawing worme for aye, for aye, the bitter wretched state.
The griesly groanes, the sorrowes sharpe, the wofull The endles plaints, the cursed ill, which neuer will away.
For such paines rest, for those whome now, lewd lust (which lasts small while) Enioy, and with false flattering snares, deceitfully beguile.
To greedy wretches vaunting wealth, to flouthfull case· And cursed Venus chamber worke, the wanton crew to please.
Sweet wine and daintie cates to such, as in their panch delight: Pompe to the proude, and spoiles to such, as hardie are in fight.
The haplesse route inticed thus, with these decaitfull traines: Mindlesse of sauing health doo fall, to vtter wracke and paines.
And neyther heare my counsayle good, nor seeke to follow me: And to conclude feare not my doome, how sharp so ere it be.
That dreadfull doome, when ere at last, that dismall day befall: That day of wrath, that day of wrake, and hugie storme with all.
When of the shaken firmament, the hideous clashing sound: Shall trouble starrs with tumblings swift, and dash their globes on ground.
When as the moone with lampe, the people shall affright: And globe of Sunne draw in his beames depriuing men of light.
When all shall dread, and all the world, at once shall shaken be So as the quiers Angelicall, men may amazed see.
Fire shall consume the world with noyse, and crackling flash of flame: And earth and sea, and burning lampe, of fierie lump shall frame.
Straight waies with dreadfull maiestie, with powre and vertue great.
Come I, and on a glistering cloud, will sit in indgment seate: There many thousand shall of roundly inuiron me: Yea there of glorious Angels bright, shal many thousands be.
Forthwith the Trumpet from aboue, shall gastlie noise sound out: Renting the earth, and raysing vp, the low infernall rout.
The by and by shall al the dead, all vp together rise: Whome earth so great, in womb so wide, did heretofore comprise.
The multitude reuiued shall, before my throne be prest: Expecting there, with trembling feare, my dreadfull doome and hest.
For nothing shall be vndiscust, nor hid: nor secret ought: No not the thing which any haue, committed in their thought.
There shall desert receaue reward, the life which liues for aye: Or els the death which neuer more, shall haue a dying day.
Go too then wretches whom as yet, lewd error fettereth close Whilst that you may of fettered feete, the giues and chaines vnloose.
Watch well that deadlie sleepe do not, your waking eyes oppresse: Lest endles day of latest time, you slumbring do possesse.
Behold with how swift course the times, doo slip and slide away: And how the flying houre admits, no manner let or stay.
Happie is he who still his life, doth well and Godly spend: And thinks withall it shall forthwith, and in a moment end.

AN EPISTLE OR EXhortation of Iesus Christ to the soule, that is deuoutly affected toward him, wherein are onely contained certaine diuine inspirations, which will teach a man how to knowe himselfe, and instruct him in the perfection of true Pietie.
IESVS CHRIST THE SAuiour of the worlde, and King of heauen and earth, being ready to embrace those that earnestly and truly desire his grace, with his mercifull fatherly armes, wisheth to his Spouse, that is, to the soule which loueth him (for whose sake he willingly suffered death that he might vnite her to himselfe) all perfect and true felicity.
My deerely beloued Daughter haue spoken to thy heart by secrete inspirations, but thou wouldest neuer giue eare vnto my motions, wherefore since thou diddest care little to answere me, much lesse to obey me, am enforced by the great loue beare thee, to write vnto thee, that at the least thou mayest bee content to reade what thou diddest neglect to heare, by reading both better beare away my exhortation, and more deeply imprint it in thy minde.
For that which moued me to offer my selfe, not onely to all danger, but euen to death it selfe, for thy sake, will not suffer mee to leaue any thing vndone that may tende to the furtherance of thy saluation: And although thou dost not in any sort requite my loue, because thy hart is inclined to outwarde vaine, and transitory things, and so by that meanes too much affected and addicted to my creatures: Yet cannot withdrawe that charity, wherewith am alwaies ready to imbrace thee, which exceedeth the loue of any father or mother towardes their children, or of any earthly Parent whatsoeuer: For am not onely willing to graunt thee my grace and fauour, but desirous to accept thee for my spowse, and will daily enrich thee with greater and better blessings, than any that this world can yeeld thee, if thou wilt follow my counsaile.
But for that thou hast contemned me whe~ came to visite thee, and hast not harkened to my inspirations, thou art become by this euill custome of thine so much distracted in thy soule, and so far beside thy selfe, as thou art neither able to conceiue what thou hast lost, nor yet the misery wherein thou art.
And the lesse that thou dost bewaile and lament thine owne misery, the more doth thy case deserue to be pittied and lamented.
VVhat shall say my daughter? thou shouldest be an example to others, and thy life an instruction to those that goe astray: the sweete sauour of thy good conuersation, ought to bee a holsome medicine for the curing of such as are weakened with infection of sinne, and thy words as a consuming fire, to inflame the harts of those that heare them: But now thou art thy selfe so corrupted with the desire of chidish vanities, so busied with a multitude of vnprofitable matters, and so subiect to many hurtfull passions, as thou art distracted in thy soule, and hast it so much polluted with filthinesse, as it is possessed with wandring thoughts and vaine imaginations; Selfe loue doth as yet raigne in thee, and till thou mortefie that, thou canst neuer enter into my bed, or be partaker of my delights: So as thou which oughtest to teach others, standest now in neede of being taught thy selfe.
write not this to the end, that meane to reiect thee, but because would let thee know how far thou hast erred, am desirous that thou shouldest vnderstand thy own losse and danger; do not only allure thee, but do also prick thee forward to returne from thence, home againe vnto mee.
VVheresoeuer thou art, whatsoeuer thou dost, or whether so euer thou goest, my eye is neuer off on thee, looking and searching into all thy acts, all thy motions, and all the secrete intentions of thy hart.
And if at any time spie in any of these the least vnfaithfulnes to mee, who am most faithfull, am iustly offended and angry; for did suffer not onely with all patience, but euen with all willingnes, many despites, reproches, griefs, and torments for thy sake, my most deare daughter, to passe ouer in silence all the paines and torments which did endure, tell mee pray thee, what man would haue suffered so many and so great disgraces for his friend, as did for thee? And yet indured them when thou wert mine enemy, when thou dadst done no good at all, when thou didst neither loue nor know mee, yea before thou wert borne did loue thee, and suffer these grieuous and innumerable torments for thee.
VVhy then wilt thou turne away thy self from me? why dost thou seeke quietnes without mee? thou art sickly, and yet wilt wander abroad: If forsake thee, who will receiue thee? who can cure thee? Alas my daughter how far art thou deceiued? whether soeuer thou turnest thine eyes, or vppon whatsoeuer thou dost fixe thy minde; yet shalt thou finde no peace, no ioy, nor any rest, but in me onely.
Thy senses deceiue thee, they which seeme to loue thee doo abuse thee; and thou also dost deceiue thy selfe, when thou refusest a soueraigne medecine that would helpe thee, and receiuest ranck poyson, which will kill thee.
Alas my daughter, alas my spouse; know how often, beautifull and goodly things in shew, but vaine things in deed, (which when they professe most loue faith vnto thee, are most ready to beguile thee) doo allure thy senses, and drawe thy affection, and how often also they deceiue thee with their snares, leade thee from mee with their guiles.
deare daughter, remember that thou art a spouse, and let not the loue of any other thing but onely thy husband enter into thy hart.
Desire nothing but his fauor, that thou maiest be beautifull in his eyes, and please him, and be for euer beloued of him.
stande desiring thee, and waiting for thee, with that thou returne vnto mee with all thy hart, and forsaking all these vanities, apply thy selfe wholy to deuotion, and giue thy selfe daily to humility, that might then vouchsafe to talke with thee in more familiar sort and reioyce thy minde, with far better and purer delights, than those wherein thou hast lyen drowned.
require no multitude of workes at thy hands, wherewith to trouble thee, but a chast, faithfull pure hart, which may seeke to please me, not delight it selfe.
desire a sincere loue, and a feruent deuotion, that is a ready and forward will to honour and obey mee, and a sincere pure intention in performing of all those things that commaund.
with that thy hart should be cleare and free from any other loue whatsoeuer, and if thou wouldest presente it to mee in this indue thee with greater consolations and far more excellent blessings, than either thou darest presume to desire, or art able to conceiue.
am a husband that is bashful, and therefore will neuer come vnto thee, when see thee busied with other matters altogether vaine and vnprofitable.
VVhen come must finde thee alone, for stand knocking at thy dore, being very weak, and quaking for cold, euen in the same forme that carried when was vnlosed fro~ the Piller, where being bound, was whipped and wounded for thy sake, and this doo, that may make an impression of my selfe in thy minde, wounded as was, that thou imbracing me with the armes of thy loue, may vnite thee vnto mee, and inflame thee with my woundes, that doo yet boyle with the feruent heate of that charity which carry towards thee.
Oh if thou wouldest acknowledge me for thy husband, loue me as thou ought to doo, wouldest thou not both quickly drawe me into thy hart, and also before came, with a most desirous will, attend and long for my comming, and wouldest thou nor then cloath the naked, and giue fire to warme him that is a colde, that thou mightest bee made worthy to receiue againe the chast imbrasings of my loue, and to inioye the sweet taste of my spirite? How much would it please me that thou haddest a certaine firme trust in me, and were as willing to bee with me, as am desirous to bee with thee, seeing all my delight consisteth in being with the Children of men.
So should the fortitude of thy minde, be dayly augmented, and the true sweetnes of thy soule continually increased.
But this trust in me can neuer be without a distrust in thy selfe, both these graces, are onely obtained by pouerty of spirit, which is a most precious Iewell.
But know well inough what doth thee from attaining to this vertue, thy stomacke is ouerlaide with the loue of this worlde, and by that meanes infected with such an extreame coldnes, as it maketh thee to loath and abhorre the worde of God, which is the food of thy soule.
But if thou desire to increase in vertue, to strengthen thy mind with the following of that course, thou must receaue the word of God greedily, disgest it perfectly, and still retaine the nourishment of that within thee.
The reason therfore that thou canst not thirst after my iustice, is because thou art already filled with the cold meat of worldly conuersation and vanitie, and that is the cause also why these things do delight thee, which sauour neither of piety nor deuotion.
Simplicitie of heart is loathsome vnto thee, and the exercise of holy meditations, thou accou~test as time lost.
Thy minde beeing loaden with the cares of this worlde, cannot ascend vp vnto mee.
For although thou raisest it by force for a while: yet it presently falleth downe againe into her earthly cogitations: so as thy soule being distracted, thy heart inconstant, thy minde wauering, and thy desires insnared with the loue of worldlie pleasure: thou art troubled when thou art awake, and not quiet when thou art a sleepe.
And when thou liest in this misery, vnwise daughter, then thou complainest that thou art drie and barren, without my consolation.
If this did happen vnto thee, by the meanes of my prouidence (as it hath to manie other of my friends,) and not by thyne owne negligence: there were no reason why the wanting of this sensible grace of mine shuld molest thy soule.
But seeing thy owne slouth and negligence is the cause that thou liest languishing in this barren drienes: If thou desire my consolation, if thou wish for my comming, if thou doe long to bee vnited vnto me, thou must forsake all those vanities, that doe please thee without me, only study to serue me, indeuouring continually to perfourme those thinges, which agree best with my liking, and are most pleasing vnto me, and making this thy cheefest care, thou must labour with all thy force might, to see my will as nere as thou canst, in all creatures fulfilled.
Moreouer in dooing hereof, let thy whole studie be to content mee, and to relie onelie vppon me.
So shalt thou finde my presence more often with thee, by it, thy spirit shall be as it were made dru~ck with ioy, thy conscience shalbe comforted, thy heart quieted, thou shalt then possesse the perfecte rest of most sweet contemplation.
Oh if thou hadst once come into that wine Celler, out of doubt thou wouldest euen with a certaine thirstinesse, more earnestly desire to be there, and more often.
But no man can enter into it, sauing such as desire me aboue al things, loue me aboue all things, esteeme me aboue al things, make acount of me as all in all.
For hee that findeth no other consolation but in me, hee that thinketh himself vnworthie to receiue any consolation from me, nay he that desireth affliction so much in this world as he taketh himself to be wro~ged, when send him any consolation at all, and doth as willingly accept it at my hands, when leaue his soule barren without any comfort, as when replenish it with my consolatio~, to whom all ioy without me is a torment, hauing his minde wholy fixed vpon me, his desire only bent to serue me.
Such me~ as these be, say are my special friends, at whose dore doe freely knocke, willingly enter: these are the men to whome gladly offer my selfe, impart my secrets.
These men am wont to visite in sundrie sortes, as seemeth fittest in my indgment, by stirring the~ vp in such sort as is meete agreeable for the deuotion and loue which they beare me.
Sometime present my selfe to the eyes of their soules, wounded, naked, and tormented in all my members, that they may finde greater comforte in the loue they beare me, shew the~ my wounds, to the end that they may touch them, bath them, clense them, kisse them, embrace them: and although their deuotion in this behalfe may seeme to worldly men ridiculous because they knowe not what it meaneth, yet is it most acceptable vnto me profitable to them.
For then begin to forgette all the paines which haue suffered, and also all the faultes which such a spouse of mine hath committed against me, do wholy bend my selfe to comfort her with my spirit, and to lighten her with my grace.
And although stand not in neede of any thing, yet make account haue gained much, when finde so great fideliue in my spouse, as shee loueth mee better than eyther her selfe, or all the world besides.
But vnthankfulnesse doth offend me much as fidelitie doth content me, and is of all things most grieuous vnto me, because by it they seeke to renue (as much as lieth in them) the griefes of my Passion, and vexations of my mind, seeing perceaue that all is lost, which did of an vnspeake by charitie endure for them.
Therefore, whether outwarde affliction of thy bodie, or inwarde affliction of thy minde happen vnto thee, seek not for externall comforts, which are nothing worth, but in all thy distresse flie vnto mee, and make no complaint of thy griefe vnto any man but to me onely.
For what greater help can men yeeld thee, than in giuing thee faire words? If thou hast a Ghostly Father or Confessor, forbid thee not to disclose it vnto him, but exhorte thee to lay open before him the secrets of thy heart, and to direct thy selfe in all respectes, according to his counsaile, without yeelding any waie to satisfie the furie of thy Passion, or labouring for some eternall comfort, or boasting before others, of those vexations which thou dost suffer.
Declare to me in secret, that which thou wouldest complaine of before men, committing thy selfe and all things to my prouidence being quiet without any care or perturbation of thy minde.
Thou shalt finde (beleeue me) a happie peace in thy soule, and great consolation by this course at my hands, although not such peraduenture at all times as thou dost imagine or wish for, yet such as may most of all conforme thee to my will and pleasure.
Oh if thou wert taught and accustomed by thine owne experience in all worldly thinges which trouble thee, to haue thine eye only fixed vpon me, to flie vnto me for refuge, to hope in my mercie with a patient expecting of the same, to relie vpon me, and withall to conceaue with how fatherly louing a minde, send thee aduersitie for thy benifite: there should be no tribulation so great, that thou wouldest not with al gladnes and willingnes accept, yea and prefer it before all ioy or consolation whatsoeuer.
For albeit thou shouldest receaue no other commoditie by it, yet this were sufficient to comfort and reioyce thy minde, that it is a fulfilling of my will.
If my will bee done, it doth alwaies please the faithfull soule, more than the receiuing of any other benifite, although in truth my will be neuer but to do that which may be most for her commoditie.
It will also help thee very much for retaining a quiet minde in all aduersity, to lay before thy eyes the acts and miseries of my life, and euermore to carry within thee, a liuely represe~tation thereof.
For if thou doe imprint this in thy minde, it will make thee thinke all bitter thinges sweet.
Meditate therfore at all times vpon my torments, and desire at my hands continually with sighes and teares, that may vouchsafe to make a strong and an effectuall impression in thy heart of my woundes and passion, that thou mayest see me crucified at all times, in all places, with a heart that doth euen suffer with mee, and let the liuelie representation hereof, banish from thy soule all other imaginations whatsoeuer.
If thou returne in this sort from all outward to inward thinges, shalt dwell within thine owne selfe, if thou beholde in thy heart my grieuous torments, and my selfe crucified, if thou heare me cry when was replenished with all sorrow and bitternes, and not releeued with anye consolation from my father: My God, my God, why haste thou forsaken me: thou shalt (being inflamed with the vertue of my passion) haue a desire to immitate me, to suffer for me, and to serue me without any comfort at all, in contempt resignation of thy selfe.
They that serue me with this minde, and are vnited vnto me for meere loue onelie, continue faithfull vnto me without any other respect but to please me, and to haue my will wholy fulfilled in the~, these men say, are my faithfullest most speciall friendes.
And in what drines or desolation so euer they may seeme to be, and with what temptations so euer they may seeme to bee ouerwhelmed, and as it were cast off and forsaken of mee, yet in truth they are still mine, because they fight manfully at their own charge, for my cause against the whole army of wicked te~ptations, which doe continually assault men in the welfare of this present world, and will not reuoult from my Campe although sometime strike punish them.
But doe not altogether leaue the~, for seeing they haue conquered all their passions, and renounced all theyr owne appetites to please me, and for my sake: yea and haue euen altogether forsaken themselues, and giuen themselues onely to me, in beeing subiect wholy to my will: cannot hold, but must also power my selfe into them, both fill, nourish and possesse their soules with my comfort, which is a hundred times better, purer sweeter, then that worldlie pleasure which they haue forsaken.
They cannot receaue this (as haue often told thee, and will not cease to beate into thy minde) which doe seeke or accept of any forraine comfort, that proceedeth not from me, or is not in me.
For my consolation is wonderfull sweet, bestowed only vpon such as will admitte me no other.
It is also most pure and therefore cannot bee mixed with anie consolation that is deriued from my cretures.
But why do so often repeat these thinges vnto thee? Truely doo it to make thee more wise, watchful circumspect, and to the end that thou shuldest not be snared with these corrupt and earthly delights, nor yet bee brought by them to forget me, seing can neuer forget thee, although that thy saluation only dependeth vpo~ my prouidence, not mine vpo~ thee in any sorte.
wish also that thou shouldest be alwaies with mee, by being with me, inioy all perfect felicity.
But why do not fulfill this? marry euen for thy good, that thou maist increase in vertu, to the great profit of thy soule, thy greater glorie.
For thou mayest by my grace daylie increase in goodnes, be made euery moment more rich in merit.
VVherefore seeing this is so, how foolish dost thou think them to be, how much to be lamented, which doe spend the most precious time of grace that haue allotted vnto them, not only, not to my honour and their own profit, but to the heauier agrauating of their damnation by wicked life? Oh that thou knewest, howe much thou mightest encrease in the vertues of thy soule, and in merit by my grace euery houre, and also how deare a euill time is, and how damnable the losse therof: For thou wouldest then out of doubt take care with more diligence that the smallest moment shuld not passe thee vainely, nor yet slip away without reaping some benefit to thy soule.
VVith the Sunne rising euery day, there shall then arise a newe ioy into thy minde, that had graunted thee the commoditie of that day, by it so much longer space to honour and serue mee.
Thinke therefore, and say euerie houre vnto thy selfe, our Lorde which loueth me hath vouchsafed to giue me this houre, this moment, and hath prolonged the course of my life hetherto, that should euen now begin to turne vnto him, and endeuour my selfe to please him.
my Daughter, euer aboue all things carrie this opinion, that the present moment wherin thou liuest is the first time, wherein thou beginnest to doe well, and contemne all that thou haste done before as nothing worth, VVhat occasion soeuer, what busines soeuer, what idle time soeuer, or what other things soeuer, either may or shall happen vnto thee, vse them in such sort as thou imploy them to my glory, and conuert them to some benefit of thy owne soule.
For haue hetherto stirred thee vp, excited thee to depart from all vanities, with shutting the gates of thy senses against them, and to returne vnto me with a recollected and quiet minde.
It remayneth nowe that adde vnto this, as it were a rule to teach thee how to liue godly, which haue heard thee, by the inspiration of my grace, desire often at my handes.
For there remayneth as yet bashfulnes in thee (which like well) and which maketh thee ashamed in the opening of thy infirmities, faults, errors, negligences: also grieued that thou hast this long time heretofore, and dost euen at this present, so vnworthily vsurp the name of my spouse.
But seeing thou desirest to returne into my grace, there is nothing that likewise doe more affect or desire.
For what other ioy haue in beeing among you, then to receiue euery sinner into my fauor: howe much more then doe desire or rather long (as may in reason be iustly thought) to bring my spouse home vnto me, when she goeth astray, amongst the berries and thornes of worldly vanities.
Nay am so desirous to recall thee, as will prescribe thee a plaine path, wherein (if thou walkest) thou shalt be sure to follow my steps, neuer wander againe out of thy way.
Come therefore vnto me, and by thy returne, procure me a new ioy, such as delight in most, and desire euer to possesse.
MArke well (my daughter) for since see thee giue better eare, apply thy minde with more dilligence to carrie away my speeches: will proceed in declaring these thinges vnto thee, which require at thy handes: continue therfore attentiue, return nowe wholie vnto mee, beeing readie in all thinges to obey mee.
Put on a new minde, and heare what expect that thou shouldest do, and what thou art not able of thy selfe to do, let praier assist thee to fulfill.
Seek to obtaine by praier whatsoeuer is necessarie for thee, saying: Deliuer me from my enemies, Lorde, fly vnto thee for succour, teach me to doe thy will, because thou art my God: leaue me not Lord my God, depart not from me, neither yet dispise mee, which art the God of my saluation.
Incline thy selfe to helpe mee Lord, the God of my safetie.
Behold desire to returne vnto thee, draw me after thee, and neuer suffer me againe to bee seperated or withdrawne from thee.
my daughter, hearken now to that which gaue in commaundement to one of my seruants long agoe, and endeuour thou also to fulfill it.
Vse euer silence in thy tongue, And haue compunction in thy minde: Be humble, curteous, meeke milde, If thou in me wilt comfort finde.
The same words in the same forme doo speake vnto thee, hauing made it in the true measure of a verse (although thou shalt haue lesse neede of a measure to direct thee when thou art come to this perfection.
But doo not now deliuer it vnto thee, as framed in measure to please thine eares, but as a foueraigne medicine to cure thy soule.
haue comprehended al those thinges, which are necessarie for thee briefely in this verse, that thou mayest more easilie retaine them in thy memorie, and more often meditate vpon them in thy minde.
For my will is, that thou shouldest altogther applie thy endeuour, to haue a holye compunction for thy sinnes, and that leauing all other businesse aside, thou shouldest onely attend to a continuall and eternall conuersation, and remaining weaned from all other pleasures, to be recollected into thine own selfe, and so to continue alwaies free from any distraction or perturbation whatsoeuer.
Bee silent in thy tongue, pure from all filthines in thy heart.
Be humble and meek, and remember to shew thy selfe both curteous and gentle in all thy behauiour towards all sortes of men.
First of all, diligently examine thy selfe, and looke most neerely and narrowlie into thy selfe, that thou maiest know what is in thee, which is an impediment to thee, for the receiuing of my grace, that is to say, what is in thee which dooth displease mee, that thou mayest correct amend it.
Consider to what things, by what means thou art tempted, and where thou seest thy selfe most sharpely and oftnest tempted, there seeke to resist them with greatest dilligence, and most earnest endeuour.
VVhere thou findest thy selfe weaker, there appile more forcible remedies quickly to vanquish them.
VVhere thou perceiuest any occasion which moueth thee to sin, or not to profitte in this spirituall course, there cut off that scandall and impediment from thee.
Haue speciall care to present vnto mee, a pure hart: free from all vncleanesse, and neuer infected with any inordinate loue to my creatures, nor occupied with any vnnecessary businesse in this worlde, and labour euermore withall that thou art able, wholie to cleaue vnto mee, and still to rely vppon mee.
The cause why do exhort thee, to a continuall exercise of compunction, is that by it thou maiest keep thy selfe free fro~ forraine or wandring thoughts, which thou ca~st neuer attain vnto, except thou bee recollected in thy mind.
Neither canst thou come to be thus recollected, except thou lead an internall and solitarie life, priuate to thy self withdrawne from al worldly affaires.
VVherefore marke with a watchfull eye those vices, concupisences and wicked inclinationes which raigne in thee, that thou mayest neuer cease with all thy might to persecute them, willingly to mortefie in thy selfe all inordinate affections.
Many complaine that they are vnapt for contemplation spiritual life, but their owne negligence and slouth is the cause: for that they will straine themselues no whit to conquere theyr old man, that they may mortefie all lusts and concupisences, but doe nourish, cherish, fauour the~ which they ought to persecute, root out of their minds.
Therfore they carrie alwaies about them a heauy burden of vnquiet thoughts, filled with labor vexation.
but if thou desire to enioy me, haue no peace at all with any vice.
Banish from thee all vnprofitable discourses, cares, and businesses which yeelde no benefitte at all to thy soule.
And neuer applie thy minde to the thinking of any other matter, nor trouble thy selfe with anye other affaires, but such as tend to my honour, the saluatio~ of thy own soule, or the commodity of thy neighbour, that thou being thus alone and in this sort retired within thy selfe, mayest bee possessed with me, who will neuer bee matched with any other companion.
How wee must mortefie all vnlawfull desires and wicked inclinations.
VOuchsafe not to heare, much lesse to read any newes, tydings, or pleasant Histories, which serue not to procure a compunction in thy hart, but to delight a curious minde, and afterward doe leaue thy soule corrupted and infected with sundry imaginations and vaine desires.
Fly any speciall familiaritie, lyking or conuersation with worldly men, that is to say, with those that loue these earthly pleasures, yea enter not into any league of familiaritie, good will, and speciall conuersation with any such man, whose words deedes doe not edefie thee in this vertuous course, but auoide his company, and mortefie all sensuall loue in thy selfe, towardes any of my creatures.
Haue such a commandement ouer thy bellie, as that thou allow it only necessarie thinges, and that also not for the pleasing of thy taste, but for the susteining of nature, and for my sake, that by this meane thou mayest not decay, but encrease in abillitie to serue mee.
Moreouer, neuer receiue any thing to delight thy taste which is not necessarie and profitable for thy bodie, and especiallye when thou mayest obserue this without the breach of brotherlie charitie.
Roote out also from thy mind after this sort, and faile not both to flie and abhor all pleasant thinges, all voluptuous thinges, and all such thinges as seeme sweet to thy carnall appetite, as (farre as discreation wil permit thee, which doth quallefie all extremitie euer hauing a respect to charitie, to infirmitie, to the necessitie of nature, and to euery other thing that is conuenient) and euermore take a special care that in this gouernment of thy selfe, thou doost persecute concupiscence, but not destroy nature.
And as touching those thinges which are necessarie, and yet cannot bee receaued without some delight.
It is sufficient for thee if thou doost not seeke that delight but in respect of mee, that is to obey mee, who haue committed the care of thy body to thy selfe to refreshe the infirmitie of thy nature, so as thou takest this delight not as a thing which thou wishest for, but as a thing that can not be seperated from that which is necessarie for mans vse, admitting it only for necessitie, and not desiring it for pleasure.
Therfore to bee short, haue such a care and watch ouer all thy senses, as they may not mooue or turne themselues to anye vaine or vnprofitable thinges.
See nothing, touch nothing, know nothing, but that which may be profitable for thy soule and my glory.
VVherein soeuer a man doth follow his own appetite, seeking to satisfie it of a proper and selfe will, that is to say because hee will haue it so, or because he hath a desire thereunto, hee must needes offend, for hee that desireth anie thing in this sorte, whether it be in meate, drinke, or any other thing to refresh nature, or els in seeking the delight of some spirituall consolation, it cannot be done without sin, because there is in it a perticuler care to please his owne fancie, which doth deuide seperate him cleane from mee.
Suffer nothing therfore to grow in thee, or to be nourished by thee, which carieth any respect to satisfie thy owne liking, or to content thy owne will, although it may seeme to haue an apparaunce of goodnes: But thou must die to all loue of thy selfe, all desire of following thy owne appetite, that a naked, a simple and a pure charity without mixture of any other thing whatsoeuer, and a chaste intention to please me, may stir, mooue and procure thee to all the thoughtes thou thinkest, to all the wordes thou speakest, and to all the workes thou doest.
HAue as watchfull a care as thou mayest ouer thy tongue, and restraine it from all libertie, suffer it to vtter nothing, but that which is necessarie, and well thought of before, and in as few words as it is possible for thee to comprehend the same, with all modestie and meekenes, and without any great noyse or loude speaking, flying, and cutting off by all the meanes thou art able, any thing that may either occasion or procure thee to speake.
Abstaine from all wordes, that bee any way hurtful, backbyting, grudging, vncleane or contentious, as fro~ a mortall sinne.
Hauing a speciall regard to keepe thy selfe from all iesting, lightnesse, immoderate laughing, and idle wordes, and bee so carefull in this behalfe, as neyther thou vsest them thy selfe, nor yet heare them of anie other, as farre as it lyeth in thy power to auoide it.
And to the ende thou mayest bee free from that great vice of backbiting, resolue thou in thine owne hart, neuer to speake any thing of those which are absent, but such things as thou art sure doo tende to the edifiyng of mens soules.
Euer haue some meane readie at hand to break off that talke (if there be any speech offered of those that be absent) by bringing aptly in a discourse of some other matter, before there be any word vttered either in the backebiting or dispraising of them.
Take a most dilligent and heedfull care that thou speakest not thy selfe, nor sufferest any other, to speake of those which haue offended thee, or to ward whom thou findest in thy hart no perfect charitie, because men may easily fall by that meane, into the vice of backbiting, while they speake to please thy humor by flattering of thee and reproching of those that thou dost mislike.
Therefore neuer hearken to any accusation that is made of them which are thine enemies, or such as thou dost not loue.
Endeuour as much as thou canst to remaine alwaies in silence (I meane not onely the silence of thy tongue, but especially the silence of thy hart) so as there may not be heard within thy soule, any sound of vnlawful concupiscence, any noyse of vnquiet passions, or anie troublesome stirre of wicked affections, and inordinate inclinations: Neyther suffer thou vnprofitable discourses to arise in thine owne heart, with any vaine fancies, fond imaginations, or the deceitfull formes of such thinges as thou shalt haue there represented vnto thee: but euen as if thou haddest forgotten all other things whatsoeuer, wert out of this world: in quietnes and silence speake to me onely, and harken vnto me wholy.
Neuer striue with any man in words, neither seeke stifly to maintaine thy owne minde or opinion, suffer euerie man to haue his saying, if thou canst not disswade him by gentle wordes, or do him good by some milde exhortation.
And to conclude, resolue thy selfe neyther to dispute in words, neyther yet reason in thine own thoughts against him, but refer all thinges vnto me, and liue thou in all silence of thy tongue, in all quietnes of thy hart.
Of the contemplatiue life which is wholy withdrawne from the cares and affaires of this present world.
FLy the societie and of men, when thou art not otherwise enforced by necessity for my honour, or for thy neighbours saluation, be alwaies alone, for when thou art alone, then will reueale my selfe vnto thee.
Solitarines, silence, puritie and simplicitie of heart, doe prepare a place for me to dwell in.
Keepe thy selfe therefore withdrawne from all cretures, in silence quietnes of hart.
Neither vouchsafing to consent, nor yet to harken to the vnlawful appetits of thy wil, the wandring cogitations of thy minde, or the vaine desires of thy hart.
For thy nature (I know) is euer enclined to delite in consolatio~, is alwaies occupied, somtime with out labour in thy body, sometime with inward care in thy minde seeking consolation in my creatures, wherby thou commest to be many and sundry waies distracted.
Remember thou therefore to striue with all thy force against all thy sensuall and carnall inclinations, keepe thy selfe alone, being withdrawen from all creatures, and remayning euer both in outward solitarines of thy bodie, and inward contemplation of thy minde, as farre as discreation which must be thy guide, obedience to thy superiours, and charitie to thy neighbours will permit thee.
Take care also as much as conueniently thou mayest, not to giue others by thy example, any occasion of often meetings, or common familiaritie, because it doth verie much hinder the spirituall course of life, which is neuer so free from anye impediment, nor so apt to profit it self, as when it is seperated from all sorts of men, and all kinde of businesse: yet howsoeuer thou shalt chaunce to bee, either liuing amongst men, or sequestred from the society of men, remaine with me alwaies alone, recollected within thy owne soule, and withdrawne not onely from all other creatures, but euen from thine owne selfe, that is from all liking to procure thine owne pleasure, from all care, to seeke thine owne commoditie, and from all desire to serue thine own appitite.
Perswade thy selfe that thou art left alone in this world, and haste nothing to for but me, and therefore thinke of no other matter, and deale with no other creature, but with me only.
Examine not other mens actions, trouble not thy selfe with other mens affaires, if thou seest that which is good imbrace it, and let it edifie thee: if thou seest that which is euill, leaue it, but giue no iudgment of it.
Beware of obseruing, marking, examining, or iudging of such mens speeches, actions and manners, as cannot by their holie and good example edifie thee: Nay bee so farre from dooing this, as desire neuer to heare or vnderstand them, but rather seeke by all meanes not to know them at all.
And if thou shalt happen by any chance to heare them, roote them out of thy heart, and endeuour to forget them as soone as thou canst: especiallye if thou standest in danger by that means to offend in the breach of charitie, or to conceiue a opinion of those parties.
THinke ill of no man, although hee seemeth to thee to bee wicked, yet beleeue that he hath bin suffered to fall by some secret and hidden prouidence of mine, for the attayning of greater humilitie in himselfe, procuring of greater profit to his soule.
And thou oughtest neyther to iudge, nor yet despise him, but lament rather thy owne ingratitude towards me, because my grace only doth vphold thee, as it were violentlye against thy will, thinke that without it thou shouldest fall into greater, and more heynous sinnes than any other, therefore say vnto thy selfe: if this man had receaued so much grace as haue done, he wold haue serued God a great deale more deuoutly, beene more thankful vnto him, than haue beene.
Beleeue also, that as soone as looke vpon him with the eyes of my mercie, he will presently repent and amend; or els, that he is alreadie reformed and made more holie than those that despise him.
VVherefore ascribe thy ill conceait of him, to thine own fault rash iudgment, and reprehend thy selfe sharpely, because thou haste thought amis of thy neighbour, and done him wrong.
Rancor, hatred, bitternes enuie, doe many times hide themselues vnder the colour of zeale, which doe make men thinke, not only euery defect and light fault of theyr neighbour to be grieuous, but also to iudge their vertues to be vices, theyr sights beeing dimmed with the soggie mist of mallice and enuie.
Take speciall heede therefore that thou neyther reprehende nor accuse any man, nor yet either speak or heare of any mans faults whe~ thou art angry.
Beware also that thou dost not at that time seeke to gall him, gainesay him, or grieue him with any worde or shew of thine, neyther yet by chiding to procure humilitie and shamefastnes in him: or to declare that thou hast taken him in a fault worthie reprehension, meet to be spoken of, cheefely abstaine from dooing of this, as long as displeasure, bitternes, or any troubled and vnquiet passion dooth remaine in thy heart against him, and as long as thou dost desire to make others note him for his faults and offences, because thou haste neither zeale of charity, nor a sincere intention in thee at that time.
For if thou haddest, thou wouldest rather be sorrowfull, lament with him for his sins, and seeke as much as thou couldest, to excuse and couer before others thy Brothers or Sisters offence, if they had made a great fault, thou wouldest then rebuke them in secret not without greefe in thy owne soule, and wouldest pray earnestly vnto mee for them with a hart that did euen suffer with them for their offences, and were most louingly humbly affected towards them.
my daughter be dilligent to know what thou wantest, and what is fit for my spouse, as for other mens faults be deaffe to heare them, dumb to vtter them, and blind to see them.
Tell mee (my daughter) how great regard would a bashfull Virgin haue of her behauiour, if she stood in a Kings presence, and saw his eies continually fixed vppon her? After the same sorte thinke how that am in all places present with thee, and that thou standest alwaies in my sight.
Consider hovve great modestie there ought euer to be in thee, hovv great innocencie of life, and to bee short howe great reuerence thou oughtest to carrie towardes mee, which doe alwaies behold, and looke vvith my pearcing eyes into the depth of al thy acts, thoughts, passions, words, motions, intentions and euen the verie secrets of thy heart.
Presume not therefore to doe any thing in my sight, vvhich thou darest not offer to doe in the sight of one of my seruants, that vvere a very deuout man, and so generally accounted, and of all men greatly esteemed; for thou oughtest euer to feare the dreadfull presence of my almighty power, and infinite Maiestie, to haue it at all times, both laid before thy eyes, and imprinted in thy hart, that by it thou mayest bee stirred vp to loue and reuerence me, and bee carefull in all thinges to please mee, since thou art continually in my sight.
Thou shouldest not haue the peace of thy soule, which thou dost in all places desire to depende vppon mens mouths, that is, to be quiet when no man doth gainesay thee, but to rest vpon me and a good conscience.
Moreouer, thou oughtest to mortefie that appetite in thy selfe, which doth prouoke thee with an earnest desire and delight to be beloued, and commended of men.
Suffer men to bee men still, and apply thy selfe onely to loue mee, that thou mayest bee worthy to stande highly in my fauour.
Liue vprightly with thy neighbour· and loue him for my sake, neither care thou whether hee loue thee againe or not, but leaue it to me, and flie the familiaritie, both of men and women, but especiallie of those that be not of thine owne sexe.
If thou haddest as great a care, or at the least, no lesse respect to please me then thou haste, not to displease men, thou shouldest obtaine by it, greater consolation in thy soule, then if all the world did seeke for thy fauour.
BEE stout and circumspect to vanquish and purge thy soule of anie imperfection, although it be neuer so little, for the least sinne that offendeth mee, ought not to seeme small in thy eyes, if thou doost perfectlye loue me.
Call to minde the looue that thou diddest carrie towardes mee heeretofore, which made thee to contemne and forsake for the looue of me, thy Parents, thy Brethren, thy Sisters, thy riches, thy honour, whatsoeuer els that seemeth delightfull in this present world, and to conclude; euen thy selfe, that is: thy flourishing youth, and pleasantest yeares; hovve commeth it then novv to passe, that thou art vanquished with a most light temptation, and a vile motion of concupiscence? Thou knowest best thy selfe, how vveake and negligent thou art for the most part, and hovve hardly thou art drawne to ouercome vice, to bevvare of those snares vvhich may indanger thy soule, to flye the occasions and prouocations of sinne, to renounce thy ovvn will, and to amend the imperfections of thy hart.
Renew therefore thy constant and former determination, resoluing to persecute all vice in thy selfe, and not to suffer anie thing to remaine within thee, that is co~trarie to my vvill, for any vvorldly gaine vvhatsoeuer.
Neglect not to doe all those things vvhich please mee, and follovve that course of life vvhich require at thy hands, and is fit for thy vocation, vvith all care and dilligence.
Vse not to delay: neyther leaue those thinges vndone, vvhich is thy dutie to performe, and my right to receaue, but do them vvith courage stoutlie, vvillingly, carefullie, faaithfullie, and deuoutly.
VVhensoeuer thou findest in thy selfe, the motions of anger, concupiscence, vvantonnes, pride, such like motions of vices, bevvare that thou dost not suffer the~ violentlie to breake out of thee, by anie vvord or shevve: but seek by bridling resisting them, to suppresse and extinguish them.
The best and presentest remedie against all kinde of vice, is to cast thy selfe vvhen thou art tempted, prostrate at my feet vvith all humilitie, to consider hovve thou vvert made of nothing, and art nothing but by my grace; to returne vnto me vvholy, to repose all thy co~fidence in mee, to call vppon mee by continuall praier, perfectly to know that thou canst receaue no succour not remedy in this thy distresse, but from me only· Seeke to strengthen thine ovvn infirmitie in this sort euery howre, and renewe thy good purpose, euer perswading thy selfe, that the present instant wherein thou liuest, is the first time of thy beginning to doo well.
VVhen it shall seeme lothsome to thy nature, or goe against thy sensuall appetite, to take these labours, to enter into these combats and conflictes, and to doo many other things, which may seeme contrary and grieuous to thy minde in this exercise of vertue: euer the more that thine owne slothfull humour shall repine at them, the more earnestly endeuour thou to ouercome and mortefie these passions.
Bee not wearied with so holy a labour, neither cease thou to proceede in so good a course, lest it mooue mee also to stay from powring the influence of my grace into thee.
Be afraid lest that if thou yeelde thy selfe vanquished, or seemest tyred by reason of thy sloth: my grace shall forsake thee, and that will leaue thee to follow thy owne inuentions, and with a dangerous kind of securitie to satisfie thy owne desires; for it is a manifest argument, that haue then for thy owne deserts, both iustly and clearely reiected thee; VVhen thou feelest no worm of conscience gnawing within thee, no remorse for thy sinnes, nor any feare of my dreadfull iudgement.
Such as bee in this state, are in a most perilous case, for when they thinke peace neerest vnto them, then commeth destruction sodaine liest vppon them.
VVish in this small conflict or affliction, how little so euer it bee, to yeeld mee some recompence, as farre as lyeth in thy power, for those paines and torments, which both liuing and dying, endured for thy sake.
Be neuer wearied therefore, with fighting against many temptations, giue not place, waxe not faint, neither suffer thou thy selfe to bee ouercome with weakenesse in thy hart, nor desperation in thy minde, but persecute all vice with a continuall and mortal hatred, and as often as thou beginnest to faint, or to decline from thy former determination, so often rise againe, and make a new resolution.
One thing must needes vvarne thee of, vvhich hurteth thy selfe, and offendeth me, vvhich is, that thou art become sometimes so fainte harted, vvith thy faults and ouersights, as they moue thee to vvauer, in follovving of the good course that thou hast begun, and almost induce thee to dispaire.
This is the cause that doth make thee sit solitarie, pyning consuming for verie griefe, and not to returne vnto me that thou mayest rise againe, but euen vvith a kinde of dispaire to imagine, that all thou haste done before is vtterly lost and forgotten.
And thou shewest thy selfe by this kinde of dealing, to bee proude, because when thou diddest seeme to stand, thou diddest trust too much in thy owne force and abillitie, that maketh thee now to be so greatly troubled and perplexed in thy minde: because thy hope did faile thee, it fell out otherwise then thou didst expect or looke for.
My will is, that thou shouldest not vse the help of thy own force and endeuour, but vtterly to distrust both in them thy selfe, and to trust in me only, for as long as thou thinkest otherwise, thou art like euerie houre to come to ruine, vntill thou learnest this lesson, that when thou reliest vppon thy selfe, thine owne strength is no greater help vnto thee to make thee stand vpright, then if thou wert vnderpropped with a broken reede.
But dispaire not in me, reposing a most firme hope, assured confidence in my mercie.
And touching thy selfe, would haue thee to dispaire after this sort: not to refuse thy owne counsaile, thy own industry, thy own trauaile, and other thinges of such like kinde which proceede from thy selfe, but would haue thee continually to vse them, and yet not to rely vpon them, confidently to trust or delight in them, neyther yet would haue thee attribute any good thou receauest to thy selfe, or to thine owne dilligence for both thy selfe, and all these abillities which thou haste, haue not power to make thee withstand the smallest sinne, except thou be assisted with my grace and mercie.
Neither thinke thou that will presently power into thee, for one earnest praier, a fewe teares, or one onelie conflict against the temptation of sinne, all graces, all vertue, and all good gifts, or that will for this, send thee anie suddaine or extraordinarie profitte in thy spirituall course of life, or that thou shalt immediatlie come to attaine to all pietie and holines.
require at thy handes daylie paines, vnfeyned humbling of thy selfe, and a continuall fidelitie towards me, in fighting against vice.
looke for, also a firme hope, and an assured trust in my mercie, and a constancie in thee, that will neyther bee ouercome with any assault, nor yet wearied with anye trauaile.
And when thou shalt finde in thy selfe all these thinges which haue named, let there not want a most profound humilitie, whereby thou mayest bee brought perfectlye to know thy selfe, and to confesse that as thou wert made of nothing by my mercie, so thou art nothing but by my grace, attributing nothing to thine owne labour and trauaile, and acknowledging that thou haste deserued nothing, but ascrybing thy thirst after iustice, and all other good things which thou doest to me only.
Except thou knowest these thinges thou canst not but erre, and must of necessitie fall often, vntill thou come to learne what thou art of thy selfe, what thou art by my grace.
forbid thee not, but exhort thee to labour as much as thou canst, and to striue for vertu as much as thou art able; whe~ thou hast done all, trust not in any remedy, nor in any industry of thy own, that is without mee, but hope of this, pray for this, beleeue this certainly, that wil neuer faile to assist thee in all thy diligent vertuous labors, not in respect of thine owne deserts, but in respect of the loue and charitie which beare thee.
For seeing that haue giuen thee, a will, a desire, an inclination to fight, will also graunt thee for thy labour in fight (if thou perseuerest to the ende) a Crowne of glorie, a triumph of victorie, a most happie end of thy combat.
VVherefore, whether thou beest in war or at peace with thy selfe, whatsoeuer thou doest determine, whatsoeuer thou beginnest, or whatsoeuer thou dost enterprise, craue without ceasing my assistance by praier, and waite before the gates of my mercie.
Thy praiers shall neuer returne from me voide, and fruitlesse, although thou thinke thou haste receaued nothing; for it is often more profitable for thee, to pray humbly and earnestly, then to receaue and obtaine benifites.
It is often more gainefull for thee to trust in me, expect my leysure, then sencibly to feele, or possesse my consolatio~.
VVherefore be thou patient, long suffering: increase in all good exercises, in the loue of all that is good, betweene falling and rising, euer expect thou my grace protection: neither seeke to flie or to run awaye from the battaile, vntill all the fight be fully ended, the time be come for thee to receiue a glorious reward for thy painfull trauaile.
And because thou maiest bee the rather incouraged to proceed in this labour, assure thy selfe that euen in this life, thy enemies shall bee daylie diminished, and their force that assault thee continually thy selfe by my grace, and vse of sighting, wonderfully strengthned, in so much as that which at the first thou couldest scarcely scrape out with a file of iron, thou shalt come in time to driue away with a blast of wind.
Moreouer, whensoeuer thou chancest to fall, take this for a general rule, though thou fallest neuer so often, offendest neuer so greatlye, yet presently without any delay come vnto me, lamenting thy fault and bewaile it vvith mee, lying prostrate at my feete, and rise againe with me, leaning thy selfe vppon me, that is, repose thy confidence in my power, resoluing firmely to amend, and neuer to offende in it againe.
knowe mans weakenesse in generall, knowe also thine in perticular, and how apt man is of his of his owne frailtie to fall, howe it proceedeth from the mallice of the diuell for a man to bee vnwilling to stande, or vnwilling to rise againe after hee is fallen.
VVhich thing cannot onely bee by no meanes excused, but also receaueth without my mercie, a heauier damnation.
require nothing of thee but a good will, and nothing is in my eyes more precious then the same.
VVherefore if thou wantest force, abillitie, or time to doo good works, bee not dismaide, for thy good will doth fullie content mee.
Retaine euer within thy selfe a good will, for by it thou mayest satisfie for all thy defects, repaire all thy faults, although thou beest able to doe nothing besides.
VVhen thou thinkest mee fardest from thee, then am nearest vnto thee.
Therfore (my Daughter) as soone as thou shalt finde that thou haste offended, condemne thy selfe, and presently running vnto mee, confesse thy selfe guiltie, and make complaint against thy selfe vnto mee.
Thou canst not no sooner bee repentant; then haue graunted thee my pardon, neyther canst thou sooner aske forgiuenesse, then haue quite remitted and forgiuen all.
VVherefore then (O my Spouse) doost thou stay from returning vnto mee? Thy safety is not procured in flying from mee, but in flying vnto mee.
whatsoeuer thou seest that thou haste most offended: where thou findest that thou haste oftnest fallen: to conclude, where thou perceauest that thou haste most declined from vertue: there cry oftnest vnto mee, there sigh vnto mee with more often grones, and desire with all feruencie at my hands, both pardon for thy sinnes, and the protection of my grace.
Bee not wearied with temptations, but alwaies resiste them as much as thou canst, neither yeeld thy selfe as vanquished by them, or as a Prisoner vnto them.
For whatsoeuer thou feelest, and art enforced to suffer (as long as thou sufferest it against thy will, and resisting it is told thee before) vvill neuer impute it to thee as a fault, because require not an account at thy hands of that thou feelest, but of that to which thou consentest.
To feele motions of sin, is ingrafted as it were in thy flesh, but to consent vnto it, resteth in thy ovvne choyse.
There maye bee a certaine kinde of violence offered, to the flesh and senses, but the will canne neuer be compelled.
There are two thinges in temptation: one the matter whereunto thou art tempted, and that is a sinne, and imperfections, these thou must neuer consent vnto, neyther yet yeeld thy selfe in any sort vnto them, but resist them with all thy might.
The other is, that labour and distresse which thou doost endure in resisting them: and this thou must patiently abide and yeelde vnto, as long as it is my pleasure that thou shalt bee tempted.
For thou oughtest not to resist mee, but to subiect thy selfe wholly vnto my will, and to resist those motions which thou art stirred vnto by the meane of temptation: that thou mayest continue still in my fauour, receiue my grace, and be partaker of my consolation.
But knowe what thou wilt say, for am not ignorant of those thinges which thou dost suffer, and wherewith thy hart is afflicted.
will tell thee them therfore, since thou art ashamed to tell them thy selfe, that by it thou mayst be the better assured to receiue remedy, and consolation for them at my handes.
The temptation of thy flesh doth assault thee, not onely euery day, but euery moment.
To resist this continually is troublesome and grieuous, and to escape it without fighting, is impossible.
To fight long and not to bee wounded, is in thy iudgement not onely hard, but miraculous He that is thy enemie, is very familiar with thee, thou carriest him about with thee in euery place, thou art not permitted to destroy him, but thou art enforced to nourish him.
His weapons are many, his manner of fight diuers, and his assaults very violent, as the fierie heates, the feruent motions, the delightfull allurements, the terrible perturbations, the cruell onsets, the sweet pleasures of all kinde of lust and concupiscence, many such other which some men doo feele raging in their flesh like certaine furies of hell.
Now the strong impressions and delectations of them being in a manner violent and ioyned with these fancies, are almost sufficient to vanquish all thy senses.
Moreouer the instability, and inconstancie of some mens hart is so great, that euen in the very moment, wherein they prepare themselues to resist these temptations, they are presently as it were fallen beside themselues, and cleane forgetting that which they had determined, they begin to thinke of that which they did refuse to thinke of before.
Now who amongst these dangers (sayest thou) can escape safe? who can flee away from sinne vnwounded? marry a good and an humble will, for to it there can no violence be offered.
For whatsoeuer thou thinkest, chastity is not polluted with it, but with the consent of thy minde, that is, whatsoeuer thou feelest in thy flesh, shall not bee imputed to thee for sinne, if thy minde consent not thereunto: for whatsoeuer is sinne must bee voluntarie, and as long as it is not voluntary it is not sinne.
Therefore with howe great temptations soeuer thou art oppressed, nay though thy flesh doo seeme to bee ouerwhelmed with them, and thy senses as prisoners vnto them, yet whatsoeuer thou feelest delightfull to thy flesh, keepe thy minde free, (that is, thy reasonable will) and then nothing can hurt thee· Cry out with the detestation of thy soule against them, and with a voyce that doth abhorre them, fie, fie, will not, will not.
Turne vnto me with all the force thou art able, and repeate often this short sentence.
my God helpe mee; mercifull Iesus will not yeelde vnto them, helpe mee.
Moreouer, though most lothsome and horrible temptations doo creepe into thy minde, yet for all that bee not thou dismaide; as they creeped in, so let them creepe out, and by that gate wherein they did enter, let them depart, and let not them onely out themselues, but carry out with them any thing that is naught, and vnclean within thee, that they may leaue thy house swept and cleansed.
And this thou maiest easily doo, if thou wilt enter into a deepe consideration to knowe thy selfe, and call vpon me onely with a firme confidence, and with a great humilitie, neither seeking to spare thy selfe, nor ceasing to persecute thine enemies.
For it is a most present remedie against all inclinations, to remember as soone as euer thou shalt finde an euill inclination in thy minde, how thou art nothing, and hast nothing of thy selfe but by my grace onely, and how vnpossible it is for thee, with any abilitie of thine owne, to resist these motions, and therefore presently to flie vnto mee with all thy hart, and to seeke aide and protection from my wounds which suffered for thy sake, and at the sight whereof, the auntient enemie of mankind doth yet quake tremble.
Beleeue me (my daughter) although thou be haunted as much as is possible for thee with carnall thoughts, sensuall motions, violent cogitations imaginations, and although thou feele in this behalfe as much as may bee deuised, yet as long as reason hath the vpper hand, and doth gainesay them, and as long as thy reasonable and deliberate will doth not make choise of them, thou hast neither lost charitie nor my grace.
This distresse which thou doost sustaine, and these streights, whereinto my hart is driuen by the meane of this conflict, may be a plaine argument vnto thee, that thou haste not consented vnto them, and so consequently a great comfort to thy minde.
For if thou had dest consented vnto them, that is, if thou haddest willingly felt those thinges which thou diddest feele, if thou haddest willingly retained, those cogitations which did enter into thy minde, thou shouldest not then haue felt this distresse, this combat, and sharpe conflict, but rather all peace and tranquillitie in thy soule.
Receiue a similitude (O my Daughter) at my handes for thy comfort: If any man in fight hand to hande bee ouercome, vanquished, bound, yea and beaten, and although he be so straightly holden, as hee hath not abillitie to vse his owne limmes: yet if he yeeld not himselfe as a prisoner, and vanquished, but resisteth with as much force as hee is able, and consenteth not to this his captiuitie, he can neuer be said to be conquered or ouercome.
In like manner thou shalt neuer be iudged of me to be ouercom, whether thou bee tempted of the flesh or the diuell, except thou consent with thy minde, and ceasest to resist them.
Thou must feele many thinges, which thou oughtest not to consent vnto, that is, which thou oughtest not to feele with thy good will, and with a certaine delight.
But thou wilt say, it is very paineful be in continuall fight, it is paineful to those things which thou it is painefull not to thinke of things wherein thou delightest, is painefull to persecute those things thou louest.
my Daughter, dost consist of two parts, that is, the flesh, and of the spirit, and thy desires bee diuers: and those which delight the flesh are to the spirit.
If it seeme painefull the flesh to offer violence to it selfe, it cannot hate it selfe; let the spirite let the spirite haue the royall and imperiall authoritie thee, and shee will not thinke it paine to bring her enemie, that is, flesh vnder her yoake and
That which seemeth at the first auy, and almost intollerable, by vse of fighting commeth to be light, and may well bee endured: For the oftner that thou resistest thy enemie, thou art the stronger, and he the weaker.
For doost thou not knowe that the kingdome of heauen suffereth violence, and that the violent beare it awaie? Fight therefore manfullie the oftner, and the more stoutlie that thou dost doe it, the more easie shalt thou euer finde it.
Remember also, that as the temptation shal end, so the fight shall not alwaies continue, and that an eternall crowne of glorie which is due to the conquerour doth remaine for thee.
The sharper thy fight is, the more glorious thy crowne of victorie shall be.
And therefore if thou ouercommest beeing tempted, thou shalt haue a double reward, whereas if thou haddest neuer been tempted, thou shouldest haue receaued but a single.
Moreouer the sharplier that thou are assaulted with the temptation of sinne, the shalt thou be purged from thy snes, if thou dost not consent vnto it.
And although in this conflict, especially when a heauy temptation doth furiously rage in thy flesh, there are many veniall sinnes wont to bee committed, (which are giuen as light woundes to those that fight) yet notwithstanding, that paine which is endured by continuing still in fight, by resisting of mortall sinnes, doth on the contrary part take away all that paine which the veniall sinnes do deserue.
Beside, that charitie wherewith thou fighting for my sake dost auoide mortall wounds, and takest great paine in striuing for vertue, doth not onely heale thy lesser wounds, but also doth turne them to thy greater glorie and reward, if thou shalt perfectlye ouercome these temptations as the skars of a Souldiers wounds, which hee receaued by fighting manfullie in a moste fierce battaile, are shewed, after the victorie to his great honor, the sharper the battaile was, the greater is his glory.
Feare not therfore my daughter if thou art to fight long, or if thy temptation doe continue forcible, if thou canst not preuaile so farre ouer thy sensuality, as to make it in al things subiect to thy reason, yet alwaies resist it, neuer giue it place, neuer graunt it peace nor quietnesse.
Thy battaile against it, the conflict which thou diddest endure in resisting of it, will esteeme as a victorie and conquest ouer it: For it is not onlie good to ouercome euill, but with all thy might to resist euill, yea it is sometime more honourable and profitable for thee, by continuing in fight to sustaine longer the assaults of thine enemie, and the labour of the conflict, then quickly to haue vanquished him, espeacially when it is done by my prouidence (which disposeth of all, euer for the best towardes those that loue mee) and not by thy owne slouth or negligence: For who am a most vpright and wise iudge, do marke the trauaile and force of euery one of my Souldiers, and do more esteeme in them, their will, then their abillitie: because to be able to conquere, proceedeth of my gift, but to be willing to conquere resisteth in their owne choyse, and yet not that neyther without my grace.
Wherefore although my grace must of necessitie assist you in both, yet it resisteth more in your owne choyse to bee willing to doe well, then to be able to doe well, which considering (O my Daughter) doo better allow in thee a will to doe much, then abillitie to performe much.
It is also both meet and agreeth with iustice, that the longer thou fightest, and the more paine thou takest, thou shouldest receaue the larger reward, and not onlie a reward in the life to come, but euen here grace for grace, that is, for euerie good worke which you doe by my grace, you shall receaue a rewarde, and some benefit or other by my gracious fauour in this present world.
TAke a special care, that thou beest not an occasio~ of thyne own tation, or destruction, in giuing thyne enemie by thine owne fault, opportunitie to assault thee, and abilitie to ouerthrow thee.
For auoyding whereof, flye prouocations of temptation, restraine thy senses from wandering, shun the familiaritie priuate friendship both of men and women, whereby sometime the diuell doth finde an oportunitie to tempt thee, vnder the colour of deuotion or spirituall loue.
For these thinges for the most part, do leaue behinde them grieuous temptations, of doubtfull suspitions, perturbations, distractions, or els some scandals of violent loue and affection.
If thy enemie which sought to take thy life stood at thy doore, wouldest thou suffer him to come in? How quickly and carefully wouldest thou shut and barre the gates against him? Now these carnall and vicious imaginations, cogitations, and affections, doe seeke by all meanes to enter into thy heart, and to destroy the life of thy soule, writ thou then let him come in? Doe not suffer them to enter: driue not me away, but keepe them out of thy house by force, and with a horrible detestation of them.
Turne thy hart vnto mee, and if thou feele any thing in thy flesh, turne thy hart away from it.
Punish thy fleshe when it waxeth proude, or wanton, with abstinence: temperance both in meate and drinke.
Cut off all accesse of persons, all haunting of places, and all taking of any occasions whereby thou perceauest thy selfe to be tempted.
And beware aboue all thinges, that thou yeelde not thine own members so farre to iniquitie, as that the diuell doe make them instruments of iniquitie, and so by thy negligence take oportunitie to wound thee with thine owne weapons.
And therfore correct the pride of thy flesh with such straight discipline, and bridle it with so great modestie, and bashfulnes, that euen for verie feruent loue of shame fastnes, and chastitie, thou mayest scarce presume to see or touch any naked part of thy handes or feet.
And for al vncleane cogitations, which shall chaunce to bee still vppon thee, driue them out as it were one nayle with an other, by some Godly meditation, and imprinting in thy minde some holy impression of my life and passion.
For to thinke of my woundes, and passion, dooth euer yeelde without all doubt, a continuall and wonderfull encrease of vertue.
For if haue infused into hearbes, stones, and rootes, rare vertues to expell many diseases of the body, how vnspeakable, and how effectual vertu haue giuen to my wounds and passion (as thou thinkest) for expelling of spirituall diseases, and both curing and of the soule.
IF filthie and vncleane thoughts as it often happeneth doo at sometime enter into thy minde against mee and my Saints, or els that thou be tempted with blasphemie, rebellious cogitations, let it neuer henceforth trouble thee, nor yet make thee faint haterd, neyther bee thou perplexed in thy minde with thinking howe to make thy confession of anye such matter, as long as thou dost not with aduised and deliberate consent yeelde vnto them.
For they carrie with them more griefe than delight, and thou rather sufferest, than doost those thinges beeing for that time altogether in passio~ nothing in action.
Wherefore hee that carrieth a pure minde need not eyther to feare them or confesse them, for although a Godlie minde may seeme to bee by this meane a little polluted, yet is it not defiled by hir own fault and negligence.
And therefore such thinges as these which procure great heauines to a deuout heart, and my Spouse (because shee is enforced to feele within hir selfe, and to bee turmoyled with such filthie and abhominable and cogitations against mee, as those which bee the greatest sinners doo abhorre) are rather an affliction and purgation vnto her, then anye defiling or pollution of her.
For the Diuell whilest hee seeth thee withdrawne from all other thinges whatsoeuer, and onely to thirst after me, doth endeuour to trouble this quiet peace of thine, and to hinder and to keepe thee from beeing vnited vnto mee, by these fancies which seeme both odious and horrible.
VVherefore the more holye that the day is, the more earnestly thou dost bend thy selfe to the exercise of diuine actions, the more thou doost seeke to lift vp thy hart, and the more vehementlye that thou dost striue tite thy self wholy vnto me, the more violently, wickedly importunately do these imaginations assault thee, beeing stirred vp eyther by the Diuell, or by some timerous fearefulnes of thy owne, because as soone as thy soule doth begin to abhorre and feare a thing, she doth presentlye feele and finde the same which she feareth, or for which shee is afraid.
For feare and faint hartednesse doth quickliest thrust into a mans minde that imagination which is feared.
And the Diuell also doth raise these perturbations and motions within thy soule, that whilest thou art busied in seeking to resist them, thou mayest bee from feeling the sweet taste of my charitie, or els, being too much dismayed with them, thou mayest bee afraid, and not presume to approch vnto me.
The Diuell doth this, because hee delighteth to entangle thy minde with scruples, and perturbations, and by them to hinder the Saboth of thy quiet rest.
But do not regard them, doo not feare them, doo not answere them, doo not resist them, do not obserue them, but goe forwarde in thy Godly deuotion, and Holy exercise, as though thou felt nothing, and as though thy mind were troubled with nothing, and passe ouer all these filthie cogitations, as the barking of a Curre, or the hissing of a Goose, to which a man will disdaine to make an answere, and will not stay either to contend or striue with them, but onelie passe by them, and laugh at them.
In dooing thus, thou shalt easily auoide quickly forget them.
But if thou seeke to resist them, to dispute with them, to feare them, to regard them, to harken vnto them, and to remooue them, thou shalt still the more deepely imprint them in thy minde, and the more dangerously intangle thy selfe with great perturbation.
For these temptations are not vanquished by fighting with them, but by contemning of them.
Take heede also that no temptation on ouercome thee by importunity, by making thee weary to resist it, for this is an vsuall practise of the Diuell to vexe some with so long and troublesome a temptation that hee ouercommeth those by tyring them with that wicked deuise of his, whome hee could neither deceiue by subtlety, nor intise by pleasure.
Wherefore thou hast neede to bee long suffering, constant, and patient, as thou oughtest to detest those wicked cogitations, which are throwne into thy minde by the craft of the Diuell against my honour, and are brought in of purpose to seduce thee; so thou mayest in no sorte either mislike or seeke to shun that affliction which send vnto thee nor those heauy troublesome burthens which thou feelest by my will and prouidence laide vppon thee, nor yet that paine which thou takest in any conflict, when thou striuest to resist vice and iniquitie, but thou oughtest for my sake to beare them patiently, and without any grudging.
Of this also am to warne thee, that if thou be tempted with any carnall vices, as gluttony and concupiscence, thou mayest more easily vanquish the by flying them, then by fighting with them; but on the contrary part, all spirituall vices are euer ouercome, not by slightly passing ouer them, but by staying with good consideration vpon them, and dooing the contrary of that to which they allure thee.
For the temptation of pride is neither any whitte diminished nor yet vanquished, by flying all occasions that may any way mooue thee to humble thy selfe, that is, by flying all the meanes that may procure humility in thee, in hope by that course to abate the force, and auoide the motions of that temptation.
But if thou wilt ouercome it, stay aduisedly vpon it, enforce thy selfe to doo those thinges that may humble thee.
Thou shalt after the same sort ouercome enuy, if presently and violently, as it were in spight of her, thou dost those thinges from which shee dissuadeth thee; that is, if thou speakest to thy brother, if thou seekest to do him seruice, if thou dooest humble thy selfe vnto him.
In like manner also, thou shalt neuer conquer slothfulnes by flying all trauaile, or by neglecting the diuine honouring and seruing of mee, and by seeking to withdraw thy selfe, that thou mightest not be commanded to labour and take paines, but by enforcing thy selfe with all thy might, and by applying wholly of thy minde to practise and performe deuout and vertuous exercises.
BEware of enuie as much as possibly thou canst, that by it thou bee not brought to mislike with any man, to speake in derogation of him, to preferre thy selfe before him, to molest and vexe him, and to bee also thy selfe vexed, (if hee be preferred before thee) with his vertue, with his honour, with his commendation, or with his spirituall profite.
To ouercome his temptation, be more curteous and lowlie vnto him (my daughter) then to another, speake nothing of him thy selfe, nor heare him spoken of in his absence, neither yet let any thing proceed from thee in word deede, or shew, that may seeme to sauour of enuie, or to spring from that venemous roote.
SHewe not in thy conuersation with others, any sad or vnquiete countenance, but a curteous kinde of behauiour, lest thy conuersation seeme troublesome or vnpleasaunt vnto them.
Beware of being singuler, and vsing any particular fashion by thy selfe, different from the rest in any vnnecessarie ceremonie, acte, or shewe of deuotion, when thou art in other mens companie, as for those points which are profitable for thy soule, which thy calling and christian profession requireth at thy hands, and which are necessarie, either for obtaining of vertue or auoiding of sinnes.
Feare not to be singuler in them, conforme not thy selfe in those to other mens fancies, if they be carelesse of their owne saluation: but rather resolue for the benefit of thine owne soule, the obtaining of vertue, and the fulfilling of my good pleasure, constantly, humbly, and patiently, to beare all their derisions, and persecutions for the same.
Of the honour, reuerence, and worship which we ought to exhibite vnto the Mother of God.
SAlute my Mother often and zealously, with thy feruent praiers, and honour her euer with all reuerence, a principall deuotion by seeking dilligentlie to imitate both her life and her vertue.
For gaue her to this world as a perfect example of sanctetie, innocencie, and puretie, as a singuler Patronesse, and most safe refuge for all my seruaunts, and as a Sanctuarie of so great freedome to all those which are in miserie and tribulation; as no man might haue cause to mislike it, no man might feare to take it, nor yet be in doubt to approch vnto it, and to that ende made her so meeke, so vertuous, so mercifull, so gentle, and so gracious as shee might despise no man, denie her aid to no man, but euer lay open her bosom of pitty before all men, not to suffer any man to depart from her sad, nor without consolation.
made her also gratious, amiable, worthy to bee beloued, and after a wonderfull sort most sweete and delightfull, to those which otherwise were desperate and obstinate sinners, that shee might bee a meete baite for my hooke to catch all soules, but specially such as could by no other mean bee taken, For those heynous sinners which breake out of all other nets, for whom cannot find an apt course by any other waie to draw them vnto me: vse to catch by her meane, that is, by the veneration of her, theyr deuotion towards her, whom make taste most sweet in their harts, and excite those which are hard harted toward me, to performe good works vnto her, that is, acts of veneration, deuotion, confidence, and inuocation, and by this meane, make them vessels fitter and worthier to receiue my grace, and greater illumination from me, vntill they attaine to a more reformed, for the most part, a most holy course of life.
Recommende thy selfe daylie therefore vnto her protection, that by her help thou maist greater grace and fauour at my hands.
For committed vnto her custodie the whole treasure of my grace and mercie, to be distributed and bestowed, when recommended vnto her all my sonnes in the person of Iohn as her sonnes, but specially sinners, for whome did at that present suffer.
This she knoweth verie well, and therefore is so carefull and dilligent to discharge the office shee receiued from mee, as shee suffereth none of those (as farre as lieth in her power) which were committed vnto her, and principallie such as call vppon her to perish, but preferreth them vnto mee both with her earnest praiers, and by all the other meanes shee is able, that they may be reconciled vnto me, and again into my fauor? dost thou think (then my daughter) that could haue chosen any more fitte, and more meete for this busines? Could haue founde any that had beene so apt and able euery way to haue discharged this office? Dost thou thinke that such as be sorrowfull, desolate, and ouerwhelmed with their sinnes, will desire any other mediatour for them vnto mee, which may sue more faithfully in their behalfe, and bee more graciouslie enclined to receiue them, and more ready to bring them vnto me, then this woman, this most humble, most pittifull, most meeke, and most louing virgin, abounding with all sweetnes mercie, beeing most mighty of her selfe to relieue sinners, and most acceptable vnto mee because shee is my mother, yea, euen his mother whose wrath is to bee pacified and appeased towards them? Alasse, howe farre doo they erre? how great a burthen of wilfull obstinacie, and perdition doo they heape vppon their owne backes, which doo mutter and murmure against this holie Virgin, which hath the custodie and bestowing of my graces, and will not acknowledge her for an aduocate vnto me as am to my father? Dost thou thinke that they can by any meanes throw themselues more headlong into the bottomlesse pitte of hell, then by making her their enemie (for whose sake haue so often spared the world, and so often forborne to powre my wrath vppon men) that when there is none to be a mediator for them, or to withholde my hande which is readie bent to punish them, may without any let or impediment strike them as often and as much as will? But what greater paine or punishment can lay vppon these men, then not to chasten them temporally here as children, but to deliuer them ouer as my enemies into a reprobate sence, that they being blinde may not see into what danger they runne, vntill they finde them selues drowned in perpetuall darkenes, and ouerwhelmed with eternall destruction.
doo vse these exhortations vnto thee, as vnto my spouse of meere loue and good will, that being instructed by my spirit, thou maist not decline either in this or in any other matter whatsoeuer, be it neuer so small, from the decrees and resolution of doctrine, which my holie Catholique Church hath determined and resolued vpon, nor yet suffer thy selfe to be deceiued by that wicked and malignant spirit of theirs, which pretende in show to bee followers of the Gospell, and are in truth nothing lesse.
IF thou findest not sensible deuotion, be not therefore grieued nor deiected in thy soule, but doo with a stoute and constant minde (although thou feelest it drie and barren) whatsoeuer thou knowest to be for my honour, and as much as thou art able to performe in that behalfe.
There are manye which shedding teares doe seeme to haue some spirituall deuotion, and sweeet taste in their soule, and yet their life is neuer a whitte the holier, nor themselues at that time free from mortall sinne, but it proceedeth from a certaine tendernesse of their hart, as is often seene in women, and also in men, that be by nature passionate and full of compassion.
Haue no confidence therefore in that deuotion which doth not better amende thy life· Thou shalt see some weepe often, and be sorrowfull for the death of a valiant Captaine, whose worthie and famous actes, they haue onely read, though hee were a Gentile or a Pagan.
They will weepe also sometime if they reade a parting, or a pittifull death of two constant louers.
What wonder is it then if they weepe at my most holie and deuoute seruice, by seeing manie patheticall things done in the worshipping of me, or by taking compassio~ of those things which did suffer for them, or by reioycing at that honour which is done vnto me, and yet these teares proceed from a naturall passion of their hart, without any vertuous intentio~ or profitable frute to their soule, as long as they doo not my will, and fulfill my commandement? If therefore thou findest my hart hardened and barren, without such deuotion, endeuor thou to haue another kinde of deuotion, which is a true, perfect, and readie will, with a determined resolution to doo all those thinges which may honour and please mee.
Moreouer, for the want of the other, that is, sensible deuotion, seeke out the true cause and reason, lest perhaps thou hast lost that sweete taste in thy soule, by some dissolute motion, by lightnes, by inordinate loue, or vnmeasurable ioy, or lest thou hast been too much busied with earthly cogitations, or els, lest thou hast polluted thy soule with the spottes of pride, or hast sought to please thine owne fancie, or for some such other vice and offence.
In which case thou oughtest to be rather grieued for the cause of this barrennesse of thy soule, that is, thou oughtest to bee more sorrie for the fault which thou hast committed, then for the deuotion which thou hast lost.
Endeuour to cleaue vnto me, with a good and pure will, seuered from earthly affections, and with a naked and simple vnderstanding, farre from conceauing of needles or vnprofitable matters, and omitte to doo no good thing, that either thou wert accustomed to vse before, or that may tende to my honour, but remaine patient with renouncing of thine owne appetite, and expect my pleasure, with resigning of thy selfe whollie vnto the same.
And although somewhat at sometime doo sodainely breake out of thy sensuall disposition and outward man, or remaine boyling in thy minde, which is not conuenient for thy profession, or els, if there arise any perturbations in thee, if thou sufferest any distresse, if thou bee oppressed with temptations of heauinesse in thy soule, resisting or murmuring, take speciall care, that at the least thy inwarde and reasonable man, beeing subiect vnto mee, continue setled in all tranquillitie, in louing of my commandements, and in labouring to fulfill them.
How wee must prepare our selues when wee come to receiue the blessed Sacrament.
TO speake somewhat by the way of that preparation, which thou oughtest to make, when thou commest to receiue the blessed Sacrament of my precious bodie, am first to aduertise thee, that thou shouldest not bee discouraged, although thou dost not sensiblie feele deuotion in thee, yea, although thou findest thy selfe troubled with horrible tentations, and assaulted with some tedious imaginations, which doo inuade thy minde.
For this sensible deuotion of thy soule is not so necessarie, but rather that reasonable deuotion of thy will, whereby thou dost beleeue well of my Sacrament, and whereby (notwithstanding these blasphemous thoughts which do assaile, and almost ouerwhelme thee) thou maiest be mooued to doo all honour and reuerence to my Sacrament, although it bee against thine appetite, contrarie to thy liking, and repugnant to the sence or opinion of thine owne hart: and lastly, that thou mayest by this inforcing of thy selfe, against thy carnall desire, finde thy will ready prepared with al obedience to honor mee, to giue me thankes, to resigne thy selfe wholy vnto mee, and to subiect thy minde so farre to my liking, as that it may be best contented with that which agreeth most with my plesure.
If thou haste this deuotion (my Daughter) which thy reasonable will may easily commaund and procure in thee, that is, if thou bee sorrie that thou haste euer offended me, and determined neuer to offend me againe, but to endeuour as much as possiblye thou canst in all thinges to obey my will, thou mayest come boldly vnto this Sacrament, thou mayest enter securely into my presence, for neyther reasonable; nor sencible deuotion, neither vertue, nor yet my grace is obtained by flying from mee, but by approching nere vnto me.
Therfore the more sadder, and the more desolate that thou findest thy self (yea, althogh it be at that time, when thou art going to confession, or to receiue my blessed body, the more earnestly veheme~tly excite and enforce thy selfe to proceede in thy good purpose, that thou maiest be made stro~ger in grace, more constant in goodnes, more feruent in loue towards me.
Prouide alwaies that thou carriest with thee a pure intention, a good wil, as said before.
Neither let it trouble thee, if euen in comming to receaue this blessed Sacrament, there doth enter some horror, terror into thy soule, or if thou bee scarce able presently to take and swallow the blessed host, or if thou finde some gawlish kinde of bitternes in thy taste, for these are not certaine signes, that thou camst vnworthyly to it, but thou haste rather cause to mistrust that feare, fainthartednes, and continual custome of trembling, haue procured this imagination in thee, which is strongest of all in women, maketh thee to thinke that thou feelest those thinges indeede, which either thou dreadest to feele hereafter, or thou dost imagine that thou feelest at that present.
But if thou couldest cleane remoue this fainthartednes, fearefull imaginations of thine, thou shouldest with it also cleane expell this difficultie distresse which thou findest in thy minde.
For albeit could deliuer thee from al these perturbations, yet doe permitte, some such distresse as these, to assault thee, and other of my seruauntes, because knowe it is the best meane either to keepe all of you humble, or by humbling of you, to deliuer you from the sinne of pride, which is in women most vsuall.
Bee therefore stout, and carrie a resolute minde, that shaking off all womanish feare, or fainthattednesse, and purging it from those filthie cogitations which doo enter into thee by contemning of them and their perswasions, thou mayest with a quiet minde, and a pure conscience, wholye dedicated to my seruice, desire me, seeke mee, and receaue mee in the blessed Sacrament, which am and will alwaies remaine vnto thee (if the fault be not in thy felfe) a most gratious louer, a most gentle protector, a most mercifull redeemer, a most louing preseruer, and a most faithfull Sauiour.
But because thou maiest be enflamed with a greater reuerence, loue, and desire, toward this blessed Sacrament: assure thee that without all doubt, my body is there sacramentally, deliuered vnto thee, to be receaued vnder the forme of bread.
Wherefore seeing it is the same body, which now carrie glorified in heauen, seeing it is no other, nor anie like vnto it, but euen the verie same, and seeing carrie not a bodie which is dead nor without blood, it followeth of necessitie that together in the same body, there must bee also contained my soul, my blood, my graces, and my vertues: to all which since the world is vnited, that is one person in Trinity, from the two other persons cannot be deuided, but are inseperably vnited, it must also followe, that the whole Trinity is present in this Sacrament, as truly as verily as they are in heauen, though in an other kinde, that is, vnder a sacramentall forme.
The same opinion thou must in like sort haue of the Challice, the new Testament in my blood, consider therefore now with thy selfe, with how great willingnes and desire, thou oughtest to come vnto this Sacrame~t, seeing that thou haste in it true saluation, and that thou hast me really, and perfectly there, which am the author of all thy happinesse.
And because would not haue thee drawne from it, with too much timerousnes of thy conscience, or with too great a feare of the reuerence and Maiestie thereof; haue commaunded thee to come vnto it, and to receiue it for a commemoration of mee, assuring thee, that my delight is to be with the Children of men, and that doe much reioyce when may doe anie of you good, to knocke at the gate of your hartes, that beeing entred may sup with you, and both feede and refresh your hungrie spirite within my selfe.
And to what other ende doo all these thinges, but onely to procure you to haue a hope and confidence in mee, with a loue and desire to come vnto me, and not to withdraw your selues from so profitable and necessary a Sacrament, or to depriue your soules of that infinite and inestimable fruite, which you shall receaue thereby, for feare of beeing made vnwoorthie by these temptations which you feele against your will, and therefore are not by them polluted with any sin.
AS humillitie must bee the guide of all thy exercises, so let discretion rule and moderate them, least they hurt thee, or make thee vnable to do thy dutie, or least the greater benefits and better exercises of thy soule bee hindred by the outwarde exercises of thy body, which are not so good, nor so profitable: and to conclude, least by exercising of any vertuous acte, thou dost somewhat offend in breach of charitie.
Haue consideration also of the infirmitie of thy bodie, and take care that thou consume not thy strength, if thou be weake, and gouerne all thy intents, studdies and exercises by the direction of such as feare me, or are thy superiors, leauing or lessning the~, encreasing or moderating them according to their will and counsell.
Wherefore, if thy superior which hath the charge of thy soule, as beeing my deputie, and discharging of that office in my steede toward thee, forbidde thee to fast, or any other thing that is not in it selfe sinne, obey him, beleeuing that hee knowing thy abillitie euerie waie, doth aduise and commaund thee, to that which may bee fittest and most necessary for thy saluation.
And therefore (my Daughter) if thou be bidden to eate eight times in a day, thou shalt not in obeying it, offende mee: Neuerthelesse, retaine still a will to fast, when thou haste libertie to vse thine owne discreation, But if for obedience sake, thou eate, thou shalt by eating receaue of mee a double reward whereas otherwise by fasting, thou shouldest haue had but he a single.
For thy good will to fast, and the fruit of thy good will is not lost, if thou eatest to shew onlie thy obedience, but beeing done for obedience sake, it is together with obedience crowned, and rewarded in thee.
In like sorte it is in all other thinges, which thou desirest of thine owne will to doe, and art enforced to omitte onelie to shew thy obedience.
Seeke daylie, desire earnestlie, stue continuallie to set foorth and aduance my glorie, as much as thou art able, and wheresoeuer thou canst, to fulfill my will, both in thy selfe and in all other.
Neglect to do no good worke that thou hast· abillitie to performe, but goe forward in goodnes erie day, and striue alwaie to encrese in vertue, but neyther glorie norreoyce in thy selfe for all the trauaile, studie, and exercise which thou vsest in dooing of good workes, neither bee thou comforted with it, as thogh thou haddest any thing, wert any thing, or able to doo any thing of thy selfe, but fixe thine eyes euer vppon thine owne basenes, and imbecillitie, remembring that thou art meerely nothing, but of my grace, and therefore ascribe all the good thou dost to me onely.
There bee some which are not contented with that correction of their flesh which doo lay vpon them, but doo torment their bodies with vndiscrete abstinence, and immoderate afflictions, and make themselues by that meane not onely vnapt, and vnable to obay me, to follow my steps, to endure the conflicts of this spirituall battaile: but also being tyred and consumed in their naturall strength by this vndiscrete dealing, are enforced to leaue those exercises which they were wont to vse before; and to take more care of their flesh, then is requisite or conuenient, for repairing of that which was decayed by their owne follye.
Wherefore moderate thou thy exercises and labours according to the proportion of thy force and abillitie, least thou doost surcharge and ouerthrow thy selfe, and faile not by good meanes to nourish thy body, it is my will, that thou shouldest comfort nature, and repaire from time to time, thine infirmitie, not with an extraordinarie care or delight, but for the refreshing of nature, as saide before.
And for the better inhabting of thy body to doo mee seruice, to yeeld thy selfe a fit instrument of my grace, to fulfill my will, to follow my commandement, to doe those works which are most acceptable in my sight, beeing alwaies as readie if it be my pleasure, to suffer pouertie, as to enioye riches, and as willing to bee sicke as to be whole.
But when thou shalt not bee compelled by discreation to nourish thy bodie for infirmitie of nature, take heed least by impatiency or want of deuotion, or of an insatiable desire to please thine owne appetite, thou seekest euasions to escape, and deliuer thy selfe from those aduersities or troubles which send thee.
But remember to receaue such crosses, as are of my sending gladly, sustaine them patiently, complaine of them to no bodie, beare them with long suffering, and stay with all meekenes expecting of my pleasure.
Suffer mee to deal with thee, as thinke fitte, that by that tribulation that falleth vpon thee, my grace may worke some good effect in thee.
This is much better and more profitable for thee, then that which of thine own head thou layest vpon thy selfe.
For would haue thee to bee fullie perswaded (my Daughter) that neuer permit thee to suffer any tribulation, but that it is for thy good, for the purging and repayring of thy soule, which is weakened or impayred by sin, if thou wouldest beleeue mee, and referre thy selfe wholy vnto mee, by bearing it with silence, waite my leysure by patient suffering thereof, for wil come at the last, who am neuer absent from thee, but am alwaies readie in all places to assist thee.
Beware therefore that thou doost not dispise those afflictions which do sende and lay vppon thee, for will guide thee in them; relie vppon me, trusting in my prouidence, and loue towards thee, and not in thine owne will or abillitie.
Bee content that other men doo afflict thee: in the meane time, doe not thou persecute thy flesh, but thy faults, and endure with patience whatsoeuer shall happen vnto thee.
How we ought in all thinges to conforme our selues vnto Christ.
Faithfull spouse ought to be so louing to her husband, as she should desire with all her hart euer to be with him, neuer without him, and at no time from him, shee should wish to conforme her selfe in all thinges vnto her husbandes minde, and bee glad when shee were in any thing like vnto him.
After the same manner thou must be haue thy selfe.
Consider my life, my actions, my vertues, whereby thou mayest learne what loue, what doth please mee in thee.
Now if thou wilt bee a faithfull spouse, (O soule) thou oughtest to desire nothing so much as to please me, and to frame thy selfe in all things agreeable to my will.
Wheresoeuer therefore that goe, desire to accompanie me, whatsoeuer doo, studdy to imitate mee, whatsoeuer suffer, be readie to suffer with me, and if by any occasion thou feelest tribulation, reioyce in it, because by it, thou art made like vnto me.
Consider and recount with thy selfe euerie one of my vertues, or at the least the principall, whereby thou mayest stirre vp a desire in thy minde to imitate and follow me.
It shall be an easier labour for thee then, to cutte off, and rase out all those things, which are contrarie and vnlike to my course of life, that is, thy vices, thy wicked inclinations, and corrupt affections.
And as saide before, thou shalt attaine to such a habit of wel doing in time by a studious will, a watchfull care, and continuall trauaile, that thou mayest come hereafter to driue away that, (as it were) with one blaste of winde, which thou canst now scarce scrape away with a file of iron.
BEhold therefore first my pouerty, who when was rich made my selfe poore for thy sake: howe came to mine owne, and mine did not receaue me: how was verie poore, and as a stranger soiourner in a forraine land: how my mother beeing lodged in an Inne as a guest in a strange place, was borne in a stable before the mouthes of beasts, which by the heat of their breath might defende mee from the bitter cold, beeing laid vpon haye in a manger: howe was redeemed with the Sacrafice of poore innocents: howe beeing an infant was driuen into banishment, brought vp by the labour of my Mother, and fedde by almes at other folks cost, hauing neyther house nor lodging of mine owne: how watched often in the mountaines: how was spoyled of all my garmentes at the time of my passion, died naked vpo~ the Crosse: beeing in so great want of all thinges, as could not haue a droppe of water in my most extreame thirst, to refresh my dried tongue: Lastly, how after my death was buried in the graue that was made for another.
Moreouer how often dost thou thinke that suffered in the whole course of my life, hunger, cold, thirst, and other vexations of my bodie? and as for corporall consolation (which most men doo thinke very necessarie) refused, and vtterlie reiected is, patiently induring penurie and pouertie in all things.
But thou when thou haste euerie thinge readie at hand, that thou canst desire, thou doost flatter thy selfe, thinkest that thou liuest in pouertie, and doost repyne if thou canst not haue euerie other thinge that thou wantest, although it bee merrilie superfluous, and more to please thy curious minde, then to serue thy necessarie vse. Looke therefore vpon my pouerty, and leaue to be sadde, and cease to be offended, if thou seest any man preferred before thee, or indued with greater aboundance than thy selfe: why art thou not rather greeued like a good emulatresse? if thou see anye man poorer than thy selfe, as (Saint Francis was,) if thou perceauest anye man (which opinion thou oughtest to carrie of all men) more agreeable to my life and pouertie then thy selfe: this should be a good kinde of emulatio~, not to be grieued with other mens happinesse, or for that they are better then thou art, but to bee hartilie sorrie because thou art not good thy selfe, that it proceedeth of thine own fault and negligence.
Reioyce therefore receaue it, for a speciall token of thy grace, for an exceeding benefitte, if make thee more agreeable to my selfe, then other men, by sending thee some greeuous sicknes, some extreame pouertie, miserie, or contempt in this worlde.
And if thou wantest necessarie thinges reioyce, if they be taken away, be glad, and complaine of it to no man, but embrace with me the crosse of pouertie, beeing quiet and contented in thy mind, vsing silence and vtterly renouncing of thine owne selfe.
What doth it profitte thee (my Daughter) if thou haste for my sake forsaken the world, her riches, hir glory, and the comfort of thy friends, art nowe troubled about a thing not worth a straw, or haste not yet abandoned all loue from such vanities as are of no value, but are readie to fight to be vexed, and to contend either for desire to attaine them, or for feare to loose them, and are not afraide in this be halfe, to breake peace and charitie with thy neighbour? Determine therfore nowe, and make a firme resolution from the bottome of thy hart, to contemne all thinges for the loue of me, and bee vnwilling to possesse any thing, but euen such as of necessitie thou art enforced to vse, delighting in all pouertie, contempt, and penurie, that thou mayest be worthie to enioy me, who as am better and more profitable for thee then a thousand worldes; so ought to bee more esteemed, and more dearely beloued of thee, then all earthly things whatsoeuer, Why stayest thou my daughter? be encouraged with my example, bee enflamed with my loue, seeke earnestly in euerie thing that appertaineth to thy selfe, to liue in all want and pouertie.
Moreouer thinke other men worthie of my consolation, because they be my faithfull seruauntes, beeing farre better than thy selfe, and not so vnthankefull as thou art.
And therefore beeing mooued with charitie, and as it were enforced with compassion, suffer no man to want anie thing, that thou may est supplie, but help all men with thy trauaile, thy seruice, thy friendshippe, and by all the other meanes that are within the compasse of thine abillitie.
Whatsoeuer thou haste, thinke it to bee other mens, that neither thou mayest loue it when thou possessest it, nor be grieued when thou loosest it; Whatsoeuer thou dooest enioie, thinke it is giuen thee for other mens vse, and to serue their necessitie.
DEtest and abhorre with all thy hart, the honour, glorie, and fauour of men, with all other flatteries, and inticements of this decaitfull world.
Thinke no otherwise of thy selfe, but as a proude man, vnthankfull to mee, spightfull against me, therefore (if should rewarde thee according to thy deserts) worthie to be hated aboue all creatures, as one vnworthie to bee borne by the earth, to receiue breath by the aire, or to be nourished serued by any of my creatures.
Wherefore aske alwaies at my hands mercie and grace, not relying vpon any worke or merite of thine own, but trusting altogether in that only worke of redemption which finished for thee, and that vnspeakable mercie which shewed towards thee.
Desire of me with teares, sighes perfect humilitie, that by it thou maiest delight to lie hidden vnknown, to bee contemned and had in estimation.
Endeuor as much as thou canst to loue those things which are most vile, and shew greatest humilitie.
Choose likewise both to do and to haue those thinges which are most abiect, and which other men doo most despise, thinking thy selfe more base and lesse worthie, then those thinges that are most vile.
Seeke not to set forth in thy selfe any thing that may sauour of estimation, or glorie, or that may shew as it were anie singuler gift in thee, except thou be enforced to it by necessitie, or of meere charitie for the glory of God.
Glorie in nothing, neyther yet bost thy selfe of any thing that is in thee.
And if any man doe offende or contemne thee, take heed thou be not angrie with him for it, neither vse him with worse countenance in shew, nor beare him lesse good will in thy hart.
But rather meruaile that euerie creature doth not persecute thee to be reuenged of the iuiurie thou doost to me, that am creator both of thee and all them, and whome notwithstanding thou art nothing at all afraide to offend.
TO obtaine humilitie, consider behold my Maiestie, my omnipotencie, my wisedome, my goodnesse, who onlie am immortall, onelie infinite, passing all measure, without all limitation, or circumscription, inspeakeable, incomprehensible, from whome all creatures receaue their being, who am able with a beck, both to bring all creatures and the whole world vnto nothing, and againe presently to restore all things to their former course and order.
Therfore seeing am euerie way of so great power, you may easilie perceaue that created you, which are reasonable creatures, according to mine owne Image, not for necessitie, or for any need that had of you, but of my charitie and goodnes towards you, as persons vpon whome meant to bestowe my benefits, and with whome would impart my felicitie.
From which grace, since you fell by sinne, whereby you made your selues, not onely vnworthie of eternall life, but iustlie deserued eternall fire: beeing incarnate for your sakes, suffered three and thirtie yeares hunger, thirst, cold, heate, miseries, labours persecutions, contempts, reproches, stripes, blowes, wounds, greefes, torments, and lastlie the Crosse, and death it selfe, that might deliuer you from eternall death, which you had incurred by your owne deserts.
liued (my Daughter) in the world not as God, not as a mighty person, nor in a glorious show, but as the poorest, vilest, basest, most contemptible of all others, being subiect to many torments and sundrie reproches, vntill at the last was slain, with a most shamefull and ignominious death, which the world did think had iustly deserued, for they iudged both my life and Doctrine to bee detestable, as they thought it fitte to roote them, both out of all mens memorie, to make them end with my death, whereat a great multitude of people being present, did triumph and reioyce.
Yet went as gladly to suffer it, as the Hart doth to the Fountaines of water, nay being made drunke with my loue towards thee, ranne vnto it, and was neuer well vntill had endured it.
spared not my selfe, neither fledde anie labour, greefe, paine or torment whatsoeuer.
refused to doo nothing that might bee for thy profitte, thou wert so deare and precious in my sight, that did euen long with a desire to deliuer my selfe for thy sake, to be wounded in all parts, with sundrie kindes of torments, and for thy sake also at the last to ende my life with a shamefull death.
Moreouer, because did veheme~tly thirst after thy saluation, desired to shed all my blood for thee, which did in such plentifull sort, as left no one droppe therof remayning within my body.
But how dost thou (O my Daughter) requite me now for all this? what dost thou render againe vnto mee in recompence of so great charitie? Is it not euen thou which beeing vnthankful to me so many yeares, didst despise my selfe, didst not regard my wordes, didst loth my seruice, and didst transgresse my commandements? and yet shewing all reproch towards mee being most vncleane vile in my sight, beeing altogether polluted, with so many filthy abhominations, thou dost banish me from thee, thou dost reiect my inspirations, thou committest fornication with my creatures, thou abusest my gift.
What? why doost thou still contemne and forsake mee, notwithstanding that deliuered thee, out of most heynous sins, and from eternall damnation it selfe (wherein thou haddest iustly layen burning many yeares since, if my mercie had not preue~ted thee.)
To be short, why wilt thou despise me, seeing haue so often preserued thee, from committing of many offences, and also raysed thee out of the bottomelesse gulfe of sin and wickednesse? What? doost thou not yet at length consider, that thou art vile, miserable, and meerely nothing, but by my grace? and how then darest thou lift vp thy vp thy face, to behold mee, whom thou haste so often offended, so long time despised, so sundrie waies contemned? speake these thinges (my Daughter) to the ende that thou shouldest knowe thy selfe.
Consider how vile and filthie, thou art in thy bodie, howe much polluted in thy soule, and howe impure in thy heart.
And lastlye remember, how vncleane thou haste altogether made thy selfe with wicked workes, with filthie cogitations, with corrupt vnpure affections, and yet neuertheles how stil forbeare to punish thee, nay notwithstanding all this, how declare my loue towards thee, with powring my benifits daylie vpon thee, but how long must doe this? till what time must forbeare thee? when wilt thou come to knowe thy selfe? howe long wilt thou stay to returne vnto me? why doost thou not humble thy selfe my yoake? doost thou not see, that am not longer able to my mercies from thee? dost thou not perceiue how haue called thee? in what place haue planted thee? where are thy fruits? dost thou not know how wincke at all thine iniquities, all thine abhominations, al thy vnthankfulnes? Yet speake not these thinges (O my Daughter to vpbraide thee with those benefittes which haue heaped vpon thee, but as it were languishing with looue of thee, and as it were, seeming to stand in neede of thee, (though in deede stande in neede of nothing) yea, beeing as it were not able to liue without thee, doo inuite thee to looue mee againe, for that vnspeakable goodnesse and charitie which haue shewed towardes thee, that by louing mee, thou mayest perfectlye see, what am, and what thou art: howe much haue done for thee, howe iniurious on the contrarie parte, thou haste shewed thy selfe vnto mee for the same.
Moreouer consider, howe manye and innumerable soules are in hell at this day, and how thou haste beene farre more wicked then they, and more iustly deserued that roome, if thou haddest not beene from it by my grace: imagine likewise, that if they had receaued as much grace from mee, as thou haste done, they would haue shewed themselues much more thankfull vnto mee then thou haste beene, If thou considerest all these thinges, that is, my Maiestie, and thine owne basenesse, how proude thou art in thy basenesse, and howe humble was in my Maiestie: howe farre for thy sake abased my selfe to all pouertie and contempt, it would not seeme so great a matter to thee, to humble thy selfe.
If say, thou wouldest rightly ponder with thy selfe, in howe much pouertie, in how abiect estate, and in how great contempt, beeing so mightie, so rich, of so high dignitie, that is exceeding all measure in maiestie, and infinite in goodnesse, and incomprehensible in them both: was content to serue thee so base, and so vile a creature, scarce worthie the name of man; yea, and did it with so great charitie, fidelitie, and desire: there would by the impression of these thoughtes be bred in thy heart, so great an obedience towards mee, so great a reuerence of mee, and so great a desire to serue adore my maiesty, as can neither be expressed in words, nor conceaued in thought.
It would procure moreouer in thee, an insatiable desire, and most burning thirst, to honor me, to worship me, to exalt me, to contemne, humble, and despise thy selfe, and for the loue of me, to throw thy selfe vnder the feete of all my creatures, and beside, patiently to endure reproches, contempt and iniurie, at all their hands.
For though thou doost humble thy selfe neuer so far, though thou bearest neuer so much, yet thou shouldest think that thou haddest endured nothing in respect of the thirst and desire thou feelest in thine owne minde, to abase thy selfe, and exalt mee, in so much that thou shouldest most loue those which did seeke most to oppresse and despise thee, because they did serue in this behalfe, to satisfie thine earnest desire, and thy humilitie, when they sought so much to humble and abase thee.
If thou feelest not (my Daughter) these thinges as yet in thy selfe, acknowledge howe vnthankefull thou art, and howe farre from true humilitie, which is a sincere and lowlie submission of thy heart in the sight of my diuine maiestie.
After which followeth euer a contempt of thine owne selfe; and a will likewise not only to be despised of others, but euen by them to be acknowledged most vile.
exhorte thee once againe (my Daughter,) to looke into my humility, and to take example by it, howe thou shouldest humble thy selfe.
See how the world despised my life, and doctrine, how they did falsely accuse, vtterly reiect me, how they backbited me in all their speeches, how great reproches scorne, contempts, and derisions suffered, euen as a reprobate of most vile persons, and for most vile vnthankfull creatures.
Yet beeing thus mocked, and made most abiect as a scorne of all men, yet despised no man, neither did excuse my selfe, nor any way sought in speech to resist or reprooue them.
Recounte also with thy selfe (O vnthankfull creature, which art worthie to be despised) thine owne obstinacie, negligence, sinnes, ingratitude, inconstancie, vilenesse, lastly, how thou art nothing of thy selfe, but by my grace onely.
Bewaile, lament, and excuse thy selfe of all these before me with continuall teares.
Whatsoeuer shall happen vnto thee, turne it to thine owne benefite, and vse it as a meane to make thee humble.
Take heed that thou takest not pleasure in thy selfe, but rather wonder how thou canst please or delight any other, if they did rightly know thee.
Euer fixe the eyes of thy heart vppon the consideration of thine owne weakenes, and disabilitie in all respects.
Consider how thou art nothing, what thou oughtest to be and art not.
Likewise what thou haste not, how vnable thou art to doe any good: how many things thou wantest; and to bee short, how farre thou art from true perfect charitie: from the perfection of a holie mans life.
Call to minde also how vnlike, and how liittle agreable thou art vnto me, and remember that meerely, thou haste no good thing at al of thy selfe, but receauest all good thinges from me onely, without any other meane whatsoeuer.
Moreouer make account that thou haste of thy selfe these thinges, and no other at all; that is, an apt inclination to sin, to offend to rebell, to stand in need of all good things, to be in necessitie and miserie, and by thine own fault both to loose ouerthrow all those blessinges graces which bestowed vpon thee.
For it is most certaine, that if should leaue the nature of man, to her own libertie, to doe that whereunto she is most inclined: she would do no good at all, but decline euerie day from worse to worse, seeing shee runneth so vehementlie headlong nowe to commit wickednesse: notwithstanding, that doe so earnestlie forbid her, and in a manner violentlie withold her.
For the nature of man is nothing, and hath nothing of her selfe, and laboureth after that which is nothing.
If thou diddest continuallie meditate vppon this, it would helpe thee verie much for procuring of humilitie.
There must bee a so notwithstanding ioyned vnto this, an other kinde of humiliation, for thy hidden and vnknowne imperfections, which for the most parte are verie grieuous, although thou beeing purblinde doost not perceiue them.
Fall therefore prostrate for these before the feete of my mercie, bewaile from thy hart, thy incureable aptnes, and infirmitie to commit sinne neyther thinke euer otherwise of thy selfe, then of one that is guiltie of manie faults, blind many thinges, and most vnthankfull of all creatures.
TRouble not thy mind with imagining what men thinke of thee, nor what censure they giue of thee, neyther yet feare their iudgment, so long as thou doost not wittinglie (as farre as lyeth in thy power) giue them any scandall or occasion iustlie to reprehend or backbite thee.
For thou art neyther the better if they commend thee, nor the worse if they dispraise thee.
But thou art in truth as account thee, and as thou shewest to be in my sight.
Therefore let not the commendation of any other reioyce thee, nor yet their dispraises grieue thee.
For what doost thou gaine by the commendation of others? nothing truelie: But it dooth rather manie times greatly hurt thee, because it deceaueth thee, and puffeth thee vp with pride and vanitie: And on the contrarie parte, what can the contemptes, reprehension, abasing, backbiting, condemnation, and persecution of men hurt thee? Truelie nothing at all, but rather they prositte thee much, for they bring thee to know thy selfe, and helpe thee not a little, to obtaine humilitie of life, and amendment of thy manners.
For by it thou shalt bee made more wary and wise, in thy conuersation with men, not to trust in them, but to put all thy confidence in me.
The iudgment of men therefore is not much to be cared for, whether they speak good or euill of thee: Let them thinke what they will, in the meane time lift thou vp thy hart vnto me, and if by searching euerie secret corner of thy hart, thou findest nothing in it that may offend mee, feare nothing, but if by this examination thou findest somewhat, wherein thou haste offended me, bewaile thy fault, not because men do despise thee, (for thou oughtest then iustly both to suffer and desire that) but because thou haste offended me, and also giuen other men by thine example occasion to sinne.
But if any thing bee commended or dispraised in thee, which is not sinne, bee not otherwise or more mooued therewith, then if some other man were commended or dispraised.
If men praise thee, ascribe it to their error and good will towardes thee: if they reprooue thee, or condemne thee, meruaile not at it.
For what meruaile is it, if men reprooue, dispise, and condemne thy life, seeing they also reprooued my life, and condemned all my Doctrine, which was most innocent, voyde of all spotte, and which could by no meanes bee iustly reprehended.
Reioyce rather, that thou art come to walke in those steppes, which had trode~ before, that is, if being humbled and accounted as a caste awaie of all men, and bee glad that thou sufferest these persecutions of men.
Let others imagine mischiefe against thee, will returne their mischiefes to thy benefitte: onely endure thou all patientlie, and be silent.
Studdie in all thinges to please me, and not men: and yet if thou chancest to please men, thinke that they are deeeiued in their opinion of thee: because they know thee not as wel as do, but do iudge thee thorough their owne simplicitie, according to that apparaunce of goodnesse which they see in thy outward show.
But if thou dost displease them, impute it to thine owne deserts, let it make thee more humble, for if they doe despise thee for so little faults, as they are able to see in thee, what would they doe, if they sawe as perfectly as I, all thy sins and offences? Delight therefore to be accounted vile contemptible, though thou bee despised neuer so much, yet thinke that thou deseruest to be a great deale more despised then thou art.
Thou oughtest to account thy selfe most miserable, most vnworthy, most vnthankefull, and most needing my grace and mercie, of all other creatures, remembring alwaies that of thy self thou art meerely nothing, and that all thy workes which are without mee, neither sauour any thing of vertue, nor yet are any thing worth.
Whosoeuer is most wicked, thinke him better, and more worthy of heauen then thy selfe.
Beleeue that other men doo merite, thinke that thou art tollerated here by my mercie onely.
Presume not therfore in these respects, to compare thy selfe with any man, but imagine that thou hast offended mee more then all men, and that thou art more vile and vnthankefull to me, then any creature that liueth: because whatsoeuer is of thy selfe, either is nothing at all, or els is sinne.
Wherefore to extoll or magnifie thy selfe, by the meane of those gifts, which thou hast whollie receiued from me is intollerable, and a point of most arrogant pride, For the preuenting whereof, and for thy greater profit, doo often withdrawe from thee my sensible blessinges, because thou knowest not howe to vse them, but abuse them, in turning them onely to the magnifiyng of thy selfe, whereas in truth thou oughtest to challenge or ascribe nothing to thy selfe, but wholy attribute all vnto mee.
Take heede therefore that in the petitions which thou makest vnto me, thou hast no respect to thy selfe, but to me onely, lest thou shewe thy selfe vnthankefull towards me by pride, or detestable in my sight by thine owne negligence.
Remember how thou art nothing of thy selfe, how quick lie thou art vanquished, when doo not protect thee: and consider how thou art not able to endure the smallest aduersitie, or ouercome the weakest temptation, when fight not for thee.
For of thine owne abilitie thou haste no other power in the worlde, but onelye to corrupt and pollute what good thing so euer bestow vpon thee.
Thou art too apt (my Daughter) to dispraise other men, which is a token without doubt of great arrogancie, as though thou wert worthie to bee preferred before those which, thou so discommendest, because thou perhaps wantest that vice, whereof thou accusest them, and yet are subiect to many other.
If thou wert not blind, thou mightest perceaue that thou deseruest not by this kinde of dealing, in any sort to be preferred before them: but rather thine owne tongue maketh thee more detestable then they, because it discouereth openly, thine arrogancie or enuie.
My friends are wont to reprooue, accuse themselues of their own vices, and not to finde fault with others: for they suspect both their workes, themselues, neyther will they trust themselues in anie thing, because they haue bin by that meane so often deceaued.
For they alwaies that they seeke not me with such sinceritie as they ought, Beside they wonder at, and commend other mens workes, for they will not be brought to suspect any euill of their neighbours.
Therefore doo thou alwaies either praise or excuse others, or els say nothing at all, hauing euer before thine eyes, onely thine owne vilenes, and vnthankefulnesse, and wondring that all men doo not reprooue and detest thee.
Thou canst not (my Daughter) obtaine humilitie, except thou loue to be humbled, for it is of necessitie that a mind disposed to be humbled, must euer goe before humilitie.
Receaue therefore all things which send vnto thee, as meanes to humble thee.
Delight also to bee humbled and contemned of others: Suffer thy good name to be slandered.
Hold thou thy peace, and referre thy cause vnto mee.
know better than thou doost how to defend thy good name.
But if thou fightest for thy selfe, thou needest not my protection.
If thou dost with humilitie and patience, beare all, and be silent: will choose a time wherin will answere for thee.
Doe not thou by defending of thy selfe, preuent my gracious determination towardes thee.
will fight for thee, and will haue thee to bee patient and silent.
OBedience, is a most excellent vertue, and most acceptable vnto me, that worke which in it selfe is vilest, least of all others (if it be done merily for obedience only) it is better accepted of me, and more profitable meritorious vnto him that dooth it: then infinite others, which men doo voluntarie, and to please their owne appetite.
Neither canst thou offer vnto me (beleeue me my Daughter) a more Noble and woorthie Sacrifice, then to present mee with an humble hart, obedient and readie, to doo all thinges that shall command.
For it may so fall out, as a man by obedience only, may cleaue, leaue, and forsake him selfe for my sake, and so profitte more, by denying of his own will, and bee mo~re inwardly vnited vnto mee, then if hee had bestowed much time, in other most noble exercises.
Wherefore thou oughtest (my Daughter) to be alwaies as obedient vnto me, as if were euer present with thee in a corporall forme, and that thou didst as continually enioy my presence, as a wife doth her husband, with whom she dwelleth.
When anie man shall call thee from mee, to doo some acte of obedience, thou oughtest to leaue me, obey him.
For this is not a forsaking of mee, but a forsaking of thy selfe: because thou preferrest my honour and my will, before thine owne commoditie and consolation, in that thou doost according to my commaundement deny thy selfe, and seekest not thine owne commodity, but the benefitte of others.
In this sort shouldest thou relinquish thy selfe, and all care to please thy selfe, or to seeke thine owne commoditie.
For so shouldest thou not leaue me, but find that which is a hundred times more worthie and profitable for thee then those thinges which thou forsakest.
Learne therefore to leaue thy selfe for my sake, that is, by denying of thine owne will, to want that fruite, that consolation, and that profitte which thou desirest to reape, for by dooing thy duty in this sort, both thou honourest me, and not onely loosest nothing in thy profitte: but also obtainest thinges (though it bee by an other meane) that are an hundred timies better.
Wherefore esteeme nothing so precious, neyther account thou any thing so profitable, as that thou wilt not bee drawne from it willingly, for obedience sake, with a minde wholie resigned to my pleasure.
For whatsoeuer the thing bee that for the loue of it, either thou refusest to performe thine obedience, or commest to doo it grudgingly, or vnwillingly, it is the Idoll of thine owne appetite: more pernitious to thee, than can be expressed.
If thou be in a place where thou haste no superiour, or where thy selfe is superiour; make all men thy superiours, obeying their will, and forsaking thine owne.
Marry doo it not of slouthfulnes, but wheresoeuer thou mayest euen of thine owne desire, and of purpose to renounce thy selfe for my sake.
Looue the vertue of obedience from the bottome of thy hart, and leaue it not as long as thou liuest, not onlie to thy superiours but also yeeld, obey, and subiect thy selfe, (whensoeuer thou art not restrained by my will) in all thinges, and to all men for my sake, and that without beeing grieued with it, repyning at it, and disputing about it.
And because thou mayest do this the more franckly, respect not the man, who by my ordinance is thy superiour, whether he be learned or meet for the office; neyther seeke to marke or consider, whether he be learned or vnlearned, an excellent man, or a base person.
But haue regarde to this onely, that he is by my prouidence made thy superiour, by whome will gouerne thee, and in whome thou oughtest to heare me.
Therefore resist not but yeeld to this my prouidence, seeing if appoint such a man, haue as much care to rule thee, and to make thee subiect vnto mee by the meane of so simple a person, as by him that is learned: Yea, haue the like regarde of thy well dooing, by any whomesoeuer it shall bee my pleasure to appoint ouer thee.
Wherefore would haue thee subiect thy selfe vnto him, without any seruile feare, or scruple of thy conscience, and despysing thine owne counsaile, and wisedome.
Submit thy selfe to bee gouerned by his iudgement and opinion.
Whatsoeuer hee shall determine or appoint thee, accept it from his mouth as from mine owne.
For place such superiours ouer my seruaunts sometime, as haue small learning, are little practised in those execises, to the end that they should not regarde mans wisedome, or respect in the man himselfe: but rather me in the man, that am their God, and as well able to answere them by a simple man (if they can haue faith and confidence in me) as by a learned.
And therefore, whatsoeuer they shall be aunswered, or howsoeuer they shall bee counsayled at his hande, let them receaue it, not as from a man, but as from my selfe, attributing all to me and my direction: and ascribing nothing to the man, whether hee bee wise or simple.
If thou wouldest not therfore go astray, walke in the path of obedience, and doo nothing at all without the counsaile of thy Pastor or Ghostly Father, or superiour.
Liue alwaies in simplicitie and pouertie of spirite, renouncing quite thine owne Iudgment, thine owne counsaile, thine owne sense, and thine owne opinion, neyther take any occasion at anye time to complaine or murmure, esteeming that alwaies best which thy superiour, or (if thou haste none) what other shall thinke fittest, as long as it is not manifest and apparant sinne.
And therefore fullie to mortefie and kill in thy selfe thine owne will, thou shouldest not onely be obedient vnto men, but also subiect thy selfe vnto all my creatures for my sake.
For thou oughtest so much to hate thine owne will, and thou shouldest so much desire to extinguish it, that thou shouldest liue amongst menne wheresoeue thou beest, euen as if thou wert cleane without any will of thyne owne; that is, as if thou madest no election or choyse of anye one thinge more then an other, but accepted of all things indifferentlie, that chanced vnto thee, excepting this onely, that an other mans will (if thou knowest it) muste euer please thee better than thine own, so that it be without sinne. and that honestie and discretion bee obserued in it.
Yeelde therefore vnto all men in those thinges which doo properlie and onelie belong vnto thy selfe, in such sort as if thou haddest professed obedience to them all.
Nay, whensoeuer thou shalt bee alone, doo not thine owne will, but dispose of thy selfe so, as thy whole course of life, and all thy exercises may tend to the renouncing of thy selfe.
For this shall bee better and more profitable vnto thee than the ioyes of Paradise.
And whensoeuer that my wil shalbe made knowne vnto thee, whether it bee by inward inspiration, or by the Scripture, or by thy superiour, or by some other creature of mine, or by any other meanes what soeuer: Whensoeuer also that thou shalt bee inwardlie admonished by me, straight despise al that thou haste of thy selfe, as thine owne counsaile, thine own iudgment, thine owne thine owne opinion, thine own liking, or thine owne inclination, and follow my will.
But thou must haue a speciall care wiselie to learne what my will is, least thou may est thinke that thou art gouerned by my spirite; when in truth thou art directed by thine owne, or els by the spirite of error or deceit.
To auoide this therefore, doo all thinges according to the counsaile of thy superior, and submit thy selfe wholie to his will and direction.
NOthing can doo thee mischief (O Daughter) but thine owne will, which if thou hast once mortefied, no other creature can hurt thee, if thou beest dead to thy selfe, and hast mortefied thine owne desire.
That is, if these words, or rather the affection of these wordes, be mortefied in thee, to wit, I, and me, and to mee, and mine, which is as much to say, as if there bee no respect in the worlde in thee, to please thy selfe, or to serue thine owne appetite: who could hurt thee when liue in thee, and thou in me, whom no creature can resist, but is enforced to serue? Marrie if thou wilt followe or retaine stil within thee thine own will: all thinges will resist thee, all thinges will fight against thee, and in despight of thy teeth, whether thou wilt or no, thou must yeeld in the ende, and canst no way escape my prouidence, although it will bee then as a crosse to torment thee, and not as a consolation to reioyce thee.
But if thou renouncest quite thine owne will, thou shalt taste an inward peace and ioy, which that sensuall appetite of thine, neyther knoweth nor is able to conceiue: for nothing troubleth the world, but euery bodies seeking to please their owne appetite.
Therefore said to my Disciples: in the worlde, that is, in those thinges which are of the world, to witte, your own desires, which the world seeketh to satisfie: you shall haue distresse, but haue confidence, for haue ouercome the world, that both you may ouercome in me, and haue peace in me also.
Beginne therefore thou also and taking out this lesson, both mortefie and plucke vp by the very rootes all the desires of the world, and all selfe loue out of thy hart.
Otherwise how canst thou ouercome the worlde or the Diuell, if they haue their armie within thee; that is, if they haue vices lodged within thy soule? Throw out quickly whatsoeuer is in thee, contrarie to my will: and whatsoeuer fighteth against thee: in thy spirituall warfare.
For neyther the worlde nor the Diuell can euer come to vanquish thee, or in a manner to resist thee, but by the helpe of those thinges which they possesse in thee.
Wherefore they which doo persecute thy vices, which doo oppresse thee, which shew vnto thee, and lay before thine eyes, thine owne weakenesse: to be short, which offend thee, that is, which offend thine owne will in thee, and consequently thy selfe, because thine owne will and selfe loue raigneth in thee.
(For otherwise they could not offend thee, for that these things, to witte, thy selfe will, and thy selfe loue, are onely hurt and offended:) they therefore (as saide) which doo thus offend thine owne will in thee, which shewe thee howe thou haste not mortified thine owne appetite, are thy speciall friends and benefactors.
These thou oughtest to loue, and with all to bee glad, because they doo persecute thyne owne appetitie, which is thy worst aduersarie, and onely dangerous enemie.
Therefore if thou wilt wisely vse, and take the benefite of this occasion, the more stronger thou shalt growe, the greater force thou shalt haue.
The lesse rule that thine owne appetite hath ouer thee, the more interest haue still in thee, and the further that it is banished from thee, the more fullie doo possesse thee, because following of thine owne will, if it doo thee no other hurt, yet it doth euer certainely bring this mischiefe vppon thee, that it suffereth not mee to haue operation possession in thee.
Wherfore it depriueth thee of mee which am infinite goodnes it self.
For though thou labourneuer so much, and deuise neuer so many meanes, thou shalt neuer finde any other way to come vnto me then this, which haue taught my Disciples, saying: Hee that will come after me, let him denie himselfe, that is, let him leaue, mortefie, and quite forsake his owne wil, take vp his crosse and follow mee.
Begin therefore with this, for this of necessitie thou must do, whatsoeuer thou forsakest, if thou forsakest not thy selfe, thou hast forsaken nothing.
And contrariwise, if thou possessest not thy selfe, but leauest thy selfe to bee possessed by mee, thou hast forsaken all thinges for my sake, although thou liuest in all abundance of wealth honor.
The more that thou goest out of thy selfe, the farther doo enter into thee, and as much as thou dost die vnto thy selfe, so much doo liue in thee.
If thou displeasest thy self, will be the sweeter vnto thee.
Forsake therefore all thinges, that thou maiest finde all thinges, that is, forsake thy selfe, that thou maiest find mee.
Howe long wilt thou stay (my Daughter) how long wilt thou stande still amazed? All thy distresse proceedeth onely of that extreame selfe loue which possesseth thy hart, and of the small confidence which thou hast in mee.
Forsake therefore thy selfe, and beleeue me, dost thou thinke that can deceiue thee? why dost thou not commit thy selfe to me? Why dost thou not trust in my goodnesse? What art thou able to profit thy selfe, or what canst thou do to thy selfe? What art thou without mee? art thou in any daunger? if committing thy selfe to thou renouncest thyne owne will? See to whome thou committest thy selfe? To me verely, without whome thou shouldest haue no beeing at all, or be any waies able to stand, much lesse then to bee safe and well.
Wilt thou then committe thy selfe vnto me, with whome thou canst neuer bee ill? Wilt thou then commit thy selfe vnto me, who cannot reiect thee, who cannot forsake thee, who cannot deceaue thee, who cannot but looue thee? Throwe thy selfe into my armes pray thee, and relie thy selfe wholly vppon me, with confidence, and without delay will receaue thee, will preserue thee. without mee thou art, as though thou wert not at all, therefore if thou louest thy selfe, reiect thy selfe and embrace mee, that may also embrace thee, and vnite thee so close vnto me, as no man shall bee able to hurte or touch thee, but that hee must first of necessity, hurt and touch me.
Wherfore leaue thy selfe with a glad and willing minde, that thou mayest neyther seeke, wish or choose this or that, of any respect, looue or inclination which thou carriest to thy selfe, but let all thinges bee indifferent to thee, onely thou shouldest for my sake, esteeme that dearest, and desire that most, which thou knowest is most acceptable vnto me.
For thou oughtest to meditate of that prayer alwaies in thy heart, which offered vnto my Father in the Garden, when was going to my passion, saying.
Lord thy will be done: Likewise: not mine, but thy will be done.
Teach me to doo thy will, because thou art my God.
Or els this: Let it be done vnto me according to thy good pleasure.
But wilt thou knowe how much thou haste forsaken thy selfe, or how much thou hast mortefied thine owne will? see, when losse of any thing, when reproches, when iniuries doo happen vnto thee, whether thou beest troubled with them, and whether thou beest more troubled when they happen to thee, then when they happen to other men.
By this thou shalt finde the loue which thou bearest to creatures: yea, thou shalt perceiue the affection which thou carriest to thy selfe.
For thou dost therefore loue temporall goods, thou dost therefore loue honor, thou dost therefore loue quiet, and thou dost therefore loue such miserable, and transitory thinges, because thou louest thy selfe.
For thou wishest to enioy these things, whereas if thou diddest loue me, thou shouldest rather bannish all these things quite from thy hart for my sake, and take all aduersitie as willingly as thou wouldest possesse happines; to be short, thou shouldest not bee more, but rather much lesse troubled when aduersitie happeneth to thy selfe, then when it happeneth to others.
For thou shouldest neuer bee greeued with anye accedent in this world, but onely when thou shewedst thy self vnreuerent or contemptuous towardes me.
Therefore, hee that will forsake himselfe (my Daughter) his onely labour, exercise, and the whole scope of his desire, must tend not partly, but altogether to mortefie his owne appetite, to renounce his owne will, to bee transformed into a new shape, and to be in all sorts free, deliuered from any impediment whatsoeuer, which lyeth in the way, and maketh a deuision betwxit him and mee.
The least impediments are cogitations forms of creatures which men frame in their minde; the greatest is a mans owne will, which the stronger it is, and the more large place that it occupieth and possesseth in a man: the lesse present there, and so consequently the lesse doo possesse in his soule.
As long therefore as thou findest an inclination or naturall desire, to one thing more than another, thou art not yet perfectly mortefied, but thou haste somewhat remayning in thee, which thou must mortefie and extinguish.
What motion soeuer thou feelest in thy selfe, that proceedeth not from mee, what thing soeuer goeth about to busie, alter, or possesse thy mind, what likenesse soeuer of any thinge, doth labour to imprint it selfe within thy hart, whatsoeuer seeketh to draw thy liking to it, or to grieue or ouerwhelme thee: Endeuor thou with a recollected minde, close shut within it selfe, and lifted vp to me, lightly to passe ouer and careleslie to despise all hope and feare, gaine and losse, quiet and laboure, ioy and griefe, mirth and sadnesse, and all suche thinges as may seeke to possesse thy heart with all affection that thou mayest carrie towardes them.
For if thou fixe thy minde vppon mee, thou shalt easily tread all these things vnder thy feete.
But if thou louest thy selfe, if thou haste not wholie renounced thine owne selfe, thou shalt alwaies feele by following of thyne owne appetite, ioye and griefe, anger and feare, care and infinite other passions.
Wherefore thou canst neuer bee quiet, except thou haste cleane mortefied thy selfe and forgotten thine owne selfe whollie.
Thou must quite abandon thy selfe, that thou mayest liue in me onely, bend thy selfe to be wise in me only, be sencible to feele nothing but mee onely.
Thou shalt want nothing if thou bee content in this sorte to want thy selfe.
Thou shalt want nothing as long as thou art with me, will haue care of thee, will protect thee, thou canst loose nothing in loosing of thy selfe after this sort, for thou shalt finde in mee, that which is a hundred times better, then the thinges which thou haste lost for my sake.
Cast therefore all thy care, all thy trouble, all thy feare, and euen thy selfe also vpon me and commit thy selfe to mee.
Hope and trust in me, thy hope cannot deceaue thee, neither can it possibly bee to great, if thou lead est a good penitent life: whatsoeuer thou co~plainest of to a man that is thy friend, reueale the same vnto me.
will take care of thee, will mainetaine thee, will defend thee.
Wherefore see that thou regard me onelie, beeing quite banished from thy selfe within thee: that thou mayest mortefie and extinguish thy selfe, that is by rooting out thy desires, thy selfe loue, thy sensuall appetites, and by renouncing all those delights of thine, which thou diddest desire before, and for which vnlawfull desires was not thy GOD, nor thou my seruant.
(O my Daughter) thou oughtest to labour with all thy force, that thou mayest attaine to this obedience, this forsaking of thine own will for my sake, thou oughtest to resigne thy selfe so wholly vnto me, so far to subiect thy selfe to my will, as thou shouldest haue no other wil at all in thy selfe, but only that which is my will and pleasure.
AS long as there remayneth anye choyse, election, or inclination in thee, that mooueth thee to take more pleasure, to be better contented, and to receaue greater consolation by one thing then by an other: there resisteth some thing of thine owne in thee, thou haste not yet fullie renounced thy selfe.
For thou oughtest to take all thinges indifferently, and equally, without eyther more ioy, or more greefe, at one time then an other and onely to depend and relie vppon my prouidence.
For this course woulde procure thee greatest libertye, the greatest peace, and the greatest quietnesse to thy soule.
Stand not therefore vpon thy selfe, beleeue not thine owne wit or thine owne force, trust not in thine owne abilitie, promise thy selfe nothing vpon thine own warrant, build nothing vppon thine owne imagination, and doo nothing of thyne owne head, neyther haue confidence in thine own profiting, or in thine own will, although it be indeed good: but forsaking in all sorts thine owne selfe: goe out of thy selfe, and renouncing quite all the propertie which thou hast in thy selfe, rest and repose thy selfe in me only, trust in my goodnes, relie vpon my grace, and vppon my prouidence, bee ready at all times without any choyse, without any difference without any murmuring in thy heart, to receaue for the fulfilling of my pleasure, aduersitie, as willinglye as prosperitie, both temporallye, and eternallie, desiring alwaies this onelie thing, that thou mayest euer be in all respects according to my will.
And therefore regard not howe much or how little thou profitest, how neere or how farre thou art from mee, howe greate or how small giftes thou haste of me, nor whether thou shalt bee in Purgatorie or no, howe long or when thou shalt suffer those paines, but refer thy selfe wholly to my prouidence, and desire nothing, but that thou mayest euer bee found best contented with that which agreeth most with my pleasure, and wish not for any greater good, neyther thinke that greater can possibly happen vnto thee, then that my first, last, and most laudable will be fulfilled in thee.
Wherfore seeke to please me in all such sort as is most agreeable to my will, let my will be both thy perfection, and the measure of thy perfection· Trouble not thy hart with any question or immagination of future thinges, take no care for those thinges that bee vncertaine, and may happen, but leaue all these thinges to me which gouerneth all, for it may so fall out, as that euill which is expected or feared, may not happen: of if it do happen, when it is present, sufficient for the day is the euill thereof.
For howsoeuer, whatsoeuer doth by my permission chance vnto thee, my prouidence ought to please thee aboue all thinges, and thou oughtest to praise me for it, and to holde this as an vndoubted truth, that, that is euer best for thee, which doth so happen vnto thee, and that it was foreseen, appointed by my gracious hand, to fall vppon thee for thy commodity: as thou doost with a full confidence whollie depend vpon my goodnes.
To conceaue well of me, to trust firmely in mee, to commit themselues altogether vnto me, these things say, be as it were trumpets, whereby men doo sound out my goodnes.
And therefore when finde these things in any man, they please me so much, as can neuer forsake him, nor suffer any euil or dangerous thing to happen vnto him, which hath thus setled his hope in mee.
The greater hope and trust therefore that thou hast in mee, the more fully perfectly thou shalt obtaine thy desire.
And whatsoeuer shall happen vnto thee, if thou beleeuest that am so good and gratious as will turne all thy aduersities, and all things that persecute thee, or are thine enemies to thy good, that is, to thy befit, will not deceiue thee, but doo it indeede.
And if at the least thou canst but frame thy selfe to accept all things in this sort, it shall so come to passe out of all doubt as haue saide.
Yet my deuout friends are wont to pray, that may deliuer them from Purgatorie, it is no ill petition.
But when thou art come to perfection, and praiest, lying prostrate at the feete of my Maiestie, thou shalt desire to satisfie my iustice with that small abillitie which resteth in thee, and shalt offer thy selfe for my glorie vnto Purgatorie, and to suffer for the fulfilling of my will, whatsoeuer it shall be my will to lay vpon thee the fulfilling of my will shall please thee more than the escaping of Purgatorie.
Therefore if thou shalt ouercome by my grace, that inordinate loue and zeale which thou carriest toward thy selfe, for thy self, to please thy senses and thine owne will, perfectly with a full confidence wouldest commit thy self vnto me, and rely vppon mee onely: thou shouldest finde that my grace would worke woonders in thee.
Studdy therfore to please me, (my Daughter) and with thinking of mee, cleane forget thy selfe, and will so continually thinke of thee, and bee alwaies such an assistant vnto thee, as will neuer forsake thee.
Once againe say vnto thee, accept all things which happen vnto thee, as sent purely, simply, and immediatly from my hand, and not from any creature, admiring, praysing, and accepting in all thinges of my prouidence, with ioy and gladnes, and with looue thankesgiuing to me for my goodnesse.
For in all those thinges which happen vnto thee, doo intende and worke thy saluation, and with a singuler affection beeing mindfull of thee, send and appoint these thinges for thee, to the ende that thou maiiest either doo or suffer such thinges as may mooue me to haue mercie vppon thee.
Endeuour thou therefore to draw out of things which thou seest feelest, and out of all things which doo happen vnto thee, an occasion to praise and honour me, that thou maiest be worthie to vnderstand the true cause why permitted them, that is, with howe great charitie sent them vnto thee, and how thou oughtest to referre all these things vnto my pleasure, to trust in me, and withall to offer thy selfe for my glorie, euen vnto the fountaine from whence they flowed, that is, vnto my goodnes.
If thou wert perfectly acquainted with this exercise, whereby thou shouldest as willingly accept sorrow, as comfort at my hand, shouldest also know how to finde me in euery one of my creatures: nothing could then seeme so contrarie and ouerthwart vnto thee, that thou wouldest not contemne and despise: yea, nothing could bee so contrarie vnto my nature Maiestie, but that it would put thee in minde to offer sacrifice vnto mee, for am in euery creature, without me, no creature can haue any being.
Wherefore no creature is so neere to himselfe, as who am most neere, and inward with themall.
Wherefore thou oughtest to be so poore in spirit, as there should be nothing, that thou diddest either loue or mislike, seeke or flie, or desire for any respect to thy selfe: bnt onely for the fulfilling of my will, which at all times in all places thou shalt come woonderfully to vnderstand, by those things which ordaine, and permit, if thou seekest mee with a pure mind and hast regard to consider of my prouidence.
REceiue all aduersitie and tribulation as a messenger and token of my grace, which approcheth towardes thee, and therefore whensoeuer thou findest thy selfe oppressed with anye trouble or aduersitie, reioyce, knowing that thou haste deserued it, impute not that which thou sufferest to any body, but to thine owne sins, and withall giue me thankes, that looking vpon thee with the eies of my mercy, haue vouchsafed to bestow so much fauour on thee, as to visite, reprooue, correct thee heere with a rod like my child, and haue not vtterly reiected thee, as thou didst deserue.
For as long as chasten thee, as long as scourge thee, it is a signe that desire thou shouldest amend.
But if withdrawe my correction, leauing thee wholly to thy selfe, thou shalt seeme then to haue rest be quiet, but thou art most vnhappie, when haue withdrawne from thee that care and regard which had of thee, that thou art no long my custodie.
Whatsoeuer therefore that thou sufferest, say vnto thy selfe, haue deserued more greeuous punishment, but although thou haddest deserued none, yet thou shouldest beare all those aduersities which lay vppon thee, for the loue of me, and for my sake (least that otherwise my good pleasure should not bee fulfilled) euen gladlie with a most patient and louing minde towards me, considering that suffered so many grieuous torments for thy saluation.
And yet although had suffered nothing do not deserue that thou shouldest suffer somewhat for my sake, in respect of those infinite benefits which daylie powre vppon thee, seeing all that thou haste, thou receiuest fro~ me only? lastly, suppose that there were none of these reasons to mooue thee, yet oughtest thou to remember, that thou art mine, created and made by mee, and no lesse in my power to be framed euery way accorto my will, then earth is, when it is in the hand of the Porter.
And that it is therefore in my power, and a part of my iustice to doo with thee whatsoeuer will, and it is no more lawfull for thee to gainesay me, then for the earth to gainesay the Potter.
For what hast thou to say against mee, who am thy creator, whether sende thee comfort or sorrowe? But knowing thou hast committed so much wickednes as thou hast done, why dost thou not rather desire that that contempt, wherewith thou hast despised my goodnesse shoulde bee punished in thee, and thy proude and arrogant minde humbled? But there is yet another reason to moue thee the rather hereunto, that is, because am one, which doo loue thee most faithfully, and doo prouide all things that are best and most holesome for thee.
And seeing it was my will before created thee, that thou shouldest suffer at this houre, and at this moment those same thinges which thou doost suffer: thou oughtest to desire aboue all thinges, that this my most louing will, beeing full of all fidelitie and charitie towards thee, may be fulfilled in thee, so as thou shouldest endure al those thinges which thou dost suffer, with gladnes, with a sweet kind of patience, with thanksgiuing, with meeknes, and with deuotion in thy hart, hauing no chollerick, nor bitter thought against those which seeke to lay those aduersities and vexations vppon thee: but rather thou shouldest take them as my ministers in this behalfe, appointed and commaunded by mee to this purpose, and thou shouldest consider hauing thine eyes fixed vpon mee onelie, with how louing, how kind, and howe faithfull a heart towardes thee, haue sent thee these troubles for thy benefit.
Receaue therefore all affliction whatsoeuer falleth vppon thee, as sent from my hande onelie without anye other meane, and take it as sent by mee of loue towardes thee for thy commoditie, accept it as gladlye as doo sende it louinglye.
And when thou suffrest no aduersity, thinke that my good will is alienated from thee, that am offended with thee, because withdraw afflictions tribulations from thee, which is the notablest gift and ornament wherewith am wont to honour and beautifie my friends.
Recount with thy selfe howe great vexations, how great pesecutions, how great contradictions, how great torments, how great wearisome toiles suffered: how great my most deare mother endured: and to be short, how great all my friendes walking in my steps haue stayned.
Remember also that no man attaineth to eternall glorie, but by the Crosse, and Cup of affliction and that there is no other way but this high waye to the heauenlie country, which way of necessitie thou must passe thorough, if thou desirest to enioy our companie in eternal happines.
Lastlie consider that there is nothing so small or so little woorth, which either thou dost or sufferest for my sake, but that thou shalt receaue a very great and glorious reward of me for it.
And yet notwithstanding will not haue thee to serue mee, or to suffer these things in hope of reward, but onely of meere loue towards mee.
know what reward will giue thee, say will, because doo not owe it thee in any other sort, then for that it is my will to bestow it vpon thee.
Thinke not thou therefore of any rewarde, be not so base minded, but thinke of me, with a more noble, louing, and faithful hart, and submit thy selfe vnto mee, euen of meere loue for mine owne sake, to endure whatsoeuer my will is to lay vppon thee.
If thou knewest (my Daughter) how great fruit is reaped by tribulations, thou wouldest esteeme it as a great happines to glory in crosses afflictions.
The greater aduersities therefore that doo happen vnto thee, and the more contrary that they are to thy desires, yea, although they repugne such desires of thine as are to please mee) the more earnestly thou shouldest endeuor patiently to suffer them, the more wholly thou shouldest resigne thy selfe vnto me.
For it is done by my will and prouidence, that thy will sometime bee hindered: yea, euen when it is good, that by this meane for one vertue thou maiest obtaine two, and withall maiest receiue the rewarde of a good worke for thy good will (although thou be not permitted to put it in executio~) for the aduersitie which did hinder thy will, thou shalt receiue a crown of patience.
Thou maiest adde to all these, for thy farther incouragement this one reason also, that the more thy good will is tempted by aduersitie, and the faithfuller it is found, and the more patient it is in bearing of crosses, and such thinges as resist it: the more glorious the crowne is which haue laide vp to reward it.
Therefore because loue thee, will haue thee to be wholy and purely a faithfull Spouse vnto mee.
will haue thee to serue mee with renouncing all interest in thy selfe, and to goe, not whether thou wilt, but whether sende or leade thee.
Neither must thou seeke withall to serue thine owne appetite, when thou laborest in these thinges to please mee: but rather as a faithfull, deuout, and obedient handmaid, which hath no will to do any thing, but that which is agreeable to the will of her Mistresse.
Thou must seeke in nothing to please thy selfe, but me onely, with all sinceritie and puritie in thy intention, and that must be alwaies most acceptable vnto thee which lay vppon thee to suffer, whether it be by the hands of men, or any other meane whatsoeuer.
Respect not therefore men, neither impute it to men, if thou sustainest any aduersitie.
What blame doth the rod deserue, if the father seeking to correct his sonne doth vse it? why then art thou angry with men, which being my instrumentes serue as a scourge to correct thee? Seeke not therefore to resist them, or to argue against them, but haue a speciall care that thine own impaciencie doo not hurt thy selfe, lest thou lose that benefit by repining, which thou shouldest haue gained by patient suffering.
Bee therefore curteous and gentle towardes all men, in taking patiently whatsoeuer shall happen.
Carry a milde countenance, and vse an humble behauiour, that no choller, nor exclaiming, no deiection of thy minde, nor sorrow appear in thee, nor yet that any thing be found in thee, which may make men to thinke, that thou endurest some affliction, or art oppressed with some trouble.
If any man reprooue or reproche thee, shewe him a milde and gentle countenance holding thy peace, and smile with a certaine kinde of bashfulnes and modestie, in token of thy charitie which accepteth it in good part, and which taketh all things well, without either thinking of reuenge, or remembring of an iniurie.
Beware that thou speakest not at that time aboue two or three words, and that with great temperance.
And by this meane thou shalt shewe thy selfe so humble and meeke, as euery man may presume to reprooue thee, and no man be afraide to displease thee, or to vse any reproch towards thee.
Learne in all aduersitie whensoeuer any man doth chide thee, reproch thee, or iniurie thee, to vse silence, to beare it patiently, and to bee quiet, and thou shalt assuredly find my grace, which thou canst neuer attaine vnto by any other meane, then by being quiet, and suffering patiently whatsoeuer shall lay vppon thee, being as willing if it stand with my pleasure, to receiue aduersitie, as to enioy prosperitie.
Thou hast (my Daughter Spouse also) my life as perfect example of patience and meekenes, neither did speake it without great reason, when said: Learn of me because am meeke and humble of hart, seeing that my life was a liuely patterne of patience, humillitie, meekenes.
For in the middle of all my paines and torments, of all the derisions blasphemies, which mine enemies vsed towards me, of all their cruell threatnings, of their most wicked and despightfull countenances against mee, what complaint or shewe of repining at this dealing of theirs proceeded from mee? which of mine enemies did curse? to which of them did speake sharpely? which of them did answere? to which of them did wish any harme? Nay rather, was not sorry for them, when did pray for them all? Followe thou therefore my example, and haue patience still ioyned with quietnes and tranquillitie of thy soule, be meeke without murmuring or complaining.
Fight not for thy selfe, defend not, neither yet excuse thou thy selfe, holde thou thy peace, and commit both thy selfe and thy cause to my protection: will fight for thee.
Cleaue therefore in the meane time whole vnto mee, in all quietnes without any perturbation, or motion in thy soul, being ready with all gladnes, rather to suffer any confusion for my sake, then either inwardly in thy minde, or outwardly in thy showe to vse the least murmuring in the worlde against mee.
As long as thou thinkest that thou art wronged: as long as thou beleeuest my (Daughter) that thou sufferest vniustly; or hast not deserued those thinges which thou sufferest: thou art neither come to true patience, nor yet to a perfect knowledge of thy selfe.
Wherefore would wish thee to bee alwaies ready with a ioyfull and deuout hart to runne and meete any aduersitie, that shall light vppon thee: and offer thy selfe vnto me, as one that is willing to suffer tribulations, to want all thinges that thou desirest, and both to take any trauaile, and to beare any misery in what sort soeuer it shall be my pleasure to appoint.
Thinke that day lost wherein thou hast not receiued some notable crosse.
If thou knewest what great commodity is reaped by patience, thou wouldest doo great honour, and shewe great thankefulnes to those that afflict thee.
Consider how I, as an innocent Lambe, did carry a most meeke and quiete minde, voide of all bitternesse towardes those which did spette vppon mee, scourge mee, and crucifie mee, and how excused them, and prayed for them, In like sort must thou doo, and not account any thing iniurie that is done vnto thee, nor yet beleeue that iniuries can be offered thee, but regard me onely, respect mee whollie, and thou shalt come to learne that I, and no other haue done al these things meerely of loue towardes thee.
By dooing thus (my Daughter) there is nothing in any creature which will not bee a meane and occasion, for thee to obtaine my grace more aboundantly, because thou shalt finde me in euery one of them, so that thou dost contemplate vppon the creature, not as a creature, but vppon mee in the creature, as thou oughtest to doo.
And if thou dost in this behalfe as thou oughtest, thou shalt receiue me, thou shalt heare me, thou shalt feele me in euery one of my creatures.
doo speake vnto thee in them all: hearken therefore vnto me, learne by euery thing that happeneth vnto thee, what woulde haue thee doo, and when thou knowest my will, be euer most ready to performe it.
If thou diddest giue eare vnto mee after this manner, the worlde and all things contained therein, should bee a booke of instructions for thee to direct thee in that course, whith agreeth most with my pleasure.
THE high way, and also that most excellent way, wherein all my perfect friends haue walked, wherin thou must also walke: is, to want all kinde of consolation, when thou art compassed in on euery side with aduersitie and distresse, and to be so pore as there may be nothing left, to which thou maist turne thy selfe for succour, to which thou maist flie vnto for refuge, or in which thou maist trust: nor yet, that there be any man whom thou maist seeke counsaile of, or in whome thou maist haue confidence but in me onely, that by this meane thou maist haue no other thing to remaine for thee to doo, but onely that all thy care cogitations may tend to deuise how thou mayest profit and set foorth my glorie, in sustaining of these afflictions both inwardly in thy minde, by hauing a desire to offer thy selfe vnto them, and outwardly in thy behauiour by seruing of all creatures, subiecting thy selfe vnto them all, in such sort as if it were lawfull for the~ without committing any offence, or dooing thee any iniurie to afflict thee, and tread thee vnder their feete: yea, as if they did in this no more than charged and commanded them.
In dooing thus, thou shouldest bee free, from all complayning, from all disputing, from all grudging, and from all mallice against thy neighbour.
And by this account thou shouldest loue those best which did oppresse thee most.
Because they did open the way vnto thee, whereby thou mayest come to renounce thy selfe, and gaue thee an oportunity both to please me, and shewe thy selfe thankefull towards me.
Moreouer thou shouldest reioyce, that they offered thee a good occasion to exercise vertue, and to trie thy loue towards mee, and thou wouldest desire this aboue all thinges, if thou diddest indeed perfectly loue me.
There is yet an other perfection greater then this, and in a higher degree, that is, to be destitute both of all earthly and heauenly consolation, being loaden with tentations, distresses, vexations, doubts, feares, perplexities, and aduersities, to be as it were vtterly reiected from me and quite forgotten by mee, and yet notwithstanding all this, not to flie from mee, and go to my creatures, not to depart from me, and seeke worldly help, nor yet to desire, that consolations and reuelations shoulde bee imparted vnto them.
But still to trust in me, to expect patiently my pleasure, to cleaue vnto mee with a pure faith, and perfect charitie, and to bee readie to continue in this state, as long as it shall bee my will to permit it.
Nay which is more, to refer the~selues wholy vnto mee, to offer the~selues to suffer these, any thing whatsoeuer, for the fulfilling of my and setting forth of my glorie, and to praise me in all these distresses, in such sort as they are able, although it be but with a dry and barren hart.
THou hast vnderstood sufficiently (my Spouse) how thou oughtest to bee patient, and in patience meeke, that is, howe thou oughtest to beare all things with so indifferent, peaceable and quiete a minde (for meekenes is no other thing, then perfect tranquillitie in true patience) as nothing should bee able to make thee sad, or to vexe or trouble thee, whatsoeuer did happen vnto thee, that proceeded not from me in my wrath and displeasure, whether it were for a time or for eternitie, excepting this onely, which thou must alwaies carrie for a firme resolution, that thou wilt neuer bee excluded from my grace and charitie, nor yet in thine owne will bee withdrawen or deuided from me: For this thou must not neglect, but take care of aboue all thinges that thou maiest alwaies bee vnited vnto mee in perfect charitie: Thou must also remember, in what place soeuer thou beest, what paine or consolation soeuer thou feelest (if the same be for the setting forth of my glorie, and by my speciall pleasure) that thou reioyce in it, because by it thou obaiest my will being ready in euery sort to be according as it shall best agree with my will, either comforted or afflicted.
And when thou art setled in this resolution no losse of any externall thing that happeneth vnto thee, in this world can grieue thee: For nothing can chaunce that is contrarie to thy liking, as long as my will is alwaies thy will, and that thou hast no other wil in thee, but that which is my pleasure: Therfore then (as said) let my will bee alwaies fulfilled in all things.
And it should be the greatest ioy that thou couldest haue, when my will is performed in thee.
For thou art then fully setled in thine inward man, in all peace tranquillity, although thou findest in thine owne outward man, distresse and desolation, which notwithstanding thou dost patiently take without any perturbation, because thy will is in all things agreeable to mine.
Be quiet in this manner (my Daughter) prouiding so, as all furie, and all kind of repining bee altogether extinguished in thee, and that thine irascible powre or faculty bee euen so fully mortefied in thee, as it bee vnmoueable, and not to bee stirred by any accident.
Let thy concupiscible power also bee so established in vertue, as it may be wholly lifted vp vnto mee, And let thy reasonable power taking part of their ioyes, accord with them, so as thy conscience inioying peace and quietnesse within it selfe, thy whole soule may be in perfect tranquillitie.
Of the loue which we should beare towards our neighbour.
LEt thy hart towards thy neighbor (my Daughter) bee full of compassion, and a chaste kinde of loue.
call that a chaste loue which defileth not the hart with carnal co~cupiscence, nor dooth busie it with too much familiarity, nor too often keeping of companie, nor doth staine it with anie inordinate affection, nor doth disquiet it with thoughts that procure distraction in thy soule, nor doth trouble it with importunitie of vaine desires, nor dooth occupie thy imagination with multitude of fancies, or impressions of diuers thinges: but without choyse of persons, or regard of sexe doth embrace all sorts of men women for my sake, with abundance of charitie, and for it onely without any other respect at all.
Therefore being full of a deuout kinde of good will pure charitie, reioyce with euery one in all the benefites and commodities which they receiue, whether it bee touching their soule or bodie, euen flowing with a kinde of compassion, which can neuer cease running.
Lament with euery one in their necessities and tribulations, powring out the streames of thy curtesie, affabillitie, mercie and pittie to all men.
And see that thou beest inflamed with a ready desire and willing minde to comfort them, to serue them to succour them, and to helpe them, to beare the burthen of their troubles, esteeming their corporall or spirituall afflictions thine owne, carrying the vnspeakeable affection of a most tender Mother towards all men whatsoeuer.
Endeuour therefore to excuse euery man, and to doo them good by thy praiers, benefits, and all the pleasures that lieth in thy power.
And vpon such as thou canst bestow no other benefitte, seeke to mittigate their sorrow, with thy curteous behauiour, thy sweete speeche, or any other meanes that thou art able.
Take speciall heede that thou neither iudgest, nor despisest any man, because it both harmeth thy soule and besides displeaseth mee wonderfully.
And therefore exclude by all the meanes thou maiest suspicions, and ill conceits of other men, from thee: Excuse also all those which fal offend.
When thou seest one to sin, say within thy selfe: that he was permitted to fall for his greater amendment, that he had a good intention, and was deceiued either by ignorance or error, that his infirmitie beeing too strongly assaulted with tentation, was enforced to yeeld.
Say and speake it vnfainedly from thy hart, that thou haddest fallen much more heinously then he did if this tentation had assaulted thee.
Thou oughtest not with one and the selfe same, but with a diuers eye to looke vpon thine own and thy neighbours acts.
For thou shouldest iudge of thine owne with a seuere eye, agrauating thine imperfections, and not esteeming or seeking to lessen thy vertues.
And on the contrary part, thou shouldest make reckoning of thy neighbors imperfections as very small and of this vertues as very great.
Wherefore take care alwaies neyther to speake nor heare ill of others.
Neuer reprooue thy neighbour in anger though he deserue to bee blamed.
For what dooth it profit thee if thou curest him, and woundest thy selfe? Or what doth the medicine auaile, if by it thou goest about to heale one wound, and in the meane time makest tenne others? Expecte thou a time wherein thou mayest haue fit opportunitie to reprooue him, and then reprooue him with the spirite of lenitie sweetnes, rather by entreating him, and exhorting him, then by handling him sharpely or roughly, making thy hartie praiers vnto mee, with sorrowfull groanes, that this reproouing of thine may be effectuall and work his saluation.
Take heede that thou beest not the cause of breeding dissention, discord, or hatred amongst men, but let all thy speech in all places tend to peace, beeing mindfull that said: Blessed are the peace makers, for they shall bee called the children of God.
If any man offend thee, if any man persecute thee with malice, requite his wrongs with benefits, his hard sower countenance, with a sweete and meeke behauiour, his sharpe and reprochfull words, with milde gentle answers, and by this meane thou shalt more easily bring him to the knowledge of his owne fault.
Let all the labours, miseries, pouertie, contempt and sorrowes, which thou seest men endure, put thee in minde of those labours, afflictions, contempts, paines and manie other sharpe and grieuous miseries, which suffered for thy sake, that thou mayest by this meane behold me, finde mee, perceaue me, perfectly loue mee, daylie suffer with me, and continually be transformed into me, by euerye thing which thou seest in euerie man.
ENdeuour to haue such puritie in thy hart, as beeing withdrawne from all earthly cogitations, thou maiest not addict thy selfe to any delight, nay that thou mayest seeke no delight, or take delight in any thing, or content thy selfe with the desire of any delight whatsoeuer: cut off also not onely vnlawfull thoughts, but all such as be idle, and vnprofitable, suffering none of them wittingly to enter into thee.
Let thy firme resolution bee to thinke nothing but either of mee, or for my sake.
Receaue not into thy hart as neere as thou canst, the similitude and formes of earthly things, but thrust out all such impressions and fancies, as soone as euer they beginne to appeare.
Cast all thy cares and troubles vpon me, be not disquieted with anye thing whatsoeuer shall happen.
Keepe euer a watchful guard ouer thy hart, that no inordinate affection to man, woman, or any other creature, no sensuall desire, no vicious passion, no concupiscence, no ill inclination, or wicked intention may rest in thee.
Neuer giue thy consent that any separation, although it be neuer so little, remaine betweene me and thee, and see that thou doost in nothing eyther seeke or respect thy selfe, but mee only, purely, simply, and wholy.
Lift vp thy hart in euery place vnto me, and keepe it still raysed from all earthly cogitations, that whatsoeuer thou haste to speake, to deale in, or to thinke of, thou do first deale with me in it by praier, and by the internall discourse of thy spirit.
Let euery action and externall businesse, giue thee matter and occasion to pray, yea, let the very occupation and businesse of thy hart be no other thing but a continuall and daylie praier.
See nothing though it bee neuer so farre from the nature of praier, so deformed or so contrarie to all goodnesse, but drawe thou presently out of it, some occasion to pray vnto me, and to praise my name.
Let all thinges bee meanes for thee to lift vp thy hart, and to raise thy affection vnto me.
What faire thing soeuer thou seest, what pleasant or delightfull thing soeuer thou feelest, acknowledge it to proceede from me, and let it put thee in minde of my beautie and glorie, that onelie may bee thy whole delight and consolation.
Let all thinges edefie thee, and whatsoeuer hapneth vnto thee, take opportunitie by it, to meditate vppon some thing that may be profitable for the soule.
How we ought to referre all the good thinges we receaue to the goodnes of God.
CHallenge nothing to thy self by any of my works, or by the meane of those giftes which bestow vppon thee.
Thou oughtest to acknowledge my giftes to my honour, and to wonder at my liberalitie and charitie bestowed vpon thee, without any desert of thine owne, and my most gratious bountie.
And withall thou must euer haue presented before thine eyes thine owne basenes, and how thou art of thy selfe meerely nothing, that by this consideration thou mayest not ascribe or challenge anie thing to thy selfe out of those giftes which bestowed vpon thee, neither yet bee reioyced or delighted with anie thing that thou receiuest from me, or for that haue wrought any good thing in thee.
Thou oughtest not say for anie of these to reioyce in thy selfe, or bee glad for thine owne sake, that is, because thou haste attained to some goodnes, for that should be a reioycing altogether in thy selfe, But thou shouldest reioyce in me, and for my gratious bountie that haue beene so good, so liberall, so gentle, and so merciful to a most vnworthy vnthankfull creature.
Which goodnesse of mine, the viler that thou art, dooth the more manifestlie appeare in thee.
Reioyce therefore in my gifts, not attributing any praise thereby to thy selfe, but ascribing thy whole glorye vnto mee.
And behaue thy selfe so discretly in receauing any of my gifts (excepting thankfulnes, and humility, which must euer increase in thee) as if nothing had beene giuen thee, nothing had beene wrought in thee, and that thou didst feele no good at all, directing thine eyes to thine own vnworthines, which art of thy selfe merely nothing, to thine owne disability.
which art able to doo nothing, and to thine owne imperfection, which cannot attaine to the smallest goodnesse without any grace, that by this meanes thou mayst not bee extolled in thyne owne conceite, or reioyce in thyne owne abillitie, or flatter thy selfe with thine owne power, but all vnto mee onelie.
If thou feelest therefore any sweet inspiration, or any lightning of my grace within thee, or that by my mercie, thou beest inabled to do an other man a benefitte, or good turne, thou mayest reioyce in the good, which did by thee as my instrument, but in no sorte to reioyce in thy selfe, that is, not to flatter or please thine owne appetite (for in it lieth hidden self loue) nor to thinke that it was done by thine own power, but rather turne away thy hart, from that which was done, and from thy selfe also, that thou mayest neuer ioyne together these two cogitations, which is thy selfe, and my benefit, except it bee (as said) when thou comparest my infinite goodnes with thy vnspeakable basenes.
Suffer it to passe ouer for that time, as though it had not beene done at al, and as though thou vnderstoode no such matter: and fixe all thy cogitations in the meane season vpon me, and not vpon the gift which thou haste receaued from me.
Looke neuer therfore into the gift it selfe, neither settle thy minde in that consideration, nor reioyce in it, nor yet be contented to rest there, neyther stay, if thou feelest any motion in examining and serching curiouslie, within thy selfe, what thou feelest, or what thou dost, or whether the motion proceed from me, or from some other cause, (for this dooth euer make a diuision betweene thee me, and doth stay thee longer from comming vnto me) but rather passe quicklie through all these cogitations, remoue them cleane from thee, and endeuour to vnite thy selfe more neerelie and firmely vnto me.
Choose rather not to know the thinges which after this sort do busie the minde, then with a curious seach to hinder my grace, and to procure thereby daunger to thy selfe, either of being puffed vp with pride, or of pleasing thy selfe, or of reioycing by the prouocation of selfe loue in thine owne abillitie, or for thine owne glory.
But refer these as all other thinges vnto mee, onely holde this with a resolute and assured minde, for an infallible principle, that if doo graunt thee any good gift, it is giuen meerely without desert, to an vnthankfull and vnworthy creature.
This kinde of humillitie dooth woonderfully please mee, that thou shouldest be afraid and troubled in respect of thine owne basenes, vnworthines and vnthankefulnes, and be timerous with the consideration of these things, and feele a shamefastnes and disquiet thereby, and rather think that thou feelest no good thing at all, or that the motion proceedeth not from me, than to stay vpon the consideration thereof, and reioyce therein.
Remember also that forbad my Apostles to reioyce in those miracles which they wrought, or to take any glorie because vnclean spirits did submit themselues vnto them, and obayed them, although they were not ignoraunt, but did assuredly knowne that this gift proceeded from me.
In like sort therefore (my Daughter) glorie not thou in thy selfe, neyther reioyce without me, for any consolation or gift which thou receiuest, that is, reioyce no otherwise in it then may tende to the magnifying of my name, neither stay in consideration of the thing it selfe (for therein doth euer some selfeloue lie lurking, which doth easily beguile those that bee not heedefull) but reioyce in mee onely, thatis, reioyce, because haue shewed my glorie, and fulfilled my will in thee.
Seeke no glorie to thy selfe by my giftes, neither couer to vsurpe or challenge to thy selfe any praise therby, neither yet ascribe any thing to thine owne abillitie.
Ascribe nothing at all say to thy self, or thine own power, neither suffer any other man to attribute any thing to thine own worthines, nor reioyce in it, as if it were thine own acte, but refer all vnto me, and keepe thy selfe from all manner of proprietie in thy selfe, from attributing anye thing to thine owne worthinesse, from desiring any thing for thine owne pleasure, or reioycing in any thing for thine own delight.
Liue without following thyne own counsaile, thine own iudgement, thine owne opinion.
If thou desirest (my Daughter) to be my spouse, keepe thy hart chaste pure, free and quite alienated from any other loue but mine onely, from beeing possessed by any of my creatures, that it may be left whole for me to dwell in, which am thy ceator.
As often as thou findest any sensuall or naturall loue in thy mind to man, woman, or any other creature whatsoeuer: so often remember with sorrowfull groanes to lift vp thy soule vnto me, earnestly desiering my grace, and my fauour onely, which is a most safe refuge, a most happie hauen for thee, and that not for a time, but endles and eternall.
Whatsoeuer therefore doth busie thy sences with any cogitations towards anie of my creatures, is, neither pure, nor without danger in thy soule.
Whensoeuer all thy naturall appetite receaueth any recreation, comfort or delight, (if thou seekest to attaine to a perfect puritie) thou must of necessitie renounce that pleasure whether it bee in wordes or anye other earthlie thing.
Thou must passe ouer all things with a free minde, in no sort subiect or in bondage vnto them, nor adhering to any but me onely.
Take this also with thee for a certaine rule, that nothing maketh a man so free from the loue of himselfe or any other creature and so far from beeing intangled with anie earthlie cogitation, as to despise himselfe and all creatures, and to account of me in his hart, as his onelie precious Iewell, esteeming all other thinges (as they are indeede) as filthie dung.
Make a dilligent search in all thy actions, studies, and desires, what moueth thee vnto them, whether thou speakest or holdest thy peace, whether thou doost somewhat, or beest at rest, looke narrowly into the innermost corners of thy soule, that is into the verie marrow of thy cogitations and intentions, and thou shalt often finde that the originall roote seed whereof this groweth, and from whence this doth spring, which thou thinkest diuine, is meerely humayne, impure, and a lewde seeking to please thine owne appetite.
Take heede therefore that no vicious thought enter into thee, nor any inordinate luste remaine in thee.
Oh if thou haddest thy hart clearely deliuered from the loue of euerie creature.
Oh if beeing wholly conuerted vnto me, thou diddest desire mee onlie, woulde with as great a desire run to meete thee, and enter of mine own accord with as great affection into thy hart, as if coulde not liue without thee, or that without beeing with thee could not enioy perfect happines contentation.
This course know wil seeme grieuous vnto thee at the beginning, and it cannot be without some troble thus straightly to note and obserue in all thinges what thou seekest, what thoughts possesse thy hart, and whensoeuer thou findest any cogitation that is not of mee, or for my sake, presently to root it out of thy minde.
This say, will procure thee great labour, and affliction of thy spirit.
For thou shalt finde both thy selfe, and thine owne appetite lie lurking in many thinges wherein thou must of necessitie forsake both, and presently mortefie any desire that is vnlawfull, and inordinate in thee.
For if thou seekest to ouercome thine owne nature, it followeth of necessitie that thou must doo it by violence and forcible meanes.
And therefore thou shalt finde as many crosses, as thou hast wicked or impure inclinations, which must be mortefied in thee.
But by this meane (my Daughter) thou shalt first come to knowe thy selfe, for by seeing thine owne disabillitie and weakenes in that thou canst not ouercome thy selfe, thou shalt be humbled.
And whereas before thou thoughtest thy selfe to bee somewhat, thou shalt then plainlye finde that thou art nothing: And if thou persistest in this course with continuall and incessant labour, that which at the first was painefull, thou shalt quickly finde to be very easie.
For this dilligent and daylie looking into thy selfe, and examining of all thy thoughtes, doth worke many thinges in thee, very profitable for thy saluation.
It will shew thee thine infirmitie, and imperfections, it will breede in thee sorrow, for those sinnes which thou findest in thy selfe, and an earnest desire to be deliuered of them.
It will also make thee very carefull to beware of manye offences, to auoid many dangers, into which otherwise thou wouldest haue fallen.
To conclude, the labour distresse which thou sustainest, and the toyle which thou takest to be clearely rid of these imperfectious, and the teares which thou sheddest (because thou canst not ouercome thy selfe, cleane be without those thinges which thou wouldest altogether forsake (shal bee a baptisme vnto thee for the purging of thy soule, and for the expiation of thine offences.
Faint not therefore in thy courage, for thou shalt ouercome all thinges by setling thy whole trust in my mercie.
Haue confidence in me, thou shalt finde that wil make these crosses light for thee, help thee my selfe to beare part of the burthen.
How diuine inspiratitions ought to bee obserued, and the grace of God not neglected.
HAue care (my Daughter) to abounde alwaies with vertuous customes, and to spend thy time in good exercises, that thou mayest vse the same as a meane to lift vp thy hart vnto mee when, thou feelest no other great or sensible motions of my grace within thee.
But thou shouldest neuer addict thy selfe so much to thy exercises, as to prefer thine own conceits before my inspirations.
For whensouer thou haste learned to know my will (whether it bee by the manifestation of the will of thy superior, or by my prouidence, by which of doubtfull euents, doo sometime fet downe a certaine iudgement) follow that straight way, and forsake thine owne appetite.
Whensoeuer also thou findest a sencible and plaine motion of me within thee, presentlie leaue thy selfe and obey mee, by following of mine inspirations.
For holde not my selfe satisfied though thou doest serue me, seeke me, and bend thy selfe to please mee; but will haue thee to serue me in such sort, as my will is to be serued, that is, will haue thee cleane to forsake thine own will, yea, although it bee in a thing which is vertuous and commendable, to followe my will in an other thing, which is not halfe so good, but seemeth to be vile and of no value.
For the same thing in respect of my will, that is, because it is my plesure, my ordinance, my appointment to haue it so, is not only not vile, of no valu, but very good, yea and much better also then the other.
Thou must therfore often omit and alter thine exercises in this sort, not of negligence, not of slouth, not of any inconstancie of thy hart, but of a pure, and meere renouncing of thy selfe, that thou mayest not in any place, or in any thing stand vpon thy selfe, but relie wholie vpon mee, with a firme and full confidence in me.
Oh if thou knewest what great danger, and what great losse of spiritual profit is incurred by not receiuing of mine inspirations when send the~, how damnable it is to resist my diuine motions, thy hart would euen consume for griefe, and very feare of my iustice.
Wherefore (my Daughter) stande alwaies in feare of thyne owne actions, and suspect thy selfe euer of vnthankfulnesse towards me.
Be euer in doubt that it may so happe~ vnto thee for thy deserts as it hath hap+ned to many other, that thou maiest for thy pride ingratitude bee iustly forsaken of me, deseruedly fal from my grace.
Bee humble therefore alwaies hauing no confidence in thy selfe but in me.
Pray continually for my grace, obserue my inspirations with great heede, that thou mayest know what require of thee, and it is not only sufficient for thee to know my will, but to doe it whensoeuer thou shalt come to know it, despising all other things whatsoeuer, to preferre it before anie delight or contentation of thine own.
And whereas warned thee, that thou shouldest be afraid for loosing of my grace, and for beeing forsaken of me by thine owne negligence and ingratitude; thou must haue a speciall care that this feare proceed not of desperation or of a weake faith, but of humilitie, which is euer a feare, full of hope and confidence in me.
If thou beest not able to imitate the exercises of other men, bee not therefore discouraged, or deiected in thine owne minde.
For thou shouldest not so much respect other mens exercises, as their vertues, seeing that do distribute my giftes to euery man according to his constitution by nature, and that perticuler vocation wherunto call him, and agreeable to that scope, and certaine end whereunto appoint him.
furnish him also with diuers exercises, fit for him, which are vnfit for manie other, and not meete for euerie bodie, because the nature or vocation of perticuler men. (to the which my grace for the most part, is accommodated, and made agreeable) is different, and many times very contrarie.
If therefore thou canst not followe other mens exercises of vertue, yet thou mayest immitate their vertues, for they be not different, but one and the same in all.
As for example, thou mayest be humble, thou maiest be merciful, thou maiest be patient, and thou mayest resemble other men, in the verie same vertues, though thou canst not immitate them in the verie same exercises.
For there is but one way to please me, which hath bin to all my holy seruants euer one vniforme and the same.
This is the way of charitie which hath manie and sundrie exercise, of my holie seruaunts, directed to one ende, and which thou must walke, by whatsoeuer meanes shall appoint vnto thee.
If thou walkest in this way of charitie, that is, if thou follow mee, by receauing of all things as from me, by committing of allthinges vnto me, by humbling thy selfe vnder my mighty hand, by yeelding thy selfe vnto me, by respecting me onlie, and seeking my glorie in all thinges, that either thou doest or speakest; will not suffer thee to goe astray, though thou walkest in neuer so great darknesse or ignoraunce, though thou beest vexed with neuer so great temptation or distresse, and though thou thinkest thy selfe neuer so quite forsaken or reiected by mee.
Haue thou therefore consideration alwaies of thy vocation or calling, and vse exercises agreeable to the same, beeing euer readie to leaue them, change them, discontinue them, and resume them, according as thou shalt be directed by my inspirations, prouidence, and good pleasure.
For thou shouldest not measure thy perfection by this or that mans account, nor by thine owne estimation: but thou oughtest to measure it by my good pleasure, resigning thy selfe whollie thereunto, that thou mayest not seeke to attaine to this or that mans affection, or to such as thou desirest thy selfe, but to such as my will is to appoint thee.
Let that perfection therefore which thou desirest consist, eyther in abundance, or scarcitie, according to my will and good pleasure.
Wish and pray that thou maiest be such a one in my sight, as my speciall will is to haue thee.
Obserue diligentlie, and learne both to know and follow the inspiration of my grace.
If thou neither seekest to please thy naturall inclinations, nor in thy spirituall exercises, but respect me onelie with a pure intention, thou shalt quickfinde the way wherein woulde haue thee to walke, and the course which my desire is thou shouldest alwaies holde.
How we must imploy the giftes of God which we receaue to the benefit of others.
Will not haue thee (my daughter) to neglect those graces, and gifts which bestow vpon thee.
But take heed also that thou dost not seeke thine owne commendations in these graces, of mine, that thou dost not by them ascribe any thing to thine owne worthines, that thou beest no puffed vp with pride, that thou doost not boast of them, glorie in them, or desire to please thine own selfe by them, but imploy them al wholie to my glorie: remembring euer specially aboue all thinges, that of thy selfe thou art nothing, haste nothing, and art able to doo nothing.
And that whatsoeuer thou haste, thou haste receaued from mee onelie.
And that loue not to haue my giftes returne vnto me fruitles, and without dooing of any good, but with gaine and vsurie, as forewarned all men in the parable of tallences which spake of in the Gospell.
For as thine eye in thy bodie is not an eye onely for it selfe, nor is placed there onely for the vse and benefit of it selfe but to the end that it may help all the rest of the members to see: so what talents or gifts soeuer haue bestowed vppon thee, haue not giuen them for thine owne selfe onely, that thou shouldest reape the whole fruite and benefitte of them, to thine owne vse, but haue placed these giftes or good thinges in thee, for the benefit of other members of my misticall bodie, that by them thou mayest serue others, help others, and both gaine and draw thy neghbours to the knowledge of my will, and the dooing of my commandementes.
For peraduenture gaue not them those thinges which gaue thee, because in thee prouided, both for them and thy selfe also, as on the contrarie part, haue to the same end many graces from thee, which bestowed vppon them.
For in these thinges which bestowed vppon others, had respect vpo~ others, had respect vnto thee, gaue them not for themselues onlie, but for thee in the~, because bestowed those graces vppon them for thy benefit.
require therefore at thy handes, that thou employest my gifts to other mens commoditie, he pest other men most willinglie by them as much as lieth in thy power.
If thou canst doo somewhat, which they cannot, that so by this meane one kinde of charitie remaining in you all, may make of many of you one bodie: and whatsoeuer this bodie hath in one member, let him employ it to the benefit of the rest.
For euery member ought to make one another partaker of the gifts which euery one of them receiueth by reason of the vnion of the bodie and communion of charitie which is amongst them.
Let this consideration of my will make thee (my Daughter) chearefull to serue thy neighbours, glad to beare their burthens, meeke to suffer with them, gentle to comfort them, readie to succour them, and willing to reioice with them, that no enuy at all, no contention, no emulation, no seeking to please thine owne appetite, be founde in thee, nor yet that any of these thinges may appeare in thy fellowes, but that there may remaine betweene you perfect charitie, and the communicating of my gifts one with another, as betweene the members of one bodie: For thou hast nothing that is thine own.
For what hast thou that thou hast not receiued? Wherefore thou hast nothing, as saide, that is not mine, thou hast nothing that is giuen to thy selfe alone, that is, thou hast nothing that is giuen thee for thy selfe onelie, but all things whatsoeuer thou hast receiued, are committed to thy custodie to be altogether emploied for the benefite of the whole bodie of my Church, looke vnto it, for will require an account at thy handes, howe thou hast bestowed the same.
Take heed therfore that thou be neuer caried away with so profou~d a conte~plation, or thinke thy self so well so perfectlie contented in beeing with mee, but that (if neither the corporall, or spirituall necessitie of thy neighbour doo call thee away from it) thou bee ready to forsake thine owne consolation, the commodity of thine owne deuotion, yea, and the sweete exercise or matter wherewith the consolation it selfe is nourished, neglecting wholly to please thy selfe, bee willing to runne in hast to helpe thy neighbour for my sake.
For this is perfect charitie, not to seeke thine owne, but thy neighbours benefite.
And this charity is more acceptable vnto mee, and more profitable for thy selfe, then all the contemplation or deuotion that thou canst vse of thine owne.
Moreouer, remember alwaies that in all thy actions, in all thy affections, in all those thinges which either thou dost or makest choise of, or sufferest or seekest to auoide, may be thy beginning, thy middle, and thy ende, that whatsoeuer thou dost, or leauest vndone, may be for my sake, and that in the following of this course, thou seekest no other thing, but onely my glory, and the fulfilling of my pleasure.
For the deede is not so acceptable to mee, in respect of it selfe, when thou dost succour, or takest compassion vpon thy neighbour: but thou art in dooing hereof most acceptable in my sight, because thou dooest for my sake, leaue thy selfe, that is, because thou forsakest thine owne commoditie, and seekest to relieue thy neighbours necessitie.
For if thou dost any thing for any other respect, whether it be for fauour, friendship, or any speciall bond of kindred or familliaritie, or for any commoditie, or recompence which thou lookest to receiue.
accept not of it, but reiect it, although it bee neuer so great and worthy an act.
For accept of no sacrifice that is offered vnto mee, if it bee not offered for my sake, onely and wholly.
DOO with all zeale and earnestnes, as many good works as thou art able, hungring, and thirsting after iustice.
And let no man seeme vnto thee more weake and imperfect, more voide of all vertues, and more vnworthie of my grace then thy selfe.
Fixe thine eyes alwaies vpon thine owne defects, bewailing lamenting that thou hast so many imperfections, and wantest so many vertues.
But remember withall that it is not thy duetie, to thinke, and looke into other mens manners, what vertues they haue, what waies they walke, and howe they behaue themselues towards me.
knowe what haue giuen euerie bodie, knowe also what account is fit for mee to require at euerie bodies handes.
Imagine thy selfe in thine owne eies the basest, vilest, wickeddest of all men, and as it were meerely nothing.
Bee ashamed in my presence, if thou hearest anie man praise thee, or shew a good conceit of thee, and be sorry for it, because by it they doo me iniurie, in that they think well of thee which art so vile a soule, so vncleane, so vnthankfull, so full of offences against me.
Thinke thy selfe so vile, as that euerie man may lawfullie and with iust contemne and despise thee, and that thou maiest not think thy selfe iniured, or els wronged at anie time whensoeuer anie seeke to lay reproches or afflictions vppon thee.
For thou oughtest to receaue commendations or reproches with an equall contentment in thy minde, and without anie difference, but onely in accou~ting thy selfe altogether vnworthie of commendation, and moste worthie of reproche.
For as long as thou thinkest thy selfe to be wronged, as long as thou complainest, and dost beleeue that thou haste receaued anie iniurie, thou art not clearelie purged of selfe looue.
For thou shouldest not in truth, take anie thing for an iniurie, but that wrong which is done vnto me.
Submit thy selfe therefore so whollie to my will and pleasure, as thou maiest be as well content with euill as with good, with griefe as with ioy, which by any externall accident doth happen vnto thee in this world, remaining alwaies poore internally in thy spirite, hungring and thirsting (as saide) after iustice, and hauing a hart free from all earthly cogitations, and ready withall zeale and earnestnes euer to doo those thinges which agree best with my good pleasure.
(My Daughter) euen as the Hart desireth to come vnto the Fountaines of water, so let thy soule haue a desire to come vnto mee, thy minde be enflamed with the loue and desire of mee.
Hee that is oppressed with a vehement thirst, can think of nothing but of drinke onely, for whatsoeuer he doth, his burning thirst neuer forsaketh him, but stil prouokes him with earnest cogitations and continuall desires to haue some drinke.
In like sort if thou diddest loue mee perfectly, if thou diddest long for me vehementlie, thou couldest thinke of nothing els, but how thou mightest come vnto me, how thou mightest be vnited vnto me, there would alwaies remaine in thee such a hu~ger thirst after iustice, that thou wouldest neuer bee satisfied or contented with that which thou haste done to mine honour, how great soeuer it were, but euer grieued and perplexed in thy minde, with thinking that the same which thou haste done alreadie for my honour was nothing at all.
Thou wouldest alwaies endeuour thy selfe to doo better, thou wouldest alwaies thirste to bee more perfect, thy hart woulde euer burne with desire to be more neerely vnited vnto me, to honour me more, more fully to fulfil my wil good pleasure.
They which are inflamed with an exceeding an vnmeasurable loue towards anie man or woman, doo loath meat, drinke, and all other thinges, which seeme eyther for delightes to please them, or for necessarie vse to sustaine their bodie, and pine awaie, growe sicklie, if they can not enioye their desire, or if they finde and perceaue that they are not loued againe.
For they languish with meere loue, that maketh them, that they can neither take any ioy, nor receaue any co~fort, nor finde any rest, except they may obtaine that which they loue.
(O my Daughter) thou oughtest to loue mee in this sorte, that thou mightest finde in me onlie ioy and consolation, and without me in all places nothinge but sorrow and affliction.
If thou diddest rightly loue me as thou shouldest doe, thou couldest not be in rest vntill thou diddest possesse me.
For there would a continuall thirste, hunger desire burne within thy soule, not permitting thee to enioye anie quiet at all.
that thou diddest languish with such a kinde of loue towards mee, or that hating all other thinges thou diddest desire mee onelie.
that thou diddest present thy hart vnto me quite weaned, and clearely deliuered from all other loue whatsoeuer, that may still draw it after me, and both pearce it thorough and wounde it to the bottome with my loue.
Oh howe happie shuldest thou be, if being made quite besides thy selfe, and drunke with extreamitie of loue towardes mee, thou diddest despise all thinges els, thou diddest loath all my creatures, and diddest runne only after mee, crying vnto me, am wounded with thy charitie.
Thou oughtest my Daughter to be enflamed with so feruent an affection towardes mee, as whosoeuer did come neere vnto thee might perceaue no other thing els, but only the heate of thine affection towardes me, breathing out of thee, and whosoeuer did talke with thee might depart edefied from thee, and warmed with the flames of that affection towards me, which hee found kindled in thy soule, If therefore thou desirest to loue me, thou must loue mee with thy whole hart.
will not allow that thou shouldest loue me, and ioyntlie with mee anie thing els besides me, that is, that thou shouldest not loue any thing for anye other respect but for my sake onelie.
looke to bee loued purely, and that thou canst neuer doo but when thou louest mee, for my owne selfe, that onely no other respect, whatsoeuer be the cause why thou louest me.
will also be beloued with an infinite loue, and with an vnmeasurable desire, for thou shouldest neuer finde in thy soule anie end or measure in louing me, but although thou diddest loue mee neuer so much, thou shouldest alwaies desire to loue mee more.
For my loue is not restrayned within any limits· but it is infinite and without any bounds.
It neuer thinketh it selfe satisfied, it can neuer be filled or contented with any quantitie, though it bee neuer so exceeding great, it will euerie day grow and increase to be more.
For charitie doth alwaies encrease, and what is charitie but a good will.
As therefore a good will cannot bee restrained within any limite, and as it is without all end, so is charitie likewise.
knowe that thou haste a will to loue mee with all thy heart, and that thou desirest to loue me as much thy selfe alone, as all my holy seruants do, ioyning all their loue together.
This desire is good, if it procede not from an appetite of desiring, in respect that thou wouldest be more excellent then they, and singuler aboue them all, as though thou onely couldest loue mee as much as all they, when all their loue were put together.
It is a good desire say, if it springeth from pure perfect charitie only, that thou doest for mine owne sake, without any other respect, desire me, loue me, and wish still to encrease in the loue of me, and seeke to loue me as much alone, as it is possible for all other beeing ioyned together.
Haue care therefore that this desire of thine proceed not of any appetite to bee preferred before others, but onelye because charitie can neuer be satisfied or filled, that the greatnes thereof maketh thee thinke that how much soeuer thou louest mee, is much inferiour in thine eyes to that affection which thou dost desire to carrie towards me, and in no sorte either answerable, or agreeable to thy desire.
My loue is no idle loue, but it worketh great thinges where it is indeede.
And where there is no desire but an vnaptnesse and vnwillingnesse to doo good workes, there is no loue without all doubte.
And yet notwithstanding this, if thou wantest abilitie to do good workes, bee not therefore discouraged (my Daughter) or deiected in thy minde, for thy good will pleaseth mee as much as if the worke were done, and is as acceptable in my sight.
will not require an account of thee for that haue not bestowed vpon thee.
For it is not the multitude of workes, but the greatnesse of loue which delighteth mee.
Many good workes, if they bee presented vnto mee without charitie, doo pacifie me no whitte at all.
For what is chaffe to me without wheat? to whomesoeuer thou doost offer wheat, which is loue, offer him also chaffe which is workes.
For although regarde not workes without loue, yet will haue good regarde of thy loue without workes, so as thou be hindred by disabilitie, necessitie, obedience, or any other lawfull impediment, in such sorte as thou art not able to do good works.
For then (as haue saide) accept of thy good will: But where power wa~teth not, if loue remaine it doth extende it selfe, and exercise it selfe towardes me, and for my sake towardes her neighbour.
For haue placed him as a companion with thee in my steed, that whatsoeuer thou wouldest bestow vppon mee, and cannot, thou mayest bestow vppon him.
And that thou mayest doo it the more willingly, haue promised that will accept as well at thy handes, and rewarde as largely any thing that thou doost towards thy neighbour, as if thou haddest done it to my felfe.
For if thou haste charitie, it worketh so in thee, as thou louest him for my sake, thou beholdest me in him, thou seruest me in him, thou dooest mee benefits in him, thou dost beare with mee in him, thou dost suffer me in him, and if he offend thee, thou dost forgiue me in him.
And for this cause gaue him vnto thee in my steed, that thou maiest bestow these good turnes vpon him, as time and place serueth, and as thou haste oportunitie offered by mee to doo the same.
For thou must not forget that which repeated before, how charitie is not to bee measured or esteemed by the multitude of workes, but by the greatnesse and sincerity of thy affection, that is, by the inward deuotio~ of thy mind, ioyned with a pure, chaste, and internall disposition, inclination, intention of thy will, which the more readie, prompt, feruent, and desirous it is, to obey me, honour me, and please me, and the more that shee renounceth her owne selfe, in seeking to please mee purelie, without any other respect, and to preferre mee before all other creatures, the more shee is drawne to loue mee, and the brighter shee doth openly shine in all good workes.
if the children of men did know how much it pleaseth mee to dwell in such a soule, howe gladlie doo offer my selfe vnto her, which desireth mee onely, how bountifull do powre my selfe into such a heart as dooth seeke me only, with a pure intention beeing withdrawne and free both from the loue of her selfe, of any other creature beside, desiring me feruently, respecting mee whollie, staying for mee patiently, and refusing to be comforted with any other thing but with me onely.
Nay, such a hart as speake of, will not desire to bee comforted by mee, because shee thinketh her selfe vnworthie to receaue any consolation from me, but desireth onely to bee satisfied with hauing my good will pleasure fulfilled in her.
For she only desireth to doo, to suffer, and to bee in no other sorte then agreeth with my pleasure, then although such a hart neyther desireth comfort, nor any thing els, which is without mee, yet doo rewarde and enrich her with all blessings and benefits.
For there can bee nothing wanting in anie creature, neither can there bee any thing forsaken for the loue of me, that is so good, but that there shall bee found in mee things in steede of them, a hundred times better, purer, sweeter, pleasanter and more delightfull than they were.
For whether it be beautie, sweetnesse, pleasantnesse, delight, loue, truth, consolation, the continuall enioying of such thinges as men do like, riches, glorie, power, and innumerable other thinges of the same sort, which either may bring delights to them, or procure desire to them: all these thinges, are after an infinite manner more excellent, and more perfect in me, than in any creature whatsoeuer.
my Daughter, the smallest consolation which thou feelest by the presence of my goodnes in thy soule, doth surmount all the delights of the worlde, and the pleasure that can bee taken in any creature whatsoeuer.
Yea all other delightes beeing compared with it, doth seeme bitter and vnpleasaunt.
Wherefore, if things were measured by a true and iust account, it could not bee, but that men woulde loue mee better then themselues, or anie other creature.
But nowe (it is a lamentable thing to bee spoken) men doo leaue mee which am theyr greatest good, they despise my goodnesse, nay which is more, they forsake their owne true and onelye happinesse, and fall to loue themselues, to delight in the world, from whence all disquietnes of minde, and all other mischiefes doo proceede.
Alas, why are miserable men so farre deceaued? If thou delight in loue, why loue they not me? whose loue is chast, pure, holy, and simple, which am an obiect alwaies offered to their eyes of infinite amiablenes beeing essentially good in my selfe, being a pure good, vnmixed, beeing the chiefest and soueraigne good, where the rewarde of loue also is vnspeakable delight, and most blessed eternity, wheras the loue of the worlde on the contrarie parte, dooth breede nothing in thy soule but vnquietnesse, bitternesse, distruction, repentance heuines.
Leaue thou therfore co~temne al worldly things and desire me only, being vnited vnto me with all thy soule, with al thy hart, and with all thy will.
For as long as thou dost addict thy selfe to the loue of creatures, thou shalt finde that which is in creatures, that is, thou shalt be defiled and disquieted, with corrupt and vncleane delights, and yet besides that be neuer satisfied or contented.
And thou shalt also be polluted with vnpure imaginations, and be distracted with sundry cogitations, that be lewd and wicked.
But doe collect that hart which seeketh to bee ioyned with me, and vnite it fast vnto mee, procuring in it by my meanes all peace, quietnes, and all tranquillity of conscience.
Thou oughtest continually to intreat mee, and without ceasing to pray vnto me, that thou mayest after this sorte forsake the world, renounce the loue of all my creatures, and be wholie conuerted vnto mee, and inwardlie dedicated in thy soule to my seruice.
For no man can bestowe this grace on thee, neyther canst thou obtaine it by any other meane but by mee onely.
Wherefore thou must alwaies with great regard obserue the internall inspirations of my grace, thou must follow my counsaile, obey my exhortations, and commit thy selfe altogether to my prouidence.
My inspirations doo neuer disagree from the holie Scripture, nor from the obedience which thou must carrie to thy superiors.
Therefore if thou submitest thy selfe vnto them, and reliest in no respect vppon thine owne selfe: thou art sure to walke in all simplicitie puritie of hart.
Loue is an incomprable treasure, therefore should be the of the same, and it should neuer bee laid vp, but in me only.
(my daughter) where thy treasure is there is thy hart also.
If then thou wilt knowe what thou louest, marke what thou dost oftnest thinke vppon, what thou dost with greatest delight, willingnes harken vnto, what thou dost most feruently desire, what thou doost inwardly in thine owne appetite most seeke, and bend thy selfe vnto: for that is, without all doubt thy treasure, and therein thou findest sweetest rest, most quiet, and greatest contentation.
And both of them is thy treasure, both the thing which thou louest, and the loue wherewith thou louest the same.
But see into how great miserie, how great vnthankfulnes, how great infelicitie men doo fall by this meanes, for they do purchase to them+selues hell fire, with the expence of incomparable treasure which is loue.
For if men contemning me, fal to loue corrupt, vncleane, and fraile thinges, such as will quickly perish: they doo with the same loue, which they bestow vppon them procure vnto themselues eternall torment.
Let all my friends therefore bewaile and lament, this strange and vnnaturall kinde of dealing, that am cleane thrust out of the hart of man, for whome offered vp my selfe in sacrifice, and whose saluation did buy with my precious blood, that an other which is mine enemy dooth possesse it only to this end, that he may draw them with him into eternall destruction, into endles misery, and into vnquenchable fire.
BE alwaies inflamed (my Daughter) with a desire to praise mee, to loue me, to honour mee, to please me from the bottom of thy hart altogether, and by all the meanes that thou art able, and in such most perfect sort as require at thy handes, Carrie alwaies in thy heart so great a reuerence, so great a feare, so great a care, so great a loue, and affection towardes me, and for me, as thou mayest neuer doo any thing to displease or offende me.
And although it ought to bee thy greatest care, thy chiefest feare, thy speciallest labour, not to doo anye thing thy selfe, or to giue any occasion by thine owne negligence, that anie thing should be done to offend mee: Yet neuerthelesse, thou oughtest also to take as much care as lieth in thee for others, that bee not by them dishonoured, or offended, or that they doo breake my will and commaundement.
And thou oughtest to do this with a pure intention of meere charitie for mine owne sake without any other respect.
For there should euer abou~d in thy hart, a most faithfull, ferue~t deuout loue of me, which shuld continually flow with forcible streams euery day neerer and neerer towards mee, and it should carrie thee with so great violence, and runne ouer in such exceeding abundance, as it shoulde make thee most readie desirous to doo all thinges, that may bee for my glory, for the fulfilling of my pleasure, and it shuld possesse thee in such sort, as thou shuldest desire nothing so much, as to bee clearely deliuered, quite discharged, and altogether weaned from all loue, respect, desire, or inclination towards thy selfe, or anie of my creatures, and to keepe thy selfe in the same state, pure, cleane, chaste, and vnspotted to me only, desiring me with a pure intention, and no other thing but by this meane may haue my will, without any impedime~t freely, and wholie fulfilled in thee, by thee, and that onlie may possesse thee, and that there may bee no space or diuision betweene thee and me, but that thou mayest be close vnited vnto me, hauing renounced, and forsaken all loue, both of thy selfe or any other creature.
Desire likewise that my will may be done in all things, and with all men, and that all men may know me, loue me, honor me, worship me and serue.
Thou wouldest rather choose to suffer tenne deaths (if thou wert a faithfull spouse vnto me) then once to consent to any sinne, although it were but vernall.
For albeit it is not like that thou canst long stand in perfection without venial sin, yet thou must not in anie wise willinglie or of set purpose yeeld to any veniall sinne, but thou must euer be fully resolued in thine owne will neuer to sin againe.
And thou must fixe and settle this will of thine, in the hope of my grace, and not vppon my confidence in thine owne abillitie.
doo euer please and delight him that loueth me, and all my workes and iudgments seeme sweet pleasant to to him, and he neuer ceaseth to praise me for them.
He that loueth me need not study to find somewhat, for which hee might praise mee, for the loue which hee bareth mee will shew vnto him what may or ought to bee praised in me.
And to praise me is no other thing but by louing me, to thinke vpon me, and by thinking vpon mee, to honour me, and by honouring of me, to wonder at my workes, and by wondring at my workes, to desire that all men should extoll, magnifie, loue me.
My praise doth lighten his heart which loueth me with a pure affection, it doth reioyce his spirite, it driueth away all heauines from him, and withall it is a safe protection for him, both in prosperitie and aduersitie.
Whosoeuer spendeth his time in praysing of mee, it maketh him with all fortitude of minde to contemne all the mischiefe that the subtiltie of man or the diuell can practise against him.
howe delightfull a thing is it to my Angels, to heare the sweet songes of them which do continually praise mee (although it bee much more delightfull vnto them to assist their pure harts, and to help them in setting forth of my praise) for they see men vppon earth do imitate by this meane the order of the celestial companies in heauen, as though they had receiued here the earnest penny, or els some sensible feeling of eternall happines, which is only a continuall praysing magnifiing of my name.
For there is nothing that doth so liuely resemble the state of the blessed happines in the worlde to come, as the cheareful delightful voice of those which doo praise my name.
And touching my selfe, am of so great Maiestie and omnipotency, as stand in neede of no praise, and no praise can make mee more glorious then am already, neither is any creature able to praise and magnifie me as doo deserue.
Wherefore thou oughtest to thinke thy selfe most vnworthy to praise mee, neuerthelesse, desire yet to praise mee, that thou maiest know, and it may appeare manifest vnto thee, how that all humane praise is nothing in respect of my worthines, how am farre greater then all the praise that can be giuen me, howe all creatures when they haue praysed mee as much as they are able, haue done it much inferiour to that am worthie of, and therefore muste yeeld that they are altogether insufficient to praise mee.
And although that declare vnto thee, how that euerie creature must giue this praise to me, yet would haue thee especially to imprint this lesson in thy minde, that although thou dost endeuour neuer so much to praise me, (which thou oughtest at all times to doo with all thy force) yet thou shouldest thinke that thou haddest done nothing at all.
will tell thee (my daughter) what kinde of praise doth please me: vocall praise, (although would haue thee alwaies to vse it, with thy voice to performe it, whensoeuer thou art commanded by the precept of my Church to say or sing any thing) yet must needes tell thee, that it dooth please mee so much as that internall praise which consisteth in the spirite.
profound contemplation and perfect knowledge of thine owne basenes, a consideration of thine owne weakenes, how thou art of thy selfe meerely nothing, and a modest shame procured by the meane of thy vnworthinesse before my Maiestie: It is a most sweete smelling sacrifice, and a most delightfull praise vnto mee, because thou shalt be brought by it with a shamefast kinde of modestie, continuallie to looke into, and to despise in my glorious presence, thine owne vilenes, deformednes, vnthankefulnes, wretchednes and miserie, and bee also mooued to acknowledge howe thou art of thy selfe meerely nothing, and therefore bee desirous to humble and subiect thy selfe before mee, and euerie one of my creatures, and to be willing, or rather to wish to bee in respect of thine owne basenes, contemned, and troden vnder of them all.
Such a contrite and humbled hart can neuer despise, yea the sorrowfull groane of such a heart, is as muche sweeter and worthier sacrifice vnto mee, than a huge heape of manye wordes, a tedious multitude of vocall praiers only.
Moreouer, thou dost then likewise truely and righty praise mee, when am as acceptable vnto thee, for sending aduersitie as prosperitie, and when thou giuest me as many thankes, and remainest as deuoutly, and zelously affected towards me in thine owne will for the one as for the other.
It is not also the least praise that thou mayest yeeld me to beware of sinne, to take great paines in seeking after vertue, to thirst for the honouring and extolling of thy name, and to seeke only for the fulfilling of my pleasure, and the setting foorth of my glorie.
Besides this, it is a much purer kinde of praise, and more acceptable vnto me than any vocall praise, to keepe thy hart vndefiled, pure, and free from all vicious affections, from al slouthfull humors, from all heauines, vnwillingnes, and frowardnes in thy soule, to cleaue vnto me only in all peace, tranquilitie, and silence of thy spirite.
What motion soeuer thou feelest within thee (my Daughter) what outward accident soeuer do happen vnto thee, presently repaire vnto mee with thy heart wholy conuerted and submitted vnto my will, and wish that it may be turned by my grace to my greatest glorie, and highest praise.
by doing after this sort all thinges that happen vnto thee shall be for the furtherance of thy saluation, and euen nature it self by this vertuous custome shall be chaunged into grace.
Wherfore if thou findest within thy selfe any mischieuous, attempts of the diuel, any filthie temptations or horrible blasphemies, or doost senciblie perceaue in thy soule, the motion of any odious temptation whatsoeuer: endeuour thou to winne some profit or benifit to thy soule by the same meane, whereby thine enemie seeketh to doo thee a mischiefe, account it a benefit for thy soule, if it may bring thee to praise, glorifie me.
As soone therfore as thou feelest any of these temptations, come presently vnto me, and say; Lord my God, as often as feele this temptation, as often as it commeth into my minde, so often doo glorifie thee, with the praises of the whole court of heauen, and so often doo adore thee, to the confusion of this wicked spirit which assaulteth me, and to the honour and glory of thy name.
And in this place offer vnto thee infinite praises which he is not able to doo.
If it be a grieuous temptation which thou feelest, say: most mercifull God, although it bee very troublesome which suffer, yet will willingly endure it for the loue of thee only, and for thy honour, and if it may be to thy great honour that shoulde suffer greater and more grieuous temptations than this is, beholde offer my selfe ready with all my hart to doo it.
Let nothing mercifull God, seeme so troublesome vnto me, but that may desire aboue all things, to sustaine any thing that may bee for the glory of thy name.
If thou feelest any cogitatio~ in thy soule of beautifull, delightfull, or precious thinges, say: most sweet God, that proceedeth from thee which art most goodly, most beautifull, most sweet, most to be desired, and most worthie to be embraced, because thou art the greatest good, if it be thy pleasure.
will willingly want all thy creatures· will willingly forsake all consolation, that thou only mayest remaine in my hart, and mayest wholy possesse me: which art most beautifull, and farre more beautifull than all the fayrest thinges beside thee, which art most sweete, farre more sweete than all the best sweetest thinges besides thee, which art most to be desired, and aboue all to be beloued, because thou art farre more amiable, and precious, than all the preciousest and amiablest thinges besides thee.
Likewise if eyther thou hearest or seest any number assembled together, or as often as thou beholdest anie exceeding beautifull thing or great multitude of people, say so often in the day to thy selfe.
most good and most amiable Lord, Almightie eternall God, let thousand thousandes of the Armies of celestiall spirits praise thee out of mee, and let ten thousand hundred thousand of those that stand before thee, extoll and magnifie thy name out of me and for me, and let all the worthy supplicatio~s of thy blessed Saints make intercession vnto thee for mee, and let the beautie of euerie one of thy creatures, and the sweet harmonie of them altogether glorifie thee out of me for euer, and world without end.
Of the exercise of the loue and praise of God.
IF thou dost desire to loue and praise me with all thy heart, with all thy soule, with all thy force, and with all the abilitie that doth rest in thee, and desirest to perseuer in the louing of me, to the end, thou must of necessitie haue some exercises of loue, wherby thou mayest nourish it, kindle it, encrease, and maintaine it.
And for this cause keeps thy minde free, withdrawne, weaned, clearely deliuered from the loue of my creatures, and from all internall occupation of thy minde, or busines about them, and from all care and trouble of this present world, by lifting it vp vnto mee with continuall vehement, and scalding sighes, and enflamed praiers, burning with all zeale, and by aspyring, incessantly with most feruent desire to come vnto me, that is to say: by desiring to loue me most ardently, most perfectly, most vehemently, most faithfullie, and withall continually, yea, and thirsting also to please me, in all respects, to praise me with al zeale, with all fidelitie, and withall the sufficiencie that is in thy power, and to fulfill my will absolutely perfectly in all things.
To conclude, thou must alwaies haue a desire to see mee which am most beautiful, to possesse me, who am most blessed, and to bee with mee who am onlie able to graunt thee happines, being the fountaine from whom all felicitie doth proceede, in whome all sweetnesse dooth consist, and by whome all goodnesse must bee graunted.
For am of all thinges the sweetest, the best and the happiest, yea true happines it selfe.
Cleaue therfore alwaies vnto me, and bee neuer seperated from me.
Haue euer somewhat in thy minde which thou maiest meditate vppon, and which may enflame thee with the loue of me, wherby thou mayest thinke of my sweetnes and goodnes, and by wondring at it, magnifie and praise thy name.
Or els on the contrarie part, meditate vpon somewhat, which may mooue thee to bewaile, lament accuse, and reprehend thy selfe for thy vilenes, basenes, weaknes, infirmitie, inconstancie, or vnthankfulnes, or els that may procure the suffering euen with sorrow in thy soule from the bottome of thy hart with those that bee afflicted and dead, to make supplications vnto mee for them, for my vniuersall Chnrch.
Moreouer whatsoeuer thou art to do, or what thing soeuer thou haste to thinke or consider of, thinke of them first with me, receiue counsaile, touching them first from me, and discourse of them first with me, that thou mayest be brought by this custome alwaies, and at all times, (whether thou beest alone, or in the company of others) to talke with me, and to keepe thy hart still lifted vp vnto me, eyther by prayer, or els by praysing of my name.
Doo whatsoeuer belongeth to my honour, whatsoeuer thou knowest wil content mee, or is my will that thou shouldest performe, with an vnspeakable thirst to please mee, and with an insatiable desire to honour me, labour this by all the meanes thou mayest, and endeuour with thy help, with thy counsaile, with thy trauaile, by all the other meanes that do lie in thy power to aduance my glorie, that my name may be praised both by thy self and others, and that my will may bee fullfiled in all my creatures.
But in the meane time not withstanding, while thy outward man is thus occupied abroad, let thy inward man remain quietly with me, for thou must in no wise giue thy selfe so much to externall businesses, as that thy mind shuld be distracted, rnnne wandring after sundry cogitations, and that thou shouldest draw by this meane into thy soule, many fond imaginations, and vaine fancies.
But rather whilst thy outward man is busied, be thou recollected in thy spirit, and gathered close together in thy soule, that it beeing vnited vnto me, thou mayest euer eternallie remaine with me.
And when thou haste learned this lesson, when thou hast accustomed thy selfe to this course, no externall businesse shall hinder thee, no externall act shal hurt or withholde thee, (especially if it bee a good and modest one) from the me~tall exercise of the loue of mee.
But thou shalt speake vnto me, or rather be in thy soule peaceablye vnited vnto mee, as well at that time, as at any other, so long as thou dost (as haue saide) intangle thy minde with thinking of vaine and transitorie thinges, nor remaynest drowned in the cogitations of those externall businesses which thou practisest in this worlde.
For as long as thou hast a will to keep thy hart free from the loue of al creatures, there is no creature can winne or withdrawe thee from me, (although in thy outward man thou be troubled with neuer so many businesses, nor occupied with neuer so manie actions) if thou imprintest not the formes, the representations, the loue or delight of these thinges internally in thy minde.
Wherefore neuer complaine that externall good workes are an impediment vnto thee in thy louing of mee, or in the exercise of thy loue towards me.
For these thinges doo not hinder thee (as thou dost imagine, conceiue in thy minde) but thy inordinate affection, thy want of discretion, thy infirmitie, and thy euill inclination, are those thinges which doo hinder thee, because thou haste not as yet fully mortefied the~ al, for these do make thee not onlie, outwardly but also inwardly busied and occupied with thinking of my creatures.
Moreouer, thy minde being more and more distracted, deuided, and made more wandring, by the multitude of these conceits: is farre from being able to cleaue vnto me, nay it can not continue constant or quiet within it selfe.
But be notwithstanding no discouraged, if in respecte of brotherly charitie, or of shewing thine obedience, thou beest enforced sometime to be occupied, disquieted in thyrie inward man for my sake.
For cannot quickly amend wherein soeuer thou baste saulted for my sake, and repaire it againe with such aduantage and gaine vnto thee, that thou shalt be afterwards so much the nerer and with greater delight vnited vnto mee, as thou diddest thinke thy selfe before farther estranged from me.
But if thou finde thy minde so much distracted and alienated from mee, as thou canst neither recollect it againe, not yet returne and lift it vp vnto me, thinke not that it wandred thus in respect of that charite, which thou didest shewe meerely for my sake: but that thine owne wicked inclination hath poluted thee, and that there was somewhat hidden within thee, which mooued thee to this, whereof was neither the Author, nor occasion, neither yet was it any way procured by my meane.
Thou wert not belike circumspect and watchfull enough, therefore thou diddest suffer some humane infirmitie.
But remaine not long estranged or alienated from me, for am alwaies readie to receiue thee againe into my fauour.
Let thy mind therefore be euer occupied in holy desires, that no moment may passe thee, wherein thou dost not wound mee, seeke to pearce my hart, with the fierie darts of thy inflamed desires.
Bee assured (my Daughter) that thou canst desire nothing at my handes in vaine: For if thou dost desire mee, thou shalt finde mee, but if doo withdrawe and hide my selfe from thee for a time, doo it for thy sake and thy benefit.
For cannot choose, but graunt my presence to those that call vpon mee and desire mee: doo stirre vp these desires in thee, inspire thy hart with these motions, and therefore bee sure that will also harken to thy petitions and heare thy praiers.
For although it shoulde so fall out by the meane of my prouidence, as thou shouldest remaine vnheard of mee to the houre of thy death, yet it is vnpossible that should not at all heare a deuout praier, but will euen at that instant render thee an hundred fold for thy long forbearing.
Thou shalt then perceiue that will giue thee for one petition a thousand: Thou shalt then finde that thou art heard at my hands, when thou canst neuer againe loose the benefite thereof.
But in all thy praiers, let this be thy chiefest petition, to desire at my hands, that thou maiest possesse mee: For what is more holy? what is more for my glory, than to desire mee aboue all thinges, and before all things? Pray therefore alwaies for a naked, and only a pure, a most chaste a most perfect, a most earnest, a most watchfull, and a most faithfull charitie towards mee, whereby both thy selfe and all other reasonable creatures may cleaue vnto me with a resolute minde and with such a firme intention, as no accident whatsoeuer shall be euer able to withdraw you from me.
IF thou wilt obtaine mee wholly (O soule) thou must of necessitie altogether forsake thy selfe, and altogether cast off thy selfe; thou must submitte, and resigne ouer thy selfe to extreame pouertie, and the want of all temporall commodities and consolations, for obtaining of mee, who am the chiefest and greatest good.
Comfort thy selfe therefore, and bee not dismaid though thou be depriued of all humaine consolation, and thogh thou want all humaine friendship, fauour and succour whatsoeuer.
Consider how a stout Souldier, not regarding his friendes, his Countrie, his wife, his children, his quiet rest, his commoditie at home, doth forsake them all, and beeing a stranger in a forraine land, doth there daily offer his life to dangerous labours, to painefull iourneyes, to continuall watching, and to sundrie miseries and perrils, that hee may obtaine riches, and winne honor.
In this sorte must thou forsaking all things, be spoiled and made poore, depriued of all comfort, and of all my creatures whatsoeuer, that nothing may remaine in thee, wherein thou maiest finde any quiete, or that thou maiest possesse but me onely.
Moreouer, thou must exclude and bannish from thy selfe the formes, impressions, and memorie of all thinges, and thou must cleanse and purge thy minde of them all, and carrie about with thee, the image of mee onely imprinted in thy hart, wheresoeuer thou becommest, and how so euer thou art, either alone by thy selfe, or in companie of others: Thou must also whether thou eatest or drinkest, sleepest or wakest, speakest or be silent, alwaies looke into mee, as a pure glasse and most perfect patterne for thee to imitate, that thou maiest direct thy course of life transforme thy selfe according to the vertues and manner of my life: If thou eatest, dippe euery morsel in my woundes: If thou drinkest, take the warme blood out of my woundes, which will breath charitie into thee: If thou speakest, looke vpon mee which heareth thy wordes, aud beware that thou speakest nothing that is vncomely or may displease mee: If thou holdest thy peace, harken vnto me which do speake to thee, and search out with all dilligence and care what is my perfect will and good pleasure: If thou sleepest, leane and repose thy selfe vppon my hart, applying thy mouth to the gaping wound of my sacred hart, and sucke my grace thereby into thy spirite, and breath againe into mee, by sending a sweete smelling sacrifice out of it, the marrow and precious treasure of thy hart: To bee short, wheresoeuer thou bee, gouerne and direct thy selfe according to that most notable, most worthy, and most perfect patterne, which thou beholdest in the course of my life.
Looke into and desire earnestlie, with all zeale and affection to imitate my most modest, and most lowlie humilitie, my most curteous affabilitie, my most sweete meekenes my most stout patience, my most pure chastitie, my most pietie, my most faithfull prouidence, my most mercifull compassion, and my most seruent burning, exceeding and incomprehensible charitie.
Imprint the liuely Image of these things in thy soule, fill thy minde wholly with it, by the meanes thereof, bannish altogether from thy minde all the formes and imaginations of all other thinges whatsoeuer: will not haue thee to bee without the impression or the representation of some thing in thy hart, neither yet will haue thee seeke before thy time to flie higher than this.
Wherefore rest thou quietly in the meane space, in beholding the Image of my humanitie and Passion, vntill doo raise thee vp to a higher dignitie, where thou shalt not feele these motions, but bee wholly and clearely deliuered from any impression or imagination, and bee free from all exercise and action, and remaine in all peace quietnes, hauing cleane forsaken thy selfe, and thine owne appetite: In the meane time therefore meditate how am alwaies present with thee, and how doo looke and pearce into the close corners of thy soule, and into the deepest secretes of thy hart, and doo not onely meditate vpon it, but learne also to haue a sensible feeling of my presence, whereby doo alwaies beholde thee, alwaies marke thee, alwaies look into thee, and alwaies both fully know thee, and perfectly vnderstande thy greatest secretes.
Learne to conceiue howe am without all limitation, not possible to be circumscribed within any bounds, how am an vnchangeable an eternall, an vnspeakeable, and an incomprehensible light, howe am best worthie to bee beloued, howe onely deserue to be desired, and how am whollie pure and sinsere, not stained with the least euill, or smallest imperfection: Likewise, how am whollie good, in whom there is nothing but it is to be beloued, and able to delight all that seeke mee, howe am whollie most faithfull, whollie most mercifull, and alwaies ready most aboundantlie to communicate my selfe with the children of men.
To conclude, learne to know how am a most constant faithfull louer, a most sweete comforter, a most mightie Protector, and a most rich and bountifull rewarder of all those that beare me good will, of all those that loue me, and of all those that hope in me, and how am able to bring more delight vnto their soule, then all other things that can bee desired.
For neuer procure in them, but satisfie all their and by satisfiyng them daily more more encrease their desires in them.
Let this perfect Image of me, wholly possesse thy minde, and imprint it so deepely therein, that thou maiest not consent in thy will, to the meditation of any other fancies, but presently banish them from thee as soone as they begin to enter into thee.
Take heed that thou doo not receiue them within thy soule, but being free from them remaine vnited to me onely, in all internall quietnesse, and in all internall peace and tranquillitie, waiting for me continually most desirously, and without ceasing, that thou maiest repose thy selfe in all things vppon mee, that thou maiest follow mee, and that thou maiest submit thy selfe vnto any thing whatsoeuer, that will haue thee eyther to doo or suffer, yea vnto whatsoeuer wil haue done in thee, or with thee.
Thou oughtest so clearely to renounce thy selfe, that is, all loue of thy selfe, and all proper inclination to follow thine own will, as that nothing may be able to mooue thy reasonable and intellectuall soule, beeing now as it were) quite alienated and seperated from thy body, and that it may seeme all one vnto her, whether her externall and sensible man bee praised or discommended, be afflicted or comforted, and that she may looke vpon him (as it were) a farre off, beeing cleane deuided from him, and wholy vnited and ioyned vnto me.
To obtaine this seperation of thy selfe from the following of thine own appetite, and the loue of any creature, thou must of necessitie (as warned thee before) haue great watch ouer thy selfe, and straightly obserue by what meane thou mayest soonest find out and discerne what lieth hidden in thy secret thoughts, what mooueth thee, what draweth thee, what entiseth thee, what possesseth thee, what raigneth in thee, to conclude what thou louest, or inclinest thy selfe vnto, whether it bee thy selfe, or any other creature, or me.
And thou must thrust presently out of thy minde whatsoeuer thou findest there, if it be not my selfe, or any thing whereof am not the cause: for thou art then become subiect to the thing which possesseth thee, when it hath gotten a full interest and propriety in thee.
And for mine owne part will neuer consent to be beloued with a companion, but look for my whole loue, desire to remaine alone peaceablie in thee.
Therfore except thou seekest me only, thou shalt neuer perfectly find me, if thou wilt enioy me, banish al cretures from thee, suffer no diuision, no impediment, no seperation to ramaine between thee me.
Let all creatnres be banished from thee, but onely such as are for thy meere necessarie vse, let them haue no interest or place in thee, let them not possesse thy hart, that thou mayest keepe thy selfe free and pure vnto mee from them all, and maiest wholy submit thy selfe vnto me, and be readie to be disposed in all such sorts as it shall be my pleasure.
Whatsoeuer shal happen it is enough for thee that thou knowest it, findest that it hath happened.
Trouble thy selfe no farther with thinking of it, neither suffer it to stay within thee, or to leaue anye memorie or impression thereof in thy soule: But rely vppon me, commit all thy cares vnto me, passe and flie ouer the multitude, the variety, and the mutabilitie of these cogitations, and neuer fix or settle thy hart but in me only.
Seeke therefore mee onelie, and no more but mee in all thinges, which am one in all and all in all, and waite patiently with long suffering till thou findest me, yea, bee content to stay wait for mee againe, and againe, and neuer bee wearie of waiting till thou findest mee, reposing thy selfe vpon my goodnes, and vpon my most wise prouidence, full of all loue towards thee with a strong faith, and an assured trust therein.
When stay my comming, expect mee patiently, for will come at the last without doubt.
Bee free and altogether weaned in this sort (O soule) from all thine owne desire, be seperated wholie from all loue and delights in creatures, be alienated from all fancies imaginations, and cleaue wholy vnto mee, in simplicitie and nakednesse of hart.
Offer thy selfe to be possessed by me, and forsake cleane thine owne will, that thou mayest reioyce with me in all eternitie, where there are neyther thinges past, nor things to come, but all things present.
Aspire alwaies, and earnestly desire to obtaine this euen nowe, and forsake both thy selfe and all other thinges, that is thy body, and sensualitie, and haue thine eye so fixed vppon eternitie in this present world, as if thou wert quite seperated from it, and clearely deliuered out of it, beholding all the thinges in this world a far off, as those thinges which thou hast wholy forsaken, and from which thou hast clearely weaned thy selfe.
Thinke that thou art alone with me, and that am with thee, and as if there were no other creature present with thee.
Whatsoeuer thou feelest besides me, make no account of it, because it is in truth nothing worth being without mee, and no creature shall hurt thee as long as thou receiue not within thy hart the fancies and imaginations of any thing, nor yet feele any cares or affections within thy soule.
Deliuer these exhortations vnto thee, as to my Daughter spouse (O soule) and as a rule to instruct thee howe thou shouldest put off the olde man, and walke hereafter in newnes of spirit, and how thou shouldest daily bende and endeuour thy selfe with all thy force to grow to more perfection.
Therfore as often as by reading ouer these thinges, thou findest that thou haste not obserued all in suche sort as haue commaunded thee, or that thou haste faulted in some little part thereof, so often still renewe thy good intention, by stirting vp a newe of zeale in thee.
And although giue thee these to read: yet desire notwithstanding that the eares of my my hart should alwaies be open to my inspirations, whereby thou maiest not onely outwardly reade them, but inwardlie heare these from me.
And the reason why would haue these inspirations laide before thine eies, is because thou art for the moste delighted with vaine letters and messages from thy friends, which procure in thy heart nothing but distraction, an vnsauery kinde of disquiet, a perilous kinde of darkenesse.
Therfore when thou hast contemned these vanities forsaken them quite, haue giuen thee these wholsome instructions, that thou mightest haue some good thing for me to read, to occupie thy minde withall.
And that thou mightest by the consideration of the~, for the loue of me despise al other things which seeke to pollute thy hart.
And the more that who am thy spouse, gaue thee these lessons (O soule) ought to be beloued, the more acceptable ought this instructio~ to be vnto thee, which proceeded from me, that am not only worthie to bee beloued, but most worthie of all thinges to be beloued, deserue aboue all thinges most to be desired, yea and ought before all things most to please delight thee.
wold haue thee also the more faithfully to obserue these precepts, seeing all these things which haue deliuered vnto thee, are not to delight a carnall worldly hart, but a spirituall, and such a one as is deuout towardes mee, seeing they doo not please the eares with picked phrases, and trifling words, but they feede the louing soule with truth and holsome counsaile: It remaineth onely nowe to warne thee, that thou be watchfull diligent.
Open thy hart therefore vnto mee (O my sister, my spouse) giue mee thy hart, and desire me onely, seeing do so much desire thee, but assure thy selfe of this one thing, thou canst neuer receiue mee as long as thou louest any thing besides me: Thou canst neuer haue mee, as long as thou hast any thing of thy selfe without mee, thou canst neuer enioy me, as long as thou possessest thy selfe: Goe therefore out of thy selfe, and forsake thy selfe, that onely may possesse thee, that thou onely maiest possesse me.
This is a short time which is present, but that which followeth, is without all limiion of time, and eternall without ende.
Be watchfull therfore (my Daughter) do once againe exhort thee, receiue me for thy husband, soule, daughter, spouse, and shewe thy selfe in all puritie without all hypocrisie, or dissimulation, a spouse worthie of me· Loue me which am thy Lord and redeemer, thinke of mee, take heede to thy selfe, haue consideration of thine owne estate: Cleaue vnto me, and perseuer with me to the ende.
Liue happily henceforth in mee, and so bid thee hartely farewell.
THE INSTRVCTIONS that follow are very fitte and profitabie for all men: they are deuided into two rules, and may either bee called rules of direction for mans life, or else the fraternitie of the Disciples of Christ, that is to say, of such as desire to imitate the life of Christ, and seeke to liue after the rule of the Gospell, and doo studie with all their endeuour to attaine to the perfection of charitie.
IESVS CHRIST which was made man for your sakes, did preach vnto the world in times past, and did deliuer them one rule of life by my Gospell, for the saluation of them all, hee that beleeueth it can neuer erre, and he that obserueth it, can neuer perish.
For it onely is sufficient alone for the saluation of mans soule, beeing well obserued, and it instructeth a man fullie in all vertue perfection.
Wherfore if men did liue after that rule, there were no neede of the rules of Monkes, there were no neede of any fratermities, or associations, and companies of men, that liue vnder one rule and order, there were no neede of any Cannons whatsoeuer, seeing that they which did liue purely, and sincerely, after the rules of my Gospell, needed no other thing to instruct them in all perfection.
But after men forsooke the rule of my Gospell, and euerie man did only thinke vppon his owne proper commoditie according to the nature of men, it came then to passe not without my counsaile the direction of my spirite, that many of my Saints did deuise sundrie meanes wherby they might roote out of mens mindes the loue of the world, and of themseues, which made them quite forsake mee, and grow cold in the zeale of my Gospel, and my honour, and beside that they might restore vnto the world a perfect course of life howe to obserue my Gospell commaundements.
Therefore many of them haue set downe certaine rules, how to keepe vnder and cut off those Passions whereby anye occasion is taken to breake the law of my Gospell, and haue commaunded that those thinges shoulde bee straightlie obserued, which doo stirre vp, purifie, strengthen the spirite in all vertue and goodnesse.
For they knew that the spirite could neuer bee strong, and haue the vpper hand of the flesh, but by punishing it, and by flying all occasions of euill.
For when the spirit is strengthned, there will alwaies be in you a chaster, a feruenter, and a more constant loue or deuotion to keepe my commaundements.
And it is euident that these holye seruants of mine, for this cause had a will to appoint all things in such sort as might bee for the furtherance of men in following the course of my Gospel, and would not permit the smallest tittle that might be against the rule therof.
It appeareth manifestlie also that some which liued after them added newe constitutions and many ceremonies to these rules, and doo more seuerely and sharpely punish men for their transgressions of these ceremonies then of my Gospell, which is a very preposterous course, and contrarie to all good order: For a man is reprehended and punished if he speake out of time, if he sing out of tune, or if hee offend in any of these ceremonies: But had rather (although allow of these) that there should not be smaller but much greater care had of euangelicall preceptes, then of these ceremonies, and that there should bee a sharper censure against those that breake my commandement, then against such as offend in these ceremonies.
As for example, would not haue them goe vnpunished which sweare by my name, which backebite any bodie, which hate their neighbors, or do any such thing as my Gospell doth forbidde: For there must needs be appointed sharper discipline, and there must alwaies bee seuerer lawes ordained and appointed to punish those which doo breake my commandements, and for the obseruation whereof, the auntient Fathers in times heretofore did prescribe sundrie rules.
But what shall say? see that you in these daies doo neither obserue my Gospell, nor yet the rules of the auncient fathers: You boast of my words in your mouth, and of my Gospell in your common talke, but it appeareth manifestly, how farre am out of your hart, seeing you doo not loue me, nor my commandements.
Returne you therefore nowe (although it bee late, which haue walked so long in crooked paths with your harts vnto me, doo penance, and beleeue in my Gospell, doo not only beleeue whatsoeuer my Gospell teacheth, but by beleeuing it, and louing it, doo whatsoeuer it commandeth.
If you will be Christians, if you will be my Disciples, imitate me, learne of me, because am meeke and humble of hart, walke yee, as haue walked.
Moreouer, if you will bee Monckes, if you will be Priestes, or if you will bee religious men, doo those thinges which are of the spirite, and mortefie by the spirite the workes of the flesh.
If you be (as you say) Euangicall and followers of my Gospell, doo those things which my Gospell doth command you, howe long will you say vnto me Lord, Lord, and will not doe those things which say? Doe those thinges which commaund you, and shewe your selues to be my friends, not in wordes only, but in deed and in truth, for hee that heareth my wordes, he that hath my commandements and doth them, this is he that loueth mee.
And for stirring vp againe of that feruent zeale which hath bin heretofore in mens minds, for renuing the obseruatio~ of my gospell, which is almost worne out of vse: deliuer nowe vnto those which are my friends, and deuoutlie affected towards me, two very short rules: wherof of the one is very fitte for such as bee lesse perfect, and but new beginners in following of my seruice, and the other for such as are more perfect, and desire with all earnestnes to attaine to a most chaste loue of me.
Wherein there is taught no heape of ceremonies, or multitude of praiers, but a reformation of the conscience and inward man, and a deuotion of the minde.
There is nothing intreated of touching the collour or fashion of garmentes, but the desires and endeuours of men are stirred vp to the honouring following of Euangelicall obedience.
And there is one kinde of fraternitie made and set downe in this place, whereby the minds of many may bee vnited in one, and the intents of all such agree in one, and do loue and serue me.
No man is heere of necessitie bounde to vow the obseruations of those things, (although that a vow doth very much adorne, strengthen and enrich a good will) neyther yet doth it make a man, if men offende therein farther guilty of a fault, then the transgression of my law doth pronounce him.
But doo giue a Lawe, to all those that desire to serue mee, agreeable to euerie mans abillitie, and doo temper it in such sort, as euerie man being assisted by my grace, may keepe and fulfill it.
For my will is, that all men should be saued, and haue furthered them by my helpe vnto it, so farre as it was my good will and pleasure: And in this respect do often forbeare sinners, and wincke at their infirmities that are weake, least should breake a+sunder a broken reede, or should extinguish, or altogether put out smoaking wood: And therefore being desirous to gather together vnto mee, all those that serue mee, haue deuided them into two kindes: In the first place those that be weake and new beginners: and in the second those that be more perfect, and long practised in my seruice, and haue set downe such precepts for them both as haue chosen out of my Gospell, and are most agreeable to their state and vocation, An instruction or rule for such as bee weake and imperfect, and but new beginners in my seruice.
VVHosoeuer will vowe himselfe to be one of my souldiers, and to fight in my warfare, and giue me his promise in that behalfe; if he cannot at the beginning beware of all sinnes, yet let him specially beware of mortall sinnes.
If thou therefore desirest to bee accounted in the number of my faithfull seruants, beware of sinne, and cut off and flie all occasions of sinning.
Eschew euill, and do good for will neuer enter into a wicked malicious soule, neither will dwell in a bodie subiect to sinne: Neuer spare thy life or temporall goodes, if it may either deliuer or preserue thy neighbours soule from mortall sinne; for thou oughtest to esteeme more any soule whatsoeuer, (for the saluation whereof gaue my life) then thy bodie or temporall goodes, and ought to be more precious in thine eyes, for whose honour thou doost it, then thy corporall or temporall life.
Neuer giue thy consent therefore to any sin, but specially to a mortall sin, whether it be in thy selfe or an other.
Whatsoeuer thou wouldest not haue done vnto thy selfe, doe not to an other.
Vse no fraude, practise no deceit, doo no iniurie: And if these thinges bee offered thee, beare them with silence for my sake, or at the least complaine no otherwise of them but iustly, and after a iust and rightfull manner.
For haue commaunded my seruantes to prosecute that iustly which is iust.
Neuer requite euill with euill, nor reproche with reproche, neuer repay wrong with wrong, but suffer all for the loue of me, who when was rayled on, did not rayle againe, when suffered, did not threaten mine enemies, but did willingly submit my self to an vniust sentence.
Do thou therefore in like sort, if thine enemie hunger, feed him, if hee thirste giue him drinke.
Thou oughtest to loue thine enemie, and to doo good to those that hate thee, that thou mayest bee the sonne of the father that is in heauen, which dooth not good onelie to those that are good, but to the euill also.
Be merciful as thy Father in heauen is mercifull, giue almes to thy neighbour, if thou haste abilitie, or bestow daylie at the least one benefit or other vpon him, or some good turne, or some seruice, or some worke of mercie, or some deed of charity.
And thou oughtest faithfullie to exercise thy selfe in this exercise, in taking of compassio~, or succouring of thy neighbour.
For whosoeuer is merciful towards another, shall obtaine mercie at my hands, and whosoeuer shall doo any thing to the least of my seruaunts whether it be good or euill, will account it as done vnto my selfe.
If thou liuest according to the flesh, thou shalt die, but if thou doost mortefie the workes of the flesh with the spirit thou shalt liue.
Mortefie therefore thy desires, thy sences, thy members herevpon earth, that thou mayest not doo whatsoeuer thy carnall appetite doth prouoke thee vnto.
Thou shouldest euery day at the least no lesse then once withdrawe, restraine, and denie thy consent for my sake, to something which thou desirest or wherein thou delightest: And if there happen nothing that day wherin thou maiest bridle thine affection in this sort, yet doo it for the loue of mee as occasion is offered, in barring thy selfe from hauing, feeling, seeing, or hearing somwhat which thou much desirest, or to which thy concupiscence, and the curiositie of thy nature doth moue thee.
And although there is no other fruite to bee reaped by it, yet denie thine owne will in this point and kill this desire in thee, for the loue of me.
Thou must neuer sweare, but beeing enforced by lawfull authoritie for a matter of truth before a Iudge, thou must neuer speake of my name in vaine, or vnprofitably, or make a lye at any time.
Either reade, or heare Masse euery day if thy state or office will permitte thee, and doo it in the memorie and honour of my charitie, and of all my benefits which haue hertofore most aboundantlie and willinglie powred vpon men, and doo daily from time to time bestow vpon them: But if thou canst not heare Masse, say with the same intention the praier which taught my Disciples, and the salutation of the Angell to my blessed Mother, and offer mee vp to my father in thy hart, and with mee all those good workes, which and my seruaunts either doo or haue done for thee, and the vniuersall Church.
Thou oughtest euery moneth once at the least sacramentally to confesse thy sinnes, and to receiue the Sacrament of my blessed bodie, at the feast of my natiuitie, and resurrection, at Pentecost also, and at the Assumption of my Mother, and at the feast of all Saints, except liuing vnder some vowe, or in some Monasterie thou be restrained there, by the rule of thy life to doo the same.
Thou oughtest to adore me euery day earlie in the morning, beeing one God in Trinitie of persons, and to recommend thy to my protection, and to pray that would defend thee, and all the world from sinne.
He that is so simple as hee can not performe this, ler him reade with a deuout intention, a Pater noster, and an Aue Maria.
When thou haste no better mentall exercises by internall meditation, and by somewhat that may kindle a more feruent zeale in thee, say euerie day in the honour of my passion and my wounds, fiue Pater nosters, and so many Aue Maries, Moreouer, say euerie weeke in the veneration and honor of my mother, a hundred and fiftie Aue Maries, that is, three Rosaries, euery Rosarie contayning in it selfe fiftie.
Make also euerie day in the veneration honour of the Sacrament of my blessed body, two low cursies, reuerences or adorations.
One to giue me thanks for that charitie benefits which shewed towardes thee in my incarnation, death passion, in the institution of this blessed Sacrament.
An other to giue mee as much honour as lieth in thee, in recompence of that reproch which suffred at their hands that receaue my precious bodye vnworthelie, and do handle it impurely.
Thou must euerie day make two other adorations or curtesies, one to obtaine the fruite which dying procured for all men by my passio~, by the efusion of my blood, and losse of my life, which haue a will that all men should be pertakers of.
Thou must in this also pray that may powre my grace so into the hart of euery man, as they may receaue the same vertue, efficacie, and fruit of my Passion, which beeing vppon the Crosse and suffering there, wrought for them, and in such aboundant sorte, as by my death did offer it vnto them.
Thou must make an other kinde of curtesie, or some kinde of humiliation of thy selfe in my presence, to praise me and giue mee thanks for the efusion of my blood, and for all my mercies which haue at any time pow+red out both vpon the good and bad, and thou must pray for their conuersion, which are in damnable sinnes, and for the reformation of the Church; they that cannot conceiue thus much, let them say with a deuout intention, two Pater nosters, and two Aue Maries.
Thou must fast euery Friday, if infirmitie, weakenes, labour, necessitie, trauaile, age, or some other reasonable occasion do not let or hinder thee, or if it like thee better, thou maiest eate that day, so that it bee temperatelie, and very sparinglie, and that thou vsest no sodden meate at supper, whereby thou maiest punish thy flesh at the least a little, and bring thy selfe to bewaile the bitternes of my death and Passion.
Learne dilligently to know the co~mandements of my Gospell, and the precepts of my Church, when thou hast learned them do not break them, for the loue of any earthly thing what+soeuer.
An other Instruction or Rule, for such as with a more feruent zeale and spirit doo earnestlie labour to attaine to perfection.
Haue placed those in this second diuision, which forgetting cleane all things that are past, desire euer to come to a better and more perfect course, and therefore this rule shall bee for such as seeking to attaine to true perfection, doo couet with a longing minde to bee made one with me, and wholly vnited vnto me.
Wherefore whosoeuer thou bee, that desirest to serue mee with thy whole hart, and to please mee in all thinges, thou must not, with thy certaine knowledge and deliberate iudgment offend in any sinne, although it bee but veniall, and thou must desire instantly at my hands, with most humble and deuout praiers, that may keepe and preserue thee from all kind of sinne: Thou must bee holie, as am holie; thou must bee perfect as am perfect, thou must bee holie say in my sight, and when thou art so, thou must remember that it is not of thy selfe, but it proceedeth from mee.
Thou must not think otherwise of thy selfe, then of a most wicked sinner, that had infinite times deserued eternall damnation, if my most beneuolent and euer most readie mercie had not beene alwaies at hand to preserue and deliuer thee from it.
Walke in that vocation wherevnto thou art called, and liue according to the state and rule of thy vocation.
Obserue diligently, and performe faithfully whatsoeuer my holy Scripture commandeth thee, and whatsoeuer thou promisest with thy mouth vnto me.
It is also thy dutie, not only to enquire after my commaundements, but to seeke to know my pleasure in all thinges, and to aske my counsaile, euen with a certaine earnest desire to follow and fulfill them both· Lead a solitarie life, being seperated from all vnnecessarie businesses, from familiaritie, and discourses with men, and giue thy selfe to silence, solitarines, and prayer, as much as thy state will permit thee.
My Apostle sayeth, that the seruant of God ought not to be contentious, contend thou not therefore in words.
Abstaine also from euerie idle word, but chiefelie from all and peeches, neuer speake any thing, nor yet heare any thing of those which be absent, but that which is good.
And although that it may sometime be done with a good intention, to speake euill of him that is absent, yet neuer consent to speake or to heare euill of him, except the matter which is spoken of, be most certaine and apparant.
And yet if thou dost exceed in this, thou must not goe away vnpunished, but thou must enioyne some pennance punishment to thy selfe for thine offences.
Obserue sobrietie, in meat and drink, vse all my creatures with te~perance, that thou maiest bee made pore in spirit with the loue of me, delighting in no worldly thing whatsoeuer, but as a stra~ger man· looke vppon all thinges in this world with a pure and free hart, not subiect any way vnto them, but as it were passing lightly by them, and not hauing any desire to remaine with them.
Accustome thy selfe to shewe all humilitie, meekenes, benignitie, and pietie, towards thy neighbors, remembring and beholding me in euery man and frame thy selfe to deale so with them, as thou wouldest deale with mee.
For in truth take any thing whatsoeuer thou dost to thy neighbor as done vnto my selfe.
Thou oughtest to iudge no man, nor yet intrude thy selfe to dispute, or to giue thy iudgement of other mens matters and consciences whatsoeuer they be: except thou beest appointed a Iudge by mee, and so by the vertue of thine Office, art to giue thy iudgement therein.
And yet notwithstanding, if thou shalt see any man offend, and dost hope to doo him some good by thine admonition (or at the least hast no mistrust to make him commit more grieuous sinnes by the reprehension) thou maiest curteouslie admonish him that doth sinne, earnestly, and gently entreating him that hee would bee mindefull of his owne saluation and amend his fault: But if he seeke to defende himselfe, and obstinatelie contend with thee in maintaining of his dooing; doo not thou dispute with him, except thou haue hope by little and little to bring him to a better course, neither yet labour to defende thine owne speeches when it is to no purpose, but giue him place humblie without any anger and with all meekenes and quietnes.
Likewise if thou bee reprehended at any time without a cause, thou maiest if thou wilt gentlie and mildelie giue an account of thy dealing, but thou shalt doo better (except any scandall might rise thereby) if thou dost humbly aske pardon, and without any excusing of thy selfe promise amendment (as farre as thou maiest lawfullie doo without offending of mee) and with all thou maiest giue him thankes to shew thee charitie which did in this sorte admonish thee.
haue heretofore warned men in my Gospell, that if anye man will come after mee, hee must deny
For as in the denying of a mans selfe, the whole of a mans life consisteth, so by the loue of a mans selfe, he commeth euer to ruine and destruction.
Labour therefore by all the meanes that thou maiest, for the vtter denying of thy selfe, and let it be thy principall studie how to mortefie thine owne will in thee.
Thou must so dispose of all thine own matters, as thou mayest be readie eyther to do or omit thinges in such sort as thou shalt bee counsailed and aduised by some good man, or one that feareth God, if thou haste not a spirituall gouernour.
Do nothing of thine own head, chiefely in doubtfull thinges, where there may be danger.
And therefore thou must not procure for thy selfe any thing in seeking to please thine own appetite (except such thinges onelie as doo manifestlie appeare without all doubt to bee acceptable vnto mee) but thou must rather respect the profit of many, and thou must euer preferre before all thinges my honour, and committe thy selfe whollie to my prouidence.
will take care of thee, will take the charge vppon my selfe to prouide for thee, and let this bee thine only studdie, to behaue thy self in such sort, as thou doo nothing to the derogation of my honour, and the resisting of my good pleasure.
But to the ende that thy worke may bee more pleasing vnto mee, by the denying of thy selfe, (if thou liuest not in the monasticall course of life) thou mayest for the vndertaking and performance of this course, promise thy obedience heerein to a Priest or some other man that feareth me, neither ought the infelicitie of this present age, nor the impiety of wicked men, which doo slander and impugne vowes and promises made vnto God, yea euen such as are moste profitable for mans saluation, eyther mooue or discourage thee whit.
But thou oughtest to bee the rather enduced by this to rely thy selfe vpon my mercie, and firmelie to beleeue that which haue giuen thee an aspiration to haue a will to doo well, and to make a holie vowe, will also giue thee power and abillitie to fulfill it: For neither of them proceed from thy selfe, but it commeth from my grace both to haue a will to doo well, and to doo well indeede, and both to promise and performe those thinges which are profitable for thy saluation.
Choose a place that is secret and desire to liue hidd and vnknowne, and disclose not thy counsailes to euerie bodie, but to him onely who is the director and guide of thy conscience.
Bee not carefull or desirous to please men, seeke not for their commendation, or to haue a name amongst them, neither yet studie to doo any thing whereby thou maiest obtaine a great opinion, praise, or admiration amongst them, seeing that all things are proper to mee onelie, to which any praise or commendation is due; but endeuour rather so to bridle thine affections, as that thou maiest in all simplicitie and puritie of hart, thinke worse and more baselie of thy selfe than of any other, and be desirous that other men should conceiue the like opinion of thee; so as whatsoeuer thou dost, whether it be a thing worthie of commendation, or else such a thing as may make thee to bee contemned, and reproched of others, bee no more mooued with it (if it be not sinne) either inwardly in thy minde, or outwardly in thy showe, by entering into any passion, then thou wouldest bee if any other man had done the same; and boast nothing of thy selfe, glorie nothing in thy selfe, challenge and ascribe nothing to thy selfe, by the meane of my gifts, attribute no more to thy selfe for any vertue that is in thee, or for any good workes that are done by thy meanes, then thou wouldest do to a hatchet, or any other instrument, which is nothing at all in it selfe, and is able to doo nothing by it selfe, but if any thing bee done by it, it is by the will of the Artificer which worketh with it, and which could doo the same by an other instrument if it pleased him: For in that it is come to be an instrument, that it hath any thing in it selfe, wherby it may nowe bee imploied to some vse, it hath not this abillitie of it selfe nor from any other, but from the Artificer, who did frame it in such sort, as it may worke and doo somewhat; but without an Artificer, or one to worke with it, it lieth still vnprofitable, and serueth to no purpose.
In like sorte must he thinke of himselfe which desireth to bee my sonne, and to imitate my humillitie, and will vndertake to follow this rule of life, he must consider of his owne estate, how full hee is of miseries, defectes, sinnes, and infirmities.
Moreouer he ought to looke into euery man, respect those things only in them, wherein haue adorned them with any grace and vertue, that he may be brought by this consideration to acknowledge himselfe alwaies inferior vnto them all: And let him not challenge or ascribe any thing· vnto himselfe for those vertues, operations, and good gtes, which bestowe vppon him; but let him make no other account of them, then if they were in another, and let him giue the praise glorie of them all to me wholie without chalenging of any thing to himself therby.
And therfore thou which desirest to be a follower of this rule, must haue great care of thy selfe, and thou must so dilligentlie looke into thine owne behauiour, and bee so watchfull in all thy actions, as thou neither maist seeke any thing, nor bend thy selfe to desire or follow any thing besides me: that is, thou must desire nothing but my glorie, and the fulfilling of my pleasure onelie.
Wherefore in what thing soeuer thou findest thy selfe to beare rule, that is, in what thing so euer thou seekest to please thy selfe, or findest self loue to raign in thee, there thou must renounce thy selfe, omit wholy the doing of that thing (if thou hast no lawfull impediment to the co~trarie) seeing by it thou didst not seek to please me with a pure intention.
Thou must complaine to no man of those crosses which thou sufferest, except it be to haue counsaile at their hands; for thou oughtest to receiue all thinges thankefullie which sende thee, and to referre all thinges vnto mee.
Therefore howsoeuer the stormes of affliction shal violently assaile thee, or in what sorte soeuer aduersitie shall chaunce to ouerwhelme thee, haue thou a minde euer readie to endure all patientlie, beeing whollie subiect to me, and for mee to all creatures.
Endeuour with violence to represse these motions which rise vp against thee, labour cleane to forsake thy selfe, and be not moued with any passion against men, neither yet contende, dispute or resist them.
Seeke not moreouer meanes to auoid affliction: nor to deliuer thy selfe from them, but be content to receiue all thinges with silence in peace and tranquillitie, and with an indifferent minde, as willing to receiue aduersitie as prosperitie at my handes; And bee content to beare them with all quietnesse in thy soule, as long as it shall be my pleasure.
And when thou art in aduersitie, doo not seeke with a deliberate intention, that is, of sette purpose, for any consolation, though it be neuer so little, but commit all thinges vnto mee, and patientlie expect the euent, and end of all things from my hands.
Thou must confesse thy sinnes Sacramentallie to a Priest euery weeke no lesse then once, but thou must doo it to mee euerie day in praier, and that very often, with the sorrowe of thy hart, and with an humble accusation of thy selfe for thy manifold offences, and thou must offer thyselfe vnto me, ready in all things to set forth my glorie, and to fulfill my pleasure.
Thou must receiue also the Sacrament of my blessed bodie euerie moneth, once at the least, if thou canst not euerie weeke once or twise, and thou must not omit to make those curtesies which set downe in the former rule in the veneration of my glorious Sacrament, and in the memorie of my death.
If thou shalt faile in any of these thinges heretofore recited, thou shalt not thereby be guiltie of a newe fault by vndertaking the performance of this rule, neither shalt thou offend more by the meane of it, than another which liueth without this rule and fraternitie, but for euerie transgression which thou makest by beeing ouercome with thine owne inconstancie, doo not cease altogether from folowing this good purpose of thine, but enioine thy selfe for thy pennance and punishment to say one Aue Marie, or some greater pennance as thou shalt thinke conuenient: Thou must say euery night notwithstanding three Aue Maries before my most holie and glorious Mother: One for those negligences which thou hast ignorantly committed, and which thou dost not remember: An other to intreat mee by her intercession for the amendment of thy life, perseuerance in vertue and obtaining of my grace: The third· that the worshipping and honoring of mee may bee daily amplified, enlarged, augmented, encreased either by this rule by what other meanes so euer, that shall seeme best to me.
Vse such spirituall exercises as are most agreeable to thy deuotion, state, and nature, wherein thou maiest spend thy time profitably, and bee lifted by them in thy hart vnto mee, encreasing daily in goodnesse, and enforcing thy selfe from time to time to doo better and better.
He that will vndertake to followe this fraternitie or rule, and gouerne himselfe according to the prescript order thereof, let him kneele before the Image of me crucified, if he be alone, or had rather be secrete by himself, let him earnestly intreate mee that will vouchsafe to receiue him for my disciple, that will powre my grace vpon him, both strengthen confirm this good will in him so fully, as he may resolue constantly, vnremouably, to liue according to these rules directions: Let him also teach others, and gaine soules vnto me, and bring them vnto my seruice.
But if there be many that vndertake to follow these rules, they may exhort one an other in me, and may be vnited in brotherly charitie, by the meane of the likenes and vnitie they haue in their course of life, in that they all do follow this fraternity.
And let them not receaue euerie man at all aduentures into their societie, specially such, as there is no hope of the constancy of their mind, perseuerance of deuotion, least that their lightnes and instabilitie, which doo not endeuour to attaine to the perfection of that course they haue vndertaken, may discourage others in theyr good purpose, and make them giue ouer their holy intention.

Thou hast moreouer giuen mee a firme confidence to beleeue that thou hast chosen mee to eternall happines, wherein thou will manifest thine owne selfe vnto mee.
Oh, shall then plainely know and see thee my Lorde and God, shall loue thee perfectlie and most purelie, shall finde most blessed peace in enioying thee onely, and shall alwaies most sincerely praise and glorifie thee with all thy Saints: mercifull God confirme this, and performe this quickely in mee.
Lord my God for all the benefites that thou haste wrought, and shalt worke in mee, and in euerie one of thy creatures, bee all honour, glorie, thankes, duetifull seruice, hartie affection, chaste feare, and sincere loue to thy diuine Maiestie, world without ende, Amen.
mercifull God make me thankfull, and pardon mee beseech thee most gratiouslie, for all those abhominable ingratitudes, intollerable negligences, innumerable sinnes, which haue committed against thee: (And if thou hast communicated, thou maiest adde to this and say) for thine owne sake, and by the vertue of thy blessed Sacrament which haue receiued, roote out of my hart all mallice, graunt me an humble confession, a hartie sorrow, a discreet abhorring, a zealous forsaking and a necessarie detestation of all my sinnes, and both true repentance and a perfect amendment in this life.
Graunt also that may neuer againe offende thee, for thine vnspeakeable mercie, and infinite goodnes, and make mee to loue with all the affection that it is possible for me, thy most sweete friendship, thy most precious grace, excite mee most earnestlie to desire it, and quickly to finde it, with perseuerance, therein euen to the ende.
mercifull God, graunt that may not neglect this goodnes and long suffering of thine: Strengthen mee alwaies both in soule and bodie to doo thee seruice, and graunt mee thy grace that may soberlie vse thy creatures, to the glory and praise of thy name.
giue thee thanks, Lord Iesu, thee holie Ghost, being equall with the eternall Eather, which wert content for my saluation, to be conceiued of the same holie Ghost, and to bee borne of the most pure Virgin Marie, and to be made man.
What doo owe thee, and how much am bound vnto thee Lord Iesu? GOD which wert man, man which wert God, Messias, Christ, the annointed of our Lord, Emanuell, God with vs, Lord of exceeding Maiestie, and most constant louer of men, howe wert thou made a mortall man, subiect to a mortall life, to sheddings of thy blood, to persecutions, to sorrow, to paines, and chiefely to the torments of the Crosse, when thou wert made poore and miserable, and most vile and in the sight of men.
What shall render vnto thee, sweet Louer, for that most bitter death which thou sufferedst for me, and for that vnspeakable charitie which thou shewedst towards me? beseech thee Lord Iesus, by thy incarnation, by thy remaining in the Virgins wombe, by the ioy of thy soule, at the grace of thyne when thy diuinity and humanitie were ioyned in one, by thy Natiuitie in winter time, by the paine of thy circumcision, by the veneration wherewith the Sages did adore thee, by the presentatio~ in the temple, by thy flight into Egipt, by thy banishment there, by thy fearefull returne againe into thine owne country, by thy subiection, obedience, most vertuous life, by the pennance which thou diddest for our sins, by thy baptisme, fasting, and temptation in the wildernes, by thy penurie, pouertie, necessity which thou enduredst in this mortall life, by all the troubles which thou feltest, by thy most gracious, vertuous and glorious life, by that ingratitude thou diddest endure at the Iewes hands, when they would haue throwne thee downe headlong from the top of the hill, when they sought traiterouslie to entrap thee in thy wordes and deedes, and when they did deuise howe to stone thee with their violent hands.
beseeche thee also by thy modestie, humilitie, patience, meekenes, all the other vertues, by thy humiliation of thy selfe at thy disciples feete, when thou washedst them, by the institution of thy moste blessed Sacrament of thy precious bodie, and by the most delightfull taste, vnspeakable sweetnes therof, by thy sadnes, agony, blody sweat which thou didst indure, whe~ thou praiedst in the grade~· by thy being forsaken of thy disciples all me~, by thy being betraied by thy own seruant, by the bands, reproches, iniuries, buffets, blowes, spiting vpo~ blasphemies which thou didst suffer, by the false accusation, vniust condemnation which thou receauedst, by thy greefe for Saint Peters denying thee, Iudas betraying thee, and the other Disciples forsaking thee, by thy being led vnto diuers Iudges, to receaue the sentence of death, by the mockerie, nakednesse, scourging of thy body, crowning of thy head, and vexing of thy innocent soule: by thy being reiected when Barabas was excepted, by the vniust sentence of the Iudge, by thy being led with theeues, by the carrying of thy Crosse, by the mockery of thy aduersaries, by the shamefulnes of thy death, by the lamentation which deuoute persons, but chiefely thy Mother made for thee, by the toile and wearines which thou sustained, by the bitter drinke which thou tasted, by the plucking of thy flesh, with the plucking of thy garments which thou endured, by thy being stretched out on the Crosse, by thy nayling to the Crosse, and the torments which thou there receaued, by those blessed teares which thou didst shedde, by those intollerable iniuries which thou didst patiently beare, by thy most holy praier, by the commiseration which thou tookest of the theefe that said.
By the compassion of thy mother, by thy crying thou wert forsaken, by thy drinking of Vineger Galle, by thy saying al was finished, by thy most cruell death, by thy vnspeakeable charitie wherewith thou suffred it, by the pearcing of thy side, thy mother looking on, by thy holie buriall, by the heauines of thy friendes, by thy resurrection, by thy appearing to the~ againe, by thy assention, by the sending of the holy Ghost, by the institution and foundation of thy Church, by the assumption of thy mother, by the glorification of thy Saints, by thy last iudgment, and by the eternall saluation which thou wilt graunt to thy seruantes soules and bodies.
Thou diddest rise againe from death triumphantly, thou diddest appeare to thy Disciples gloriously, thou diddest reioyce their harts wonderfullie, thou diddest ascend vp into heauen in their sight miraculouslie, thou diddest send the holy Ghost to direct thy church, thou diddest gather vp thy seruauntes vnto thee, thou didst assume thy blessed mother to thy eternall kingdome, thou shalt come to iudge the quick the deade, thou shalt raigne with all thy Saints world without end, and remaine with thee, sweet Iesu.
What shall render vnto thee, gracious louer, for that most bitter death which thou sufferedst for me, for that vnspeakable charitie which thou shewedst towards me? good Iesu make me beseech thee partaker of all thy merits and mercies, make me thankful for them, and in recompence of them to loue thee againe which loued mee so much, and euen to be readie to die for thy loue.

¶A HYMNE OF THE LIFE and Passion of our Sauiour Christ, made after the manner of an Alphabet, euerie verse beginning with euerie Letter, as they follow one another in order in the Christ crosse rowe.
ALmightie Lord whose loue to vs, was greater then we can expresse: Which sufferedst death our soules to saue, and ledst thy life in all distresse.
Graunt that thy loue wherewith for vs, thou meekelie didst these torments beare: May keepe vs from those dreadfull paines, which for our sinnes we iustly feare.
BEnd down sweet Christ those gratious eies which we from thee doo still expect: Thou with thy blood hast vs redeemde, thy seruants sute doo not reiect: Extend to vs thy mercie here, that on this earth in danger liue: Remit those faults which we haue made, and all our sinnes doo thou forgiue.
COme downe to vs which for our sakes, vouchsafte to leaue thy glorious seate, And taking here on thee our flesh, didst suffer oft both cold and heate.
With hunger, thirst, and bitter scornes, with taunts, reproch and all disdaine: The which of loue to worke our good, thou wert content for to sustaine.
DEliuer vs from pride Lord, which humblie washt thy seruants feet: And scornde it not to make them know, how humblenes for them was meete.
And when as thou away had washt, the foulenes of their inward skinne: Thou gauest them thy bodie straight, to comfort then their soules within.
EXcite our harts to honour thee, by thinking of those dreadfull feares: Which in the mount perplext thy minde, where thou didst pray with flouds of teares.
Then vnto thee an Angell came, ere that thou hadst thy praier done: When as thy blood like drops of sweat, in streames from thee along did runne.
FAlse Iudas there did thee betray, then sought thy foes to take thee straight: And seeking thee to them thou wentst, which for thy life did lie in waight.
But they like men cleane voide of grace, where meekenes could no mercie finde: First puld and hald thy sacred flesh, and after fast thy hands did binde.
GOod Iesus how art thou opprest, thy seruants flie and leaue thee quite, Thy cruell foes on thee doo runne, like Wolues on Lambes with all despite.
With whips they scourgde thy tender skinne. they spit vpon thy glorious face: Thy cheekes they boxe, thy eies they blinde, and with reproch they thee disgrace.
HOw meeke wert thou then after this, thine actions it did still bewray: Before the Iudge they thee accuse, and thou no word at all didst say.
And when thou spakest they blasphemde, thy holie speech they did deride: They puld they halde and thee condemde, none of thy words they could abide.
IN white thou wert for mockery clad, at thee to iest each waie they sought: And in that robe of greater scorne, thou after wert to Pilate brought.
As Iudge he sate, the people there, with open throte did often crie: Loose Barabas the murtherer, and on the Crosse let Iesus die.
KEepe vs from care of mens reportes, by seeing thee thus farre abusde: In that they chose a wicked wretch, when thou by them wert cleane refusde.
And kill in vs all carnall thoughtes, by thinking of thy grieuous paine: When as thy flesh with whips was torne, and streames of blood ran out amaine.
LOrd, Lord, what paines didst thou endure? one might thee now all bloodie see: And swolne with printes of those same stripes, which these vile men had laid on thee.
And not content thy head they crownde, with pricking thornes to make thee finde: In euerie part most grieuous paine, and to afflict thy patient minde.
MEeke as a lambe these wrongs thou bare, and mildely all their taunts endurde: Not once in speech reproouing them, which had to thee such harmes procurde.
Thou wert not mooude when as thy foes, did thee salute inscornefull wise: Nor when they spat vpon thy face, and with contempt did thee despise.
NO pittie did they take on thee, in suffering of this cruell paine: But more and more thee still reuilde, with scornefull spight and all disdaine.
Thy life (sweet Lord) to haue thee loose, that was their sute and only crie: Naught els could slake their blody thirst, but needes they must haue thee to die.
OBedient straight to die thou wert, and with despight thee more to scorne: Vpon thy backe thy Crosse they laid, which was with whips so fouly torne.
And when thou wert condemde to make, this sacrifice for all our sinne: Thee with two theeues for spight they ioynde, which all their life had graceles bin.
PAst halfe the way thou wert not gone, when as this waight did vexe thee sore: man by blood the steps might finde, which thou hadst past along before.
Her weeping eies thy mother cast, on thee in this thy deepe distresse: Which looke did both your harts reioice, and made thy paines to seeme the lesse.
QVite roote sweet Iesus out of vs, thinges that may displease thy minde: To make vs thankfull for thy loue, which by these paines we plainelie finde.
For they of thee a spoile to make, puld off thy clothes by force at last: And pulling them puld off the skinne, which to thy clothes then cleaued fast.
REuiling thee King of Kinges, they neuer left all voide of shame: For when thou wert vpon the Crosse, they iested at thy holie name.
Betweene two theeues yet hanging there, in suffering death to ransome vs: Thou ceasedst not for those to pray, which did reuile and vse thee thus.
SAluation there thou promised, vnto the theere that it did craue: And willed Iohn whome thou didst loue, of Marie still all care to haue.
Vnto his charge thou her bequeathd, but she to see thy grieuous paine: With bitter panges of griefe did feele, her wofull hart quite cut in twaine.
THou crydst my God in this distresse, why dost thou cleane me now forsake: And to encrease thy paine the more, they gaue thee gall thy thirst to slake.
Yet yeelding straight to him thy soule, thy trust in him thou plainely showd: And then a wretch thy side did pearce, from whence both blood and water flowde.
VNhappie were thy friends Lord, to see thee with this torment kild: But thou againe the third day rose, whereby their harts with ioy were fild.
And in their sight with triumph didst, ascend to make them know: That thou wilt there all those reward, which serue thee here on earth below.
ZIn was the cause of euerie griefe, which thou sweet Iesus didst sustaine: Keepe vs therefore from sinne Christ, that we may scape eternall paine.
Lord wash vs with thy precious blood, let vs with sinne not spotted bee: That we in heauen with all thy Saints, for euer may sing praise to thee.
YEeld vs no pray vnto this world, but giue vs grace to praise thee still: Both with our mouthes and in our harts, to honour thee with all good will.
Make with thy loue our harts inflamde, imprint it deepe within our minde: And make vs alwaies thirst for thee, that we with thee all ioy may finde.
ZEale euer keepe in vs Lord, of seruing thee and dooing well: That we may walke in vertues path, and from our thoughts all vice expell.
Sweete Iesus still inspire our harts, with lightning of thy holie Ghost: And guide vs in that happie course, which may content and please thee most.
Hymne wherein the praise of all creatures are offered vp vnto the Creator.
Christ the glorious Crowne, of Virgins that are pure: Which dost a loue for thee to thirst, within their mindes procure.
Which are the spouse of those, that chast and humble bee: The hope, the life, the onely helpe of such as trust in thee.
Which euer louest best a chast and spotles minde: And thee to loue commaundest those, in whom thou both dost finde.
To serue thee sweet Lord, thy creatures all are prest: And for to sound thy praise withall, that in their might doth rest.
All Angels with their troopes, all Saints that are aboue: Doo laude thee still and neuer cease, with songes of feruent loue.
The Skie, the Land, the Sea, and all on earth below: The glorie of thy worthie name, doo with their praises show.
All Virgins puritie, which made thy life their guide: All pietie of humble harts, abhorring filthie pride.
All Martirs constancie, which did this world despise: All true remorce that they declare, which doo from sinne arise.
All charitie of those, whose soules thy loue doth warme: All simple plainenes of such mindes, as thinke no kinde of harme.
All sweet delights wherewith, the pacient harts abound: Doo blase thy name, and with thy praise, they make the world resound.
The thunder showes thy power, and lightning which we see, The snow and raine with wonder tels, that none is like to thee.
The winter yeelds thee praise, and Summer doth the same: The Sun, the Moone, the starres and all, do magnifie thy name.
The beast, the fish, the depthes, that in the Sea remaine: With chearefull voice set forth thy praise, and shew thy glorie plaine.
The pearles the precious stones, the birds thy praise doo sing: The woods the welles and all delights, which from this earth doth spring.
The earth it selfe declares, thine honour and thy state: It doth bewraie how thou for vs, didst all these thinges creat.
The flowers fruits and trees, the men which thou didst frame: And women eke inuite vs still, to praise thy holy name.
The roses that appeare, so faire in outward sight: The violets which with their sent, doo yeeld so great delight.
The Lillies that bring forth, so pure and white a flower: With sweet Poungarnets doo extoll, and praise thy mightie power.
What creature sweet Lord, from praysing thee can stay, What earthly thing but fild with ioy, thine honour doth bewraie.
Let vs therefore with praise, thy mightie workes expresse: With hart and hand, with minde and all, which we from thee possesse.
Christ whose glorious power, doth far and wide extend: All creatures praise thy holie name, and doo thy workes commend.
So goodly to behold, so pleasant and so sweet: So faire thou art as all this praise, for thee of right is meete.
Thou art that firme delight, which neuer will depart: The chaste, the true and only ioy, of euerie faithfull hart.
The rayser vp of those by grace, which doo their sinnes repent.
Lord our life and health, our whole and surest trust: Remit our faults for we haue beene, most wicked and vniust.
Forgiue vs our misdeedes, remoue them from thine eyes: Giue vs thy grace, that we by it, may earthlie thinges despise.
Graunt that all worldly ioyes, to vs may better seeme: And that we may her vaine delights, as filthie dung esteeme.
Transforme vs vnto thee, and so our harts inflame: As we our force and life may spend, in praising of thy name.
Grant that in louing thee, we constant may abide: That thee alone we may desire, and all thinges hate beside.
That all in all to vs, thou maist for euer be: And that forsaking cleane our selues, we still may cleaue to thee.
Flow thou into our soules, with streames of thy delight: Possesse vs whole and carnall thoughts, may be surpressed quite.
Let nothing vs content, that may thy minde offend: Let all our ioy and whole delight, on thee alone depend.
Make vs in louing thee, to languish with desire: And burne as with the flaming heate, of that most sacred fire.
That we for thee may thirst, and thou maiest vs possesse: And that we may alone of thee, in all our life expresse.
To thee make vs to runne, with a desirous minde: And senceles els to euerie thing, that here on earth we finde.
Let vs in thee whole drownde, reioice with happie peace: And let vs sleepe in thee sweet Christ, whose ioy doth neuer cease.

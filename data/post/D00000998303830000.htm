the good and faithful servant
epigraph

matthew
his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord

as it was said of the woman that came with a box of ointment of spikenard to pour on the head of jesus before his death she did what she could she came aforehand to anoint his body to the burying she took the best way that she could think of to express her affection and respect to him mark

so am come aforehand anticipating a little the funeral of our dear friend to do what can to improve so sad a providence for the benefit of his surviving friends and to spread abroad and preserve the sweet savour of his name which is as a precious ointment eccles

when he is gathered to his fathers
as under

the old testament god multiplied visions and used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets hos
so under the new testament christ spake very often to the multitude in parables matth

this being a very useful way of teaching
some call images laymens books because they suppose they represent things so clearly and plainly to the meanest capacities but tho god is a spirit and requires spiritual worship yet he hath thought fit to represent spiritual things by natural so that as it is said the invisible things of him are seen clearly from the creation of the world rom
and if we do undersland that of the time ever since the creation yet the words following are to be understood of the works of creation
but not only the things that are made represent to us god's eternal power and godhead but all things that are done or transacted in the world serve to represent spiritual things to us and while we have such a teacher as christ to instruct us in the resemblance that is betwixt these things they may be of much use to us to help our understandings and memories to quicken our affections and to invite and draw our thoughts to heavenly things so as we can hardly be about any worldly business but we may take occasion from thence to raise up our minds to heavenly things which is a great advantage to us because we have so little command over our thoughts and because all our actions have their first rise from our thoughts out of the heart proceed first evil thoughts and thence murders adulteries fornications matth


before proceed further will premise that in similitudes the scripture is very brief and

concise so that there is not only an omission sometimes of the note of similitude which doth frequently occur in scripture but the protasis and apodosis as they are called are confounded together and not set exactly one against another or explained one by the other as prov
a fair woman is not as a jewel of gold but beauty in a foolish woman as a jewel of gold in a swines snout so john
he that is born of the spirit is not like the wind but in the business of regeneration the spirit works freely invisibly yet effectually as the wind blows
sometimes that only which belongs to the protasis or former part of the similitude is expressed without that in the latter part of the similitude which answers thereto as luke
let your loins be girded about and your lights burning
we need not busie our selves to find out what are these loins that should be girt and those lights that should be burning for those expressions belong to the persons that we should be like to as those that wait for their master's coming from a wedding should not only be up and have their cloths on but should have those garments girded about them which were much like morning gowns which they could not well either run in or do service in unless they were girt about them as you may see by kings
and luke
so they should not only have their lights or lamps by them but have them ready lighted that they might not make their masters stay when they knocked till they were prepared to wait on them but that they might open to them immediately so we should not only be in a habitual preparation for death by being in a state of grace but in an actual preparation for it having our evidences for heaven ready our hearts

weaned from the world a clear prospect of suture glory and being always so employed as death may not surprize us idle or doing that which is evil
have spent so many words on this thing because it may be of use to us for the right understanding of this parable out of which the words of the text are taken wherein he instructs his disciples how they thould carry themselves in his absence the time of his departure from them being now at hand
we have this parable differently set down here and in lu
for it is here in the evangelists as it is in the books of samuel kings and chronicles in the old testament what is omitted in one book is set down in another so that put together they make the history more compleat therefore the greek translators of the old testament call the books of chronicles paralipomena or praetermissions because many things are added in them which were omitted in the foregoing books
in luke he plainiy foretells what he should meet with from the jews and how he should be rejected of them but in both he is compared to one going from home and leaving his servants
luke saith a noble man going to receive a kingdom he must indeed be a great man that gave so many talents to his servants to trade with till he came back again
the parable plainly shews that he gave to some more to some less according to their places and abilities
luke saith pounds but the evangelists have regard rather to the sense and meaning of christ than to his words they both imply that he gave different summs of money or portions of goods now when they come to give an account of the improvement of what he had committed to their trust the first had doubled his stock or what he was trusted

withal and here in the text we have his lords approbation of what he had done and his liberal rewarding of his diligence and faithfulness
it was but little in comparison which he had trusted him with but he should be ruler over much as he that had been faithful in the administration of the affairs of the houshold should be made steward of all his masters estate mat in luke it is have thou authority over ten cities having respect as said before rather to the meaning of christ than to his words and therein it is likely he alludes to the honour wherewith princes or conquerours use to recompence the signal and eminent service of those that have acquitted themselves well under them preferring them to the govenment of some great places or cities and such an one should have rule over many cities still observe that these expressions have respect to the protasis or former part of the similitude


as for those words enter thou into the joy of thy lord if they be referred to the protasis they only signifie that he should enter upon or take possession of that honour or preferment which he should promote him to or delight to confer upon him as ahasuerus would know what should be done unto the man to whom the king delighted to honour est
come now to the spiritual meaning of this parable or that which is hereby signified
now it is agreed on by all that the scope of the parable is to shew that christ being gone to heaven hath given variety of gifts to men which they are to improve for him in his service for his glory which he will require an account of when he comes to judgment
men have from this parable learned to call them talents in their ordinary speech but in strictness they might as well have called

them pounds from the parallel place in luke yet dislike not the use of the word in this case because it is not so common a word as pound nor used in so many cases and the use of this word may put men in mind of the end and use of those various gifts which they have received
now by these gifts we do not understand only those gifts which he gave unto men at his ascension eph
the various kinds whereof the apostle mentions rom
cor but those manifold gifts of god or graces which are but gifts freely given as they are called pet

whereby we are capable or qualified to do good to others or service to god
the philosophers use to distinguish them into the goods of the body of the mind and of fortune
by the goods of the body they mean health strength outward sense as seeing hearing and a good temper or constitution so as it may be most serviceable to the mind
the goods of the mind are such as quickness of apprehension good judgment a firm and faithful memory learning knowledge by the goods of fortune they mean riches honour authority interest
now tho we do not approve of their calling them the goods of fortune austin was not pleased that he had so that word yet shews in what sense it may be used retractat
lib
cap

yet by what have said we may see under what general heads we may reduce those various gifts which are committed to our trust and will now shew you

first that we receive all these from god and these things may indifferently be said to be given by god the father or by jesus christ as mediatour
for all power is originally from the father

to whom it must be again resigned when christ hath fulfilled his mediatory office cor
but in the mean while all power in heaven and earth is committed to christ matth

for the good of his church eph
and in order to their salvation john
now it is god that giveth to all life and breath and all things acts
it is he that did form and fashion us in the womb and did not fail of making any one part of the body but did fashion us as perfectly as if he had a model or a receit in a book to make us by psa
and as the painter mixes his colours so as to give the right complexion to a picture god doth so temper the several humours of the body as they way be serviceable to the mind in such manner and measure as he pleases and hence proceeds the different temper of men whereby they are fitted for several businesses and employments and it is god that makes to differ even in our natural temper and constitution if there be in one undefined span alphabet or any good natural inclination and in another such an ill temper as socrates acknowledged himself to have it is god that makes the difference and hence it is that one hath quickness of apprehension and presence of mind another solidity of judgment another a curious fancy another a strong memory and hereby they are fitted and qualified for business and several employments
so those that they call the goods of fortune are from god who gives us all things richly to enjoy tim
both riches and honour come of him and in his hand it is to make great and to give strength to all chron

it is god that gives us all things pertaining to life and godliness pet

so that we have nothing but what we have received cor

seondly we are but stewards of these manifold gifts of god peter
those words of the apostle may have respect both to what goeth before and what followeth after we are not only to minister of our substance with those good women luke
but of those spiritual gifts which we have received as we have occasion and opportunity he that is steward to another if he have any thing of his own may imploy it as he sees good but those things which belong to him that he is a steward for he must improve for his advantage or he that is factor for another must trade with what he hath sent to him for the best advantage of him that trusts him and must not let his money or stock lye dead and there will a time come that we must be called to a reckoning and have that summons sent to us luke
come give an account of your stewardship for you must be no longer stewards
now therefore we should consider what we have committed to our trust they that have most have but little in comparison as it is said to him here that had the five talents that he had been faithul in a few things as it is said of those extraordinary gifts which they had in the primitive times to one was given the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge to another faith to another the gifts of healing to another working of miracles to another prophecy cor
so now some have health and strength some abilities of mind some riches some power and authority some interest in great persons whereby they may obtain favours for others now we should as it is said the liberal man devises liberal things isa
cast about what we should do with what we have in our power as peter said silver and gold have none

but such as have give thee acts
some now have silver and gold tho they have not the gift of healing some tho they have neither of these are capable of doing good some other way the prophet was inquisitive what he should do for the shunamite and he would know whether she would be spoken for to the king or the captain of the host by reason of the miracles which he wrought he had an interest in them kings
job had several talents as we speak committed to him he was a great man he had riches authority interest wisdom and understanding and he improved them so that when the ear heard him it blessed him and when the eye saw him it gave witness to him he delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless and him that had none to help him the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon him and he caused the widows heart to sing for joy
this he might do by his authority and interest by his riches he was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame either taking care of those who were really so to make a supply to the defect of their senses or limbs or he was a guide to the ignorant directing and counselling them in those things which they had not an insight into rom
and supporting them when they were ready to fall or to be cast down by others by his wisdom he searched out the cause which he knew not and by his authority he brake the jaws of the wicked and plucked the spoil out of his teeth job that is he rescued the prey from them alluding to dogs or ravenous creatures that must sometimes have their teeth broken to prevent their doing mischief or to get the prey out of their mouth see psa
and
one had five talents committed to him another

two another one so we may not have so much committed to our trust as job had yet something we may have whereby we may serve christ and do good to others we may if we have riches relieve others in their straits disperse bibles and good books encourage and promote the preaching of the gospel and so be helpers with the ministers of the gospel in the work of christ rom
if god have given us knowledge we may instruct others in our several relations and capacities as husbands pet

as parents prov
as christian friends instructing others in some things who in other things may know more than our selves acts
if we have any interest in others we have the greater advantage for doing them good as we have the greater obligation thereto

come now to speak of the favour they shall find with god and the reward which they shall receive from him that have well improved their gifts well done good and faithful servant then shall every man have praise of god
cor
that is all that have praise men must not then put in to pass their censures but we shall depend upon god for our final sentence which shall determine our eternal state
but what are we that god should shew us such favour or what are our services that he should approve of them we must say as david in another case
chron

of thine own have we given thee all this store cometh of thine hand and is all thine own so we are nothing
cor
and whatever we have done it is not we but the grace of god which is with us
cor
if god promise any favour to any grace or to any person qualified therewith as to those that fear him mal
to those

that love him rom
he doth not therein show the reason of his bestowing such favours but the order in which he be stows them it is he that puts his fear into our hearts and circumcises our hearts to love him jer
deu
and in this respect we may be said to receive grace for grace
have before shewed you what the literal meaning of those words may be will make thee ruler over many things
and doubtless the scope of the parable is to shew how liberally and bountifully god will recompence any service which is done for him above our desert

those words enter thou into the joy of thy lord express more particularly what shall be done to those whom god doth delight to honour
an entrance shall be ministred to them abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
pet

the scriptures do not distinguish so critically as the philosophers who call sensual delights pleasures and intellectual or spiritual delight joy for according to the scripture there is in the presence of god fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore psal
now the joy of our lord may be either that joy which we have from him as the praise of god is that praise which we have from god joh
or it may be that joy which our lord himself hath or is entered into for he for the joy that was set behim endured the cross and despised the shame hebrews

first say it is that joy which we have from god and this is enough to commend it to us and raise up our minds to great expectations of it ahashuerus called in help to contrive what should be done to the man whom the king delighted to honour esth
and the faithful servants of

christ are such as god doth delight to honour and as ahashuerus in the feast that he made for his nobles and princes would shew both his favour to them and the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty and so gave them drink in vessels of gold diverse one from another it is likely of different fashions and royal wine in abundance esth
so god will shew the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afore prepared unto glory rom
as he will shew the riches of his grace in his kindness towards us in christ jesus eph
as it is said araunah gave as a king to david in respect of his bounty and munificence sam

so god will be a god to his people chron

heb
dealing as a god with them in magnificence and munificence and as none knows the power of his anger which is according to his fear psal
so none knows the riches of his glory which is according to our most raised hopes and expectations yea far exceeding them as the queen of sheba found the glory of solomon far to exceed the report of it in her own country tho that report was above her belief kings
christ and heaven suffer no hyperbole nothing too great can be said of them god needs not to take counsel of any to know what shall be done to those whom he delights to honour that manifold wisdom which could find out a way to save sinners without any injury to his law or justice eph
can prepare that happiness for them which will make him to be glorified in his saints and admired in all those that believe thes
there are two ways whereby we may make some conjecture at the joy of heaven
first by the joy or pleasure which we see men take in these worldly sensitive

objects when there is an innate instinct desire appetite and senses suited to that goodness which is in any creature then it is to us as the loadstone to the iron which draws it to it
we could not enjoy the fragrant scent of a flower without the fence of smelling and those that want that sence may well wonder what it is that makes men delight so much in sweet smells and to use a plain similitude if such an one were to buy but a pair of gloves they would observe the matter of them the fashion or making of them and the colour of them but they could not value them for their rich perfume which doth so much enhance or raise the price of them so others are entranced in pleasure by the ravishing melody of musick which is nothing to those that want the fence of hearing and so the most charming beauties are nothing to those that want the fence of seeing or where desire fails as the wise man speaks through the decays of nature and declining age eccles

but all the glory of this world is no more to the joy of our lord than the husks which the swine fed upon was to the entertainment which the prodigal had in his father's house there we shall have the most excellent objects and we shall perfectly enjoy them when our understandings are perfectly enlightened to know what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints eph
and our affections perfectly renewed so as to follow hard after god ps
as one said not panis domini but panis dominus so there will be not only gaudium domini the joy of the lord but gaudium dominus the lord our exceeding joy psal
and there will not be only glory prepared for us but we shall be prepared for glory rom
we shall be made meet to

be partakers of an inheritance with the saints in light col
there were two things which made solomon a competent judge of what was to be found in these earthly things his riches whereby he was able to purchase or procure the best of what this world could afford and his wisdom whereby he was able both to draw out the quintessence or vertue of every thing and to make a critical judgment of it eccl
so in heaven there will be the most excellent objects as mr baxter said a little before his death that place hebr did deserve a thousand thousand thoughts there we shall see god as he is john
we shall be fit to be admitted into that general assembly and to joyn with them in that divine service wherein they serve him day and night rev
without saying what a weariness is it our hearts will be fixed to sing and give praise ps
we strive sometimes to wind them up to make melody to the lord col
but as when a lute or viol is tuned the pegs will loosen and the strings slacken and spoil the melody so when we would lift up our hearts to god they sink down again but they will not only be prepared but fixed

secondly we may make some conjecture at this joy by the which we have of it here where we walk by faith and not by sight
cor
ver
but tho we see him not yet believing we rejoyce with joy unspeakable and full of glory pet

it is that which we cannot express and is full of glory as that power whereby a christian is strengthened to all patience and with joyfulness enabling him to bear long affliction with joyfulness is a glorious power col
if we may be filled with all joy and peace

in believing rom
what will it be to see as we are seen if these are such strong consolations that some drops of them will revive our languishing spirits in the greatest afflictions
cor chap
what will it be to drink of the river of his pleasures psal
when we shall have no affliction to allay the sweetness of it the joy that christians have had here hath been sometimes as much as they could bear but here we are but as persons which begin to recover their health and so find some savour and relish in what they eat and drink but in heaven we shall be as those that having more fully recovered their health and appetite take pleasure in eating and drinking and taste the sweetness of their meat and drink
further as told you it is the joy of our lord or that which was set before him to encourage him against his sufferings and he will not only come again and receive us to himself that where he is we may be also joh
that we may behold the glory which the father hath given him but he gives the same glory to them which the father hath given him joh
as they suffer with him so they shall be glorified together rom
to him that overcomes christ will grant to sit with him in his throne as he also overcame and is set down with his father in his throne rev chap
we have a glimpse of this glory in the transfiguration of christ matt
his face did shine as the sun and his whole body was so illustrious that it darted a brightness through his garments and there were two of the general assembly with him peter was so taken with it that he thought it was good for them to be there but this continued only a little while it is liketheir joy was allaid by the discourse about his decease

rom
and hereby we may be to the truth john

and ministers could do little in city or country in propagating the gospel if they had not others to help with them as the liberal man devises liberal things isa
so we should devise and cast about what we may do any way or in any capacity for the furtherance of the work of christ we should not only honour the lord with our substance prov
but we should say in truth to him what is ordinarily said in complement to others that all that we have is at his service as all things are of him so it is fit all things should be to him rom
as it is said exod
in the hearts of all that are have put wisdom that they may make all that have commanded
what any have is from god and it is that they may imploy it in his service
he that had but one talent was punished because he did not improve it he did not spend it as the prodigal did his portion among harlots or in riotous living but hid it in the earth and returned it to him again match
verse
it is not enough that we do not embezel our lord's goods or that we do no hurt therewith as it is said celata virtus paulo distat abinertiâ unknown or concealed virtue differs little from ignorance or idleness and do not account it much to a man's praise to have it said of him that he is a man of unknown worth
it is true sometimes as folly is set in great dignity so the rich sit in low place eccles

where the opposition teaches us to understand it of those that are rich in virtue wisdom noble endowments this is an evil under the sun and an errour that proceeds from princes not to advance men according to their worth and in such a case men

have not occasion or opportunity for putting forth themseles or shewing what is in them
if some very learned man were confined to some obscure country village he would not have much occasion to shew his learning or if a man have prudence courage conduct to qualifie him for serving his king and country in councel or camp but by law is made uncapable thereof he may be as a lighted candle under a bushel and sometimes again a mans modesty may over awe him that he doth not put forth himself which is better than boasting of a false gift pro

or through vain glory to take all occasions to make ostentation of our own worth or ability trading for our selves with our lords gifts as gehazi that would get something by the cure which was wrought on naaman kings
we must take heed of thinking the service lost that we do for god wherein we do not pocket up some applause or praise for our selves
remember the leprosie that cleaved to gehazi and the end of herod that gave not glory to god acts
those that minister must do it as of the ability which god gives them that god in all things may be glorified pet

we must not do as israel that trusted in her beauty and plaid the harlot because of her renown for that beauty which was perfect through that comliness which god had put upon her ezek
but on the other hand we must not through a sly and secret pride refuse to trade because we have but one talent or to put forth our selves because we have no more to make shew of there is a good sense of that scire tuum nihil est nisi te scire hoc sciat alter what thou knowest is nothing unless others know that thou knowest it for we have not received it for our selves as the manifestation of the spirit is given

to every man to profit withal cor
and as the rust of silver and gold will be a witness against those that have treasured it up james
so the hiding of mens gifts that is not improving them will be charged upon them
but what then will the end of those be that abuse their gifts in this case he that is not with christ is against him mat
because he hath received his gifts to imploy and improve in his service as he that is listed in a princes service and receives his pay is against him if he stand neuter or does nothing much more if he fights against him
if god give a man riches and he make use of them to oppress the poor jam
or to make provision for the flesh to fill the lusts thereof rom
spending it on pride or voluptuousness if god have given men power or interest that is if they either be in authority themselves or can make an interest in such as are so and take advantage thereby to crush the fatherless or the poor it is that which job durst not do for destruction from god was a terrour to him and by reason of his highness he could not endure job
if god give a man learning and knowledge and he set himself therewith to oppose the truth and cause of christ and to maintain and support an evil cause against christ if be give a man quickness of wit and parts and he make use of it to ridicule religion and expose those that are most strict and conscientious in the profession of it or to defraud and his neighbour if he give a man strength and ability of body which he might have used to good purposes in the service of god or of his country and he spend his strength in luxury and debauchery pro


we may ask them as cyprian doth those that used painting and such arts how they can look upon god when they are not as he made them but as their own lusts have deformed them this is like taking the corn and wine and oyl and silver and gold which god had given to israel and preparing it for baal an abominable idol hosea
and if the unprofitable servant that hid his talent shall be cast into outer darkness sure the wicked servant that abuses his talent to the and of god shall have hell made as nebuchadnezzar fiery furnace seven times more hot than it was wont to be dan

in this case there is not only lucrum cessans but damnum emergens not only a loss of what night have been gained by a good improvement of what men are trusted with but a further dan age accrewing by misimploying of their talent as if a person should leave a steward to look to the affairs of his houshold and leave him money to buy and make an advantage for his master and he should with his money drink and game and keep company so as to neglect his masters business and let that suffer for want of looking after
or as if a man should be at charge to bring up his son in the study of the law that he might get an estate and be a support and ornament to his family and when he hath attained some skill in the law instead of getting an estate thereby should use it only to winde himself into his fathers estate and cheat him of it
rules are made more plain by examples therefore shall to illustrate what have spoken give an instance of a good and faithful servant in him whose death hath given occasion of

the foregoing discourse do not intend to give an account of his life but only to give a brief account of some things which may shew what talents he was trusted with and what use he made of them
god who presides over our forming in the womb as have already shewed gave him undefined span alphabet temperamenti undefined span alphabet ingenij a good crasis or constitution of body and a good temper of mind both of which did much fit him for the work which he was called to
he had somewhat a deep tincture of melancholy yet not such as to dull or cloud his mind but rather to poise it and so tempered as he had both a quick apprehension and solid judgement he had so much of it as to make him suspicious and cautious of obtruding any crude or indigested notions on others and it will be found as soon as any of his labours are made publique which an excess of modesty hath hitherto kept from the view of the world that they do demorsos sapere ungues according to the advice of the poet saepe stylum vertas iterum quae digna legi sint scripturus well weighing and considering what ever proceeded from him he entered early indeed on the work of the ministry but he was not more apt to teach than apt for teaching he was none of those that beza speaks of which are doctores but aptiores ad stivam fitter for the plow than for teaching while young he was not only a titular but real master of arts when mr vines a competent judge of mens abilities heard him preach he said he looked like a boy but spake like a man he came to london in forty two and did design to go beyond sea with some merchants but meeting occasionally with sir thomas barrington he was so pleased

with his converse that he prevailed with him to go to hatfield in the begnning of forty three their lecturer being newly dead whom he succeeded in that place when he was but in the two and twentieth year of his age being born on september one thousand six hundred twenty one
there he continued till he was forced away and though he had invitations to several more publique places where he might have had far greater worldly advantage heard him say above fifty years ago that he would not leave hatfield for any place in england there being then many eminent christians most of which are long since admitted into the general assembly amongst he spirits of just men made perfect whither he is now gone to them
at his first coming thither he only preached the weekly lecture which had continued there many years and on the sabbath daies in the afternoon but after some time the minister of the place having another living in norfolk was obliged to reside there and quit hatfield and then the whole work did devolve upon mr warten so that he preached constantly three times a week at home and took his turn in several other lectures which were kept by a combination of ministers yet his frequent preaching did not make him slight therein his lecture was frequented by many of the neighbouring ministers his sermons were chiefly designed and accommodated to the use of serious experienced christians of which there were many then his sermons were not as some things which are compositions indeed wherein several things are put together and the ingredients appear in gross lumps and they do not incorporate together and so the

virtue of them is lost whereas when they are well mixed they do not so obviously appear but there is the virtue of them
so learning doth little good in sermons where it appears in long quotations school terms and distinctions exotick or foreign words but then it doth most good in sermons when ministers make use of it to insinuate or work things so into the affections of their hearers that they may e're they are aware be made as the charets of aminadab cant
or come upon them with that power and evidence of truth that they may not be able to withstand the wisdom and spirit wherewith they speak acts
but besides this ordinary work there were then monthly fasts which he usually kept without the help of others wherein he did not huddle over the duties of the day in compliance with the weakness of those that say of such days as the jews of their new moons and sabbaths when will they be gone amos
and of the duties thereof what a weariness is it mal ch
ver
but he kept them with solemnity as days of afflicting the soul and with such fervency and perseverance in prayer as the condition of the nation did then require and besides these his assistants was frequently desired in days of solemn prayer and humiliation on particular occasions he being an israelite indeed not only as without guile but as one that had power with god in prayer and did oft prevail for which reason have several times been desired by christians to engage mr warren to pray for them and have since his death received letters from some lamenting the loss of such a praying friend and he hath oft

put me in mind of the words of mr welsh concerning an eminent christian in scotland happy is that city yea happy is that nation that hath an hugh kennedy and adds what may truly say concerning mr warren have my self certainly found the answers of his prayers from the lord in my behalf

and besides all this there was a monthly meeting of some ministers which he was the first promoter of that continued many years wherein there were disputations and latine sermons wherein have oft heard positions and determinations which might well have become the or have entertained an academical auditory
all these things required much study which he had need be a good husband to find time for amidst so much business especially considering how much acquaintance and company he had all that knew him being so desirous of his conversation which was so pleasing and profitable and so many having recourse to him for satisfying their doubts he having according to the proverb an eagle's eye and a lady's hand in dealing with wounded consciences that is a deep and piercing in sight into matters of that nature and much of tenderness and compassion towards such persons
and further as was observed of mr joseph mede that profound scholar that he seemed most delighted with those studies which might strain the sinews of his brain and therefore did set upon the most difficult places of scripture so
mr warren did preach long upon the song of solomon and the revelation
as that pious learned judicious man mr durham in scotland likewise did though mr warren did not undertake to determine any

thing upon the prophetical part of the revelation
know those are charged with arrogance and that will attempt to explain such difficult places of scripture yet there is a blessing promised to him that reads and to him that hears the words of the revelation chap
there are many things therein that must be kept and therefore understood and certainly there are many things in both these books that at first seem very obscure which by prayer study and comparing them with other places of scripture may be made more plain than could at first be imagined
as a learned man saith of mr durham lectures on the revelation that divers of the most obscure texts of that book which he understood little of at the beginning of his lecture before he closed his exercise were made so clear to him that he thought he might well acquiesce in his exposition without much more debate
though he was thus employed yet he redeemed so much time for study that he was a general scholar and when there was once a suspicion suggested where there were many persons of quality together that some of the might be jesuits too great an honour to that order as if though learning do not die with them yet it brings learned men whom others are not on all accounts satisfied with under a suspicion that they belong to them one in the company replied that the fittest person that he knew to make a jesuit was mr warren not that he had any such suspicion of him for know he gave an high character of him both for piety and learning but he accounted him a person of such quickness

and acumen which he gave an instance of in his so baffling a doctor in his hearing which was known to some of the company
there are some living who can still remember that about fifty years agoe there was a person of competent learning as appears by a visitation sermon long since printed but of greater confidence that preached a lecture at a place in this county wherein he took upon him to maintain universal redemption and still after his sermon he made a general challenge as goliah did to the host of israel give me a man that we may fight together sam

he was ready to dispute with any that should question what he had preached
now there was a weekly lecture not far off where several ministers met and upon consulting together they thought it fit for them to accept of his challenge lest by their silence they should seem to consent to his doctrine or at least that as the host of israel was dismaid and greatly afraid at the words of goliath so they were afraid to encounter him so it was agreed amongst them to go the next lectureday to hear him and to dispute with him and mr warren was desired to be there with them

so they went and he made his challenge as he used to do and tho mr warren was much younger than most of the other ministers they put him upon accepting the challenge which he did and at the first put him quite beside his play which did non plus him for a time but after a little while he recovered himself so far as to ask mr warren a question appealing to him whether he thought in his conscience that the interpretation which he gave of those places of scripture which he had alledged for the proof

of his doctrine was the true sense of them to which mr warren made him presently such a reply that he came down from the pulpit as a man confounded and quitted the field came thither no more to make any further challenge
indeed mr warren did in some sense acknowlede a general redemption yet not that conditional redemption which is contended for by so many learned men but such a redemption whereby christ did obtain an universal dominion over all so as not only to be the head of his christ but to be head over all things to his church or for their good eph
and whereby he had power over all flesh that he might give eternal life to as many as the father had given him joh
amyrald who was a great abbetor of this new hypothesis of redemption might think say of it as he once did of the new philosophy when two happened to come to visit him at the same time and fell into a very warm debate about the old and new philosophy amyrald after he had heard their several exceptions on one side and the other crys out difficulte pour difficulte le vicil vaut autant que le nouveau difficulty for difficulty the old is as good as the new
doubt the new aypothesis of redemption will do no more to extricate us out of pretended difficulties than the old

some suppose that the four beasts mentioned rev
are emblems of the ministers of the church that zeal and courage that patience and industriousness that prudence in managing the affairs of the church that insight into the mysteries of the gospel that should be in ministers and which are in them in different degrees some excelling more in one some in

another
mr warren did not want courage and patience under affliction suffering joyfully the spoiling of his goods and of his industriousness have already spoken but he was eminent in prudence and insight into the mysteries of the gospel
his prudence was such that he was of great use to his friends in advising them in several cases even about worldly things though he minded them so little that he might seem to some to be a meer scholar but he was none of the philosophers which the greek comaedian complains of that were wise in words only but in managing business very fools for managing affairs he was so fitted that a considerable congregation of christians of a different persuasion from him would have chosen him to be a teacher in their congregation that they might have the benefit of his preaching and of his prudence in managing the affairs of their church desiring there might be a mutual forbearance between them in such things wherein they could not be of one mind
and his writings something of which is now come out of the press and more may hope ere long are such whereby that may borrow the apostles words eph
when ye read ye may understand his knowledge in the mystery of christ
he was of a very peaceable temper and did study to be quiet and as much as in him lay to live peaceably with all men yet would not jurare in verba magistri or in our saviours sense matt

call any man father on earth resigning up himself to him by an implicit faith
mr baxter was his antient friend and they lived together in the same house when mr baxter preached at bridgworth

yet when he put forth his aphorisms mr being dissatisfied with some things therein was his ingenious friend that he speaks of in the postscript to his book of and names in his catholick theology who attempted something at first which we do not meet with indeed in his polimical writings because mr did engage him not to draw him into a publick contest by publishing any thing which he wrote to him but it was that which mr baxter did not slight nor answer unâ liturâ with one dash for he wrote him an answer to it of one and forty sheets
to draw toward a conclusion he was a shining and burning light and might give that for his motto lucendo pereo
he wasted with giving light to others

never heard him wish with dr whitaker that he could purchase that health in his old age which he empared by his in his youth or repent him of any pains which he had taken in his lords work
his strength failed him for sometime before he died so that he was carried to the pulpit constantly as his predecessor likewise at hatfield was what a difference is there betwixt looking on a body worn out in the service of mens lusts and mourning at last when their body and flesh are consumed and saying how have hated instruction prov
and looking upon a poor decayed body worn out in the service of christ
at length more than three months before he died his strength was so far decayed and his memory did so fail him that he was forced quite to disist from his pleasing work which he had taken so much delight in and god did hereby make him not only willing but desirous

to die
then as one said he had vitam in patientiâ mortem in voto was content to live in submission to the will of god but having a desire to be dissolved and to be with christ phil

as a servant wearied with work earnestly desires the shadow and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work job
this you may see by this passage in a letter to me sometime before he dyed when he found his strength much decaying viz my inability for service to god and his dear people whom my soul loves makes me weary of this world and willing to be gone to the remaining rest

the lord prepare me for it and quicken my motion towards it and bless your labours who have yet time and opportunity to work in his vineyard
as for me my flesh fails and my heart fails but be thou god the strength of my heart and my portion for ever
and hereby god likewise brought his friends to be willing to part with him many years agoe when he was near to death thro a sore sickness and understood that as it is said of peter acts
instant and earnest prayer was made of the church unto god for him he wished that god and his people were agreed to let him go
now his people were willing to let him go he could be no more useful to them and his strength was but labour and sorrow having almost finished the seventy fifth year of his age

if he had been taken away in his strength and while he was busied in his masters work how great lamentation would have been made over him for the loss of his publick labours which had so oft been so great a comfort and refreshment to them for the loss of his prudent

counsels spiritual consolations sympathy in afflictions pathetical and earnest intercessions and for my self may say as david for jonathan am distressed for thee my brother very pleasant hast thou been to me and thy love to me was wonderful sam

may without vanity speak it for when above forty years ago he seemed to himself and others to be leaving the world he was speaking to his nearest relation which was with him of several of his friends and when he spake of me brake off abruptly only with these words loved him
sir fuk grevil afterwards lord brook desired when he dyed that he might have inscribed on his grave here lies a friend of sir philip sidney and should think it honour enough to have it inscribed on mine here lies a friend of mr warren

lived in intimate friendship and familiarity with him forty five years and spent many precious hours with him to my great comfort and advantage and if might have my choice as elisha had at the translation of elijah kings
it should be that a double measure of the spirit of mr warren might be upon me
yea should account my self happy if had but his measure of gifts and parts of learning grace temper how quick was he to apprehend of what a profound judgment how inquisitive in the pursuit of truth how diligent to dive into the depth of things or as we say to sift them to the bran of a tender spirit weeping like job for those that were in trouble and his soul was grieved for the poor job
how great a measure had he of that wisdom that is from above which is pure peaceable gentle easie to be entreated

full of mercy and good fruits without partiality without hypocrisie james
if may speak impartially and unfeignedly never knew any in whom these things were more plainly exemplified than in him
how tender indulgent and prudent an husband and father he was how affectionate and faithful to his friends how able to advise them how ready to pity them sympathize with them and pray for them those only know that were acquainted with him who lament the want of him
for tho hope his prayers may be answered which he made while he lived for his friends now he is dead for we pray that both our selves and others whom we pray for may find mercy and obtain grace to help in time of need that an answer may be given in not presently but as the matter requires when it may be most suitable and seasonable heb
therefore tho abraham did not obtain an answer when he prayed god remembred him soon enough to deliver lot which seems to be the chief thing he aimed at in his prayers gen
yet many dearly miss such a friend to go to both to sympathize with them and advise them as their condition requires and tho there be a residue of the spirit with god to raise up and send forth such labourers into his harvest yet the want of such is much lamented now the harvest is so plenteous
but for the inhabitants of hatfield stortford and other his christian friends whom he had a continual remembrance of in his prayers and who have fully known his doctrine manner of life purpose faith charity patience tim

and are witnesses how holily and justly and unblameably he behaved himself among them

thes
as they desire his prayers may come up for a memorial before god so let them endeavour to have these things always in remembrance after his decease which he was not negligent when living to put them in mind of peter
and which others have taken care by publishing some of them that they may be kept in their minds and be followers of him and mark them which walk so as they have him for an ensample phil

for he taught by his life as well as by his doctrine according to the charge which nazianzen gives to ministers not to teach at all except they teach by their conversation

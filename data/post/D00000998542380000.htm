AS three speciall occasions moued S. Peter to offer his labour in building of three Tabernacles;
one for Christ one for Moses, and one for Elias: euen so (right Worshipfull) three speciall occasions moued me to offer this my labor
in the building of a spirituall Tabernacle, one for meere
faithfull affections towards you, and one to satisfie the request
of a right worshipfull gentleman, Sir William Herbert knight, who would ioyne with me in this worke.
If the care of my countrimen might be vnsupplied; and if the worthinesse of this learned and zealous knight might be (as he is in the graue) for euer silenced; yet the heartie affections, the bond of thankefulnesse, and the christian duety owe you, can no way so effectually be discharged.
Wherein also shall make cleare my good conscience towards the one, and my humble duety towards the other: which if you shall please to patronize, whatsoeuer is found wanting by him which is dead, shall be supplied (I doubt not) to your contentment, by them which are aliue.
As the two Cherubins which Moses made, tended to the preseruation of Gods people,
and therefore both were placed vpon the Arke as one: euen so (good worshipfull Sir) the two former books which made, tended to the instruction of Gods people, in the holie Bible; and therefore haue placed them both in one.
As God spake once and twice that power and mercie belongeth vnto him: so will speake once, twice, and euer to his maiestie, that power may be giuen by his spirit, and mercie by his sonne, to all that long with Zeale to the knowledge hereof.
lamentation in Syon, because of Gods iustice for their sinnes, as there was great lamentation for Pharao in Aegypt, because he was a lion in the land, and a dragon in the sea; and as there was great
weeping, among the Iewes, because the king had decreed their deaths: euen so there is great cause of lamentation, fasting, mourning, and weeping here in England, because
beasts of the fields hungering to deuoure our bodies; our bloud readie to water the land;
soules as prepared for the fire of hell, by reason of sinnes in the
common sort, of horrible crueltie in many of them that are
great, and of the generall ignorance of Christ, according to his gospell, in euerie sort.
Manasses, sometimes king of Iudah, with the raigne of Marie; sometimes queene of England, you shall finde little oddes in the innocent blood that the one shed at Ierusalem, and the innocent bloud that was shed at London, &c. which God the righteous iudge hath not yet fully reuenged, because that the vniformitie
in the professio~ of Christ these years, is not yet perfect, the persecution of former times are not done away by repentance.
zeale of Iosias, with the obedience of his people, yet the former sinnes of Manasses would not be forgotte~.
Therfore God knowes, and most wise men sees, we haue vrgent occasions mouing vs to pray, yea, to pray heartely vnto Iesus Christ the aeternall king, for Elizabeth our queene, and other hir subiects, that either be will vtterly forgiue, or at the least grant, that the penaltie deserued doe not fall vpon vs, nor vpon our children.
And albeit we cannot shake off the generall condemnation threatned and knowne to hang ouer England, yet hir maiesty with vs, and we with hir, loathing our own sins, and detesting the abhomination of others, shall be singled and seuered to preseruation, come the desolation neuer
Ierusalem which was sometimes the citie of the great king, the keeper of the diuine oracles, the receptacle of Angels, and the continual presence of God himselfe, is now become a place of sulphir and hellish flames, inhabited with Oules, Estriges, and such like noisome creatures euen so they that haue eyes to see, may yet see the tears and desolation of the great and famous citie of London, they that haue ears to heare, may yet heare the cries of hir children, the pitious lamentation of hir women, and the sighs of hir men in euerie street: some for their parents, some for their children, some for their wiues, some for their husbands, some for mony, and some for meat, which the last years plague hath ruinated, depriued, and desolated.
Whether this were a reuenge of their sinnes yet liuing, or a reuenge of their sinnes alreadie dead, and yet
vnrepented, it is not knowne; but sure it is many woes are past, and many more are to come, if the perusing and the examinatio~ of our selues, worke not in vs the consideration of that great zeale of Gods glorie, the desire of building the Lords house, and the practising of such an vpright life as was in the antient fathers of the church.
Wherefore humbly intreat you, and in Christ Iesus desire you, albeit your place be not to reforme these things, so generally out of frame, yet reforme and amend your selfe and your owne houshold: ioyne with them, that they may ioyne with you.
My good worshipfull and Christian friend, as cannot charge you nor any of yours, for any disorder, so cannot leaue to intreat and desire you to walke warily and wisely in this crooked and froward generation, ground your own foundation sure, take heed to your selfe, looke that
The deuill offreth violence, hold therefore fast that which you haue, watch and pray, pray continually, powre out your supplications before God morning and euening, both you and your hoshold.
Morning and euening (said Dauid) will direct my praiers vnto thee.
As the morning and euening is a sit and a conuenient time for sutors to attend vpon great men, and as the morning was a sit and a conuenient time to gather Manna:
euen so (good sir) the morning and euening is a sitte and a conuenient time, for you and your houshold to become sutors vnto the great maiesty of God, for the spirituall Manna, the food of your soules.
As Moses was commanded to come vp to Sinai, with the two tables of the law, early in the morning: euen so are we commanded to appeare before God in our chambers, early in the morning,
before we goe abroad, hauing the two Testaments of God in our hands, learning how to honor his maiesty in the one, and how to vse our bretheren charitably in the other, both which are the two principall dueties of euerie christian.
As the learning must needs goe before the practising, so the practising must needs follow after the learning.
Learne (I beseech you) therefore, and teach your houshold the learning of the Lord, morning and euening; not in regard of him to whom all times are alike, but in regard of your selues, because in the morning euening is the fittest and most conuenient time, by meditations and praiers to recommend your soules vnto his maiesty, and to contemplate of heauenly things.
And thus hauing indeuored your ease and speedy profit in these my introductions, by taking some thing away, and by adding other more needfull,
with answers to three necessarie questions, take my leaue, not forgetting my humble commendations to your selfe and to the good Christian Gentlewoman Ms. Barbara your wife, desiring the maiesty of my aeternall God to finish your labors to the glorie of his name, to the good of his saints, and to the saluation of your and their soules.
An admonition to Contemplation for the Reader, and especially for my countriemen of Wales.
AS among all other ordinarie accidences that are incident to the prosperitie or aduersitie of mankinde, there is nothing in earth that more fully proportioneth the ioys in heauen, than Musicke, and Mariage: to heare the one, we leaue our meat and drinke; and to be ioyned in the other,
leaue father and mother; euen so among all ordinarie instructions incident to the earthly prosperity and aeternall felicitie of mankinde, there is nothing that more fully proportioneth our condemnation to be iust, than the law; nor any thing that more fully proportioneth our saluation to be in Christ Iesus, than the Gospell.
In the one we heare thu~dring, earthquakes, lamentations, mournings and woe: in the other nothing else but sweet voices, pleasaunt songs, and instruments of musicke, all proportioning and perpetually pointing our marriage with Christ Iesus, in whom we are freed from the curse threats of the law, all other inconueniences whatsoeuer; who saith vnto vs as vnto his bride, My Doue shew me thy selfe, let me heare
Behold thou art faire, behold thou art faire, thou art all faire my loue, there is no spot within thee.
Now then (good christian Reader) tell me, tell me, pray you, tel me, who wil not leaue marrying with a noble Lady in Israel or in England, to be marryed with Christ Iesus in heuen? who wil not leaue all the musicke all the pleasurs of this life, to obtaine the companie of Angels, the ioys of heauen, and the presence of Iesus Christ himselfe? The studie and the diligent apprehending of these exceeding great blessednesse, doe consist in the apprehending of the true vse and intent of the law and the Gospell.
Cease not, cease not, my good contriemen and friends, whilst you liue cease not to celebrate
the wonderfull wonders of Iehoua, of Iehoua, our aeternall God and sauior Iehoua, behold and contemplate who is so great a God as our God; is not the God of Israel the God of England? and is not the vniformitie of his truth among vs as it was among them who liued in tents and tabernacles? English Israel, people of England, the high Sacrificer, the perpetuall Aaron hath powred out vpon thee as out of a ful horn, the dew of Hermon,
my loue, my spouse (saith Christ) thou wast in the rocks solitarie,
like a Doue that had lost hir mate, thou wast vpon the hils all brused and broken, like a bird scarred from hir young ones,
and thou wast in the wildernesse all weake and blodie, like a woman no rather deliuered
Arise now my loue, my faire one, and come away,
for behold winter is past, the rain is changed and gone away, the flowers appeare in the earth, the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the Turtle is heard in our land.
As though Christ had said; True it is my beloued bride, my wife, my dear one, yee were persecuted too and fro, yee were hid here and there, yee were in places of small comfort, as in a rocke, yee were in places of scarsitie, as in a hill or mountaine, and yee were in danger of your liues as among wild beasts in the wildernesse: but take a good heart, feare not, cast away euerie thing that presseth downe, and the sinne that hangs on so fast betraying the succors
Winter, which is by relation, The time of desolation, is past.
Su~mer which signifieth Peace and Plentie, is come, all arguments in the earth and in the elements inforceth the proofe thereof, for euerie thing in their order and kind doe bring forth a ioy innarrable, by the production of frute.
Well then (my good friends and countriemen) remember your selues, consider wel what you are, where you liue, and the time you liue in, take time in time to repent, vse the season, obserue the opportunity in which you may bequeath and dedicate your selues to God.
Now is that acceptable time: You haue had many ioyfull iubilees, you haue now the presence of the Ark, nay, ye haue the prese~ce of Iesus Christ himselfe.
the Lords Arke hath thrown downe the Philistins Dagon, and the sound of Gods siluer Trumpets haue broken the neck of poperie, for the voice of the Turtle is heard in our land.
The church, the Sanctified Syon, is this Turtle; the preaching of the word is hir voice, which we haue heard this six and thirty summers, by the godly gouernment of a Turtle, in the same nature and kinde, who liues solely and solitarily, not meet to be matched with any but with Iesus Christ himselfe.
The son of Sirach saith; There be two manner of people that abhorre, and the third are no people: the first that sit vpon the mountains of Samaria, the second the Philistins that dwell in Sichimis.
They that sit vpon the mountaines of Samatia, repose themselues vpon the authoritie of Rome, the Philistins represent the Turke, Sarazens, and other miscreants; These are the sons of men (said Dauid; These are the generation of vipers, (said Iohn Baptist; These are the children of darkenesse (said S. Paule; and these are they (say all men) that labor to our countries, to ouerthrow our churches, to burne our houses, to bereaue vs of our liues, and to depriue vs of our queene, and both hir and vs of the Gospell.
They conspire against God like Hipocrites, against our quiet queen like traitors, against our common weale like spoilers.
My good countriemen and kinsmen, if you will adhibite any credite to my councell, if you haue
any comfort in the mercifulnesse of God, and if you haue any bowels of Christian affection to your posteritie, then now at the last get you Bibles; leaue off your beads, place learned preachers; displace Ieroboams Priests, walke in the light of the gospell; extinguish the light of Tapers and Torches, the one brings you the high way to heauen, the other the ready way to hell.
As Ioab tooke hold on the horns of the Alter for the safegard of his life: so now take you hold on Iesus Christ for the safegard of your liues.
All kind of creatures are in an vnitie praising God, they call you to ioyne and to vnite your selues with vs in one religion.
Strange sights haue bin seen in the element and in the earth, calling you to repentance, fire hath
come downe from heauen, fishes haue throwne the~selues to land, and beasts haue brought foorth vntimely monsters, calling you to repentance, the earth hath quaked vnder our feete, and our houses haue shaken ouer our heads, calling you to repentance.
ioyne then with vs, we wil now ioyne with you, let vs goe togither into the house of God ha~d in hand, heart in heart, let vs sing one song as with one voice, to the praise of our one only God.
Thus haue boldly briefly admonished you in the Lord; and that you may the better co~template to your co~fort, haue here, as you see, comprised and composed my two former labors into one, with some substraction and with some such addition as may best further you to the speech of his diuine maiesty, in your owne person, when occasion
One quarter of a years pains, as haue pointed, will bring you years profit in earth, and at the expiration thereof, aeternall pleasure in heauen.
And when you haue obtained my promise, desire but your praiers and your meditations to God for me, for the posteritie of the religious and magnanimious gentleman, Sir William Herberd knight, who for his owne part hath runne his race in the faith of Iesus Christ, and finished his course according to conscience towards you, as may appeare; whose body is a sleepe in the Lord, and whose soule is in ioy with Iesus Christ.
There are three sorts of professors that doe suffer great indignitie at the hands, and from the hearts of many
Parasites, stily Sicophants; too too hard, yea heathenish or rather hellish censures are giuen in and granted out against them.
know their obiections vpon long experience, and know that vpon small skill and little reading their turnesicke spirite of giddinesse may easily be quailed, although through ignorance and wilfull stubbernnesse they will neuer be answered.
Good Christian countriemen and courteous Readers, am loath to offend you with tediousnesse about these matters, hauing a great shew of indeuour and purpose to draw you to other matters of greater importance.
haue therfore thought good and more conuenient, to speake of them in the latter end of this booke.
The second doth concerne partly mine owne bodily health, and the third doth concerne the earthly prosperity, and the heauenly faelicity of all the elect, and therefore may not passe it, neither may you in any case omit the learning of it, that with him and me and with the rest of Gods inheritance you may be readie to defend it.
And thus for this time humbly take my leaue, and with such conueniencie as may, do now betake my selfe in the feare of God to the matter.

Moses the son of Amram the sonne of Leui was borne yeares after the creation: when he was full yeares old, he was called of God to be the leader of his people Israel; by a large measure of Gods spirit he spake of sundrie things which were done yeares before he was borne, and also profoundly of manie other things that should befall the people of Israel, euen vnto the birth of Christ.
He wrote this booke neere about yeares after the floud.
Multiplication of the world, by Noah. Election of some, as of Abraham, Isaake, &c.
IT is called of the Hebrues Shemoth, which is names, but of the Graecians later writers it is called Exodus, which signifieth a departing and going of Israel out of Aegypt: by co~putation it amounteth neerly to a storie of yeres, from the death of Ioseph, to the lifting vp of the tabernacle in Siloh; this booke comprehends principally three things.
IT is called in Hebrue Vaicrah, but the Graecia~s later writers Leuiticus, because
it retaineth a memory of some notable acts which were done fro~ the beginning of the second yere after the release from Aegypt, vnto the beginning of the eleuenth moneth of the yeare, which is in some account thirty yeares: and partlie because it debateth of ceremonies and such like which were ended in their time.
THis booke is called of the Hebrues of the Latines Numeri,
because in the beginning of it Moses numbred the people Israel by their tribes.
It continueth the storie from the beginning of the second moneth of the second yeare after the deliuerance of Israel out of Aegypt, vnto the beginning of the eleuenth moneth of the forteeth yeare of thirty eight yeares and odde.

This booke breefly repeats the greatest matters that were spoken and laid downe in the former bookes.
HE was called Iesus the Emperour of Israel; he ruled them victoriously seuenteene yeares, he was borne fiftie and three yeares before their going out of Aegypt, he died when he was one hundred and ten yeares old, of the world.
He and Eleazar the high priest is thought to haue penned this booke.
It approueth the performance of Gods promises, and that he neuer saileth by length of time, nor by distance of place, to remember his ellect: as is shewed vs by Ioshua, who did conquer the land of Canaan, and deuided it among them, euen as the Lord had spoken.
for the fertilitie thereof, farre beyond all other lands, did represent the kingdome of heauen, and in regard of the power therof, it might well resemble the kingdome of Antechrist Ioshua the conquerour was a figure of Iesus, who subdued all things to himselfe.
IT is called in Hebrue Sophetim, according to the Hebrue, Greeke, and Latine, it is called Iudicium, because it conneth the gouernment and religion of Gods people, from the death of Ioshua vnto Hely the priest, about yeres: it is supposed that Samuel is the penner thereof: it sheweth how God detesteth ingratitude, by the great oppressions which was inflicted vpon the people for the same: they were of all people in the world most victoriously possessed of all the ioyes in the world, and yet they were a people worse than those whose carcases fell in the wildernesse: therefore God appointed tyrants
Here is also a perfect president of pardon vpon repentance, for when they cried vnto the Lord, he destroyed those tirants, and gaue them godly rulers.
SHe is said to liue when Deborah ruled Israel, it is thought that the writer of Iudges is the author of this booke; because that the Hebrues doe reckon it with the booke of Iudges: hir nation and kindred whence she came doth well approue the calling of the Gentiles by Iesus Christ, who was to come lineally euen from hir body.

THe acts of Dauid, are they not written in the booke of Samuel

In the first of Samuel is shewed the miserie of the people vnder king Saul, which was a token of Gods wrath, because they were not content with their estate.
Saul himselfe is set foorth for an example of vnthankefulnes, he was hated of God, he was hated of the people, he was possessed of a deuil.
In the second of Samuel, is declared the magnanimitie of Dauid, who ouercame all the enemies of Gods people, wherin he was a figure of Christ.
The Argument of the first and second of the kings.
The first Booke of Kings sheweth vs the vncertaine state of Gods people in this life, as by the example of the people vnder diuerse kings, vnto the death of wicked Achab, who for a little ioy had great annoy; God also plagued them because sinne was fauoured, and vertue was discountenanced; their kingdome was deuided into two parts, presently vpon the death of Salamon, the one became open enimie to the other, for the space of yeares: one kingdome was called the kingdome of Iudah, whose seat was at Ierusalem; the other was called the kingdome of Israel, whose seat was at Samaria: the one gaue themselues to serue the true God; the other to idols.
Here also is the perfect genealogie of Christ, lineally descending from Dauid.
The second of Kings sheweth vs of all famous acts, from Achab the king, vnto the ransacking of Samaria, the captiuating of the people, and Hosea their last
king; here is also the destruction of Ierusalem, and the people carried to Babilon.
With the Hebrues both are one, it signifieth omitted, or things left; the Latines call it Verba Dierum, The words of daies; meaning a Catalogue of things done in former ages: it was composed by Iddo, and Semeia.

Some things in these two books are more amplified than in the books of the Kings The Argument of Ezra.
HE was a priest, and towards the law, and the author of this booke.
It containeth the deliuerance of Israel out of Babilon, with great fauour authoritie fro~ the king for the reedefying of the Temple at Ierusalem; it was hindered by the people of the land, yet it was finished according to the time foretold by the angel to Daniel.
This booke doth proue that God punisheth not the godly according to iustice, but according to mercie.
HE was to Artaxerxes, in such credit, that he obtained in the twentith yeare of his raigne full authority with licence letters, to commaund to the finishing of the decaied places of Ierusalem.

There were three special men stirred vp by the Almightie, for the comfort of his people, hauing long lain in exilement, the first was Zorobabel their captaine, the setter forward of chiualrie; the seco~d was Ezra their priest, the setter forward of religion; the third was Nehemiah, the setter forward of their building.
This booke sets out many particulars, to weet, the builders, the manner of it, their hinderance, their religion, &c.
This booke containeth a singular fauour of God towards them that trust for redemption by Christ, for that he openly writeth their names in his holy citie, that left Babel vpon Gabriels prophesie, to build Ierusalem the citie, for Christ the great king: and therefore the old Hebrues bound Ezra next Daniel, because it dependeth all vpon Gabriels
and all the nation still thence talked of Christ to be their redeemer.
SHe was named Hadassa, she was maried to Darius the son of Histaspis whose surname was Assuerus, vpon the diuorse of queene Vasthi: this booke was written by the chonicler of Assuerus, it was taken out of the records of the Medes and Persians; Xerxes the great warrior was hir sonne by the king, it is consonant with the scriptures of God.
Some hath added to the same six other chapters of Hester, which are not sound nor answerable to the rest.
This booke approueth the assurance of Gods mercies towards his elect, in time conuenient, euen when all worldly helpes faileth, as by the example of Mardocheus and Hester may appeare, who as instruments appointed of God, did deliuer the Iewes from the decree and dedly sentence of the king: moreouer
it sheweth that pride hath a fall, by the example of Haman.
THis storie sheweth the religion of Abrahams other kinred tha~ Israell, how before the law they held faith and co~science, Abrahams kinred in the family of Nahor, as Elihu was in Esaus, as Eliphas was in his own better line, as Bildad of his son Suach was (whom many latins, and all Greeks, commonly make to be of Abraham by Esau, because the land Vz, in Ier. Lament. is in Edom) this kinred of hic Abraham, in these families held religion, and had these men prophets, but prophets alwais had not visions for Gods particular dealings, though for naturall knowledge and rules of vertue they be sinceare.
This booke in this argument, is most rare, containing a disputation, of fiue prophets, God in the end comming moderator.
The shortnes of speech, the deapth of matter, the discourse of Iob for his life, of Elihu for
naturall philosophie, of the rest for the common plaguing of the wicked, the thrise holie conclusion of God makes that booke better than all
The storie fell out about Moses birth, yeres after the deluge.

Dina is said to be Iobs wife, but by men that in sadnesse follow the iests of the Iews, who faigne for memorie of storie, fables.
Dina hath in scriptures no husband named, nor Iob a wife with hir proper name, thereupon Iewes (for teaching children readinesse in storie) mary Dina (that might be Iobs gra~dmother) to him; who followed them in sadnesse were deceiued.
Herein we are assured, vpo~ sufficient practise, and proofe of Gods eternall
fauour, that when al desolations and hazards whatsoeuer are nearest, euen then is that man nearest vnto God, and in the greatest possibilitie of honor and maiestie.
Many great and excellent things are herein contained, therefore recommend them vnto your christian diligence.
IT is called in Hebrue Sepher Tehilim, by the which the Graecians doe expresse musicall instruments.
The authors were diuerse, as the Psalmes doe witnesse, and some are vncertaine, yet the matter is sound and good; Dauid was the chiefest,
and therefore he was called the sweet Psalmist of Israel: Moses wrote the and as a fourme of praier; Ethan and Theman wrote the and who were men of great wisdome;
Dauid ordeined wise and skilfull men to make Psalmes, and to prophesie
with all sorts of instruments, as Corah and his sonnes, Asaph and his sonnes, Ieduthum and his sonnes, Heman and his sonnes there were ordained before the Arke of cunning musitia~,
the instruments were these, Meginath, Mehiloth, Alamoth, Gittith, Ieduthum, Sosainum, Salteries, Harpes, Organes, Trumpets, Cimballes, &c. and the Psalmes serue for diuerse purposes, as you may easely see, if you marke them; some for musicke, as you may know by then titles; some for prayers, some for thanksgiuing, some for consolation, some for doctrine, some for prophesie, and some for storie.
SAlomon was the writer of these three bookes, as appeares by their Titles, and maner of writing, after his conuersion.
In the first, he teacheth all people the true wisdome in the vsing of Temporall
In the second he teacheth a contempt of all earthly glorie, in regard of ioies in the Lord Iesus.
In the third, he sets out the incomprehensible fauor of God towards all such, by their marriage in Christ, representing a spirituall and an inseperable coniunction, vnder metaphors, similitudes, and comparisons.
HE was Amos sonne, taken of manie for an Euangelist, he spake and taught vnder Vziah, Ioatham, Ahaz, Ezechia, and Manasses.
This booke was written by him a little before his death: it contains the doctrine of reconciliation more clearely than the rest.
It is full of reprehensions and consolations; the comming of the Messiah is prooued, and the vniting of the Iewes and Gentiles.
HE was sonne to Helchia the Priest, he wrot this booke and prophesied vnder Iosias Ioiachim, and Zedechia, at that time as Hierusalem was ransacked, and the people captiuated, whome Ieremie lamenteth.
This booke shewes the captiuitie of Hierusalem and hir people, for hir manifold sinnes.
HE was a priest in Babylon, fiue yeres of Ichoiachims captiuity.
This booke doth shew the murmuring of the wicked against the Prophets, because they yeelded to Nabuchadnezar.

THe first was written in Hebrue, in the time of Iohannes Hircanus, the sonne of Simon Machabeus.

It is said that Ieremie hid the Arke of the Tabernacle in a caue, and that Salomon sanctified the place;
which thing Salomon could not doe, because it was no part of his office, and he neuer did it: the same prophet did euen then reproue the seekers after such places, least there shold be any monument or relick of Idolatrie: further, the death of Antiochus is not agreed vpon, for in Mach.

THe Argument or sum of all the Bible by books and chapters, as they ly, comprehendeth ten histories or generall matters, chaining the scriptures to the saluation of one people, in the seruice of God, and to the destruction of an another, wilfullie nelegcting and obstinatly gainsaying the same: whereby you shall see, as it were it one view, what was most notably done and spoken in euerie age, what difference and change there was, and vpon what occasion: you shall not light into any one booke or chapter, but hereby you shal be able to say, This or that matter belongeth to such a storie; This is the effect of euery booke chapter; Here

These were the tenne holy fathers before the floud, which the holy ghost reckoneth, in whom the religion and seruice of God was grounded; these published ouer the world, that the~ was, all such effectuall matters tending to religion, as was deliuered afterward to Moses in two tables of stone, to be continued and enlarged by sacraments and sacrifices, by ceremonies, and such like ordinances, euen vnto the death of Christ: there was nothing done in the time of Moses, which might not wel be deriued from the law and profession of these men, if you compare them by their special instances; by them you shal finde true religion maintained, and the false detected, moreouer by them hard places are made plaine.
And if you reckon how long euerie of them liued, the whole doth perfectly measure the age of that world, from Adam to the floud,
And for these special causes haue laid downe briefly their stories.
ADam was a passing and a most perfect creature, disagreeing from all other creatures, both in the magnanimitie of his soule, and in the excellencie of his bodie; in soule he was like to God himselfe, for wisdome, for innocencie, and clearenes; in bodie he did beare the fourme and fashion of the goodliest male and female kinde that was to be in the world.
He comprehended, by the light of Gods spirite, that the seede of the woman should restore him and all beleeuers into the fauor of God, and therefore he called his wife Heua, that is to say, Life; and he called his sonne Seth, that is to say, Setled, and persuaded in the faith of Christ.
In the commemoration of which seed, Adam offered continuall sacrifice, the which in the allowance thereof was ordinarilie consumed by fire, as was the sacrifice of Abraham in the time of the law.
By this he may well be called a king, a prophet, a priest or sacrificer.
As the original whence he came being earth, had relation to what he should
returne; so the place where he was created, being mount Moriah, had relation to that place where Christ the high sacrificer should be crucified, to the ioy of the world; as by many other particulars afterwards, was made plaine to be Ierusalem,
where Isaac was offered as a figure of Christ; where Sem or Melchisedech dwelt, being the king of peace and iustice;
where Salomon was commanded to build the temple in the honour of his name.
When God had chastned the woman, and cursed the serpent, he said vnto Adam, The seed of the woman shall bruse the serpents head.

could not be knowne to vs, to iudge of that speech, but by the storie of the serpent, which Moses ioined with the creation: and it were irreligious boldnesse to thrust a practise of life betwixt, in another kinde.
Moreouer, our Lord telleth that satan was a murtherer from the beginning, speaking vnto Hebrues.
They now his enemies not onelie graunt, but proue by the testimony vniuersall of all their learned, that the sixt day the serpent deceiued Eue.
If Adam fell not same the day of his creation, what did he then on the next seuenth day? how bestowed he the sabaoth? if he were idle, then he gaue an ill president to his posteritie; if he wrought, then he did worse; and if it be said that he was religiously occupied in the seruice of God, then it followeth that he fell the day before, whereupon Christ was promised, and to be adored the next sabaoth.
Againe, if Adam fel not the same day of his creation, then Cain was begotten in innocencie; for it must needs be granted
acording to the institution and quality of nature, that day or the next night Adam knew Eue his wife, in which he was conceiued.
The euening sacrifice in the law of Moses, had perfect relation to the coole of the day, or euening in which Adam transgressed.
The sixt day in which Christ was crucified, and about the pointed plainly to the day, and to the verie time in the which Adam fel; the course of storie, the words of our Lord, and the graunt and proofe of his enemies, inforceth men of modestie to beleeue it, and to thinke their humours strange that dare crosse the old and new Greeks, protestants, and Romists, to this day; the differing runne into more absurditie than a large volume wold containe; and they who yeeld not to the most auntient and vniuersall, vnlesse they bring a reason that all must embrace, shew neither skill in learning, nor any reuerence to Christianitie.
Seth Was the third sonne of Adam, begotten in the likenesse of his father, when he was yeare old, all the world is bound to take instruction of him, thereby to be setled in Christ the rocke.
All places of scripture that do~th import faith and constancie may be reduced vnto this.
Enos Was verie zealous, and therfore sorrowfull, when he saw the corruption of religion and good maners, which was like to ensue vpon the marriage of the sonnes of God, with the daughters of men, who regard beautie and worldly preferment rather than the promises of life euerlasting, by continuing in true religion.
To this you may referre the zeale of Moses, Elias, Paule, Iohn, &c. who wept for the sinnes of the people, and desired rather to be rased out of the booke of life euerlasting, than that so many thousands should perish.
Kenan Had sorrowfulnesse, and withall, godly repentance, furnished with a godly care of amendment.
To this you may reduce all sorrowfull and penitent sinners.
Had a name very answerable to that acceptable sacrifice which the creator imposed vpon his creation, according to the signification of his owne name.
To this you may reduce all places of thanksgiuing and praysing God.
So Leah named hir fourth sonne Iudah, signifying, Praise the Lord; this ought to be imitated of all men throughout the course of religion, and trade of life, the reason why, is shewed Psal.
Iared Had the vertues of his forefathers, which induced him to great humilitie and lowlinesse.
Henoch Walked with God in holines, he was a man dedicated to the Lord by his name and trade of life, and therefore taken vp into heauen; he is the seuenth from Adam: his yeares are agreeable with the number of the sabaoth, putting all men in mind of the six daies creation, the seuenth daies redemption.
Seuen is an holy and an infinite number, importing grace and peace, by Iesus Christ.
The number of Seuen is taken many times for a time certaine and ceasing, but in euill part, as Nabucadnezer was a beast Seuen yeres, and no longer.
The tabernacle was a building Seuen moneths and no longer.
Seuen somtimes is taken in good part, and for a certaine time ceasing, as the land of Canaan was Seuen yeres in conquering.
Al notable actions were done in equall number of Seuen, as from Moses to Christs death by seuen seuens; Seuen fifties for the glorie of Iosephs
house; seuen seuenties for the house of Iudah; seuen tennes for the captiuitie; seuen seuenties to Christ.
The holy seruants of God, as a rare marke to behold, were borne in the equall number of seuen, as Henoch.
Methuselah Hauing all the vertues and blessednesse of his forefathers, after his death shal haue life aeternall, which his name did teach him by the signification therof.

Lamech He was outwardly afflicted by men, and inwardly afflicted in conscience, by the Deuill; he was a prophet, for he spake of things many hundred yeares past, and of the comfort to come by Noah.
To this you may reduce the tribulations, afflictions, and sorrowes of the church.
Noah Found grace and fauour with God, to whom almightie God vouchsafed to speake, next vnto Adam, and to establish the couenant with him; his houshold as a small remnant left in the Arke, is an aequall proportion of
the smalnesse of the church, in respect of the wicked multitude.
The Doue bringing an oliue leafe, signifieth peace and plentie: you may reduce it to the holy Ghost, bringing glad tidings and eternall ioy to the church.
The signification of their names being well linked together, makes vp a christian sacrifice, the whole summe of religion, or the liuely image and portrature of Christ.
Goe backeward or forward with their names, by the signification or Aetymologie thereof; he that hath one vertue hath all, he that misseth of one vertue, misseth of all, they cannot be seperated.
Forward thus; He that is setled in Christ, as was Seth, is sorrowfull for sin as Enos.
He that is sorrowfull for sinne hath godly repentance, with Kenan.
He that hath godly repentance, praiseth God in pouertie and in plentie, with Mahalaleel.
He that praiseth God is lowly in all estates, as was Iared.
He that sanctifieth the sabaoth, hath long life with Methuselah.
He that hath these former vertues shal be heartely wounded in this world, as was Lamech, but in the world to come he shall haue ioy and comfort with Noah.
Backward thus; He that hath not ioy and comfort in Christ with Noah, is not heartily wounded with the afflictions of this life as was Lamech.
He that is not heartily wounded, hath no hope of long life with Methuselah.
He that hopeth not for long life keepeth not the sabaoth with Henoch.
He that keepeth not the sabaoth, is not lowly with Iared.
He that is not lowly, praiseth not God with Mahalaell.
He that praiseth not God, hath not godly repentance with Kenan.
He that hath not godly repentance, is not sorrowfull for sinne with Enos.
He that is not sorrowfull for sinne, is not setled in Christ.
He that is not setled in Christ, is earthly, miserable, and perisheth.

Here the great and mightie creator, in the number of other ten holie fathers, beginneth to multiplie a new society or sanctified people, and to set vp his owne glorie in open shew to all that should come after, according to the religion in the former age.
Sem Was Noahs sonne who afterwards was called Melchisedech, because he was to beare a perfect demonstration or figure of Christ; he was said to be the king of peace, of iustice, and of righteousnesse, and to be without father and without mother,
So long liued he after the floud, that his kinred was vnknowne, for in Abrahams time he was a great grandfather of eight degrees.
Melchisedech must be Sem, for none of Chams house, nor any of Iaphets house, could resemble the sonne of God, whose religion was to come from Salem.
Noah hauing found fauour with God, and perceiuing by a spirite of prophesie, that his sonne Sem should be blessed, and of great fame with God and man, he named him, Renowmed; which in the Hebrue is according to the Aetymologie of his name.

In this age almightie God maketh his seruice religion more open and apparent than before, by diuerse ordinances, co~stitutions lawes, which he imposed vpon these twelue holie fathers, to be vnrepealed vntill the passion of Iesus Christ: in the meane time God directed them and guided them as it were by hand, and fead them in due season, with al things miraculously: out of these as out of one man, (euen Abram their father, to whom the promise was made) there came a mightie nation, fierce and terrible, against whom the kings of Canaan could not preuaile, no, not the deuill in hell; whose kingdome is a kingdome of power.

You must be perfit in their particular stories, for example thus: Iudah Was the fourth sonne of Iacob, whom Rachel bare vnto him,
she called his name Iudah, which is by interpretation, Praise the Lord; wherein she shewed a perpetuall memorie of Gods mercie, not onely because she being despised and reproched for hir barrennesse, had now the fourth sonne, but also because that of his seed the Messias should come, in whom all the world might sing and praise the Lord.
Iacob by a spirite of diuination did foresee the same, and therefore among the rest of his brethren, at his death he gaue him a name or a cognisance of great magnanimitie and courage, speaking after this manner; Iudah, as a lions whelpe thou shalt come vpon
the spoile, my sonne; he shall lie downe and couch as a lion, and as a lionesse, who shall stirre him vp? Here is a plaine narration of Christ, compared to a lion, for his kinglie properties, no man daring to withstand him; of whom S. Iohn saith,
Behold the lion out of the tribe of Iudah, hath obtained to open the booke, and to vnloose the seales thereof; meaning Christ Iesus is he that shutteth and no man openeth, and he that openeth and no man shutteth.
Moses that kingly prophet, at his death blessed these twelue tribes in another sort, and yet ratefying the former, wherein he remembreth Iudah aboue the rest.
The said twelue tribes were fortie yeares trauelling from Aegypt, vnder the conduct of Moses, towards Canaan.
in two and fortie places, whereof some were pleasant, and some were vnpleasant, of which haue reckoned vp these twelue.
Read the chapters opposit, and you shall direct your memorie to all that was done in this age.
Wherein consider: The strength of Canaan; hauing relation to Sathans force.
The weakenesse of the conquerours; hauing relation to the poore church of Christ.
The time of the conquest, which was seuen yeares; hauing relation to Iesus Christ the conquerour of conquerours, written and comprised in the aequall number of Seuen, as many other great and famous acts are.
The black Moores, the Canaanites, the Peresites, being the progenie of Chant, Noahs cursed sonne, banded themselues, and became an huge armie against the host of Israel.
Their storie serues very well to shew the iudgement of God against obstinat sinners, and his mercies to the penitent.

Wherein consider well three kings, before the kingdome of Israell was deuided.
Saul Signifieth, Desired of the people; He was of the tribe of Beniamin, which thing was a great prerogatine to that tribe, being the least, and the last.
Because the people dispaired in the mercies of God, and distrusted his power, hauing giuen them manifest assurance of the same, he gaue them such a one as they deserued, to weet, an Hipocrite, and an open enemie to all truth and sinceritie, who slew all that did weare an Ephod,
and tooke an oth of the people to betray harmelesse and guiltlesse Dauid, and the rest.
Dauid Beleeued God, and his kingdome was reckoned when the Ark was recouered to Iudah at Easter; so Christ at Easter was proclaimed king.
He was of the tribe of Iudah, of the roote of Iesse, he killed a Beare, and a great outragious Philistine, that defied Israell; wherein he was a figure of Christ.
He had many enemies, and infinite distresses; therein he was a figure of the church.
For his wisdome and order in religio~, he might wel be a figure of Christ.
His kingdome was diuided into two parts, according to the words of the Lord vnto him, but after yeares were expired, it was throwne together againe.
the great and entire kingdome of Israel was deuided into two parts, whereof one was called the kingdome of Iudah, whose seat was at Ierusalem, the other was called the kingdome of Israel, whose seat was at Samaria.
The kings of Israel were open and professed enemies to the kings of Iudah, Israel was stronger than Iudah, for the one had tenne tribes, the other onely two, that held and tooke part.
When you read the booke of Samuel or the booke of the Kings, marke diligentlie these six necessarie questions.
Whether the king of Iudah, or of Israel? Whether he were good or euill? What prophet, one or more? The religion of the people? Their manners and conuersation? Their prosperitie or aduersitie? The particulars of the eight storie.
In this booke is set forth a true proportion of Antechrists earthly glorie, which for a time reached vnto heauen, and mounted ouer all nations; the end was as a tree cut downe by the roots, with an axe.
And who sees not herein the prouidence of God, in the fulnesse of time, shining vpon his sanctuarie, which so long had laine waste? To make this plaine, and to direct your memorie sure, canne deuise no better instruction short and plaine, than that which is in my former booke of method.
The one, what kings raigned in Babilon during the captiuitie.
The other, what kings raigned and ruled after the captiuitie, vntill Christ.
whose glorie was excellent, and very terrible, bearing these parts and proportions:
His Head was as fine gold, Breasts and armes of siluer.
The true exposition of this image, according to the parts thereof, as the holy Ghost sets it downe, signifieth Nabucadnezer; who for his greatnesse is compared to a tree, reaching to the
heauens: that which he saw as a most goodly and glorious image, Daniel saw it in a vision, verie fierce and terrible, as a lion with Eagles wings chopt off.
It was lifted vp and set vpon his feet, as a man, and a mans heart was giuen vnto him.
The other two kings, to weet, Euilmeredech, and Baltashar, are referred in comparison to the first, who raigned iust yeares as appeareth thus.
He tooke Iehoiachim king of Iudah, in the eight yeare of his raigne.
Euilmeredech his sonne who succeeded him, lifted vp Iehoiachim out of prison where he had lain, seuen and thirty yeares, in which Iehoiachim was raised vp, that makes iust fiue and forty yeres, being the whole raigne of this first king.
yeares were fully ended in the particular raigne of these three kings,
Now the head of gold is gon off, and quite taken away, the kings of Babel are extinquished, and the seuentie yeares expired.
In this age the church was exiled, vnder rulers of cruell and beastly affections.
which were foretold, Daniel praied vnto the Lord for the restoring of the desolation of Ierusalem, which so long had beene exiled, and in disgrace; whiles he yet spake and praied, the Angell of the Lord came in hast about the euening sacrifice, who vttered these words:
Seuenty yeares are determined vpon thy people, and vpon thy holy citie,
account cast out of all the times from Daniels vision, at the Edict,
Euerie weeke hath seuen daies; the Angel means for euerie day in a weeke a yeare; seuen daies, seuen yeares,
after the reckoning of the Iubile yeare, the whole is yeares.
The same Angel for plainnesse, deuides the same seuen weekes,
The first part shall be seuen weeks, that is to say, forty and nine yeares, from the going forth of the commaundeme~t that the people of Israel should be freed in the first yeare of Darius, vnto the building and finishing of the temple at Ierusalem, the proofe wherof is thus.
in which the temple was a building: in the other three yeares they were hindered from their worke, in which three yeares of trouble Sirus raigned; yet according to the Almighties former reckoning it was finished.
The kings and rulers that were in this age or deuision of time appeareth thus:
Armes and breasts of siluer, being part of the image which Nabucadnezer saw,
signifieth ten kings of the Medes and Persians, who continued one hundred and thirtie yeares, who are these.
These raigned twentie and nine yeares, in the twentith yeare of Artaxerxes or Darius the Temple was built, being full fortie and nine yeare.
These other kings were after the building, who made vp the hundred and thirtie yeares.
These kings which seemed to the world to be glorious, as the armes and breasts of siluer, Daniel sees them like a sauage and a cruel beare, with iij. ribs in his mouth, saying; Arise, let vs deuoure much flesh, so did they macerate the saints of God, but at their death the armes and breasts of siluer is said to be cut off, being kings of Madai and Paras.
Sixtie and two yeares shall be a troublesome time for Gods people, after the which the prince of peace, the king of glorie shal be slaine, euen he
The bellie and thighs of brasse doth signifie king Alexanders power.
a Goat buck with a horne, which being broken off, comes out in steed thereof foure heads, signifying Alexanders foure captaines fighting two and two, which two first is also the legges of yron and clay and their successours, and the beast with hornes.
Is the beast which Daniel saw verie fearefull and strong, with yron teeth burst in pieces, and stamped the residue vnder his feet, who was the fourth kingdome in the earth, subduing all to himselfe.
The tenne hornes are tenne king stronger than the Iewes, that shall rise out of Siria and Aegypt, whereof one is said to be a little horne boasting against the most highest.
Iauan kings of Aegypt, yron like, to make vp the ten horns.

These kings as beasts ruled most beastly and vnnaturally, verie strong

The third part of the Angels deuision of time, consisting in these wordes.
He shall confirme the couenant with many for one weeke, and in the midst of the weeke he shall cause the sacrifice to cease.
These wordes hath plaine relation to Iesus Christ, his death, resurrection, &c. for one weeke in the account of the Iubile yeare aforesaid, standeth for seuen yeares, a yeare for a day.
In the midst of the same weeke, that is to say, in the midst of this last seuen yeares, Christ was baptized, and did preach this last halfe seuen yeares, confirming his authority with miracles, signes, and wonders, vntill the same three yeres and halfe, the end of Daniels

Though the distance of place, and the conueniencie of time, hath not ministred vnto me any acquaintance with you, nor occasions to see you, yet your
deuout behauiour, your fulnesse of almes, and your continuall praying, with other your modest and chast conuersations, being cast out and spread abroad farre and near, makes me bold to write vnto you, as to one perfectly knowne, and wel acquainted, and that with no lesse than three speciall and waightie occasions, mouing and vrging me.
The first is, to assure you and to protest vnto you that haue truely, sincerely, and faithfully, published this your husbands labour, annexed with my owne, as he desired (by the fauour of a worshipfull gentleman who hath vndertaken to patronize the same with the rest.)
for the long delaing thereof, sithence my importunities are iust, and my excuses reasonable.
The third is, in the mercifulnesse of Christ Iesu to exhort you, and to comfort you onward in the good way and right course which your Christian husband hath left you.
He hath broken the yse to his pains, you may see the cleare water at your pleasure: he hath crazed the shell to his verie death, you may take the kernell all your life: and he hath sauored of the sauce that was soure, now you may assay and eate of the sweete.
His pains hath brought him at the last to drinke of Christ, the water of life: his continuall hungring after righteousnesse, hath brought him to eate of spirituall Manna, the food of his soule: and his bitter annoy is changed into heauenly and eternall ioy.

He once was subiect to sinne because he was subiect to the law, and being subiect to the law, he was subiect to death, but thanks be to God, who hath giuen him victorie in Iesus Christ.
Death is now dead, death is swallowed vp, his death is dead, and how?
Sinne is the sting or the life of death, the life of sinne is the law; now, take away the law, take away sin; take away sinne, then death is dead, death is gon and vtterly destroyed:
and to conclude, your husband (sweete Lady) is aliue, he is not dead but liueth, he was a knight on earth, he is now a

As it is sure whilst your husband was aliue, you did the one, so now seing he is dead let it be surely seene for good example that you doe the other.
As Dauid said of his sonne shall goe to him, but he shall not come to me: so say you, (good worshipfull Lady) shall goe to my husband, my husband shal not returne to me.
Beare you the crosse valiantly, which you haue taken vp zealously, no manner of disco~tentment is ioyous for the present time, but grieuous, neuerthelesse afterwards it bringeth quiet rest.

Sir William Herberd knight his particulars vpon the tenth story, to weet, from the birth of Christ to the worlds end.
COn&sider the times from the birth of Christ to the end of the world, which by the doctrin of Elias amounteth to yeares, the whole time may be deuided into seuen successiue ages, according to the Seuen Churches.
The two first are ascribed to the church of Ephesus and Smyrma, which accomplished the first yeares, for
it is manifest that the things spoken to those churches concerne the first yeares after Christ, that is to say, The examination of false Apostles, the hating of the Nicolaitans heresies, the induring of the extreame malice of the Iews,
and of the ten persecutions, with patience and constancie, is called the tribulation of ten daies.
The third deuision belongeth to the church of Pergamus, to which, as to each that follow, we attribute yeares, which reacheth from the yeare of our Lord till the
That age is co~mended for constancie in the truth, and because there were then some that doted vpon images, and had ordained dedication to the Idols temple, to the martyrs and vigils, in their honour, which was a spirituall fornication, practised of the Nicolaitans, this age was therefore thus reprooued: haue a few things to say to thee, because thou hast maintained the doctrine of Balaam, which taught Balac to put a stumbling blocke before the children of Israel, and that they
should eat things sacrificed to Idols, and to commit fornication.
The fourth deuision or age is appropriated to the church of Thiatira, extending from the yeare to the yeare
The church in this age is commended for hir great deuotion, but because it permitted the church of Rome to vsurpe authoritie, and to be another Iesabel in Samaria, drawing people to Idolatrie, it is therefore reproued, the plagues that God would bring vpon the church of Rome, are declared, and the children of the true church exhorted to continue in the antient faith which they haue already receiued.
The fift deuision or age is the church of Sardic, which beginneth at the yere continued till the yeare
In this age the spirit of Iesabel was growne so strong, and hir Achab so wicked, that the visible church bare onely the name of a church, the doctrine generally corrupted, and things reduced, touching the publicke worshipping of the Almightie,
vnto that miserable estare, that they resembled the raigne of Achab and Iesabel, wherein Elias had so greatly complained, yet God had then his secreat elect expressed in these wordes, know thy workes and where thou dwellest, euen where Sathans throne is, thou keepest my name, and hast not denied the faith.
The sixt deuision appertaineth to the church of Philodelphia, which containes the times that we liue, and all the yeares from till the yeare of our Lord
In this age of the church the truth of the doctrine is replenished, and the truth of the Gospell florished, notwithstanding all indeuours against it, the faithfull are endued with spirituall strength, thus; haue set before thee an open doore, and no man can shut it, for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my works, and hast not denied my name.
The seuenth deuision or age, is attributed to the yeare this age forgetting the mercie of God wil proue to
be carelesse of heauenly things, being neither hote nor cold.
Therefore God will loath and abhorre this age, manifest in these wordes; know thy workes, and tribulation, and pouertie, but thou art ritch, and know the blasphemie of those which say they are Iews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Sathan.
Besides these mysteries of the seuen churches, let vs receiue farther instruction in the opening of the seuen seales, concerning those things from the birth of our sauiour, vnto the end of the world.
THe first seale being opened, is discouered the preaching of the Gospell, and the victories of Christ, in subduing multitudes to his truth.
beheld, and loe there was a while horse, and he that sate on him had a bow, and a crowne was giuen vnto him, and he went out conquering that he might ouercome.
Good lucke haue thou with thine honour, ride on, because of the word of truth, of meekenesse,
and righteousnesse, thine arrowes are verie sharpe, and the people shal be subdued vnto thee euen in the middest among the kings enemies, thy seal (O God) endureth for euer, the scepter of thy kingdome is a right scepter.
The second seale being opened; the bloudie persecutions of the Idolaters, Romane Emperors, and in Gods iustice, these cruell warres, and bloudie deaths are prefigured in these words; And there went out another horse that was red, and power was giuen vnto him that sate thereon to take peace from the earth, and there was giuen vnto him a great sword.
The third seale being opened, the darkenesse, ignorance and heresies, the famine both spirituall and temporall was discouered, that horrible persecutions and warres should bring into the world, in these wordes; beheld, and loe a blacke horse, and he that sate thereon had a balance in his hand, saying, measure of wheat for a penny, and a measure of barlie for a penny, and oyle and wine thou shalt not hurt.
Notwithstanding all the persecutions, heresies and scarsitie both of true teachers and of true doctrine in the church, yet the spirituall wine and oyle, being the old and new testament, (the law and the Gospell) were preserued and vncorrupt as you heare, this is the wine and oyle that the good Samaritane poured into the wound, which he thereby both clensed and cured: this wine of the law searcheth our infirmities, and this oyle of the gospell is the oyle of gladnesse, wherewith we be annointed that be the true members of Christ.
It is the oyle that in the lamp of our soules kindleth and continueth the light of our faith.
This oyle the fiue wise virgins were furnished with, and the fiue foolish wanted; and it is the oile and the vnction that supplies our vnderstanding.
The fourth seale manifested the Romish Iesabel, and the persecuting church of Rome, by palenesse pretending whitenesse, by hypocrisie pretending pietie, spreading his authoritie
ouer the earth, and destroying many, some with the sword, others with spirituall hunger, others with spirituall death, &c. expressed by these wordes; And behold, a pale horse, and his name that sate thereon was death, and hell followed after him, and power was giuen vnto him ouer the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword, with hunger, and with death.
The fift seale being opened, appeared the soules of them that were killed for the testimonie of the truth, requiring iustice at the hands of God for their bloud, but it was said vnto them, that they should rest a little while, vntill their fellow seruantes were also killed.
The sixt seale being opened, the iudgement of God vpon the persecutors of his chuch, the horror of their conscience, and the anguish of their mindes, was declared in these wordes; And the kings of the earth, and the great men hid themselues in dens and among the rocks, saying, Rocks fal on vs, and hide vs
from the presence of him that sitteth vpon the throne.
The seuenth seale being opened, prefigured the beginning of aeternall rest.
Now marke what the holy Ghost discouereth vpon the sound of the seuen trumpets,
it makes plaine all that was betweene the birth of Christ, and the end of the world.
THe first and second trumpet hath relation and sit cohaerence to the church of Ephesus, and the church of Smirma, and to the opening of the first and second seale, that is to say, to the first yeares after Christ.
The euent demonstrated is first the persecution of the church, by the Romane Emperours, whose cruelties were so sharpe bloudie, that they are represented by the tearmes of haile and fire mingled with bloud: this storme of persecution fell vpon Christs husbandrie, so that the third part of the trees, that is to say, the third part of the people, and all the
greene grasse, meaning the ministers bedued with spirituall grace, yeelding plentie of food vnto their flocke, were burnt vp and consumed.
The iustice of God vpon these persecutors, in afflicting them with horrible warres, which like a great mountaine burning like fire, was cast into the turbulent sea of their tumultuous estate, so that the third part of their dominions was replenished with the third part of their subiects slaine, and the third part of their prouinces, cities, and gouernments, which are resembled to shippes sayling vpon the sea of that Empire, was destroyed.
The third Trumpet is answerable to the church of Pergamus, and to the opening of the third seale, representing the time from yeares after Christ, till the yeares
Superstition and idolatrie, the doctrine of Balaam, and scandalous endeuours of Balac, the blacke horse of darkenesse, ignorance and famine of Gods word, began then to take roote.
those yeares, as this trumpet declareth, a great starre no lesse than the Bishop of Rome, fel from heauen burning like a torch, and it fell into the third part of the riuers, that is, into the third part of the doctrine of the church, and into the fountaine of waters, that is, into the principall points of religion.
And the name of the starre is called Wormewood, or Corruption; and the third part of the waters became as wormewood, that is, corrupt and false doctrine
The fourth trumpet, according to the times of the church of Thiatira, and the opening of the fourth seale, that is, from the yeare of our Lord to the yeare
In this time the Romish Iesabel had taken heart and deceiued the children of God, and made them commit spirituall fornication.
In these times the pale horse of the hypocritical church of Rome was farre onward on his race, carrying Death vpon his back, and haling hell after him, hauing power ouer the fourth part of the earth, and
killing with the sword, with famine, and with death, no maruell then if this trumpet telleth vs, In those daies the third part of the sun, that is, the Euangelicall light; and the third part of the moone, that is, of the church, which receiueth all her light of Gods word; and the third part of the starres, that is, of the pastours and ministers, were darkned; and the day was smitten, that is, the doctrine both of the gospel, and of the law, was so darkened and so corrupted, that they wanted the light wherewith they should haue illuminated their mindes.
The fift trumpet agreeth with the times and state of the church of Sardie, and with the opening of the fift seale.
In the ending of the period of yeares of the church of Sardie, at the which Antechrist was growne to his full greatnesse, and had set vp by publicke order the adoration of the sacrament, and thereby brought in an idoll to be worshipped as God, which was decreed at the councell of Laterane, the yeare
of our Lord and within seuen or eight yeares after, no doubt generally receiued in the churches of Christendome, we see the wordes of Daniell perfourmed taking his daies for yeares, and from the time that the daily sacrifice shalbe taken away (which was abolished at Christs passion) the idoll or desolation set vp, there shall be daies, which pointeth to the yeare
The next verse hath relation to the beginning of the times of the church of Philodelphia, when as the truth began to be taught, blessed is he that waiteth and commeth to dayes.
That extreame pollution of the spirituall temple was such as it hath an alogie with the vtter destruction of the temple at Ierusalem, by Vaspatian and Titus.
It was prefigured in the yeare and halfe, and odde daies of Antiochus horrible tiranny in Ierusalem, from the fourth yeare and some moneths more of his raigne, whereas he caused the law of Moses to be abolished, the sacrifices to cease, the temple
to be defiled, the abhominable idol of Iupiter Olimpius, to be worshipped for the space of daies, till the eight yeare that Iudas Machabeus clensed the temple, and decked it with crownes and shields of Gold, a figure of Christ Iesus.
The time of extreame darkenesse and tyranny of Antechrist, by Achab and Iesabell, had Elias been of this age, he would haue so cried out as he did then; but God would haue answered, haue a few names in Sardie that haue not defiled their garments.
The seale opened openeth vnto vs, that in this age the soules of the Martirs crieth for vengance at the hands of God, who lost their liues for the truths sake, and for that they would not embrace falshood.
But it was told them that they should rest till the number of their bretheren were fulfilled, who should also be slaine by Antechrist.
This trumpet telleth vs, He had gotten the key of the bottomelesse pit and opened the gulfe of hell, and hence produced an innumerable companie of Locusts,
that is to say, of friers, monkes, and such like, the smoke of whose errors darkened the bright sunne of the Gospell, and the aire of mens minds, but these haue not power ouer Gods elect.
The sixt trumpet comprehendeth the times of the church of Philodelphia, and the opening of the sixt seale,
in these the gospell is preached, the Babylonians fallen, the synagogue of sathan shalbe subdued, the elect of God are sealed, Antechrist with his kings confederates shalbe astonished.
At the iudgement of God, they shall crie, Mountaines fall vpon vs.
This trumpet sheweth, that not onely the spirituall temple shall be by the true Zorobabel, Iesus Christ, and the gospel preached generally, but also many particulars touching the same, which (to auoid tediousnesse) must leaue.
The seuenth trumpet is agreeable to the euent of the church of Laodicia,
whom the Lord (as soone as he tasteth) will spew out of his mouth.
seuenth seale, which doth intimate vnto vs the euerlasting sabaoth and rest, for a mightie angell lifted vp his hand to heauen, and sware by him that liueth for euermore, which created all things, that Time should be no more, but in the daies of the voice of the seuenth angell, when he shall begin to blow the tru~pet.
And there were great voices in heauen saying, The kingdome of this world are our Lords, and his Christ, and he shall raigne for euer.
Then the elders which sate before God, fell vpon their faces, and worshipped God saying, We giue thee thanks Lord God almightie, &c.
YOu shall doe well to obserue this order, and thereby you may be able to vnfold hard and intricate places, and to expound all such parts or parcell of the scripture, as doe come in question doubtfully.

The twelue next books that are in the old, and the acts in the new, doth comprehend all those things that were either famously done or famously spoken

If it be spoken by similitude, phrase, comparison, figure, parable, &c. then goe no further, the interpretation thereof is easie,
If there bemention made of these numbers the matter adioyning will shew you whether it be good or euill; then compare euerie such mumber with the like.
If there be any thing of faith, of religion, of life and conuersation, then compare it with the like els where.
THe sixteene Prophets, and the Reuelation, comprehendeth great and notable things, past, present, and to come; in reading whereof marke well these that follow, called Propheticall.
Vnder what king in Israel or in Iudah, any such prophet did liue, one
or more, good, or euil. What were the manners of the people and their religion, vnder such and such a king; compare it with the doctrine of that Prophet.
Whether such a prophesie were before the captiuitie, or after.
Whether it were before the incarnation of Christ, or after.
Compare the books of the kings with the obseruation or the former inue~tion, with the books of the prophets, and you shall thereby make plaine the one by the other, for you shall find that the prophets did apply their doctrine according to their manners, where they had to doe.
The first and second of Chro. will serue verie well for the interpretation of the prophets, because it doth enlarge many things spoken in the books of Samuell and Kings.
THus haue aduisedly considered and briefly disposed few principall places, how you shall after another sort make interpretation of holy scripture, particularly by applying or comparing the old Testament with the new, or the new with the old: you must be very perfect in them, and then make diligent examination which of them shall happen to be in any one place that you haue to vse for the time.
Consider whether the scripture that you haue in hand be set foorth by Commaundement.
Least you should misse by taking one for another, haue verie briefly composed and laid you downe their plaine definition, with examples.
Commaundement Is an imposition, a charging, willing, or requiring of a man fro~ his owne wil, seeme it neuer so good, to the accomplishment and doing of another mans wil.
Thou shalt eat freely, but of the tree of knowledge of good and euill thou shalt not eat.
Promise Is to assume, to vndertake, to couenant, to indent, bargaine, and agree, is all one thing, and to one sence.
If thou wilt obay diligently the voice of the Lord, then the Lord wil set thee on high, aboue all nations, and these blessings shall fall on thee,
&c. Ceremonie Is an order, a constitution, disposition, rite, an element, or tradition.
It is an outward representing vnder a materiall and earthly thing, an infallible matter
tending to religion and the seruice of God, vrged and commaunded by the greatest of power, as time, place, or person doth require, hauing an end, as Circumcision Being the outward cutting of the foreskin of the flesh, representeth the mortification of carnall and earthly affections and lusts, and the quickning of the spirit.
This had an end by Baptisme, which is also a ceremonie, and hath an end at the second comming of Christ.
Tipe, or figure Is that which can be referred neither to religion, to manners, nor to truth.
If it command any wicked thing, or doe forbid any good thing, then it is a type or a figure.
When it may be taken two manner of waies, one way to good,
and another way to euill, then is it a type or figure.
Sem or Melchisedech was a perfect figure or type of Christ Iesus, both concerning his kingdome and priesthood.
Prophesie Is a diuining, foretelling, an interpreting, an exorting, or aedifying.
Sonne of man prophesie against the prophets of Israel, and say vnto them, that prophesie out of their owne hearts thus saith the Lord.
Similitude Is that which beares a resemblance, proportion, fashion, likenesse, shew, distinction, or more plaine manifestation of another matter.
similitude is not the same in euerie particular as that which was likened vnto it, but it is sufficient if it be like in one.
Similitudes are neuer set out to confirme or confute, but to adorne or to make a matter more plain; and it is euermore inferiour to the matter in hand, as for example:
Man is like a thing of nought, things of nought worth are still throwne out, cast away, not sit for any good purpose, therefore to be cast out, reiected, and
troden vnder feet; so is man as a thing of nought.
My beloued is like a Roe or a yoong Hart.
Here you must consider the qualitie of a Roe or a yoong Hart, then you shall see what the beloued of Christ is.
Like the graine of mustard seed; to leuen; to vineyard; so is the church.
Marke well the particulars or the sundrie propertie, qualitie, condition, or effect of euerie similitude, then apply it to this or that thing, or to that matter, and you shall be greatly delighted, and enlightned.
Example Is a matter like in effect, though not in substance.
It is the confirmation of another matter whe~ it hath the selfe same sence, although not the selfe same wordes.
It is well said to be a fit example, when a like matter being generall doth proue a particular.
An example is a matter done and extant in print and in writing.
Ensample Is that which we see with our eyes daily in the worke of God, or conuersations of men, which is not printed or written.
It is an ensample when we ourselues can witnesse the seeing of it, and the performing of it.
An Example is that which hath an end or purpose either to exhort, or to dehort from some thing, and so is an Ensample.
The drowning of Pharao in the sea, was an example of Gods iustice against obstinate sinners,
The falling of the tower of Siloh, was an example that others should take heed.
was an example that we should not delight in sinne.
Phrases The holy Ghost for our better capacitie and vnderstanding, vseth to speake and to deliuer great and waightie matters after a phrase or common speech, vsed in
the world among ordinary men, as thus; Nathan said to Saule,
The Lord hath cast thee away: meaning thereby, as men doe cast away things of nought, things good for nothing, so God hath reiected and cast him off, he hath giuen him ouer as a thing nought worth.
Men say of base and simple things, We will cast it away.
Let not sinne raigne in your mortall bodies; meaning by kings gouernement,
that sinne should not gouerne nor haue dominio~ ouer vs.
To raigne, to rule, and to haue dominion, is a common speech or phrase that is vsed for them that haue gotten the vpper hand, the masterie, and the authoritie, to commaund others.
Difficultie or Contradiction Is when one place crosseth another, by a contrarie letter or sence, thus:
The male in whome the is not circumcised shall be cut off from the people.
This is a contrarie to the former in letter, one place crosseth or gainsayeth another.
If a man will come vnto me, he must forsake father and mother.
God is not contrarie to himselfe, which seems here by the letter, nor so abhorring the lawes of nature, as to commaund a man to forsake his father and mother that nourished him vp. &c.
But by way of companion, forsake father and mother, yea, life and all, rather than God.
Parable Is a wise, a hidden, a secreat, and a darke saying, vnder earthly things to set forth heauenly.
Parrable hath many things in it to be considered of necessitie.
Christ speaks to the wicked by parables, because in hearing they should not heare, and in reading they should not vnderstand;
certaine man had a figge tree planted in his vineyard.
Miracles Is a wonder, a strange action, things applyed and turned cleane contrarie to their course and nature, as water turned to wine.
another in sence, either in the old, or in the new Testament.

Sacrament Is a mention and plaine demonstration of holy things alreadie come and in hand.
and redemption in Christ, so farre as by any earthly creature may be represented, or related, which may not be vpon policie, or kingly ordinance, but vpon the ordinance and commaundement of the hiest, and that without adding or diminishing.
Wherof there were but two in the time of the law of Moses; and other two abolishing them now in the time of the Gospell, which are these.
And as they did eat, Iesus tooke bread, and when he had giuen thanks,
he brake it and said, Take eat, this is my bodie.

the same order, which being also finished, compare it with the first, and you shall see your selfe much amended in skill.

An entrance to the answering of the three questions recited in the beginning of this booke.
Haue heard many men of diuers trades, callings, and professions, and some in the parish where haue cure and charge, vsing speeches derogatorie to the credite, good estate, and prosperous continuance of Lawyers, Phisitions, and of the Preachers of the word of God: the ple~tie of which three sortes of learned and honest professors, are the manifest arguments of Gods most speciall fauor towards his church: yet notwithstanding, perceiue they are neither liked nor loued of the ignorant and enuious multitude; wherein they do so much as in them lieth, abuse the means of their co~fort, reiect the graces of God which they daily pray for; yet whe~ they, by reason of their vngodly
or distemperate behauior, are brought to the hazard of their liberties, their liuings, or their liues; then some of them maister and worship the Lawyer.
Others being but a little sicke, post and hast their messengers to the Phisitions, then they intreat them and entertaine them with diuers paiments promises.
And some of them, though the smaller number, when their wils be made, and their soules bequeathed, send for the minister, vnto whom they then speake faire, and crie God mercie, haue beene a sinner, Master Parson pray forme: or words to like effect, doubt me to small purpose.
Wherfore these things considered, thinke it not amisse (good christian Reader) to contriue their questions and my answers Dialogue wise, as betweene the Pastor and Parishioner, after this maner.
WHat is your opinion and iudgment of Lawyers? They are men generally hated and ill reported, and as thinke very iustly: for they doe by delaies and shifts in law, hinder and vndoe many.
The lawes of this realme, made and ordained by policie and wisdome, and maintained by authoritie, are said to consist of perfect reason, auntient custome, yea and of the law of God; very perfectly pointing to euerie man his owne, as God hath limited out of the creation, leauing nothing common or vndesposed, but the fishes of the sea, the fowls of the ayre, and the beasts of the wildernesse.
And it hath his denomination Lex Ligando, because as a bond doth knit and hold many things together, and as of many links is made one
and as by the sinewes, our ioynts and parts of our naturall bodies are tied and bound together; euen so by law, the politicke body of a common weale, is vnited knit together as one, for the preseruation of peace, in the profession of one true euerliuing Lord.
It requireth in it selfe the captiuating of our owne wils, and obedience to the wil of the maker thereof, vpon pains and penalties enforcing the same.
The lawes so considered, make difference betwixt right and wrong, betwixt good and euill men: the lawes of this Land, if they be duely and truely handled, haue that end and purpose as the law of Almightie God, which is, to reduce men from sauagenesse to ciuilnesse, from ignorance to knowledge, and from vice to vertue;
therefore S. Paule said, Princes are nor fearefull, by their lawes, to them that doe good, but to them that doe euill.
Wilt thou be without feare? doe well then: so shalt thou be praised, then is he the minister of God, for thy wealth: but he is the minister of God, to take
These our lawes are laudable, and very neere (for excellencie and sinceritie) to the lawes of God, as doth partly appeare by the definition thereof, Lex est sanctio sancta iubens honesta prohibens contraria.
The law is a holy ordinance commaunding good things, and forbidding the contrarie.
Why then is it dispraised? nay rather why is it not most highly commended, liked, and allowed? Parishioner.
All this that you haue said of the law it selfe, partly graunt, but what maketh this for the calling of Lawyers, and their practise, as Councellors, Doctors, Attorneis, Proctors, Sollicitors, and such like? there were no such men allowed in the iudiciall lawes of God, euerie man was heard of the iudge to say what he could for hmselfe, and why should not our lawes haue that proceeding? Is there any matter so hard and intricate that the
partie grieued cannot vtter it himselfe, and where a cause being neuer so hard and tedious, might be ended within ten daies after the defendants aunswere, it is now drawne to three or foure yeares handling, by the deceit, and for the lucre of Lawyers, vpon whom all the world crieth out with open mouth.
It should seeme you speake of conscience, as wishing all things well, or of extreame malice being some way grieued by them: the best of both pleads you guiltie, in accusing all for some.
It was not so hard a matter for Moses to iudge all Israell at the first by himselfe, as it was afterwards to iudge them by himselfe and others, when Iethro councelled him for his ease to choose many more helpers.
And more tedious it is to determine all the causes moued by the subiects here in England, than it was for Moses when he had most to doe in Israel for complaints,
are encreased, so that many hundreth iudges could not deliberatly heare and consideratly determine all the causes arising here, although the plaintife and defendant were suffered to speake but tenne words a piece; where indeed, if they should haue their allowance, would not serue.
Againe, ignorant and vnlearned men are not able to set forth or report to the iudge the points and truth of their owne causes.
Besides if they were, yet is not any iudge so exquisite perfect in the laws, or any mans wit so pregnant, or memorie so ready, as vpon such sodaine, to minister iustice to euerie man as his cause requireth: therefore learned lawyers, as Councellors, Doctors, Attorneis, and Proctors, are necessarie and fit men, to open, argue, and debate causes, whereby the iudge may see more clearely, who hath wrong, and who hath right, and be called to minde by their motions, what sentence or iudgement is fit to be giuen betwixt them.
cause, such might be the skill and subtiltie of the and the simplicitie of him that desireth redresse or recompence, the iudge being ignorant De veritate facti, for want of information might approue the wicked, and condemne the innocent: wherefore say againe and againe, that Councellors, Doctors, Attorneis, Proctors, yea, and Sollicitors, and the officers vsed in and about the execution of law and iustice, are fit men, necessarie, and profitable in a Christian common weale.
But for a it is a word of disdaine, know no such calling allowed in the law.
And whereas you speake of delaies and shiftes vsed by lawyers, whereby they hinder and vndoe many; you must vnderstand, that seeing the causes and sutes in this land are many, as is aforsaid, and seeing there is a prioritie of one sute before another, in regard of the commencement thereof, and therefore also must needs be a prioritie in the proceeding therein, and likewise also in the hearing and determining of the same,
euerie one being heard in his course, some competent and reasonable time must therefore be allowed vnto euerie cause, for the continuance thereof.
But if there be any that professe the law, that are either so vnskilfull and vnlearned that they cannot councell their clients for their best expedition, or so couetously bent, and so addicted to gaine and lucre, that they will for their owne benefite, protract and delay any mans cause, (as amongst many, of what degree or calling soeuer, there are some bad) seeing there are others (God be thanked) a great many, that are conscionable and honest, and againe learned and wise; if any fall into the hands of the former vnlearned or vngodly lawyer, it is to be accounted his owne folly, for that he, when it was his owne election to retaine whom he list, would make choice of such a one, when he might as easily and with as small cost, haue had him that had bin learned and godly.
But in deed commonly the fault is in the clients themselues, who are so
cruelly and spitefully bent, that what lawyer soeuer they haue, they will themselues seeke infinite waies and deuises to delaie their sutes, and to detaine their aduersaries a long time in trouble and expence of law: insomuch as haue credibly heard of some, who knowing their cause to be vniust, and yet also knowing themselues of wealth and abilitie to exceed those against whom they haue delt, and therefore meaning by reason of their wealth to suppresse the truth, and by long delaies so to impouerish their aduersary, as they should neuer be able to bring the cause to hearing, haue in the bitternesse of their heart, and in the heat of their furie, vttered these words; will not leaue him worth a great.
will make him daunce the beggers galliard before haue done with him, with such other cruell and vnchristian speeches.
And these and such like minded men, for the better effecting of this their wicked intention, labor and endeuour to seeke vnto themselues such lawyers as will sit their humors:
wherevpon if God for the hardening of their hearts, doe send them vnto to such a one, then they haue their desire: if otherwise they light vpon such a lawyer that will not fauour nor further that their extreame bitternesse and cruelty, then they themselues partly by wrong informations giuen to their lawyer, and partly by other subtill and secret practises, find out the means to delay lengthen their suits, and to hold, detaine, and keepe both themselues, and their aduersaries, in long and tedious actions, to the poore mens great decay and impouerishment, if not to their vtter vndoing.
By means whereof, the law is euill spoken of, and the lawyers are slaundered, whereas indeed the law it selfe is good and holy, and may be well vsed, and so is by a great many of the professours thereof; and when it is otherwise administred, the fault is not in the law, but in the practisers thereof, that are defectiue either in learning or conscience, but most commonly in the clients themselues.
As you thought me to speake ill of Lawyers vpon spleene onely, by reason of some grieuance receiued by or from some of them, so thinke that you speake well of Lawyers, by reason of some fauour or good done vnto you by some Lawyer, as partly it appears by the dedication of your booke.
There were many better men, and greater in account, more likely to gratifie you than a Lawyer.
As he that iustifieth the wicked, is subiect to woe, so he that condemneth the godly, is subiect to woe: as it is a sinne to arrogate for him that deserueth ill, so it is a sinne to derogate from him that deserueth well: you can not denie but all that haue said concerning the law, and the professours, generally is true.
seeme to charge me with some benefit past which makes me partiall, confesse that euen he was the pleader, and that by his learning and paines (yea, without fee) he deliuered me from a greedy Informer, who through his subtiltie and my simplicitie, had condemned me in a hundred marks more than was worth: to which worshipful Lawyer dedicate this my labour, thinking it a sufficient gratification, in that it pleaseth him to patronize the same, and me also, who as a poore Doue among Kites Crowes, am throwne into the world into many dangers, and hard aduentures; whose loue and faithfull friendship towards me, assure my selfe, is sealed and deliuered; whose readinesse likewise to helpe all such as are helplesse, if it be desired, and whose vprightnesse in his profession towards all, hath many yeares appeared.
And shall suffer this man to be obscure? no, no, will not; no, he is not; no, if I, you, and more with vs, both tooke in hand to dimme that
he hath done, the saincts in earth would praise him, and the angels in heauen would pray for him, that God might regard and reward him.
Now therefore pray you what is your opinion and iudgement of Phisitions? they robbe men of their liuings, and spoile men of their liues; vnder the pretence of doing good, they heale few and kil many.
Phisicke is a putting too, and a taking from; that is to say, It doth adde, encrease, strengthen, and augment good blood; where it is decaied, by age, by imperfection of nature, by surfait, or by any other means howsoeuer: and it doth take away, cut off, kill, destroy, purge, or by some such way, it doth discharge the body of that which is ouer aboue nature, as of chollor, rheume, corrupt blood, impostumes, &c.
The body of man is subiect to infinite diseases, and therefore through the corruption therof, it is likened by the holy Ghost,
to a filthie clout, or the cloath of a menstruous woman.
It is subiect to the leprosie, to the pluresie, to the dropsie, to the frensie, to the palsie, to the botch, to the canker, and to other infinit diseases, which will soone infect, ouerrunne,
and destroy the body, if it be not aided, maintained, supported, and defended by Phisicke: whence our sauiour Christ said, The whole haue no need of the Phisition; as well to confound the opinion of those that trusted in their owne righteousnes, as also to shew that it was a matter necessarie requisite,
that he which was sicke should seeke to the Phisition.
Answerable to this, Iesus the grandfather, and Iesus the nephew, gaue in commaundement highly to esteeme, and reuerently to account of the Phisition, with this great word, Honor, which indeed is a word of great dignitie, and commonly yeelded to Lords of nobilitie.
Honor (saith he) the Phisition, with that honor which is due vnto him, which is as much to say, He deserueth to be honored, it doth pertaine vnto him; it is his right and his duetie to be had in aestimation, and to be reuerenced, not because it doth any way good vnto him, not that he hath any vse of thy honour, reuerence, or seruice,
but in respect of thy owne necessitie, for thine owne need; thou shalt haue continuall occasion to vse him, Honor therefore the Phisition, because of necessitie.
And for another reason he is to be honored, because the Lord hath created him, the Lord hath ordained and constituted him forthy sake, and for thy good: as thou wilt not be found to neglect the good gifts, the good ordinances of almightie God, Honor the Phisition.
third reason enforceth this honor, to weet, his studie, his calling and his profession, which commeth of God, his maiestie hath created it, he it is that hath instituted and ordained it.
If Phisicke be not the ordinance of Almightie God, would faine know what vse haue we of diuerse roots, hearbs, flowers, trees, plants, licours, and many other things, in beasts, in foules, in fish, and creeping creatures, whose effects are verie strange and wonderfull, all working the health and preseruation of mans bodie? or were they created in vaine?
we haue in our knowledge no other vse of the Rose, than the sight, the sappe, and the sauour, yet it hath many other excellent vses and effects, simple, or compounded.
What shalbe done with the Toad, the Ant, the Adder, and such small things? all the creatures of God are good,
as he himselfe veresieth, and as the proofe thereof plainely sheweth.
They are to be vsed in their season, and to be taken in their kinde, so shall we haue vse and comfort by them.
Luke the Euangelist, was a Phisition in Antioch, whom Christ would not haue accounted, much lesse appointed for an Apostle, if his profession had not beene lawfull and necessarie.
And why shal stand colouring of pure Corrall? or preseruing of pure Ciuet, that will neuer leese his sauour? as the one will not receiue to it, and the other will not leese from it; euen so Phisicke is so exquisitely excellent, that it need not haue any counterfait helpe: and the other haue their commission so lawfull, that they cannot be condemned, nor
Nature and Necessitie are two handmaids that attend vpon Phisitions, the one enforced to seeke their helpe, the other inforced to yeeld the~ their guerdon reward.
As it is to be proued by Gods word, damnable sin for a man to kill himselfe with fire, water, sword, or with such like; so is it sinne for a man to destroy himselfe in not seeking after Phisitions and Chirurgions, when time and opportunitie is offred for recouery.
As men may be too carefull in seeking after Phisitions to remoue the diseases of their bodies: so may they be too too carelesse in seeking after Christ, to remoue the sinnes of their soules.
Whence comes all maner of infirmities and diseases of the bodie? comes it not from the sinnes of the soule? All the inconueniences, dangers,
miseries, troubles, and wretchednesse whatsoeuer vpon the body, comes as a punishment for the sinne of the soule.
good Phisition or Surgion will first remoue the cause, ere
he begin to heale, euen so he that enterpriseth his health, must first of all goe vnto Iesus Christ, the Phisition of the soule, that the cause may be remoued, then Phisicke hath vertue and power to heale, and not before.
All power of healing and doing good, proceeds from him.
As the vertue attractiue, to draw Elisha from his worke, was not in Elias cloake,
but in the power of the word: euen so the vertue of healing is not in the Phisitions, nor any thing they take in hand, but in the Lord of life.
the Lord hath created medicins, God hath giuen men knowledge, that he might be glorified in his wonderfull workes.
Men may not seeke to Phisitions, (nor blame them if they be not healed) when they must seeke to God; neither may they seeke to God, when they should seeke to Phisitions.
The best Phisition ca~not heale, where God sets not to his hand,
As for their liues and conuersations, to speake truely, and
in the feare of God indifferently, take them for the most part to be men most ciuill in their behauiour, chast in their bodies, moderate in their diet, and most religious in the seruice of almightie God.
And so end for the Phisition, desiring God to increase his graces in them, and to blesse their labours in others.
Men doe hurt and endamage themselues, by committing their bodies into the hands of such as are not warranted by the degrees of learning to be Phisitions indeed.
If you adhibit any credit to my councell, be sure to know the knowledge and the conscience of the Phisition, before you commit your life into his hands; euerie one cannot heale a sore, that can make a salue: so euerie one is not a Phisition, that makes the profession.
You haue said well for the Lawyer the Phisition, now pray you what is your iudgement concerning preachers and ministers? for all the world saith, they feed themselues with the sweat of other mens browes.
Whilst they are busied with the cares of their wiues and their children, they starue the soules of Gods people: and their ill life marres all.
YOu blame the ministers for neglecting their charge, and for their ill life and conuersation; you make no exception, you conclude all and euerie one within the compasse of your condemnation, as the Pope doth comprehend all England within the compasse of his curse.
fullest of pith, is smallest of strength; the emptie Caske will giue a great sound; and the bird Taurus hath a great voice, but a little body; euen so you, and such like, haue great will, you haue many great words, but God be thanked, no power to hurt.
And againe, that which you allow, is ill; that which you mislike, is good; because you haue no knowledge to iudge according to truth, you haue no conscience to iudge according to charitie, and you haue no place of office publickly to iudge according to iustice.
Your accusing of others, is but the excusing of your selfe; your medling with the ministers, shewes that you cannot away to be reproued; you hate to be reformed, as the holy Ghost witnesseth saying,
He that walketh in darkenesse, hateth the light; meaning that such as liue lewdly lasciuiously doe hate them that liue godly and honestly.
matter very stra~ge to be shewed, and hard to be beleeued, that vice should hate vertue, or that the sheepe shuld controle the shepheard: therfore
What fellowship hath righteousnesse with vnrighteousnesse? what communion hath light with darkenesse? and what concord hath Christ with Beliall? wherein his diuine maiestie doth shew the ods, the difference, the contrarietie, the debate, and the inequality that is between the right and the vnright; betweene the ignorant and the learned; between Atheists, Epicures, such like, the true followers of Christ.
The vnrighteous, the open the obstinate sinner, cannot away with the godly and sinceere man; the ignorant can not away with the learned; the cannot like with the noble, and it is too true, that the carelesse and vnconscionable liuers, will shun and auoid the company of the members of Christ.
You, and the rest of your fellow bretheren, and partners, haue no other quarrell to the ministers of God, but that they also doe disdaine, shun, and auoid your companies; there is such inequalitie betwixt you and them, that
they admit not of your fauour, neither doe they at any time feare you.
Therefore need not studie to answere your friuolous questions particularly, but rather in few words to reproue, and with plain tearms to reprehend your baiardly boldnesse, in medling with such as are so farre aboue your selfe, as you are herein beyond the measure of modesty, and christian duety.
Euery base and beggerly fellow, euerie lewd and wanton mistres, euerie prophane and rusfianly ge~tleman, euerie swearing and many such as make shew of honesty, and conscience of religion, in their feasting, in their gaming, in their riding, in their going, yea, in all their affaires, they will be medling and sensuring of ministers.
Some will blame them because of their conuersation, some will despise them because of their wiues, some will slander the~ because of their apparel some wil disdaine them because they be poore, some will scorne them because they be ritch, and some will condemne them because they be
couetous; some cannot like them because they preach often, some will disco~mend them because they preach seldome; and some will not fauor them because they preach too plaine and easie, and some will not loue them if they preach too prosound and deepe; some will not loue them if they pray for Bishops, some will not loue them if they pray not for Bishops; some cannot away with Latine, Greeke, and Hebrue, some cannot away without it; and some can not away with neither.
Alas poore silly souls, of all sortes the greatest, some mislikes you, scornes you, disdains you, hates you, and condemnes you.
how few are there that likes you, and loues you? But be of good cheere, (saith Christ) haue ouercommed the world,
The seruant is not greater than his master, if they persecuted me, they will also persecute you, all these things will they doe vnto you for my names sake.
Blessed are yee, &c. reioice and be glad, for great is your reward in heauen.
You are beholding to your selfe, and the rest of your bretheren haue cause to praise you, and to pray for you.
You haue condemned me as a man of no knowledge, of no conscience, and of no charitie, and you haue made others my partners and assotiats, that said nothing at all to you, to iustifie your selfe and all sorts of ministers good and bad, and yet neuerthelesse you assure your selues of Gods blessing in earth, and of aeternall fauour in heauen.
Good Sir, haue said nothing of my selfe, nor for my bretheren but that the Lord hath said and warranted out of his holy word.
He it is that condemnes all such as you are for medling with other mens matters,
meddle with your owne businesse, and to worke with your owne hands.
Vziah was strucken dead when he did but set his hand to stay the Lords Arke from falling;
and shal you remaine aliue, yea and vnhurt, that put your hands, not to helpe, but to hinder the Lords proceedings?
Christ did promise a woe and a heauie iudgement against him that offendeth a little one in the church, or in the society of the faithfull; and shall you escape this woe and heauie iudgement, that maliciously, wilfully, and tirannously, doe intreat and handle such as are great, such as are the ministers, the disposers of Gods secreats, and his heauenly Embassadours? no, no.
speake not in the commendation of any such as deserue condemnation, much lesse did warrant their iustification or blessing from the Lord.
If their conuersation be euill, and their doctrine good; take the one, leaue the other: their doctrine doth belong vnto you, their life conuersation to themselues.
The Scribes and Pharisies were counted hipocrites, painted Sepulchers, and deuourers;
yet Christ willed the people to heare them, so long as they sate in Moses chaire, meaning so long as they preached truely, and taught the lawe of Moses.
And pray you is the gospell of Iesus Christ more defiled, and of lesse force by the ill demeanors of the ministers, than the law was through the vilenesse and abhominations of the Pharisies? no, no, so great a maiestie, and so great might the preaching of Gods word hath, as it cannot be diminished by the vilenesse of the vilest, nor augme~ted by the vertue of the most holiest: and therefore it is a question generally co~cluded, That a vicious minister, preaching the Gospell truely and continually, doth more good and lesse harme in the church of God, than an honest minister and good that cannot or will not feed the soules of his people, with the continuall preaching of the word.
As a seale of copper, or of wood, if it be well
graued doth make as good an impression in wax, as a seale of siluer or of gold: so the holy word of God being well deuided and deliuered by an vngodly man, doth make as good an impression in the souls of the saints, as if it were deuided and deliuered by a most honest and an vpright man.
God forbid, yea, let it be farre from any man to thinke, much lesse to teach, that the vilenesse of the minister should derogate any working, or withhold any force or effect from so great a maiestie as the word of Reconciliation, for then Lord what good shall it doe? all men are sinners, we haue all sinned, we haue done amisse and delt wickedly.
We can not exclude the ministers out of this number.
saith; Whosoeuer eateth and drinketh thereof vnworthilie, eateth and drinketh his owne damnation.
Is he accounted an vnworthie receiuer in respect of the minister? or in respect of himselfe? if it be in respect of the minister, because he is vile,
&c. then must you make God contrary to himselfe, who saith,
The soule that sinneth shall die, and shall nor beare the iniquitie of another: and then you must also grant, that faith in the receauer hath no effect; which is contrarie to S. Paule,
who willeth all men to search and to proue themselues for the same, thereby to make them worthie.
If the receiuer be counted vnworthie, in respect of himselfe, then it followeth that the receiuer either good or euill, doth not helpe nor hurt in the administration of the sacrament.
As the vertue attractiue to draw iron, is not in the iron, but in the damant, euen so the vertue and power of saluation lieth not in the minister, but in the power of the word, wrought by the spirit.
As the raine and the snow commeth downe from heauen, and returneth not thither againe, but watereth the earth and makes it fruictfull: euen so (saith the Lord) my word shall not returne vnto me void,
but it shall accomplish that which will, and it shall prosper in the thing
Thus much briefly concerning the truth and dignitie of the word preached.
Wherein haue said nothing to excuse, much lesse to iustifie the vnlawfull and dissolute liues of some ministers, and least of all to pronounce them a blessing, as you obiected vnto me.
must leaue them as the builders of an Arke for Noahs safegard,
must leaue them as the curious workers of the sanctuarie for the Lord to dwell in, and were shut out themselues.
the Tabernacle, and the mercie seat vpon it, to shadow and to defend others and not themselues.
And must leaue them as the seuerall builders of Salomons temple, and were not of the temple of God themselues.
They are like to the Iews, who cried, The Temple of the Lord,
The temple of the Lord, this is the Temple of the Lord; when they most of all prophaned and defiled the Temple of the Lord.
the great and learned Philosophers, who with the effects of Gods spirit, taught al men the right way; who wanting the graces of the same spirit, could not find the good and perfect way for themselues to be saued.
And they are like to them of whom S. Paule speaks,
that were teachers, instructers, preachers to others, for the auoiding of adulterie, stealth, and such other sinnes, when indeed they were the same themselues, and so by the iudgement of God, Castawaies.
pray you tell me how are those ministers to be excused in this? If any of their parish offend them, they will preach it in the pulpit.
They wil rather than faile take a place of scripture fit for such a purpose, and one thing often.
This is a verie foule fault, and assure you it is misliked of many, and besides forsooth they take so much vpon them, as no man in the parish can be their
betters, and vnlesse he be a iudge or a iustice at the least, not so good as they.
Here you offer me occasion to speake infinitly, and world without end, of two things especially which you mislike in the ministers; one is their vnorderlie preaching, the other is their arrogancie and pride.
All scripture is giuen by inspiration of God, and it is profitable to teach, to improue, to correct, and to instuct in righteousnesse.
Here you see that the scripture hath soure profitable vses, and therefore it may be deuided into foure parts, which are dispersed here and there.
The first for doctrine, necessarie to confirme a man in that good he hath begunne.
The third to rebuke the vile and filthy conuersations of men.
It remaineth in the discretion of the disposer hereof, to take such a place, one or more of these, as the state and condition of his people requireth.
As he is said to be an vnskilfull Phisition, that ministreth a purgation to clense idle humors, when he should minister a potion or ointment to strengthen and comfort them: euen so is he said to be an vnskilfull and an vndiscreet Preacher, that takes in hand to comfort and to strengthen his auditorie, when they should be sharpely reproued and corrected.
The true deriuation of an Orator, and right vse of a Preacher, is to make choise of such matter for the congregation, as is easie, profitable, and necessarie.
All the books of God haue their particular vses, as the people ministreth occasion, and specially the Epistles of S. Paule, and the Sermons of the Apostles.
There is no one in the congregation among many thousands, but shall heare himselfe as it were directly pointed at, and spoken vnto.
now the guiltie consciences of many, will apply it to the malice or vndiscreetnesse of the Preacher, as if the Preacher speake against drunkennesse, then the adulteror will blame him; if he speake of vsurie, then the couetous man will blame him; and if he speake of counterfait and dissembling mourners, then he that wears a mourning cloake or gowne wil blame him.
There is such affinity alliance betwixt these and such like sins, as was betwixt Hipocrates Twins, when the one wept, the other wept, when the one laughed, the other laughed, and when the one was touched, the other was touched, ones ioy was anothers ioy, ones griefe was an others griese.
Euen so is it with the wicked and reprobate impes of the deuil, speake against one, speake against all; touch one, touch all, so wise they are in their generation, as they will not say, The Preacher or the Priest spake against me, but he spake against such a one.
Wherin they take away from the word, the maiesty due vnto it; which is
to reproue all men; wherein they doe disanull to themselues the graces that they should receiue by it, which is to comfort all men: and wherein they do arrogate to themselues a more speciall interest to the word, than indeed is due vnto them.
As there is no law by the which a Preacher for his doctrine may be punished, if he speake not against the Prince, so there is no diuinitie by the which a Preacher is particularly prescribed, or generally ordered, if he speake not against God, the mightie Prince of peace.
will turne my selfe to the censures and iudgement of the learned in this point.
AD pudorem cogendus est qui malefacit, hoc fit, quando malefactum apertè ac disertis verbis obiscitur delinquenti.
Alioqui vt est apud Isocratem, in oratione ad Philippum Macedoniae Regem.
Vnde fit vt generales istae castigationes vitiorum tam parum promonent hodie in Ecclesia.
Si quis vel potator est, vel auare agit, vel durius cum vxore aut familia versatur, aut etiam aliquod aliud, quod non decet christianum, sectatur studium: talis si venerit ad Pastorem, non debet recipi Pastore, priusquam pastor viderit emendationem.
Non hic habebit rationem personae, sed ministerij sui, non timebit inimicitiam, non odium, non amissionem facultatum, non exilium, non mortem, sed Deum timebit, cuius vicem gerit, Christum, pro quo legatione fungitur.
Sit discretio virgae quae seriat, Sit consolatio baculi, quae sustentet.
Multo consilio prudentia opus est Pastori, mille vt dicitur occulis ad speculandum vndi{que} hebitudinem earum, quas gubernat animarum Chrisost. in dialog. lib.
Non est fidelis ministri, prurietibus auditorum suorum auribus seruire, singulis conscionibus noui aliquid adferre in medium: sed diligenter obseruare quid illis immineat mali quod vigilantur sit precauendum; deque illo fideliter iterum at{que} iterum praemonere, etiamsi non omnibus saepe iterata admonitio arrideat.
Horat. eadem scribere vobis, me quidem non grauat, vos autem tutos, vel cautos reddit.
Eadem scribere, mihi quidem non pigrum, vobis autem necessarium; eadem scribere vobis, me quidem haud piget, vobis autem tutum est.
Quapropter haud negligam vos semper commonere de his, tam etsi sciatis, confirmati sitis in praesenti veritate, etsi periti.
would not willingly leaue you in any thing vnanswered, if happely it please God by your repulse shame others may walke more warely wisely in their owne profession, and not to busie themselues in other mens callings.
Let there be an inquisition had, and a proclamation made.
If there be any minister that is a gentleman, either in regard of his birth, or in respect of his degrees in learning, or els in consideration of his publicke place in the
that doth seeke his owne profit, and not the Lords praise; that doth desire his owne gaine and not the Lords glorie; or that doth exalt himselfe aboue the lowest of the poore members of Christ, by vertue thereof, when they should be humble; or that of enuie or malice doth for his reuenge draw the sword of Gods word against any man by priuat or publique administration, then let him be bound faithfully to doe the seruice of Christ,
Let him be presently commaunded to serue the Lord as Elisha was; and then let him be enforced to forsake his accounts, as Mathew was; and if he be not content to doe this, and withall to be a Iew,
to win the Iewes; to be meeke, to winne them that are meeke; and to vse all means to winne some vnto Christ:
then let Gods spirit depart from him as it did from Saul; and then let his place be giuen to another,
as it was from Iudas; let him be choked and strangled to death, as a theefe and a murtherer; and let his bowels be
drawne, and his body be quartered for the fouls of the aire, as a traitor co~spirator.
Christ made himselfe of no reputation, although worthy to be taken and esteemed among the worthiest, yet he abased himselfe, &c. as he said;
He washed his disciples feet, whe~ they should haue washed his.
He paied tribute to Caesar, when Caesar should haue paied him tribute.
Christ did it not to be praised of men, his praise was of God; he did it not to augment his owne glorie, for he had alreadie the fulnesse of the Godhead, but to throw down the pride of al men, especially of the ministers.
He cared not what he did so he might win a soule.
He thought his time wel spent, and his life well bestowed, if at the least he might winne some.
Let there another proclamation be made, and an inquisition had:
If there be any lawfull Preacher, how poore soeuer, that doth derogate from the worthinesse of his calling, the reuerence, the duety, the aestimation,
the fauor, the loue, and the honor that is due vnto him, for feare of men, or for loue of mony, or doth submit himselfe to my Lord or to my Lady, in any seruice that is not beseeming and meet for so great and so stately a professor; then after the first and second admonition let him be shut out from the society of the Saints.
Let him haue no vse of the word and sacrament.
Let his goods be confiscated to the vse of the poore, and let his body be buried amo~g the beasts of the field.
minister is not a man basely to demean himselfe: so great is the maiesty of his message.
minister is not meet for the company of mean men, so great is his calling: and a minister is not to be seruant to a king, that will make him seruile.
As the words of a lord Chancellor are said to be great because it comes from the King: so the words of a minister are said to be great,
Thence the Preachers are said to be the mouth of God, and their wordes a two edged sword.
smoke comes out of the mouths of Locusts: so Gods iudgements doe come from the mouths of ministers, by the preaching of the word.
As God said to Ioshua; Whosoeuer will not obay the wordes of thy mouth, shall die: euen so he that obayeth not the words of Gods holy ministers, shall surely die.
Almighty God hath constituted and ordained the saluation of all men to be receiued by the ministerie of the word, therefore he hath sanctified it, he hath beautified and adorned it with the vse of excellent creatures, with the adoration of Kings, with the seruice of all angels, and with the continuall presence of his owne maiestie.
Cornelius was an excellent man, a man full of morall vertues, yet the angell told him that he wanted one thing; the angell might haue told him that one thing,
had not Christ determined his perfectio~, his instructio~, saluation to be receiued by the preaching of the word.
The Eunuch was faine to admit of Philip to preach vnto him, to baptize
the might and maiesty royall of Gods most holy word! How may the disposers thereof be lightly regarded? nay, by what reason, conscience, or law, may they be abused? Will any man that hath a sonne or a seruant that is profitable vnto him in great matters, will he cast him off, deface him, and euilly intreat him? no, no; but these men are profitable vnto you in all things, both for this life and for the life to come, much more then ought they to be accounted, by how much the more they doe profite you and preferre you.
Naaman though a great lord of king Arams court, with his horses and chariots and all his traine waited at the doore for poore Eliseus.
fell at Elias feet and said; Art thou my Lord Elias? The noble Shunamite fell at Elishaes feet; and the great Lord of the Queene of Candaces court,
thought poore Philip a fit a meet man to ride in his chariot.
This makes plaine the authoritie and the great worthinesse of the ministers.
If the Prophets had this aestimation and honor, who were speakers of the law and of Christ to come, much more now the ministers who are speakers of the Gospell, and warranters that Christ Iesus is alreadie come.
As the Gospell is to be preferred before the law, for the worthinesse of it: so the ministers are to be preferred before the Prophets for their worthinesse.
Kings scorning the reproofe of the Prophets, haue bin defaced to the face of the world.
The ministers haue names of greater Emphasis, of greater accent and authoritie, than Moses, Aaron, and the Prophets.
Here now (my good Parishioner) make an end, with my harty praier to Almightie God for you, and for all such as wander out of the way, that hencefoorth you may walke worthie in your owne calling, and grounding your owne foundation sure, least being troubled with other mens faults, your selfe be sound guilty of slaundering Gods most holy word, being the instrument of your saluation, by slandering
the ministers of the same; to whose most mercifull direction, humbly recommend you now and hencefoorth.

The seconde part of the Image Of both churches after the most wo~derfull and heauenlye reuelacy on of Saynt Iohan the Euangelyst. etc.
[Figure: The same disciple whome Iesus loued hath wytnessed and written these thynges a~d we knowe that his testimonye is true.
IN the first part or volume of this worke (which contayneth the first .x chapters) are al the+se godlye matters of Ioha~s reuelacyo~ in course co~prehe~ded.
First of all is the hygh legacye massage of the sayd Saynt Iohan vnto the .vij. congregacions of Asia in the first chaptre mencyoned.
Wherin they are also vnto .vij. golde~ ca~delstickes co~pared their peackers vnto .vij. shynynge sterres in the ryght ha~de of Christ In the seconde and thirde chaptres are the sayd .vij. co~gregatio~s seuerallye yche one by it selfe descrybed and warned to the vnyuersall of the whole christen churche in the .vii. partes or clymates of the world.
Marke those .iij. chapters dylyge~tlye ye shall perceyue that the true christen churche is alone gouerned by the preachynge of Gods worde an onlye office of Christ co~+maunded and not by dead Ceremonyes commaunded by the pope of whom is no specyalte.
Co~sydre how those preachers through+out all thys boke are co~pared vnto a~d angels their congregacyons the ryght spouse of Christ.
The other be assembled vnto most filthye locustes breadynge of the smoke of the pytte bot+tomlesse vnto hatefull byrdes fowle spretes and deuyls theyr churche called the proude Synagoge of Sathan the most execrable whore of Babylon.
In the .iiij. chaptre is heauen made open and the secretes therof manyfested vnto the christen beleuer whom Iohan also representeth thys whole boke ouer.
For not onlye are the mysteryes therof in the vnyuersall churche perfourmed but also in the particular churches of na+cyons in the pryuate co~scye~ces me~.
In the .v.vi. and .vij. chaptres the lam+be Christ openeth the .vij. seales of the boke of the most hydden mysteryes of God for the .vij. ages of the christe~ chur+che.
In the season are the true ser+uauntes of God sealed vnto saluacyon solaced in their trobles and releued in their sorowe not withstandynge the great viole~ce of the truthes aduersaries In the .viij. and .ix. chaptres the .vij. an+gels blowe their trompettes.
Sygnyfyenge the preachers to shewe forth their massages appoynted of God for the .vij. ages of the churche manye wonderfull plages folowynge in the peple for theyr vnbeleues sake they obstinatlye resistin+ge yt or els vntha~kefully receyuinge it.
In the .x. chaptre cometh the myghtye Angell from heauen with a boke in hys hande all open and Iohan deuowreth the same.
Which betokeneth the ernest preachers of this lattre age of the churche wherin the true seruauntes of God shall gredelye receyue and also dygest the scripturs.
Take this for a brefe sum+me of all that is spoken in the other volume the resydue shall folowe here after in course.
In the mergende of that first part or volume put manye allegacyons both of the scripturs and doctors.
And there vnto was first prouoked by this saynge of Saynt Hierome in a serten Epyst+le of his ad paulinum monachum.
The Apocalyps of saynt Ioha~ (sayth he) hath so manye mysteries as it hath wordes or for euerye worde a mysterye whether ye wyll.
mynded also therby my labours to ease the readers for serche of the places a~d to sygnyfye vnto them that ded nothynge therin without autoryte.
And vn+doubtedlye the gatherynge of those pla+ces was so laboryouse vnto me as the makynge of the commentarye whych neuerthelesse thought wele bestowed for the confort of my bretherne.
But .ij. cruell enemyes haue my iust labours had in that behalfe of whom the one haue the~ falsifyed the other blas+phemed.
Which hath caused me to leaue them out in all that here foloweth.
The printers are the first whose headye hast neglygence and couetousnesse common+ly corrupteth all bokes.
These haue both dysplaced them and also changed their no~bers to the truthes derogacyo~ what though they had at theyr handes lerned correctours which toke all paynes possible to preserue them.
The other is Momus or Zoilus yea rather one which playeth both partes vndre the clocke of a christyane.
Thys cruell carper and malycyouse quareller leaueth no mannes worke vnrebuked mynistre it neuer so moche godlynesse.
But lyke as rust mothes maggottes ca~+kers caterpyllers with other vyle vermyne corrupteth all that is to the vse of man so doth this enemye to destroye both name and worke onlye for the aua+unceme~t of his owne preciouse persone.
His workinge toles are soche vnsaue+rye sophysmes problemes clenches corolaryes quydditees subtiltees seconde inte~cyons intrinsecall moodes with other prodigiouse sorceryes whom he sumtyme sucked out of his mothers bre+stes the vnyuersyte.
These hath he not yet all as vnsauerye morsels euometed for Christ distyninge rather with Aristotle than with paule in his daylye disputacions.
Of this ryall Rabiys peter iudged a fole and Iohan an vnlerned Idiote.
Yet shall his reader fynde small lerninge at his hande vnlesse he take an heape of barbarouse termes and vnsowed togyther sentences for matters of excellent lernynge.
But surelye Iohan will one daye come from Ephesus to visyte this proude Diotrephes shewe hym of his arrogant bragges to his displeasure vn+lesse he leaue of in tyme.
Sathan vpon the pynnacle of the tem+ple neuer bestowed his alleged scripture more peruerselye than thys Momus interpreted serten of my allegacyo~s nor yet farther from their right vnderstandyngeÂ· But forgeue it him with thys fore warnynge for this tyme though it be not the first lewde poynt that he hath played in case he so leaue his quarellyn+ge.
My seco~de allegacyo~ vpon the pre+face .i. Corin. vi. is not sett there to auc+toryse the Apocalyps as he most falsely and all contrarye to my meanynge hath interpreted but affermeth that the christen beleuers are christes members which ought of necessyte by the holye ghostes appoyntment to heare and to re+ade the wordes of the sayd boke.
For knowe that the Epistle vnto the Corinthyanes was written of Paule .x. years at the least before Saynt Iohans Apocalyps.
No lesse is he tha~ a false prophete that resisteth Ieremy rebukynge Babylon for her wyckednesse.
To moche it were to answere hys other quarellynges and to tedyouse vnto the christen readers and therfor pas+se them ouer least shuld be to plentuouse in answeringe a fole accordinge to his folyshnesse.
Thus by these cruell ha~delinges of these .ij. vngracyouse enemyes haue iust occasyon to leaue out the allegacyons in the margende obser+uynge this counsell of Christ concernynge soche as they be.
Geue not that is holye vnto dogges nor yet that is precyouse vnto swyne.
For the one of hys churlyshe nature teareth and deuoureth the other lyke a swyne treadeth it vndre his fylthye fea+te.
The grace of our lorde Iesus Christ be with the euermore (good christen reader) and with all the~ that seaketh of the scrypturs the sauynge helthe in them co~+tayned without quarellynge.
The seconde part of the Image of both churches after the most wonderfull and heaue~lye Reuelacyon of Saynt Iohan the Euan+gelist ce. Compyled by Iohan Bale.
UNto Iohan was delyuered after that he had thus deuowred the boke a rede not vnlyke to the metewande of .vi. cubites longe and a spa~ne whych was geuen vnto Ezechiel nor verye farre dif+ferent from the measurynge lyne in Zacharie.
And what ys this els? but that the administracion of Gods heaue~lye ve+rite is secretlye of him committed vnto them whych hath afore receyued yt and in faithe digested it that they shuld ther with ryghtlye measure discerne a~d iudge all thinges.
No~ other is yt to prophe+cye ageyne in this sixt age but thus to mete the temple the aulter and the worshippers therin and to proue them in length bredeth heyth and depeth.
And the quere which is within the temple cast out.
And the holye cyte shal they treade vndre fote xlij. monethes And there was geuen me (sayth saynt Iohan) a rede.
Both receyued the wysdome of God and also a mouthe to vtter yt.
So that my tonge became the penne of a redye writer.
For so moche as ab+horred iniquite the lord anoynted me in wardlye with the oyle of gladnesse and gaue me stomake to vtter hys worde.
The rede which God delyuered me was lyke vnto a rodde.
For hys worde ys the rodde of right order And the scep+ture of hys kingedome.
With this rodde spredde he oute the heauens and layde forth the fyrst fou~dacyon of the earthe.
This rodde of his power hath the lorde now graciouslye sent us out of Syon by menne hauinge his speciall grace as by Iohan haue dominyo~ here in the mid+dest of his enemies.
Aryse fro~ vayne stodye from cares of the bodye from consideracion of ear+thlye causes.
And mete the holye temple of God which is his congregacion or churche: Proue all beleues whether they be right or no.
Examyne their workes whether they springe of Gods commau~deme~ts or of mennes tradicions.
And in so doynge trye by the scripturs the from the chaffe Marke out the peple of God from the synagoge of sathan and delaye not to norryshe them with the swete frutes of the sprete.
Measure the aulter also which is Ie+sus Christ vpo~ who~ the full sacrefice of redemptyon was offred.
For manye false cristes are a brode in the worlde to seduce the peple.
The pope boasteth hym self for gods owne vicar Mahomete cal+leth him self the grete prophete of the lorde.
And both they to subdewe the gospell hath sett vp newe lawes.
The pope hys detestable decrees and Mahomete his abhominable alchorane.
Both thei ha+ue wrought soche wo~ders and soche sig+nes in superstycion as myght deduce in+to erroure (yf God were not mercyfull) the verie elect persons.
The mo~kes sayth that Christ ys in the desert the prestes sayth he is in the boxe but admonishe my peple that in no case they beleue yt.
The chanons sayth he is here the fryres sayth he is there but cou~sell my flocke that they go not forth.
For God dwelleth in nothinge that is made with ha~de.
Therfor now last of all measure them also that worshipp in the temple.
Considre them onlye to be his peple which seke hym in sprete and in veryte and that worship not in outwarde shaddowes nor in the elementes of this worlde nor yet with obseruacyo~ of dayes tymes.
They are not his sonnes that for the of the Pharisees which ys the doc+trine of hypocrites forsaketh the bread of children which is his lyuinge worde.
They are not his la~bes but vyle gottes that rather atte~deth to the voyce of strau~+gers tha~ to the trewe sheparde Christ.
And therfor the quere which ys wythin the te~ple cast out.
The prelates pre+stes and religiouse which are not of the common sort seclude from Christ from his churche and from the companye of true worshippers.
Throwe forth the bon+de woman a~d her sonne the Rome chur+che with her children and Mahomete with hys rable.
For the bonde shall not inherete with the fre. Measure not out that chaunsell of char+mers that college of Galaa~s bretherne those marked Madianytes and cursed Is+maelytes.
Allowe them not by the scripturs co~mende not theyr cou~terfet ryghtousnesse.
Admyt the~ not for the me~bres of Christ but iudge them to be the sinagoge of Satha~.
And speare the~ out of the kingedome of God with the keye of Da+uid.
For they are those swine that tread perles vnder their fete those cruell dog+ges that turne agayne to deuowre me~ne.
Medle not with that quere haue not to do with that wycked generacion.
Whol+lie are those Antichristes addict to the su+persticiouse rytes of the heythe~ in their sacrifices their ceremonies their obser+uatio~s their holy dayes theyr vygils fa+stinges praynges knelinges all other vsages co~trary to the admonyshement of Christ.
That they shuld in no wyse en+tre into the wayes of the ge~tiles.
Wher+for God hath detested the~ with his owne mouthe cleane geue~ the~ ouer vnto theyr owne fylthye lustes.
Now reygne they al in their owne wisdome thinkyn+ge euermore their owne fleshlye fantasi+es best: wholly they are become Ge~tiles.
And the holye cyte (of whom gloryou+se thynges are spoken) they shall treade vndre fote the space of .xlij. monethes.
Not the earthlye Hierusalem ys thys cy+te buylded of menne and made holye by the out warde obseruacions and ceremo+nies of the iewes as manye expositours hath fa~tasyed.
For of that (like as Christ prophecied) ys not left one stone standin+ge vpon an other.
But thys cyte ys the sure buyldinge of God grounded vpon the stronge fou~dacion of the Apostles a~d Prophetes euen vpon the harde rocke stone Iesus Christ.
This is the plesaunt possessio~ the wholsom howsholde the su+re holde and the dylectable vyneyarde of the lorde of hostes.
This ys the liuynge generacyon of them which feareth lo+ueth and seketh their lorde God in faith sprete and veryte and not in outwarde shaddowes.
These are the childre~ of pro+mes the true of springe of Abraham the chosen howse of Israel and the kyngedome of the holie ghost.
Pure cleane a~d holye hath Christ made this cyte by no~ other thinge but the onlye shedinge of his preciouse blood.
Thys cyte treade they vnder fote that kepeth downe the treuthe of the go+spel that persecuteth sleeth goddes pe+ople for it that defeateth his worde for their owne tradicyons that bryngeth in the Iewishe ceremonies the gentyles su+persticyons paganes customes a~d heythen vsages yokynge menne with importable burdenes of false worshyppinges for theyr owne fylthye lucre and auauntage.
Not withsta~dynge thus must they do styll by the sufferaunce of God tyll the .xlij. monethes be finyshed which ys not els but the tyme the tymes and the half tyme or the thowsande two ho~+dreth lx. dayes in that God shall shor+ten the tyme for hys chosens sake.
Thus after saint also before the lords co~+mynge ther must be a departynge.
The quere or chaunsel must be cast out the manne of synne the sonne of perdicyon and the aduersarye exaltynge hym self aboue God maye be knowne in hys owne colours.
It maye not be motte~ or allowed by Gods worde but reiected as that plante whych the heauenlye father hath not planted that the mysterye of in+yquite maye be vttered and perceyued of the~ which shal be saued.
It must be ge+uen to the gentiles or addict to their supersticyons with all lyenge powre syg+nes and wonders in all deceyuable doc+trine by the subtile workinge of Satha~.
They must also be permitted to do all mischef in vnryghtousnesse vpo~ the cyte+zeus of God tyl he vtterlye consume the~ with the mighty breathe of his mouthe.
and they shall prophecye a thousande two hondred and thresco+re dayes.
And wyll geue powre sayth the lorde vnto my two faithfull witnesses they shall prophecie a thousande two ho~dreth and .lx. dayes ageynst those enemyes to the confort of my peple.
So that though my cyte by troden downe by their cruell lawes of persecutio~ to deathe yet shall yt not be forsake~.
And though my peple be ouerloaded with their heythen super+stycyons and blasphemouse worshippin+ges yet shal they not be lost nor left all wythout socoure.
They shal haue my .ii. wytnesses with them to solace the~ in theyr trobles and to confort the~ in ther cares.
Both Moy+ses and Christ both the lawe and the go+spell both the prophetes the apostles shall stande vpon their syde a~d be vpon ther part: yea for so moche tyme as ther enemies shall vexe the~ a~d for so moche space as ther aduersaries shal troble the~ Euen a thowsande two hondred and .lx. dayes whych maketh thre yeare and an half and is more then the .xlii. monethes by foure score dayes a~d foure.
Which signifieth that the enemies shal not euer more kepe downe his worde but their dayes shall be shortened for his electes sake.
The scole doctours with their sophi+strie hath fantasied the sayd two wytnes+ses to be Enoch a~d Helias and that they shuld come then from paradyse terrestre for the same puprose because that E+noch was take~ awaye of God Helias was carried hence in a fyery charet ney+ther vnderstandinge what paradyse is nor yet knowynge what yt is to be taken fro~ he~ce.
Paradyse is the swete rest of God appoynted vnto the~ that depart hence in faythe.
The peculiar tra~slatio~s of Enoch and Helias were not onlye for a confirmacyon or strengthenynge of the fayth of the fathers for their tymes but also that they shuld be figurs of Cri+stes ascencion.
And what godlye wyse man can geue more to the figure than to the veryte: More were not they preuileged fro~ deathe tha~ was Christ though God wolde not then haue yt so openly knowne to declare hys wonderful pow+re.
Unlyke is it that God shuld cal wyt+nesses from the dead not promisinge yt by his worde hauinge powre also from stones to rayse vp Abrahams children and to geue the sprete of Helias to who+me he pleaseth lyke as he ded to Iohan Baptist and as he doth now to manye other more in our age as all the worlde maye se and heare.
These wytnesses are two for so moche as the trewthe of the lorde in the mowthe of two or thre godlye persones ought to stande.
These two wytnesses or faythful pro+cestours of the afore seyd two testamentes hath continewed with the peple of God sens the death of Steue~ for the mo+re part secretlye and vnknowne to the worlde.
But now they are come a brode by the appoyntment of God to the vtter confusion of the great aduersarye and manne of synne as Paule doth call hym.
And vnto them in thys sixt age of the churche the lord hath geuen the greate powre of hys lyuynge worde or the spre+te of his inuincyble veryte in moche mo+re ample wyse then afore tyme for the abatement of the seyd enemies or synagoge of perdycyon.
Clothed they shall be in sack clothe (sayth the lorde) No pompe shall apere in their aparell no glorye of the worlde in their behauer.
Neyther shal they be ac+companyed with a garde of ruffelinge rutters.
Neyther shal they with Annas and Caiphas syt vpon life and deathe.
Neyther shal they blesse in the strete with myter crosse and cope.
Neyther clayme the hyger seates in syde gownes shauen crownes and typpettes.
Neyther shal their be sacke fryres nor francisca+nes monkes chanons nor hipocrites.
They shal not disfigure them selues to seme religiouse nor saye longe prayers to apere holye but in a sober conuersacion auoydynge superstuite they shal co~+sta~tlye witnesse the truthe of God to the vniuersall worlde to his glorye and their edificati+on.
For sack clothe in the scripturs is a signe of sobryete sadnesse a~d temperau~ce as in helias and Iohan Baptist.
These wytnesses are two swete oly+ue trees shedynge forth the fatnesse of the scripturs a~d dulcet sauer of the spre+te.
God hath so blessed them that their lip+pes are full of grace.
He hath anoynted the~ with the oyle of gladnesse aboue their fellawes of myrre bawme aloes they dilectably smelle.
They are also two shynynge candel+stickes settynge forth the lyght or clere+lye openynge the hydde~ misteries of the scripturs to the confort of the ge~tyles glory of the Israelites.
They are not the lyght it self but onlye instrume~tes orday+ned to bere witnesse of the light.
Onelye they the vessels of eleccion (as was paule to carrye that lyght the worlde ouer.
They stande in the presence of the God of the earthe or the lorde of all as menne of most hygh acceptacyon before hym rebye to do hys wyll and to fulfyll hys conmandeme~t and pleasure hauynge the oyle of hys sprete and the lyght of hys eternall veryte.
And if anye man wyll hurte them thys wyse must he be kylled.
that it rayne not in the dayes of their prophecyenge.
and haue power ouer waters to turne them to bloude.
Â¶The Paraphrase. Yf anye manne wyll attempte to do them or presumptuouslye seketh by subtle reasons and deceytfull argumentes vpon daungers doubtes olde customes and auc+toryte of fathers to hyndre their office blemyshe their message and darken their suche fyre shal procede out of their mouthes as shall consume theyr enemyes.
The eternall worde of the lord that they shall declare (which ys the consuminge fyre) shall vtterlye destroye the~.
So that nothynge shall be seane of that they were afore.
Neyther cut showe nor corde coule nor graye cote bote nor blac+ke whode rother nor scaplar myter nor croser sandale nor frocke shauen crowne nor anoynting.
Co~sumed are they to ther saluacio~ that with Matthew become of Publycanes trewe Apostles and with Paule of ferce persecuters charitable teachers.
Con+trarye wyse are they consumed to theyr damnacyon whych beynge ouercomen by the manifest veryte wylfullye per+sist in their deuyllyshe errours with An+tiochus and Pharao with the Scribes and Pharisees.
And yf anye manne wyll hurte them thys wyse must he be kylled.
Eyther must he be mortified fro~ the olde Adam and changed into a newe man in Christ or els by the seyd worde must he both be iudged and condemned for the vtter aduersarye of God with sa+than hys auncient captayne.
And no deathe will be founde lyke vnto that deathe come they ones to the felynge of yt though they account yt now verye lyght.
For these wytnesses haue powre had Helias to shutt vp heauen that yt rayne not in the dayes of their propheci+enge but yet non other wyse tha~ by the afore seyd worde.
For the worde of God ys the verye keye of Dauid which openeth the kyngedome of God to the~ that faythfullye beleueth a~d that speareth yt vp also from the~ which dwelleth in vnfaithfulnesse.
For it is sayd in the dayes of their prophecyenge.
This powre ther+for is of the worde and not of the men+ne.
The worde speareth and openeth losoneth and byndeth saueth a~d da~pneth.
He that beleueth (sayth Crist) shall be sa+ued he that beleueth not is iudged alredye.
No moyster of grace nor godly wys+dome can lyght where sturdye frowardenesse is roted.
The dayes of their pro+phecyenge in figure is non other than the aforesayd tyme tymes and halfe tyme or the thre years and .vi. monethes of Helyas.
In those dayes shall it not rayne vpo~ the wycked they shall haue no grace to receyue the veryte.
In parables and figurs shall that be hydden from the~ that shall be euident ynowe vnto the faythfull.
With eares shall they heare a~d not vnderstande with eyes shall they se and not discerue.
For soche spake the prophetes in fygurs Christ in parables a~d the Apost+les in misteries.
The open truthe of this reuelacion shall not the wycked perceyue tyll they tast the plages therof.
Soche is the nature of Gods wisdom that thowgh it be not in gloriouse wordes fyne paputed termes nor in perswasible reasons of ma~nes wytte but in play+ne symple speakynge yet can it not be knowne of the worldly wise.
The swete dewe therof will not be receyued of the~ in the aforesayd dayes of prophecie but he that is blynde shall be blynde styll.
These wytnesses haue also powre ouer waters to turne them into bloude.
Whan they interprete and syncerely de+clare the pure berites of God which are those wholsome waters that restrayneth the da~pnable drynesse of the sowle that refresheth the conscyence and clenseth the harte of the synner they can not cho+se but ernestlye condempne the peruerse iudgementes the couetouse lawes and hypocritishe workes of the vngodlye.
And then is all vncleane vnto them the~ is all bloodye.
The gospell which was a stomblynge stone to the Iewes a~d mad folyshenesse vnto the gentyles is also now vnto them nowrye newe lerninge sediciouse doctrine a~d abhominable he resye.
Yea and they iudge them worthye to be burned that doth teache it.
Thus is it abhorred of them that shall perishe and neuerthelesse to the~ that beleue it is the powre of God vnto saluacyon.
Fynallye they haue powre to smyte the earthe with al maner of plages as ofte as they wyll.
Uerye are they that regarde not Gods truthe as the lor+de sayd vnto Ada~ after hys offence.
The frowarde creature wyll in no case knowe that is of the sprete.
The lyght ys hatefull vnto sore eyes Uerr peynefull is brede to the mouthe that ys not whole.
great mote was Crist to the Iewes as hys true preachers are vnto the blynde worlde yet to thys daye.
They towche their lyuynge they rebuke their falshede they conde~pne theyr wyckednesse.
They reproue them of synne of ryghtousnesse and of iudgement.
They force not to tell the~ of ther vnfaith+fulnesse frawde and hypocrisye of their philosophers prelates and relygyouse.
No greatter ys yt to the vngodlye than to heare of theyr euyll doynges.
No greater peyne nor yet greatter pon+nyshme~t than to haue their fawtes ope+ned and their clonynge colours condemned.
No wonder is yt though thys be here writte~ for thys age of the churche.
For neuer were more ernest wytnesses then are now and more are lyke here af+ter to folowe tyll the ma~ne of synne be fullye knowne and his kyngedome clerelye ouerthrowne.
the beast hat came out of the bottom lesse pytte.
And theyr bodyes shall lye in the stretes of the great cyte.
And whan they haue ones fynyshed theyr testimonye (sayth the lorde) the beast that came out of the bottomlesse pytte shal make warre ageynst them.
No soner shal the witnesses of Gods veryte in allages be taken from the worlde than he hath prefixed.
After no~ other sort shall they be sent hence than he hath appoynted by hys eternall decre.
Ioha~ bap+tist was not enprysoned nor beheaded tyll he had done hys offyce.
Christ was not taken condemned and crucyfyed tyl hys howre was come.
Paule was not putt vnto deathe tyl he had fulfilled his course.
The beast of the bottomlesse pytte ys the cruell craftye a~d cursed generacion of Antychrist the pope with hys byshop+pes prelates prestes and relygyouse in Europa Mahomete with hys dettynge dowsepers in Affrica and so forth in Asia and India all beastlye carnall and wycked in their doynges.
These maketh warre ageynst Gods wytnesses whan they hate them curse them blaspheme them and persecute the~.
Whan they withstande them with their craftes impugne them with their lyes and vexe them wyth their deuylly+shnesse as necessarye it is they shuld do.
For yf they haue trobled the head they must also the members.
If the howsholder be called Beelzebub the howsholde must suffre the same.
No better is the seruau~t than his lorde nor the massenger than he that sent hym. They shall also ouercome them not with the scripturs but with their beggerlye customes constitucions lawes decrees tradicyons.
They shall scourge them or dysgrade them in their synagoges.
They shall delyuer them vp to iu+styces debitees and rewlers makynge them their bothers a~d slaues so washin+ge their owne holye handes fro~ the shedynge of innocentes bloode.
They shall kylle the~ also by their cou~+sell to fulfyll the measure of their fathers that all ryghtuouse bloude maye lyght vpon them which hath bene shedde vpon earthe.
Yet shall they not hurte their sowles but through faythe they shall haue victorye bothe ouer them and the deuyll.
And their bodyes shall lye in the stretes of the great cyte.
In this worlde shall their carkases remayne where as they haue rewle and domynyon.
At their pleasure shall it be to ha~ge the~ heade them or burne them.
And thowgh they laye no handes vpon them for soylynge their co~secrate fyngars yet must it be done by their ghostlye cownsel a~d ordred also after their spyrituall appoyntment.
Non other is it to lye in the stretes of their greate cyte than after lawes as they haue practysed to+ke brought vnto deathe.
gloryouse name vsurpe they as though they were no~ of the world.
They wyll be called the holy churche good ghostlye fa+thers godly dyuines spirituall me~ne not co~siderynge of what sprete they are spiritual.
They are those into who~ the vn+cleane sprete hath entred with .vij. other spretes worse than hym self.
With the sprete of falshede the sprete of fylthynes+se the sprete of lyes the sprete of wytche+crafte the sprete of erroure the sprete of blindenesse a~d the sprete of cruelte.

By him are we onlye brought to Gods fauer agayne and gra+ciouslye redemed.
Yea all the sort of vs haue receyued of his habundaunt and ouerflowynge fulnesse.
The syght of this Arke in the temple is non other than a clere knowlege of hym in hys congregacyon.
So oft are his mysteries euydent as this temple is opened.
So manye tymes are they knowne as his worde is truly tawght.

Not onlye ys the last age appoynted to these thonderynges and earthquakes but they beganne also so sone as Christ apered in the fleshe.

woman was seane clothed with the sonne yea of IohanÂ· For to Gods onlye electes ys the veryte shewed to auauntage.
Not Marye Christes mother ys this woman though manye hath so fantasyed in their commentaryes.
But yt ys the true christen churche of whom Marye ys a most notable member Thys woman the churche (as Salomons cantycles specyfyeth) ys fayre louelye plesaunt swete wholsome dilecta+ble vndefyled as the Mone excellent in clerenesse as the sonne and gloryous as an armye of menne with their banners and stremers.
Thys woman ys bewtyfullye decked with the shynynge sonne of ryghtousnesse.
No~ ys of her that hath not done on Iesus Christ beynge renewed in their hartes by faythe.
Her chyldren are not they that persecuteth Gods worde no more than was Annas and Ca+iphas.
To the churche or con+gregacion of God are all other creature thinges haue the lorde vnto her.
She ys the ryght and inheritoure of them through Christ they with her to be de+lyuered from the bondage of corrupcyon to serue in liberte.
Vpon her head was also a crowne of twelue starres which betokeneth not onlye the twelue Apostles declarynge the glorye of Christes kyngedome immediatlye after hys deathe but all other godlye mynistres of the worde also which haue done the same euer sens.

Her true mynysters or preachers as verye chosen Starres sheweth forth hys glorye to the edyficacyo~ of other not their owne pompe aod magnificence And she was as ys the woman with chylde.
She cryed trauelynge in byrthe and was payned as one redye to be delyuered.
With Christ ys the churche byg+ge whan her members are in full faythe.
In the hart ys he euermore conceyued and delyuered forth soche tyme as he ys declared vnto other.
For thys cau+se Christ called them hys mother which had faythe and thervpon ded the wyll of hys father.
Of faythe in the first promes that Christ shuld destroye the Ser+pent was be first conceyued in Adam and Eua and so grewe forth in ryghtou+se Abell in Seth Enos Enoch Noe Sem Thare Melchisedech Abraham and Loth.

Which was soche tyme as Christ apered to the worlde taught and was co~uersau~t here amonge me~ne.
And this course haue she kepte euer se~s shall do to the latter daye in the~ that beleue.
Thus haue she had Christ in her wombe sens the beginninge.
And beynge full of hys heauenlye sprete she hath cryed in the Patriarkes and Prhphetes in the Apostles fayth+full mynysters as one trauelynge in byrthe.
Her crye was the myghtye and stronge declaracyon of Christes doc+tryne the feruent zele and desyre of the glorye of God and of helthe in Christ.
She trauayleth euermore a newe lyke as ded Paule tyll Christ be fashioned in her Christen members.
Wyth all her strengthe she laboureth that the promysed Sede maye increase in the faythe of all menne.
Fynallye she ys payned with labours dolours blasphemyes trobles and terryble persecucyons and neuer ys delyuered without them.
Neuer ys Christ ernestlye receyued tyll some of her membres doth suffre.
The constaunt sprete and inuyncyble standynge by the truthe in them hath conuerted manye.

The true churche (which is Gods kingedome) was neuer yet without co~tradyccyo~ nor with out the craftye assaultes of enemyes.
Adam was not so sone created but he was immedyatlye assaulted of Sathan.
Christ entered not so sone the worlde but he was bye and bye persecuted.
The deuyll goeth aboute lyke a roaryngely on sekynge whome he maye deuowre.

Moche more haue they alwayes delyghted in lyes and olde wyues dreames than in Gods truthe.
Therto haue they geuen their eares with all auydyouse gredynesse and superstycyouse deuocyon haue they embraced them.

Better ys to a swyne a fylthye puddle than a swete ro~nynge water.

In seeke multytude ys chrystes smal flock not myssed, for nor yet manye tymes in their abhominacyo~s perceyued to be absent.

And the dragon was wrothe with the woman (sayth sayth Iohan) frantycke and madde ys the Synagoge of Sathan whan their wanton ware is forsa+ken abhorred and despysed.
Than frette they for anger than swelle they for wodenesse.
Than wher they their tethe vpon the innoce~t sowles and wolde teare them in peces for verye spyght.
Tha~ Imagyne they newe cawteles and wyles and therupon procure they newe lawes to be made to trappe them in snares that they escape no waye. For the dragon in hys wrathe made warre with the remnaunt of her sede which kepte the commandementes of God.
All maner of wayes hath thys Ser+pente assayed to destroye Christes true churche.
The Apostles he vexed with the Pharisees a~d for the first age.
With false bretherne and tyrauntes trobled he their successours for the secon+de age.
For the thirde with innumerable Heresyes ded he acco~bre them.
For the fourth with da~nable sectes of Hypocre+sye ded he oppresse them.
For the fifte brought he the worlde into a damnable peace of Idolatrye and supersticyo~.
And for the sixt (seynge he can not yet preuay+le) he maketh open warre vpon the remnaunt of her sede. Now doth hys Synagoge of Prelates Prestes Hypocrites and tyrauntes make wycked lawes agaynst them.
Now do they persecute them for kepynge the commandementes of God in mar+ryage in receyuinge meates with than+kes geuynge and in not goynge out to seke Christ here and there in their Masses and mutterynges in their outwarde colours and shaddowes.
Now put they them to deathe which haue the Testimonye of Iesus Christ preachynge hym for an onlye teacher ne+cessarye for an onlye mediatoure and ad+uocate for an onlye sauer and redemer for our onlye ryghtousnesse wysdome and helthe.
For their warre ys onlye agaynst them that kepe Gods commaun+dementes and that haue the wytnesse of Iesu Neyther ys yt agaynst bawdes nor whores agaynst murtherers nor theues agaynst Idolatours nor Hypocrites sorcerers nor Sodomytes aduowterers nor glottons Idyotes nor lyars Idle prestes nor vagabondes scys+matykes nor traytours.
Non of these accuse they as their sessyons but the onlye readers of gospell and poore fauorers of Gods truthe.
Vpon the sande stande they euer more with their gra~de captayne to fyght thys battayle.
No~ other lawes haue they to grownde themselues vpon but their owne tradycyons and with soche fantastycall actes as they daylye make or procure to be made of Princes for their owne wycked purpose.
And as their lawes are beggerlye and wea+ke so is their vsurped auctoryte so are their proude tytles so are their myters their anoyntinges and pompouse func+cyons.
All are sande duste and rotten powder before God not grounded vpon hys worde.
Yea their selues are a grounde vnfrute+full sandye and vnsure fytt for the dra+gon to sta~de vpon to fyght agaynst Chri+stes members.
For they are the verye seate of Sathan and hys contynuall dwel+lynge place.
And that he can not do by hymselfe he bringeth euermore to passe by them.
Innumerable also are their deuyllyshe practyses their wyles a~d their subtiltees to vpholde their master as a the sandes of the see.
By the monstruouse owgelye and most odyouse Beast rysynge out of the see with .vij. heades and .v hornes ys mente the vnyuersall or whole Antichrist comprehe~din+ge in hym all the wyckednesse furye fal+shede frowardnesse deceyt lyes craftes slayghtes tyrannye myscheffes pryde a~d all other deuyllyshenesse of all hys malycyouse members which hath bene sens the begynnynge.
The excedynge presumpcyon of them that hateth the blessed lorde (say+ed Dauid) aryseth daye by daye.
Contynuallye thyne enemies growe alwayes they increace and euermore they prospere in thys worlde.
Not from the stedefast or sure grounde (which are the lor+des peple aryseth this beast but out of the see or from the fyckle fe+lyshyppe and moueable multitude of the vngodlye.
For the wycked sort after Esa+ye are the ragynge see that can not rest whose water fometh with the myre and grauel.
No peace ys amo~ge the vngodly (sayth the lorde) no vnyte no charyte nor mutuall christe~ loue.
It pleased ther+for the holye ghost to prouoke Iohan after hys secrete vysyon to describe thys myghtye Antichrist thus in hys ryght co+lours accordinge to that he had seane to the fore warnynge of Christes peple.
And the Beast whych sawe was lyke a Catte of the mountayne.
and hys fete were as the fete of a Beare.
behelde (sayth Saynt Iohan) an execrable Beast verye odyouse and hate+full to loke vpon rysynge out of the rauenouse roarynge see.
For the wycked auaunceth themselues as the grene baye tree in vngodlynesse and the Synagoge of proude Hipocrytes ryseth vp aloft settynge vp their cristes as doth the fatte Cedar trees of libanus.
All beastlye are they as was Elymas the sorcerer full of fylthynesse gyle and falshede yea the verye whelpes of the deuyll subuertynge the wayes of God.
Non other ys this Beast here described than was the pale horse in the forth age the cruell multytude of locustes in the fift age and the horses of incomparable wodenesse for the sixt. Seaue~ heades and .x. hornes had thys cruell beast not vnlyke therin to the afo+resayd rede dragon or Serpent.
ForÂ· loke what pestyle~t suggestyons in errours and lyes and what deceyuable power in sygnes and wonders hath regned in the deuyll for all ages the same also hath regned in the wycked members of hys Besty all bodye in the furyous byshoppes lawers doctours prestes Hypo+crytes and false magistrates for their heades are their vnyuersall craftes and their hornes their tyrannouse auctorytees vsurped primacyes or malygnau~t magistrates.
Thy stro~ge myghty power lorde (sayth Dauid) hath broken the dragons heades in the ragynge waters.
Thu hast smytte~ in peces the heades of the greateleathan.
Inhaunce not yowr hornes so hygh ye styffnecked Antichristes for the hornes of the vngodly wyll the lorde plucke downe and exalte the hornes of the ryghtous in the howse of Dauid hys seruaunt.
More are the hor+nes here in nombre than are the heades.
For greatter ys the power than ys the suggestyon the vsurped auctoryte than the crafte the Mageste than the erroure and moche more myscheff maye worke.
Thys Beast had vpon hys .x. hornes .x. crownes sygnyfyenge hys vyctorye domynyon and prymacye ouer the vnyuersall worlde and that he through the wyckednesse of the peple ys the vnworthy captayne and prince therof.
In thys onlye poynt the Dragon from the Beast the deuyll from hys members or sathan from hys carnall Synagoge.
For that he hath but in symple suggestyon they haue in double power of coaccyon.
Where as he doth but dallyenglye persuade they maye enforce and co~pell.
Where as he doth but easelye moue they maye by rygorouse auctoryte constrayne.
Whan he hath propowned a~ erroure they maie by their power establyshe yt for an infallyble truthe and make of yt a necessarye arty+cle of the christen beleue as they haue done of purgatorye pardons confessyo~ sayntes worshyppynge latten seruyce hearynge and soche lyke.
Wha~ he hath ones made a lye (as he ys the father of all lyes) they maye auctoryse yt for an vnwritte~ veryte lyke as they haue done manye.
Moche more myscheff maye they do beynge hys spyrytuall than he can do alone as largelye apereth by their workes.
Neuer coude Sathan haue putt Christ vnto deathe had he not entred into Iudas and so betrayed hym had he not entred into the Bys+shoppes and lawers and so condempned hym.
Neuer had the Apostles nor all other godlye preachers sens their tyme bene sent out of the waye had not those mytred Mahometes' and prestes wrought styll their olde feates.
Vpon thys be astes head was writ+te~ the names of blasphemye agaynst the lorde and hys Christ.
Which are non other tha~ the proude glitterynge tytles wherwith they garnyshe their vsurped auctoryte to make yt seme gloriouse to the worlde hauynge within the~ contayned the great mysterye of inyquite.
What other els ys pope Cardynall Pa+triarke Metropolytane primate Archebysshoppe Dyocelane Prothono+tarye Archedeako~ Offycyall Chaunceller Commissarye Deane Prebe~de Per+son vycar my lorde Abbott master doctor and soche lyke but verye names of blasphemieÂ· For offyces they are not ap+poynted by the holye Ghost nor yet ones me~cyoned in the scripturs.
What other ys yt but abhominacio~ the pope to wryte hymselfe the most holye father the ge+nerall vycar of Christ the supreme head of the churche and the onlye dy+strybuter of the treasurs of God? The bysshoppes and prestes also to call them selues their churches brydegromes sytters in Gods stede forgeuers of synne and our ladyes chaste knyghtes? Non other are they so abusynge their flocke in leauynge the iust office of syncere pre+achynge vnder soche vayne tytles after the mynde of Zacharye but verye shame+full Idols in dede.
Their decrees decretals Constytucio~s Canons Rewles Statutes prouyncyall and synodall tra+dycyons lawes fatherlye customes and vsages not grounded vpon Gods commandementes are verye deuylyshnes+se and Hipocresye blasphemynge the name of God.
For whye to haue the name of blasphemye vpon their heades is non other than vnder a gloryouse tytle to maynteyne that thinge whych ys blas+phemouse gloryfyenge themselues in the same.
The vngodlye (sayth Dauid) with mockes hath dysdayned the lorde and with open mouthe hath vttred wyckednesse agaynst God.
And the stran~ge fashoned beast (sayth Saynt Iohan whom sawe in thys vy+syon was lyke in similitude to a catte of the mountayne full of manye coloured spottes in token of inconstancye va+ryete and fycklenesse.
Hys fete were as the fete of a beare ferce rough and yll fauored in sygnyficacyon of cruelte stubbernesse and vn+clennesse.
And hys mouthe semed as the mouthe of a lyon declarynge hym to be full of pryde rauyne a~d excesse.
To soche beastes as here are mencyoned compareth Danyel vnder hidden misterye serten myghtye kingedomes of the worlde.
As to the lyonesse (which here ys called a lyon for the more cruelte now vsed than was in those dayes) the proude kyngedomes of the Assyryanes and Caldeanes.
To the Beare the cruell kyngedomes of the Medes and Parthyanes.
And vnto the Catte of the mountayne the vn+stedefast kyngedome of the Grekes.
Of pryde spoyle and roborye are the Assyrianes and Caldeanes condempned by Esaye Nahum and Abacuch the Prophetes.
The Medes and Parthianes hel+de captyue the peple of God as wytnes+seth Hester Paralipomenon and Esaye.
The Grekes most spyghtfullye were bent agaynst them vnder the cruell kyn+ge Antiochus as in the Machabees ys euydent.
No abhominacion nor mysterie of inyquyte as Paule calleth yt was euer founde in these kyngedomes but now reygneth manyfolde in the detesta+ble Papacye or monstruouse kyngedome of Antichrist as all the worlde maye se.
No where was euer more pryde vanyte and cruelnesse Ydolatry whoredome and fylthynesse hypocresye falshede and fycklenesse extorcyon vayneglorye and couetousnesse sorcerye superstycion and vnfaythfulnesse.
More than all the vnfaythfull kyngedomes vnder heaue~ haue thys sodomyticall spyritualte defyled with their wytcherye the temple of God whych is the Christen churche.
They haue most shame fullye abused gods chosen peple which are the vessels ordayned to hys glorye.
They ha+ue holden hys fre seruantes most myserablye captyue vnder their wycked decrees and tradycions.
The cruelte of Pharao Antiochus and Cayphas com+pared to their tyra~ny ys but as yt were a playe dallyaunce or shaddowe.
In them ys all letherye and vnclennesse all ragynge lustes and wantonnesse all fleshly abuses and beastlynesse no naturall order obserued.
Nothinge in a ma+ner are the cruell constytucions made ageynst the Iewes by the suggestyon of Aman and by Antiochus to their wycked lawes and ordynaunces.
For they were onlye ageynst the bodye theirs are ageynst mennes sowles.
So that the papysty call kyngedome of antichrist are to be sonne both the lyon the Beare and the Catte of the mountayne they not onlye partycypatynge with all vn+faythfull regyons but also doublynge with them in all abhomynacyons vnder the skye.
The mouthe they haue of a lyo~ roaryng out euermore blasphemies curses and bytternesse.
The of a Beare sygnyfieth their rauenous affeccyons ronninge vnto all pernyciouse euyls swyft also to the shedynge of bloude.
And finallye as concernynge aucto+ryte lyke as Christ beynge manne toke power of God to do soche myracles as non els coulde do so ded he of the deuyll beynge his wreched bodye to wor+ke maruels and wonders in hipocrisye amonge the vnfaythfull multitude by the secrete sufferaunce of God.
So that in all peruertynge power supremyte and auctoryte he foloweth his father Sathan yea in euerye poynt.
For lyke as he depryued sim+ple Iob a manne that feared God of his substaunce catell chyldren a~d seruauntes and vexed him in his fleshe with most greuouse botches so doth this gredye leuiathan this malyciouse murtherer the manne of synne and bo+dye of the deuyll with his deuourynge locustes robbe the poore peple of their sweare labours trauayle and necessarye lyuinge sparynge neyther sycke nor poore wydowe nor fatherlesse no goods gotten by mannesslawter extorcyon pollage Idolatrye bawdrye and all other vngodlynesse commynge to them amysse in their priuate confessyons.
And (that is most to be lamented) they defyle sowles wyth all super+sticions false beleue and deuylishnesse leauynge their consciences all doubt+full desperate and confortelesse.
Final+lye to conclude lyke as in the bodye of Christ dwelleth the whole fulnesse of the godhede corporallye so dwelleth there in this bodye of Sathan the who+le fulnesse of falsehede crafte subtylte malyce with power to worke all ma+ner of myschef effectuallye reallye sub+stanciallye and corporallye.
And sawe one of his heades as it were wounded to deathe.
And they worshipped the Dragon which gaue power vnto the Be+ast.
And one of his heades (sayth Saynt Iohan) semed vnto me as it had bene wounded vnto deathe.
And it was not so in dede for his deadlye wounde was healed agayne.
Euydent it is that in Io+hans tyme Rome the mother of all who redome had subiect vnto her the .vij. cly+mates or vniuersall partes of the worlde with all their powers gouernours kynges possessions pompes false worshyppinges and soche lyke.
Whome so+me writers suppose mete to be taken he+re for the .vij. heades of this beast.
But fynde an other thynge in it the bodye of these .vij. heades beynge but one and styll contynuynge so.
For thowgh all were at that tyme vnder her yet is it not so now a~d yet styll remayneth this beast.
Therfor do take it for one vnyuersall Antichrist (as ded afore) comprehendynge in hym so well Mahomete as the Pope so well the ragynge tyraunt as the styll hypocrite and all that wyckedlye worketh are of the same bodye.
The seuen heades of this Beast maye so well be his presumptuouse doin+ges for the .vij. ages of the churche as anye thynge els and yet no preiudyce done to that hath bene sayed afore.
What shuld ayle this wounded head he+re not to sygnyfye his supremyte suppressed his vsurped auctoryte and power dyminihsed and his whole prodygyouse occupyenge condempned in this latter age of the churche? suppose nothynge more vnlesse we haue eyes a~d wyll not se.
Are not now in ma+nye partes of Germanye and in Englande also the Popes pardons layed asyde? His power put downe his name abolyshed his purgatorye pelgrimages and other peltryes vtterlye exyled? and so lyke to be wythin short space in other regyons also? If thys be not a deadlye woundynge of one of the Beastes heades thynke there is non.
If thys be not an apparent lykelyhode of his falle there is non to be loked for.
But the healynge agayne of this mor+tall wounde is lyke to marre all and make the last errour worse tha~ the first.
In manye places where as the gospell hath bene preached the Byshoppe of Rome deposed sectes shrynes and sanc+tuaries destroyed monasteries prioryes and fryeryes turned ouer remayneth styll their poyson with those same instrume~tes wherwith they haue wrought all myschef.
Styll continueth their more than Iewyshe ceremonyes their pre+stybulouse presthode their vowynge to haue no wyues and their Sodomyticall chastite.
Styll remayneth their sale mas+ses of all abhominacio~s the principall their prodigiouse sacrifices their sensynge of Idols their boyeshe processyons their vncommaunded worshyppin+ges and their confessions in the eate of all trayterye the fountayne wyth manye other strau~ge obseruacyons who~ the scripture of God knoweth not.
Nothynge is brought as yet to Christes cle+re institucyon and syncere ordynaunce but all remayneth styll as the Antichry+stes lefte it.
Nothyng is tryed by Gods worde but by the auncyent auctoryte of fathers.
Thowgh the olde Byshoppes of Rome were of late years proued Antichrystes and theyr names raced out of owr bokes yet must they thus properlye for olde acquaytaunce be called styll owre fathers.
If it were nought afore thynke it is now moche worse.
For now are they become lawdable ceremonyes where as before tyme they were but ceremonyes alone.
Now are they become necessarye rytes godlye constitucyons semelye vsages and cyuyle ordynaunces where as afore they had no soche names.
And he that dysobeyeth them shall not onlye be iudged a fellon and worthye to be hanged by their newe forged lawes but also condempned for a traytoure agaynst hys kynge though he neuer in hys lyfe hyndred but rather to his power hath furdered the common welthe.
To se this also wyth soche lyke put in execucyon the Byshoppes haue auctoryte euerye moneth in the yeare yf they lyst to call a sessyon to hange and borne at theyr pleasure.
And thys is ratyfyed and confermed by acte of Perlament to stande the more in effect.
If thys be no healynge of Antichristes wounded head neuer is lyke to be anye.
Whan menne shall defende fre wyll and allowe their popyshe Masse to be a sacrifyce fatysfactorye for the quycke and the dead latoure they anye other (thynke yow) than the healynge of thys wounder He lykewyse that in an open audyence mainteyneth owr owne workes to iustifye by Dimitte nobis and other not ryghtlye vnderstanded scripturs doth he anye other than prepare a salue for the same? Nay surelye.
No lesse also doth he that setteth menne to open penaunce at Paules crosse for ho+lye water makynge for procession and sensynge with other popetishe gawdes constraynynge them to promyse the ana+uncement of the olde faythe of holye churche by soche fantasticall fopperyes as Bonner bishopp of London ded now of late to the lawhynge game and won+derment of all the worlde.
Alas how is the peple abused? Non other do they but mocke Christen princes with flatterye that geue them olde popyshe tytles and blasphemouse names of Antichrist.
As to call them most Christen kynges and defenders of the catholike faythe meaninge the Popes olde tradicions to heale the head of the beast.
This is surelye non other but with the sayd Beast to receyue auctoryte seate and power of Sathan.
Lete them therfor take hede least they be fownde the same Antichristes that they haue condempned and so throwe them selues double vnder the same plage.
Necessarye it is they be+ware what they drynke or what tytles they take vpon them at their appoyntment least they forgettynge them selues be founde dronken by takynge excesse of the Babylonishe cuppe and so peryshe with the wycked.
Marke here dilygentlye this worde head and ye shall well perseyue how wonderfullye the storye agreeth with the mysterye.
And all the worlde (sayth saynt Iohan) wondred at the Beast.
All folyshe carnall and worldlye peple not vnderstandynge the wysdome of Gods holye sprete depe~deth all vpon their beast+lye baggage thinkinge all that they do to be godlye meritoryouse spirituall.
They magnifye it prayse it and haue it in most hygh estimacion yea they ha+ue it in moche more pryce than anye thinge that is of God.
In no wyse wyll they from their olde frenesye soche is their excedinge blindenesse.
For whan they here tell their customes shall con+tinewe their gouernours agreynge to the same they clappe their handes for Ioye and synge Gaudeamus with the prestes.
Yea they worshypp the Dragon which gaue soche power to the Beast: With their hartes they reioyce trustinge vpon longer contynuaunce whan they se his head restored agayne in their rewlers the godlye teachers burned a~d the preachers put to sylence.
They worship also the Beast so manye as worshipped the Dragon.
For as they which worship Christ worship his father also so they that worship Antichrist agreynge to his lawes and decrees doth also worship the deuyll of whom he receyued his pryde.
They won+der with the Iewes that seketh cauyllacions to co~tempne Christes doctrine as doth the filthye familye of the dodypolles prestes and vnlerned lawers.
They worship with the heythen that admitteth their power and alloweth their factes as doth the folyshe multytude that neuer wyll be godlye wyse.
Non other iudgement remayneth in these dayes to these won+derers and worshippers of the newlye restored head of the Beast than ded vnto them that wyth double deuocion agreed to the abhominacions of Mahomete and the Pope.
And thys wyll be theyr saynge as foloweth in the text spoken in the tyme past for the certente of the thynge as the maner of the scrypture is.
Who is lyke vnto the Beast in outwarde glitterynge workes or in the obseruacions of counterfett relygyon.
Who is able to warre with her the worldlye powers now so depelye mayn+teyninge her quarell? All seketh the papi+stes that they can in the worlde Imagy+ne to vpholde the glorye magnificence and bewrye of their holye whoryshe churche or malignaunt muster.
No cau+tels nor leaue they vnsought nor vnserched out to cause the peple to este+me her of inco~parable power.
No small labour toke standyshe in hande in whittington College whan he made his mo+re than folyshe boke of reproche ageynst Barnes beynge dead.
Nor no lesse dyly+gence the wyse Poete Iohan Hontyngton whan he regestred in his Genealogye of heretykes without grace wyt and lernynge the names onlye of soche godlye menne as were the popes enemi+es no heretyke agaynst God ones me~cyoned.
Nomore ded Thomas Smythe Richard Dallyson William Stawne Steue~ Prowett frire Adriane quarrye the pardoner wyth soche other blynde Popishe Poetes and dirtye metristes whan they vttered their shitten and poesies.
And sure am that manye more be yet abrode of the same wycked zele and sprete to the great blasphemye both of God and his truthe now that the Beastes wounde is made whole agayne by so manye actes so manye newe tytled Bishoppes so freshe sale of benefyces mastershyppes and dignitees spirituall offyces de+grees and auctorytes as plentuouse as euer was in Rome.
And least we shuld be depryued of our newe plesaunt Euphrates and so be compelled by the worde of God to folowe the Monkes Chanons Nonnes and fryers in their bannyshementes.
We haue procured serten actes to be made for our commodyte and those onlye to be publyshed amonge the peple ones in a quarter or so oft as shall please vs to blemyshe all godlye preachinges of the scripturs.
Thus seke we our selues and not God our owne stre~g+the and not hys our owne glorye not Iesus Christes.
But lete vs not thynke that he sleapeth with Baall the false God, knowinge the most hydden toughtes of the harte but that he wyll within short space sende forthe hys lyghtenynges and scatter vs bryngynge our heyth+nyshe deuyses to nought.
For the kynge+dome of one fayth in vs and the pope thus manyfestlye in certen poyntes deuyded must surelye decaye.
And power was geue~ vnto him to do .xlij. monethes.
And he opened hys mouth vnto blasphe+mye agaynst God to blaspheme hys name and hys tabernakle and them that dwell in hea+uen.
And yt was geuen vnto hym to make warre with the sayntes.
And power was geuen hym ouer all kynredes tongue and nacyon.
whose names are not wrytten in the boke of lyfe.
He that kylleth with a swerde must be kylled wyth a swerde.
Here is the pacyence and the faythe of the Sayntes.
To this beast (sayth Iohan) was ge+uen a mouthe not of God but of Sathan to speake great mightye thinges and blasphemies.
So well is this spoken of the one as the other so manye as hath done vpon the Antichristes lyuerye title power auctorite or name.
Whan the veryte of the lorde was opened before them they gaue no thankes for it but became vayne in their though+tes wherfor God gaue them ouer into a lewde mynde darkenynge their hartes.
So that now thynkinge them selues wyse they apere more folyshe than afore.
Now speake they great thynges in theyr conuocacyons seanes and sermons and all are sore blasphemyes agaynst God his Crist.
Now must they serue God by most streyght commaundement with olde Romyshe beggerye though he most hyghlye abhorreth it a~d no scrypturs maye be red in the tyme therof.
For the scripturs must onlye pas+se as we wyll haue them.
How shuld the Beastes head els be healed agayne or how shuld our churche be knowne els to be his owne Image? Oh beastlye abhomynacion and most hellyshe decre.
Now must Christ be taken for no sauer at all without owr deseruynges.
The supper of the lorde that was sumtyme a mutuall pertycypacyon of Christes bodye and bloud must now be a newe crucyfyenge of him one traytoure playnge all partes Iudas Annas Cayphas Herode Pylate and the Iewes.
Matrimonye must be iudged vnclennesse thowgh it be the ernest institu+cyon of God.
No Popyshe vowe maye be dissolued though it be well knowne a matter so deuilyshe as hath made an hondreth thowsande Sodomytes.
The Eucharystye maye not be receyued in both kyndes thowgh it be the expresse commaundement of Christ so to be vsed.
Without the blynde bussynges of a Papyst maye no synne be soluted for that is the vpholdynge of theyr kyngedom wyth manye other lyke blasphemyes.
Certen other great thynges are vttered by this mouthe which now passe ouer least shuld be tedyouse to the reader.
How be it thys one great blasphemye that ys spoken can not leaue vntowched.
Where as they boast the~selues yet styll alone to be the holye churche by the onlye vertu of their vnccyons and shauyn+ges receyued first of the pope the layte secluded.
And vndre thys most falselye vsurped tytle they wyll styll be take~ for the redemers of me~nes sowles.
For they saye that their Masses are satysfactorye sacryfyces for the quycke and the dead iustyfienge releuynge and sauynge the~ both from dampnacyon ex opere operato.
And ouer that abhominable swarme of Antichristes fylthye mynysters make they now their kynges the heades most blasphemously onlye to be by them vpholden now in all their myscheues.
Tru+the yt is that a kynge is the head supreme gouernour a~d great staye vndre God of the peple to hys charge commytted after that sort their mygh+tie monarke also by the scripturs which they haue afore thys tyme denyed worshyppinge them for most holye sayntes which haue most presumptuouslye rebel+led in that behalfe.
But ouer that whory+she churche of theirs (whom Chryst neuer planted) is Sathan the onlye head by the holye Ghostes fore iudgementes here.
For to that beastlye brode gaue the Dragon hys power hys seate and hys myghty auctoryte.
God forbidde therfor that anye Christen prynce shuld at their false suggestyo~s admitt so blasphemou+se a tytle.
The deuyll (sayth Iob) ys the onlye head ouer all the chyldren of pryde.
That voyce therfor maye be blasphemouse as commynge from the mouthe of the serpent yf yt be not take good he+de to.
*And power was geuen to the Beast to do these thynges for the space of .xlij. monethes which is the .iij. years and an half of Helyas the tyme tymes a~d half tyme of Danyell a~d the thowsande two hondred and thre score dayes of Iohan.
Not onlye for thys age of the churche but also for all other ages and by other heades also hath the mouthe of thys Be+ast vttered great thinges in blasphemy lyes in Hypocresye and wonders vnder a deceytfull power.
But as concernynge thys latter healed head of the Beast the tyme therof wyll be short as here after shall in the .xvij. chapter.
He opened hys mouthe (sayth the text) in reproues agaynst God speakynge yll of hys name of hys tabernacle of the~ that dwell in heaue~.
Thys is in a maner all one with that was spoken afo+re in the .xi. chapter of the temple the and of them that worshyp in the tem+ple saue onlye that hys name ys here for hys temple.
In token that whan hys temple ys blasphemed (whych ys hys co~+gregacyon) hys name ys blasphemed by the same so ys hys tabernacle Iesus in whom bodelye dwelleth, the fulnesse of the Godhede so are also they that dwell heaue~ wherbye ys me~t the true churche from whom the angels are not seclu+ded beynge their fellawe seruauntes.
These dwellerrs be they that haue their conuersacyon in heauen vnder an vndefyled faythe that seke those thynges which are aboue and not vpon earthe that worshyp the father in sprete and veryte and that perseuereth true christy+anes to the ende.
Manye entreth thys he+auen of the lorde but all contynueth not in yt to the ende of their lyues the more ys the pyte. Power was also geuen vnto this be+astlye Antichrist to make battayle with the sayntes and to ouercome them.
Contynuallye do they with vyolence vexe by their polycyes auctoryte and la+wes the syncere wytnesses or preachers of the lorde sanctyfyed of hym through faythe in his holye worde as were hys Apostles lyke as ded the malycyouse clergye of the they ded resist them with their more than tyrannouse proclamacyons commissyons and com+mandeme~tes wyth cruell Pharao Ama~ and Antiochus to proue Christ in them the sygne of contradyccyon stone of re+proche.
They seke here they honte there and neuer leaue ragynge tyll they haue closed them vp in presons.
Yet are they not so contented tyll they haue ouercomen them in the syghe of the blynde worlde though not before God.
Eyther shall they be compelled sha+mefullye to recante or yf they persyst in the veryte to suffer most peynefull deathe.
By one waye or other they must be ouercome~ to holde the peple in erroure.
The Gardyner of wynchester was not a+shamed now of late as harde yt credy+blye reported) to saye vnto one that was accused of hys malygnaunt multitude whan he was no longar able to withsta~+de the truthe.
Master Seyton we knowe ye are lerned and plentuouslye knowe ye are lerned and plentuouslye endued with knowlege in the scripturs yet thynke not that ye shall ouercome vs.
No no sett your hart at rest loke neuer to haue yt sayed that ye ha+ue ouercomen the byshoppes for yt shall not be so.
For neyther Christ nor hys Apostles ded euer yet ouercome yow.
Their vyctorye ouer yow ys not in thys worlde your kyngedome beynge here.
But be certen and sure of yt ye shall be ouercomen to your moche more rebuke at the latter daye whan all wronges and iniuryes shall be reuenged which is not farre of.
Your lor+delye estymacyon (which maye not be hyndred here) wyll apere there not verye precyouse.
Yet do ye well to holde vp a proude pecockes head as longe as ye ma+ye.
Lose not an ynche of your hyght hardelye but with your gogle eyes loke vp lyke a manne with a garde at your tayle lyke a sort of tormentours in a playe.
And with your lyenge iudgementes ouercome these beggerlye vagabondes and burne them also rather tha~ fayle to fulfill the measure of your holye fa+thers.
And autoryte was geuen to thys Beast vpon euerye kyndred peple tonge and nacyon.
For non these Antichristes spare neyther hygh nor lowe ryche nor poore sycke nor hole lerned nor vn+lerned.
But a iurisdiccyon they must ha+ue ouer the~ though yt be vsurped.
Ones in the yeare must they haue them in confession to knowe which waye they are bente.
That salue haue they gotten in ageyne to heale vp their wounded head.
Be he or be he straunger be he a rewler or be he co~moner he must obeye them no remedye or els stande forthe at the sessyons with Christ amonge the+ues.
Not in one regyon or where as one maner of language ys vsed haue they thys auctorite but in euerye lande in euerye shere in euerye towne and in euerye famylye must they haue to do cor+ruptynge euerye mannes faythe.
For all that dwelle vpon earthe must worshyp thys Beast.
But blessed be the lorde no~ doth that in their hartes but they onlye that dwell vpon the earthe that haue their felycyte here that seketh the prosperyte of thys worlde and regardeth non other lyfe than therin is.
The lambes of Christes folde geueth hede to hys voyce they regarde hys calle they folowe hys worde they walke in hys lyght.
They seke for no ho+lynesse but onlye in hym neyther in wa+ter nor bread ashes nor palmes robes nor relyckes masses nor anoyntinges.
He ys their onlye sufficient wisdome ryghtousnesse holynesse a~d redemptio~.
His worde ys their lyuinge water the fode of their sowles the lanterne that shall gyde them and the lyfe that wyll not fayle them.
Non other doctryne do they couete nor yet other preceptes of ly+uynge.
Though they be here in the ear+thye yet dwelle they not vpo~ yt.
No con+tynuynge cyte haue they here but they seke vnto an other of moche more bewtye and pleasure not buylded of menne.
And for that they are redye rather to render by their lyues than to renou~ce the Onlye they which dwelle here doth worshyp the Beast louinge the~+selues better than God and their fleshe better than hys truthe hauynge their whole trust in the mangye merites and dyrtye deseruynges of these beastlye Hi+pocrites and no thynge at all in his swe+te promyses.
And therfor are not their names writ+ten of the la~be in the boke of lyfe which lambe was slayne from the begynnynge of the worlde.
Christ hath not allowed them by hys worde and promes.
With the ryghtouse are they not regestred as members of one mystycall bodye in hym.
In the similitude of hys deathe are they not grafted vnto hym as the braunches vnto the vyne to be partyners of hys resurreccyon.
Their porcyon ys not in the lande of the lyuynge with hym.
They are non of those whom the father hath geuen hym to partycipate with hym in one sprete.
Predestynate they are not vnto lyfe by hym nor so written vp in the fore+knowlege of God.
Chosen they were not of the lorde before the worldes constitu+cyo~ to be hys vndefyled childre~ in Crist.
In hym onlye ys the lyfe for he is the lyfe yt selfe.
Yet ys he the lyfe of no~ other but of those that onlye beleue in hym. In that he was kylled from the worl+des begynnynge is sygnifyed that he dyed for all them which were create to be saued and that hys onlye deathe ys all their helthe rayse and remedye by the promes of God.
For all they haue ea+ten of one spyrytuall meate and dronke of one spyrytuall rocke though yt came in the fleshe longe after them.
Se~s the begynnynge hath he bene slay+ne in hys members also as yt ys ryghtouse Abell Hyeremy Iohan Baptist soche other lyke.
They that are not wrytten of the lambe in the boke of lyfe for the chyldren of God are regestred in the boke of deathe for the chyldre~ of perdycyo~ reserued to eternall deathe for their infydelyte with the deuyll and hys angels.
He that hath an eare (sayth the text) lete hym take good hede.
He that hath an vndersta~dynge lete hym be admonys+hed by that which foloweth here.
Or he that hath receyued the wysdome of the sprete lete hym iudge hereof accordinge vnto yt.
Thus doth the holye Ghost aduertyse the faythfull to consider that what so euer thinges are written they are written vnto owr lerninge.
And he that kylleth with a swerde must with a swerde be slayne.
This warninge geueth the lord take it if they list.
He that vex+eth or afflicteth the iust beleuers in bodye by outwarde ponnishme~ts he shall be afflicted in the sprete with an inwarde darkenesse or blindenesse of the sowle that he maye be the more captiue to synne and to Sathan.
God will delyuer him vp into a lewde minde and will ge+ue him stronge delusion to beleue al ma+ner of lyes that he might be dampned.
He that killeth the poore innoce~t for his faythe with the pro~swerde or sleeth him with anye other torment with the swerde of the sprete (which is the lordes worde) shall he be both iudged and condempned.
The worde that haue spoke~ (sayth Christ) shall iudge them at the lat+ter daye.
And this is in maner all one with that was sayed in the .xi. chapter afore.
If anye manne will hurte the~ fyre shall procede out of their mouthes and consume their enemies.
For here in this life is the pacience of the sayntes proued a~d their faithe required.
Here was Abraha~ tempted and Iob sore vexed and both they were founde Gode true faythfull seruauntes.
Here were the Apostles con+tempned reioysinge that they were fou~de worthye for Christes sake to suffer re+buke.
The rightouse the lorde trieth as golde in the fornace.
He chasteneth euerye seruaunt that he loueth and scourgeth euerye sonne that he receyueth.
On+lye is it faythe that all the euyls of this worlde by pacience ouerco~meth and so obtayneth the victorye.
The frute which riseth to eternall lyfe is peaceable sufferaunce in faythe.
And that must be here in this lyfe where as we are vnperfight to make vs perfight.
And he dyd all that the fyrst Beast coulde do.
to worship the first Beast whose dead+lye wounde was healed.
And deceyued the~ that dwel+te on the earthe by the meanes of those sygnes which he had po+wer to do in the syght of the Be+aste.
sayenge to the~ that dwel+te on the earthe that they shulde an Image.
vnto the Beaste which had the wounde of a swerde and dyd lyue.
And behelde (sayth saynt Iohan) in thys secrete reuelacyon of my lorde an other Beast arysynge out of the earthe.
figure ys thys of all false Prophetes a~d vngodlye preachers.
Beastlye are they euermore vayne carnall and corrupt in their stodyes abhominable in the of their wicked hartes not sehin+ge God but their bellyes not Christes glorye but their owne pryde and vayne glorye.
From the earthe they aryse all geuen to earthlye wysdome.
The onlye affectes of thys worlde doth moue the~ to teache a~d no good zele of the truthe.
Eyther are they tyckled with ambytion prycked with auaryce or els sturred with malyce to inueye.
Thys goynge vp haue they fro~ wyckednesse to wyckednesse shall haue still tyll the lorde destroye the~ lyke as haue the iust beleuers fro~ to vertu in the sprete tyll soche tyme as they see hym face vnto face in the euerlastynge Syon.
From the worldes begynnynge hath this Beast rysen vp in Cayn the first murtherer in the fleshelye chyldren of menne in Cham the shamelesse chylde of Noe in Ismael and Esau in Iannes and Iambres in Balaham and Baals prophetes in the Beniamytes and Bels chaplaynes in Phassur and Semeins in Iudas Annas and Cayphas in Barichu and Diotrephes.
And now sens their tyme most of all in Mahumetes doctours and the Popes queresters.
Yea styll they are aloft in their beastlye beggerye and wyll be tyll their mysschef be fynyshed.
Who seeth not now adayes that hath lyght in the sprete the malygnyte Hypocresye crafte and deceyt in serte~ false Prophetes at Paules crosse in London and in other places els. This Beast had .ij. hornes lyke the la~be at blushe but all counterfett and false in verye dede for he spake as ded the Dragon.
The hornes of Christ are hys hygh kyngedome in the worde.
Onlye aryseth hys churche by faythe in the glad tydynges and promysys of God.
That worde ys the scepture of Christes power and the rodde of ryght order where as he regneth.
Non other straunge scepturs are there neyther tradycyo~s nor customes.
Seuen hornes had Christ for in hym was the fulnesse of the very+te.
This Beast hath but two and yet they are but false and
These are the corrupted letter of the .ij. testame~tes falselye interpreted and for a carnall purpose alleged.
And therfor yt ys but apparent Hypocrityshe and deceytfull yea cleane repugnaunt to the lordes meanynge not hauynge the iudgement of hys sprete.
Thys letter without the holye Ghost is deathe and nothynge perteyneth vnto Christ.
He ys the veryte and lyfe this ys but a fable or fyccyon.
Hys worde ys sprete and lyfe thys is but a brasse pot sowndynge or a latten candelstick, tynkelynge fantastycall a~d sophistycall slayghtye.
Though these seme lyke Christes yet are they non of hys but the verye hornes of the Beast.
For they vpholde Antichristes kyngedome and not hys a worldlye glorye and not hys for hys kingedome ys not of thys worlde.
No longar are they hys wordes hys lawes nor hys testimonyes tha~ they maynteyne hys ryght honoure No newlye practysed worshyppynges alloweth he for hys but vtterlye abhor+reth the~ all as thynges rawe a~d vnsaue+rye.
And therfor yt foloweth that thys Beast spake as ded the Dragon.
The doc+trynes and teachynges of these false Apostles and deceytfull masters are lyes in Hipocresye and the verye doctry+ne of deuyls vnder tytle of the veryte repugnaunt to the same.
Not vnlyke to that the Serpent sayd vnto the woman ye shall not dye yf ye eate of the forbidden frute but ye shall be surely as God+des knowinge both good euyll.
Alwayes they perswade vs eyther of stones to make bread or els to throwe our selues downe warde or els to worshyp the deuyll.
That is to change the good creaturs of God from their ryght vse as trees into Idols sylkes veluettes clothe golde and syluer into superstyciouse ornamentes chast Marryage into stynkynge whoredome and Sodomye with soche lyke.
To declyne from the dewtyes co~maunded of God to their Idle obseruacyo~s so makynge hys commaundementes of non effect for the bayne tradycyons of menne.
And fynallye to fall vnto forbidden worshyppynges or abhomynacyons of Ido+latrye of whome they are full.
And for these they haue with Sathan also their mangled to laye for the~ to proue that the helpe of dead sayntes ys necessarye their masses merytes workes more than nede expedyent the fyre of purgatorye a fearefull thynge with the deuyll and all of soche fantasyes.
These are the prelates of Antichristes churche the horned mon+sters or great bellyed Byshoppes ryghtelye described here of the holye ghost in this two horned beast.
These beastlye bushardes are not ashamed both to saye and to wrytte that in their myters they beare the fygure of both testamentes whose veryte they impugne with and nayle.
Verye trulye they saye that they carrye the fy+gure for in dede yt ys but a shaddowe they bere.
Not to gloryfye God but their owne beastlye bodyes with golde pearle stone lyke in a playe for hys truthe they most cruellye persecute.
These are the verye false Prophetes the instrume~+tes of Sathan the deceyuers wolues wagelynges Iudasses dreamers lyers Idols aduersaryes adders whelpes foxes destroyenge the lordes vyneyarde deceytfull workemenne desperate shepeherdes blynde watchemenne dumme dogges deuyls in+carnate wycked sede vnsaciate beastes whose God ys their bealy glory their confusyo~.
To all these to manye other soche doth the Holye Ghost compare them for that they haue with their er+rours and lyes turned the swetnesse of the scripturs into bytternesse scar+selye leauynge one place therof vndefyled with their fylthye dregges.
Thys Beast (sayth Saynt Iohan) ded all thynges that the first Beast coulde do euen be fore hys owne face.
The same lyenge power to deceyue in Hy+pocresye hath thys beastlye brode that the great Antichrist hath the same wy+lye craftes and the same beastlye kyndes of Idolatrye and so doth vse the~.
The same abhominacyons maynteyne they the worlde ouer that the pope maynteyneth at Rome and Mahomete in barbarye of Turkeye.
Yea the same supersticyons a~d sorceryes the same execrable tradycions beggeryes.
The same ceremonies haue they that he hath the same vnccio~s the same orders and the same Masses.
The same idle obseruacions with vnknowne cloynynge clatteringe and wawlinge are styl vsed in Englande lyke as they were vsed afore with no lesse blasphemy to God.
To do soche thinges in the first Beastes presence is to do them where his power and auctorite is raygnynge or where as is the seate of Sathan which is euerye place that admitteth straunge worshippinge.
Both the earthe and them that dwell in the earthe co~pell they to worship this first Beast.
Not onlye enforce they the~ to wycked Idolatrye that neuer wolde knowe the truthe but also manye of tho+se which hath great knowlege in the sa+me.
Oh how manye are in Englande and in other regions also that in these dayes worketh agaynst faythe knowle+ge and the holye ghost admittinge the prestes abhominacio~s? Rather had they to dwell styll in the earthlye beggerye with the blasphemye of God tha~ eyther to be out of fauer or to loose ther offices to haue their goodes hindred or to hasarde their lyues so swete are these wa~+ton worldlye pleasurs.
Rather had they to peryshe with the sonnes of and Samuel for abusynge the ordinaunces of the lorde and with Core Dathan a~d abiron for rebellinge agaynst them to synke vnto hell than with Christ to take peynes in pouerte.
But let not them thynke to be worthye of Christ that bet+ter loueth their owne carnall commody+te than his heauenlye veryte.
Well the Beast must they worshyp whose wounde is made whole.
His olde rustye rewles newe bournished and his olde Romishe ragges new patched by a newlye confermed auctorite must they enbrase in peyne of deathe.
Styll for a tyme must these terrible haue more worship tha~ God their tradicio~s preferred to his most pu+re worde.
And whye shuld it not be so? haue they not now a newe refourmed churche in whom the Beastes wounded head is newlye restored? So longe as it is lyke the popes churche it must folowe his rewles and cleaue to his or+dynaunces.
It shall not folowe Christ in faythe and in doctryne tyll it apere lyke that churche which he left here behynde him whan he ascended.
Fyre must be compelled to come downe from heauen in the~ syght of menne by this twohorned Beast.
The discyples of Antichrist with their byfurked ordinaries must violentlye from the true christen churche (whose regne is not of this worlde) the eternall worde of the lorde.
Then must they take from them the consumyge fyre that Christ sent downe into the earthe of me~nes hartes to drye vp all malyce and synne.
Yea they must depriue them of the clouen fyerye tonges which the holye ghost poured vpon the Apostles to the confort of all the worlde.
The treasure that Christ hath left here to socoure vs they must hyde vnder the grounde and the candle that he lyght vs to se ouer the howse co~uaye vnderneth the bushell.
And these wonders shall they worke in the presence of menne.
All redye haue they taken in Englande from the Bybels the annotacions tables and prefaces to perfourme this their dampnable enterpryse.
They haue streyghtlye forbydden the readynge therof for tyme of their Romyshe seruyce.
Some haue they burned and some put to sylence and all in the face of the peple.
Yea they reysed the maydes of a~d of kente to worke wonders and now of late the folyshe menne to fyght for their churche.
What practyses they haue had in that eare and that eare to fetche awaye the true fauorers and preachers of the Gospell at dyuerse tymes he that well considereth maye saye that the holye ghost hath here ryghtlye described the~ callynge the~ workers of wonders.
The discrete cytezen of London master Packyngton was slayne with a gonne at sa+ynt Thomas of Acres (as they call it) not without their preuyelegerdemayne.
But this with other of their miracles inten+de to declare more at large in an other treatyse the lorde lendynge me lyfe.
It is not longe ago also sens Alexander Sey+ton an excellent lerned manne with poo+re master Tolwyn recanted at Paules crosse.
Nor yet lo~ge afore sens good Crome was compelled to do the same.
And now last of all to take the scrip+ture cleane awaye they haue sought out great fawtes in the translacyon of it a~d thervpon taken them awaye from the common peples readynge.
Great peynes they take to put it downe but they neuer swerr yet in the settynge vp of yt.
Thus mynde they to worke their wonders tyll they haue buryed it all in the earthe.
They lacke now but .iiii. knyghtes to hyre to kepe yt downe styll that it ryse no more vp.
very of helle and lymmes of the deuyll how vayne are your stodyes and how wycked your practyses? haue no doubt but within short space God wyll destroye the counsels and dyssypa+te the strengthes of them that please me~ne.
Yet lete no manne maruele though they do these feates for the tyme.
For yf the gospel were taught without checke in a whyleÂ· shuld nothinge remayne of that generacyon neyther myter nor rochet shauen crowne nor anoyntinge a~d that knowe they wele ynough.
For the worde of the lorde ys the breathe of hys mouthe that shall destroye them and the deuowringe fyre that shall consume the~.
By the meanes of these sygnes (sayth the text) which thys Beast had power to do in the syght of the other Beast or whe+re hys abusio~s doth reygne with outchec+ke he deceyued the~ that dwelt on the ear+the.
Manye in thys age are wo~derfullye abused through the dysseytful workinge of Sathan in these horned. whoremongers but yet non other than are earthlye mynded.
Of some menne in dede the eyes are bleared with their craftes of some menne the weake iudgeme~tes ble+myshed wyth their subtiltees for want of dyscernynge the scripturs.
Some me~+ne are tangled with doubtes some trobled with terrour some tormented with feare consideringe that for thys newe lernynge (as they will haue yt called) some haue bene hanged as were the thre poore yonge menne of Sothfolke for the rotten rode of Douercourt Some burned some be headed for thinges of nought as ys knowne to all the worlde These thinges daseth their wittes and amaseth their myndes.
Were yt not that they moche more loued this worldes ple+asures than Godt it shuld neuer be so.
All the perswasyons of Antichristes prelates and preachers hath euermore bene and are now styll vnto soche earth+lye inhabitauntes that they shuld make an Image lyke vnto thys Beast.
Which is alwayes to chose soche an Emproure with other worldlye gouernours as shall be for their commodyte.
He must by the worldlye peple be compelled to ta+ke autoryte sceptur and crowne at their handes so sworne to maynteyne their fleshelye libertees.
He must also be fashi+oned by their wycked doctrynes and fal+se counsels in confessions lyke them in all superstyciouse lyuynge and in the ty+rannouse murther of innocent Christen menne.
Where soche an head Ruler ys appoynted there ys hys owne fygure made and where soche a Gouernour ys constitute there ys hys own Image vpp.
For we must consyder that this reuelacio~ is in all poyntes no storye spe+ciallye here as manye wryters haue thought it to be in supposynge an Antichrist to be borne at the latter ende of the worlde.
But it is a misterye compre+hendinge in it but one generall Antichrist for all which hath regned in the churche in a maner sens the Ascencyon of Christ.
And in this one poynt are all the comme~tours that haue seane most fowlye deceyued yea the best lerned of them.
knowe wele if there be anye yet to come he shall be but a me~ber of this.
Speciallye must they make a ryght Image of that Beast which had the wo+unde of a swerde and ded lyue.
This betokeneth that in these dayes they shall sturre about them leaue no vn+sought neyther anye false counsels vnfet fro~ other realmes to do their feates with and to fashyon the Christe~ Gouernours to their myndes.
As winchester ded the last tyme he was in Fraunce.
Af+ter whose comminge home manye great wonders were wrought in Engla~de and fyre was made to come downe fro~ heauen.
Consider the storye afore for the storye declareth the misterye.
He had a greuouse wype with the (which is the lyuynge worde of the lorde) whan he lost his monkes chanons and fryres his purgatorye pilgri+mages and shrynes.
For thowgh their cowles coctes and were of yet had they styll the same popyshe hartes and the same supericiouse frowardenesse that they were wonte to haue.
This myght haue bene founde true if it had bene serched serten popishe prestes of mastre whartons retinue not farre from Bongaye in Sothfolke ded calke for Crom+well and for other els, if the worlde had to their myndes.
write not this thinknyge they can harme by calkinge where as faythe is reside~t but onlye to shewe that their hartes are yet alyue how vertuously they are occupi+ed.
Manye thinges co~sidre at this instaunt poynt co~cerninge prince Edwarde who~ doubte not but the lorde hath sent for the singular co~fort of Engla~de.
Not that diffiue anye thin+ge to come co~cerninge him co~sideringe it onlye in the lordes powre.
But desy+re the sayd lorde to preserue his bringin+ge vp fro~ the co~tagiouse drinkes of the+se false phisicianes.
And this is to be pra+yed for of all me~ne if ye po~der well the text marke their wonderfull workinges where the beastes head is restored.
And he had power to geue sprete vnto the Image of the Beast.
and to make that the Image of the Beast shulde speake.
and shulde cause that as manye as wolde not worshyp the Image of the Beast shulde be kylled.
And he made all both small and great ryche poore free and bonde.
For power they haue to geue sprete to the Image of the Beast.
It ys sure+lye geuen them of the deuyll whan they haue ones fashyoned out the Beastes ryght Image or made of an Emproure a tyrt or set in the place of a godlye gouernour murtherer vp of gods peple by flatteringe prayses to encorage them to all my chefe and by wycked counsell to prycke the~ forewarde to make cruell actes of murther for vpholdyn+ge their beastlye
The sprete that they do ministre vnto princes euermore ys not the correccyo~ of synne the amendement of lyfe redresse of the com+mon welthe prouisyon for the poore nor the sekynge of Gods glorye.

Your magestes or graces are called most vertuous most valeaunt most wor+thye most wyse most myghtye and best lerned amonge all Christen potentates.
They are all but Asses in comparyson to your worthynesses.
If yt be your ma+gestes pleasurs to do this or that within your owne domynyon who shall be so bolde to withstande yow? No though Gods holye lawes be an hundred tymes agaynst yt.
Support the olde relygyon of holye churche agaynst te Heretykes and ye can not chose but prospere in all your affayres.
Lete it be treason agaynst your owne persones accordyn+ge to the actes of the Emperour Sigys+mundus and of kynge henrye the fift if they do but ones speake agaynst corrupt customes.
Make cruell apace proclame the~ abrode to she+we your selfes the popes liuely Images.
Our office it is to cause the Beastes Image to speake.
In hys sprete make vtteraunce without Gods worde of his olde Romishe rewles.

If other realmes report that ye abuse the dewtye of heysers or kynges (whych is the offyce of God esteme not their saynges but stan+de well in your owne consaytes.
Interprete the scripturs at your owne lust a~d pleasurs as your lawe master of Rome hath done afore your tyme.
Cause so manye to be kylled as wyll not worship the Image of the Beast or obeye soche wicked lawes agaynst the veryte of God as hath bene made by those Emprours that were the popes eldest sonnes by the kynges of Fraunce which were his yonger sonnes or by other princes els which were the defenders of hys churche lete no~ escape your that inueyheth agaynst our kyng+dome but make hauocke of them on eue+rye syde as of heretykes and traytors to proue the holye ghost true here in hys fore
For that is your offy+ce not appoynted of God but of Sathan.
And in our co~mssiyon fro~ him also we haue it to be no slacke mouers of yow thervnto.
So hath Christ tolde afore in this reuelacyo~ vnto saynt Ioha~ the Eua~gelist.
This is the ghostlye counsell that we the horned Beastes thus haue in co~mission to geue vnto yow fro~ the mou+the of the Drago~.
Wha~ soche an Image or prince is thus vpset or co~sty+tuted by auctorite (his othe ones made that he shall alwayes defende them) he maye in no wyse speake but out of that sprete that their co~iurers confessours shuld saye haue put in to him.
He maye make no lawes but at their spiritual ap+poyntme~t lyke as the Emprour Carolus doth now in these dayes.
Moche after this sore became the e~prour Nero this be+astes Image immediatly after Cristes as+ce~sio~ by the subtle slaightes of that spi+ritual sorcerer Simo~ Magus at Rome to withstande the Christen preachers Peter and Paule as largelye witnesseth Ege+sippus in hys thirde boke de the seco~de chaptre.
This Simo~ Magus by flatteringe prayses crep+te first into his fauer promisinge him hel+the longe lyfe increace of power and enlargement of his empyre with co~+tynuall vyctorye ouer hys enemyes in case he wolde folowe hys counsell vpon thys became he not onlye hys chefe cou~+sellour but also the hygh byshop of hys sowle and conseruatoure of hys bodye the preseruacyon of hys whole helthe lyfe to hym committed onlye.
All thynges after that was done vy hys counsell to stoppe the Apostles preachynge he taken for the Emprours most family+ar frynde and a manne most profitable to the common welthe of the Romanes and they sone after suppressed and putt vnto most cruell deathe.
And he made all (sayth Saynt Iohan) both great and small ryche and poore free and bonde to receyue a mar+ke in their ryght handes or in their fore heades.
Wha~ this newe raysed Image of the Beaste or sworne power to Antichrist ys ones raysed vp or admitted by their autoryte be he kynge or Reyser prince or other potentate he must strongelye defende that Synagoge of the de+uyll with whole mageste crowne and scepture.
By their onlye counsell must he than make lawes (for they must geue hym sprete) and sende out commandementes abrode that their holye decrees be obseued.
Commissioners and must out vndre that autoryte as wele to the clergye as layte.
Than must all be sworne to it and so obeye yt both hygh and lowe both Gentylman and ye man both owner and farmer both zyte+zen and townesman both merchande a~d plowgh man both mastre and seruaunt both natyue dweller and denyson.
Yea both Prystes in their colleges Monkes in their abbayes Chanons in their couentes and fryers in their cloysters must after their sorte do the same.
Thys rewle hath bene alwayes for the co~mo+dyte of that kingedome where as the powers haue bene thus by them peruerted.
Moche were it to shewe the manyfolde examples in that behalfe.
Charles the .v. now e~proure to make thys good and to shewe hymselfe to be the seyd Be+astes Image caused soche actes to be publyshed through out hys whole domy+nyon agaynst the Christen doctryne wherin all they are declared heretyques scysmatyques and excommunicates which taketh not the pope for Peters onlye vycar and head of the chri+sten churche non excepted neyther kynge nor Coruester as there are now dyuerse of the contrarye opynyon.
The artycles of the louanyanes vndre hys pry+uilege and the actes of the parysyanes vudre the kynges autoryte pro+clamed in thys present yeare of our lorde .M.CCCCC.xlv. wyll make all this matter good.
And what is this els both in theyr clergy and commons but to receyue a marke in their right handes or for in admittynge those artycles actes they graunte to obeye those blas+phemouse doctrynes that shall both corrupt their lyfe a~d faythe both their wor+kes and conseyence.
For in consentinge vnto errours in their faythe they spott their foreheades hauynge so their consciences marked with an hote yron.
In full grauntynge also to do them in effec+te they defyle their handes perfourmin+ge soche workes as are vnpure before God.
If they were gone quyte fro~ Christ that wrapped them selues agayne with the workes of the lawe appoynted of God before his commynge moche more are they gone from him that tangle them with soche workes of bondage as he neuer knewe as are all their Idell obseruacions hauynge no expresse commaundementes of the worde of God.
Onlye loke we (saith Paule) in spre+te to be iustyfied through faythe which by loue is mightye in operacyon.
And for them that so beleueth is this disiunctyue or put betwyn theyr handes and foreheades.
For all they that outwardlye kepe these heythnishe obser+uacyons haue not their conscyences defyled with them for their inwarde faythes sake though they perfourme the outwarde workes doubtynge the ter+rour of the lawes.
Yet wolde counsell them not therin to trust but at the worde of the lorde to go from it.
For though loth dwelt in Sodome yet at the lordes voyce he departed from thens.
This Image made also that no ma~+ne myght vye or sell saue he onlye that had the Marke or the name of the Beast or at the least the nombre of his name.
The actes of Iustynyane the Emproure shall make this good so shall the constitucyons of Adelstane and Edgare and manye other kynges here in Englande which for the ordre and of the clerge made manye polytyque lawes.
Specyallye kynge Inas Gouernour of the west Saxons which first gaue the Peter Pens vnto Rome and made him selfe a monke there.
But in thys spyrytuall generacyon amonge them selues is non allowed for a merchande vnlesse he come in by Symonye.
Non was made bysshopp pastoure nor but payed for it their taxed sommes byshoppes to the pope and the prestes to the byshopps besydes Irem in brybes.
Non myght els be allowed to vtter to auauntage the wares of the beast or distribute the rytes of that holye whoryshe churche.
Neyther were anye made free of that marte vnlesse they had the marke of the beast which is not onlye the outwarde sygne of their head shauinge and anoyn+tinge of their fingars but also the inwarde prynte of their consciences receyued by profession made to that wicked monster.
For lyke as true faythe in Iesus Christ is the marke of a christiane so is a false beleue in popishe tradicions a token of Antichristes mem+ber.
For the one foloweth the rewle of Gods worde the other hath counterfet workes of mennes prescripcion.
Els must they haue the name of the Beast to be called spyrituall menne or the holye consecrate nombre as his holye fatherhode is called.
Or at the least they must haue the no~+bre of his name which is a note of mag+nificence and worthynesse.
Lesse ca~ they not be called than lordes so manye as are sworne to that spirituall markett.
The most ragged ronegate and idle ydiote amonge them is no lesse tha~ a which is a lorde in the Lattyn as sir Io+han sir Thomas sir Willyam.
Amonge their vnknowne lattyn howres their masses and their dyrigees lyeth their plentuouse patrimonye in their portasses and masse bokes.
he that leaueth all wyth poore peter maye be called from fishynge nor wyth Mathew from the custome howse to do these offices.
But he that catcheth all with Iudas a~d Symon Magus must come from Symonye to do them.
Not he that is called of God as was Aaron shal haue cure of sowle but he that offereth to Corban with Annas and Cayphas.
Soche a worlde hath it bene and is styll in the worlde abrode amonge them.
Lete hym that hath wytte count the nombre of the Beast for it is the Nombre of manne.
And his Nombre is sixe hondred sixtie and sixe. For so moche as Christ hath willed vs diligentlye to searche the scripturs and the holye Ghost here doth committ the iudgement of this secrete to the witte of manne some wryters hath deducted thys Nomber out of serten Greke wordes betokeninge thys great Antichrist because thys present Reuelacion was first written in the Greke langua+ge.
As out of antemos which signify+eth one contrarye to Gods honoure out of Arnume which signifieth a denyer of God and out of Teitan which betokeneth the sunne.
All these .iii. though they seme dyuerse yet contayne they after the Greke rewles neyther more nor lesse than thys sett Nom+ber.
And all this maye stande both with scripture and reason.
For he that ys not with Christ ys agaynst hym callynge that ys good yll and that ys yll good mynystrynge darkenesse for lyght.
Soche lyenge masters as hath brought in sectes of perdicyon hath denyed the lor+de that bought them.
They are not the lyght as they boast themselues to be (for all they loke to be called spyrituall) but they are the fallen Starres and verye Apostaraes fro~ God Satha~s tra~sfone+mynge themselues into the angels of lyght by dyuerse kyndes of Hypocresye.
Some expositours leauynge the Gre+ke hath practysed the same thynge by these .ii. latyne wordes.
Which sygnifyed that they call them selues the lyght or menne of a spy+rytuall sort beynge nothynge lesse.
For they in dede are the same self darkenes+se that wyl in no wyse receyue the light but rather persecuteth yt with most and cruelte.
After thys sort myght brynge in Diabolus incarnatus or filius perdictonis the deuyll incarnate or the sonne of perdycyo~ for both they are the names of this beastlye Antichrist by the scripturs the one wantynge in the numerall letters but .iiii. of the No~bre the other but .vi. which myght be supplyed in the other letters.
But a monge all these thys worde Arnume most nygh+lye towcheth the which ys as moche to saye as denye.
Euydentlye se+meth he to haue the marke of the Beast or to be sealed with the Nombre of hys name that sayeth whan he heareth the manyfest veryte wyll neuer admitt ye whyle haue a daye to liue it is ageynst good order yt standeth not with laudable custome our doctours agree not th vnto our holye cano~s alloweth yt not yt hath not the holye fathers consent pages missing] vs a~d hope for it hath great likely+hode of a moche farder apperaunce.
Sens the worldes begynnynge haue the misterye of iniquite wrought in and in hys posteryte and so contynu+ed in the Beastlye me~bers of Antichrist and so shall do styll to the latter daye.
Therfor is yt no lesse than the Nombre of manne sixe hondred sixtye and sixe.
Thus ys he tokened with all wyckednes+se that admitteth the false faythe of this Beast and foloweth the same in hys lyuynge by the subtle perswasyons of the Bishoppes and their lyenge Prophetes and ys sealed vp to eternall dampnacy+on vnlesse the lorde call hym in tyme.
Not onlye in Englande ys healed the beastes wounded head but also in other serten regyons.
But for so moche as yt ys most lyuelye done there and thys bo+ke written in that language haue on+lye brought forth here examples therof in that purpose.
IN thys present chapter declareth the lorde vnto Iohan and vnto hys faythfull seruauntes by him the degre estate and condycyon of hys true beleuynge churche now after he hath afore lyuelye descri+bed the bestyall churche of Antichrist and of hys horned spyritualte by the afore named .ii. mo~struouse Beastes.
And thys ys that hys louers shuld knowe what they be which are of hys howshol+de a~d what an helper they haue of hym in the middes of their aduersitees to the confort of their sowles.
And though they be here a monge those ragynge tyrauntes in terryble agonyes and peynes persecucions and trobles he ys neuer absent from them nor wyll not be tyll he hath rewarded them with vnspekeable Ioyes.
And loked and lo a lambe stode in the mounte Syon. a~d with him an .C. and .xliiij. thou+sande.
beynge the first frutes vnto God and to the lambe
for they are without spotte before the trone of God.
(saith saynt Iohan) on the other syde and in a thought as it were behelde that a lambe stode vpon moun+te Syon.
Euen the lambe of God Iesus Christ that alone toke awaye the synnes of the worlde.
Alone doth he gouerne his faythfull churche as the onlye a~d immediate head therof hauynge non other to assist him in that office.
For who is the kynge ouer Syon but he? Who shall reduce Israel agayne to his folde but he? Onlye is he with his congregacyon to ayde them with his worde to bolden them with his sprete to them with his grace.
And with him were present an hondreth and .xliiij. thousande hauynge his fathers name written in their fore heades.
So manye as haue in hart receyued his worde and in faythe digested his are the verye chyldren of Abraham and are marked vpp for the sonnes of God by the seale of the holye Ghost.
For power haue they geue~ the~ to be Gods chyldre~ that beleue in hys name.
And thys is yt to haue hys name written in their fore heades.
Lete thys set Nombre be non impediment to the reader to be taken here for the vnyuersall multitude of the faythfull as well of the Gentiles as of the Iewes that beleueth though yt otherwyse apereth in the .viii. chapter of thys boke.
For so well ys the Gentile that hath faythe a perfyght Israelyte, as ys the Christen Iewe.
Zacheus for hys faythe iudged Abrahams chylde than was Symon for ful+fyllynge the workes of the lawe.
What so euer he be that feareth hym and worketh ryghtousnesse ys accepted with hym.
And therfor ys not the differe~ce written here as in the other place but all ys Ioyned in one to co~prehe~de all vnder one.
And as touchyn+ge the equall certente in Nombre both here and there.
Lyke as yt ys certeynlye knowne vnto God euen so ys yt here though yt be vnto vs both innumerable and vncertayne.
Not as concernynge the Nombre yt self but the common vnderstandinge therof in the scripturs.
For yf the Nombre of one seuenth be an infinite Nombre there moche more of many seuenthes.
And harde a voyce from heauen (sayth Saynt Iohan) which ys all one with the aforeseyd Syon and ys the vnyuersall congregacyon of Christ all clere from the superstycyons af menne.
For from Syon cometh the lawe of the lorde after Esaye and the worde of God from Ierusalem.
Thys worde ys as the noyse of manye waters whan yt ys in the mouthes of manye dyuerse peples of dyuerse natyons and languages one not vnderstan+dynge an other and yet knowynge yt yche peple amonge themselues.
Verye lyke ys yt also to a great tho~+der cracke myghtye feare full and terri+ble to the fleshe.
Very harde ys thy wor+de lorde (sayd Christes disciples) who is able to abyde yt. And the voyce that harde (saith Ioha~) was moche after the noyse that the har+pers make whan they playe vpon their harpes.
Full of agrement are the holye scripturs yea full of swete hermonye and concorde.
More precyouse are the verytes of the lorde than ys golde and their melodye more swete than honye.
With them reioysed Dauid before the arke of the lorde.
In the~ toke Paule a stomake and confounded the Iewes at
And swetelye they vttred with their voyces a songe that semed all newe before the seate of the lorde before the .iiii.
This songe is the worde of the lorde all newe both to the good a~d to the yll.
The faythfull it reneweth in the sprete of the+ir myndes prouokynge them to do on a newe ma~ne in Christ.
The hartes of the vnfaythfull it so hardeneth that they in disdayne and spyght doth call it newe lernynge as ded the ignoraunt multitude at Capernaum and the worldly wy+se menne of Athenes.
Before the seate of the lorde was this songe vttred which is the godlye disposed multitude.
For lyke as the harte of an hipocrite is the verye seate of sa+than so is the hart of a faythfull manne the seate of God and habitacle of the ho+lye Ghost.
Beastes was it opened also by this nomber of godlye teachers.
Which Beastes are the pryuate congregacions of the lorde remayninge here yet in the fleshe in the .iiii. quarters of the worlde.
For non other doctrine is it nor Gospell of glad tydinges than hath bene sens the begynnynge nor tha~ hath bene thankefullye receyued of owr olde auncetours the Patriarkes the Prophe+tes the Apostles and the faythfull fathers.
And no manne coulde lerne that newe songe but the aforesayd hondred a~d xliiii. thousande which were redemed from the earthe.
On mightye wonderfull yea and terrible sentence of the lorde.
Non that take them selues for the pe+ple of God ca~ be accepted afore him for the true sede of Abraha~ nor for the iust ministers of his worde vnlesse they be+tokened afore with the holye sprete of his promes and so predestinate to the ly+fe euerlastinge.
Non can syncerelye do that godlye office to the profight of other vnlesse he be whollye taken from all fleshlye and worldlye affectes.
No manne canne come vnto me (sayth Christ) vnlesse it be ge+uen him of my father.
The wilfull Iewes beleued not because they were not the shepe of his mar+ke.
Neyther is it of him that willeth of him that ronneth but of the only mar+tyr of the lorde.
Necessarye is it therfor that his sprete draweth moueth and the hart.
Els can not the songe be swete neyther in hym that singeth nor yet in the hearer.
The notes of thys newe songe are Gods heauenlye verytees regestred in the faythfull hartes.
And they that ded synge them to the prayse of the lorde were not defyled with women.
Wyth no straunge doctry+nes nor yet Prophane worshyppynges ys their faythe contamynate that vnfay+nedlye haue done on Iesus Christ.
the spowsage of their sowles haue they broken by no fylthye tradicyons of me~+ne.
Onlye haue they with Dauid sought the Testymonyes of God and thought non lyke vnto them.
Onlye ded they cle+aue to hys precyouse lawes estemynge all other but chaffe and verye whoredome in the sprete.
Therfor are they virgins marryed vnto Christ in faythe as were the Corynthyanes by Paules preachynge whom he wyshed to continewe a chast virgine vnto Christ.
Neuer ys the maydenhede of the sowle lost tyll erronyou+se doctrine be receyued from the massen+gers of Antichrist the Byshoppes and Hipocrites.
The virgins or vncorrupted beleuers doth folowe the lambe whersoeuer he beco~meth.
They go after Christ that beleuynge hys worde doth fashion their lyues vnto yt. Lyke as they folowe Anti+christ that fashion their workes to hys doctrine.
They walk in hys steppes that forsake themselues with him that bea+reth the crosse of persecucyo~s with him or that suffreth death for the truthe with hym.
And not they that seke the~selues ly+uynge here in all pompe voluptuousnes+se and Tyrannye.
From thys place fatche the blinde Papistes a great argument for their wyuelesse chastyte and that no~ foloweth Christ but they in this muster because they are vnmarryed.
Neyther maye Abraham Moyses nor Dauid Zacharye Peter nor Philip wal+ke in this No~bre because they had wyues.
So parelouse a thynge yt ys to haue a wyfe.
It ys great maruele they Marye Christes mother to yt becau+se she had a husbande.
thyn+ke yow folowe Iudas which had neyther wyfe nor chylde vnlesse he had the~ syttynge by other mennes fyers as manye of yow haue yet at thys same da+ye.
What is virginite before God more than is marriage? No more than is cir+cumcysyon in comparyson to vncircu~cy+syon.
No more maketh the one than the other to a Chri+ste~ lyfe.
Onlye ys yt faythe effectuallye workynge by loue that the lorde requyreth of vs. Onlye respected he the faythe of Marye and not her virginite.
They which lyue in matrimonye after the worde of God are accepted afore him for virgyns and so are named of Saynt Paule.
An other they haue that non which hath offended afore can be of this nom+bre.
But they consyder not what is spoken here afore that they were redemed from the earthe and that the sprete of the lorde hath puryfyed their hartes through faythe.
Neyther haue they grace to remember that Christes innoce~cye is rekened for an whole perfight righ+tousnesse vnto them that beleue in him but they must bringe in soche tryfles as are their owne beggerlye merytes.
These faithfull beleuers (sayth Saynt Iohan) were redemed from menne beynge the fyrst frutes to God and to the lambe.
By non other were they redemed than by ChristÂ· For of all the elect nombre he is the onlye rightousnesse wysdome holynesse and redempcio~.
From the corrupt blynde and frowarde multitude hath he called them taken them a~d clered them.
And of deformed synners hath he made them fayre of vyle pure of wreched glo+ryouse of blinde perfyghtlye seynge of lyars true sayers of obstinate gentyll of yll good of vnfrutefull profytable.
For he yt is that taketh awaye the stonye harte and geueth a softe harte for yt so makynge vs Abrahams children.
Thus are we redemed from menne we are taken by hys goodnesse from so+che corrupt vsages as mannes nature is inclined vnto. And for non other purpose but to be the first frutes vnto god as were the aul+ter offeringes in the olde lawe in the ha~+des of the high prestes.
For so moche as the elect Nombre are but a fewe or a ser+ten taken out from the vnyuersall mul+tytude are the porcyon of the lorde (as were the seyd offerynges) perteyninge vnto Christ the onlye byshop of our sow+les they are his first frutes.
Yea a~d hys owne verye mysticall members and all but one offerynge vnto God the father by hym.
For he is the onlye lambe that dyed for them hys owne bodye beynge the onlye oblacyon and sacrifice.
For non other wordes vttered they but hys pure testymonyes.
Non other perswaded they to be obserued of other but hys immaculate Gospell or easye burden of Christ.
No impor+table yokes layed they vpon mennes shulders neyther of Ceremonyes fastin+ges nor masse
For they are without spotte before the trone of God.
Both before them that are faythfull and haue right iudgement in the (which are the verye seates of God) apereth their doctrine pure and also their lyfe innocent before God him self.
Neyther are they spotted with fylthye tradicions nor yet with vncomlye examples.
And as concernynge their for+mer synnes they shall not be imputed vnto them.
They are remitted in Christ and so forgotten afore God.
Though this that here hath bene spoken be concernynge the whole Christen multytude and her preachers yet doth it most speci+ally touche the Iewes or Israelytes that shall in this latter age be conuerted vn+to Christ.
Not defyled are they wyth vnmarryed we+men which are the whoryshe lawes a~d vncleane Supersticions of the Gentyles vpon non other harpe haue they com+monlye harped but vpon the scripturs though it hath not bene to the pleasure of God tyll now in thys latter age wherin they shall whollye turne vnto Christ.
hauynge an euerlastynge gos+pell to preache vnto them that sytte and dwell on the earthe.
An other Angell sawe (sayth Saynt Iohan) flye in the myddes of heauen.
For Chryst was the first Angell or massenger of the euerlastynge couenaunt of the father.
This Angell here mencyoned is non other than he that had the seale of the lyuynge God in the vii.
Chapter and he that was clothed wyth a clowde in the tenth chapter.
And he betokeneth those feruent mynysters God hach sent in this latter tyme to admonishe his peple to fle from the errours of Antichrist and returne to his heauenlye veritees.
An ernest feruent and faythfull course take they in the middes of Gods congre+gacion (which is his heauenlye kyngedo+me here to who~ this reuelacion is writ+ten lyke as ded Paulus Sylas Barnabas Timotheus Titus and Cleme~s with other of the Apostles syncerelye to declare his worde.
Mightye stomaked are they in Gods cause both in their wordes and wrytinges.
An euerlastinge gospell had this angell to preache vnto them that sytte and dwell vpon the earthe to all nacions kynredes and peple.
His eternall testament and couenaunt of peace hath the lorde geuen vnto them to preache delyueraunce to the captiue helthe to the wo+unded lyfe to the dead and remission to the sinnefull.
Yea to vtter that worde that is stronger than is heauen or earthe and that shall neuer fayle him that trulye beleueth.
The sounde of this gospell must go the worlde ouer as in the Apostles tyme.
Euery where must it be spredde to the increase of faythe.
Amonge all nacions of the earthe amonge all kynredes of the Israelytes amonge all la~guages of the worlde a~d amonge all kyndes of peple of what sort so euer they be whether they sytte vpon the earthe or dwell vpon the earthe whether they be hygh or lowe gouernours or subiectes masters or seruauntes owners or fermers.
So that they sytt not nor dwell not within the earthe or haue their felicyte here.
For that is holye shuld not be geuen vnto dogges nor yet pearles layed before swyne.
With a mightye feruent sprete do they beate it into the heades of menne both by wordes writinges and all they can make to haue the feare of God and to geue him his dewe honoure.
And this is the doctrine they teache and the counsell they geue. Feare ye God in all that ye do for the first poynt of godlye wysdome is to dre+ade least we offende him.
Be constaunt in the worde a~d feare no displeasure of menne.
For nomore can they do in their anger but slee the bodye and brynge it to the rest of God.
Feare him onlye therfor that whan he hath destroyed both maye throwe them into helle.
Geue honour vnto him worship him and serue him alone.
But yet after non other sort tha~ he hath appoynted which is in faythe sprete and veryte and not in outwarde shaddowes with obseruacyon of tymes.
He trulye honoureth him that trusteth in hym that beleueth hys worde and that in spyght of all Antychristes confesseth it afore all menne.
Af+ter this sort therfor feare him and worshyp him nothynge doubtynge the assaultes of enemyes.
At hande is it that all the Antychristes and hipocrites shall by the invincyble worde of God be iudged condempned and destroyed.
From heauen shall his wrathe be declared vpo~ all their vngodlynesse.
With the sprete of his mouthe shall the lorde consume the~ and not longe after wyll the great daye of his indignacion towardes them lyght sodenlye vpon them.
With all faythfull obsequy worship him therfor that create heaue~ and earth in wonderfull strengthe and bewtye.
That made the see and the fountaynes of water with all that in them doth moue whose power is eternall knowlege non other God but hym.
For all other Chrystes not sent of him are but Antychrystes.
Onlye bowe your knees vnto him for onlye is hys strength euerlastynge.
She is fallen she is fallen euen Babylo~ that great cyte.
for she made all na+cions drynke of the wyne of her whoredome.
And there folowed an other angell (sayth Saynt Iohan) which betokeneth an other sort of preachers whose offyce is here appoynted the~ of the holye ghost to declare vnto the peple the certente of the fall of the aduowterouse cursed a~d malygnaunt churche of hipocrites here fygured by wreched Babilo~.
For though all the true prophetes and preachers ha+ue but one worde of God in their mouthe yet passeth it diuerslye from them.
Vnto yche of them is geue~ a dyuerse vtteraunce of the sprete to edifye.
One is softe meke and gentyll as was Dauid Iohan a~d Peter an other is boystuouse harde a~d vehement as was Helias Esaye and Paule.
This diuersyte of teachers was neuermore plentuouse in the worlde than now in owr tyme figured here by these two angels.
And the tenoure or grounde of this latter sort of preachers is this.
She is fallen she is fallen euen myserable Ba+bylon th great cyte of whordome because she made all nacyons to drynke of the wrathefull wyne of her fornycacion.
So sure is it that the execrable churche of Antichrist shall be ouerthrowne and vtterlye destroyed as it were now perfourmed in dede.
Nothing shall be vnro+ted out that the heauenlye father hath not planted.
Sonner shall heauen earthe peryshe than this promes be vnfulfylled.
For with the stinkinge whoryshnesse of her supersticiouse worshippynges ha+ue she poysened all nacions peples vn+der heaue~.
The great gouernours a~d ler+ned lawers of the worlde hath she made in maner of beastlye dronkerdes wytles+se faythlesse a~d gracelesse by their prostibulouse doctrine.
And this shall be de+clared more at large in the .xvij. chapter folowynge where as she is more plentuouslye described.
a~d receyue his marke in his fore head or on his hande.
the same shall drynke of the wyue of the wrathe of God.
The thyrde Angell also (sayth Saynt Iohan) folowed them in the thyrde kynde of preachynge of the same self massage that in the mouthe of .ij. or .iij. faythfull wytnesses all veryte myght stande.
And by this angell are they signifyed that by the worde of God stifflye im+pugne their wicked lawes and vngodly ordynaunces whose maner of ernest pre+achinge is this.
If anye ma~ worship the Beast which is the great Antichrist.
And his Image which are those gouernours that taketh vpon them his blasphemouse titles names auctoryte or defence.
If anye man+ne also receyue his marke in his fore head beleuynge their lawes to be a chrysten doctrine or haue the of hys seale vpon his ryght hande which is to fashion his outwarde workes after the same.
The same manne shall drynke of the wyne of Gods wrathe whych are the dregges of the pure wyne powred in the cuppe of his hygh dyspleasure.
He shall tast of the euerlastynge dampnacyon that is reserued in the latter curse or fearefull sentence of their most terry+ble iudge.
To worshyp the Beast a~d his Image is to accept them in conscyence and in the outwarde obedience with full consent of the hart.
As the Pope for Gods vycar or forgeuer of synnes Mahomete for the great Prophete of the lorde the of the earthe for the popes elder or yonger sonnes for most christen kynges and defenders of the faythe of that holye churche.
To receyue the Beastes marke in their fore heades and handes is both to agre to soche decrees tradycyons lawes constitucyons actes and proclamacyons as they vnder those tytles haue made onlye for their owne couetousnesse and pompe and neyther for the glorye of God nor yet for the right mayntenaunce of the chrysten common wel+the as haue declared afore.
And also to be sworne to the same to subscrybe to it to geue counsell or ayde to it to maynteyne it by lernynge to mynister in it to execute vnder it to accuse po~+nyshe and put to deathe for yt or to thynke yt lawfull and godlye with soche lyke. These marked worshippers shall tast of the cuppe of Gods indygnacyon of calamyte sorowe and wrechednesse in the dayes of their fall here and after the last iudgement of vnspekeable peynes and most greuouse tormentes in euerlastynge fyre prepared for the deuyll a~d his angels.
The dregges that the lorde hath pou+red out (sayth Dauid) shall the wycked of the earthe drynke.
Cleane contrarye are these Angels to the horned mynysters of Antychryst.
For they maynteyne the Popes errours these the onlye verytees of Chryst.
They laboure for the glorye of theyr Pope these seketh the onlye honoure of God.
They that their holye churche shall co~tinewe these saye it shal downe with shame.
They requyre worshyp to the Be+ast and his Image these will report it blasphemouse and the rewarde therof dampnacyon.
Marke in these .ij. sortes the preachers of owr tyme and iudge which are of God.
Agaynst both beastes in Chrystes quarell shall these Angels contende.
Agaynst the Pope and his bis+hoppes Mahomete and his doctours wyll these godlye mynisters replye (who~ the lorde hath sent in thys latter age for that purpose) conde~pnynge by the scripturs their auctoryte iurisdiccion and power declarynge also the plages that wyll fall vpon them for wytholdynge the truthe of God in vnryghtousnesse.
For these Antichristes and their wor+shippers with so manye as beareth their token shall be ponnished in fyre and brymstone before the holye Angels and before the lambe.
Fyre shall be kyndled (sayth Moyses) in the anger of the lorde and shall burne vnto the bottome of hell.
Fyre brymstone storme and tempest shall be ther porcyon to drynke.
The veheme~t indignacion and myghtye iudgement of God shall lyght vpon them as vpon Sodome and Egypt and shall both deuoure them and consume them.
Which are not onlye the spretes of heauen but also the churche of the faythfull.
Yea the ryghtouse shall reioyse whan he yth the destruccion and shall washe his handes in the bloude of the wycked.
In the presens of the lambe shall it be also.
For he is euermore with his floc+ke and shall be vnto the ende of the worlde wherin he shall sytte and them.
a~d who so euer receyueth the prynt of his name.
And the smoke of their torment ascendeth vp euermore as the flame of a fornace wyth most horryble stynke for a perpetuall sygne of their ponnyshment lyke as it ded from Sodome and Gomor wha~ the lorde ouerthrewe the~.
So that they haue no rest neyther day nor nyght so manye as worship the Be+ast and his Image receyuynge the print of his name.
Both in this lyfe are they with a troblouse and doubtfull conscien+ce and also after this lyfe with vnspekeable peynes.
For neyther shall theyr worme dye nor yet their fyre be quenched all fleshe abhorrynge them.
Thus shall they be wyth the Beast tormented which haue the sprete of the beast.
For lyke as all the faithfull (which hath bene from the begynninge) belongeth to one mistycal bodye in Christ a~d shall be preserued by hym so doth the wicked perteyne to one mystycall Antichryst hauynge all one sprete with him and so shall with him perishe.
No pleasure is for the~ in this worlde but hate rebukes slaunders lyes persecucio~s deathe of their bodyes.
Their lyfe vpon earthe is co~tinual affliccio~ but gloryou+se is the frute of their labours.
Manyfol+de are the mysfortunes of the rightouse but the lorde cleareth them of all.
Here are they vexed that kepe the com+maundeme~tes the faythe of Iesu.
Here are they had in derisio~ that behaue the~ selues as the ministers of God in moche pacience affliccions nede anguyshe laboure strypes impriso~me~t soche lyke. Here are they chastened of the lorde with many sore stormes that they shuld not be dampned with this worlde.
Moche haue they here to suffre of enemyes that onlye cleaueth to the worde of God in lyfe and doctrine.
Bles+sed are the dead which hereafter dye in the lorde.
(eue~ so sa+yth the sprete) that they maye rest fro~ their labours.
And harde a voyce from heaue~ (sayth Saynt Iohan) saynge vnto me.
Wryte with thy penne or marke surelye this sente~ce folowinge for the~ that here suffreth in the truthes quarell.
Blessed are the dead or they which are alredye departed and that also shall here after depart in the lorde.
This voy+ce from heauen are the infallyble scripturs assertanynge the faythe of Iohan of the swete rest of the Sayntes in the handes of God.
And that their ende is not without honoure as the vayne sort supposeth but they are counted amonge the dere chyldren of God.
Let them ther+for that suffer in this age be ernestlye spreted and not feare the tormentes of the enemyes in Christes cause.
For from hence forthe (the sprete sayth) that they rest from their labours.
In a wonderfull quyetnesse dwell they by the verye sentence of the holye ghost and shall neuer more fele of anye woo.
God hath cleane wyped awaye all teares from their eyes all a~d pey+nes from their bodyes the first daungers beynge past.
Happye are they therfor and most godlye fortunate that are slayne for Christ because they wyll not worshyp the Beast and his Image nor corrupt their faythe with their wycked lawes but in a pure Christen beleue departeth from hence to the lorde.
Theyr porcyon is in the lande of the lyuynge and their lotte amonge the holye ones.
The warde of God for constantlye standynge by the ve+ryte for the frutes of their christen pacience and for other exercyses of theyr faythe is euermore to their glorye present with them.
Not as deserued of the~ but of Christ in whose faythe they wrou+ght here and for the promes sake that they shuld be Gods heyres togyther wyth Chryst.
The lyuelye worde also which they ernestlye receyued here and so roted in their faythe wyll neuer suf+fre them to peryshe nor to be hurt of the deathe.
and vpon the cloude one sittynge lyke vnto the sonne of manne.
loked yet further (sayth Saynt Iohan) and euydentlye before me apered a whyght cloude which betokeneth the true mynisters of Gods worde.
Whom the holye ghost calleth cloudes by Esaye Dauid Peter and Iudas.
For from the~ falleth vpon the peple the swete droppes of hys verytees.
Whyght they are as mylke for their faythe in the worde.
And for their Christen conuersacyon not blotted with Hypocresye of mennes corrupted customes.
Vpon this cloude was one syttynge lyke vnto the sonne of manne which ys verelye Christ in hys gloryfyed manho+de.
For euermore ys he amonge hys tre+we preachers geuynge them soche vtteraunce and wisdome as all their enemy+es are not able to withstande.
Alwayes walketh he amonge the .vij. candelstyckes which are hys congregacyons as we had afore He had vpo~ hys head a golde~ crow+ne in token of hys eternall and vncorrupt kyngedome in hys hande a sharpe syckle which ys the sharpe iudgeme~t or ryghtuousnesse of hys worde for ther with shall he reape hys latter harnest.
Accordynge to hys worde and promes shall he iudge good and euyll.
Thys syckle receyued he of hys euer+lastynge father soche tyme as he gaue ouer vnto hym hys vnyuersall iudgeme~+tes.
By the order of thys vysyon shuld the preachers seme in the last age of the churche moche to admonyshe the peple of the latter daye with the commynge of Christ agayne to iudge both the quic+ke the dead as ys in their crede or bele+ue.
crya~ge with a lowde voyce to hym that satte on the cloude.
thrust in hys syckle on the earth and the earthe was reaped.
And an other Angell (sayth saynt Iohan) came out of the temple which ys the congregacyon of faythe consecrated as an holye temple vnto God in the blou+de of the vndefyled lambe Iesus.
This Angell betokeneth those iust me~ne that with Symeon and anna the doughter of Phanuell in this latter age are of the glorye of God and of the fy+nall redempcyon of man from bodelye corrupcyon.
These shall crye with a loude voyce with a feruent sprete shall they call vnto Christ which sitteth vpon the cloude.
And lyke as yt hath crea+ted all thynges so lete yt now trye and iudge all thinges.
For we are those vpon whome the endes of the worlde are come.
And doubtlesse the corne of the earthe rype the worlde is at the best that yt will do.
As it hath bene euer so ys yt styll all togyther sort vpon myscheff.
Lete thy worde therfor fynyshe all as yt hath beganne all.
With the breathe of thy mouthe the great Antichrist of synne the sonne of perdycyon and the aduersarye that hath exal+ted hymself aboue God.
Poure out thy indygnacion vpon the kyngedomes that will neyther knowe the worshyp the nor alone call vpon thy name.
Thu hast called thy haruest the ende of the worlde lete it now fynyshe all in dede.
Diuyde the chaffe from the corne the wicked sort from the ryghtouse.
Gather the whe+ate into thy garner and burne the chaf+fe in vnquencheable fyre. And he that satte on the cloude thurst in hys syckle on the earthe and anon the earthe was reaped.
He hath sent hys myghtye worde so quycke in operacyon as fyre.
Which shall not onlye consume the wicked generacyon of the Beast but also reserue them to eternall dampnacyon.
The earthe shall be cleared of the~ as of all other fylthye corrupcions and hell replenyshed with them to their perpetuall care.
And an other angell (sayth saynt Iohan) came out of the temple which ys in heauen or from the great nombre of An+gels hauynge also a sharpe syckle in his hande.
This Angell betokeneth those heaue~+lye spretes that the lorde shall se~de forth to gather togyther hys chosen from the iiij. wyndes whan hys token shall ape+re in heaue~ These are the reapers of the lordes haruest.
These are they that shall go forthe to gather all nacyons and to separate the gottes fro~ the la~bes the yl from the good and shall cast them into a furnace of fyre where as shallbe way+linge and gnashinge of tethe.
But these massengers shall not forthe tyll they haue commandement.
and cryed with a lowde crye vnto hym that had the sharpe syckle and sayde.
And the a~gell thrust in hys syckle on the earthe.
a~d cutte downe the grapes of the vyneyarde of the earthe.
and cast them into the great wynefatte of the wrathe of God.
by the space of a thousande and sixe hundred fourlonges.
And an other Angell came out from the aulter which had power ouer fyre.
This ys the lorde Iesus Christ whom Malachias calleth the Angell of the couenaunt that was longed for.
He ys the aulter of the ryghtouse and by hym are they a swete sacrifice vnto God.
Tyll the iudgement daye shall he be an aulter of meanes makynge to God the father for vs.
But that daye ones come no longer shall he be an aulter or an ad+uocate but go cleane from yt.
He shall than become a iudge ouer all the worlde rewardynge euerye one accordynge to their workes.
Hitherto hath he mekeli+sytten vppon the cloude and not cutte with his syckle.
He hath had in hys han+de the iudgement and not iudged.
By fyre (which ys vnder hys obedyence as are all other creaturs els) shall he at that daye iudge the vnyuersall worlde.
And more sharpe vehement quycke ferce myghtye and terryble shall hys se~+tence be to the wycked tha~ ys any feare+full flaminge or co~sumynge wilde fyre. For with a lowde voyce shall he crye vnto him that hath the sharpe syckle.
An ernest charge and commandement shall he geue at that daye to the ministers of his yre for to cast them into exteryoure darkenesse after thys sort here vttred in mysterye.
Thrust in thy sharpe syckle a~d gather the clusters of the earthlye vyneyarde for the grapes therof are Execute the vengeaunce committed vnto yow and rote out this ranke generacyon of the rauenouse Epicures.
Now are they most curyous in their facyons and fedynges most couetouse in their compassynges most vayne in their stodyes and most cruell in their do+ynges.
For with them shall yt be (sayth Christ) as yt was in the dayes of Noe and Loth.
They shall buylde and banket ruffle and ryot bye and sell and plante for their pleasurs.
And sodenlye as a snare shall that terri+ble daye lyght vpon them vnbewares as ded deathe on the couetouse iourer.
And the Angell (sayth Iohan) thrust in hys syckle on the earthe he cutte downe the grapes of the vineyard of the earth and so ded cast them into the greate wy+ne fatt of the wrathe of God.
Accordynge to their commission they shall plage the earthlye mynded for here ys the tyme past for the tyme co~myn+ge vsed for the certente of yt. Wyth soden deathe shall they perce the~ in this worlde that contempnynge Christes doc+tryne hath folowed the course therof in all concupiscence.
And fynallye they shall throwe them into the lake of myserye the pyt wyth+out water the stynkynge of where as fyre and brymstone shall be rewarded to drynke.
For the vyneyarde of the earthe ys the carnall Sy+nagoge of Hypocrites and the grapes therof are the gloryouse glottons and franke porkelynges of that gredye gulfe euen the enemyes of Christes crosse whose God ys their bellye who+se glorye is their confusion and whose ende ys their dampnacyon for they are earthlye mynded.
This wyne fatte of the wrathe of God ys non other than hys greate bengeaunce to be poured vpon the vnfaythfull.
Or els helle prepa+red for the deuyll and hys angels.
Gre+ate not onlye for the innumerable multytude that yt hath and shall receyue but also in that yt is insacyable.
Nothynge perteyneth yt to that cyte (of whom famouse thynges are spoken) which ys the congregacyon of God nor yet to the good creaturs of God.
No not vnto thys worl+de which shall at that daye be tryed and pourged by fyre.
But vnder the earthe shall yt be and farre without thys worlde secluded from the face of heauen in fylthye and vnspekeable darkenesse.
For bloud wyll come out of thys fatte eue~ vnto the horse brydles.
Wher+in is expressed not onlye the terrour of the place but also of the peynes ther in contayned.
For bloud shedynge and murther are thynges verye horrible fearefull to beholde contayninge in the~ depriuacyon of lyfe which ys most terrible of all.
The habundaunce therof betokeneth the greatnesse of the grefe in the sufferaunce of them.
The treadin+ge downe also sygnyfieth that no ray+se towardes anye relefe is to be loked for of them that be there.
Vnto them which at that daye shall be in the cyte wyl he that sytteth in the trone make al thynges newe.
All dolour affliccyon so rowe peyne penurye wrathe conde~pnacyon and deathe shall be past with them.
Onlye shall they be trodden dow+ne in this wynefatt of Gods wrathe that lyued here lyke beastes without re+ason and that wandred here lyke horses and mules in their owne filthye lus+tes.
All shall be ponnyshed there that was here vnbridled vnordred and vngouerned after the worde pleasure of God.
And therfor yt ys here sayd vnto the horse brydles.
Euerye manne shall receyue in bodye accordynge to that he hath done whether yt be Good or euyll.
They that haue wrought the storke of God in faythe shall reape accordynge vnto yt.
The brydles also be+tokeneth the measure of gods iudgeme~t not as concernynge the tyme which euerlastynge but concernynge the peyne ryghtlye measured accordynge to the in aquite.
For the lorde hath sett his iudge+mentes ouer the wicked in wayght and measure the stripes agreynge in quanty+te to the excesse of synne so moche torment to haue as their reioyse hath bene in wyckednesse.
The space of these terrible torme~tes or ponnyshme~tes of hell ys a thousande and .vi. hondred furlonges.
furlonge of the Grekes ys called the of her+cules and yt ys in lenghte an hondred and .xxv. passes or steppes.
And common+lye they vsed accordinge to that lenghte to measure their playenge places.
Of whome Paule maketh mencyon to the Corinthyanes beynge Grekes by them that ro~neth in a course and that proueth mastryes.
In thys thousande and .vi. ho~+dred furlonges here ys comprehended the whole and vnyuersall course of the wycked for the .iiii. quarters of the worl+de.
The nombre of an hondred ys euermore an whole complete and perfyght nombre.
And .iiii. hondred .iiii. tymes no~+bred ys .xvi. hondred which maketh this nombre of a thousande and .vi. hondred the nombre of .iiii. respectinge alwayes the .iiii. climates of the worlde which are the common habitacions of sinners.
In them course they in all wanton kyndes of lyuinge.
In them worke they their mastryes of all vngodlye obseruacyons and false worshyppinges walkinge in the large or open waye which leadeth vnto deathe.
Accordynge to the non+bre measure of this course hath God here measured the place and ponnyshment.
Maruelouse he ys in hys workes and iudgementes which are vnsercheable.
Blessed ys he that shal haue his part in the cyte or congregacyon of the ryghtouse and that shall se the peace vpon Israell whan the lorde shall leade forth them with the euyll doers that hath yoked themselues with their lawes.
The lorde graunt vs ones to tast the prosperyte of Hierusalem.
NOt onlye for the common syn+nes of the worlde doth the lor+de plage but most of all for vnthankefulnesse of all blaphemyes the greatest For spurneth agaynst knowlege and dyrectlye worketh agaynst the holye Ghost.
double destruccyon or decaye both of sowle and bodye by the ryghtousnesse of God must nedes folowe the wylful contempte of hys veryte manifestlye she+wed and openlye taught.
Yet ys the lor+de so mercyfull that he willeth not the dampnacion of a synner.
Soche compassion hath he ouer oure manyfolde we+akenesse that he premonysheth vs of his most terrible plages to call vs bac+ke by feare yf loue will not do yt.
As here consequentlye in the first vysyon of this present reuelacyon to Iohan which foloweth after this sort in thys xv. and .xvi. chapters.
and them that had gotten victorye of the Beast and of hys Image.
and of his marke and of the nombre of his name.
And they sange the songe of Moyses the seruau~t of God.
And sawe (sayth saynt Iohan) by the secrete goodnesse of my lorde God yet an other token in heauen great and maruelouse straunge and wonderfull.
For in the churche or congregacyon of God are euermore vttred his wonderfull and depe iudgementes vnto them only whom his grace appoynteth as vn+to Iohan.
Seuen angels had in their ha~des the seuen last plages.
Some exposytours haue taken these Angels for the ryght mynisters in the .vij. ages of the christen churche.
Some haue thought them to be the peruerse preachers and vngodly my+nisters of all the sayd ages suffred of God strongelye to delude the vnbeleuers that he which hurteth shuld hurte styll and that he which is in fylthynesse shuld styll be fylthye.
Vnto euerye age correspondynge an Angell to declare the nature of those deceytfull hyrelynges and lyenge masters.
Amonge the congregacyons of God are the false prophetes and dissemblynge hypocrites euermore as the chaf+fe amonge the corne the tares amonge the wheate and the fylthye dregges amonge the pure wyne.
For that kyngedome is as a nette throwne into the see and gatherynge all maner of fyshes both good and badde.
In all ages hath the wycked generacyon increased to im+pugne the truthe and styflye to stande vp agaynst God and his Christ whych is non other after their myndes than to mynistre the .vij. last plages here.
For no poyson is to the sowle so pestylent nor yet venime so noyfull as is false
No plage can be thought more deadlye nor vyrulent than to depryue vs of that faythe of that veryte a~d of that lyfe which is in Christ Iesu or to brynge vs out of that waye which he hath ap+poynted.
And all this semeth no small ly+kelyhode of the iust vnderstandynge of the texte here.
Yet geueth Frances a farre better iudgement callynge them the set sentences or vnvariable decrees of God diffinynge hys iudgemen+tes agaynst the wycked in this latter a+ge of the worlde at their appoynted tymes to be vttered.
The+se Angels came not onlye from heauen which is the congregacyon (as they haue mencyoned) but also out of the celestyall temple of the tabernacle of testimonye which is the omnipote~t God and his Chryst as the .xxi. chapter here of declareth.
They are also clothed with pure whyght lynnen gyrded with golden gyrdels they haue golden vyals de+lyuered vnto them by one of the .iiij.
Be+astes and one of them commonÃ¨th with Iohan declarynge vnto him the iudgement a~d fall of the great whore.
Which are no argumentes that they are here to be taken for yll preachers thowgh they here mynistre the last .vij. plages.
Therfor shall we iudge them here to be Gods appoynted purposes or eternallye decreed pleasurs agaynst the wylfull obstynates and indurate rebellyous to the ende of the worlde.
These are called the last plages bycause they fall in the last age of the worlde whom Esaye Hieremye Oseas and Mycheas calleth the last dayes Iohan the last howre and Paule the endes of the worl+de.
Seuen are they named here in a vni+uersal respect both of the tymes parsones places and peruerse doctrynes of the whole worlde.
And also because of the .vij. seales and the .vij. trompet+tes to whose iudgementes they Ioyntlye agre as in the next chapter folowin+ge wyll apere more largelye.
For in them (sayth the text) is fulfylled the wrathe of God.
The indignacyon of the lorde is in them whollye declared.
For what hate can he shewe more vnto manne than to withdrawe from him his grace to leaue him to him self to suffre him in his owne blynde iudgementes to geue hym ouer to his owne fylthye lustes and to sende hym the ope+racyon of erroure to his double dampnacyon? verye fulfyllynge of Gods anger is it also to appoynt vs a false Prophete or deceyuable curate a wanton Prynce or vngodlye gouernoure.
These therfor with soche lyke are those plages in whom is depelye accomplyshed the dyspleasure of God.
And they are here named the last plages for after them shall non other be seane the latter daye fynyshynge and clearynge all.
And behelde (sayth Saynt Iohan) in the same sayd vysyon as it were a glassye see or a great flowynge water in symylytude of glasse all myngled wyth fyre.
Non other is this see but the precyouse veryte of the Lorde so clere as glasse and so pure as christall.
This see gushed out of the harde roc+ke stone that was clouen a sonder in the desart.
Whan he sent forth his sprete these waters forth in habundaunce.
And therfor it is here noted as myngled with fyre whych signifyeth the holye ghost.
All fyerye is thy worde lorde (sayth Dauid also) and therfor thy seruaunt loueth it.
This is the fou~tayne of lyuynge water spryn+gynge vp into the lyfe euerlastynge.
Vn+to this water shuld all they resort that are thurstye therof to take refreshynge.
Vpon this glassye see were they sene of Saynt Iohan that had obtayned victorye of the Beast of hys Image of his marke and of the nombre of his name.
By whom are ment those constaunt christianes whych hath for all ages firmelye affermed the truthe.
Stronge+lye haue these sens the Apostles tyme resysted the aduersaries of God by his only worde perfystynge therin vnto the deathe as ded Steuen Iames and Antipas with soche other his faythfull wit+nesses.
Uictorye haue they gotten by faythe both of the Beast a~d his Image both of the great Antychryst and his supporters of the Pope and of Mahomete wyth theyr maynteyners Emprours kynges and magistrates and of all them that vsurpe theyr tytle name seate auctoryte pompe or power.
They haue blemyshed lykewyse by the sayd worde not onlye the marke of the Beast whych is a corrupted faythe but also the nombre of hys name whych is the denyall of God.
Them haue they to theyr rebuke vttered and to their confusion declared.
They haue pro+ued their orders dampnable their doctrine deuyllyshe their religion hypocri+sye and their spiritualte playne wyckednesse condempnynge them by the scripturs as vngodlye dyssemblers de+nyenge the lorde which bought them.
These are they whom the lorde tenderlye norryshed and gracyouslye brought forth vpon the refreshynge waters con+uertynge their sowles to his godlye fea+re and loue. These stande euermore on the glassye see they sett sure fotynge vpon the rocke stone.
Unmoueablye they per+seuer in the truthe neuer denyenge yt afore menne.
And they haue in their handes the harpes of God whych are deuoure myndes geuen all vnto godlynesse a~d reioysynge in spirituall thynges.
Harmonyouslye they synge the tuneable songe of Moyses the faythfull seruaunt of God and the melodyouse swete songe of the lambe Iesus Christ.
Of both testamentes they make vt+teraunce declarynge the wonderfull workes and terrible iudgementes out of the olde lawe and out of the gospell of gladnesse the most swete mercye of the lorde.
Wythout ceasynge open they the scripturs vnto other inwardlye reioysinge in spirituall hymnes and psal+mes hauynge this euermore for the standynge tenoure of their songe.
Inestimablye great is thy goodnesse and wonderfullye maruelouse are thy workes Lorde God almyghtye.
Iust are thy promyses and most per+fightlye sure thy wayes thu gloriouse kynge of Sayntes and graciouse gyde of the godlye beleuers.
Who shall not euermore feare the mightye lorde? who shall not alwayes in hart gloryfye thy blessed name? Thu alone art holye iust a~d perfight for non is there good but thy self onlye.
No doubt of it but the tyme will be that all kyndes of peple both Iewes and Gentyles faythfull and heythen shall seke vnto the and shall faythfullye in veryte and sprete worship before the acknowlegynge the for their onlye lorde God.
Because thy wonderfull iudgemen+tes that sumtyme were secrete are now to the worlde made openlye knowne a~d manifest.
Though this songe be lyttle and small yet is therin contayned all ve+ryte that both Moyses and Christ confesseth at large.
Moreouer what so euer the scripturs comprehendeth eyther of the great omnipote~cye of God or of his most wonderfull workes eyther of hys louinge mercye or of his benigne pytie towardes manne of his gloriouse name or myghtye power or that he is to be magnifyed and feared or how that the faythfull perteyneth only to his kingedome or how that all peple shall finallye be conuerted vnto hym.
All is compendiouslye in this brefe songe here contayned what though it be not so worde by worde expressed.
And as concernynge that ys here last spoken that his iudgementes are made ma+nyfest it is to be vnderstanded of those faythfull creaturs whom he calleth clereth and iustyfyeth and of non other.
For vnto them onlye are his heauenlye knowne to whom he wytsaueth to open them.
Though the other outwardlye se the iudgements of God yet do they not inwardlye perceyue the~ though they boast it neuer so moche.
They must haue eyes and not se eares and not vnderstande.
And one of the foure Beastes gaue vnto the seue~ Angels.
full of the wrathe of God whych lyueth for euer+more.
And no man was able to en+tre into the temple.
tyll the seuen plages of the seuen angels were fulfylled.
And a non after that (sayth Iohan) loked yet more aduysedly.
And sodenly as it were the euerlastynge te~ple of the tabernacle of wytnesse was open in heauen.
mysterye this is verye ernestlye to be marked as a thinge of great wayght.
He is the temple not made wyth ha~des vncreated gloriouse and full of ma+geste comprehendynge in him all thinges and he within non agayne compre+hended.
He measureth heauen wyth his spanne he ouer reacheth all the worlde with his .iij. fin+gers.
In hym we lyue we moue and haue owr beynge.
He is that verye tabernacle of God that was here amonge menne bearinge that faythfull wytnesse which geueth wysdome to babes.
He is the propiciatorye or mercye seate wherin we are harde and forgeuen.
Neyther was thys tabernacle of thys maner buyldynge but moche more perfyght and greatter.
This holye tabernacle is within the aforesayd temple for Christ dwelleth in the father and the father in him.
Open is this temple in heauen and the tabernacle seane whan God is kno+wen by true preachynge and Chrystes doctrine beleued.
For he came into the worlde and for that purpose was borne to beare wytnesse vnto the truthe whom the father wylled onlye to be har+de concernynge faythe.
This temple and tabernacle open or God and his worde ones knowne in thys latter age the seuen Angels cometh forth.
The eternall decrees of Gods secrete iudgementes apereth and are fulfylled in their tymes.
As Angels or massengers of God they haue in his eternyte their iust plages in their season appoynted to be exhybited.
And therfor are they seyd to come out from the temple which is God.
Nothynge hath he purposed to the worlde but he hath decreed yt afore the worldes constitucyon.
For his purpose mynde and pleasure is as he is euer+lastynge.
And as it falleth to the worlde by his assignement it becometh a massenger goynge out of the temple.
So manye hath he sent of soche massengers as he hath fulfylled decreed purposes.
And maruele not though they be here called Angels consyderynge that it ys the common maner of the holye scrypturs euermore to call them Angels whych vttereth the wyll pleasure and commaundement of God as they do here.
After thys sort are the prestes called Angels so ys Aggeus the holye Prophete so is Saynt Iohan Baptyst so are Chrystes dyscyples and also the publyque preachers.
What the plages are that they shall shed out of theyr vyals wyll be shewed clerelye in the next chapter folowynge one after an other.
These angels are aparelled in pure whyght lynnen bryght shynynge as chrystall and gyrded about theyr brestes with gyrdels of fyne golde which betokeneth theyr syncere clennesse and their gloryouse perfyghtnesse.
For what can be more pure and precyouse than the eternall decrees of the lorde? What can be more perfyght and gloryouse than hys prediffyned purposes? The lawes of God are vndefyled the testimonyes are true the statutes are ryght the wayes are sure the commaundementes are clere the iudgementes are godlye the wordes are pure and pre+cyouse.
Yea the gyftes that come from the father of lyght are euermore perfyght and good.
The gyrdynge of their brestes ys the streyght spearynge vpp of the secre+te meanynge of Gods iudgementes from owr carnall vnderstandynge tyll soche tyme as he openeth them vnto vs by hys sprete.
For yt belongeth not vnto vs to decerne soche secretes as the father reserueth to hys owne power.
Beastes or con+gregacyons (sayth Saynt Iohan) delyuered vnto the aforesayd .vij.
Angels vij. golden vyals replenished with the wrathfull dyspleasure of God whych lyueth for euermore.
Though the congregacyons be in the fyrst chapter .vij. and in the forth .iiij. vnderstanded by the .iiij.
Beastes yet are they here in place brought all vnto one and called one of the .iiij. or els of the .iiij. ma+de one for so moche as the vnyuersall christen churche is of one consent one faythe one batyme one God and perteyneth to one Christ.
For so moche also as it confesseth beleueth and teacheth one doctrine of helthe.
One is my (sayth the holye ghost) one is my derely beloued darlynge.
Beast is it here noted as lyuinge in the fleshe and not yet mortifyed by deathe.
The vyals of Gods wrathe are the vngodly reprobates fytt onlye for destruccyon.
Golden are they here named because they apere gloryouse in the worldlye iudgementes of menne.
Verye paynted tombes are the dyssemblynge hipocrites within full of stynkinge bones.
shynynge name of lyfe haue they and yet are they inwardlye dead.
For all that they do is to be seane of menne.
Full of wrathe are they wherbye is ment a synnefull vnderstandynge with dampnable doctrynes.
The .vi. pro+pertees haue they which the lorde hateth and the seuenth which he vtterlye abhorreth.
proude loke a dissemblynge tonge bloudye handes a wycked hart fere rydye vnto myschef wayes to practyse lyes and sowynges of dyssencyon amonge bretherne.
These are ge+uen of the true christen congregacion to the .vij.
Angels or decreed purposes of God to be iudged as they haue eternallye diffyned.
For non other is their continuall prayer but that his wyll be fulfylled and that his predyfined intentes agaynst the peruerse multytude be fynyshed at their conuenyent tymes.
Non other is it to putt into the Angels handes the vyals of Gods displeasure than thus to committ them by faythfull prayer to his purposed decrees or fore+set ordinaunces.
But because that commonlye whan Gods iudgementes begynne to waxe knowne all thynges are commoued and trobled therfor is it sayd here consequentlye that the temple was full of smoke by reason of the mageste of God and of his gloryouse power.
This smoke are serten mysteryes representynge vnto vs the hydden mageste of Gods eternall presence.
Nor all the worlde cowde not sustayne it yf all thynges were open and playne concernynge it.
In no wyse coulde Moyses presentlye se the face of God onlye myght he be suffred to se his bac+ke partes.
Onlye is he seane here in this lyfe as in a glasse or vnder a darke speakynge.
He apereth vnto vs here in a mystycall smoke lyke as he ded to the Patriarke Iacob in slepe to Moyses in the flamynge bushe to Helias in the horle wynde to the Apostles in fyerye tonges and vnto Ananias in a secrete vysyon.
Vnder the shaddowe of fygurate lo+cucyon is his glorye of the electe persones and faythfull beleuers knowne.
The vnfaythfull reprobates beholdeth the smoke but neyther perceyue they in it the glorye of God nor the mageste of his presence.
They neyther conceyue his wonderfull workes nor yet his god+lye iudgementes.
Their folyshe hartes are so darkened that though they knowe God yet glorifye they him not.
They set the smoke and perceyue the worlde trobled (as it is alwayes whan the veryte apereth) but neuer the more faythe nor godlye knowlege haue they.
But that which is vnto the faythfull a rayse is vnto the~ a ruyne.
That is vnto the other the power of God vnto helthe is vnto them slaunder and folyshnesse.
And that is vnto the other a sauoure of lyfe vnto lyfe is vnto them a sauoure of deathe vnto deathe.
They remember not that the lorde came downe in fyre vnto Moy+ses vpon mount Synay whan it smoked all togyther lyke a burnynge fornace and therfor bere they awaye no glori+fyed faces or consciences depured by a true perfyght faythe.
And no manne was able (sayth the text) to enter into the te~ple tyll the .vij. deadlye plages of the .vij. angels were whollye fulfylled.
For though the true beleuers perceyue in the misteries of the scripturs the present mageste and mygh tye power of God yet enter they not in to full knowlege of him beynge as yet subiect vnto vanyte.
For here is theyr knowlege vnperfyght and their prophe+cyenge also.
And therfor acknowlegynge their imbecillite and also waytynge for the reuelacion of the childre~ of God they saye with Saynt Paule.
the wo~derfull depenesse of the wysdome and knowlege of God.
How incomprehensi+ble are his iudgementes and how vnsearcheable his wayes.
And at this poynt. shall they styll be tyll the last iudgement daye fynishe all.
For the full enterynge into the temple is non other than a whole perfyght or consummate knowlege of God a~d hys misteryes.
Which can not fullye be had tyll that which is vnperfyght be done awaye the creature delyuered from bondage of corrupcyon.
And tyll deathe be swallowed vp the vessell of corrupcyon becommynge incorruptyble a~d the mor+tall bodye becommynge spyrituall.
The ryghtouse shall than shyne as doth the sunne in the kyngedome of their father and glyster as doth the bryght Starres worlde without ende.
What the .vij. plages are and what ys their fulfyllyn+ge wyll in this chapter folowynge apere.
And the first went and poured out hys vyall vpon the earthe.
and there fell a noysom a sore votche vpon the men which had the marke of the Be+aste.
AN other great voyce harde Ioha~ out of the te~ple.
perfyght stron+ge and ernest assuraunce had he of the lorde by a spirituall premo+nyshment that the vnvariable de+crees of hys sert iudgeme~tes shuld be fulfilled at their tymes of hym appoynted.
Yea assertayned he was infallyblye that they shuld in their dewe seasons co+me to passe.
For vnto his fryndes openeth he hys secrete counsels alwayes as he ded in olde tyme vnto hys wele be+loued Israel vnto Moyses Zacharye E+zechiel and Daniel with soche other.
Angels vnder the .vii. Seales openynge a~d the .vii. trompettes blowinge after this sort.
Go your wayes forth fulfillinge the purpose ye be ordayned vnto.

Consequentlye sende the~ into most depe errour that they maye wexe worse and worse and not onlye to erre in themselues but also to brynge other into errour that they maye receyue the double rewarde therof abydynge my most fearefull iudgement.
And in soche tyme as the lorde appoynted the first Angell went fourth vn+der the first seale openynge and poured out hys vyall vpon the earthe.
For in the first age of the churche to trye her as golde in the fornace permytted the lor+de by his eternall decre the malycyouse Synagoge of the Iewes to rage and to do their vngodlye feates.
In the which their furyouse madnesse not onlye ded they persecute the Apostles and first pre+achers of Christ from cyte to cyte but also peruerted the earthlye mynded mul+tytude by manye and dyuerse vngodlye kyndes of false doctryne in hipocresye.
Of thys sorte was Himineus and Phe+letus becomminge of Sadducees false Christyanes and denyenge the latter re+surreccion whom Paule ded excommunycate.
So were also Phigellus a~d Hermogenes bryngynge in agayne circumcysyon with certen ceremonyal obseruacyons to blemyshe the Gospell of Christ.
These with soche lyke whole howses (sayth Paule) teachyn+ge thinges that they ought not to haue for fylthye lucres sake.
And whan they were thus by the de+creed purpose of God shed vpon the ear+the or left vnto their owne earthlye be+astlynesse all destytute of his grace for contempnynge hys worde so gracyous+lye offred there lyghted a noysome and tedyouse botche vpon those me~ne which had the marke of the Beast or an vnchri+sten beleue through their perswasyons.
And vpo~ the~ also that worshypped hys Image or accepted them for Godlye that made lawes repugnaunt to hys lawes.
For the greate headed Rabynes of the Iewes ded not onlye sporte the con+sciences of the Israelytes their owne natyue contre menne but also of the Grekes and latynes the Asianes Ro+manes compellynge them for their ow+ne tradycyons to make Gods comman+dementes of non effect.
These hauynge a pretence of Godlye lyuynge denyed the power therof.
Of this sort were they which entred into howses and brought into bondage women with synne.
For a more depe vnderstandinge herof conferre thys with the first Seale openynge and the first Trompet blowynge and lyke wyse the other .vi. folowynge.
Â¶The Paraphrase After this went fourth the seconde Angell of the seconde Seale openynge effundynge hys vyall vpon the see.
Accordynge to the decree of God almygh+tye for the seconde age of the Christen churche regned amonge the Christyanes deceytfull bretherne and peruerse teachers betraynge the true mynysters and delyuerynge them vnto deathe for Iesus Christes sake that hys lyfe myght be in their mortall fleshe.
For in this lyfe he proueth his electes with Abraha~ and Iob to saue them and to make the~ iust folowers of Christ whom yt beho+ued to suffre ere he e~tered into his glorie Upon the see or wauerynge multy+tude was thys vyall shedde.

So was Rabby Moyses the Egypcya+ne Rabyna and Rabasses with soche other confyrmynge the same.
All bloudye was thys see the vyall ones shedde thervpon.
All fleshlye were the peple in their iudgementes their har+tes fulfylled with cruelte and mourther agaynst Christes true witnesses through their peruerse preachynges.
Yea in that furiouse rage they thought they ded god great good seruyce whan they putt hys seruauntes vnto deathe.
Thys bloud was also in a maner as the bloud of a dead ma~ne.
For dead was the doctryne that they taught euen the sleyng letter yt self.
Dead were also their Ceremonyes their rytes and their ydell obseruacyons.
So that euerye lyuynge thynge dyed in that bloudye see.
All they which semen through glytteringe hypocresye to lyue wanted the verye lyfe which ys hydde in Christ and that ryseth offaythe in hys lyuinge worde.
So ded they also which depended all vpon the vayne ple+asurs of this lyfe exercysinge here tyrannye both in wordes and doynges.
Neyther were they out of the same dau~+ger that fell from the veryte ones know+ne nor yet they which durst not receyue yt for feare of persecution but both peryshed in this see.
and therfor hast thu ge+uen them bloude to drynke for they are worthye.
Next in his course went out the thir+de Angell vnder the thirde Seale openinge and he poured out his vyall vpo~ the watterye flowdes a~d fowntaynes and all they became verye bloude.
By his sett decree for the thirde age of the churche suffred the lorde false heretykes to rage in all kindes of erroure stron+gelye to delude the vnbeleuers.
These lyghted vpon the swete waters by whom are ment the sacred scrip+turs refreshinge the drye sowles.
Who so euer drynketh (sayth Christ) of the wa+ters that geue he shall neuer be more a thirst.
Of these waters haue they defyled both the ryuers and welspringes with bloud.
Both the lawe and Gospell the fygure and veryte the commaundeme~t and promes the doctryne of Prophetes and Apostles haue they corrupted with their false interpretacyons and gloses with frowarde dryftesand opynyons with vayne tradycyons and worshyppynges and with carnall wysdome a~d murtherynges.
Of thys sort were and Artius with soche other lyke as in the .viij. chapter afore.
And harde (sayth Saint Iohan) an Angell betokenynge those syncere wytnesses to whom God had opened for that age his secrete iudgeme~tes.
And thys Angell sayd. Omnipotent creator and lorde which art not onlye of thy self at thys present instaunt but wart also essencyallye in thy self without begynnynge.

Not o~lye became they vayne in their thoughtes their folyshe hartes darkened (not vnlyke to them that hath eares a~d+heare not eyes and se not) but also there remayned vnto them after this lyfe a perpetuall vengeaunce without mercye for their cruell oppressyons as a due re+warde of their errour.
Yet an other Angell harde (sayth Saynt Ioha~) eue~ out of the aulter whych ys Christ.
Thys Angell sygnyfyeth those wytnesses that su~tyme confessed the tru+the here and now resteth from their labours in the lorde.
These though they be departed afferme that the other hath seyd afore.
In token that now beynge departed they forget not that truthe which they afore confessed lyuynge styl yet in the same.
He that holdeth my wor+de (sayth Christ) shall neuer tast of deathe.
And this ys their saynge in mysterie or wordes comprehendinge their secrete confessyon.
As the lyuynge beleuers sayth of the by mouthe so saye we now in the sprete.
That thy decreed iudgeme~tes are euer more true and thy maruelouse workynges ryghtouse.
The first ys called in so+me translacyons the Angell of waters the other here reported to come from the aulter to sygnyfye both sortes.
And power was geuen vnto hym to vexe men with he+ate of fyre.
And the men raged in great heate and spake euyll of the name of God.
Consequentlye by the appoyntment of God the fort Angel in the forth Se+ale openynge poured out his vyall of Gods wrathe on the sunne.
As the lorde had eternallye prefixed in the forth age of the Christen churche.
For the whole worldes pannyshme~t was Christ sore blemyshed which ys the clere sunne of ryghtousnesse.
Antichristes in those dayes darken the true glorye of God with their many folde sectes of Hipocresye.
The po+pe had for hys part an innumerable swarme of shorne smered Sodomytes and Mahomete a fowle flocke of frantyck fabyllers which with their newlye paynted relygyons and prodygyouse ob+seruacyons made first all the worlde to wonder and than to worshyp for Christ takynge darkenesse for lyght and synne for ryghtousnesse.

So that the menne raged in greate heate speakynge euyll of the name of God which had power ouer those plages.

In order succedeth by the dyuyne ordinaunce the Angell vnder the fift seale openynge pourynge out hys vyall of Gods indignacyon vpon the seate of the Beast.
After non other sort than the lorde had afore predyffyned for mannes vnfaythfulnesse sake was the proude be+astlye kyngodome of the Papacye and the execrable regne of Mahomete reple+nyshed with all filthye abhomynacyo~s vnder the sunne.
For in the other age afore they ded but crepe into the hartes of me~ne through the glytterynges of hy+pocresye and dissimulate sanctyte.
But here haue they obtayned the power seate and auctoryte of the Beast and so gotten vnto them the myghtye Monarchyes of the vnyuersall worlde.
Here regned they without checke in all vayne glorye hawtynesse malyce pryde murther Hipocresye superstycyon Idolatrye and blasphemye of Gods name.
And therfor their kyngedomes as all one in deuylllyshenesse became all darke without the lyght of Gods veryte full of the stynkinge smoke of the bottomlesse pytte.

In detractynge the veryte moche grefe they suffred in their desperate hartes their wormes not dyenge nor their fyre quenched the scor+pyons of the earthe stynginge them also.
Spyghtfullye they blasphemed the omnipotent lorde of heauen for verye anguishe and dolour of their sores and woundes.
For non other are the frutes of a desperate conscience than blasphemyes of God as in Cain Iudas and soche other lyke.
Non other are the vtte+raunces of an hart but hea+uye hatefull mormurynges.
And therfor yt foloweth that they repented them not of their dedes.
For in a crucyate or fearfullye vexed conscience can neuer dwell true repentaunce.

This one lyenge sprete which hath bene a murthe+rer from the begynnynge comprehendynge in him all vncleane spretes lyke as doth the Beast all Antichristes hath co~byned together into zele of fatherlye tradicyons all vayne gloryouse and vngodlye mynded gouernours agaynst God and his Christ.
And this hath not bene without the secrete permission of God willynge to proue his electes by stronge sufferynges that they myght receyue at his hande the rewarde of stronge victorye or of his habundaunt ryches.
This place here called in the Hebrue Armagedon betokeneth in misterye an hyll of dylectable frutes interpreted of some for the hyll of the Gospell and is commonlye taken of the Hebrues for that is swete or of value.
And this with+out fayle is the churche which oft tymes in the scripturs ys called the plentuouse hyll of God the hyll of Gods howse the hyll of myrhe the hyll of the hyll of Syon Carmelus and with soche other lyke.
All their power malyce and tyrannie is there extremelie vttred at the Antichristes laboure and desyre which are excedynglye dronken in the bloud of holye martyrs which hath bene shedde vpon earthe from ryghtouse Abell vnto this daye.
But whan the almyghtye setteth kynges vpo~ the earthe it shall be clere euen in the darkenesse that the hyll of Basan is Gods hyll.
And there came a great voyce out of heauen from the seate sayenge.
to geue vnto her the cuppe of wyne of the fearcenesse of his wrathe.
And the me~ blasphemed God bycause of the plage of the
for it was great and the plage therof was sore.
Finallye the seuenth Angell went forth vnder the seuenth seale openynge as God had eternally determined throw+ynge out the content of hys vyall into the ayre.
For the seuenth age of the christen churche by the verye set purpose of God are manye conuerted to the truthe and become with Paule the ves+sels of eleccion that afore were wyth Iudas the vessels of wrathe vnder the great aduersarye of God.
Neyther is it anye blemishe vnto them to be called here that they were afore vyals of wrathe consyderynge that Simon leprosus beynge ones healed of his leprosye was euer after called a leper.
In case lyke Paule after his conuersyon was not ashamed to report hym self both a Pharyse and also the sonne of a Pharyse.
These by the myghtye determynacion of Gods stronge iudgement are sent into the ayre.
Most effectuallye are they lyghtened wyth the sprete of God and prouoked stiflye to stande vp agaynst the aereall powers regnynge in the fyckle fantasticall Antychrystes and hypocrytes conde~pninge by Gods worde their vnyuersall doctrines and deuyllyshnesse.
These powers are no lesse than deuyls who~ Christ calleth fow+les of the ayre Peter a~ Ioha~ mannis ad+uersaryes saynt Paule the gouerners of the darkenesses in spyrytuall wyckednesse.
Whils these thinges are in doynge out of heauen which is the vnyuersall congregacion yea from the verye trone of God which is the electe faythfull nombre (for they are onlye the seate of God) came a voyce of reioysinge saynge after this sort.
Chrystes glorye ones manyfestlye knowne worlde is at an ende.
The wycked hath done all their myscheffes and the nombre of owr bretherne is fulfylled.
Thus shall they preache a full delyueraunce of the captyues and the peceable yeare of the lorde.
Thys ys the sylence of an halfe howre space men+cyoned afore in the .viij. chapter and the returne of this worlde vnto Chryst in the .xij. Chapter.
Not that there shall in those dayes be no enemies (for the remnaunt shall styll remayne) but that they shall not then openlye dare rage persecute and kyll the worlde beynge at so the a vniuersall quyet.
Yet shall there happen in those dayes voyces thonderynges and lyghtenynges.
Voyces of swete blessynges a~d dylectable promyses to the faythfull congregacyon.
Thonderynges of terrour to the vnfaythfull multytude com+maundynge thynges contrarye to the fleshe.
And fearefull lyghtenynges of condempnacyon to the reprobate hypocrytes and desperate obstinates.
And all from one worde of the lorde or one Gospell preachynge in dyuerse respectes no small earthquake folowynge vpon the same.
What commocy+ons heuye complayntes fearefull trem+blynges sorowes cryes grefes syghyn+ges waylynges grudgynges gruntynges gronynges wepynges and ha~+des wryngynge wyll be amonge the earthlye mynded Antichristes and hypocrites byshoppes prestes prelates holye water mongers and parryshe clarkes lawers whores caruers paynters and waxe sellers whan their churche shall be turned ouer by the iudgement of the sayd worde yt is easye to coniecture.
Soche a one wyll this earthquake be (sayth the text) so myghtye and so stronge as neuer was yet sens menne war vpon the earthe or sens that earth+lye generacyon first beganne.
Than shall be cleane taken awaye the carnall churche of Antychryst or the smered Si+nagoge of
Neyther shall the Pope wyth hys dysgysed rable anye more be seane here nor yet with his monstruouse muster.
In soche wyse shall their lawes secdes and ceremonyes be destroyed in tho+se dayes that no manne shall be fownde so bolde as ones to allowe one of the~ openlye.
Than shall the glorye of chri+stes name shyne the worlde ouer he ma+kynge of his enemyes hys stole.
More ouer in this terrible earthqua+ke the great spyrytuall cyte called Sodo+me a~d Egypt or the holye whoryshe mo+ther the churche shall be disseuered into in partes of the which .ij. shall styll be wycked the thirde conuerted vnto god+lynesse.
Two partes shall be dispersed (sayth Zacharye) the thirde shall remay+ne to the lorde.
Of them which haue and shall go out of mynsters and mo+nasteryes collegys and couentes churches and cloysters patryshes and nonneryes one sort shall inwardlye be geuen to Antichristes superstycyousnesse and Hipocresye.
An other sort vpon dyuerse fleshelye consideracyons shall faynedlye fall to the Gospell.
The thirde sort onlye of loue towardes God and zele of helthe in their neybers shall vnfaynedlye cleaue to the Scripturs.
Thus shall the vngodlye sort be coupled styll with the Godlye in euerye lande and prouynce and be the moche greatter no~bre.
Yet shall they for that tyme attempt nothinge agaynst them the trewthe so strongelye reg+nynge.
Neuer thelesse yet ys yt not to be thought that they shall than ha+ue nothinge to suffre consyderynge that it is a kyngedome of sufferaunce.
Christ to head of that congregacyon suf+fred oned incommodyte or other alwayes so longe as he was here lyuynge.
It shall therfor behoue the~ which are his misticall me~bers alwayes to suffre.
For the seruaunt is no better than his lorde nor the souldiour tha~ his head captayne.
And to make his good the lorde sayth in Zacharye.
The same third part wyll leade through fyre and pourge yt as syluer or golde in the fornace.
Than shal euerye godlye creature folowe Christ in bearynge hys crosse.
They shall mortyfye their fleshlye members synge all fornicacyon fylthynesse Idolatre couetousnesse pryde anger and malyce.
They shall helpe suffer and forbeare one an other hauynge pytefull compassion vpon the weake sycke and nedye.
Therfor this great or generall cyte thus deuyded all other particuler or nacyonall cytees must also fall.
The blasphemouse Pantheon of Rome ones peryshinge all other churches of the vnfaythfull must nedes folowe sone after in their course.
For the fou~d acyon taken a waye the buyldynge can not endure.
So that from thens forth shall be no po+pyshe sectes no supersticiouse ceremonyes no heythnyshe obseruacions nor open Idolatrye in all the worlde.
But whan the remnaunt of the wycked shall attempt a freshe to rayse vp agayne soche abhomynacions the lorde shall wythout warnynge fall vpon them with his most fearefull and terryble last iudgement.
Great Babylon the aforesayd mother of all whoredom and fylthynesse shall than come in remembraunce before God.
He shall than consyder her ab+homynable blasphemye her pryde cruel+te murther and synnes wythout nombre wayenge them in right balaunce ac+cordynge vnto iustyce.
He shall also rewarde her to drynke the fearce cuppe of his wrathe or wyne of his great indignacyon which is the perpetuall deathe of sowle.
The verye dregges of his Ire shall she tast yea vnspekeable sorowes and peynes without ende.
For non other is it to come in remembraunce before hym at that daye but to be condempned and receyue ponnyshment accordynge to her dedes.
Tha~ shal leuerye Ile (which is a place of refuge within the see) flee awaye and not tarye.
The mountaynes that are wonte to geue socour vnto the~ that be on the lande shall not at that daye be fownde.
No confort shall she than haue nor sure helpe anye where.
No remedye wyll be at that daye to flee from the fearefull face of the iudge.
Than will neyther merytes nor sowle Masses helpe neyther blessynges nor knelynges sacrifices nor se~synges wawlynges nor ryngynges bussinges nor synginges but will she nyll she nedes must she abyde hys heuye and terri+ble sentence.
And there fell great hayle (sayth the text) as yt had bene wayghtye talentes.
Alwayes must yt be remembred that co~+mo~lye the tyme past ys vsed in this pro+phecye for the tyme to come for the of the thynges here spoken.
This hayle ys non other than the heuye tempest or plage of the seyd fearefull and ter+ryble iudgementes of the lorde which shall on that woofull daye fall sodenlye a thycke hayle vpo~ the miserable mul+tytude of them that boasted themselues to be the holye churche and vpon their wycked folowers compared here vnto Babylon.
This plage ys here also for non other cause lykened vnto talentes bur that yt ys in wayght and measure to be mynystred vnto them by the preordynacyon of God.
So moche peyne and soro+we ys due vnto that whoryshe generacyon as she hath glorifyed herself in fyl+thye delyghtes and so manye ponnyshmentes to be rewarded her.
Out of heauen shall this vehement hayle fall from the fearefull sentence of the lorde Iesus Christ which shall than sit as a iudge in the middes of his fayth+full congregacyon they sittynge with hym as the bodye with the head in condempnacyon of the wycked.
For the great whore or the cyte called here Babylon is in this place to be take~ for that yt comprehendeth euen for men+ne in whom also are included wome~ by the common vsage of the Scripturs.
These menne shall spyghtfullye blas+pheme God because of the hayle plage or terrour of their tormentes.
They shall crye out of hym wysshinge that he had no soche powre so to torment them.
For the tempest ys great and the suferaunce therof excedynge paynefull.
As the lorde ys myghtye so are hys whan they fall.
Veheme~t ferce and stronge ys the lorde (sayth Esaye) ys the tempest of hayle breakynge euerye syde and bearinge downe stro~+ge holdes.
OFt hath occasyons be geue~ me in this boke to speake of great Babylon and of the Beast but here is place offred to describe the~ more at large.
And there came one of the se+uen Angels which had the seue~ vyalles.
with whom the kynges of the earthe haue commytted whoredome.
and the inhabyters of the earthe are dronken with the wyne of her fornicacion.
Â¶The Paraphrase After this came (sayth Saynt Iohan) one of the .vij.
Angels or vnuaryable de+crees of the lordes eternall iudgeme~tes which had the .vij. vyals of his wrathe as afore hath bene declared.
And this Angell or sett purpose of God as an heaue~lye massenger talked with me in mysterye.
Of fauorable goodnesse in secrete ma+ner he assertayned me therbye of this wo~+derfull iudgement here folowinge to be fulfilled at the latter ende of the worlde.
Come hyther frynde Iohan wyll shewe the in secretenesse the terryble iud+gement of the great whore or cou~terfett churche of Hipocrites as God hath appoynted yt. Nedes must thys whore Rome for that which ys here after spoken that she ys the great cyte which ouer the kynges of the earthe.
Euident yt is both by the scripturs and cro+nycles that in Iohans dayes Rome had her domynyon ouer all the whole worlde.
And beynge infected with the abhominacyons of all landes ryghtlye ys she called Babylon or cyte of confusion not onlye in this reuelacyon but in the first Epistle of Peter.
And lyke as in the scripturs oft tymes vnder the name of Ierusalem ys ment the who+le kingedome of Iuda so vnder the name of Rome here maye be vnderstanded the vniuersall worlde with all their abhominacyons a~d deuylyshenesses their Idolatries withchecraftes sectes papacyes presthodes relygyons shauinges anoyntings blessinges sensings processions and the deuyll and all of soche beggeries.
For all peples se~s Christes ascencyon hath this Rome infected with her pestylent poysons gathe+red from all Idolatrouse nacyons soche tyme as she helde ouer the~ the monarchyall suppremyte.
And lyke as Babylon had the Israelytes captyue vnder a bodylye trybute so hath this Rome had the Christianes both in their bodyes a~d sowles.
At the writynge of this felt Iohan of their cruelte beynge ex+yled into Pathmos an Ile of Lycya for the faythfull testymonye of Iesu.
And so ded poore creature with my poore wy+fe and children at the gatheringe of this.
No maruele though she be here called a great whore.
For no where were euer yet seane so manye Idolle wurshyppynges so many vayne obseruacyons so manye superslycyouse sectes so manye errours in Hipocresye so manye fal+se Prophetes and so manye prodygyou+se kyndes of fylthynesse no not in Sodome yt self nor yet in miserable Egypt.
This Babylonyshe whore or disgised Synagoge of shorelynges sitteth vpon manye waters or peples that are fantas+ticall fyckle or folyshe.
For no~ are in co~+science subiect vnto her that are consta~t+lye grounded in the sure doctryne of fay+the.

With this stynkynge strompett haue the myghtye potentates of the vnyuersall earthe the Emprours Kynges Princes and other notable gouernours commytted most shamefull whoredome in the sprete by manye strau~ge worship pynges agreynge amonge themselues to her wyckedlye decreed lawes and customes.
To longe shuld we stande here in this place yf we shuld describe them all seuerallye in their colours at large as they be.
Through the craftye legardemayne of the Prestes on the one syde and the cruell constytucyo~s of Princes on the other syde the dwellers of the earthe or world+lye mynded multytude are dronken with the wyne of her fornycacyon spyrituall or practysed worshypyynges be+sydes the prescripte rewles of Gods wor+de.
Not onlye they which haue bene couetouse carnall lewde and wretched hath folowed their abhomynacyo~s but also an innumerable sort of the electe nombre hath beleued their lyes and errours.
Yea they haue bene so dased with their dottages and so tangled with their customes that as menne losynge their wittes without all god+lye remembraunce reason wysdome dyscressyon vnderstandynge iudgement and grace the lawes of God lay+ed a part the co~maundeme~ts neglected and the scripturs despised they haue onlye kneled crossed kyssed set vp and holden vp their handes before rotten postes but also called them fathers in heaue~.

And sawe sayth Saynt Iohan in mysterye a woman (for an whore at the first blushe semeth onlye a woman) sye+tynge vpon a rose coloured Beast.

For yf soche terrible slaughter were not the true Christen faythe shuld increase to the great dymynyshment of her glorye.
She ys in lyke case floryhshynglye decked with golde precyouse stone and pearles not onlye in her manyfolde kin+des of ornamentes as in her copes corporasses chesybles tunicles stooles fan+noms and myters but also in mysterye of cou~terfett godlynesse.
Manye outwar+de bragges maketh this paynted chur+che of Christ of hys gospell and of hys Apostles sygnyfyed by the golde precy+ouse stone and pearles which ys but a glytterynge coloure.
For nothynge min+deth she lesse than to folowe them in conuersacyon of lyuinge.
More ouer her hande which ys hee exteryoure mynistracyon she hath a gol+den cuppe full of abhomynacyons and fylthynesse of her execrable whoredome.

For she ys the oryginall mother the cau+se the begynninge the rote the spryn+ge and the fountayne of all spirituall and in a maner of all flesh+lye abhominacyons also done vpon the earth.
Thys is to the faythfull sort as a written name of her euydent clere open and manyfest.
But to the vnfayth+full yt ys onlye as a mysterye hydde~ darke obscure and neglect.
For so are the secretes that God openeth to babes and hydeth from the wyse. And (sayth Saynt Iohan) perceyued yt euidentlye in fore vndersta~din+ge that this woman the verye wyse of the deuyll and of hys beastlye bodye (for the Byshoppes are the husbandes of their Romyshe churches) was all dronken in the bloudye slaughter of the Sayntes or ernest Christe~ beleuers in the excedinge tyrannouse murther of faythfull wytnesses of Iesu or preachers of hys worde.
Besydes all wysdome ys she and forgetfull of her self through this same bloudye dronkenesse so great excesse hath she taken.
And whan perseyued and sawe her with all her adders whelpes so beasty she (sayth Saynt Iohan) with excedyn+ge wonder marueled.
Not onlye she was thus ouersett with bloud or outragyouse murtherynge innocentes but also of her excedynge great abhomynacyons.
And most of all wondered that the almyghtye God coulde with so moche suffre her in soche myschefe.
wyll shewe the the mysterye of the woman and of the Beast that beareth her which hath seuen heades and ten hornes.
and shall ascende out of the bottomlesse and shall go into

And as was thus wyth my the Angell or a fore named of the Lorde sayd vnto me these wordes.
Wherfor dost thu thus maruele thu mortall manne? For thy gentyll and meke shall shewe vnto the the misterye of this wretched woman a~d of the Beast that beareth her which hath heades and .x. hornes.
By this knowe the true churche from the the iust preachers from the the syncere doctrine from theyr subtyle sophysmes a~d their lawfull from their cruellye vsurped presumpcyons.
For that sheweth the lorde vnto his electes that he wyll not haue knowne of all menne.
The execrable Beast or carnall kyngedome of Antichrist which thu hast se here in misterye was as concerninge his beginninge in Cain first of all a~d so continued forth in the fleshlye chyldren of menne in the chaplaynes of Pharao Baal a~d Bel in the cruell byshoppes prestes and lawers with soche other lyke tyll the deathe of Chryst and so forthe.
And now the sayd Beast is not in po+wer and as he hath bene.
For in Iohans tyme serten years before the wrytinge of this reuelacyon was the proude clergye of the Iewes vtterlye de+stroyed by Titus a~d Despasiane in the terrible syege of Hierusalem.
Not yet shall this beast ryse agay+ne in the Romyshe pope and Mahomete a~d in their false prelates doctours.
He shall ascende out of the bottomlesse pytte from the stinkynge denne of Sathan exaltynge him self in worship aboue all that is called God.
But in the conclusion he shall haue an ende. Into perdicyon shall he go wythout fayle.
The Lorde shall first vtter his wic+kednesse (as now in this age) and than with the sprete of his mouthe consume him and destroye him.
So that his high clymynge vp shall at the last be the chefe cause of his fall.
Yet shall his wicked remnaunt ones agayne sett vp theyr crystes and persecute a freshe but that shall no full rayse vnto him.
And the rable of reprobates which dwell on the earthe or for earthlye commodytees contempneth Godes truthe shall wonder ones agayne not without moche inwarde reioyce that their churche ryseth agayne out of the olde hypocresyes.
Whose names are not regestred in Christ which is the large boke of lyfe and hath bene both the lyfe a~d the lyghe of menne sens the first constitucyon of the moueable worlde.
No they are not nombred amonge those ryghtouse that shall regne with him in glorye.
These aduersaryes of God and his worde shall haue moche gladnesse in their wycked hartes whan they beholde the Beast thus commynge vp agayne that was of soche magnificence and now is but a thynge of nowght that was estemed aboue God and now is proued dampnacyon.
So longe is this beastlye Antychryst as he worketh the mysterye of iniquite in the and whan he leueth that workynge than is he no longar.
Marke in this pro+cesse past the nature of Gods eternall de+cre for this age of his churche.
First it sheweth and than it condempneth the cursed Sinagoge of the deuyll.

And the Be+ast that was and is not is euen the eyght.
Necessarye it is therfor to take hede least thu holde the harlot and Beast for that they boast them selues to be to thy damp+nacyon.
The .vij. heades of the Beast afore+mencyoned by the playne diffinicyon of the holye ghost are here to be taken for vii. mountaynes or the vniuersall princelye monarchies of the .vij. clymates of the worlde.
Upon these the woman that Babylonyshe harlot Rome (from whome hath yssewed all spirytuall whoredome) in most proude maner sitteth hauinge ouer them a vniuersall dominyon.
For in Iohans tyme to Rome was all the worlde subiect.
Under whose cruell regne was Christ done to deathe so hath his faythfull members bene ener sens by a newe kyngedome in the same.
These heades are also .vij. kynges or goueunours of the aforesayd monorchyes seduced by all kyndes of craftye errours and deuylyshe suggestyons of that Beast.
So that marke well this place the head with the tayle and the cause with his effecte in these present significacyons shall no preiudyce be founde to that hath bene sayd in the other though they seme verye dyuerse.
For both the gouernours and also the landes or the peples subiect vnto them haue vniuersallye bene blynded by their wylye toytchecraftes.
And so haue the worldlye porentates wyth the spyrytuall Antychrystes agreed that both they haue vsurped one malygnau~t medlynge ouer the sowles of menne to corrupt their faythe the prynces applyenge their powers vnto the same.
And that causeth the holye Ghost here to call them the beastes heades vnder the tytle of mountaynes and kynges.
For vn+der their princelye auctoritees hath all their myschefes bene fulfylled to vphol+de this whoore agaynst Christ and his worde.
Fyue of these heades are fallen from the vnyuersall monarchye of Rome.
All the dominyons of Affrica and Asia hath renounced the obedyence of her em+pyre.
Onlye cleaueth Europa vnto her which is the least of the thre and yet not all therof.
Whan the Papacye grewe the whole empyre of the Grekes called Constantynople fell cleane from the and became with other dyuerse monarchyes the possession of Mahometes secte or of the Agare+nes and Turkes.
Of the other empyres maye a lyke coniecture be had.
Thus haue they declyned from her not so goynge forth nor yet rysynge vp vnto Christ for only is it sayd here that they were fallen.
And one head is (sayth the text) at this present tyme remaynynge the other head is not come as yet but wyll come her after.
This head remayninge is the sixt and it is that feble empyre that Ro+me now holdeth and haue holden sens Iohans tyme.
The power of this empyre is ruynouslye demynyshed and the notable fame therof decayed betwixt the Popyshe prelates and the Frenche menne a great part of the landes becommynge Saynt Peters patrimonye.
To make it a fytte head of the Beast to the vpholdynge of this whorishe churche (the auctoryte therof maynteyninge her lawes) Gregorye the fift Pope co~mytted the emprours chosynge vnto .vi. princes of Germanye .iij. of them beyn+ge Archebyshoppes.
He appoynted also the kynge of Bohem for the seuenth than beynge trybutarye vnto him and his owne feed man as an odde persons to waye vpon their sydes yf nede place and tyme shuld requyre yt. Prouyded alwayes that he shuld take his othe and receyue his crowne imperyall at Rome.
So that now thowgh it styll be the same in tytle that it was in Iohans dayes yet is it so dyuerse from it through dimynishment of power and so vnlyke in outwarde magni+fycence as it neuer had bene the same.
The seuenth head that is not yet come is the Papysticall kyngedome of owr Romyshe spiritualte.
For therof apered nothynge in Iohans tyme nor yet more than .v. hondreth years after it.
The Byshoppes of Rome (as they call them) from Peter to Syluester were ve+rye poore sowles symple creaturs and menne not regarded but despysed of the worlde.
They were no newe lawe makers for the more part but rather they gaue their whole dilygence to se those lawes obserued whom the holye ghost had made to their handes.
Neyther were they anye Masse sayers sowle syngers or procession goers but as was Saynt Paule with the other Apostles symple preachers onlye and for theyr syncere preachynge they suffered the de+athe of theyr bodyes.
But after the Do+nacyon of Co~stantyne and other plentuouse almesses commytted vnto theyr handes for the socoure of the poore they became all confessours and toke them to their ease at home.
Than was laboure verye tedyouse vnto them preachynge verye troblouse and peynefull.
Than stodyed they all to please the powers pe+ceablye to holde styll their plesaunt pos+sessions and by spyrituall polycyes to increase them more and more the poore in a maner forgotte~.
Then came in that holye ceremonye and that with latten howres seruynge of Sayntes a~d pray+enge for the dead to prouoke men to offer to Corban.
Thus crept they vp in hy+pocrisye daye by daye tyll soche tyme as Iohan of Constantinople contended with Gregorye of Rome for the supremyte.
In the which contencion thowgh Gregorye layed for him self Saynt Peters keyes with manye other sore argu+mentes and reasons yet was he commaunded by Mauricius the Emperour after the generall Synode to obeye the sayd Iohan as the vnyuersall head bisshop of the whole worlde.
Than were these holye fathers compelled to tarrye a layser and vnder craftye colours to wayte their praye.
In processe of tyme whan Phocas was Emprour Bonifacius the thirde a manne of a wylye prac+tyse perceyuynge him moche geuen to bayne glorye and couetousnesse greatlye also to dissalowe the actes of Mauricius his predecessour through flatterye and mede obtayned of him that the churche of Rome shuld be holden from thens forth for the head churche of the worlde a~d he for the head byshop.
Wha~ this was ones gotten than rose they vp so hygh that the Emprour became their fore stole and all other chrysten princes their waytynge to ryde and ronne make and marre stryue and fyght slee and kyll at their commaunde+ment and pleasure.
Thus became the Romyshe Pope the seuenth kynge that was in Iohans tyme yet to come.
If thu marke in the crouycles good reader thu shalt fynde that Phocas the first Pope maker slewe his master the Emprour Mauricius signifyenge in my sterye the sayd Pope makynge to be an vtter destruccyon to the empyre.
The Popes name was also at that tyme Bonifacius which is as moche to saye as bona facies a good face.
Which betokened that this newe raysed kyngedome shuld shewe a fayre face euermore or a shynynge pretence of holynesse what myschef so euer it wrought eyther agaynst God or manne in abhominable supersticyon.
And whan this seuenth kynge commeth (sayth the text) he must contynue a space or abyde a lytle season.
He must haue a tyme by the permyssion of God strongelye to delude the vnbeleuers whych wyll neyther se nor heare reade nor yet thankefullye receyue his worde of saluacyon so gratyouslye offered them.
So corrupt are the fleshelye affectes of menne that moche more prone they are to lyes and supersticyons than to the veryte of the lorde which is to be lamented.
Chryst came first in the name of his heauenlye father but him wyll they not receyue.
The Pope commeth in his owne wycked name and to hym ronne they by heapes.
For yet is it not a thowsande years sens the Papacye first beganne vnder Phocas which is but as a daye before God and that daye wyll he shorten by hys owne promes for hys electes sake whych to remember is their great con+forte.
For sone after that shall they be fullye restored in to the perfyght nombre of the chyldren of God.
And the execrable beast (sayth the text) that of late dayes was in auctoryte ouer all the worlde yea syttinge aboue God in the conscyences of menne and now is become of no reputacyon amonge menne (God openinge his myscheffes) is euen the eyght in no~bre.
And yet neuer the lesse is one of the .vij. heades.
For both is he the beastlye bodye it self comprehendynge in him the vnyuersall abhominacyons of all the earthlye kyngedomes and in that poynte dyuerse from the seuen heades and so the .viij. in nombre.
And also he is one of the .vij. heades and the seuenth in nombre in vsurpynge this proude worldlye kyngedome thus after a vayne temporall sort.
Ouer besides all this maye he also be called the eyght in the cursed remnaunt which after the peceable sylence of christen lyberte (Sathan loosoned) shall most cruellye persecute Chrystes congregacyon a freshe as in the .xx. chapter here folowynge wyll apere.
This Beast with his carryage the Antichrist with his churche or Sathan with his Sinagoge shall not onlye go in to destruccyon here by the mightye breathe of Goddes mouthe or the true preachinge of his Gospell but also into dampnacyon euerlastinge in the ende of the worlde with the deuyll his angels.
And the ten hornes which thu sawest are ten kynges.
And the .x. hornes) sayth the Angell vnto Iohan) which thu sawest here vpon the heades of this rose coloured Beast are in significacyon .x. kynges.
Some hath taken these .x. kynges for all those Emprours of the larynes sens Charle mayne which haue sworne them selues obedyent to the Bishop of Rome.
Some haue thought them to be those prynces which here in Europa haue afo+re tyme bene subiect to the Empyre of Rome.
As the kynges of Englande Fra+unce Spayne Portyugale Castele Denmarke Scotlande Dngarye Goheme and Napels.
But these considre not that they be yet more in nombre as Aragone Nauerre Cycyle Cypresse Sardyne Swethen Pole and soche other and are all included in the seuen heades as members of the afore rehersed empyres.
Neyther marke they that they are aboue the heades as hornes a~d more in nombre than the heades betokenynge a rygorouse auctoryte and ferce power which they proudelye vsurpe ouer them euerye where.
Afore they we+re but suggestyons but here are they ernest doers.
For in euerye region hath the beastlye Antichrist of Rome his Metropolytanes and primates.
As in Englande are Caunterberye and Yorke in Fraunce Thuronensis and Remensis in Spayne Tholetanus and in Portingale Hispalensis a~d Bracarensis in Irelande Armachanus and Dublimensis in Dennemarke Lunden+sis and Opsalensis in Germanye and Maguntinus in Hungarye and Colocensis in Italye Pisanus and Rauennas in Sycyle Panormitanus and Messanensis with an infynite nombre of byshoppes prelates prestes and religiouse besydes the fyghtynge orders of the Rhodes the Prussyanes the Redemers of captyues the Aragondes the Beorgyanes called de alga the Monteseanes the Castylyanes the Lusitaneanes the Calatraneanes and Saynt Iames war+ryours.
These had not yet at that tyme receyued the deuylyshe kyngedome of pestilent vsurpacyon ouer the sowles of menne.
For though in Iohans dayes arose certen Antichristes as Hebion Cerinthus Diotrephes Carpocras and so the lyke yet were they nothing to these.
But now in dede they haue receyued the same self auctoryte and power with the Beast that he toke afore of the Dragon in maner of kynges to rewle in the hartes and consciences of menne to his behoue.
For so moche as their auctoryte is not of God lyke as is the auctorite of kynges it is sayd here as kynges or as menne counterfeatynge them in vsurpynge a gouernaunce not frelye geuen them of God but of the deuyll.
All at one houre receyued they thys auctoryte wyth the Beast.
And that (I suppose) was in the generall counsell of Laterane at Rome gathered vnder the tytle to recouer Hierusalem agayne.
Where as confession in the eare was cruellye extorted of Christen peple vnder peyne of deathe and dampnacion by the whole consent both of the princes and bishoppes at the former suggestio~ of innocent the thirde besydes other wicked thinges.
As to heare lattyn ser+uyce to go procession on Sondayes to praye vnto dead Sayntes to worship Images to bye Masses for the dead to fast the fridayes with purgatorye par+dons merytes and fryres orders.
In the sayd counsell became the Metropolytanes as kynges by the auctorite ther+of appoynted they that
Balyues and other as byshoppes Curates and Parihe Prestes to haue cure and charge of so idle and in the sayd eare confession to receyue theyr accountes.
These counterfett kynges are all of one deuyllishe mynde practyse and pur+pose agaynst God and hisÂ· veryte.
And fullye they are fixed to geue the+ir whole power their stodye and theyr stre~gthe vnto the behoue of the BeastÂ· Not accordinge to Gods mynde wyll they rewle but all after his wyll pleasure agreynge alwayes vnto him as me~+bers to their heade to serue wickednesse after wickednesse in Babilo~.
His popisshe decrees wyll they seke his deuylishe decretals wyll they folowe his ceremonials wyll they obserue nothynge of the sacred scripturs.
What lerning so euer they haue what giftes of nature for+tune or grace all must be to the maintenaunce of his fantastycall fopperyes.
To hym are they sworne to do hym homage to obeye his lawes to kysse hys fete for hys gloryes sake to the Gospell.
And in so doynge they shall with the lambe which ys Iesus Christ.
They shall impugne hys truthe whan they thinke to do hym seruyce.
For that myschese they do to one of his they do to hys owne persone.
But be they neuer so dogged yet shall the lambe ouercome them in hys faythfull members yea by pacyent sufferaun+ce onlye.
The vyctorye (sayth Iohan) which ouercometh the worlde is a sure Christen faythe.
Vpon their syde fyghteth he which ys most myghtye a~d stronge yea the lorde that ys valeaune in battayle.
And he shall first ouercome them in this lyfe with the myghtye bre+athe of hys mouthe scatterynge them awaye as dust from the earthe.
And after thys shall hys terryble iudgement for euer condempne them.
For he ys by the auctoryte geuen hym of hys father the lorde of all lordes and by hys owne eternall Godhede the Kynge of all kynges hauinge all power in heauen and in earthe.
He ys constytte iudge of the quycke and the dead hauynge alone the euerlastynge Empyre with his father and the holye ghost and of his kingedome shall neuer be an endeÂ· By his permyssion doth all kinges regne he hath their hertes in his hande and iudgeth their thoughtes.
Both maye he geue them hys sprete and also take yt fro~ them and of his enemyes he shall make hys forestole.
He ys the same after Danyell that without anye hades was cut out of the mounte which breaketh the Iro~ the copper the earthe the syluer and the golde in peces.
By whome are ment the vnyuersall kyngedomes of this worlde.
Of this hys vyctorye are all they patyners with hym which are vpon hys by faythe.
Most specyallye those seruauntes of hys which after they called by grace and chosen by faythe perseuer styll constaunt feruent and sure in his veryte to the ende of their lyues.
Not onlye the lambe therfor shall the Beast but they also the doctryne of Paule that are called a~d chosen in him not fallynge from his trche for anye temptacyo~ or grefe but fast by yt vnto the verye deathe.
For those that the lorde hath prefixed afore he hath called iustifyed and allowed.
These auaunceth not themselues with the proude but mekelye they submit their crownes referrynge all vyctorye to the lambe as menne that coulde haue done nothinge in that behalfe with out hym.
The waters which thu sawe it where the whore sitteth.
Ad the te~ horns which thu sawest vpon the beast.
For God hath putte in their hartes to hys wyll.
And the woman which thu sawest is the greate cytye.
And after this longe communicacyo~ (sayth saynt Iohan) the aforeseyd Angel sayd thus vnto me to make vp his tale with.
The wauerynge waters which thu sa+west here now of late in mysterye whe+re as the Babylonyshe whore sitteth vpon the rose coloured Beast are in syg+nyficacyon all maner of peples of the carnall nacyons and the superstycyouse folke of manye sondrye tonges.
Not onlye in one place of the worlde rewleth this wanton relygyon of An+tichrist but in euerye lande in euerye do+mynion in euerye cumpanye amonge all occupacyons and languages.
The folyshe multytude euerye where beynge blynded by their subtyle sorceryes neyther hauynge faythe nor yet the feare of God before their eyes as a ragynge flood (the bankes broken downe) headlynges into all blasphemie and deuyllyshnesse.
More ouer the afore named .x. hornes (sayth the Angell) which thu by the will of God beholdest here in sprete vpon the seyd Beast of destruccyon are those verye persones which also shall hate the whore.
Her abhominacyons ones know+ne by the Gospell preachinge they shall abhorre her lawes despyse her auctoryte and contempne her customes.
They shall defeate her of those landes and possessyons which now she vniustlye They that afore were her fryndes shall than be her mortall enemyes denyenge her both tribute obedyence and seruyce so leauynge her without all
Not onlye are these the temporall gouernours as the kynge of Englande the kynge of Denmarke the Duke of saron the Landgraue of hesse and other Princes of Germanye with soche other as wyll here after folowe the same pryncyples but also the Metropolytanes and Byshoppes the Doctors and Prelates.
As are all redye Thomas Cra~+mere the arche Byshop of Cau~terburye Hermannus de weda the archebyshopp of Coleyne Godryck the Byshop of Ho+lye Barlowe the Byshop of Saynt Da+uids Byrde the Byshop of Chestre Thuleby byshop of Westmynstre tymer and Nicolas Sharton of late years Byshoppes of Worcester and Salys+burye with soche other lyke as wyll here after folowe their trade.
Though they were afore the hornes of the Beast for defence of the whore yet are they now fallen from hym and more shall euerye daye to make her desolate of honoure a~d naked of rentes and possessions.
So shall they chace that Babylonyshe harlot Rome with their preachers that neyther shall they leaue her coloure nor yet bewtye.
Considre what Ioha~ Reuclin Martyne Luther Erasmus Occolampadius Pomeran Bu+ter Capito Melanchton Grineus Calninus Brencyus Frances La~bert Bullinger a~d soche other hath done agaynst her alredye.
Lyke wyse here in Englan+de Bylneye Cyndale Frith Barnes Cromwell Couerdale Turner George Ioye Rose Rydleye Warde Beco~ a~d other els leauynge her neyther Rellyques nor Rodes Sectes nor Shrynes Abbeyes nor Pryoryes manye more co~+mynge after them of the same sort.
The+se shall make her so desolate that no ma~+ne shall in processe of tyme regarde her.
They shall leaue her so naked that all the worlde shall abhorre her that shall lo+ vpon her.
Besydes the takynge awaye of her carnall profyghtes and pleasurs they shall confounde her vnderstandinge of the scripturs and vtterlye con+sume the superfluouse obseruacyons of her whoryshe
Finallye with fyre shal they burne her in brynginge vnto nought all her ab+hominable rewles customes kyndes of Idolatrye.
All these ones plucked awaye by the euydent worde of God no longar shall this harlot apere.
For no lo~+gar contynueth the whore than the who redome ys in pryce.
Take awaye the rytes and Ceremonies the Iewels and ornamentes the Images and lyghtes the lordeshyppes and fatherhodes the aulters and Masses with the Byshoppes and Prestes and what is their holye churche any more? Not on+lye is this fleshe eatynge and burnynge declared now adayes in outwarde ex+perymentes as in the rebellyouse Monkes and Prestes of Englande and in the~ that arose there in the Northe specyallye in fryre forest and Margare
Chenye which were for their churche consumed lyke as were Baals chaplaynes at the broke of Cyson by Helyas but also misticallye in that is spoke~ of here afore.
For God hath (sayth the Angell) all blin+denesse secluded put it into the hartes of those and soche other Godlye menne by the infusyon of his sprete to fulfyll hys decreed will so pleasure in this behalf as vtterlye to destroye the Popyshe rely+gyon or fylthye abhominacyons of Antichrist.
He hath geuen yt them more ouer to do these thynges to hys glorye through the agrement of faythe that they haue in the vnyte of his Godlye truthe to the abolyshment of all Sectes false Prophetes and coniurers of Egypte.
Fynallye by hys grace he hath moued them through knowlege of his wor+de to rendre vp her blasphemouse kyngedome (whom sumtyme of ignoraunce they vsurped) vnto the malygnaunt Beast agayne as the hornes of hys pestyle~t heades.
After this sort ded good Latimer and Shaxton geue ouer their and so hath dyuerse other Godlye menne their promocyons and liuin+ges as manye more yet here after wyll do.
For as they haue begonne so shall they contynue in demynyshynge the ab+homynacyo~s of this whoryshe churche tyll the wordes and promyses of God by hys Apostles and Prophetes which can neuer fayle be whollye fulfilled in effect and tyll hys last iudgement do fy+nyshe all.
But thus do not all they which haue done of the yoke of the Popes obe+dyence or blotted out hys name.
For the greatter nombre of them retayneth styll the blasphemouse obseruacyons and Ce+remonies of hys Romyshe relygyon some makynge newe lawes of deathe for the establyshment of the same as ys in Englande the acte of the .vi. Artycles with dyuerse other more.
And for this remayneth here styll the Beast as recey+uynge the rendred kyngedome of the whore.
In whome ys also comprehended the wycked re~naunt that shall worke the last myschefe whome the lorde shall ende with hys seyd iudgement.
This Beast ys not without hys lyuelye Image styll workynge the same feates that hymself wrought afore though his head be greuouslye wounded in diuerse quarters of the worlde.
Who euer forswore the Pope more ernestlye tha~ ded Stokyslaye and Sampson and Tunstall wylson and fryre wattes with soche other holye prelates? Yet la+bour they tothe and nayle to haue Baby+lon styll Babylon Sodom Sodom Egypte Egypte.
But maruele not of the ordynau~ce of the lorde which all at one tyme prouyded Moyses to gyde his peple and yet hardened Pharao agaynst them which sent his sonne Iesus Christ to sa+ue them and yet suffred the Prestes to murther hym co~sideringe he ys that pot+ter which maketh both the vessels of ho+noure and dishonoure.
Breuelye to conclude the whole of this matter (sayth the Angell) the gorgy+ouse aparcled woma~ or glytteringe chur+che of a~tichrist which thu sawest here of late in misterye ys also in resemblaunce the great cyte Babylon the mother of all the spirituall abhominacyons and Idolatryes done vpon the earthe.
For lyke as from Syon hath the lawe comme~ forth and the worde of God from Hierusalem so hath yssewed forth from this Babylonyshe Rome soche a false Relygyon into Emprours princes and peples as with fylthyr superstycyons hath poysoned all the worlde.
For a kyngedom she hath ouer the kynges or noble gouernours of the ear+the a false power a vsurped auctoryte and a seate of verye pestylence.
Alas for pytye that so worthye potentates shuld be in subieccyon to so slynkynge an whore to so vyle an harlott beynge so the seruauntes of synne and captyue sla+ues to all wyckednesse from the which the lorde ones delyuer them.
wherin Iohan measureth the temple the aultre and the~ that worshippe therin.
The .ii. wytnesses do their appoynted offyces the Beast makynge warre agaynst them and sleynge them.
In heauen apereth a woman all clo+thed with the sunne whom the Dragon diuerselye vereth.
The woman fleeth into the wyldernesse and there ys preserued.
wherin a Beast ryseth out of the see with seuen heades and ten hornes receyuinge auctoryte of the Dragon.
An+other beast commeth out of the earthe with .ii. hornes which deceyueth the eart+lye dwellers and rayseth vp an Image lyke vnto the Beast.
In the ende ys cou~+ted the nombre of the Beast.
wherin the la~be standeth vpon the mou~te Syon and the vndefyled congregacy+on with him.

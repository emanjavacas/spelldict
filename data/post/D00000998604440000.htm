the scots declaration
the generall assembly of the kirk of scotland having received a declaration sent unto them by the commissioners of this kingdom now at london from the honourable houses of the parliament of england expressing their care to prevent the effusion of christian blood in that kingdom and their affections to reformation both in kirk and state and having taken the same to such consideration as the importance of so weighty matters and the high estimation they have of so wise and honorable a meeting as is the parliament of england did require have with universall consent resolved upon this following answer


that from the recent sense of the goodnesse of god in their own lae deliverance and from their earnest desire of all happinesse to our native king and that kingdom they blesse the lord for preserving them in the midst of so many unhappy divisions and troubles from a bloody intestine war which is from god the greatest judgement and to such a nation the compend of all calamities
they also give god thanks for their former and present desires of reformation especially of religion which is the glory and strength of a kingdom and bringeth with it all temporall blessings of· prosperity and peace

ii

that the hearts of all the members of this assembly and of all the within this kingdom are exceedingly grieved and made heavy that in so long a time against the professions both of king and parliament and contrary to the joynt desires and prayers of the godly in both kingdoms to whom it is more dear and precious then what is dearest to them in the world the reformation of religion hath moved so slowly and suffered so great interruption

they consider that not onely prelates formall professors prophane and worldly men and all that are popishly affected are bad counsellors and workers and do abuse their power and bend all their strength and policies against the work of god but the god of this world also with principallities and powers the rulers of the darknesse of this world and spirituall wickednesse in high places are working with all their force and fraud in the same opposition not without hope of successe they having prevailed so far from the beginning that in the times of the best kings of iuda of old and the most part of the reformed kirks of late a thorow and perfect reformation of religion hath been a work full of difficulties yet do they conceive that as it ought first of all to be intended so should it be above all other things with confidence in god who is greater then the world and he who is in the world most seriously endeavoured
and that when the supreme providence giveth opportunity of the accepted time and day of salvation no other work can prosper in the hands of his servants if it be not apprehended and with all reverence and faithfulnesse improved
this kirk and nation when the lord gave them the calling considered not their own deadnesse nor staggered at the promise through unbelief but gave glory to god
and who knoweth we speak it in humility and love and from

no other minde then from a desire of the blessing of god upon our king and that kingdom· but the lord hath now some controversie with england which will not be removed till first and before all the worship of his name and the government of his house be setled according to his own will
when this desire shall come it shall be to england after so long deferred hopes a tree of life which shall not onely yeeld temporall blessings unto themselves but also shall spread the branches so far that both this nation and other reformed kirks shall finde the fruits thereof to their great satisfaction

iii

the commissioners of this kingdom in the late treaty of peace considering that religion is not onely the mean of the service of god and saving of souls but is also the base and foundation of kingdoms and estates and the strongest band to tye subjects to their prince in true loyalty and to knit the hearts of one to another in true unity and love they did with preface of all due respect and reverence far from arrogance or presumption represent in name of this kingdom their serious thoughts and earnest desires for unity of religion that in all his majesties dominions there might be one confession of faith one directory of worship

one publike catechism and one form of this they conceived to be acceptable to god almighty who delighteth to see his people walking in truth and unity to be a speciall means for conserving of peace betwixr the kingdoms of easing the kings majesty and the publike government of much trouble which ariseth from differences of religion very grievous to kings and estates of great content to the king himself to his nobles his court and all his people to be abroad without scruple to themselves or scandall to others all may resort to the same publike worship as they were at their own dwellings of suppressing the names of heresies and sects puritans conformists separatists anabaptists which do rent asunder the bowells both of kirk and kingdom of despair of successe to papists and recusants to have their profession which is inconsistent with the true protestant religion and authority of princes set up again and of drawing the hearts and hands of ministers from unpleasant and unprofitable controversies to the pressing of mortification and to treatises of true piety and practicall divinity
the assembly doth now enter upon the labour of the commissioners unto which they are encouraged not onely by their faithfulnesse in the late treaty but also by the zeal and example of the generall assemblies of this kirk in

former times as may appear by the assembly at edinburgh decemb

in the yeer
which ordained a letter to be sent to england against the surplice tippet cornercoap such other ceremonies as then troubled that kirk that they might be removed
by the assembly at edinburgh april

humbly desiring the kings majestie to command his ambassadour then going to england to deal with the queen that there might be an union and band betwixt them and other christian princes and realms professing the true religion for defence and protection of the word of god and professors thereof against the persecution of papists and confederates joyned and knit together by the bloody league of trent as also that her majesty would disburthen their brethren of england of the yoke of ceremonies imposed upon them against the liberty of the word
and by the assembly at edinburgh march

ordaining the presbytry of edinburgh to use all good and possible means for the relief and comfort of the kirk of england then heavily troubled for maintaining the true discipline and government of the kirk and that the brethren in their private and publike prayers recommend the estate of the afflicted kirk of england to god
while now by the mercie of god the conjunction of the two kingdoms is many wayes increased the zeal of the generall assembly towards their happinesse ought to be no lesse
but besides these the assembly is much encouraged unto this duty both from the kings majestie and his parliament joyntly in their answer to the proposition made by the late commissioners of the

treaty in these words to their desire concerning unity of religion and uniformity of as a speciall means for conserving of peace betwixt the two kingdoms upon the grounds and reasons contained in the paper of the of march and given in to the treaty and parliament of england
it is answered upon the of june that his majestie with advice of both houses of parliament doth approve of the affection of his subjects of scotland in their desire of having conformity of between the two nations and as the parliament hath already taken into consideration the reformation of so they will proceed therein in due time as shall best conduce to the glory of god the peace of the kirk and of both kingdoms
and also severally for his majesty knoweth that the custody and vindication the conservation and purgation of religion are a great part of the duty of civil authority and power
his majesties late practise while he was here in person in resorting frequently to the exercises of publike worship his royall actions in establishing the worship and government of this kirk in parliament
and in giving order for a competent maintenance to the ministery and seminaries of the kirk and his majesties gracious letter to the assembly seconded by the speech of his majesties commissioner which containeth this religious expression where any thing is amisse we will endeavour in a fair and orderly way a reformation and where reformation is setled we resolve with that authority wherewith god hath vested us to maintain· and defend it in peace and liberty against all trouble that can come from without and against

all heresies sects and schismes which may arise from within
all these do make us hopefull that his majestie will not oppose but advance the worke of reformation
in like manner the honourable houses of parliament as they have many times before witnessed their zeal so now also in their declaration sent to the assemblie which not only sheweth the constancie of their zeal but their great grief that the work hath been interrupted by a malignant party of papists and persons especially of the corrupt and dissolute clergy by the incitement and instigation of bishops and others
their hopes according to their earnest desire when they shall return to a peaceable and parliamentarie proceeding by the blessing of god to settle such a reformation in the church as shall be agreeable to gods word and that the result shall be a most firm and stable union between the two kingdoms of england and scotland
the assemblie also is not a little encouraged by a letter sent from many reverend brethren of the kirk of england expressing their prayers and endeavours against every thing which shall be found prejudiciall to the establishment of the kingdom of christ and the peace of their soveraigne
upon these encouragements and having so potent a doore of hope the assemblie doth confidently expect that england will now bestir themselves in the best way for a reformation of religion and do most willingly offer their prayers and uttermost endeavours for furthering so great a work wherein christ is so much concern'd in his glory the king in his honour the kirk and kingdom of england in their happinesse and

this kirk and kingdom in the puritie and peace of the gospell

iv
that the assemblie also from so many reall invitations are heartned to renew the proposition made by the aforenamed commissioners of this kingdom for beginning the work of reformation at the uniformitie of for what hope can there be of unitie in religion of one confession of faith one form of worship and one catechisme till there be first one form of ecclesiasticall government yea what hope can the kingdom and kirk of scotland have of a firm and durable peace till prelacie which hath been the main cause of their miseries and troubles first and last be pluck't up root and branch as a plant which god hath not planted and from which no better fruits can be expected then such sower grapes as this day set on edge the kingdom of england



the prelaticall hierarchy being put out of the way the work will be easie without forcing any conscience to settle in england the government of the reformed kirks by assemblies for although the reformed kirks do hold without doubting their kirk officers and by assemblies higher and lower in their strong and beautifull subordination to be jur divino and perpetuall yet prelacie as it differeth from the office of a pastor is almost universally acknowledged by the prelats themselves and their adherents

to be but an humane ordinance introduced by humane reason and settled by humane law and custome for supposed conveniency which therefore by humane authority without wronging any mans conscience may be altered and abolished upon so great a necessity as is a hearty conjunction with all the reform'd kirks a firm and peace between the two kingdoms formerly divided in themselves and betwixt themselves by this partition wall and a perfect union of the kirks in the two nations which although by the providence of god in one island and under one monarch yet ever since the reformation and for the present also are at greater difference in the point of which in all places hath a powerfull influence upon all the parts of religion then any other reform'd kirks although in nations at greatest distance and under divers princes

vi

what may be required of the kirk of scotland for furthering the work of uniformitie of government or for agreeing upon a common confession of faith catechisme and directorie for worship shall according to the order given by this assembly be most willingly performed by us who long extreamly for the day when king and parliament shall joyne for bringing to passe so great so good a worke that all wars and commotions ceasing all superstitition idolatry heresies sects and schismes being removed as the lord is one so his name may be one amongst us and

mercie and truth righteousnesse· and peace meeting together and kissing one another may dwell in this island

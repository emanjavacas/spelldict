brieue Admonition vnto the nowe made Ministers of Englande: Wherein is shewed some of the fruiete of this theyr late framed fayth: Made by Lewys Euans student in Louain.
Vos ex patre Diabolo estis, desideriis patris vestri vultis obsequi.
Ye are of your father the deuyll, and the lustes of youre father yowe wyll doe. ANTVERPIAE TYPIS AE. DIEST.
[Figure: The heretikes indeuoure is, by al the meanes they may, The memorie of Christ his death, to we and put away: And therefore his Crosse, and howe he dyd dye To take out of sight, all shameles, they trye.
But thowe that arte Christian, of Christ his death see The passion here printed, as picture to thee.
WHEREAS yf had nowe sett furthe (according as in my laste translacion promysed) to the vewe and sight of all men, the manie and sundrie misdemeanour and enormities, wherwith can and may most iustlie accuse and charge yowe: Yf had (I saye) therewith sett furthe your names, then neaded not to dowbte, but that your owne doinges, had fullie enforced anie true meaning or indifferent man, to marvaile at your more then shamefull outerage, to dowbte your doctrine, to mystruste your teachinges, and at the leangth (not without a iuste cause) to followe the perfecte fayth of Christe his Catholyke churche.
But, notwithstanding that dyd vnderstande and see, thys waye to be bothe sure and readie, to rase out from mens hartes the horrible bloattes, and infection of heresyes, which in thys our vnhappie tyme, to the consusion of manye, raygneth with furie and rage througheout the Realme and countreys of England: (For, what can sooner deface vntrue doctrine, then the detecting of the teachers tyrannous intent, peruerse purposse, most lewde lyfe, and more then past impudent an arrogancie?) Yet, because the factes of some of yowe, be so dishonest, so detestable, and so to be hated, as yf your names were noted in deede, and that they people dyd once perceaue yt: ynoughe were yt to drive yowe (yf you be subiecte to any shamefastenes) in desperacion all lewdelye to leade and end the remnaunte of your wreached most woefull lyfes. for thys cause, wyll omytte at thys tyme your names.
will not muche speake of your priuate deedes and offences.
Onelye in this briefe treatyse will trauayle (lyke a freind) to pulle yowe out of the clammye claye: wherein your feete be founde of so long a tyme thus fast.
will indevour with gentle doinges to deliuer yowe from thys poreblinde disease, which so dreadefullye dothe cumber yowe.
And will trye, whether anye of yowe recanting from his cursed doctrine, will in tyme wyselie beware the euerlasting shame, which otherwise yow must of necessitie sustayne, to your vtter and most woorthye defacing foreuer.
For, in case perceaue yow styll to stand in your selfe will wanton newe fonde faythe and waye: shall be then forced (for some further admonicion vnto the people) to sett furthe your names, your habitacions, the faultes and haynous crimes, wherewyth wyll but all truelye accuse yowe, and also the tyme, the place, and the personnes, which shall make for the manifest testimoniall and proofe of the trothe: which thing (I am sure) yowe wolde be right sorye to see in printe, and so published to your perpetuall deserued reproache.
But, there be of yowe peraduenture, which do litle thinke, that can be pryevie to anye poincte of your peruerse lyfe and behaviour: or at the leaste doe suppose yt impossible, that should haue the full vnderstanding of all your vnbrydeled beastlynes and follye.
In deede, althoughe that muche of your illaudable lyfe must needes be vnto mee vnknowen: Yeat, so muche thereof am pryevie vnto, as (truste vnto yt) ys hable to move and bring anye honest harted man, to abhorre and myslyke all your licencious, lewde, and ouerstreached learning.
And yf you wyll knowe, howe cam vnto the knowlaige thereof: yt was by theym of your owne syde, of your owne sectes, counsaill, and profession, it was they which wroughte you this woe, vtterered you outerage, declared your cou~sailles, and betrayde the whole effecte of your vngodlye tryckes and noughtynes.
Now then, yf that vnto me (whoe sholde knowe least the fruicte of your long laboured for licencious libertie) suche and so muche of your disordered dealinges is made manifest and detected: how thinke you of others? how muche knoweth other men? what say you vnto those which dwell in the other parties of Englande? do not they likewyse perceaue the vnlaufull lyuing of your brethern there? yeas no dowbte.
For whether you goe or ryde, trauaill or reast, what co~panie soeuer you keepe, you shall here nothing but of the noughtynes of these newe Ministers.
All folkes will straight fall to complayne on the ryotte, ambicio~, auarice, and meere cruell desyre of Ministers.
so that yf you whiche be Ministers woulde trauayll by lande or by sea, your selves sholde surelie here your owne synfull trespasses all trulye tolde and vttered.
For, whereas sometimes men trauayling accustomed by telling of hystories and tales, to auoyde the wearinesse of theyr long wayes and iourney: in these dayes they haue none other newes, nor anye other historie, then the telling of the madde touches of Ministers, in so muche, that whether he be a childe, a yong man, of middle age, or aged: he is sure able to saye, that this Minister, or that Minister, hathe commytted thys vyle deede, or that, and one michiefeous facte, or an other.
Moue further to anye man the misfortune and calamitye of this present age, wherein, if wee co~fesse the trothe, we doe rather lynger then lyue, expresse the imperfection of men, complaine vpon the wante of vnitie and peace, sett furthe the fayle and decaye of charitie, honest loue, and true freindship, tell the vntrothe, vnfaythefulnes, and vncharitable shiftes now vsed, yea, bewraye the whole woe of thys wreached and vnfortunate tyme: And then yf you inquire for the cause of all suche our vncompfortable estate, yt wilbe aunswered, that this wrye wicked and false religion hathe fettered vs in the myddest of all these miseries, that these here there newe folyshe professed opinio~s haue imprisoned vs in suche sundrie puddells of painefull distresse, and that the newe fatched from Geneua faith hath mingled our quiete estate safetie, with these sought out sectes of warre, rebellion, schismes, sedicion, and disobedience.
Ys such therefore (o preachers) the credyte, which you haue purchased? and is suche the shamefull lowse lyfe, whiche your preaching vnperfecte maintayneth? Yea, yea, suche is the holynes of all your whole professed protestancie, and suche is the shame, which of necessytie must ensue and followe you for the same.
This your fayned religion is not yet full seauen yeares of age, and for all that, see what a defourmed babe alreadie it is, beholde what wickednes yt committeh, and marke what detestable doinges yt practyzeth. yt perswadeth the people against theyr Prince, the youthe against their parentes, seruantes against their superiours and maisters, one realme against an other, and whole Chrystendome against Christe.
But in thys, our made Ministers can reioyce and triumphe, tearming yt most vngodlye, to be the Ghospell: whereas in deede, there neaded no better argument to proue yt to be, as yt ys, high mynded pestiferous pleasante heresye: then the readynes of selfewill youthe, and delicate vnpainefull personnes to runne so rashelie to imbrace yt: for from labour vnto luste, from prayer vnto contempte and pryde, and from fasting vnto lowse libertie and feasting, wee see the peruerse nature of man to be ouer prone and reade.
remember the talke (as it is written) betwene Socrates the famous philosophier and Theodota the bewtiefull queane, she tolde hym that she was able at anye tyme to allure vnto her al his schollers stude~tes in philosophie: affirming, that Socrates colde not wythe all his learning, perswade anie one of her companions and louers vnto hym.
It is truthe, sayd Socrates, no meruail, seing thowe doest drawe theym in a downe hyll pathe into pleasure: and compell theym to clyme vnto vertue, wherevnto the waye and clyming is highe and full of difficultie in likewise what wonder is it, yf manie a thowsande doe nowe thicke and threefolde, fall from vertue the teaching of the Catholyke churche, into vice the verye whyrlepoole of the protestacio~ of heretykes? The Apostle of Chryste S. Pieter, dyd hym selfe long sythence, in most playne woordes expresse the same, saing: Superba enim vanitatis loquentes· pelliciunt in desideriis carnis luxuriae, eos qui paululum effugiunt, qui in errore conuersantur: libertatem illis promittentes, cùm ipsi serui sint corruptionis, &c. that ys to say, For when they haue spoken the swelling wordes of vanitie, they beguyle throughe wanto~nes, throughe the lustes of the fleashe, theym whiche were cleane eskaped: but now are wrapped in errours, they promyse theym libertie, and are theym selfes the bonde seruantes of corrupcion, &c.
So nowe in these later dayes, when yowe (which vsurpe preaching) haue prated and sett furthe your owne foolish and (as God doth knowe) inconstante fancies: the~ yowe prouoke and allure others into the selfe same pitte of deathe and damnacion: offering theym the like fruicion of the luste of the filthie fleashe.
And pro+mysing vnto Priestes, Moonkes, and manye others, whoe sometimes lyued in sinceritie godlines, an open gate into all vngodlie desire and vanitie: and that in suche wyse, as what poore Prieste soeuer dothe at this tyme lyue within the lurche of your iniunctions and tyra~nie, the same ys not compted honest zelous, nor earnest in faythe, onles he be clogged with a queane, to carie him all headlong into hell.
So that the poore man, which lyued of a long time in chastitie and perfection, is nowe compelled to compasse the loue of some light damosell, to leade with her a loytering detestable lyfe, and so to byd farewell vnto all his former faythe, promyse, and fidelitie.
Wherefore, may wee not most iustlie with Seneca saye? Vincit sanctos dira libido.
Forther, may wee not adiudge by this oure tyme, the sayng of Marcus Antoninus Emperour of the Romaines, to be all ryghtlie spoken for truthe? whoe alleaged it ouer harde for anye man, hauing immoderate libertie, to rule the brydell and rayne of his raging appetites and lustes.
But here some of yowe will saye, Why? and were not manie of the Priest yuell in the olde tyme? Admytte (yf anie to your knowelaige were) some so to be, and yet, that shall make nothing to mayntayne your noughtines.
For in those dayes to punishe suche lewde lyuers as yowe, there were streight and laudable lawes established, as the bookes thereof, yf you wolde impudentlie denye yt, can yet testifie.
So that feare then forced fowle lyfe to flye into corners, and to forsake the face of the strea+tes and howses: but nowe puritie of lyuing is cleane putte awaye, chastitie is shaken in sunder, the lawes to punish leacherie is layde vnder foote, vertue is cou~pted but a varlat, inco~tinencie is creapte vp and mayntayned in maried Moonkes, Priestes, and Ministers howses.
Also then the spiritualtie were spirituall and shamefast, now they be laye men and shameles.
Then they were learned and laudablie instructed in liberall sciences, nowe they are rude vnlearned, and for the most parte but poore labourers of handie craftes.
Then they were deuoute and diuines, but nowe they haue neyther deuocion nor di+uinitie.
Yowe your selfes (o Ministers) doe knowe, that the most parte of youe be onlie throughe meere pouertie thus compelled to putt your selfes so rashelie in these disordered orders, youe which haue consumed and riotouselie wasted your welthe and goodes, are nowe glad to professe a peruerse doctrine, thereby to drawe into some abilitie for to wade with the worlde agayne.
Yf that in anie paryshe (a pietiefull thing to heare) there was any pastthrifte and rashe mate which colde but reade, such an vnrulie runneagate is nowe, not onlye, in the churche a reader, but also (which thing passeth all impudencie) a preacher and a pulpitte possessor in the holye howse of God.
(I meane in the howse which once was holye, and rightlie reuerenced throughe out the Realme of England, but nowe defaced, and against all godlynes prophaned.)
knowe my selfe suche as, hauing forsaken theyr handieworke and former trade of lyuing, haue afterwardes laboured to reade, that then they might be Ministers, readers.
know theym who, hauing some skyll in reading, haue rashelie forsaken their maisters seruices, so that haue not onelye sought thus vnorderlie for orders, but also which haue obtayned the same.
know theym who, (being delyuered out of the Bushoppes pryson, and whose handes, before the temporall Iudge, of the yron and fyre haue sufficientlye fealte.) haue notwithstanding strayght passed into the next Diocesse, and there desyryng orders, were furthe with there charged with the cure charge of soules.
Agayne, yf you marke the yong sorte of newe made Ministers, you shall fynde in theym suche follye and pryde, suche wilfullnes and wantonnes, that woefull yt is to heare yt. they be in theyr attyre and apparaill so rooffed, welted, iagged and stytched, as meeter to be ministrels then of the ministery.
These doe no sooner attayne this one newe onelye order, but then busylie seeke they for some bassing gyrle to make vpp theyr newe godlynes: they labour so hardelie to gett theym a huswife, as be she good or bad, vertous or a varlat: they passe not, this is the ende of theyr studie, this is it which they seeke, and this is theyr summum bonum, theyr chiefe felicitie.
Seeke further, what your grauest fathers and newe named Bushop+pes haue bene, and you shall fynde, that they were the inferiour sorte of the whole cleargie, that they were for theyr learning meater to be compared with the laitie, then with the learned: that they were the most wantonne lyuers (as by theyr light, vnaduised, and vnluckie made maraiges appeareth) amo~gest the spiritualtie: that they were those, for who~ the whose clear+gie were accused of incontinencie, that they were but the riffe raffe amongest the religious: that they were but truantes in comparison of the true Catholyke teachers: that they were the verye worste of all those which professed Priestehoode sanctitie, and that they were but the verye Dregges of the Diuines and Doctors of our dayes.
Beholde of them some, who hauing lyued this long tyme without anie matching in mariage, doe nowe in theyr olde age fall to suche follye and doting, as theyr meere madde doinges must well declare, what kinde of fayth they seeke to maintayne, and also what maner of lyfe they heretofore haue leadde.
These be not of theyr simple sortes, for they be of theyr Bushopes, and they be of theyr newe godlie, deuoute, and (as the Protestantes can call theym) most graue fathers.
But is it grauitie for a Bushop with a graye bearde in his extreme age to waxe wanto~ne, and to wade in loue with a light mayde of his hoaste his kytchynne, with whom he hathe made suche hast to marye? shall not neede to trouble your with hys name, for the cyttie and countrey doe well knowe yt.
Yet, yf anye farre dweller hereof doe dowbte, let hym truste, that it is as true: as that BATHE and WELLES be within one Bushopryke.
Is it grauitie agayne for a man in yeares more the~ fowr+score, a man being a Preacher, and once aswell as the best a mocke Bushoppe, after the buryeng of his late bedfellowe wyfe, to fall to lasciuire of freshe, to seeke a yong woman to woe, and to marye one who for her yeares, were meter to be hys niece or mayde, then wyfe and mate? And is it also grauitie, for one taken to be the profoundest clearke of theyr companye, who lead hys lyfe hethervnto in studie, and (as some doe thinke) in chastitie, nowe hauing throughe heresie heaped to+gether great store of welthe in a Bushopryke, to be as busye in wantonnes as the best, to gett hym a yong dame to stande at his studie doore, and so in the myddest of his newe godlynes to marye? Is this a signe that they seeke for the Kingdome of God? dothe thys proue that they pray, fast, mourne, and lament for theyr offences? shall wee gather by this, that they be deuoute, holye, chaste, sighing, and sorowyng for theyre fynnes? No, no, for yf they dyd perfectlye eyther praye or faste, theyr myndes shold not be vpo~ suche lasci+uous madnes, and yf they dyd playe the parte of true Apostles, they colde not be lead so soone, by suche pestiferous mocions, from godlynes.
For wantonne Venus passeth not for the co~panie of mourners, she flyethe from the headdes which faste and praye, and she putteth no affiaunce in suche, who by weeping, sorrowe and heauynes of mynde, doe make so litle of the lustes of the fleashe as the true Ca+tholykes doe.
But on the other parte, co~cerning the fathers of this late framed faythe, yf yowe will aske what they do, then beleue the wordes of the Apostle, who of suche, saythe thus: They counte it plea+sure to lyue deliciouselye for a season, spot+tes they are and fylthynes lyuing at pleasure, and in disceaueable wayes, feastyng with yowe, hauing eyes full of aduoutrie and that can not cease to synne, beguyling vnstable soules. &c. Iudge thowe then, whether our Ministers be not they in dee+de, who~ S. Pieter in these woordes dothe plainelye paynte out and blame.
marke (as he tearmeth yt) the fylthynes and lyuing at pleasure of our preachers, vnderstande (as by experience thowe mayste) whether though he be neuer so olde, and readie to be receaued into hys graue, that yet he wolde greadelye goe into the worl+de agayne, a whyle to lyue with his loue and mate in most wantonne waye.
Suche is the perfection, that springeth from thys vnperfecte faythe, which theyr owne fan+cies, and none ells, hath nowe made and deuysed.
wold learne of them, and namelie of hym, whose laste maraige made mencion of, what shold nowe moue hym to marye? seing he draweth nere to fyftie yeares of age, and hathe euer vntill this tyme without a wyfe lyued (as men doe thinke) well inoughe: yet his late doinges doe declare some dowbte in the mat+ter.
doe vrge hym the more in this, for that his owne freindes haue founde faulte with hym for the same.
Lett hym therefor tell, what dyd rather moue hym nowe, the~ at other tymes heretofore, to fancie and make sute for a minion and sweete harte? Is it proper to his protestancie, or belonging to his Bushopryke? he will say, nay. what then? It was the spirite that moued hym.
spightefull spirite, cursed, detestable, and a most daungerous enemye vnto the best parte and porcion of man.
This spirite is he, which the Poêtes named Cupido, and yowe the Englishe Ministers will neades make it the spirite of God: but tell the people, of what God? of the God (as the Poëtes fayne) of fylthie luste, loue, and lothesome leacherie. of whome Seneca sayth thus: Deum esse amorem, turpiter vitio sauent, Finxit libido, quo{que} liberior foret, Titulum furori numinis falsi addidit.
Which hath this sence: God lewde loue to be, men fylthlye fauoure vice, Uyle lust dyd faygne that, he might me~ more intice Unto hys rage a title her, of false God dyd deuise.
With thys spirite an other of theyr captaynes was so chased, as no other remedie remayned, but neades he muste in the myddest of his new mysterie be maryed: of whom had LEVER leaue further to speake, then to trouble the reader with to manie of theyr rashe made maraiges.
But ys yt not more then maruayll (all theyr follye consydered) with what face these men dare professe anye perfection at all? may not therfore their impude~cie in pulpittes be wondered at? which promyseth the people healthe and saluation, yf they flye from the Catholykes, and followe theym.
Ah las, where shall they followe you but to the fyerye lake of hell? and where will you bring them but to the bottomeles pytte of dreadeful darkenes? these men wold haue vs to defye our forefathers, not to leade theyr lyfes, nor to walke in theyr vertue and godlynes: not ceasing in theyr prating sermones most vngodlye and vnnaturallye to saye, our fathers be in hell, our fathers be in hell.
Here ca~ not suffer, but must neade saye, you beastes vnnatural, why will you to your power deface our holye forefathers, who dyed in the faythe and true religion of Christ his Churche? why will you so peruerselye pronounce thys shameles sentence against so manie thowsandes of good men, of Christian vertous and godlye Kinges? of whome we may surelye with the Prophete saye: In te sperauerunt patres nostri: sperauerunt, liberasti eos.
Ad te clamauerunt, salui facti sunt: in te sperauerunt, non sunt confusi.
That ys, In thee haue our fathers trusted: in thee haue they hoped, and thowe hast delyuered them.
Vnto the haue they cryede, and they are made safe: in the they haue trusted, and are not co~founded.
reade, that noble Solon one of the. vij. wyse men of Grece, being on a tyme demaunded: why he had not established lawes, to punishe those which had beaten theyr fathers.
Because (saythe he) adiudged not anye suche to be, You may hereby see, howe that Solon thought yt impossible, that anye should be so pastgrace as hys father to beate or in anye wyse to greve.
But our newe noughtie false preachers will not sticke so to storme against theyr fathers: as from heaven (yf they colde) to hale theym downe, into the darke resteles doungeon of hel.
trowe, yf Solon were nowe lyving, he wolde surelye ordayne lawes, to punishe suche lewde vnnaturall personnes.
For is it not more then vnnatural and lewde, to alleage that their forefathers and oures, that the Sainctes, Martyres, and all holye men be holden in tormentes in hell? whiche thyng they be eyther dryven to affirme: or els to deface the chiefest poinctes of their new bastardlie paynted fayth.
For it is against theyr fancied faythe to mayntayne, that anie man dyeng in the belefe of the Catholyke churche (as all our forefathers haue done) can obtayne heaven, or anye saluacion of soule.
Wherefore (o Protestante) if anie pietie be planted in thy breast, thow wilte bewayle the miserie of so many, as these monstrous Ministers be rulers ouer, yf anye grace and mercy may move thee, thowe wilte all hartelie lame~t the loasse and danger, which the people of Christe be in, And also if there be but one iote of anye gentlenes or iustice in thyne harte, thowe wilte haue some indifferencie to deale withe and to iudge these thinges.
Playe therefore nowe the worthie parte of Pericles the noble and valiaunte Captayne of the Athenienses, vse here his iustice, and with hym saye, Oportet me amicis accommodare, sed vsque ad aras. say thow, must incline vnto my frendes, the Protestantes, saving my conscience.
Let nowe thy conscience cause in the some consideracion of honestie, and then no dowbte the pleasante pestiferous doctrine of heresye must needes displease thee: whiche doctrine the elder that yt ys, the more rotten and fylthie fruicte yt bearethe.
Yt ys a doctrine by the dyvel devised to snare and delude the corrupte companie of youthe and others, who willingelie wold walke in the overlarge, wicked, pleasaunte way of theyr most poysoned appetites.
For as Sathan sometymes on the highe mountayne and hyll toppe, dyd assaye to tempte our Sauiour Christe: saing, (after that he had shewed hym the whole dominion of the worlde) Haec omnia tibi dabo, si cadens adoraueris me, &c. that is, All these things will give the, if thow wilte falle downe and worshipp me, &c.
So now in this valey or dale of miserie, he mischievouselye with the lyke intycementes compasseth, also to tempte the Christians, saing: The pompe of the world, the freedome of the fleashe, riches, power, welthe, wyves, Bushopprykes, deanries, beneficies, and authoritie: al these thinges wil give you, if you imbrace and sett furthe my faythe, fancie, and co~maundementes: and yf you wil be my disciples, fall downe and worshippe mee.
Well, a great companie of good Cathokes have forsaken al these baytes, Bushop prykes, benefices, welthe and wyves, and they have sayd with our Sauiour Christ, Abi Sathana, auoyde Sathan.
But a fewe peruerse Englishe preachers, they wyll praye him to make that offer agayn, and then more heede shall they give vnto his woordes promyse.
Let vs heare more of thy mynde, and what thow woldest fayne have vs to fullfyl: so that at the leangth, with the sweete singing of Sirênes, they be soone drawe~ to performe the worke and desyre of the dyvel.
wicked man Minister: see what a foolishe marquete thow haste made, thow hast loaste by thys bargayne (without great repentance) the best substa~ce that thow hadst: And if thow wilt beleve the very wordes of Christe, then shalte thow sure finde yt to be so.
he sayth, Quid enim profuerit, &c. that ys, For what shall yt profyte a man, yf he sholde wynne all the whole worlde, and lowse hys owne soule? Nowe, what hast thowe gayned by this giwe gawe welth and pleasure of the worlde, if after a daye or twoe, thow must for euer in hel remayne with weeping and gnashing of teathe, where thy worme dyeth not, nor the fyre at anye tyme goethe out? And therfore, thow which lyest in the horrible lake of heresie, turne vnto God, and forsake thyne offences· let vs goe boldelye vnto the seate of grace, that wee may receaue mercie, and fynde grace to helpe in tyme of neade.
Thys is the malice nowe, (Ministers) that owe you: that wold wishe you, to putt awaye your iniquities, and crave pardon at the handes of God, for this your swarving fro~ the true fayth, that your soules may lyve, and that wee may then together enioye the gladsome light, and eternall reaste in heauen: ells, you shal herein earthe sustayne most wor+thye infamye and shame for your offences, and in hell a iuste plague and punishement for the same.
Here haue passed ouer briefelye some piece of your peruerse practize and beha+uiour, that the more to make you myn+defull of your vngodly estate and degree, wherin haue yeat vsed such modestie, as willinglye named not one of you.
but now this cometh last into my mynde, that manye of you beholding this booke, will bragginglie saye: If that he cold name vs, he wolde. hereat staye, and doe somewhat dowbte, whether it were best to begynne of newe or not, and of freashe to sett furthe your names, fylthie factes and dwellinges.
Well, you shall see that can doe it, and yeat will not: hoping that whe~ you haue forsaken this your fonde fayth, you may leade a godlie lyfe agayne.
But to preuent your bragg, you dryue me to vtter the doinges of one or twoe for example sake: whose proper names notwith+standyng will (according vnto my promysse) omitte.
There is one nowe a preacher, who, being maried, and his wyfe the~ in the towne fyue or six myles westwarde from London, was take~ neuertheles by a gentle ma~, with an other mans wyfe, and so brought before the iustice, who bou~de hym to appeare before M. Grindall, at whose handes he receaued none other pu+nishme~t, the~ to be banished out of his dio+cesse.
This perfect Preacher now dwelleth foure myles fro~ Windsor: where he hathe gotten for his excellent vertue a vicarage.
There is an other, who (according vnto the saing of Theodorus the Atheman) receaued diuinitie in his right hande: but which delyuereth it vnto the people againe with the leafte.
ca~ not well leaue out his name, yet am lothe to name hym.
But, inquire for the Archedeaco~ of West mynster, learne the cause of his departure thence, aske with what fauour the lawes went forwarde, whe~ he eskaped the carte, which he had deserued, for ventring lyke a Hardye man so farre with Venus.
Thus, being lothe further towade with your faul+tes, onles be by you pricked and co~pelled: wishe vnto yowe suche harte, as may hate all haynous pleasau~te heresies, vnto the people suche perfection and pure iud+geme~tes, as maye co~temne your vngodlie shameles sermones: wherein yow co~passe most craftelie to kyll slea theyr soules, And wishe finallie vnto vs all, perfecte vnitie, charitie, and true loue, that at the leangth wee maye like breathren lyue in the euerlasting ioye which neuer shall ende.

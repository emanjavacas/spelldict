as vve can vve shall yeild up to the kings pleasure all the lavvs vvhereby the rights and inheritances of the king and subjects ought to be distinguished and determined

truly sir these are edged tooles not to be played with would not come miles to put my neck in a noose
an honest old cavalire whispered tother day to me that he supposed this prorogation came from french counsels not only to prevent the parliament from stoping in time the french kings increase of povver at sea and land but to lead his majesty in obscure undifcerned paths to the mount of absolute povver
the french knovving too vvell that vvhensoever the english people shall discover their liberties and lavvs to be invaded such fires vvill be kindled as they may run avvay in the smoak and vveshall not be able to contest vvith them either the povver of the sea or the equallity of trade
but whosoever advised the prorogation pray sir let me know whether it be a dissolution
you may perhaps save me a scurvy winter journey and mony in my pocket and assure you we are all very poor and do not expect to be paid for secret serviec know you can resolve this question as well at least as my lord chancellor
if it be but a doubtful point should think had best stay at home none but an undoubted parliament being able lawfully to deside the case his majesty out of parliament is no competent judge for himself in this point and if we should declare our selves to be a parliament legally continued by the prorogation according to the kings will though not according to the lawes should tremble to be assistant in such a sad doom of england that the meeting of our parliament and the benefit of our laws are of the kings grace and not of right to be injoyed only when as he pleaseth
neither should think such a resolution to be of any authority because we should be parties and judges and give sentence to continve our selves in power

you must not sir deny me your whole thoughts of this great affair have come to parliament twice or thrice to provide

against the multitude of mischiefs and grievancs that threaten our ruine but did but verifie the proverb that came ninescore miles to suck a bull you know we have not been suffeerd to do anything of moment for several sessions but shall fool my self more if should now come miles to sit gravely and prepare my self for the gallowes when soever the subjects shall demand right against us or the crown shall descend to any whose interest shall lead him to call in question what we shall do

you know sir you and were confessors of old under his majesties father and narroly escaped being martyred for the protestant religion the lawes of the land and the priviledges of parliaments as we belived we carried as many of those declarations in our pockets as we had shillings of his coyning whilst we fought under his banner and should not sir be an impudent knave if should now come and sit in parliament to declare that his majesty may of right take away from his subjects the benefit of their principle fundamental laws about their meeting in parliament when and as long as he pleaseth and if he will never suffer a parliament to sit to claim one of the priviledges we swore to maintain
long for your opinion sir upon the whole matter would neither disobey any lawfull command of his majesty nor diminish the just english regall power
would not crop a leaf of any flower of the crown yet make as much conscience not to betray my country or easily yeeld up the antient lawes and government of england by parliament to the kings will to make english freemen tenants at will to the king of their lawes their parliaments their liberties and lives
am resolved to be an honest man and thy faithfull friend and hearty servant

the benchers answer

sir

you demand my opinion in a question of the greatest moment that ever was moved since england was established under civil goverment the absolute ruin for our age or the safety of all the ancient english liberties and excellent laws depend upon the right resolving your question
whether this parliament be actually dissovled by the last prorogation for months he that will clearly answer you ought first to consider whether a prorogation ordered and continued beyond a year can be made to agree with our lawes and statutes concerning holding of parliaments which by the way are the of english men it seemes you have been told of two statutes which enact that a parliament shall be holden every year doutbless they in ended those printed statutes of the
of ed
cap

and that of the
ed
cap

where it is enacted that for maintenance of the statutes and redress of divers mischiefs and grievances vvhich dayly happen a parliament shall be holden every year as an other time vvas ordayned
these are most taken notice of because they are printed and were by that notable act of the of the late king which provided effectually for the summoning and electing a parliament every year without the kings concurent asent if he neglected or refused two years together to summon a parliament according to those statutes of edvv
and although this parliament hath repealed that statute and taken from the people that meanes to secure their right of parliaments yet they have left us to the force of the antient laws in the case and in the same act of repeale car

they have declared and acknowleged those lawes of ed to be still the lawes and statutes of this realm and they have enacted no clause

or article that derogates from them or abates their force
those latter clauses of that act which seem to be enacting being as my brethren of the robe speak nugatory and insignificant only praying the king not to intermit the holding of parliaments above years at the most but to call them as often as there shall be occasion which in plainer english is an humble motion that he would not neglect his duty to put the laws in execution longer than two years but that he would call parliaments as oft as ocasion did require and that act was to commence from the end of this parliament what ever was intended by that act it doth neither weaken the force of those two antient printed statutes nor of any other unprinted for annual parliaments this act being only affirmative and consistent with the other
and ought to tell you that there are more at least to thesame porpose
that of the
ri
number
in the rolls relates to the jurisdicttive power of parliaments which is often very necessary as well as the legislative
it enacts that a parliament be yearly holden to redress delayes in suites and to end such cases as the judges doubt the
of ed
and
and the



and in the
ed

in the parliament called the good parliament the same thing was enacted and confirmed and in the opening the parliament in the
ric

the lord chancellor in shewing the causes of calling that parliament gives for the second reason of it that it vvas enasted that a parliament should be yearly holden
and the message sent from the parliament to the king in the
ric
by the duke of gloster tells that king that one old statute and laudable custom is approved vvhich no man can deny that the king once in a year do summon his high court of parliament there to consult vvith the vvise men and so you may read in grafton page

it seems the course of holding yearly parliaments then passed not only for statute law wherein that kings ancestors had joyned with his kingdom to ordain it but as the most undoubted custom of england that is the common law dedeclared

in and by the statutes they clayming it as their most unquestionable inheritance being the only root of all their liberties and properties and the only pollitick meanes of their defence and safeguard and no doubt our ancestors had reason sufficient to claime their yearly parliaments as the custom or common law of england seeing no antiquary nor record can shew the original of that usuage having its beginning with the government it self
certain times for parliament meeting are in truth of the essence of the english government parliaments were the first appointers or creators of all other offices jurisdictions powers and prerogatives in the government don wallo writing of the brittish lawes tells us of parliaments annuall or oftner amongst them above years before christ
and the mirror of justice tells us that king alfred ordained it for a perpetuall usuage that tvvice in the year or oftner they should assemble at london to treat in parliament of the government of the people
so it was in the saxon's time and continued in the normans being admitted by duke william called the conquerour as the custom of england as appears by that antient treatise called modus antiquus tenendo parliamenti and after great contest between the king of that race and the people it was setled by statutes often renewed that parliaments should be yearly as the statutes shew

upon the whole think it beyond dispute that by the laws and statutes of our realm a parliament ought to be holden every year and surely it is as certain that the last prorogation beyond a year being persisted in by the king till the year is past over did prevent and defeat the execution of those laws and is in direct opposition to them

the sence of what the lord chancellor said to prorogue the parliament was a plain contradiction to these laws
he tells them it vvas his majesties will that there should be no parliament holden for one vvhole year and some months next follovving
then the question will be if it be any whether the

king's will and word in the lavv or his word in the lord chancelor's mouth is most potent the whole kingdom in parliament and all the books of the law have alwayes judged the law to be the kings superiour to judge of the validity of all his grants orders commissions patents under great and little seal and every court in have always thought its authority sufficient to judge his grants under seal or any thing he hath done void if they did not agree with the law
tis a civility and honour that our laws pay to the king that they will not suppose him to will any thing otherwise than as the laws direct or allow him and thence it was received as a maxim that the king can do no vvrong indeed all he does contrary to law is doing nothing tis to be holden for nothing by magna charta it self therefore if the last prorogation do not agree with the laws it is a meer nullity

it is worth your remembring that in the chap of the great charter it is ordained that no king should devise or invent any thing to infringe or vveaken the liberties and lavvs
and if either king or subject should seek out any thing against them it should be of no value and holden for nought
if the prorogation were a device or trick sought out to weaken the laws for holding parliaments every year tis judged to be nought or no prorogation by or parliaments which have confirmed and the same charter

but ought to acquaint you that there are great endeavours to support the prorogation some alledging with noise enough that many kings have intermitted parliaments not only for more than a year but for many years but these seem not to understand the question which is of the validity in law of what the king hath done to the parliament
tis not now enquired what remedies there are if kings shall leave undone what the law and their trust require in calling parliaments all the positive exercises of power by the

king may and ought to be judicially sentenced and approved for good if agreeable to the laws or holden for none if they be contrary to the law
and this hath been the usuage of england in all ages they have sentenced all his charters grants yea his very pardons that seem to come so singly from his soveraign power or prerorogative and the prorogation ought upon the same reason to be tried by the law and judged void if so it be by the rules of the law
but the kings omission to put the laws in execution in calling parliaments at the times limitted by the statutes or in appointing sufficient guards for the seas or in issuing out commissions to the judges or any the like these say cannot be brought into question judicially there being no possible relief for the people in such cases but by supplimentary laws to be made in parliament in case of such omissions as was done by the parliament
tis well for the people that the law hath provided that whatever the king shall do contrary to law shall go for nought though they suffer by his neglect their right and laws remain to them and such omissions of the king as are before mentioned have alwayes been esteemed by parliaments and people failers or breaches of the kings high and sacred trust and tis a pittiful argument to prove that the kings might of right or by the laws omit to do what the law hath trusted to their care because they have sometimes broke their trust

his late majesty in his declaration of the of august when the unhappy war began to rage freely confessed

that it was upon his prospect the unhappy state of the kingdom and of the inconveniencies and mischiefs that had grown by the long intermission of parliaments and by the parting too much from the known rule of the law to an arbitrary power that induced him to consent freely to that act in called vulgarly the triennal act which was in truth for annual parliaments

those very acts of edvv
before mentioned
he said he was willing in justice and favour to his subjects to make them reparations for their sufferings they had undergon by him in omitting parliaments

remember this chiefly to shew that his late majesty when his subjects were in arms against him freely acknowledged the wrong he had formerly done them by failing to summon parliaments as the law required and professed that he had the year before freely and heartily consented to that act which those antient laws of edvv
which are conceived amongst others to make the prorogation void
yet must tell you there are those that affirm all the laws for annual parliaments to be musty absolete statutes vvhose strength and life are devoured by time but it is enough to stop their mouthes that they have been declared by two parliaments within years last past to be the laws of our realm and indeed they are laws of such a nature as cannot be weakened by any neglect of their due execution being declarative of the common law and a most essential part of the constitution of the english government which altogether lives and subsists in and by the certainty of parliaments meeting
if it were admitted for truth that neither the nor the statutes did indispensably oblige the calling of parliaments at any certain times but that their meetings were only at the wills of the kings then the kings did no wrong if they commanded the people as was once done in a kingdom by proclamation never to mention parliaments more
if these laws be dead of age the antient famous is dead with them the english must never more claim the name of a free people if they have no share by right in the government of themselves by their certain rightful times of parliaments
but my lord cook part
of instit pag
concludes rightly that no act of prlaiament can loose its force or be antiquated by non user unless the reason of it fail and the use of it is impossible and by

change of time becomes a publick mischief but not those especially vvhich are made to bind the kings themselves for the common good for such are the lavvs for parliaments
yet he that observes in our english law books and histories in the time of king john hen
ed
and ed
how the nobles and claimed their right by the common law to meet in parliament before these statutes were made and how often they compelled their kings do not say how lawfull such compulsion was when need required to call parliaments and if he observes also how constant these statutes for annual parliaments were executed in many whole kings reigns succeeding each other next after their making and if he considers how slowly and slily this grand right of the peoples was invaded and stolen upon in latter ages he will have little reason to pretend a non user of those statutes yet if some neglects and defaults have been committed against the laws it concerns his majesty in conscience and the people in interest much more not to permit it hereafter least patient sufferánce of the wrong become an argument against the peoples right

pray sir read the sense of our ancestors upon the kings neglect of executing a law against the pope whom they then adored tis the statute of provisors of the of ed
these are the words the king seeing the dammages and mischiefs before mentioned and having regard to the said statute
which statute holdeth its force and was never defeated repealed nor annull'd and by so much he is bounden by his oath to cause the same to be kept as the law of the realm though that by sufferance and negligence it hath been sithence attempted to the contrary

truly sir these seem to be honest plain old english words and if the statutes about parliaments were put in the front or preface they would sound well from his majesties mouth in a nevv statute
but some there are sir who find softer cushons in a parliament seat than you do who to avoid

the nullity of the prorogation assert that the statutes for yearly parliaments may be dispenced vvith by the kings soveraign povver and prerogative being say they only councils and advices to the king and not obligatory

this is boldly said if it could be as soundly proved it would put all questions between the king and his subjects to everlasting silence if he can legally or of right dispence or absolve himself from all the bonds of the law for holding parliaments by whom the lawes are to be maintained and the highest transgressors punished he may dispence with the lawes whereby all other courts sit and then he is loose from all lawes and nothing of right can be claimed of him by the subject
to dispute with statutes of this nature by the king without limitation of time or other rule than his will is the same in other words as to repeale or anull these statutes and revive them again when he pleaseth and that is to asume to the crown singly the legislative power which consists as much in anulling as in making lawes
and if that be the kings rightfull power then all the laws are absolutely dependant upon the will of the king
have read that an attempt of the same kind was made by king rich

in setting up a phantatick opinion as the parliament then called it saying that the lawes of the realm were in his head and in his breast but it cost the people very dear both in blood and treasure to confute it and the poor king lost his crown and life for that fancy
will not trouble you or my self with the common yet dangerous doctrine of my tribe about the kings power to dispence with penall lawes by his non obstante am only to inquire in this case what dispensing power the king hath over the statutes made and declared only to bind and limit the kings themselves in the execution of their trust about the government such as are in their prime true intent sacred pacts or arguments between the king and people though in honuor to the king there could not be aded to them the sanction of a penalty upon the king

judicialy
these statutes that now discourse of are the foundations of our government and declarative only shewing what our government is that is by king and parliament and how far the crown is trusted with the power of caling parliaments that is as often as there should be ocasion within every year and not otherwise
our government was never originally founded upon such rediculous folly by our wise ancestars as to intend themselves to be a free people to make and alter their own lawes for their government with their kings and he to call them to parliament to that intent and to leave it absolvtely to the kings will even lawfully or of right by their fundamental laws to defeat their meeting in parliament for ever
if our government were so founded and doth so continue our english crown is of right or by law in no kind restrained limitted or bounded in the exercise of the regal power unless it please and if the kings shall condescend to consult with parliaments and agree to some statutes to limit themselves there is no more done than was by the men of gotham that made a hedge for the coockows

these reasons sir are not urged to shew any defects in our government which may or ought to be amended but to prove that our government was founded upon such certain laws and customs that the kings never had absolute power but that the power of parliaments and their certain meetings were of right and as much a part of our government as the kings themselves
and think it self evident from the nature and manner of the english government owned in all ages to be quallified by laws binding both king and people that the king cannot more dispence with the laws which limit the times wherein parliaments ought to be holden than with the laws that preserve our lives and estates from being subject to this will
parliaments are of the essence of our government and must have the times of their assembling indispensible and if it be not of right by

law that they are to be held within cercain circles of time as custom and law have appointed then there's no necessity in law that they should be held at any time if the king please and by consequence they are none of the essentials of our government but the government may be without them
if the kings may of right dispence with the times appointed for holding parliaments they may break all the bonds of other laws no other power daring to question them all but parliaments deriving their power from them
charles the seventh and levvis the eleventh of france first subverted the liberty of the french and all their antient customs and laws by usurping that pretended prerogative of dispensing with the certain times of the meetings of their assembly of estates by that means they suffered them to meet very seldom and their immediate successors proceeded to arrogate to themselves more power over those assemblies untill they have in fact perhaps not in right abolished almost the memory of them and reduced the people to a miserable slavery the people having no other fence of their liberty
dear sir to deal plainly believe the opinion that the king might dispence with parliaments meeting notwithstanding the statutes or prorogue them as long as he pleaseth is built upon that gross vulgar error that parliaments are the creatures of the kings will because they are summoned by his writs and dissolved also vvhen he thinks sit

wish our government were better understood both by our lords and commons they ought to know that the writts of summons for a parliament once a year are to be issued by the king in obedience to the laws and if there be occasion for calling them oftener the writts issue in performance of the kings trust and oath to remove by parliaments the mischiefs that afflict the people

the statute of provisors edvv
speakes this plainly viz
the commons pray the king that sith the right of the crovvn of england and the lavv of the said realm is such that

upon the mischiefs and dammages vvhich happen to his realm he ought and is bound by his oath vvith the accord of his people in parliament thereof to make remedy and lavv
this king and people agreed that it was the english constitution and kings duty to call parliaments as the lawes required and if any mischiefes happened he was bound by his oath then to call them and to joyne in accord with them to remove the mischiefs and dammages before they were dissolved else by the declaration in this law he saved not his oath by calling them
and as the law binds the king upon oath to send out the summons for parliaments so it provides the very form of the vvrit which must be sent the king must summon them in no other form than the law hath appointed the law hath not trusted the king to adde to leave out or alter one word in the writ of summons an act of parliament only can vary one tittle of it
the law hath also prescribed to parliaments their business in general which are the matters that concern the king the state and the defence of the realm
these are words so large that there seemes to be nothing that concerns the wellfare of king or people which doth not fall under their consultations
but pray sir observe that tis not the kings will that impowers your brethren that's no more than a command of the law by the king ex officio that the people do impower such as they elect they are to authorize them as the writ declares to do and consent to what shall by the common council of the kingdom be then ordained ita quod saith the vvrit pro defestu potestatis hujusmodi
so that for want of such power the foresaid business may not remain undone
the parliament derives not any power from his majesty but from the first root of government the peoples choyce according to the laws for that reason indentures are and ought to be sealed between the people and the elected and then they are immediately invested with a share of the legislative power for that time which is the greatest and highest

power and therefore in its own nature independent every estate having share in the legislative power for the proportion it hath therein hath its independency of the other two and of its proper right as founded in the fabrick and fram of the policy and government not derived from the grace of the king by grant or commission
have said too much doubt against the power of the king to despense with the statutes for yearly parliaments and yet must adde this one thing more that parliaments are by many statutes as well as by the common law our highest court of judicature before whom comes writts of error and the last appeales in all cases
and that ancient mirror of justice tells us that their judicature was intended to hear and determine the complaints of the wrongfull acts of the king the queen and their children and of those persons against whom the subjects otherwise could not have common justice now if the king can of right dispence with the certain appointed sitting of this judicature he can lawfully say the wrongs that and my great ministers too bigg for other courts shall do to the people shall never be heard or judged but at my will their complaints shall not be admitted once in
years nor till domes day unless please

if our men of the robe will maintain such a dispensing power in the king with the statutes in question they must say that the king may by law prevent and defeat the last results of justice and null the highest court of judicature founded on the common law and let them tell me why he may not by the same right and reason despence with the lawes whereby all the inferior courts of judicature now fits or adnull the courts themselves and throw all things into a confused chaos where the strongest shall injoy every thing upon these premises may dare to conclude that the laws for holding a parliament every year stand firm and immutable untill an undobted parliament shall repeale them by some express words and that the prorogation can

never be reconciled to those lawes or be helped by any power of the kings to despence with them but must be judged inconsistent with the lawes that are of the essence of our government having actually defeated the execution of them and therefore ought to be holden for nothing and the day appointed for your meeting to be no day for that purpose in the sence of our law

supposing then that having hitherto rightly concluded the question will be whether the kings dismission of the parliament without any day set for their return and their continuing so beyond the year be a dissolution ill tell you sir the method of my thoughts upon this question that might not be couzened with words nor intangled in trifling disputes about them first consider whether dissolving a parliament were a term of art in our law and ought to have some peculir sence gained by the use of it in the law but finding it used only in its vuilgar sence
perceived it signified to break off or put an end to a parliament and all their business and authority so that a dissolution may be made without the king or lord chancellors saying you are hereby dissolved the force of the law or custom of england may put an end to a parliament
of old the finishing the business of the people for which they were called did dissolve them
see the ancient modus tenendi parliamt
the custom was that when all the petitions for relief against grievances were dispacthed proclamation was made demanding if any petition were yet unanswered and if there was none the parliament forth with departed this was the naturall death or dissolution of a parliament but if the king did command the lords and commons to depart before they had suffitiently consulted about the state and defence of the king and kingdom and set for their return that was the voilent death of a parliament and doubt a violence to the kings conscience

but it was usuall for the kings to dissolve parliaments either by leave or command given them to depart fixing no day for their return so testify the antient rolls of the
ed

and
ed

ed


ed


tis by force of law that the writ of sumons to parliament abates or becomes void by the kings naturall death and the parliament is thereby dissolved
upon the same reason a failer of some circumstance as the naming such a time as the law allowes to which it is adjourned the holding and continuing a parliament if judged necessary by the law for preserving both the form and substance of the government say such a fayler in time onely may by act of law dissolve a parliament even against the will of the king and if such a failer happens if the king should step out of the form of the law to revive a parliament it would alter the whole government by owning a power in the king to vest in such as he please the legislative power out of the form of the law
in making a parliament the king hath his power from the law to summons and the form wherein only he can exert that power and the elected have their power from the people by the writ of the law what to do and consent to on their behalf at the time and place then mentioned as the writ says tunc jbidem and these powers must by the law be strictly and punctually persued and nothing less than an act of parliament can help any defect or failer in persuance of these powers if the parliament then meet as the law requires if they fayl to be continued in the form of the law then by the act of law they are dissolved not being able to create to them selves a day or time which will not agree with the returnes to the writ of summons by which their masters impowred them to consent on their behalf
neither is this a nicety or quirk in law but a form essentialy necessary to preserve our liberties
if the representatives trusted for the people to do and consent for them at the time and place mentioned in the lawfull writ after a fayler of continving

their trust as the law directs pceede to act as a parliament they must do it without any appointment or power given them from the people in any form of law and in the appearance and judgment of the law without any authoritie and if they might do it after fayler of a legall continuance one year they may do it after years and because they were once commissioned by the people to represent them in one parliament they should therefore make themselves lords of the people and of their laws lives and liberties for ever and admit whom they please as some have done heretofore into their society and if it should be admitted that any number of men might exercise a share of the legislative power without evidence in law upon record that they were thereunto first sufficiently authorized and therein legally continued it would give a fatall stroak to the antient english government and all its lawes and liberties sir from these principles tell you freely my opinion that the parliament is dissolved having been dismissed or commanded to depart without a day to return within the time that the laws require a parliament to be holden and that time also lapsed since their dismission think it not material in the case what words the lord chancellor said when he dismissed them if he said you are prorogued or you are dismissed or you are sent home or you must be gon tis all one mind what was really done you were in substance and sence of the words commanded to dissolve your assembly and you were told that all the business before you was at an end as if it had not been and that you must not assemble again or hold parliament for above a year then following and you did separate your selves and never held parliament within the year and this by the act and judgment of the law hath dissolved you there hath been a failer of any such act in law as could continue you in the commission and authority whereunto the people hath chosen you in the form that the laws hath prescribed the king declaring under the name of proroguing

you that all the you had begun should be void and that you should not meet in parliament the next insuing year as the law required say that declartion of the kings could not in any construction of law be an act of continuance of your power and commission you had from the people the execution whereof was thereby wholly defeated likewise there was no act of your own by adjournment of your house to continue you and therefore your authority was wholly superseded and discontinued
know nothing that can be pretended to prevent your discontinuance but the kings will that you should sit again months after the year expired but his prevention of your sitting for above a year having contrary to the law and his trust first discontinved you his will cannot give or renew those parliamentary powers that the people gave you in return of the legall writ the lord cooke sayth
part
instis
chap
parl if you sit again you are a severall parliament from vvhat you vvere if you be a parliament every distinct session being in lavv a severall parliament
and your former authorities being ceased by a failer of continuance you can have none but what the kings will vest in you and need not tell you that the king cannot chuse for the people their representatives
to me it seemes playn that the king having not continued you nor you continued your selves nor having set or held parliament for above a year the law hath dissolved you and judged you for none

have not time to write you all the talks of the town upon this question some have invented a new fashion prorogation for the king to prorogue without day and call the parliament again by proclamation but their mouths must be stopped if they be only told that such a practise or use of prorogation hath no foundation in any statute custome usage or reason of law and the king cannot change the lawes and customes or introduce new
take a prorogation sine die if any such be made to be as void in law as a writ of

summons of a parliament would be that named no day for their sitting

and there can be no pretence of antiquity for such prorogations the words of adjornment and prorogation having been used in differently for the same thing about
years if not more they were so taken in the state of


and how long after cannot find but it would have been a plain contradiction in termes to have said then the parliament is adjorned sine die that is it was appointed to meet at another day without a day
its a sign that men are sore pinched when they will assert contradictions rather then submit to truth

ought to tell you one thing more that is said in this case they pretend a president that the king hath prorogued above a year they say that in the great plague in the
of eli that parliament was prorogued for a year and three dayes what then say they therefore the king might do it now
such arguers shew themselves pittifull logitians lavvyers and degenerate english men is it a logicall arguments to say that what ever any king of england hath once or oftner done may be lawfully done by any other king
an english king rich

by pretence of royall authority cut many a worthy mans throat and murdered his unkle the duke of gloster
an other king iohn sold this kingdom to the pope may it therefore be lawfully sold and have any lawyers learned so little as not to know that there is no president to be alledged against an express statute or not to know a transgression of a statute even by the king if silently passed over and never brought into judgment is not in the meaning of the law to be called apresident
theres no use of presidents unless it be to shew the usage where there is no statute in the case or to serve the construction of a statute where the meaning is doubtfull but where so many statutes are plaine and express as in this case tis in vain to alledge what hath been done and connived at without questioning it as

a president to warrant the present breach of those statutes· or rather to anull them forever
and they must also as much degenerate from english men as from logick and lavv who shall assert that the kings of england may acquire a right or power to themselves and their successors for ever by their ancestors transgressing any statute made to bound the regall power

all true english have alwayes maintained with their blood that our kings were limmitted by the laws and that they broke their oaths if they did not carefully see to the execution of them
and in dayes of yore they have been so far from allowing the son and succesor of a king to break any of the laws because his father did so before him they have rejected the father because he kept not within the limmits of the law and taken the son upon his promise not to walk by his fathers example

sir have told you my thoughts upon the question being satisfied that the kings will being declared upon record that you should not hold parliament within the time limmited by law you were thereby dissolved and the authorities given you by the people did thereby cease and return into the people and the kings will that you should afterwards hold parliament again being not agreeable to law could not revive your power
and in my poor opinion if you now assume to your selves to exercise parliamentary powers becaus the king will have it so you must pass this fatall judgment against the old english government that the king may lawfully prorouge you for
years if he please and may refuse for ever to hold a parliament and if such a judgment seemingly passed in parliament against our fundamentall lawes and liberties shall ever be left to the interpretation of any successors to our gracious king who shall intend a tyranny he shall claim by that record to be our absolute master and neither lords nor commons to have any right to provide in common counsel for the defence of the realm and their

own good government and wellfare unless be please

in fine our innocent babes shall hereafter read in that record that you judged your selves and them to be perfect slaves all prostitute to the will of the king
doubtless if it be granted that the people have no right to parliaments but at the kings will we shall never have any king after this that will tell us as king iames did in his speech to the parliament held march

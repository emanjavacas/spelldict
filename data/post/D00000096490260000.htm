to sir edmund turnor kt

sir

as by manifold great favours you have a right to all the services am capable of paying you you have yet a more peculiar one to the dedication of this sermon in that it was first preached and is now published by your commands
this hope will in part excuse me to the world for troubling it with so plain a discourse and the pious cogent reason with which you was pleased to enforce your commands cannot doubt will do the rest viz
that you might thereby have copies of it for those several parishes where your exemplary piety hath effectually provided for the daily performance of publick prayer
whilst sir your pious zeal thus worthily encourages and promotes the service of god of which could give many and great instances but that well know your singular humility will not permit me could not think ought not decline any thing in my power which in your opinion may contribute something tho but a little to so excellent an end

if this plain discourse adapted to a plain but honest people may by the blessing of god work

upon any such a greater reverence for the houses of prayer and a greater diligence and seriousness in frequenting them shall not regard what opinion the nice and censorious may have of it or of me for publishing it
my first aim therein being to promote the honor of our lord the interest of our religion and the good of souls and a secondary sir to testifie to the world my ready obedience and great obligations to your self
in a deep sense of which and the much good you daily do must ever pray as am sure great numbers are obliged that it may please god long to continue so great a blessing as you are to our religion to our church to the worthy clergy of it to your family to the poor to your friends even to all who are any ways deserving and capable of receiving advantage from such a fountain of exemplary piety true goodness and diffusive charity and that in the other world you may largely receive a glorious recompence for all the good you have so liberally done in this particularly to

honoured sir your most obliged and most faithful humble servant iohn adamson

epigraph st matthew xxi part of the
verse
my house shall be called the house of prayer

these words represent unto us our blessed saviour restoring the temple of god to the holy uses to which it had been dedicated and express his zeal for the honour due to such places and his just indignation against all prophanations and abuses of them

the temple at ierusalem was solemnly dedicated to the service and worship of god a practice which has obtain'd in all the ages of christianity at leastwise ever since the reign of constantine as eusebius acquaints us

in reference to our churches and places of religious worship

but the corrupt priests amongst the jews had grosly perverted it to other purposes subservient to their carnal and secular designs
the occasion which they took for so doing was this against the feast of the passover the jews from all countries resorted to ierusalem to keep that solemn feast there
to supply them with sacrifices which many of them who came from far could not possibly bring with them a great number of cattle were slain for that purpose by the priests

which they sold to the rich no doubt at a great advantage and for the poorer sort of people they provided as the law directed turtle doves and young pidgeons
and because many strangers could not be provided with those half shekels in value about of english coin which by the law were required to be yearly offer'd

nor with smaller pieces of mony to make their payments for those sacrifices which they wanted they therefore set up to supply them in both cases by way of exchange either for other money or with the poorer sort of people for other things in lieu of money

but in doing this they used great exaction and are therefore sharply rebuked by our saviour in the words following the text under that hainous character of a den of thieves and so they plainly appear guilty of a double crime prophaning the temple by their merchandize and grinding the poor by their oppression

of these their wicked practices they had long before been admonished by the prophets

and by our blessed saviour himself soon after his entrance upon his prophetick office and that in a very mild and gentle manner

take these things hence make not my father's house an house of merchandize
but still they persisted in their wickedness as even christians too often do against all admonitions and perswasions to the contrary and therefore in this place of the text our blessed saviour a little before his death finding them incorrigible under more gentle methods he as he was the son of that god whose temple was thus prophaned and in a just zeal for the honour of his

father

cast the buyers and sellers out of the temple overthrew the tables of the and the seats of them that sold doves reminding them of what before they had often heard but now either had forgotten or else wilfully neglected in the words of the text my house shall be called shall be according to the frequent signification of that phrase in holy scripture

a house of prayer

but how could this be may some say a single person despised rejected and probably designed by them in a few days to be crucified be able to drive out so great a number of obstinate men backed by the powers then in being wedded to their interest and much exasperated to see it so obstructed and defeated by the so much by them vilified jesus whence was it that none of them had courage enough to resist him or so much as open a mouth as far as appears to us in their justification but tamely submitted to his rebuke and suffer'd themselves to be driven out this must be resolv'd into the divine power of our lord and was one of the miraculous effects of it
such a majesty at that time appeared in his countenance and such an awe and dread it wrought upon his most spiteful adversaries as brought them to an absolute complyance with his will and perfect submission to his commands

which shews how utterly unable the most daring sinners are to withstand our lord when he comes in good earnest as sometime he certainly will to execute vengeance upon them
none of them durst oppose one word when our blessed lord

with an authority becoming his station and his zeal for his father's honour urg'd upon them the words of the text my house shall be called or shall be the house of prayer

having as briefly as well could shewn you the occasion and design of these words every one will easily discern that they instruct us in this great truth that places dedicated to god and his worship are to be treated with reverence and not to be employ'd in any prophane or common uses but only in religious duties particularly that of prayer which is the principal of them so has god declared by his prophet isaiah

and so our blessed saviour from him in the text my house shall be called the house of prayer
prayer is the duty which god in the old testament and our blessed saviour in the new were pleased to make choice of to represent the others by which are to be performed in places set apart for religious worship
and prayer is the especial duty for the performance of which the place this day consecrated was erected by your pious benefactor and therefore of this duty only shall discourse unto you at this time
and here might usefully enlarge on the more general parts of prayer as
supplication when we ask of god any blessing we want either for our souls or bodies

intercession when we pray for others even all mankind but more especially for our governours and the houshold of faith


thanksgiving when we recount with grateful hearts the many blessings both spiritual and temporal which we enjoy give god the glory of them and our selves to him in gratitude for them

all these general parts of prayer we are directed to by the apostle

and are all of them sufficiently provided for in our excellent liturgy which highly recommends it to our great esteem and constant use

might also seasonably enlarge on the most needful and yet too commonly neglected qualifications of prayer as


purity and holiness since we know that god heareth not sinners

wilful and impenitent ones that the apostle requires that when we pray we lift up holy hands

and that the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the lord but the prayer of the upright is his delight


serious attention to our prayers for then only we can be said to pray and then only expect to be heard inasmuch as our blessed saviour has set the mark of hypocrisie upon such prayers as are not accompanied with the heart and plainly tells us they are all in vain matth


ye hypocrites ye draw nigh unto me with your mouth and honour me with your lips but your heart is far from me but in vain do you worship me


fervour and earnestness with all the affection and devotion of our souls such as may testifie we really desire the things we pray for

this is required of us by the apostle that we be fervent in spirit serving the lord

this is that which makes our prayers very prevalent with god iames

the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much
even amongst the jews the talmudists taxing the peoples negligence in prayer one of the three faulty sorts of their amen recounted by them is a faint amen

when they pray'd without fervency


humility both in our souls and bodies
in our souls acknowledging our unworthiness to appear before so great a majesty to receive from him any of those blessings we ask but only upon the account of his bounty and mercy and the merits of his son
and humility in our bodies expressing this humility of our souls putting up our petitions to the majesty of heaven for the greatest blessings we can receive upon our knees according to the example of holy men in scripture

of the blessed apostles

and even of christ himself who kneeled down when he pray'd to his heavenly father st luke

accordingly we read of the primitive christians that to sit at prayers was ever held by them a posture of great rudeness and irreverence


and tertullian falls heavy upon some that used it in his time about two hundred years after christ telling them they acted contrary to scripture

and were irreligious in so doing and represents them as if they had a mind to reproach god to his face and tell him that they are weary of the duty of praying to him

if it be an irrevent thing as he goes on in arguing with them to sit down before one

for whom thou hast a great reverence and veneration how much more does it savour of irreligion to do so in the presence of the living god even while the angel is yet standing by thee to carry up the prayer to heaven

these together with a true faith and a dependance upon the alone merits of christ which presume need not mention in this place are the chief of those qualifications and yet too commonly neglected with which we must take care we put up our prayers to god if we hope to have them accepted by him and these might usefully have enlarg'd upon
but it must suffice thus briefly to have hinted them that may the more largely recommend unto you

in the fifth place frequency in this duty of prayer and that in publick as often as you have opportunities as you of this place will now daily have
this would earnestly recommend to your serious practice upon these three accounts
in that


it is much for the honour of god and our religion
ii
very advantageous to our selves in reference to this world
iii
it greatly promotes a good life in reference to the happiness of the next in all those that sincerely make use of it


we ought to be frequent in this duty of publick prayer because it is much for the honour of god and our religion
as often as we pray unto him with seriousness we acknowledge and

adore the soveraignty wisdom justice and power and mercy of god and in doing all this we must needs be granted to honour him and perform a service highly acceptable to him

when we pray unto him we evidently declare that we own his dominion over us and that he has a right to govern us and that all our services are his due tho we too often unworthily alienate them to prophane and wicked purposes
we also acknowledge his wisdom to be infinite that as he throughly understands all the actions of our lives and secrets of our hearts all our wants and necessities so he best knows how to make the most suitable provision for them
we likewise hereby magnifie the justice of god particularly in our confessions and deprecations knowing him ready to pass an impartial sentence upon us for our sins
again in all our prayers to god we must be supposed to acknowledge his power to be infinitely great to punish our sins to reward our welldoing and to supply all our wants

lastly we hereby acknowledge the mercy of god to be infinite without a great sense of which it would be both folly and arrogancy for us to approach unto him particularly to lay open before him all the miscarriages of our life which generally tis to be fear'd are so many and so heinous that we could never hope for any pardon to them but that we believe god to be very ready to embrace every true repenting sinner
this should strongly engage us to frequency in our prayers which you see do so much magnifie the glorious attributes of god which he loves

to see acknowledg'd by the sons of men
and surely the more publick this acknowledgment is the more honour it gives to god and is consequently the more acceptable to him

so very acceptable to him is this duty of pubblick prayer that when david had but a thought to build an house for this purpose god told him that he did well even when he had done nothing neither might do any thing only had the design of doing it in his heart and purpose

the like gracious
acceptance of such acts of piety our blessed saviour himself assures us of under the gospel in that he was effectually prevailed with to heal the servant of the centurion being recommended to him under this character that he had built them a synagoguge

a place for the better conveniency of their religious worship

may this chapel this day consecrated to the like use and for the same reason find the like gracious acceptance with our lord

tis also much for the honour of our religion and tends to gain proselytes to it which also is another way of giving honour to god
this is so universally acknowledged that even all religions however false or superstitious will have their daily publick offices thus it is amongst the jews mahometans and papists
and is not this a great reproach to us whose worship is much more pure to fall so very short of them in the exercise of it where is our zeal

for the honour of our excellent religion to suffer them so much to us in the frequency of religious offices which gains a mighty reputation to them but casts a reproach upon us


frequency in publick prayers is very advantageous to our selves in reference to this world being the likeliest way to obtain any blessings we desire or stand in need of either for our selves or others

st iames tells us

that the single prayer of a righteous man availeth much and gives us a proof of it in

elias by this means shutting and opening heaven first against and then for rain
and if prayer be thus powerful when single what is it when social when in publick in a whole congregation in a whole nation when there is a pious conspiracy of fervent prayers from consenting hearts and concurring lips all at once making as it were an assault upon the almighty with the holy violence of a strong importunity to extort a blessing from him
god delights to be thus wrestled with and is not able because not willing to deny any thing convenient for his people that is thus requested of him

thus speaks tertullian

coimus ad deum quasi manu facta precationibus ambiamns haec vis deo grata est

we come says he by troops to the place of assembly that being banded as it were together into an army we may besiege god with our prayers and petitions this

kind of violence is very pleasing and grateful to him

our saviour himself saith

if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven
hereupon

st ignatius argues if the prayer of one or two be of so great prevalence how much more will the prayer of the whole church be prevalent
and no wonder is it that they should be so when they have one amongst them concurring with them in their petitions whom god always hears even his only son the lord jesus christ

and indeed his presence with them himself assigns for the reason of their prevalency with his father for says he where two or three are gathered together in my name there am in the midst of them



and as publick prayer is thus advantageous to us in respect to our personal wants so is it no less in respect to the community to the church of god to our governours to our relations and friends even to all mankind for whom our excellent liturgy has furnish'd us with suitable prayers even for all sorts and conditions of men
hic sc deus bellum lachrymosum hic miser am famam pestem{que a populo principe caesare vestrà motus agetprece
horat
od

which prayers when a whole nation about the same time and in the same words of our liturgy duely puts up to god in the name of his dear son surely they may expect to prevail much more than when put up by single persons in private especially if we add god's gracious promise to hear those prayers more especially which are made to him in his own house in chron


the lord appeared to solomon and said unto him have chosen this place to my self for an house of sacrifice now mine eyes shall be open and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place
for now have chosen and sanctified this house that my name may be there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually


frequency in publick prayer greatly promotes a good life in all those that sincerely make use of it
and that both by it's natural tendency and by the blessing of god


by it's natural tendency
can men that consider any thing daily confess their sins unto god in his own house and in the presence of the holy angels and a publick congregation and yet dare to continue in them and boldly commit them again at the next temptation can such easily there daily pray as we do in our excellent liturgy that they may hereafter live a godly righteous and sober life and yet allow themselves in gross acts of impiety against god in deliberate acts of injustice or oppression against man or in the heinous acts of intemperance

and uncleanness so directly opposite to that sobriety they daily pray for and thereby acknowledge they ought to practice or in any other notorious scandalous sin

can it be imagin'd that when they so frequently repeat that pious petition with their own lips their consciences should not sometimes nay often severely rebuke them for such gross violations of it and give an effectual check to such practices which the customary neglecters of publick prayer easily may and too often do pursue without any sense of their guilt or danger
further by daily reading or hearing read at the publick service of our church a portion of the salms of david so full of piety and devotion and some chapters in the bible too generally fear neglected by christians in private where we have excellent rules and examples of holy living and powerful motives to it this must needs be granted to conduce very much to the directing and reforming our lives
if this blessed effect be not wrought upon all who come daily to the publick prayers of our church more is the pity but the fault is in themselves and not in our prayers
if some frequent them only in formality and hypocrisie tis no wonder they are never the better for them
do thou frequent them with sincerity devotion and attention and be assured thou shalt receive great spiritual improvement by them as doubt not but thousands of the sincere members of our church to their inexpressible comfort do find


this advantage of a good life by frequency in publick prayer is also and that chiefly to be ascribed to the blessing of god and the powerful working of his grace upon us which blessing is promised to us and to be obtain'd by us only in the serious use of the duty of prayer so qualified as before hinted
thus our blessed saviour instructs us

ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall opened unto you where that he refers particularly to this blessing of his grace and holy spirit appears from these following words

if ye being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give the holy spirit to them that ask him this acknowledge is spoken of prayer in in general but it holds true of publick prayer with a great advantage as you have already heard

if then frequency in publick prayer does thus promote the honour of god and our religion if it procures those blessings we want either for our selves or others and greatly tends to promote a good life if we have any regard to the honour of god and our religion if any real desire to be happy here or hereafter we shall rejoyce in all opportunities of publick prayer and heartily endeavour so to order our affairs that nothing may hinder our constant attendance at them

and if frequency in publick prayer be so needfull a duty as you have seen the like frequency

and that with the greatest seriousness in receiving the holy sacrament of the lord's supper which is the highest solemnity of prayer is upon the account of the same and greater reasons as needful a duty where there are the happy opportunities of it
and in this also the worthy founder of your chapel hath very piously provided for you

and as understand many of you purpose very commendably to communicate on this day so hope and earnestly exhort you will do it with that sincerity in a hearty repentance for your sins and serious resolutions of a holy life that you may receive much spiritual comfort and improvement by it and then you will even rejoyce in the frequent opportunities of this holy sacrament in this place and make it your constant care as it is your certain duty to dispose your selves for a worthy partaking of them
consider well and always bear it in mind how great your guilt will be how heavy your condemnation if ye shall slight and neglect or any ways abuse such powerful means of salvation
but must not insist upon this copious subject
only crave your patience whilst observe unto you three or four practical inferences from what has been discoursed
inferences


if these places be houses of prayer and by our saviour's own direction not to be employ'd in common uses then let us always treat

them with respect and reverence considering they are god's houses consecrated to his more immediate service and in which he is pleased to vouchsafe his more peculiar presence

in respect of this his presence god declares that the place where he appear'd to moses was consecrated and therefore required him to shew reverence to it

put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground
the like was commanded to ioshua upon the same account

and this as a token of respect obedience and humility
the custom being taken as some

conjecture from captives or who used to go barefoot in token of their subjection

hence arose that custom amongst the jews for the priests to enter into the temple barefoot


the like was observed amongst the very heathen who had their nudipedalia sacra and put off their shoes when they enter'd the temple of apollo


so some have observ'd that even amongst the turks and aethiopick christians they go not into their sacred assemblies but with their feet naked
that was the ancient way amongst them of expressing their reverence as uncovering the head is now amongst us
and will not all these rise up in judgment against us and condemn us if we permit them to shew more respect and honour to the places of their false worship than we to those of the true

thus we find st paul requiring decency in the church particularly that men be uncovered and

women covered there

because of the angels they being supposed both under the old and new testament to be present in the places of god's publick service observing the behaviour of all

there present and accusing every indeceney and disrespect to god

and from this their presence it is that god is said to be peculiarly present in churches whose presence in one place more than in another in respect of himself is not easily conceivable and so to fit them to be the houses of god according to the explication of iacob

who upon the vision of angels at luz awakes and says how venerable is this place the lord is in it this is none other but the house of god

upon this account we read that the primitive christians were wont to shew very great respect and reverence in the church as being the solemn place of worship and where god did more peculiarly manifest his presence and are told by a learned author

that they came into the church as into the palace of the great king with fear and trembling and that the emperors themselves who otherwise never went without their guard about them yet when they came to go into the church used to lay down their arms to leave their guard behind them and to put off their crowns all as tokens of that high respect they bare to those religious places

let them always then be esteemed holy by us as being set a part for holy uses and in relation to god and to their end mean not otherwise and let them accordingly be always treated by us


if they be houses of prayer than we may hence infer the great error of those who think preaching to be the chief if not the only duty needful to be performed in these places and accordingly if they be but present at the sermon think they have done their duty very well although they wholly neglect the prayers and think it not worth their while to come to church when only prayers are there performed and so this error of their judgment is the more dangerous in that it engages them in so great an error in their practice also

but had our blessed saviour been of the same opinion with these men surely he would have called these houses of god houses of preaching and not as in the text houses of prayer

we may observe to this purpose that in king solomon excellent prayer at the dedication of the temple

all his petitions are that god would hear the prayers which upon any occasion his people should put up to heaven in or towards that his house not one petition for a blessing upon any other duty as if no other but that of prayer at leastwise none comparable to it was to be performed in that place

speak not this to vilifie preaching far be that from me it is an excellent ordinance and very needful even in this knowing age
but yet would not have it thrust out prayer nor indeed be exalted above it which all that are judicious and serious must grant to be an act of worship directed immediately to god and a means to sanctifie

preaching which is immediately directed to men


at all times when we approach to the house of god for religious worship let us remember it is a house of prayer and then beware we no ways profane it as the jews did whom our blessed saviour here rebukes
and yet this fear is too often done by too many christians
when we customarily neglect it we then are thieves out of the temple though not properly in it by robbing god of his glory our religion of its reputation our christian brethren of the assistance of our prayers and our own souls of their proper food and nourishment
and when we frequent these places of worship purely to be thought religious in order to some secular ends we plainly make the house of god an house of merchandise
and they do the same in some sort who amidst the holy offices of religion employ their thoughts upon their worldly affairs which ought to be wholly intent upon the weighty duties there performed such make the house of god an house of merchandise

but if we be not guilty of this sort of profanation there are others too common amongst us which ought no less to be avoided by us


the unseemly and rude behaviour of many in our churches and that even in the time of divine service does too loudly testifie how little of devotion brings them thither and at how mean a rate they value that sacred place and all those holy offices that are there performed
the impiety and danger of which

shall chuse to represent unto you in the words of an excellent author of our own

such variety says he of rude behaviour is there too often used in the house of god that should an unbeliever come into our assemblies he must surely as st paul supposes in another case cor

say we are mad to see some gazing some whispering some laughing others sleeping and perhaps the far fewer number praying is such a medly as the most brutish idolaters never admitted in their worship
and then he goes on to expostulate with christians as fear we have too much reason to do at this day when alas will the church recover its ancient title and become the house of prayer tis certain that according to the present appearance it may have many more proper names that being the least part of business done in it
but surely god will not always be patient of such profanation but will as the scripture speaks repay them to their face who who thus contemn him to his
we know among men every one counts his house his fortress and an affront offer'd him there doubles the injury and is not only a contempt but an invasion and shall it not be a proportionable enhauncement with god also thus to defie him within his own doors and approach his presence in an impious bravery the more fully to shew him how little we regard him so that excellent author


and lastly
if it be so much for the honor of god and our own advantage as you have seen to frequent our publick prayers then every one may easily infer how much it is both his duty

and his interest to be present at them as much as possible

you of this place are now very happy in having daily opportunities of publick prayer and tis much to be wished by all serious christians that every parish of this nation could enjoy and would make a right use of the like advantage
think then beseech ye how heinous your guilt will be if you customarily and unnecessarily neglect these blessed opportunities
how will ye answer it at the last and great account to your lord and judge who put it into the heart of your pious benefactor to provide thus conveniently for your daily performance of this great duty if ye shall slight it despise it and turn your backs upon it
whilst many of you fear spend more time every day than would be required to this duty in vanities and impertinencies others it may be in doing nothing and others in such business as might easily be contrived so as not to hinder your frequenting these publick prayers and is of infinitely less importance ye will discover a great disregard to god the honor of your religion and the care of your own souls if you customarily neglect these desireable opportunities

the primitive christians set us a much better example and very worthy our diligent imitation who we are told by a learned author of our church

were wont to flock to the religious solemnities as to their spiritual meals and banquets
and then he recounts what st chrysostom

reports of the church at antioch that they would set aside all affairs at home to come to church and how he tells them that it was the great honor of the city not

so much that it had large suburbs and vast numbers of people or brave houses with guilded as that it had a diligent and attentive people churches so thronged and crowded and all persons inflamed with such an insatiable desire of the publick offices of religion and that the commonness of them did not with them as fear it too often does with us breed a contempt

thus did true piety prevail amongst christians then but alas with grief we see it infinitely decay'd with us now when in stead of crying out with the psalmist

when shall come to appear in the presence of god we like those in malachi

snuff at his service and say what a weariness is it

but certainly that eye which discerns what multitudes carelesly absent themselves from his worship cannot but adjudge us most profane despisers of his mercy in giving and continuing to us the happy opportunities of it

obj
but perhaps some may here object and say what need these daily publick prayers we are careful to worship god at his house on the lord's day and this seems to be all that is required of us in the fourth commandment which allows us the other six days for labour and our own business and therefore thus to require us to attend the daily publick worship seems to be an unnecessary service and an infringement of that liberty which god has graciously indulged to us
but ans
let such consider that this objection is of equal force against all occasional days of fasting and thansgiving which yet presume themselves will allow of and acknowledge they are obliged sometimes to observe

let them consider again that the same god who gave the fourth commandment to the iews did also enjoyn them other days for solemn worship which were to be observed even upon any of those six days of labour tho they required strict rest as the day of atonement did lev

and that they had their daily worship notwithstanding the fourth commandment at which our blessed saviour was frequently present and thereby gave his approbation of it

and that this is no violence to christian liberty but rather a duty recommended by christianity appears in that tis recorded by st luke in commendation of anna that she departed not from the temple but served god with prayers and fastings night and day


and of the first converts of christianity that they continued daily with one accord in the temple


and of the disciples of christ that after his ascension they returned to ierusalem and were continually in the temple praising and blessing god

that is the temple was the place not of their continual abode but of their constant daily performance of their devotions as the learned paraphrast

glosses upon those words


obj
others perhaps may say they are very careful to perform this duty in private they pray at home every morning and night and perhaps sometimes may read a chapter in the bible with their families at the close of the day and this they hope is sufficient for them who have much business on their hands and perhaps families to provide for by their labours and they trust their gracious god will accept of what they do and expect no more from them
to this answer


ans tis much to be wish'd they are so well employ'd as they pretend at home but as much to be fear'd that they are not for did they make a real conscience of performing this duty at their own houses the same conscience would bring em frequently to god's unless they labour under some unhappy prejudices against it where i'm sure they might perform it better
for


suppose they do pray and read at home yet how can this excuse their neglecting the publick service in the church where the same duties are performed with greater advantage
there thou findest many fires to kindle thy zeal the example of others for reverence and order the decency and suitableness of the place the more peculiar presence of god and his gracious promise that he will have a more especial regard to those prayers which are put up to him in his own house in that forequoted place chron


does it become us to be our own carvers and when our gracious god calls us to worship him in his house to tell him in effect he must excuse us we'l do it as we can at our own and that must serve his turn
consider that altho thou perhaps mayst duely perform these duties at home yet others from thy example may think it needless to come to publick prayers and wholly omit them in private also and so thou fall under the guilt of scandal in its proper sense against which a woe is denounced by our lord st matth


woe be to that man by whom offences come


consider that the apostles and primitive christians who surely knew how to pray at home

as well as any of us yet were very constant at the publick places of worship tho to the great hazard of their lives or liberties for so doing and left this express command behind them to all christians

not to forsake the assembling of themselves together
not to forsake the publick religious assemblies tho to avoid persecution as was the unhappy case of the christians at that time much less to avoid some small and very tolerable inconveniency to our secular affairs as is generally the worst of the case with us now which that god whom we serve can and certainly will abundantly recompence to then let me add


in the last place if any well disposed christians be so ingaged in some needful business or have such urgent necessities to provide for by their labours that they cannot attend the daily publick service of our church without great inconveniency and yet have really a due esteem for it and would with all their hearts be daily present at it did their indispensable occasions permit them such will presume to say shall be excused by our gracious lord who has declared he will have mercy mercy to our selves as well as to others rather than sacrifice st matth


such shall undoubtedly be accepted on the account of their wills and real desires and by the goodness of our god in a good measure partake of the benefit of our publick prayers as if themselves had actually been present at them

but for all others who have not this necessity to plead for their absence who easily might have been present at the daily service had they been

really willing such must not expect to be so excused and therefore hope and pray they will be prevailed with so to acquit themselves in reference to this duty that god may be duly honor'd by them true piety and devotion encouraged and advanced their own comfort and prosperity promoted in this world and their eternal happiness by the mercies of god and the merits of his son secur'd to them in the next

one word in the close of all to you

in particular for whose sakes more immediately your worthy benefact or has erected this house of prayer

you by his great bounty are in a more especial manner devoted to and engaged in the service of god you have not the necessities of this life to provide for by your labours nor the anxious cares of it to perplex and distract your thoughts you have a comfortable provision made you by his piety and charity both for your souls and bodies
remember always how much you are obliged both to god and him to answer the great end of this his bounty to you by living to the honour of god and your religion particularly by a constant and devout attendance at the prayers and sacraments which will be performed in this place

be very careful beseech you to approve your selves widows indeed that so you may be worthy of that honor relief and maintenance as the original word

often signifies in scripture which the apostle would have to be given to such in tim


honor relieve widows that are widows indeed

and who are such he tells us
and such hope and heartily pray all you may be

she trusteth in god and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day she is blameless and well reported of for good works and has diligently followed every good work

this is the sum of what your blessed saviour and presume to say your pious benefactor also expects from you viz
that you be constant and serious at prayers and sacraments that your conversation be blameless and of good report particularly for humility gravity sobriety contentedness weanedness from the world love and peaceableness amongst your selves and towards all men graces which more especially adorn your station and that you be diligent followers of every good work
then shall you approve your selves widows indeed in the apostles sense to the honor of your lord the reputation of your religion the great satisfaction of your benefactor and the mighty encouragement of such pious and charitable acts to your own great comforts whilst you live in this world and to your eternal happiness in the world to come
which eternal happiness god in his due time make you and all of us partakers of for the sake of his dear son iesus christ our saviour to whom with the father and blessed spirit be ascribed all obedience adoration and praise now and for evermore
amen
for the direction and assistance of the more ignorant let me here add

tis very adviseable that all persons when they intend to partake of our publick prayers hasten to

the house of prayer as soon as the bell begins to call to it that so they may have some little time before prayers begin to raise their devotions and fix their thoughts upon the duties before them by considering the weightiness of them and the presence of god humbly and earnestly begging his assistance in the performance of them which may be done by those who are not better provided in this or the like short prayer following

let thy merciful ears lord be open to the prayers of thy humble servants and grant that we may now and at all times ask faithfully and obtain effectually through iesus christ our lord
amen
or this
most gracious god who hast commanded us to pray without ceasing incline my heart to this duty and so assist me with thy holy spirit now and at all times in the performance of it that may so ask that may receive and so hear thy word that may practice it and by these opportunities for which bless thy name may daily more and more improve in righteousness and true holiness until come to thine everlasting kingdom through iesus christ my lord and only saviour
amen
at the conclusion of divine service and before thou risest from thy knees say to thy self this or the like short prayer
lord in mercy hear our prayers and relieve all our wants
continue unto us these means of grace make me and all that profess thy name to delight in them with reverence and godly fear to approach unto them and always to become better by them through iesus christ our lord
amen
or this
blessed be thy name god for this opportunity of waiting upon thee in thine house lord pardon the iniquity of my holy things and make me a partaker of the benefit of those prayers which have been put up unto thee at this time
in mercy continue unto me these opportunities and fit me more and more for thy service here and for thy kingdom hereafter for iesus christ his sake
amen

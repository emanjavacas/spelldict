high news for hierusalem
proclaim from the lord of hosts the return of the jewes from their captivity and the building of the temple in glory in their owne land
hear ye iewes my brethren am a jew of the tribe of reuben but unknown to me till the lord spake unto me by voice whose voice heard but saw no appearance and he changed my name from thomas to theaurau john since the
of november

now unto ye iewes my brethren am sent to proclaim from the lord of hosts the god of israel your returne from your captivity in what nation soever ye are scattered
from thence ye shall be gathered into your owne land jerusalem shall be built in glory in her owne land even on her owne foundation as the lord hath shewn mee though it seem never so impossible in the judgement of men yet by him that liveth for evermore it shall be accomplished
and ye my brethren who say our bones are dryed and our hope is gone and we are cleane cut off as the lord liveth who brought our

fathers out of the land of egypt so sure shall your returne be
and ye my brethren shall be the glory of all the earth and the sear of nations for saw the spirit of the lord go forth to effect his owne work and for his owne names sake will he bring this great thing to pass
therefore my brethren fear not neither be afraid for the lord of hosts is your leader and theauraujohn but now theau roam tannijah your captain general and leader and also your brother our iah his servant
whereas this proclamation was confirmed by thomas being changed into theauraujohn so it is now affirmed and for confirmation of the truth in this declared do subscribe my name theau roam tannijah leader of the peoples
now hear all peoples and nations whereas was commanded by my holy iehovah to retract from speaking unto any person for dayes and of the same days to see no person all which have performed and in that time have received my and work as also this insuing declarative and as noah his ark was his declared obedience from faith in fine received which faith and obedience was and is madness unto the world to which obedience the worlds sentence was what will this mad man do will he cause this vessel to go upon the dry land and paul was mad unto the peoples then but the end is faiths coronation so now shall many idiots say of this insert but know yee peoples the stoutest heart shall fail in this great day of jubilee for it is the high and mighty revolve in jehovahs frame unto which sacred high and mighty name let all peoples bow

upon the scene at twelve a clock in the night the word of my jehovah came unto me saying write out this edict my command saying who among the inhabitants of wales england scotland and ireland is for the returning unto hierusalem that good land given unto our fathers so long ago now who amongst the inhabitants of the whole earth will return unto hierusalem let an insertation amongst them be drawn and their names subscribed in a roll of parchment for the town and city and county and let that record be ready the twelfth of iune next in our
for after that record is received and reviewed there is to go forth another edict and after that second edict there goeth forth the third edict and that is all my iehovah and your iah hath commanded me for to do to lift up my voice three times for the gathering of the people
but it is not by multitude that we shall overcome but it is iehovah's might that shall bring us into our owne land and our ancient inheritance even samaria and the six nations unto her regency belonging
for iehovah is good and just and faithful in all his wayes who will do this great work but not by men but by his owne might shall we in his strength reduce the seven nations unto our royal obedience that we may partake of the good of the iehovah goodness promised as we have tasted of his wrath for our rebellions

so my brethren this is to let you know the good that our iehovah will bring us unto even a land that floweth with milk and honey a fruitful land the glory of the world israels inheritance therefore ye be valiant in walking in the strength of obedience that is

the sacrifice that sanctifieth us in and to our iah for by obedience we are received into life
for my brethren obedience is the key that doth unlock the door into that goodly good land here and that goodly good heritansial rest in the celestial centre where is rejoycing in full strength in glory which obedience is the inletting into that regency

thus saith iehovah unto his servant theauroam your king and high priest by the holy anointing received in and by fire and also the holy and sanctifying law and everlasting covenant
in fire have received them from that terrible and everlasting burnings that is a consuming fire unto all not purifyed
therefore by fire am purifyed for to stand betwixt my iehovah and you his people for he hath consecrated me in holy fire to stand betwixt you and himself for to conscene with him and to declare unto you the things that he commandeth unto you
now hear ye people what your iah commandeth for by that name iah will he be known to you
but you are commanded upon pain of death not to name iehovah for in and by that sacred name iehovh is he known unto me being your high priest the holy anointed of my iehovah and your iah that is in and by his everlastingness which is signified by his name iah
it shall be thus ye holy ones for you shall be no more iudah and israel or israel and iudah but the holy ones of your iah and my iehovah for my iehovah hath wrought his mighty work for to bring them two iudah and israel into one stick in my hand
for my lineage genealogically runs from ionathan the son of saul in rehoboams line that holds israel and also in the line of david that holds iudah and both these conjoyned in aarons house and confirmed

in and by the high priesthood as by genealogial demonstration in the true recorded records for the darkness lies in aaron because he stands reckoned in the tribe of levi and he was and is of the tribe of reuben
thus his father was of levi but the woman was a reubenite and the tribe's dignity doth carry it in the statute genealogically
thus it was reubens royalty in and over all the tribes that whosoever without exception should have a wife given unto him out of the tribe of reuben the man so receiving lost his name and his inheritance was recorded under reuben and all his children were reubenites for ever
thus the man was both disabled in estate and name and seed untill the jubilee came and then the land returned unto the owne tribe by an inheritansial statute made unto that conjunction
so now if you say that saul was king in israel and judah lo behold his son theauroam tanniahhh and if you shall say that we had david our king the beloved of our jah lo theauroam tanniahhh his son and if you shall say that ahharon or aaron was our fathers priest the holy anointed of our jah behold his son theauroam tanniahhh in his fathers fathers fathers stead as our jah had promised that david should have a son to stand before his throne in the glory of his majesty

now hear my people thus say theauroam king of the seven nations and by the holy anointing by fire received and in fire have received the holy law and high and holy covenant and by the same high and holy and pure divine and sacred anointing am also confirmed recorder unto our tribes being now thirteen as also captain general and your leader unto hierusalem under my supream lord king

jehovah there in the place that my iehovah my supream hath set me in by his holy anointing
theauroam your captain general do will and command that ye observe this my command that ye live honestly unto all and in a peaceable preservable way unto this state where ye now live and although go leader by an unduted right king and supream vicegerent upon and over my seven nations yet am in this nation the meanest subject
my brethren know that humility is all the foundations and the greatest glory if it be viewed with true sight as you see a fair or rare house builded you look upon its high structure and that you praise but you do not then see its greatest glory which is its basis or foundation which is in the earth that even that is the houses true glory for it is the strong strength that beareth the houses frame
my brethren if that last state were but viewed with true eyes you would become lower and then you would become truly high and then are ye our jah his loveliness for height without a sure sarbaxed strength in the soale of it cannot continue so now have done all but uttering my voice
this is the first wales because in her true right she is regent over england for the natives are in wales and this is the first house in this land am commanded to call unto which is the house of darby
who in or of the house of darby will go unto hierusalem and build the temple of our jah the great jehovah who in or of pembrook and montgomery will go up who of carthamargain who in brecnack will go up unto hierusalem and build the temple of our jah and the great jehovah who in radnal will go up who in limpster will go up who in cardiff will go up and build the temple in hierusalem who in all and of all wales and england

and scotland and ireland and who in the whole earth will go up unto hierusalem and build in the temple unto our jah the great jehovah let them subscribe their names as is above said and the records shall be received in every county and so drawn into rolls for there is to be three subscriptions
for whosoever will go whose heart jehovah hath touched fear not to subscribe lest you purchase a blot unto your house and your family be forced to bear your shame for whosoever will go shall not be left behinde neither man woman nor children for jehova and my jah our elokkim will destroy this land utterly see unto your selves whose faces are set toward jerusalem temporal speak plain in the land of judeah and in the city of samaria but now samaritaniah

theauroam taniahhh leaders of the peoples unto hierusalem

hear earth and the inhabitancing of english earth thus saith jah thy sions king and hierusalems glory hear sion in all the angle points in the north in which thou art a sojourner a pilgrimage captive in the thick idolatrous idolatry
thus saith thy jah that he will cause thy captivity for to return and thy return shall be unto thy sacred jehovah which turn thy priest hath taken and it is embuildatory for the whole house both of judah and israel and thy turning shall be into receiving the law thy light thy

land the inheritance of thy fathers the sons of abraham isaac and jacob and david your king shall lead you
this is the word of jehovah unto theauroam tannijah hear ye people of the ancient covenant for you hath jah an everlasting controversie with the inhabitants of the earth for in righteousness our jehovah will do judgement and in our jah is the purity in truth demonstrated in his everlasting mercy
in this shall it appear and be declared in his taking into covenant the seed of the rejected parents our fathers the ancient israelites

now thus saith your jah but my jehovah for in that high and sacred great and holy name will jehovah be known unto me onely being am his but unto ye his people by his holy name jah will he be known in his everlasting mercy will he be named amongst his people and upon his people all which long suffering lies in his sacred name jah therefore be ye mindful that ye do not name the great and high and mighty and sacred name jehovah lest he consume you in and for your disobedience but jah is your name for to call upon or elokkim or or eloah or al or addoniel or el or am or hemanuel or bethem
these be the names israel that thou shalt name for the name god thou shalt say eloah and for christ bethem and for jesus hemanuel
them are thy names israel for thou shalt not name in thy mouth a strange god
neither saith your jah will he be called upon by the name of an heathen god neither answer thee israel but in his own prescript therefore you who look for your deliverence and hierusalems glory labor to forget the names of the gods of the heathen for this land

is an abhorration with all its fashions unto your jah shall be destroyed as in the day of sodom
now thus saith your jah hear israel my people and tannijahhhs house whom have tyed ye my people into
for the house of tannijahhh being builded ye my people are the builders the building that being built then the covenant with david is performed the light in israel is restored and mercy unto saul house is from me jah extended for to take in again my ancient king old israels saul for his was the house and david but a familie in that house
so now thus saith my jah and my jehovah that in tannijahhh is the house builded the families rectified the promise made good both in mercy and judgement
thus in judgement cast off saul to receive in my mercy his seed in my own house
in mercy gave david unto my people that in my mercy might refine his seed by punishing them until the families were fitted for to come into the house my building
for ye sons of men my waies are not like your waies for am iah in my everlastingness
act my waies confounding man and the wisest beauty in the sons of men
for am hallelujah in my self but in my outgoings is motion in its variety intensiously intended and extended beyond the worm man his finding out
eck and kleatt

yet thus saith our iah that in the true theologie saul and david do make one man
thus saul is the outward appearance called man on which stature all outward eyes do look and david is the intense wisdome in that appearance seated within for the guidance of the outward figure for the outward figure is weak and the david is the strength within which is iah elokkim everlasting in prevalency for the bethem is the refiner

by rectification in the outward figure to bring it into its living intense nature
so being done then behold jehovah theologie etymologically expressed in that figure man
then saul and david are one man and the first spirit in the second adam is again made one for the dead adam is made the living hemanuel bethem
my brethren you cannot fathom my theologie for it is beyond divinity for it is via in se that is jah his king is hemanuel looking glass in omnia via for none fathoms the heart of an anointed king but the anointer who is my jehovah and your jah and in us both hemanuel
this following edict is engraven in brass and to be sent into holland
the edictory unto all the jewes the whole earth over greeting

ye my brethren

now thus saith theauroam tannijah the great king of the seven nations that jehovah my supream lord and master hath commanded me not to spare the disobedience of any or all and have sworn in urim

and thummim that whosoever doth wilfully disobey my command being iehovah general in this great iourney unto hierusalam he shall be put to death
have sworn by my majesty being king of the seven nations by the sacred and holy anointing from iehovah my king and that will not spare any that doth transgress wilfully my command the holy covenant and jah his pure and undefiled law which law and covenant received in fire and every letter syllable and peat in burning flames of revengeful fire therefore see unto your selves before you do presume to enter into covenant with your iah but my iehovah for iah is your pure and proper and peculiar word or name but iehovah is my heritansial ingraftment because am from iehovah my supreme king
now thus saith your iah but my iehovah that the house of saul and ionathan and rehoboam the son of ionathan and the family of david these now all lye in the priesthood of aaron but ahharon and in any of these lines who do carry the majesty of royalty they do carry it into reuben thus because reuben is the royal tye in all the families as was given by me iah unto moses ahharon's brother under whose conduct your fathers returned
for though they were taken away yet their edicts directed the people
now this was reuben's dignified royalty upon and over all the tribes none excepted for whosoever should have to wife a daughter of the tribe of reuben without exception the man and his inheritance were recorded in reubens genealogie so that the woman did bear the mans right hereditatorily and all the children were reubenites for ever and thus stands aaron wronged

being reckoned in and from the tribe of levi and he is reuben and from him to him iehovah hath tyed all the fathers beforenamed
and thus his name doth bear whom have chosen your leader the au roam tan tan is his own name hereditorily
the ep is light that stands for ahharon that was my anointed priest as he now is this fourteenth day being sabbatty named iehotial that is the name of our sabatty
au doth signifie david for he feared before me
ro signifies my mercy that is unto transgressors that was sauls house the stemmes aforenamed do signify that in my name am that is your leaders conjunct or closing up all and in that name am have unto sauls house declared my everlastingness in passing by their transgressions for my holy name sake because am iah everlasting mercy goodness to my house my holy ones for now it shall not be no more the house of saul and the family of david but they two are become one in my strength their ingrafter and it shall be no more said the house of israel and the house of iudah neither the house of iudah and the house of israel but the lords house his holy ones
this is transcribed on sabbatty because the insert is holiness it self
signed by me theauroam tannijahhh king of the seven nations and captain general under my master jehovah and and leader of the peoples unto hierusalem my ancient seat royal the city of my father david and my father rehoboam from jonathan the son of saul and from ahharon my genelustrated in cenealogy
dated in january so called my fourteenth day being sabbatty
given under our sigatory royal in the year london

unto the synagogue of the jews in amsterdam
by recordat theauroam tannijahh
the epistle edictory upon the scene or day

and the word of jah spake unto me saying hear my people even ye whom have chosen ye holy ones this is my command upon you that ye do forsake all the fashions of the gentiles in which ye have so long delighted your selves with all their deceitful sorceries and wichcrafts ye shall not follow them in any thing that they do for they are the children of my wrathful curse therefore follow not their waies lest ye be partakers of their plagues that jehovah will bring upon them for to cut off their memorial from off the earth
therefore hear and observe this is thy manner in thy salutations which salutations of the gentiles is a or a
thus shall it be amongst ye my people that when ye meet one another as when the man meeteth with the woman his friend or acquaintance he shall not put off his hat unto her as the gentiles do in their meetings but thus shall it be amongst ye my people ye shall not kiss one another as the gentiles do for that loath saith your jah but thus shall ye act in your meetings or salutations the woman shall stand upright if her body wil bear it and with her hands hanging down upon her hips that is the woman's posture alwaies and all times if the womans body will not bear uprightness then she is but to move that way prescribed the man in his salute unto the woman when he meeteth her he shall a little bow himself in his head and body a little and he

shall lay both his hands upon the womans arms above the elbows and so shall bear the woman a little on his left side and this is thy manner israel
now the reason why jah do command this manner in salutation it is this for by kissing is caused a fermentation whereby the body is diseased or disquieted by the breath received from any one or other for the breath hath in its intense nature an intrinsecal begetrix in its includement for the breath is abstracted from all breathings and is included into one abstract and if either the man or the woman be not stable in themselves then into the strength of the others breathing there is a contraction in its self though the party be never moved in their intenses that is his or her motion was never awakened by it
for breathing in one another and to one another is the mother begetrix of all lustful brutishness
so much for your salutes or kissing one another

now the man shall not kiss his sister his wife for she is his sister but in the insealing his seed delivered and no more for to know his sister till the child be twelve months or twelve moons old for ye must be a wise people before your jah who is holiness it self
and when the man doth meet with man his friend he shall not put off his hat unto him as the gentiles do but he shall lift up his right hand in the that is in the hand point and bow a little as in the womans prescription
now the reason of the man's lifting up his right hand it is this that he doth in the truth in the uplifting his hand rejoyce to see his brother in health and he bowing his head doth acknowledge that it is the mercy of jah to bring them together in health for to refresh one the other by their well sight
this is for

men be they what they will unless it be unto the heads of the tribes and that prescript is to be in its time and place in observance but this is now even now this present required to be observed and obeyed of all ye the people of our elokkim and these be the edictories commanded by your jah and my jehovah
the next is why the woman shall stand upright in her stature and the man bow unto the woman and laying both his hands upon the womans arms that is the joynt above the elbow it is thus the womans uprightness is the mans glory for the woman is the man's strength in the illustration of his seed for of one man by the woman are many branches illustrated so that the man being one unity by the woman is made multiplicity
that is one reason
but here is the main
for the standing of the woman upright is not the intention
for speak things in the truth which is the womans being upright as in that demonstration she ought to be that even that is the mans glory and the womans praise of excellency
now the mans laying his hands upon the womans arms it is this he shews that in effect that the uprightness in the woman was and is the mans strength and therefore he doth acknowledge it before his jah in his bowing unto him by the bending of his face downward

now the man taking the woman unto his left side it is thus because that he doth declare that although the woman is his glory yet the woman is his weakness also for by woman man is made very weak in his intensiality that word lies hid
but thus she is the mans weakness for the man bowing upon the woman the man becomes very weak in himself for to give his life an outlet in issue by the woman his weakness so

you see the woman is mans glory and man's weakness also this figure is allegorically allusive unto an higher illustrative so that the woman doth illustrate the man by the mans becoming weak upon the woman
the next is thou shalt not lye with thy sister thy wife but onely for generation no not in bed for it is a bewitching evil that will prove a sore snare unto you both for it is fire unto wood but in all holy chastity in purity and purity in chastity shall you walk
in wisdoms way shall you act all your doings saith my jehovah and your jah your everlasting saviour for your jah will have you so wise in your peace that the cause shall be removed so that there can be no effect produced when there is no cause stated

per me theauroam tannijahhh high priest
the end of the first edict unto the people my house our jah his holy ones
let none seek to speak with me for into silence am returning to be taught a pure language for confirmation of this insert have sealed this edict with our signatory march the

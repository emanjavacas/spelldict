to the right honorable the lorde robert dudley erle of leicester baron of denbigh knight of the moste noble order of either garter and of sainct michaels maister of her maiesties horses and one of her highnesse moste honourable priuie counsell encrease of all honour healthe and wealthe in this life and in the worlde to come the blessed estate of life euerlastyng

after had finished the tra~slation of this tragicall historie right honourable conteinyng the verie originall of the warres in the now miserable lowe countries whiche before those troubles were taken as it were to bee the paragone or rather paradise of all the countries in europe whiche warres and troubles as myne auctour hath sett doune beganne in the yere
and hath continued his storie vnto the yere in whiche finde how the moste righteous god in his moste iuste iudgement hath with his roddes of corrections meane the spaniardes and certaine other hispaniolized low countrey men fatherly chastized that people for

their greate disobedience and woonderfull vnthankefulnesse especially for the contempte of the glorious gospell of his deare beloued soonne our onely sauiour and redeamer christe jesus so frely offered vnto them besides all the reste of his notable benefites whiche roddes and scourges when he hath in his great wisedome teawed vpon them for their amendement he will surely like a tender and louyng father caste into the fire
vvhiche his fatherlike dealyng should moue vs of the englishe nation throughly consider of
for in my simple opinion sauyng the iudgement of farre grauer wiser and learneder then my self our staffe sta~deth next the dore for where can wee read either in the olde testament or yet in any other prophane historie that euer god dealte more bountifully with any nation then with vs either for thynges needefull and necessarie or delightfull and pleasaunt for this life
so that it maie vetie well be saied of vs that we enioye a lande flowyng with milke and honie
but especially for the plentifull bestowyng of his moste holie and blessed worde emongest vs whiche chief and principall benefite is in suche sort by the greater nomber of vs so contemned as that it must needes cause hym one daie make vs feele his heauie

ha~d as these low countries haue already without we speedely returne vnto him in true and vnfained repentaunce for we must not thinke that if we fault in the like sinnes but to reape the like iudgement because he is one and the self same god in punishyng from euerlastyng
no sir this historie declareth vnto vs that the beginnyng of these troubles came by reason of the refusyng of the spanishe inquisition and of the defence of the state of religion whiche wee at this daie professe
and whiche the lorde be thanked for it euer sithe~ce the first blessed entrau~ce of her maiesties most godly and gracious gouernment ouer this noble realme of engla~d hath by the good aduise of your lordship the rest of her highnesse most honorable counsell been by her excellencie maintained and defended therefore bothe because of your holie faithe knowledge zeale and obedience in the truth of the same religion which the lord more and more encrease strengthen and continue in you as also by reason of the aidyng of all those godly ministers whom sathan with his impes and suppostes haue sought and daiely seeke by all meanes possible to deface as manifestly hath beene seene and yet still appeareth haue the rather for

these vertues aforesaied presumed vpon your honourable courtesie to choose you out from amongest the rest of the right honourable to be the patrone of this my poore trauell vnder whose godly protection it might marche and be sheelded
humbly beseechyng your lorshippe not to regarde so muche my boldnesse in my choise for the whiche craue pardone as the ende wherefore the historie was first written and for what cause also haue put the same in englishe
and then doubt not but that your good lordshippe will the better accept of the one for the cause of the other
and for your honourable and godlie dealyng aswell to wardes the worde as also towardes the godlie ministers you baue shewed your self to resemble that valiaunt and milde leader of the children of israell moses a verie true and faithfull seruaunt of god ouer his house and churche all his life long
and so your lordshipp still perseueryng therein as you haue begonne shall not onely resemble moses but followe also the godlie steppes of that valiaunt josua moses his successor who as we read in the laste chapter of his booke after he had assembled all the people together and recounted vnto theim the woonderfull thynges whiche god had doen for

them he exhorted them therefore to serue the lorde in perfectnesse and truth and not serue those gods whiche their forefathers had serued on the other side of the stood and in egipte saiyng further vnto theim that if thei thought it not good to serue that lorde that thei should chose that date whom thei would serue
for if you intende to serue the gods who your forefathers serued or the goddes of the ammorites in whose lande you dwell you shall serue them alone for me for and my house will serue the lorde who hath doen all these thynges for vs vvhiche grace and boldnesse beshe the lorde our god euen for his mercie and truthes sake graunt you and all her matesties moste honourable and faithfull counsellors
shal not here neede right honourable make any lenger discourse of the first of these troubles other then as haue in the beginnyng touched for if did should trouble our honorable eares with superfluous matter seeyng the readyng ouer of the same which if it might so please you gladly wish will leade you to a more sufficient and better vnderstandyng thereof whiche hath been one especiall cause why haue offered it vnto your lordship but more especiall to shewe vnto your good

lordship some parte of my poore affectio and good will to wardes you who desireth nothyng more then in all humble and maner to doe you suche seruice as agree with your honourable liking so moste himbly take my leaue
besechyng lorde further so to rule and guide your harte and mynde continually in his faithe feare and loue as hetherto he hath doen that his glorymaie be aduaunced his churche and this commonweale partly by your meanes in peace and godlinesse preserued and mainteined

to the high noble honourable and wise lordes my lordes of the estates the deputies presidentes and counselles burroughmaisters scoutes or marshalles maiors bailiefes and to al other officers and ministers of the prouinces whatsoeuer vnited to the lowe countreis your most humble and obedient vassall and subiect theophile wissheth grace peace and loue from god through iesus christ his only beloued sonne our lord

seyng my good lordes that all princes rulers and gouernours are the ordenaunce of god and as sainct paule in the to the romaines and diuers other places of the holy scripture witnesseth vnto vs carie not the sworde in vaine but for the preseruation and maintenaunce of the good and the resisting and punishyng the wicked and vngodly well then haue my lordes the estates and magistrates of the prouinces vnited to the lowe countreis deserued all honour and commendation who after the wonderfull dissentions and breaches of certaine of the prouinces and cities that separated them selues from the greater nomber bothe forgettyng al their honor and othe and condescendyng and agreeyng to the enemie haue not onely continued their vnitie but haue a greate deale more confirmed the same and therefore when throughly co~sider of the great constancie and stabilitie of the estates of hollande and zealande as also of the marueilous greate fidelitie of

my lorde the prince of orenge who and altogether very faithfully haue performed all office duetie in the maintenaunce of the warres against tyrauntes
could not possibly but commende and set forth their deserued honour commendation and praise aboue all the rest of the nations whatsoeuer that haue been so wonderfully aduaunced and renowmed aswel by the auncient as also by the late historiographes
and therefore in my poore opinion and iudgement can not see how the confedered and vnited prouinces maie doe better then to followe the waies and steppes of the hollanders and zealanders in euery poinct and condition in makyng warre and standyng against the force of all the rest of the lordes and princes of the other fifteene prouinces for if thei had otherwise doen thei had neither wonne honour nor yet gained any thing els thereby
for what a more wholesome better profitable and necessarie thyng could thei haue taken in hande then to fight and make warre for the religion and defence of their countrey by which meane thei might keepe themselues from the horrible oppression of bloodie tyrauntes seeyng the very heathen haue gotten them selues great honour by defending of their countrey

wherefore sith the defence of a mans countrey is so good and honourable a thyng and the defence of religion a thyng farre more excellent and of greater importaunce there is great reason the magistrate should wholy endeuour hym self to defende his good and faithfull subiectes
but what way maie any common weale most fitly be defended whe as there reigneth suche greate discorde and dissention among subiectes surely there are twoo meete kyndes of meanes to bee had and vsed amongest three estates of men for the defendyng and vpholdyng of a common weale in peace and vnitie
and first of all the magistrates are to obserue twoo thynges for the defence and maintenaunce of a commonweale in wit iudgement and iustice
by iudgement in seuerely and not rashly vsyng the sworde giuen vnto them by god for the punishyng of the wicked and offenders to the ende the good subiectes might bee saued and preserued from all

oppression and iniury they are also to haue a diligent care not to shed innocent bloud for feare that the bloud of the innocentes crie out to god against them for vengeaunce and so he require the bloud of them at their handes for in the booke of the cronicles it is saied vnto the iudges beholde ye iudges what you doe you execute not the iudgement of men but of god you doe iustice when as you pronounce true and right sentences in defendyng the wydowes and fatherlesse in doyng of them speedie iustice not corruptyng the lawe either for money or rewarde and not giuyng iudgement to the hurte of any of the parties either for want of not knowyng the cause or els through ignoraunce
wherefore it is a moste necessarie thyng for iudges to be learned in the ciuill lawe whiche thyng plato the heathen philosopher well considered when as he saied that that common weale was very happie whiche was gouerned by wisemen and philosophers
secondarely two thynges are necessarie in euery christian churche to the ende that no offences or dissentions arise amongest the people the first is the pure and sincere doctrine of the worde of god with the true administration of the sacramentes neither addyng to or takyng fro any one of them for it is written in the apocalipse that that man is cursed whiche either addeth or taketh awaie any thyng from the worde of the lorde
the other is that discipline and iudgement be straightly kept in the churche of god without tolleration or dissimulation or without respect of any persone or persones that all whoremongers dronkardes and all other whatsoener that doe continue and abyde in greeuous and grosse sinnes be excommunicated and cast out of the church to the ende the whole churche be not corrupted and infected by them and others take offence at their doynges

thirdly

there are two thynges necessarie to bee obserued in euery particuler familie or housholde
the first is that fathers and mothers of housholdes must bryng vp their familie of honestly and not suffer their meney to want thynges for paule saieth that that man is worse then an infiderawhiche prouideth not for his housholde
the other of the correction and chastesing of their children and tes

who are to bee corrected and kept in awe
for salomon saieth he that spareth the rodde hateth his childe
for youthe is compared vnto yong trees because whosoeuer he bee that will haue straite yong trees must set a very straite staffe harde by euery of them and so if yong youthes be well taught and brought vp from their cradle in the feare of the lorde and in his waies and pathes those youthes saie will become very honest and feare the lorde
now then my good lordes if these three estates of men were well brought vp the worlde would bee at a sarre better staie then now it is for then we should bee sure to heare no newes of so perilous ciuill warres sheddyng of bloud burnyng and destructions of prouinces as now presently we see for many prouinces are now brought to naught many cities sacked the enhabitauntes murdered and vtterly spoyled and the onely cause and originall of altogether is this that the three estates aforesaied are not duely and truely ordered and gouerned and therefore of very right and reason wee iustly feele the heauie indignation and wrath of god fallen vppon vs
now for conclusion my lordes haue been very desierous to dedicate this my booke vnto your lordshippes conteinyng the ciuill warres in the lowe countreis wherein you maie beholde the originall and first beginnyng of these troubles and bloudie warres together the stratagemes and practizes of the popish and spanishe inquisition vtterly to roote vp the churche of god
beseechyng you my good lordes to take all in good parte

your most humble and obedient seruaunt
theophile


the first booke of the histories of the troubles in the lowe countreys conteyning the very originall and chiefe beginning of all those troubles and cruell warres which sithens haue ensued
the scriptures of the prophetes and apostles wheron the church of god is built haue of long time bin vnknowne vnto christendome and ouershadowed with horrible darknes and so were hid by the and balamiticall priestes because they might thereby so much the more confirme and establish their vayne opinions and foolishe deuises as the very foundation of all their wealth and onely piller of their honor and dignitie

for

when martin luther began to bring to light the holy scriptures and had nowe manifested by the preaching of the gospell many faultes and abuses this doctrine of luthers was extreamely hated not onely because it seemed to set forth a newe way and path vnto saluation and so condemned our ancestours and predecessours but also because it taught what mens inuentions were and besides laide open all the deceiptes and abuses wherewith the church of god was infected insomuch that by that meanes was no more called the church of christ but the romish church

howebett this doctrine was principally contemned

reiected and iudged to be most wicked at such time as the sect of the braynsicke anabaptistes beganne to start vp in the townes of munster amstelredam and in the olde monastarie of fryse to wit in the yeere
as by this short latine versicle engrauen ouer the gates of munster in these capitall letters bearing bate the selfe same yeers manifestly may appeare

ecce peccata tua venerunt super caput tuum that is to say beholde thy sinnes are fallen vpon thine owne head

the which anabaptistes went about vnder the colour of religion and of the gospell vtterly to depriue the magistrate of all authoritie and had deuised to make all things in common saying that they were stirred vp by the spirite of god to reforme the worlde and to ordayne and set vp another kinde of ciuill gouernement
whereupon the enemie of the true doctrine which was preached in the beginning had then that which hee looked for insomuche that the most mightie and inuincible monarche of famous memorie the emperour charles the fifth was aduertised that all such as spake agaynst the faultes and abuses of the church of rome and refuted them were infected with that heresie and had determined to take away from princes and magistrates their authoritie and power to abolishe all pollitike gouernement to confounde all ciuill ordinaunces and would set vp and put in practise an horrible chaunge in all thinges by whiche information his imperiall maiestie was easily perswaded to ordayne and set downe very seuere ordinances edictes ching the cause of religion

and to proue this to be true his maisties edict published at wormes is a sufficient testimonie by which was declared that his maiestie was throughly informed that their doctrine tended to the same effect therefore his will pleasure was that the same edict shoulde wt out dissimulation or tolleration wt out respect of any person or persons of what estate or conditio soeuer be put in execution
insomuch that all officers followed ye same presently some for the hatred that they had to the same doctrine othersome againe for the spoyle which they looked for sought to charge innocent men with the doctrine of luther being readier to obey the emperours commaundement then gods who saith vnto tyrants when his people suffer persecution why persecute you mee and although the anabaptistes doctrine was nothing like vnto the doctrine of luther and zwinglius which tendeth to no kinde of sedition at all yet for all that the officers went so neere the consciences of men as that they spared not to torment pore miserable soules with all kinde of crueltie to the ende his

maiesties wil might bee throughly folowed and furthered whiche tended to the vtter rooting vp of them at once
insomuch that within fiftie yeeres next ensuing there were without all doubte moe then an hundreth thousande people put to violent death by vertue of these ordinaunces and edicts either els were forced through feare of the horrible tormentes to flye the countrey

nowe then as easily may be perceiued although the lutherans were greatly persecuted in all quarters of and on the otherside the zwinglians or they of the religion in the low countreys who for the greater number fully iumped with the lutherans yet for all that the great fidelity and obedience whiche they beare to their kinge and naturall liege lorde very manifestly and notoriously appeared as they of flanders oftentymes declared in hazarding their liues and goodes for their lorde and soueraygne when as they chased the french out of their borders and besides it is well knowen howe patiently they aboade the tyranny in keeping still a good and pure conscience to god alone alwayes obeying god rather then men in the cause of religion insomuch that one force of them was burnt another sort hanged the thirde drowned

and the fourth forte had no more hurt but their heades cut offiyea they endured all the tormentes that might bee and yet vsed they not once any worde tending to sedition following therein their maister christ iesus who being reuyled and euill dealt withall neuer gaue foule language but alwayes in their greatest tormentes praysed god wishing to the magistrate which tormented and executed them all good and amendement of life still praying to god for them

surely these were no seditious dealinges neyther yet tendyng to sedition yea the very enemies them selues of the lutherans and gospellers were enforced maugre their heardes to confesse as much but they saide in deede the reason was because they were not strong mough to withstande them
surely they woulde haue shewed some token of their insolencie if there had been any spice of sedition in their heartes

for notwithstanding the long absence of their king and the greate troubles and warres amongest their neighbours theyr consciences were continually thralled and

oppressed and they them selues most wickedly and cruelly handled by some of the officers and inquisitors and suffered most obediently to be led like lost sheepe to the slaughter and their goods to be taken from them and made away so that their children were enforced to beg or els being driuen out of the lande were constrained to come into some other strange countrey to dwell and liue there poorely insomuch that many ended their dayes in sorrowe and great miserie

but when the enemies of the bospel perceiued that the number of the protestantes or lutherans in germanie the huguenotes in fraunce and the gueses in the low countreys dayly encreased

they cold the find out or deuise no better way to hinder ye blessed proceeding of the preaching of ye gospel then to bring in the spanish inquisition or the corporation and house of the inquisitors by which they might attaine to the authoritie of magistrasie
and although his princely maiestie openly declared to the countie egmont and other noble men knights of the order that his maiesties meaning was not to bring into thraldome his subiects but to mitigate ordaine milder and gentler lawes whereby the religion might be directed and set foorth in a good and commendable order yet was it driuen in the ende to this point through the instructions and perswasions of the inquisitors yt his maiestie altered his opinio gaue expresse co~mandement yt the new bishops should be appointed ye counsel of tre~t to be kept ye inquisition of spain to be brought in put in execution as you may briefly vndersta~d by ye letters sent by ye duches of perma ladie regent of ye low countreys to all the gouernors senates cities wt the copie of his letters conteining an expresse commandement that the same shoulde be done throughout all the prouinces of the lowe countreys
nowe marke beseech you how litle authoritie the king had in spaine when as his wordes and letters were of so small force and effect

when these things were published

and the maner of the proceeding of them deliuered to the handes of the inquisitors such trouble of mind feare sorow so possessed ye hearts of euery one as if they had receiued sentence of co~demnation yet not wt standing there appeared no signe or token of sedition neither was there any wicked practise once thought of or shewed by any person whatsoeuer but still kept a plain direct course by way of

as ye supplicatio presented by the antwarpians sufficie~tly testifieth declaring yt the ancie~t priuileges statuts granted by the dukes and princes of olde in the belgique prouinces ought not to be infringed or broken as by the article next ensuing may very well appeare that is to say

the duke shall not chaunge the auncient statutes and priuiledges but by the councell and aduise of all the estates in generall and those to be assembled duly and in good order neither may they be co~manded and assembled by the cleargie me
for that were against the princes oth which he taketh at his ioyfull entrance into the dukedome wherefore they will not haue the ancient priueledges and franchises defaced but soundly conserued as well as those actes especially which king phillip hath granted vpon that point

but before goe any further will set foorth vnto you more at large their meaning to the ende you may the better vnderstande the matters that folow

the merueilous things whiche fell out about them
to be short will set downe vnto you the excellent priuiledges of brabande in sixe articles following whereof the first beginneth thus

first
the duke shall not assemble the clergie without the knowledge or consent of the other two estates to wit of the nobilitie and citizens
the seconde
the duke shall not pursue any of his subiectes or enhabitantes but by the ordinarte way of iustice or law to the ende the accused may defend him selfe by his aduocates or counsellers of the law so that they may thereby in all pointes be able to defende his cause
the thirde
the duke shall not impose any taxes or tollages vpon his subiectes without the consent of the estates of the countrey
the fourth
no straunger may take vpon him the administration of any honourable office in brahand but such offices as are of small estimation or importance

the fifth
when the duke sommoneth and sendeth for the generall estates to obtaine any thing at their hands the brabanders

are not bounde to remoue or conclude of any thing out of their countrey

the sixt if the duke will forcibly or otherwise infringe or deface their priuiledges the brabanders after duetiful and gentie protestation are discharged of their othe made to the duke at their free choyse to doe whatsoeuer they thinke good

ouer and besides the aforesaid supplication of the braba~ders

they of flanders exhibited another supplication although answere was made them that the kings meaning neither had byn nor yet now was to bring in the inquisition which made ye people greatly suspect yt the kings commandements edictes were counterfeited in the low countries without his ma knowledgee yet for al this there was great maruellous preparation made in al places
for in al senates courts parliame~ts some were appoynted to looke whether his subiects went to masse or no whether they folowed the ordinances of the romish church which officers were bound to make true certificate therof once euery
moneths at ye court of bruxelles yea the inquisitors the~selues had ful authority to execute such their imagination and deuise as was co~formable agreeing wt that instructio that was granted the
of may in ye yeere
by which they had ful co~mission authority to administer the inquisitio to condemne correct chastise or to imprison and appoynt into the handes of the magistrate and officer whom they would
moreouer that they might haue vse what filthy prisons soeuer they pleased to iudge without any ordinary maner of lawe

sometimes chose anye one of his ma counsel to giue iudgement as pleased them according to the forme tenure of the popish bul
this sentence was giue against al such as were susperted to be of the religion or as they themselues said of luthers or zwinglius heresie and as many as read any of the books forbidden by the pope should be burnt with those bookes and as many also as frequented any conuenticles where any disputing or reasoning of the holy scriptures was
ouer besides this al his maiesties subiects of what estate or condition soeuer they were whether president counseller boroughmaister or whatsoeuer officer els were enforced before the inquisitors to take knowledge of as many as were prese~ted vnto them punish al those that were fauourers of herefie and heretikes

furthermore the inquisitors tooke a note of all merchants

artificers poore or rich that were any way suspected of ye reformed religion
the inquisitors are commonly franciscanes or preaching friers which take a note of al suche as come not to confession or that offer not to their boxe giuing a copie of the to the new bishops whose officers as vshers sariauntes first of al by co~position burdened the poore soules who soone after were enforced to flee the countrey if they would not be taken so put to death as by experience often was seene

at that time it was noysed all the low countrey throughout

supposed to be a most certaine truth that duke erike of bru~swike had leuyed a mighty army both of horsemen footmen to plant the inquisition in the low countries by force of armes accordingly as he had before by the deuise purpose of the cardinal of granuelle enterprised to accomplishe so by that meane mea~t to make a conquest of the prouinces of the la~d of belgique and abolish al priuiledges and franchises and in the end make an absolute kingdome of it for this cause was the charge committed to the rulers and captaines who had receiued money of duke erike for the leuying of men of warre

these newnes engendered such a great feare in the hearts of the people as that the notablest richest mercha~ts of ye countrey

got packed vp al their goods together went away into other la~ds insomuch that the artificer had no work to set himself vpon al re~ts reuenues decreased many cities townes were vnpeopled so yt it was a lame~table thing to see into what a miserable estate the low cou~trey which before was the paragon of all trade of merchandise not the like in the vniuersal world to be found was fallen now become thus sodainly desolate ruined
againe there were certaine gouernours officers of great authority wealth who first considering of the horrible effect tenure of the letters manifestly declaring yt in case there were any man that would oppose himself against the meaning of those letters not ayde the inquisitors for the accomplishing of their commssion that he whatsoeuer he was should be deposed from his estate another placed in his roome next of al they seeyng the fury and wrath of the people to be greatly moued through such disorderly charges and tyrannies and become so outragious mad that they would not spare any magistrate or officer whatsoeuer

and last of all considering that they coulde not with a good conscience in such a case be both plantifes iudges they were fully resolued to yeelde vp their offices into the kings hands if he purposed to persist in that his intended opinion

on the otherside the ancient enemies of the house of burgoin woulde in no wise let slip this occasion but carefully and sounded the heartes of the enhabitaunts of this low countrey to see if they could by any meanes possible make them shake off their sidelitie from their prince lord hauing gotten men for that purpose to she we vnto them howe insupporlable a bondage that is by which all other franchifes priuiledges and other ordinaunces are defaced and broken and that there shoulde be other lawes and statutes appointed after the manner of spaine which should haue full power and authoritie ouer their moueable and vnmouable goods their wiues and children yea that all the goodes which they haue so long possessed should now be no longer theirs but shoulde themselues also be brought into flauerie and bondage howebeit they tolde them that this thing shoulde not take effect before such time as his maiestie shoulde submit himselfe vnto the inquisition
neither did they forget to shewe the great dammage and losse whiche the countrey was like to receiue through the want of the recourse and company of the marchantes seeing that marchandize is the very nurse of these prouinces and that by reason of the trade thereof in other partes the enhabitantes of the lowe countreys should be ready to starue and that which is more that the bondage of conscience wherunto they shoulde be alwayes tyed was nowe concluded vppon
moreouer they compared all these thinges to other prouinces and regions with their franchises and liberties saying that these prouinces farre passed all other in trade of marchandise and goodnesse of ground and further tolde them of the great commoditie which other prouinces receiued from these lowe countreys and coulde not be without them
neuerthelesse their fidelitie and constant loyaltie to their prince was so great and wrought so in them as that they gaue no eare to such suborners but aduertised the magistrate to be ware of this fetch and drift and preueut it howbeit they were no whit the more abashed for all this neither knewe they what was best for them to do or what best to be left vndone

now for the better vnderstanding of the cause why

and in what fort these new bishops were erected we are to know yt the priestes inquisitors for their better assurance of ye bringing in of the inquisition into king philips dominions considering that certaine ecclesiasticall prelates in some measure fauoured the protestants and were in great authoritie and very rich they therefore greatly enuied them for it
for which cause the inquisitors imagined to erect a newe estate of prelates and to deuide the archbishopricks bishopricks abbaies pryories into many partes
and to this ende in the yeere
was appointed at the request of king philip by the exclesiasticall estate francis sonnius a doctor in and sent to rome

who hauing set foorth the noblensse of the lowe countries and the great riches of the ecclesiasticall prelates there wrought his matters so wisely as that hee compassed this much that pope paule the
of that name by the aduise of seuen cardinalles appointed for that put pose gaue the saide sonnius audience and graunted him his demaund
whereupon they tooke from the archbishopricke of coloigne whose dyocesse was ouerlarge ye bishoprick of vtrecht made ye same an archbishoprick wherunto they subiected fiue other bishops to wit the bishoprick of deuenter in the countrie of tranfisselaine the bishopricke of harlem in holland the bishopricke of leauwarden in friseland the bishopricke of middlebourgh in zealande and the bishoprick groening in the countrie of wedde
all which plates are farre distant from the citie of coloigne neither doe their languages agree with them of coloigne and therefore the sentences pronounced at coloigne could not wel bee vnderstood by the lowe countrie men
and again the citie of coloigne was so farre thence as that it was an eight dayes iourney in passing and very chargeable and besides the bishop of coloigne had not kept his ordinary disitations long time before
and therfore for the moderating and qualifiyng heereof they erected iuto an archbishoprick because it stood in the midst of the other suffragane bishopricks
besides they exected the bishoprick of cambray into an archbishoprick wherunto they
other suffragane bishopricks to wit in artois the bishoprick of arras and the bishoprick of omer in tournois

the bishopricke of tournay in the countrse of namur the bishoprick of namur
they also erected the of rumold at malines into an archbishopricke wherunto they subiected
bishops to wit in braband the bishopricke of antwerp the bishopricke of boysleducke in gelderland the bishopricke of rurmond in flaunders the bishopricke of gaud the bishopricke of bruges the bishaprick of ypres there was appoyured to euery one of these new bishoprickes for the maintenance of the estate sixe thousand florins of yeerelyre~t but to the bishopricke of malines ten thousand
now for the more and better assigning out of these
thousa~d florins there were certaine suffraganeships of catheal churches conuertedinto bishopricks

if the reuenue of the suffraganeship amou~ted not vnto
florins as aforesaid the rest was assigned out of the abbeyes next adioyning
but because the citie of tyrwine and the cathedrall therof were in the former destroyed razed that diocesse was equally divided amongest thiee bishoprickes for that part that was in flaunders was assigned to the bishopricke of ypres and that part that lay in artois to the bishopricke of omer and that part which lay in fraunce to the bishoprick of boloigne

now this diuision of suffragane vishopricks vnder the archbishoprickes was made to this end that euery archbishopricke should haue within it self one selfe same language to wit eyther wallonish flennsh or els guelderlish
it was also appointed in euery of these cathedral churches

that the niene which were first voyde shatilde be assigned after this manner to wit three vnto noble men three to diuines and three to canonistes vpon condition that they shoulde assist the bishoppe in the inquisition but chiefly and especially the diuines and canonists of which
of the auncientest learnedest diuines should be inquisitors
these me for their payne trauel aduanceme~t of the religion next vnto the deane shoulde haue the first voyce in the chapter au hundred florins wages
furthermore that no pastor of any church should be amnitted except be were first examined by a doctor of diuinitie and a canonist and by them found to be a meere man for that purpose
that euery bishopps which should be abseut from his bishopricke by the space of
moneths

vnles he were sent by the pope or the prince in some commission or embassadge should lose his reuenue for that time cue aswell as any of the rest of the canons
lastly that the archebishopricke of malines shoulde bee chiefe aboue the rest that the archbishop which was legatus natus should be there resident abiding in his owne person yt he might be alwaies neere vnto ye kings court at bruxelles which preferme~t lopin ye cardinal of granuelle had got for himselfe
that the king should haue ye nomination of the bishops and the pope the confirmation

but because we might the better vnderstand to what ende all this geare tended haue thought it very expedient and good to set downe the
articles that were inuented practised by the spanish inquisition to the end they might inuade get and tyra~nize the belgique prouinces which articles were found in the house of hessels a councellour of the councell of troubles by which euery ma may easily perceiue the good wil they beare vnto the low countries to the prosperity welfare of our co~mon weale as hereafter in the drift purpose of this historie by the resolution or determination of the inquisition confirmed at madrid
the
of febr
by the sentence of his maiesty against the low countries manifestly may appeare
articles and determinations of the spanish inquisition for the inuading getting and tyrannizing of the lowe countries
the moste sacred or holie office of the inquisition so often times by his maiestie attempted in the low countries and euen vnto this verie present stayed and hindered shall by this moste expedient manner of dealing bee instituted and aduaunced
first the exring and wickedly confederating emperor with the heretikes muste bee perswaded to resigne ouer vnto his sonue all the dominions terretories and full gouernment of the lowe countries
for wee haue hitherto too too vainely gone about our businesse with the emperour but we shal at our pleasure deale wel inough with his young and simple sonne concerning this holy inquisition

secondly soone after that the emperour and his two sisters

haue giuen ouer their charges left the lowe countries and god ten themselues into spaine wee may assnre our selues that they mill not returne thence to hurte the sequele of our proceedings

thirdly these beeing dispatched it shal behoue vs also to remoue the king from vs and so deale with him as that hee neuer returne thence and that no fleming bee suffered to haue accesse vnto him or yet speake with him
fourthly that the king shal write and send vnto the orders of the clear gie men of the low countries to accept fifteene new bishops with the inquisition who shall haue free power ouer all seculer iurisdiction yea euen to deale in matters of high treason
fiftly the subiectes of the low countries by reason of their malice and ouer full fed will reuoult rayse commotions and tumultes agreeing to all thinges sauing vnto those that wee bring in
sixtly the princes and nobles with the chiefe leaders and authours of these factions as also the subiects may heereupon by some slie and subtill dealing bee dispatched of their liues and the rest brought into good frame and order
seuenthly we will at our owne perill like of the reauers robbers of all churches and images and by some subtill shifte or other make all the woride impute the fault thereof vnto the rebelles and so by that meane wee shall get the vpper hande of them
eightly wee will ouerthrowe all trafficke trade of merchaudise riches wealth liberties and priueleges and bring them all vnto extreeme beggerie and so by this meane the realme shall be euer ours
nienthly there shall none in all the low countries except those of our faction bee thought worthie to liue so that in the ende wee will roote out from amongest them all goods landes occupations and all good order and make a new kingdome and new people thereof

tenthly for accomplishing of this office and dealing the wise and valiant duke of alba shall be personally present and in regard of him no man els shall bee esteemed of no although he

bee of the king or princes blood and that if any of them be suspected of neuer so small a crime they shall bee by cunning depriued of their liues

eleuenthly that no contracts lawes promises pardons othes priuiledges and solemne grauntes of the lowe countries shalbe to the inhabitants thereof of any effect but bee founde all as giltie of high treason
twelfthly aboue all things great heede must be had that in these so waightie causes matters of so great importance there bee no violent dealing all at once but faire and easily and by lietle and little in very good order to the ende the princes nobles communaltie might fal our amongst themselues and one persecute another insomuche that the persecutor himselfe might fall into the grinne
for in all christendome there is not a more foolishe and indiscrete nation and more easily to bee deceiued then the fleming whose infidelitie god by this meane will punish

in the yeere the inquisitors other their complices with the helpe of pope paul the

went about to put in practise the establishing of the newe bishops but they were as yet withstood and put of by the estates
wherupon they of ye low countrie exhibited their supplications and complaintes vnto the king for the staying of the same howbeit they tooke smal effect which thing when the noble men of ye low countrie saw they thought this change of the ecclesiasticall estate to bee very strange and perceiued it to tend to none other end but to ye bringing in of the spanish inquisition into the lowe countrie
whereupon they again made their suplications and complaints vnto the dutches of parma gouernesse of the low countrie for the king vnto the yeere
in which yeere they were very desirous to see an end of the troubles and ciuill warres in fraunce in the meane while continually beseeching the saide lady regent to intreat his maiestie for some moderation which shee receiued in the yeere
afterward they besought that they might obteme the same libertie that the french had obteined at the handes of their king considering that the french king had neuer brought his realm vnto that peace and quietnes neither yet his subiects vnto that obedience but by the graunting of them the libertie of

conscience and exercise of religion according to the edict made at orleance and therefore they besought his catholique maiestie to graunt vnto them the same grace and fauour
after that the principall lords had shewed and laid open the ancient priuileges and liberties the oth of the king the chedience of the subiects vnto his maiestie the concord of the countrye and the great number of the protestants they obtained release of the rigorous commissions and a surceasing of the inquisition wherupon the troubles for the more part were appeased which thing greatly displased the cleargie men but especially the cardinal granduelle for they saw their purpose made voide and the worde of god aduanced with increase of a great number of people which frequented the sermons
which thing caused the cardinall of gra~uelle haste him into spaine and neuer gaue ouer vntill such time as he had set all his affaires in good order and brought the to passe euen as he would

ouer and besides all this

there arriued at the court of spaine certaine ambassadours from the councell of trent seut from the inquisitors who aduertised his maiestie of all that was concluded vpon in the saide councel euen from the beginning vnto the end which was in ianuarie
whereupon his catholike maiestie was persuaded and induced to publishe those decrees and cause them to be kept from point to point and to this end sent he them into the lowe countries that they might there take effect as also into all other countries vnder his subiection with expresse commandement vnto the dutches of parma that she should with all diligence establish the inquisition go orderly on with it as by the copie of the letters here set downe manifestly appeareth

margaret by the grace of god dutches of parma plaisance ladie regent and gouernesse

right deare and welbeloued although sithence the beginning of the gouernment of my lord the king heereabout in the low conntries as well by the renuing and publication of the commissions and ordinances of the late of most famous memory my lorde charles the emperour now reasting in the glory

of god about the cause and state of religion ratified and confirmed by his royall maiestie as also that which fithence he wrote vnto you of by the same euen at his last departure from these countries vuto his realmes of spaine you haue been alwaies able to vnderstande his maiesties good zeale and most holy affection for the preseruation of our auncient true catholike faith religion and the rooting out of all ye sects heresies here about in the lowe countries yet not withstanding seeing it hath pleased his saide maiestie by reason of certaine occasions to put vs againe in minde by his last letters of his most holy intent and purpose wee by his expresse charge and commandement are very desirous to impart vnto you that which he hath writte vnto vs the effect whereof is this much that his maiestie desiryng nothing more then the conseruation of the saide religion and the keepng of his good subiects hereabout in good tra~quilitie peace vnity and concord and to preserue them from al inconueniences which we see to happen in diuers places of christendome by reason of the alteration of the said religion his maiesties meanyug and intent is that the sayd commissions and ordinances of his late imperyal maiestie and his be entyrely and wholy obserued and kept as also his maiesties meaning is that they truely and straitly obserue all whatsoeuer the holy councell of trent and prouinciall sinodes haue established as touching the reformation set downe by the cleargie without contradiction or gaine saying thereof to the end that in punishing the heresies maners also may be reformed and amended and besides that the inquisitors of the faith may haue all the fauour and assistaunce that can bee about the executing of their offices and that the inquisitors shall deale with their said inquisition euen as they haue beene vsed to bee dealt withall vnto this present both by the lawes of god and men which thing his maiestie also expresly commandeth by his sayd letters
and accordyng to this answere of hys maiesty as also for the obeying thereof in so holy and fauourable a thyng we could not forget to wryte this vnto you to beseech requyre you in his maiesties behalf straitly to charge you to gouerne guide you herein according to hys maiesties ordina~ce wout crossing ye same in any one point or article yt you let all officers lawiers of ye principal cities of

prouince to vnderstand the same to the ende they may therein frame themselues accordingly without dissimulation or tolleration vppon paine of the punishment contained within the saide commissions
and for your better vnderstanding hereof you shall charge and depute a councellour of your colledge who neuerthelesse may bee changed from halfe yere to halfe yere because one man should not always stand charged with the same that shall doe nothing els but haue an eye to the saide countrie in regard of the obseruing of the decrees of the said holy counsaile and alwayes aduertise you of whatsoeuer commeth to hand that you may therein make prouision according to his maiesties said meaning
and for as much as wee might alwayes vnderstand the state of the religion accordingly as hath beene before saide we beseech and will you as aforesaide that you write particulerly vnto vs from three monethes to three monethes of the successe therein hauing alwayes recourse vnto vs in any case of controuersie or to som of his maiesties priuie counsaile that may make report thereof vnto vs vnto whome also wee will giue the like charge and shall haue a perticuler care thereof and agree with you and him whom you shal put in trust in euery condition touching the same
and to the end you may the better see the expres will of his saide maiestie concerning all the thinges aforesaide wee haue caused to bee annexed vnto this the pointes of the letters of the rest of his maiesties writings touching this matter that you might according to the forme and tenure of the same order your selfe without committing of any errour therein
and thus for the present right deare and welbeloued commit you to god

from bruxelles the
of december

and vnderneath was written margaret and vnderneath it signed oue'rloope
the superscription was to our right deare and welbeloued the presidents and counsellours of the king in christ

an abstract of the kings last letters and writings sent to my ladie the dutches with the last dispatch as touching the state of religion

first concerning as well the old as the new commissions and ordinances of the said state of religion his maiestie vnderstanding in what state and condition the matters of religion heere about stood it was not meete that any change should bee made of the said commissions and ordinances but that the said commissions of the late imperial maiestie and also his maiesties should be put in execution
and so his maiestie might perceiue that the occasion why this mischiefe encreased and went so far was by the negligence loosenes and hypocrisie of the iudges
and that seeing there were some iudges who either durst not or els woulde not put them in execution for feare of tumult or vprore that his maiestie might be counselled to prouide for men there that were of greater courage and more zealous to take in ha~d the said execution whereof could be no want in those countries where were so many catholiques that desired to serue god and his maiestie and that in so doing executing of the said commissions it was to bee hoped that the harme which grew thereby might by that meanes be the soner and better remedied then any way els
for the second which concerned the inquisitors of the faith his maiesty charged her highnes to hold such an hand on the matter as that the inquisitors myght find fauour as touchyng the exercise administratio of their charge in whatsoeuer was meete for the benefit and maintenance of the religion his maiestie hauing this meaning yt the inquisitors should deale with the sayde inquisition as it was wonted to bee dealt with all euen vnto that present both by the lawes of god men that this was no new or strange matter seeing it had bin alwaies so vsed fro the time of the late imperial maiestie and his the inconueniences which they ouer much feared being mamfester neerer at hand and far greater in not foreseeing vnto those things which were behouefull for the office of the inquisitors and for theyr assistance
and sith her highnes might wel see that which this matter imported his maiestie gaue her in charge that shee shoulde as much as in

her lay do that that was so necessary neuer yeeld to haue any other thing then it to be dealt in seeing her highnes knew how neere it touched his heart and what pleasure and contentation it would bring him

thirdly his maiestie willed her highnes that seeing the holy counsell of trent was now published and that ther remained nothing els to be done but the setting vp of the new erected bishops yt her highnes would put to all the possible help she could for the effectuall and conuenient proceeding thereof
and that she shold also see the ordena~ce of the councell of trent executed about the reformation of the liues maners of the cleargie by which both his maiesty her hignes and all other his maiesties officers were charged to shew al their fauour help as far as was needfull in yt behalf
if so be it should so fall out as that his maiestie should be driuen to make prouision for the same that it shoulde foorthwith dispatch euen amongest those cleargie men whiche woulde not submit themselues to the reformation set downe by the bishops agreeing with ye decree of the said councel of trent
and in the end this was the closing vp of altogether that the thing which his maiesty wrote to her highnes of as aforesaid was most conuenient for the benefite of the religion and the countries thereabout which without it were of no valure because that the religion was it that must bee the locke and key to censerue them in their right keepe them in peace rest and quietnes
and seeing that her highnes saw the great importance thereof his maiesty againe required her to take that course because as hee said it would be the thing that he best liked of and would cause him to thinke the better both of her highnes and also of the lordes that were about her whom of very right she ought to charge to bestow their paine and trauell about the same according to ye trust which his maiesty reposed in them wherin they right wel knew that they shoulde not onely greatly content please him but also doe such offices duties therm as became such noble estates as they are and so acquite discharge that bonde wherein they stand bound for the seruice of god his maiestie the common weale of the lowe countries thereabout and theyr owne particuler benefite

many of the nobilitie beeing greatly abashed and amazed at

this his maiesties charge and commandement and foreseeing a most assured and vtter desolation necessarily following the execution of this his excellencies and her highnes determinations so wisely dealt with the dutches of parma in that matter as yt in the end shee sent the counte egmont towardes the kyng of spaine giuing him charge commission to seek by al meanes possible the mittigation of his maiesties heart in getting him to cease the inquisition in the cou~tries thereabout
whe the cou~te was returned out of spain he brought letters thence with him to the dutches charging her to deuise some sound fit meanes for the quiet tranquility of the country alwayes prouided that the catholike religion should in no wise be empayred
for performyng wherof she appointed
bishops three doctors who were wel seene both in dininitie and also in the ciuill cannon lawes that they myght be the better able to discerne iudge of such as were accused of heresie
but because this seemed to be ouer weake a moderation tendyng to the abasing of princes amongst theyr subiects the inquisition was a fresh brought in established co~mandeme~t giuen yt the decrees of the councell of trent should be obserued a seuere proceeding has agaynst the aforesayd supplya~ts
nowe as the co~mon people were heereat greatly troubled perplexed the nobilitie were determined to declare vnto her highnes the mischiefe that therupon might ensue protesting yt they had sufficiently discharged the duty of loyall subiects vassals vnto his maiestye if for want of such prouision therein as they had deuised any ruine or desolatio shold arise vnto ye cou~try
and for this end purpose there met at bruxelles the
of april about
gentlemen exhibited to her highnes this supplication here set downe

the speeches which the of brederode vsed vnto the lady regent before he deliuered vp the supplication

madame the gentlemen in this city here assembled

and the rest of the same condition and qualitie who are not in number fewe haue not met and stayed here together for any other respects then for the seruice of the prince and common weale of ye low cou~tries in most hu~ble wise to exhibite vnto your highnes this supplicatio vpo ye view sight wherof it may please you to take such order as by ye same may seem co~uenie~t beseeching your

highnes to take it in good part
ouer and besides this madame we are let to vndersta~d that we are charged before your highnes the lords of the councel and others that our chiefe determination hath been to stir vp tumults to cause reuolts and to make sedition and that which is most detestable they haue charged vs that we goe about to change the prince by practising of leagues and conspiracies with strange princes and captaines as well frenche germanes as others which thing we neuer once thought of and is the very thing in deed that is cleane contrary to our fidelitie and allegeance and that your highnesse shall find by readyng ouer this supplication most humbly beseeching your highues by the way to shew vs so much fauor as to discouer and name vnto vs those persons who haue so vniustly slaundered so noble and honorable a companie

and besides this madame the lordes here present are let to vnderstand that there are some of them particulerly accused and charged to haue lift vp their hands gone about to put in execution the aboue said wicked enterprise as well with the french as also with other strangers wherewith we finde our selues not a little greeued and therefore we most humbly beseech your highnes to do vs ye good pleasure to name vnto vs both the accusers the accused to the end yt the wrong wicked deed being discouered your highnes may make thereof a quicke and speedy exa~ple of iustice whereby you may meete with the mischiefes hurt yt therby might fall out assuring our selues yt your highnes wil neuer suffer so noble honorable a co~panie to stand vniustly charged with so shamefull wicked attempts

the supplication of the nobilitie of the low countries exhibited to the dutches of parma and plaisance

madame it is right well knowne as presently also may bee seene that the great fidelitie of the people of the low countries towards their lords naturall princes hath euer al christendome ouer bin highly renowmed in which alleageance the nobilitie haue alwayes been chiefe as men who neuer made any reckoning eyther of their bodies or goods for the increasing of theyr princes honour and glorie
wherein wee his maiesties most humble vassals entende by the grace of god for euer to continue from good to better insomuche as wee

will day and night be ready both with our bodies and goodes most humbly to serue him and therefore we seeing vppon what termes the state presently standeth haue rather chosen to take a little fault vpon our selues then to conceale such thinges as hereafter might turne to his maiesties hurt and so eftsoones trouble the peace and quietnes of these countries trusting that the effect will in time shew that of all the seruices which wee might haue done or may doe in time to come vnto his maiestie this which now we are about will be thought to be the notablest to greatest purpose whereupon wee assuredly perswade our selues that your highnesse will not but take it in good part
although then madam we doubt not that what soeuer his maiestie hath heretofore yea and at this present doeth ordeine for the cause of the inquisition and the straite obseruing of the commissions vpon the state of the religion hath not had any sound ground and iust title and so continue the same whiche the late emperour charles of famous memorie had vpon a good meaning stayed yet neuertheles seeyng that the difference of times bringeth therewith diuersity of remedies yt although not many yeeres sithence ye said co~missions for al this were not rigorously executed yet haue they giue occasio to breed many grieuous inco~uenie~ces
surely his ma last determinatio where in he did not only forbid yt any moderation of ye said co~missions should be had but also gaue expresse co~mandeme~t yt the inquisition shoulde be obserued the co~missions most sharply executed giueth vs very iust occasion to feare yt therby not onely the said inconueniences may come grow but that there may also in the end a generall commotion ensue therof tending to the miserable destruction of the whole countrie as the manifest tokens of the alteration of the people which euery where may be perceiued layeth it wide open before our faces wherfore we knowing ye manifest likelihood greatnes of the danger which threaten vs were in good hope euen vntil nowe yt eyther the nobility or els the estates of the countrey woulde at some co~uentent time haue made supplication vnto your highnes to the end some remedy might haue byn fou~d for the same by taking away ye cause original of the mischief therfore after we had seene that they were therein nothing foreward vppon what

occasions we know not and that in the meane while the sore dayly increased and grew woorse and woorse insomuch that the danger of a generall commotion reuolt was euen at the doore haue thought it our duetie according to the othe of our fidelitye and alleageance and with al the honest and good zeale which we beare vnto his ma to the cause no longer to stay but rather to be the very first to set for ward a matter of so necessary and needful a duty so much the freelier and readilier by how much we haue the greater occasion to hope yt his ma wil take our aduertisement in very good part considering that it toucheth vs more neerely then any of the rest because we are such as are soonest to be thrust out vnto all inconueniences and miseries which commonly arise vpon the like accide~ts hauing for the more part our houses goodes situating being abroad in the countrey and therfore lying as a pray for al the worlde considering also that in the geuerall pursuing of the sharpnes of the saide commissio~s as his ma had giuen expresse commandement for their proceeding there should not one ma amo~gst vs no not one in al ye countrey hereabout of what estate condition soeuer he were which should not be found guilty of the losse both of body and goods subiect to the slaunder of the first enimy that came who to haue part of the spoyle would vnder the colour of the commissions accuse any whatsoeuer leauing none other refuge vnto ye partie but the onely fauour of the officer into whose mercy both his life goods should be thrust
in consideration whereof wee haue so much ye greater occasion most humbly to beseech your highnes and that by this our supplication to take some good order herein
and because it is a matter of importance that it would please you assoone as might be possible to dispatch and send some carefull and meete man towardes his ma to aduertise him on our behalfe most humbly beseech him that it would please him to forsee for the same as well presently as for the time to come
and because the same cannot be done by letting the said commissions to stand in their ful strength considering that theron hangeth the originall of the saide inconueniences that it would please him to harken to the abolishing of them which wil be the very necessary meane to withdraw the whole destruction and ouerthrowe from all these countries hereabout

and to the end hee should not haue any occasion to think that we who haue none other purpose but to yeeld him our most hu~ble obedience would goe aboute to bridle him or els otherwise force him to make such lawes as pleased vs as we doubt not but that our aduersaries will interprete our meaning to the worst yt it would please his maiestie to make other ordinances by ye aduise and consent of all the estates in generall assembled together to the end the things abouesaid might be foreseene and preuented by other meet conuenient meanes without such most euident dangers

most humby also beseechyng your highnes yt when as his maiestie shall haue vnderstood of our iust petition ordered ye same as shal seeme good vnto his good and iust wil and pleasure that it woulde please him in the meane while to prouide for the foresaid dangers by a generall surceasing aswel of the said inquisitio as also of al the executions of those commissions vntill such time as his maiesty hath set some other order therein
expresly protesting that asmuch as to vs apperteineth and belongeth we haue discharged our selues of our duty by this present aduertisement so that now we haue acquited our selues both before god the world declaring that if so be any inconuenience disorder co~motion reuolt or bloodshed hereafter shal fal out about this matter for want of finding out of a remedy for the same in due time season that we are not to be found fault with and blamed as men hauing concealed so apparant a mischiefe wherein we take god the king your highnes the lordes of the counsell our owne consciences to witnes that wee haue proceeded as hath become the kings good loyall seruants faithful subiects without exceeding the bounds of our duties whereupo also we so much the more insta~tly beseech your highnes to vnder stand the same before such time as any other mischiefe aryseth theron
in doyng whereof you shall doe right well

of aprill
before easter

the answere which the ladie regent made in the counsel of estate to this supplication is this that followeth

when her highnesse had vnderstood the contents of the supplication she was fully purposed to send messengers with the same vnto his maiestie to doe him all the good offices yt her highnes could deuise which might any way serue to dispose incline his maiestie to condiscend vnto ye request of the petitioners who neuer looked for any thing but for that that was worthie agreeing vnto his natural accustomed benignitie howbeit her highnes had alreadie before the comming of the aforesaid suppliants by the help and aduice of the gouerners of the prouinces knights of the order and councell that were with her trauelled to deuise and set downe a moderation of the commission for the state of religion to be exhibited vnto his maiestie which moderation her highnes hoped should be such as in dutie should reasonably content euery man
and seeing yt her highnes autoritie as the supplia~ts might very wel co~sider of vnderstand exte~ded not so far as to be able to surcease the inquisition and commissions according to their desire that it was vnfit to leaue the countrie in the matter of religion without law her highnesse had this good co~fidence in the petitioners yt they would be contented with her sending vnto his maiestie to the end aforesaid and in the meane while yt she looked for answer her highnes would take order that the inquisitors where there were any as yet remaining as also the officers should haue respect to deale so discretely soberly in their charges as that no man shold haue cause to co~plaine her highnes also trusted yt the suppliants likewise would so behaue the~selues as that ther should be no need otherwise to vse ye same and it was wel to be hoped that her hignesse would deale so dutifully towards his maiestie as that he would be contented to difcharge the rest of the inquisition where shee was so far foorth as shee was able to vnderstand as had alreadie been declared by the supplication of the chiefe cities of brabant that they should not be charged therewith
and that her hignesse would so much the more franckly dispose her selfe to doe all good offices vnto his maiestie to the end and effect aforesaid because shee did assure her selfe that the suppliants were purposely determined not to make any innouation about the auncient religio obserued in the countries here about but the same to maintaine obserue with all their power and might

whereunto the nobilitie replied the
aprill as followeth

madame after wee had seen read your highnes answere se~t vnto vs we could not but first of al most hu~blie thank the same for the speedie dispatch thereof but especially for the contentment and good liking whiche your highnes had of this our assemblie which was for none other cause saue onely for the seruice of his maiestie and the common good tranquillitie of the countrey
and for the greater contentation and quiet of the same countrey wee woulde haue been very glad that your graces said answere had been set downe more largely and plainly neuertheles sith your highnesse as we vnderstande hath not nowe that autoritie that we would be glad you had for the which we are right sorie yet we trust vpon the hope and assurance whiche your highnes hath giuen vs that you will set suche an order therein aswel amongst the magistrates as amongst the inquisitors as shal enioyne them to stay al suits commenced by ye inquisition or by any eyther of the old or yet of the newe edictes or commissions vntill suche time as his maiestie hath taken some other order about them
and seeing wee for our parte madame desire nothing els but to followe whatsoeuer his maiestie with the aduise and consent of the generall estates assembled shall ordayne for the maintenance of the ancient religion wee trust so to behaue our selues as that your highnes shall haue no occasion to be displeased if any one commit any grieuous or seditious fact let your highnes and those of the counsell of the estate appoint such chastisement as the desert of the fact requireth
and we here againe protest that if any inconuenience herevpon doth arise for want of good order set herein that wee haue satisfied and perfourmed our duetie most humblie beseeching your highnesse to haue good liking of this our bounden dutie and receiue it as our seruice for his maiestie offring our selues to remaine your highnes most humble obedient seruances to die at his feet in his seruice whensoeuer it shal please your highnesse to command vs

the marques of bergues the baron of mountigni were by the common aduise of the counsel of estate sent towards his ma into spayne in the meane while there was some mitigation release of the accustomed sharp dealing but yet they of the reformed religion continued their assemblies in houses by small numbers attending his maiestyes wil and pleasure

nowe a litle before that the nobility of the countrey had exhibited this supplication her highnes suspecting some mischiefe by reason of the assembly of the nobility had made the woorst market of the matter that possibly she could haue deuised had it not beene that some of the counsell encouraged and comforted her emongst whom was one man especially which as it is said was the lord of barlaymont who sayde vnto her tush tush

madame bee not dismaid neither feare these gueses for there are wayes and meanes enowe both to ouerthrow them vtterly roote them out

and after that one of the chiefe of that company drunke at bruxelles the fift of aprill in such another dishe and when he had drunke hee cryed uiue les gueux

morouer in signe and token of their wonderfull fidelitie towardes their prince they did weare about their neckes the picture of king phillip some grauen in golde some in siluer on the backside of the same picture was the figure of hande in hande with the clappe dishe and wallet and about it this deuise fideles an roy insgues a la besace that is faythfull vnto the king euen vnto beggers state
they had also copper counters on the one side of which was engrauen escu de viane that is the shielde or armes of viane and on the other side per feu et flammes to wit through the hoate burning fire and flamme with the armes of the house of burgome

in the moneth of may the yeere

the inquisition and commissions surceased and besides all magistrates and officers were forbidden the exercise and execution of them against the subiectes vpon payne of the punishmentes conteyned in the commissions

but as a fire long time kept in waxeth very hoate after bursteth out into great fiery flammes euen so they of the religion hauing this aduantage and being no longer able to keepe in beganne to manifest them selues and make common and open assemblies first in lowe flanders and soone after at antwerp where they beganne openly to preach the
of iune being iohns day in the aforesayde yeere about a quarter of a myle out of the citie
shortly after they of tournay followed and so likewise did many other cities of hollande zelande brabant flanders and other places
the number of them came to the assemblies so dayly encreased as that a man woulde haue thought the people had come to a fayre or market when after long dearth great store of corne had been brought thither
nowe for the first preaching that was at antwerpe the people resorted thither without their forbidden weapons
but when they were aduertised of a conspiracie entended agaynst them they beganne contrary to the kinges and regentes proclamations to carry them for their defence agaynst the inuasion and furie of the conspirators
but after they were come backe into the citie they layde them away and in the meane tyme besought the chiefe officers eyther to grannt them some guard or defence agaynst those people or els suffer them to meete together within the citie that they might not bee thrust out into any such danger and in case they woulde so doe they woulde altogether lay away their weapons

in this meane while

the prince of orange was entreated to come to antwerpe to preuent the troubles that were like to ensue
and when he was come for that purpose hee trauelled by verye instant orations to cause the preachinges cease for three weekes or a moneth

in which tyme hee put them in good hope that the generall estates woulde meete togeather for purueying

for the same
but forsomuch as they of the religion forsaw not any good to arise by this surceasing but an assured occasio of trouble and muteny amongest the people which coulde in no wise abyde to be spoyled of the benefit that they tasted of by preaching and that this surceasing would turne to an vtter abolishing therof because the estates had not met together as also experie~ce had taught them besides many other reasons it was tolde vnto his excellency that it was neither reasonable dealing with god nor yet expedient for the common benefite of the to surcease the said preachings
and so by this meanes the exercise of the religion was contynued
and as for the bearing of weapons when as they of the religion had shewed in what daunger they stood by their meeting together out of the city without weapons it was told them that they might very wel vse them whiles they were in their assemblies but that they should leaue them without and not bring them backe againeinto the citie wherwithal they were very wel contented therein more and more shewing their simplicitie in not looking into the waranting of the~selues their wiues and children against these helhoundes that then lay abroade

the

of august solemne processions of our ladie of antwerp were made after the old custom wherin they carried about with them the image of our ladie garnished and apparrelled in cloth of gold with many other precious iewels as if she had been a queene

this image was carried about by the worshipfullest men of the citie alwayes changing them at certayne quarters and crosse wayes of the streetes
there were at that tyme at the prince of drange his house the princesse his wife his brother the count lewys and many other gentlemen to beholde this solemne festiuall procession
when this solemne procession was ended the image was set vp in the midst of the church as it was wonted to be where it was accustomed to stande vntill the saterday following
but because my masters of the chapiter feared some disorder to come by reason of certayne wordes that ye people spake in ye time of ye processio saying marie marie the carpenters wife this shall he thy last festiuall day shee was

taken away and setup againe the tewesday following in her owne chappell where she was wont to stande

the
of august the prince departed from antwerpe

and went to bruxelles to the endelto receiue with the rest of the counsell of the estate an answere which her highnesse had promised to make to the deputies of the nobles the
or
of that instant by reason of a supplication which they had exhibted tending to the withstanding of the apparant troubles and commotions in the countreys

nowe as they continued in maner and fourme as aforesaide in their common and publike sermons certaine of lowe flanders began to put downe ye idols and images which thing was prosecuted in many cities of the countrey and amongst the rest at antwerpe with such assuraunce and diligence as if some man had had expresse commandement from the magistrate to execute suche an exployte with expedition
this defacing of images was the morrowe after that the prince was gone from antwerp to bruxelles which was on tewesday being the
of august about sixe of the clocke in the after noone and the occasion hereof grew by this meane that the sunday next before as afore is sayde a great image of the virgin marie was caried about in solemne procession which was wonted to be set vp and left in a certayne place of the temple for eyght dayes together about which euery man and woman according to their deuotion crept on their knees two or three times and on the tewesday following the priestes hauing shutte vp the church doores placed her agayne in her ordinary roome
and about two of the clocke in the afternoone there came to our ladies church certayne mariners and other yong fellowes and merueiling that they had so often remoued the image cryed out and sayde marie crie vine les gueux that is god saue the gueses wee will you the place with such other like pleasantiestes
they asked also the woman that was wonted to sell the waxe candles and gather vp the offrings why they had so often remooued the saide image and sayde further vnto her that shee might nowe shutte vp her shoppe well inough for there were none that woulde buie any of her marchandize

the woman mooued and grieued with these woordes cast

the ashes which shee had there in a pot into their eyes
whiles they were thus iesting and sporting there went to the towne house two substanciall men and tolde the magistrate of these tumultes and vprores the magistrate amazed with these newes went to the colledge and comming thence after he had paused there a while he went with the margraue accompanied with foure seriantes foure halberdiers and a great trayne of people vnto the church and when the boyes and young fellowes sawe the magistrate they went out of the churche and then beganne the magistrate to vse these discreete speeches vnto the people saying my good friendes pray you get you hence howebeit there was neuer a man that woulde once styrre so that hee was fayne to gette him out without any more to doe

soone after the young fellowes aforesayde came backe to the church with one of the captaynes of the guarde of the preachers shutting in the church doores fel a singing of psalmes which psalmes being sung euery man bega to pull down deface the images in so much that the very same night they had throwen downe the images not onely in the great temple called our lady church but also in all the rest yea and in all chappels cloysters where they made very great vnwonted caues as if they would haue drowned the hoggesheades of wine and beare after they had drunke more then ynough and carried away all the stoore of fleshe and of other prouision whiche they coulde lay handes on howebeit there were none that did thus but beggers women and wilde headed young fellowes
and besides they deliuered out of prison in the couente of the franciscane fryers a poore fryer that had been kept in prison
yeeres for the preaching of the trueth and deliuered also a french baker who had been a yeere and an halfe in the towne pryson for the religion and confession of the gospell

the wednesday and thursday following the worshipfull companies of liueries or brotherhoodes that had their alter or chappell in the aforesaide ladie church beganne to pull downe that that remayned and carried it out of the churche whereupon there were others that followed them in the same

church and also in the rest to pull downe also that whiche they had leaft and this was done as if they had had commission to doe it the magistrate not once setting him selfe agaynst them to defende it vntill at the last it came to passe that his maiesties armes were broken
but when the magistrate hearde of that

the borroughmaster stralen entered into ye church with a certayne number of mariners all shot who discharging their peeces draue away all the beggers and so shutte vp the churche doores

the tewesday in the euening the chiefe officers being troubled with these beginninges desired one of the ministers of the flemmish church to goe to the temple and exhorte those that had broken downe the images to leaue off
whereunto hee obeyed and going vp into the pulpit to that ende spake vnto them
but when he sawe that they woulde giue no eare vnto him hee for the auoyding of a greater mischiefe departed
neuerthelesse they of the religion were charged with this violence
whereupon also they were blamed for robberies and other insolences which thereon had ensued
inregarde whereof the sayde minister herman strycker of swelle went vp agayne into the pulpit of the sayde lady church on thursday in the morning being the
of august and there made a shorte collation vnto the people protesting in the first place that this violence of pulling downe of the images was done without the knowledge of the ministers and the rest who had the charge of the churche committed vnto them and in the seconde place disalowyng and detesting the spoyles pilferies and other insolences that had ensued and exhorted all such as had any of the pillage and spoyle to carrie it to the magistrate
and to knit vp the matter withall he admonished the people of the obedience that was due to the magistrate and of the concorde and peace requisite amongst the people

with this exhortation were many moued deliuered vp into the hands of the magistrate not only siluer crosses but also many gilt chalices other iewels telling their names surnames and dwelling places offring them selues to become if it were so the magistrates pleasure

howrbeit the magistrate receiued their iewelles and them for their fidelitie and loyaltie

the same day in the after noone the people notwithstanding that there were men set of purpose at the church doores to tell them that there shoulde be no sermon for they were in deed made to beleeue that there shoulde bee one yet for all that they came together in great numbers vnto the sayde church instantly desiring that they might haue a sermon insomuch that for feare of an vprore the minister which had exhorted them in the morning was fayne to get him vp agayne into the pulpit where hee made a reasonable long exhortation tending to the same end and purpose as in the morning
this tewesday being the
of august a great number of the citizens of antwerp both fleminges and walons had made the~selues ready to goe in the morning to bruxels towards the dutches of parma ladie regent of the lowe countrey to the ende to beseeche her that they might to haue a publike church in the citie of antwerpe for the exercise of their religion

the fryday following

being the
of august the ministers the rest who had the charge of the church of fleminges and walones committed vnto them for the effectuall purging of them selues of certayne slanders and to assure the chiefe officers of their affection good will exhibited vnto the boroghmaster verheyen the pencioner wesonbeck being assistant there with him the propositions and articles ensuing

to the ryght worshipfull the boroghmasters sheriffes and counsell of the citie of antwerpe
right worshipfull wee in trueth protest as before the lord that this pulling downe and abolishing of images hath been done without our knowledge and consent
and as for the pilferies pillages robberies and the other dissolute arrogant partes which haue followed wee mislike and abhorre

and therefore our meaning is that the ministers shall exborte

as they haue already done their auditorie in their sermons that they wholly abstayne from such kinde of dealing bring agayne into your possession that which hath beene fellonously taken away

they of our church are ready to yeelde themselues altogether obedient vnto your worshippes for the opposing of them selues by your commandement against all sackinges violences theftes and such other like insolences
for we acknowledge our selues to be established by the lord through the office of the magistrate and therefore are bound to obey you not onely for feare of punishment but also for conscience sake
and so consequently we ought and will faithfully paye all taxes tollages customes impostes subsidies tenthes and whatsoeuer charges els that shall bee layde vppon vs whether they be ordinary or extraordinarie confessing that they which shall refuse to doe it or deceiptfully deale in this behalfe shall offende god and are punisheable at your handes
and for the greater assuraunce of that that hath beene before sayde the ministers of the woorde and the reste whiche haue the charge of the gouernment of the churche committed vnto them are readie if neede bee to sweare vnto you to bee faithfull and obedient in all thinges according to the will of god and his woorde for the conseruation of the benefite and commoditie of the citizens and inhabitantes and also of the citie
beseeching you that vnder your authority and protection wee maye assemble our selues in some churches meete and able to receiue vs for the exercise of our religion and not take it in ill parte if we serue our turnes with any one of them according to the present necessitie attending vnti suche time as you haue purueyed for the same
in the meane while our meaning is not to inforce any mans conscience or constrayne them to receiue our religion contenting vs and praysing god that he hath giuen vs the meane to serue him after our manner of religion trusting that your will so prouide as that both one and other shall haue that that shall content them

and that it would please you to set downe an order that the one iniurie not nor offer violence to another about the cause of religion

this was exhibited in the name of the ministers of the woorde and of the rest of the gouernoures of the churches both of the fleminges and french the twentie fiue of august

the pencioner in the name of the said worshipful answered that they woulde communicate these propositions with the colledge
and that in the meane while they shoulde aduertise those of the religion on the behalfe of the chiefe officers not to come at two of the churches to wit the greate churche called our ladies churche and saint georges
that same euening the pencioner did let them vnderstande that the intente of the chiefe officers was that they shoulde abstayne from two other churches to witte from saint michaels and saynte iames as appeareth by a billet signed with his hande the tenure whereof ensueth

my maisters after had made report of your good will which appeared by that you had proposed together with the writing the same euening exhibited as was foorthwith enforced to departe for the cause you wote of the chiefe officers for certayne respectes and notable aduertisementes whiche sithence come haue commanded me that ouer and besides our ladie churche and georges that were this day named that you should like wise for the present abstaine from iames and michaels
which your obedience shall greatly please the magistrate and you therin shall shew your good willes
and so with my commendations end

in post haste the
of august

all yours iames of wesen becke pensioner of antwerpe

when they of the religion heard that they were forbidden the occuping of these foure churches aboue specified they

had conceiued this opinion that the magistrate woulde bee contented at the least to winke at the seruing of their turnes with the rest of the churches
wherefore they that spake flemish would needes preach on sunday morning being the
of august at the borough churche and the walonnes meant to preach at the iacopins

but the very same morning there came two gentlemen from the prince shewing them that they must at no hande haue recourse to anie of the churches howebeit that the chiefe officers coulde bee contented that they shoulde meete together in the newe towne
and for this purpose they deputed one of the sberiffes to goe and appoynt the wardes to suffer the people peaceably to passe as they went to the sermon in that place
but forsomuchas the fleminges were already assembled in great multitudes in the saide churches it was thought beste to let them alone for that morning vppon condition that they shoulde in the afternoone goe to the sermon in the newe towne as the walonnes did
who beeing not as yet gotten into the iacopins for they kepte the doores shut vppon them when as they heard that there was a discharge brought yt they shoulde not come in any church assembled themselues in the new towne by the authoritie and permission of the magistrate
nowe at that tyme was greete trouble in antwerpe as well by reason of the pulling downe of the images as also in regarde of the publique sermons whiche then serued in steede of masses insomuche that the whole citie kepte almoste continuall watche and warde and the gates and shoppes thereof were close shutte vppe
whiche was the cause that the prince of orange who as before is saide was gone to bruxelles made speedye returne to antwerpe the sixe and twentye of auguste with the charge as gouernour appoynted by his maiestye for the pacifiyng of the troubles

for the bringing of which to passe he caused two gentlemen to require at the handes of the two churches to witte the

fleminges and walonnes to depute ech of them foure wise skilfull personages who should communicate with his excellency what meanes were best to appease assure the people both of the one religion and of the other

to this charge were chosen and deputed for the fleminges marke peris charles of bombergue herman vander meere and cornelius of bombergue and for the walonnes frauncis godyn iohn carlier nicholas du vinier and nicholas sellyn
whiche eight deputies were allowed and authorized to this charge by the prince the
of august and by the chiefe officers the laste of the sayde moneth by their deedes graunted to these endes
nowe for the first conference his excellencie propounded to the sayde deputies these fifteene articles ensuing with the aunsweares to euerye of them exhibited by the sayde deputies in the name of both the churches and his excellencies aunsweares againe to euery of their answeares

to my lorde monsieur the prince
my lord forsomuchas in your excelle~cies absence we may haue some other his ma
liuetenant not endued with such wisedome iustice and affection vnto the common weale quiet of this citie as your selfe we are therfore inforced for our greater assurance in time to come to haue certayne poynts to vs propounded more particulerly to be cleared manifested which we woulde not thinke needful if wee were assured alwayes to haue to deale with your excellencie by reason of the great trust whiche we repose in the same
the first and second articles
first you shal be no let to the papists for their going to their churches neither yet trouble them for the hauing of such exercise of their religion as they shall thinke meete conuenient
you shall not preache in any churche but onely in the newe towne and that in suche places as shall bee assigned to you

the answeare
although the churches are common and free for all the burgesses and not particuler to the papistes yet doe wee promise neither to take nor occupie eyther by force or violence anye of them neyther yet trouble the papistes in the exercise of their religion
yet notwithstanding wee humblye beseeche your excellencie to appoynt vs some churche of theirs for the exercise of ours hauing regarde to the multitude and to the right that wee haue as citizens whiche wee can by no meanes loose by reason of the embracing of the doctrine of the gospell

the third artile
you shal haue but two preachers and those to be of the same countrey borne
the answeare
we pray that the number of the ministers may be according to the multitude of the people and that you will graunte vnto vs for the present necessitie at the least eight for the flemishe churche and three for the walonnes
for the rest wee agree that the ministers of the word shalbe of the same countrey borne the kings subiectes or receiued citizens in some good citie hereabout

the fourth article you shall not carrie any forbidden weapons vnto the sermons but shal lay downe at the princes feete al forbidden weapons
the answeare
as for the first poynt wee verily beleeue that his excellencies meaning is not but that it shalbe lawfull and free for euery of vs to weare a sworde and a dagger and that hee will not graunt a larger libertie vnto the rest then the said sword and dagger
and as for the seconde poynt which is to laye downe all forbidden weapons at the princes feete vnder correction it should seeme yt such a proposition concerning the priuiledges of the citie ought to be made generall to all citizens and inhabitants of the same

the fift you shall make a catalogue or rowle of all their names that bee of your churche and the prince shall call them before him to knowe of them if they had the same catalogue
the answeare
forsomuchas the libertie which we presently enioy is not confirmed by the king and ye generall estates therefore there are manie that will hardly graunt to haue their names in writing and withall it will be very harde to make such a catalogue as his excellencie desireth by reason of the great multitude of the people and therefore we beseech him not to take it in euill part if herein we satisfie not his desire but that hee may bee somewhat informed of the number beseeching his excellencie to appoynt commissioners for the viewing of the assemblies

the sixt you shall obey the magistrate and giue your attenda~ce for the conseruation of the co~mon weale accordingly as he shall appoynt
the answeare
vve agree to that alwayes prouided that the priuiledges be kept sound and without preiudice to the religion that now is permitted vnto vs

the seuenth
all such preachers as shal preach seditiously against the magistrate or others shalve driuen out and banished the citie
the answeare
vve agree to that so that the reprehending of false doctrine the abuse of ceremonies and corruption of manners bee not taken for seditious speeches and that the same which shalbee alleadged shall be duely verified by men worthy to be beleeued and vnsuspected and that al other preachers may bee subiect to the same law

the eight

you shal not change increase nor diminishe those that are

of your consistorie without the knowledge of the prince nor yet take in newe ministers

the answeare
for the more assuraunce and safetie of his excellencie wee beseeche that it woulde please him to depute one magistrate or other that professeth our religion vppon whose fidelitye your excellencie may rest who may be assistant to the choosing of the mininsters elders and deacons and to all the affayres which shall be dealt withall amongest them for the gouernment and rule of their church

the nienth
you shall not trouble nor laye handes one of another by reason of the diuersitie of the religion but ayde and defend the if any man shall seeme to offer them wrong

the tenth

the answeare

the eleuenth
you shall not sing in the streetes in companies but onely at sermons and the exercises of your religion
the answeare
we agree that no man shall sing in the streets in companies

the twelfth
a thousand of you shall subscribe to these poyntes aboue sayde
answeare
forsomuche as the resolute establishement of our religion is put to the deciding of the generall estates we think that there are many which wil hardly subscribe neuertheles if ye page missing

page missing occurranses alwaies prouided that they be no strangers and besides they may haue other officers for their consistorie

to the fifte hee saieth that hee is contented to temporize or serue the turnes of these suppliauntes and to stay a while for the deliuering vp of this rowle for the reasons by them declared
for the sixt his excellencie accepteth of the accord hereupon agreed willing them to keepe it accordingly
for the seueuth his excellencie also accepteth of the aunsweare to this article and it is his mind and of the magistrate likewise that all preachers in general of what religion soeuer they be shall abstayne from all inuectiues wronges and reproches which thing he would also haue to be giuen in commandement to the preachers of the suppliants likewise to those of the other religions
for the eighth his excellencie accepting of the offer vppon this article will depute and name vnto the suppliauntes some one officer for the purposes in this supplication conteined
for the nienth his excellencie accepteth also of the accord agreed vppon this article and will take order with the magistrate that all the catholiques shall obserue it in like manner whereof they haue alreadie begun to make a good assay by the proclamation that was yesterday made for the abstinence of wronges
for the tenth his excellencie also accepteth it agreeth to the answeare of this article
for the eleuenth he likewise accepteth of the accord had vpon this present article

with some sufficient good number of the best qualified of the religion doe subscribe agree and promise to keepe and make effectual these prese~t answeres with the articles offers in this writing agreed vpon and his excellencie also doubteth not but to get the same to be signed by one of the secretaries of the citie in the name of the magistrate who as he is to command in generall and keepe in obedience all the inhabitauntes of this citie so by that meane he shall be much better able to serue for the tuition assuraunce and quiet of these suppliaunts and their assemblies being certayne and sure that by reason of this singing none of the suppliants shal hereafter be suspected hunted after nor troubled

for the thirteenth his excellencie accepteth the accord vpon this article and doubteth not but that the suppliantes will be glad of the case to come for the liberty whiche they themselues required
for the fourteenth hee woulde assure these suppliauntes as well by reason of the sayde singing as also of the proclamatio~s that al the inhabita~ts lyuing in obedience politike tranquility should be protected without regarde of religion either of papacy or protestancy
for the fifteenth his excellencie accepteth of the answere to this present article
and as for the other pointes of the suppliants answeares his excellency replieth as followeth

for the first hee aunsweareth that the leuiyng was not for to trouble any in the exercise of his religion but contrarywise for the safetye and quietnesse as well of the supplyauntes as of all others insomuche as they were all cityzens and sworne to doe nothing agaynst the priuiledges nor agaynst anye that were of the religions but indifferently to stande in defence agaynst all violences as they might at large see by their articulations of whiche his excellencie woulde not sticke to bestowe on them a copye who also should not be burdenous to the inhabitants nor yet hinder their trafficke but preserue the citie from all troubles and inconueniences and assure the merchaunt againe to sette vppe and

place the accustomed trade of merchandise

for the seconde hee aunsweareth that it is prouyded for by the proclamation already set foorth agreeyng to all the rest as it were by waye of colleration vntill suche tyme as his maiestie by the aduise of the generall estates shall otherwise ordeyne which determination euerie man shall be bounde to follow
and his excellency willeth them foorthwith to giue knowledge to those of ye religion of al these poynts co~manding the to hold them within the compasse before saide giuen at antwerpe the

from these propositions and aunsweares the deputies culled out certaine articles whiche shoulde serue for a full resolution which his excellencie hauing receiued digested them in order as followeth

articles agreed vpon and signed

to the ende that all troubles and discordes which haue fallen out within this citie of antwerpe by reaso of religion might cease be for euer stayed and that all the citizens inhabitauntes thereof might from hencefoorth liue soberlye and peaceablye in all loue and amitte together and the negotiation or traffique bee brought againe vnto the olde trade and this citie be defended from all further inconueniences so it is that after diuers communications and deliberations heereuppon had and holden and diuers poyntes and articles propounded both on the one side and on the other my lorde the prince of orange vicount of this citie and the appoynted gouernour thereof in his maiesties name and the right woorshipfull the scowte or marshall boroughmaisters and sheriffes of the same haue as it were by way of tolleration vntill suche time as his maiestie with the aduise of the generall estates of these lowe countries shalbee able otherwise to dispose and ordeyne agreed with those of the new religion and permitted and tollerated these poyntes and articles hereafter written which they of the religion haue also promised and

polities
and although there were two or three poyntes heerein whiche the deputies woulde gladlye haue altered or at the leaste haue hadde them more playnely sette downe yet neuerthelesse beeyng satisfied with the woordes of his excellencies owne mouth this accorde was signed by the ministers

and gouernors of the church with a good number of the beste qualified and other members thereof

the first day of the said conference and communication with his excellencie the saide deputies hauing vnderstood of ye slaunders that they of the religion were still more and more charged with and that the chiefe officers made shew to beleeue them first that the people had beene excited and stirred vppe by the sermons to pull downe idolles as hauing beene taught to thrust out all idolles not onelie from their heartes but from their eyes also and not onelye to breake them in peeres but also to burne them to ashes that the memorye of them might cleane bee quenched out
moreouer that the suppliantes had hyred certaine people to pull downe the images
item that the ministers had also taught that they were no more bounde to paye the assyses or custome or at the least not so greate as heeretofore they had done
item that they had concluded to take the towne house chaunge the magistrate and expulse all such out of the citie as were not of their religion
item that they should bragge that they would not once suffer any exercise of the romish religion in this citie and many such other like leasings whereupon they were inforced for the purging and iustifiyng of them selues to exhibite a supplication as well to his excellencie as also to the magistrate and counsell of the citie of antwerpe conteyning ouer and beside the saide iustification a graunt of certayne churches built within the sayde citie so greate and so manye as shoulde bee thought necessarie for the greatnesse and multitude of the people
moreouer the saide suppliants of the religion prayed to haue a good answere vnto their supplication of euery act with a copie therof foorthwith a graunt that they might cause the same to bee imprinted for the benefite vnity and quiet of the citie of antwerpe

now there was no answere vnto their supplication because the chiefe officers presupposed that the articles whiche were ready to be concluded vppon shoulde bee a sufficient prouiso for

the whole
and as for that poynt of ye burying of the dead it was sayde vnto them that they might bury them in ye publique churchyardes of the citie

there was also at that time published the abolition of the spanishe inquisition and commissions in manner and forme as followeth

de penants
at the very same tyme there was openly solde a printed picture in which was pictured commissions and letters from his maiestie with the inquisition tyed and hanging at a bowe that was bent the protestants or those of the religion going about to pull it downe with ropes

the pope and his shauelings labouring with might and mayne to vpholde and maynteyne them
the protestantes crying out and saying pour placcars et inquisition casser trauaillous tous sanscesser
to witte for the ouerthrowing of these commissions and this vile inquisition wee neuer cease trauelling till wee haue brought them all downe

the pope on the other side answering and saying per force et aussi conseil bon retenous les placars et le inquisition to witte and wee for our partes with all the force and counsayle wee can will retayne and keepe them in despite of any man
all these thinges aforesayde were done my lorde the prince of drange was at antwerpe but the pulling downe and breaking of the images was the cause that the catholikes yeelded more to the protestantes then they at the first intended
for the feare of the rage and furie of the people and the helpe of the gentlemen straungers strooke them to the verye heart and besides they knewe well that the kinges maiestie was a great distance off to helpe them wherefore they were enforced to behaue themselues accordingly as the tyme serued and of necessitie to make a vertue in dispice of them and of their great sorrowe and griefe

in the meane while

the ladie regent by the counsayle of the lordes of the goulden fleese and others graunted and permitted the protestauntes to haue publique sermons promising to appoynte them some place without the citie for the exercise of their religion
ouer and besides that the inquisition and seuere commissions shoulde from thence foorth bee abolished so that no man shoulde any more be pursued and bunted after for his conscience but yet vpon this condition that the confedered gentlemen which tooke no parte shoulde sweare that they woulde procure the people to forsake and lay downe theyr armour and weapon and that the churches should bee no more spoyled nor any thing that shoulde bee preiudiciall vnto the cleargie men or catholikes

to be short that they should be ready to yeelde all obedience vnto his maiestie
hereupon an accord was made in august
duer and besides this the regent had procured the most qualified catholikes to bee sworne to the same and confirmed by his maiesties commaundement which was proclaymed in diuers places

the noble men for the perfourming of their promise and oth wrote and declared to the consistories all those thynges

which had been treated of which was that they should lay down and leaue off their armour and weapon and behaue themselues as good and obedient subiects ought to doe towards their prynces for if they so did not the matter would goe yll with them whereupon the people to shew theyr obedience willingly leaft off and layd downe theyr weapons

during these troubles king philip being aduertised by his suborners and flatterers of the pulling downe and breaking of the images was marueilously angry determined in his owne person to come downe into the lowe countryes with a mayne force for the auengyng of the contempt and misbehauiour committed and doone vnto his matestie
but before hee had called together his councel at madrid to consult about the appeasing of the low countries it was concluded that his maiestie shoulde not goe thyther because that this sire might otherwise bee well enough quenched by force of armes howbeit as for the chosing of a generall that should execute the same they were of sundrie opinions
for many were of the opinion that the prince of spaine don charles his maiesties onely sonne and heyre should bee appointed generall not onely for that that by right of nature it apperteined vnto him but also by reason of the good affection which the catholikes of the lowe countries be are hym as beeyng theyr naturall prince and the onelye sonne of the kyng theyr lorde vnto whom they would sooner yeelde theyr obedience and loue then to any other

some of them were loth to lay vpon this young prince so waightie a burden and warlike commission but saide that the duke of medina celi was a meete man for that purpose some others againe gaue theyr consent to the duke of alua whereupon in the end it was so determined
the young prince being aduertised of this resolution was greatly greeued and despited therewith and for that cause conceaued a marueilous great harred against the duke of alua and other lordes which beeing once knowen together his good affection that hee had to the lowe countries was the cause of his death as heereafter more at large shalbee declared

whiles they were about to make readie for this warre

his matestie wrote to the ladie regent and to other chiefe lords

of the lowe countries very sharpe letters expresly signifying how angry and greeued he was at the insolencies passed commanding in flat wordes a restauration of the commissions vnto their former strength and accustomed course with many other things hereafter following

hereupon the confederates might easily consider gather to what ende this preparation of warre and yrefull threates of his maiestie tended but the catholikes especially who with theyr craftie clayning and subtill dawbing might the easilier deceiue the regent feigned that they wold rather become newters or els if they did any thing that they would after a sort take part with her excellencie as they saide for the common wealth and yet it was well enough perceiued that they shewed them selues secrete enemies both to the inquisition and also to the spaniardes howbeit because they hoped to obteine the good will and moderation whiche the regent on the behalfe of her brother had giuen the to vnderstand they to the end they would not haue their enterprises to bee discouered nor hindered fell to plaine dissembling
but when both the confederates and catholikes vnderstoode of the rumor of the setting forwarde of the spanishe warres eyther partie beganne to bestyrre hym and make shift for himselfe yea and some of the protestants who before had refused and forsaken the gentle offer and ayde of strange captaines and souldiers because they woulde streng then themselues the better confirmed with them their confederacie and thereupon caused men to bee leuied who had taken and possessed certaine townes makyng thereby the romanistes practises of none effect

now because the spoyle of the churches greatly displeased the catholikes they also leuied a great number of men of war that they might bee auenged of the downe pullers and breakers of theyr images punishyng many in diuers places without being any thing at all gainsaid by any of the rest of the protestants
for the third part of the confederates haunted no whit any of the assemblies but interdicting also ye preachings imprisoned as many as continued constant in the exercise of religion rechristening the infants and remarrying those persons which by the ministers

had been before baptised and marryed and besides when they had caused the preachings to cease they hunted and chased the ministers and gaue them vp vnto the inquisition and to all the rest of the old ordenances
whereupon many were forced to get them away into other countries and cities where the exercise of the religion had free course amongest which valencia was the most famous

for this cause the lady regent had required and commanded the valencians to take in a garrison to wit fiue ensignes of footemen and foure troupes or companies of horsemen whiche monsieur de noircarmes the marques of bergues lieuetenant gouernour of henault had brought
but the valencians flatly refused them the
of september the very selfe same yeere trusting to the strength of their citie and the ayde of certaine french which were with them

valencia is the second chiefe citie of henault

scituate in a fruitfull soyle full of moysture by reason of two riuers which streame downe thither and there meete the greater of which is called ye escante whose spring head commeth fro the countrie of vermand out of the east and running downe by cambray and the territories thereof taketh his couse by valencia so vnto conde where the riuer called the hayne whereof all the countrie is named falleth into escant the whiche separating and diuiding artoys from henault runneth down by tournay in flaunders euen vnto gand where it toyneth with lys which discendeth from artoys and so parting it selfe into diuers armes runneth by deuremond and antwerp and lastly disgorgeth it selfe into the ocean sea
moreouer valencia is a fayre citie well fenced with rampiers and ditches but the chiefest commoditie it hath is that they may drown all the whole champion countrie thereabout through the opening of certayne sluces or flood gates made for the same purpose for the stopping of al such as intended to come neere the towne
ouer and besides this it is a citie well furnished with all kindes of merchandise seruyng for the trade and traffique of the frenche and lowe countrie men

when the ladie regent had vnderstood of this refusall shee againe commanded to haue the gates to be set open

to take in a garrison which she had sent thyther by letters and withall the duke of arescote and the counte egmont to perswade them
but when they coulde by no meanes bring to passe their purpose the valencians were taken for his maiesties enemies and so declared and proclaimed in many places which terrified and feared the other cities
neuerthelesse at the last the said lords had so persuaded them as that they agreed to receiue a garrison although against theyr priuileges but because they would gladly bee discharged of them they were contented to giue them a summe of money vpon condition that they would agree to certaine articles
howbeit the catholikes woulde in no wise accept thereof saying that it was against all reason that any subiect shoulde prescribe lawes or articles vnto his lord wherfore they straitly besieged the citie and made their trenches and enuironed them both on foote and horse backe
in this mean while monsieur de noircarmes had gotten a litle village somewhat neere thereto called spr amand and had schooled and appointed them what they should doe and afterwarde in december
hee came before valencia with his whole campe
the besiegeants likewise had prepared to defend themselues against the assaultes and attempts of the catholikes and had written to the cittes confedered beseeching their aide but especially to the gentlemen confedered because they would gladly haue been assisted by them seeing that by their incitation and encouragement they had taken in hand that warre

the nobilitie woulde at no hand haue to doe with that cause but som of the common people gathered themselues together in low flanders to rayse a campe but forsomuch as they were not prouided of an expert captain for the wars they in steebe of marching against the enemie made warre with the priests and churches and by that meane procured the losse of valencia and were the cause of theyr owne destruction
for when the gouernour of doway and orchies was aduertised of this assembly he sent against them both footemen horsemen to charge them in the reare ward
which thing whe they of tournay vnderstood they put the~selues in armes for the ayding of the valencians

remouing of the siege
the gouernour of doway had all that night gotten his people together sent them into the champion countrey so yt about
of the clocke in ye morning there were in armes
hundred harquebuziers an hundred horses forbidding them not to fight vntill such teime as monsieur de noircarmes were come with his tenne ensignes of footemen an hundred horse who assoone as they were come violently suddainely charged the men of warre of the protestantes

and put them to the foyle so that the third parte of them lay dead in the place and the rest were saued by their fast running into tournay the enimie pursuing of them came before the citie with niene ensignes and bad them let them in wherupon they rendred the towne where they houng vp certeyne ministers and the best or most qualified protestantes

when noircarmes saw that the valencians were no whit discomfited with the ouerthrowe of their neighboures and that they continued full and whole stiffe and constaunt in their purpose hee retyred from tournay to valencia

and skirmyshed with those of the saide citie where immediatly were staine an hundred and threescore of the valencians wherefore the sayde noircarmes sent as well to doway and tournay as to other cities thereabout for as much artillery as was possiblye to be had and after he had made his trenches and planted his artillery or great shot he summoned valencia with the cannon so that they of the sayd citie considering that the noble men and gentlemen had forsaken them tooke counsell and after some debates about the regents letters

ye catholikes yeelded vp the tie against the myndes of the french and many others the
of marche
howbeeit they kept not their promise whiche they had made them
for monsieur de noircarmes keeping the gates shut for certaine dayes committed that while many cruell deeds for the satisfiyng of his bloudy minde for he houng many french ministers

and other very well qualified protestantes confisked their goods abolished preaching restored the ecclesiastical state
this wicked deed cruel executio astonished the rest of the cities insomuch that cambresis was forsaken mastright rendred and the rest shortly after receiued catholike garrisons

while these things aboue said thus houng

mathias flaccus illiricus a man well knowne spangenberger and other ministers of the confession of ausbourgh arriued at antwerpe and prouoked the ministers of the reformed religion to dispute vppon the point of the presence of christ iesus his bodie in the supper truely a matter of ouer greate waight for so an euill fauoured vnfitte tyme
either partie had publyshed and prynted the confession of their faith
this controuersie not well vnderstood is as yet vndecided and at that time nothing was concluded vpon wherefore the germayne doctors a few dayes after went from antwerpe without doyng of anye thing

at this very time the protestantes considering the greate prosperitie and aduauncement of the catholikes and their owne declining and abasing and besides the regent persisting in following the protestants made small account of her promises made to the nobility nor yet of her ordinaunces by her published and proclaymed to wit that the inquisition shoulde cease and publique preaching bee graunted but layed all the blame vppon his maiestie exhibited the
of october
a supplication vnto my lorde the count of hoogstrate gouernour
and to the lords of the citie of antwerpe the tenure whereof ensueth

to the king

in all humble and most obedient wise shewe vnto your maiestie your faithfull vassalles and true subiectes of all the lowe countries that whereas they haue alwayes employed their bodies and goodes and all other dueties in your highnesse seruice as well in your absence as in your presence neuer refusing to paye anie customes impostes tollages nor other extraordinary subsidies for your maiesties conseruation but still bearing and continuing the same their good willes and feruent affections to wardes you and desiring to increase surpasse daylie more and more therin doe likewise trust that they shal perceiue find by such your ma great fauour and clemency as heeretofore they haue felt by singuler

and notable tokens and testimonies
for although your maiestie hath beene alwayes councelled and induced to pursue by most cruell death and losse of goods as many as will not in all points receiue the doctrine of the romishe church as also hath of late beene propounded and set foorth by the councell of trent thereby to maintaine the inquisition where it was first planted and to bring it into other places where it was neuer before receiued beeing a deuise wholy against the liberties and priuileges of your lowe countries hereabouts and also your faithful subiects in them
neuerthelesse so it is that your maiestie hauing vnderstood it by the supplication of the nobilitie hereabout the estate of this low countrie was well contented not onely to cause the saide inquisition to cease but also according to your owne naturall clemencie and benignitie to surcease the commissions proclaimed about the cause of religion and the same to find out by the way of moderation and tollerations for the pleasing of your people for the which we haue to render thanks vnto our good god and to attend and looke for all fauour and grace at your maiesties hands

now the people hauing been as it were a long time brought into slauerie by keeping of the said commissions and yet hauing secretely very well profited in the true knowledge of their saluation as well by reading of the holy scriptures inspired by god as also by the teaching and exhorting of certaine good and godly preachers well instructed both in diuinitie and humanitie beeyng moued by the continuall slaunders and false accusations of some euill willers who neuer ceased to cause them to bee suspected of theyr religion knewe not nor could not any longer hyde it and therefore for the shutting vp of the mouthes of all backbiters and staunderers and the satisfiyng and contenting of themselues by shewing theyr owne zeale and feruencie they went to the publike exercises of the said religio to the end euery man might know what the religion was which they before so secretely vsed amongest themselues which beeing done there met such great numbers of men so well qualified at the assemblies and preachings as that they could hardly bee counted and the matter more hardly bee beleeued of those that were not

present at the doyng and sight there of and besides the multitude still dayly so increased as that it passed all mans vnderstandyng
but although the mynisters in their sermons greatly trauelled in exhorting the people to all modestie and dutiful reuerence and obedience vnto the magistrate and in preaching namely against idolatry admonished them to conteine them selues within the boundes of their vocation without vsurping of the saide magistrates office by thrusting themselues forewarde to the pulling downe of images and such like things yet it so fell out as that certaine companies of people carried with an ouer hoat and indiscrete zeale amongest whom were some dissolute and wicked persons who looked after nothing but spoyling and pilfring accompanied with a multitude of wome young youthes and children gaue themselues to the pulling downe of the images in the churches and such other like disorders to our vnspeakle griefe whereupon the magistrates euery where were in such a fright and feare because they doubted of more grieuous inconueniences as that they did not onelie let them alone but which is more commanded the companies of liueries or brotherhoods in many places to take away the images and ornaments of theyr aulters whiche coulde not be done so hastily and confusedly but that they must needes breake some of them
which kinde of dealing when some of the people sawe they in like sort put thereto theyr helping hand thinking it to be a thing both lawfull allowed and also commaunded by the magistrate to ryd the churches of them all
wherefore it is so farre of that they were neither at the first nor yet afterwardes stirred vp thereto by the sermons as that contrariwise the preachers and such as haue the gouernment of the churche as muche as in them lay trauelled to stay them neuer hauing commaunded any such act to bee doone nor yet knowing thereof before eyther els allowyng of it after as by many reasons may wel bee verified and also namely appeare by the testimonie of a very great number of prysoners who for the same cause haue beene miserably tormented
which thing neuerthelesse wee haue to our greate griefe vnderstood that these two points to wit the preachings breaking of ye images which notwithstanding haue no waye beene any furtherance but altogether quite and cleane againste

the hauing there with no communitie at all haue been so reported of vnto your maiestie as that you being thereat greatly offended were fully determined to come hyther with force of armes for the indifferent rooting out both of the one and the other
which thing considered wee haue thought it our duetie most humbly to beseech your maiestie that it would please you moste certainely thinke that the religion beeing imprinted in the heartes and mindes of men into the which no threatninges nor outwarde forces can any way enter or pearse considering that sith the point standeth vppon the saluation or condemnation of theyr soules it is not so easie a matter to pluck away by force of armes as by that means to cause some weak soules to dissemble the same and thereby in time make them become people without religion and very libertines and atheists at whose hands is neyther fidelitie nor yet loyaltie of conscience to bee looked for
and withall that the saying of gamaliel may well bee weighed that if it bee of god it cannot bee ouerthrowne and therefore an hard and dangerous matter to make warre against him
and that which is more when your maiestie shall see into the chiefe pointes of the enterprises that haue beene put into your head by suche as eyther through ignorance by theyr particuler affections or for feare haue giuen you that councell that none other thing will followe nor come thereon but an irrecouerable ruine and destruction of your so florishing lowe countries and so necessary for the conseruation of your mightinesse and the increasing of the princes your neighbours who beeynge inriched with the spoyles of these countries may thereby bee strengthened to make warre against you

and therefore wee your most humble vassals and faithfull seruauntes desiryng alwayes to liue and dye vnder your maiesties obedience and to aduaunce the mightinesse thereof as muche as in vs lyeth both with our bodies and goods throughly consideryng and waying all these circumstances and beeyng persuaded that our humble and resonable requestes and supplycations wyll take some place with your excellencie by reason of your naturall and wonted clemencie and benignitie beeseeche you in the name of our lorde iesus christe to graunte

vs that such as cannot by any meanes lyke of the romyshe doctrine and ceremonies and yet for all that in other things are your very faithfull and obedient subiects may fully and wholy haue such an assured libertie openly to meete in such as your maiestie and the magistrates vnder you shal please to assigne them for the exercise of theyr religion wherein they truely protest as before god that theyr full pretence and meanyng is to beleeue lyue and dye in the doctrine of the prophetes and apostles contayned within the olde and newe testament summarily comprysed in the creede of the said apostles and of all councels agreeyng with the worde of god submittyng themselues besides vnto whatsoeuer shall hereafter bee determined and ordeyned by a free and generall councell where attending and looking for the same councell which shal by the common consent of the eua~gelike churches both of hygh and lowe germanie fraunce englande and other quarters of europe bee agreed vpon they purpose to follow keepe all such orders as shall generally bee set down by the said churches
and to the end that this libertie and exercise being established and assured the traffick whereupon hangeth the whole wealth of this countrie myght haue a more ample course which as yet is and still remaineth a thing very vncertaine by way of tolleration that it woulde please your maiestie according to your wonted clemencie and benignitie to confirme this benefite by an especial graunt and grace ratified by the general estates of this countrie for the same purpose assembled
and as for your supplyants it is so farre off that by the meanes of this lybertie they entend to alter the politike gouernment as to cha~ge the prince to refuse the paying of taxes tollages customes tributes
as their aduersaries openly slaunder them that contrariwise in witnes of theyr affection and loue towards you in ye bestowing of that they haue in your seruice in acknowledging of your grace and fauour and as a newe homage in ratifiyng of theyr othe and fidelitie and to graunt and acknowledge that this priuilege of libertie exercise of theyr religio whiche they requyre loke for at your maiesties ha~ds encreaseth their harts to dedicate and consecrate both theyr bodies and goods in your seruice and offer to giue the day of the graunt of the said fauour

and grace which you your selfe shall finde to be a sufficient caucion or pledge ouer and besides the imposts customes and other extraordinary contributions the summe of three millions of florins wherewith they will furnishe you by a reasonable daye assigned towards the defraying of your maiesties ordinarie char ges heere in these countries promising further not to come into any of the romish churches neither yet to trouble or let eyther by force or otherwise the seruice of theyr religion
humblie beseeching your to take well in woorth this offer and small present at your humble subiects handes proceeding from such heartes as desire nothing els but the establishment of gods seruice and your maiesties with the benefite quiet and prosperitie of these countries
and we trust that your maiestie will not thinke it any strange thing for subiects hauing receyued some notable fauour and rewarde from their naturall prince to acknowledge themselues thankfull for the same according to theyr small abilitie by such a like meane
as also it is no new thyng for such grace and benefite to haue beene graunted vnto subiects as by the example of that mightie emperour alexander surnamed seuere well appeareth who beeing an heathen prince an idolater gaue leaue to the christians whom hee tooke to bee heretikes to haue churches in rome beyng the chiefe citie within his dominion and also of the emperour constantine surnamed constantine the great because that contrarie to the order of his predecessors hee licensed the christians to haue certain places for theyr meetings euen as the heathen had theyr temples
in doing whereof he surpressed an infinite number of quarrels staied the apparant effusion of blood ruled his empyre peaceably and by mean of this accord his authoritie prospered and hee dayly encreased
and if any man shall put into your maiesties head that it is another thing to suffer christians to haue the exercise of theyr religion then heretikes as it pleaseth some to esteeme of vs first of all our preachings prayers and exercise of religion doe right well shewe vs to bee christians and neither heretikes nor yet idolaters which we are readie more at large to verifie if it shall please your maiestie to giue gentle and safe audience

moreouer if so bee that we were as notable heretikes as the iewes arrians and nouatians yet the present example of the pope who callyng hymselfe the head of the churche and sayth he cannot erre doeth not only mayntaine the lewes the very professed and sworne enemies vnto our lorde iesus christe but also suffereth them to haue theyr synagogues and the exercise of theyr religion within his own citie of rome and in diuers other places vnder his subiection
and besides all this the examples of the catholique and wel instructed emperours which haue graunted churches to the arrians and nouatians may bee a great quieting to your conscience and chiefly your late father of most hygh and inumcible memory the emperour charles the fifth by the aduise of the estates of the empire graunted the like to the protestants in germa nie notwithstanding that hee tooke them to bee heretikes as also the frenche king not long sithence hath doone vnto his subiects
all which doynges ought to quiet and content your maiestie to graunt vnto vs this grace vntill suche tyme as by the consent of all christendome wee might all agree in one and the selfe same religion and manner of diuine seruice
by meane whereof both your maiestie and also these countries shall without all doubt receiue great blessing and prosperitie for so much as god vndoubtedly shall bee serued through the auoyding of a very great most apparant and pitifull effusion of blood and that your countries shal be peaceably maintained wtout beyng thrust out as a pray vnto your neere neighors the merchaunts and in habitants of the countrie remaine in suche safetie as that all suche and many others as are gone out of the countrie for the selfe same cause shall haue occasion to reforte thyther agayne with theyr goods tytles and trades

lastly all these matters by this meane beeing brought to a quietnesse and contentation both to one and other the countries shall floryshe more then euer they did with an increase of your crowne and dignities and all men shall bee so muche the more bound continually to pray vnto the lorde for the prosperitie and high estate of your maiestie

subscribed by your maiesties humble subiectes the citizens and inhabitants of your citie of antwerpe professing the gospel so farre foorth as they are therein permitted for somuch as it toucheth and apperteineth vnto them as members of the supplyants in this behalfe

this supplication was exhibited by the handes of marke peres with the assistance of giles de graue charles de bombergue giles vander banderies francis godin henrie vander broecke cornill de bombergue thomas van geer iohn carlier nicholas de vmier nicholas sellyn as deputies and in the name of the supplyants of the member of antwerpe vnto my lorde the count of hoogstrate gouernour for his maiestie and to the right worshipfull the burroughmasters and shierifs of the saide citie of antwerp assembled in ye colledge of the same citie in the presences of the right worshipful ye margraue allemman the of october betwixt
and
in the afternoone

when the counte hoogstrate had seene this supplication

hee sent it to the ladie regent and to the councell that were with her that it might bee sent to the king with conuement and meete commendation to the ende the fame myght take good effect a thyng so necessary reader as thou in thy wisdome and discretion maiest iudge and vnderstand
but so soone as the regent and gouernours of the lowe countries had seen contents thereof they thought it to bee but a proude and arrogant bragge of theyr riches and great treasure euen to engen der in the hearts of honorable personages some sinister and lewde suspition as if the protestants had made this supplication to drawe vnto them thereby strange princes and great potentates to the end they might haue aide and succour of souldiers

howbeit notwithstanding all this the people gaue not ouer to deuise bethink the~selues of all ye meanes possible they could not only with the dutches who was not to be intreated but also with ye who had promised although they were in ye selfe

same predicament and danger that the people was as may appeare by the ende of this tragedie to accomplish new promises and to forsake theyr fayth for the libertie of consctence protestyng notwithstanding that for the exercise of the religion they woulde doe all possible duetie that might bee for the obtayning thereof but sith that shee had not giuen her promise the subiects should bee founde giltie of all the mischiefes that shoulde come in the lowe countries about that cause
wherefore the lorde heury brederode

by the nobilitie appointed for that purpose required the
of februarie
the lady dutches that hee might haue audience albeit shee had forbidden him to come within the citie of bruxelles notwithstanding he so behaued hym in his businesse as that the supplication was deliuered vp into her own hands wherin was shewed to her highnes that the people could no longer abide and suffer the great contempt and horrible persecutio which the catholiks vsed towards them and therfore had implored and lamentably besought the assista~ce of the nobilitie that by them they might obtaine the performance of that which was agreed vpon
and therefore seeing they sawe that no contract could take effect but by the consent of both parties and that the one party making default the other had great reason to complaine duer and besides this sith they were appointed vnto her highnes as pledges and answerable for the protesta~ts who at that present by reason of the catholikes breaches of promise they found themselues greatly greeued they could do no lesse then speake vnto her that their contracte and promises might be sure sound seeing yt she seemed by maner of an ordinari way to shake make void the contracts insomuch that it brought all the countries in an vprore trouble notwithstanding the great diligence pain which they had taken about the establishing of a good peace publike vnitie which by reaso of the merueilous lightnes of their enemies is spurned at wherfore they beseech your highnes to suffer the people to haue their preachings and to surcease and abolish the new commissions ordeyned against them and withal likewise that all the ministers and the rest of the religion which are nowe prisoners may bee released and deliuered

moreouer that all the men of warre which are alredie and

hereafter to be lcuied aswell without as within the countries together the garnisons in euery citie be cast and euery man licensed to returne home to his house and abiding place to the end the prouinces of the low countries may bee gouerned after their own liberties and priuileges and therfore do beseech your highnes to make them a short resolute answere therto

the
of februarie the ladie regent answered the said supplication in maner and forme following
cannot a little maruel ne yet thinke what noble men or people these are which exhibite vnto vs this supplication seeing that many of the lords confedered are contented that not only the inquisition and commissions should hee obserued but are also well pleased with the assurance that is promised them and therfore doe daily offer vp vnto his maiestie their humble seruices and obedience and she herselfe also thinketh it very strange that they can perswade themselues that it was euer her highnes wyl meaning to graunt vnto the exercise of the religion seeing she had giuen it out sufficiently enough to be other wise vnderstoode by the article of the agreement although it was contrary to ye promise that some of the nobilitie made to the people touching the faide exercise which was plainely against her well and intent
and whereas the desired that all leuiyng of souldiers shoulde cease and be cast so likewise ought they to bee contented to haue the auncient religion without bringing in any new whereunto she neuer agreed
ouer and besides this if they did well remember themselues with what grudging and griefe of minde the preachings were in diuers places suffered without taking of offences and giuing of blowes they might easily ghesse what small pleasure she tooke in fauouring the preachings will not speake of the rest of the exercises of the religion
but so much as concerned ye liberty of conscience agreed onely to that and graunted the same that was conteyned in their supplication exhibited the fifth of aprill the yeere last past howbeit at that time was no mention made of the cause of religion which they contrary to theyr conscience and duetie suffered longe before to enter

wherefore haue iuste occasion to be grieued seeing they

haue of their owne authoritie taken vpon them a matter preiudiciall and hurefull vnto his maiestie

and therefore had his maiestie also great reason to be moued and angry when as hee was aduertised that his subiects vsed an other exercise of religion and that by theyr newe magistrates they had inforced his maiesties officers

the doyng whereof they shoulde shortly feele and for answere thereof the dutches dyd them to wit that they had not obserued the conditions promised and that these speeches are false and fained
for many of the magistrates woulde neuer graunt to any such thing and also that shee neuer went against her promises although they had by her appointme~t imprisoned certain for their faults offences
for she was neuer of the minde to deliuer the church robbers and pullers downe and breakers of images especially suche as were put in prison sithence the argreeme~t made with som of the nobles confedered

besides all this they yet continue theyr preachinges in some cities where were neuer any before
moreouer that they had taken certaine churches monasteries and gentlemens houses dryuen out thence the knightes of the order threatened the cleargie men preached in places where in tyme past were neuer any yea that the people is styrred vp encouraged by the confederates and doe keepe certaine cities and places belonging to his matestie brynging in artillerie and munition depose and expulse his maiesties officers are come in open field in armes and haue not onely threatened all the catholikes but her highnes also
and by the intercepting of letters and the men of warre of valencia theyr purpose is founde out and knowen to wit if god had not prouided for it euen to haue depriued his maiestie of all his countries
and as for their request about the casting of the souldiers that are leuied and the commissions newly published thereby their meaning is to take away the sword which god hath giuen vs lastly her highnes intent is that the lord of brederode and his confederates doe admonishe the people of theyr vprore and rebellion giue them warning that they take heed they pul not his maiesties wrath more and more vpon their heads

after that these complaintes and answeres were made euery man on either side prouided for him selfe as much as was possible but especially the catholiques who had the winde in the poupe insomuche that the confederates feared them by reason of the great number of souldiers that were leuied and the kinge taking their part

the count of megue was come with certaine ensignes of footemen

and companies of horemen before the towne of boisleduke who helde it for the confederates
after that the sayde count sent twelue ensignes about vtryght to surprese the souldiers and towne of vyane
and as manye as were taken prysoners in all the countreys were condemned and punished as rebels and seditious persons and the destroyers of the images were hanged and their goodes confisked and forfayted

ouer and besides all those that were of the reformed religion or that had frequented the sermons were holden for rebelles
wherefore a great number of them conueied themselues away into straunge countreys and chiefely into englande but some yt were of courage assembled the selues in companies

in this meane while the lordes and knightes of the golden fleese were newely sworne

to keepe inuiolably the catholique fayth emongest whome a secrete league was made by the counsell of the count egmount who traueyling through the cities of flanders and artois where remayned as yet some protestauntes did his best to cause the sermous to bee left euen as the prince of orange and the count of hoogstrate had done at antwerpe and about antwerpe the lorde of tolonse caused men of warre to be leuied in the name and behalfe of the protestantes who by reason of the scituation and commoditie of the place assembled them selues at oosterwell a shorte myle from antwerpe

when the dutchesse vnderstoode of this shee sent the
of marche vnder the conduct of hans de grauedrossat of brabant foure hundred footemen and fiue hundred horse which were piked out of the garisons aswell of brabant as of flaunders who assayled and fought with the protestantes ouerthrew them and put them to flight

there were slayne at that instant their captayne mounsieur

de tolonse and a great manie of others some gotte into the medowe ditches thinking thereby to saue them selues howebeit they were slayne with harquebuze shotte and some of them were burnt vp in the barnes and houses of oosterwell without any resistaunce

they tooke also a prisoner who had a scrowle of the names of all those that subscribed to the conspiracie by which meane they learned and came to the knowledge of manie secrete purposes whereupon also ensued very much mischiefe
when the protestantes of antwerpe vnderstood of these dealings they put themselues in armes and passing by the meire bridge marched on towardes the gate that they might get out of the citie to helpe their people
but my the of orange who remayned stil in antwerp gouernour for his maiestie being hereof aduertised came vnto them and admonished counselled them to leaue off that enterprise saying that it was impossible for the to ayde the souldiers of oosterwell and that if so be they issued out of the towne they should tast of the same sawce and be laid on gods deare earth as we say as the rest were because they were too too weake to deale agaynst horsemen
but if they woulde abyde in the towne that theyr bodtes and goods shoulde be saued for there shoulde no man take any wronge in his presence

whiles the prince was thus talking with the citizens

the tumult encreased more and more
for both horsemen and footemen had taken and kept the meire bridge and the streete called hauuetters street where they continued in armes vntill it was after noone
during these troubles the prince had talked and agreed with the magistrate and counsell of antwerpe that the three companies of the souldiers that were leuied for the safeguard of the citie as before hath been said which were ranged in order of battayle in the market place shoulde returne home and the artillery be drawen to the ordinarie place
and although through the good and gentle woordes of the prince of orange this tumult and trouble was supressed yet renued it agayne by reason yt the italians spaniards catholikes together those of the religion had gotten the market place on horsebacke iusomuch that they of the reformed religion assembled themselues

a freshe
this sedition continued two dayes together and euery man doubted that some mischieuous issue woulde thereon eusue
and as they were all very desirous to haue one another by the eares it was feared that there woulde bee a wonderfull great effusion of blood and that the victors would sacke the vanquisheds houses insomuch that there was great mourning and weeping of women and children in euery house

but as eyther part kept their order of battell the prince and the boroughmasters traueiled in all they might to agree them

and stayed the apparant effusion of blood and dealt so earnestly betweene them as that they appeased the parties as followeth

first
that all the citizens both of the one religion of the other shoulde be sworne to bee faythfull and loyall to the king and to the prince of drange for the common quiet and benefite of the citie of antwerp and with al their care and fidelitie stoutly keepe and defende the same
the gouernours and magistrates shall not receiue any men of warre into the citie without the common consent of the three members of the citie
all the priuiledges and liberties of the citie of antwerpe shall be obserued
item
that for the benefite of the common weale and the aduauncing of the negociation or trade the agreement made in september concerning the religion shall abide in full strength without any fraude or guile whatsoeuer vntill such time as his maiestie with the aduise of the generall estates shall otherwise haue appointed the same
item
that the beste qualified of eyther religion shal promise not to molest one the other but in any neede assiste and ayde one the other to the vttermost of their power
that for the better assuraunce the keyes of the citie shall be deliuered vp into the handes of the prince of orange to shut and open the gates thereof
there shall be a good watch appointed of citiznes and souldiers of the citie
all thinges that are past shall be forgiuen and forgotten

whosoeuer he be that watcheth not shall keep his house and tende his businesse
item
that for the greater safetie of the citie there shall bee leuied by the consent of the three members foure hundred horsemen and the skelde to be guarded by the furnished shippes of warre if it shall seeme good to those of the religion and the chieftaynes who by the common counsell are thereto appoynted
all the enhabitauntes of the citie of antwerpe none excepted shalbe bounde to helpe beare the charges which shall bee made for the conseruation of the citie
all the artillery that is planted on the bulwarkes and on other places shall bee vp into the handes of the gouernours
all the troubles with a common assistance shall be suppressed for the common quiet of the citie and the seditious enprisoned
for the greater assuraunce and obseruing of the things and pointes aforesayde the gouernour magistrate and other officers of the citie all those of the religion shall by othe confirme them selues to keepe them without fraude or guile whatsoeuer
the captaynes and souldiers which are now leuied or yt are hereafter to be leuied shalbe retained vntil such time as it be otherwise agreed vpon
lastly
they of the religion beseeche her excellencie that it woulde please her to bee alwayes myndefull for the welfare of the citie and haue a care for his maiesties profitand the cities
these articles beeing accepted on eyther side the spanyardes and italians departed first nexte the gueses who at that tyme were so called and last of all the catholiques and the laying all at once their armoure and weapon aside

during these troubles

the dutchesse had sent one of the secretaries of the prinie counsell to the lorde of brederode and to his consortes who lay in holland in the citte of amsterdame sharpely commanding them to departe the citie and countrey by reason of the rebellion which they had committed

against his maiestie if they woulde not bee pursued as enemies to the countrey and perturbers of the common weale

the lorde of brederode gaue the secretary none other answere but this thou art a man not worthie any answere
the antwerpians after long resistaunce agreed with the dutchesse in manner and fourme following that the sermons shoulde cease but none to be syfted or troubled for the cause of religion and therefore for the very same purpose it was ordeined and proclaymed in antwerpe the
of april
that all ministers shoulde depart thence and the preachinges cease that all catholikes shoulde bee restored to their offices and the first commissions be obserued and kept alwayes prouided that no man shoulde bee sifted or troubled for the religion vntill such time as his maiestie by the aduise of the generall estates had otherwise appointed it
this matter was accomplished after that the ministers were gone out of the citie of antwerpe and their churches were fast shutte and sealed vp
in this sort passed the matters of flanders hollande zeland and the rest of the prouinces and the persecution dayly encreased against such as had taken armes vpon them broken downe the images and opposed themselues against the edictes and commissions

the
of april
the lady regent entred into antwerp

and with her the count mansfielde with
ensignes of footmen and fiue hundreth horse after that the prince of orange was departed thence which was the
of the sayde moneth with a great number of citizens and enhabitauntes of the same citie in very great miserie and with much weeping and wailing

when the lorde of brederode had receyued the sharpe message aforesayde hee soone after in the deade of the night

departed the countrey with many noble men and other souldiers whome the count megue pursued but it was to small purpose

the
of may the same yeere there fell in friselande into the count arenberge his handes certayne of the nobilitie that were betrayed by a mariner who in steede to carry them ouer

the seas set them on the playne grounde where they were taken by captayne mulert as a captayne of one of the companies of the count arenberge the lords of battenbrough and two lordes of friselande to witte herman galama and sir beyma besides many other gentlemen and captaynes

the tenth of may there entred into amstelredame certayne bandes of souldiers and a little before into bostleduke and vyane of whiche the duke ericke of brunswike was chief and the countrey of vtryght was deliuered to the catholikes

the
of may

the marques of bergues as it is said was poisoned in spayne of whom wee haue before spoken
and the marquesse his wife at another time caused many infantes to bee baptized and many to be married agayne by the priestes whome the ministers had before baptized and married and suche as refused it muste forsake the countreye so that many menne and women were fayne to departe and goe into other countreys

the of this moneth by her highnesse appoyntment was a proclamation proclaymed in antwerpe muche more for the behoofe of the catholiques then for the protestauntes wherein was declared that as manye as woulde remayne in the countrey shoulde from thence foorth lyue peaceably and in quiet and that all mynisters and suche as frequented sermons and had defaced the images shoulde lose both bodies and and that the father master or lorde shoulde answere fortheir children and seruantes

and besides that all infantes which were baptized by the ministers shoulde bee rebaptized by the priestes after the maner of the catholique churche
also that no schoolemasters might teache before such tyme as they were examined and their bookes allowed
moreouer against printers and statyoners which solde bookes not allowed of and agaynst all such officers as did permitte and suffer them
against all such as without his maiesties knowledge be collectors of money vpon any of his subiectes
against euery assembly which is made agaynst the ordinaunce or consent of his maiestie
against all straungers which depart not the countrey within houres or bring not

a testimoniall from the place from whence they come and the cause of their remayning there
lastly that no man shoulde withstande any ecclesiasticall person

the persecution dayly encreased whiche caused the people to forsake the countrey by thousands
there were in one day at tournay an hundred and sixe riche merchauntes and many others spoyled of their goodes and a great number put and deteyned in pryson and there ill entreated
the
of iuly the dutchesse departed from antwerpe to bruxelles and the count manssielde remayned there with his garnison
an addition of certayne thinges woorthie remembrance which happened in diuers places and prouinces
the
and
of iune
the publique preaching of the syncere woorde of god beganne throughout all the low countreys with the administration of the sacraments in many cities and townes

about the
and
of august the same yeere the images in diuers cities and townes of the lowe countreys were broken in peeces and the alters and ornamentes of the churches pulled downe and destroyed the date of this yeere when this geare was done is to bee founde by the capitall letters of this verse following

con cio sacra vit tvmidi cecidere deastri

the
of september the same yeere were in three parishe churches of leawarde all the alters pulled downe and the images broken by the appointment of the magistrate
the
of the sayde moneth and the same yeere were the first sermons made in the chiefe parish churche of the citie of oldenbone by the ministers of the woorde of god and that by the consent of the magistrate
and the
of the sayd moneth was the supper of the lorde there administred

the
of september that yeere were the aulters of the franciscane fryers in pulled down by ye leaue of the magistrate and the images broken
the
of september the same yeere was the first stone of the foundation of the reformed church in antwerpe laide
the same day were they of the reformed religion of the citie of nymmegue in gelderlande driuen out of the same
the
of october the same yeere the ministers of the woorde of god were forbidden at bruxelles vppon payne of hanging to preache within the said citie or in any other places there about
this was the first dispersing sithens the publique preachings
the
of october aforesaide there were certayne insolent partes playd by certayne young persons in our ladye church of antwerpe whereupon the lorde of hooghstrate gouernour at that time beset the churche rounde about with souldiers and entring into it tooke certayne prisoners and the next day in the morning about the dawning were sixe or seuen of them hanged in the market place
the
of ianuarie
the ministers of the reformed religion were expulsed the citie of leunwarde in fryselande
the
of march the same yeere the tyrannous papists troubled the preachinges in the towne of andenarde and slue fiue of the company with harquebuzes
the same tynie also the reformed churches in flanders were vtterly despersed
the
of aprill the same yeere were the last sermons made in amstelredame when as the lord of brederode with the noble men and ministers departed the same citie and was the last dispersion of the churches in the lowe countreys
the ende of the first booke

the seconde booke of the histories of the troubles in the low countreys in the beginning whereof shall be described and set forth the inquisition of spaine and the execution thereof and next after howe the banished princes noble men gentlemen and others assailed the low countreys both with horsemen and footemen good store for the recouerie of their enheritances and goods from which they were driuen away by the tyrannie of the duke of alua
we haue discoursed and set down in the first booke the maner of the passing of all the dealings in the lowe countreys before the of alua his comming and also in what state they stoode at his arriuall and besides howe all they of the reformed religion after the forbidding of the exercise of preaching were persecuted and condemned by the inquisition

but now if thou wilt a while giue eare wil discouer vnto thee what maner a thing ye same inquisitio is wc is more famous then rightly known all europe ouer
the declaration here of woulde be taken of many but for a fable and leasing if the spring head and first original thereof were not manifestly set forth and to say truly the gentle reader should take small pleasure if we should but onely speake of the bare name there of without telling what it is in deede
wherefore for the first point will declare vnto you what it is who are the indges thereof and the maner of the administration of it
and because there is not the least within these

iowe countreys but knoweth that this inquisition of spayne hath been the very true originall of all the troubles will not forget to lay wide open and set downe in writing the declaration and beginning thereof

spayne at the first was gouerned by meane kings

and after warde the greatest part thereof was conquered by the affricanes who at last peaceably possessed it and freed it from the bondage of the romanes
after this the same prouince was for a while gouerned by the uandales and alanes whom the gothes in the dayes of the emperours theodose and ualentinian the thirde expulsed out of fraunce who conquered many lands and countreys destroying the romaine empire
at last these wandering people were by the ordinaunce of boniface gouernours in affrica who through the dealing of the other affricane gouernours were sent and called thereto
but as they were by ye vice bothes pursued on this side ye sea there passed ouer of me women and children vnder the conduct of gontram and gensericke their kings and lordes in the yeere
about eyght hundred thousande persons to destroy and conquere affricke
after this retraite of this foresaid uandales the gothes by the consent of the emperours gouerned the realme of spayne vntill the dayes of rodrigue who hauing violated and defloured cana count iulians daughter was ruined slayne with all his kinred
for the same count iulian in reuenge of the wrong and shame that was done him sent the uandales mores affricanes and sarazins vnder the conduct of musa their king who haning discomfited and slayne in many battels mo then seuen hundreth thousand men conquered all spayne and deuided it into diuers kingdomes to witte granade ualence portugall toledo cordua and many others
but the christians which came of gothes for the auoyding of the intollerable oppressions and horrible furie of these nations retyred and withdre we them selues into the mountaynes of arragon who at that tyme were called the cantabrians and asturians and chose one named pelagius to be their king
this pelagius forsaking the name of a gothe beganne to make very great warres against the mores but hee had therein but euill successe

wherefore his successours required ayde and helpe of the french kinges to witte of pepin charlemeine lewis and many others so that in short tyme the countreys that were lost were conquered agayne which were deuided into prouinces and after into kingdomes giuing them the names of the fortres+ses and townes whereby they were conquered to witte of the citie or towne of leon or legion the kingdome of leon of tarracon arragon of barcinone barcelone of the castle which pelagius built so soone as hee had wonne leon against the assault of the mores the kingdome of castile and after all this the kingdomes of portugall nauarre galice toledo ualence cordua and granade were exected to wit when the mores were enforced to become subiecte to christian kings and countreys at suche tyme as euery one warred against them in his owne countrey the chiefe of which were the arragonians and castilians
nowe amongst all the princes and potentates that warred vpon the heathen and infidelles ferdinando king of arragon was the most famous
but after that the countrey was out of the daunger of the mores by reason of the happie successe of the heathen warres the sayde king ferdinando suffered the mores as his predecessors had also done to liue in quiet subiection and obedience paying certayne tribute neuerthelesse their kinde of life was paynefull especially amongst those that were freemen and yet tollerable inough seeing they were not troubled or molested for the cause of religion
but as the thinges of this worlde neuer continue in one selfe and the same estate and that the heartes of kinges and princes doe often chaunge which causeth the subiectes for the present tyme to be ouercharged and burdened there were some that perswaded the sayde king to chose certayne personnes who shoulde haue an eye to their many superstitions and infidelities to the ende the mahometishe and ieweshe religion myght not any way derogate from the catholique religion

neuerthelesse wee see by experience that oftentimes they whiche make pittes for others fall them selues into them for it is an harde matter to stumble against a stone when

as they will labour to reduce others to their opinion and fantasie
the king had appoynted for this purpose the moste qualified men following therein the order of his predecessors and as a king careth not what payne hee ordinarily taketh to excell all other kinges and monarches in honour and fame euen so this king ferdinand purposed and concluded to shewe him selfe a no lesse true and politike then a warlike christian for in leauing all his warlike affayres he bestowed all his care about the aduauncing of christian religion which is a most good kingly deede and worthy great commendation as also it is the parte and duetie of a king who is the image of the most excellent and almightie king to vse iustice and true mercie vnto his subiects
in doing whereof he hath been most happie and blessed and is a figne of a true testimonie of that name which the pope gaue vnto him and to his successors kings of spaine to wit the title of most catholike king which pope gregory the thirde of that name graunted the yeere
to alfonse king of galice who also hath giuen to all spaniardes the tytles of double catholike

nowe this thing was the cause that all the mores sarazins and the iewes them selues who as the histories witnesse fithens the sacking and destruction of ierusalem hauing by the appoyntment of the emperour titus continued in these countreys haue withdrawne them selues out of spayn because they were enforced to beleeue confesse iesus christ to be the sonne of god and therefore forsooke they the countrey sought out for themselues some other better place to dwell in insomuch that many thousandes haue gotten them away vnto the borders of gibalter and from thence into affricque into diuers other places

but the rest who like well of spayne continue there still and both themselues and their children are baptised
neuertheles not long after when the spaniards perceiued how greatly the opinion of the godhead whether it be good or bad taking once impression in mens imaginations preuayled and what force it hath in mens harts when it is once rooted therin especially when in long processe of time it is successiuely learned from one to another for then they will become obstinate and neuer

forgoe it then was the exercise of the iewish religion forbidden them and as they coulde not in trueth forgette and forgoe the sayde exercise the spaniardes fell to persecuting of them and yet by a certayne kinde of iustice meaning vtterly to roote them out but it was impossible to roote out suche a people so obstinately bent and setteled in their infidelitie

a little before this there was a newe order of fryers instituted by a spaniarde

borne within the dyocesse of lexonie to witte in caliroga named dominicke whiche was called the order of the lacopins and authorized by pope honorius the thirde of that name the yeere
and this was brought in by reason of a vision that appeared to him as hee lay a sleepe by which was shewed him that the churche being shaken and readie to fall was helde vp by saint dominicke onely albeeit pope innocente the thyrde his predecessor had no will to yeelde to the institution and exection of that order of fryers

this religious order is growen into suche credite and so highly esteemed of as that the king of spaine hath committed vnto the iacopins all the affayres concerning conscience and religion and although there was before tyme a certayne forme and manner of inquisition instituted yet was it by this order of the iacopins whiche was thought to be the most holy of all the rest confirmed and established
for when they sawe that the iewes coulde neyther by the prayers preachings and admonitions of the iacopins bee conuerted they then proceeded with them after a rigorous maner and tooke vpon them the swoorde to force them to the religion if so bee they woulde not depart and gette them out of the countrey

this rodde or swoorde whereof heere intende to speake whiche the iacopins vnto this present haue vsurped agaynste these poore people hath been the cause as it is sayde that the inquisition beganne in the dayes of king ferdinand whilest hee raigned because that this manner and fourme of inquisition is more rigorous then the first was against those herefies and heretiques which they called marans

which name is amongst many christian nations against such as of a singuler

desire wishe to haue a newe religion forsaking and reiecting the olde whereupon the originall of the marans was but a litle before that knowne
for as the iewes looked for the promised messias and had alwayes in their mouthes this name maran to witte our lorde euen so the iewes which had receyued the christian fayth sayde maranathi that is to say the lorde is come

shortly after there arose a dissention and ennemitie amongst the christians to witte betweene the true christians and those which denied that the sayde sauyour was come who were called marans and condemned for a pernitious and wicked sect
this is the cause why the iewes had alwayes that name in their mouthes and that the spaniardes on the other side called them apostates and heretiques which woorde they also vsed againste all suche as helde not the true doctrine of the romishe church

and therefore the iacopins were the authours of the inquisition who deuised a better forme thereof then that that was before
the king foorth with ratified this forme and pope sextus the genoway confirmed it
without all doubt the king had great occasion to doe this for the rooting out of the wicked and reprobate doctrine of the mahometistes and iewes who went about none other thing but to burden mens consciences with the looking for the promised messias and besides the sarazins and arabians whiche the mores had sent into spayne committed great mischiefe
yea and the iewes themselues were condemned by pope sextus the yeere
because they had crucified a childe of two yeeres of age cutting off his genitories and ryght pappe

and afterwarde persed him vnto death and then cast hun into the riuer which thing they did vpon palme sunday in despite and mockery of iesus christ and to the dishonour and shame of all christians which iewes were punished and executed after they had by torture sharp examination and proofe confessed the fact

these iacopins by reason of the reputation whiche they had gotten by the setting vp of their newe order of religion called them selues the defenders of the christian doctrine and

religion not onely in spayne but also in italy and in other places of christendome where they had brought in and planted their order
the first commission they had was graunted them against the iewes and mahometists but after when their authoritie encreased and extended it selfe further then they called themselues the inquisitors of heretikes for the persecuting of all such as woulde not obserue the ordinaunces and institutions of the catholike religion
nowe that we might knowe what kynde of men these inquisitors haue beene experience hath shewed vnto vs to wit such me as through their wickednes haue peruerted all thinges
for these good gentlemen proceede euen as they are affected against the accused whiche is the cause that all men bate them especially sithence the agreement whiche the pope made betweene the foure orders of begging fryers and ye cause of this controuersie was by reason yt the inquisitors had examined certain diuines of the order of the carmelites vpo some articles of the faith of which number was iulian of bresse in lo~bardie a very famous doctor and preacher another called peter de nouellans in whose behalf mantua hath writte an excellent apollogie containing foure bookes

the pope consideryng to what ende this partiall dealing and partaking woulde come and that it woulde tende to the hurt and dishonour of either partie yea euen to the hurt greate losse of the ecclesiasticall state seeyng that eyther partie was grounded vpon a matter of smal importance and that this dissention might in time to come bring great damage to all the orders of begging fryers emongst whome the iacopins were the chiefe and most esteemed and presumed of them selues to be the best it was ordeyned at the instance earnest sute of christopher martignes that they shoulde in all places bee a like as touching the priuileges immunities which the pope had graunted the
neuerthelesse the commission of the inquisition had them hatred and made them become so odious as that many greatly suspected them because they alone had to doe with the office of the inquisition

in the ende king ferdinande was forced of necessitie to appease this discorde and discention howebeit he very louingly honourably placed in their stead very learned popish clergymen

who had long before fauoured this inquisition
and to the ende the woorshipfull iacopins should not take this depriuation and deposing of their estate in ill part the king had authorized them that they might be present in councel and at the deliberations and iudgements of the fathers inquisitors of the faith insomuch yt they may haue at this day to do with ye examination and although they haue rather lost the estimation and commanding then their being forgotten whiche brought them into so great reputation with euerie man yet for al that they hold notwithstanding ye name of inquisitors stil with good hope yt they are not so farre from the matter but that they may one day recouer the same estate and dignity

haue heretofore told you howe the inquisition came to bee exected in spain and although as then it was not so rigorously administred and put in execution as it is at this present yet had not the spaniards themselues any good will to receiue it no more then many other subiectes besides
for when the kyng of arragon woulde haue brought the inquisition into his countrie

the estates nobles of the countrie there very reuerently gaynesaide and set themselues against it first by words and supplycations but when hee woulde haue inforced them vnto it then they opposed themselues against it in deede and woulde in no wise accept of it because the estates considered that such an inquisition woulde bee hurtfull and pernicious to the libertie of the kingdome insomuche that it was not onely broughte in by a liuely force but also with great effusion of blood as well on the one side as on the other as may appeare by the death of maister aepile who was sent with full authoritie from the king to bring the inquisition into the realme of arragon for the which hee was slayue and massacred in the catheorall church of sarragouse

nowe there remayneth yet that declare vnto you the maner of the iustification of this inquisition whereby euery nation may vnderstande

whereby euery nation may vnderstande which wayes the spaniardes admynister both ciuill and criminall iustice vnto euery man

when any is accused of heresie a seriaunt is sent to cite him and setteth him a day for his personall appearance at which he must come in obey for there is not a more hurtful delay

the it but if he denie it and confesse nothing they let him passe back home to his house but one of their flies foloweth him who diligently watcheth whither he goeth and what hee doeth and if he perceiue eyther by the wordes or deedes of him that was cyted that he hath any sinister or euill meaning hee declareth it to the fathers inquisitors who againe put him in sute as followeth

when he that is accused appearing at the first day appointed confesseth all things freely or that they themselues through long examination maye drawe any thinge out of him then the accuser or buzzing flie is hid behinde the tapistrie or hanginges to heare if he confesse the trueth neuerthelesse the cited if he bee an inhabitant or citizen is sent backe home to his house but if he be a straunger they send him to prison
afterward they sende to the curate or bishoppe of the place or diocesse where the accused dwelleth to the end they would not vnadutsedly lay handes vppon the sillie lambe of a straunge shepheard and therfore they send vnto him and tell him that they haue one of his sheepe in the pound but if by aduenture the prisoner breake out of prison they send letters to the tippestaffe or marshals bayliff signifiyng vnto him the fashion and features of the face and other circumstances of the fugitiue prisoner who followeth him in euery place where he thinketh to find him vntill such time as he hath found him taken him and brought him backe to prison
this pursute is co~monly made after such as are of great estate or very learned men whom they feare wil forsake the catholike faith
when the accused is brought againe to prison they call for the keyes of his house and deliuer them vnto a publique notary who must make an inuentory of al his moueables letters writings iewels that are within his house which inuentory is deliuered into the hands of one of his rich neighbours who keepeth it vntil the sute be ended and whe the accused is condemned and iudged for an heretike then all his goods are forfaited for the behoofe of the king
for the custome is although the sentence be not capitall that all his goodes shalbe as a deuided spoile by reason of the heresie and yt the accused is not worthy to inioy his goodes but are adiudged to bee the kinges by the popes graunt

the gaoler so soone as the accused is committed to ward inquireth of him and diligently searcheth whether hee haue anye knife paper or such other like thing about him and ransacketh and searcheth him euen to his shirt
eight dayes after the inquisitors suborne the baoler to counsell the prisoner instantlye to pray that he may haue a day of hearing and the prisoner beseecheth the gaoler to craue it in his name which thing hee doeth
now when the prisoner commeth to be hearde he beseecheth the to make a short sute of it the he is admonished to discharge his conscience and acknowledge his faultes promising him all the fauour and mercy that possibly may be had if he wil conuert
and if he confesse it he is neuer a whit ye sooner deliuered therby as you may here vnderstand
but if he will not confesse his fault he is carried backe to prison and the inquisitors will tell him that they will make a short sute of it
then hee hath agayne audience graunted him but nothing is done neither will they tel him wherefore hee is accused because their meaning is to ouerthrow him by his owne confession

after this he is once more brought before the inquisitors who giue him very hard speeches and saye if thou wilt not otherwise aunsweare and discharge thy conscience thou shalte bee committed to the attorney generall who will handle thee after another manner fashion to wit he will shrewdly put thee to thy trumpe and triall
for his purpose is first of all to make a forfaiture of the goodes of the accused for the kinges behoofe
but when the cunning admonitions of the inquisitors cannot make him confesse nor yet winne him from his perseuerance constancie they then practize another way with him
for then they cause a crosse masse booke to be brought laying ye hand of the accused vpon them would put him to his othe but if he wil not sweare he is already conuinced if he doe sweare then they make dilige~t search what countrey man he is what his friends his profession companions are other such like by which they draw gather great argume~ts toke~s
but such as are wise and cu~ning wil not giue the one word to answer because they before hand see ye informatio and sifting of ye matter whereof they are accused
in the ende the action is deliuered him in writing that he may defend himselfe by his attorney and counseller who

calleth vnto hym the prysoner and taketh vpon him the defense of his cause and after that the sute is set forwarde accordyng to the custome hee addeth vnto it in writing what the lawe is exhibiting the same into the hands of the inquisitors who the third day after sende againe for the prysoner and his counsellour to come before them then they commaund hym to tel the trueth seeing yt in that auditorie they desire nothyng els but if he will confesse nothing they carry him backe to pryson and at laste the depositions are shewed him without naming the witnesses but if any man will depose any thyng against him the prysoner enquireth of the qualitie and condition of the person and it commeth also many times to passe that the inquisitors are of the opinion with the prysoner accused that if he can gesse or imagine who is his accuser by calling to minde with whom hee had any talke of matters of religion that the same man ought to brought before him and accuse him face to face
they that are subtill cunning will call for a copie of the action that they may answer it by writing
but if there are two witnesses they may then without all doubt giue iudgement and sentence of death agaynst the prysoner and one witnes is sufficient to put him to a shrewd trumpe or tryall
the aduocate fis kall pleadeth the condition and the accusers are the witnesses
two or three dayes after when as the prysoner is againe sent for to come before the inquisitors his councellour sheweth vnto him the principall articles whereof he is accused and setteth downe vnto him the substanciallest reasons and testimonies of his accusers yt he may co~sider of them whether they are like to bee true or not and besides he hiddeth the prysoner to be wel aduised to see if he can be able to bring it to passe to vnderstand what they are that haue wit nessed matter against him yt he might challenge them for doing whereof certaine dayes of deliberatton are giuen to the prisoner to record with himselfe who or what his enemies be which are able to depose against him and lay any thing to his charge and if he cannot deuise who they should be god haue mercy on him for he hath then no more to say
but if he can gesse what they are or name the no man telleth him yt it is they but his councellour telleth it to him secretly then he is asked before the inquisitors by what way or meane hee is able to challenge the accuser
and besides if hee woulde excuse and purge himselfe or that hee bee

able to prooue that hee hath beene alwayes a great friende vnto the cleargie and obserued all the ceremonies of the churche to wit that hee hath hearde masse beene confessed and worshipped the crosse and images to bee short that hee hath done al cleane co~trarie to that that his accusers haue deposed which must bee ordinarily done within niene dayes and then his cause is merueilously well amended howbeit all the excuses that hee can make therein are to no purpose except there come in no witnesses against him when the contrarie are examined by the iudge they conclude vpon the mattter and the aduocate fiskall prayeth an instaunce that it may bee ended as it pleaseth hym
after this certaine fryers and doctors of diuinitie examine his beliefe that is to say they make an interpretation of whatsoeuer the prisoner hath spoken of faith and if in theyr opinion hee hath saide well hee is adiudged to be set free and at libertie and yet notwithout his great domage which hee shall both feele and smell of againe as followeth

when they can get nothing at all of him

but that hee is able to excuse hymselfe they then put hym to a shrewde trumpe or tryall for first they bryng him through many odde doores of certaine caues vnder the ground vnto a place where the iudge sitteth
and thither presently commeth the hangman apparrelled in a blacke linnen cassocke much like vnto the garmente which the spaniardes weare vppon maundie thursday when as for pennance sake they beate the~selues vntil the blood trickle down withall
theyr head and face is couered with an hood hauing no more but
holes in it for to looke out at in this sort commeth in the hangman apparrelled to terrifie the prysoner as if the diuell himselfe woulde correct him for his sinnes when this is done the iudge admonisheth him to tell the truth procesting that if through torture any leg or limme of his be broken that the fault and scathe shall bee his and lye in his owne necke
after this the poore prysoner is shaken out of all his clowtes saue that they tye a lynnen ragge to couer his priuities
anone after hee maketh the hangman a signe what torment hee shall haue

nowe the ordinary torment of the prysoner is this first his handes are bounde together behinde his backe and his body being

trysed vp into the ayre with a tormentrous engine they bind to his feete instruments of pron of twentie fiue pounds weight then the inquisitors say vnto him vnderstand thou fellow that if thou wilt not confesse the troth assure thy selfe we will leaue thee heere to die in these torments in this paine hangeth this wretched and miserable patient all his weeping and teares helping him nothing at all
then the hangman letteth him slip at one choppe almost to the ground by meane whereof one ioynt falleth from another
when this is done the hangman giueth him the second and third charge and then getteth hym vp and thus this vnnaturall torture and horrible torment lasteth from niene of the clocke vntill it bee eleuen or twelue
when the prysoner continueth constant and will confesse nothyng hee is carried to the churche where the barbour surgeons put him to three tymes somuch paine
the patient beeing in this miserable estate they will him to bee confessed or shriuen whereupon they finde of what religion hee is and if so bee that hee will confesse himselfe to the priest they haue a notarie hid behinde some clothes to write and note all the prysoners confession because hee maketh him to speake distinctly and a loude
then the priest telleth him that hee hath power aucthoritie to deliuer him out of the handes of the fathers inquisitors
by these and such like words they sometimes deceiue and beguile the poore prysoners for if they confesse any thing they bring their owne testimonie against them to render them punishable
then the inquisitors giue it ope~ly out both abroad and in the prison that the prysoner hath confessed enough and besides hath accused and named all his companious and fellow brethren although it bee nothyng so
which thyng causeth the neighbours that haue hearde of ye great crosses of the patient accuse the~selues before any body els hath accused them because they woulde be reconciled to the fathers and inquisitors of the faith thinking they shoulde bee out of all danger when as they had once confessed their faults

the hurte and sicke prysoners are carried to an hospitall where the surgeons and seruitours of the hospital deale reasonably with them vntill suche time as they are carryed backe againe to pryson
the notarie and gailor or keeper of the

pryson twise a moneth visit the prysoners to see them haue such necessaries as they want and to finde fault with those which eyther take away theyr victuals from them or doe them any hurt

when the day of giuing sentence and of execution draweth neere to wit two dayes before they sende for the prysoners whome the inquisitors commaund to tell and she we them of all theyr moueable and vnmoueable goods willyng them to conceale nothing to the end that they which are in their houses bee not accused of theft or that they themselues by the iudgementes of god fall not dead to the grounde as ananias and saphyra his wife did at the apostles feete because they lyed and kept backe some of their goods

the night before the day appointed they are shryuen that day in the morning the officers of the inquisition bryng vnto them saint bennets furniture of apparrel which is a gally cassocke without fleeues much like vnto the romanes clokes couered with blacke linnen cloth
and vpon their heads they haue a bishops myter made of paper vpon which is painted a man sitting by the fire

and the man aforesaide hath his hands bound to his necke who first is led about the flame and afterwarde to the fire
when he is brought to the place of execution the schollers goe singing before him and as many as are condemned in any pecuniarie or bodily punishment on eyther side of them follow the seriant of the inquisition and besides two fryars or iesuites to exhort and admonish the citizens ouer besides there followe the sworne officers iudges presidents gouernours and lieuetenants of the king for that countrie with many noble men gentlemen being al assembled together in theyr pallaces

moreouer there are the priests and chapiter of the cathedral church abbots and pryors and a great many moe to shed innocent blood
but the aduocate fiskal and the atturney generall ryde also vnto the place of execution hauing a banner of red damask carried before them on the one side wherof is armes richly imbrodered with the name of the pope who hath confirmed and established the inquisitors on the other side armes

and the name of king ferdinando and on the toppe of the pole of the banner head is a siluer crosse gylt
there are also on horsebacke the fathers inquisitors of the faith and their officers
after this so honorable a troupe followe a great multitude of people who come twentie mile of to this goodly feast they goe all together vnto a great plaine where two scaffoldes are set vp the one for the accused and the other for the fathers inquisitors amongest whome one of them maketh an oration in the prayse and honour of the inquisition and in the discommending and abolishyng of all heresies
this oration beeing ended one beginneth openly to pronounce the iudgements vpon the poore pacients orderly one after another beginning first with these that haue the most gracious easiest kinde of punishment
after the publication of these sentences the chiefe and head inquisitor singeth certaine collects to wit oremus and quaesumus for the conuertes praying also vnto god yt it would please hym of his meere fauour and grace to graunt them perfeuerance in the romish catholike faith vnto their liues ende
when hee hath thus saide al the cleargie sing the psalme miserere mei deus which being ended the inquisitor singeth certaine versicles whom the singing men answere in theyr musical notes crying yelling and bleating out like calues as they are
last of all the saide inquisitor singeth the absolution whereby the penitents are absolued of the errour of heresie but not of the punishment or paine which is incontinently to be executed with out fauour or mercy yea contrary to all right and reason

after yt this absolution is giuen the inquisitors cause an oth to hee ministred to the people to wit that they shall liue and die in the faith obedience and religion of the romish church and shall defend the same and the inquisitors in all points and against al men hazarding theyr bodies against all such as would do them any hurt or set vpon them
ouer and besides that they shall renounce and abture whatsoeuer is contrary to the dectrine and institutions or ceremonies of the romish church moreouer that they shall withall their power and might defend the holy office and all their officers ministers or seruants therof taking both one and other to witnes for the safetie assurance of the matter

and if therebe amongest these penitents or conuertes any cleargie man

bee hee religious man or priest that is founde to haue deserued lesse punishment then death that man is degraded onely by wordes
this degradation is done by the bishoppe clad in all his pontificalibus and by none other by which hee is interdited from the administration of his office benifice and priestly dignitie vntill such time as the pope shall haue absolued enhabiled againe or restored hym to his dignitie
but yf the fathers inquisitors haue condemned and iudged him to death then the patient is degraded in very deede the selfe same day as followeth first hee is apparrelled in all his churchrobes as if hee should go to masse
all which are taken from him by one that playeth the bishops part vsing certaine ceremonies and wordes as hee bereaueth him of them one after another vtterly cleane contrary to the ceremonies and wordes that are vsed vnto hym when he is priested
after this they scrape his hands lippes and crowne with a glasse or rasor to take away the holie oyle wherewith he was annoynted
all these ceremonies are openly vsed in the sight of the whole world

nowe when all the sentences are pronounced the priestes degraded as aforesaid the seculer magistrate receiueth them that must dye accordyng to the appointment and commaundement of my masters the inquisitors to execute and dispatch them out of the worlde at the ordinarie place hauing with them suche diuelish and shamelesse proctours as neuer cease callyng vpon them to renounce the truth which they had confessed and receiued

but if the inquisitors vnderstande that there are some of the that haue not truly repented but that the woolfe is couered wt ye sheepes skinne they deliuer them into the te~porall magistrates hands they beseech him to deale fauourably with them and to beware that they breake none of theyr lymmes nor yet drawe any blood of them and in theyr chiefe giuing of iudgement they say seeing that the paine and trauell which wee haue taken about to conuert these persons is all in vaine and to no purpose wee deliuer them into the handes of the temporall magistrate to bee punished according to lawe and iustice yet beeseeching him that if so bee they shall acknowledge their errours and bee conuerted

that they wil shew them al the fauour and mercy that they may possibly

and all the rest which are not adiudged to dye are sent backe agayne to prison but the next daye in the morning they that are condemned to be whipt are scourged rounde about the streetes some are condemned to the gallies other some to perpetual imprisonment and some of the rest to weare benets furniture and carry him about
but if any of those happen againe to slip and fall into their handes they are then without al redemption
thou hast now gentle reader heard the causes occasions of the spaniards warring in the low countries of their warring heretofore against the mores in spayne by who thou maist vndersta~d from whence the very right spring head of these dolorous waters come wherwith they had ouerflowed drowned the low cou~tries had not god of his meere mercy prouided for the same
and besides thou shalt forthwith vndersta~d of wonderful things to wit who by who what time wherfore ye spaniards are dispersed all the lowe countries about
and therfore beseech thee consider whether the matters aforesaid set forth in the
booke be not the amiable kynd deeds of a liberal duchesse against the horrible cruelty of the inquysitio truly she hath geuen vs hony mingled with great bitternes for it is wel inough knowen to al the world what cruelty vnmercifulnes shee hath vsed against the poore and miserable subiects

the king of spayne fearing that the protestantes religion woulde encrease and grow in the low countreyes to the great hurt and disaduauntage of the catholike church and losse of the inquisition sent very earnestly as hath beene heretofore in the first booke set downe vnto his sister the lady margaret duchesse of parma willyng her to preuent this empayre downfall
but when he vnderstood that the matter waxed euery daye woorse then other and that the duchesse dealt not cruelly enough against his subiects he sent out of spaine don ferdinand aluares of toledo duke of alua

to be gouernour and liuetenant general of the low countries
who embarqued him selfe with his men of warre at barcelone in spaine in the moneth of may
sayling towards genues with the wind in ye

poupe
the king had commanded all the captaines of ye realmes of naples scicile lombardie and the rest to march with their bandes vnto the territorie of millaine which they performed whiles the duke lay sicke of an ague there was a mightie company of men of warre come together chiapin vitelli was his lieuetenant and gabriel serbellon master of the ordenance

when the duke of alua was ryd of his ague

hee tooke his iourney through sauoy towardes the count of burgoine hauing with him eight thousand spaniards eight thousand sauoya~s a thousand light horse and from thence through the dukedome of lorayne towardes luxenbourgh where he put into pay the counte albert of lodron with three thousand almaines three hundred horse and came downe together into the low countries vnto bruxelles
and there he imparted vnto the dutches ye cause of his comming shewing vnto her his commission authoritie and power which when she had seene shee sent to the king her brother desiring leaue that shee might returne to her husband the duke of parma and hauing resigned her estate and office vnto the duke of alua

she departed out of the lowe countries the tenth of apryll to the no small griefe and sorrowe of the people who considered that the duke had taken vpon him all authoritie and power and meant to continue the dewse which hee had conceiued in his brayne fauoured and fortified by the strength of the spaniardes whiche were with him to the great and myserable ruine and destruction of the lowe countries

nowe when the duke of alua had gotten into his possession all the townes and fortresses well furnished with spanishe souldiers hee caused the commissions of the institution of the inquisition to be proclaimed commanding euery man in the name of the king to obserue the catholike religion and obey the church of rome

afterwarde

hee ordeined a newe councel called the councel of troubles of twelue councellours who shoulde haue full power to giue sentence iudge and pronounce sentence of death and in many places put in new magistrates as pleased himselfe
this done hee by reason of the troubles alreadie passed caused a great number of the people to be taken besides those whome the

dutches of parma had before imprisoned and executed on them cruell iustice

moreouer he caused a proclamation to bee made for the fugitiues assigning them a day for their comming in and whoseuer missed his goods to be confisked
this foresaid duke at his first entrance greatly dissembled and would in no wise punishe any for the troubles passed with any corporall payne to the ende to feede the people with a vaine hope and saide that the king had giuen a generall pardon for all the hurly burly that had beene committed against the catholike religion for he hoped therby to get into his clouches the counts of egmont and horne
but after that the inquisition and the councell of troubles were ordeined instituted the inquisitors at the first chop caused many to bee imprisoned christened againe the protestantes children married againe all such as had been married in other churches in the catholike churches
and some of the fugitiues which returned home to their houses vpon the vaine hope aforesaide were sent to prison by the councell of troubles condemned to death insomuch that blood was there spilt as plentifully as if it had been water
for many had their heads cut off some were drowned and some hanged

in the beginning of september

the duke of alua with full power and authoritie tooke from the lordes and citizens of gaunt the keyes of the citie and deliuered the castle into the handes of colonel alfonse a spaniarde
the gauntois complained hereof to the counte egmont gouernour of flaunders which count went to the duke of alua in their defence and tolde him that be had done them great wrong the duke answered him that which hee had done was for the benefite and seruice of his maiestie howbeit this complaint of the gauntois stuck very neere his heart

when the estates of the lowe countries were met together at the citie of bruxelles

the duke made them partakers of the authoritie and power which the king had giuen him and sent the countes of egmont and horne to pryson as followeth
the duke sent for them to come to councell and when they were there he brought them into a little hall or parlor as it were as though hee woulde haue had some secrete conference with them

in which hall was his sonne accompanied with certeine spanish souldiers armed who tooke them and kept them prisoners
the dukes sonne caused the countes weapons to wit their rapiers and daggers to be take from them telling them that they must become his maiesties prisoners

asking them also if those were the weapons wherewith they had defended the low countryes in great despite and anger threw away their rapiers and daggers
this being done the duke commaunded the captayne of the castle of gaunt to receiue the spaniards into the castle which was done
the same day also were taken prisoners the lorde of backezele iohn casimbrot a counseller of the count egmount and the count hornes secretary within a few daies after the saide egmount and horne were carryed to the castle of gaunt by three thousand spaniardes
the same day likewise did the count lodron take the lorde stralen neere antwerpe and brought him to bruxelles and the saide lodron made an inuentorye of all his goodes and sealed it with his seale
not long after there were many taken prysoners in the lowe countrey whiche caused a great number of the lowe countrey to gette them ouer into englande as also into germanye and the east countries amongest whom one of the chiefest was the counte charles mansfield with manye gentlemen captaynes and other souldiers

the
of december

after that the duke of alua was arryued in the lowe countrey beganne the castle of antwerpe to be built so strengthened with rampares and platformes as that the like was not to be found the buylder and engyner whereof was one pachiotto a sauoyan whom the duke had appoynted for that purpose
nowe when this castle was made defenceable and meet to receiue a garnison the duke of alua came to antwerpe with foure hundreth horse leauing the rest of the souldiers at bruxelles but as he was riding towards antwerpe the munition house at malynes hadde taken fire
when the duke was come to antwerpe hee caused fiue bulwarkes to bee buylt within the castle giuing to euerye of them his seuerall proper name
the first was called duke the seconde toledo the thirde ferdinande the

fourth in the honour of his rase and stocke toletan the fist in ye honour of the enginare or maister workeman pachiotto

the very same time

the frenche desired the duke of alua of ayde and assistaunce and because he would continue the amitye betweene the two kinges hee sent vnto them the count arenberge with twelue hundred low countrey men and burgonions and two thousand spaniardes and burgonions
in the guydones of the horsemen was a deuise figured with two armed handes thrusting themselues out of an azure cloude and out of two blacke ones clipping one another in manner of a crosse and at the ende of eche cloude was a kingly crowne with a crosse
and vpon the
blacke ones were two hartes and two crownes interlaced and bound together with a silke rybbande and in the middest was a crosse a chalice and a singing cake which ribbande houng verye lowe garnished with very riche knottes
this deuise was interpreted as followeth the two cloudes did signifie the diuinitie the two hartes the amitye and vnitye of the two kinges the armed handes their force and power the chalice the catholike religion for defence whereof warres were made in both the realmes

for the building of the saide castle of antwerpe whiche was made to keepe them of the citie in obedience and awe it was agreed by the great counsell of the saide citie that there should be gathered foure hundred thousand florins which were taken out of the hundreth pennie two tenthes and two twenties of all the moueable goodes whiche were within the iurisdiction of the same citie for ye receipt of which were appoynted for supertendentes maister paul schuermans sheriffe frauncis crosse and giles smith merchantes
this castle being as it were almoste finished the duke caused an image of brasse to be set vppe in the middest of the saide castle very artificiallye wrought by that excellent woorkeman iames ioughelinke of bruxelles liuelye representing the sayde duke hauing vnder his feete a body with two heades representing the chiefe gouernour of the gueses as hereafter more at large shalbee declared and then the duke going from antwerpe returned to bruxelles

in this meane while at the instance of the attorney general there was by a publike edict of his ma proclaymed cited to appeare to wit the nienteenth of ianuary william of nassau prince of orange who now long time agoe departed out of brabant kept himselfe within the county of nassau the tenure whereof ensueth

his ma beyng enformed by the attorney general

how william of nassau prince of orange being as well by the emperour charles the fift of famous memory his lord father as also by his ma aduaunced to high and great dignity as to bee made knight of the order of the golden fleese a counseller of the councell of estate and gouernour of the county of bourgoyne of holland zealande and the honour of vtright by which may well be vnderstoode the great good will and louing affection that his ma beareth him and contrariwise the vnthankfulnesse of the sayde prince who hath otherwise behaued himselfe and against all the duetie of a true and faithfull subiect
which prince hauing forgotten both his honour othe fidelity geuen and promised vnto his maiesty hath shewed himselfe to be the originall cause defender fautor of all the rebels traytours who foorthwith after his maiesties departure out of the low countries with others many moe haue sought by al meanes possible to inuest and take possession of the sayd low countries chalenge vnto himselfe the whole gouernment
and besides that after many practizes without regard of promise faith and fidelity hath by armes gone about to aduaunce and oppose him selfe against his saide maiesty and sacke his countrey of brabant whiche hath as yet taken no effect onelie because hee is not of power and force able to bring it to passe and yet neuerthelesse he hath secretly practized to suborne his maiesties subiectes and perswade them to leaue of the good affection and obedience whiche they haue alwaies borne vnto his maiestie insomuche that their good affection shoulde bee conuerted into horror and ill wil vnder the pretence of religion persuading them by secrete deuises that his maiestie woulde bring into brabant the inquisition of spayne and that they ought to set themselues against it as also the sayde orange hath heeretofore encouraged and stirred vp the greater part of the nobilitye

to confederate with him by othe to oppose them selues against the ordinaunces and commissions whiche so long agoe haue byn obserued in the countrey of brabant
moreouer that the saide orange hath helde within his houses as well at breda as at bruxelles secrete congregations and assemblyes to ayde assist and comfort one another as also haue heere and there put themselues in armes against his maiestye ouer and besides the of brederode being made captayne chiefe of the gueses hath taken in hande by the counsell of the sayde oraunge to fortifie his towne of viane against his maiesties forces yea and that at antwerpe although it belongeth vnto his highnes he caused souldiers to bee leuyed notwithstanding his graces commandements before published to the contrary which souldiers were carried downe by water with all kynde of prouision to viane as also the sayde orange sent vnto the sayde brederode certayne peeces of artillery and in some places forbidding the receiuing in of any of his maiestyes garrisons and taking from his maiestye the entraunce to the water
furthermore as he was sent to antwerpe to appease the troubles and sedytions of the citizens hee tooke vppon him to doe more then was his commission in sufferyng all heretykes and sectaryes to haue ye liberty of their religion and gaue his consent that they might buylde churches and erect consistoryes whiche hath beene the very originall as all men well knowe of all the mischiefes which followed and hath also accorded and suffered to cause there to be leuyed and disbursed money for the paying and entertayning of souldiers with many other thinges by him committed which the saide attorney generall in time place if the necessity of the cause shal require wil more at large declare all whiche doyngs tend to none other end but to enioye the countrey of brabant which of right apperteineth vnto his maiesty wherein he hath most grieuously endangered him selfe vnto his ma so that he is no way to be excused but woorthy to be punished and hys faultes and offences to be layde wyde open before his face
wherefore the attorney general beseecheth his highnes to graunt an inditement of high treaso to be drawe against ora~ge with this clause for so it is our wil pleasure
when his ma had cousidered of the articles which the attorney

generall had set downe he willed and commaunded that euery man to the vttermost of his power should ayde and assist the said attorney generall for the taking of the sayd orange prisoner and to send him with a sufficient guard to bruxelles to the duke of alua his graces trusty and welbeloued cosin lieuetenant to who this thing was especially committed yt he might be punished for an example to all others according to the qualitie of his offences transgressions and rebellion and if so be he cannot be taken and layd holde on let him be cyted by publike edictes vppon paine of confiscation of all his goodes personally to appeare peremptorily within fifteene dayes before the sayde duke of alua at bruxelles or some other place of the low countries to aunsweare to all suche articles as his maiesties attorney generall shall laye to his charge
and if so be he appeare not at the day prefixed appoynted then let the duke of alua proceede against him according to the declaration aforesaid simply and without any other solemnitye of ordinary lawe and iustice
but in case he bee gone out of the lowe countries as his ma is so aduertised his graces expresse will is that the inditeme~t be read in the city of bruxelles by a publike edict and a copy thereof set vp vpon the doores of the towne house and vpon all the church doores whersoeuer this inditement shalbe published to the end he shal not pretend ignorance which inditement shall be of as great force as if it had byn read pronounced before oranges owne face

the same day was likewise indited and summoned

anthonie de la laing connt of hoogstrate to appeare before the duke of alua to defend himselfe and aunsweare vnto the articles set downe by the attorney generall in forme following howe that the lorde of hoogstrate euen from his youth had beene by his meiestie aduaunced vnto great honour and dignitie and especially to the order of the golden fleese and to bee one of the bande of his maiesties owne ordinaunce and besides to honourable ambassades to the emperour and to other princes whereby he might very well consider of the singuler affection that his grace bare him and of the good meaning hee had to exalt him in time to come to a farre higher degree of honour yet notwithstanding hee forgetting these benefites and degenerating

from the vertue of his predecessors and auncestors who alwayes behaued themselues towardes their natural lord as true and faithfull subiectes hath so muche forgotten himselfe as that he hath with all his power and might assisted and taken parte with the prince of orange fauouring him both with his counsell and otherwise to set forward the troubles whiche two yeeres past had byn in his maiesties low countries and first the saide hoogstrate did assist treate and talke of in his castle with the prince of orange and his adherentes of maltitious and seditious counsels whereat his maiesties subiects were greatly offended in so much that meanes and occasions were giuen to ye wicked to commence new practises who after the exhibiting of one supplication engendred many seditions disorders and rashe parts as euery man wel enough kneweth
the which sedition ye of hoogstrate did not only not appease admonish the citizens to desist and leaue of as being against the authority of his ma but contrariwise encouraged them therto personally was all in al to fauour them as afterward in very deed it we~l appeared when as he counselled them to renewe their supplication which was the onely cleane contrary meane and way to make the countrey of brabant readie to become duetifull and obedient but rather enbolden them to put in execution their deuises practizes
and after as he was with the prince appoynted to ye gouernme~t of ye city of antwerpe to keepe ye people in the obedience fidelity of his ma the said hoogstrate committed grieuous acts and amongst others openly defended the of brederode against his ma wittingly suffered souldiers to bee leuied sent them by water to vyane with al necessary prouisio wil cease to speake of the greate fauour and affection that hee hath shewed to the people wherby he mainteined the seditious parte and tooke more authority vpon him then his ma the duchesse of parma his welbeloued sister then lady regent of the iowe countries very vndutifully behauing himselfe towardes her not doing that honour which apperteined to her highnes
to be short he so exalted himselfe yea rather so for forgot himselfe as yt he published in the towne of malines belonging to his maiesty a commandement and edict without the charge and appointme~t of the said duchesse being then gouernesse whiche caused

the people become more vnruly and goe on to doe whatsoeuer they lusted insomuch that by this meane he encouraged the people to disobey the king after yt he had both writ se~t some of the nobility vnto the
lastly he was with the prince of orange and his consorts at tennond to take counsel howe they might put themselues in armes against his ma to driue him out of braba~t and the regent his lieutenant which thing had long before byn concluded amongest them so that there remained nothing els but the putting of it in execution that was onely for wante that they were not of power able to goe on with it
all whiche things many others which in time season might be declared are the acts of a rebellious disobedie~t subiect by which he hath committed high treason therfore worthy to be punished in exa~ple to others beseeching eftsoones his ma to graunt him authority to be able to proceede vpon life and death against the saide hoogstrate

during this time the duke of alua vnderstanding of the pacification in france that the almaines which serued ye prince of condie meant to come into flanders as ye king of spaines ambassador had both sent and writ vnto him he sent his army of spaniards and italians vnto the borders of liege and also the ierges with two thousand walonnes he farther gaue co~mission to take into pay the discharged italians which serued the french king

the
of aprill william prince of orange

and anthonie de la laing count of hoogstrate aunsweared to the inditement of the attorney generall of brabant and layde all the fault of the troubles warres dissentions and seditions vpon the inuentors and authors of the inquisition of spayne and discharged them selues before the counsell of troubles especially of high treason accusing eftsoones the duke of alua of his tyrannye who was so angrie with them for it as that hee declared their goodes to bee confisked and made a seisure of the counte of buren the prince of oraunge his sonne who studyed at louayne and sente him into spayne quyte against the priuiledges of the vniuersitye
the contente of the aunsweare and defence of these noble men is this

whises the prince of orange had authority and gouernement he from the first beginning of the troubles and dissentions was very painefull and diligent to appease and pacifie all the troubles that were in the countrey of brabant and will leaue vnto the reader to weigh and consider of the estate wherein the sayde countrey of brabant stoode both before and after the troubles of the lowe countries and firste tell of the notable warres that the emperour charles the fifte of famous memorie and after him king phillip of spayne beeyng lordes of the lowe countreyes made as it were for the space of tenne yeeres with the frenche king and what effusion of bloud happened in fraunce the ouerthrowe of many thousandes of menne may sufficiently testifie and the princes and frenche noblemen and other nations whiche assisted king henrie who bestowed both their bodies and goodes in his seruice
as also maye the ruined and destroyed townes fortresses castles and others or if they were well garnisoned yet they were fayne to shake off their obedience from their naturall lorde and sweare newe obedience to a newe lorde others that were vtterly ruined and destroyed were brought and reduced into villages and the citizens and all the rest of the inhabitants were sacked and brought to such pouerty as that they were all the daies of their life very poore and miserable
these are the fruits of cursed warre which alas continued ouer long

but as by the suppressing of the warres in brabant and the countries neere adioyning the people beganne to prosper and the countrey floorish the people of the lowe countries were grieuously charged vexed with the spanish inquisition whiche daily augmented by reason of the increasing of ye reformed religion insomuch that it was great wonder how the saide inquisitiou was so long borne withall and yet it is most manifestly knowen yt the subiects of the said low countries were alwaies ready not only to yeeld all their duetifull obedience but also hazard their liues and goods in his ma seruice
on the other side the nobility both did and shewed all their duetye fidelitie and louing affection and as for the estates they richely gaue for the maintenaunce of the warre a maruellous

summe of money and that so with good heartes as that it was impossible for any man to imagine anye signe or token of mislyking in them so that it is most like to be true that the sayd lowe countries haue so loued his maiesty as that they behaued them selues as faithfull subiectes in all thinges which touched the obedyence and reuerence due to him to the ende that his lowe countries might alwayes be assured against all forren inuasion and warre

seeyng then that the subiectes especially the nobility so obediently and seruiceably stood vnto his maiesty and in the end gouerned the warres which continued so long the subiects had a woonderful great hope that his maiesty would procure that the sayd low countries should be franke and free from the daunger of ciuill warres
and so long as the subiects saw al things goe well forward they alwayes continued constaunt in their obedience and fidelity and although the brabanders who heeretofore flourished in all kynde of trade of merchandise had in the former warres beene in great perill and daunger yet for all that they gathered a greate peece of money so that it is too too manifest that the king was well assured agaynst all the force of any monarches and princes and that which is more beyng reconcyled with his enemies he was not onelye discharged of all the debtes whiche grewe by reason of the warres but also in a very fewe yeeres attayned to woonderful great wealth prosperity and honour
for when his maiesty was raysed vy to so high a degree of honour forren potentates princes feared him because his subiectes so honoured and reuerenced him and his maiesty was thought to be the most mighty monarch yea so farre passing al others as that it must of necessity needes bee granted that whatsoeuer they were that would goe about to impeach and disturbe this his so great good felicity must vndoubtedly by this notable vuyon be oppressed and beate downe iusomuch that all they haue greatly offended whiche haue busied themselues about matters preiudiciall or hurtfull to his maiestie and the common weale and done such thinges as are worthy punishme~t to the example of others whe as the warres being suppressed they haue renewed fresh co~motions and caused ciuill warres and therfore the prince of orange doth verily and stedfastly

beleeue that they which haue brought the countrey of brabant into this extreme misery calamity bondage ought likewise to be punished and chastised

and sith the prince of orange is publikely in the indit ement accused by the attorney generall to be the original first mouer of the alterations happened in brabant he is co~ten ted to abyde the paynes in the said inditement expressed if so be it bee true that the attorney hath set downe
the sayde attorney generall affirmeth that the prince is ambitious and of an vnbrydeled mynde to gouerne whereuppon ensueth that hee hath a purpose to take vppon him and enioy an other mans office and estate and hath pretended nothing els in al his counsels and affayres
for the confutation of this article as the originall and chiefe poynt of the complaynt of the attorney generall it is sufficient that he referre the matter ouer vnto all such as know the prince of orange by whom it may be vnderstoode if euer hee was desirous of rule and besides that he hath well gouerned his goodes and possessions whiche by gods grace were lefte and geuen vnto him by whiche hee hath more increased his honour and reputation then by any other charge that euer he had
and al men know that if the prince had sought and hunted after his owne particular gayne that hee had a farre better waye and meane to haue heaped riches together by which hee might haue come to estimation and authority there held him then to be at great charge and expenses in court in hope to come to authority by others procurement so that all the world knoweth that ye prince in all his actions and behauiour neuer sought his owne particuler benefite

and besides the prince neuer once thought to drawe awaye his ma subiects from their obedience due vnto the same notwithstanding that the people alwayes most earnestly loued him but contrariwise continually to keepe them in a good liking of his ma but the very cause in truth of this their estraunging them is the cruelty of the commissions newly published
this then is the onelie waye and meane that maye bee saide that the prince euen to the last cast hath alwayes shewed his good and sincere affection vnto his maiesty his lowe countries

and it must of necessitie be graunted that the prince at no hand hath at any time ment to take vpon himselfe any authoritie ouer his maiestie which as some thought might more commodiously haue been conserued in tranquilitie and peace whereupon followeth that the prince his meaning was farre otherwise
for his maiesties authoritie coulde no way haue been peaceably conserued if so be the countrey of brabant should hane been conserued in her auncient and former prosperitie but by consenting to the exercise of the cruell inquisition
for he ment to oppose him selfe agaynst the sayde inquisition all which his actions doe witnesse that he is no whit ambitious but cleane contrary
for long before that time hee had resigned his dignitie of the counsell of estate as also the dignitie of the kinges chiefe officer of the treasure that arose vppon penall statutes which is the meetest office of all other to binde the estates to be beholden vnto him yea hee was offered to take vppon him the gouernmente of altogether if hee woulde haue accepted of it whereunto all the rest of the nobilitie laboured most carefully to attayne but the prince so abhorred this ambition as that hee resigned these two dignities into his maiesties handes when he considered that hee coulde doe his maiestie but slender seruice in counsell by reason of certaine beastly dealings which bereaued him of the meane for that seruice

neuerthelesse when his maiestie had appointed him to be of his counsell hee so duetifully administzed this function and dignitte as his conscience witnessed vnto him to be necessarie to each mans most profitte although he afterwarde perceiued that his maiesties loue altered and abated through the practise and deuise of one or two noble men

but after that his maiestie had aduisedly euery way considered of the prince of oranges good and faithful seruice as he departed out of zeland towards spaine hee most earnestly besought the said to be of his counsell who after long excuse accepted thereof
nowe when as the prince saw that they helde on their olde course and far otherwise then his had commanded and appointed him two yeeres after or neere there about he agayne besought that he might be discharged
wherefore the we deuises were more and more set forwarde which were the

causes of the beginning of the troubles and commotions by which the inquisition was somewhat moderated and a fresh surceassed but as in these countries the regiment of aimaines as a necessary thing was brought into them for their defence and safegarde they were suffered to haue sermons as well in the townes as in the fieldes abroade and namely in diuers places some except where the reformed religion had been alreadie accepted of in the countreys neere there about kept the exercise of the sayde religion secretly whereby the sayde reformed religion dayly encreased in this so populous countrey so that at the last in fewe yeeres the name of the inquisition became very odious considering that by it aboue fifcie thousande had been put to death in europe and a greater number were enforced to forsake their goodes kinsfolkes and all their friendes and spende their liues in perpetuall miserie which thinges did not onelye cause great alterations and changes but an hatred against the inquisition insomuch that in many places the officers durst not openly put it in execution but very secretly and yet not without great perill and danger of commotion
which thing some of the officers can beare witnesse of who had some of the prisonners taken from them agaynst their willes whiche caused all suche as experience had taught long before to foresee that the sayde inquisition woulde bee the cause of some trouble and commotion if in continuaunce of time it were not wisely prouided for and good order taken about it

the queene of hongrie then gouernesse of the low countrey greatly feared this mischiefe and miserie
wherefore shee tooke her voyage to ausbourgh towardes her brother the emperour of famous memorie charles the fifth with whome shee so handled her businesse as that the crueltie of the counsell of trent then concluded vpon shoulde be moderated and that the antwerpians and brabanders that woulde not receyue the inquisition shoulde bee quite and cleane rid of it as afterward they were

nowe whiles the countrey of brabante had beene in quiet a good long time throughe the aucthoritie of the gouernesse and that all thinges were ordered by the aduise of the

counsell of estate the attorney generall thrust himselfe in to treate or deale immediatly after his ma departure eyther alone or els with some tyrannous noblemen of in matters of great charge and waight and immediately signified vnto his ma of their peruerse counsel
when the king was aduertised that the inquisition had not his right course and proceeding he was very angry pensiue neuerthelesse some curteous noblemen earnestly besought him to haue an hearty remembrance of the seruices good deedes which his subiectes had done in the former warres so rule himself as the state of the time required abolishe all newe deuises as the new bishoppes the inquisition according to the priuiledges of the countries seeing that some wicked men had practized these new deuises in the lowe countries contrary to the state of the time and against all the immunities and priuiledges of the lowe countries and that those thinges might be abolished considering that the troubles and commotion in fraunce which happened there by reason of the inquisition are appeased and suppressed by the ceasing therof
moreouer that the erection and institution of the new bishoprickes is hurtfull to the forraine archbishoppes and bishoppes whiche haue any iurisdiction and diocesse in these low countries
for this and many other reasons therefore they of the lowe countries considering that the newe deuises were the causes of great misery and manye mischiefes if in tyme they were not prouided for and remedyed made complaynt vnto the gouernesse who by and vppon the deliberation and determination of the counsell of estate dispatched the baron of montigni knight of the order and sent him poste into spayne to his maiesty with commission to declare vnto the king the estate and generall mislyking of the lowe countries whiche hath risen by reason of these newe deuises and that for this cause it is come to passe that the nobilitye of brabant to meete with this mischiefe and misery haue beene pressed and constrayned especially to haue theyr desire and demaunde accomplished alwayes hoping that his maiesty would satisfie their request or that he would at the least moderate the charge and burden wherwith they were too too much oppressed and especially the byshoppes and abbots whiche heretofore flourished in brabant

were nowe greatly endammaged wherfore they haue likewise sent their deputies vnto his ma as also ye antwerpians for the withstanding and letting of the inquisition and the institution of the new bishops
the which message at sometimes had kept in suspence the troubles of the low countries because euerye man hoped that the sayde deputies and ambassades might by his maiesties good counsell and conclusion receiue some good ordinance for their aduancement and profite accordingly as the affayres required
but that the reformed religion was so rooted euery where as that in some places sermons were openly preached to wit at valence tournay and other cities and townes the reason was that because the liberty of the religio in france was agreed vpo the low countrey me hoped verily thought the~selues to haue as wel deserued for their seruices passed towards their king his preside~ts as ye frenchme towards the french king and therefore that they ought likewise to bee agreed haue the liberty of conscience granced of them

for it might be manifestly seene that it was impossible for ye auncient romish ordinances to be obserued and kept in ye countries aforesaid because yt they which vsed ye trade of mercha~dise bought solde their commodities with such nations their neere neighbours as were of another religion
but when the aduerse party began to suppresse root out the reformed religion the it might be easily seene how it continually grew encreased
and yet neuertheles the cardinal of granuelle so hotly followed his busines as that he put the afore sayd bishops in possessio because be himselfe had the archbishoprick of malines for his share by vertue wherof he was legatus natus primate ouer al ye other bishops had ouer besides for a commendum the abbotship of affligam which was one of the richest in al the whole countrey hauing gotten also to himselfe of the abbayes that remayned certayne of the diuines to be his fauourites

and although co~trary to al hope expectation this new deuise was brought in into diuers cities yet might the enuy malice of many be easily seene knowen herein for diuers cities woulde at no ha~d receiue accept of these new bishops but opposed the selues against them to wit the antwerpians rurmondians goreningians deuentrians others howbeit by this doing

the cardinal of gra~uelle had obteined such authority fauor as yt he might giue away bestow al his offices benefices wher it pleased him insomuch yt he had gotte for his part to be lord king ouer al his other fellow bishops for by ye mean diuers deuises were practized to obtaine keepe ye authority superintendentship in his ma countries
and to ye end he might vndersta~d the state of al the whole doings there as also to get the loue and good wil of al the kings princes pote~tates neere about he had authority to make place al his ma commissaries other officers emo~gst the rest made his brother germaine ambassador in france who had woon there such fauour as that the king and the queene sent with al careful diligence to haue him sent back vnto their ma for the quiet of the common weale

and whosoeuer would co~sider throughly weigh ye things afore said might easily iudge who it was yt had vsurped chale~ged to himself power authority aboue his ma fro whe~ce haue proceeded al these troubles grifes
but al these things new deuises aforesaid bread such great sorow heauines in ye of oranges heart as yt he desired not once nortwise but many and sundry times to be discharged of his counsellership of estate of the lord treasorership of ye reuenewe of his highnes forfaitures of penall lawes desiring nothing so much as to haue these new deuises abolished
but whe ye said prince co~sidered vnderstood yt they sought by al meanes possible vtterly to bring in subiectio ye cou~trey of braba~t to yt end he might be no occasio to wtstand and gainsay ye same he carefully stood vpo it to be discharged of ye said offices dignities seeing it was neither hurtful either to his or yet to ye co~mo weale to ye end he might be at a more leysure to look to his own busines not be fou~d guilty of ye disorders wc he foresaw was like to come through ye strage new deuise
and for this cause he besought both his ma also the duchesse of parmathen lady regent to be discharged of his estate gouernme~t sith yt the gentleme co~federates had exhibited their supplicatio wherof ye aduersaries talked diuersly their pleasures
truly if the prince had been so ambitious as to haue taken to him selfe his ma authority it is most likely yt his highnes wold haue discharged him not expressely commanded him to continue in his estate for it is a moste iust law to discharge ambitious nobleme of their estates least in the end they wold go about to take

vpon them the possession of all the kinges countries make the theyr owne
and therefore this is cleane contrary to that that the atturney generall hath set downe for it is before sufficiently declared that the prince neither before nor yet after his highnesse departure was suspected to bee ambitious or meant to take vpon him his maiesties autoritie either yet make himself lord of braba~t seeing it is most euident yt the prince sought by al possible meanes to bee vnburdened of his estate
for all men may well vnderstand that will at least consider any thing of the matter that sithence his maiesties departure the cardinall of granuell hath had all power and authoritie and therefore it may truely both by many testemonies and examples bee verified that had great reason to seeke to bee discharged of mine estate dignitie howbeit cannot forget to speake one thing which is this that the dutches of parma hath confessed that sithence the departure of the said cardinall that she within a few monethes vnderstood more of the state and affayres of brabant then she did in all the tyme that the cardinall continued there

moreouer when as in the last troubles at bruxelles the dutthes was purposed to flie vnto mons in haynault and from thence towards the alpes to giue place vnto suche as desired to haue greater authoritie then she had the prince in the company of other noble men instantly besought her not to work such iniury to her selfe nor shame to his maiestie whereupon euidently truly appeareth that all the princes actions and purposes are far from all ambition for if the prince woulde haue taken vppon him the whole gouernment he could neuer haue had a better fitter occasio to haue brought it to passe the ye dutches departure howbeit he was of another mind therefore vsed all the meanes possible he could to stay her going preue~t ye disorderly dealing

and desides when councell was giuen to his maiestie that it would be very profitable for his cou~cel of estate to be increased with noble men and wealthie learned men for the preuenting of all dissention discord that all things might be better administred and chiefly because that the ordenances of the councell aforesaide might be obserued diligently executed to be short to ye end yt all occasions might be cut off from euery one for the mouing of co~trouersies according to euery ma~sfa~tafie or els to

hunt after and seeke theyr owne game of the goods of the common weale to the which end also the dutches of parma required the prince to set downe vnto her the names of meeke and worthie men for the same estate the said prince for the auoiding of all suspition in seeking after his own perticuler commodity referred the matter to his maiesties good pleasure which is a manifest token that hee neuer sought his owne particuler aduantage so that it must needes followe that it is very farre of that he is ambitious desirous of rule as he is accused seeing it is the propertie condition of all ambitious men ordinarily to to beare sway alone without companion or mate now his meaning was cleane contrary for his purpose was to haue moe councellors of the estate that many might be partakers of the same authoritie

and further he required said that he was minded to get him home to his owne house leaue his roome to some other as the dutches and diuers els of the councel of estate had thereof rendred good testimonie
it is therefore not necessary to lay open more certaine apparant occasions of these troubles namely when a man weigheth considereth how desirous the braba~ders are most earnestly to defend their priuileges which they so long haue mioyed by vertue of the mutuall contracts made betwixt their dukes and them and also to maintaine their priuileges which they haue obtained partly by those dukes partly by the emperours of old time graunted vnto them especially when they feared to haue been bereaued of them through ye great oppression and burden of strange people
but as the cardinal of granuell persisted continued in his imagination and opinion and that in his absence his adherents and complices proceeded on further in ye matter foorthwith all discord diffention began to reuiue so yt it could not be met withal by reason of ye dissention yt was betwene those of the councell of estate of ye priuie councel the treasurers of ye receipt of the reuenewes of the forfaitures of penall lawes who were so ouer ruled by ye cardinal the lords that tooke his part as that they could neuer agree together

and because that this and many other such like thinges bred and nourished great dissention wherfore to the end to meet wt all appara~t disorders mischiefes it was determined that ye count

of egmont should bee sent vnto his maiestie at whose returne euery man comforted himselfe with good hope and an expresse declaration of amendment and remedie of euery thing and especially for the moderation of the inquisition
and for the same purpose in the yeere
there assembled three bishops three diuines three doctors of the ciuill lawe and as many canonistes to conclude a moderation vpon the saide inquisition whereupon in the ende it was sent to his maiestie howbeit no whit agreed vnto neither yet published
ouer and besides this in the end of the same yeere his maiestie gaue expresse commandement that the new bishops should bee brought in without contradiction or els proclaime the decrees of the councell of trent giue vnto the inquisitors their authoritie and power by which they had both te~poral ecclesiastical knowledge authoritie yt the determination couclusion of the tridentine councel shold foorthwith be put in execution with all seueritie

the copies of this commandement were by and by sent vnto al the cities townes of the low countries expresly co~manding them to rule the~selues according to his maiesties commadement and commissions
this was the second cause and chief occasion of the alterations and disorders as hereafter shalbe shewed

seeing then that the inquisition principally was by his maiestie expresly co~manded it must of necessitie follow yt al the fault of the troubles and disorders passed is to be laid vpon himselfe vpon none els wherfore it neither agreeth with the truth nor yet any way like to be true yt through the exhortation of ye prince of orange the subiects should rebel against his hignes or that he first of all should by his perswasions draw them out of the way stir vp the greatest part of the nobilitie to confederate the~selues with him or to be mutinous and by an oth confirm their league to the end to oppose defend themselues at all times against his maiestie his ordinances which were from the first beginning obserued kept
and besides it is vnlike to be true yt this asse~bly and confederacie was made in his courts of breda bruxelles so accordingly to be the authour fautor chiefe of the obstinate mutinous rebels or disturber of the publike weale
for he neuer stirred vp sedition or dissention against his maiestie therefore ought not to be accused thereof for the saide conspiracie began

not by any exhorting of his but through the griefes proceeding from the inquisition and because that the promises and other incidents made in the yeere
as before hath been declared and shewed were not performed and kept
wherefore the prince of orange affirmeth that by the foresaide league and the accusations and other matters ensuing the selfe same thing came to passe which the dutches of parma heeretofore had spoken in open councell to wit that the declaration of the cruell commissions published by his matestie woulde cause a merueilous alteration seeing that many had conceiued som good hope of the good tidings that the count of egmont would bring with him at his returne out of spaine

and it is sithence also come to passe that it was written to the dutches as she herselfe hath confessed in her answere that the declaration of the commissions published by his maiestie was the cause of the whole alteration which commissions as before is said are the very spring head of the league made against his knowledge and will
but so soone as the same declaration was come to the handes of the said dutches and vnderstood the content thereof
dayes before the confederates had assembled themselues at the towne house she saide and expresly declared that the same declaration liked her not in al those points that she could not deuise howe the rigour of the commissions coulde by any meanes keepe the lowe countries in peace and
surely her highnes tooke not the meaning of the consederates to bee sedicious seeing shee vertly beleeued that the confederates woulde attempt nothing against his maiestie nor their countrie neither yet any thing that might be hurtful thereto so that this is a cleere case that these alterations troubles came first and principally from the inquisition
here are to be considered and weighed the examples of germanie fraunce england and scotland ho wheit it must needes bee graunted that his maiestie meant to shewe nothing els by the setting forth of these cruell commissions but in time vtterly to destroy ye countrie of brabant
and contrariwise in the countries where the religion or at least the libertie of conscience is graunted and agreed vpon where ye inquisition hath had nothing to do there is a peaceable and quiet abiding and dwellyng
which thing

witnesseth vnto vs that there is a greater difference to liue wt libertie of conscience without the inquisition then in all malice iniquitie and licenciousnes without correction and chastifeme~t neyther yet did it euer like ye princes potentates of germanie who euer desired the peace of theyr countries alwayes sought the publyque weale of them vnto whome the matter as greatly apperteineth as vnto his maiestie but to suffer the libertie of religion or conscience if at any time they feared commotions and rebellion

moreouer his maiestie might well enough vnderstande the meaning of the confederates seeyng they neuer shewed themselues obstinate or went about by force to obteine yt which they craued but only besought his matestie to vnderst and their grief and supplication thereupon take the aduise of the generall estates promising hereafter to liue in the cause of religion according to the ordenauce determination of ye said estates
and the if any man should be disobedient seditious or a disturber of the common weale yt he might be punished according to the qualitie of the offence
now the confederates desire nothing els but to haue their supplicatio heard or that the generall estates might be called assembled together and seeing that this busines had so fallen out in brabant that is was also necessary that a thing of so great importa~ce should be propounded to ye said estates who in all ages vpon such occasions according to the tenure of theyr priuileges were called together by the emperour charles the fift to determine conclude vpon the state of religion according to the ordenances which cleerely may be seen in the text graunted and published in the yeere of our lord


wherefore the confederates thought it lawefull for them to requyre and craue so much sith it hath been alwayes the custome in such sort to require such kind of things
as also in the bookes of the machabees we shall finde good and holy confederacies made for the aduauncing of the glory of god the welfare and health of the gouernors and magistrates and the prosperity of the common wealth of the countrie
likewise the prince of ora~ge thinketh that the confederacie of the nobilitie ought not to be take for sedition or rebellion against his maiesty forsomuch as co~cerning ye same ye co~federates haue toyntly promised to

and assist one the other against the same but yet vpon this condition that this conspiracie as before is sayd should end when as his maiestie had by experience found that the inquisition wold be enemie to all peace tranquilitie wherefore they also offred to desist leaue off theyr petition purpose yeelde vnto his maiestie alobedience be ruled by the determination ordena~ce of the generall estates

the dutches also was of this minde who had said before the arriuall of the confederates that she was of the opinion to moderate his maiesties determination as touching the inquisition yea she made a kynd of shewe in the kyngs name that she would exempt the countrie of brabant from the inquisition howbeit sithence her first commyng into these low countries vntill her departure hence she hath in very deed shewed the contrary
for shee tooke this confederacy and the exhibityng of the supplication for disobedtence and sedition although shee had notwithstanding heretofore dissembled the same both in word and deed
this her dissembling and hypocrisie the prince minded to shew not yt hee had beene the inuenter and furtherer of this confederacie which no way toucheth him but because he woulde hereeby declare that she iumped with his maiesties opinion who esteemed of the confederates as rebels traytours
but when as the dutches by his maiesties commandement by the aduise of all the councels had agreed to the supplication of the confederates yea so far as that she had promised vnder her owne hand and seale that the confederates should not bee holden guiltie nor yet accused by reason of this co~federacie nor of what soeuer followed thereon it followeth that neither his maiestie nor yet the dutches had iust occasion to distrust the confederates neyther say that the dutches had done it for any other purpose to appease those that had vndutifully behaued themselues and cast downe the images which was altogether done against his will and pleasure
neuerthelesse a man might say that his maiesties meaning and the dutches were diuerse although they agreed and were all one
for the intent of eyther of both was none other but to winne the friendship and good will of the confederates whereby the welfare of his maiestie as they thoughte shoulde bee more aduaunced then hyndred

for the declaration of his maiestie and of the dutchesse hath been so at large set downe as that it is enough to excuse and purge them of the accusation wherewith they were charged wherefore it is to be considered that neyther his maiestie nor yet the dutchesse do take the confederates to bee seditious thus a man may easily weigh how variable and inconstant the hearts and thoughtes of kings and princes are
moreouer the king had written with his owne hande to the same intent and purpose in the moneth of august to wit after and before that the sayd confederacie and supplication were made that his maiestie greatly liked of the prince of oranges seruices neyther did hee make any account of that that had passed and that the prince shoulde not leaue off for any other reasons to bee perswaded touching his fidelitie but that his maiestie wholly trusted him and woulde not beleeue any reasons that shoulde tende to his hurt of whome hee wrote that they had been too blame and done very ill
thus by the reasons aboue sayde may easily bee perceiued that there is no likelihoode why the sayde prince shoulde bee called the chiefe inuentor and fautor of those that were rebelles seeing it could not be founde that he had stirred vp maynteyned and defended the sayde confederates neither was any man able to say that euer he protected any of the confederats or others and therfore why should he be ther of accused furthermore he is charged yt some of ye confederates put the selues in armes and stood at defense in diuers places without regarde of any thing what so euer which matter toucheth no whitte the sayde prince and therefore not bounde to answere it neyther yet to excuse himself for other mens faultes and offences and agayne hee is not to be charged in that that some of the confederates became after rebelles and traytors seeing that what so euer ensued thereof was done not onely without his commaundement but also to his great sorrowe and griefe
yea and that which is more all these thinges were committed in his absence and for that cause leuied hee men of warre for his owne defence although his aduersaries say to the contrarie and that this was done by reason that hee woulde take al his maiesties authoritie to him selfe considering that he had at that tyme in his handes both cities and castles

howebeit the prince had none other meaning but according to the dutchesse commaundement reduce the sayde countreys especially holland zeland and vtryght of which he was goueruour to peace and quiernesse and them to conserue vnder his maiesties obedience and fidelitie doing all duetie for the saythfull administring of his estate and office
whereof the presidentes counselles estates officers and magistrates of the sayde countreys and cities can beare him good witnesse and that he was no whit partiall but admonished eyther partie to bee obedient and faithfull vnto his maiestie as hee also so did in many other places where he had any dominion
which thing may manifestly bee seene by that that the prince by the grace of god hath there resisted and letted that in all these troubles and seditions no citie or towne belonging to his maiestie hath been endomaged taken or withdrawne either from his or the dutchesse obedience

and for confutation and ouerthrowe of the count hooghstrate his inditement and the accusation of his ambition and for the holding of an assemblie in his castle of hooghstrate or the conspiring with the countes of egmont and horne at deuremond likwise his conspiracie with the prince of orange in ioyntly ioyning together in armes against his maiestie and the stopping with all their power and might the enteraunce of his armie into brabant the prince protesteth and referreth himselfe ouer to the testimonies of the lordes that then were asse~bled at hoogstrate who can report whither any other matters were there treated of then visiting of one another and to be merry together in meeting of certain noble me strangers their good friends kinsmen neither shall it euer be prooued that any thing in that place was determined concluded vpon that might any way turn to his hurt
and again they shall neuer be able truly proue that he had been at any assembly either at deuremond or in any other place about the consulting conspiring for the stopping of his arriuall into brabant
but he right well vnderstandeth that all these actions haue sinisterly bin enterpreted vnto his wc hath greatly empayred his highnes louing affertion to wards him for he had gotten ye copy of a letter written by

francis of alana his ambassador in france to ye dutchesse that whe time place serued the countes of egmond horne and the of orange shoulde be punished as they had deserued but that in the meane while they should be gently and louingly intreated and in the said letter was also conteyned that the troubles and commotions in brabant were imputed to them

thus here we see the principall cause of their assembly at deuremond but these noble men doe trust and sticke to their innocency concluding none otherwise but to propounde to the dutchesse the contente of this letter and to keepe them selues safe from it
and that which might be herein more talked of hee trusted that the lordes which were then in prison had more at large declared the same
and as concerning the rest of the articles of the inditement to wit that the prince had counselled the of brederode to fortifie and fense his castle of viane against his that is a very lie and against all truth but this is true in deede that about certain yeeres past the prince himselfe being at vyane the of brederode said vnto him that the his father had appoynted him as it were by will to make vp the ditches and rampares of vyane already begun whereupon he answered that for the accomplishing of his fathers will he would doe it but there was not a word spoken of the king neither had he once the heart to attempt any thing against him
and as touching the aduice of fortification the nobilitie were in all times at their free choise and livertie to fortifie their mannors when it pleased the
moreouer viane with all the iurisdiction thereunto belonging properly to the of brederode and although his ancesters haue bin in sute for it yet hath the of brederode continued stil in peaceable possession
wherfore there can be no matter of treason concluded vpon in this behalfe for that talke which they had together was nothing els but about the fortifiyng of the sayd town but no mention was made of his maiesties affayres and this conference was long before the time of these troubles

as touching the other point that the prince suffered the lorde of brederode to leuie men of warre at his pleasure in the citie of antwerpe and sent secretly to vyane certayne munition against the dutchesses countermaund the answereth

that hee came to antwerpe to deliuer the citie from those suddayne troubles and when hee vnderstoode the case he aduertised the margraue thereof who neuer founde out any thinge of the matter but onely suche as were sytting at a table hauing commission to leuie men howbeit they secretly got themselues away

true it is that the prince offered vnto the lorde of brederode certayne peeces of artillery that were made at vtright howebeit this was long before these troubles and at that time it was about his maiesties seruice so that hee coulde not refuse them seeing that vyane was not farre from vtryght and beesides hee had also required and demaunded them
and as concerning those pointes that the prince should forbid the receiuing of his maiesties garnisonnes into certayne places and townes especially in zelande where hee him selfe had sent men of warre to take vp the place and stoppe his maiesties enteraunce by sea as for the garnysonnes the prince saith that he neuer had it once in his thought to forbidde them and if in case it be true they ought to tell when and at what time and in what place this geare was wrought
notwithstanding when he was in zealand he was aduertised that there was a practise to take zealande if it were possible which was a matter of great importaunce and therefore hee commaunded the lorde of boxtell that no garnison shoulde be receiued without his leaue for that is the maner of all lieutenaunts

but when hee was afterwarde aduertised by the captayne of the rammekins which was vnder his charge that two hundred of the dutchesses souldiers were there arriued requiring to haue the castle opened vnto them which the captayne denied howebeit hee was afearde of some muteny and sedition by reason his people were vnpaide and the castle but hardly bestead with victualles hee commaunded him that no man shoulde entre into the castle without the dutchesses commaundement and his leaue whereof the dutchesse being aduertised was well pleased and sent them their pay although the dutchesse had been before otherwise informed whiles shee lay at bruxelles and he in antwerpe and if the saide souldiers had

entred the castle he must haue answeared it
moreouer ye antwerpians desired yt they might haue no garnisons thrust into their citie promising to be alwayes obedient vnto his ma and neither spare body nor goods to doe him seruice no not once to hinder him in these affayres
it is very true that certeine small vessels were laden with souldiers to come to antwerpe who for the common quiet of the city could not bee suffered to enter wherefore they sayled towardes zeland where they were forbidden stayed for comming on land insomuch that they inforced through famine to returne to antwerpe and as it is sayde that as they were in ye of brederode his seruice being about a mile from antwerpe to wit at easterwell and comming on lande were there discomfited
when the reformed churches of antwerpe heard of this they armed themselues to help the said souldiers which caused a great alarme within the citie so that the prince in the ende appeased the same without the effusion of any citizens blood
by which bee gaue them to vnderstand that he neuer pretended to atte~pt any thing in zealand which might any way tend to the hinderance of any of his maiesties deuises practises

but in that he would not receiue garnisons into the country and townes he did that for the auoiding of all dissention and to keepe the subiects in peace vnttie
wherfore the prince greatly marueileth that such great learned men as would be so well thought of would set downe and propound such matters as neuer can nor shalbe any way verified
there is besides in the articles of this inditement declared that the prince was sent to antwerpe to appease the troubles but that he suffered the exercise of all hereticall sectes indifferently

whereunto he answereth that hee expressely tolde the counsell that it was impossible for him to stay those of the religion notwithstanding that he woulde be as carefull to do what so euer lay in him to be done as a man mought be insomuch that all the townsmen gaue him great thankes for the appeasing of the troubles through his aduise and counsell
the magistrate of the citie and not he suffered the building of the churches and the exercise of the religion for the aueyding of a

greater offence and mischiefe

the consistories were ordeyned before he came thither yea euen before the publique preachings and to meete from thenceforth with al troubles he permitted them a way or meane whereby all the circumstaunces of the affayres that might suddenly happen might be talked vpon and dealt withall and did not belieue that his maiestie by this occasion coulde any way be endemnified seeing it serued more for the keeping of his subiects in peace and tranquilitie
for the last article where it is sayde that hee shoulde ordeyne impositions and exactions or leuie money for the paying of souldiers hee fayeth that he neyther ordeyned impositions nor yet leuied mouey but that that whiche was therein done had beene done before hee came there for the maintenaunce of the poore and of the ministers and for the building of their churches wherefore it is very apparant and probable that this money was not employed about his profit
hereby also may very well be perceyued that his meaning was not to impose any exactions when as hee refused fiftie thousand florines which were franckly offered him for the good seruice which hee had done
it was impossible to stoppe suche a thing in suche a citie of marchandize as antwerpe seeing that there is dayly greate summes of money disbursed and layde out for diuers and sundry thinges
wherefore by these reasons aforesayde is sufficiently set downe that he was not the author of the troubles
these woordes and speeches may suffice for the excuse and defence of the prince of orange with the which also accordeth the excuse and defence of the of hooghstrate sauing that he hath answered as thou hast hearde vpon other pointes and articles as before hath been declared

hitherto haue wee orderly set downe and declared in what sort the duke of alua arriued in the lowe countreys with his men of warre and of his whole proceedinges therein and likewise howe the prince of orange withdrew himselfe and procured all men to prepare for souldiers both on horsebacke and on to ye end to withstand the fury of the blooddy tyrant the of alua who for ye defence against ye inuasion of his enemies put

him selfe in armes and prouided men of warre not onely within the countrey but also without because he greatly presumed that the banished lords and the rest that were fledde woulde giue an attempt to returne into their possessions and enheritances so that all his care was how he might be able to hurte the enimy

and as the duke of alua had made all the prouision yt might be for the warres to come he caused all the goods debtes titles and actions of the fugitiues and banished men to be confisked hauing made commissioners for the very purpose who were bound to aunsweare to the hands of the ordinary iudge to delyuer the money into the treasurer of the warres possession for the paying of the souldiers and horsemen which were to be vsed about those warres which was the way to hurt his enemie and to spare his maiesties purse
ouer and besides hee imposed great exactions tollages and leuied wonderfull summes of money vpon his matesties credite for the paying of ye garnisons the building of castles for the fortifying of the fronter border townes of the countrie and to haue continuall store of money for all occurrants whatsoeuer
on the other side the prince of orange beeyng dryuen out of these countries and spoyled of his goods not meanyng to do as the rest of the counties had done knew none other better way then to excuse himselfe towards his king and prince implored and pitifully besought the aide of other potentates to bee his intercessours in that behalfe
and although the emperour him selfe had done therein as muche as hee coulde yet woulde not the king once listen to him nor yet vnderstande the matter but put ouer the prince vnto the duke of alua to bee ordered by him which thing he thought woulde neither bee good nor profitable for him and therefore was of necessitie driuen to enter into armes with the ayde of his kinsfolkes friendes and fauourers as well germaines as the lowe countrey men

moreouer all such as tooke part with him and as yet remayned vnder the yoke of the spaniardes furnished him with all the money they were able to make because they hoped thereby to recouer their lost libertie
now when the prince

was thus prouided he by his brother count lodwickes helpe procured an armie of footemen and horsemen and for the better furthering of the cause the prince wrote to all the princes and lordes complayning him selfe vnto them of the tyrannie and extreeme wrong of the duke of alua that hee had spoyled him of his goodes hereaued him of his manners landes and tenementes and contray to all right and equitie had taken away the count of buren his sonne and sent him ouer into spaine

the princes of germanie were greatly displeased that the lowe countreys shoulde thus bee oppressed by a tyrannous spaniarde and straunger and therefore they assembled them selues together to consulte and deuise whiche way was best for them to helpe the prince of orange
the may following there was mustering of souldiers in euery place but when the duke of alua hearde of it he tooke order for the matter and gotte him into the playne fielde insomuch that they which had first assembled them selues beyonde the maze and afterwarde about dalham which is a little towne in the countrey of iuilliers whose chiefe captayn was the lorde of hooghstrate were by the duke of alua his people discomfited and a thousande souldiers flayne not regarding that they had committed that fact within the lande and iurisdiction of the empyre howebeit it is the naturall condition and propertie of spaniards and italians to bee alwayes too proude and thinke them selues better then all other nations for it so fell out euen at that present as that the gouernour of hinisverge and his lieutenant who were come to dalham to admonishe and summon the fugitiues and banished men to depart out of the borders of the duke of iuillers his lorde and master were there murdered and slayne as if they had been enemies

notwithstanding all this they which escaped and remayned were no whitte the more discouraged thereby but inuaded his maiesties lowe countreys with duke lodwicke and for the of the people agaynshe spaniardes they were very well appoynted and fortified and of all handes bestirred them entending to goe on with these warres for the exercise of religion the defence of the priuiledges of the lowe countreys

and for the restoring of the banished men and fugitiues into their ancient possession and inheritaunce whiche was the cause that some of them bare in their ensignes this deuise or posie recuperare aut mori that is to say wee will eyther recouer our losse or els lose our liues

wherefore many of the people assembled them selues in all quarters in so muche that count lodwycke finding him selfe well strengthened tooke many townes and places the first of which was the castle of wedde and after that the damme in the countrey of groening
nowe when the duke of alua hearde of this hee waxed starke madde and doubting that his iolly felicitie might turne to to great miserie hee woulde in no wise giue count lodwicke any time to in that place but sent thether sardigne his regiment or tertio with the maister of his campe and three ensignes of the regiment or tertio of lombardes and foure hundreth spanishe and italian horse and the count megue with a iolly company of souldiers
and ouer and besides fiue companies of the regiment of the count of arenbergue
howebeit all these people could doe counte lodwicke no hurte because his armie dayly encreased
the duke of alua sent thither sir iohn of ligny count arenbergue who was newely come out of fraunce with a regiment of spaniardes and fiue ensignes of almaynes to set vpon the enemie whiche hee did in deede but to his great losse before the count megue was come
the first skyrmishe was very brauely handled in a place where a thousande shot of the count nasious lay in wayte for the comming of the count arenbergue howebeit the night separated them and the spaniardes retyred vnto their campe but the count nassou in the night raysed his campe
when the day was come the spaniardes thought that the count nassou and his people had fled and therefore they followed them
but when count lodwicke vnderstoode that there were no more horsemen but curtius martinengo his bande hee charged the count arenbergue with three hundred horses and ouerthrewe tenne ensignes of spantardes and fiue companies of almaynes

the count of arenbergue for the sauing of his honour defended him selfe valiantly howebeit his horse was slayne vnder him and he falling to the grounde was suddenly surprised by a shotte and slayne

notwithstanding that hee cryed out and sayde saue my life for am a count but all woulde not serue and so his noble blood was there splite
certayne of the spaniardes fledde vnto a monastery not farre from the place where the ouerthrowe was giuen called heiligher lee to hide and saue them selues howebeit they were forthwith sette vpon where at the very first assault was slayn count
adolfe of nassou

count lodwicke his brother and his chauncelor the rest of the spaniardes and almaynes saued them selues in the town of groening
by this ouerthrowe the duke of alua lost sixe peeces of great ordinaunce with all their munition but chiefly the count of arenbergue who was all his comfort

ouer and besides the great store of money which they had brought with them for the paying of their souldiers their plate and other ritches which the nassouans made good butin of
this battell was fought the
of may
betweene heiligher lee and winschote in friselande the count of arenbergue was buried in the church of the saide monasterie and the count adolfe at welden
the
of may the duke of alua caused a proclamation to bee placlaymed at bruxelles that all such as were departed their countrey shoulde returne to their place of aboade vppon payne of confiscation both of body and goodes
the welthie fugitiues were expressely named howebeit fewe or none returned because they hoped of a better way and a more conuenient time to do it
this discomfiture greatly greeued the duke of alua but hee was auenged for it vpon the noble men and gentlemen and other welthie citizens whome he had in prison whose liues he tooke away

for the first day of iune he caused eighteene gentlemens heads to be striken off in the horsemarket at bruxelles

to wit gysbert and thierry of batenbourgh barons peter de andelot philip de winglen maximilian cocke philip triest a gantois

iohn de blays bortholomew de val sir beyma a gentleman of friseland and harman galama a gentleman of friselande also iames de pentan ferdinand peletier constantine of bruxelles iohn de rumaul lewis carlier of cambray peter and philip de altz brethren

the next day beeing the seconde of iune were put to death the lorde of vilers and the lorde of due who were taken at the ouerthrowe of dalham quintin benit and a minister of the worde named cornille nyeen a very learned and famous doctor vpon all these persons aforesayde vomited he vp his cholor
the thirde of the saide moneth hee caused to bee brought foorth the count egmond and philippe de memorencie count of horne knights of the order two very famous gentleme both for their language and honour as also for their notable feaces of armes especially the count egmonde for the good seruice which he had done his maiestie in the viage to saint quintins where the constable and many other frenche noble men were taken and afterwarde in the voiage to groening where hee valiantly ouercame the frenche to their great losse both of men and otherwayes
howebeit all these his notable good and faithfull seruices stoode him in no stead
these two countes were brought from gand to bruxelles in a wagon with a conuoye of tenne ensignes of spaniardes and a bande of horses and ledde to the markette place of bruxelles and lodged at an house called the breadhouse about three of the clocke in the after noone and there were indited and sentence pronounced as followeth

the duke of alua his highnesse marques of coria gouernour lieutenant and captayne generall for his maiestie our redoubted and beloued lorde in his lowe countreys and lorde chiefe iustice in the counsayle of life and death ouer his maiesties prisonners hauing seene the attorney generall his declaration and information and also the mynutes documentes depositions and letters by him exhibited but especially the confession and propositions of the prisonners their answeres and defence and the billes by them exhibited by which the that are

pages missing

but nowe to returne to my first matters whiche was in hande withall

when the count of egmond hearde of this seuere sentence hee saide truely this is an harde iudgement do not beleeue that euer in all my life haue so offended his maiestie as to haue deserued so seuere sentence neuerthelesse if so be that haue offended beseeche the lorde that my death may take away all my sinnes to the ende that neyther nor none of mine be any more dishonored and that my deare wife and feare and my innocent children suffer no more torment after that my bodie and goods shall bee confisked my good seruices haue deserued not to haue any such grace granted vnto me but sith it is ye pleasure of almightie god and my lord the king that thus it shalbe wil patiently suffer death
and afterwarde he wrote vnto the king this letter

the count egmonde his letter to the king
haue hearde the decree of your maiesties sentence giuen vpon mee although neuer eyther ment or thought to commit any thing yt might be hurtfull vnto your person seruice or the ancient catholike religion but take in good parte what so euer it shall please the lorde to lay vpon mee and if haue during these troubles in the lowe countreys any way offended or suffered any thing that might haue happened to others and not to my selfe the same hath come from a loyall and faithfull heart to the honour of god your maiesties seruice and as the time required
wherefore most humbly beseeche your maiestie that if it so bee that haue any way offended you to pardon and forgiue me and haue pittie on my deare wife my innocent children and my poore seruauntes commending my selfe for the present to the mercie of god

giuen at bruxelles the
of iune

subsigned
prepared to die amurathes de egmond

when the count of egmond had written and sealed vp this letter hee deliuered it to the byshoppe of ypre beseeching him that hee woulde sende it to his maiestie which the byshop

promised vpon his fayth to doe and so performed it

the count of hornes woulde not from the beginning be shriuen by the bishop saying haue made my confession vnto god neuerthelesse at the great entreatie of the byshop hee in the ende was shriuen of him
upon whitson eue in the morning the count egmond boldely called vpon them that he might finishe his dayes seeing it was neyther good nor profitable for a condemned man to remayne long tyme in suspense in the tormente and anguishe of death
and about noone the count egmond was brought vnto the great market place accompanied with the byshop of ypre and other church men after them followed the maister of the campe to the spaniardes and captayne salines with nyenteene ensignes of spaniardes who marched on in order of battayle very well appointed for the staying of all disorders and troubles or for defence if any of the citizens shoulde haply make any stirre by reason of the sayde count
the count was not bounde nor manacled neyther yet guarded nor helde by any of the seriauntes for he had promised in the fayth of a knight that he woulde goe quietly to the place of execetion
in the market place was a scaffoulde set vp couered all ouer with black cloth and aboue vpon it two blacke cushins and two long yron poles
below the scaffolde was the knight marshall carrying a red wande in his hande and the hangman vpon the scaffolde
the count aforesayde went vp with the byshoppe and kneeling vpon a cushin after he had a while talked with the byshoppe the hangman according to the maner besought him of pardon and the bishoppe withdrawing him beehinde the count the count after he had cast off his nyght gown of redde damaske and his veluet cloake layde on with parchement lace of golde and his blacke cappe garnished with white feathers couered his owne face with a coyffe which he ware vnder his cappe
then hee ioyning his handes together and kissing the crosse recommended him selfe to the mercie of god looking for death
the bodie was forth with put into a coffen and the place stayned with his blood was couered with a blacke cloth

when this was done the count horne was brought foorth who besought god to forgiue him his sinnes and wished all blessed felicitie to al the standers by taking his leaue of them and pulling a wimple ouer his eyes after hee had layde downe his veluet cloake was executed as the other count was
when this execution was accomplished the spaniardes retyred from the market place sauing two ensignes that kept the heades which were set vpon the two iron poles which were taken away about three of the clocke in the after noone and laide with their bodies
nowe egmonds bodie was caried to saint clares abbay and hornes to the cathedrall church and buried amongst their predecessors tombes
the count egmonde his seruauntes had according to the custome nayled vp his armes at his court gate but the duke of alua caused them to bee taken downe immediatly
all the worlde greatly complayned the death of the sayde count and merueiloufly mourned for him
these two countes from the beginning tooke exceptions to iohn du boyes attourney generall as an vnlawfull iudge and therein continued for they being knightes of the order coulde not be condemned nor iudged but by the knyghtes of the same order neuerthelesse the duke of alua hauing thereto no regarde proceeded on caused the sayde sentence to be pronounced

many great men in auethoritie and learned and infinite number of others were marueylously abashed at this cruell sentence and execution pronounced and executed against the lawes and priuileges not onely of knightes of the order but also agaynst all the whole lowe countreys yea against all ciuile and common lawe seeing that the count egmond his araignement had not the full and ryght course of the lawe in such a case prouided neuerthelesse they whiche nowe had the copye of the resolution of the inquisition of spayne giuen by information which was taken by the inquisitours here aboutes and sent ouer into spaine which resolution was graunted in the citie of madrid the sixt of februarie
and besides the sentence that his maiestie pronounced in the sayde citie the

of the said moneth ensuyng may cleerely perceiue from whence this tyrannie and iniustice had theyr first beginning and no whit maruell at all the tyrannie which the said duke of alua committed but a great deale the rather maruell that there should or coulde bee yet euen at this present suche a number of men in the lowe countries so fauouring the spaniards as that they will put in aduenture theyr bodies and goods for defence of theyr quarrell bryng them in yet once again to haue the gouernement of the lowe countries seeing that not one of them more then any of the rest shall be exempted from their tyranny as may manifestly appeare by the said resolution and sentence the tenure wherof ensueth

a resolution of the office against the people of the lowe countries

the office of the most holy and sacred inquisition requireth in the presence of his royall maiestie to speak and resolutely set downe somewhat of the abhominable offence of apostasie and heresie committed by his maiesties subiects in the low countries after it had seene and diligently considered as well of his maiesties information on those thinges as also vppon the viewe of the letters mynutes autentique docume~ts or instructions worthie the credit annexed to the said information by the officers of the sacred holy inquisition faithfully sent ouer from the low countries saith and fully resolueth vpo that which toucheth the diuine and holy profession and conscience that all and euery subiect of the said lowe countries and the whole corporation and body of them except onely such as are seuerally noted in the information as wel in regard of such as are publique and manifest apostates heretikes and backeslyders from god our mother holy churche and commandement of the catholike king and his obedience as also in respect of the rest of the counterfet catholikes haue not done theyr duetie wherein both towards god and his maiestie in respect of the catholike religion and the oth which they haue made they are and ought to bee bounde to haue withstood with all their power myghte all open and manifest apostates heretikes and rebels and haue

suppresse their wicked and cursed faction which at the first beginning of the troubles they might easily haue done but contrariwise they forbore so godly and holy a resistance therefore are worthie to be iudged to bee partakers and fauourers of open and manifest apostates heretikes and rebels
certaine also of the nobilitie and in the name of exhibyting bylles of complainte and supplications against the most holy inquisition haue crafcily enflamed and encouraged the heretikes apostates and rebels and therefore haue all offended in the highest degree of treason

and thus it is saide and fully determined vpon in the citie of madrid the sixteenth of februarie


when his royall maiestie had seene the information drawe and by his commaundement receiued vpon the cursed offence of apostasies heresies and rebellions committed by his subiects of the lowe countries and had likewyse seene the mynutes and autentique instructions worthie credite annexed vnto the saide information and faithfully sent ouer by the officers of the sacred and holy inquisition of the lowe countries and had besides seene the holy aduise of the office of the sacred holy inquisition with the wise reasons which were there thrust in concerning the administration of lawe and iustice thereby for that purpose to vse his kingly and absolute power and might

sayeth and decreeth that all and euery subiect of the sayde lowe countries and all bodies corporate and polytike of the same those onely excepted whiche in the sayde information are noted whose names wee will in tyme and place commaunde to bee put into our treasurie courte of our lowe conntries as well for theyr publique and manifest apostasie heresie and fallyng away from god our mother holye churche and hys catholike commandement and obedience as also in respect of the vnduetyfull dealing of those counterfaite catholikes whiche were amongest them wherein notwithstanding both towardes god and his maiestie in regarde of the catholike religion and their othe they are and were bound to haue resisted all publique and manifest apostates heretikes and rebels

with all theyr mayne power and force and suppressed theyr wickednesse which at the first beginning of the troubles and commotions they myght with ease lawfully haue done but they heerein contrariwise did vtterly forbeare this so holy a resistance and suppression and greatly reioyced therein and therefore are of right to bee iudged the fauourers and procurers of the saide publike and manifest apostates heretikes and rebels

they also who vnder the name of the nobilitie and subiects hauing exhibited supplications and billes of complaint against the most holy inquisition and hauing therby vnder the pretence of godlines inflamed and incouraged the heartes and mindes of apostates heretikes and rebels haue committed the deteftable offence of treason and therefore to bee all condemned without respect eyther of sexe or age in such paynes and punishment as the lawe hath ordeined against backslyders
wherefore his maiestie willeth and commaundeth who by so seuere sentence pretendeth to shewe some feareful example for the terrifying of all posteritie hereafter to come that the paines and punishme~ts of this seuere sentence shall without any hope of fauour grace farbearing or winkyng at take full force and effect but yet in suche order and maner as shall in time and place bee reuealed and manifested in thee of our lowe countries

and thus is it determined and iudged in the citie of madrid the
of february


let vs now come againe to our first matter

after that the count lodwike of nassau had gotten the victorie against the spaniardes hee diuided his souldiers into two companies and besieged the towne of groening on both sides not without the great wo~der of the whole world in that he durst without munition take vpon him to set vpon such a towne so strongly fortified with walles and rampares and so well victualed

the counte megue was in the saide towne with eyghte ensignes of almaynes and a thousande spaniardes and curtins martinengo with three hundred horse

the townes men oftentimes sallied out and skirmished

but chiefly the
of iune when as the bestegeants were gotten into certaine of the ditches to trench
the horsemen were very forwarde when as the nassouans were busie to hynder the buildyng of the fort or trench and made liuely skirmishes so yt of the nassouans were slaine about two hundreth and so were in lyke sort a good many of spaniardes
captaine martinengo also was in great perill of loosing his life by reason that his horse was gotten into a quackmyre
there was likewise one of the gueses taken who as himselfe confessed meant to set on fire diuers places of the town to the end that when the citizens haue beene busied about the quenching of the fire the nassouans might the better haue scaled and wonne the towne
whiche guese was hanged by the appointmente of captaine albanezo

during these exploites chiapin vitelli had assembled as many men as he possibly could and whiles the duke of alua was preparing of his things he erected also his campe before the said towne of groening for the defence thereof and the dryuyng away of the nassouans but it was all in vaine
there were then many skirmishes many stratagemes and warrelike pollicies
counte lodwike at one tyme offered captaine vitelli the battaile but he would none of it saying that he had not as yet any opportunitie because he still attended the duke of alua his co~ming with his armie
the emperour at the duke of alua his request sent to count lodwike and commanded him vpon paine of banishing the empyre to rayse his campe from before the towne and to get him out of the countrie with as litle hurt doing as was possible

count lodwike sent him worde againe

that hee could not doe it before such time as he had aduertised the prince of orange and the rest of the princes and potentates his confederates thereof and that then hee woulde make hym a short answere
notwithstanding many of the noble men of the empyre were afraide of this message and thereupon returned home into theyr owne countries

howbeit this siege of groening continued vntyll the commyng of the duke of alua who whiles hee was making of

prepartion executed at bruxelles many prisoners as hath beene before saide and in the moneth of iuly marched towardes boisleduke with seuenteene ensignes of footemen and certain great ordenance which came from malynes so that hee encamped himselfe before groening the fourteenth of the sayde moneth

when count lodwike hearde of this hee raysed his campe and retyred towardes embden making hauocke of all thinges in his passage breaking downe of bridges

and marryng the high wayes for the staying and backe keeping of the enenue but not without continuall skirmishing
the duke of alua had sent duke erycke with his horsemen to groening because the territory about the towne was moyst and soft so that the horse men coulde not passe it and hee himselfe with his foote men pursued count lodwike hauing espials euery where to aduertise him out of what quarter of the countrie counte lodwike meant to goe

at last the duke was aduertised that counte lodwike stayed at iemming in the count of embden his dominions and had there pitched his campe beeing a fit place for intrenching consideryng that on the one side hee had water enough and on the other he had the iolly citie of embden to furnish his campe with victuals and all other necessary prouision

when the duke of alua was heereof throughly aduertised hee caused his army to marche towardes counte nassou his campe and sent before him captaine sancho de auila and captaine mentero to holde them play and apply them with skirmishes thereby to withdrawe the nassouans from the commodious place wherein they were
and after him he sent iulian romero master of the campe with fiue hundred harquebuziers three hundred musketiers
after him followed don sanches de lodogno with a thousande harquebuziers appointed for ye two wings of ye foote men and caesar gonzage martinengo with two bands of horse men the rest of the vauntguard were vnder the conduct of alfonse de vlloa and don consaluo de bracamont with express commandement that none of those souldiers should otherwise be placed
in the reareward were specially appointed sixe ensignes of almaines and after them fifteene ensignes

signes of wallons who followed the light horse one by one for the passage was very straight and full of water on eyther side

when the nassouans sawe the mightie armie of the duke of alua in steed of shewing themselues valiant and couragious they beganne to crie out money money and woulde not once fight shewing themselues to be neyther of valure nor yet wise and they who shoulde not haue fought for money but for the defence of religion durst not nowe once put in hazard their liues eyther for theyr countrie or yet for religion
whiche thinge when the duke of alua sawe and consideryng of theyr pusylanimitie or faint heartednesse set vpon count nassou his campe about ten of the clocke in the morning and so put them to flight and in killyng of a certaine number he paid them the wages which count lodwike ought them
howbeit many of them were saued in passing the ryuer of embden by boate and especially the most valiant count lodwike and some of the noble men escaped the tyrants handes notwithstanding that hee stood to his defence euen to the last man for when he saw that his souldiers woulde not fight hee saued himself with great peryll of his life by passing ye riuer in a very small boat
the count of hoogstrate was but two dayes before gone from the campe and count iuste of scouwenbourgh saued himselfe and the greater number of his horsemen at the begynning of the battaile when he perceiued the souldiers would not fight but called still for money

when the duke of alua had gotten this victorie

he wrote the particularities of this battaile vnto iohn bishop of munster who was the chiefe within the compasse of westphalia by whiche letter the sayd duke co~plained of the wrong which counte lodwike had done that he woulde haue no peace and contemned the emperours message and excused himselfe of that that hee had burdened and endamaged the count embden by the entring of souldiers laying all the blame on ye count embden who had holpen count lodwike with victuals and shewed him selfe in very deede the king of spaines enemie seeing hee had duryng the tyme of the battaile discharged vppon the spaniardes certayne great ordenance out of the shippes

after this great victorie the duke of alua tooke his way by amstelredame towardes vtright where hee cut off the head of one of duke lodwikes captaines whom hee had taken prysoner

the twentie of iuly the prince of orange by an apologie and certaine publique writings declared the occasion cause

and necessitie which inforced his excellencie his friendes and the confedered noble men to take armes against the duke of alua and his adherentes to wit by reason of his horrible and detestable tyranny and persecution against the poore and blameles professours of the worde of god and of the holy gospell and also against the generall estates of the lowe countries to theyr vtter rooting out and desolation but because the saide apologie hathe oftentimes beene printed and thereby gotten into the handes of all the worlde wee haue not here for breuitie sake put it in

wee haue heeretofore saide howe that the prince of orange had waged a great many both foote men and horsemen who being arriued about ye monasterie of romerstorf in ye countrie of treues remained there vnto the ende of the moneth to the great burt of the countrie men
the captaines of the horsemen were fredericke de rolhuisen marshall of hessen who was a famous man in ye french wars
thierry of schonbrough count iust of schuwenbourgh count albert of nassau counte burchart of barby ottho of malsbrough herman riedesal and adam welles
the colonels of the foot men were nicholas of harstadt a man of an auncient and noble house an expert man of war and for his valure very famous feyt schooner and balthazar of woluen
the french captaines were moruillier the baron of renty mouy antrycourt esternay the parson and others of twelue bands of horse and a thousande harquebuziers
captayne poyet was also a captaine of souldiers
with these also ioyned counte lodwike after his discomfiture at lemmingen

in the beginning of september the prince caused ye campe to marche on after that they had made a generall muster and passed the rhine at saint vit a towne within his iurisdiction

the princes armie was ensignes of almaynes

foure thousande french and wallons the most of them shot and
thousand horse men well armed som of the foot men had in theyr ensignes this posie pro lege grege rege that is to say for the lawe the people and the king
some beare the pellican by reason of the loue shee beareth to her young ones nourishyng them with the blood which issueth out of her hurt brest
vpon theyr morions were roses painted an olde englishe deuise as if the queene of england had assisted them
ouer and besides the prince had ten peeces of ordenance sixe faucons and four canons but small prouision of munition and this was in haruest a very moyst and raynie season and therefore very vnfit to marche with so great an armie

when the duke of alua had heard these newes at vtright he mustered his people
the colonel of the alamaines were the count lodyon and count phillip of ouerstein
ouer and besides hee had fortie ensignes of spaniardes and fortie ensignes of vvallous sauing those that lay in garnison in the townes castles who for ye more part were spaniards who he most trusted
hee had also foure thousande horse of spaniards italians almaynes burgonions and others
with this armie hee encamped before mastright to stay the enemie for passing ouer at the maze hee made also a bridge ouer the maze that he myght euery way cut the enemie from victuals

the prince of orange tooke by assault arenberg

and ep pen two townes standing betweene coloigne and duren and hormeson also belonging to king philip where his ma garnison was staine which caused the duke of alua to spare none eyther yet to receiue any to mercie
but as the prince marched still for ward the duke knew not whether he wold into france to ayde the prince of conde or whether he would come downe into the lowe countries howbeit the princes armie coasted the riuer of maze euen vnto stockum where he passed the ryuer to meete with the duke of alua his campe

whyle these matters were in hande the duke of alua caused aproclamation to bee made in antwerpe that euery man which had or knew of any goods belongyng to the gueses shold tell it to the lorde treasurer or to the magistrate and officer of

the place where those goods were vpon paine that whosoeeuer concealed them or suffered them to bee carryed out of the countries shoulde pay the valure of the saide goods the one thirde part whereof shoulde bee to the informer and the rest confisked to his maiesties vse but hee that was not able to restore them shoulde be arbitrarily punished
this proclamation caused great mischiefe

in the ende of september the duke of alua came on mastright side
the liegeois woulde haue taken vp a certaine passage for the stopping of the armie but the prince marched with his people on the other side and although there had beene a controuersie between ye bishop and ye liegeois yet they agreed by a co~mon consent to leuie sixe ensignes of men for the defense of the citie
the fifteenth of october the orangians discomfited certain ensignes of aluaianes
but when the prince had passed the maze bee marched forwarde the twentieth of october leauing on his right hande the towne tilmont and passed the riuer whiche diuideth the lande of lieg from brabant seeking all the wayes he could to fight with the enemie howbeit the duke of alua had no will to hazard it and therfore fearing the prince of orange his forces kept himselfe in his trences before the citie of mastright
but don fredericke of toledo his sonne came one day out of the campe with sixe culuerines foure thousand shot and an hundred men at armes but no great matter was exployted saue yt in skirmishing many on both sides were thrust out of wages
when the prince sawe that winter drewe neere and the time passed away without giuing battaile to the duke of alua who lay in his trenches before mastright although at the first the princes armie might haue fought and discomfited the enemie had it not beene through euill counsell or els that the lorde god would not suffer it because hee woulde further punish the lowe countries for their horrible and grieuous sinnes

but nowe againe to our purpose the prince meaning to auoyde the vnprofitable charges in the consuming and spending

of victuals money and munition thought it the best councell to forsake for a time the lowe countries and make a voyage into fraunce where the marshall cossey pursued him with two thousand shot two hundred horse which was to his great hurt
whiche thing the marshall dyd at the request of the duke of alua and followed the prince euen vnto cambresie

the frenche woulde gladly haue had the germayne horse men to haue come downe into fraunce but the greatest number of them returned home into germanie for want of pay and taking their way through champaigne entred into lorayne and beeing come neere vnto straesbrough they diuided themselues not well pleased with theyr pay and thus ended this warr betweene the prince of orange and the duke of alua who euer sithence hath continued a more tyrannous persecutor in murderyng emprisoning cuttyng off of heads hanging burning confisking of goods publishing of proclamations and commissions and bringing in of newe bishoppes as at leewarde in friselande where cunerus petri was ordeined the first bishop the first of february
and afterward were very solemnely ordeined certaine others in the prouinces of the low countries
nowe this tyraunts great persecution and tyrannie aforesaide continued from the yeere
vnto the yeere
when as the miserable and comfortles inhabitaunts of the lowe countries had through gods assistance and mercy some ease of their calamities by reason that the saide duke obstinately persisted in demanding of the tenth penny without regard of the complaints of all the estates of the lowe countries thinking thereby to heape vp suche an infinite treasure and keepe a continuall mine of golde and siluer to withstande all kinges princes and potenrates that woulde oppose themselues against his vnnaturall tyrannie

and although the lorde hath suffered this tyrant to bee a scourge to plague the lowe countries which sometimes so notably florished yet hath it been to none other end but to aduertise vs that we in the time of our great prosperitie wallowing and

tumbling in all worldly pleasures forgot the lorde our god and that forsaking our wicked life through the chastizement of this rod wee might frame our selues to newnesse of life according to his most holy and blessed commandements
for the good god all those whome hee loueth neither hath these lowe countries been onely so greatly scourged through the tyrannie of this cruell and vnnaturall monster but hath also visited them with a most fearefull ouerflowing of waters insomuch that the first of nouember in the yeere
were drowned in hollande zealand friseland gelderland and others many thousandes of people and an innumerable multitude of cattaile for mans sustenance
this wounde gentle reader is healed and almost for gotten but the tyrannie of the duke of alua is yet in force

wherefore let vs beseech ye lord our god to deliuer vs out of the handes of this tyrant to the ende wee may serue and honour him in peace and tranquilitie all the dayes of our life
and heere an ende of the second booke

the thirde booke of the histories of the troubles in the low countries wherin shalbe set downe the second inuasion of the nobilitie gentlemen and other fugitiues and banished men into the same
in the first and seconde bookes gentle reader hath been declared vnto thee what hath come to passe from the yeere
vnto the yeere
and the very first originall of this present warre but in this thirde shall bee described all the matters that haue fallen out from this yeere
vnto the taking of the councell of estate in bruxelles which was put in execution by the lorde of heze captaine of the same citie the
of september
by the ordinance of the estates of brabant and nowe to continue this our historie the duke of alua seeing yt the prince with his armie had forsaken the low countries as a triumphant conquerour pursued the tyrannous persecution which hee had begun against those of the reformed religion as more at large is set downe in the booke next before and although that in these countries the warres were for the space of foure yeeres surpressed to wit from the yeere
vnto the yeere
yet haue they not been free from the abundant spilling of innocent blood through the horrible furie of this vnnaturall and cruel tyrant

but when the lorde woulde graunt vs a beginning of our deliuerance hee suffered this foresaid tyrant to abuse hymselfe through his owne insatiable couetousnes

by demanding of all ye merchandize both going out co~ming in vnto these low countries ye tenth pennie also the xx pennie of all the vnmoueable goods yt should be sold within ye said countries although all ye

estates of the prouinces tolde him of the inconueniences that might fall out by reason of this extreeme exaction yet persisted he in his demaunde thinking that no man durst once gainsaye him notwithstanding that it was cleane against their priuiledges
which thing greatly moued the common people and the citizens of all the cities were maruellously grieued as wel for the tenth penny which the duke woulde haue no nay of as also for the great tyranny hee vsed
lastly hee purposed to put this tenth pennye in execution in the cytie of bruxelles where his court was thinking that by reason of his presence no manne durst say him naye
but the bruxellians dyuerslye sette them selues against it
for neyther woulde the brewers brewe anye drinke nor yet the bakers bake anye bread
to bee shorte there arose so greate troubles in this citie of bruxelles as that the duke him selfe feared the tumulte and furye of the common people
and therefore the citizens of bruxelles are woorthye all honour and prayse for so boldelye defending the pryuiledges of theyr countrey

during these troubles in bruxelles the common people of ye rest of the cities and townes both in brabant flanders were also troubled so that the hollanders and zelanders begun likewise to rowze themselues out of their sleepe which made the fugitiues and banished men to thinke on their businesse and determined once againe to inuade the low countries seeing the inhabitants of the said countries began to oppose themselues against the tyrant

wherfore de lumay earle of march being in england

hauing at his commandement certayne ships got himself his retie to sea vpon the sodaine tooke the briele a towne in holland the
of april
for the saide count first set the south gate on fire by meane whereof inhabitantes kept them selues close in their houses and in the meane while the souldiers skaled the towne and the north gate and so woon it afterwarde brake and destroyed the images and altars of the churches

the duke of alua was forthwith aduertised of this sodaine taking and although the newes pleased him neuer a whit yer

made he small accompt of his enemies because he had continually most victoriously driuen them out of the countrey
wherfore he sent two ensignes of spaniards from vtright to the briele to driue out the gueses howbeit the gueses met them with theyr boates who discharging their harquebuzes vppon the spanyardes and comming on lande made the spaniardes lustely flye through the myre and dyrt and droue them to dordright

the count bossu hauing the charge of ten ensignes of spanyardes considering with himselfe that the gueses would not willingly forsake and lose the briele but were rather more like to get many other townes he therfore came to rotterdame willing them that he might passe through the towne whiche thing the citizens at the first choppe denied him neuerthelesse in the end they were contented that his people shoulde passe by

but they making hed al at once at the gates entred together into the towne and villaynously murdered a great number of the citizens and this was done the nienth of aprill


three dayes before

whiche was easter day the towne of flushing reuolted wherein was a garnison of walonnes
and it so fell out that as the citizens were at churche sodaynely there was an vprore by reason that it was bruted that the spaniardes were comming to lodge in the towne and as the harbingers were appoynting the lodginges they pycked a quarrell with one of the citizens and gaue him yll language as they coulde well ynough
the cytizens who were at churche hearing of this noyse came foorth and draue the walonnes cleane out of the towne and kepte the gates themselues
when the spanyardes were come before flushing they woulde not let them come in whereuppon they hearing that the garnison of the walons were driuen out tooke their course to middlebrough the chiefe citie of the isle of walcheren where they were receyued
nowe when the captayne of the spanyardes who was the duke of alua his kinsman arryued at flushing hee thought to haue found the spanyardes there but the townes men who knew wel inough

that he was comming went to meete him byddyng him welcome and doyng him great honour as the maner is to honor such noblemen howbett that honour lasted not long for they foorthwith layde handes on hym and hanged him on the gallowes

and so this towne hath been euer sithence kept for the prince of orange which is the chiefe key of the sea to come into the lowe countries to bee brought into subiection howbeit it is worthie great commendation by reason of the noble feates of warre which the citizens haue exployted against the practizes and stratagemes of the spaniardes for the defense of the countrie

the
of may following after that the count lodwike of nassou had made a new couenaunt in fraunce with the confederates he surprysed monts in haynault after this maner

the nyght before there went into mons twelue aduenturers apparrelled like merchauntes and beeing at the table in the euenyng they asked of the hoste what tyme in the morning the gates were opened
the hoste tolde them at foure of the clocke and if so bee they woulde goe out any timelier he said that if they woulde giue the porter the wyne the gates should bee opened for them as early as they woulde

these iollye merchants rose very timely and caused the gates to bee opened promising to giue the porter a peece of money but so soone as the gates were open they dispatcht the porter with a pistoll shot and tooke away the keyes
when the gates were open counte lodwike entred the towne with fortie men and placed them at the corners of the streetes and if any man went about to open eyther dore or window they would discharge their pystols on the crying together with one voyce you haue libertie libertie graunted you the prince of orange is come to ayde you and you shall bee set free from the tenth pennie and all other charges wherewith the duke of alua woulde burden you
this cry dured certaine houres with such a marueilous noyse as if thousands of souldiers had entred the towne

but count lodwike hauing long time taryed for his people

and sawe that none of them came hee himselfe went out to vnderstand the cause of theyr so long tarrying and what were become of the horse men but they were out of ye way in the woods from whence the count lodwike conducted them vnto ye towne of mons to the number of fiue hundreth and euery man a shot behinde him who beeing entred the towne first tooke the towne house and set themselues in order of battaile in this sorte then tooke they the towne whiche was in truth a kingly deede of a noble and famous count and woorthie euerlasting memorie to winne by sleight and pollicie a towne so strongly fortified

the same day also was the citie of valencia surprised

but not many dayes after the duke of alua tooke it againe
for as hee had sent thither don iohn de mendoza with a certaine number of horse men to make prouision for the castle that was but yll furnished with victuals and munition hee who in the name of counce lodwike had surprised the citie vnderstandyng of the commyng of the spaniardes foorthwith contrary to the opinion of all men especially of the spaniardes forsooke and least the towne who thought not so easilye without besieging to haue wonne it

the duke receyuing newes of the taking of mons would not beleeue it trusting more to the letters whiche hee had from the frence king by which he was aduertised that count lodwik had been a few dayes sithence in fraunce howbeit by the continuance of the newes hee did assure himselfe that the towne was taken whereupon hee was cast into such a rage as that he tare his garmentes and troade vppon his cappe stormyng and chafyng as if hee had beene out of his witte and mad
but as the duke of alua was altogether put by for resistyng of his enemies the lorde of lumay gotte hymselfe by little and little to bee master of the cities and townes of hollande who freely yeelded themselues vnder the protection of the famous prince of orange although hee himselfe was not there for euery man desired to bee deliuered from the slauery of the said duke and of the spaniardes

the citie of enchusen standing in the north partes of hollande was the first that opposed it selfe agaynst the tenth penie

and the tyrannie of the sayde duke and it was by reason of certayne souldiers which were in the shippes of warre whome they of enckhuysen and amstelredame had armed
for as vpon the tenth of iune
boshuysen captayne of the sayd shippes was entered enckhuysen to furnishe his shippes with victualles and other warlike furniture there entred by little and little many souldiers thinking to take the towne which dealing the citizens perceyuing made them packe out of the towne and tooke the sayde captayne boshuysen prisoner whome after a while they released out of prison

but as the citizens were thus troubled and fearing the receiuing in of souldiers for the enforcing of them to pay the tenth penie they sent for count lumay his souldiers and put themselues vnder the obedience of the famous prince of orange and within a while after the townes of alkmer horne edam and memmelicke did the like
when the townes of hollande that lay nearest the briell hearde of this they in like maner sette open their gates to the princes people and submitted them selues vnder his obedience sauing they of schoonehoue and amstleredam who stoutly resisted but the lorde of lumay besieged schoonehoue who seeing the breach made rendred so that all holland yeelded to the sayde lorde except amstelredam which the saide count besieged once or twise but it was in vayne and vnprofitable for it was ouer stronge neyther could hee euer wynne the citizens heartes because they were very obstinate papistes

whiles the count of march plaied his parte in holland

the count berge the prince of oranges brother in lawe leuied men of warre and tooke the countie of zurphen the townes of dortcum doebrough and zurphen and in the dutchie of gelderlande hardwyke ter elberich and hattum but in the countrey of twent oldezele goer and others

the count of berge seeing the good affection of the citizens of the townes passed on like a conquerer and came downe into the countrey of oueryssel besieging the town of lawrance
the towne of tampen but because the citizens were vnprouided of victualles and munition they rendred the

towne and so afterwarde did they of swolle hasselt and steenewyke
townes of the countrey of oueryssel

whiles the lowe countreys were assayled on euery side by the lordes gentlemen fugitiues and banished men of the said countreyes the of alua bent only all his forces against counte lodwyke his chiefe enemie and had sent into the borders of fraunce a sufficient number of spaniardes to fight with and discomfite the french that were sent by the lordes of the reformed religion in fraunce to assyste counte lodwyke who were betweene seuen and eyght thousand men whome the spaniardes

the
of iuly
ouerthrewe at thieuraine in a great broade fallowe fielde for want of good conduct and tooke their chiefe captaynes maister ienlis and maister iumelle the one of which was carried to antwerpe where without being sicke that any man knewe hee was one morning founde suddenly deade and the other to the castle of tournay who was deliuered in exchaunge for another prysonner being a spaniarde

after this discomfiture

the duke of alua him selfe went and encamped before montes and very straytly besieged it
and the count lodwyke valiantly defended it still looking for ayde from the prince of orange his brother

amongst these exploytes

there was likewise another inuasion made in west friselande by the gentlemen and the reste of the banished with their trayne amongest whome euen from the first beginning was captayne generall the lorde of newderworinter and after the count iust of schouwenbourgh who were receiued into the townes of sneecke boelswerd franique
but the court of friseland taking part with the aduersarie called from groening the lorde of billi to bee an ayder against these gueses who came with a iolly companie of well appointed wallons and was receiued into the towne and castle of leewarde into the castle of harlingue and into the castle of stauere

the first enterprise that the gueses tooke in hande was against doccum for they came with good stoare of souldiers and countreymen and draue away the wallons which lay in garnison at doccum

now there were fiue of these walons whiche had gotten vp into the church steeple shot at as many as went abroad in the streetes
which when the gueses saw they set fire on ye steeple to cause the said walons to come downe howbeyt there was but one of them burnt and the rest tarried still in the steeple vntil the
of september
when as the walons draue the gueses out of doccum and recouered the towne which was burnt and sacked so that the citizens were in great misery for they are alwayes the men that are driuen to the wall and paye for all

when the lord of billi acunning an expert man of warre perceiued that the gueses souldiers for the most part were cou~trey men and prenteses who were vnacquainted with discharging of an haguebuze he made voyde theyr seconde enterprise which they tooke in hande at stauere where the gueses had besiged the castle
for hee came with his wallons

and draue them from stauere and so set fire on the towne but as the wallons returned from stauere with great butin the gueses of sneecke boelswerd and franique gathered themselues together to take away the butin from the wallons ouerthrowe them but so soone as the captaine of the gueses was stricken from his horse with an harquebuze shot all the rest fled and the other gueses were driuen from the fortes that stoode vppon the baucke and other places with shame enough hauing gotten neither wealth nor yet victorie on their enemies

the prince had once againe assembled a very great army about duyibourgh who passing the rhine tooke by assault

the fourth of auguste the towne of ruremonde and passing further into brabante louayne rendered to him and malynes with many other townes were surprised

after that hee marched on towardes montes in haynault to ayde count lodwike his brother

howebeit the massacre committed at paris and in many other townes in fraunce so altered the case as that the prince retourning by malines with his armie vnto ye rhine discharged his armie himselfe with a small companie of men of warre went into holland whether he was sent

after the long battery of mants

count lodwyke seeing no way how to be holpen fell to a part and the
of september rendred the towne to the duke of alua vpon certaine conditions to wit that duke lodwyke should be sent with a safe conuay vnto the borders of the empire
which thing when the garnisons of malynes duremond and others which kept them to his vse vnderstood they forsooke the same townes went theyr wayes

the duke of alua returning with his army from mouts

came to bruxelles and sent his souldiers to sacke malines which they did the
of october notwithstanding yt the cleargie and all the citizens of the towne receiued the in with banners streamers displayed to appease their fury but all was in vaine
for the duke had giuen the souldiers the towne who wholy spoyled it killed many citizens and defloured great store of women and young maidens

the prince being come into his gouernement of holland trauelled in all hee coulde about the affayres for the warres and the duke of alua cleane contrary sent colonel mondragon with twenty ensignes of wallons into the ile of south beueland where they arriued at a lowe water marke through the conduct of certaine traitours to theyr countrie and raysed the siege from before tregoes which was greatly distressed straitly couped vp

the
of nouember the duke of alua his armie came before the towne of zurphen

which was taken without any resistaunce for the citizens had set the gates wide open for them to come in at

but so soone as they were entred the duke exercised very great tyrannie both vpon the citizens and also on the souldiers hanging some and strangling and drowning other some in the riuer of yssell
this tyrannie of the duke so greatly feared the rest of the townes that the count berge forsaking all the townes which hee had gotten fledde from thence with all his souldiers
and so did likewise the count scauwenbourgh in friseland in memorie whereof they of sneecke enprysonned their patrone the lord of netherwormter whom they had sent for and with great solemnitie receiued into the towne

duke fridericke the duke of alua his sonne

and lieutenaunt came from zurphen towardes narden in hollande where hee so cruelly and vnnaturally handled the citizens that had yeelded them selues as that it is a fearefull thing to thinke on and that against all the lawes of armes eyther in christendome or heathenesse

for when the spaniardes were entered and louingly receyued and had been as well entreated as was possible there was immediatly after proclaymation made by the sounde of the droombe that all the citizens and enhabytauntes of the towne shoulde come to the hospitall chappell where shoulde bee declared vnto them suche ordinaunces as they must line and direct them selues by
but when the miserable citizens were come thither the spaniardes murdered euery mothers sonne of them sackte and burnt the towne rauished the women yea and murdered some of them and left the rest liue in great martyredome
nowe when call to minde the wonderfull woorkes of god can not passe ouer but tell you howe that after the murder and massacre of narden and the whole towne on a flaming fire a young ladde of the age of seuen yeeres was saued by running out of the gates of the towne into a little garden full of roots the father of this boy was murdered and his mother beeyng rauished was hanged vp by the armes of the tyrannous spaniardes and when the fire came and tooke holde of her house shee being tyed by the armes coulde not get away so that shee was burnt in her owne house
this young ladde hauing not eaten any thing for the space of three whole dayes together wept bitterly both for the death of his parentes as also by reason that hee was hungerbit
but god who neuer forsaketh his sent him reliefe for the very same night there came vnto him a well fauoured young man in white apparell who gaue him whereon to fedde and sayde weepe no more my fatherlesse childe for will neuer leaue thee

eate and be of good cheere for they that haue murdered thy father and mother shall haue a double plague light vpon them
thy teares shal be turned into toy and gladnes and their laughing into teares and mourning and forthwith the young man

vanished out of sight

thus wee see gentle reader the mercifull and bountifull goodnes of god who neuer forsaketh his but keepeth them as the apple of his eye

after the massacre and murder at narden

the spaniards besieged the citie of harlem
the citizens considering of their neighbours case and example were determined notwithstanding the weakenes and small defensablenesse of their towne to resist ye force of the enemie chusing a great deale rather honorablie to die for the defence of their countrey then to become the slaues of such murderers
and therefore will describe vnto thee in order the whole historie of the towne of harlem howe all thinges went from the first beginning of the siege euen vnto the very last ende thereof

the duke of alua being not yet satisfied with the innocent blood which hee had spilt aswell at zurphen as at narden not thinking that the lorde of hostes had an eye vnto his tyrannous deuises purposed to bring all the cities and townes vnder his yoke and insomuche that hauing executed some tyrannie and crueltie hee purposed to beginne another
to be shorte hee besieged the good citie of harlem meaning to reduce all the rest of the townes vnder his yoke after he had once gotten it which god in his prouidence woulde not suffer him to doe
don fridericke of toledo the duke of alua his sonne through the counsell and aduice both of the boroughmaisters of amstelredam as also which is very likely because he was loth to cast away his souldiers practized by trecherie and warlike pollicie with the magistrate of harlem who partly fauoured him especially one thyerrie a friselander somtime boromaister in whome was reposed the whole state and dealing of the towne although he perfourmed not therein that duetie that hee ought to haue done but purposed to deliuer all the people into the hands of the bloody tyrauntes so that hee might haue his pardon as manifestly appeareth by a letter that was sent

the thirde of december in the yeere
at seuen of the clocke in the morning the great counsell of harlem assembled

by reason of a letter that was sent by one maister iames wye curate of grand beginage secretely written and directed to a brother of his that was then in the towne conteyning the tyrannies which the duke and his people had committed in many townes but that if so be any would craue pardon hee woulde graunt it them

when the magistrate had caused this letter to be red in open counsell hee asked the opinion and aduise of them that were there whither it were best to sende to don fridericke or no wherein alas was the counsell of achitophell followed and for the bringing of it to passe there went out secretly at spaerwouwer gate vpon a sled drawen on the yse the aforesayde thierry the fristander thristopher schagen and adrian of assendelft the pensioner telling the wagonner nothing els but that they would goe to sparendam
but so soone as they were come vnto the banke or dike they saide vnto him bring vs halfe way and from thence to sloterdike where the wagonner set them on lande and would bring them no further so that they were enforced to foote it to amstelredam
the same day were the sworne men of the towne of harlem sommoned to appeare at two of the clocke in the afternoone at the crossebowe archers garden where also appeared captayn weybout repperda sir launcelet of brederode adrtan iansons marshall of harlem and stuner the boroughmaister when these sworne men were assembled captayne ripperda began his oration and sayde worshipfull citizens the cause of your assembly here in this place is a letter that was seat to one of our citizens contayning that as yet there is fauour grace to be had at don fridericke his handes to the which ende thierry the friselander and others are gone to amstelredam
but my good fellowe citizens if you well weygh and of the grace that you are like to haue at his handes as also of the othe whiche you haue made to the prince of orange doubte not but that you your selues as well as my selfe will do all you can to obserue it

for am fully determined so long as haue one drop of blood in my body to hazarde my selfe for the defence of the citizens of this citie and therefore if you your selues bee of the same

opinion tell mee your mindes bouldly whereupon the sworne men answered all with one accorde that for the defence of their countrey they woulde hazarde both their bodies and goodes so that after many other louing exhortations they brake vp and euery man departed home to his owne house
howebeit the sayd captayne and marshall wrote forthwith vnto the prince of orange declaring vnto him the state of the towne

they wrote in like maner vnto the colonnell maister lazarus muller who lay at newe dam with tenne ensignes of foote men willing him to sende to harlem some of his companie whereupon the sayde muller departed from the same place with all his regiment and passing through base or lowe hollande came to the ayde of harlem
so that hee arriued there the fourth of the sayde moneth with tenne ensignes foure of which went into the towne whose captaynes were captayne stenbach the colonels lieutenant christopher vader lambarde of wirtenberge and martin pruys
and the selfe same day were the churches ridde and clensed of all the idols and filthie imageries that the pure worde of god might there be preached
the fifth of december returned from amstelredame christopher schagen and adrian assendelft the pencioner who were forthwith sent as prisonners to the prince of orange
the same day was brought vnto the towne from a place called the fiue houses a messenger of amstelredam by thierry the friselander to the boroughmaisters of harlem howebeit when the sayde messenger was come neere to the towne hee durst not come in him selfe but sent his letter by a countreyman the which messenger after he had been examined and tried was hanged all but the head
the
of the same moneth the enemie came to sperwouwe and skyrmished to small purpose with those of sparendam
whereupon the boroughmasters and captaynes sent the next morrowe three hundred souldiers to ayde sparendam vnder the charge of martin pruys then captaine
the same day the enemie returned and skirmished the sparendames lustily saluted them with their great ordinaunce

the
of the sayde moneth the boroughmaisters and captaynes sent to sparendam certaine citizens of harlem and others to pearce the dike whiche is betweene sparendam and sperwowe because they woulde haue the water ouerflowe the lande
howbeit it was not digged nor cut downe deepe enough
the same day also had the spanyardes entrenched themselues vppon the sayde dyke against the sparendames and made the countreymen fill vp the sayde ditche
the same day also arryued at harlem monsieur saint aldegond sent by the prince of orange to be a commissioner for the choosing of a new magistrate the placing of honest men right patrones there which in deed he did
the
day at tenne of the clocke in the morning the sworne men once againe met together at the garden aforesaide whither also came monsieur saint aldegond a very eloquent man declaring vnto the sworne men the good and naturall affection which the prince of orange bare vnto the lowe countries but especially to the countie of holland as by diuers examples had been shewed
declaryng likewise the estate of the towne by the stinking away of thierry the friselander as before hath beene sayde shewing eftsoones the authoritie of the commission whiche his excellencie had graunted him which charged and commaunded hym to depose the olde magistrate of harlem and appoynt an other to wit to choose burroughmasters shieriffes and a councell whiche hee saide was not meant to disworship and discredite the olde magistrate seeing that many of them had alwayes shewed their fidelitie and friendeshippe to the commonaltie but onely to keepe the saide towne presently in greater safetie
and hee further sayde that his excellencie did it not for that he meant any way to diminish the priuiledges thereof but for the preuenting of a mischiefe and therefore he very louingly required and prayed the sworn men that euery diziner would bryng in the voyces of his companions for the chusing of eight boroughmaisters fourteene sheriffes and twentie counsellours to rule the next yeere

the which election the diziners gaue him the same euening in

wryting at the house of peter keys where the sayde substitute might appoint a newe magistrate whiche was accomplyshed

the tenth of the sayd moneth it was such an extreame colde night that the riuers of spare and tye were so hard frosen at sparendam that the enemy assayled it on euery side
but after that the sparendams had valiantly defended them selues and discharged many times their great ordinance the enemy so liuely assayled them on euery side as that the garnyson that was in it was enforced to flye hauing before done greate hurte to the spanyardes howebeyt it was not without the losse of their valiaunt captayne martyn pruys and some of their chiefe souldiers
the eleuenth of the saide moneth the spaniardes both on foote and horse backe compassed about the towne of harlem against whome the townes men salied and aboute the spittle gaue them the skirmishe but because some of the spaniardes had got into the steeple the townes men coulde no way come to fight with the enemie

ouer and besides this they had furnished their trenches with hayquebuziers continually shooting at the wals and rampares to the end they might take away the curtines from the townesmen
now as they assaulted the bulwarke the townesmen so liuely beat them backe with chayne shot from the courtines so liberally hayled them with small shot as that they made them giue ouer the assault which thing the enemy seing renued the assault with fsh men howbeit they were lyuely repulsed so that they were faine to retier to their trenches with great dishonour leauing in the ditches for pawne good flore of spanyardes and other dead and hurte men and amongest the rest two spanishe ensigne bearers who valiantly had gotten vp but more lustely beaten backe besides many morions harquebus pikes and rapiers that were left behinde in the ditches which did the townesmen very good seruice

the
day the souldiers of the towne salied out in a great heate to poyson or pegge the great ordenance of the enemie but because the townes men were not egally at one instaunt redie to doe it it turned to nothing and so much the rather because the enemie was readie in the trenches to giue the assault so that the townes men were inforced to retyre and thereby were many of them hurt to wit captaine michael in the hande cousin in ye knees with a pyke his ensigne bearer in the arme with an harquebuze shot and captaine lambart of wirtenberg in the breast with a launce
the townes men gaue fire to the myne of the bulwarke and thereby kild a great number of the enemies

the last day of ianuarie the enemie was prepared to giue a liuely attempt to the towne as in very deede came to passe
for as the almaines who that night watched neere vnto the gate of saint crosse and saint iohns gate were negligent in theyr watch the enemie before the day breake was readie at hand and had placed all the ensignes about saint iohns gate a number of which souldters had alreadie got themselues into the chambers and other places of the gate halfe beaten downe before the townes men knewe any thing of it
on the other side many of ye enemies were passed vnderneath the bulwarke that was beaten downe at saint crosse gate and hid themselues vnder an hedge of thornes all alongst the ditches from crosse gate vnto iohns gate by reason that the ditches were frosen
moreouer they of the bulwarke and fort at saint crosse gate were placed in good order with ensigne displaid and all the rest kept the trenches of crosse gate which was beyond iohns gate euen

vnto the tower of reuelin in very good order so yt to any mans thinking the victorie was alredie theirs for there were to begin the assaust
or
ensignes of spaniardes almaines and wallons
there were also placed neere to the spittle betwixt fiue and sixe hundred horse and besides in the linkes likewise about two hundred horse an other part was accompanied with souldiers lying at the entrie of the wood attending the victorie of this assault for the murdering of the citizens and souldiers who after the town was taken shold any way seeke to flie thence and saue them selues

this assault was to bee giuen by the spaniardes almaines and wallous to wit by the spaniardes and almaines from saint crosse gate downe all alongest the ouerthrowne rampares vnto iohns gate
and the walons to giue the assault at the saide saint iohns gate who had alreadie gotten the aduantage of the said gate and rampares before any of the townes men perceiued it
now as the enemie had this great adua~tage against ye townes men whiche coulde no way be recouered without great effusion of blood if god by his grace had not prouided for it the souldters sworne men which watched this night in that quarter so soone as it was day had quickly perceiued it wherfore fiftie or threescore of them lustily charged them betweene the gates and valyantly pealed them with harquebuze shot crying alarme whiche noyse awaked them that were there about made them runne with their weapons to the rampares and so did likewise al the townes men charging the enemie very couragiously so that therein they siue many and beate backe the rest from the toppe downe beneath the walles and rampares so that all the spaniardes wallons and almaines were in a short tune dispatched in great numbers for they so valiantly withstood the enemie as that there coulde not a man so soone peepe aboue the rampare but that hee dyed for it

the strongest assault that the enemie gaue and were most in number was at the olde bulwark at saint crosse gate which the enemie had gotton hard by the new fort that the townes me had fortified and the enemie for the giuing of ye assault had vndermined it because they meant to winne it by maine strength

but they within had so countermined and made such a pit belowe vnder the breach put into it certaine barrels of powder and such other like stuffe as yt in giuing fire thereto when as the spaniardes with ensignes displayed were in greatest number gotten vp to the topp of the walles they so lustily bestirred them selues as that the myne and as many as were vpon it and there about were blowne vp into the ayre so that a great number of the enemies were sent to heauen headlesse armeles and legles yea torne and rent in peeces besides those that there were buried

it was a feareful thing to see howe the heads armes and legges yea whole bodies also harquebuzes halberdes rapiers and drummes flewe vp into the apre
ouer and besides al this the townes men got them into the trenches of the enemie and slue of them in great numbers as many as were not able to flie thence
they discharged also a demie serpentine other yrou peeces amongest them which stood in order of battayle before saint iohns gate making therewith great slaughter of the enemie which caused the spaniards and wallons retyre with shame enough into theyr trenches carrying away all their dead that were of any reputation as fast as they coulde
in this assault of ye cownes men yt were deadly hurt was captaine lambart of wirtzenbourgh who shortly after yeelded vp ye ghost to god
whyles the spaniardes gaue the assault at saint crosse gate and saint iohns there entred in at scaelwike gate

horse vppon the yse who were pursued euen vnto harlem gates with an hundred horse and certaine shot to haue taken away theyr victuals but all in vaine howbeit in very deede the princes cornet bearer and one other of that companie lost their liues

in the euening the burroughmasters sent two messengers with letters to his excellencie who immediately vpon theyr returne brought with them an almaine horse man prisoner that was ryding towardes the wood to his companie

the same daye the enemye thought to giue fire to the myne whiche they them selues had made at saint crosse gate thinking thereby greatly to endamage the towne but it was by gods grace so preuented with a countermyne as that the townes men gaue fire to the myne where they dispatched a greate manye both of souldiers and pyouers without any hurt or losse to the towne

of the clock in the afternoone the townsmen once more parled with the enemy at the place aforesaid
the next morow they againe set vp the black flag vpo the tower to signifie vnto the ships their great penurye distresse
the same day returned one of the flying postes with letters from the prince aduertising them that hee meant the night following to victuall them
the same night al the souldiers in the towne issued out at scaelwike gate in a camisado looking ettery houre when the shippss should set their men on land for the ayding and relieuing of the towne but it was al in vaine
the next day the townsmen parled againe with the enemy to wit
on either side where was the count bossu the count ouerstein foure others on the enemies behalfe and steinbach iohn fliet rosoni sohey pellican and cornelius mathew on the behalf of the towne but they could not agree
for the souldiers would at no hand depart the town without their armour and weapon

the
of iuly at noone the princes ships shewed the selues to ye townsmen wherupo the citize~s a great number of ye souldiers salied out of the town to assist the which thing the enemy

seeing gaue the alarm before the bulwark the alarme bell also sounded out so yt the enemy was forced to recyer then discharged they the
last canon shot bullets of which had beene discharged vpon the towne fro the beginning of the siege euen vnto ye day
the
of that month was a white flagg set vpon the tower and they also sent by plaine force in a smal vessell acaptaine of the towne named nycholas barnard to the prince of orenge his shippes carrying with him foure doues and a letter to the prince of orenge aduertising and praying him that he would send victuals by the barques because they were no longer able to abyde the famine

the
of the said month came a letter fro ye prince of oreng subsigned also by the last post praying the to haue patience for a day or two he would by the helpe of god rayse the camp of ye enemy
which newes greatly reioyced the citizens soldiers of the town albeit euery man before was ready to haue quite and cleane forsaken it for many of them had giuen away their goodes and apparel to them that would take them and besides the souldieres spoyled some of them of al they had insomuch yt it was a lamentable case to see ye misery wherin they were
the same day also the souldiers forcibly set vpon a lombard or vserers house and tooke away all the goodes he had for they looked euery houre when they should leaue the towne
the
of iuly returned a flying poste with letters from the prince conteining that he trusted the night following to ayde ye towne that his ships shoulde giue a false alarme to fuyke howbeit the whole force lighted vpon them which lay in ye wood which newes wakned the geatest part of ye town aboue
souldiours citizens watting looking for the had put on whit shirts to giue them the camisado yt they might therby helpe the rest which enterprise as then tooke not effect which greatly discomfited the townsinen seeing that what by reason of famyne and want of victuals they were wo~derfully weakned
the same night ye princes ships gaue a false alarm to fuyke shooting off their great ordenance wtout doing of any thing yt auayled
ther was at ye time so great a famin in harle as yt many died of ho~ger

the
of iuly came in a flying poste bringing newes that the princes people were discomfited at mannepat whereupon

certaine captaines were of the opinion that the best way was for euery man to prepare him selfe to be gone and leaue the town with the women and children onely in it but yet they did not so for when the women vnderstood that they meant to leaue them and then chldren in the towne they forthwith so disorderly rann about weeping crying as that no good course could be taken therin
the
of the said month the soldiours of the towne prepared them selues once againe to forsake the towne and for the making of the way sure they first appointed seuen eusignes for the vauntguard the very body and strength wherof should be altogether shot next to it should the magistrate the swornmen ye citizens with their wiues children folow for the rerewarde they appoynted nine other ensignes
howbeit this enterpryse tooke no effect by reason of a letter which came fro the enemy in the wood containing that as many as were in the towne should be receiued to mercy wherupon the almain captains soldiers giuing credit therunto this deuice imediatly ceased
the same day ye spaniards in toke of victory had placed vpo their bulwark ye
ensignes which they had the day before wonne fro ye princes people
the
of iuly in ye euening
or
ensignes of walons al shot co~cluded to go out at scaelwik gate in deede ye greater number of the were already gotten out with many citizens and swornmen so yt there was scarse any man left to defe~d ye breach which was a difordered confused kinde of dealing but because ther were none of those ready at hand which had charg of the letting down of the bridges euery man retyred with great trouble and anoye between the citizens and soldiours in euery quarter
and surely if god of his especiall grace had not miraculouslye kept the town the enemy might easily haue surprised it for ther was not a soldiour left at the breach betwixt

of ye clock at midnight
the same day the townesmen wrote an answere to the enemie in such sorte as that the messenger went and came backe twise
in which day the soldiours had most cruelly murdered quintin his daughter and the sexten his wife of the church which may be an example for all such as think to do the selues good by ye misery of their neighbours felow citize~s

the
of the said month in the euening steinbach rosoni christofer vader
burroughmaisters agreed with ye enemy

to render the towne vpon composition howbeit this compositio no whit pleased rosoni and therefore he foorthwith aduertised the other walo captaynes who immediatly opposed the~selues against it and pulling vp the draw bridge woulde not suffer the persons aforesayde come in neuerthelesse at last they came in greatly encouraging ye citizens souldiers saying that don fredericke would shew them greater fauour then they eyther hoped or yet looked for

the
of the said moneth proclamation was made by the sou~d of the drum that al the companies shuld assemble the~selues at a certaine place where they were asked whether they would tarry in the towne with the fauour or disfauour of the duke of alua or els depart without armour and weapon wherupon answere was made yt they had rather abide in the towne stand at ye curtesie of the said duke the to depart without armour weapon besides the scots easterlings were let to vnderstande yt they were receiued into fauour wherefore the rest of the souldiers commending the~selues to the mercy of god waited to see what wold become of the
whe the bordethard the speake of grace he forthwith co~manded one of his souldiers to kill hun wt anharquebuze saying
beseech thee friend

that thou which hast done me many good seruices wouldest now at this present do me the last eue to disbend thine harquebuze vpon me which thing ye souldier after long refusall acco~plished
the cause why this romane act was done was by reason yt the enemie had said vpon ye co~position yt as many as had bin at monts in haynault should haue no grace shewed the
at
of the clock in the morning they went out at the wood gate to confirme this composition and the sworne men were sent to the towne house to know of them

if the said composition liked them seeing they were the men which were to make vp the full summe of two hundred fortie thousa~d florings which the burroughmasters had promised for the redeeming of ye town to be paid at two paiments to wit an hundred thousa~d florins wtin
daies the rest within three mo~ths next ensuing wt which co~position the sworn me must be co~te~ted

nowe when the cittie was yeelded vp into the duke of alua his handes a proclamatio was forthwith made by the ringing of the great bell that all citizens and soldiers should bring in

all their armour and weapon into the towne house and that all the men should immediatly goe to the wood abbay the women to the cathedrall churche and all the souldiers to bakenesse church howbeit the scottes almaynes were appointed to garde the rampares
when this was done one philippe matines sometimes a borroughmaister came to the wood abbay praying the borroughmaisters that they would forthwith make ready all such money as euery man was taxed to giue to the end the towne might not be sacked and that he was a substitute sent from the duke for that end and purpose
at that very present also was a loafe of bread of two pound weight deuided amongest sixe men

the
of iuly there came agayne to the abbey aforesaide the said substitute with iulian romero who put them in good hart saying that all their liues were saued by the making vp of that summe of money
the same day that the entred the scots and almaines were commanded to carry their armour and weapon to the towne house from whence they were conducted to the monasteries of saint ratherine and sainte vrsula where the spaniardes kept them
then entred don fredericke and the count bossu and with them a great manye of gentlemen
and the same day the captaines and ensigne bearers who the day before had presented their ensignes were led prisoners to clyffe house
but whiles the citizens and souldiers were kept in the church the spaniards sackt and spoylde some of the citizens houses

the

of the said month three hundred walon souldiours were hanged and beheaded without any more hurt
the same day the duke of alua came to amsterdam to take a view of the outward part of the citie of harlem wherfore he road round about the town and when he had wel viewed the platforme and the rest of the fortes and trenches he returned to amsterdam

the of the said month captain ripperda and his liuetenant were beheaded the minister or preacher of steinbach was ha~ged
soldiours drowned in harle mere
the next morow ye mony for the first payment was gathered one part of the soldiours were beheaded without scaelwyke gate
the
daye were moe then
soldiours put to the sword without the saide

gate amongst whom were many citizens who thought to passe with the soldiours and afterward saue them selues
the same day was symon symons a minister beheaded

the
of iuly lancelot brederode rosoni and the receiuer of the briele were taken who were beheaded at scooten
and the
day al the men who had lately fled for religion were taken so were likwise the boroughmaster peter reis iames gerard treasorer arnold thierry flore~ce willia~s a shoemaker arnold thierry the coeman of ye brooke haguema margliseur adria platermaker scage michiel ye sons of a walon
the of iuly commaundement was giuen by the sounde of foure drums that euerye man should make a discouery of as many as they knew to be fled vpon paine of hanging at his own porch
and the
were taken adryan iohnson marshall iohn fluet and gerard stouer burroughmaisters iohn albert secretarie iohn de fore colonell iames bartilmewe a captaine peter bal sherife and iames barnerd capcaine who soone after died in prison and was buryed in the towne
there were also taken iohn adrianson the younger colonell iohn thierry and peter thierry ensigne bearers and iohn zael vnder marshal which may be a lamentable example for almagistrates captaines citizens and others how euer they trust or buyld to or vpon the promises of peruerse malicious and subtill tyrants
the
of iuly the spaniards sommoned the towne of alkmere but so soone as they had gotten in captain ruchauer they then withstoode the whole spanish campe and therupon al the spaniards retyred towards harlem where they began to mutine which fel very wel out for the alkmerians because they had the some leasure in ye mean while to fortifie their town wherby they might the better abide the force of these barbarous tyrants

the of this month at night much to do there was amo~gst the spaniardes in the campe

because they woulde faine haue beene in the towne that they might haue had part of the spoyle with the rest nowe it was an hard matter for the gouernours to suppresse these mutenyes beecause they had then newly chosen other captaines liuetenauntes seriantes and ensigns who were also vpon the sodaine at that present entred into the town

surelye gentle reader it cannot be otherwise thought but that this dissention and disorder was euen the verye mightie worke of god considering the great commoditie benefit and gaine that redounded to these countries hereby it continued well neere seuen whole weekes or thereabout
for during all this time they could attempt nothing against the other townes and places and againe the townes hard by were in ye meane time at good leysure to buyld them bulwarks fortresses for their strength alwaies looking and attending for the force of the enemie

the
of this month great troubles controuersies arose amongst the spaniards so yt it grew to the alarme wherevpon a cornet of horsemen entred the towne howbeit they taryed there but a while and the last of this moneth the spaniardes brought in
or peeces of great ordinaunce
the
of auguste seigniour chiapin vitelli entred into harlem to content and satisfie or at least wise to agree with the soldiours on his maiesties behalfe for their payes wherwith the spaniards were no whit sory
the
of this month the soldiours of lazarus muller with their captaines were conducted out of the towne by certeine footemen and horsemen and when they had brought them neere vnto niewer church they were discharged by captaine broeckhuyse soldiours and others
the next morrow at night the spaniards gaue the alarm and simon scorl who therby thought to escape was taken prisoner
the same day the citizens and al the walon captaines were brought to scooten which was no small griefe to their friendes
the of this month about three hundred what of englishmen french scottes and walons who till then lay in prison were beheaded
and the day ensuing was don fredericke captaine generall of the spanish camp most triumphantly brought into the citie for it was agreed vpon that euery man shoulde haue
crownes a peece for his wages

the

of august being one of our lady dayes godfray de amerlede byshop of harlem verye solemnly hallowed saint bauons church
and besides hee soonge masse whereat don frederick was present immediatly after yt the ghospel was

soung ye bishops secretary propounded vnto ye said don frede

articles which he in euery conditio promised to obserue by an oth confirmed the same in the presence of the sayd bishop

the
of this moneth the spaniards came into the cathedral church of harlem to passe the musters but because they would haue abated them their prest money they departed thence without any more to doe howbeit the next day following they came againe to the church to receiue their money so departed the towne for the siege of leyden
neuerthelesse after they had long consulted of the matter they encamped before alkmer fro whe~ce in the end they went with smal honour
the same day so soone as the spaniardes were gotten out the almaynes entred
and the next morrow
walon captaynes and ensignes were beheaded at scooten
the
day were beheaded on the spittle key certaine souldiers which lay sicke in the saide spittle and the citizens which were carried to scooten were brought backe againe to the citie
the
day a general pardon was proclaymed for al the citizens
excepted which pardon together with the name of ye citizens shall hereafter be set downe
the
of august the chiefe of the sworne brotherhood assembled all the sworne men out of euery brotherhood were
pioners chosen to serue in the campe of alkmer about to be besieged by the enimie

the
of august

the spaniardes pitched their campe before alkmer to besiege it and so straitely beset it as that no manne was able to passe either in or out
ouer and besides they fortified them selues sundry dayes with many fortes or trenches giuing sundry alarms both by day and night wherupo the souldiers and citizens had many times occasion giuen the to skirmish

the
of september at night the townes men had surprised the spaniards trenches without groenenbergh and brought with them a rich butin to the towne a spaniarde also named iohn ieronimo who discouered vnto them many secret enterprises which the townes men afterward found to be very true and amo~gst other things he said be of good courage my maisters for

our men intend to batter the towne giue the assault the
of this moneth and if they then winne it not they will remoue and a way
the night ensuing the enemy su~moned the towne at the prison gate twise

the
of this moneth the enemy began the battery against the towne with
canons euery bullet weighing
pounds continued it from morning to night hauing spent in that while to the number of
bullets
and at
of the clocke in the afcernoone they began the attempt at the fishmarket gate the red tower for
houres together howbeit they were agayne lustely answeared both with great shot harquebuzes holberdes wild fire and stones at the handes of men women and children so that a great number of the enemies were there well cooled and besides the townes men had drawne vp into the towne the two bridges which were made for the assault
the same day the spaniards gaue another assault about the salt pannes howbeit they were driuen to retyre with the losse of a great manye of their people
the
of september the enemy againe saluted the towne with
canon shot was arranged of purpose to giue the assault howbeit the citizens so lustely aunsweared the with theyr great ordina~ce as that they beat their assault bridge al to fitters
and besides ye citizens wome childre had prepared an hotter messe of pottage for them then was at the first assault
the night ensuing the enemy gaue them two alarmes and the next night after that three but thanked be god no hurt was done
the
of this moneth was braue skirmishing to the enemies cost
for a walon souldier of the enimtes campe came to the towne and sayde that at the former assault were aboue
souldiers slayne and very neere
hurt by reason wherof as also because of the great raine that fel they were agreed to remoue their campe
the
of the said moneth and foure dayes after the spaniards embarqued all their great ordinaunce spoyle sauing sixe peeces
the same day the towne coyned
tinne dollers to pay the souldiers

the thirde of october three of the principall tentes

of the campe were taken away and the enemie burnt buckler house
and the next morrowe the rest of the great ordenance was enbarqued
the fift of the said moneth the alkemerans issuyng out of the towne tooke from the enemie a great barke laden with spoyle and the enemie burnt coedike

the sixth of this moneth the enemie forsooke certaine forts or trenches which the townes men sacked and brought the butin to alkemer
and the eight day the enemie set fyre on an house standing neere a myll called the rint myll and so tooke outdorpway and from thence to bergue
whereupon the citizens pursued the enemie and in the flight did them muche mischiefe
the tenth of october in the afternoone the enemie forsooke theyr principall quarter and trenches whiche was neere to the newe gate whome the citizens pursued euen to heylos and costell greatly annoying them and besides brought backe with them to the towne good store of butin
thus was the good citie of alkmer by gods helpe and their lustie defence deliuered from the enemie for the which bee all bonour glory and prayse vnto the lorde our god for euer
during the siege of alkmer to wit the fourth of october in the yeere
the castle of the rammekens in zealande was yeelded vp into the princes handes because that they which were within ye castle greatly feared yt the myne which was digged vnder one of the greatest towers of the saide castle woulde bee blowne vp and also by reason of the assault which they saw prepared against them

the
of this moneth in the yeere aforesaide

the poyet the princes for the warres surprised by a wonderful practise the towne of gertrudenbergne and flue all the walons that lay there in garnison

during the time of these exploits

the duke of alua had prepared a nauie which vnder the charge of the count of bossu kept a course to meete fight with the north holland fleete and the name of the admirall wherein the count bossu was was called the inquisition
these two nauies encountring together there began a feareful thundring of canon shot betweene them and in the ioyning was a wonderful fight and although at the

first encounter the victorie seemed to leane to the count bossu his parte yet the north hollenders by reason of a new strength wherewith they were supplyed had the victorie for when they had encompassed the admyral they without ceasing so plyed the spaniardes with balles of vuslaked lyme as that they coulde not tell where to bestowe themselues and in the meane time the rest so lustily assayled the enemie as that they were dryuen to yeelde vpon composition whereupon the spaniardes were determined to haue set all theyr powder on fire because they feared to finde no mercy at the north hollenders hands wc thing when the rest of the ships saw they packt on all their sayles and made towards amsterdam saue onely captaine festen his ship whiche was suncke with a canon shot
after that they brought ye count bossu his spaniards with the noble prise the admyrall called the inquisition to the triumphant citie of horne where they merueilously triumphed and feasted to the great comfort of all the countrie thereabout
and therefore the townes of the north holland to wit anchusen and horne are worthie all commendation for euer for their valiant and renowmed actes in the defence of their countrie

when the spaniardes saw that there was no way for them to winne alkmer

and hauing vnderstood that leyden was yll prouided for both of victuals munitio they vpo good aduise remoued the~ce marched on towards leyde where they enca~ped the selues planted theyr ordenance the last of october before the saide towne being in good hope to winne it because of their want of victuals and they so straitly besieged it as that no man coulde ouce stirre out thereof

whiles the duke of alua his deuise purpose was thus made voyde as well by the dishonorable retyre of his sonne don fredericke from alkmer as also by reason of count bossu his losse at sea so that it seemed that the worlde went not on their side newes were carryed by poste into spaine that the duke of alua through his tyrannie and obstinate demanding of the tenth pennie

had made all the whole low countries reuolt whereby there was no likelihood nor hope of victorie
whereupon don lewis of requesens the great commendator of castil was sent to be gouernour of the low countries arriued at bruxelles the

seuenteenth of nouember in the yeere aforesaid

when the duke of alua was called home into spaine

hee being mindefull of his owne profit leuied a great summe of money of the merchants because he meant to carry home a greate butin with hym
and being lodged at the house of one iohn persins in amsterdam from whence hee intended to depart the countrie hee caused it to bee proclaimed twise by the sounde of the trumpet that as many as he owed any thing vnto shoulde repayre thither and receiue their money
whereupon manie came to his lodging one demaunding two thousand crownes which hee had disboursed for him in readie money another two thousand fiue hundred and so a great many mo according to the proportion of their due
when the duke had seene this account hee appointed euery of them to resort vnto him ye next day at eight of the clocke in the morning to receiue their money howebeit hee was somewhat earlier then they and departed timely in the morning without bidding them once farewell

thus when the said duke had as aforesaid most tyrannously and cruelly gouerned the lowe countries and brought it into extreme pouertie miserie and desolation be returned thence into spaine leauing there behinde him a great number of widowes and fatherles children without either wealth kinred or friendes and so got him out of bruxelles the tenth of dece~ber

the great commendator being receiued for gouernour arriued at antwerpe where was a nauie prepared by sea to revictuall and ayde middlebrough in zealand being very straitly besieged by the prince of orange his people and as the saide commendator greatly desired to haue the battaile goe on his side so likewise woulde hee be an eye witnesse thereof thereupon going to bergues vpon zoome got himself that day that the battaile should be fought vpon the top of the wall or dyke bancke to beholde it where hee manifestly and in deed saw that in steede of victorie which he had promised to himselfe his spaniardes and walons were vanquished

many plunged ouer head and eares in the water and many lead away prysoners being in this sort hanseled with a newyeeres gift the second of in the yeere

after that they of middlebrough had by this long strait and hard siege beene weeried and left bare and naked without all hope of ayde and succour because the flushingers had oftentimes beene victors at sea and taken such a number of wel appointed shippes with great ordenance and other munition and besides had gotten thereby great and rich prises their heartes were in their hose insomuch that by reason of the great pouertie miserie and famine which they had susteined they were driuen of necessitie to yeelde themselues into the prince of oranges handes whose souldiers entred into it the
of february and his excellencie the of the said moneth in the yeere aforesaide
during these exploytes duke christopher of bauiere the sonne of count palatine the elector accompanied with the two brethren count lodwyke and count henrie of nassou came in the middest of winter with a good sort both of horse men and footemen within two myles of mastright wherupon the spaniardes which lay at the siege of leyden were driuen of necessitie to rayse their siege the
of march in the yeere aforesaid to resist them

when the lords aforesaid vnderstood that the spaniards were comming on to seeke them out they marched on and encountred them at moquerhead

where a great many of theyr souldiers hauing nothing els in theyr mouthes but money money refused to fight whereupon these valiant noble men with the rest of theyr people were enforced of necessitie to abyde the charge of the enemie loosing there both tourney and life at once after they had the fourteenth of april
valia~tly fought it out

when the spaniardes had wonne this victorie

they againe mutined for their pay but by the aduise of sancho de auila they were conducted to antwerpe where they ioyntly entred into the castle the
of apryll receiuing to their contentment fro the great commendator which hee had extorted vppon the citizens of antwerpe the summe of foure hundred thousand florins vsurping on them all kinde of crueltie and warlike licence libertie

moreouer the lorde of champigni gouernour of the sayde

towne was by them enforced to pack out thereof with all his walons and because they feared the shippes of warre whiche lay there neere for the defense of the citie well purueied of all fortes of munitions they made them depart and ryde farder off from thence

whereupon the flushingers being thereof aduertised

surprised them on a whitsunday when as the spaniards were feasting and banqueting in al their iollitie tormenting mastring the poore citizens of the citie

after the discomfiture of the aforesaide lordes the spaniardes beeing aduertised that the towne of leyden

sithence theyr departure was vnprouided of victualles and munition they encamped before it and planted theyr batterie the twentie and sixt of may and more straitly enclosed it then they did at the first
for the spaniards had built in diuers places aboute the water side

bulwarks in either of which were three peeces of great ordenance the historie of which siege here after ensueth

nowe before such time as take in hand to touch and handle the principall matter am gentle reader to beseech thee not to take in euill part my summarie declaration of this warre of hollande and zealande although it bee heere before described
and first to beginne with all the duke of alua hauing seene that the taking of mons in haynault the wonderfull departure of count lodwyke of nassou with the mightines and strength of his armie and the horrible murder at paris had made readie so open a way for his blooddy tyrannie hee like vnto a seconde antiochus full of all pride and arrogancie pursued his victorie and to beginne withall hee in october first sacked the towne of malines
after that because hee woulde shewe his furie and insatiable erueltie hee the sixteenth of nouember caused aboue fiue hundred men and women to bee murdered hanged headed and drowned at the towne of zurphen and within a whyle after hee committed another farre more cruell and horrible slaughter at the towne of narden where hee slue as it were all the whole towne after hee had made them manie faire promises and bereft them of theyr armour and weapon pursuyng afterwarde with tyrannie the townes of hollande

howbeit the almightie god whose mercy is alwayes most seene in the time of necessitie toke them into his protection myraculously sending vnto them the prince of orange as a second iudas machabeus to resist the blooddie tyrant

nowe it is well enough knowen by the stories whiche haue gone before what the bridge was ouer which he entered into the garden of holland before the citie of harlem for the co~mitting of his cursed murders here before largely enough set downe after it had abidden the siege for the space of eight moneths where don fredericke the saide duke his sonne was generall of the campe who followed the fathers owne naturall inclination hauing for all that lost at that siege aboue twelue thousand men through the valtantise of the harlemians after that the towne was rendred vnto him through the discomfiture of the princes armie and extremitie of the famine caused aboue two thousand three hundred souldiers to be executed by ye sword halter and the water who valiantly had defended this towne insomuch that the gentle reader may manifestly consider that at that time the hollanders were euen vp to the chinne in the water readie to be drowned and sincke to the grounde
for through the losse of harlem alkemer and leyden they were all in great danger
howbeit the lord god who commonly deliuereth his from oppression depriued the spaniards of their reasonable vnderstanding when as through their mutinie they leaft pursuing of their victorie which caused the hollanders to take courage againe vnto them fortified their townes and by a common accorde agreed to abide susteine a defensiue warre for the defending of their wiues children and to hazarde their bodies and goods for the benefit and welfare of their countrie
which in very deede cleerely appeared by them of leyden who according to the right custome of warres burnt and pulled downe halfe a myle about the towne all the houses castles villages monasteries and trees thereby to fortifie their towne and weaken the enemie
and so likewise had the alkemerians done

and to speake the truth the yeelding vp of harlem was a great losse to the hollanders but on the other side whosoeuer will consider and weigh what townes and fortresses of the enemy

the lorde god hath giuen deliuered vp vnto them shall find that their conquest hath byn greater then their losse
for they conquered the castle of the rammekens in zelande called zeabrough wherby they not only became maisters ouer all zela~d but obtained the key of the sea and of all the low countries
and shortly after the lewys of boyset admyral of ye quarter of the sea for the prince of orange wanne a iolly victory against the armie by sea which was set foorth of antwerpe where tenne of the greatest ships with the admirall of the enemy were taken besides those that were sounke and the souldiers which were cast ouer the boord saue only their captaine iulian romero who saued himselfe by swimming where they lost aboue of their best souldiers as well spanyardes as others

the iolly victory likewise in north hollande which the valiannt captayne nicholas ruychauer of harlem had against the armye of amsterdam where were taken prisoners the count of bossue and with him many moe aswel spaniards as others that were in the admyrall whiche they thought inuincible
will here for this time passe ouer the siege of alkmer and the shameful retraite of don fredericke after he had giue
assaultes
and also the duke of alua his retrayte into spaine and howe to his shame the proud image which stood in the castle of antwerpe was destroyed and carried away
besides the arryuall of the greate commendator of castile don lewys de requesens and the seconde battell that was fought at sea
and to make an ende leaue to the historiographers ye surprysing of the towne of gertrudenberge and manye other skyrmishes and thinges because woulde returne to the said siege of leyden

the towne of leyden then was for the first time besieged from the last of october
vnto the
of marche
for at that tyme the siege was raysed by reason of the co~ming downe of count lodwyke of nassou into the low countries so that as then holland was as it were quite ridde of al souldiers
for the famous of orange came with his army to gouicque by bommel whenas the great commendator laye not farre

off with his
the principall cause why the prince of orange pitched his campe there was for that his brother counte lodwyke had written vnto him from about mastright that he purposed the next morrowe to depart from thence with his armie and woulde bee at herwerd betwene the rhine and the maze by reason hee meant there to set ouer his horse men and ioyne with his brother and therefore requyred the prince his brother to come and meete him with his men shippes barques and bridges
and although this aduercisement nothing pleased his brother seeing that by reason of the shortnes of the time it was impossible to send into the riuer these warlike preparations and furniture yet came he with his armie to the place aforesaide vsing these or such like speeches although the comming of my brother is a thing whiche like well of yet woulde he were an hundred myles off with his armie
for his excellencie knewe right well that his comming coulde not bee without great danger as the issue thereof in the end cleerely shewed
howbeit as afore hath been saide this holpe the leydens well

the commendator aforesaide who after the victorie at moker head against duke christopher of bauier the count palarine his sonne count lodwike and count henrie his brother seemed to bee very quiet and still was not for all that ydle with his councell at bruxels but had conceiued in his head three encerprises
the first was to subdue north hollande the seconde to make himselfe master of the maze and the thirde once againe to besiege leyden for hee was throughly informed by the popish fugitiues and others their fautors which were in the towne that they had neither garnison nor yet corne that the villages were bare by reason of the continuall forestalling of certaine ill willers

nowe all the worlde knoweth what good successe the firsie enterprise which hee tooke in hande against the north hollanders had for he lost at it aboue two thousand souldiers
and besides ye successe of his antwerp armie which should haue made him master of the maze before lillo is at large set foorth by the dead and drowned souldiers and the ships which were brought to zealande and the taking of the vice admirall adolf of hamsteed
there resteth now no more but the third enterprise

which is the siege of leyden

the twentie and sixe of may at two of the clock in the morning there came before this towne frauncis baldez with an armie betweene seuen and eight thousand men both of spaniardes walons and almaines
his first arryuall was from amsterdam by harlem mere with ships caruelles barkes laden with men and victuals harde to leyerdory bridge where they stroke sayle
and about midnight there issued out of the towne a certaine captaine named master andrew with thirtie souldiers who falling into the spaniardes handes was carried away with a shot dead before the towne
howbeit the citizens got him vp and carryed him to the towne and there honorably buried him neuerthelesse they leaft in his place a dead spaniard whome they had taken prisoner
as the enemie was arriued at leyden they began againe to make their first trenches bulwarks ye citizens which were vpo ye rampares began about the day breake to march with two or three ensignes of souldiers towards zoeterwood part of which tarryed still at the said place and the rest went to the trenche or fort of leyderdam which fort through the negligence of the townes men was whole and sounde
the leydens sent messengers to hay delft roterodam and dortright where at that present was arryued the prince of orange hauing raysed his campe about bommell to the ende hee might preuent and stoppe the enemie
but the valiant captaine ruychauer which was at hay receiued the newes somewhat too late and yet neuerthelesse through his industrie and diligence he did so muche as that what by reason of the trenches and skyrmishes at the spirite bridge they of the religion whiche were in haye saued the greater part of their moueables although the papists came yt day in the euening not only to hay but also to leyderda

but when the rest of baldez armie a fewe dayes after arryued in two companies the one from vtright towardes goude sluse and alsen and the other from harlem by northwyke to falkebrough at which places the princes people had two fortes and at euery fort fiue hundred english men vnder the conduct of edward chester the saide englishe men abode the first shocque or charge

for goude sluse was hoatly assayled by the papistes that came from vtright howbeit the englishmen lustily repulsed them to their great shame and losse and that by the valiancie of captaine genforde an english man
but because the horsemen had none other way to come into holland but by these forces they were inforced by very lustie hand strokes so to continue the assault

as that the englishmen were driuen of necessitie to forsake the saide fort which had not beene so lightly done if their companions at alsen which is but halfe a myle thence had done their dueties aswell as they which were in the said fort for as they were comming to aide them the fort was alreadie wonne wherefore they all fled at once

to be short the spaniard payed dearely for this victorie for it caused many wagons laden with dead bodies to bee brought thither
in this maner then the
of may ioyned in part the first troupe that came from vtright to the campe of baldez at leyerthorpe the rest passing the linkes went to hay
the thirde troupe also passing the twentie seuen of may by northwyke arryued before the great fort which was not fully finished but the fiue co~panies of ye englishmen had forsaken it before they sawe the enemie although they had the night before requyred the leydens of certaine horsemen to discouer the enemie whome as they saide they had not as yet perceiued and seene albeit they had drawne themselues neere to waddyng where the spaniarde pressing harde vppon them gaue them the skirmishe whiche skirmishe the citizens saw as they stood vpon the rampares and besides they neuer saw either on the side or yet on the other any man fall downe dead although they had beaten one another with shot along time together which dealing the citizens greatly suspected

when this false skirmish was finished the englishe men approched neerer the towne to wit betweene the citizens trenche that ranne betweene boshouse bridge and the towne so that the captaine and certaine with him came into ye towne making this contract with the citizens that when the saide captaine shoulde see himselfe and his put to the worse by the spaniardes that they should then retyre vnder hay gate where the greatest parte of the great ordenance was planted but

so soone as they shoulde see the ensigne taken from the gate that both he and his shoulde drawe towardes the side for then they meant to discharge all the great ordenance vppon the enemie

but time shewed that this conclusion no whit liked the english men
for they were no sooner out of the towne but that they marched towards the enemie with ensigne displaide where they were vpon a certaine condition reuerently receiued
howebeit an harder matter befell them immediatly after for they had not beene there very long but that they were commanded to put out theyr matches and the horsemen that came from forscote drane them before in chase vpon the spaniardes whiche thing certaine of them to the number of thyrtie two or thirtie and three seeing amongest whome were certaine officers both englishe flemish retyred themselues againe vnder the towne who not long after got into it
the rest were had to falkebrough where theyr armour and weapon were taken from them before torenfleete house and the next morowe being vncased of their gallant apparrell were carried to harlem where som of them were put to be pyoners and some of them passing through flanders returned into england
but heere am not to forget one thing that some of these souldiers which coulde not tell by what meanes to get into the towne chose rather to leape from the scluse into the water and so drowne themselues then so vilanously fall into the handes of the enemie
by this meane then was the towne of leyden in foure or fiue quarters besieged and the enemie had built round about it sixtie and two fortes
when leyden was nowe in this estate the citizens had foorth with aducrtised his excellencie lying at dordright of the matter
howbeit the prince hauing aduertisement heereof before theyr letters came to his handes sate in councell with the deputies of the estates of hollande which were there present and so the
of may wrote to the leydens as followeth

his excellencie hauing delibered with the estates aforesaid thought it most expedient that colonnell chester who was

at falk brough with
souldiers or there about shoulde if it were possible enter into leyden which by that meane mighte take away all hope occasion either of the besieging or assayling of it any longer

ouer and besides that the magistrate shoulde cause all the beggers and impotent persons to depart the towne which might rather trouble then ayde them in theyr distresse

and besides to take such order for the sparing deliuerie of their victualles as that they might serue them for
exhorting them of himselfe that they would valiantly behaue themselues as hee fully and wholy trusted they woulde and in the meane whyle that his excellencie and the estates woulde not forget to seeke by all meanes possible theyr ayde and deliuerance from the enemie

and although yt this could not so soone be brought to passe as they wished yet not to be thereby discouraged but rather constantly persist in a short trouble and distresse then yeeld themselues to an euerlasting thraldome and misery
and to that ende hee would haue them consult and take aduise together discreetely and wisely weighing if they could in so needfull a case to withstand the time of the saide three monethes for feare of falling into the mischiefe and miserie of the harlemians and if so be they were able to withstand the said three monethes that then they should giue two nights ensuing at midnight a signe with fire to the ende the answere might not come to the enemies hands

the day before that they receiued this answere the leydens had alreadie made proclamation that all the women chyldren and strangers passengers should get them out of the town
and butter mylke flesh bread such like necessary thinges were set at a reasonable price
the brewers also were forbidden to brewe any beere aboue twenty and fiue souls ye barrel which thing alas was euill obserued
the
of may they answered the said letters much like as followeth that as for colonell chester and his souldiers

that the matter stood in another state as they had written to his excellencie in their former letters which were intercepted

and as for their victuals there shoulde bee no fault in them but that they would stretch them out to the vttermost neither would they suffer any vnprofitable person consume them if it were possible for them to doe it
howbeit that they were not able to abide to tarrie so long notwithstanding that they would write to him hereof more at large in the meane while repose all their trust and confidence for their deliuerance in the assistance of god his excellencie and their fellow brethren confederates
in that they would not giue any tokens with fire was because the enemie should not thereby any way suspect their extreeme necessity and so the rather more strictly inclose them thereby stop those wayes which are now free and at libertie for their messengers to passe
and besides they sent for pouder and wrote that they were reasonably well determined to keepe the towne and therefore would put their citizens in pay

they sent also vnto his excellencie the copie of certaine letters which the enemie had written vnto them by which they vnderstood that the enemie had small hope of going forward in forcible maner
last of all they most humbly besought his excellencie to haue a fatherly care of them as their trust was in him and hasten their deliuerance but yet not so as that the ouer hast therein might breake the necke thereof

the prince of orange being greatly troubled for the town of leyden because it was vnfurnished of souldiers and by reason also that it was not according to his commandement sufficiently purueyed for of corn other warlike munitions fearing likewise that his letters of the
were by the enemie intercepted wrote vnto them ye
another to ye same effect with this addition

that if they well considered of the strength of their towne although that the euglishmen were not with them yet that they might very well keepe out the enemie for
monethes for if they were of one mind consent it was impossible for the enemie to take them perforce

moreouer they were well to weigh and consider that if so bee they did not all that was possible for men to doe that they should not only loose theyr towne of leyden but also all the whole countrie besides whiche should bee to them and their successors amost cursed and shamefull reproch for euer

and therefore that they were lustily to hold out the enemy and so be the cause of not onely preseruing themselues but of the whole countrie also and get themselues thereby an euerlasting famous name
and for the better effecting of this matter sparily to spend their victuals after the example of the harlemians and middlebroughians
nowe followeth the answere to these letters written the first of iune although their corne would not stretch so farre as the time mentioned in those letters yet they hoped lustily to holde out the force of the enemie during the time aforesaide yea they were fully resolued rather to abyde the extremitie of famine then to become their enemies slaues
in the meane whyle they required that the delftians roterodamians and goudians might be forbidden to suffer any victuals passe out of any of them by lande because the enemie should therby be greatly weakened
protesting against them that if they otherwise did yt they more sought their owne priuate gain then ye endomaging of those who went about none other thing but the turning away of the enemie from their gates

and nowe let vs againe returne to frauncis baldez his enterprises
so soone as baldez had in this maner without anie great ordenance be sieged the towne of leyden for hee right well knewe the merueilous charge of that which was planted before harlem and withall the small effect it wrought he therfore knowing that it woulde lesse auaile against this towne whiche was so notably strengthned with mightie strong rampares bethought him either by sugred speeches cunning letters or seuere threates to subdue it and for so much as hee had many fugitiue hollanders with him whoe were at his beeke and commandement and at that time called in the hollanders language glippers he entended to imploy them about these affaires and it may bee yt it was their owne sute and request seeing there were some of them too too carelesse for the losse and libertie of their countrie and therefore thought by theyr sundrie letters written from diuers places to the leydens to draw them to the call and so deceiue them some of which said letters shalbe here set downe at large as they were written and the briefe contents onely of othersome

and firste and formost iohn adryanson the wylde and ewout arent the sonne of gerard sente the twentie eyght of maye from harlem to the magistrate and whole body of the towne the letters hereafter following signed with their hands but not al written by the which made the matter greatly to be suspected that the letters were no parte of their inuention

my maysters the great and singular affection and loue which we haue vnto our countrie accompanyed with an horryble terrour and heart breake

haue beene the cause to let you vnderstand that wee foreseeing you my maysters to be in great hazarde to fall into extreame calamitie and miserie if you in minde persist to defende the towne of leyden against his maiesties will and honour our most gentle lorde and naturall prince seeing we are more then informed of the innumerable numbers of men of warre already assembled and doe yet still assemble both on foote and on horsebacke with purpose to come downe into our poore and desolate countrie of holland some of which are already on the way and are dayly still comming on and chiefly to set vpon you my maisters and to turne you cleane out of your dores ouer and besides a great number of spanish shipps dayly approching which are prepared and furnished for the same effect
wherefore my maysters we hartely beseech you to haue a very good and discrete regard vnto this matter and looke throughly vnto it that you be not ouer long in deliberating hereon least by your obstinate purpose and intent all good meanes be altogether cut off and taken from you

for you my maisters knowe well enough the meaning and purpose of souldiers who onely are enclined to sacke and spoyle for their particular profit beseeching you likwise to haue regarde to your poore wiues and children your miserable olde fathers and kinsfolkes who are no way able to helpe and relieue you and be not the cause of suffering that to be lost and euill dealt withal which ought so much to be had in honour with you and amongst the rest the little wealth and substaunce which yet remayneth through the insupportable exactions by

you my maysters as it were for the space of two yeares vpholden which wee daye and night see before our eyes
for this cause we in the beholding of you are enbolvened to exhibite a certeine supplicatio to monsier de liques gouernour of harlem a very curteous ciuill and discrete noble gentleman and borne within his maiesties lowe countries where al his welth lyeth who is wonderfully enclined to vnitie peace and tranquilitie who hath answered vs that if you your selues would become sory and repentant and so submit you vnto his maiestie that he knoweth such a way for the sauing both of your bodyes and goodes as you your selues cannot wish a better alwayes prouided that this submission be made before such time as you be more straightly couped vp by his maiesties garrisons

and for this cause my maisters hee hath inioyned vs to aduertise you that the lordes of the towne might deuise to set downe certaine pointes and articles with such conditions as you would craue your pardon extending the same no farther then to you should seeme most expedient and to sende the same ouer with all possible speede vnto the sayde lorde de liques who will procure you a fauourable answere and giue you good direction to the great commaundator of eastile now gouernour for his maiestie of all his low countries
for we know not better howe to counsell you then to be directed by him who likewise made the league at mons in haynault which in euery condition was fully and wholly obserued according to the promises and which we also trust that you wil more firmely keepe
beseeching the lord god that it would please him so to inspire you with his holy spirit as that at last you hauing by it a right iudgement be not caryed away with an obstinate and froward constancie to refuse that good occasion which presently is offered you for your so great aduauntage

the
of may gerard of hooghstrate wrote two letters from leyerthorpe

the one to the leydens which was vnsealed and without superscription and the other of the same effect to his cosin gerard iohnso
it is insinued to ye burroughmaysters that by the ordenaunce of the captaines which were

at leyerthorp namely le drossat of wedd and gerard of sichem aduertised them of the singular grace and fauour which should be graunted to the leydens if so be they woulde in any reasonable order submit them selues vnto his maiestie and that they should haue a gratious and commendable pardon
wherefore if they were so minded that they might send their deputies and for the suertie of their persons they offer the sayd captayne and drostat to hee their ostages or pledges and to come to the towne vntill such time as they had conferred with frauncys baldez generall of the campe who then laye at haye

the townesmen after the romayne and grecian manner brieflye aunswered these letters in this one verse following
fistuladulce canit volucrem dum decipit auceps that is to say the fowler with the sweete call of his pipe beguileth the bird and driueth him into his net

the sayde hooghstrate wrote another letter the same day vnto his cosin aduertising him that he feared that his firste letter which he sent by a mayde seruaunt neuer came to his handes seeing he had receyued a letter to mayster gerard of hooghstrate but nothing was written in it saue fistula dulce canit without any subscribing which caused him to write another letter to put him in minde of the contents of the firste aduertising him that it would turne neither to a fable nor yet to any merrye iest if the leydens contemned his maiesties pardonne greatlye threatning the townesmen besides with the great preparation and furniture nowe already in hand and yet still in preparing and furnishing for the chastising of obstinate rebels with many such other like reasons

the
day aforesaid iohn le hutter wrote a letter fro hay to the burroughmaisters of leiden as it were to ye same effect ye hooghstrate his letter was
he wrote that some of his maiesties men of war were returned againe into the countrie to the end to ease and deliuer the paysauntes of the great charges and exactions which were layde vpon them and also of the leydens to offer them a general pardon aswel for the offences co~mitted

in the yeare
as at this present and certified as he which hath seene the precinctes of the exceptions that no person within leyden is excepted in the sayde pardon because they had about a month sithence refused to take in the princes men of war saue onely now about two daies past

and therfore he aduised them to accept of his maiesties grace while it is time to the ende they fell not through the force of the camp which was at hand into extreame miserie and calamitie
and that seigniour baldez would make intercession for them by his letters vnto the great commaundator that they might euen with the first commers haue their parden and therefore if they minded to accept thereof that they shoulde send their deputies to parle of the matter
for so soone as they had gotten their pardon they should then be charged but with a small garrison of almaines promising them all ayd assistance for the doing hereof
the same daye also wrote iohn gautier of wybesma to the leydens vehemently vrging the matter in the beginning of his letters and greatly commending their fidelitic in that they had not receyued in any of the princes garrisons supposing that the same would greatly auaile them and was a singular seruice for his maiestin

he also set before them as the rest did the general pardon and that it was not the kinges pleasure that there should be any effusion of bloud within his cities and townes
counselling them to keepe their gates fast locked as well against his maiesties people as also against the princes vntill such time as they had obteined their request and gotten it signed with the kinges owne hand promising them in the meane while to lye quietlye and still without doing any hurt to their towne and that they would giue commaundement that all their cattell should freely feede in their medowes and pastures
offering them to come in person to leyden and hazarde with them both theyr bodyes and goodes promising besides that for seauen yeares space no not whiles he lyued they should haue any garrison in the towne for he know what the expresse charge was which he had from his maiestie

deale not saieth hee with anye manne and let none enter vntyll such tyme as my selfe haue talked with you and write vnto mee an aunsweare heereof and let euery of vs be loyall and faithfull

my intent and purpose was here to set downe the hyspaniolized hollanders letters thereby to she we the constancy of the good citizens who notwithstanding this sweete and sugred writing and cruell threates calling to minde the confederacye which they had made with an othe remaining firme and consta~t made these letters profitable vnto them
let these letters and citizens therefore be an example to all the rest of the cities and townes which hereafter may be besieged that in this or the like occasion they become stedfast and constaunt and keepe their faith and promise with their fellow countrie men
after that the papistes aforesaid had been in councell at zoeterwood and had there as in other places inforced the paysants to lade theyr boates and barkes with earthen cloddes seeing what small effect their letters had wrought but onely discouered thereby their owne intent and purpose and encouraged the citizens they so straitly hemmed in and couped vp the citie with their trenches and forts at poele bridge and harlem mere bridge as that from thence foorth nothing could be carryed to the town but in marueilous danger which before might easily haue been done in this maner the goudeans attempted this enterprise the
of iune
certaine citizens who by the sodaine besieging of the towne wild they nild they were shut out of leyden had laden by his excellencies lycence and the assistance of the gouernour and burroughmaisters of goude
barkes with wheat and rye
by reason that two paysaunts and a marshall had bragged that they would guyde them in a secrete way through coppiereka which they had cut through and after got into the barks to conduct them to leyden

nowe the barques being well furnished with water men and hauing also in euery of them two souldiers sayled by nyght to the sayd coppiereka which they found to be very deepe cut howbeit the paysaunt which should haue beene their pylot was not there wherefore they sayled on and where they should haue

taken the left hande way they tooke the right sayling still a wronge course vntill such time as the day beganne to breake and they thought the paysant had betrayed them who indeed by reason of the greate payne that hee had taken was fallen a sleepe behinde in the way
wherefore they returned backe to gaude without executing of this enterprise

when the leydens heard of this enterprise they tooke al the paynes that was possible to receiue them for they attended the saide barques on the rhin with certayne freebutters or rather desperate aduenturers boates but all in vayne for this matter and yet their goyng out was not altogether in vayne for they tooke by force neere vnto haynault bridge two wasters and speedily dispatched those that were within them
when they had thus done they vnladed these shippes of all the prouision and furniture that was within borde as artillary munition victualles bread beare silkes veluets parchment lace of gold siluer and silke fifteene peeces of ordinances called bases three barrelles of corne pouder and a very great number of bullets and fraught their owne boates with them
afterwarde they bouged one of the enemies vessels and sounke her and set fire on the other returning in the morning with their prize to the towne
the spanyardes who encamped at leyerthorpe made their account to stay these boates with all the whole prize within them at the wood bridge but the citizens beyng in armour looking for the comming of their boates with the victualles aforesayd very couragiously salyed out of hoogweert gate and gaue the alarme to leyerthorpe forte and skirmished so lustely with their enemies as that the boates and the prize passed by and besides they afterwards for the defence of the cattell which the enemy went about to carrye away so skirmished with them as that they returned all together with the sayd butyn without losse of any of the towne cattell hauing taken prisoner amongest those shippes one peter quaegelate an horrible traytor to his countrey whom they foorthwith executed and quartered and set vp his quarters vpon the citie gates which thing the leydens signified by their letters to his excellency dated the
of inne

the citizens dayly exercised them selues more and more to the skirmishes aswell the youngest sorte

as also the auncientes but amongest the rest there was a proper young youth of the age of sixteene yeares named lyon and in courage and valure a lyon in deede for at the first siege of leyden hee behaued him self not as a younge youth but like a lyon against the enemie and that to their cost

this young lyon was afterwarde in a skirmish and laying him selfe downe vpon the grasse the spaniards tooke him and hauing cut off his nose and eares they hoong him vp by the toes but being a very hable and strong man hee layed handes on the haulter and imped vp to the toppe of the gallowes wher the enemy slew him with harquebuze shot
from this lyon such an other which was taken with him the sayde baldez wronge much matter as touching the affayres and state of the towne
maister thierry of bronchorst his excellencies substitute at leyden and being now made gouernour thereof the magistrate and nobilitie considering that the siege might last long and thereby turne to a distresse of famine during this moneth of iune made all the necessariest ordenaunce that possibly they could aswell for the long sauing of their victualles as also for the fortifiyng of their rampars and gates the better and longer to keepe their towne
and when an was taken of all the come within the towne there was found to be
busshels
ther were also then in the towne persons
wherfore there was appoynted to euery one for the first two moneths halfe a pound of bread which oftentimes would scarsly suffice some tauellers to breakfast
and therfore the gentle reader may easily ghesse vpon what kinde of victuals they fed most
there was also an ordenaunce set down for pot hearbes and no milke to be solde whereon butter might be made

whiles the towne of leyden was in this sorte besieged and yt the townsmen were altogether occupyed about making of prouision of al things necessary for the defence thereof the principall parte of the sayde commaundators armye arryued

in the quarters of bommel gorcum and louuestein
howbeit the prince ye estates made no great reckoning thereof
for at bommell which was well prouided of all things necessary was captaine baufour colonell of the scettishmen with seauen ensignes of scottes who dayly salied out with some citizens and gentlemen hollanders to skirmishe brauly with the enemie and besides the sufficient garryson that was at gorcum and louuestein there was alwayes meanes to and delyuer the towne of gorcum as afterward well appeared by the cutting and pearsing of the dikes

the spaniard afterward determined to goe against worcum where lay in garrison fiue companies of the prince to trouble and annoy the spaniardes as much as was possible that came from antwarpe where by constraint and force they made the citizens pay them foure hundred thousande
florins besides the common dammage which they there presentlye susteyned about their costs and charges

this little village was shrewdly beaten with artillery but because the prince of orenge would not cast away his men about the defence of so ruinous a place

and standing onely vpon fiue familyes or housholdes he therfore commaunded the which were in it to forsake it and so they did howbeit they could not so well nor so speedily enbarque them selues but that they lefte aboue persons behind them

when the spanyardes the
of iune beganne to buyld their forte and trench themselues neere lammen which is about a quarter of a myle from leyden standing vpon a passage of waters which flowe ouer towards delft zoeterwood and leyerthorpe the leydens hauing intelligence thereof and considering what mischiefe and domage might ensue to them therby haled out the
of the saide moneth sixe smal vessels to lette their fortifying and entrenching
but when they were come neere to lammen the enemie so lustely charged them as that notwithstanding their merueilous defence they were to retyre and returne backe to the towne neither could they so speedely doe it but that they were fayne to leaue foure of the hyndermost vesselles behynde them by reason that the nose of one of them so touched vpon the shore of the ryuer as

that she was not able well to turne her selfe about and therefore they forsooke them and saued all her people in the rest of the vessels except foure or fiue
the
of the saide moneth the leydens had giuen the prince to vnderstande hereof and wroate that if it so fell out as that the enemy went about to trouble their co~ming with their boats which they hoped they would not yet that commandeme~t was giuen to them of woerden ouldwater and the rest to be still molesting of harlem mere in the meane while they for their parts wold indeed according to their bounden duties shew their great zeale affection and continuall trauell towardes the benefiting of the common weale of theyr countrey

and on the other side the enemy slept not but still went on with all the cunning and slight meanes that possibly coulde bee deuised to ouercharge and winne them so that some of the hyspaniolized aforesaid who lay in the campe of the enemy thought that the first letters which were written to the leydens for the stirring of them vp to the wyning of them were not sufficiently nor effectually inough penned or it may be they thought that the time by reason of the straite siege gaue some moe fit occasions whereby the enterprise aforesaide tooke none effecte
wherefore because they woulde doe their best they wrote agayne the
of iune to the leydens without anye subscription for that it may bee they doubted they should receiue the like answere yt was sent to hooghstrate the content whereof was this

for so much as wee and all others whatsoeuer that consider of the estate wherein the towne of leyden and all the inhabitauntes thereof presently stande adding therewith all the desolation and misery which is like to light vpon you aboue all the rest if you doe not the sooner accept of the grace that hath beene so often tymes offered and faithfully promised you it greatly lamenteth and maruellously amazeth vs vppon what hope and by what meanes you possibly canne longer deteine and holde your selues and all your fellowe citizens your wiues and children in suche miserye and anguishe of mynde as nowe presently you are in beeyng on cuerie side enuironed and besieged and bereaued of all conference amongest men

euill prouided of victuals and in a great deale lesse hope to receiue from abroade any helpe to relieue you in the tyme of the siege whiche in truth shal not bee raysed no not if it should lie here these two yeeres space before such time as you haue yeelded your selues or shalbee dryuen by verie force which god forbid shortly to bee brought vnder the obedience of the king of spayne your naturall liege lorde
wherefore we coulde not but of very pitie and loue albeit to our knowledge wee haue neuer a kinsman within your towne to exhorte you all very aduisedly and considerately to determyne vppon your affayres and weigh what a notable contentation of mynde it is to haue such occasion to be offered as to be absolutely receiued into grace and fauour which is not onlie offered presently to some but generally to all of what estate or condition soeuer they be which grace ere it be long so it may fall out as god forbidde it should you shall neuer be able once come neere vnto
for if you would well and wisely consider of the whole matter first you your selues are in disgrace with the prince of orange and next the other rebellious townes of his maiesties seeing themselues by your meanes bereaued of foure ensignes of englishmen who beeing shut out of your towne rendered them selues vnto his maiesties mercy and deuotion so that you therefore are now litle to hope for the least succour and ayde that may be from those foresayd townes
and although they haue the will and mynde to helpe you yet you may easily consider of the small wayes that they haue to doe it withall seeing they had as you might if you woulde vnderstand great busines to doe for the men of warre which now are in their seruice as at gorcum which presently is besieged with a greater army then you are besieged withall and against his maiesties puissaunt army whiche commeth out of spayne
againe ouer and besides the losse of count lodwyke his people amongest which there was no man more forwarde yet were they so lustely curried neere nimmeguen as that in a short time they lost seuenteene ensignes of the brauest souldiers in their companie to wit the
ensignes which were discomfited at alphen the aforesaide foure which yeelded themselues in your sight and the other seuen which the last fridaye

at worchum forte were miserablye cooled euen to the last man

moreouer if you shal consider of the meanes which haue serued your turnes to this present for the maintena~ce of the warre as chalices pixes and capitall impositions which doe nowe greatly faile you so that you now haue not any moe such or the like things to helpe your selues with and againe the daylie contributions are for the more part taken from you by reason that the whole countrey is taken vp

ouer and besides the great power and force of his maiestie our most gracious lord and naturall prince

who would rather pawne one of his kingdomes were it naples sicile sardigne or anye other such like then suffer him selfe to bee spoyled of these· countries his most auncient patrimonie and inheritaunce
what steppe or meane canne you anye way haue to perseuere in your great errours and anguishes wherein you are so wrapped and swadled with the great danger of the mischiefe whiche is like to fall on your heades
and therefore were it not better for you to conforme and frame your selues vnto his maiesties will and pleasure and in time and season accepte this his grace whiche as yet is generally offered vnto you all nowe if anye of you woulde saye that there woulde bee no promise kepte the same is but a friuolous and sinister imagination of some of you who in these troubles canne helpe your selues by other mennes losses

for what greater assuraunce more is it possible for you to haue then suche an assuraunce as we haue vnderstoode from the mouth of monsieur de licques hee hath so assuredlye offered you who beeyng a gentleman of the best and auncientest houses of these lowe countreyes and of great possessions woulde not promise you as you maye verie well thinke anye thing whereof hee were not well assured firmelie to bee able to perfourme vnto you seeing his credite is as great in court as anie mans as you may very well vnderstand by the english souldiers who yeelded them selues vnto him before your towne all which at his intercession were very

well dealt withall and in good sort sent into england
wherfore addresse your selues vnto him rather then to any other straunger and the sooner the better for we are certainly aduertised that he shall shortly depart hence to bee imployed about greater affayres of his maiesties
and we haue vnderstoode from his owne mouth that he beeyng mooned with pitie and loue had thought to haue written againe vnto you if so bee you had but briefly answered his former letters

wherefore if you meane to imploye him about this businesse

it standeth you in hand without delay to aduertise vs hereof and when we vnderstand your mindes herein we assure you to send you shortly the saide monsieur de licques letters with all good assuraunce and offer and therefore looke you not for the copie of the pardon proclaymed at bruxelles the
of this moneth for euery of you in particular shall out of all doubte obtaine better conditions howe haynous so euer the offence bee if you will not stande to the aforesayd pardon although indeede it bee verie large
and therefore eschue you the greate plague and distresse that is neere you and if you haue not compassion of your selues yee at least haue pittie of your fellowe citizens which are many in number
suffer not your selues to be abused by fables and trifling toyes neither be you carryed away with a wanhope as it is very apparaunt that you are and heartened and comforted thereto by some
for as we vnderstand there are certayne whiche daylie crie out on you at your gates say where is your king meaning thereby the french king who died about whitsontide last from whom you shal haue but smal weake aide seeing that in fra~ce ye troubles are now greater the in the low countries
howbeit if the french were comming to helpe you assure your selues that they should finde some in the way that would talke with them as they did who came with count lodwike duke christopher the sonne of the count palatine who through the helpe of god were as well cooled as the almaynes
for our king hath already aboue
ensignes of souldiers besides his horsemen where can you find so great an armie to encou~ter it wherfore see that you consider deeply weigh of the matter and send vs hereupon some answere because we haue zealously louingly written

thus much vnto you
and so for the present commit you to god beseeching him so to mollifie your hearts enlighten you with his grace as that it may be for the preseruation of you all
from his maiesties campe before leyden the
of iune
and subscribed as followeth

by three credible and honest menne whose names you may not yet knowe

the sayd matenes of wybesma wrote also from the port of poele the
of iune to the leydens greatly commending the pardon which was proclaymed the sixte of iune at bruxelles whom they as yet liked but not alwayes
for he made no litle to doe of the force trenches and fortes of his campe and he so set downe all his fortes with the names of a dozen of them as that he thought it impossible for the towne to be victualed
he likewise offered free passage to the most trayeerous rebels to his matesty that would come out
and besides he further offered that if they feared to be deceiued as the duke of alua deceiued them to put him selfe and others into the towne for ostages and there remayne vntil such time as they which went out were not onely embarqued at catwye but also vntill some of them beeyng safely arryued had written newes thereof and thereuppon might drawe the articles of agreement
when the prince vnderstood the content of these letters he wrote the
of this moneth from roterodam to leyden and amongst other things greatly thanked them for their constaney admonishing the not to feare those men who shamed to subscribe their names besides confuted the iangling toyes of the first letter told them that the nemy had maliciously concealed ye losse of their shippes but especially the losse of the
souldiers in north holland

monsieur de licques and his fautors from whom it was thought the first letters came or it may bee that baldez and his friends seeing that these letters and the letters from wibesma tooke as little effect as the first sought by all meanes possible

to ouercharge the citizens and recompence their vertue and constancie with as wicked dealing as was possible for men to doe wherefore they considering in what great steede their garden herbes stoode them because they had plentifully sowen of them in the month of may which was their chiefe food and reliefe built a fort betweene the

of iuly neere to rhinbrough gate at the very entrance or mouth of the riuer to barre the citizens from comming out of the gate to goe to their kitchin gardens

neuerthelesse the aforesaide thierry de bronchorst who during the siege had valiantly behaued himselfe vnto the death had by the aduise of the magistrate ordeined a certayne rewarde for whatsoeuer citizen shoulde first set foote into the sayd fort
wherefore a great number of them salied out at the gate at once and so lustely charged the enemy as that they were enforred with great losse and shame inough to forsake the place the
of iuly
when the great commandator his adherents saw yt a great number of their enterprises tooke no effect that the townes in holland and zelande and els where were so well prouided for as that they could doe little or nothing that su~mer they put their whole confidence in the great armie at sea which came out of spayne the fame whereof more and more so spread abroad as that it might indeede haue so fallen out had not the lorde god by his secret iudgements as wel by the pestilence as otherwise prouided well for the matter

but to the end some diligence in the performing hereof might appeare as wel at rome by the pope his cardinals as also in spayne by the fathers of the holy inquisition by their actes prowesses and that the aforesayde holy fathers might see wheruppon theyr money was bestowed chiapin vitelli about this time had with fifteene ensignes of swysses and other ensignes of besides twelue peeces of great ordinaunce besieged lerdam

a little towne belonging to the count of bure which was continually battered from
of the clocke in the morning vntill one of the clocke in the afternoone especially the castle flanker whiche was vtterly beaten to the grounde
and about noone they came to a parle wherein they demaunded

the towne bodies and goodes reserued
and that the
companies of the princes people which laye there in garnyson shoulde depart thence with their armonr and weapon whiche in the end was agreed vpon and performed in the beginning of iuly

the
of iuly the leydens coyned certaine peeces of siluer of

souls a peece
and on ye one side was sta~ped as it is printed in ye paper coyne which was coyned at the first coyning
haec libertatis ergo on the other side godt behoedt leyden nu~mus obsessae vrbis lugdunensis sub gubernatione illustris simi principis auriaci cusus
and vpon the little penny lugdunum batauorum
the
of the said moneth proclamatio was made yt no beare should be made aboue
souls the barrell
in this meane while was leyden very straightly besieged but especially about haye gate where one captaine carion a spaniard had entre~ched him selfe at ye waddinghe made many loope holes to shoot through in the dikes his first tre~ch ran alongest hard to boshuyse whiche greatly anoied the towne
wherefore the citizens because they had no souldiers concluded to salie out in this manner

first gerard lane went out in a gally well purueied of artillary and the greater part of his citizens were musketters
maister iohn duuenword captaine of ye aduenturers or freebutters issued out by the fleet the one halfe of his people being appoynted with long staues called sprittes and the other halfe shot
and adrian scot went out at the rinbrough gate
the two companies of maister iohn does lorde of northwike with bartholomew hauies tooke in hand to see vppon the fort and trench at boshouse bridge
at the place called the sand were placed a good manie of pyoners
now when all thinges were thus prepared and set in order and a rewarde set downe for the first that entred ye fort for euery spaniards head so soone as the fire was lighted they all at once with a great noyse and crie on euery side set vpon the fort especially the companies of the lorde of northwike and of bartholomew hauies
the
spaniards which were in the fort valiauntly defended them seues with their muskettes but ye townes men were gotten so neere the fort as that they pushed at them

in the fort with their foresayd long staues so soone as they had discharged theyr harquebuzes

they fel vpo ye enimie
in ye meane while the citizens approched with their fire works to wit with vials of glasse full of gunpouder brimstone hauing lighted matches hanging without them and cast those vials into ye fort of the enemy whereupon the spaniardes were enforced to forsake their trench or fort where the citizens entred there slew their enemies who in ye destroying of the fort were rosted there aliue and buried by the citizens without hauing mercy vppon anye although they very lamentably cryed vpon them misericordia misericordia
and the pioners aforesayd were so busie against the enemy at a trench neere poeley bridge as that they came not time enough to lay flat the forte and therefore the citizens themselues did it

during these exploites by reason of the signe of the fire aforesayde alarme was sounded through all baldez his campe insomuch that they of lammen came to helpe the of wadding so did like wise the horsemen of leyerthorpe forscote wassenar who with a few of those which scaped gaue three assaults vpon the lost forte but they were with shame and losse inough lustely repulsed
now because the citizens meant not to keepe the saide fort but raze it if it were possible and to shewe that although there were no souldiers in the towne yet that necessity daylie experience made a souldier being also of necessity driuen to retyre by reason of the force of the enemy which came vppon them they after this braue skyrmish of two houres retyred them felues towards the towne
thus the
of iuly they made ready hande speedy dispatch of an hundred spaniards italians or neere thereabout

it were ouer long to write of the continuall skyrmishing that was there

both on the

of iuly by reaso of the multitude of the kine that went thereabout beyng very neere to the number of
for the citizens were growen now so warrelike and forward in skirmishing as that the magistrate was inforced to call them from it with the sound of a bell
and here is to be vnderstood that none of baldez campe euer tooke the value of one towe but that it cost the liues of some of his souldiers especially before ye trench without ye wood gate because they we~t

ouer planchers where they were cut off from the way so yt the
of august there were in ye place
spaniards staine
taken prisoners there was not taken from them during the whole siege but
cow
young calues
and it was a maruellous thing to see how this kynd of cattel had the wyt to saue themselues vnder the towne in the time of necessitie for by vse they had learned to know the shooting both of the harquebouze and also of the great ordinaunce

during these exploites

baldez people which lay at haye and therabout atte~pted the towne of delft which they thought to obteine by reason of certaine intelligence conference yt they had with some of ye town but they were therein deceiued because yt these inhabitants faithfully dealt in ye matter in aduertising ye magistrate therof
so yt a ba~ket of gu~pouder was prepared for ye spantard for if they had once entred the gate they had euer after beene excused for the eating of victualles
but as the keies of the gate were not so ready at hand as they ought to haue byn besides the draw bridge was so long before it could be let downe which might be by reaso of the feare yt tooke some of them who had commission to do it as yt the spaniards we~tbacke being terrified by the great ordinance of the towne but it came too late for there was no hurt at al done

neuerthelesse notwithstanding al these enterprises atte~pts and besides the great distresse of the leydens yet was it not long before but that there began a treatye of peace and for the same intent and purpose were first sent to vtright although vnder another colour maister iohn matenes lorde of the riuer and the aduocate or counseller at the lawe trelon and after that maister philip of marnisse seignior de saint aldegond who came out of prison by the consent of maister champigni but because this matter is already set downe in print wil send the gentle reader thereto if he meane to vnderstand any further thereof

after a fewe dayes had been spent in this warhope of peace that the deputies both of holland and zelande with seignior saint aldegond who according to his othe became prisoner againe had exhibited their request vnto his maiesite in waye of a supplication conteyning these two poyntes that if

the lowe countries might be rydde of the straungers which were in them then the estates of holland and zeland and their adherents would submit themselues to the general estates besides seeing that the other deputies were gone back to vtright that the siege of leyden continued their victuals went very low therfore his excelle~cy ye estates discretely wisely weighed co~sidered which way leyden might be most commodiously holpe
neuertheles whe they saw yt there could come no ayde by la~d but wt great hazard by reaso of ye strait besieging stre~gth of so many tre~ches or bulwarks the multitude of the enemies without the hazarding of a great number of people forsomuch as the greatest part of al the cha~pion countries was destroyed the enemies of the hollanders to possesse ye cou~tries least annoyed and besides yt a great deale of corne hay by reason of the edict published in iuly was had into the townes of the princes part his excelle~cy ye estates fully wholly agreed not so much to esteem what might become of ye rawnesse of the low countrie lay it wast for the deliuering of those that lay oppressed in leiden to declare vnto the enemy what power and will they had to wit that they had rather ouerwhelm the whole countrey with water

and beare the losse as it is thought of
crownes of the soune then suffer their fellow brethren members of one publike weale to be trode vnder foote and depriued of the libertie of their countrey
and therfore say it was concluded vpon and declared by a common accord that better is a waste then an vtterly lost countrey and so agreed that the scluses should be taken vp that all south holland if it were possibly might bee laide vnder the water both by the laying open of these scluses as also by the cutting of the dykes which stand eyther vpon the maze or vpon yssele procuring by this meane a sea to ebbe and flowe vppon the firme lande that they might after the water was become once nauigable sayle to leyden for the victualling and ayding thereof
and to bring this matter to passe were deputed william de palestine and daniel de wingard who hauing ful commission for the executing hereof departed forthwith from roterodam with a great number of pyoners

the
and
of august his excellencie and paule bushe an aduocate of the countrey of holland accompanied with certayne

of the estates went vpon the chappel dyke of yssele wheron stood a fort very wel furnished with souldiers cutting downe of the bank in about
places so that the formost gate was answerable vnto issilmond
and betweene roterodam and delfshauen was likewise a great deepe gate cut through which ran woonderful aboundance of water
the scluses at roterodam scledam the
scluses were altogether pulled vp so that roterodam scluse yeelded maruellous store of water

whe these dyke banks were cut downe

ye scluse laid wyde open his excelle~cy sent into zeland for admyrall lewis boysot and after he had deliberated and consulted with the estates and throughly considered of all the meanes that might be as in what maner with what number of people with what ships artillary leyden might be soonest ayded and rydde of the enemy he departed towards zeland for the doing hereof
and in the meane while there were certain flat bottommed vessels many gallies also made ready for that seruice

during these exploytes baldez hauing encompassed leyde with his souldiers gaue not ouer the practising of his subtil and threatning exhortations as wel by words as also by this letter written the
of iuly from haye the briefe content whereof hereafter ensueth

that the leydens should beware not to suffer themselues to be villainously abused by friuolous and vayne wordes
and that they had also caused it to be published abroade amongst their citizens how his ma sought a kind of iniurtous seuerity desire of reuenge against them where contrariwise hee shewed all the grace and mercy that was possible as appeared by those of leyde
perso~s moe at vtright els where that this mercy gate stood as yet wide open for them if they would hartily call for the same
but if they would still perseuere in their obstinacy that then they were to looke for al disgrace punishme~t cruelty to be prese~tly laid vpo the
insomuch that ye co~clusio of this letter was as it were much like vnto rabsakeis when he ca before ye city of ierusale
harken saith he what the great king of assyria saith to wit the great commandator
take heede you be not abused and seduced by hezekia to wit by your prince of ora~ge leane not vnto a weak shaking reed which is not able to stay deliuer you neuer regard any thing yt he biddeth you doe

for the lord will send you a meane for your deliuerance neither shall your towne of leyden fall into the handes of the great commaundator
giue no eare to the prince but beleeue me that his maiesties intent and purpose is not to depart from before the towne vntill such time as he hath brought it vnder his obedtence and besides let delft also know and all the reste of the other townes yt they shalbe besieged which the delftians if they be not wilfully blind may welinough perceiue
and therfore see you trust not to the prince of oreng his ayde for if you do you shal but abuse your selues wt a vaine hope
but shew you me thus much fauour as to render your selues into my handes be you the first and you shall be sure to obtaine grace mercy

the leydens made no answere to this letter neyther were they any whit the more afeard or discouraged but according to the example of the bethulians and iohel his doctrine they fell to prayer and fasting being expresly commaunded by the magistrate not once to thinke that they deserued any thing by reason of this fast
and besides they ordeyned certeine lawes and ordinaunces and the
of august they were commaunded to take vp all their horses out of the medowes and stable them in the towne to the ende their milch kine might feede the longer abrode and at that time they began to kill the kine that were dried vp and the fift day they made ordenaunces concerning their flesh victual and graynes which they then began to bake which kind of foode although they esteemed not of it so well as of bread yet cost it more then the rye bread for a pound of it coste
holland pence and euery man was allowed halfe a pounde therof a day

the leydens standing in this estate wrote to his excellency the of august

as foloweth
that his excellency right wel vnderstood by their last letter in what state they stood that theyr graines would serue them but foure dayes longer whereupon it appeared yt they had made a verygood reckoning for
mo~ths to wit to liue ye first
month with bread the third in misery pouerty
and that ye greater sort of ye co~mo people dro~k water by reason that ye grains was baked into bread
and besides that they greatly marueiled that they neuer receiued letters from the

estates their confederates and therfore supposed that they had cleane forgotten them seeing they knew how greatly their letters would increase the weake courages of their citizens beseeching god in the end of these letters to giue them an inuincible patience and to his excellency wisedome and courage for their ayde and deliuerance

but before these letters were dispatched the leydens had receiued letters from his excellency by which he aduertised the of all that heretofore hath bin said and how hie the water was already risen wherat they greatly reioysing highly thanked his excellency signifiyng to him further which of them in their opinio~s was first to be cut let out sending these two letters the
of this moneth
now the cutting of these dykes seemed not only stra~ge to some but the deuise also was scorned

not only by the princes enemies who in diuerse places diuersly in a mockerie cryed out of it before the towne but also some of the chiefe of those which had agreed therto because they thought it an impossible thing to bring to passe besides some of the leidens thought that the water would be close pent vp against the dykes or at least be forcibly kept backe
and some who vntill then had dissimuled the matter saide in a mockery now on afore my gueses get you vp into ye top of ye tower with your lookes goe before the water of the maze with many other reprochfull words not worthy here to be set down insomuch that many cowardly mates became not only faint hearted but also by little began to breede dissention

the magistrate and the rest that were in authority seeking to preuent this inconuenience they therefore to the end to encrease the courage of their citizens especially with all possible diligence to furder their aide and deliuera~ce sent the
of august
of their citizens with
letters the one written to his excellencie and the other to the states of holland their confederates
the contents of which concerned chiefly the estates whom they but in very deed causeles charged with negligence forsomuchas they had not before the siege written vnto them one word that they lay as still as if there had bin no confederacy between the with many other thinges moe
further declaring that they had most miserably abidden distressed the whole tyme by his excellency

prefixed and that they sawe as yet none other thinge but vaine hope and therefore protested before the moste mightie god and the whole woride that they hadde done their dueties and no faulte to bee founde on their behalfe but in the estates who might see when conuenyente tune shoulde serue that they were able to excuse them selues thereof and therefore required that in case they were no waye able to helpe them or that there was no hope in the meanes alreardye begunne to sende them flatte woorde thereof that they might bee discharged of their othe and confederacie

the prince of orange at that time was visited with a maruellous daungerous disease which was not the least threate of the lord vnto his people who were very heauy and sorrowfull for the same and therefore he could by no meanes aunsweare these letters
in the meane while the leydens put in execution the ordinaunce which fortie of them had agreed vppon and made an inuentorie of all the ryne beefes sheepe calues and hogges and all the streetes houses were bylled wherein were any
there were also deputed cornelius nicholas of aix and iohn lucas of wassena commissaries as well for this matter as also for all other kinde of fleshe larde and whatsoeuer els

who according to reason and equitie were to looke to this geare to the ende that no man so long as it was possible to helpe it shoulde perishe through famine
and if any man was founde to conceale any cattell or victualles the same to bee taken from him and him selfe to bee punished
all kinde of cattell was taxed and the magistrate gaue to the owner according to the value of the taxing
and from thence foorth a lot was cast from foure dayes to foure dayes to kill as much cattell as necessarilie might serue for those aforesaide dayes to witte to euery powle halfe a pounde of fleshe the day

whiles the leydens were in this estate the water had by little and little ouerflowed al the whole countrey ouer and all preparation possible was made for the helpe and deliuerie of the towne and at roterodam arriued the admirals of flushing and siericksea to wit lewis of boysot lord of ruart

adrian williams with seuen shippes called cromsteuens well appointed both with men and great ordinaunce and
mariners
and besides they brought with them certaine other shippes which carried lesse artillary to vse in the flat bottomed boates to wit aboue an hundred of brasse yron cast peeces and a great number of double and single bases other small preces which immediatly were at roterodam with about

flat bottomed vessels wel appointed ordered after this manner
euery vessel had in her nose
peece some
peeces of brasse and
bases on a side
they had also within bourd halfe pikes mastes and some of them had
twelue fourteene sixteene eighteene ores a peece

the arriuall of these zelanders greatly feared the enemie for they are a very valia~t people by water as their notable deeds of armes sufficiently testifie
and although many of them are very sauage yet behaued they themselues good captaines most vertuously and shewed theyr great valiancy by reason they had imprinted in their mindes
thinges towit the libertie of their countrie tiranny of the spaniards and inquisitio
wherefore some of them bare about them in a siluer crescent these wordes rather the turke then a papist for they thought the tyrannie of the pope the spaniardes to be farre greater then the turkes who suffered the people paying their tribute to liue with the libertie of conscience and would as well or a great deale better keepe his promises then the pope
they were besides so much the more afeard because they receiued no ma to mercy how honourable or noble soeuer he was insomuch yt they durst in expresse words say that if they found aborde either the great commander pope emperor or the king himselfe co~ming against the as enemies to tirannize them to take from them their liues and libertie of their countrey or bring them vnder ye popes subtection they wold no more spare the then they ye basest spaniard
speake not this by the captaines but by the sauagest and most obstinate the more liuely to paint them in their colours to the end that euery man which seeth them might iudge what manner of people they were

when al the medowes about roterodam and gaude

were in ye end of august couered ouer with water so that a flat bottemmed

vessel laden with hay might passe on it and arriue at roterodam before ysselmond gate and that notwithstanding the water staied against the foresaide bankes or dykes so that it could haue no course towardes leyden the aduenturers of gaude and certayne pioners with them went out at the appointment of their gouernor wyngard and of gerard wyngard one of his excellencies counsel there assigned and cut downe the
of september hildam banke or dike
howbeit it auayled them smally because the spaniards had stopped vp the day following with hay and wood the selfe same seuen gates that they had made

now baldez and his adherents who lay before leyde did nothing els all this while but warre vpon them with the penne seeking a freshe to conquere the leydens with pleasaunt and threatning letters but especially by matenes of wibesma his letter written the
of september from his forte at poele and by two letters written in spanish and subscribed by baldez himselfe
the summe of wibisma his letter aforesayd was this that about two monethes passed he had written them letters which concerned both their profit and welfare and yet receiued no answeare from them
but because that he his adherents were aduertised yt they had no more corne left in the towne that ye people liued fed vpon rootes graines other kind of suche like soole which caused great mortality amongst them wold more more cause it if they looked not better to it besides yt theyr state condition would stil grow from ill to worse considering it was impossible for them to be holpen that the water whiche came in vpon them did them more hurt then good forsomuch as that the countrey vpon the rhyn was higher then the countrey of scye or delft so that it could not possibly be brought to passe to make the water ouerflow it

and besides yt the princes succours which were betweene

ensignes could by no meanes help because the passages were so guarded as that it was impossible for the to come to leyden
furthermore that there arriued at leyerthorpe
olde trayned souldiers all shot so that there were in that place three thousand olde spanish souldiers besides
companies of

almaines and
ensignes of walonnes and all the horeseme as many els as coulde be gotten to send thither
and yet notwithstanding all this that hath beene saide his maiesty was contented graciously to receiue the towne without exception and suffer them to enioy their auncient priuiledges neuer charge them with any garnison
and that if there were any within the towne who mistrusted the matter that safe conduct shold be giuen them to goe whither soeuer they thought best themselues
and that if anie of them woulde haue ye articles subscribed by ye great commaundor that he himselfe woulde bring them vnto them
and further that if they woulde come to a parle with him that they shoulde obtayne more then they were ware of
heereupon there were many which offered to make their peace and attonement

moreouer that they should not giue too too much credite nor trust impossible things to the end they procured not the destruction both of them selues and also of their wiues and children
lastly hee desired to bee answered vnto that which hath been said
baldez his first letter written the fourth of september from leyerthorp began with a very louing spanish salutation in maner and forme as followeth ye obstinate leydens both against god your king and lord containing summarily these points articles and manie other things me that the grace which the king offered by him to those which were obstinat and rebellious both against god and their king was yet readie for them so as they would conuerte confesse their faulte
he promiseth pardon to al aswel to the deputy bronchorst the lorde of northwike peter adrianso as to al the rest
he giueth them time to answer leysure to send their deputies with procuration vntil ye mu~day ensuing sending the to ye end a pasport written in spanish
the seconde letter written in spanishe dated the sixte of september beeganne thus my lords the burroughmaisters haue receiued your letters
and required as aboue sayde the deputies with procuration to treat with them
these were subscribed
fran de valdes

don ferdinando de lannoy count dela roche who at

that time was sayd to be captayne generall of holland

zealand frizeland and vtright sent the
of september by his trumpet letters to the leydens written from vtright as it were to the same effect offering to come himselfe to leyden to set forward the matter with all equitie to the end they might be preserued from the imminent danger and horrour protesting before god and the worlde that they might impute the whole faulte of their vtter destruction to their wicked and obstinate opynion
wherefore he had sent them these letters for a latter farewell and not to looke for any further matter from him wishing them in the end a true vnderstanding and good will to accept of their welfare

the said trumpet had another letter of the same date writte from vtright by ten fugitiue citizens of leyden which conteyned that they had with great prayer and intreatie obteyned the same letters from the count de la roche that the leydens as yet presently might bee receiued to grace if it pleased them but if so bee they refused it that they protested to theyr countrie of the great and horrible dangers which myghte light vpon their heads aswell in bodie as goods
lastly wishing them to vnderstande that they might bee brought from a miferable estate vnto libertie
these present letters were subscribed by cornelius de la hoogh the sonne of nicholas gerard roelofs nicholas dom the sonne of iohn buyte~wech bartholomew alewyins geerbrand mees iohn adrianson de wylde rene the sonne of iames and thierry
the leydens the sixt of the sayd moneth answered these letters that they had sworn to the prince of oreng as liuetenant captaine general for his maiestie in holland like wise to the estates of the said countreye
and vntill such time as they were discarged of that they hoped to keepe it
and secondly they demaunded passeport before they came to a parle to the end they might send some of their citizens to his excellency and the estates promising that they should returne within eight dayes

the leydens desired this passeport vnder this coulour that they might more safely send their messengers about their other affaires and this was a stratageme or warlike pollicy against

enemies from whome they craued this to keepe them in that opinion for they right well knew that an hare could not well get out of leyden through their campe because it was so staightly besieged and therfore much lesse could their messengers goe towardes his excellency without their leaue although they knewe contrariwise three other wayes yea for the verye same night that the enemies thought them selues most safe they went out and passed where a man would haue thought it moste impossible
and besides they knew wel inough the popish faith and spanish promises and also after what manner the comma~dator had handled the granadoes

the fugitiues of leyden which were at leyerthorpe had already made their reckoniug that they should home to their houses for so they verely thought when as they sayd vnto the messengers what excuse are you able to make for your selues in deede the harlemians might haue some excuse to saye that the souldiers enforced them to hould out so long but you haue no souldiers and therfore are no way excusable nor no grace to be left for you for they neuer thought that the leidens meaning was to make the names of their fellowe citizens euen by their owne testimonies immortall and them selues receyue euerlasting shame
for once it was well knowne that in the first place leyden was enforced to paye all the men of warre within the campe
and some of the fugitiues haue sithence the deliueraunce expressely confessed euen in the towne of amsterdame that notwithstanding all the fayre promises of the spaniardes there was a deuice if they had entred the towne to haue murdred all the defensable personnes yea all the marryed women
and it may be that the young damsels might haue found fauour because the spaniards would haue abused them for the seruing of their filthy lusis and pleasures

this wryting from so manye and sundry places beeganne to breede some ielousie for euery man sought most carefullye to gette all the commendation that was possyble to bee had at the commandators handes for the yeelding vp of leyden which in part appeared by iohn de huiter his letters dated the of september from leyerthorpe to the lorde

of northwyke when as he sayd when that your dromb was come to the campe my selfe was there present but so farre forth as am able to iudge the generall of the campe is angry with the colonnell and captaine because they suffered the trumpet passe with certeine letters
wherefore woulde aduise you as a friend that if you intend to treat of the matter to doe it with baldez whom you know to be mercifull to the end that all thinges might passe through his handes as generall of the campe
for if you doe not so he will take it in euill part and therby doe you no good

and as a frieud to the towne wherein continued fiue yeares in the flower of mine age coulde not but aduertise you hereof
these foresayde letters were not altogether vnprofitable or fruitelesse in the hearts of some vnconstant men and as if the towne of leyden had not beene already sufficiently ouercharged with three plagues and scourges which commonlye goe hande in hande together to wit plague pestilence and famine the fourth paine is ioyned hereunto for many citizens who had hitherto dissimuled the matter said that they had redeemed their toong of a lombard because that the commissary bronchorst aforesayd died the
of september who if he had liued would haue coupled such braue pratlers to the gallows by reason that he was a good and seuere iusticer in the towne so that whyles hee lyued both papiste and him
howebeit of this inconstancie which was also amongst some of the lordes of the towne we will hereafter speake more at large

nowe when the admyralles aforesayde through the diligence of the hollanders the chiefe of which being maister cornelius of bronchorst maister henrye duyst and lenyn were according to the necessitie reasonably well furnished and appoynted yt the
of september certeine barques had discouered that the lymittes and diuisions of the fieldes were not passing a foote and a halfe aboue the water his excellencye appoynted that the dikes betweene soetermeir and willeuene should be opened that they might come downe from thence vnto soetermen mere which is about a quarter

of a myle from the diuisions of the fieldes aforesaide so that the admiralles before named departed the
of the sayd month with many other captaynes of holland and deputies of the estates and admiraltie alongst by the rott hauing
gallies and certeine other which came from delft and gaude and the victuallers two ensignes of pyoners and other necessarye thinges sayling towardes the diuisions of the fieldes aforesayde
and besides his excellencie had appoynted certeine ensignes of souldiers to wit frenchmen the captaine of the guarde
durant and catteuille for thedefending of the trenches in the place aforesaid on both sides an houre before day and if it were possible before the enemy should perceiue them which with merueilous diligence they perfourmed and the two admyrals placed their shippes on eyther side to defende the trench with their artillery
halfe an houre before the trench was finished the spaniards came from soetermeir towards the place afore said to skirmish appoynting on the hye fieldes side to witte the common fielde about fiue braue companies of almaines
the french which were of ye regiment of ye coloniel of the guard and other of his excellencies guarde which were come thyther of pleasure notwithstanding that the admyrall had prayed and commaunded them not to come neere the enemy within the cannon shotte yet ranne they so out of their trenches as that the admyrall with his shippes coulde not play with the artyllery as they would howheit the artillery only of
gallyes gaue them the whole side so lustely as yt they durst not only march forward but were also twise enforced with losse and shame enough to returne to soetermeir and there were no moe wounded but the admiralles pylot onely that was with a harquebuz shot a few of his mariners lightly hurt

now on the other side to wit from wylsuene or leytherdam quarter in the euening came the spaniards both on foote on horsback where was a braue skirmish
and by reason of the small shotte and the great ordenaunce which on the side lustelye displed them from the gallyes they were constrayned of verye shame to retyre so that the gallyes which pursued with strength of ores slew some of their horses and also the ryders
but herein fell out a very cruell deede committed by a

zelanber who haue a wonderful desire to be flesht of the and the spaniards likewise of them
for the zelanders had learned it of the spaniardes former deedes who had learned ye same of the mores turks althogh in very deed it is no whit commendable in a christian and the matter was thus
a zelander had taken one of the staine spaniardes and pluckt the heart out of his body as hee lay halfe dead and when hee had gnawne it with his teeth hee cast it awaye from him

this gnawne heart was afterwarde seene at delft by manye credible people and the very prynte of the teeth in it
there were also after that as it should seeme certeine lattin verses set forth by the lorde of northwike vppon the same deede as followeth

lugdunum tingit batauorum miles iberus a batauo contra cingitur ille mari
non opus est gladiis ferroque rigentibus armis solo pro batauo belligerentur aquae
iacturam pecoris batauus quam fecit agri humano decies sanguine ibere lues
mercator sapiens tamen haud mercabiturvan hispani generis corpora mille boui
macra caro est nuper cum cor gustasset iberi respuit canibus nauta vorare dedit
deseruere agros bataui nassouius heros nullus enim fixos abstulit hostis agros
inuenit ratio sine sanguine pellere longe hostilésque manus hisperiumque iugum
tolle motus hispane fuge ne respice terras pro quibus oceanus pugnat ipse deus

which verses may be thus englished

with heart most mercilesse the vile proud spaniard hath leyden round about beset to spoyle it with his guard but holland sea hath giuen the spaniard such a blow as that with armes droms also he may go shoote the crowe
tis water force that fightes genist you the battell strong dispatch therfore and packe you hence least wayling be your song

for for losse of one beast and spoyle of holland field the spaniards blood shall it repay and ten for one it yeeld for the wise merchaunt doth of one oxe more esteeme then of a thousand carrions leane of spanish breede weene
for when a poore mariner of heart had taste the iuyce he cast it downe vnto the dogges it was too vile to vse
the oreng prince and eke the hollanders say forsooke the fieldes and yet of them was no whit take away
for he found out the meane without any blood shed the enemy to driue far off and put spaine yoke to bedde
and therfore get thee hence thou spaniarde proud vile for ocean sea and god him selfe doe fight for vs the while

nowe as the leydens had written aduertised his excellency by letters of the
of this month which they sent by certein citizens to witt iohn lubert chaudronnier or brasier scot nightuigall and others who traueiled sundry wayes the poore estate of their citizens beeing through famyne ouerwatching and warding greatly weakened required and prayde their speedy ayde and delyuerance because they feared that the fielde bankes and ditches were not as yet gawged and cut by reason they saw not the water come downe
whereupon his excellency and the generall estates of holland wrote briefly backe vnto them the
of the sayd moneth of september as followeth

that all men right well knew how carefull and at what great charges they had beene and were at for their ayde and deliuerance and therfore doubted not but that the leydens for their part would shew them selues most constant and like faithfull confederates stand manfully for the maintenaunce of their iust and honest cause and reiect al cxaftye practises and sugred promises by which the enemy hoped to winne and yoke them
and that they shoulde also haue great regard howe they lost the commendation which they had already vniuersally gotten
signifying vnto them further that the messengers whom they sent had seene with their owne eyes the gawging and cutting downe of the field bankes or ditches the day before as by their own report by word of mouth they might more at larg vndersta~d
they se~t also a copy of those letters which they had sent

the
and
of this month letting them thereby bnderstand their great care ouer them and the and councell they gaue the together the promises of their and franchises in time to come
and vnderueach was subscribed your good confederates the knightes nobles and townes of holland representing the estates of the said countrie together the counsell of those which were then present with his excellencye and subscribed by

ottes of egmond adryan myle william iohnson of henskerke cornelius bouchorst william loo cornelins gautier and a little beneath subsigned by ye secretary rechtere

the leydens answered these letters the
of the same month
thanking and praysing god with ioyfull heartes and al the estates for that foresaid gawging
shewing them besides their great necessitie and misery requiring that the enterprise begunne for their deliuerance might be hastened

the same day there were letters likewise dispatched and written in cifers to the admsrall boisot declaring vnto him their extreame distrosse and praying him to haste with all the possible speede that might be desiring with all to vnderstande in what forte they should deale wherein they trusted should neither be seene nor found in them any negligence or want of good will
but now to leaue our wandring discourse we will again return to our other matters there were some who thought the selues very well seene about these field bankes had perswaded his excellencie that his people which were passed the sayde lymittes might without anoyance come downe into the afore saide sacternieir meere notwithsta~ding ye experience shewed the clean co~trary
for first there was a greene way which lay a foote hyer then the water and the same likewise was to be gotten and trenthed before the enemy vnderstood it which was perfourmed without the losse of any man and yet the enemy lay within a musket shot therof secondly they thought they might haue passed fro the~ce into soetermeir by reso of ye sundry ditchs wherout turues had bin digged howbeit but one of the went so farre and the same also driuen to goe vnder bridge

which standeth full in way where the spaniardes on either side lay to wit euen at the houses harde vppon the bridge and the bridge also was fortified with thyrtie ensignes of souldiers who lay in all the houses alongest the way
insomuch that none could passe by them but that they would haue displaced the with their great ordenance

his excellencie lying at delft and hearing hereof sent forthwith by the master of the ordenance foure demie canons placed and planted in fit vessels for the purpose and withall the broken yse of delft
these vessels being of a mightie thicknes were trimmed before with very great plankes betweene the planks were massie nettes rammed in for the sauing of the canonier
these vessels being arriued at the campe the seuenteenth day the admyrall sent presently all his gallies towardes the saide bridge by sundrie chanels
and himselfe sayled downe the chanell which directly ranne vnto the bridge and came so neere as that hee was within danger of the harquebuze shot
and on his left side in another channel were two of the demie canons aforesaid and on the right hand was the admirall of ziericksea with two other demie canons and some of the gallies were come through another chanell and had gotten so very neere the enemie as that they slue foure or fiue of the marriners and gald diuers of the rest
these lay battering at the bridge from morning tyll noone
but as one of the aforesayd vessels began to splyt by reason of the force of a bullet that was shot that the other mighte likewise haue beene so serued and withall seeyng the enemie notwithstanding the great losse of his people not once remooue the admyrall caused to sounde the retraite
nowe this retraite could not bee without the losse of the princes people especially of those whiche were with the admyrall of ziericksea

there were amongest this company certaine french gentlemen captaines as catteuille durant and guileresse who were too too forwarde with theyr souldiers against the enemie for they had gotten with their barkes behinde the turf heapes not farre from the enemies houses trenches thinking to haue set them on fire
but the admyrall retyring without any noyse

and not knowing them to bee so farre foorth the enemie perceiuing them to bee there so lustily assailed them with such a great number of boates as that catteuille guileresse and seuen souldiers moe by reason of the reculing of their barke were drowned

but durant and certaine souldiers with him saued the~selues by swimming neuerthelesse the enemie as it was after well knowne receiued a farre greater losse through the shooting off of the great ordenance
for their boates were full fraught with their dead hurt and gald men and carried to vtright insomuch that some scoffing fellowes iested and saide that fryers gray was very deare ware because that whosoeuer woulde goe to the popes heaue must needes bee buryed in a fryers minors coule and the time was that they would put them coffyn all into the coule when as they carryed them very vnsauery from the campe as commonly it fell out both at amsterdam and also at vtright where they are buried in the body of ye church
and although the princes armie had with the great ordena~ce merueilously annoied the enemie as had also the valiant souldiers of the colonels of the baron of noyelle and of the captaine of the guarde yet it shoulde seeme that they wonne no great matter by it
for the water rose not so high as they looked for and that was by reason of the infinite thousandes of hassocks which sucked vp the water the winde also serued them to no pur pose and besides the enemie vsed many and sundrie meanes to draine the water aside

moreouer the said bridge was marueilous strongly and againe the boates which had the demie canons in them woulde otherwise haue beene trimmed so that it seemed all that cost and trauell to be vtterly lost and themselues at their wits end
howbeit the lorde god purueyed for them two maner of wayes to wit first by reason of the nottheast wynde which blew vp a mightie gabe the

dayes of september seco~dly through the good counsell yt was giuen to peter wastell one of his excellencies counsell who in this dealing was very diligent and carefull for as he was deuising with two countrie men they told him that they needed not passe by that bridge seeing they might passe the way called segwart

lying betweene soetermeir and benthouse
when the councellour heard thus much he tolde it to his excellencie and returning to ye campe sate hereupon in councell with the admiral noielles the captaine of the guarde and with certaine estates of the admiraltie and they all concluded as abouesaid

and heereupon admyral boysot accompauied with wastell aforesaide with the guard eight gallies and senentie souldiers directed his course that night towards segwart way and there arriued before such time as the enemie had any vnderstanding of them for the vice admyrall lay with the armie before the said soetermeir bridge
nowe when they had gotten this way the captaine of the guard desired citadelle an italian gentleman and ye baron of noielles lieuetenant to fortifie and entrench with vawgiraut and halfe the souldiers on benthouse side and master bochart with captaine ladriere and the other halfe of the souldiers on soetermeir side
and the meaning here of was this yt although the whole force of the enemie should sodenly breake vpon them yet thought they hereby safely to returne to their ships howbeit all in vaine for the enemie seeing himself deceiued had no great stomacke to ferrit them out and ye almaines who lay at benthouse so soone as night came shewed a faire payre of heeles they which lay at soetermeir in the morning forsooke their trench retired towards leyden to wit towardes northaske soeterwouwe kyrkwegge weyport carrying with them their artillarie and fortified themselues in manie houses now the treaches in segwart way were not finished withoute the great trauell of the princes people who labored all that night vp to ye knees in the water ye wind mightilye blowing at ye
the next morrow admirall boysot sent the captaine of the guarde to looke for the armie which through gods mightie hand arriued there without the losse of any one man

the almaines aforesaid were no sooner gone fro benthouse but yt captaine ladriere had gotte their trench
when the princes people were passed segwart way hauing set on fire the houses which stood on soetermeir way captaine cret an orengian arriued at soetermeir with three companies of souldiers and the arke of delft
this arke

was a strange

buylt and trymmed vessell well furnished with great ordenance but very noysome to the armie by reason of the lownes of the water insomuch that they thought once to haue burnt her but because shee had in her betwixt fifteene twentie peeces of greate ordenance they founde the meanes to bring her to the foresaide place that ryding there shee might keepe the passage
this arke was built of two shippes ioyned together and was rowed neither with sprites nor ores neither yet oriuen with the helpe of any sailes but by wheeles wrought within her so very strongly built all ouer as that no musket shot was able to pearse her
she was of burden able to beare fiftie lustie men for defence and twelue to turne the wheeles

the next morrow they were determining whether they should goe on or tarrie a while longer
the admirall boysot thought it best to pursue the enemie reculed and to the ende that both the leydens and also the enemie might descrie him a farre off hee was resolued to take this enterprise in hande with twentie gallies and appoynted the rest of the armte to follow him
wee haue heeretofore spoken how the vessels which beare the demie canons were riuen with the force of the canon
but because they had neede of them they were speedily new calked pitched and tallowed at delft and beeing trimmed with leadde and salt bydes against the force of the pouder they folowed the armie the thyrde day after
the admirall hauing sailed not passing a myle from benthouse was tolde as it was ghessed that aboute the waters which ranne downe towardes norta that the enemy might strengthen himselfe in certayne houses thereabout howbeit when they had inquired after it the thing was found to bee farre otherwise wherfore he mad towards norta and got him euen within a musket shot thereof where hee might perceiue how that betweene two or three hundred well armed almaines had left two houses and were fled with all possible speede to the other side of norta little meere where the spaniardes were intrenched
whereupon the admirall lustily pursued them with force of oares and orderly enbattailed himselfe within an barquebuze shot of the enemie
from this trenche in norta houses were the muskets brauely discharged but the orengians so defended themselues with their great ordenance as that

the spaniarde knewe not where to hide his head

when the aforesaid almaines had closely conueyed themselues behinde two hay stackes to keepe them out of the danger of the great shot they retyred towards soeterwood which skirmishe lasted from noone vntill the euening but about mydnight the admyrall caused an alarme to be giuen by certayne small shot whom the spaniardes aunsweared foure or fiue tymes to the end to shew them that they were not departed but they fearing of surprising so stilly and flyly retyred towards soeterwood as that the admirall neuer perceyued it vntill the next morrow

the orengians were greatly annoyed by reason that the spaniardes had stopped the course of the water whiche ranne downe towardes soeterwood besides they were in a greate fault in that they made not a trenche at the entrie of the little meere for if they had the admyrall had found as daungerous a peece of work of it as was the enterprise at soetermeir bridge howbeit the lord god meaning to increase his glory so blinded them as that they became senslesse
when all the rest of the army were come with the great ordinance

the admiral al his whole army were gotte into a very large broad streame running towardes suyten where they discharged all their greate ordinaunce because the leydens should both see heare and bee encouraged for in seuen daies before they had not heard so much as a worde from them
the leydens againe aunsweared them with their great ordinaunce in token that they were not as yet discouraged although their food was no better then cow beefe and horse flesh
they had in the towne about nientie horses and from the foureteenth of september they beganne to distribute halfe a pound of thesayde horse flesh to a man for one dayes victuall

the colleagues and adherents of proud baldez came dayly before the gates of the towne menacing mocking and iesting and mixing withall sometimes very sweete and sugred wordes
and on a tyme certayne of his captaynes and officers meeting with a young youth going fro the towne to leyer thorp sayde vnto him tell your townes men that it is as possible for your prince to aide and deliuer your towne as it is for you

to catch the starres in the skie with your handes
these were the flaunderous high and proude woordes of this infidell maran and of his adherentes who thought themselues to haue as well prouided for the campe and siege about the towne as that neither ye townes men nor yet any man liuing was able to withstand him or hinder his deuise neuer thinking that there was a god who could and woulde deliuer the poore afflicted soules from the handes and sword of the tyrant
howbeit these threatning wordes faire promyses withall were not altogether fruitlesse because they wrought effectually in some inconstant vnsetled mynds by which they being moued by reason of ye great famyne which so grieuously touched the as yt there was like to haue bin a manifest discord in the town had not ye lord god by iames iohn de la does lords of northwyke wisely and grauely prouided against it
for about the very self same tyme that these things thus fel out
citizens who as they said had aboue
moe of theyr confederacy went to the towne house calling for victuals and that if none were there to be had that meanes might be found for yt prouiding of some where one of ye borroughmaisters protested

that he would not be the cause of ye death of those which died of hunger who as they said had at yt insta~t
bacon hogges left in his house insomuch yt these words had wrought a farre greater effect had not the deputies the rest of the magistrates with the captaynes the other citize~s in authority been more constant faithful had besides trusted more assuredly to ye merciful prouide~ce of god
for where some of the rest of the magistrates earnestly trauelled to perswade the people of the great mercy of baldez and of the notable pardon and withall of the promises conteyned within the letters aboue written these men on the other side set before the eyes of ye simple and faynthearted citizens all examples to the contrary
for the sayde pardon was by some so lustely mainteyned as that they shamed not to giue their good fellow citizens reprochful words only but of a froward affectio belied the also saying yt they which trusted not to the pardon were erra~d the eues which saying put them in great feare not sticking besides freely to cry out say yt they had redeemed the to~gs of their lombard this speech as before hath byu sayde arose by reason that the commissary

bronchorst was dead who so long as he liued helde them at the staues end and trussed some of them vp in an halter

ouer besides these iniurions reprochfull words the secret councels which they there oftentimes held came to litle effect for ye lord god had stirred vp the hart of a godly woman who from time to time aduertised the faithful ones of all their whole deuises so that they continually put themselues in armes before their secret enemies could bring any part of their enterprise to passe and it was so wisely and discreetly handeled as that they thought it to bee done vpon some other occasion which caused the dissemblers and counterfets not once dare to take in hande that theyr deuise by reason they were inwardly stricken with shame and feare
there were certaine also which came the very same time to peter adryanson the burrough master shewing him both by lamentable threatning words of their pouertie hunger thinking that they should thereby moue him to seeke some meanes to agree with the enemie
howbeit he in these few wordes answered them and said my good friends beloued fellow citizens haue made an oth which by the grace of god meane consta~tly to keep if my death sith am sure must once die may any way pleasure you it is all one to me whether you or ye enemie kill mee for for mine owne part intend god willing to go on a plaine direct course therfore if this carkasse of mine will do you any good in gods name take it cut it in peeces deuide it as farre as may possibly stretch for shalbe co~tented therwith
the citizens were at this answere so amazed as yt they went away without any moe words
now for the better mainteining nourishing of this dissention the encouraging of ye faithles discouragiug of the godly valiant withall for declaration yt the wordes aforesaid of the impossibilitie of their deliuerance were true the aforesaid de wibesina certaine other fugitiues of the towne had euen for the vp shot written the
of september to the leydens the summe whereof ensueth

that theyr great affection loue

enforced them once more to write vnto the leydens willing the to take heede that they brought not their towne to extreme misery calamitie when as all hope of grace shall fayle the
and therefore wished the not

to trust ouer much to theyr owne wisedome by their ouermuch crediting of ye ayd which they lookedfor fro the prince of ora~ge
and to the end they might see howe greatly they desired theyr deliuerance from all wretchednesse and miserie they verily beleeued that they should bee able to sende them passeport for three or persons which might come visite his maiesties campe to see if they might possibly deliuer them either by water or lande and in the meane while offered to sende some of theyr companie for ostages to the towne
or if it pleased them to send certain to talk of the matter they would also finde ye meanes that it shold so bee and woulde as much as was possible helpe them both with theyr act and councell

wherefore they aduised them not to neglect this aduertisement and send an answere by the bearer heereof
beseeching in the ende god to preserue them and so inspire them as that it might all turne to a good end

wee tell you that wee want no victuals you beare that in our towne are both dogges kine and horses
and if wee should in the end want these yet hath euery one of vs a left arme to eate and reserue the righte arme to beat the cyrant and the rest of you which are his blooddy ministers from our walles but if at the last our force shall not bee strong enough and that the lord god meaneth by your ha~ds to punishe vs for our demerites which wee through the confidence that wee haue in his diuine goodnes hope hee will not do yet will wee neuer forsake his holy worde nor yet giue ouer the

defense of the libertie of our countrie choosing rather when wee are at the verie worst to set our towne on fier then that it shold any way be gainefull vnto you and we become your flaues
for it is more tollerable for vs to bee flaine in fight with the machabees then to see the miserie of our people and indure your tyrannie both in our bodies and consciences an answere vndoubtedly worthie eternall memorie whereunto and such other like were the good citizens encouraged by their wiues
for there were a great number of them which rather would haue dyed of hunger in their houses then to haue yeelded into the tyrantes handes because that the tyrannies of narden surphen malyues harlem were yet fresh in their heads

we are now to returne to speake of the princes armie whithe we left at norta where it was faine to stay a few dayes for want of water because the enemie lay in the chanel towards soeterwood and also at soeterwood and thereby stopped the said chanell
this lying still of the armie pleased no whit such ydle persons as commonly will doe all things with their tonge although they haue no experience in the whole world in warrelike affayres most reprochfully crying out and asking why the admyrals went not on whiche in very deede they might haue done if the ships had had winges seeing that the water in these furmost fieldes was not aboue niene ynches deeep the gallies drew a foote and an halfe or two feete

wherefore the captaines required his excellencie beeing now whole to come to the armie

whyther about that very time indeede he came
his comming greatly reioyced the armie but no whit the enemie who perceiued it by the triumph of the canon
the order of the armie marueilously pleased his excellencie and gaue foorthwith order to seeke for the way which was to be gawged to wit the ryrkweg which thing was done by a gentleman orengian named bultran and the vice admirall cornelius nycolsons accompanied with iust the moore who made report thereof to his excellencie

the admirals and colonels
afterwarde the way how to gauge it was appointed
but because it pleased not the lorde that the water shoulde waxe higher nor none other winde blow then at that time did whiche made the water lower they were resolued to thrust in by stealth

into the towne thirtie or fortie barkes laden with bread
for the doing wherof captaine grenu offered his seruice
and afterward when his excellencie had commanded the admirals colonels and captaines to make al the possible speed that might be he returned to delfr

although the citizens of leyden had conceiued some good hope for their deliuerance as well by the letters fro the estates the twelfth of that moneth as also by the hearing and seeing of the effect of the great ordenance yet because they had not long before that neither receiued or yet sent any letters by reason of the great war de that was about the towne they sent two messengers who arriued the
of september about the admyral to declare vnto him the extreeme necessitie of the citizens whiche was in deed very great but yet not so great as they said and also to see the estate of the armie whereof they themselues if it were possible should come back to make report to their fellowe citizens if not yt then they should send letters by the posts of the ayre for to that end had the messengers aforesaide carried with them sixe old doues

nowe as the messengers thought to returne towardes the towne with the admirals letters they founde all the passages belaid and therefore were driuen of necessitie to returne howbeit the admir all boysot

had sent his letters the
of septe~ber by a flying poste hauing written to the townes men that by the grace of god he would procure their ayde and deliuerance praying them to remaine constant not lightly and vnaduisedly receiue in any victuals without they saw himselfe or some assurance from him for he feared that the spaniardes vnder his name might by some stratageme abuse and deceiue them

the first flying messenger arriued at leyden the
of that moneth which the magistrate by sound of the bel gaue the people to vnderstand the
day he read ye letters ope~ly
declaring vnto them how that his excellencie himself had been with the armie to giue order for their deliuerance and yt he had him commended vnto them all beseeching them yet for a while to continue constant for the lord of hostes woulde send meanes to deliuer the
these letters greatly gladded and incouraged the people prayfing god and incessantly as the other confedered townes had

done made their prayers vnto the lorde

now this great ioy was not without some mixture of sorrowe because that before and the same very day the winde blew vp at the northeast which caused the water to fall rather then ryse so yt the princes armie thought that they had as it were lost all hope of deliuering them if the inuisible meanes of god to wit the great flowing of the water which began that
day lasted vntill the second of october had not holpen them
wherfore the admirall boysot wrote vnto his excellencie that if god of his mercy did not help both wt wind also with ye rising of the water and by suche meanes as no ma was able as yet to perceiue that he sawe not which way possible to bring to passe the reuictualling of the towne for this time and feared that after it woulde be too late considering that there was not a beaste left and that there were but two dissributions moe to be had and these but to last for right dayes
insomuch that the misery besides the pestilence diseases and discord was in the towne verie great as he vnderstood by the messengers and as was also after found to be most true

for many of them had not in seuen weekes space eaten one byt of bread drunke nothing els but water
horse flesh also was then as good meat with the wealthiest of them as mutton is at this present
cats and dogs amongst the aduenturers

and others which lay at the gates of the towne were thought to be delicate meate and so eaten
it is impossible to describe vnto you all their maner of cookery although many tolde mee of it
some of them eate vine leaues mingled with amell floure and salt
there was great difference in the leaues of trees therefore they made sundrie kindes of meates of leeke blades rootes and roote stalkes and the roote leaues which fell to the ground was a very ordinary kinde of good meate
rootes and skinnes cut in small gobbins and sodden in butter mylke was an ordinary and common meate for manie
gentlewomen were driuen to eate their little pupprelles in whom before they tooke great pleasure
to the place where the flesh was wonced to be cut out and diuided the poore children came and eate blood rawe the peeces of the flesh which fell away in ye diuision
all the old rotte shoes in ye towne which lay in ye dirt were take vp eate forthwt

the poore women were seene sitting vpon the dounghils with their clokes cast ouer their heads gathering vp of the best bones they coulde finde and carryed them home to their houses
and they no sooner founde the least stalk of a roote but that they immediately eate it vp
the young boyes oftentimes sucked the bones which the dogs had gnawne
euery woman that lay in childbed was fain to be pleased wt a quarter of a pound of bisket a day
some women againe were so honger bitten as that the childe in theyr wombe was almost pined to death
the blood of ye cattell was gathered vp out of the filthie stinking gutters of the towne

and eaten
neuerthelesse their drinke was somwhat more to be borne withall for beside the water they had beare made of dates which cost an holland pennie the pot
yea some made drinke of the very huskes of the graines mingling therwt hearbe grace rue in steed of hemlock
othersome dranke vineger water mingled together so yt whe the town was freed at liberty there was scarcely any vineger to be had
a pound of butter was worth xv souls
a yellow carot one souls a rootstalk halfe a souls a peare or apple a grote
there was offered for a sacke of wheate an hundred florins

ouer and besides this great misery the plague was so ryfe all the towne ouer as that there dyed of it almost sixe thousand persons
the young children which were staruen to death said as it is written in the lamentations of ieremie where is the bread where is the wine and so fell down stark dead in ye streetes or betweene their mothers armes

and therefore after that many young children were faine to eate horse flesh
the men which could scarscely go ouer the bridge were enforced to ward as good as naked and in their returne founde neither wife nor children aliue
they yt were wont to goe wt their dizaines to the warde came backe againe with eight sixe and sometimes three
noble women and their children which were wont to be clad in silkes and fed vppon the most delicate meates dyed of very hunger

there was a dead man brought and layde before the gate of the buroughmasters thereby to shewe hym as it was thought both closely and expresly that hee had beene the cause thereof therfore yt it apperteined to him to seeke ye mean to preuent it

to bee short the extreeme miserie in the towne was such as is impossible for mee to describe and set downe
but they who after the deliuerance thereof had seene their leane faces and small and feeble legges might easily haue witnessed the same
and now to returne againe vnto the princes armie it had not needed to haue tarryed long at norta if it had beene certainelie knowne that the leydens coulde haue held out longer time
againe the prince and chiefe rulers of the armie knewe right well that the neerer winter drewe on the greater abundaunce of water woulde ensue
and the generall of the armie knewe well enough also that hee must passe betweene soeterwood suyten house and so did the enemie likewise and therefore had especially placed his whole warde there
in the meane while many thought it best to attempt by night soetermeir meere way towardes stompwyke way but it was to no purpose because that all the ditches and chanels lay in and out crokedlie besides the spaniard also warded there
the papists aforesaid had lying vpon the rhyin fiue great gallies and well appointed boates howbeit they wanted maryners
as these thinges in this wise most lamentablie stoode the most mightie god and lord of hostes who on extreeme necessitie neuer forsaketh his hauing compassion on his miserable afflicted ones woulde needes she we foorth his strong and outstretched arme for the deliuerie of his desolate people out of the hands of a tyrant

wherefore he sent the windes his ministers

who so violently blew vp as that the waters arose and wonderfully ouerflowed
for besides the great ouerslowing of the waters the northeast winde wonderfull violently blewe vp and brought againe the fallen water vpon the face of the earth who so prospered the southeast winde as that it draue ye same water towards leyden insomuch that the princes armie which before as abouesaid had but niene ynches of water had then aboue two feet and an halfe and was able to passe euen at the first ouer the high fieldes vnto ryrkweigh aforesaid if at any time they saw the water faile the then would ten or twelue men goe out of euery ship and so lighten her yt she might flote afterward passed ouer

kirkweigh wherefore they tooke their course towardes ye quarter in the night betwixt the first second of october after they had giuen a false alarme vnto stompwyke way

the order of this armie of the princes by sea

passing ouer the said high territorie was ranged placed in maner as followeth
the admiralles of flushing ziericksea had followyng ech of them fifceene gallies which spred themselues abrode like two winges
and first admirall boysot accompanied with the colonell of the guard had the leading of the left wing on soeterwood side because it was thought that the greatest force of the enemie lay there the admiral of zericksea had in his company master citadell bultran captaine paule duyrant and others
the vice admirall was placed on the right side of suyten accompanied with the baron of noieles master cornes bourchart and with captaines henrie grenu
philip de asseliers master of the ordenance and warlike munitions was appointed to tarry with the great ordenance eight or ten gallies vppon norta for ye keeping of ye victuals vntil such time as the said admirals had gotten ryrkweigh aforesaid that then hee shoulde follow and brauely salute the soeterwoodens with the greate ordenance which ordenance was charged with pretie little bags stuffed full of leaden bullets to wit

in euery bagge finely and artificially couched and those to be dispearsed amongest the thickest of the enemie

when all things were thus orderly arranged placed the armie departed about midnight the day aforesaid and the gallies and ships were seuered an harquebuze shot one behind another hauing in the middest about eighteene or twentie barkes laden with pyoners and all kindes of tooles for entrenching to the ende they myght so soone as it was possible fortifie themse lues at the said church way
but the spaniardes had appointed so great a watch in their small vessels as that it might haue serued for the whole bodie of a ward
and when they saw the admirall somewhat neere they called aloud and said who is there who is there but not a worde was giuen them vntill suche tyme as the admyrall was gotten within gun shot and then he so saluted them with ye roaring and thundring of the canon as that

the night seemed to bee day

this watch answered them againe with caliuers muskets and certaine faulconet shot and then left their vessels by little and little retyred still playing with their small shot vntill they had goten to the body of their ward which was entrenched at euery corner of the way
then salied they brauely out on euerie side fiercely deliuering their muskets against the orengia~s but the zealanders so resaluted them with such on haile of bullets as that they were driuen with great losse to retyre to their trenches leauing there behinde them onely a few souldiers to maintaine the skirmish who soone after also made their retrait

for the french captaines the captaine of the guard bultran and bourchart went on land and entrenched themselues on soeterwood side and grenu ladriere and others on the right side
in the mean while yt they were quietly entrenching of the~selues before the day breake the zealanders plaied fro their ships with their canons vpon the soeterwoodens but chiefly where they saw any fire or light and shot fier also into some of their houses
the maryners french souldiers which were on land cast fier likewise into diuers of their houses
the captaines aforesaid returning on both sides from the skirmishe stucke thicke into the grounde all alongst the way stakes with long yron pykes at the ende of them to the end yt the enemie being once driuen from that way might neuer returne thither againe

now when the orengians had taken this churche way entrenched themselues placed a ward there they gawged it in three places to make a way for the passing of their gallies in the mean while the ships laden with victuals being about an hu~dred were sent away and arriued all neere the armie two excepted which going out of the right way fell on the dry land and so consequently into the handes of the enemie
and surely here is one thing greatly to be considered of that in the feates and deedes of armes of so great importance doone in the sight and middest of the whole force of the enemie there were not aboue fiue or sixe men of the princes side slaine but to say truly this was gods worke and not mans for the good god when it pleaseth hym keepeth and defendeth his euen in the greatest and most perillous dangers to the ende hee woulde shewe vnto

tyrants and proude men that hee is able to abase and throwe downe the power and strength whereof they so highly bragge that thereby he might make his glory magnificence and prayse appeare the greater

when all the whole armie by sea and victuallers had passed that way the admirall of flushing directed his course towardes the meere bridge neuerthelesse after he had sayled a little way where he thought to haue found it deepest it proued very shallow
and then the zealanders shewed themselues to bee men of great stomacke for they for the vnburdening of theyr ships leapt presently into the water and like men that had rather haue carried theyr vessels away vpon theyr shoulders then to haue leaft them by that meanes got to meerbrough

when the spaniardes and the rest which lay encamped about soeterwood church in diuers trenches had seene the next day in the morning which was the second of october that the prince his armie had not as yet directed her course towards leyden thought that because they saw all on a light fier behinde them that they meant to enclose them in soeterwood
and that which most of all amazed them was that they sawe the water in so short time rysen so high

and therefore baldez the generall of their campe considering what aduantage the orengeans nowe had began to quaile and with such speed left soeterwood as that hee had not the leasure to carry away his great ordenance with him
howbeit hee was no sooner fled but that alfonse loupes gallio folowed him with his seuen ensignes and tooke the way from forscote through a place whiche hee had for that purpose caused to be heightened with boughes and fagots

when the admyral and his retinue were in meirbrough he vnderstood nothing of this flight vntill it was too late and that the greater number of them were gotten away
howbeit certaine gallies cutting the way off from them so brauely played with the great ordenance amongest the lustie heele lifters as that a good manie of them were driuen to returne who beeing thus scattered one from another the zealanders

thereupon getting out of the water fell vpon the tayle of those which fledde towardes forscote and with their long rusty prages slew euery mothers sonne of them and so lustely pursued them as that many of the enemies running directly before the not knowing they way drowned themselues in the ditches and channelles

the rest which could not gette to forescote for feare of the great ordenaunce of the gallyes which had cut the waye off from them fled towardes stompwyke way and casting their weapons farinough from them tooke their heeles towards leyerdam and forebrough
in this flight and with the battery that was the night before about
of baldez souldiers were pretely well cooled
there were also certeine barkes taken laden with baldez wine victualles and baggage which were deliuered to the admirall
but here is a thing greatly to be considered of that notwithstanding that the lord god what by reason of ye great ouerflowiug of the waters as also because of the good counsell which he inspired into them had mightely assisted the orengers wherby they might vse the fittest meanes for this purpose yet had all this beene euen as good as nothing seeing that the great numbers of the enemy and their fortes seemed to be inuincible if so be that he had not mightily feared and astonished the
for euen at that very instant such a great feare came vppon the that laye at leyerthorpe and lammen as that they trembled withal to see their companio~s thus flye and although the church and houses of soeterwood were all on a light fier yet they which lay at lammen thought it best not once to stirre one step from thence

but to returne nowe againe to the leydens it hath heretofore beene sayde that the messengers whiche came fro leyden to the princes nauy brought doues with them one of which was sent backe againe who faythfully carryed ouer her letters and beside the leydens looked for none other newes nor aduertisments but when they should issue out of the town to set vpon the fort and trench of lammen which thing was written vnto them the first of october howbeit the flying poste did not her duetie but was the first that came the next daye to

the town so that the citizens gaue not the signe which they appoynted to doe and therfore admirall boysot who first arriued at the wyues bridge thought the towne had beene yeelded vp because the citizens were so still
howbeit when the citizens saw the fier at soeterwood but especially the church to be on a light fier knowing right well that the spaniardes laye there and were rounde about well fortified in their trenches they all merueilous ioyfully leaped vpon the rampars notwithstanding the enemies being welfortified in lammen fort the cannon playing brauely from the trench against the orengers army and besides their seeing in the afternoone
soldiers at tronstone decayed house wherefore they caryed their ensignes to the rampars and tyed them to the wynde mylles sayles in token that they were of good courage and mery
and afterward caused these foure poyntes of the great penaltie to be proclaymed

first that no women young children nor people vnmeete to beare armes should come to the rampars and that as many as did beare armes must be with their accustomed armour weapon in his quarter and place appoynted
that they which had watche the night before should bee the next time at the body of their ward
that none of them should depart from the rampars vntill the magistrate called for them
that all boates and barkes shoulde departe out of the mayne channelles and streame· the side ditches or creeks to the ende that the shippes which were to come into the town should no way be stopped but haue free passage that the citizens might helpe them whether it were in the deepe on the side or in the comming out according as they sawe it needefull and necessary
then the burroughmaisters shewed the shippes to their citizens saying beholde louing fellowe citizens here behinde this forte is nowe bread what thinke you of it shall we let it alone there then cryed the citizens with one voyce nay but let vs rather pull downe the gate with our nayles then suffer it to be stayed before lammen

nowe when the admirall had for two causes made the great artillary to be brought through soeterwood to papen meere first for that from thence lammen fort was farre neerer on the left side secondly because the shppes with victuals might annoy one the other at meerbrough and so cause great incombraunce if so be the enemy as hath beene aforesayde were not discomfited

the spanyardes merueilously played with their great ordenaunce agaynst the orengers army both from lammen fort and also from iames nycholso~s forte at wedde so that they slew with one cannon shotte seauen of the admyrals men at a blowe making thereby the worlde beleeue that they were fully determined to keepe the sayde fortes
but because this trenche of lammen was the chiefest

which the princes people most feared by reason it stoode on the hyer grounde haue thought good to make some small discription of the scituatio thereof

this place standeth in a playne fielde hauing no hye ground nor hilles about it and all the channelles and streames were quite and cleane dammed vp about a quarter of a myle from the towne
and the streame which runneth towardes delft is like the bowte of a mans arme and on the one side therof runneth a channell from it as farre as the rhine and on the other side an other channell running towardes soeterwood the rest of this place with ditching and ramparing might easilye haue beene made sure strong by reason of the store of trees growing round about it

the rampare of this trench was reasonably thicke but yet not able to hould out the cannon shot it was also well furnished with great ordenaunce souldiers with what soeuer els necessary for a trenche so that in any mans reason if the spanyardes had wel kept this one onely trench ye orengers armye had neuer beene able to haue passed without the great losse of men
and yet notwithstanding

the strength hereof the admyrall certeinelye determined to sette vpon it wherefore on the seconde of october about the euening hee sente captayne grenu asseliers and captayne harry

to see where he might to the most aduauntage plant his ordenaunce where they found that they might plante two demye cannons at the corner of a channel but not without great paine and perrill

this night the admirall wrote to his excellency of all this situation aforesayd and withall how he meant the next morrow to batter it
but if so be the thing fel not out as he looked for yt he would be contenced vntill such time as the water should waxe deepe that it might be nauigable on the one side ouer their land
and although his excellency had committed the whole dealing hereof into the handes of god yet these newes pleased him no whit but greatly doubted of the deliueraunce of leyden aswell because of the reasons aforesaid as also for that he feared there could be no sufficient breach made to giue the assault considering with all the fewnesse of his men
howbeit the lord of hostes would alone prouide for all these difficulties and small hope and giue the honour to his most mightie arme to the ende men might vnderstand that although they knew many practises for the vanquishing of the enemy yet that all should be in vaine to no purpose without he put to his helping hand and the victorie to come from him alone

for after that the two admiralles the third of october had very early in the morning layed open the channelles which were merueilously choked vp with great stakes and pyles for the planting as before hath been said of their artillary and battering of lammen fort they perceiued that the lord god had preuented them and would not haue the enemy driuen awaye by the force of men

for he had driuen such a feare into ye hearts of the enemy as that they made a shamefull flight casting their artillary into the ditches and channelles insomuch that this night they forsooke the strong trench of lammen
howbeit there was neuer a man eyther without or yet within the town that once vnderstood of this flight and retraicte although in very deede a great noyse was heard in the night as they soonke a great peece of ordenaunce in the channell right before the said fort neuerthelesse there was a young stripling who watching that night on the rampare saw many light matches goe out of the forte and none returne againe and therfore he presumed

as in deede it was true

that the spaniardes had forsaken the forte of lammen which thing he opened and craued leaue to goe thyther nowe this his request was easily graunted him with promise of sixe florins to saye if the enemye were there that hee ranne out of the towne for verye hungar

when hee was come to the forte and found neuer a man there he wayued with his cappe but yet for all this the townsmen beleeued him not because they doubted that the spaniard by some sleight had so commaunded him neuerthelesse when they sawe that an other which followed him passed before the forte towardes the admyrall wading vp to the knees to salute him great ioy and myrth was made on euery side
and thervpon the valyaunt captayne gerard lane tooke his way with his aduenturers towardes lammen forte vntyl he came to the first place that was strengthened with pyles where he receiued with great ioye the admyralles two first gallyes
for the admyrall being a man of iudgement and not light of beeliefe hadde sente these two gallyes before which founde all to bee true that was coulde him to wytte that they had left the forte and soonke two great peeces of ordenaunce in the channell

after that the passages were layde open

and cleared of the pyles the admyrall lewys boysot ioyfully praysing god made out the vauntguarde towardes leyden where hee quietlye entred at eyght of the clocke in the morning

and adryan guyllanne the admyral of ziericksea ledde the rerewarde
but it was a lamentable thing to see the miserable starued people deuoure the rawe herringes which the admyrall at his entrie cast vnto the people and likewise the breade whereof some of them eate so greedely as if they shoulde neuer haue beene filled whereupon many of them which so fed surfeited and by litle and litle great numbers died thereof

on the other side of the towne towards harlem meere were three gallyes of amsterdam who nowe and then saluted the towne with the cannon but when they perceyued the ayde and with all the artyllarye of the towne they were

so heartily afeard as that they parte awaye with all their whole company

when the admyrals were in the towne they with theyr retynue and citizens went to the church to thanke god with all their heartes for his laying vnder the water the fieldes and drye lande and conducting of them to the desiered place and porte

baldes his people who the day before forsooke their fortes had fiered soeterwood but chiefly weyporte and being striken with feare forsooke also the third of october their cabyns without burning of them but especially the forte of leyerthorp and all thereabout
for although they were aboue three to one orenger

who when they were altogether were not both of soldiers maryners and others which bare armes besides those whiche had the leading of the vitcualles aboue two thousande fiue hundred whereas baldez men after their own reckoning were betwixt eleauen and niene thousand at least as also may verye well appeare by their letters aboue mentioned but the almighty god as before hath beene sayde for the deliuera~ce of his people strooke them with a merueilous great terror as he in olde time stroke senacherib for the deliuerye of his people israel
and thinke that if the hispaniolized
leydens woulde confesse the trueth as some of them haue already done at leyerthorpe they woulde testifie that feare was the cause
for the orengers are not ashamed for their partes to confesse that if their hope and confidence had not been in an inuisible ayde and that they before hand sawe that thing which now they see to wit yt the towne being on euery side encompassed with so manye trenches and bulwarkes as that it was vnlikely that they euer once durst haue attempted to reuictuall and succour the towne with so fewe people
but the lorde god would needes shewe his mightie hand and stretched out arme to the end that all glory might be giuen to his heauenly wisdome and goodnesse

and wee are not here to forget a very great and merueilous accident to wit that the selfe same night wherein the spanyarde forsooke the forte of lammen there fell downe a pane of the wall and vauntmure of the towne betweene the

cow gate and bourgoine tower sixe and twentie poles longe so that there was a breache made without any batterye
if the enemye had had this aduauntage before to wit two or three nightes before when as they thought in the night by scale to haue surprised the town at hoogewoert gate which they scaled and thought to haue wonne because a fonde younge wench had giuen them to vnderstande that the watch was very small howbeit they founde it otherwise
for before such time as three harquebouzes were discharged they all retyered no doubt of it they might haue thought the same to bee as woonderfull a thing as the citizens nowe make of this hurte and feare onelye excepted because that theyr breache was made without batterye but it pleased the lorde god to deale otherwise with the citizens for they in steede of takinge of harme receiued benefit
for the great noyse was it that encreased the feare of the enemye by reason they thought that the citizens had salied out of the towne to charge them in the face and the orengers on the backe and therfore had the townsmen so much the more cause to prayse the lord

when the admyrall was come to leyden hee forthwith wrote to his excellencye sying at delft how that god had striken the enemy with such an horrible feare as that they hadde forsaken the fort of lammen which was the cause of his entrye into the towne
this letter was caryed to his excellency the
of october and deliuered vnto him at two of the clock in the afternoon being at the sermon which without all doubt were other maner of newes then that came in the morning wherefore so soone as the french sermo~s were finished he caused the minister openly to reade the letter most thankfully and ioyfully praysing the lord
the like also was done at the
great churches so that these newes were ioyfully spred all ouer in a verye great company and congregation of the people and in his excellencies presence
the same also was done in the rest of the towns of holland with bonsters and such like tokens of ioye

after that the admyrals had thus victualled the towne of leyden thanked and praysed the lord of his grace encouraged ye

cytizens and filled them with meate they pursued the victorye and fell vppon the enemye that laye entrenched about leyerthorpe

the trenche at leyerthorpe was wonderfull stronge and they which lay there greatly bragged and tolde the messengers which came thyther of their merueilous force which tended as it nowe fell out to their greater shame and the lordes far greater honour and more villanously forsooke the fortes and trenches of haye and the oldwatring where they had remained a full yeare and a daye
for a very small number of the princes vauntcurrers which as it is sayde was not aboue a dosen put two of the enemies ensignes to flight some of which fled with such speede as that they ceased not running vntill they came to the gates of amsterdame saying in their own excuse that all the whole campe was discomfited and put to flight
at the same time likewise did baldez his people forsake not onely gaude scluse trenches but also all the rest to the number of two and twentie saue wadding alone where remained certeine souldiers for the freeing of the passage
nowe in this voyage and expedition there were no moe of the princes parte slaine then fortie but of the enemies by theyr own confessio aboue a thousand
howbeit here is one thing not to be forgotten which the sayde baldez lefte in his lodginge to wit the towne of leyden pyctured with all her royall wayes pathes and channelles of water and all in such maner as they were guarded and defended with fortes
and when he was enforced to rayse his campe

he wrote vnder this pycture vale ciuitas valete castelli parui quia relicti estis propter aquam non per vim inimicorum
that is to saye farewell leyden and all the small castelles about thee for the waters haue dryuen vs out of you and not the force of the enemy

confesse in deede that the waters were one of the principall meanes to cause baldes leaue the town and trenches but if he woulde haue spoken truely he should haue sayde it is the myghtye and strong arme of the lorde which hath enforced me to leaue you who hath put me in such a terryble feare as that antiochus neuer fledd out of persia with greater

dishonour neither timothe towards gazara nor yet lysias fro the machabees then and my people leyden haue bin driuen to leaue thee and all my fortes

when his excellency had heard of the foresaide newes

he went the next day to leyden giuing the citizens great thanks both for their fidelity and also for their so valiantly defending of themselues without souldiers against so populous an enemy and therefore told them that both they and their children should be well rewarded for their great trauell
and afterward he set an order in euery thing as wel about ye affaires of the towne as of the warres to the end he might make his profit of the victory which the lord had giuen him

howbeit for the greater manifestation of the wonderful works of god haue one thing more heere to speake of whiche is not to be passed ouer in silence and that is this that the foure of october the winde being then at the southeast the next
or
daies following so lustely blowing vp at the northeast as that no ma without great danger was able to paste fro delft to leyden because the water as fast as was possible left ye fields and returned againe to sea
ouer and besides the victuals aforesaid which were brought to leyden his excellency and his counsel thought it good that all the rest of the townes round there about should ayde and assist the poore famished leydens to the ende that the miserable soules who had so long time got nothing but consumed al their moueable goodes might be holpen and so the rich mens victuals thereby last the longer
for which cause the deputies of delft went all delft through with their waggons and boates gathering amongest the citizens great store of bread butter flesh cheese lard fish and money to the value of a
florins and better
which did not onely mightely helpe the poore but also so eased the rich as that the towne was therby likewise reuictualled which encreased not only a farre greater amity betweene the townes but confirmed also their alliance a great deale the more

and although al the world knoweth yt not only this warre of leyden but also of the whole low countries was taken in hand

partely for the defence of the lybertie of the countrey yet shall it better appeare by certeine peeces of artillary which the enemies of the lybertie of it had caused to be made to the vtter abolyshing of the whole libertie thereof as by the manner of it euen very nowe we shall vnderstande
for the leydens beeing thus distressed about the lybertie of the same and in the ende delyuered founde the verye same daye of their lybertye and delyueraunce a very great peece of ordenaunce named the lybertie which the spanyardes had soonke in the middest of the channell
the lord therfore graunt them that they may with all preserue the libertie of their country and vse it to his glory

the
of october his excellency departed from leyden towardes haye where be tooke order if it were possible for the conseruation and holding of the place as the onely key of harlem meere

the
day his excellency went to gaude scluse about the ordering of all thinges necessary there where was a very strong trench but by reason of the daungerous disease which his heighnesse had at roterodam the spaniards presumed that the warre was made in his name being dead and therefore two spaniardes were sent to leyden with passeport from iulyan romero to see if he were aliue and if they found him so that they should talke with his excellency about the deliuery of aldegonde in exchaung of colonnell mondragon whereupon they agreed and when his excellency had dispatched their passeporte and letters hee within two houres after sent them away
and after that his excellency for the causes abouesayde suffyciently set down had chaunged the great counsel of leyden

the
of that month hee tooke his way to gaude the
where aldegond hauing remayned prisoner about a yeares space returned franke and free and was with ioy receiued of many good people

a litle while after that the sayde baldez was come to harlem he dayly lamented and bewayled his great mishappe for there beganne a great vprore amongst his souldiers and they mortally hated him and gaue it openly out that he had dealte

for the leydens and receiued of the two barrelles of gold for ye sauing of the towne insomuch that this brute together the arrerages of their paye for many monethes gaue them such occasion so to disdayne and mislike him as that they tooke him prisoner and after they had placed one eletto in his rowine to be their goueruour they caused him

write letters to the great commaundator of cashall to send them their pay with in tenne dayes or els they woulde seeke some other place of seruice and get money where it was to be had

when the tenne dayes were expyred which was aboute a moneth after the deliueraunce of leyden they forsakinge the scluse of maesland leyerdam forescote falkenbrough and other places assembled themselues on foote and horseback betwixt sixe and seauen thousand men both of spaniards almaynes and wallons and leauing the whole countrey of southhollande tooke the way to harlem and amsterdame

but when they found the gates shutte vppon them they marched towardes vtright where they hoped to be payed so that the countrey of hollande for that tyme through the great goodnesse of god was quite and cleane rid of those enemies

when the spanyardes and their companye were arryued the eighte of december before vtright the lorde of hierges floion and baldez proclaymed them his maiesties enemies by which meane it was lawefull for the citizens to kill as many of them as they could catch for perfourming wherof a litle eutreatie would haue serued wherfore the spaniardes hadde brought that day with them pytch strawe and goonpowder to set weerd gate on fier but the citizens valyantlye salying out of the towne so brauely repulsed them as that they slewe about fiftye spanyardes
but not being contented herewith they the
of the sayd moneth about the day breake issued out of the ditches with their eletto iohn bianco to scale sainte ratherines gate some of them hauing entred before day slew certein of ye watch howbeit ye said iohn bianco hauing swron yt he would enter vtright either aliue or dead after he had a good

auntly defended him selfe against the mightie multitude of the citizens

he was there by mayne force of armes slaine and all his companye beaten backe and dryuen from the rampars
for the cytizens were so flesht on them and therby so enbouldened against them and they of the castle so holpe the spanyardes by the annoying of the citizens with their great ordenance as that there were but
spaniardes laid on gods deare earth

nowe after that the leydens had first thanked god and next his excellency as before hath beene sayde they thanked also the admyrall boysot and presented him with a chayne of golde hauing hanging at it a great picture of gold
the estates also of hollande gaue vnto the sayde admyrall a chaine of golde woorth sixe hundred florins
when the great commandator of castille sawe that leyden was ayded against the opinion of all the worlde and that his people were merueilouslye miscontented hee sente his deputies in december
vnto his excellency and to the estates of holland and zeland about the communication of a peace which was graunted him and the assembly appoynted to be at breda

when the emperour heard of this hee sent in februarye
the count of swartsenbrough to the sayde treatie of peace where the sayde count as a mediatour sought by all meames possyble to conclude it on eyther side

but whyles the sayde prince and estates of hollande and zelande stoode siyflye for the keeping of the exercise of the reformed relygion and that the sayde commandator would not agree thereto this conferrence and assemblie broke of and did nothing

the spaniardes besieging the towne and castle of buren

was by the gouernour of the said towne without any battery yeelded vp wherefore the estates of holland woulde haue put him to death howbe it the prince for al that sent him to the castle of gaude there to be safe kept

the

of iune his excellencye marryed at the briell the most famous princesse charlotte of bourbon duke montpensier his daughter the very true myrrour of all vertue

as the spaniardes were besieging the towne of oldwater the eight of august his excellencie arriued at gaud

and caused the dykes to be gauged that the fieldes might bee laide vnder the water for the raysing of the spaniards campe
which when the enemie vnderstood furiously battered the town with ye canon made a breach and foorthwith gaue the assault so that at the thirde attempt the towne was taken and at their entrie they slue all the citizens and souldeers and burnt the greater parte thereof

the
of the saide moneth

as the enemie vppon the soden encamped before the towne of scoonhoue his excellencie sent thither the captaine of the guarde a french colonel a man very well experimented as well in warre like affayres as in matters of state who had very faithfully doone to the said prince and estates of holland and zealand many good offices and seruices

and although that this towne was no way able to holde out both by reason of the weake rampares as also because of the faint hearts of many of the citizens yet this colonel so nobly saued his honour as that hee attended all the day long for the assault where a breach through the force of
canons was made paces broade
but the next morrow although hee wanted able men for defence yet hee in such sort repaired the rampares breach as that hee made an honorable peace sauing his people both with bag and baggage

the great conunendator beeing assisted by the treason of certaine hollanders passed

contrary to the opinion of the whole world at a low water marke through the iles of saint anne philippeslant and duuelant the
of september the yere aforesaid where gouernour boysor was slaine
after that hee tooke by assault and force the fort of bommenem but not without the great losse of his spaniardes and then encamped before the towne of ziericksea

the eleuenth of februarie
the prince wanne crympen fort which greatly auayled him for by it he preserued kept swyndright and all the rest of the places nere aboute roterodame and dordright

during these exploits

the commandator died at bruxelles the fift of march of the plague wherefore the gouernment of the countrie was committed by his maiesties appointment to the handes of the councell of estate

in may the yeere aforesaid

ziericksea was by reason of famine rendred to the spaniardes although all the hollanders zealanders had done what they could to helpe and reuictuall it but all was in vaine
the spaniards at that time beginning againe to mutine for their pay thought to haue surprised brurelles for they presumed to haue good store of butin there
howbe it when the citizens hearde of it they so well looked about them

as that master spaniard went without his purpose wherfore they tooke the way to alost where they entred without any resistaunce in the end of iuly dealing with the citizens as if the towne had been taken by assault sacking and iniuring the as if they had been their enemies

the estates of brabant considering of the outrages infolences and rebellion of the spanish souldiers complamed of the to the councell of estate but where they thought they shoulde haue been punished the councell bare most with them although for the further abusing of the said estates

they were by the saide councell proclaimed rebels against his maiestie and the lowe countries without setting any other order in the matter which caused a generall reuolt of all the low countries an vnion of holland and zealand with the rest of the prouinces as more at large shalbe set foorth in the fourth booke of these histories

the ende of the third booke

the fovrth booke of the histories of troubles wherein shall bee set foorth the vtter reuolte of all the lowe countries and the vnion of the estates with holland and zealand and many other thynges thereon ensuyng

now the estates of brabant as in the booke next before hath beene declared beyng not well pleased with the iniurious dealyng of the spanyards and the little care that the counfell of estate had certaine of the prelattes therefore sett doune a decree the
of september
that the lorde of heze captaine of the citie of bruxelles and glymes with the ayde of the citizens should apprebende the counsell when thei were altogether at the court

and be taken as prisoners by the estates of brabant whiche thyng was executed but especially vpon those whiche were suspected to be enemies to their countrie supporters of the spanyards as namely the countes of maussield and barlmunt the counsellour assonuille and the secretaries berty and schaberge who were lead all prisoners together

when these men were thus apprchended monsier the duke of aniowe the sunne of fraunce and onely brother to the ryng beyng required by certaine persons of aucthoritie in the name of the estates of brabant that it would please hym to accept and receiue them into his protection against the tyrrannie of the spanyardes which in deede be did and to that ende made preparation for the warres verely mondyng to aide them
and in the meane while the estates aforesaied of brabant greatly solycited the rest of the princes of the lowe countries to ioyne with them for the driuyng and beatvng out of the spanyardes and other forraine and straunge from out of the saied countries
and the first whiche ioed them were

naulters by the aduise and counsell of the renneberge and the barron frezin
thei of flaunders lyle doway artois and the rest of the prouinces ioyned likewise with them and treated together of an euerlastyng vnion

now as the spanyardes traueiled this waie and that in the countrie of brabant committyng many wronges glymes was sent with certaine ensignes and about sixe hundred horse in poste to surprise the spanyardes whiche laie betweene louaine and dielmunt how bee it the spanyardes put hym to flight where was slaine the captaine of delft who so valiantly defended hymself with his souldiers as that this victorie cost the spanyardes the settyug on

sone after the spanyards went towards mastright where through the vnfaithfull dealyng and cowardise of the almaines

thei entred who she wed them selues the very slaues to the spanyardes tyrannie forgettyng the auncient honour of the name almaine whiche tyme the spanyardes sacked and accordyng to their olde maner of dealyng committed all tyrannie and villanie

in the ende of october monsier champagny beyng gouernour of the citie of antwerpe

agreed with the estates and so did likewise the count ouersceine with his almaines and thereupon the estates sent thether the marques of hawre count egmunt and monsier beercele with a iollie companie of souldiers for preseruation and defence of the saied citie against the force of the spanyardes then liyng in the castle
but when sacho of auila captaine of the saied castle had sent for the spanyardes whiche laie at aloft and mastright and were all gotten together into the same strength the
of nouember
thei in great furie set vpon the toune where the citezens did the best thei could to preserue it but what through the cowardise of the almaines and the treason of cornelius vaneynd who laie in the toune with fower ensignes of almaines as also by reason of the wilfull negligence of the leaders in the ende the flowre of all the cities in europe was sacked a greate number murdered and the triumphant toune house set on fire whereupon euery quarter rounde about it was dissolued into ashes so that an inestimable treasure of all kinde of marchaundize

was therein consumed ouer and besides the horrible and greeuous villanies committed bothe by the spanyardes and traiterous almaines

whiche horrible dealyng when the estates of the
prouinces alreadie vnited vnderstood who right well knew to their cost the spanyardes olde canckred malice towardes the lowe countries treated a peace with the prince of orenge and the estates of holland and zealand the

after that the accorde and pacification

bothe of the one side and of the other was concluded vpon the count de reusse gouernour of flanders besieged the castle of gant in the custodie of ye spanyardes who hauyng gotten from my lorde the prince helpe bothe of men artillarie and munition had many daies together battered the same
whither also came the count de lalayng generall of the armie in the absence of the duke of arscot and the marques of haurech and battered the saied castle in twoo sundrie places
now when the breaches were made and that the spanyardes desired to come to a parle the colonell of the ward was deputed by the lordes to talke with them but when as thei could not agree about their armour and weapon monsire de la motte promised the besieged the worthe of them wherevpon thei yeelded them selues with the sauftie of their bodies and gooddes the
of nouember

in this meane while

the almaines beganne to prepare them them selues to goe from valencia meanyng to treate of some secrete and cunnyng enterprises and newe treasons with the spanyardes that were in the castle
for the meeting and crossyng of whiche deuise the generall estates sent thether the count of of renneberge baron de ville gouernour and captaine general of haynault in the absence of monsire de lalaing who although he had but a regiment of eight ensignes of wallons yet he so valiauntly pursued the assault as that the saied almaines departed the toune vpon composition the
of nouember euery souldier hauyng a doller to his share
and sone

after that he was entred into the towne he with the helpe of the honest citizens besieged the castle wherein were
spanyardes whom he enforced to yeeld and vpon composition giue ouer and leaue the place in the moneth and yere aforesaied

the
of nouember the wallons whiche laie in garnison at broening takyng parte with the estates there fell a controuersie betweene them and their captaine monsire de billy the succease whereof was this

when men wisely consider and weigh the secrete iudgement of god thei are to call to mynde the wordes of the kyngly prophet dauid saiyng if the lorde keepe not the citie the watch men watche in vaine
but although we daiely see many and soudrie examples thereof yet fell there out here the
of nouember
and diuers daies after at groening in frisela~d a most manifest example of the same
for after that the miserable couetous and bloody spanyards had as it were for the space of ten yeres vsed in all the countreis there about their arrogancie tyrannie and loose life and had murdered spoyled and robbed the honest enhabitauntes of those countreis defloured their wiues and daughters and through intollerable exactions drawne drye their great ritches spoiled their trades and occupations and that which is most vile deuilishe had driuen out of the countrie the greater parte of the honest and godly people and meant euen presently

to take as their owne proper enheritance all the countreis houses cities burroughes castles gold siluer and all other moueable goodes but especially to bryng the men into stauerie braggyng and boastyng that all the
prouinces and what soeuer was within them was giuen them for a spoyle yet it so fel out now as that the almightie god of his grace and mercie had so opened the eyes of some of the estates as that thei would no longer abide their ouer greate loosenesse tyrannie and pride but sett them selues flatly against it
when the spanyards and hispaniolized almaines and wallons who were with the spanishe brutishe tyrannie

loosenesse and arrogancie and were become spanishe confederates sawe this thei ioyned them selues all together in brabant at antwerpe lier mastright and certaine other places to the intent to put the estates of the countrie in feare and sow dissention amongst them

neuerthelesse when thei in the ende sawe that all this their hellishe pollicie auailed them nothyng thei vomited out all their couetousnesse and tyrannie vpon the citie of antwerpe where the greatest parte of the treasure and riches of all the lowe countreis laye besides the inestimable treasure that the almaines frenche englishe italians spanishe and easterlyng marchauntes had there committyng there a most cruell shamefull murder tooke awaie so muche wealth as that thei did his maiestie so greate hurt in his low countreis thereby as that all the seruice whiche thei shall doe hym these twentie yeres will neuer be able to counteruaile againe
whiche example colonell iasper de robles gouernour of groenyng and of westfriselande presumyng vppon and thinkyng that no man durst withstande him thought to followe and first he began at the toune of groenyng and afterward proceaded in the same countrey of groenyng and west friselande where he committed the like murder with burnyng and spoilyng and to that ende entred into the citie of groenyng howbeit the good and mercifull lorde lookyng vpon the saied toune of groenyng with the eyes of his mercie and grace merueilously and mercifully deliuered the citezeins and enhabitauntes thereof and stopped the tyrannous arrogancie and deuise of the saied colonell as hereafter shall bee declared

the saied iasper de robles lorde of billy caused an othe of fidelitie to be ministred of ferdinando lopes and other captaines as monceau and champi and also to their seriauntes corporelles and officers by whiche othe he would haue them sworne to hym in the name of his maiestie to be for the space of three monethes good and faithfull aboute whatsoeuer businesse he should employe them and saied that he would in the meane while sende into spaine to his maiestie to knowe whether it were his highnesse pleasure and will or not that the countreis and cities should growe to an attonement with the prince of orenge and that if it were so his maiesties will that then he would also doe as the reste of the countries and cities thereaboutes did but yet he trusted that in the meane tyme he would hee maister of the treasure and wealthe of all the countrey of groenyng and westfreseland by sackyng and spoilyng of them

whiche othe the saied colonell iasper de robles offered also the
of nouember to captaine losy by whiche he would had hym sworne to bee faithfull vnto hym for that helping of hym aboute the accomplishyng of whatsoeuer he should make him priuie vnto
captaine losy perceiuyng the condition to bee verie harde about whiche he had moued hym vnto saied
that he could not bee sworne to any suche thyng before suche tyme as he had made his seriauntes and corporelles priuie of it whiche aunswere draue the colonell into so greate heate and choler as that he forthwith sent for the seriauntes and corporelles of losy his companie offeryng to them also the saied othe howbeit thei had no luste to hearken vnto it neither saiyng that thei were sworne to his maiestie nine yeres paste

whiche thei meant faithfully to keepe vntill suche tyme as his maiestie should haue discharged them of it where withall the saied colonell was merueilously greeued and asked the seriaunt maior named gautier what he meant to doe giuyng hym the penne in his hande to subscribe vnto the saied othe
but the saied seriaunt rastyng the penne into the fire saied vnto hym that he had rather dye then he would subscribe vnto suche an othe and so saied also the other scriaunt and corporell of whiche one of them hight mobill
the colonell beeyng greatly moued with this aunswere saied vnto them
well get you hence see well inough what must doe with you all thei aunswered againe pacience perforce

after this resolution the aforesaied twoo seriauntes and corporalles assembled all the rest of captaine losy his corporalles and agreed that euery of theim should propounde to his souldiers all that the colonell had saied to the ende thei might therby knowe their entent and purpose and then that thei would once more assemble theim and conclude vpon that whiche thei meant from thenceforthe to doe whiche speeche when the corporalles had deliuered ouer to their souldiers thei aunswered all with one voice that thei were also resolued to make none other othe and therefore would hazard together their bodies and liues one for an other which aunswere when the corporalles had made relatio of thei sent for the seriaunts of captaine villers companie who warded that daie to come vnto them to whom thei declared the wordes whiche the colonell had imported vnto

them and the answere which thei receiued from their souldiers demaundyng of theim their ententes and meanyng wherevnto captaine villers seriauntes aunswered that thei were of the same opinion and would liue and dye with them
then thei concluded to apprehende the colonell and preuent hym knowyng well inough that the colonell would not a so that in case after that the watche was sette and thei separated that he would preuent theim
wherefore thei commaunded all those souldiers whiche went to the watche not once any man to discharge his peece before suche tyme as the seriauntes and corporalles commaunded them

all this while there came no sleape in the colonelles eye but caused the greate ordinaunce to bee charged with haile shotte and planted it in the streate where the souldiers should passe to and fro to the watche commaundyng ferdinando lopes to be ready with his souldiers in order of battaill and forthewith so soone as the greate ordinaunce was discharged to fall vppon captaine losy his souldiers

but one of captaine villers seriauntes vnderstandyng of this deuise aduertised losy his ensigne hereof as he was marchyng on to the watche wherevpon thei marched an other waie and as thei came before the colonell his lodgyng thei did not once discharge a peece neither yet vsed their accustomed reuerence to the colonell in so muche that the maister of the watche cried out vnto theim to discharge their peeces howbeeit the souldiers flatly aunswered that would not except thei were first paied for their pouder and shot vpon whiche aunswere captaine of the watche after his old maner would haue laied vppon the souldiers whiche thei seeyng cried arme arme and then the captaine of the watche fledde
then captaine losy smote hymself on the breast and saied my beloued souldiers dispatche now your enterprise whiche thing captaine villers companie seyng as thei were commyng from the ward ioyned theim selues with the reste and criyng out saiyng bee of good cheare my gallauntes for we will ue and dye with you and swore by and by that thei would helpe one an other openly shewyng that thei meant to apprehend the

when ferdinando lopes who was verse carefull about his businesse sawe that the souldiers whiche came from the ward

came not the woonted waie whiche caused that his enterprise tooke no effecte and hearyng the greate noyse got hym in haste to horse criyng out and askyng what the matter was thinking thereby to appaise the souldiers but thei so brauely halsed him with harquebouze shotte as that he made suche speede awaie that his hatte fell from his hed and commyng to ebbyng streate where his souldiers stoode in order of battaill lighted from his horse and thinkyng to haue marched on with his people to helpe the colonell he was no soner come with theim to the corner of the same streate and his souldiers seeyng the twoo companies of losy and villers standyng in order of battaill but that thei cried with a lustie courage all whole noble mates all whole we will with one minde and consent take suche parte as you dooe
when ferdinando lopes see how this geare fell out he ranne into a hog stie in a bakers house to saue himself and his souldiers pulde their ensigne from the staffe and teare it all in peeces and ioyned with the twoo ensignes of losy and villers and sweare that thei would with al their hartes and in very deede liue and dye with them
and afterward thei went all together to the colonell his lodgyng with a greate alarme biddyng hym come out
the colonell beeyng greatly amazed with this trouble and noyse came to the gate and with his hatte in his hande saied louyngly vnto theim my beloued and faithfull souldiers content your selues and tell me what it is that you would haue and if it bee money promise you that you shall haue it within this three daies vsyng these and many other suche like woordes vnto them

then saied the souldiers vnto hym

as for our paye wee doubt not of it but in the meane while thou shalt be our prisoner giuyng hym many reprochfull wordes as callyng hym vile villaine and traitour and so lead hym to the towne house where customably waited the chiefe warde and from thence thei went to seigniour rushbrooke his lodgyng his sonne in lawe whom thei also tooke as a prisoner giuyng hym likewise many vile wordes
when the saied rushbrooke sawe this disorder he did what he could to appaise the souldiers saiyng my good souldiers and companions in armes praie you bee contented and you shall see that my father in lawe will paie you your

whole dueties
how beit all these wordes went for no payment but caried hym on to accompanie the colonell companie

when thei had thus doen thei tooke also fower moe captaines to wit losy villers moncean and champi and their ensigne bearers
after this thei went to the brake where thei were wonted to bee tortured and corrected when thei had misused them selues or committed any offence and there with harquebouze shotte and hatchettes thei beate doune and cut in sunder the cordes and instrumentes wherewith the strappado was giuen them and cariyng them to the market place set them on fire and cried with a loude voyce and lustie courage

god saue the prince of orenge and the estates
and vntill then the citizens were in a greate maze fearing that suche a like mischiefe would haue fallen vppon them as fell vppon mastright and antwerpe
but after thei had heard that noyse and out crye their hartes were wonderfully eased and gladded

this being doen the souldiers went to the prouosts house or deputie for the estates of the lowe countreis named francis martini stella whom the colonell hymself had tortured

and being hurt in his torture remained still prisoner and because thei could not in that heate finde the keyes of the iron stockes thei with the force of an iron barre brake them vp and gott out his armes and legges and lead him to the comptroller his lodgyng and after thei had put a redd scarfe about his necke thei lead hym to the market place amongst all the souldiers where thei all sware vnto the saied francis martini as deputie and in the name of the estates to liue and dye with the estates
ouer and besides all this thei sent the said deputie accompanied with certaine citizens in the behalfe of the towne and certaine in the behalfe of the souldiers to bruxelles to declare vnto the count this historie requiryng some order to be set doune vnder whiche thei might from thence foorth be gouerned

when thei had this doen thei sent
souldiers to seigniour fafcus lodgyng the spanyarde colonell of zurphen

and not findyng hym there thei went from thence to the couent of the franciscanes where thei diligently sought for hym with candles in their handes
how beit thei could not finde hym because

he was gotten into a friers cowle with beard and head shauen and shorne and hym self with a candle in his hande seekyng as diligently for hym self as the souldiers did vntill suche tyme as an other frier an almaine discouering fascus and pointing hym out saied here is a frier of our order but none of our couent whiche wordes when he perceiued that the souldiers vnderstoode not he againe saied iesus est tenete eum that is to saie that is the man and therefore holde hym fast
then thei layd holde on him and brought him in his friers cowle to the market place where thei made an example of hym in the sight of all the world

saiyng that thei had recouered a new bishoppe vsing these and suche other like reprochfull and skoffyng wordes on hym
and afterwarde thei for that night set the watche and the next morrowe proclamation was made by the sounde of the dromme that whosoeuer had lodged and hidd captaine ferdinando lopes the prouost and captaine of the warde should bewraie them vpon paine of losse bothe of bodie and goodes and his house to be set an fire
so that by this meanes the prouost was founde in the chimney of the curates house and had to prison and lodged in one of the dungeons thereof but when thei could not finde the captaine of the warde thei sought for hym at the stewes where for the most parte he was wonted to lye and because thei founde hym not there thei tooke an whore named long alice and bindyng her with their matches saied vnto her thou vile baudie drabbe tell vs where thy housband is vsing these and many suche other like reprochfull wordes vnto her
then went thei to the frierie where the captaine of the ward had lodged the night before and asking one of the friers for hym

thei because he could tell them no tidynges of hym coupled hym fast to the saied alice and so ledd them bothe together through the streates for a spectacle but because thei could get nothyng out of the frier what was become of hym thei vncoupled hym and tt hym goe and left the whore amongest the young boyes whom thei so vilely besmeared with myre and dirte as the like had not been seene many yeres before

and after that thei had likewise gotten doctour westenthorpe

notwithstanding all the protestations that he could make to the souldiers willyng them to haue a good regard what thei

did and take good heede how thei made hym a prisoner beyng his maiesties seruaunt yet had thei hym to the tauerne and there saied vnto hym if the colonell be ryng of spayne then art thou in deede the king of spaynes seruaunt otherwise thou art seruaunt to a villaine and traitour to thy countrie and for thy seruyng of suche a kyng and maister thou shalt receiue the like hire

in this meane while came the rest of the souldiers with ferdinando lopes criyng out and saiyng

we haue brought the hangman of groening and first thei caried hym to the towne house and afterwarde to the iacobin friers where the rest of the captaines were kept in prison
and the third daie thei found the captaine of the ward in a priestes gabberdine whom thei laied in one of the dongeous of the prison to accompanie the colonell of groenyng and fascus

on mondaie came the ther the companie which lay at dam

bryngyng with them their captaine and his ensigne prisoners and marchyng by night eutred into groenyng the next daie in the mornyng where the souldiers by othe ioyned them selues with the rest vnto the estates
the same very dase the souldiers tooke mepsque liutenaunt of groenyng and caused hym to bee guarded with fiftie souldiers in his owne house

vpon tewesdaie at night when the watche was sett the souldiers of delftes isie came to groenyng

and brought their captaine barnicourt and his ensignes prisoners
the same daie came twoo franciscanes to demaunde of the liutenaunt the cowle whiche fascus ware when he was taken the lintenaunt aunswered that he had nothyng to saie to the matter
wherevpon thei went to the souldiers who aunswered the friers that the was where it muste remaine for thei we dare not once laye handes vpon so holie a thyng and besides that the confession of the colonell and the rest was to bee heard and should goe to bruxelles with the saied coule

on wednesdaie came a messenger from the lieutenaunt to the toune clarke callyng for a passeport that he might goe out of the toune whiche made the toune clarke suspecte the matter wherefore be was taken and examined secret letters

were found about hym from the lieutenant mepsque conteinyng many secret thinges of greate importaunce

this beyng doen there was a staie made of all thynges vntill the retourne of those whiche were sent to bruxelles for the doyng of all matters accordyngly as the estates should finde to be necessarie for the peace and quiet of the countrey

when the estates had set an order about these thynges thei gaue vnto the count rennenberg

the dignitie and office of this robles and sent hym thether for the orderyng of those affaires whiche he so wisely handeled as that after the souldiers were paied the toune of groenyng and all the countrey of friselande submitted them selues vnder the obedience of the estates
and the castle which was now built for a strength was by the appointment of the count rennenberg vtterly defaced and razed

in ianuarie

the scottes whiche were in paie vnder the estates vnder the conduct of their colonell baufour meetyng at the foote bale within a myle of liege were so brauely skirmished withall by the spanyardes as that a greate sort of them were left dead in the place and the rest fled awaie

the prince of orenge and the estates of hollande and sealande hauyng receiued the copie of the saied perpe tuall edicte make protestation vnto the pointes and articles of the peace of don ihon as followeth

the prince of orenge and the estates of hollande and sealande hauyng seen letters of credite whiche letters on the behalfe of my lordes the estates of the lowe countreis hereaboute by the lorde wileruall and maister paule bush aduocate of hollande accompanied with the lordes the ambassadours of the emperour who were herevnto instanly required are shewed to his excellencie by whiche my lordes the estates demaunde aduise and aunswere vnto certaine articles framed in forme of a perpetuall edict in the kynges name tending to the vmon of the countreis here about and by don ihon of austriche to theim for that purpose deliuered haue aunswered and by these also doe aunswere that thei as concernyng the saied articles doe greatly praise and commende the holy zeale good meanyng and intent whiche the saied lordes of the estates declare theim selues to haue for the reducyng againe of our poore and miserable countrey vnto suche a desired tranquilitie and vnion greatly assuryng them selues that thesaied lordes of the estates seke herein nothyng els but the deliueraunce of the poore afflicted enhabitauntes from the greate pouertie and miserie wherein thei are as it were cleane ouer hedde and eares by the cruell and insupportable eyrrannie of the proude spanishe nation and their ill ordered gouernement and that for the obseruation of the auncient priuiledges lawes and francheses thei had set a good and sure order to the ende thei might not hereafter fall into the like inconuenience but principally in approchyng fully and wholly by the saied articles vnto the laste pacification made at gaunt the
of nouember laste past so that thei haue in all their matters and protestation alwaies promised and also made commendable actes and worthie perpetuall memorie neuerthelesse after that the renowmed and worthy prince together the estates of hollande and sealande had from point to point taken in hande to peruse the aforesaied articles and had accordyng to the extreame necessitie of the matter consideratly weighed them as in deede our predecessours in the like case neuer wonted to forget the obtainyng of all newe and commendable priuiledges at their lordes and princes handes thei were fully persuaded that by thesaied articles

the zeale and desire of the lordes of the estates aboue declared was not as yet throughly satisfied
for first it seemeth that the saied auncient priuiledges of the countreis whiche thei would in all poinctes wrongfully defende are verie preiudiciall bothe because that the libertie of the assemblyng of the generall estates to whom of right it aunciently apperteineth is thereby quite and cleane taken from them and also because the estates are driuen to a newe bond and othe not to be vsed
and this maie easely appeare in the newe infringyng of the priuiledges euen by the iniuste detainyng of the countie buren who in the open sight of all men was contrary to lawe reason and the priuiledges of the countrey carried cleane awaie whiche ought so muche the more to bee considered of seyng that the saied priuiledges in so iollie a beginnyng and treatie which should expresly haue tended to the confirmation and aduauncyng of theim are thereby deminisshed and lessoned in a perticuler persone that neuer offended whiche dealyng offereth small hope of obseruyng the priuiledges with the people and cities in generall when as euery light occasion will easely bee made rebellion and treason against theim
and besides euery man that will not bee wilfully blinde faieth that the laste pacification made at gaunt about the causes aforesaied is broken the infringyng whereof is the verie breake necke of all together and therefore it is euident wherevnto the saied articles tende because the allowyng and ratefiyng of the saied pacification is not so clearely and perfectly made as the weightinesse of suche a thyng requireth but wholly hangeth vpon certaine restraintes and interpretations wheron maie ensue muche deceipte and craftie dealyng consideryug that the articles are altogether like vnto those whiche in the tyme of the duchesse of parma were the causes of suche an horrible effusio of blood against whiche the deputies of the prince of drenge and the estates of hollande and sealande made open protestation and caused also a publicque acte bothe of their acceptation and also of the counsaile of estate to bee likewise made

and besides sithe the prince and estates of hollande and sealande findyng therein certaine pointes whiche to them seemeth to be so preiudiciall to the honour of their countrey as that

thei feare to runne into an euerlasting infamie and shame because we our selues doe not onely thinke them whiche haue so villainously handled and sacked vs but doe also ioyne hande in hande with them so that we by a commission publickly declared by the aucthoritte of his maiestie and of the estates of the holy empire haue accused our selues to be villaines and rebelles with all those whiche haue made alliaunce and confederacie with the spanyardes and that whiche is more wee haue wittyngly and gladly suffered our iewelles golde siluer money marchandrise and extorted exactions to bee caried out of our countrey without any gainsaiyng
and besides thei perswade the prince and the estates of hollande and sealande that thei haue not fully discharged their honour and thankfulnesse in the saied articles vnto the queene of englandes highnesse and to monsire the duke the french kynges brother who vnto vs in the time of neede had shewed their good affection for the freeyng of vs from the oppression and wherein wee were seeyng that bothe reason and occasion sufficiently required to comprehende them therein with more expresse and honorable articles
lastly it is not to be founde in the saied articles that any assuraunce is graunted vnto the enhabitauntes of holland and sealand sithe that at the treatie of breda thei had a more fitt and reasonable offer made them whiche thyng thei also in the ende greatly required at the pacification of gant had it not been that their deputies declared bothe by mouthe and writyng that thei would in no wise treate with any other then with the saied estates shewyng thereby how roundly on their behalfe thei then proceeded
protestyng that if so thei meant to receiue don ihon of austriche and deale with hym in suche sorte as now thei haue that thei would haue demaunded an other maner of assuraunce as in very deede thei had good occasion
and besides that as there was no mention made in these articles for their safetie and assurance no more also was there any forwardnes of any matter set doune wherby any ma should be restored to his goodes possessions estate gouernement as in many other places both in the countreis there aboutes and also in the countie of burgondy it was whiche notwithstandyng accordyng to the pacification the same point in the said treatie which the generall estates at that tyme

could not bee expresly declared ought to haue beene conditioned and couenaunted
moreouer neither could there be any assurance perceiued to bee made for the rest of the countreis and prouinces nor yet for the poore commonaltie of the same
for there was no mention at all therein made about the pullyng doune of the cytadelles or castles by reason of whiche as all men well enough know proceeded many mischiefes neither yet any plaine declaration of the forgettyng and forgiuyng of that that was alreadie passed no nor yet of that whereof mention is made in the saied articles whiche dealyng made the people very suspicious because that thei beyng openly threatned in the last assemble at huy ought to haue beene well assured for the tyme to come seeyng the countrey was vnarmed and don ihon of austriche appointed to be gouernour consideryng also there with that the former examples plainely enough shewed the sequele of some suche like thyng
and againe it seemed that for this tyme thei meant to ioyne him onely with the generall estates but as ioynt gouernours that thei might thereby depriue the people of all meanes wherewith hereafter to be able to assure them selues against the ill will of hym whom thei entended to appoinct ouer them as gouernour
to bee shorte there were yet many moe poinctes whiche the princes and the estates of hollande and sealande thought necessarie to be well weighed and considered of and therefore euery of them meant to set doune the same perticulerly by them selues in writyng and sende them to the lords of the estates declaryng vnto them that the prince and estates of hollande and sealande were fully perswaded that it was now high tyme to followe the examples of our predecessors to the ende that the priuiledges lawes and franchises whiche thei left behind vnto vs might with one consent and by this good oportunitie now at hande offered bee augmented so that thei might neuer hereafter fall againe into the like inconueniences
but whiles thei made some staie about the setting doune of these articles in writyng a copie of lettees was brought vnto them whiche the lordes of the estates had written to don ihon of austriche by whiche thei perceiued that the lordes of the estates were fully determined to conclude and make an ende without tariyng for aunswere from the prince and estates of

hollande and zealande with don ihon of austriche requiring hym to signe them and promising that thei would proclaime them and receiue don ihon of austriche into the countreis as gouernour
whereupon when the prince and estates of hollande and sealande sawe this alteration thei greatly marueiled consideryng that the date of the saied letters which was also brought them in post beare the very same date as it were that the lorde of wileruall arriued
for thei were out of all doubt fully perswaded and thought thei should so sinde it that in a treatie of suche importaunce and weight whereon depended the whole welfare or ruine of all the lowe countreis thei had greatly ouer shotte them selues
neuerthelesse seeyng that thei thinke and constantly beleeue that it is so muche the rather doen for the riddyng of the spanyardes and other forrainers out of the countrie thei could not but wishe and with all their hartes doe wish and praie to god that the end maie be suche as all good defenders of their countries hope and looke for
and as for them selues sithe it were now in vaine to yeelde reasons against thynges concluded vppon and ended thei promise and doe assure the lordes of the estates to pursue and defende by all meanes possible the pacification concluded vpon at gant liuyng in good hope also the same to be the meanyng likewise of the lordes of the estates and therefore doe beseeche them in all places to shewe that thei for their parte are in very deede readie to doe the like

and to the ende that euery man might in truthe see that thei haue none other purpose but to ridd awaie the spanyardes and the rest of the forrainers and seeke nothyng els but the procuryng of peace and restablishing of certaine priuiledges lawes and franchises of the countreis thei are contented to accept and subscribe of and to the saied articles if it shall please my lordes of the estates first to promise firmely and irreuocably it and thereupon passe their deede obligatorie and the same to bee also subscribed by the gouernours chiefe officers and colonelles of all the prouinces that seyng the tyme agreed vppon with don ihon of austriche for the driuyng awaie of the spanyardes is now expired to call to a reckonyng vpon suche a daie of this moueth as the estates shall appoint all suche spanyardes as are not yet departed the countreis there aboutes and

my lordes the estates for the auoidyng once againe of all delaies whiche vnto this daie haue been so preiudiciall to cut of and suspende all further communication and treatie with don ihon of austriche and consequently with force of armes lustely pursue the insolent and proude spanyardes without meanyng for euer after any more to enter into communication or treatie whatsoeuer with them
and besides that it would please them not to passe and communicate the like acte and deede obligatorie in forme and maner of an agreement otherwise then that after the departure of the straungers neither thei nor yet the said gouernours chieftaines and colonelles to accept of don ihon of austriche or any other as gouernour vntill suche tyme as he shall haue restored into their auncient estate whatsoeuer made against the prestinate priuiledges lawes and franchises of the countreis or otherwise against the pacification of gaunt by whiche all and euery person and persons whatsoeuer are to bee restored to their gooddes and possessions aswell in burgundie as also in the rest of the countreis there aboutes and that all the saied priuiledges and franchises shall be confirmed as the lordes of the estates in the ende of the saied pacification of gaunt by the letters of the
of october
written to their deputies had solemply promised

giuen at middlebrough the

and subscribed by willyam of nassou and a little beneath by the ordenaunce of the estates of hollande and sealande
and subscribed by faymon

the aunswere of the generall estates vpon the protestation of the prince of orenge
and of the estates of hollande and sealande

the first daie of marche

the lordes of the generall estates thereaboutes hauyng seen the writyng of the prince of orenge and of the estates of hollande and sealande exhibited vpon the agreement betweene don ihon of austriche knight of the golden fleese and the generall estates of the lowe countreis the
of februarie


the said generall estates pronounce and declare that their intent and purpose hath alwaies been and yet is to maintaine and keepe in deede and truthe the pacification made at gaunt in nouember laste betweene the saied prince his excellencie the estates of hollande and sealande and their confederates and the saied generall estates and emongest the reste that thei also entended to cause all thynges to bee redressed whiche thei shall finde out of order and contrary aswell to the generall as to the perticular priuiledges lawes franchises and customes of the lowe countreis and by force of armes likewise driue out of the lowe countries all the spanishe italian and bourgonion souldiers according to the conformitie of the saied accord if so be the saied souldiers bee not in deede gone out of the lowe countreis by the tyme prefixed and accordyngly as thei were expressely commaunded by his highnesse without any further lookyng to other treatie or communication about the deferryng any waie of the retraicte of the saied spanyardes and seeyng that the liutenauntes of the prouinces chieftaines and colonelles of the men of warre are bounde to doe the like we require them also with the same resolution to subscribe for the whiche cause this present acte is dispatched and by the ordenaunce of the saied generall estates subscribed by the secretarie of brabant the daie and yere abouesaied

and accordyng to the agreement the spaniardes

by the appointment of don ihon who otherwise could not bee receiued vnto the gouernement departed the citie and castle of antwerpe the
of marche
with greate butin and spoyle
whiche castle was deliuered ouer vnto the duke of arscot who placed there for his lieutenaunt the prince of chimay his sonne to the greate likyng of the whole worlde because he was a verie noble yong prince and suche a one as in whom was great hope of good
and although the castle and citie of antwerpe were freed of the spanyardes italians and bourgonions yet were thei still kept in subiection for the kynges almaines and suche as assisted the spanyardes at the sackyng of antwerpe remained still there vnder their colonelles focquer and fro~sberg who laie there for their paie whiche was an intollerable charge to the poore citezins

the
of august in the yere aforesaied

the kyng ratified the perpetuall edict and accorde whiche don ihon had made with the estates
and the
of aprill the spaniardes departed mastright with their butin and theeuerie

don ihon hauyng hidde the subtill foxe vnder a plain cloke

entred bruxelles the first of maie
where he was receiued with greate pompe triumphe and ioye of the lordes and whole commonaltie and the fourth of the saied moneth tooke vpon him the gouernment of the countrey where he was sworne whiche othe sone after he brake

the
of iune

he departed from bruxelles to malines to talke as he saied with the colonelles and captaines of the almaines who beeyng once paied had their passeporte to departe out of the countrey after the spanyardes howbeit vnder this couler he in verie deede treated with them about the keepyng of the citie of antwerpe for hymself to the ende he might the better assure hymself of the castle in so muche that he retained the into his seruice as afterward by the interceptyng of many letters and the doynges whiche thereon ensued manifestly appeared
and for the bryngyng of this his saied purpose to passe he sent for the prince of chinay to come to hym to malines vnder a coulorable desire of his companie to the citie of namure about the tongratulation of the queene of nauarre
appointyng eftsones for his lieutenaunt in the saied castle the lorde of terlon

then departed don ihon from malines

accompanied with many noble menne whiche at that tyme were there with hym for the conueighyng of hym as gouernour of namure where he in warre like maner seised vpon the castle the
of iulie vnder the pretence of riding an huntyng
when mo~sieur de froymont gouernour of the countrey of namure a wise and stoute gentleman had tolde don ihon of his greate wrong and fault committed considering the vanitie of the act and besides that the souldiers would not remedie it by force of armes departed from hym and came to the saied estates
and the twoo brethren to wit the duke of arscot and the marques of haurech beyng noblemen of greate aucthoritie and suche as don ihon had good likyng of perceiuyng his wicked purpose

and intente and that no faire and reasonable speeches would once remoue hym from his determination refrained from co~myng to counsaile afterward any more
don ihon seyng this and fearyng the losse of them caused good espiall to be laied for them for the staiyng of them as it were howbeit for all his good watche and ward thei verie wisely without his knowledge departed from namure without any of their baggage the
of the saied monethe
and thei were no soner come to bruxelles but that thei like good patrones of their countrey went immediatly to counsell with the estates for the saluyng of this newe wounde

whiles don ihon late at namure

he solicited bothe by letters and by worde of mouthe terlon and the almaine colonelles aboute the full accomplishyng of that matter in deede whereof thei concluded emongest the selues at malines which was the supprisyng of antwerpe castle
but it tourned all to nothing by reason of the greate care paine and fidelitie of mo~sieur le bours
for by his wisedome and noble courage he so handled the matter as that he draue out the traitors and tooke terlon prisoner whom he deliuered vnto the estates the firste of august

when foueques and fronsberg heard of this it so amased them as that thei armed their people and in the euenyng withdrewe them selues to the greate market place of antwerpe but fearyng that the same would not be strong inough for them and their people thei withdrewe theim selues after midnight vnto the strongest place of the newe toune emongest the water conductes where beyng well fortefied and strengthened thei kepte them selues quiete vntill the nexte daie in the afternoone
but when thei sawe the arriuall of the prince of orenge shippes thei grewe into suche a feare as that thei forsooke the toune and fled to witte focques to bergues vpon zoom and fronsberg to breda

after that the estates besieged the castle of waue

where in foucquers regiment of almaines laie but the
of the said moneth it was rendered by composition to monsieur de champigni generall of the field at that present for the estates and so were likewise the tounes of thole and stonebergue the

of the saied moneth and yere

the
of august an alarme was giuen to the castle of leeward

into whiche captaine mattenes wylisma had take moe newe souldiers then his owne thinkyng thereby to haue taken some of the magistrates
howbeeit the newe souldiers vnder captaine wybe of goutum got to bee maisters of the castle parforce so that by the same meanes arose a greate alarme by reason that the souldiers were all in armes one against an other whervpon the citezens also got the to armes fearyng the toune had been surprised and so besieged the castle whiche the souldiers afterward rendred vnto them vppon condition that thei might be paied
then the citezeins entred into the castle the
of september and kept it vntill the gouernour monsieur de ville came

when don ihon sawe that the greate campe of the estates drewe neare to namure where he was but ill prouided of men of warre he made shewe as though he would againe treat with the estates to the ende that thereby his force might the better bee gathered together and therevpon required commissioners for that purpose
then the estates deputed for that vse the abbot of saincte gislaine wilerual grobbendocque and others who after many delaies and conferences retourned without doyng of any thing consideryng that the saied duke ihon meant nothyng els but warres

the
of august


the castle of antwerpe whiche had of long been a denne of murderers was that very daie vtttrly razed and defaced by the citezens

the
of septe~ber followyng the estates published their iustification for the takyng of armes in their defence against don ihon and withall certaine letters of don ihon whiche had intercepted wherein was conteined his treason and because thei haue been imprinted seuerally by theim selues haue left the insertyng of them at this present

the

and beyng besieged by the lord of ehampigni baron of renay generall of the fielde for the estates was taken by his owne almaines and deliuered prisoner to the saied lorde de champigni and therefore thei franckly and freely sette out of

the almaines of the count ouerstone

who laye at boisleduke beeyng besieged were forced at laste to departe vpon composition and deliuered vp the toune to the count of hohenloo generall of the field the
of september

the estates sent to the prince liyng in holland besought hym of aide and so he did for the loue he beare to his countrey

and in the ende although long firste he arriued at antwerpe the
of september where the whole multitude receiued hym with greate ioye and pleasure
the prelates of vilers and marolles with the baron of frezin and the lorde of capres were sent by the generall estates to congratulate the prince for the receiuyng and bringyng hym to bruxelles where the of the saied monethe and yere he was with greate triumphe and ioye marueilously receiued

the almaines at breda were by the estates besieged who deliueryng vp their colonell fronsberg prisoner departed vppon composition frankly and freely the
of october

the
of october the prince was chosen gouernour of brabande to the greate contentation of the whole countrey

makyng bonefiers at bruxelles in token of wonderfull ioye

after that the duke of arscot was appoincted gouernour of flanders he went to gande where the citezens and enhabitauntes louyngly receiued hym bauyng marchyng before him
ensignes of footmen and
horse she wyng all the tokens of ioy that might be
now three daies after that he was receiued as gouernour to wit the
of october thei hauyng some and vprores growyng emongest theim selues went of their owne heades to his house and tooke and ledde hym awaie prisoner to the no small greef bothe of the prince

and counsell of estate and also of the generall estates
but the
of nouember acknowledged their fault and the greate whiche thei had doen hym thei set hym free and at libertie and yet with this condition that he should forget his euill handelyng and pardon the wrong that was dooen vnto hym and neuer once thinke of it more

at the very same tyme likewise thei tooke the bishoppes of bruges and ypres the baron of rassingem the lorde of

champigni the lorde of moucron and his sonne the lorde of sueuegem and eycke

the first of nouember

the citizens and enhabitants of the citie of groening in friselande tooke certaine prelattes and gentlemen of the countrey of groening prisoners by reason of the auncient quarrell and dissention that the citie long tyme had against the countrey men
wherefore thether was sent monsire sainct aldegonde and sille by his excellencie the counsaile of estate and of the estates generall
howbeit thei could winne nothyng at the common peoples hande
neuerthelesse some of the prisoners afterwarde very craftely got out of prison and escaped out of the towne also

the
or
of nouember
appeared a fearfull comette in the lowe countreis

wherevpon ensued great sheddyng of blood and the death of don ihon

the chiefe lordes there aboutes

trustyng to mollefie the kynges harte by makyng some of his owne blood gouernour generall sent the lorde of malstede to the right high mathias archduke of austriche sonne and brother to the emperour beseechyng hym to come thether for that ende and purpose
but the archduke seyng that the emperour was afeard to displease the kyng and therefore would not consent thereto secretly departed from vienne without hauyng any bodie with hym saue the de his chiefe chamberlaine

the
daie of december
the prelates of saincte gertrude and marolles the duke of arscot and the baron of frezin presented vnto the moste famous archduke mathias the gouernement of all the lowe countreis vpon certaine conditions and articles whiche he accepted of and subscribed vnto

the citie of amstelredame

whiche would not acknowlege the prince to be gouernour as he ought to be accordyng to the pacification of gauut was by colonell helyng who very couragioufly tooke vpon hym the matter purposed to bee forcebly surprised and taken
whiche dealyng when the citezens sawe thei put them selues in armes and stoode marueilously to their defence so that the saied colonell was there staine in valiaunte fight and his people presently driuen out of the toune

the
of ianuary

the moste famous archduke mathias entred into bruxelles where beeyng the
of the saied moneth solemnely sworne was with greate magnificence appoincted gouernour of the lowe countreis
the prince also was chosen to bee his lieutenaunt generall who takyng vpon hym the charge was like wise sworne

the same moneth arriued thereabout the lorde of selles

sent from the kyng of spaine to aunswere the letters of the estates of the
of august and the
of september by whiche thei desired that don ihon might bee sent for home againe and another gouernour to be sent in his rome
then thei beganne to talke with the saied selles about the deuisyng of some meanes for peace but because the kyng confirmed the saied don ihon in gouernement and ratified the warre whiche he had begonne

all their talke was to no purpose

the laste daie of ianuary

when the campe of the estates remoued and that don ihou had by his horsemen broken the araie of the souldiers the whole campe was putte to flight about giblowe wherevpon the countrey beeyng greatly amazed with suche an vnlooked for losse as in suche distresses commonly commeth to passe the enemie tooke the tounes of giblowe louuaine arscot tielmont diest and sichem and at sichem he committed a moste barbarous crueltie against the officers of the saied place

when the duke of aniow vnderstoode of this discomfiture

he sent monsier de fougere and his secretarie to the estates to offer theim his owne persone and the meanes how to helpe them
whiche thyng beyng accepted of he sent thether the lordes of rochepot and pruneauls to the meetyng of whom were sent the count de lalayng the baron of frezin and the counsellour leifield deputies for the generall estates aboute the treatie aswell for the aidyng of the toune of as also for the thereof

now after this discomfite the toune of sainct gislaine shooke in the soket and was at the to haue fallen into the handes of don ihon by reason of the bishoppe of arras his secret intelligence howbeeit the lorde of hernisart by cunnyng got into it and so by that meanes frustred this enterprise and hauyng well prouided for the toune to the benefite of the countrey deliuered it vp into the handes of count de lalayng gouernor of hainault the seconde of february

the
of the saied moneth and yere

the toune of amstelre fell to composition with the prince and estates of hollande and reunited it self with the reste of the cities of the saied countrey vnder his excellencies gouernement vpon certaine pointes and articles but because the catholiques had not obserued the saied articles of a gremente thei of the reformed religion sent the old magistrate and franciscane friers out of the toune because thei would not agree to graunt theim of the reformed religion any libertie and besides thei had also broken that poincte of the agreement whiche was made about the cause of the sworne men

as the spanyardes laie at the siege of nyuelle

monsire de villers gouernour of the towne abode the canon and although it was not to holde out yet he so valiauntly helde out fower to wit from twelue of the clocke in the afternoone vnto seuen of the clocke at night as that the enemte made his retraict without order and afterwarde helde it two daies without parle still lookyng for ayde
in the meane while the prince and the count of bossu wrote vnto hym that he should withdrawe hymself with the sauftie of his people aswell as he could whiche thyng he did and departed thence by composition with bodies and goodes swordes and daggers and so did likewise the captames and chieftaines of the horsemen the
of february


duryng these exploites

there was an imperiall dyet appointed at wormes whether was sent monsire aldegonde counsailour for the estate by his excellencie and the estates to shewe there the estate of the affaires hereabout together for the requiryng of ayd from the empire and germaine princes their good neighbours as to people who ought to haue had some feelyng and compassion of this their greate miserie and

the estates also meanyng to make the same request to the queene of england appointed for that purpose the
of march

the marques of hawreche who so well plied his businesse as that he obtained at her maiesties handes assueraunce bothe of men and money for the aidyng of the saied estates who was also greatly honored for his owne priuate cause and besides receiued at her highnesse handes a very goodly present

the
of marche the greate counsaile of friselande was taken at leeward to witt the president ygrammes ichlum iuliers dekema peter fritzma forco bommerts leualy counsailours and many others and in their steade were appointed newe counsailours to witt maister kysinga maister fecco baida maister ihon de steueren and many others
and besides the chiefe beyng the bishoppe of leewarde was sent to the castle and also certaine counsailours whiche was taken and the rest were within their owne houses

the

ensignes

of the nine whiche laie in garnison at mastright mutyned for their paye and tooke the baron of heze their colonell and gouernour of the saied towne prisoner and all the captaines liutenauntes ensigne bearers and officers of his regiment and besides conspired to deliuer vp the towne into the handes of the enemie
but after thei had sent seigniour nycholas salmier knight lorde of melcroye with the saied payes and contented the souldiers he first of all released the prisoners and afterwarde by his and pollicie became maister of the conspirators some of whiche were drouned and some hanged and hauyng brought in an other garnison was assured thereby of the towne in the behalf of the countrey

the
of aprill

there was a newe ordenaunce published at antwerpe about the obseruation of the pacification at gant and that all the enhabitauntes and citizens there about of what estate or condition soeuer thei were should bee sworne and as many as refused the same to be taken for enemies
in so muche that all persones both ecclesiasticall and seculer tooke the same othe sauyng the iesuites who because thei would not obeye were merueilously suspected by reason whereof the common people mutyned against them
howbeit thei were for all that no waie because of the good order whiche the colonelles had set in the towne

saue onely were honestly sent out of the towne aswell for their priuate assueraunce as also beyng suspected for the benefite and saufetie of the commonweale whiche thyng was doen vpon whitsondaie
then the friers craued tyme to deliberate vppon but when thei sawe in the ende that the rest of the beggyng friers prelattes cathedrall churches and all ecclesiasticall persones were obedient to the saied commaundement thei were resolued to doe the like except the prior and three others of his couent who obstinately stood and therefore were likewise as men suspected tourned out of the toune
whiles these friers were deliberatyng what to doe some of the people that were in armes beyng not well pleased went on forwarde with the matter and would haue enforced them which their fonde dealyng the burroughmaister clerely frustred
nenerthelesse twoo of the companie beyng souldiers so farre forgott them selues as that thei helde the pointes of their swordes

before hym for the whiche thei lost their heades

the duke of aniowe

sent his men of warre vnto the borders of haynault where thei were greatly oppressed by the enemie
and the estates likewise had appointed colonell combelle to enter into the saied countrey and laie with his people at leus in haynault a towne of monsire de barlaymont whom the spanyardes commyng to set vpon were brauely repulsed and ioliilie cooled and therevpon were enforced to retire the
of

after that the spanyards had long time besieged the toune of phillippeuille it was enforced at laft

for want of victualles and munytion to yeeld vpon composition the saied
of maie

while the enemie was makyng preparation to besiege limbourg

the gouernour and souldiers demaunded victualles and munytion and promised that if thei might haue them to keepe the towne and castle
then the archduke mathias and the estates prouided for all thynges necessarie
and yet notwithstandyng thei fell to a parle with the enemie and yeelded the same place the
of iune the yere a oresaied

the duke of aniowe for the better accomplishyng of his deuise came with a small companie to mons in haynault the
of iulie howbeit his trame followed hym

the almaine souldiers of the regiment of polwyler who before the pacification of gaunt in garnison in the countrey of oueryssell in campen and deueuter refused to come thence yea thei so greatly and so long dissembled the matter as that the saied peace was broken declaryng then that thei helde the saied tounes for don ihon
whereupon the estates besieged them and first the count of rennenberge baron of ville and gouernour of friselande who was there named the generall of the fielde besieged campen and because he would lose no tyme he sommoned the toune and hauyng refused his offer made a fearfull batterie vntill suche tyme as he had made a breache howbeeit when the almaines sawe them readie to giue the assaulte thei fell to a and in the ende departed the toune the
of iuly in the yere aforesaied

the castle of haurech beyng besieged and battered by the frenche on the behalf of the duke of aniowe was yeelded vp

the
of iuly
howbeeit the spanyardes who were come the ther before for the raisyng of the siege were repulsed with greate losse of their people
and the same tyme had the duke thruste in a frenche garrison into the tounes of soignie mawbuge and reusse whiche the enemie had forsaken

when the archeduke mathias and the estates had arered a greate and mightie armie

vnder the conducte and gouernement of the count of bossu a valiaunt and stoute manne and verie warlike he pitched his campe abount rimenant in brabande whether don ihon meanyng to plaie double or quite came purposyng to set vpon the campe
howbeit this seconde enterprise had not so good successe as the first because it coste agreate number of his spanyardes liues so that he was enforced through the notable endeuour and diligence of all these who the count had sent to fight to retier where maister norris colonell of the englishmen and maister stiward of the scottes hauyng resisted and pursued the greatest of the enemie shewed theimselues so valiaunt in armes and warlike feates and so couragious and stoute as that thei carried awaie the whole praise and commendation of this victorie whiche was wone the first of august

mensire de la noue one of the valiauntest captaines that euer was in our daies accompted and in france moste famous for his notable deedes of armes was sent by the estates to be marshall of the fielde who acceptyng of this charge came to antwerpe to the greate contentation of all the men of warre

in august the yere aforesaied signiour archies beyng by his highnesse and the counsell of estate

sent to valencia to make inquisition about certain particuler matters concerning the common benefite of the saied citie there arose a greate vprore and controuersie emongest the common people the one side takyng parte with the saied archies and the other with the magistrate for remedyng and appaisyng whereof his highnesse sent thether seigniour richardot one of the priuie counsell a verie learned man accompanied with an other commissioner where through his mediation after many conferences had there was a commen and generall assemblie of the people held so that the
of august those troubles were appaised and the citezens therevpon

went forthwith euery man vnder his ensigne puttyng of their armour and weapon after thei had kept watche and ward eight daies and nightes together one against an other not without the greate daunger and hazard of a miserable and lamentatable effusion of blood

the generall estates meanyng to dooe all thynges for the best thei

to the ende thei might repulse the enemie with the greatest force treated with the duke of aniowe about that matter
the duke bounde hym self to leauie tenne thousande footemen and twoo thousande horse at his owne coste and charge for the space of three monethes and that tyme beeyng expired and the warres not ended that he would continue to aide them with thre thousande souldiers and fiue hundred horse and manifest hym self an enemie to don ihon and his adherentes wherevpon the estates named hym the defendour of the countrey promisyng further to preferre hym to all the reste if so bee thei were enforced to chaunge their lorde and prince giuyng him besides the duchie of luxembrough and the countie of bourgundie and for the sauftie of his people and hymself the tounes of landersey quesnoy and bauais besides many other articles conteined in the accord for that behalfe made and published at antwerpe in the presence of the prince the estates and aassadors of the saied duke the
of august

as the campe of the estates laie aboute twoo myles from louuaine count bossu departed thence

with twoo thousande harquebouziers and two thousande horse and commyng nere to louuaine where the enemie was either parte shooke of their shotte and coupled them selues together in a braue skirmishe
the vicount of gaunt and lanowa charged the enemie with the men at armes and chased them harde vnto the rampars sides of the towne so that some of their tippettes were there turned vp and so were diuers of the frenche likewise
the saied count had a greate desire to besiege this towne but because he wanted three or fower thousande pyoners and thirtie or fortie for the winnyng of so greate and large a towne well funished with fiue thousande souldiers he left of his enterprise as a thyng deuoide of all reason

the saied army drawyng towardes champaine tooke the

castles of mote and sart the first by assault after it had beene once sommoned by the canon and the other by composition
for genap and niuelies yeelded them selues without the sommons of the canon

of the reformed religion

exhibited a supplication for the hauyng of publique exercise but especially ye antwerpians first desired of archduke mathias his excellencie and counsaile of estate certaine churches whiche request greatly amazed the lordes howbeit the suppliauntes were so many in nomber and so importunately vrged the matter as that when his highnesse had asked counsell of the generall estates it was thought to be necessarie for the common quiet and preuentyng of all inconuenience to graunt them the castle chappell named the moabites because the spanyards built it the iesuites church half of the friers franciscanes churche of the iacobines and sainct andrewes so that by licence the publique sermons began the last of august
and afterwarde through the continuall exhibityng of supplications of all the lowe countreis the peace of religion or free libertie of the religion was permitted and proclaimed the copie whereof ensueth

it is knowne to all menne

that the tyrannous commissiones long sithence proclaimed aboute the cause of religion by the perswasion counsell and aduise of straungers especially of the spanishe nation without hearyng of the estates of the cou~trey in that behalfe and besides beeyng with moste intollerable crueltie entertained and obserued haue been and presently are the verie originall of all the controuersies emongest vs consideryng that by those occasions the priuileges lawes and laudable customes are sondrie waies broken and troad vnder foote and lastly by the enemies of our countreis haue caused moste lamentable warre to bee beganne to our vtter esclauisshyng and destruction for euer
and therefore none other remedie could bee had about this matter but the makyng of an alliaunce and confederacie betwixt all the said prouinces hereabout and therevpon proceaded the pacification of gaunt whiche after many deliberations and consultations about the same was aswell by the bishoppes diuines as also the counsell of estate and others here about approued confirmed and by a solemne oth openly sworne

not onely by the ecclesiasticall and temporall estates of these lowe countreis bothe generally and particulerly but also by don ihon whose office chiefly was as one substituted to the gouernement and good direction of the saied lowe countreis to se them to bee kept in peace and tranquilitie but he contrariwise hath in many pointes enfrenged the said pacification and against his othe many waies declared hym self not to bee willyng to stande thereto so that he a newe beganne the foresaied warre whiche hath enforced vs to stand for the conseruation and defense of our naturall libertie and ioyntly againe to take armes vpon vs beeyng also thereby and through other greate extreamities wherevnto the saied warre the mother of all dissentions and inconueniences hath brought vs and against our willes and meanynges enforced vs to dooe and suffer many thynges hurtfull bothe to religion and also to his maiesties obedience beeyng suche thinges as otherwise we neuer once minded or thought on and whiche at this present we are no waie able to helpe as often tymes before this warre beganne wee haue sufficiently shewed and protested aswell by our letters as also by our ambassadors sent bothe to his maiestie and likewise to the saied don ihon and although it were so that wee neither could nor would want any thyng that might defende vs yet because the diuersitie of the prouinces and mennes opinions doe make little accompte hereof it is to be doubted that neither our will nor abilitie may any waie remeady it without wee entre ioyntly into an other league and an inuiolable accord and vnio but especially in respect of the religion
for seyng that not onely by reason of the warre but also because of the meuitable hauntyng and conseruation of the marchauntes and the reste of the enhabitauntes of the realmes and countreis nere aboute as fraunce englande germanie and others who haue accepted of the prete~ded reformed religion whiche saied religion many of the countreis here aboute haue followed and sticketh nere their hartes it is greatly to be feared that if the exercise thereof bee not by a louyng accord and religious permitted as well as the auncient religion takyng example bothe by germanie and fraunce whiche by the like meane were brought to an vnitie whereby thei haue liued in peace and prosperitie where before

thet could not abide one an other but were still at mortall warr so that for want thereof ensued greate daungers sheadyng of blood and many other inconueniences by whiche a meane shall more and more be laied open and giuen to the enemy for vs that still remaine in the countreis where contrariwise we alliyng and confederatyng together in an amiable vnitie maie defende our selues fro all imment inconueniences and feare
all which thynges duely and truely considered but especially the matter whiche the enemie least feareth whiche is our vnityng of our selues together in the respect of religion and therefore will by all meanes possible vnder couler thereof keepe vs still at variaunce and dissention
and if it so fall out that by senister practizes subtill muentions or forcibly he enter into the countreis he will neither spare ecclesiasticall person catholique nor no manne els
and where also thei of the reformed religion haue been moste instant suters and made many requestes to haue the free exercise hereof graunted theim with and vnder suche rule and order as shall thereto appertaine wee therefore afore wee had throughly considered of this poinct not onely with the deputies of the generall estates but also of the particuler and haue heard the muides of the estates of eche prouince haue for their common quiet and benefite ordained and appoincted and by these presentes doe ordaine and appoint these articles ensuyng whiche wee haue sette doune for the good and vnion of the prouinces here about and are not to bee altered nor separated one from an other chiefly consideryng that no man is enforced to chaunge his religionrno yet accept of this libertie if he thinke it not good

it is ordeined that all offences and iniuries whiche haue been committed sithence the saied pacification of gaunt about the cause of religion shall be pardoned and forgotten as though thei had neuer been in so muche that no man shall bee accused nor yet by lawe sued or otherwise for any of them neither shall there be any mention once made of them vpon paine of punishing the transgressors as infringers and disturbers of the common quiete of the countreis

to the ende that according hereunto in respect of the religion whiche can neither by force of armes bee entertained

planted nor suppressed there arise no quarrell nor dissention it is established and ordeined that euery man whiche is of either of those two religions maie be at his free choise so to vse them as that one of them giue no occasion of offence to an other about the same as thei will it before god but that euery man whether he ecclesiasticall or temporall shall liue quietly with his owne religion and serue god accordyng to his vnderstandyng and knowledge as he will aunswere at the dreadfull daie of dome at least so farre forth and till suche tyme as either partie shalbe freely heard before a generall or prounciall counsell and that therein it bee otherwise determined and concluded vpon

to the ende also that the libertie of the religion bee for either party ruled ouer with conuenient and peaceable conditions to both their quietnesses and assueraunce it is ordeined that the catholique romishe religion shall bee redressed aswell in the cities and places of holland and sealand as also in all the of the cities and places hereabout where it is banished and there to peaceable and freely exercised without troubling or vexing of any of them whiche shall desire to haue it so that there bee not vnder an hundred housholdes either in citie or toune whiche haue continually remained and dwelt there at the least an whole yeare and the same there aboade so to be certified by the greater parte of the common enhabitauntes
and so maie likewise the saied reformed religion be publickly exercised in all the cities and places hereabout where there shall also bee founde the like nomber by the enhabitauntes of the saied cities and places

prouided alwaies that thei bothe of the one and of the other religion shall come before the magistrate where either of them shall respectiuely require the exercise of their interlaced religion who shall forth with appoint them meete places to witt there shall be appointed out for them of the romishe religion bothe in holland and sealand suche churches and chappelles as shall be thought meete for them there to be had and for want of suche thei shall bee appointed certaine places where thei had been before tyme and there the catholiques shall haue full power to build vp again their ruined churchee and chappelles

and in the rest of the prouinces thei shall haue suche places as the magistrate shall assigne them howbeit thei shall bee a good distaunce of from the churches of the catholiques if it maie possibly bee brought so to passe to the ende there might no quarrelles arise amongst them by reason of their ouer nere standyng together as commonly hath been seene come to passe

that euery of them shall respectiuely accordyng to the custome obserue heare and celebrate their diuine seruice sermons praiers syng baptize administer the supper burie marrie keepe schooles and whatsoeuer thynges els respectiuely appertainyng to their religion
if any of them shall priuately exercise their religion the same persone shall not be ferited nor troubled any maner of way although it be doen at home in his owne house

wee expressely forbidd all those bothe of the one and other religion vpon the paines aforesaied of what estate condition or qualitie soeuer thei are not to trouble nor molest one the other either in word or deede in respect of their religion or in any thing dependyng thereon nor yet giue offence one to an other about the same
we will that euery man abstaine from going to the place where any other religion then his owne is exercised were it not for none other cause but to keepe hymself from giuyng of offence and liue accordyng to the statutes and ordenances of those churches whereof he is a member vpon the paine aforesaied
it shall be lawfull for all friers religious men and all other ecclesiasticall persons freely and without molestation enioye all his goodes tenthes and other rightes
this shall not bee hurtfull to the prouinces of hollande and sealande as concernyng the goodes of any ecclesiasticall persone there but shall liue accordyng to the
article of the pacification of gant vntill suche tyme as the generall estates shall haue set some other order therein
for the auoidyng of all quarrelles we forbidd all slanderous songes ballades or other libelles and infamous writynges to bee openly sung and caried abroade neither yet to haue them to bee printed or solde either by the one side or by the other

wee forbidde all ministers readers or others whiche

speake or preache publiquely of what religion soeuer thei be to vse any speaches or reasons tendyng to dissention or breedyng of troubles but honestly and modestly behaue them selues speaking nothyng but that whiche shall be to the edisiyng of the auditory vpon the paines aforesaied

we moreouer forbidde vpon the like paines all souldiers of what religion so euer thei be to beare aboute theim any deuises or toyes whereby thei maie prouoke one an other to dissention and quarrelyng
that thei whiche are of thesaied religion aswell in holland and sealande as els where shall be bounde to obserue all the lawes and obseruaunces of the catholique churche about the makyng and contractyng of mariages in respect of the degrees of consanguinitie and affinitie
prouided alwaies that as concernyng mariages already contracted in the third or fowerth degree thei of the saied religion shall not bee molested nor the force of the said mariage brought in question ne yet the children borne in the saied mariage to bee depriued of their succession and enheritaunce
prouided alwaies that no spirituall affinitie shall any waie hurtfull to the mariages
neither shall there bee any more difference or distinction made in the respect of religion for the entertainyng of schollers sicke and poore persones into any vniuersitie college schoole hospital spittle then into common almes houses or otherwise
that thei of the religion without hollande and sealande shall bee bounde to obserue all the holy daies whiche the catholique romishe churche hath appointed to bee kept holy to witte all sondaies christmas daie the feastes of the apostles the annunciation assumption and purification of our ladie and corpus christie daie
neither shall thei worke sell nor open their shoppes on those daies
that vpon those daies wherein the saied churche hath forbidden eatyng of fleshe no butcher shall sell any of his wares but euery man duetifully liue according to the ordenaunce of eche place

and for the better vnityng and agreeyng together of the

subiectes hereabout we pronounce that suche bothe of the one religion and the other as are meete to beare office shall holde enioye and exercise all offices and estates aswell of iustice as otherwise without exactyng of those of the reformed religion any other othe then thei are alreadie sworne vnto nor yet to bee bou~de to any other dueties but well and faithfully exercise their estates and offices and obserue the ordenaunces in this behalfe made and agreed vpon

and because the administration of law and iustice is the moste principall meane to keepe subiectes in peace and concord and yet the same neuerthelesse what through the diuersitie of religions and otherwise is in many suppressed to the greate oppressyng and wrongyng of innocentes and others whiche require the lawe for the better helpyng whereof as al+so for the suppressyng of al sclaunders whiche at this daie beare too too greate a swaie all magistrates and iudges are forbidden from henceforthe to laie holde vpon any priuate persone or to take any man without the obseruation of these three accustomed meanes to wit the one that the partie be presently taken with the committyng of the fault or at the appoinctment of the iudge or els where on the contrary partie the same is caused to be set doune in writyng
and the persones whiche are by any of these thre meanes taken to bee forthwith sent and deliuered vp into the power of their lawfull iudge for to be examined vpon the facte or factes and therevpon the lawe to be pronounced accordingly
but to the ende that all the euill humours of commonweales might be the better purged and expulsed it shal be lawfull for euery man although it touche not his owne particuler harme to accuse an other whatsoeuer he bee so that it bee doen vpon iustice and due information and before a lawfull iudge and the said partie complainant to be bounde that he shall within viii daies or rather according to the custome of the place shal aforde fende for the partie accused before the iustice and afterward with all dilige~ce procead either to condemning or as shalbe thought by good lawe and iustice bee doen

neuerthelesse it shall not bee lawfull for any manne to sclaunder one an other or lightly and without good ground accuse

one an other neither yet empaire the good name and same of one an other vpon the paine aboue saied

and for the due execution as well of matters of life and death as ciuile and the reasonable of euery man it is ordeined that all lawes and magistrates of perticuler cities castles tounes and manors of all the countreis hereabout shall be chosen to be suche men as are best qualified and louers of their countrey without difference of religion
which lawes and magistrates shall entermeddle them selues onely and altogether in the state of iustice pollicie or gouernement of those cities and places where thei are chosen
that no man shall herein any waie hinder trouble or let them nor by any meanes haue to doe with them in any matter or vnder any colour whatsoeuer

and this is bothe by the counsell of estate and also of the general estates of the countreis hereabout assembled at antwerpe deuised and decreed the

after the publication of this peace of the religion

the reformed religion was publickly vsed in many cities of the low countreis but especially at leeward in friselande was the first sermon that was openly preached the of august in the iacopines churche euen by the consent of the friers

themselues that were owners of the saied churche

the cities of quesnoy and landercy whiche the estates had promised to monsieur duke of aniowe would not receiue in the frenche but refused theim
and therevpon the abbot of marolles was sent to see if he could cause theim to graunt vnto it howbeit it was to no purpose and therefore the said duke required to haue some other places

the emperour beeyng greeued in weighyng and consideryng of the miserie and warre hereabout sent the count of swertsenbergh to the estates offryng theim if it were possible to agree them with their kyng and to be an intercessour for them yea and promised further all the aide and seruice he was able to make and doe for that purpose

the frenche kyng also by monsieur de ballenre and the queene of englande by the lorde cobham and maister secretarie walsingham one of her maiesties priuie counsell beyng sent all at one tyme to his highnes to monsieur the prince and to the estates made the same declaration and offer whiche was to goe to don ihon to heare hym speake of that whiche thei pretended to gett of hym whiche thyng thei did and so tooke their iourney towardes him carriyng with them the articles of the estates and thei were all so foreward in their businesse as that the deputies on either side mette at louaine
and as thei had brought the matter to a ioylly forewardnesse the kyng wrate to don ihon to leaue of that matter and put it into the emperours handes wherevppon euery manne retourned from whence he came without any forewardnesse or conclusion of the thyng
and this matter bega to be treated of in the latter ende of august and ended in the beginnyng of september

duke casunere hauyng rested hymself for a tyme

in the countrey of zurphen about the musteryng of his men to witte vii thousande footemen wherof fower thousande were french shotte and sixe thousande horse arriued in brabande and ioyned hymself with the estates the

certaine prelates and gentlemen of the countrey of groenyng who were kept in prison in groenyng seeyng that thei could not bee released by any of the chief lordes letters to witte neither by his highuesse excellencie and estates neither

yet by the commissioners whiche were expresly sent thether founde the meane to make an escape and the

of september thei by a deuise got awaie sauyng three prelates and three gentlemen who durst not put it in suche an aduenture because thei feared to bee surprised in their departure
for there was greate partialitie betweene the citie of groenyng and the countrey men by reason of certain rightes and priuiledges whiche was the cause that thei were taken prisoners
thei called also to remembraunce that the nobilitie had heretofore armed theim selues against the citie and had leuied and gotten together menne of warre whom the citezeins of groenyng draue out of the castle of couerden and tooke bartholmewe eyents their captaine prisoner who was afterward released

so soone as the force of monsire the duke of aniowe

the

the magistrate of arras

was by some of the citezens and with the helpe of captaine ambrose and his people taken and kept in the toune house whiche came by reason of a certaine rumour that was there sowen abroade that he had receiued certaine intelligeuce from the enemy
how beit the
of the saied moneth the people deliuered hym and some others were clapt vp in prison parte of whiche were afterwarde executed and parte banished

now

when the gantois had driuen out all their churche men and broken doune all the images in their churches because that don ihou and his adherentes had broken the pacification

of gaunt certaine wallon ensignes vnder colour of their paye and the restoryng of gaunt vnto the romishe religion she wed them selues malcontentes willyng that the ecclesiasticall persones should bee restored to the possession of their goodes and that the prisoners which were kept in gaunt from the

maister sainct aldegonde and soone after hym certaine others were sent to gaunt to decide the quarrell betweene them and the wallons howbeit thei founde those matters growne to suche a poinct and the parties so well flesht as that men iudged it to bee most necessarie for the prince to goe thether

for the appaising of them who to that ende tooke his iorney the
of nouember

the first of december the yere aforesaid the count swertsenbergh the emperour his ambassador was sent againe to the estates with the aduise of the emperour and of the electors about the last treatie of peace and therevpon demaunded an aunswere from the estates with the whiche he was forthwith changed and all by reason of the great affection whiche he had about the suppressyng of this warre and the restoryng of this miserable lowe countreis to vnitie and peace with the prince of parma

the

defender of the libertie of the low countreis sent by maister dampmartin vnto the estates what the cause was of his retournyng into fraunce and of the forsakyng of the lowe countreis and amongest other thynges he wrote vnto them of the louyng request of the kyng his brother by reason of an vprore that arose in fraunce so that hereby some bodie had perswaded the people that his presence was an hinderaunce to the generall peace of the lowe countreis and besides that he went about none other thyng but to make hym self lord and maister of all the cities hereabout whiche his dealyng he forsooth would aswell as he could needes excuse saiyng that it was vtterly vntrue and his reason was because that at his departure he rendred vp all thinges into the handes of the estates further offryng that wheresoeuer he became he would alwaies remaine their good frende and so takyng his leaue required that thei would in regarde hereof be myndfull of the greate charges he had beene at for the aidyng of them leauyng with the saied estates maister pruneaux as his ambassadour lydger

the estates greatly marueilyng

at this his so sudden and vnlooked for departure dispatched seigmour froymont and gyles martin a doctor of the ciuile lawe and secretarie of the citie of antwerpe towardes the saied duke to declare vnto hym how greatly thei had weighed and considered of his departure beseechyng hym to take suche a course as that he might still remaine hereabout and acknowledgyng the benefites whiche thei had receiued by hym offered hym all their seruice with promise of suche satisfaction and contentation as was meete for one in so high a callyng

and yet there were twoo other companies of souldiers liyng in flie within the suburbes of leeward who laye quiet and still till neede were whose captaines were maister bouma and ihon veruew there was also ready with his companie owen grouestins
now when the citezeins were maisters of the castle thei threwe doune the rampares and filled the diches and the children drewe all the greate drdenance into the citie whiche was a marueilous thyng to behold consideryng that there were horses inough in the citie to haue it
whiles the citezeins were troubled aboute the pullyng doune of the castle the twoo companies of ihon bouma and ihon veruew shewed themselues came with great triumph as though thei had been conquerours whiche was to the great honour of the commendable citezeins of leeward who had woonne the castle with ensigne displaied
and that whiche is worthie the laughing thei had put and enterlaced al the friers of the citie emongest the souldiers all behinde the ensigne

so that the poore friers whiche were not wonted to marche in order of battaill were greatly amazed and so had out of the citie
in this sort was ouerthrowen and razed the castle of leeward hauyng continued
yeres for it was built in the yere
and was destroied and razed as before hath been said the first of february

the

of february in the yere aforesaied the captaines ihon bouma ihon veruew and owen grouestins besieged the castle of harlyng howbeit thei of the castle resisted for certaine daies and sometymes so shotte of their artillerie into the toune as that three men were slame there withall but after thei had seen certaine letters whiche were written vnto the and vnderstoode the content of them thei rendred the castle the
of february in the yere aforesaied
whiche the citezeins pulled doune to the ground and filled vp the diches
thesame yere harlyng newe gate and the scluses beganne to be built and was then also finished and afterward the toune was fortefied with bulwarkes whiche before tyme had neuer a one

the same yere and moneth

was the castle of stauere thro wen doune and razed
all these thynges were executed by the good counsell and appoinctment of the honourable lordes the deputies of friselande to witte by seignior rienich caminga seigmor sipppe meckema doctor baert ytzerda ihon oedzinga and many others of the nobilitie to the ende that the whole countrie of friselande might bee the better conserued in peace against all treason and that all meanes might be cutte of from the enemie to serue his turne for commyng in into the saied countrey seyng thei had considered that their own lieutenaunt had conceiued in his mynd to render the countrie vnto the enemie by treason as hereafter shall more at large be declared

the

of february there began newe warres against images and churches in the citie of leeward and al the monasteries thereof
there were also certaine priestes driuen out of the toune neuerthelesse this warre against images was not made onely in leeward but in all the cities and tounes of friseland besides followyng therein the steps and examples of the hollanders
the goods moueables of ye monasteries wer

sold bestowed vpo the warres for the ibertie of the countrie

the
of marche

beganne a greate and miserable sedition in the citie of groenyng aboute fower of the clocke in the mornyng
for george de lalaing countie of rennenberg hauyng taken parte with the malcontentes and renouncyng the vnion of vtright wherevnto he hymself had putte his owne hande as manifestly appeareth by thesaied copie shewed then in very deede that whiche long tyme before he had conceiued in his mynde
for as vpon that daie all the citezeins of groenyng whiche tooke parte with the malcontes weare on their left armes white scarfes and at the tyme prefixed came to the market place so sone as the drommes had sou~ded the alarme where an harquebouze was shotte of and the gouernour there on horebacke with a naked sworde in his hande saiyng now my good fellowe citezens quod he let me at this tyme haue your aide and let vs accomplishe that whiche tendeth to the seruice of his maiestie and our owne defence to th'ende we might va~quishe and ouercome our enemies
and he had no soner spoken these wordes but that al the malcontentes ranne forthwith to the houses of the citezens that were of the reformed religion breakyng doune their doores and takyng the citezens prisoners in this meane while the gouernours horsemen roade throughout all the streates and there could no manne soner put out his heade at a windowe but that he was by and by hausled with a pistoll and emongest all the reste there was one manne of estimation who had sometymes been a counsellour named iames hillebrandes who saied to the gouernour is this the parte of a faithfull gentleman so inciuily to deale with his subiectes and the woordes were no sooner out of his mouthe but that he was shotte into the head with a pistoll and so died of the blowe
there were also in this sedition an other man and a womanne slaine
the gouernour still persisted in his wicked purpose and went on in takyng those of the reformed religio prisoners in so muche that there was greate miserie and calamitie

and wonderfull weepyng and wailyng of women and children for as it is thought there were at that tyme of the reformed religion about three hundred citezens taken of whom some were kept in churches and other some in straight prison

and in this maner reuolted the citie of groenyng against all the whole countrie and tooke parte with the malcontentes whiche caused the citie to bee encompassed and besieged on euery side
whe the leewarders heard of the certaintie of this newes the magistrate and all the citezeins did wonderfully stomacke the catholikes in so muche that thei were once bent to haue dealte with theim euen as the groemgistes had dealte with those of the reformed religion howbeit after some deliberation had the desisted from that purpose not meaning to vse any such or the like tyrannie but onely shapped vp some of the catholikes within their owne house and afterwarde banished theim the
and
of marche

when thesaied count of renneberg had gotten the greater parte of friselande he came and encamped hym self before the citie of steenewike in the territorie of transisselaine howbeit gentle reader meane not to frustrate thee about the successe of this siege in shewyng vnto thee the goyng foreward of the same as by the historie ensuyng thou maiest see

after that the armie of the vnited prouinces

vnder the conduct of the count of hohenloo was the
of iune
ouerthrowen and discomfited by the malcontents vnder the conduct of marten scheuck in the lande of hardenbergue the citie of groening was aided and rid of their gouernour the count of rennenbergue and although the saied count of hohenloo had at an other tyme leuyed a reasonable greate company of souldiers both on foote and on horsebacke and so repaired his army yet was it once more discomfited the
of september about linigen by the said malcontentes whiche was the cause that many of the cities fearing the force and power of the enemie were driuen to receiue garnisons into theim for their defence
and when the count of rennenbergue sawe that he had not men of warre enowe to assaile certaine renowmed cities and of some importaunce he was againe strengthened with
ensignes of footemen and certaine horsemen vnder the charge of hans storiff of enbricke wherevpon he caused his army to marche towardes the citie of oldenzeel whiche citie not meanyng to tarrie the siege rendred to the saied count of rennenbergue the
of september
when thei of steenwike heard of this

thei receiued in a garnison and souldiers for their defence against the enemie and so fortefied their citie and rampars still lookyng for the army of the euemie who planted his siege before the same the
of october about noone with

companies of almaines and others and
horse
wherupon that euenyng two of the gates of the citie the one named the giest gate and the other onniger gate were with earth and trees fast rampard vp against the force of the artillary of the enemy

the self same daie the souldiers of the toune sallied twise out to skirmish with the enemie and so also did thei the
daie ensuyng and caried home with them fower prisoners
towardes the euenyng the enemie passed the riuer of ae with eleuen companies of friselanders and entrenched about the chappell steendicq
the
daie there issued out of the citie certaine souldiers at the wood gate and had wonne and defaced the little trench about the chappell cariyng home the butin with them whiche trench the night followyng was made vp againe
the same daie in the afternoone thei againe sallied out at the east gate and after thei had skirmished with the enemie thei caried backe with them three prisoners and two horses
the
of october in the night the enemy marched towardes the kuynder to the ende thei might light vpon the two companies of ihon de eschede and roeloff de laughen whiche thyng thei performed for the next daie ensuyng as thei returned to the campe thei trailed at an horse taile iust before the toune one of their ensignes
the
daie there was a braue skirmishe where the enemie receiued a notable losse bothe of souldiers and horses and our men returned to the citie without any losse cariyng with them two prisoners and three horses

the
daie of the saied moneth the count george de lalayng as gouernor for his maiestie in friseland sent a trumpet to sommon the citie for the yeeldyng thereof whom captaine conrade aunswered that he kept the citie for his maiestie the estates and the prince of orenge and would defende it against whom soeuer came commaundyng the tumpett to bee packyng without thei loued to be hausled with a cannon shott

the count of rennenbergue beyug stirred with this aunswere caused three peeces of greate ordenaunce to be planted whiche he had that daie receiued and that euenyng discharged against the citie three of the same cannot shott

this daie at the instaunce of certaine good honest citezins was an ordenaunce made and a price sett vppon victualles in maner and forme followyng whiche was proclaimed and afterterwarde set vp vpon one of the postes of the toune house
and first it was ordeined that no man should brewe nor sell any beare aboue halfe a patart the pot of steenwike measure

a pounde of larde was priced at three sous
a pounde of butter fower sous
a pounde of creame cheese two sous
a pounde of course cheese one sous and one lyard
a stockfishe two sous sauyng a lyard
twelue pounde of waightie rye bread sixe sous
a measure of eastland graines eighteene sous
a measure of countrey graines sixteene sous
a measure of barley fifteene sous
a measure of buckweyt foreteene sous
a bushell of salte twelue sous
a pot of beare called iupenbere seuen sous
a pot of rennishe wine nine sous
a pot of frenche wine fiue sous

whiche was proclaimed and commaunded to bee straightly obserued by the enhabitauntes of the citie

the
of october were sixe greate peeces of ordenaunce moe brought to the campe of the enemie and planted to batter the citie withall whiche was in deede doen the next daie followyng so that thereby thei had no vse of the twoo milles of the citie
the same daie the citie understoode by captaine herman olthoff his man that the enemie meant to giue them a liuely assault

and therefore euery man prepared hymself to giue them an hot repulse and to that ende thei brought al the brewyng vesselles in the citie to the rampars which thei had filled with hot skaldyng water and lime for the washyng of the heades and bodies of the enemie
thei prepared also all kindes of necessary armour and weapon to defende themselues against the force

of the enemie in so muche that the souldiers and all the citezens were fully determined to receiue and withstande the assault of the enemie who in steade of assaulting the citie cast vp his trenches from giest gate euen vnto onniger gate

the first of nouember a messenger was sent to the estates to aduertise them of the estate of the citie
and about
of the clocke in the night there issued
valiaunt souldiers vnder the conduct of ihon vorberg captaine cornput his lieutenaunt who charged the very body of the watche whiche laie betweene giest gate and onniger gate and there so pretely well cooled the courages of
men of the saied watche as that
of them were leaft dead in the place and three caried awaie prisoners and one of them whiche would not goe was hurt vnto death and left without the citie where he died that night but he that was in the watch saued himself with a light paire of heeles
the
of the saied moneth in the night the enemie cast vp the trenche betweene the foresaied gates as if he would haue made there some mount and therefore thei likewise within began to make an other mount about giest gate and then were the captaines quartered for the defending of the rampars
the same daie also were twoo deepe ditches made at giest gate because thei feared that the enemie would vndermine the citie
the
daie at night issued certaine souldiers and suddenly fell vpon the pyoners certaine countrie men and souldiers whereof many were slaine and afterwarde thei retiered to the citie with their butin
the
daie thei sallied out at the east gate and brought awaie two souldiers and a victualler prisoners leauyng behinde them vpon the waie many hurte men which would not goe with them
thei caried also awaie with them in despight of the enemie fiue kyne and a souldiers wife
the same daie in the afternoone there was the like sallie whereat was a liuely skirmishe so that by reason of the retraict of captaine oltholffe his ensigne bearer and of captaine herman olthoffe they were bothe hurt
the ensigne bearer also of captaine cornput standyng vpon the citie rampere was with a cannon shot slaine in the place

the
daie the messenger returned with letters from the

prince and the estates to the citie promising to ayde the citie and raise the campe of the enemie
and againe the night followyng came in two citezens saiyng that the ayd was commyng on whiche should helpe the citie

the
daie the horsemen of the enemie trouped on from onnen by westwyke towardes the wood who were brauely hausled with greate ordenaunce from the toune to the greate losse of their people
the
of the saied moneth there was a sallie and a skirmishe made to the hurte of the enemie in whiche one willyam dorth captaine olthoffe his sergeaunt was hurt to death and dyed the next morrow on which daie in the sermon while there came to the gate a man at armes on horseback very wel armed who was receiued into the toune but when the souldiers sawe that he was none of the wisest or rather a counterfeit thei thrust him out of the gates after the sermons were ended and slue him with harquebouze shot keeping behinde with them his horse and armour
the
and
daie the enimie battered the toune and thesame euenyng in token thei had obtained a victorie of hegemans people the enemie trailed an ensigne at his horse taile and made bonefiers rounde about the citie as though thei would haue assaulted it with fiers

the

daie the enemie shotte fier into many places of the citie in so muche that at one tyme the citie was all on a light fier by reason whereof there were
houses burnt
by this fier was muche victuall and other munitions burnte to the greate losse of the enhabitauntes
diuerse houses in onnigerstreate through the greate diligence of the citezens were saued and so had there been also in many other places if the souldiers had not garded the rampares because the enemie costed all alongest one side of the citie with ensigne displaied as though he would haue giuen the assault whiche he might easily hatte doen by reason that in many places the diches were hard frosen vp

thesame daie about the euenyng the enemie sent twoo trompetts to sommon the citie in his maiesties name and to yeeld it self vnto the prince of parma as captaine generall and to the count of rennenberg as lieutenaunt and

gouernour of friselande and so thei should depart with bagge and baggage
whom captaine frauncis platte in the name of all the reste of the captaines answered that thei kepte the citie in the behalfe of his maiestie of archduke matthias of austriche as captaine generall of the prince of orenge his lieutenaunt and of the estates and that thei had none other thyng for the count of rennenberg to commaunde but bullettes and pouder and therefore wished theim quietly departe without thei liked to be saluted with cannon shotte
thesame night a messenger was dispatched towardes campen to declare vnto them what losse thei had receiued by fier

the
daie the enemie moste diligently went aboute to shoote fire again into the citie but it was to no purpose
this night there came a messenger into the citie who saied that he had cast awaie his letters whiche he had of the estates because he feared as he saied thei carried no good newes with theim and within one houre after there came in the taile of hym three other citezens agreyng all with one voice that there was no aide in the whole worlde ready for thei saied that the people of the hegemans was discomfited and the scluse and bloczeell forsaken wherevpon the nexte daie followyng ensued greate trouble and dissention for

many of the papisticall citezens and others cried out and saied that it was reason a oromme should bee sent to the enemie and the citie to bee rendred vp howbeit there were certaine souldiers and all the reformed citezens whiche would none of that who bothe with faire speeches also with threatnyng wordes said that thei would rather kill one an other then thei would so yeld vnto the enemie consideryng that thei had no want of victualles in so muche that many honest and constant citezens did weare that daie bothe armour and weapon vnder their cloakes some others greeuously accused the prince and the estates because thei had not holpen certaine cities whiche had been besieged as dopslach delffziell couerde maestright harlem and ziericzea could largely witnesse neuerthelesse the reste stoode stoutly to their trckle so that in the ende the trouble and sedition was suppressed
and sone after there came a dromme to the gate bringing letters from captaine gedeon pameren praiyng that he might

haue his souldiers deliuered for other prisoners or els for a monethes wages whiche was graunted hym
in the euenyng the enemie very diligently sought to shoote more fire into the toune but it was to no purpose
this night came in the faithfull and vertuous seruaunt of the countrie matthias kies bringyng with hym good newes saiyng that the estates were makyng of the moste diligent preparation that was possible to aide the citie

as also it appeared by the letters of the estates whiche refreshed again the hartes of al the white liuered knightes of the toune and this night herman henricx and george waterwike with one of hans vrancquebourg souldiers were sent out of the citie

the
of nouember there issued aboute the daie breake out of the easte gate
shotte who laie hidd in a secret place vntill some of westwike campe came that waie and then with the aide of the horsemen of the citie thei sette vpon theim and caried awaie with theim
horses with a charrette and chariot and a victualler slayng suche as would not goe with them
this victualler had about him in gold to the worth of
florins and when he was examined he saied that he thought in his opion that the enemie meant to plant the greate ordenaunce in eastwike and batter the citie on that side or els cast fier into it for the doyng of it the more mischiefe but it proued nothyng
the
the enemie sent a dromme for certaine prisoners whiche thyng the captaine of the toune denied hym for that daie because he vnderstoode not of the sedition that had been in the citie by reason of the ill newes and former fier
the dro~me saied that the counte by reason of this refusall would hang all those prisoners whiche were ours and that thei should heare of other newes shortly but he was answered againe that if thei so did thei would in like maner deale with the prisoners whiche thei had of theirs

the
daie the enemie beganne to caste vp a mightie and strong trenche from eastwike aboute the winde milne hill and towardes euenyng he brought thether three companies of souldiers but as the horsemen trouped on the side of the citie some of them were slaine with musket shotte and thesame

daie thei beganne to fill vp the east gate with yearth and ramforce the rampares and vauntmures betwixte the saied gate and onniger gate
in the euenyng the enemie made a false alarme and shotte at the citie as though he would haue giuen the assaulte but nothyng came of it it is thought that thei did thus because thei would not haue the pioners troubled and also for that he might the better pitche his campe in eastwike and the
daie he also ramforced that trenche and the watch beyng set brought his people out of the wood and made them giue a false alarme about eleuen of the clocke but because the tounesmen so tickled them with their ordenaunce there came nothyng of it

the
daie money was cried vp to the double valure to paie the souldiers withall
the nexte morrowe certaine issued out at the wood gate towardes the eastbridge to catche a souldier that was laden with gambons of bacon and butter who beyng talked with saied that the cou~te of rennenbergue was gone to groenyng to take vp money for the appaisyng of the mutinous souldiers
and further told that our aide was gathered together at winsome about zwolle and that their horsmen and sixe ensignes of footemen were marched towardes hauelt to staie the aide
the first of december the weather whiche had of long fauoured the enemie beganne to alter and fell to rainyng blowyng and blusteryng
and this euenyng there issued out of the giest gate about fourtie souldiers to surprise the pioners but whe thei found no pioners there there issued out of the wood gate about thirtie souldiers mo to sound the depth of the riuer of ae and with their shot slue certaine of the enemies behinde as thei satte aboute the fier side and gaue many their deathes wounde
some of ours also retourned not scotfree and lost besides twoo of hans platte his souldiers bringyng awaie with them notwithstandyng some spoile

the third daie about eight of the clocke in the mornyng thei salied out vpon the enemie

whom thei chased out of westerwike trenches to the greate losse of their people came back with the spoile of the armour and weapon of fourtie souldiers besides cloakes and other apparell
this night was the enemy

driuen out of his trenche with a balle of wilde fier whiche the tounsmen had caste into the saied trenche

the fourth daie the enemie forsooke his little trenche whiche laie wholy aboute the citie and thesame euenyng thei beganne to sette open the onniger gate whiche had been rampard vp with yearth
the night ensuyng there issued out again about thirtie shotte who hausled the body of the watche with a liuely volee of shotte and in the meane while other thirtie sette vpon the trenche whiche was but sclenderly manned some of whiche thei fiue
this night also came into the citie twoo of our messengers who brought good newes of our aide
the sixte daie onniger gate was sett so wide open as that a
souldiers and horses went out of it where thei made an hott skirmishe with the enemie who so forsooke his trenches as that he was driuen from al the trenches that were betweene onniger gate and the wood gate whiche was driuen open with the force of a mallet for the sauyng of our men from the greate ordenaunce of the enemie
this night our menne gaue the enemie three alarmes at the first of whiche he shotte of twise against onneger gate howbeit there was no hurte doen
the seuenth daie thei beganne to builde vp a counter scarfe before onniger gate wherevpon there came out of the wood twoo cornettes of horsemen and a bande of almain horsemen but so soone as thei were come into the southe parte of the campe the enemie began to sette hymself in order as though he would haue giuen the alarme and then thei sent many shott to the counter scarfes of the citie and settyng vpon the trenches draue out the enemie
this night the enemie had sixe alarmes so lustely giuen hym as that he tooke no reste at all
and our men had a signe of fire giuen them vppon coldervene tower as it was promised theim
but after that our aide was once passed the blacke water the enemie beganne to make a bridge of boates ouer the riuer of ae and so filled lowe plaine grounde with faggottes and other thinges that he might come from one quarter of his campe to the other

the nineth daie in the mornyng certaine souldiers issued out and tooke awaie twoo fatte oxen from the enemie
then

was there alarme sounded in the campe wherevpon the enemie beganne to shewe his hedde and had placed a band of eastwike wood and therefore for that daie were no more sallies made
the souldiers of the toune likewise

had sett vp a bande of horsemen for the daiely makyng of their sallies ouer whom thei appointed captaine girard holten of geldrelande a man of great valure and lieutenaunt to conrad edenrats of steenwike

the tenth daie a sallie was made as before in whiche thei tooke three prisoners and because one of theim would not goe on he was slaine and one of the other was deliuered the same daie vpon his raunsome
and as our captaines had deliuered the prisoner vnto the dro~me there was a ca~non shot came out of the campe whiche so sprinkled the dirte aboute their eares as that bothe the dromme and the prisoner were in greate danger of their liues
the eleuenth daie the horsemen of the toune assembled theim selues in the market place and had gotten vp vppon the rampares with their guidon as if a band of horsemen had entred the toune wherevppon the enemie beganne to breake doune the bridge towardes niestiecke but thei were soone driuen thence by certaine souldiers whiche issued out of the toune who brought with them suche instrumentes as thei were wonted to vse after some small skirmishe
thesame daie the enemie put twoo kine into the medowes liyng on the toune side thinkyng thereby to entrappe some of our menne because thei laied in ambushe many horsemen and others whiche thyng out people suspectyng saied vnto the enemie that the kine were ouer leane and therefore willed them to sende fatter thether

the
of the saied moneth the enemie discharged three cannon shot vpon the toune for a watche worde wherevpon bothe the launces and shot she wed them selues abroade in the plaine fieldes whether also were come from westerwyke two companies of footemen
and then thei beganne to entrench about onnen that thei might keepe backe our ayde but it was to no purpose
the same euenyng were sent two messengers to aske councell about the affaires of the warres to get ayde and to shew the estate of our citie and the estate of the enemy
the

souldiers who had the conuaiyng of the messengers fell immediatly vpon the enemie and slewe three of the watche makyng a greate and long alarum vpon them

the
daie thei sallied out twise to see if thei could catche any but at last gerarde holt tooke an harquebouzer and after he had taken his harquebouze from hym he caried hym awaie prisoner who was recouered by two bandes of horsemen and two ensignes of footemen but yet thei caried awaie the harquebouze with them
this night before midnight were seene two signes of fire and an other after midnight accordingly as ye messengers were enioyned to doe the meaning whereof our captaines right well knewe

the
daie the enemie she wed hymself with foure squadrons of horsemen

who at last put them selues in order of battaile at whiche tyme the counte of rennenbergue came thether who wheeling about went from him the enemies dischargyng all their pistolles to honour hym withall
then the tounes men discharged a greate peece of ordenaunce against the troupe and against westerwyke campe also and likewise against haustroyffe quarter where he lighted from his horse
there was also another token of fire that night seene towardes scluse

the

daie because the water in the ditches was hard frosen ouer the souldiers went out to breake the ise and in the meane while there went ouer fower of the enemies driuyng an oxe before them towardes eastwyke
whiche thyng when our men whiche were breakyng of the ise saw went and tooke away the oxe from the enemie and although many of the souldiers of the enemie came thether to recouer it yet did thei nothyng in it because our souldiers had in haste driuen it to the toune
this night about
of the clocke the enemie sounded a great alarme bothe with drommes and trumpettes
and at that tyme also was fire cried at giethorne and soone after many houses were seene on a light fire in so muche that the enemie discharged three cannons for the watch word that the horsemen might get together
there was also a greate noyse of aboue an hundred cartes and horses heard whiche came out

of the countrey of drenthe but when the daie appeared bothe the cartes and also the carters were cleane gone for thei whiche had set giethorne on fire came not nere it

the next morrowe in the euenyng stuper his companie had broken the ise betweene onniger gate and giest gate and so euen vnto the wood gate
this night likewise was a greate noyse bothe of cartes and horses in the enemies campe

the
daie issued out seuen souldiers to entrappe some of the enemies nere vnto the easterne bridge three of whiche were vpon fredericke lutgene his lande and the other fower in the banke ditche
but so soone as two of the enemies of easterwyke campe sawe that the aforesaied three would needes charge them thei purposed forth with to saue the selues through the lightnesse of their heeles
whiche thyng when the other fower sawe thei left their ambusshyng and tooke the one and the other eskaped with leapyng ouer the riuer of ae
when thei had brought the prisoner to the towne he was examined who saied that our people had been at giethorne and taken ortho of sauton drossat of harderwike prisoner slaine his sonne gréeuously wounded his guarde corpes and put his souldiers to flight
and besides that our me were come to meppell with
ensignes of footemen whom the enemie thought to remoue going thether but with
ensignes of footemen a certaine nomber of horsemen but it was all in vaine
and further he said that the knight of nieuorte was in the countrey of groenyng with a great nomber of souldiers
there was also a dromme sent to the enemie to knowe whether he would redeeme his souldier with a raunsome or no
and he saied that he would howbeit he threatned for all that to hang him so soone as he had hym if so be that thei of the toune would not doe it before but thei of the toune accordyng to their custome and former promise would not doe it and the reason whiche moued the enemie to cause him to be ha~ged was this that he went from the campe without their leaue and licence
the same daie the twoo souldiers whiche brake the ise of the ditches set vpon a souldier of the enemie who had giuen them some occasion hauyng none other weapons about them but the tooles wherewith thei brake the ise one of whiche named ihon montiew as he was coupled

to the enemie was slaine with an harquebouze shott and after he was dead the enemie gaue hym many a stappe with his dagger

criyng with a loude voyce wee are the souldiers of suater and thus will we handle all the rest of you ye horse eaters
this their crueltie restranged the hartes of many from them and encouraged many to withstande them to the vttermost
this night about twelue of the clocke came into the toune our three messengers of the citie bringing newes that thei had left at the blacke scluse
companies of souldiers and at bergmer bridge
horse comming to ayd vs
there was also a token of fire made vpon the tower which when the enemie sawe he discharged a greate peece of ordenaunce but thankes be to god did no hurt at all and the bullet was founde in the churchyarde

the
daie being rainie and mistie there was a sallie made to know whether the enemie that laie so still was strong or no and after thei had skirmished a while thei retiered on either side by reason of the mist but about eight of the clocke at night the enemie gaue a false alarme and shot of twise

the
daie the enemie shott of thrise whiche was as it was thought a certaine watch worde for three horsemen came from the wood and the enemie sounded the alarme and there might be seene many souldiers marche without weapon from westerwike towardes the wood
this night about midnight came into the toune certaine messengers with charge and letters of colonell norris an englishe man aduertising them that the enemie had been the
daie with
ensignes of foote men and sixe cornettes of horsemen at the blacke scluse
after that the army of the estates was retired from meppell the enemie thought to haue discomfited and ouerthrowen the three companies whiche were left at the saied place howbeit thei met there with suche an encounter as that twoo of their captaines were slaine in the place two ensignes taken about
souldiers slaine the armour and weapon of
men left behinde

and an ensigne bearer taken prisoner and because that after the entre of these messengers a token of fire was giuen vppon the tower the enemie shott of a greate peece of ordenaunce

the twentie daie there was so greate an hurly burly in the campe of the enemie as that thei might be heard criyng euen to the rampars of the toune money money but because certaine of our captaines went out with some of their souldiers into their emptie trenches to vnderstand something more of this hurly burly some of the enemies perceiuyng them there was anon plentifull dealyng of harquebouze shott on either side and besides the enemie let flie a cannon shott amongst the thickest
then beganne some of the captaines of the toune to make a counterscarfe before the wood gate which was an hazardous thyng to doe
and soone after the enemie fell on criyng out and saiyng ha poore soules get you out and looke for walter hedgemans then aunswered the tounesmen them againe saiyng it were very small honour to vs to serue suche traitours but quod thei wee will goe to the blacke scluse and meppell and wee doubt not but to finde there both ensignes armour weapon and paye of yours
after midnight the enemie once againe discharged three cannon shott and the horsemen of the wood shocked on and eftsoones was a noyse in the campe criyng arme arme

the
daie thei made a sallie and tooke a page who being examined could saie nothing wherevpon thei shore his head like a frier and then draue hym out of the toune
and about three of the clocke in the afternoone the enemie shott of seuen caunon shott besides sixe balles of wilde fire one of whiche lighted in the plain before the toune and an other vpon marshall tongeren his barne whiche through the greate diligence of the citezens was quenched
the same daie also the citezens and the souldiers had deuised an enterprise against eastwike how be it the captaines frustrated their purpose
this night also went fower messengers out of the toune whose conuaie caused a great alarme in bothe the campes

the
daie thei went on with their said counterscarfe and the enemy payd a prisoners raunsome who had been a moneth prisoner it was thought that thei did it to the ende that by hym thei might the better vnderstande the state of the toune
this night ensuyng there came into the toune twoo messengers who brought with them
souldiers cariyng on their backes


poundes of gunpouder in leather bagges and an ensigne whiche the enemie had lost at the blacke scluse

the
daie in the afternoone some of meppell made a road to steenwike and fiered certaine houses at ounen
when the enemie sawe this he marched with a great companie towardes the place and the tounes men sallied out and brauely skirmisshed with hym where many bothe on the one side and the other were slaine and yet but one tounes man whose name was francis platt
then the enemie caried a waie his dead bothe on horsbacke and also by wagon and lost besides a good sorte of horses
the ensigne that was brought from the blacke scluse was caried in despite rounde about the toune vpon the rampars
this night also certaine messengers whiche were gone out of the toune came in again by reason that the moone shoone so bright fearyng thereby to bee discouered
this night likewise the enemie beganne to entrenche in isseene waie but the next morrowe the tounes men had cast it quite and cleane doune

the
daie at night captaiue conrade of steenwike maister steigh and others went out of the toune whiche those souldiers had brought in the pouder aforesaied meaning to goe to meppell to deuise and conclude with the generall of the armie and the councell for the warres about some enterprise and meanes that might best serue for their deliueraunce and ayde but as thei were about the little trench whiche was cast vp vppon the waie aforesaied and should passe a narrowe planke whiche remained vppon the passage of the east bridge

the enemie was come thether to cast vp againe the saied trenche and so soone as thei were mett either side was amazed but by and by let flye their shot one against an other
then sounded the enemie the alarme and therevpon our men retiered because thei knewe not the nomber whiche came against them and as thei went ouer the foresaied planke three englishmen fell into the riuer of ae and so were drouned
and foorthwith the enemie had the alarme giuen hym on either side to the end he should not vnderstande our peoples meanyng and deuise

the
of the saied moneth captaine francis platt was buried in our lady churche and the
certaine messengers

were sent out to declare the state of the toune

the

this night also were certaine houses burnt at onnen
this daie likewise the enemie made a passage from easterwike campe ouer the riuer of ae towardes the little trenche of isueniger bancke

the
daie in the mornyng onnen houses were againe seene on fire and it was thought that the enemie did it to the ende that we should haue no shelter for our sauftie
the enemie also caused certaine long peeces of timber to bee caried awaie and in the afternoone sent a trompet to the wood gate sommonyng the toune to render it self into the handes of george de lalayng who was aunswered that thei could not doe it

with out thei should lose their honor and breake their othe whiche thei meant not to doe so long as thei had one droppe of bloud in their bodies
when the captaines were retourned from the saied trompet thei fearyng that some trouble herevpon might arise amongest the citezens tolde theim that the enemie had lost two gentlemen and thinkyng them to bee taken prisoners by some of the toune was sent to craue their deliueraunce in paiyng their raunsome

the
daie in the mornyng thei sallied out at onniger gate but it was to no purpose because there was neuer a man come from the campe
at night the musketers were placed before the wood gate who shreudly galled the horsemen which shocked to and fro the watche

florins to paie the souldiers
the same daie also came one of the souldiers of the enemie vnto onniger gate mouyng with vile and sclaunderous speaches and deedes the tounes men to anger who was slaine there for his great paines

for on the enemies parte were slaine an ensigne certaine horsemen and a greate many souldiers and on our side were slaine hans de drees and some souldiers
in this skirmishe the tounes men fought as couragiously as lyons for thei draue the enemie cleane out of all his trenches of westwike broke one peece of ordnaunce and pegged or poysoned an other thei tooke besides two batches of hot bread and caried them to the toune
this night also the tounes men beganne to cast a trenche nere to onniger gate whiche ranne as farre as the enemies trenche whiche very fitly serued the toune souldiers for their salliyng and that greatly greeued the enemie

the firste of ianuary

the enemie sounded a false alarme in the mornyng placing his whole force vpo the plaine fallowes liyng vnder onnen where an house was sette on fire he shott of also twoo peeces of ordenaunce at the toune thinkyng thereby and the helpe of the mist to toule our men out of the toune to be aduenged of their former daies losse as it was told vs by a dromme who was sent that daie thether for twoo prisoners
howbeit the lorde god who euer defendeth his shewed therein a wonderfull peece of woorke for our menne were no soner gone out of the toune but that the mistes brake vp and that the aire became so cleare as that our menne might easely perceiue and see all the ambushes whiche were lated for them in so muche that the enemie loste moe of his menne then we had loste the daie before and so for that tyme wee retourned to the tonne without any losse at all

the
daie the enemy discharged two peeces of ordnance vpon the pioners as thei were labouryng about the counterscarfe casting of the trenches
and this night the magistrate and certaine eaptaines made a signe with fire whche deede no whit liked the reste of the eaptaines by reason that thereby somthing was reuealed which thei would not haue had knowe

there were this daie likewise seen aboue an hundred emptie wagons commyng out of drenthe whiche were all laden with a parte of the campe
the fifte of this monethe there beganne a very greate trouble and as it were a sedition to arise aswell emongest the citezens as the souldiers that through a mischeuous mistakyng of a matter by reason of a ladder of coardes whiche the magistrate and eaptaines had caused to be wrought and made none els priuie to it so that it bredde a vengeable suspition in the heddes of many
this night at tenne of the clocke captaine conrad of steenwike olthoff his lieutenaunt and lazarus of austriche with thirtie souldiers moe went out of the toune to goe to meppell for the bringyng foreward of our aide

the seuenth daie the enemie had many alarmes giuen hym before daie wherefore bothe thei of westwike and also thei of eastwike putt theim selues in battaile towardes onnen wherevpon our men shreudly tossed them but did them no greate hurte
theight daie at night two messengers came and told that our aide would be come within tenne daies and couple with the enemie but that was nothyng

the nineth daie of ianuary the enemie caused the toune to bee sommoned once againe offeryng by his letters the laste grace that thei might saufly departe with bodies and gooddes
these letters were written to the captaines burroughmaisters souldiers and citezens conteinyng at the first very louyng wordes but threatnyng in the ende to kill the children in their cradles
wherevnto the trompette was aunswered by worde of mouthe that if so be there were no aide from the estates neare at hande yet that thei could not with their honour render vp the toune vpon these brauyng and threatnyng letters and that it would coste a dearer price then a peece of written papar with which answere the said tro~pet returned

about the euenyng the tounsmen sallied out but it was to no purpose

the eleuenth of the saied monethe our people of giethorne gaue the enemie diuerse alarmes daie and night and the enemie shot of sixe tymes and then shewed hym self with sixe co~panies of souldiers and certaine horsemen in order of battle about the hie water milles
the twelft daie as the souldiers of the toune were breakyng the ise there were certaine roiters whiche troubled the wherevpon certaine harquebouziers went out to keepe them plaie

aboute the daie breake the enemie called to our watche and asked theim if thei had eaten all their dogges and cattes tellyng them further that thei would before it wer long come into the toune and hang vp olthoffes souldiers vpon the rampares and besides that our lookyng for aide was in vaine because we were like to haue none and that we should bee deliuered euen as delfziill was where in deede our aide was moste manifestly to be seen whiche woordes thei spake to discourage the souldiers of the toune

the fourteenth of ianuary there came out from about the bulwoorkes about thirtie horsemen shockyng firste on towardes eastwike trenche and anon towardes westwike somewhat nere the artillarie of the enemie but it was to no purpose for the enemie laye quietly in his trenches
this night about nine of the clocke sixe messengers wer sent to wit foure souldiers and twoo citezens to haue some assurance of aide

from the counsell of the warres
and afterward the giethornistes gaue the enemie three seuerall alarmes and so thei did the next night followyng

the fifteene daie of this monethe george de lalyng sent by a dromme a despitefull letter to captaine ihon cornput and besides there were certaine letters written in frenche by the prince of orenge and sent to the duke of alenson whiche were intercepted and the commentaries that were made of them
these letters caused many mutinous souldiers to mutin because thei might not knowe the contentes of them
the sixteene daie before dinner there issued out certaine horsemen and harquebouziers and brought home with theim a countrie man of the lande of hessen who knewe nothyng of the estate of the enemie
about noone the enemie came forthe to anger the ise breakers wherevpon certaine souldiers set vpon them in skirmishe where thei hurte some of the enemies and emongest the reste was an ouer hazardous walon slaine and pitefully dealt withall in the reuenge of ihon montieu of northdike
in the afternoone an other sallie was made as before where thei got a page prisoner who gaue them sufficient knowledge of the estate of the enemie
this daie also was there a greate controuersie betweene the magistrate and the captaines aboute the souldiers preste
and this night came backe the sixe messengers aforesaied who brought newes that vpon fridaie next our aide would be at the wood

the eightene the campe of giethorne remoued before the daie breake and came to the wood settyng many houses on fire where the roiters and the campe of the fower companies were driuen awaie
then the tounesmen sallied out in greate nombers brauely skirmishyng on euery side where many on either parte were slaine and taken prisoners
after this the enemie marched very strongly towardes the wood

meanyng to charge the englishmen and discomfite them but in the ende he was enforced for all his iolly cannonyng of about three score bullettes bothe vpon them of the toune and vpon them in the wood to retire with greate losse
and his losse had been farre greater if the tounesmen and their assistauntes had had any watche woorde betweene theim
then beganne the weather to

breake vp and thawe and to be very mistie whiche greatly aduauntaged the englishmen and those whiche laie in the wood
who in the night retired from the wood to blockzill giuyng vs notice thereof by the signes of fire

the nineteene of ianuary the enemie a freshe sommoned the toune by letters containyng that all straungers and honest citezens should bee licensed to departe with their bodies and gooddes but that he would haue the periured ones to be deliuered into his handes that he might execute the lawe vppon theim
braggyng and boastyng further in liyng maner that our aide had charged the very weakest corner of his campe and were with shame inough repulsed and chased cleane awaie left many of their weapo~s behinde them had lost much of their victuall besides certaine of their captaines
he called also for the prisoners and threatened likewise to hang our prisoners ere many daies were at an ende howbeeit captaine conrade of steenwike and others who were appoincted for that purpose answered hym againe by worde of mouthe that it was not lawfull for them so to forget and breake their othe because thei had sworne to the vnited prouinces to keepe the toune so long as thei had any life within theim and therefore would obserue the same still lookyng for whatsoeuer it should please the lorde god to laie vpon theim
and as concernyng the prisoners thei answered by letters that thei were contented to keepe the accustomed lawe of armes and therefore desired to haue in writing a specification from the prisoners because thei neuer thirsted after their blood and that if thei hung any of them thei should be assured that thei would doe the like
whiche letters were sent by a prisoner who vpon his othe was sent from the enemie to them of the toune and was afterward deliuered with the reste of the prisoners

the

the same daie the enemie offered to obserue the lawe at armes as was to witte to deliuer a prisoner for a monethes wages or els prisoner for prisoner
there was also a copie taken of that letter of the enemie and put vppon a poles ende without the toune whiche was pitched before his campe smally for his honour

and pleasure
these saied messengers declared that the cause why our succour retired from the wood was for want of victuall and pouder and did further assure them that the lord of nieuorte was marchyng on with
men to ioyne with the englishe men for our ayde
at that tyme likewise the enemie sent the tounes men worde that if thei would forbid their souldiers the committyng of iniuries that he would also doe the like to his

the
daie the enemie raunsomed and also deliuered certaine prisoners for a monethes wages

bothe for vs and the englishe men whom the enemy had so distressed as that thei were driuen to eate their horses
in so muche that our case stoode in poore estate had not the lorde god prouide for vs the assistaunce of the lorde of nieuorte and his friselanders

the

he was also seene retieryng from the wood with his baggage and this night was heard a greate noyse of waggons and in the mornyng were a

greate nomber of the royters waggons seen about the great ordenaunce

the

the third daie the enemie beganne an other trenche adioynyng to the other in north common
this daie thei visited euery house and tooke an inuentorie of all the victualles and thei whiche saied thei had no victualles the victualles whiche thei had were taken from them and giuen to the souldiers
this daie came fliyng into the market place three partriges whiche the souldiers tooke and eate whiche was a notable token sent from god betokenyng the tyme of the deliueraunce of the citie for within three weekes after we were deliuered euen as captaine cornput had interpreted it
the fourth daie the ayde came accordyng to the said adrian mennickes promise from oldmerct to the wood and the enemie was driuen awaie by our horsemen and after that the whole force of our armie came together
then the enemie shot of twise at the toune
and when he had so doen he planted his ordenaunce vpon the trenche in north common
he shot of also ten tymes at our ayde and yet did no hurte but our ordenaunce paied them a little otherwise to the no small losse of his people
this daie was begunne a rampart at northe newe gate by whiche our ayde meant to victuall vs for thei encamped at the foote of hiddyngberg on steenwike toune side

the fift daie beyng sondaie a sallie was made and in the skirmishe yong conrade the sonne of captaine conrade was slaine with an harquebouze shott
and on the other side thei in the wood had a braue skirmishe with the enemie then the enemie couragioufly got vp against our men vnto the toppe of hiddyngberg but he was lustely receiued and beaten backe to

his losse

the seuenth daie our souldiers tooke a prisoner who tolde vs that captaine snater was slaine the sondaie before as he was leadyng his menne against our succours
but at this sallie it was twentie to one that the enemie had not gotte onniger gate but he was lustely and courageously resisted and repulsed
this daie the magistrate and captaines

made a newe vewe for victualles as aforesaied and the same date was greater stoare of victualles confisked in poore mennes houses then in riche and all because thei were hidden
this night retourned into the citie fower citezens who brought good newes of certaine de and deliueraunce

the thirteene daie the enemie caste vp an other trenche in the saied north common keepyng steendicque trenche and although that this trenche was hurtfull bothe to vs and ours yet was there nothyng saied nor doen against it so that the night ensuyng the enemie beganne to caste vp an other trenche in ysueene waie holden all in with the riuer of ae whiche greatly hindred vs because that the messengers whiche were gone out of the toune were enforced to retourne backe

the fourteene daie the tounesmen on the daie tyme had giuen vpon the tower a signe of fire whiche thei of the wood might well see whereby thei vnderstoode that victualles grewe skant in the toune
and besides for want of wood thei were faine to pull doune their houses to make theim fires

the tounesmen also sallied out vpon the hindermost trench whiche was caste vp in ysueene waie but it was to no purpose for thei were repulsed by the other trenches because that thei whiche laye in the wood would not once helpe them so that thei were driuen to retire without bryngyng to passe their purpose and deuise

the fifteene daie fower citezens entred the toune without staie whiche was a woonder because the enemie had sette a watche rounde aboute the toune not aboue a stones cast one from an other
this daie a signe with fire was giuen that the tounesmen were readie with their bridges to passe the riuer of ae accordyng to the generall of the armies commaundement
the tounesmen also caste vp certaine trenches in the garden diches on the northe side of the toune out of whiche the souldiers of the toune might skirmishe with the enemie in the meane while the bridges were with all possible speede laied ouer the riuer of ae to the ende that our aide should not haue any occasion to staie and in the makyng of this bridge there fell out a meruailous straunge case for whiles the citezens aboute nine of the clocke at night were busied aboute this bridge the enemie in the nexte trenches tainted fower of them with the shot of one harqucbouze one of whiche was captaine conrade and yet not one of them once hurte
the sixteene date the enemie made a trenche of wago~s against our garden trenches and the nexte morrowe a sallie was made out of onniger gate wherin was taken a souldier and a woman whiche woman was examined and forthwith a dromme was sent towardes the enemie to knowe whether he would deliuer the prisoner or no whiche he vtterly refused
the night following the enemie had a notable marme giuen hym as if our aide would haue marched vppon hym but all in vaine because the enemie with all diligence mustred hym self with all his forces vpon northe common

the nineteene daie

aboute the daie breake the enemie armed hym self with all his forces to charge them in the wood but he was so lustely repulsed as that he was driuen to make his retraict

the twentie daie aboute

house criyng out for bread

and eche man had for his share one peece for hym and his familie because there was a morsell of bread more left in the toune
this daie euen at broade noone daie came into the toune fower citezens and three souldiers who in despite of the enemie came betweene the warde and the trenches and although the enemie commyng out of his trenches pursued them yet was there not one of them once tainted nor hurte whiche so encouraged our aide that thei purposed the next daie in the mornyng to reuictuall the toune

the
day of this moneth thei in the wood

laded certaine souldiers with bread and cheese and sent them the very same waie that the rest aforesaied had gone and although the enemie skirmished to stoppe their passage yet passed thei in despite of hym with more losse to hym self then to our men and brought to the toune about
loaues and
cheeses
the night ensuyng thei of the wood beganne to cast a newe trenche some what nexer the toune
and in the daie the enemie with all his forces pressed nere to steendicque common but it was not knowne for what cause
he very busily trauciled also to bring his artillarie behinde easterwike but it was to no purpose
this daie in the euenyng came a fliyng post to the toune with a letter and the night followyng the enemie made a forte of wagons at the passage where our men caried ouer the bread and cheese

the
daie the weather beganne to thaw and the tounes men beganne to cast vp a newe trench within the new bridge without north newe gate
about noone a skirmishe beganne to be coupled betweene the roiters of the wood and the roiters of the enemie
in so muche that nine of our men issued out of their trenches and came to north common chasing out of the one of them the better parte of their launces whiche caused the enemie crye arme arme throughout all his campe suddemly rushyng with all his forces vpon the common how be it thei in the wood would at no hande retire although thei were but a fewe roiters and an handfull of small shott but most couragiously made hedde vpon the enemie drawyng towardes the toune waie wherevpon the souldiers of the tnune in sorte issued out to helpe and ayde those of the wood as that the

enemie receiued hurte enough
and although the enemie by reason of the multitude of his royters wonne a passage yet what with those of the toune behinde and those of the wood before thei were gallantly hansled with harquebouze shott and in the ende so handled as that his souldiers squared somewhat out of order in so muche that it seemed rather a battle then a skirmishe for otherwise could not the roiters bryng their souldiers to the fight and therefore many valiaunt officers captaines of horsemen and others of name were there slaine in so muche that thei were driuen by reason of the raine to retier in order of battle this daie also the cannon on either side plaied her parte lustely and the forte of wagons whiche the enemie had made the night before was broken in peeces and caried to the toune
about foure houres after the enemie was got to rest

thei of the wood had reuictualled the toune with a pretie sprinklyng of some
busshelles of wheate meale cheese and pouder
now the enemie would by no meanes trouble them by reason that the tounesmen had assailed the very nerest trenche of that passage in whiche were two ensignes of suche noble courage as that thei wonne the trenche tooke the artillarie slewe
souldiers and caried awaie the rest that were hurt as prisoners yea and had drawne awaie artillarie and all had not the force of the launces staied them for thei were not halfe well prouided to goe awaie vpon the spurre and againe the night commyng suddenly vppon euery man retiered hym self to his strength
but because the enemie had fought but ill that daie the next night he forsooke his seuen trenches vppon northe common and steendicque and drewe awaie his artillarie

the

of february whiche was the daie of the deliuerance of the toune aboute the breake of the daie three engishe men came out of the wood and passed betweene the trenches but when thei perceiued that there was neither watche nor warde within them thei came to the toune and tolde them of it then issued out of the toune many men and lookyng into the trenches founde neuer a man but the seuenteene dead men whiche laie there and three dead roiters before the trenche
within a while after the enemie set fire on his campe and hauing before

daie sent his artillarie with his footemen before his horsemen stoode in order of battle vntill the afternoone in the plaine fallow fieldes of onnen vntill suche tyme as the englishe colonell generall of the campe came with his colonelles captaines and officers and a fewe horsemen to passe by steenwike in the tayle of the enemie who as yet brauely mustered and shewed hym self
and then was the toune throughly victualled with all thinges necessarie and deliuered from the straight siege

whiche it endured fower whole monethes together and therefore we can not sufficiently enough praise our good god who hath so louingly and mercifully dealt with vs moste miserable wretches

the
of february the armie of the estates departed from the wood and marched towardes oldemerct to expulse the garnisons whiche the enemie had thrust in into ruynder lemmer sloten and many other places moe whiche afterward was performed
in so muche that all these places were againe restored into the handes of the estates and vnited prouinces
vnto whom beseech the lord of his mercie and grace graunt wisedome prouidence and strength daiely more and more to continue their blessed enterprises to the ende thei maie with force resist their enemies prouidently guyde all their affaires and maintaine this debonaire people with all wisedome and equitie
and thus gentle reader conclude and ende this present historie reseruyng the reste of the affaires whiche shall succeede for the beginning of an other booke and if it shall please the lord our god to graunt me that his fauour will surely make thee partaker thereof
